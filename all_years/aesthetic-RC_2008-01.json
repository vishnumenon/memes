{"body": "First, of course having purity in the built-in function type constructor makes a vastly superior default. \n\nHowever, you can *define* an abstract type of pure functions in ML, and enforce those constraints using the type system. In fact, here's a small example of how to define a type of pure, terminating functions in ML:\n\n    module type PURE =\n    sig\n      type 'a pure\n       \n      val out : 'a pure -&gt; 'a\n      val ($) : (('a -&gt; 'b) pure * 'a pure) -&gt; 'b pure\n       \n      val s : (('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'c) -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'c) pure\n      val k : ('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a) pure\n      val i : ('a -&gt; 'a) pure\n    end\n       \n    module Pure : PURE =\n    struct\n      type 'a pure = 'a\n       \n      let out x = x\n      let ($) (f, x) = f x\n      let s x y z = x z (y z)\n      let k x y = x\n      let i x = x\n    end\n\nBecause 1) all the constructors for objects of type `('a -&gt; 'b) pure` are themselves pure and terminating, and 2) type abstraction guarantees there is no other way to build them, it follows that any object of type `('a -&gt; 'b) pure` is a pure, terminating function. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1200069740", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Huckabee, who has visited Israel nine times, also expressed support for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and stressed the importance of making America energy independent in ten years for both environmental and national security reasons. “We just can’t continue to be dependent on Saudi oil,” explained Huckabee, “I want to be able to tell the Saudis that we need their oil about as much as we need their sand.”\r\n\r\nTHIS IS HANDS DOWN WHAT SEPARATES HUCKABEE FROM ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES, AND I REPEAT ALL THE CANDIDATES.\r\n\r\nISRAEL ISRAEL ISRAEL ISRAEL ISRAEL ISRAEL\r\n\r\nYahweh’s LAND !", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1200555441", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
