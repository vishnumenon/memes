{"body": "\"Why are Americans so opposed to socialist policies?\"\n\nSocialist policies are what is bringing the current market correction that we are all going through. It was a socialist policy that started the sub-prime lending. The bail-out bill is a socialist bill.\n\nYes I know the bail-out was passed by Bush, a Republican, but the Congress is controlled by Democrats and they did nothing to stop it either. It's very unfortunate that human psychology played such a heavy roll in this decision. No one in office wants to see a recession/massive correction take place under their watch. They want to believe they can fix it. But the cold facts are that this has been a long time coming. No one can dispute that we have all been over spending and no one can dispute that economists have warned us about this many years ago. *Cough* Ron Paul *Cough*\n\nThis doesn't mean we should support or embrace socialism as a new model of government.
