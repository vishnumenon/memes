{"body": "I had taken a course in college about networking and they touched on linux (very basic, we installed red hat and learned some basic shell scripting etc then moved on) and I was always intrigued. Fast Forward about 9 years and I am a newlywed and we need a computer. We purchase a modest Compaq and enjoy XP for about a year. I begin to tire of keeping the AV up to date and constantly having to nanny my computer, also it began to s l o w  d o w n terribly. It was about this time I started to hear about a new \"user friendly\" version of linux called \"Ubuntu\". I remembered that class back in college and thought well lets see how far it's come. I'll download this Live CD thingie and see if it's easy enough for my wife to use. I thought I would have the CD in for 15 minutes top, have some obscure driver issues and be back to comfortable old XP in no time. To my surprise everything just worked. And it was FAST. Even off the CD it was much faster than windows. I left that cd in for 2 weeks. Never needed a reboot. My wife quite liked it because the system was so much snappier. I was still a little petrified of the install process though. I had a lot of pictures and music on my hard drive already and no way to back it all up. Then I clicked on this youtube video showing a Compiz demo. MIND BLOWN. I had to have it.  I worked hard for a month and earned a bonus. I ran to Microcenter and got a cheap video card and a new 300gb drive. I set up a dual boot system with Ubuntu on the 300gb drive and Windows XP on the OEM 150gb drive. For the next 3 months I occasionally booted into windows to play Half Life or use Fruity Loops. Eventually I found Urban Terror, Wine, and Renoise. Haven't looked back.

{"body": "[Metacognition:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition)\n\nThe art of thinking about one's thought processes.\n\nIf you can figure out the way you learn [will I retain something better if I read it silently? Read it aloud? Have it read to me?] then you can learn things faster. You can also decide which ways you learn things better [Will I throw a baseball better by reading techniques or being shown new techniques or just throwing throwing the damn thing and thinking about it myself?] and based on those findings you can figure out new ways to both learn new and/or expand upon existing ideas faster.\n\nA lot of it has to do with motivation too. If you're learning something for a class or boss you loathe or have little interest in, you'll be less motivated and could fight yourself. Defining a reason for learning as well as finding your won motivation can help as much as metacognitive processes.\n\nWhile getting my masters in teaching we took a motivation class that summed it up into 3 parts:\n* Active choice: I want to/I do not want to learn this and therefore will/will not\n* Persistence: I want to learn this and started reading a book last week, but can't get myself to focus long enough to get past chapter 1. OR I don't want to put in the work to learn this new skill, I just want to know it.\n* Difficulty: I want to learn about sound theory but I can't understand this book about it, no matter how much I read and re-read it.\n\nSo, figure out your motivation for doing something and if you find any of these three obstacles, figure out the best way to overcome it.\n\nThat's basically it, but since it's written pretty academically I'll try to provide a real life example. Say you're me and you're learning to play the Glockenspiel part from Mozart's *The Magic Flute*. Every time you get to the end of the first phrase, you mess up and play a wrong note. Instead of just mindlessly playing the part over and over again, hoping that you'll get it right, you could think about what is messing you up. You try playing it slower and discover you get messed up because your hands cross over and you slow down, so you change the order of your \"sticking\" [which hands are playing which note, like R L R L instead of R L R R] and find it's much easier. Instead of just mindlessly playing and wasting time so you might eventually be able to play it, you thought about the way you played and discovered you were handicapping yourself.

In only six of these cases was there\nevidence of anyone being arrested, and in only two cases were charges laid, although there\nw e re at least 39 named suspects. Six advice files were submitted to CPS, with respect to possible\nc h a rges being laid against the complainant for perv e rting the course of justice, and two were\nc h a rged. Intere s t i n g l y, most cases in this category had a forensic examination (82%, n=178),\nwhilst far fewer made a formal statement to the police (58%, n=126), suggesting that this is a\ncritical stage for the admission or designation of allegations as false.\n\nSo, two men charged falsely  (note that the category of \"false\" was assigned by the police, based on lack of forensic evidence), and two woman charged with perversion of justice.  \n\nSorry, I don't mean to imply that false rape accusations are NOT a problem. No one should be falsely accused of a crime. And people who make false accusations should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  However, purposely misinterpreting the research in order to boost your falsehood that rapes hardly occur and false accusations are the *real* crime, is bogus.\n\n\nAlso,  the article reports:\n\n&gt; Studies show that the number of rapes in US male prisons dwarfs all cases on the outside.\n\nYes, if you believe that a full 45% of rapes reported by women are \"false\", yet believe all men, clearly rapes of men is epidemic while rapes of women barely exist.\n\nFinally, wow.

I know you may think that they're not quite as into physical contact as you are, but they are, trust me.\n\nIf you have a legitimate reason to touch her, then run with it.\n\nExample (Last weekend): Katie's complaining about her back being sore for the entire evening. After a while Ashley start's complaining too. I had no idea of what was going on (too drunk, too inexperienced.) Katie actually *mentions backrubs*. Nothing happens until she literally sits the fuck down in front of me and said to touch her.\n\nNow I do know enough to figure out what to do at this point. Son, if you ever find yourself in the situation of giving a backrub, I have two words for you: erogenous zones. Read up, study them, know them. Finally, practice. After a few minutes of just rubbing her neck she'll be loosened up a bit and you can easily tell whether or not she's into it. If you're not certain if she likes it, ask her. Whisper something into her ear, brush your fingers against her wrist. The nape of her neck is also really, really sensitive.\n\nYou're going to have fun. That's the key point to always remember. She's a beautiful creature, treat her as such. Be respectful, kind, and loving.
