{"body": "This is the best method I've encountered for creating strong passwords that look completely random to other people, for multiple websites and systems, while making it pretty easy to remember your password for any given resource.\n\nFirst, create a common password root that you will memorize and never write down. You make this root with something that's easy to remember, but then obfuscate the password. You start with any sentence, like a line from a book, a quote or anything else. It should be at least 8 words long. For instance, let's use a song lyric from, oh, Daft Punk's *Digital Love*\n\nLast Night I Had A Dream About You\n\nNow, let's take the first letter of each word:\n\nL N I H A D A Y\n\nNow, let's obfuscate it using capital and lowercase letters, plus some leet-speak-type replacements to get numbers and symbols in there:\n\nL n 1 h 4 d @ y\n\nYou have a password root of Ln1h4d@y. It's 8 characters long with a mix of 4 character types, it uses no dictionary words nor is it anything anyone would know except you. And it's easier to remember because you can remember the song lyric you used.\n\nNow, use this root to construct individual passwords for each website or system you need a password for, by creating a system based on a common system you use to tack on a modifier to the root password based on the password in question. With an 8-character password that uses 4 character types, you can add anything to the end of it and maintain a strong password. But you need to create a system so that, by remembering the root password and knowing the website you want to visit, you will never forget the password but don't need to write any passwords down, ever.\n\nLet's say you make your password modifier the name of the website, minus all vowels. So your password for reddit.com would be Ln1h4d@yrddt. The password for your GMail account would be Ln1h4d@ygml. Or you use only the vowels, for Ln1h4d@yei on Reddit and Ln1h4d@yai for GMail. Use whatever you want, just make sure it's not obvious at a glance what the password is for (Ln1h4d@yreddit is bad).\n\nNow you've got a system of passwords that you'll remember, and you should be able to just look at the name of the website you're trying to log into in order to remember what your password is for that website.\n\nThis system means you:\n\n* Don't have just one password that will give someone access to every passworded resource you use\n* Are as safe as you can reasonably be against brute-force attacks by having long, strong passwords\n* Have a non-guessable password\n* Shouldn't have problems remembering your passwords\n* Will quickly become used to typing the majority of the password so you're not hunting-and-pecking a bunch of characters (which helps secure against shoulder surfers)\n\nThe key to this is keeping your password root and your mnemonic for your password suffixes secret. Don't write them down. It'll take a little while to get used to typing your root password, but pretty soon it'll be nearly unconscious, you'll fly through it.\n\nThis isn't a perfect system, but the chances that someone figures out both your root password and your suffix creation method is pretty damned slim. It's definitely better than having a single, strong password for everything you use; this way, if a website gets cracked or someone gets a single password of yours, they only have one password. And it's safer than a text file.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1251826775", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "x30010 would be kind of dissonant, because technically you're using the 2nd and not the 9th.  The notes are C D G C E, so the D is only a whole step above the root.  To truly be a 9th, it should be an octave above the root at least.\n\nI'm trying to figure out why this would sound minor at all, but I'm not seeing it.  I thought maybe it would be something like how a C6 has the same notes as an Am7, but that's not the case as far as I can tell.\n\nE G C D: is sort of an E minor, but without a 5th and a 6th and 7th added.  I suppose you could call that one an Em13.\n\nG C D E: would be a G6sus4.\n\nD E G C: would be a D11 without the 3rd and the 7th. \n\nYou can often leave notes out of a voicing, which is why I sometimes identified a chord even if it didn't have the 3rd, 5th or 7th.

{"body": "Oriental/Eastern music is based off a pentatonic scale, which means there are five notes.  Since the birds don't hang upside-down or sit *in* the wire, the only spaces they can fill are between the lines and above the top line.  Reading the wires as a treble clef staff, this gives you the notes F, A, C, E and G, a five note scale.  This is not the typical pentatonic scale (which is do-re-mi-so-la, or F G A C D if you start from F), but still yields a similar intervalic structure, which makes it sound pretty similar.\n\nEdit: Messed up the example pentatonic scale, I wrote F G A C E, which is [non-sequentially] what the birds gave us.  Standard pentatonic scale would be F G A C D.  Note that F and E are a half-step away, a dissonance that doesn't happen in a do-re-mi-so-la pentatonic scale.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1252600160", "subreddit": "Music", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm back at work after the weekend, so if you don't mind I'll be brief, and try to tackle only the most important points and direct questions. ;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; If I claim there are fairies under my bed, it's not up to you to disprove that - it's up to me to prove it\n\n&gt; i submit that anti-theists are claiming just as many monsters are in the closet as theists are claiming fairies under the bed.\n\nLooking back, I feel we should clarify terms here.  *Most* atheists will accept that there is *theoretically* a tiny chance that God could exist (can't prove a negative), but *pragmatically* discount his existence day-to-day for the same reason they don't believe in fairies under the bed.  This is a perfectly rational, logical, sensible position.\n\nThere are also hardcore/irrational/uneducated atheists, who will not even countenance the *theoretical possibility* that God exists.  These people have a *belief* that they can prove a negative, and so are believers just as much as religious people are.\n\nThe second group are the group that people are talking about when they say \"atheists are believers too\", but they're a silly, uneducated fringe group - the first group represents most atheists.  Moreover, it's easy to *mistake* the first group for the second when they assume you're speaking pragmatically, instead of in terms of anally-retentive mathematical definitions.\n\nThe second group (\"irrational atheists\") are arguably positing \"monsters under the bed\", and (disregarding wildly-varying estimates of the likelihood of their beliefs being true) are comparable to religious believers (as you do above).\n\nThe first group (\"rational atheists\") posit no monsters or fairies of any kind anywhere - they don't posit *anything* (seriously: if you think they do, please give an example ;-).\n\nThis is why (rational) atheists get so annoyed when religious people draw equivalences between their belief systems and our *lack* of a belief.  It's exactly like atheists arguing that *all* religions are exactly as destructive or dangerous as creationism or fundamentalism - unfair, inaccurate and contributing nothing to the debate.\n\n&gt; and each has arguments in their favor\n\nAs a \"rational atheist\" (using the definition above) I do see my reasoning as rational.  Equally, as I've never yet heard a rational/logical argument in favour of belief, I see religious beliefs as inherently irrational.  I don't mean to offend - just to explain why I hold this opinion.  As I've said elsewhere, I'd be *very, very interested* to hear a rational case for believing in God - if you have one, please explain it!\n\n&gt;&gt; we're both atheists - I just don't believe in one more god than you\n\n&gt; Good point i have not heard this before, good thing i believe in the right one ;)\n\nHeheh.  It's a joke, but it's also the central crux of the atheist position - you believe X, but not W, Y or Z.\n\nLacking any evidence any of them are correct, I believe none of them.  Therefore it's not up to me to explain why I *don't* believe them (as explained: lack of compelling evidence).\n\nHowever, if - in the absence of compelling evidence - you *do* still believe in X, if you have a rational reason, it must also explain why you then don't *also* believe in W, Y and Z...?\n\nAnd equally, if your reasons for not believing in W, Y and Z are rational, don't they apply equally to X?\n\n&gt; atheists can not do this towards their own belief, why is it expected for others belief?\n\nActually, most atheists *can* explain this rationally (see above).  Not believing in things for which there is no evidence is not irrational - it's the default position.  *Believing* something without compelling evidence is irrational, so it's up to the religious believer to either provide evidence that his faith isn't irrational, or to accept that it might be (no offence ;-).\n\n&gt; Pascal's wager, as it is, is a logical reason to believe in a God.\n\nNope - it requires all [sorts of baseless assumptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager#Criticisms), and ignores the \"if X, why not W, Y or Z\" question above.\n\nGiven this, Pascale's Wager is a scaffolding of logic built on a foundation of belief, not a rational argument in its own right.\n\n&gt;&gt; we don't have even one tiny fraction of the knowledge required to calculate the \"chances\" of the universe existing\n\n&gt; we do have the ability to calculate the probability of certain preexisting conditions or miscellaneous other things needed for certain theories. for example:\n\nIndeed, but a probability sum like `X x Y x Z = answer` is still useless if we only know the probabilities of some of the terms.\n\nIf I tell you that X + Y + Z = 10, and we know that X is 5, there's still mathematically *no way* for you to work out what Y or Z are.  And probability calculations involving the existence of the universe rely on entire *books* full of presently-unknown variables.  In fact, [we don't even know what the *equation* should look like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything), let alone the values of the terms involved in it.\n\n&gt; Can you respect someone religious who has rationally thought through what they believe-and can tell you their rationale\n\nFirst off, I always try to respect *people* to the best of my ability - it's their *opinions* I don't always respect. ;-)\n\n&gt; (regardless if you can find fault in it\n\nIf I *can't* find fault in their opinion, then of course I'll respect it, whether it's what I originally thought or not.  If I can find fault in their reasoning then their reasoning is *not correct*, so naturally I don't respect any conclusions they come to using it.\n\nI respect *them*, and I respect their *attempt* to reason out their belief, but I don't respect the belief itself.\n\n&gt; accept that there is fault in your argument as well)\n\nI'm open to the idea that my position is at fault, but (as my position is internally consistent, and in order to function in any way) I assume it is correct until demonstrated otherwise.\n\nIf someone holds a different opinion I can't see a fault with and they can point out a fault with mine, I change my opinion to match theirs.\n\nIf someone holds a different opinion I can't fault and they can't fault mine, I change my position to \"undecided between both opinions\" on the issue.\n\nIf someone holds a different opinion I can fault, and they can't fault mine, I conclude that they are most likely to be wrong, and keep my position the same.\n\nIf someone holds a different opinion I can fault and they can fault mine, I reject both positions and change my position to \"undecided, without a good answer\" on the issue.\n\n&gt; i am sorry, i was talking about the many many scientist who, upon doing the math, have decied that it is easier to believe in an intelligent designer than a big bang.\n\nIt depends.  I respect them and their attempt, but (in the absence of a compelling, rational line of reasoning), I don't just assume they're correct.\n\nThinking about it, I think you might have got the wrong end of the stick when I said \"respect\".  It's entirely possible to respect a *person* or their *attempt* to rationalise something, without respecting *the line of reasoning* itself, or the *conclusion* they come to.\n\nI don't mean I think Fred Hoyle is an idiot, or anything like that - I mean that I respect Fred Hoyle a great deal, I respect his attempt to find a rational argument in favour of belief, but I suspect (in the continuing absence *of* such an argument) that he allowed his reasoning to become irrational.\n\nIn the case of Fred Hoyle, for example, his atheism was [apparently first shaken](http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Science-Religion/2001/09/Was-Life-Begun-By-Chance-Not-A-Chance.aspx?p=2) by a discovery about element-transmutation in stars which the standard model predicted was unlikely.\n\nIn this case, he had two choices: assume the theory model was wrong, or assume it's correct, and then the only way to explain the discrepancy is to posit a being (or beings) outside of our continuum responsible for setting it up like that.\n\nThe first belief is the scientific one (indeed, it's pretty much the basis foundation of all science), and the second is an irrational one (it needlessly violates Occam's Razor, and posits an even-more-unlikely scenario than us simply having an incomplete understanding.\n\nSo yes, in this case, while I respect Fred Hoyle, his reasons for concluding God (or some type of super-powerful alien) exists are basically a naked [argument from ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance), a known logical error.\n\n&gt; But i can respect you for your rationale and effort admitting that we can not know if either is correct, can you return the favor?\n\nAs I said, I respect *people*, and I respect their search for understanding, but I don't respect individual *ideas* unless they're the product of rational thought.\n\nYou've said several times that you have a rational reason for believing in God, but you haven't advanced it yet - would you do so?  If it's genuinely rational then I'd be very excited to hear it, and will adopt it as my on if I can't shoot it down and it isn't basically just a judgement call... but in return, if I can point out a serious hole in it, will you accept that the belief is then irrational?\n\nI'm genuinely interested, if you are.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1253022582", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Taking from Charlie Sheen (I know you can argue that why listen to  some idiot on a garbage tv show). But here are 20 questions that have not and will never be answed. Why? Who's knows?  I would love to have these questions answered so I dont have to think the country I was born in and will die in, killed thousands to start bogus wars.\r\n\r\nOkay, first; On the FBI’s most wanted list Osama Bin Laden is not charged with the crimes of 911. When I called the FBI to ask them why this was the case, they replied: “There’s not enough evidence to link Bin Laden to the crime scene,” I later discovered he had never even been indicted by the D.O.J.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 2; FBI translator Sibel Edmonds, was dismissed and gagged by the D.O.J. after she revealed that the government had foreknowledge of plans to attack American cities using planes as bombs as early as April 2001. In July of ‘09, Mrs. Edmonds broke the Federal gag order and went public to reveal that Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the Taliban were all working for and with the C.I.A. up until the day of 9/11.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 3; The following is a quote from Mayor Giuliani during an interview on 9/11 with Peter Jennings for ABC News. “I went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 Barkley Street, which was right there with the Police Commissioner, the Fire Commissioner, the Head of Emergency Management, and we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse. And it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building, so we were trapped in the building for 10, 15 minutes, and finally found an exit and got out, walked north, and took a lot of people with us.”\r\n\r\nWHO TOLD HIM THIS??? To this day, the answer to this question remains unanswered, completely ignored and emphatically DENIED by Mayor Giuliani on several public occasions.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 4; In April 2004, USA Today reported, “In the two years before the Sept. 11 attacks, the North American Aerospace Defense Command conducted exercises simulating what the White House says was unimaginable at the time: hijacked airliners used as weapons to crash into targets and cause mass casualties.” One of the targets was the World Trade Center.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 5; On September 12th 2007, CNN’s ‘Anderson Cooper 360′, reported that the mysterious “white plane” spotted and videotaped by multiple media outlets, flying in restricted airspace over the White House shortly before 10am on the morning of 9/11, was in fact the Air Force’s E-4B, a specially modified Boeing 747 with a communications pod behind the cockpit; otherwise known as “The Doomsday Plane”.\r\n\r\nThough fully aware of the event, the 9/11 Commission did not deem the appearance of the military plane to be of any interest and did not include it in the final 9/11 Commission report.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 6; Three F-16s assigned to Andrews Air Force Base, ten miles from Washington, DC, are conducting training exercises in North Carolina 207 miles away as the first plane crashes into the WTC. Even at significantly less than their top speed of 1500 mph, they could still have defended the skies over Washington well before 9am, more than 37 minutes before Flight 77 crashes into the Pentagon, however, they did not return until after 9:55am.\r\n\r\nAndrews AFB had no armed fighters on alert and ready to take off on the morning of 9/11.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 7; WTC Building 7. Watch the video of its collapse.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 8; Flight 93 is fourth plane to crash on 9/11 at 10:03am. V.P. Cheney only gives shoot down order at 10:10-10:20am and this is not communicated to NORAD until 28 minutes after Flight 93 has crashed.\r\n\r\nFueling further suspicion on this front is the fact that three months before the attacks of 9/11, Dick Cheney usurped control of NORAD, and therefore he, and no one else on planet Earth, had the power to call for military sorties on the hijacked airliners on 9/11. He did not exercise that power. Three months after 9/11, he relinquished command of NORAD and returned it to military operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA d v e r t i s e m e n t\r\n\r\nCS – Number 9; Scores of main stream news outlets reported that the F.B.I. conducted an investigation of at least FIVE of the 9/11 hijackers being trained at U.S. military flight schools. Those investigations are now sealed and need to be declassified.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 10; In 2004, New York firefighters Mike Bellone and Nicholas DeMasi went public to say they had found the black boxes at the World Trade Center, but were told to keep their mouths shut by FBI agents. Nicholas DeMasi said that he escorted federal agents on an all-terrain vehicle in October 2001 and helped them locate the devices, a story backed up by rescue volunteer Mike Bellone.\r\n\r\nAs the Philadelphia Daily News reported at the time, “Their story raises the question of whether there was a some type of cover-up at Ground Zero.”\r\n\r\nCS – Number 11 – Hundreds of eye witnesses including first responders, fire captains, news reporters, and police, all described multiple explosions in both towers before and during the collapse.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 12; An astounding video uncovered from the archives shows BBC News correspondent Jane Standley reporting on the collapse of WTC Building 7 over twenty minutes before it fell at 5:20pm on the afternoon of 9/11. Tapes from earlier BBC broadcasts show news anchors discussing the collapse of WTC 7 a full 26 minutes in advance. The BBC at first claimed that their tapes from 9/11 had been “lost” before admitting that they made the “error” of reporting the collapse of WTC 7 before it happened without adequately explaining how they could have obtained advance knowledge of the event.\r\n\r\nIn addition, over an hour before the collapse of WTC 7, at 4:10pm, CNN’s Aaron Brown reported that the building “has either collapsed, or is collapsing.”\r\n\r\nCS – Number 13; Solicitor General Ted Olson’s claim that his wife Barbara Olsen called him twice from Flight 77, describing hijackers with box cutters, was a central plank of the official 9/11 story.\r\n\r\nHowever, the credibility of the story was completely undermined after Olsen kept changing his story about whether his wife used her cell phone or the airplane phone. The technology to enable cell phone calls from high-altitude airline flights was not created until 2004. American Airlines confirmed that Flight 77 was a Boeing 757 and that this plane did not have airplane phones on board.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FBI, Barbara Olsen attempted to call her husband only once and the call failed to connect, therefore Olsen must have been lying when he claimed he had spoken to his wife from Flight 77.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 14; The size of a Boeing 757 is approximately 125ft in width and yet images of the impact zone at the Pentagon supposedly caused by the crash merely show a hole no more than 16ft in diameter. The engines of the 757 would have punctured a hole bigger than this, never mind the whole plane. Images before the partial collapse of the impact zone show little real impact damage and a sparse debris field completely inconsistent with the crash of a large jetliner, especially when contrasted with other images showing airplane crashes into buildings.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 15; What is the meaning behind the following quote attributed to Dick Cheney which came to light during the 9/11 Commission hearings? The passage is taken from testimony given by then Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the airplane was coming in to the Pentagon, there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President, “The plane is 50 miles out.” “The plane is 30 miles out.” And when it got down to “the plane is 10 miles out,” the young man also said to the Vice President, “Do the orders still stand?” And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said, “Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the contrary?”\r\n\r\nAs the plane was not shot down, in addition to the fact that armed fighter jets were nowhere near the plane and the Pentagon defensive system was not activated, are we to take it that the orders were to let the plane find its target?\r\n\r\nCS – Number 16; In May 2003, the Miami Herald reported how the Bush administration was refusing to release a 900-page congressional report on 9/11 because it wanted to “avoid enshrining embarrassing details in the report,” particularly regarding pre-9/11 warnings as well as the fact that the hijackers were trained at U.S. flight schools.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 17; Top Pentagon officials cancelled their scheduled flights for September 11th on September 10th. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, following a security warning, cancelled a flight into New York that was scheduled for the morning of 9/11.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 18; The technology to enable cell phone calls from high-altitude airline flights was not created until 2004, and even by that point it was only in the trial phase. Calls from cell phones which formed an integral part of the official government version of events were technologically impossible at the time.\r\n\r\nCS – Number 19: On April 29, 2004, President Bush and V.P. Cheney would only meet with the commission under specific clandestine conditions. They insisted on testifying together and not under oath. They also demanded that their testimony be treated as a matter of “state secret.” To date, nothing they spoke of that day exists in the public domain.\r\n\r\nCS – And finally Mr. President – Number 20; A few days after the attack, several newspapers as well as the FBI reported that a paper passport had been found in the ruins of the WTC. In August 2004, CNN reported that 9/11 hijacker Ziad Jarrah’s visa was found in the remains of Flight 93 which went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\r\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1253814127", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;So what kind of cooperation occurs in the game.\n\nUnlike in COD, Gears and halo, there is no regenerative health system in MAG. Right now, the mayor cooperation is with medics healing and reviving fallen squad members.   There is no class system by the way, everyone is a soldier, but by choosing your accessories you are designated on screen with a medical \"+\" sign by your nick. This helps to indicate to fallen team mates that are \"bleeding out\" that there is a squad member with a med kit on them that can revive them.\n\n\nAlso, there is a repair kit, that basically makes you an engineer, you can fix structures, like doors (to hinder the progress of the enemy into a building) and vehicles.\n\n\nIf the squad leader is pretty knowledgeable on how the objective works, he will be speaking over voice chat giving out tips and advice on how to take out the objective. Plus its always a bonus to be close to the squad leader considering he can activate a buff, that can give you stuff like faster reload, faster running, less damage, stuff like that. \n\n\n&gt;Post Moar! \n\n\nEvery time you level up you get a skill point. The perks are available to purchase by spending skill points. You want a grip on your machine gun? 1 skill point. You want to purchase a high damage sniper rifle? 3 skill points, and so on and so on. I think this structure is called a \"skill tree\" in gaming, you can dictate what type of class you want to play by the way you spend your skill points.\n\n&gt;does it really feel like two armies fighting each other?\n\nYes!! that's where MAG really comes together as something different. Everywhere you look there is fighting happening. Specially if you are defending a line of objectives placed side by side, for example  A B C D E F and your squad is charged with protecting D, when you spawn, you spawn into \"hell on earth\". The map on the hud looks like **2 ant farms** of different colors that live next to each other that has been disturbed. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1253832526", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "They used the first programming language.  The 1's and 0's he's referring to is called **[Binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system)**.  1 is TRUE or ON and 0 is FALSE or OFF.  A computer at its core level uses binary instructions to do everything.  An 8-bit computer processes 1's and 0's in 8 bit chunks, a 16-bit computer processes 1's and 0's in 16 bit chunks, and so forth.  Modern personal computers are either 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nBinary works by each digit's value doubling starting from the right... so\n\n    000 = 0\n    001 = 1\n    010 = 2\n    011 = 3\n    100 = 4\n    101 = 5\n    110 = 6\n    111 = 7\n\nThe right column is always equal to 1 or 0.\n\nThe middle column is always equal to 2 or 0.\n\nThe left column is always equal to 4 or 0.\n\nThe total is the sum of these.  Each value corresponds to a letter or character of some sort.  For example, binary H = 01001000, which adds up to 18.  This makes sense, because it is the 18's letter in the alphabet...\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G **H**\n\nThe text HELLO in binary is:\n\n    01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 01001111\n\nYou can convert other strings to binary for fun [here](http://home2.paulschou.net/tools/xlate/).\n\nAn 8-bit computer would take the first 01001000 and output 'H' for you, then move onto the next chunk '01000101' and output an 'E'.  A 32-bit computer is much more efficent because it can do 4 chunks at a time (32 1's and 0's).  So it would take 01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 and convert it to HELL and then process the next 4 chunks.\n\nI assume that a computer reads each 1 and 0 and then depending on what it is, lets electricity flow through a YES or NO option and makes decisions on what to do.  I only vaguely understand this part, but if someone else would like to take a stab by all means...\n\nDon't get hung up on this.

{"body": "&gt;Is it really one big battle, or just a bunch of little combined battles?\n\nIt's a bunch of small combined battles. Imagine your normal multiplayer FPS, you know when you being playing, you play on a map that has invisible walls / borders. These borders are there to contain the battle in a predetermined area. If its a building, all the doors are locked. If its outside, it'll be either trees, barbed wire, vehicles or whatever that is blocking the exits. In MAG your predetermined area has no borders, which means you can keep going left or right or north or south and you'll eventually come into contact with another battle.\n\n&gt;What are the maps like?\nHuge, or medium depending on the how many character it supports. Not all maps are 256 maps. Some are 128 and some are 64.\n\n&gt;Damage wise, is it ultra-realistic like America's Army, semi-realistic like COD4, or unrealistic like Unreal Tournament?\n\nSomething like COD4 . The reason its not exactly like COD4 is that health is not self regenerating . You can die fast if your armor level is 1 ( you can upgrade to armor 3 but you move slower).  Still the 1 to 1 skirmishes between 2 players is settled in about 1-2 seconds like in COD 4.\n\n&gt;Are the opposing factions similar?\n\nI don't know. Like in an MMO, you make a character and you choose a faction, and you only play that character in that faction all the time. The Beta only allows the creation of 1 character in 1 faction. I suppose in the future you can create multiple characters, one for each faction.\n\n&gt;Do the objectives change as you complete them, or is it the same one the whole game?\n\nThey change. For example, lets say you have have A B C D E F objectives in a 128 player map (64 vs 64)  where VALOR is attacking RAVEN. C and D are locked until A B and E F fall. So right down the middle your faction is split on the left and right flank. 4 squads (8 players per squad = 32) spawn on the left and 4 squads spawn on the right. Your squad leader will designate your objective. So 2 squads take on A and 2 squads take on B, or maybe your platoon leader says screw em and instructs all squad leaders on the left flank to bum rush A, and all 4 squads take out A. Once A and B are taken, you have to wait till E and F are taken out so C and D are unlocked. The waiting game is a defense game, since RAVEN can reacquire A and B again if you don't hold your position.\n\nThe balance issues occurs if one of the sides flanking quite simply suck at attacking or are encountering a heavy defense. You might have some experience guys using their perks really well (poison gas, mines, sniper harassment, good medics) on one side, and completing their objectives, while the other side might be riddled with newbies or taking on veterans defending their objectives. The squad leader position could very well be a game breaking thing for you if your squad is not doing their job (kinda like herding cats).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1253975278", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The blocking I/O, threads  multiplying like rabbits, buffer allocation thrashing, and other fail built into many network apps has created this weird illusion that you need big iron to serve lots of clients. The fact that IP and TCP stacks are not built for multi-core and use simple linear scan algorithms for select I/O is another problem. There is no reason a single PC-sized machine should not be able to open *millions* of TCP connections, provided the bandwidth is there and the IP stack and app were not built with naive clunky algorithms.\n\nYou could run a *gigantic* static page site on a single EC2 instance for example.
