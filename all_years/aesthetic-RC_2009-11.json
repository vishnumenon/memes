{"body": "Some great advice in this thread. And some not so great.\n\nI just created a throw-away account in order to answer this question. Because I've been having buttsecks for decades. I practically invented it!\n\nFirstly, because you are a guy, the quick answer is **out of this world fantastic**.\n\nBut that's all about you. We need to talk about her...\n\nIf you do this wrong the first time, she will never entertain the idea of doing it again. And that would suck for you. And, even for her! So, here goes the advice:\n\nBE NICE!\n\nFirstly, people's (women's) biology vary greatly. With some women, you's swear they never pooped in their lives. An ass as clean as a whistle. Every single time. Others, not so much. If she's of the 'not so much' variety, she can use a laxative beforehand. My last GF did this.\n\nWhat you *never* see in porn is a girl running to the bathroom with shit flying. Or a guy with big gobs of crap on his dick. Thankfully, I've never see this first-hand either! But I'm sure it could happen. There have been smaller messes. A wet washcloth next to the bed is a really good idea. I purchased dark washcloths and towels for this very activity.\n\nStart the ass-play during regular sex. Put some lube (or just spit) on your pinkie while having regular sex. Use it to rub around and on her anus as you have vaginal sex. This is kind of a warm-up exercise and can continue until you actually penetrate her anus with your finger. Which might happen in only a few minutes!\n\nYou should actually do this for a week or so. Perhaps four or five sexual encounters. You can upgrade to ring finger, then thumb over the course of a week. If she's an anal virgin (and we're assuming so here) it is going to feel unnatural and unnerving. Let her get used to this (originally strange) feeling.\n\nLube - There can never be too much lube. Lube her butt and every last mm of your cock. Slather your penis with lube. Really.\n\nWater-based lube cleans-up really quickly. Silicone lube is difficult to clean-up, requiring a lot of soap and water. Basically, a shower. But, is much slicker. Lube is expensive. :(\n\nFrom my experience, the first actual penis-anus penetration should be in the missionary position. Face-to-face. You're doing something really intimate here and you want to look directly at her (pretty!) face while doing it. So you can see how this is all playing-out for her. Talk. Ask how it feels. Go super slow. Be happy the tip is in. Say something encouraging here. \"OMG I can totally feel the tip is in. You feel like heaven!\"\n\nHere's a million-dollar trick: Once you have the tip in, and are doing the face-to-face thing, and you are going super slow... At this point, bite the lobe of one of her ears while you insert yourself s l o w l y.\n\nThis is her first anal sex. It **has** to be about her. It has to be slow and nice and you have to be happy with the simple fact that you are where you are. It should be more than enough to get you to cum.\n\nAfter a couple of these encounters, she will beg you to plow her ass. And, will start to push back during doggie-style (Which is the best thing ever, btw.) You'll soon be able to tap that ass full length and, full speed. But, get there slowly.\n\nTL;DR - If you do it wrong the first time, all bets are off! Which is sad, because great anal sex is the best thing in the world.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1257121518", "subreddit": "nsfw", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves

leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope

the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew

It seems to vary here. \n\nThe treble in the strings and percussion seems weak in spots\n\nThus the melody gets lost.\n\nI end up being impressed by the wall of sound, but unable to remember a melody to sing, whistle or hum after it is finished.\n\nThis may be mostly a sound balance thing. But it needs to be fixed, because I really want to remember a theme. \n\nThe over all effect is very good, but it needs work. \n\n---\n\nedit yes there is a notable theme in the middle section starting at about 4 min. This gets pushed aside with the wall of sound in the final section.\n\nAlso there is so much potential in the first few bars, but you leave it aside after you use it once. It is certainly worth bringing back in, maybe re-harmonized and inserted starting at 6m20s or so, an echo somehow of the original, before moving on to you final section.\n\nUsing the material you have, you could make this a bigger piece. You would repeat sections in a later section, but transformed somehow.\n\nThe wall of sound tends to act as an eraser on what went before. The music should imply a larger drama.\n\nIt should not be just A B C D E \n\nIn this case I would go A B C A' B' D E\n\nA' B' indicate repeated elements that are modified \n\nEdit 2: Properly done, It will be both longer as a piece of music, and will feel shorter, due to the repeated elements.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1259042891", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sir I understand your pain, but you must see it from a European side.\n\nNow I must preface my comment with the fact that I lived in America for 4 months and it completely blew my mind.  Mainly because I could not understand why the Americans I had met in my own country and around Europe were nothing like the Americans I met while living in the country.\n\nThe types of American I have met in Europe are:\n\nAmerican Tourist Family:  A group of at least 4 Americans that even in an English speaking country speak loudly about how terrible everything is, can not find national monuments that are over 300ft high and visible from many parts of the city they are in, find public transport with English maps and English speaking information assistants confusing, commenting on how old the buildings are and speaking 12 times louder than anyone else.\n\nDouchebag Students:  Loud obnoxious people that can not handle the amount of alcohol they drink, that travel around Europe getting fucked up and pretending that they are on spring break in some of the most picturesque and serene places in Europe while intently speaking English v e r y  s l o w ly (Not the only people guilty of this) to natives and treating them like they are retards.\n\nThose are the two main types most Europeans run into, and the fact we are bombarded by your media and affected by your countries whims makes Europeans resentful.

{"body": "I used to do this with older controllers. Even made my own DDR pads in the past.\r\n\r\nIt will involve cutting the wires to the pad though, so you may lose your ability to use it on the Wii unless you make a connector that can be swapped from the wii cord to a 360 controller plug in.\r\n\r\nBasically you want to open up the controller and find a ground lead as well as a spot that all of the buttons use. Look at the pattern on the circuit board underneath the A B X Y buttons and it shuold be pretty clear. There will be a rubber plunger that comes down and connects two leads on the PCB, connecting the ground and the button.\r\n\r\nSo what you can do is take a wire while the controller is connected and touch the ground and the other part together and find out where all of the buttons can be activated from.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou'll need to know which wire coming from the dance pad goes to which arrow/button on it, which can be figured out from some trial and error. Then you just solder wires going from dance pad onto the PCB of the controller.\r\n\r\nIt works, but it can be quite a bit of work. \r\n\r\nEDIT: It would be advised to buy the cheapest 360 controller you can find to do it with. Partly because you risk less if you mess up, and partly because they tend to have much more simplistic innerds.
