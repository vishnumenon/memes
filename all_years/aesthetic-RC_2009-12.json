{"body": "I've had the last year off completely, but I live in London, so I had the ability to join in any sort of hobby or club I wish. But here's what I did, as a guide for you:\n\n**Step 1:** Ignore anyone that tells you to join a gym.\n\n**Step 2:** Learn about high intensity interval training. Someone else mentioned *P90X.* I just looked it up and that's exactly what this is. Personally, I've been a big fan of *Never Gymless*, can be bought on http://rosstraining.com/  Both have set-out plans for you to go with. *Never Gymless* has a 50-day plan. The idea behind both as far as I can see is functional training: Don't train just to have huge muscles and look good. That takes care of itself. Train so that your body works the way it would work if you were an animal that needed its fitness and health to survive, not a lazy sedentary urbanite, as so many of us sadly are. \n\nWhen doing this, really *geek out.* Take a week and read up everything you can before diving in. \n\n**Step 3:** Take up something that involves movement. Personally, I decided to take up a martial art and an \"art of movement\" sport. My martial art of choice was bujinkan ninjutsu since I'm a good fit for it, but your mileage may vary. For my sport, I took up parkour. There simply is nothing more breathtaking for me than watching professionals move the way our bodies *were designed to move*. \n\n(Yes, I said \"designed.\" No, I don't mean Designed. I meant evolved. Stop nit-picking.)\n\n**Step 4:** Do something mental too. This can be anything. I decided to do a lot more reading in all sorts of areas. Fiction to improve my linguistic skills in the languages I speak, including classics and contemporary; newspapers and non-fiction to get some breadth of knowledge about current events and modern history, that sort of thing.  \n\nSomeone here linked the Sequences of Less Wrong. Now this is the first time I've heard of them, but my God, it looks amazing at a first glance. I can't really recommend them, but if I was writing this for me, I'd put that down too. Check it out. \n\n**Step 5:** **P R O F I T**\n\nOther things: \n\n* I took up rock climbing in the last few months too. It's amazing. I only really took it up to improve my grip strength for parkour.\n* I took up juggling too in order to improve my hand-eye coordination and such. It's great! \n* Balance your physical and your mental exercises well. I should be doing more mental things, but after being in education and higher education my whole life and never doing any sports, ever, I'm sick of it and am overcompensating now, I guess. \n* Everything here has helped me find a cliché: inner peace. Really. It's fantastic and almost zen-like. Or some shit. :)\n\nI can probably think of a few more things, I'll edit my post if I do. \n\nGood luck to you. Most important: **don't waste it.** This is a tremendous opportunity for you. Have fun. \n\n**Edit:** The reason I say \"ignore anyone that tells you to join the gym\" is because you can do it all at home. I work out in my room, and it's a tiny room. Bodyweight training and some elastic resistance bands, a medicine ball, and some weighted vests all costs next to nothing, is easily portable, and can be used in so so so many different ways. You really don't need weights. And for God's sake, don't use machines.

{"body": "Well, it cant really compete with most of the other stories here, but I couldn’t  get that story of my mind for quite some time. \n\nIt was 3 years ago, I was in the 11th grade, and me and some friends went clubbing. We were at this party, great one, having the time of our life. I got there with about 10 friends, but in the end it was me and five others, two of them are really good friends, the other three were people I cant really stand being with. I kind of hated them back then, and really loathed them afterwards. So weve been drikin all night long, and we get out of the part at about 4AM, cheerful and stumbling toward some taco place, when on the way we see this girl, maybe year younger then us. We were 6, me and A B C D E, A AND B are my good friends, both of them are really good kids, people I know and cherish, \"men of stature\". And there is that girl, trippin toward her friends scooter, and ABCDE start harassing her. C D &amp; E are some twisted fucks, they \"flirt\" with her (and with flirt I mean talking some BS with her, about how to do a wheelie with the scooter when only one of them knows how to ride it) and then B joins, and A tries to avert B from join them. I forgot to mention that the girl isn't the driver, her friend with the scooter give her a ride, so her friends get their helmets out of the box and she put it on, BCDE tries stop her from getting on the scooter, starting touch her, first her arms, then throw their filthy hands at her chest, probably minutes from gang rape the poor girl. Make no mistake, that girl was totally drunk, couldn’t even keep her head upright, but she still was being harassed and she was aware to their behavior. She went to defensive position, and to be honest, she didn’t stood a chance. I ran toward her pushing CDE while A dragged B out of the scene, I then catched the girl and tried dragging her toward the scooter, it was quite dark, I m big and intimidating, and slapped  me on the face quite hard, trying to defend herself from her \"savior\". I got pissed, and knowing I m doing the right thing, I put my hand over her face, supported her back with my hand, and I make her drop flat on her back, very gently, and when CDE are shocked I leaned toward her \"holy fuck I m about to die\" face and said sharply but quietly: \"get up, go to your friends before those fucktards rape you, and be thankful\", she serioused the fuck up, and got away. A was preaching B, and CDE were laughing their ass of, with B joining them soon, each of them telling proudly how he \"grabbed her ass\" or \"groped her boob\", and I was about to kill them, when A calmed me and told me to let it pass. Week after I confronted B, and it turns out he was totally out and couldn’t remember a thing from that night, I beleved him as he was and still is a good kid, for CDE? Didn’t talk to them since, and I m pretty sure no only they remember that time, but also have it written down in their resume. \n\nMy story doesn’t consist of people dying. It doesn’t deal with terrible poverty, its got nothing to do with stupidity, forces of nature, or mental illness.

{"body": "You may be giving me more credit than I deserve. While it would be nice to pretend that the poem is meant to be an illusion to rain, it wasn't intended to be. I tried to write a short story about a homeless man that I see everyday and ended up with so many rhyming couplets that I gave up and started writing this poem. The first two stanzas came together sort of a a b c, d d e c so I decided to keep going with d d f c for the third (hence \"determinedly\", but I think I might try \"dejectedly\"?) The fourth stanza I wanted to keep the same to start, but then I wanted it to take off as your mind would if you imagined the man in different circumstances, and I think it does (e e then a couplet to end, which doesn't happen previously). That is why the final stanza is so jarring; I wanted it to be like a snap back to reality, utterly stopping any rhythm. \n\nAs far as belied goes, it's just that his bright coat has always struck me as out of place on him, and I don't know of another word that describes that?

{"body": "\"Mode\" is just a funny way of saying \"scale.\" Certainly don't get creeped out by the term \"mode.\" =)\n\nHere's my crappy explanation.\n\nThe C major scale runs like this: C D E F G A B C. Eight notes, one repetition, no sharps or flats. So, what do you call the same set of notes, with start and endpoints of D instead of C (D E F G A B C D)? Remember, it's the same notes (and thus the same fretboard geometry if you'd like to look at it that way) as the C major scale! \n\nTIME'S UP!\n\nThat's the second mode of the C major scale: the D Dorian mode. The first mode of the C major scale is the C major scale (also called Ionian mode). \n\nYou can repeat this pattern with all the notes in the scale: What's E F G A B C D E? The E Phrygian mode. \n\nThe modes are named like this for the C major scale... the start and endpoints change in every other key, but the order is always the same:\n\n1st - C to C - Ionian\n\n2nd - D to D - Dorian\n\n3rd - E to E - Phrygian \n\n4th - F to F - Lydian\n\n5th - G to G - Mixolydian\n\n6th - A to A - Aeolian\n\n7th - B to B - Locrian\n\n8th (repeat of 1st) - C to C - Ionian\n\nIn order to improv quickly along the major scalar modes, one needs to learn common fretboard geometry for each of these modes and apply them to whatever key the song you're playing happens to be in. \n\nFor extra credit, figure out what flavors of chords you get when you blend the 1st note, the 3rd note, the 5th note and the 7th note of each of the modes together, a technique called \"stacking thirds.\" The sounds are shockingly different for each mode, and you get cool chords like minor sevenths and diminisheds and dominates... all the good stuff.\n\nIf you learn all that stuff (and it really doesn't take long when you intuitively grasp the concepts), improv becomes much easier, and you can branch out into non-major modes... stuff like the harmonic minor, the penatonic modes, the whole-tone stuff... even bouncing modes off different positions to get different sounds (like playing an A Dorian over a C major chord construction to get a bit of a wonky sound).

Work up to 45-60 seconds per pitch. i.e sing all the vowels A E I O U at the pitch E for 60 seconds. Youtube videos showing diaphragm control will be invaluable here.

During the Iraq war drum thumping, I really wish I could have called the MF-er on the tripe HE helped to promote, just like Billdo and others. So, no. He is not my idol. He has my respect as long as he deserves it. Incidentally, I have not watched his show in over a year.\n\n\nFor the record, I do not have a blog. I do not work in any media related business. I do post comments at News Hounds and Think Progress, through their courtesy, and yes, once in a while I have the satisfaction of seeing some of my concepts accepted and repeated by others, but to me this is no amazing feat or discovery because the ideas are simple. I don't have to tell anyone the sun will rise in the East.\n\n\nI also have the satisfaction, and pat myself on the back for it, of looking at facts and developing situations then analyze them and formulate outcomes. Again, nothing amazing, since we all do this.\n\n\nI am sorry you, Cecelia and the Mark Koldys' mini-BU$HWIPES, have chosen to be on the wrong side of History. \n\n\nNot really.

{"body": "Packrat! Yes! Much better than the 'hoarder'-term I was going to use :) Funny how I have an stuffed apartment full of random disorganized stuff, and keep throwing stuff out, but stuff seems to come in at a higher rate than it goes out, so it builds up.

Which is rather disgusting once I think about it... And I did start deleting, but then I got 150 dvd discs, tossed the video collection on them, but then there was so much hard disc space free I had to fill it up with something right? And then that got full and I got this 1TB external drive... and rinse... repeat...  \nAt least Ive started gathering 'important' movies now, black and whites, culturally importants, documentaries and such. I think this is from my underlying assumption that one day our civilisation will collapse and all I will have left is what I have gathered for myself.
