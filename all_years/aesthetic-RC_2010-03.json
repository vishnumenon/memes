{"body": "                 HIMALAYAN CRYSTAL SALT\r\n                 GA R A M B U K I T TULIN\r\nHimalayan salt lamps are naturally formed powerful tools that can be used for relaxation and meditation with glowing hues of red, orange and amber Himalayan salt lamps are amazing, made from centuries old raw materials formed into lamps or candle holders can create a warm feeling in any room or office. That’s all well and good but how do salt lamps work?” Himalayan salt lamps affect different people in different ways; however the overwhelming response is that these salt rock lamps are helping people find peace. The color is naturally soothing as is a camp fire or a nice sunset and let’s not forget about the negative ions that are generated by the lamps as well. \r\nWhen the earth was still in the beginning stages of formation, massive pressures and colliding continents caused the Himalayan Mountains to form. Actually the ocean that existed at that time was forced inside what is now called the Himalayan Mountains. These vast Mineral salt deposits developed beneath the surface, and the mountainous pressure and mineral content created a perfect environment for these crystals to evolve. Himalayan salt lamps are not actually created by the mountains but by hand, without the use of nasty chemicals and other unnatural materials. Hand crafted natural products are what we suggest to any home and the energy they create is amazing but there is more to learn. \r\nWhat are your salt lamps used? They are great to help one ad natural component to a home or office. In Fact the color spectrum is known to have a positive effect on the human body. First and foremost, Salt lamps work in much the same way as the fresh ocean air works. The salt evaporation negatively changes oxygen molecules and helps to create a protective of cloud of relaxation. One needs to be able to tap into that energy and want do feel the difference. There are always those that don’t get the higher realms of thought or feeling but we do not worry about them as they will eventually get the opportunity to awaken or not. The places where one can place a lamp is almost endless and if one is thinking about a gift it is one that will last forever. \r\nFor decades Americans have been seeking relief from what ails them. Now with salt lamps you have a possible gift for some relief. The salt lamps act much like the salt caves do in Europe and other salt museums where people go below ground and stay overnight in the salt mines and have reported some profound relief regarding salt caves. \r\nOne might also ask how many salt lamps one needs; well we suggest strongly that one consider several as one for the bedroom, office and living area is a great to start!\r\nHimalayan Water and Salt  (Garam Bukit Tulin)\r\nThe human body is composed of water and salt. Natural Himalayan crystal salt contains all of the natural minerals and trace elements that make up the human body. Though vitamins and proteins are not found in water or salt, the elements that make up their complicated molecular chains are present in water and salt. In fact, water, salt and light are energy forms that construct highly geometrically structured chain links that are – biochemically – identical to vitamins and proteins. This is why sole, a mixture of water and salt, is such an important life-builder and worth incorporating into your daily life. One might consider sole as the equivalent of ‘liquid sunlight’ and obviously it relates to the ancient oceans from where we all came. \r\nWater and salt have different crystalline structures. 250 million years ago, light energy evaporated the primal oceans and created salt, which is essentially energy. When water is added the structure of salt changes and can easily penetrate the body’s cells allowing the potential of this energy to be released. \r\nThe atomic structure of salt is actually electrical which makes it so transformable. Salt does not need to be broken down into sugars or acids, it always remains salt. Salt allows information to travel between our cells and produces our actions and thoughts. A lack of salt is critical, similar to a modern-day power outage. At the same time crystal salt helps us remain balanced and in harmony with ourselves and surroundings. \r\nBasic table salt is only sodium chloride. It has been chemically stripped of all of the other elements and has no positive benefit. Many of us are accustomed to adding salt to ‘flavor’ our food. But the real importance of salt is its vibration pattern, and again, this is only found in crystal salt. Seek it out next time you want to purchase salt and avoid buying basic grocery store white table salt. \r\nHistoric Importance Throughout time, people have known about and valued the importance of salt. Many European cities are named after salt and the word ‘salary’ actually means payment by salt. The Celtic word for salt is ‘Hall’ and many towns and cities known for their salt deposits have the word ‘hall’ in their name. \r\n\r\nHimalayan Crystal Solay or Sole'\r\nSole or Solay the Himalayan Salt Elixir. A great natural way to help your body increase its own immune functions while providing essential nutrients. \r\nHimalayan salt provides a non toxic way to add nutrients and minerals to your body. Our salt is made or harvested by hand and is without pollutants. \r\nSole (so-lay), our crystal salt mixed with water is the called the elixir of life. The eroupeans use the word sole came from the word sol, which means the sun. So the brine solution is the fluid state of the sun or light energy. The theory is the salt being natural and the sun being a fine source of vitamin D combines to make a powerful drink we now call so lay. \r\n“Combine your mental and physical balance and one will achieve wellbeing”. This salt mixture system causes the molecules to be hydrolyzed. This brine solution creates an immediate and yet lasting vibration in the body. The natural energy pattern will help restore your natural functions and remove stubborn toxins. \r\nTo create your own sole, loosely fill a glass with several Himalayan crystal salts or several tablespoons of Himalayan Salt grains. Fill the glass with your favorite mountain spring water. Check if the crystals have been dissolved completely. If the crystals were dissolved, add some more crystal. The salt will stop dissolving when the mixture is correct in other words the salt finds its own balance and you will to. Now take one tablespoon of this mixture and ad to eight ounces of water every morning. You mind and body will thank you. \r\nWelcome to age old wisdom and the combining of natural health. \r\nMore Himalayan(Garam Bukit Tulin) Salt Lamps and More information coming soon.(we are the whole and retail saler and exporter)\r\n\r\nAJF ENTERPRISE\r\nJalan Genting Klang\r\n53300 Kuala Lumpur Malaysia\r\nTel: 0060341425326\r\n      0060123750983\r\n      0060193707520\r\n      ajf-entp@streamyx.com\r\n\r\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1267605780", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I a variation of them where I play four notes in progression, then three up:\n\nC D E F D E F G E F G A...\n\nC D E D E F E F G F G A...\n\nwith a metronome, if you want, too.\n\nEDIT: start the metronome as slow as you need to to play clean. You'll improve. AND, added bonus: you will have learned the two most important (IMHO - major and minor pentatonic) scales forms!\n\nI also do an A-bar chord form on each fret all the way up to about fret 14, because it's the hardest for me to play cleanly every time.\n\nTo me, it's maintaining pick-finger coordination and making sure my callouses don't go soft. But I can do the scales in just a few minutes.\n\n'Hope this helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1269273842", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1. You are young and don’t want health insurance? You are starting up a small business and need to minimize expenses, and one way to do that is to forego health insurance? Tough. You have to pay $750 annually for the “privilege.” (Section 1501)\n\n2. You are young and healthy and want to pay for insurance that reflects that status? Tough. You’ll have to pay for premiums that cover not only you, but also the guy who smokes three packs a day, drink a gallon of whiskey and eats chicken fat off the floor. That’s because insurance companies will no longer be able to underwrite on the basis of a person’s health status. (Section 2701).\n\n3. You would like to pay less in premiums by buying insurance with lifetime or annual limits on coverage? Tough. Health insurers will no longer be able to offer such policies, even if that is what customers prefer. (Section 2711).\n\n4. Think you’d like a policy that is cheaper because it doesn’t cover preventive care or requires cost-sharing for such care? Tough. Health insurers will no longer be able to offer policies that do not cover preventive services or offer them with cost-sharing, even if that’s what the customer wants. (Section 2712).\n\n5. You are an employer and you would like to offer coverage that doesn’t allow your employers’ slacker children to stay on the policy until age 26? Tough. (Section 2714).\n\n6. You must buy a policy that covers ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services; chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.\n\nYou’re a single guy without children?

{"body": "This is from Practical Programming and sounds like what you're going through:  \n\nCycling lacks a significant eccentric component—a \"negative\"\nmovement. All eccentric contraction, one in which the muscle\nlengthens under a load, occurs in most slow barbell movements, since\nlowering the weight is an integral part of most exercises (this is not\nnecessarily true of the O l y m p i c lifts, which modern equipment allows\nto be done in a concentric-only fashion: we can now drop our snatches,\ncleans, and jerks without tearing up the weight room). Cycling has no\nequivalent loading pattern, since a correct pedal stroke either pushes\ndown or pulls up. Never i s the pedal resisted eccentrically. So the\neccentric phase of the contraction, and the ability of the muscle to\nlengthen under load, remains untrained. A d d to this the fact that\ncycling utilizes a limited range of motion, one that never approaches\nthe extent of that used in a full squat. A cyclist very well may be\nstrong enough concentrically to come up from the bottom of a deep\nsquat, even without ever having lowered a weight that far. He is\ntherefore in the position of being quite capable of pushing a weight\nthat is relatively heavy for an untrained lifter up from the bottom of\nthe squat and completely unadapted to carrying it down.  \n\nIt is widely recognized that the eccentric phase of a resistance\nexercise is the part of the movement that produces the majority of the\nsoreness associated with training. A cyclist is unadapted to eccentric\ncontraction but able to generate high concentric force. Extreme care\nmust be used when training these athletes, lest they be crippled by\nsoreness from squatting weights they appear to handle easily. Coaches\nshould recognize the need for light workouts at first, and although this\nmay lead motivated cyclists to become frustrated with the seeming\nineffectiveness of the barbell program, it is necessary. These problems\nmay also be the reason many cyclists fail to stick with weight training\nas part of their sport preparation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1269645064", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
