{"body": "Three gripes:\n\n1. Controlled character dies = game over. What the fuck. This bothers me about the persona games as well, but it's even worse here because there's no \"main protagonist\". Arbitrary member of your group keels over, even if you have 99 revive items in your bag, the game flashes to game over screen. Bad design.\n\n2. Every battle in the game has the exact same flow. Plink plink plink until stagger, L1 -&gt; ATK/BLA/BLA, press X X X X X for 20 seconds, repeat. It required me playing WoW to see how utterly *boring* the design of encounters in most games are. Hate on WoW if you like, but you have to respect that they actually sat down their design people and burned significant calories on thinking about \"okay, what would be a cool twist to add to an encounter?\" or \"how can we iterate an existing encounter to get something more interesting?\" By contrast, the S-E designers seemed to be more focused on visual design, like \"woah, what he had a fucking FOOT instead of an eye, and he was actually like, a giant floating clock that constantly dripped blood.\"\n\n3. I've had this beef with every FF battle system labeled \"ATB\". There is this completely arbitrary lag between the time you decided to input your command and when your command actually executes. You've already waited 10 seconds for that fucking bar to fill up, now you randomly wait another 1~10 seconds while lightning slowly paces back and forth in her ready animation. It's not like the enemies are attacking during this time period, either. It's just... dead air. Oh, and the part where it takes her 5 seconds to run over, 1/4 of a second to slash, and 5 more seconds to run back is awesome. To me, it feels the same as playing an online game with ~400 ping. There's that same feeling of constant bewilderment as to what is happening.

You can do pretty reasonable \"fake\" versions of Canon in D and Ode to Joy.  Search around youtube, err on the side of easy.  \n\nJust sort of finger-picking this progression: D A Bm F#m G D G A will get you close to Canon.  Ode to Joy can be played with either single notes or a country-style finger-picked pattern.  It's mostly C and G.  Also, avoiding classical music can work too.

{"body": "Let's use the key of C-major as an example. The \"7 notes\" vph is talking about are the collection of notes in a particular key. Many western pop songs are in a major key, and only use notes within that key.\n\nFor note names, we use:\n\n* C D E F G A B\n\nThat's 7. Plus, there are flats and sharps, which are in between these notes. C-sharp is the same as D-flat, for example. There's no B-sharp or E-sharp, so that gives us a total of those 12 semitones vph was talking about. But since we're thinking in C-major, we're only using those 7 notes listed above.\n\nTo keep it simple, 3-note chords consist of a root note and two other notes above it. To find those two notes, count every other note up from the root. So a C-major chord consists of:\n\n* C   E   G\n\nIf we're in the key of C-major, the C chord is based on the 1st note of the scale, so we call it a I chord. Using Roman numerals allow us to refer to the relationships between chords without worrying about the specific key. A basic I-V-vi-IV (don't worry about the lowercase for now) chord progression (like the one from the video) in C-major would consist of the following notes, chord-by-chord:\n\n* I - C E G\n* V - G B D\n* vi - A C E\n* IV - F A C\n\nAs vph pointed out, all the notes in the key are covered by these 4 chords, and they fit well together.

{"body": "Part II\n\nSoon the subject becomes more *modern*.\n\nWe call the rectangular array of numbers, in m rows and n columns,\n\n     a(1,1) a(1,2) ... a(1,n)\n     a(2,1) a(2,2) ... a(2,n)\n          ...\n\n     a(m,1) a(m,2) ... a(m,n)\n\nan m x n (m *by* n) *matrix*.  The usual notation is A = [a(i,j)].  Each a(i,j) is a *component* of matrix A.\n\nIf matrix A is m x n and m = n, then (no big surprise) A is *square*.\n\nWhy a *matrix*?  There are many reasons, some more clear below, but just for solving equations it is the components of matrix A that are the real central players in the work.  So, we have some notation for just those components.\n\nIf matrix A has only one row, then we can say that A is a *row vector*; if A has only one column, then we can say that it is a *column vector*.\n\nGenerally we will write x = (x(1), x(2), ..., x(n)) to indicate that x is a column vector.  Right:  We type something that looks like a row but, from the outer parentheses we agree that we are defining a column; this is because it is clumsy to type columns and mostly in this subject we are more interested in column vectors than row vectors.\n\nYes from early in computing Fortran has *arrays* good for A and x, and arrays have remained popular in programming languages.\n\nFor the sake of definiteness, let's assume that the numbers we are using are the reals, that is, the set R. Then we say that x = (x(1), x(2), ..., x(n)) is a *vector* in R^n.\n\nSimilarly b = (b(1), b(2), ..., b(m)) is a vector in R^m.\n\nThen we define the *matrix product* Ax so that we get just Ax = b as in the simultaneous equations.  So, Ax = b is, so far, just simpler notation for the m equations in n unknowns.  That is, matrix product Ax is defined so that Ax = b is just the same as the simultaneous equations above.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nFor real number c, we define the *scalar product* cA = [ca(i,j)].  So, we just take each component of A, multiply it by scalar c, and get cA.  Simple.\n\nIf we also have m x n D = [d(i,j)], then we define *matrix addition* by A + D = [a(i,j) + d(i,j)].  So, we just add corresponding components of A and D and get the corresponding components of A + D. Simple.\n\nSimilarly, for x and y in R^n and u and v in R.  So, we can write ux + vy.\n\nThen we notice easily that\n\n     A(ux + vy) = u(Ax) + v(Ay)\n\nSo, we say that A is *linear*.  This linearity is the main fact that drives the whole subject.  More generally, as in\n\nGeorge F. Simmons, *Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis,* McGraw Hill, New York.\n\na beautifully written book, but a bit advanced, the two most important pillars of *mathematical analysis* are *continuity* and *linearity*.  Here we see a case of linearity.  For more, in calculus, with meager assumptions, both differentiation and integration are linear.  In both pure and applied mathematics, linearity is a **very** big deal, the key to much of the power (money, fame, co-eds, etc.!).\n\nThe real world is just awash in systems that are linear or nearly so -- small mechanical vibrations, transmission of audio and electro-magnetic signals, many operations in finance, and more.\n\nFor m x n A = [a(i,j)] let's let [a(*,j)] be column j from the matrix, that is, the column vector (a(1,j), a(2,j), ..., a(m,j)).\n\nSuppose D = [d(i,j)] is n x p. Then we define the *matrix product* AD to be the m x p matrix where column j is the matrix product A[d(*,j)].  That is, to get column j of the product AD, we just take column j of D and multiply it as we learned in Ax = b above.  So, A is m x n and D is n x p and the product AD is m x p. So, for the matrix product AD to be defined, the number of columns of A has to be the same as the number of rows of D, and the result is m x p so that the n gets lost; note that.\n\nIf the matrix product A(DF) is defined (that is, the number of columns of A = the number of rows of D and the number of columns of D is equal to the number of rows of F), then the matrix product (AD)F is also defined and we have\n\n     A(DF) = (AD)F\n\nThat is, matrix product is associative. **VERY** cute, and sometimes enough to get results difficult to see otherwise.\n\nIs matrix product *commutative*, that is, is AD = DA?  In general, no.  Intuitively, usually not even close!  First, A and D would both have to be square with the same number of rows even for the products to be defined.  Second, even if the products are defines, they need not be equal.  This is one of the first, important places where a math student sees commutativity fail.\n\nWe now have the essential definitions of *matrix algebra*.  We can easily show some distributive laws, etc.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1271800823", "subreddit": "science", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Part III\n\nIn Ax = b, we notice that x is in R^n and b is in R^m.  So, Ax is a function (mapping, transformation) from R^n into R^m.  This is a **big** deal:  Indeed, the modern approach really is just to study matrix A as such a function.\n\nSo, let's say more about what R^n is:  To jump right to the good stuff, R^n is a finite dimensional vector space with dimension n just in the classic\n\nPaul R. Halmos, *Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces, Second Edition,* D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nThere's more good stuff, but here we can just outline coming wonders:\n\n* **Completeness.**  Consider the rational numbers and construct a sequence that gets as close as we please to, say, the square root of 2 (or pi -- there are infinitely many such choices).  Well the sequence does not *converge* in the rationals because there is nothing there in the rationals for the sequence to converge to because the square root of 2 is not a rational.  But, if do the same in the reals, then the sequence does converge.  So, the reals are *complete* -- no holes, no gaps, no missing points.  A sequence that *appears* to converge (*Cauchy* convergence) really does converge because there is something there to converge to.\n\n* **Banach space.**  If we have a vector space, a definition of distance called a *norm*, and the vector space is complete with this norm, then we have, in the usual wording, a *complete, normed linear space*, that is a *Banach* space.  Yes, named after Stefan Banach; yes, in Wikipedia.  Yes, there is an obvious norm for R^n so that it is a Banach space.  A Banach space is not such a nice place to be because you are not given very much to work with.  But there are some important examples, and there are about a dozen or so general results that are surprising and powerful.  If have a Banach space problem, then look at the results and see if they solve your problem.\n\n* **Hilbert Space.**  A *complete, inner product space* is a *Hilbert space*.  Yes, named after David Hilbert, also in Wikipedia.  We define an inner product below.  The inner product in a *natural* way defines a norm, and a Hilbert space is complete in this norm.  So, yes, easily R^n is a Hilbert space.  Some of the examples of a Hilbert space are astounding:  That they actually are a Hilbert space is nearly beyond belief.  A Hilbert space is a nice place to be; can do a **lot**.  The more important Hilbert spaces are infinite dimensional, not finite dimensional.  Really the goal of Halmos's book is to cover R^n but as if it were **just** a Hilbert space, that is, mostly ignoring that R^n is finite dimensional.\n\nBack to the main discussion:\n\nUh, what's a *vector space*?  Yup, given undefined terminology, you **should** ask!\n\nThere are some axioms:\n\nFirst, we have to specify a field. that is, the real, complex, rational, ..., numbers.  The most common choice is the reals.  For some applications (e.g., signals in electronic engineering, a lot in physics), the complex numbers are crucial.  For some theoretical studies of the numerical computations, we like the rational numbers.  Parts of coding theory and parts of advanced pure mathematics pick finite fields.\n\nSecond we have to specify a non-empty set, say, V of *vectors*.  Suppose a, b, c are in the field (call them *scalars*) and x, y, z are vectors.  The axioms:\n\n* We can multiply a times x and get ax, also a vector.\n\n* We have a kind of associativity a(bx) = (ab)x.\n\n* We have  1x = x.\n\n* We can add vectors, say, x + y, also a vector, and then we have commutativity x + y = y + x.\n\n* Also addition is associative:  (x + y) + z = x + (y + z), and we have a kind of distributivity a(x + y) = ax + ay.\n\n* We also have another kind of distributivity (a + b)x = ax + bx.\n\n* We have a special vector 0, and x + 0 = x.\n\n* Also for the scalar 0, 0x is the vector 0. So, (-1)x + 1x = 0x = 0.\n\nWith these axioms, set V is a *vector space* over field F.\n\nYup, R^n is a vector space over the field R.\n\nThe axioms are sometimes useful:  E.g., once we learn a little more about dimension, we see that R^n has dimension n and that the line is R^1 with dimension 1, the plane is R^2 of dimension 2, and at least locally, at the macro scale, it appears that we live in R^3 of dimension 3.\n\nThen it is easy to prove that if a vector space V over a field F has finite dimension n, then V is essentially **just** the same as F^n.\n\nNice.\n\nBut in a vector space, we can have a set of vectors that is also a vector space, according to the axioms.  In this case we have a vector *subspace*, and in practice it is usually much less than the whole space.  One of the more important examples, for m x n A, x in R^n, and b in R^m, is\n\n     K = { x | Ax = 0 }\n\nThat is, K is the set of vectors in R^n that matrix A maps onto the 0 vector in R^m.  Then it it is easy to show that K is a vector subspace of R^n, that is, K satisfies the axioms.  Subspace K is the *kernel* of A.\n\nWhat can we do with the kernel?  If we have some y so that Ay = b, then we can use the kernel K to characterize all the solutions to Ax = b:\n\n     { x | Ax = b } = y + K = { y + z | z in K }\n\nThat is, just take the kernel K, for each vector z in K add y to it, and get exactly the set of solutions to Ax = b.\n\nWe do something essentially the same in linear ordinary differential equations where the general solution is the sum of a particular solution and a solution to the homogeneous problem.\n\nThis stuff about *vector spaces* is an abstraction of a **lot** that was already known from many examples by year 1900, 1930, etc.  So, do the derivations once for vector spaces and apply them many times.  Also guess, correctly, that will find many other applications of vector spaces after year 1930.\n\nSo, a student of linear algebra can work with a vector space V just from the axioms or a vector space R^n, and sometimes they are the same thing.\n\n*Matrix theory* is working just with matrices as in Ax = b.  *Linear algebra* is usually closer to doing essentially the same thing but for vector spaces.\n\nGiven x, y in R^n, we define their *inner product* as\n\n     (x,y) = x(1)y(1) + x(2)y(2) + ... + x(n)y(n)\n\nPure and applied math are awash in such sums of products, and this fact helps make this inner product more important.\n\nThe inner product is profound:  From it we can get lengths and angles, orthogonality, orthogonal coordinate systems, orthogonal projections, do closest approximations, etc.  Such inner products are the main step in most of multivariate statistics.\n\nThe definition of an *inner product* for a vector space V over the reals R is, for x, y in V, (x,y) and has properties:\n\n* (x,y) in R\n\n* (x,y) = (y,x)\n\n* (x,y) is a linear function of y (a big deal)\n\n* (x,x) &gt;= 0\n\n* (x,x) = 0 if and only if x = 0\n\nWe regard (x,x) as the square of the *length* of x.  Vectors x, y are *orthogonal* provided (x,y) = 0.\n\nYes, the Fourier coefficients are inner products, and Fourier theory is using inner products to project onto orthogonal axes.  The axes are from the sines and cosines at the fundamental and overtone frequencies.\n\nYes, if X and Y are real valued random variables, then with meager assumptions E[XY] is an inner product.\n\nIn electronic engineering, the signals are usually best regarded as points in a vector space.  Then, yup, usually a transmission line is accurately a linear function for a wide range of signals.\n\nThen, if send a signal over a communications channel and the channel corrupts the signal by adding on some random noise vector, to have the resulting signals be separate at the receiver, have to have the signals far enough apart at the sender.  Tap lightly and get Shannon's information theory on the maximum error-free bandwidth of a noisy communications channel.  Application:  Can't get bandwidth of 1 million bits per second on an old voice grade phone line.  Part of the geometry is how many little balls will fit into a big ball, the big ball determined by the power being used to send the signal.\n\nSoon we are into Hilbert space theory, e.g., for quantum mechanics.\n\nAlso with a little less in assumptions, we are into Banach space theory.\n\nSuppose m = n and consider Ax = y.  What happens geometrically?  It's simple:  There are n x n Q and S so that A = SQ. Matrix Q is *orthogonal* and changes no lengths:  The length of Qx is the same as that of x.  Matrix S is symmetric, non-negative semi-definite and only changes circles into ellipses.\n\nSo, in Ax, first Qx rotates and/or reflects x.  Then S just takes the result and changes it by changing the lengths of some orthogonal axes.\n\nAx = b has exactly one solution if and only if none of the orthogonal axes of S goes to zero.\n\nFor the orthogonal axes, we consider scalars a and vectors x so that Sx = ax.  So for such an x, all S does to it is change its length.  Such an x is called an *eigenvector* (from the German where *eigen* means special or particular, maybe singular), and the a is its corresponding *eigenvalue*.  A big deal is that the S has n mutually orthogonal eigenvectors, and they are the axes where S changes length.\n\nThis result is the *polar decomposition* and is likely the most important result in the subject.\n\nMight guess that in effect the eigenvectors of the larger eigenvalues of S are the \"29 dimensions of compatibility\" of one matchmaking service.\n\nIn the case of the field of scalars being the complex numbers, get A = HU where U is unitary and H Hermitian.  Hermitian operators are central in quantum mechanics.\n\nIn a time invariant linear signal processing system, e.g., a transmission line, the complex exponentials, functions of time, t,\n\n     exp(iwt) = cos(wt) + i sin(wt)\n\nare eigenvectors.\n\nThe subject of *functional analysis* does more on vector valued functions of vectors.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1271800888", "subreddit": "science", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "The bucket example doesn't necessarily require gravity, per se...\n\nBut you're not nitpicking, you're asking \"Why\".   And I think *that* is an excellent question.   I would agree that science doesn't really address the question of why.   Science can (theoretically) allow us to explain what, when, where and how the universe started &amp; evolved and the amazing complexity we observe now.   But it cannot answer \"why\".    That question is left to the philosophers (and devout).\n\nMy position, and I cannot prove it, is that there is no why.   I believe that the universe is purposeless and without meaning beyond what we bring to it by our experiences.    And no, I don't find that cold and lonely.   The universe is an amazing place and my heart fills with joy to experience and struggle to understand it.\n\nI can understand why some people would be very uncomfortable with something as awesome and mind boggling as the universe to be without a cause/intent/purpose/meaning, without a \"why\".    After all, everything else we experience has something causing the \"why\".     So when you have that chain of causality, why - because of this, because of that, because of the other, and so on back until the ultimate \"why\" is \"because the universe exists\" and then to have to believe the universe exists for no specific reason -- well, I can understand that doesn't make sense for some people.\n\nI still thing they're wrong.\n\nI would argue that not only is there no reason to need a \"why\", it's one of those nonsensical questions - like Schroedinger's cat.   It's the wrong question.    I may even go so far as to invoke Godel and suggest that the \"why\" of the universe is one of those things that is outside the system - a proposition that is true, but unprovable.\n\nAnd if I make take a short digression on the coin tossing point - if you toss a coin 6 times in a row, one possible outcome will be: H H T T H T.   That's one of the 64 possible outcomes.   There was a 1 in 64 chance of that happening.   Looking back in hindsight doesn't mean it was an amazing coincidence, it just means that of all the possible things that could of happened, that one did.   It is no more special than any other outcome.    Applying probability assessments to stuff that already happened is nonsensical and an illusion.    It's like walking down a beach, picking up a grain of sand and saying, \"Wow!  What are the odds I picked that exact grain.\"   There was no grand design, it was random chance and just because it was one in a billion, doesn't make it special.\n\nP.S. Please don't tell anyone we're having a reasonable rational discussion - my understanding is that such things are rarely permitted on the internets.\n\n\n\n**tl;dr** - No, \"why\".   Why?

However, I think I'll restart it when a version of 2010 is released for linux.\n\nThe basic grid has rooms that are 13x13 with 8 workshops each.  The center has an up/down stairway:\n    ╔═════O O═════╗\n    ║             ║\n    ║ XXX XXX XXX ║\n    ║ XXX XXX XXX ║\n    ║ XXX XXX XXX ║\n    ║             ║\n    O XXX O O XXX O\n      XXX ║X║ XXX \n    O XXX ╚═╝ XXX O\n    ║             ║\n    ║ XXX XXX XXX ║\n    ║ XXX XXX XXX ║\n    ║ XXX XXX XXX ║\n    ║             ║\n    ╚═════O O═════╝\n\nThen each of these rooms are duplicated as follows:\n\n      S           S\n    S H H H H H H H S\n      H X X H X X H\n      H X X H X X H\n      H H H H H H H\n      H X X H X X H\n      H X X H X X H\n    S H H H H H H H S\n      S           S\n\nThe Xs are the rooms, Hs are the hallways (4 tiles wide), and Ss are the large staircases.  The rooms have double thickness walls to increase the value of the fortress due to smoothed walls.\n\nEach floor is more or less a copy of this, with the exception of the dining area (3 Z-levels high), bazaar, and quarters.  Stockpiles are one floor below workshops, finished goods are one above, so there is a natural progression of goods upward from the mines toward the bazaar/trading post.\n\nThere are two gates, the gate to the above ground entrance, and the entrance to the mines.  Each is more or less identical with double drawbridges and barracks with fortifications to allow firing upon enemies.\n\nAnd the best part:  the entire fortress is disconnected from the surrounding rock by a 4 tile wide gap running from the topmost level to the bottom.  Imagine a cube in a hollowed out area underground, connected only by drawbridges and a single covering layer on top and a few pillars on the bottom.  The lowest level is a large cistern.\n\nOnce I restart with 2010, I'll make minor modifications.  I have more than 16 Z-levels to work with, so I'll probably double the size of the dining hall vertically and make more ornate areas for the nobles.  I also want to add more systematic dump chutes and a drainage system to protect against accidental flooding.

{"body": "Let me repost something I wrote on superuser some time ago. I hope it helps you :)\n\n\n&gt;Most of the snippets online fail to explain the **how** and only state the **why**. Here's what you need to know about the synaptics driver:\n\n&gt;1. The driver detects pressure, width of the touch zone, and number of fingers.\n&gt;2. Not all devices, however, clearly state that there multiple fingers on the touchpad. Sometimes, they either claim an extremely high pressure or unusually wide touch zone.\n&gt;3. Synaptics is a wonderful driver and can deal with those misbehaving devices.\n\n&gt;In particular, the command `synclient -m 0` will start a very useful tool that lists realtime output of the driver (you're going to need SHMConfig defined in one way or another for this to work). The output would look like this:\n\n&gt;      time     x    y   z f  w  l r u d m     multi  gl gm gr gdx gdy\n&gt;     0.000     1 5855   0 0  0  0 0 0 0 0  00000000   0  0  0   0   0\n&gt;     1.465  2562 2450  10 1  5  0 0 0 0 0  00000000   0  0  0   0   0\n\n&gt;You're interested in the **z** (pressure), **f** (number of fingers), and **w** (width of touch zone) columns.\n\n&gt;Play with the touchpad a bit to figure out how (if at all) it represents multiple fingers. In my case, I get higher than usual W values (&gt;7 for multiple fingers). \n\n&gt;Now, luckily, the synaptics devs are smart people and have included the directives `EmulateTwoFingerMinW` and `EmulateTwoFingerMinZ` which should be self-explanatory - one treats all touches with W greater than a certain value as two fingers while the other does the same for the Z value.\n\n&gt;Adding one of these to the hal policy, however, will not fix things. The GNOME devs, in their infinite wisdom, decided that [gnome-settings-daemon should rewrite all touchpad settings](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=598820). Therefore, I resorted to having a script full of `synclient` commands run as part of the GNOME session (I added it to `Preferences-&gt;Startup Applications`).\n\n&gt;Below is part of my script to help you start. Save it anywhere, add +x to the permissions and add it to your session. You might have to rerun it after a suspend or hibernate.\n\n&gt;     #!/bin/bash\n&gt;     export DISPLAY=:0.0\n&gt;    \n&gt;     synclient EmulateTwoFingerMinZ=0\n&gt;     synclient EmulateTwoFingerMinW=6\n&gt;     synclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\n&gt;     synclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=1\n&gt;     synclient VertScrollDelta=75\n&gt;     synclient HorizScrollDelta=100\n\n&gt;In conclusion, learn `synclient` (through `man synaptics`) and ignore outdated advice on the Internet.\n\nP.S.

With a bit less tracking it could even be used to create a premium golf clothing line of its own.
