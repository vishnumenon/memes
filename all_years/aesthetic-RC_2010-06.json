{"body": "What I mean by out of tune is that the guitar sounded out of tune with itself.  Standard tuning is E A D G B E.  If one or more of the strings is not tuned to the exact note (E A D G B or E) then the guitar doesn't sound right (out of tune).  In your case it may be a consequence of using a capo that high up on the neck.  If the neck on your guitar is warped or the frets not aligned properly, putting on a capo will exacerbate potential tuning problems.  That is actually one way to test a new guitar before you buy it; place a capo on, say, the 7th fret and see how it sounds. Is it in tune and buzz free?  If so, the neck is straight and frets arranged properly.\nWhat kind of guitar are you playing (brand)?  It is a classical (nylon strings), is it not?  Classical guitars can be great fun but lack versatility.    Guitars can be very fickle instruments and are, to some extent, the type of instrument where \"you get what you pay for,\" but there are some great steel string acoustics around the $250-$300 range.\nIf you need help with anything let me know.
