{"body": "&gt; I am so fucking sick and tired of this logic. THIS is pure fanboy logic, through and through. No matter how the show ended, no matter what Darlton and the crew threw at you, you're the kind of person who would justify it.\n\nI'm not sure how to argue with this, since I made no such comment.  There are ways to tell a story, and in most, the viewer/reader is omnipotent - we get to hear the private thoughts of characters, see their motives that are hidden from the others, and see connections that are not visible or obvious to the characters.  Another method is first person, where we are experiencing the events as a particular character, or being told directly by the character experiencing it.\n\nBut L O S T presented the story in a manner where we were both third person and semi-omnipotent.  Most of what happened on-island, we were on the beach experiencing it with the characters.  Off-island, we were more of an omnipotent voyeur seeing their past.\n\nI never suggested we drive the plot - simply that the story was presented to us in much the same manner as the characters experienced it.  The fucking title of the show was LOST for instance, but it sounds like you wish it was called FOUND.\n\nIt's not that it's convenient to recognize how the story was shared, it's simply how it is.  Nothing that wasn't explained was absolutely crucial to the telling of the story.  I'll never know what series of coincidences delayed me from going through an intersection by a few seconds, thereby missing getting t-boned by an asshole running a very stale red light yesterday, but it happened nonetheless.  It's interesting to reflect and think about what prevented me from writing this post from a hospital bed, but the reality is probably extremely mundane.\n\nThe STORY ended just fine - the hero vanquished evil and saved the world.  You feel screwed over because you didn't get all the details filled in that you wanted.  Neither did any character in that show.  When the curtain was pulled back, everyone had mysteries that would never be told to them.  Does it really make a difference to the saving of the world that the statue had 4 toes?

{"body": "Chords within a particular key generally sound good together. I will explain this for a major key, but other keys follow similarly.\n\nA major key is created by starting with all of our [notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note).\nA A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# ... etc.\nThe (pitch) distance between each of these is called a half-step (or a semitone), and they loop around in either direction. Note that there are no sharps between B and C; and E and F (these notes are a half-step apart). The cool thing about guitar is that each fret is actually a semitone/half-step! So if you start with the open bottom string E, and place your finger on the 1st fret you are then playing an F!\n\nNow that we have our notes, we follow a pattern of whole (W) and half (H) steps, each half step being a fret on your guitar, and a whole step consisting of two half steps. This pattern is WWHWWWH. Starting on the note C and following this pattern will give you the following notes for the key of C major:\n\nC - whole step (2 frets) - D - whole step (2 frets) - E - half step (1 fret) - F - ...\n\nor (the ones in bold)\n\n**C** C# **D** D# **E** **F** F# **G** G# **A** A# **B**\n\nSo we end up with the following notes in the key of C major : CDEFGABC, and we dismiss the notes C#, D#, and all of the other ones we skipped over.\n\nBased on this collection of notes, you can build chords, by considering them as a sequence, and taking the 1st, 3d and 5th note. For example, we can start on the C, and get:\n\n1st : C 3d : E 5th : G. (see how this is the 1, 3 and 5 of **C**D**E**F**G**AB?) Which is the Cmaj chord. Also, since C is the first note of the key of C major we call this the I (roman numeral 1) chord for the key of C major.\n\nWe can also do this starting on other notes in the key. For example, starting on the A (and looping around to C when we get to the end), we get:\n\n1st : A 3d : C 5th : E. (**C**D**E**FG**A**B)Which is an A minor chord (an Amaj would have a C#), and since A is the 6th note in the key of C major, we call this the vi (roman numeral 6) chord for that key. We also make the roman numeral lower case because this happens to be a minor chord.\n\nYou can do the same thing starting with G, and see that a G major chord is the V (major roman numeral 5) chord of the key of C.\n\nBuilding a chord in a similar way for each tone, you will discover that this process will give you the same sequence of major, minor, and diminished chords for every major key:\n\nI ii iii IV V vi viidim I\n\nIn other words, the chord built on the first note will be major, the one built on the second will be minor, etc.\n\nSo Am, C and G are the vi, I and V chords of the key of C major. Some other chords that you might try in your progressions in this key would be d min(ii), e min(iii), F Maj(IV) and b dim(vii-dim).\n\nOf course, if you try playing them randomly you might find that your results are not as pleasant sounding... there is a further, very vast, science to constructing pleasant sounding chord progressions... but I think that would be too much for one post. Simply try different sequences, like I IV V I, or ii V I, or I I I I - IV IV I I - V IV I V... and make up your own through experimentation! Also try finding the chords of other keys. G major is pretty easy to start with, and then you'll get the idea.\n\nedit: hopefully a bit more explanation in the beginning made this more clear.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1278822889", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 42, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can also try those loofah gloves for exfoliation -- they feel a little softer than sandpaper but have the advantage of being a glove that you can teasingly stroke his cock/balls with, play with his nipples, or even give him a spanking with. I like to contrast that with a piece of rabbit or faux fur from the craft store across the same spot I just abraded -- rough then soft then rough again.\n\nOh, and speaking of gloves -- try experimenting with the sensations of lube and a latex glove, too. The unlubed glove feels softer in a way than skin, but also cool and absolutely smooth, and after you get tired of teasing him with that sensation, lube up the glove and *S L O W L Y* stroke him almost to orgasm and then back off, again and again. I guarantee that with some practice, you'll be able to stretch it out until he's so sensitive he'll cum from a single finger stroke.\n\nEditing again for another glove idea: around Halloween, look for cheap costume gloves at places like WalMart and Target, esp. the day after Halloween. Look for velvet opera gloves, those little lacy fingerless gloves, witchy spiderweb gloves, fishnet gloves -- you can usually get them really cheap, and they all offer new and interesting sensations when you use them for stroking, handjobs, anything you can think of.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1278994764", "subreddit": "BDSMcommunity", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As an elementary school music teacher it makes me sad to think these things push kids away from music...that's obviously the opposite of what I'm trying to do, but I am required to teach recorder. While I wholeheartedly agree that the recorder can sound REALLY annoying (hey I have to hear it all day), the idea is that the fingerings for the recorder are fundamentally similar and in some cases the same as other woodwind instruments such as the clarinet, flute, saxophones, oboe, bassoon, etc. That is the primary reason people started using the thing, just an FYI...not sure if that is widely known.  \n\nThe recorder really sucks because it is waaaaay too easy to blow too hard, thus causing the note to jump the octave and create a sound that cuts right into your very soul. However, as the teacher, if you make it a point to describe how to play it correctly (SOFTER DAMN YOU!! ETC), then it is much more tolerable and even somewhat pleasant at times.  \n\nLastly, the repertoire typically played is so antiquated it makes me want to vomit. Hot crossed buns, AGAIN? Basically, the idea is to show the notes G A B C D and that's it...often times just G A B. So, I found a show this guy made called BAGAPALOOZA (B A G...get it?) and it's actually pretty decent backing tracks...rock songs complete with solos, funky songs, latin songs, r&amp;b songs...etc. So the kids still learn the right notes, but the songs aren't nearly as stupid. Often times I'll have to tell the kids to stop bobbing their heads to the music because they'll actually get into it.  \n\nBy the way, I'd start a guitar program instead if I could get the funding.  \n\nI'm interested in your comments so I can make my program as tolerable as possible. Give me your qualms with my statements and horror stories! \n\n**tl;dr** - I teach recorder as an elementary music teacher. Yes, it sucks and I totally agree. Reason it is used = similar fingerings to other more used instruments, yet much easier. Sucks b/c it is too easy to get that shriek sound, but if you train kids to not do that it isn't terrible.

Calling memcpy from Haskell is as standard as calling it from C++. Both are FFI mechanisms into C.\r\n\r\nEither Haskell isn't memory safe or that isn't Haskell. You choose.\r\n\r\n&gt; http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/ndp/ndpslides.pdf\r\n\r\nYour link only gives the following code implementing the bastardized fake quicksort algorithm you guys promote because it is all Haskell seems capable of doing:\r\n\r\n    sort :: [:Float:] -&gt; [:Float:]\r\n    sort a = if (length a &lt;= 1) then a\r\n             else sa!0 +++ eq +++sa!1\r\n      where\r\n        m = a!0\r\n        lt = [: f | f&lt;-a, f&lt;m :]\r\n        eq = [: f | f&lt;-a, f==m :]\r\n        gr = [: f | f&lt;-a, f&gt;m :]\r\n        sa = [: sort a | a &lt;-[:lt,gr:] :]\r\n\r\nSo I ask again: Where is there a parallel generic quicksort in Haskell? Why have you not translated the code I have given you at least twice now?\r\n\r\nI have posed this simple challenge many times before over the past few years. You, Ganesh Sittampalam and all the other Haskell fanboys always respond only with words describing how easily you could do it in theory but never ever with working code. How do you explain that fact?\r\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1279629531", "subreddit": "coding", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, there are three basic minor scales: Natural, Melodic, and Harmonic.\n\nLet's use A Minor as an easy example...\n\nA Natural Minor scale:\n\nA B C D E F G A up  \nA G F E D C B A down\n\nA Melodic Minor scale:\n\nA B C D E F# G# A up  \nA G F E D C B A down  \n\nA Harmonic Minor scale:\n\nA B C D E F G# A up  \nA G# F E D C B A down\n\nWhat do these mean? Well, the Natural minor scale is essentially the same as the relative major (in this case, C major). The Melodic minor is what you'll typically see in melodic passages. The Harmonic minor is the scale representation of what chords you'll typically see in a minor key. Note the difference there is the G#. The reason for the G# is because the V chord (E G# B) is almost always going to be altered so that it's major, so that you can get that strong V to I resolution.\n\nThis is pretty tough to understand in writing.

{"body": "100 percent correct.\n\nStep by Step why the fuck not:\n\n\"However, because of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, Prof Lloyd's method seems to avoid this. Anything caused by the time travel must have had a finite probability of happening anyway, so paradoxical impossibilities are out. \"\n\nUm. No. Simply not true. Stating that something could have happened anyway does not refute the fact that  i t  d i d  n o t  a c t u a l l y  h a p p e n. The issue here is, apparently, that some people view time badly: time as we measure it, forward, backward, pause, etc.. is a misrep of what is actually going on. Time is just the observation of things shifting from one state to the next. Forward, backward, irrelevant.\n\n\"It is a controversial theory, to say the least. Some physicists claim that the apparently impossible things implied by postselection prove that it cannot work, which would destroy Prof Lloyd's theory before it got off the ground. \"\n\nCorrect. It's bullshit, and I agree.\n\n\"Unlike previous theories of teleportation, this apparently avoids the \"grandfather paradox\" - or, to Back to the Future fans, the Marty McFly problem. If you go back and change time, and accidentally end up killing your own grandparent, you create a paradox - you will not be born, so you cannot go back and affect time. Even with subatomic particles, this is still a problem: upon travelling back in time, the particle could somehow destroy its earlier self or move it, thus preventing it from travelling. \"\n\nThe implication here is based off of zero understanding of true grandfather paradox:\n\na) You can kill yourself if you travel back and time and... kill yourself, thus inhibiting your ability to actually go back and kill yourself to begin with (completely untrue. You would successfully kill yourself. The act has in deed gone down. Even if you un-died due to the fact that you never lived to kill yourself there is still, at some point, determined by the time between when you did and when you did not kill yourself and every 'possible state' in between, in some space time, a state in which you were/are dead (See: Infinite divisibility as to why this is actualy sillt too). People don't like this explanation; but it's quantum in nature.. what, it's ok to use quantum theory to prop up silly notions of time travel but not to refute one of the silliest ideas in physics of all time?\n\n\"oh em gee.. since, due to the fact that every state exists in some sort of 'rest energy or something until some causality makes it manifest, there is no GF paradox!\".\n\nYou would happen to be right about this but, not for the reason given. Fuckin silly. We can't time travel because there is no time; just our perception of something else that is actually going down. State change is cool... but there is no past, future or present really.

{"body": "&gt;He also explains why and names several examples. His point is obviously that the US government is not a trusted source since it has done equally terrible things before and after the event.\r\n\r\nDoesn't matter.  I'm discussing the form of his statement with reference to a specific logical fallacy.  What he's trying to prove is immaterial to the _form_ the argument takes.\r\n\r\n&gt;No, it's not. A false dichotomy occurs when it's claimed either one of two possibilities can be true while another possibility exists. Saying that one possibility out of two is more likely than the other is not a false dichotomy.\r\n\r\nA false dichotomy is of a misapplied disjunctive syllogism.\r\n\r\nIn a proper DS you have:\r\n\r\n1. A v B, given\r\n2. ~A, given\r\n3. :. B, By DS (1) and (2)\r\n\r\nYou could also have:\r\n\r\n1. [(A v B) v C] v D, given\r\n2. ~A ^ ~B ^ ~C  given\r\n3. :. D, By DS (1) and (2)\r\n\r\nThe key point being that one proves a remaining assertion by eliminating possibilities.  In a false dichotomy, one attempts to do the same, but with the form:\r\n\r\n1. (A v B) v C, given\r\n2. ~A, given\r\n3. :. B, By DS (1) and (2)\r\n\r\nBut since one ignores C, then a fallacy is present.  One cannot deduce B after only eliminating A.\r\n\r\nThe above poster has an _implied_ FD because he doesn't outright state that \"The government _must_ have staged a FF attack because the other model is incorrect.\"  Instead, he attempts to use a dichotomy as a proof of _feasibility_ instead of a proof of absolute truth.\r\n\r\nEssentially, he attemptsto provide evidentiary weight to his hypothesis of feasibility by proving that his model is more feasible than another model.  However, as you yourself prove with your above analogies, comparing two random models out of a universe of them can prove nothing.\r\n\r\nImagine: \"Hitler either was an alien, or a potato\"\r\n\r\nSince Aliens have never been observed, but potatoes have, it is more likely that Hitler is a potato than an alien.\r\n\r\nThis statement may be true.  But just because it's more likely he is one than the other, that doesn't imply that either answer is _correct or feasible_.\r\n\r\nLet's use some sentential variables:\r\n\r\nP = \"Model A is more likely\"  \r\nQ = \"Model B is more likely\"  \r\n\r\nSince it is clear that both models can't be more likely than each other at the same time, we have a given: P v Q\r\n\r\n1. P v Q\r\n2. ~P (by the OP's assertion)\r\n3. :. Q\r\n\r\nSeems like a similar form to a regular disjunctive syllogism, except ...\r\n\r\n&gt;The choice is between doing X and not doing X\r\n\r\nHere's where the fallacy comes in.  You are apparently not reading what he wrote.  His \"P\"  was:  \"A model of the universe where the US government might stage false flag attacks is a more accurate model ...\"\r\n\r\nSo to have a P and a ~P, his ~P would have to be phrased: \"than A model of the universe where the US government might NOT stage false flag attacks.\"\r\n\r\nIf these were his statements, then the Law of the Excluded Middle would apply, and you would be correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, his actual second model was, \"one where the US government is assumed to be benign.\"\r\n\r\nAssuming the US is benign is clearly _not_ a pure negation of his first model.  Instead of P v ~P, he has P v Q and TLEM does not apply.\r\n\r\nSince TLEM doesn't apply, there is no rational, deductive way to eliminate the existence of other models from the discussion.  So, we have to revise our symbolic interpretation of his statement:\r\n\r\nP = \"Model A is more likely\"  \r\nQ = \"Model B is more likely\"  \r\nR = \"Model R is more likely\"  \r\nS = Model S is more likely\"  \r\n... etc for the whole universe of discourse.  \r\n\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n1. P v Q v R v S ...\r\n2. ~P (by the OP's assertion)\r\n3. :. Q\r\n\r\nAnd so we have, regardless of content, the classic model of the fallacy.\r\n\r\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1280261709", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I tend to play a combination of chromaticism, notes of the current chord and pentatonic when I solo, so when I practice scales I play them in intervals and often add chromatic notes which results in something much more musical than just playing the notes of the scale.  Also, I play chord progressions this way.\n\nThe easiest example of this would be to take a ii-V-I progression (say am7 d7 GM7 (or add the 9ths/11ths/13ths if you want).  Then begin with playing the related modal scales for a couple of octaves, then play 3rds, then fifths and so on.  Once you know where all the intervals are, you can start arpeggiating the chords and adding chromaticism.  If you want to make reading music a part of this, then write it out first, say the notes, play the notes.\n\nWhat I've accomplished with this is a process for creating melodic, \"in\" solos that make sense and that my fingers are well trained to do. At the same time, I think of scales in relationship to chords rather than just as a string of notes.  This is a process that I think is valid for *any* genre and will set you apart in areas where guitarists rehash the same blues licks over any chord progression.  \n\nI guess if I were to list the things I think should be done it'd be like this:\n\n* Be able to \"spell\" chords out, such as that Am9 is A C E G B or that E7b5#9 is E G# Bb D G.  Go further by understanding inversions.\n\n* Know the notes on the fretboard.  It sounds like a lot but it's not that bad.  I can do up to probably the 9th fret and I haven't really been doing it much for a while.\n\n* Learn two octaves of each mode (major and minor are just modes, you know).  Go further by knowing multiple shapes and positions.  \n\n* Learn to play scales in intervals.  The most common is to play them in 3rds, but you can do 2nds, 4ths and 5ths as well.  If you're crazy you can go to 6th and 7ths.\n\n* Play chords arpegiated so that you learn which notes are \"safe\" for any given chord.  It's pretty easy to play the triad for any given chord, but you can really open up your options if you're willing to play up to at least the 7th.\n\n* Play chord progressions arpegiated. As I mentioned previously, doing something like a ii-V-I but by playing it like A C E G -&gt; D F# A E -&gt; G B D F#.  I should point out that it's unlikely that you'll be playing this in the same shape as the chord.  If you are, you're probably doing it wrong.  What I'm suggesting is that you actually play the note in its position of the mode's shape that you're playing.\n\nIn addition to hitting all the right notes, I cannot stress the importance of a metronome enough.  It's better to play every note exactly right at an excruciatingly slow tempo than to to allow yourself to get sloppy.\n\nI should point out that I was much better at this 10 years ago than I am now, but I'm trying to build it back up and, for now, that means putting the metronome on 40 and playing in half notes.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1280354634", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I played T and did a proxy reaper rush, but P did 2 proxy gate in my base.  Ended up killing his nexus and I lifted my CC to the expansion guarded by rocks.  By the time I got there since buildings fly so fricking slow, I was barely able to make a marine before his 8 zealots forced me to lift off again.  Anyways I had a orbital command floating with no army and P had an army without enough money to build a nexus or a flying unit to kill my buildings.\n\nSo my first strategy was to alt tab and browse reddit for 20 minutes hoping he would leave.  I alt tab back and apaprently hes still in the game, so I sneakily land my OC at an expansion and started muling up.  Apparently (when I was checing the replay) he was manually scouting for the past 20 minutes.  I kept trying to bounce around expoes but I was pretty noob back then and I forgot buildings could burn so eventually I lost my OC.\n\nSo then I was left with some floating barracks and no money and he is left with a ground army.  Stalemate, so I resolved to wait it out and win by alt tabbing again.  However, I still wanted to play another ladder match so I alt tabbed back in to the game and apparently this guy is a zen master with infinite patience.  We started chatting and I was seriously considering leaving on my computer for the entire night just to spite him.\n\nWe ended up agreeing to settle this with a real strategy game: chess.  We signed on yahoo chess and had an epic 40 minute back and forth chess match (I\"m probably only rated 1500 ELO in chess) and somehow I managed to squeeze a win in the endgame.

{"body": "Okay, you're own logic isn't taking into account that I said cinematic with theatrical release. My eight did include the '66 film.\n\nAdditionally, where logic is concerned, lets apply some.\n\nDoes Nolan's Batman take place in Gotham?  Is there a Joker? Gordon, Alfred, Batmobile, Bruce Wayne, is the back story consistent? Yes. It is.  So yes, there are eight, or more, we can argue that if it's really important to you, Batman movies.  Are you sure you wanted to use the separate Universe theory?\n\nYou have talked yourself into a corner.  Explain to me, though, what exactly is the point of starting arguments if you don't really care enough about your own statements to stick with them?\n\nIf your only interest is in being right, then sure...you are dismissed.  Additionally, if you're only interested in an argument on semantics, then I can safely assume that I'll never be able to explain myself in such a way that you'll understand...then again you use words like *owned* so I can safely assume we're not working with the same deck of cards.\n\nIf you're interested in discussing the elements of two very different sets films, Burton's Batman v. Nolan's Batman for example, then you're going to have to come at it in a different way.  Explain to me why Burton sucks, as you so succinctly describe, and maybe I'll leave you alone, but as for right now; no, you're not quite off my hook.\n\nNolan's view of what a film should be is interesting, but uniformed.  His use of light and dark, both as a lighting concept and an emotional metaphor, is just barely developed to the level of a film-school freshman.  His ability to solicit performances is highly developed. He's also great when it comes to casting, as I feel that Gary Oldman as Det. Gordon might be one of the most well informed casting choices in recent memory.  Where he fails, though, is in releasing emotional tension.  In The Prestige, everything runs together, because he never clears the slate to get the viewer to a place where the, albeit, rather complicated plot device can make sense.\n\nAnd, yes, I'm well aware...\n\n**I N C E P T I O N**\n\n...is supposed to be the greatest movie ever of all time until forever, but, and I haven't had a chance to really analyze it, as I've only seen it twice, but it's not that great.\n\nI'll relate a little anecdote: the last time I remember everyone going ape-shit in this way about a movie, it was Fight Club...hardly cinema for the ages.\n\nOn the other hand, and this is my opinion that I'm not trying to disguise as fact, Tim Burton, in his heyday, was ten times the film maker that Nolan is now, **I N C E P T I O N** included.  Burton's view of film as art is well over the head of Nolan's *fuck-with-their-mind, make sure everyone's pretty, and let the details melt into obscurity* treatment of film.  Burton cares, deeply I might add, about every aspect of his films.  he cares about the subtext, about the politics involved, vis-a-vis Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, he can use, color as well as he uses light and dark, he can get the performance out of actors who are generally considered to be difficult, like Jack Nicholson and Pierce Brosnan, and, I believe most damningly of all, he has an aesthetic that no director before or since has been able to top.  Everyone knows when they are watching a Burton film, whereas Nolan's style is easily mistaken for many of the in-your-face action/drama directors of his vintage, a la Alfonso Cuaron and Doug Liman.\n\nSo I'm willing to concede that Nolan's Batman movies can be considered separate, they are still part of an over-arching category, called Batman movies, of which there are eight.  Or nine.  Or twelve.  The fact of the matter is, it *doesn't* matter.  What does matter is that good film making will always be good film making, and Hollywood hype-men like Nolan will always be money making machines before they even consider their art.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1280512323", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Nolan seems to be, first and foremost, a writer/director who can't resist red herrings and other tantalizing tangents. I think \"face value\" may well be moot point here.
