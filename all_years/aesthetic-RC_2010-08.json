That way you can double tap that key to get to where your queen is at, press V and then easily spawn larvas on the hatchery next to it. This way all your queens can puke larva in 1-3 seconds with enough practice.\n\nAsk away if you've got any other questions, my main race is protoss but i know all races quite well.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1280774573", "subreddit": "starcraft", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; As I said in another post, my music is very \"riff oriented\"\n\nThink of it this way: your bass notes are going to put your riffs into context. So, let's say your riff has the notes A B C B A. If the bass is playing an A, it's going to make that riff sound like it's in A minor. If the bass line is playing a C, it's going to sound like it's in C major. If the bass is playing a G, it's going to sound like it's in G major. With those 3 notes, a bunch of different possibilities are possible. Try it yourself: record yourself playing those notes in whatever rhythm you want, loop it, and then play your bass along with it, droning on a single note to get an idea of what kind of feel it creates.\n\n\nOnce you have an idea of that, you don't have to have all your bass lines be boring pedal notes all the time. Modern pop uses bass as a countermelody very, very often (thank you, James Jamerson). So, once you have the basic idea of what kind of bass note to play along with the chords, you can write a bass line in that key. For example, in our example riff, if you liked the feel of the \"A\" note, you'd write a bass line in the key of A minor, since that's the key those notes dictate. (why? all the notes are in the scale of A minor, but not A major.) If you liked the feel the \"G\" had, you'd write in G major (for the same reason).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1280778022", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "ok, here are some of my tips  \n\n1) I actually take ALL my strings off before I restring. So I can clean my frets. I put a little piece of wood under the tail peice to stop the bridge being pulled back into the body by the springs. dont scratch your guitar though :|  \n    \n\n2) DO NOT take the guitar straight to the correct tuning. Some people like to pull their strings to stretch them first. I just tune over the course of 30 minutes maybe whilst I do something else.  \n  \n3) in your post you said \"Lo E- Hi E-B-A-G-D.\" Im really confused. thats only 5 strings and the order makes no sense. Do you mean E A D G B E?   \n \n4) If the bridge was set for half a step back; then the bridge will not be perfectly level in standard tuning. I would tighten the springs a tiny bit (but dont break your strings, detune first... :| )  \n  \n5) Always remember...the strings pull the bridge one way; and the springs pull it the opposite direction. This helps with tuning. Because, if you tune your low E...and then your A...your E will have gone down because the A is helping pull against the springs. Just be careful when putting on new strings that you arent letting the bridge pull the strings really sharp somehow; which may be stressing them to break.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1280792569", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Its late for me but I'll take a shot at this... (I'm pro-choice playing devils advocate btw)\n\nGetting hit by a truck represents an immediate need for care to the individual who has been hit; the pregnant woman is has not faced this direct threat and immediate danger to her physical health. Abortion presents a few more layers of complexity that your analogy (I feel) cannot compare to - which is mostly on what a pregnant mother feels is morally justified when considering abortion. Based on cultural upbringing and personal belief, does she see the fetus as a live and sentient being from the moment of conception? Of course that interpretation is up to the mother to decide, whereas such a thought for the human error of getting hit by a truck does not represent the same dilemma in context, for he/she is thinking only for himself/herself at that moment whereas the mother-to-be may be thinking for two.\n\n\nWhere I see the abortion issue from the OP's perspective is that to perform a non-therapeutic abortion is no different than contributing to genocide/homocide, based on how one interprets the value of the fetuses life upon conception and thereafter. Yes, the mother may not be able to provide and care for the child however, she may either come to terms with the matter at hand, or seek other viable and culturally (current cultural modest views that is) acceptable options, whereas abortion can easily be viewed as the path of least resistance.\n\n\nA few people I know have had several abortions in their lifetime. And based on my experience and observations (I hate to end topics with \"oh thats a touchy subject\" and end it there.) It devalues the natural process of life and death. In the case of the hillwalker breaking his leg, for all we know despite the medical treatment, he could suffer a stroke as a result of a fat embolism and die from it and we have no one to blame other than due process of nature. The jaywalker who got hit by a truck... What if he/she instantly died? As a result of his/her death, it will be a lesson to those in the future to avoid jaywalking carelessly, and his/her memory has served a purpose, whereas generations of repeated avoidable abortions has the potential to change the perception of how women view the value of pregnancy, and imo deviates from natures/evolutionary intentions.\n\n\nIn conclusion, all I can say from the OP's perspective (from my perspective... **I N C E P T I O N**) is that humans are the only beings in this planet who own pencils with erasers - it makes mistakes go away, sure, but does it truly serve a beneficial purpose in the end? Seeing it from Humanity as a whole, do you want to remember your past mistakes, or make sure you never remember it again?\n\nFor visual perspective [this](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Chicken-embryo-1week_old-stereomicroscope.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chicken-embryo-1week_old-stereomicroscope.jpg&amp;usg=__YxA6QbPTRBLzYh2l2QkGBo23saU=&amp;h=2112&amp;w=2816&amp;sz=2751&amp;hl=en&amp;start=17&amp;sig2=DHQjkJdhnZZ5yToY4EwEfQ&amp;tbnid=pvds8rmj60CZ5M:&amp;tbnh=160&amp;tbnw=213&amp;ei=NsZbTKCoIozksQOC-Lj_Dw&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3D1%2Bweek%2Bold%2Bfetus%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26rlz%3D1C1DVCB_enUS333US339%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D675%26tbs%3Disch:10,900&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=358&amp;vpy=134&amp;dur=6999&amp;hovh=194&amp;hovw=259&amp;tx=199&amp;ty=92&amp;oei=J8ZbTOTUGIHksQOLsKXkDQ&amp;esq=2&amp;page=2&amp;ndsp=15&amp;ved=1t:429,r:11,s:17&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=675) is a 1 week old fetus and [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_fetus_10_weeks_-_therapeutic_abortion.jpg) is at 10 weeks.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1281083080", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Even veteran women end up getting great advice/tips from hookers, porn stars etc. before they figure out how to be on top with confidence. The best thing you could do is try and get some of the best tips you can find. Hell, I'd probably even send some 'fan' letter to someone like Sasha Grey and ask for her very best tips. If you are lucky, you'll get a personal response that automatically boosts you past the floozies you hear about in the Chewy commercials.  \n\nGo to college and find the least douchey fraternity. You will be surprised that not all are that bad. Go to the Greek Council and find out which one has the most engineers and/or highest GPA on campus. Go to their parties and get invited to their winter formal. This will probably end up entailing a free trip to the mountains for you. Don't drink to much up there or you will get altitude sickness. You will have a blast skiing and having some badass cabin is actually very romantic (bring your own trapp candles if you please). I am a guy and this what I did to lose my virginity. The only difference was that I paid for it and had to ask the girl to come with me. All you have to do is find a nice guy that you can see occasionally and build up some interests with. This will be a very romantic way to introduce yourself into both sex and college.\n\nIt will all go downhill from there. You will soon find out after your freshmen year that school isn't that easy and mature men are not easy to come by. By your junior year sex won't be an issue and you will probably have found an awesome boyfriend. If I could suggest anything it would be to find a modest engineering student who likes the outdoors, loves to cook for you, has interests in the arts, actually goes mountain biking/swimming/running and is actually dedicated to becoming a better person in life. There is no such thing as Mr. or Mrs. perfect. The best couple will be the one that can argue and get over it. Communication is key to any relationship you approach. If that breaks down at any time, you are already off track. Best of luck. I know you'll be fine.

{"body": "I try to make a boring dish interesting. Here's what I did with a grilled cheese sandwich the other day:\n\n1. Start heating up some olive oil on low, and chop up some onion (however much you want on your sandwich, plus a bit more). Toss it in the pan, and let it start to caramalize. I recommend doing everything else in this recipe s l o w l y, so's to give said onions time to become awesome. Add a bit of fish sauce, some basil, and some dijon mustard, and proceed to ignore the onions.\n \n2. Cut a clove of garlic in half. Set aside one piece, and slice the other quite thinly. Toss it in with the onions.\n \n3. Slice up your cheese. I used 50% cheddar, 40% mozza, and 10% parmesan, but this comes down to what kind of cheese you like.\n \n4. Slice a small tomato (cherry/grape) as thinly as you can, and then cut those slices into 3 or 4 strips each. We want an even tomato distribution, as I've found whole slices tend to get pulled out of the sandwich when you bite them.\n \n5. Assemble your sandwich! DO NOT butter the bread, outside or in. This will be taken care of soon enough. I began by layering my cheeses, adding the sliced tomatoes, and then putting the (now delicious) onions atop that. Use about 3/4 of the onions, and leave the remainder in the pan.\n \n6. So, remember that remaining chunk of garlic? Cut it up, this time there's no need to do it so finely - just make sure it's got a fair bit of surface area.\n \n7. Drop a chunk of butter in the pan, which should now contain a bit of oil, onion, and misc. bits. Add the remaining garlic, and turn up the heat to medium-medium high. Stoves vary; this is the ideal sandwich grilling temperature on mine.\n \n8. The butter should be starting to bubble, and the onions turning a bit dark. Drop your sandwich in, wait a second while it absorbs some butter, and carefully flip it to ensure even butter distribution.\n \n9. During the actual sandwich-cooking time, the onions will start to turn a dark brown. They're primarily there to flavor the butter, but the ones that turn nearly black and stick to your sandwich gives your bread +10 to delicious. Flip your sandwich after a couple minutes, repeat as needed until it's nicely golden brown. Scrape off most (but not all) of the stuck on onion bits, stick it on a plate and split it in half. You now have the evolution of the grilled cheese as we know it. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1281266123", "subreddit": "trees", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Someone asked what I was doing there (seemed to be some sort of authority figure) and I responded \"just trying to find where I'm supposed to be.\"\n\nThe room seemed to be an Olympic sized indoor pool.  It was like I'd stumbled into some sort of swimming class or something, but the students looked almost twenty.  One looked up, her green eyes locked into mine as she said \"You belong here.\"  I knew she was right.  She looked familiar, but I didn't recognize her.  Maybe she was from another dream.\n\nI sat down nearby her as the instructor began speaking again.  I saw that I was the only one not ready for a swim.  I looked a her with a confused look, but she only giggled.  I loved her smile.  I was so glad I could put a smile on that blonde goddess' face.  Suddenly the others stood up and jumped in.  Before she jumped in, I asked her \"are you sure I'm supposed to be here?  I'm not ready to jump in.\"  She just laughed again.  She stepped towards me from the edge of the pool.  Motioned to me that I take off my jeans.  I undid the fly but she pulled them down for me, and I took off my shirt.  She kissed me as my shirt cleared my head, then jumped into the water behind her.

Assuming this and a constant rate of RAM usage, the garbage singularity exists. Although impracticable on a PC due to the cost of physically purchasing and adding RAM, it can be realized in the cloud, where this cost is spread over all users, and can be absorbed in the rate term, as a fractional slowing.\n\nThis may seem fanciful, but Moore's Law puts the rate at approximately 1,000-fold over 15 years. There likely are systems from 30 or 45 years ago, that a x1,000,000 or x1,000,000,000 decrease in RAM cost, and ongoing decrease of halving that every 18 months, would outstrip their RAM usage for their traditional patterns of use.\n\nOf course, the assumption of constant rate of usage is incorrect, as this rate is also increasing; as we have more RAM, we use more RAM. It might seem that the singularity will still occur provided that the rare of usage increase is less than the rate of price decrease, but a further practical difficulty is that if RAM does become sufficiently cheap, it will be cheaper than is needed for practical purposes, and is a candidate for disruption by alternative RAM technology with benefits other than price (perhaps speed or power consumption), analogous of the progression from tape to hard-drive to SSDs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1281412639", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Summoner spells that are good on him are clarity, ignite, teleport, flash, and ghost. I usually get flash and ghost. I get yellow MP5 per level and blue CD reduction per level, those are more or less different depending on the your playstyle. Skills to get are Q E Q E Q R Q W Q W R W W W E R E E. Early on, lane defensively (let your ally know that you are not a threat early). Farm with Q and use E to keep yourself alive. Sapphire crystal and health pots are your first items, farm until you get a good chance to go back, grab your tear and boots and keep at it. Use E to land W, and fight at maximum range unless you absolutely have to get closer. E and W both take practice to use effectively, lots of practice will pay off. Get archangels after boots, zhonyas, then whatever you want. Lich Bane is great, but not useful until you really get the feel for him. Play him like the unforgiving 2 foot fury he is, here's how to one shot a squishy. Stun them, drop W on them, baleful them, then ult them. Time and time again I have taken people from 100% to 0% in about two seconds. Stay away from poppy, she counters you way too hard.

{"body": "One of the biggest aspects of creating good sounding drum lines is dynamics. \n\nAll too often I see/hear drum lines where every hit of every note is the same velocity, this sounds boring and lame.\n\nThink about it, a real drummer is always going to have a slight variance in how hard they hit the drum, the angle they hit it, whether they clip the rim, what kind of stick they are using, etc etc. All this contributes to the overall feel of the drum sound. Many people do not have a good grasp on programming this effectively, and rightfully so. \n\nSo ya, the base drum samples you work with play a part, but the ones in reason CAN sound pretty damn good if you work with them well.\n\nPlay around with differing levels of compression &amp; reverb on your samples. It's been a while since I used reason but I wanna say that ReDrum has 2 effect sends right? I'd assign those sends to be a compressor and a reverb. Now you can use the 1/2 knobs to adjust the send on each individual drum sample. That'll help get you more punch and the reverb will help add some boom to your toms/kicks. \n\nNow you wanna dig into the individual velocity's for each individual hit and play with that a bunch, there's no wrong or right here, it all depends on the samples you are using, the \"feel\" you are going for, and the pattern you are working with.\n\nFor example, on a drum roll, you will generally want to accent the down-stroke by having a higher velocity, then subsequent hits generally step lower each time until you come to the next down beat.\n\nSo let's say you have an 8th note drum roll:\n\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\n\nif all the velocities are pegged at 100% it'll sound crappy, but if you do something like this (%'s are velocity values, sorry for the awkward notation):\n\nX-100% X-90% X-80% X-70% X-80% X-70% X-60% X-50% X-100% X-90% X-80% X-70% X-80% X-70% X-60% X-50%\n\nit'll sound cooler ;D\n\nin addition, you can have certain parameters on redrum be affected by velocity, this will further shape the sound depending on what the velocity value is and can be really useful. From what I can remember, it's nice to have the pitch of the kick be affected by the velocity, this can help mimic a more realistic kick sound. Real kick drums tend to have a tighter, punchier sound when hit max force, softer kicks will have a lower boomier sound. You can also mimic this by simply automating whatever parameter you want along with the drum track's velocity.\n\nSo ya, sorry that got long winded, but to recap:\n\nEach drum hit should sound different from the last (generally, though some songs also rely on things being exactly the same)\n\nVelocity plays a major role in creating this differentiation, and can also be used to affect other parameters to further modify the sound.\n\nYou can also automate effect/sample parameters alongside the drum pattern to further differentiate the sound via external effects/VSTs.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAh, one other thing I forgot to mention is: Correctly pan your drums!! There's numerous ways to go about it, and none is necessarily right or wrong, but in general... Center your kick drum, pan your snare SLIGHTLY left or right, pan your HH the same direction as your snare, pan your ride the opposite of snare and further out, pan your crash the same as snare but further out, pan your high tom with the snare, mid tom the opposite direction of the snare but the same distance and your floor tom right along with your ride. This will get you started. But if you need more reference/ideas on how to pan drums, simply look at different drumkit layouts people use and basically emulate that via your panning. The way I just described above is a pretty typical layout for rock drummers on a 7pc kit with crash &amp; ride.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1281652539", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 38, "controversiality": 0}

What got in the way was your nervousness, naturally, possibly a little guilt -- but that will stop anyone, gay or straight, from finishing up.\n\nThe meeting up again is hopeful, and you should definitely do so, and give it another try. One word of advice: not everyone does get off on oral sex, depending on the technique used. I've been on the receiving end of many a BJ that seemed to take for ever to a l m o s t get there but never did. I'm assuming the other guy has hands, and if oral isn't doing it for you, it's totally within your right to suggest something else -- in a playful horny way, of course, and not judgmentally. And it's completely okay to turn the intellectual part of your brain off and let your body drive when you're having sex.\n\nYou're not stupid, and you'll learn to not be nervous.

It could of easily been the next Terminator 2, instead of some amazingly looking CGI jerkfest similar to the Transformer series.\n\nThese movies will not be remembered, and the CGI will look horribly out of date in the long run.

{"body": "It was long and convoluted, but I'll see if I can summarize the major points. Of course, now that I recall it in my logical brain, it doesn't seem to make much sense either. But I'll do my best.\n\nI awoke in some strange land with no memory of how I got there. But isn't that always how dreams usually begin (**I N C E P T I O N**). *Anyway*, I quickly found 3 local people and attempted to figure out who they were and where I was. They seemed to not understand anything I was saying. We heard an unearthly noise (think the Striders from Half-Life 2 if you're familiar with the series). They scrambled to take shelter in a nearby shed, so naturally I followed suit.\n\nThrough the cracked door I saw 3 giraffes clumsily stumbling along, their tiny heads twisting and turning in all directions. Something seemed off about the giraffes though, I think their eyes were red, and they moved otherworldly. Anyway, the giraffes eventually moved on and we cautiously crawled out. Before we could respond, 2 tigers leaped out of the grass and crouched in front of us. We all froze in fear.\n\nAt this moment, I seemed to have an out of body experience. I could see my body fall asleep and I had somehow transferred my consciousness to a small bird that stood in front of the tigers. It was at this time I could communicate with the tigers.\n\nThey told me that human society had regressed to a primitive state. Mysterious beings came here and took the form of various animals in order to infiltrate earth and subjugate the humans. The giraffes we saw were death squads meant to eradicate lone groups. The giraffes were actually mechanical, which was why they seemed \"off\" originally. I was brought here, and could communicate with them by using animal spirits, because I was the chosen one meant to free humanity.\n\nThey panicked, told me to hide, and quickly bounded off. The distant mechanical cries of the giraffes came in the distance. We scrambled back into the dark corners of the shed. Soon I saw a giraffe head, this time much more mechanical with exposed gears and red lights, poke its head into the shed door. It was about 10 feet away, looked right at me, and I got the coldest chill deep down. At this point I woke up in a sweat.\n\nI attempted to return to my dream because it was intense and I wanted to see what happened. But alas I fell back asleep and don't think I dreamed anymore until I woke up again in the morning.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1282015223", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

It's not the slightest bit fucking relevant. You posting  \"**I N C E P T I O N**\" in reference to a mindfuck is no more relevant than me posting \"**D O N N I E D A R K O**\". Notice how that isn't funny, at all?\n\ntl;dr: shut the fuck up nerd\n\n-\n\nThanks for helping ruin Reddit, and have a fuck-off day!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1282594283", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There's a girl I know who broke my life senior year of high school. I had the biggest crush on her, and I was her second best (I found out much later). I also found out that her crush was my second choice, who also contributed to breaking my life, because *her* crush was my first choice, and I was mad for both of them, and they didn't know they had crushes on each other, so they were both desperately unhappy too. **H I G H S C H O O L**. \n\nAnyway.\n\nShe was gorgeous, and had a smile which will still make me melt. It still does; she's probably still, for me, the most beautiful woman I've ever met. By the end of high school I'd realized she wasn't a good fit for me, but I still had a crush on her all through college (I had other girlfriends, but there was a special place for her).\n\nThis summer (just out of college) I had an opportunity to get in touch with her again (as a friend). She had called me wanting to get in touch, and left a message. For a while I didn't call back because I was nervous, didn't know what to say, etc. Gradually I realized something: I don't want her in my life. I could call her back, hang out with her, have a good time, and be totally smitten with her (her smile is even more irresistable in person). Or I could just pretend I didn't get the message, and move on with my life.\n\nTurning that opportunity down voluntarily was one of the more empowering things I've done.

{"body": "Thanks! I'm glad you could get something out of it.\n\n&gt; Do the roman numerals which represent the positions within the scale (i, ii, III, iv, v, VI, VII) always follow this min - min - maj - min - min - maj - maj pattern? \n\nYep. This pattern is the same for just about any piece of Western music that is set in a minor key. It doesn't matter at all what your root note is. \n\nTo be a bit more accurate (I avoided mentioning this earlier), but the ii chord is actually a diminished chord (marked ii°), rather than a normal minor chord.\n\nThe equivilant pattern for a major keys is:\n\n    I ii iii IV V vi vii°\n\n99% of Western popular music uses the chords provided by either one of those patterns, and transposed to some root note. Even the craziest jazz is *usually* founded in this basic set up.\n\nThere is a really simple reason for this that blew my mind back in the day. Say you are writing a song in C Major. That means you have the notes in a C Major scale at your disposal: C D E F G A B. \n\nEach basic chord is built of:\n\n1. A root note as the starting point. \n2. A third, two notes up the scale from the starting point.\n3. A fifth, four notes up the scale from the starting point.\n\nSo these are the possible chords that you can build from a C Major scale, along with their names, and the degree of the root note:\n\n Notes     | Degree | Name\n:---------|:-------:|:--------\n C E G | I   | C Major \n D F A | II  | D Minor \nE G B|III|E Minor\nF A C|IV|F Major\nG B D|V|G Minor\nA C E|VI|A Minor\nB D F|VII|B Diminished\n\nSo, you could work out what root note and tonality your song will be in, list the possible notes, and build all of the possible chords. Or instead, you could observe that, since the scales are the same every time, the chords will be the same every time relative to the root note.\n\nIt should also be obvious to you that if you were to start from a different scale, for example a harmonic minor scale instead of the natural minor, you will end up with different chords to chose from. This is reasonably common, but for the most part, people use the natural major and minor scales.\n\n&gt; All of this information will help me immensely and I greatly appreciate it.\n\nNo problem. I just started a new job and don't have much to do right yet.

{"body": "Just this past summer I had to work exclusively with MS-Access applications/databases, two of them to be specific.\n\nThey were both products of the same group of people. Unfortunately, none of them were developers, but regular employees doing it on the side for the company.\n\nThe first application is a critical flight invoicing and record keeping application with 3 users. For the most part, it is an amazing application that is surprisingly low in complexity. \n\nOn the other hand, it's not normalized at all. You have not known the *horror* of having a table with over **120** fields.\n\nImagine showing up to your job interview and being given a report and being asked to recreate the report for an unnormalized set of tables with zero explicit primary key/foreign key relationships (btw, they still exist, but they're just *implied*...). Also, three of the tables themselves were duplicates of each other, field for field, all 120 of them.\n\nSince the tables weren't normalized, we get into situations where we're trying to emulate a normalized table structure, such as flight legs. Well, we can only have up to 8 flight legs... so, let's create a query that has 8 UNION statements tied together to emulate that. Made a mistake? Change it in all of the UNION statements and hope you didn't make a mistake. Also, that statement is working on faulty logic. ***Fantastic***.\n\nAlso, the primary developer of the application all but refused to document the database/application at all. \n\nIn database classes, they say never to refer to something by its value, since if it were to change in the primary table, then the foreign table would have to update all of its entries to match it. Well, this happens **all the fucking time in this application**. \n\nReferring to a employee by their name is bad... now referring to an employee by their first name field and their last name field (2 fields) is even worse. Now, have you ever seen an employee referred by **3** fields? First, last name and registration number. Oh lord.\n\nAlso, in reports there wouldn't be any categories attached to tables or any kind of relationships there, but there would be a need for these categories in the reports that they generate! What ends up happening is that it checks for the department name in the SQL query and then casts it to 1 or 0 if their ID is in a set range (hard coded into the query).\n\nAlso, customers are referred to by name. Want to change your company's name? **Too damn bad**. You won't show up in the reports after that since all of your old invoices were done with your old name. Solution: every (fiscal) year, make a new version of the database/application and back that up and *then* you may change your name.\n\nThe other application that I had to support was a application to take exams on. \n\nAgain, not normalized. The employees who could take exams were tied to boolean fields within their own table. Need a new exam added? Well, add it to the exams table but also add a new **field** within the employees table, so they can be enabled. Also, you must adjust the subform that displays the available exams that an employee can take.\n\nThe damn subform query had 32 IIf statements in there, each one for an exam.\n\nIt's a multiple choice exam taking application, so each button triggers a new function that determines if it was right or wrong. Every time you answer a question, a MsgBox shows up with Family Guy quotes. Literally. For a 50 question test too. Also, you get 2 tries....\n\nThe logic within answering the question is arcane and full of GOTO statements. Real spaghetti code in there. Also, this code is replicated **for each of the A B C D buttons**. There was a bug that if you had answered right on the last question with B, then it wouldn't end the exam -- it would just hang there.\n\nTaking a 1/2 hour look at the program, I decided to rewrite the entire thing. Now it's normalized and adding people to exams or editing questions in an exam, etc. are painless. As well as emailed reports of the results every time they finish and a bi-weekly report that's sent out to management on who has exams expiring. All and all, it's much improved.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1282861541", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, but your studies will all be funded and reported by anti-circumcision groups. Just a glance at google confirms this. All of the reputable studies show nothing but benefits. You cannot trade studies, because the studies do not support your position. Almost every STI statistic, from HPV to HIV, is hugely mitigated by circumcision. \n\nInfant circumcision is an extremely simple procedure which has a very low chance of complications when performed by skilled practitioners. After one year of age, the chances of complications rise enormously. This is an excellent reason to perform the operation as soon as possible after birth. Once again, a quick glance at google and this information is right there, provided by people like the WHO, the CDC, and other respected bodies. \n\nYou keep repeating that the foreskin is the most sensitive skin on the penis, but researchers have shown that circumcised men have no difficulty in achieving the same levels of sexual pleasure that uncircumcised men enjoy. This is not denial, or doublethink, but simple fact. G O O G L E.\n\nYour contention that the decision should be left to adulthood is ridiculous. Parents make far more important decisions on behalf of their children than this, it is part of their responsibility as parents. If a parent CHOOSES not to circumcise their child, that is their right... And their choice. You have no right to take that choice away from them. It is immoral of you even to try.\n\nNo one is defending female genital mutilation. the removal of the clitoris, done for the express purpose of encouraging chastity (because sex will no longer be pleasurable) is an entirely different issue. Attempting to conflate them is an utter insult to all of the women who have actually been mutilated. You should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nFinally, nobody said circumcised men do not pass hiv infections on to their partners. They are merely 60% less likely to contract HIV in the first place. Again, a quick glance at google is all you need.\n\nI see no need to continue this. I am right. You are wrong. I would like to think that I have helped a few people in this thread look a little closer into the facts behind the circumcision debate, and that somewhere at this very moment, a redditor is resolving to decrease her son's chance of dying from aids by 60%.\n\n60%!!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1282869497", "subreddit": "sex", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I generally don't respond to messages on Reddit due to the redundant nature of the task, but yours is special, you touched a nerve.  First you say that I missed the point, which point exactly?  What was the point?  Can you tell me?  Was it that I would never be able to experience the 'magic' of starting pokemon adventure from fresh because I had already had the experience before?  If that was the point, that's even sadder than what I had thought and gave too much credit to the original post.  \n\nSecondly, you say that living out a fictitious story-world in your imagination is better than the reality you experience.  This is exactly the kind of thinking that creates people who cannot distinguish reality from fiction... the person you've described would be happy sitting in front of a screen for xx number of hours/days/years playing something like WoW or Sims, while the real fucking world goes by.  If real life isn't interesting enough that you find yourself escaping into fiction, then you need to make a change in your life.  I love science fiction, I love videogames, I love literary classics, I love movies, I love graphic novels, but for the love of holy fuck would I never trade any of those in for the visceral thrill of travel, camaraderie through adventure (not questing in groups with people I've never met in real life), and waking up in the morning and thinking to myself 'I have all the tools I need to shape my day into something fucking awesome, and I don't need to escape my reality by diving into a fabricated illusion that makes me feel like I'm more than I actually am'.  Fiction is there to complement reality, not the other way around.  The books you speak of, I'll specify  Law and Punishment and the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, are there to teach us about life so that we can better understand ourselves and come to know who we are as individuals.  \n\nWhat part of real life can compare to the brilliant and impossible fantasies of books and video games, you ask?  What the fuck do you think Games and books are based on?  The aspects of real life that connect us to the world.  Here's your example: I might not be able to shoot fire out of my hands, but I can travel this planet and discover lands so incredibly different and people so unique that everything I thought I once knew is thrown into question.  Apart from the obvious spaceship and interstellar travel, what's the difference between traveling to a far off planet and taking a plane and flying to India, Vietnam, Japan, China, wherever?  There IS no difference save for the fact that one is R E A L and immediate, it is adventure, real life questing if you will, it is discovery of the unknown, it is empowering in ways that you can use to get ahead in life, it forces you to think beyond HP/XP, it forces you to know yourself in ways you never could in a an Avatar's digital world.  Leveling up?  It's based on real life skill earning spent doing hard work, challenging yourself, and reaping the benefits of leaving your comfort zone, which, by the, is extended to include video games, books, and movies.  \n\nThe emotions are prefabricated and dulled down, you cannot compare a video game or novel to going on a road trip with friends, to traveling solo in a country where you don't know the language or customs, to creating something real with your own blood, sweat, and tears.  THAT is what I'm fucking talking about, and whoever says I'm missing the point again: think a bit more for yourselves about what you really think that original post was about, and in regards to this message it's directed towards Mr. Brilliant and Impossible specifically. \n\nIf you don't like your life, have the guts to make some real changes, not give yourself to fiction.  We have wills and the ability to make subtle yet intricate changes in this world... what's the point of having the intellectual capacity that we do as humans if they are to be wasted killing pixels or harvesting digital gold?  Does it really make you feel good, or is it just numbing the feeling you get from being unable to say that your life isn't impossibly brilliant.  To simply have the chance to be alive A ALL, against all odds in a cold, black universe... and you say that moving images on the computer screen are real and move you to intense, life altering emotions?  \n\nTL;DR: Time to go outside, son.
