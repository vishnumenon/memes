{"body": "I really appreciate your eloquence, however I can't stress this enough: as usual, I see people describing the process of evolution/natural selection incorrectly. And it's EXTREMELY important to do it correctly when you go to explain it to these people, as it will make even less sense when they really try to break it down.\nIn point #1:\nJust look at our species; the only reason we evolved and became light-skinned (some of us) and hairless was because we began building shelter, wearing clothes, and moving permanently to colder parts of the planet. So, in short, why are we different? Evolution, natural selection, migration, intelligence, etc.\n\nYou phrased it all wrong, you make it sound like our evolution caught up to our intentions/surroundings. When in truth, species adapt to the evolution/deformations they end up with, they COPE with the changes. Examples: no hair, less melanin to help with sun exposure? Time to start making clothes and move to shaded/colder areas. The entire reason evolution and natural selection occurs is due to random changes in our DNA that can occur at early stages of our division, causing us to change in subtle, or dramatic ways. More often than not, if a change occurs it will result in death/miscarriage, retardation, cancerous growths in later life (late enough for you to reproduce usually, which is why cancer still exists). The stage the DNA mutates (or is already mutated) is important, ideally either the sperm or the egg already have the modified/altered DNA, thus the entire organism will have the same DNA as it grows from it's inception ( I N C E P T I O N ), but the DNA mutation mostly occurs during mitosis though, as the protective mechanisms that help prevent DNA mutation are nil during this process. Every time mitosis occurs there is a chance of mutation, which again, can lead to cancerous growths, but more often than not just a failed cell that will not matter.\n\nAnyways, sometimes these mutations result in something good, though that is rare and extreeemely lucky, but it's how we all came to be over 4 billion years or whatever. That's a long ass time for things to try/fail over and over and over, but hey it worked and it makes a lot of sense even with my shitty explanation.\n\nTLDR: species do not intentionally evolve into their surroundings, they cope with their mutations over long periods of time, they adapt and successfully reproduce. Your description of evolution gets this really wrong.\n\nThis is an important concept a lot of people like your friend struggle with and need spelled out for them. The way you phrased it makes it sounds like we magically stopped growing hair because we didn't need it or something. I promise you the lack of hair was not intentional or convenient, it was simply that those who didn't have hair were required to be smart enough to compensate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1283499165", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I need to hear and feel it in my head first.\n\nThe other thing is, instead of focusing on learning to play along with songs make your short term goal to learn the following chords:  G C A D E (and maybe F). The sooner you do this and can make the shapes with your fingers quickly, the sooner you will feel like a guitarist. \n\nFollowing that the *one* thing you can do, and perhaps the most frustrating for a newbie, is to learn Barre chords.

{"body": "While I don't agree with everything he says, he does raise a few good points:\n\n1) Self-reflection, taken to an extreme, becomes navel-gazing.  I know we take pride in being self-aware, self-correcting, and generally cognizant of our actions and their effects, but too much becomes banal and self-congratulatory.\n\n2) The desperate push for approval, seen in the likes of karmawhoring threads and comments, cheapens the conversation and the community as a whole.  **I N C E P T I O N** and the like adds absolutely fuck all to the site, and yet you can reliably expect to see such comments being very highly rated.  Here's what happens:  Someone makes a post, and a witty comment is given in response.  The comment gets upvoted, because everyone likes original humour.  Then all hell breaks loose.  People see these proto-memes as a good way to gain karma and, by misplaced valuation, acceptance.  They start spreading, and people upvote them because either they genuinely find it funny, or, more likely as time progresses, they feel doing so makes them a part of the group.  The same desire that makes people want to spread the memes in the first place leads people to ensure their propagation.\n\n3) Entropy is a fact of life, and all things eventually lose what made them good.  This process is accelerated on the Internet, where the rapid pace of change and the speed with which news travels ensures an exponential influx of new users who aren't a part of whatever original culture made something good in the first place.  The author was correct in saying how this happened to Anonymous.  Sure, /b/ was never good, but it was far more productive and fun when it was smaller.  The more people migrate to an online community, the more degradation occurs in the signal.  This is because there is a fundamental difference between those who seek out and find small communities and those who gravitate toward whatever is popular.  The former are generally trendsetters, the latter are trendfollowers.  The former create, and the latter consume.\n\nNow, I hope in explaining my third point that I don't come across as elitist.  If anything, I belong more to the latter group.  I'm not \"anti-newfag\", but we've seen this phenomenon occur too often to pretend it doesn't exist.  Only communities with heavy moderation, be it top-down or by the community itself seem able to avoid this.  Unfortunately, that very self-preservation tends to weaken the community's ability to create and thrive.\n\nShort of someone discovering a way to avoid both dilution and repression, I think that we, as users, creators, and consumers, must resign ourselves to accepting the limited shelf-lives of things we love.  Reddit will not endure as the community everyone loves forever.  Sooner or later, a competitor will emerge and the trendsetting creators will leave, the trendfollowers remaining--for a time.  Reddit's balkanization helps preserve the community to an extent, fostering islands of intelligent discussion and creative sharing amidst a sea of me-too-ism.  Perhaps hackernews or some such site will eventually take Reddit's place, but I do not deceive myself into thinking that this community we love will be around forever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1283835003", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Veigar is my favorite champ in the game. Let me help you out. You need mpen reds and quints, no exceptions. Summoner spells that are good on him are clarity, ignite, teleport, flash, and ghost. I usually get flash and ghost. I get yellow MP5 per level and blue CD reduction per level, those are more or less different depending on the your playstyle. Skills to get are Q E Q E Q R Q W Q W R W W W E R E E. Early on, lane defensively (let your ally know that you are not a threat early). Farm with Q and use E to keep yourself alive. Sapphire crystal and health pots are your first items, farm until you get a good chance to go back, grab your tear and boots and keep at it. Use E to land W, and fight at maximum range unless you absolutely have to get closer. E and W both take practice to use effectively, lots of practice will pay off. Get archangels after boots, zhonyas, then whatever you want. Lich Bane is great, but not useful until you really get the feel for him. Play him like the unforgiving 2 foot fury he is, here's how to one shot a squishy. Stun them, drop W on them, baleful them, then ult them. Time and time again I have taken people from 100% to 0% in about two seconds. Stay away from poppy, she counters you way too hard. If you ask me Veigar is the best champion in the entire game, capable of turning almost anyone inside out in the blink of an eye. Here's some screenshots to prove I know what's up. [1](http://imgur.com/n17ef.jpg) [2](http://imgur.com/oIb6h.jpg) [3](http://imgur.com/pDZEN.jpg) [4](http://imgur.com/GClzg.jpg) I have played over 200 games with him, I can help you if you want to know anything specific, feel free to message me. \n\nAs far as your build goes, be flexible. You can't decide on going the same items every time. Soul Shroud is a bad choice for him, don't go for only CD reduction. Blue buff is extremely useful on Veigar, don't be shy on taking it. I build him more of a glass cannon style, making my only defense red potion and the insane amound of damage I will hit you with if you get too close. Buying a ton of CD reduction items usually isn't needed, as I usually have blue buff, blue potion, masteries, runes, and somewhat often a 20 stack Mejais. One last thing, I highly suggest going flash and ghost. Positioning is everything with him.

{"body": "I was in a relationship from about 12/04 to 2/09. For the last ~2 years I was a wow-addicted mage. IMO, the first 6 months or so of the game are just awesome gaming fun - it's learning everything, then it was getting to max level as an all-consuming goal, then it was getting gear good enough to hit the next level of content, etc. I think I was somewhat artificially awesome because during the BC expansion, mages were in high demand to 'sheep' things, could craft much of the second-best gear in the game w/o raiding, and I played on a crap RP server so just maxing out the aspects of my toon (gear, spec, rotation, add-ons, profs, sheep focus macro lol, etc.) made me get a lot of positive affirmation. \n\nHowever, the game is now very boring to me unless I take a long break. The main problem is that I really want to burn only 1/2hr to an hour, but look at the clock and 2-3 hours went by. The game S T R E T C H E S time. The main draw now is purely the memes/lore/shared experience w/ other people. I talk to friends sometimes in emotes (/soothe) and we play, if not together, at least chatting and doing things we both know about and enjoy. I was a big gamer from age 8 to 22 or so, but I don't think I'd play anything anymore if there was no social component. Though I did have the depression/escapism stuff going on, it's not nearly as bad. If social video games didn't exist, I'd probably find some 'nerdy' book club or something. I just want to vomit when corporate types (what I play irl) talk sports or hipsters talk bikes and farmers markets or some shit, so I don't think I 'fit' irl. I don't really care... just want a few very close friends who feel similar and ideally one is a communicative, honest, and interesting female who is insanely attracted to me.\n\nWith the ex-girlfriend, I can offer some painful realizations I personally have had, though they may not apply in your case. We were each other's first long-term rel, and neither of us really knew how things should feel, so we didn't realize we were too dissimilar to be together. I tend to always want someone 'not like other girls' meaning more of a loner and laid-back like me. But almost all girls who are like this actually hate it... so helping her in her life, making her happier and growing actually meant pushing her away. We should have only been together maybe 6 months to a year, but it went 6 years!\n\nAt the time I started WoW I was in grad school and really wanted the life an old friend of mine has: married in a college town, working on a phd, gaming all the time, not really wanting for much, etc. I had left a high-stress job for school, and wanted a similar dynamic... but, life is path-dependent and you can't just jump over to different paths...\n\nUltimately in my case, I think the rationalization was that I would spend the rest of my life with her, because while I wasn't CRAZY about her, I'd decided she was probably a good fit for a weirdo like me because of her introversion, and also that I could never get/keep someone I was crazy about anyway. I felt I had the superficial 'hand' in the relationship, and it gave me some fucked-up sense of comfort and security. It was very wrong.\n\nIt was one of those relationships where fighting NEVER happens, because I think both of us had this subconscious knowledge that any real fight about real things meant we'd call it quits. We sensed how tenuous the whole thing was, but other parts felt so amazing and it was our first time down that road etc. So... I never truly raided, maybe a Kara now and then but I remember finally joining a good guild (was asked all the time) and going to do ZA. I'm top dps on the first boss, gf wants to go grocery shopping, I knew it was kind of this moment of truth, so I went grocery shopping and never did do much more Kara/ZA, and nothing else on that toon really.\n\nI only wrote all that in case you see similarities that might help you, though it was cathartic to get out in print. Also, a poster further down the page says he wants to maximize fun before schooling ends, which I think is likely a big factor.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1284048595", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

When the sections are too short (and of different lengths) the transitions are jarring because they are unexpected. You could try something like this (The |: and :| are repeats):\n\nC1 (no drums) C2 |: I (with drums) I A1 A2 A1 A2 B B B B C1 (with drums) C2 :|  I I C1 (no drums) C2\n\nOr, with each letter representing four measures:\n\nC |: I A A B B C :| I C\n\nI personally like to use the same thing at the beginning and end of a tune to create some symmetry — YMMV.\n\nThe other thing you could do is create a little more variety between the sections.

{"body": "I think it's important to explicate why it *is* important to convey meaning through a medium that demands a larger attention span.  \n**W A R N I N G:** Incoming Informal Argument!\n\nSo, why is a big long book a \"better\" medium than a few news articles? Why is there some mysteriously greater worth in a book than in a movie? What is it about the book that gives it the ability to convey more meaning?  It's because, all things considered, for a book to exist, effort has to be put into it. Even if you don't agree with the ideas in a large, well composed book, you still have to acknowledge that given the amount of time and effort that goes into creating one, the ideas simply cannot be discredited as poorly thought out. Certainly some of them can be poor, but you cannot have a book that contains no virtue of ideal. Even if the book is a compendium of the worst ideas throughout history, it still has to be big enough to justify being printed, which means that there is going to be a great many bad ideas in it. Given the sheer volume of information, even though it is information about what you might consider trivial or idiotic, there is still something to be said of the fact that there is such a large concentration of them. You are more or less bound to have some ideas of your own, if only you can make yourself sit through the rubbish. That's speaking of a book filled entirely with bad ideas, but how realistic is that? Any book you pick up will have at some point in it, something interesting to you personally. Say you read the headline of a news article, and it's about something that doesn't appeal to you; odds are, the article won't have even a touch of material relevant to your interests. However, if you pick up a book, even if it says \"1001 Ways to Trim Your Hedges\" and you don't *have* hedges, you could probably still find some history about hedges and perhaps (with a little scrutiny) some insight into psychological or sociological tendencies (why *do* people find their hedges so interesting, anyways?). So, to reiterate, books have value in the fact that, by their nature, they are nearly guaranteed to hold some relevant information at least.\n\nFurthermore, it is often not that a person does or doesn't like or read books that an advocate of book-reading would find objectionable. It can be the associated culture. Do I believe that someone *could* be a scholar, highly educated and sophisticated, without reading books? Yes. But I also see an undeniable correlation between people who do not appreciate the value of books, and the sort of people who do not appreciate intellectual pursuits. I'm toeing the line of a few red-herring type arguments here, but in a polarized situation (...\"I *do not* read books...), the party decrying the value of books can reasonably be expected to be the party less interested in the internalization of complex ideas. Now, someone could read everything wikipedia has on steam engines and learn about steam engines; but someone who read a book dedicated to the explanation not only of steam engine construction, but uses and history, would be the more educated about the subject. So why does it HAVE to be books? Because books DO contain more detailed and reliable information.\n\nLess solidly, there is a case to be made about the ability of a single larger piece of writing to contain more meaning (in this argument, directly correlated with value) than many small pieces of writing. If I had a hundred of the most knowledgeable people write a single sentence each (without collaborating), is it not reasonable to expect those hundred sentences to contain a smaller net amount of useful or relevant information than a single knowledgeable person writing, on this own, an hundred sentences? This is true only when we assume that the sentences thus proposed are only written on a single subject, and that there is at least an hundred sentences worth of information related to the subject. But suppose the individual sentences could be about anything, and the hundred-sentence composition could only be about a single subject. Which would contain more useful information? It is unclear and difficult to speculate about this matter (to me at least), but it does seem apparent that should one read a book, there is still nothing stopping him from reading smaller articles and publications. However, one who avoids books (or, simply does not see the value in them) *does* miss out on the complexity and, in some cases, art that is present in books.\n\nSo, why does reddit have a hardon for books? Because reddit strives to pursue the intellectual rigor that is only present in the reading and writing of book-scale-literature.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1284568321", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A little over a year ago my gf left me.  I was working part time at a non-profit because she made piles of cash.  I was able to walk to work and it was a nice place so it was good at the time.\n\nBut since she left me it was tough to make ends meet.   I had been looking for another gig constantly while selling all my toys and living in a dump, eating mac n cheese, etc.  I finally hit rock bottom financially, partially due to my friends all getting married.  Renting tuxes, doing bachelor parties had tapped me out.  \n\nA couple weeks ago I finally got that job offer that had eluded me after many \"It was between you and one other person\" phone calls.  Sweet!  Days later, last week in fact, I was gearing up to go to the wedding with my ex-girlfriend in tow since her new boyfriend was using her car.  This was not looking to be very fun.\n\nSoooo, I contacted a girl I had a huge crush on back in high school to see if the wanted to be my date to the wedding.  She new a few people attending and it was back in our hometown.  She sez sure why not.  This is awesome in many ways, not the least of which because she is smokin' hot.\n\nI get to the grooms dinner with the ex, and she's immediately put to work by the mom o the bride.  I begin funhaving.  The next day rolls around and I'm still funhaving and she's still working.  My date walks up (smokin' hot) and is pretty much universally adored by everyone.  We're dancing and having a good time, and she puts me in **F R I E N D Z O N E**.  Oh well, we keep drinking and having a good time, and end up closing the bar.  I didn't much notice that pretty much everyone had left already.\n\nAfter paying my ludicrously cheap 12 hour, $35 dollar bar tab.   We get a ride back from the bartender(who I apparently got stoned for the first time 13 years ago) to my parents house.  We crack open a bottle of wine, chat and **BOOM** broke the friendzone barrier.  We shagged till dawn in my old bedroom.  We were awoken a few hours later by my ex blowing up my cell phone, wanting to go back to the city.  The lady and I made out a bit and parted ways and started a hungover drive.\n\nThe ex bought me lunch and complained about all manner of crap on the way back.  I got home passed out, and woke up on Monday to start my new job.  The first email I got was about beer.  Left over cases of Blue Moon from a fundraiser that weekend for $10 a case.  Hellz yes.  There was cake too.  \n\nThis has been a good week.\n\n*tl;dr* Was poor and sexless two weeks ago, then swiftly got a new job, scored my high school crush, and scored cheap beer my first day on the job.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1284604380", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

However, those who have an advantage are *always* under the distrustful eye of those who don't.\n\nThe secret to success it to be absolutely as educated as humanly possible yet to make sure that your rivals and underlings are unaware of this.  Rush Limbaugh is not stupid.  Neither is Bill O'Reilly.  Yet they *play* stupid on TV because just like Animal Farm, demagoguery only works through peer appeal.\n\nI do not believe that George Bush is a clever man.  The people controlling him, on the other hand, were some of the best and brightest our nation has ever assembled (while also being among the least scrupulous).  George Bush was a populist through and through.  Barack Obama, on the other hand, makes no bones about the fact that he's perfectly capable of doing his own taxes.  As a consequence, the chattering class has seized on his deviousness, his two-facedness, his \"ivy league education\" - in short, his \"smarter-than-you\" demeanor as a way to convince the South he's a secret Muslim who works for Bilderberg or the Illuminati depending on who you ask.\n\nI've mixed a half-dozen seasons of Reality TV.  That means I get paid exhorbitant rates to sit in a room for ten hours a day listening to what psychologists call \"unreasonable antagonism\" and what most people call \"cabin fever\" happen in real time.\n\nIt's been invaluable from a human-learning standpoint, from a psychological standpoint and from a sociological standpoint.  Here's what happens:\n\n1) A and B live in a house with C D E F and G.\n\n2) A and B are friends.\n\n3) B says something that makes A feel as if B is a better person than A.\n\n4) A spends some time in self-loathing.\n\n5) A decides that it isn't A's fault, it's B's fault.\n\n6) A finds a reason, ANY reason, to resent B.\n\n7) A spreads hatred about B amongst C D E F and G.\n\n8) C D E F and G side with whoever they feel least threatened by - generally the stupider of the two.\n\n9)  The mob eats B alive.\n\nAlternatively, B has learned from a life of hard knocks that the *last* thing you want to do is give a person to hate *you* but if they're going to hate, the *first* thing you want to do is give them a target.  Every winner we've ever had has managed to be very, very clever while appearing very, very stupid.\n\nMy kids are going to be exquisitely smarter than your kids.

Nice to meet everyone!\nStory time.\n\nSee that big hole in the first picture? We went down there. Mintz08 didn't take his camera because it is a BIG freaking hole. Yeah, anyways. We're herpa derping down there when all of the sudden we hear this noise, similar to running water, except much, much faster.\n\nWe look around, and MrFroSir (the guy on the left with the black shirt on) is approximately 1.7 ft. from a rattle snake. Immediately you see this look of panic and intrest on everyone's face. Do we catch it? Do we run? We ended up moving very calmly back up into the day light.\n\nLater on we're feasting on delicious BBQ and out of no where probably around 20-30 coyotes start howling very close to us at our picnic pavilion. I've never heard them in the middle of the day before, but wow, they were loud. I think they may have been celebrating the capture of a rabbit.. ?\n\nAnyways, invite for future advice to anyone inviting redditors to your house.. it might be wise to always have a first aid kit on hand. We were lucky. This time.\n\nOn a more serious note, it was an awesome time and some great friendships were made. I look forward to visiting Huntsville soon and checking out the hacker workshop. Oh, and for those who didn't get a chance to come.\n\nD E C E M B E R  2 0 1 0\n\nBE READY!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1285684608", "subreddit": "HuntsvilleAlabama", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
