The meme then carried over to the film Inception. Whenever something confusing happens in Lost, and it cuts to commercials, the words L O S T appears on screen and zooms in. Therefore, whenever there is a mind boggling concept, you type it out in that format.\n\nThe second part of the meme originated in a post by philosopher David Hume (who was then a \"newfag\") to 4chan.org/sci/ questioning the validity of induction in interpreting causality. The post started a flame war, since induction was the prevalent thinking process during that time (it is rumored that Hume purposely \"samefagged\" using his alias \"Immanuel Kant\" to garner replies).\n\nSoon after, the /sci/ board, as well as most of 4chan, was split into two groups. Those who opposed Hume believed that induction was the ultimate truth and a way of life. Those who supported him called induction a \"fallacy, an evil concoction designed by [Scientologists] to befuddle our minds and contaminate our precious bodily fluids\" (this remark eventually lead to the infamous Scientology protests in 2008).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1286280449", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 166, "controversiality": 0}

[This site](http://members.shaw.ca/silvercircle/andthen/) details all of their songs, and breaks it down by tuning.\n\nMalkmus (the lead guitar/writer) says that the alternate tunings have a lot to do with their songs sounding unique, and keeping people interested.  When you pair an alternate tuned guitar with a standard tune rhythm guitar, it leads to some really great and full sounding chords, less overlap, and sounds that you might not otherwise get.\n\n90% of the songs out there are written in standard tuning, so it also has the benefit of giving you a new way to approach writing music.  Because a whole set of new patterns becomes easy for you to play with each new tuning, songs can come out sounding more unique.\n\nThey have some songs like [Rattled by the Rush](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7ClYxS4mQ) that sound simple (because they are from a fingering standpoint) but have a really unique tone to them.  That's the alternate tuning at work.\n\n[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFkea2P8d4) another example where it lets him effortlessly play some gorgeous but simple sounding descending scales.\n\n[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA81cd41qww) one that's got a minor tone to it, but the alternate tuning is letting him throw in some really funky notes that add depth and color to what might ordinarily be a boring song.\n\nEven simple power chord rockers like [Stereo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Log7DfzLLjY) benefited from the extra guitar being in D A D A B E.

{"body": "**P A Y  A T T E N T I O N   T O   T H I S**\n\nLast summer, from late June to late July (read: hot as balls) there was a [garbage strike in Toronto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1UQGeItGvY), a city of 4+ million people. Me and my room mates had no place to put our trash. No garbage chute, no garbage bins for are building, nothing.\n\nWe also liked to drink and were lazy about taking back empties. There was a fucking **infestation** of fruit flies. \n\nAfter the strike was over, the fruit flies were **all gone** within 2 motherfucking days. Here's what you do:    \n\n1) Get a small dish about 10cm across and 4cm deep   \n2) Fill it 1/4-1/2 way with **MALT VINEGAR**. In addition to being delicious on french fries, it's also stinky as hell.   \n3) Cover the top of the dish with cellophane   \n4) Put an elastic around the dish to secure the cellophane. Make sure it's taut - NO WRINKLES!   \n5) Poke 8-10 well spaced holes in the cellophane with a toothpick, avoiding the edges.   \n\nPut a few of these traps throughout the infested area. The flies will be all over the traps like stink on shit. The way it works is, the flies figure out how to get in, but the flies are too dumb to find a way back out. I've dealt with fruit flies a lot in my time, and this trap is **FAR** superior for the trap [TheBronx mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/dmubb/fruit_flies_before_date_fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/c11dstv).\n\nAnd you **HAVE TO USE MALT VINEGAR**.

{"body": "Okay, here's the text:\n\n&gt;Yo dawg, we heard you like yo-yos and Yo Dawgs so we put the yo-yo Yo Dawg in a yo-yo so you can yo-yo yo' yo-yo Yo Dawg while you yo-yo yo' Yo Dawg yo-yo Yo Dawg yo-yo dawg while yo' yo-yo Yo Dawg yo-yo dawg yo-yos, dawg.\n\nIt's parsing time!\n\nFirst, there's \"Yo Dawg\".  Notice the capitalization.  This is a direct reference to the meme itself.  But there are actually several memes represented if you look closely.  There's \"Yo Dawg\", which is the overal Xzibit meme.  Then there's the \"Yo Dawg yo-yo Yo Dawg\", which is the \"meme yo-yo meme\", or, to put it more clearly, \"the Xzibit meme featuring a yo-yo\".  This is going to require some extra clarification, and pulling these particular phrases out of the surrounding 'yo's and 'dawg's is crucial, so I'll be as clear as possible:\n\n* \"we heard you like . . . Yo Dawgs\" = we heard you like the Xzibit meme.\n\n* \"yo-yo Yo Dawg\" = an Xzibit meme featuring a yo-yo toy\n\n* Yo Dawg yo-yo dawg = the dog featured in the \"yo-yo toy\" Xzibit meme.\n\n* [to play with your] Yo Dawg yo-yo Yo Dawg yo-yo dawg = To play with a dog that is an image on a yo-yo, where a picture of that yo-yo was taken and pasted onto yet another yo-yo.  In this case \"Yo Dawg yo-yo\" is being used as a descriptor for the dog.  Which dog is it?  It's the \"Yo Dawg yo-yo\" dog.  That is to say, it's the dog featured on a yo-yo that is part of the Yo Dawg meme.  The descriptor is used twice, because the dog is not merely on a yo-yo, but is on a yo-yo that is on *another* yo-yo.  Thus he's the [Yo Dawg yo-yo] [Yo Dawg yo-yo] dog.\n\nIf you're still with me, I'm now going to take all of that and plug it back into the meme text.\n\n&gt;Yo dawg, we heard you like yo-yos and **the Xzibit meme** so we put **the Xzibit meme featuring a dog on a yo-yo** in a yo-yo so you can yo-yo yo' ** Xzibit meme featuring a yo-yo** while you yo-yo yo' **dog that is on two iterations of yo-yos** while yo'  **dog in an Xzibit meme featuring a dog on a yo-yo** yo-yos, dawg.\n\nThat's a lot of 'yo's, but notice that some of them are followed by an apostrophe.  The apostrophe indicates possession, and thus \"yo'\" is a shortening of \"your\".  Likewise, \"yo\" standing alone (unhyphenated) is a usually reference to \"you\" (which it's not used in the phrase \"yo dawg\", which is more like \"hey man\").  So:\n\n&gt;**Hey man**, we heard you like yo-yos and the Xzibit meme so we put the Xzibit meme featuring a dog on a yo-yo in a yo-yo so you can yo-yo **your** Xzibit meme featuring a yo-yo while you yo-yo **your** dog that is on two iterations of yo-yos while **your** dog in an Xzibit meme featuring a dog on a yo-yo yo-yos, **man**.\n\nThat's **still** a lot of 'yo's.  Specifically, \"yo-yo\" used as a noun, and \"yo-yo\" used as a verb.  I'll leave \"yo-yo\" as a reference to the toy, but replace the verb instance with \"play with\".\n\n&gt;Hey man, we heard you like yo-yos and the Xzibit meme so we put the Xzibit meme featuring a dog on a yo-yo in a yo-yo so you can **play with** your Xzibit meme featuring a yo-yo while you **play with** your dog that is on two iterations of yo-yos while your dog in an Xzibit meme featuring a dog on a yo-yo **plays** [with a yo-yo], man.\n\n**Y O D A W G**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1286553102", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 782, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Everything I'm going to write is true. You don't have to believe any of it. But, as a fellow redditor, I promise you that it is, in fact, true.\n\nAbout 3 years ago my doorbell rang. I opened the door and saw this girl (26) with her suitcase standing in the hall. I asked her how I could help her. She asked me if I knew if my neighbour was nearby. I didn't. I invited her in after she told me she wasn't able to call my neighbour because of the poor reception. She talked to my neighbour and found out he wasn't going to be back in town for the weekend. After the call we talked about here and there. A minute or two into the conversation she told me that someone got into her house and stole her panties from her bedroom while she was taking a shower. Flabbergasted, I asked her if she was okay and if she needed anything. She explained that she didn't have any place to stay, upon which I called my neighbour to make sure she was who was. After getting the okay from my neighbour, I invited her to stay for the weekend.\n\nWe talked for an hour or two, I cooked us a nice dinner and taught her how to use the television; I had a party to go to that evening. She declined my invitation.\nI went to the party and got home drunk with a fuckbuddy. The girl was sleeping, and I'm not sure if she heard us, but I'm guessing she did. We were having drunk sex; never pretty. (relatively relevant)\n\nAnyways, the next day we all have breakfast together after which my friend leaves. The girl stays on Sunday and Monday, as well. Sunday was relatively boring, we talked and watched television for a few hours. The next day she went to work and came back. Upon her arrival we ate dinner which I had prepared before she arrived. After dinner she asks me if I can give her a massage, I sit next to her on the couch and massage her shoulders, it's very asexual. After a few minutes she asks me if it's okay if she lays down. I tell her it's fine. She apparently meant on the bed. Sure, why not?\n\nWe go to my bedroom and I start massaging her while she's still wearing her shirt which she took off after a minute, saying that it's in the way. She took off her bra, as well, after which she laid face down on the bed. I start massaging her again, standing next to her. After a minute I tell her that it'd be easier if I sat on her. She said it's fine, and I massage her some more while sitting on her.\n\nI eventually start massaging her hips, she gets horny and we both take off our clothes.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting: She tells me she's a virgin.  P I Z Z A (full house half speed reference)\n\nI hadn't been with a virgin, and I wasn't particularly looking forward to it. All that blood, crying, pain and calls afterwards. No thank you. I don't want my face engraved in a mind for the rest of that person's life.\n\nSo I tell her that I don't want a relationship, and if that is what she wants, I'm not particularly interested. Yes I'm a dick, but I had to be honest. She tells me that she doesn't want a relationship, we have sex and she turns out to be really cool about the whole ordeal. Afterwards she tells me that she loved it, and if I would like to be her “teacher.” We ended up having sex a day or two a week. After a week or 3 she moved away a bit further, so we saw each other maybe once a month, which slowly turned in to never. I think it was mutual, really. We never talked after that.\n\nPs: I had no interest in having sex with her. Not that she wasn't attractive, she was. I offered her to stay for the weekend because I felt like it was the humane thing to do.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1286679337", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This might get you interested: \n\n\nThere is a game out there which is called Face of Mankind. Before I link you to it, let me tell you something about it from my own perspective. \n\n**F A C T I O N S**\nFace of Mankind is a game that is full PVP and fully in the players' control. The politics in the game, the relationship between the 8 factions, the economy, - it's all played out by the players. \n\n\nPlayers with different goals in the game finds their suitable faction in the start. \nPlayers who feels like getting rich by selling materials etc is their primary goal in the game, joins one of the economy based factions, as are Vortex Inc, Colonization and Mining Guild and Eurocore. \nPlayers who want to keep the peace in the game and dealing with dicks dicking around, joins either the Law Enforcement Department or the equivalent to the military in the game, Freedom Defense Corps. They are in charge of stepping in when some faction or faction department goes into a all-out war or a illegal war etc. \nOn the other hand you have your mercenaries and factions living outside the boundaries of the dominion law: Mercenaries of the Blood and Brotherhood of Shadows. \nLast one, which is the one I participated in, is the faction called Guardians of Mankind. It's a faction that focuses on solving problems though democratic solutions. Words before physical force. What we usually did was starting demonstrations if shit went bad. That was how we rolled. \n\n\n**Missions and stuff to do**\nThere are no \"quests\" in this game, and instead of Levels you have a system called Rank. You can get EXP to rank up by doing missions that your faction picks out themself, but you do not have to do these. They are a good way to get money into bank though as you get payed for it as well and taxes goes to your faction. \nYou can rank up to level 1 (from 0) by getting EXP but you won't rank up to Rank 2 before someone with Rank 4 pulls a switch. As you rank up you get a more demanding task in your faction and must pass some tests to show that you are up for the tasks. Most people never get to rank 3. A lot of dedication is needed. Therefor there is no need to try sit all day trying to feed your little EXP bar. \n\n\nWhen it comes to stuff to do, this is completely your choice. If you want to get involved with the politics in the game (which is definitively the hardest part to do as this is constantly changing and has over time become highly complicated), start doing guard controls of your colony or get into a department targeted at the market and profit, or do neither and just wonder off by yourself.\n\n\nThe game takes place in different cities on different planets. The cities are not huge, but that's alright since the game doesn't need big exploration fields as that is not the purpose of the game. In the game you'll find yourself building friendship and doing social tasks. No \"go to X and kill Y monsters\", that's not what the game is about. If you want to do that however, you can go to a planet filled with NPC monsters and have fun there, but that's just mostly social fun as you won't profit much by doing it. Again, this is a game about politics and forming a society. I think that is what makes this game, because *what is the reason and profit for doing missions for NPCs? There is no social recognition or appreciation for doing tasks for a bunch of polygons which has no self awareness.*\n\n\n\n\nUGh, there is so much I could write about this game, due to it's freedom. The game is dependent on players, because without players there are simply nothing happening in the world. I'm just gonna stop here though. Moving out today, and I have a lot of shit to pack. *sigh*\n\n[Video done by a fellow \"Gombie\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1X12lPw62w) This is completely conflict though.

{"body": "======== CORE RULES========\nAlmost everybody starts as human. If a zombie touches you, you turn into a zombie. A single dart hit anywhere on the body kills a zombie. Same for melee hits. Zombies respawn where they died after 30 seconds. Zombies wear red headbands so players know who is a zombie and who isn't.\n\n\n\nWe use nerf (or off-brand) foan dart guns and foam melee weapons for combat. No airsoft guns. MELEE WEAPONS MUST BE FOAM PADDED. NO PLASTIC NINJA SWORDS, TOWELS, CARDBOARD TUBES, OR OTHER HURTY IMPLEMENTS or you will be kickbanned. Also no pistol whipping with unpadded guns.\n\n\n\nHumans CAN:\n• Pick up other weapons and ammo that other players have dropped.\n\nHumans CANNOT:\n• Communicate using Cellphones.\n• Camp zombie corpses/respawns.\n• Communicate directly with zombies.\n• Use anachronistic items (such as light sabers).\n\nHumans MUST\n• Drop any guns and melee weapons they are holding when zombified.\n\n\n==HOW TO BE A ZOMBIE==\nZombies must tag a human player to turn them. Touching guns, melee weapons, equipment, loose clothing, etc. does NOT constitute a valid tag. When tagged by a Zombie, the human has 10 seconds of \"life\" to roleplay their demise (think 28 Days Later style). Roleplaying ideas: yell a lot, smear fake blood on your mouth, shoot yourself in the head, yell for others to shoot you, etc.\n\nHow Zombies Spawn:\nIt takes one hit from a nerf dart or one smack from a melee weapon for a zombie to be killed. Once killed, the zombie should drop to the floor. Zombies stay dead for 30 seconds, and respawn exactly where they were killed.\n\nTo respawn, the zombie player MUST stand up. Zombies are not considered back alive until they stand back up. Though not required, it is considered good sportsmanship for respawning zombies to make some sort of noise to let other players know that they are back in the game.\n\n\nZombies CAN:\n• Run at full speed.\n• Use Elevators.\n• Use Doors.\n• Go Up/Down Stairs.\n• Communicate with other zombies (using rough zombie voices!).\n• Ambush!\n\nZombies CANNOT:\n• Use Cellphones (neither can humans!).\n• Use guns, equipment, or melee weapons.\n• Talk directly to Humans.\n• Pick up or otherwise move teddybears or other game objectives unless otherwise noted.\n• Pretend to be humans or try to \"fake out\" the human players.\n• Camp elevator or staircase entrances.\n\nZombies MUST:\n• Wear a red headband at all times.\n• Answer truthfully when asked whether they are a zombie.\n• Answer truthfully when asked whether they are alive.\n• Be truthful if they got shot or not. Be a good sport! When in doubt, fall down.\n\n\n\nPlease Note:\n• Due to legal liabilities for the college, NO COMBAT ALLOWED IN STAIRS OR ELEVATORS!\n• Be respectful of the building. Do not open alarmed exits, break things, break into places, etc.\n• Don't be a dick. Have fun. Don't ruin other people's fun.\n\nCostumes:\nPlayers are strongly encouraged to come in a post apocalyptic or zombie costume of some sort. Costumes such as mad scientist, military, jin-roh, spartan, steampunk etc are also acceptable.\nSuggested Costume Props: Goggles, Gas Masks, Camo, Flashlights, Walkie-Talkies, Compass, Watch.\n\nPlayers are encouraged to:\n• Wear clothes that allow you full mobility and range of motion.\n• Wear clothes that you're ok if they get dirty.\n• Wear a Costume!\n• Bring good backpack.\n• Use modded guns/equipment.\n\nConflict Resolution:\nIn case of conflict, please try to reach agreement quickly so the fun can resume. Generally if there is a \"who hit first\" disagreement, we like to err on the side of the human being still alive. Rock-paper-scissors (best out of three) should be used to resolve most in-game conflicts where agreement cannot otherwise be reached quickly.\n\n\n======== PROCEDURE BEFORE FIRST GAME ========\nWe'll all meet in Red Square before the first game. All players will be given a red headband. Rules will be explained for any new players. Players who bring extra weapons will have time to give them to players who need them.\n\nPlay is split into Rounds. Rounds typically last one hour: 40min of actual gameplay; and 20 min of debriefing and setting up the next round.\n\n\n======== PROCEDURE BETWEEN ROUNDS ========\n1) All players will meet with moderators in either Red Square or the main open space of the Library before/after each round. There, they will debrief from the last game and prepare for the next game. Any major conflicts should be mentioned to mods at this time. During this time, game staff will be preparing the play area for the next game.\n\n2) The Zombie Draft: Before each round, 5-20 players (depending on how many players we have) will be chosen at random to be zombies. Players may volunteer to be zombies.\n\n3h) Humans will then follow the Human Moderator down to wherever the human spawnpointt is. There, they will be briefed with the rules for this round, background story, and clues to finding flags/completing objectives. Humans should take the opportunity to organize into groups and strategize.\n\n3z) Zombies will be led by the Zombie Moderator into the second floor open area of the library building. There, zombies will be explained the rules, given \"zombie makeup,\" etc. Zombies will wear red scarves to indicate to human players they are undead. Zombie players will then hide objectives.\n\n\n======== G A M E T Y P E S ========\nTeddybears and bloody baby dolls are used as props to represent various in-game items.\nIn all gametypes, the goal for zombies is to turn all humans into zombies.\n\n\"C L A S S I C\"\nThis is essentially a game of capture the flag and tag, with nerf guns. Think a simulated FPS and you'll get the idea.\nGOAL FOR HUMANS: find all hidden teddybears in the Library Building and bring them to the grassy knoll before the time runs out.\nGOAL FOR ZOMBIES: kill all humans!\n• Rounds last 40min.\n• The teddybear drop point is the grassy knoll on the other side of Red Square. Zombies cannot walk/run up the hill -- ZOMBIES MUST CRAWL ON THE KNOLL! If you are a zombie and are shot on the knoll, you MUST roll down to the bottom. However, anywhere else in Red Square is free game.\n• Rounds last 40min.\n\nS C A V E N G E R\nGOAL FOR HUMANS: Gather more objectives than the other human teams.\nGOAL FOR ZOMBIES: kill all humans!\nPLOT: Teddy Bears represent packs of supplies/food/etc in a post-apoc world. Humans players are split into competing tribes. Whichever tribe gathers the most bears to their drop zone (located outside) before the time runs out wins.\n• Rounds last 40min.\n• humans killed by humans from competing tribes respawn at their teddybear drop-zones outside (as humans again.)\n• Humans killed by zombies become zombies for rest of round as normal.\n• Zombies killed by humans respawn as zombies as normal.\nVICTORY REWARD: Surviving members of the winning team cannot be drafted for zombie duty next round.\n\n\nD E M O L I T I O N\nGOAL FOR HUMANS: \"Destroy\" the Library.\nGOAL FOR ZOMBIES: kill all humans!\nPLOT: The Library building is the source of the zombie outbreak. Teddybears represent time-bombs. Destroy the source of the zombie outbreak before the time runs out!\n• Humans have to plant the bombs, Red-Faction-style, in the right places (which will be marked) to destroy the building before the time runs out (or before everyone is turned!).\n• Rounds last 40min. After 40min, the bombs \"explode\" automatically.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1286841478", "subreddit": "zombies", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Actually I would argue that you have no choice.  The mode you are playing is determined  by the chord you are playing over. \n\nFor example, since you went with G major I will start there.   \n\nIt is typically better to think of the modes as flavors or colors than actual scales.\n\nAlso in your first post you said to learn all the modes in one key.  Well that is all good, but I have doubts that if that is the way you view learning the modes that you are not truly using them.  \n\nIn the key of G you have G A B C D E F# correct?  \nSo how i see people learning/teaching modes is this:\n\nG   Ionian  \nA   Dorian  \nB   Phrygian  \nC   Lydian  \nD   Mixolydian  \nE   Aeloian  \nF# Phyrgian  \n\nThis is very misleading...\n A dorian IS NOT in the key of G. No matter how much you want it to be, it just is not.  It has the same \"key signature\" true, but saying it is in the key of G is misleading.  A dorian and G ionian share only one trait: the notes they contain. (sounds alike but in music function is based on position. For instance G operates as the tonic in G major and as a b7th in A dorian.  These sound totally different and work differently as well.\n\nedit: I feel I have to correct myself.  The above way of learning modes does work.  It just doesn't give you a real idea of what they actually are.  It also implants false notions that they work like other scales.  It will help you learn the \"shapes\" of the modes at first though.\n\n\nInstead of thinking of dorian as the scale built off of the second degree of the major scale, think of Dorian as a minor scale with a major 6th interval.  \n\nMinor - 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7  \nDorian - 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7.\n\nIn this way we can look at A dorian as an A minor scale with a major 6th interval.  This helps us decide what chord to use to create A dorian, or over what chords will give us that dorian feel.  Now using your ears you will find that every mode has a distinctive \"flavor\" to it.\n\nThese flavors come from how each mode differs from its parent major or minor scale.  see below\n\nIonian      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 also the scale for major scale   \nDorian      1 2 b3 4 b5 6 b7  \nPhrygian   1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7  \nLydian      1 2 3 #4 5 6 7  \nMixolydian 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7  \nAeloian     1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 also the formula for natural minor  \nLocrian     1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7  \n\nNow we can see how dorian, phrygian, and aelioan are built from the minor degrees, and ionian, lydian, and mixolydian are built from the major degrees.  Locrian is very weird as it contains a b2 and a b5 making it very unstable.\n\nTry playing E dorian ( E F# G A B C# D) over Em7 vamp.  Another chord I like for Dorian is a _sus4_maj6 chord. (I like this chord because in E dorian it contains E - A - C#, giving a good base for the flavor of dorian. So a good Dorian progression may be E_sus4_maj6 - Em7.  If you continue with the thought process that E dorian is synonymous with G major, we see a problem here.  IF we now add a G major chord, we have fundamentally changed the base chord tonic (in modal music) to G.  Now no matter how you play those same notes, you will hear G major and never E dorian.  That's how chords define modes, and modes built from one key have no sound relation to each other except for key signature. \n\nOn impovising in E dorian... use the maj6(C#) as a flavor note.  Something I like in dorian is  bending that major 6th up the the b7th. \n\nAlso to anyone reading this... Don't become to pressed on or stuck in the rut of learning scales as \"shapes\" for to long.  It is very useful for visualization in the beginning, but eventually it is a good idea to know every note on the fretboard, and to be able to create the scales in your head with the intervals.\n\nIf anyone feels I have incorrect information please correct me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1287470132", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "edit: after reading this over, it sounds like I am attacking this.  That is not true, I am simply offering a different opinion and slightly more in depth look at the content in the previous post for anyone wishing to expand their knowledge of such things.  Nothing is incorrect in vasco's post.\n\nI am glad that you can understand where I am coming from.  Now I totally agree with you that people should not just \"attack\" modes.  I even go so far as to say that if you don't have a thorough understanding of the major scale (not just notes, but intervals, diatonic harmony, etc..) that you won't even understand modes.  Modes don't even work in the way we view music with a tension/resolution progression.  \n\nHowever, I will still say that there may be a few flaws.  Not that any information is technically incorrect at all, it just may give you ideas that become hurdles down the road.  I will try to explain.  And I am talking in reference to teaching a beginner.  These systems are only good if you have someone there to tell you these types of things that are not immediately obvious.  \n\nAlso,  I did think you meant E min and G maj pentatonic.  But it did give a good look into E major no? \n\nSo we start by learning the first pentatonic position. I started with E minor so Ill start there here as well.  So we take E minor pentatonic and we play the \"shape\" for a while.\nWhat have we learned?  Well if you listen to what you play you may have gained an insight into just how the notes you played interact with each other.  That is ultimately how I play and help others learn, is to make myself actually listen.  Now knowing that... you will develop for the \"feel\" a scale has.\n\nYou are right when you say E minor and G major are related.  But how is this true?  Well, they share the same key signature which is:\n\nG A B C D E F#  \nE F# G A B C D\n\nNow knowing this, and seeing at first how G major and E minor interlock on the fretboard may lead you to a ... not wrong, but maybe, incomplete? conclusion.  You would begin to think they have anything to do with each other.  \n\nLets say you are choosing to play in the key of G major.  You have a G major progression.  Playing the notes in G major.  Well you will hear G major no matter what, even if you play the E minor pentatonic shape, those notes are in G major and over a G major progression will never net you E minor. That is why I believe scale \"shapes\" to be limiting in the long run, or at least not realizing that crucial point.  !The scale you are playing depends on the notes it is made up of and the established context, not what scale shape you play on the fretboard!\n\nSee I wonder if it is just guitarists who begin to visualize things like this because of the fretboard? It is weird.\n\nThen, We get down to the point about movable chord shapes.  Playing through G major pentatonic I see an E major shape emerge? Yeah true... but, why on earth would it ever benefit to even think of it like that?  If you are in G major pentatonic, we should just think of it as a G major chord. It is good to know at first when you are beginning the physical layout of the chord on the fretboard, but it is G major and only G major. (not saying you aren't right, just that it does no good to think like that.)\n\nTo further elaborate my point, Take the \"next position\" at the 5th fret. xx5787 is the chord you are thinking of.  But again this is a G major chord.  Do you believe that by moving through these \"positions\" you are changing scales?  That is not the case unless the context is changing. But here we've gone and found all of the G major chords.  That's how CAGED works (I think) but it does it in a way I hope you see now is confusing and misleading to some degree.(Which Vasco said, but more for others w/o his understanding)  Not just in its portrayal of modes, but its inherent mental view of the fretboard.  You are only moving through \"Positions\" of G major pentatonic.  I can somehow see that this is what you are trying to explain, but it is very confusing approach in my opinion.  You never had any need to bring up e minor except as a \"shape\" which could also be explained as G Major pentatonic position 5(which also happened just hammering this home), if you had to think of it by shapes.\n\nHowever, I do believe you understand what I'm saying so this is more for others.  If anyone wants to discuss theory or anything about music I am more than happy.\n\nedit: about the 2nd \"mode\" of the pentatonic major scale... You wonder why it isn't called Dorian Pentatonic? (good question I think to, thinking in the right way.)  Well I would think it is because (and you can correct me if I am wrong.)  the Dorian scale built off of the 2nd degree of the major scale nets us this:\n\n1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7\n\nwhich is ultimately best thought of as a minor scale with that major 6th interval\n\nthe second mode of the pentatonic major scale gives us:\n\n1 2 4 5 b7 ( I .... think... )  So that is inherently a.) suspended tonality with no 3rd, and b.) dominant? can someone please tell me if this pentatonic mode is dominant due to containing that b7?  Can something be suspended and still be dominant? I wish I had my guitar!  Either way, This scale has some name... pentatonic something.  I believe it is neutral, but don't take that with much confidence.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1287498366", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not exactly.  If you wanted to solo in a mode you would first have to look at the mode, and its relation to its parent scale.  Lets do C major and D dorian.  We know D dorian is built off of the 2nd degree of C major.  But I think what confuses people is that playing a scale \"shape\" simply doesn't mean much without context.  \n\nYou need to define D as the tonal center to hear D Dorian.\n\nI like to view each mode as a flavor, or color even.\nTo me, Dorian sounds jazzy, reflective, inspirational sometimes.  To bring out this Dorian sound we should first start with a progression.  Now to really hear a mode, we will need to stay simple.  D dorian is a D minor scale so you could start off with Dm7 for instance.  Since Dorian is a minor mode with its distinctive major 6th interval with a b3 we could try a m6 chord (1 b3 5 6). However something I do is make it (1 4 6).  This would be a D sus4 with that major 6th (D/G.. what is the name of that chord?) . To keep the tonal context strong I like to stay at D.  So lets just do Dm7 - Dm6.  Now over this you should really use your ears to hear how each note plays against the chords.  In D Dorian:\n\nD E F G A B C, I generally see the 6th or B in this case as a good flavor note As that is Dorian's difference from the natural minor scale in terms of formula.  So abuse the D note, B note maybe try bending B up to C.\nNow of course you can do any progression that mirrors this. In Dorian, a i - ii, or even i - IV7 get used I believe.\n\nJust know that if your tonal center leaves D, you will no longer be playing in D Dorian.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1287537978", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I felt I should elaborate on that for those who don't know the difference.\n\nIn raster graphics (JPG, PNG, GIF, the majority of graphical data, really), you have a rectangular image made of pixels. This can be thought of as a n x m 2D array of numbers. Rendering the image boils down to decompressing/decoding the image and painting that bitmap on the canvas at the appropriate coordinates. You must realize this last step is, in essence, a memory copy (with a lot of overhead but a memory copy nonetheless).\n\nVector images are made of points and paths. To render it, you start with a blank canvas and draw each point and path on that canvas, in the order specified in the image. Why is this \"better\"? The most common reason is scaling, i.e. things don't get blurry when you zoom in. What's happening (in a naive implementation) is that a scale is applied to all draw operations `(x, y -&gt; (sx*x, sy*y))` and everything is redrawn. However, this makes zooming in measurably more resource-intensive. \n\nLast thing: you can actually see the drawing process with a file like [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Giza_pyramid_complex_%28map%29.svg).
