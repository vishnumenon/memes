{"body": "Depends on what you're looking for.\n\nClassical piano is much easier if you can drill any scale starting on any note - the runs in classical piano are all based off of a scale or mode.\n\nJazz piano can also benefit greatly from a finger-memory familiarity with scales, but you want to definitely drill blues scales, pentatonics, etc.\n\nOther instruments can benefit as well - scales teach you theory insofar as if you know by heart every note in the scale, then you know what notes are appropriate within a given chord structure.\n\nThe techniques for me are fairly simple: play the scale.  Just work your way up chromatically, play a C-major scale a couple octaves up and down, then C# major, then D major, etc.  Hanon exercises (example, in C, C E F G A G F E D F G A B A G F E etc.) are great drills.  Then practice dropping a chord in your left hand and playing the scale over it in the right hand (if you're a pianist).  \n\nThat help?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288653871", "subreddit": "Learnmusic", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

They're at least making an effort to understand where I'm coming from (with the intent of turning me back to Christianity because they don't want me to burn in Hell forever, which is sweet of them). \n\nI started by throwing logical fallacies at them, and that just did not work, like, at all: \"you believe in an omniscient, omnipresent, all-good God, right? Let's work through how that's impossible.\" No headway whatsoever.\n\nYou have to start with small things; little cases that people can relate to. Faith is a slippery thing to wrestle with and if you try to take on big issues people just find a way to bend their minds around them without actually thinking about them. It's nuts. I know exactly how nuts because I used to do it. \n\nI tried asking how they felt about mercy and forgiveness. They were like, \"oh yeah we're totally all about that, go Jesus!\"\n\nI responded, \"so that whole eye-for-an-eye concept of justice that's in the Old Testament, what's up with that?\"\n\nThey were all like, \"nah, Jesus got rid of that when he died for our sins. That concept is archaic.\"\n\nI was all like, \"kay. What's with that whole 'eternal damnation' thing then? I mean let's say I run outside and stab as many people as I can before I get put down by the police... Do you really think I could kill enough people to warrant ETERNAL DAMNATION? That seems a lil' harsh.\n\nThey replied, \"...\"\n\nThen when I asked why God would send Himself to a largely illiterate group of people in the Middle East rather than China and how that was fair.\n\nWe're still working on that, but progress is being made.\n\nEDIT: The actual dialogue may have been paraphrased.\n\nEDIT II: I just posted this somewhere else for a kid that's going to debate a minister. I thought it might help. It could be more eloquent, but you get the idea:\n\n* \nWhy did Jesus appear in the Middle East, rather than anywhere else, and how is that fair? If he goes the \"God's Chosen People' route, you can ask how a just God can have a 'Chosen People.'\n\n* \nI find a good follow-up to this is to ask what he thinks about ministry; namely, what happens to people that have never heard of Jesus. Do they go to heaven, or do they go to hell? Either way he is trapped. If he says they go to hell then his God is someone apparently not worthy of worship. If he says they go to heaven, then why preach?\n\n  If he says that they are judged by their actions, then you can hit him with all kinds of contradictions. Ask him first if a man would be judged by the standards Jesus set forth (that he cannot possibly know) or the standards of his society. Obviously he is obligated to say by the standards of society or his God is kind of an asshole.\n\n  Now let's pick a society, say Fuedal Japan. In Feudal Japan it was common practice for a Samurai with a newly forged sword to 'try it out.' By 'try it out,' I mean walk into the middle of a street and cut someone in half. If it cut them from the case of their neck through cleanly, it was deemed a good sword. Now obviously you didn't want as a peasant to get cut in half, but it was an honor and you were expected to go along with it.\n\n  Imagine now another peasant that sees a Samurai about to cut a man in half. He is expected to just continue on his way. That is what his society has taught. By the preacher's own admission, that man will get into heaven.\n\n  Now let's make things fun. Let's say that the man for some reason decides to intervene and throws a ninja smoke bomb or something and saves the other peasants life (the how is not important). Now he's done something admirable by Christian standards, but he's violated the standards of his own society. According to the preacher he is going to hell for that.\n\n  C O N T R A D I C T I O N\n\n  Now obviously he would not get into heaven or hell based on this one action, but you can pretend that he would act consistently in this manner. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288725787", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay. Quick Reddit-history lesson then.\n\nThis meme started with Lost. Remember Lost's title sequence? Yeah. You can see where\n\n&gt;**L O S T**\n\ncame from. This one was used specifically for when a comment thread hits an unexpected twist.\n\nFast forward a bit. The movie *Inception* came out around when *Lost* ended. People moved on to\n\n&gt;**I N C E P T I O N**\n\nAnd, being the punny bunch that Redditors are, we started playing with other words, like \"Deception.\" These were good too, like \"Intervention\" above, because not only do they fit the context of the comments, they also look/sound a little like \"Inception.\"\n\nBut then as the meme was dying out, we got hit by the Digg-refugee wave. I get the feeling most of them didn't know why words were being bolded and spaced out but picked up on the fact it's a meme. This is where most of the incorrect usage comes from.\n\nInstant_yoghurt's execution of the meme was pretty good, so he's getting upvoted. Although this meme was meant to die out a while ago, it can be fun to see old memes pop up once in a while, [as shown here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288751995", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Looks like probability homework!\n\n&gt; I am wondering what the chances are that I will get at least 1 of each A B C D if I pull 7 letters out of a bag with an infinite amount of A's B's C's and D's in said bag.\n\nIf they're present in the same proportions, it's the same as rolling a 4 sided die with faces A,B,C,D seven times and getting at least one of each.\n\nAssuming I haven't made an error (I haven't checked it)...\n\nThere are three different kinds of outcomes - we can count how many of each type and multiply by the corresponding [multinomial probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution):\n\nA. Three of the letters come up twice, and one comes up once:\n\nProb = 4. (7!)/(1! 2! 2! 2!) (1/4)^7\n\nB. Two letters come up once, one twice, one three times \n\nProb = 12. (7!)/(1! 1! 2! 3!) (1/4)^7\n\nC. Three letters come up once, one letter comes up four times\n\nProb = 4. (7!)/(1! 1! 1! 4!) (1/4)^7\n\ntotal probability = 0.5127\n\n(One way to check is to also work out the probability only one letter comes up, that only two different letters come up and that three different letters come up and add them all up - if they add to 1, you probably did it right)\n\nEdit: I just did a quick simulation in R as a reasonableness check:\n\n     &gt; table(replicate(10000,length(unique(sample(1:4,7, rep=T)))))/10000\n\n          1      2      3      4 \n     0.0004 0.0472 0.4385 0.5139 \n\nThe standard error of that last probability is about 0.005, so that's well within expected variability from my answer. So the answer at least looks reasonable. Doesn't mean it's right though.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288847291", "subreddit": "statistics", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The use of multiple `-&gt;` occurs because of currying, which allows you partially apply arguments to functions.\n\nFor a simple example:\n\n    add :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int\n    add x y = x + y\n\nNow, if we only supply one paramter, we get\n\n    addThree = add 3\n\nwhich is of type\n\n    addThree :: Int -&gt; Int\n\nAnd if we supply another one, we get\n\n    four = addThree 1\n\nwhich is of course of type\n\n    four :: Int\n\nIt may seem strange coming from, say, a C-like background, but add can be written of type\n\n    add :: Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Int)\n\nwhich means `add` takes one `Int` and returns a *function* that takes another `Int` and finally produces a value.\n\nThis also means essentially that any function only takes one thing and always returns only one thing. So something like\n\n    addAllThese a b c d e = a + b + c + d + e\n\ncan be said to have type\n\n    addAllThese :: Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Int))))\n\nwith the whole `(Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Int))))` being one big function that returns (a function that returns... etc.). And can be used like this:\n\n    ((((addAllThese 1) 2) 3) 4) 5\n\nBut the parenthesis are a bit cumbersome. And since these functions only take one argument, it's easy for Haskell to see in, say\n\n    addAllThese 1 2 3 4 5\n\nthat `1` is being applied to `addAllThese`, which then returns a function, and then `2` is being applied to that, etc., until the whole thing is just of type `Int` without any arrows (the value `15).\n\nHope that helps. If not, there's another section of LYAH which gets into [curried functions](http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions) in more detail.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288970157", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let's turn all of this around on you, you self centered, immature human being.\n\nI have no real friends.  The people who call me a friend are all losers.  Girls don't lavish me with attention.  They won't strike up a random conversation, even though I've never started one myself.  I don't sit next to girls because they intimidate me.  I don't ask my room mates to go anywhere with me.  I'd rather have other people plan all the fun shit to do.  Figuring that shit out is too much effort.  I don't try in school even though I am damn lucky to be here.  I am a very uninteresting person.  I don't smile at girls and creep them out.  I don't put any effort in to offering something to a conversation.  I hate fat people.  And short people.  I am a bottom feeder.  I constantly have negative thoughts about all of the people around me.  I am lazy and feel I shouldn't have to contribute to society.  This is true even for a society that has given me everything and asked for almost nothing in return.  I'm too lazy to go to the gym to build some muscle.  I rejected the one girl who showed interest in me.  I assume I have my life figured out and can see the future, even though I can't figure out my own happiness today.  People were wise enough to avoid my swirling pool of negativity, incredibly they could detect this even as little kids.  I hate ugly people.  Maybe taking up a sport will solve my problems though... but nah that sounds like too much effort.  I want to punish myself for no reason by staying in a program that I hate, so I can get a job that I'll hate.  As time goes on I grow resentful of everyone else's happiness; it is probably their fault I am not happy.  I am a very selfish person.  Other people should put effort into making me happy.  Tomorrow I absolutely won't go out and try to build a relationship with another human being.  Instead I will complain to strangers on the internet about how much life sucks.  I expect a real human relationship to fall out of the sky.  A girl thinks I am so negative she won't even ask me a casual question.  I think I'd actually be happier without other people in my life.  Maybe then I could finally find a way to be happy.  Other people are probably the reason I am unhappy.  Maybe if I get dramatic about my self inflicted situation, people will give me some attention if out of nothing but pity.  I hate most other people, including my family.  I hate old people.  I hate positive attitudes.  If I were a girl I would have more opportunities.  I don't care that my family would miss me, they aren't worth much anyway.  I live in the richest country on the planet and make more at my easy, mindless job than 95% of the people on the planet, yet this isn't enough money for me.  My dad should have given away all of his money to his family, especially to me.  I want other people to entertain me.  Money would solve my problems.  I expect my room mates to be my BFFs and wingmen to get me a ton of girls.  I am lazy.  I am glad that I've always been miserable because I get off on being a victim. I I I I I am the only one who matters in my self centered world.  Everyone look at ME!\n\nSORRY FOR THE HUGE BLOCK OF TEXTS FRIENDS OF REDDIT", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289131481", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**I N C E P T I O N**\n\nBut in all seriousness, I played Bowser's Inside Story from start to finish and it definitely *wasn't* crap. I honestly don't know what the author is talking about when he goes on to state that leveling up and getting new equipment means nothing in the game when it actually means whether or not you end up dead, just like in any other RPG. And he goes on to rag on the special attacks which he said you never need, but then goes on to say in the comments that he never used them because he was really bad at executing them. I thought the special attacks were fun and original and the only time you don't need to use them is if you've over-leveled and want to spend a much longer amount of time in a battle by buying a million mushrooms to heal yourself with and only using the basic attack options to deal damage.\n\nRegardless, I'd like some specific examples of how this game is \"broken\". His argument is so wishy-washy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289342994", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I might be able to help, I'm English. If not, I apologise (mostly because I'm English!) I've italicised the mistakes, cool story bro, someone should make a series out of it ;)\n\n    Previously, on ...\n\n**P E R D I D O S**\n\nAfter ten days in Sydney, we had to take our plane back to Los Angeles. We had a great summer *in* (minor writing style/syntactical issue, your teacher probably won't notice) Australia, and it was time to *go* home.\nAt first, we had no problems with our *journey* (I know what you're trying to say but you can't say it in English in one word): we packed our luggage, *went through* check-in and boarded *no need for to* our plane. *The* (redundant words) plane took off, left Australia and *soared* into the clouds. It was a smooth flight most of the *way* (think distance, not time for long journeys): I had a nice lunch and was going to *sleep for a while*.\n\nIt wasn't until 5 o 6 hours into our *flight* when the plane began to *shake*. I thought it was the usual turbulence and *went* back to sleep, but it carried on to the point *where* I *was awoken* (past tense) and started to fear for my life. I could see the oxygen masks *dropping* and pieces of luggage flew around. The turbulence shook the plane for 5 minutes, but suddenly everything turned calm.\n\nAnd then... the plane started to break up (more dramatic, for extra credit you should describe what you see - the noise, the shaking, the separation of the nose, the tail section splitting off behind you, the island up ahead and then... and then... black).\n\nThe heaviest whirlwind I can imagine came into the aircraft as *we* lost the tail *section*. That was the last *thing* I *remember* before *the suitcase hit me* (needs to be more direct).\n\n*I woke up* (more dramatic) *and looked around me*, I noticed I was lying on sand. I sat up and stared at what was total chaos to me; rubble everywhere, dead bodies, people crying or yelling while some were unconscious. The huge engine of our plane *lay* (past tense) in flames just 5 meters from me.\n\nThe landscape described a heavenly island, but to me and the other passengers, it was *hell on earth* (more dramatic).\n\nYour English is fantastic, you made one or two grammatical errors but overall I'd give you an A grade. Spanish speakers often have the same problems with English (got instead of the various alternatives, occasional inappropriate choice of words) but you did really well and should be proud. I hope your teacher enjoys reading this as much as I did.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289346810", "subreddit": "lost", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First of all, for p and q prime, Z pq = Z p x Z q, but Z pp != Z p x Z p (here, the = sign represents \"isomorphic\"). A generalization of this notion states that for integers n,m that Z nm = Z n x Z m iff gcd(n,m)=1 (in whatever algebra book you are using, I am 100% sure this is a theorem somewhere in the book). With this in mind, we can begin to decompose the possible isomorphism classes of Z 60. \n\n60= 2 2 3 5. So we have to keep the 2's \"together\" since Z 2 x Z 2 != Z 4. So in the book's list:\n\nZ 60=Z 15 x Z 4 = Z 3 x Z 5 x Z 4 = Z 12 x Z 5= Z 20 x Z 3\n\nAll work, since the order of each group in the direct product is relatively prime to the order of every other group in the product. In your list, you can see that Z 2 is in each product, and there is either a group Z n with 2|n or another Z 2, and thus *none* of the groups you have listed is isomorphic to Z 60.\n\nNow we have one more consideration. Has the book considered all possible groups isomorphic to Z 60? Well, 60 has a prime decomposition involving 3 primes, and we know the 2's are \"stuck\" to each other. So we can have a direct product of 3 or 2 different groups. For a product of three groups, it can only be one group, which is listed. For the product of two groups, since there are only 3 power-of-prime elements, there are C(3,1)=3 choices for which group to leave by itself and collapse the other two into a bigger group. Thus, there are only 4 possible groups isomorphic to Z 60, and thus the book has listed all of them.\n\nHope my explanation is clear!\n\nEDIT: Removed  Z 6 x Z 2 x Z 5 from list of isomorphic groups to Z 60, and added missing Z 20 x Z 3", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289509562", "subreddit": "cheatatmathhomework", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, actually I have. And that was one of the things that I found astounding. Many people found Vista to be painstakingly slow. Win7 was heralded by many for being (or at least appearing to be) much faster and overall more responsive. \nSo when one of my customers needed a new computer I made her wait until business computers (HP, Fujitsu and Dell have consumer and business lines) with Win7 came out. When I set it up for her I was so disgusted by the speed. It was s l o o w w. Even though it was a modern machine. Utter crap IMHO. But Windows 7 unfortunately is the way to go if you are married to the monopoly. \nMaybe that story about 7 being responsive came from people that bought cheap Vista machines when it came out and had to wait for their computer all the time. When 7 came out (and was about as bloated as Vista, since Microsoft decided not to add bloat for that version) cheap computers for Win7 were 2 years along those of Vista. Without added bloat those ran a lot faster.\nI guess that is where the myth of a responsive Win7 comes from.

{"body": "I'm not saying I'm personally against file sharing, but there is in fact a huge difference from borrowing a movie from a library and downloading a pirated copy.\n\nThe movie at the library was paid for by somebody, and there only exists a single copy of it. It has the attribute of \"property\". You can trade the property from a library to an individual and then back again, but there's still only 1 movie which was bought and paid for by someone. Scarcity is maintained, and if 100 people all want the movie at once, then they'll have to go buy a copy if the library is all out or the library will have to buy more copies.\n\nWith file sharing, you have 1 legitimate movie which is then copied to 1,000,000 people simultaneously. There is no \"property\" to borrow. You are simply creating limitless copies and removing any scarcity that exists. You are stealing value from the content creators.\n\nYou might disagree with what the content creators on the value of their content, but to act as though if no one ever paid to watch a movie their industry would still exist is absurd. Likewise for software, games like Black Ops take a lot of time/money to produce, and so does software like an operating system. There is some argument to be made that the RIAA is an old dinosaur that can go die because artists can produce albums in their basement and then just hire advertisers to promote their product, but the fact is that for industries outside of music, big productions like\n\n **I N C E P T I O N** take a lot of money to make and if no one pays the creators of this content or the actors or the people that work on the set, then stuff like this stops getting made.\n\nIt is a false equivalence.\n\nedit: That said, I do not agree with the content creators that 1 download == 1 lost sale. I've downloaded lots of stuff that I would never buy. Truth be told, the best thing the content creators of various industries could do is embrace the demand that people have. They want inexpensive, DRM-free access to movies/TV shows that they can download directly and watch whenever they feel like.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289855088", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

In the ’60s, artists, writers, and Hollywood stars kept Puerto Vallarta as their secret “getaway.” Enjoy the sights, sounds, and fantastic ambiance only found in this charming seaport. \n\nCabo San Lucas—Located at the southernmost tip of Baja California, where the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Cortés meet at Land’s End, Cabo San Lucas is home to some of the best sportfishing in the world. Explore waters teeming with marine life on a snorkel, dive, or kayak adventure. Or indulge in a short boat trip to see the majestic rock arches, Los Arcos. Take a whale-watching tour and search for the many different types of whales that migrate toward the warmer tides of the Sea of Cortés.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289904783", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I assumed that he was a premiership fan. Saying that La Liga is somehow different because it´s a two horse race now would imply that the  Premiership somehow isn´t. There is always a lot of talk about the big four but honestly every year it ends up being a fight between 2 teams (usually man u or chelsea).\n\nLet´s put some non random numbers on the table, the premiership changed a lot about hte English league so let´s compare it since that point:  Champions of the premierleague since it´s **I N C E P T I O N** in 92-93 Manchester United (11), Chelsea (3), Arsenal (3), B.Rovers (1)  \n\nChampions of La Liga since 92-93: F.C.Barcelona (8), Real Madrid (6), Valencia (2), Atlético Madrid (1), Deportivo (1).  \n\nThat´s 4 champions vs 5,  an interesting thing happens though when you compare both leagues; it seems as though the history of the premiership would indicate that there has only been 1 true dominant team in England, Manchester United.   \n\n\n\nBut wawin, common, when was the last time valencia or anybody like that won the title? Indeed, that is a problem, I won´t deny that at the moment La Liga has a problem at the top, but to suggest that it´s not competitive is downright absurd.  Let´s focus now on 04-05 to 09-10, the period of RM Vs Barcelona dominance.  That´s when both teams started dominating the rest of the League.  We have 4 leagues for F.C.Barcelona and 2 for Real Madrid.  How does the big 4 competition go this time? 3 Leagues for Chelsea and 3 for Manchester United.  Woops. \n\nSo anyways, could we just cut the shit out about how La Liga is the only two horse race? It´s a stupid argument put forth by tv stations to get you hooked to your particular league.  If you look closely all of the top leagues are being dominated by 2 teams at the most, the third or forth contender usually fall by the wayside by christmass.  It´s not simply a problem of La Liga, or the Premiership, it´s happening all over Europe and it´s a big problem.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289918516", "subreddit": "soccer", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The same view I've had over the entire issue and have repeated countless times.\n\nI'll sum that viewpoint up again. \n1) She is responsible for the pregnancy, she was not inseminated against her will. The fact that she is a carrier of a genetic defect and wished to never have children means taking responsibility would be to permanently prevent that chance form happening. Condoms fail 1 out of 100 times and clearly this is not responsible enough.\n\n2) Posting it on reddit and then complaining about the backlash received is NAIVE, wherether you agree or not.

And then, I show them my resumé (with my current nearly-finished major on there) and I follow their eyes down the page. They like my work history, they like my background... and then they see that I'm an Anthropology major, and I'm pretty much shown the metaphorical door.\n\nSeriously man, don't do this. It's not worth it. It won't be worth it. I'm $40,000 in debt after I graduate, I won't be able to get a job, this is the worst economy of all time, and I'm seriously freaking out a little bit right now because I have zero options ahead of me.\n\nSeriously.

I've tried to like it (pretty much every other Coen Bros. movie is on my favorites list) but it just feels, as you stated, \"boring\" and incomplete (I didn't like how it ended, but i had pretty much lost interest by that point. The silenced shotgun took me out of it too; no shotgun silencer is that effective). \n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n ok people, I mentioned the shotgun thing as just one minor point (it probably got me more engaged in the movie, since i was actively critiquing it) and I now realize i should have described it as such. I'm not going to disregard a movie just because it isn't perfectly realistic.  \n\nI re-watched it last night, and while I did think it was better, it still felt like it was about a half an hour too long. Though I don't know how they could have made it shorter without leaving some character development.\n\nanother nagging point (but not something that i would denounce it as bad) is that the humorous parts of the movie felt too similar to older Coen Bros movies. That may be their *style* but I would have liked it more if they had tried to either increase or decrease the humorous moments. It leaves the movie feeling awkward.

Use this time to get two rows of sunflowers, and then buy some spitters.   \n\nhere is how my set up looked:  \nkey: S= sunflower P= spitter F= freeze plant V= Stranglethorn Vine R= Rock \n\nS S P F S R and then free space for pumpkin bomb  \nS S P F S R and then free space for pumpkin bomb  \nS S P F S R and then free space for pumpkin bomb  \nS S P F S R and then free space for pumpkin bomb  \nS S P F S R and then free space for pumpkin bomb  \n\nDo this and you should be fine for the last two levels. The final boss takes about 5 pumpkin bombs to kill but you need to get your formation set up first, don't just save for pumpkin bombs.\n\nEnjoy your singing sunflower.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1290782954", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}
