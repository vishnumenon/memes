{"body": "Chapter One; A Perfect Beggining\n\nI gave birth to Renesmee over four years ago now, the agony she put me and Edward through, both physical and mental was haunting - but I don't think I could have had a more perfect child. That afternoon was the absolute worst and best in my entire life and that was a quite a tall order. I had humanly died that day, but now I felt like my whole entire life had begun on that day. The time when I was bed-bound at the Cullen's because of my little nudger were so torturing for Edward; I couldn't describe what it did to him in words because his depression was far beyond them. The guilt he felt must have been unbearable to live with and my internal pain felt like a minor problem to me next to the state that it left him in, that I left him in. My stupidity - or what I called instinct at the time - had so nearly killed me and I knew that if my heart had ceased forever then, that if I had fallen into a never ending unconsciousness, he would have perished with me. I truly couldn't imagine this world without him. Never mind a world without him that was my entire fault. What haunted me the most was the fact that he was willing to die with and for me, and he always would be, no matter how many times I tried to persuade him otherwise. He would never have forgiven himself for my death if I had not been saved by his burning venom, or forgiven Renesmee for that fact. Sometimes I wondered how I had, though it was never a fault of hers what had happened to me &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;she had sped up the fulfilment of my ultimate wish - my transformation. However, I don't hold grudges. &lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;My life was so perfect now. It was like this was why I had been born. To be placed in this fantastical whirlwind. Sure, there were the ups and the downs but how boring would everything be without them? If I had to live my life as a human, never discovering this secret world that lurked in the shadows of reality, I would have married an ordinary man, followed an ordinary routine every single day and then died an ordinary person. After my first taste of what I could have, of what I could do with my life, there was no going back. Edward was so determined to change my course but now I had something I could relate that feeling to. My first experience of this world that drove me so hard to get what I wanted was like a droplet of shimmering human blood, it started a mad frenzy. My success still filled me with elation - this was who I was born to be, this was the part I was destined to play.&lt;br /&gt;The two anchors of my life were stood before me, braced for what had now become a fairly regular feature on our schedule. &lt;br /&gt;\"You actually aren't going to give up are you, darling.\" &lt;br /&gt;Edward replied to me with a breath-taking expression, \"I don't give up that easily, you should know that Bells.\"&lt;br /&gt;It took me a moment to gather what he'd said, to unearth the amount of truth and meaning in that one sentence. It took my supposed suicidal death to stop him from his attempts of keeping away from me - death. I swallowed suddenly and brushed a lock of my hair softly from my cheek. &lt;br /&gt;\"Ready?\"&lt;br /&gt;Their eyes narrowed as they glared competitively at each other, and then softened instantly as they laughed in beautiful harmony, bending further towards the swaying grass below them.&lt;br /&gt;\"To the border and back!\" I had to laugh at how tense Edward was as he crouched closer to the ground; he was &lt;i&gt;acting &lt;/i&gt;more like a child than she was and she was four! \"Three, two, one...\"&lt;br /&gt;Edward shot of into the trees out of the comfort of the meadow and into the threatening darkness of the forest that surrounded us.&lt;br /&gt;\"Hey, false start Edward!\" I yelled after him, taking a couple of steps along his trail. \"Get back here! I'm warning you!\" &lt;br /&gt;\"Don't sweat it mom, I could catch him any day of the year!\" Renesmee grinned and turned elegantly on her heels to shoot after Edward like an unstoppable bullet from a gun. &lt;br /&gt;I sat down with my legs crossed and lay back. The colourful wildflowers bent sideways to make way for my slender body and then closed around me like a protective blanket, bobbing with the cool breeze. With their speed I only had two minutes to myself at the most, if that! My fingers wound themselves into the grass like they did in Edward's hair and my eyelids slid shut as I breathed in the delicate fragrances that swum in the air around me. It was only too easy to let myself slip into daydream. This meadow would never be the same as our meadow back near Forks but it would always hold a part of us, all of us. Ever since we had left Washington an exact year from Renesmee's birth, I had never returned. Though the longing to revisit the places from my past was incredibly large, they would bring back such perfect memories from my human life if I was to see them again. The very first place I saw Edward at Forks High School, the place I discovered the mythical truth that made my life how it is today, the place he proposed to me formally (and I had predictably been unable to refuse) and the place I'd married him. However, along with those memories, there would surely be memories that would be unearthed from the lower moments of my life. Where Edward had left me all alone on the winding forest path, where James had started to hunt me down, craving desperately for my death simply for his own pleasure and where Edward had fought Victoria, twisting and turning at an unbelievable speed while I watched on, utterly helpless. However, the worst thing, had been leaving Charlie and Renee and knowing that I wouldn't see them again. We'd agreed between us that it was just too dangerous to involve them in this when we still had groups of blood craving enemies fighting to end our existence. Not if they were human and they were both staying human. I wouldn't tug them into any single part of this, I may have been created to follow this path but my natural parents, definitely were not. I did have Carlisle and Esme now, they were amazing but somehow, I'd always feel that something wasn't right. Maybe that would change in a couple of decades when the ones I knew were my true carers were... dead. Alice would watch out for their futures but we would leave them untouched unless absolutely necessary. I could finally understand why Edward had been so reluctant to change me. The thought of taking away their humanity and plunging them both into this blur of constant threats and fantasy was unbearable to even imagine for a single, lonely second. \n\n\n\n**P R O B L E M ?**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1291697902", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Or your line is just heavily stacked to one side and you run the ball that way. Also (and this was my favorite) You had the wing fake to the right, then run behind the line and grab the ball from the Tailback and run it back up the weak side, like a weakside counter sweep or something. We ran this in high school when we went to 8-man and it was effective for a while. \n\nI do love to see how the pros are using it with 11 guys, though it hasn't been as effective as it was in 08 and 09.\nEDIT: I'm not great at formatting so pretend the wing back is playing next to the Tight End just a step back.

How many semitones are in a fourth? Five. Each fret is one semitone. Moving five semitones (frets) up the neck is the same as moving one string over. So the notes at the fifth fret are just the same as the notes on the next string over. Fifth fret of the sixth string is A, fifth fret of the fifth string is D. Again, this breaks down at the B string.\n\nSo what's the deal with the B string? It's only tuned a major third above the previous string. Everything I've already said applies just the same to the B string, but it's shifted by one fret. Want to see something that will blow your mind? Play an E-major chord. Now play an A-major. Now play a D-major. Each chord is a perfect fourth higher than the last one - each root note is one string over from the previous. Examine the shapes of the chords - each one only differs by one semitone from the last one - and that moved semitone only occurs on the B string. Each chord is the same shape, it's just been shifted when it crosses over the B string to compensate for the different tuning. If you had a guitar tuned in all fourths, you could play those three chords using the exact same chord shape. \n\nBut I digress.\n\nMore tips:\nLearn the notes on the E strings first. Why? Because if you know all the notes on the low E string, you know all the notes on the high string, just two octaves up.\n\nKnow how to play an octave from any note. The most common octave shape is easy to remember - it's a capital 'L'. Two frets up, two strings over. If you know how to play a note on any of the strings, you can find it an octave up without moving your hand along the neck. This needs to be changed when you cross over the B string, but I'm sure you can figure that out now.\n\nAlso worth noting: Every note on the D string is a major ninth (octave + major second) above the same fret on the low-E string. That is, to find any note on the D string, just go two strings and two frets (an octave) lower.\n\nFinally, get some sheet music for a song you like and practice, practice, practice. Classical pieces are good for this (and it's much much easier to find sheet music for them).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1291916833", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

(C) Summary: Tullow Oil claims senior Ugandan government officials were “compensated” to support the sale of a partner/rival firm’s exploration and production rights to Italian oil company ENI (ref. A). Tullow Vice President for Africa Tim O’Hanlon identified Security Minister and National Resistance Movement (NRM) Secretary General Amama Mbabazi and Energy and Mineral Development Minister Hilary Onek as Ugandan officials who benefited from the sale of production rights by Heritage Oil and Gas to ENI. He requested U.S. assistance in ensuring the open and transparent sale of oil assets. If Tullow’s allegations are true - and we believe they are - then this is a critical moment for Uganda’s nascent oil sector. The Heritage-ENI sale will likely derail any potential partnership between Tullow and Exxon Mobil and have profound consequences for transparency and openness in the future management of the industry. End Summary.\r\n--------------------- \r\nSeeking Partners\r\n--------------------- \r\n¶2. (U) On 14 December, Tim O’Hanlon, Tullow Oil’s Regional Vice President for Africa met with Ambassador Lanier to discuss recent developments in oil exploration in Uganda (see ref. A for background). O’Hanlon explained that the $10+ billion required to produce, refine, and export oil from Uganda far exceeds the financial capacity of Tullow and other mid-sized exploration companies currently working in Uganda. Tullow is therefore considering selling a portion of its Uganda holdings to a larger international oil partner, and has unofficially “short listed” three major companies as potential partners - including Exxon Mobil, Total (France), and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC). After Tullow concludes its process of selecting a partner, likely in January or February 2010, Tullow will present the “bids” to the Uganda government and work with Ugandan officials to gain approval of the much larger oil partner.\r\n--------------------- \r\nAn Oily Business\r\n--------------------- \r\n¶3. (S) In contrast, O’Hanlon said the recent effort by Heritage Oil and Gas to sell its oil exploration and production license to ENI was apparently a corrupt back door deal. O’Hanlon observed that since news of the ENI sale broke, even Ministers unrelated to oil (such as Minister of State for Fisheries Fred Mukisa) have issued public statements supporting ENI. O’Hanlon alleged that Security Minister Mbabazi and Energy Minister Onek received payments from Heritage and/or ENI in exchange for their support. O’Hanlon referred to Minister Mbabazi, who facilitated an August 2009 meeting between ENI and Tullow, as ENI’s “patron” in Uganda, and said ENI created a shell company in London - TKL Holdings - through frontmen Mark Christian and Moses Seruje - to funnel money to Mbabazi. O’Hanlon also noted what he described as Onek’s recent unsolicited “grandstanding” before Parliament in support of ENI, and similar statements of support during a recent Indo-African energy conference in New Dehli. Onek made impossible claims at the Indo-African conference regarding ENI’s ability to export 100,000 - 200,000 barrels per day within two years. Comment: These statements of support by Onek appear completely inappropriate given that the deal is still technically pending. End comment.\r\n¶4. (C) O’Hanlon said ENI’s Uganda deal is part of a wider effort, facilitated by Heritage, to gain control of all oil fields on both sides of Lake Albert. In addition to its exploration blocks in Uganda, Tullow claims to have exploration rights on the Congolese side of Lake Albert. O’Hanlon said Tullow’s exploration efforts on the DRC side of Lake Albert are hampered by Tullow’s refusal to pay off key Congolese officials, including President Laurent Kabila. O’Hanlon added that Heritage recently offered to help Tullow “take\r\nKAMPALA 00001401 002 OF 002\r\ncare” of problems on the Congolese side in order to begin exploration. Tullow refused, according to O’Hanlon.\r\n¶5. (C) O’Hanlon concluded by asking the U.S. to help bring these corruption allegations to light and raise concerns - perhaps in concert with the British High Commissioner or other development partners - over how the Heritage-ENI sale has transpired. O’Hanlon confirmed that Tullow has the contractual right to prevent the Heritage-ENI sale by exercising its contractual “right of first refusal” as a 50% partner in both of Heritage’s exploration blocks and will exercise that right. He said Tullow is confident that one of the potential major oil partners (preferably Exxon Mobil) will be able to assist Tullow in financing the approximately $1.5 billion needed to foil the GOU supported ENI deal by purchasing Heritage’s Ugandan holdings. An Exxon Mobil executive confirmed to EconOff on December 16 that Exxon Mobil has a strong interest in Uganda but is still evaluating available data before making an offer. Because an eventual Tullow-Exxon deal will require Ugandan government approval, the GOU could still prevent Tullow from raising the funds needed in order to buy out Heritage (so it could then sell those shares to Exxon Mobil) and thereby deny Tullow the means to effectively block ENI’s entrance into the Ugandan oil market.\r\n--------------------------------------------- --- \r\nComment: Inaction Sets Bad Precedent\r\n--------------------------------------------- --- \r\n¶6. (C) This is a critical moment for the future of Uganda’s oil industry. The Heritage-ENI deal could prevent a multi-billion dollar deal for Exxon Mobil by drastically diminishing both the size and value of Tullow’s Ugandan holdings. Allegations that Minister Mbabazi, who has already been implicated in other government corruption scandals, solicited and/or accepted payment in exchange for government support will, if true, have serious adverse effects on the economic activity of U.S. businesses in Uganda and U.S. Mission goals regarding accountability, good governance, and economic development. After discussions with Exxon Mobil to confirm Tullow’s story, we intend to approach the British High Commissioner and the Irish Ambassador about drafting a joint letter to President Museveni expressing concern about these very troubling signs of high-level corruption in Uganda’s oil sector, and advocating for the open and transparent sale of oil assets and management of future oil revenues. Depending on the outcome of this major deal, we believe it could be time to consider tougher action - to include visa revocation - for senior officials like Mbabazi who are consistently linked to corruption scandals impacting the international activity of U.S. businesses, U.S. foreign assistance goals, and the stability of democratic institutions.

{"body": "I think if karma was removed, we would see a lot less people posting as it seems to be the driving incentive for people to post.\n\nI have only been here for about a year, but in the last 11 months, I would say the comments I read then, are considerably different to the comments I read now. But I think this is due to the natural flow of things, Reddit reached it's peak, and from the top things can only go down.\n\nExamples:\n\nAfter dart22 posted the [greatest ever pun](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cfbkx/im_85_certain_that_there_is_an_adult_actress_in/c0s5w6t) 6 months ago, any clever word play I have experienced since then has met my mouth with a dull, blunt taste, as if dart22's dish was a flawlessly delicious curry that destroyed my taste buds after it's glorious serving.\n\nNovelty accounts are so frequent these days they have become anything but novel.

Of course users like Bozarking fit into this as well.\n\nThese were all moments of genius that generated lots of attention, lots of karma. Now your average cookie-cutter Redditor cannot easily replicate moments like this, so that is why in 99% of threads these days some wanker is derping **I N C E P T I O N** everywhere, or some cunt is vomiting ASCII penises all over my page.\n\nOf course there are still moments of genius everyday, but they are diluted in the bullshit, they are still there, you just have to look harder to find them. The problem is, the user base has changed, and finding these moments are harder now, as you have to scroll the memes, the bachelor frogs, the stinking residue of 4chan and all the other shit that sits high atop the page, supported by the upvotes of Morons Inc.\n\n**tl;dr:** unfortunately, yes.\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1292347731", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh.. .Just beautiful advice.\n\nI believe that being in clans and using a mic, really did help me socially. I realized I was actually pretty popular once people get to know me.\n\nChat Roulette is a great idea too. \n\n**My tip is this:**\n-Approach someone you met, and say \"Hi, how's it going?\" -- obviously they say \"fine, you?\" and you say \"Oh I'm great.\" \n--don't let the conversation end there. Say \"What have you been doing lately?\" Realizing that you are not satisfied with \"fine\", they may open up a story. \n\nLike \"Oh I been struggling hard with this project for a client...\" \nThen you probe further. \"Oh yeah? What kind of project? What client?\" \n\"uh, it was a kind of difficult programming project... The client want X, X, Y, and I provided the Y, but I told him X was difficult.\"\n\nPROBE... \"Why was X difficult?\"\n\nThe guy you're talking to will literally have this image in their brain like this: \"Wow this guy really cares about my boring ass job..\" \n\n**That's how you do conversation and small talk. Going from small talk to deep philosophical talk is the difficult problem many of us have.**\n\nSome of us are great at specific subjects and deep critical thinking, that we are so hateful of small talk. \n\nBut small talk is like dream states in Inception.\nYou have to go to deeper levels with each probing question.\n\nLike a child going \"Why... why... why.... why\" Then you relate... relate... relate with stories of your own. Relevance is important. Make sure you are relevant. Don't try to relate unless it's absolutely relevant or similar. Don't jump to random topics.\n\nThen finally you make your TARGET come up with the idea you intended...\n\"I really like this guy, I think I'll make HIM my friend, I think he is a good guy.\"\n\n**I N C E P T I O N**\n\n*This strategy not good for you?*\n\nThen go the **Story-teller route** to conversation. Talk to someone, say \"hi how you doin?\" and they say \"fine, you\", and you say \"great... Listen, I just saw this thing on the internet with the guy doing the thing and it was hilarious, you ever see something like that?\" -- \"no, sounds weird.\" -- \"Oh and did you hear about Ireland blocking Allied Irish Banks from bonuses? How do you feel about that?\" -- \"Wait whaa they did what with tax money?\"\n\n**Sometimes nothing works**, Sometimes someone you talk to ... IS ALSO socially inept. I know guys, in upper echelons of social popularity, who have no real social skills. \n\nThis is me talking to my bro:\n\n* Me: Hey hows it going bro?\n* Bro: Good bro, what u been up to\n* Me: Nothin much, I hooked my speaker set up, it's been great. How bout you?\n* Bro: Food network gin and tonic as usual. \n* Me: I also had this thing at work..... &lt;insert story about work&gt;.. cool huh?\n* Bro: Ya. \n* Me: So what else you been doing?\n* Bro: not much not much.\n* Me: Hows that new monitor working out for you? Graphics lookin good?\n* Bro: yea, it's good.\n* Me: Ok, I see.\n* Bro: Yep... \n* Me: Alright, well I'll talk to you later.\n* Bro: Cya.\n\nYou see what happened there? He shared nothing. He commented on nothing. \nAlbeit, it might be because he's busy watching Chopped or something and ignoring me--but still, this is typical conversation with him and I think it's his personality.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1292348250", "subreddit": "seduction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, I've seen this question asked a lot, and I want to tell you my honest opinion. I know it may seem like saying something is gay is harmless, just like saying stupid. However, I know personally every time I hear someone say \"That's so gay\" I get flashbacks to all the kids who picked on me in school, all the people who stopped being my friend or even talking to me just because I was gay, crying in my room hysterical because I was ashamed of who I was. I know when people call things gay they usually don't mean to cause any of this, but for a lot of us it really is hurtful. \n\nI mean, there are some gay people who have no issue at all with the word being used as a derogotory word, but I know it really affects me. You ask if you can use it \"without offending people yet\". The honest truth, is that there may never be a socially acceptable time to say it as long as gay kids are being bullied, abused, and hated for who they are. \n\nI hope this doesn't come across as mean or angry, I'm so glad you're asking and I know you and many other people mean nothing by it when they call something gay, but it's really a big deal for some of us, and refraining from using it as a blanket term for stupid would go really far in helping a lot of people feel more comfortable about who they are. Instead of calling the ending to L O S T \"gay\", just say what it was. I've never seen L O S T, but if the ending was boring call it boring, if it was poorly written, call it just that.

{"body": "The program was pretty well-structured. Took me about a year of daily exercise to start getting to the good part. Everything was just setting up \"triggers\". For example; inhaling while tensing every muscle in your body while thinking \"my mind is getting clearer\", then exhaling while relaxing every muscle and thinking \"my body is falling asleep\". Repeating that for over an hour, every day, for months. Just so after, once you breath in/out you trigger the higher mental focus/relaxed body state. Then you build up another trigger for months. At the end you, have all those triggers stacked up so you can get down under faster. \r\n\r\nYou're welcomed for the **I N C E P T I O N** trick. Just be warned that if you're too tired, you might just drift right into sleep. You also need to set the visualization right. Take the time to set the environment right before starting a 2nd level. Once you've laid down and closed your eyes in the 2nd level, you can start feeling as if in 2 places at once because you're in the same position, doing the same thing both IRL and in visualization. Focus on the black behind your eye-lids to sort of \"align\" both states. From there, keep focusing on the visualization state, and visualize a 3rd state. That's where you'll basically be lucidly inducing a dream. You can set a place, but let whatever pops up take form and go along with it.

Once this has been accomplished, the young man returns home as an adult.\n\nIn modern American culture, this is called college, although the totem animal/ancestor usually turns out to be either some form of alcohol or a really cool professor who doesn't believe in finals and knows where to get the best weed.\n\nIn the UK, it's called a pub crawl, beginning at fifteen in places like London; at puberty in Manchester and Liverpool, and at birth in Wales and Northern Ireland.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1292663044", "subreddit": "gonewild", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Then add struts to make it look like l\\l/l\\l/l\\l/l\\l/l.  \nIf instead they simply add weight to the center of the bridge to see what it's carrying capacity is well you're on you're own, but [here](http://www.garrettsbridges.com/) is a great site to check out.

{"body": "I think you're going a little overboard with your post-modern cinéma vérité style approach to writing. You're including a lot of unflinching, gritty details to paint a picture. It's good that you're using appropriate detail, and picking up on things that are nuanced and help to set the scene. \n\nBut all you have is details, and they're unconnected. You're not telling a story, and you're not really painting a picture, you're just throwing out details. And they're interesting details, but they don't culminate into something greater than the sum of their parts. \n\nThis is the post-modern and self-aware equivalent of purple prose. You've got this part of the equation down. Try to write some stuff with some kind of narrative. It can be as deconstructed and unconvential as you want, but give your next piece of flash fiction a point. A beginning and an end. A message, a moral, a story, something. Give us something to latch onto, as readers.\n\nDon't be afraid to clump sentences into paragraphs. The one sentence paragraph thing is effective on a logarithmic scale. This is personal preference, but I like to see numbers spelled out in writing. And the whole i n c e p t i o n thing is a weird way to add emphasis. You use it twice in a very short piece. Don't.\n\nYou're playing around a lot with unconventional approaches to writing. It's great that you experiment, and I don't want to discourage it. But there's nothing wrong with writing the \"old fashioned way\". I'd be much more impressed by a solid piece of narrative storytelling than another vivid flash fiction memory.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1292728483", "subreddit": "writing", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Turns out from looking at the first 10 or so, the books are indeed from 1905, but the OCR software has wrongly identified various words as \"internet\":\n\n* \"internat.\", as an abbreviation for \"international\"\n* \"interest\", but typoed as \"interset\"\n* \"interest\", but with a smudge over the \"s\"\n* \"interest\", but hyphenated and split across lines\n* a valley (in France) called \"Infernet\" (see [this picture](http://www.corbisimages.com/Enlargement/GM002725.html)); you can hardly blame it for that mistake\n* \"I N T E R N A T I O N A L\", which got OCRed to \"internet IO\"\n* \"interment\"\n\nThe moral of the story is that, if you thought you'd get a net gain from it, you could feed the year into your OCR function.  The probability of distribution of words shifts over time.  If you know that, in the world of books published in 1905, the a priori probability of finding the word \"internet\" is basically zero, you could steer those words above toward other possible matches.\n\nI suppose Google could run their OCR software once, generate this ngram data (both already done), and then use feed that into a second pass of the OCR software.  You'd want to be careful about generating bad forms of feedback (self-reinforcing ideas), but it could increase accuracy overall.  (They also have a lot of word proximity data they could use in sort of a markov model kind of way.

{"body": "If you don't have extensive ear training or piano experience, your best bet it to try to listen to the bass voice and pick out those pitches.  Then figure out what key you're in.  In most cases, the first note in the bass will also be the key of the piece - not all cases, but most.  Then figure out if you're in major or minor.\n\nFrom there, you can fill in the chords above the bassline.  Quick music theory primer that should help:\n\nEach of those pitches in a major or minor scale can correspond with a number, like this:\n\n    C Major:\n    C D E F G A B C\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1\n\nThe letters are the note names, and the numbers are called \"scale degrees.\"  So, for instance, the fifth scale degree in the key of C major is the pitch \"G.\"  The third will be \"C.\"  Now, say you take your scale and put it together on the staff like this:\n\n    G A B C D E F G\n    E F G A B C D E\n    C D E F G A B C\n\nWhat you now have are the chords in C Major.  You can use roman numerals to describe these cords like this:\n\n    Key of C Major:\n\n    G   A   B   C   D   E   F  \n    E   F   G   A   B   C   D  \n    C   D   E   F   G   A   B  \n    I   ii  iii IV  V   vi  vii^o\n\n...and then back to I, which is the C Major chord.\n\nWhat this gives you is a range of possibilities for any given song in a given key.  This is why you sometimes see chord progessions written out like: I - IV - V - I.  Each of those roman numbers indicates what specific notes should be played - but they don't say that order the notes have to be in.  So, say you have an E in the bass.  You'll have one of three chords available to you:\n\n    B    C   C\n    G    A   G\n    E    E   E\n    iii  vi  I\n\n\nYou'll hear the E in the bass voice, but it doesn't necessarily mean that an E chord is being played - it might be a C chord, or an A chord.\n\nAnyway, you can take this information and systematically apply it to the bassline you wrote out.  It works for songs in major and in minor keys.  Essentially, you wind up re-writing the tune, but you don't have to pick out every individual note to do it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1293059232", "subreddit": "Learnmusic", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Work this excercise as high up the neck as you comfortably can, then work back down the string. Once you finish the 'e' string, skip down to the B string and repeat.

Do this all the way back up the neck, then reverse it on the way down. Be sure to alternate pick, even when skipping strings. I find that this drill makes for a great spidering excercise, which will help give the fingers of your fret hand more independence from one another as well as force you to use all 4 fingers, which can be a weakness for some players.

But I was supposed to talk to him. Had to load an older save game.\n\nThere was also a timing bug in that elevator/forklift scene. On somewhat faster machines it ran too fast and you just barely couldn't do it. Tried it at least 20 times. Bah. Turns out I had to install a specific patch first.\n\nI also remember that I had to replay about 30 minutes of the game for some bullshit reason, but I forgot the details. I think some item disappeared or some shit like that.\n\nHad something similar in Chaser (some crap first person shooter). Some scripted event wasn't triggered for some reason. Had to skip the level.\n\nAlso, in HL2 one of the cut scene levels had a glitch. People just stopped doing stuff in the middle. Dozens of people complained on the Steam forums, but Valve sorta ignored it. Again, I had to skip the level.\n\nMy brother managed to walk past a script trigger in Shenmue, which again left the game in an unsolvable state. Boy, was he pissed. He wasted hours with that stuff.\n\nSo yea, shit can always happen. Like there can be some uninitialized variable lying around and if you do A B C D E F G H in that specific order that variable might have a specific value which can break things. And this specific value might even be saved with the rest of your data.\n\nGuess that was the case with Chaser. Some people managed to work around that bug by restarting the level completely. Didn't help in my case though.\n\nOh and another thing... MDK2 used two different timers. The game engine itself used TGT and the scripted stuff used QPC. TGT got a resolution of 1msec and is very robust. QPC got a much higher resolution (not really necessary for games) and it's somewhat fragile. With my old machine in conjunction with an ATI graphics card I got so called \"QPC leaping\" (there are about a dozen things which can go wrong with that timer), which basically means that the timer randomly jumps a few seconds into the future if there is a high bus load (e.g. if you play a game).\n\nThis jumpy timer was used for two critical sections of the game. Some button pressing sequence and the final boss fight (I think). Well, it just zapped the time away and I just couldn't do it. Doing it in 75% of the time was possible, but doing it in 50% of the time certainly wasn't.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1293575091", "subreddit": "fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think my favorite was the Xbox Controller-S.  Not the original giant crappy controller they had, but the smaller replacement.  The replacement fixed the location of the whit and black buttons, and the A B X Y buttons were a little bit more spaced out as well.  The location of the joysticks were perfect, and I liked how the trigger buttons were actually trigger buttons.  For playing racing games it made it much easier to control how much throttle or brake you wanted to apply.\n\nI like the Dual Shock controller too, but what keeps that controller from being perfect is the position of the analog sticks.  Remember the original Playstation controller?  Well the dualshock just kind of added on two joysticks.  Sony kept it the same for the PS2, and then when they were going to change it to that funny boomerang thing for the PS3 everyone made a big fuss so we still have the same old controller.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1293605906", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I didn't read the question but the answer is Mass Roaches.  Zvz is mass roaches.  People will \"oh no there's ling baneling stuff too\" but really the best option is mass roaches. Its a sad truth.  Every zvz turns into mass roaches.  Here's the best way to do it:\n\n1.  Don't go directly to mass roaches, but do put your warren down almost immediately after spawning pool completes.\n\n2.  Make 4 - 8 lings, then start making roaches.  Don't make as many drones as you do in the other match ups.\n\n3.  Keep him scouted with your overlords.  Make sure you have more roaches than he does. When you do, attack!\n\n(5-6 are in-battle tips)\n\n5.  If he has hydras LOLOLOL.  All you have to do is hit the hydras first.  This is easy with roach speed and super easy with burrow movement.  Once his hydras are dead, its your roaches vs his roaches and you should have more BECAUSE I TOLD YOU TO.\n\n6.  If you feel like a super pro gosu champion, you can go roach - infestor.  Use fungal growth to screw up his concaves.  Mass roach vs mass roach is all about positioning.\n\n\nOther note:  Scout his base a lot.  If you see a spire, its not a big deal.  Just get either spore crawlers or about 6-7 more queens with transfuse.  Mutas kill roaches s l o w l y, and with burrow you can regen very very fast.\n\n\nUpgrades of course are very important whenever its the same units vs each other.\n\n-source, me, 400 game diamond 2275 points zergy zerg.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1293722391", "subreddit": "starcraft", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I wrote a fairly in-depth comment on figuring out all the notes on the fretboard for a thread about reading music and I've pasted it below. There's nothing wrong with Paynekiller's method, but if anyone wants some more ideas, they're here. It's geared at someone who wants to read music, so it may not be relevant to 90% of the people in this subreddit, but it's here if anyone's curious.\n\nOpen string notes (low to high):\n\nE A D G B E\n\nFifth fret notes:\n\nA D G C E A\n\nSeventh fret notes:\n\nB E A D F# B\n\nTwelfth fret notes:\n\nE A D G B E\n\nTo find a specific note on the neck you don't know, you just have to compare it to the nearest note you already know. I've given you what I think are the easiest reference points on the neck to remember.\nWhat makes them easy? Different things. I'll assume you know all the open strings by heart. If not, learn them. From highest to lowest - Easter Bunnies Get Drunk At Easter. Once you have those memorized, the twelfth fret is easy. The open string notes are just an octave higher.\n\nThe seventh fret is next easiest. Each note on the seventh is an octave higher than the previous open string. The seventh fret on the fifth (A) string is an octave up from the sixth (E) string. The seventh fret on the fourth (D) string is an octave up from the fifth (A) string... get the idea? For reasons I'll get to later, this doesn't quite work for the second (B) string.\n\nNow, the guitar is normally tuned in perfect fourths. Each string is a fourth higher than the previous. How many semitones are in a fourth? Five. Each fret is one semitone. Moving five semitones (frets) up the neck is the same as moving one string over. So the notes at the fifth fret are just the same as the notes on the next string over. Fifth fret of the sixth string is A, fifth fret of the fifth string is D. Again, this breaks down at the B string.\nSo what's the deal with the B string? It's only tuned a major third above the previous string. Everything I've already said applies just the same to the B string, but it's shifted by one fret. Want to see something that will blow your mind? Play an E-major chord. Now play an A-major. Now play a D-major. Each chord is a perfect fourth higher than the last one - each root note is one string over from the previous. Examine the shapes of the chords - each one only differs by one semitone from the last one - and that moved semitone only occurs on the B string. Each chord is the same shape, it's just been shifted when it crosses over the B string to compensate for the different tuning. If you had a guitar tuned in all fourths, you could play those three chords using the exact same chord shape.\n\nBut I digress.\nMore tips: Learn the notes on the E strings first. Why? Because if you know all the notes on the low E string, you know all the notes on the high string, just two octaves up.\n\nKnow how to play an octave from any note. The most common octave shape is easy to remember - it's a capital 'L'. Two frets up, two strings over. If you know how to play a note on any of the strings, you can find it an octave up without moving your hand along the neck. This needs to be changed when you cross over the B string, but I'm sure you can figure that out now.\n\nAlso worth noting: Every note on the D string is a major ninth (octave + major second) above the same fret on the low-E string. That is, to find any note on the D string, just go two strings and two frets (an octave) lower.\nFinally, get some sheet music for a song you like and practice, practice, practice. Classical pieces are good for this (and it's much much easier to find sheet music for them).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1293723296", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Haha I feel ya man.  Sometimes one race just looks r i d i c u l o u s l y easy.\nTips vs terran:\nOpening roach generally isn't safe/ strong, its much safer to open with lings and banelings.\nKeep a ling in front of his base, don't make banelings unless you see him move out.  The banelings speed upgrade is crucial.  Make sure to have really good, far creep spread.  Banelings are good units but only on creep, where they'll have the speed to catch fast bio balls.\nDuring a battle, make sure to control the banelings very carefully.  What I usually do is continuously right click the center of the marine ball, usually ends up with the banes killing all the marines. A-clicking will end up with more marauders being able to soak up damage.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1293836089", "subreddit": "starcraft", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
