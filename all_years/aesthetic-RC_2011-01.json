{"body": "Head on over to [r/musictheory](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory) and check out some threads there.\n\nRead the answer to [this question](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/11669/mathematical-difference-between-white-and-black-notes-in-a-piano) to satisfy your math/science side.\n\nI'll give you some starting stuff based on what you said:\n\nThe distance between each fret is called a half-step, the distance of two frets is called a whole-step. In theory, the octave is divided into 12 equal half-steps, but intervals are named, based on the concept of the 7-note scale (A B C D E F G), by number: unison (playing the same note), second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and octave. So, in the key of C (C D E F G A B), G is a fifth from C, E is a third from C, D is a second, etc. \n\nChords are built by stacking thirds on top of each other, and named, not by what note is loudest, but by which note is at the bottom of the stack of thirds. E is a third from C, and G is a third from E, so a C chord will have C E and G - that's called a triad: a chord with three notes (1st or \"root\", 3rd, and 5th). Major and minor are decided by the third, so, in this case, E. CEG is a C-major chord, but if you lower E by a half step, and use E-flat, then you have a C-minor chord. You can keep stacking thirds on, and create different types of chords: CEGB is a C7 chord (B is a seventh from C), CEGBD is a C7add9 chord (D is a ninth from C), etc. But the \"root\" note isn't always the lowest pitch; you could have a chord that goes, from bottom to top: ECGCEGC - this would be a C chord still, because is has C, E and G.\n\nIf you want to learn theory, you're going to have to learn the theory jargon, because that's what lends it meaning. You had to learn science jargon to talk about science, so now you have to learn music jargon to talk about music, otherwise much meaning and information will be left untransmitted. \n\nFifths are scientifically significant because they have a frequency ratio of 3:2. But they are significant in music theory because of the Western tonal system. The chord based off the fifth (in the key of C, G is the fifth, so the chord based off G is: GBD) is called the \"dominant\" and creates tension that creates the expectation of returning to \"1\" (C chord in this case). So, in classical theory, if you want to get to a certain chord, you play the chord based off its fifth to draw the listeners' ears there (this is beyond what you'd need to know, just trying to explain the reason behind the circle of fifths). Keys that are a fifth apart are also closely related because there is only a difference of one note, for example: Key of C: CDEFGAB; Key of G: GABCDEF-sharp - the only difference is between F and F-sharp.\n\nFor now, as a beginning guitarist, you should focus on familiarizing yourself with the topography of your instrument; don't worry *too* much yet about theory. Get used to the feeling of the instrument, but start paying attention to the actual sounds, the aural pattern, not the physical pattern. You can easily watch someone play and see where their hand moves to learn something, but when you can't physically see them, you need to be able to connect what you hear with what physical pattern would represent it on the guitar.\n\nThe most important thing is intervals: learn the shapes of all the intervals. (intervals are always counted from bottom up) For example, to play a fourth between any two strings but G and B, you play the same fret on both strings (the third fret on \"A\" string is a fourth away from the third fret on \"E\" string: make sense?). A major third is a half step below that (below in terms of pitch, physically up when you are holding the guitar), etc. Hope this makes sense.\n\nOK, I went on for way too long there. Hopefully you can get something useful out of all I wrote.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1293925423", "subreddit": "Music", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

We, currently, have so many devices connecting to the internet that the world is running out of free IPv4 addresses. This is because an IPv4 address looks like this...\n\n255.255.255.255\n\nWhere each '255' can be a number between 1 and 255, with a couple exceptions. Not a whole lot of available numbers.

Unimaginably more. That's why, while this transition to IPv6 will be rough, we won't have to do it again for thousands of years. \n\nIf the world runs out of IPv4 addresses and IPv6 adoption isn't fully saturated, then (worst case scenario) we wont be able to connect any new devices to the internet. Organizations like IBM and the DoD have millions of unused IP addresses reserved for them, though, so we could easily take some to buy more time, but IANA has said that they probably won't do this.

{"body": "Haven't watched your replay.  But I'm a diamond terran (though switching to zerg sometime).  Basically the endgame in a Z v T has a strong emphasis on tech switches.  Currently the most popular is the broodlord corrupter into ultralisk and vice versa.  Personally, I find the fake ultra into broodlord/corrupter to be more effective. Remember, late game, zergs (almost) always have the upper hand.  This is because (ofc you know) of how much quicker and the production rate of units.  One thing that I've seen people not continuously injecting their hatcheries even when they're reaching production cap. KEEP INJECTING, EVEN IF YOURE 200/200.  Even if you use your whole army to wipe out 1/2 their army, you still have the upper hand with 19/19 larvae at 5-6 bases (average endgame on lets say metalopolis).  You can pretty much just whip up a new army on the spot.  One thing I've learned is never to straight on attack a terran player.  If you are familiar with SC1 strategy, you would never walk into a 200/200 siege line...EVER. Same concept, you wait for the terran to be very defensive and poke holes at him/her.  \n\nAdditionally, do not be afraid of mixing up your endgame.  I have seen very effective endings where zergs force terrans to commit to vikings with higher marine ratios than marauders with broodlords then switch very quickly into ling/baneling.  Also, nydus is your friend. \n\nBut i haven't watched your replay, so I don't know how much of this helped. But I do hope it did.\n\nGoodluck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294155018", "subreddit": "StarcraftFeedback", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You're surrounded by your family and your loved ones, laughter fills the air and you look around smiling at all the people in your life.  \n\nThe people that make life worth living.\n\nSomething in the distance catches your ear.  You look up and see a shiny object far out across the sky.  It's approaching awfully fast...\n\n**E X P L O S I O N**\n\nYou're thrown to the ground.  Suddenly the air is filled with the screams of people you know and love.  Burning flesh and smoke fills your nostrils.

You try to get to your feet when there's another...\n\n**E X P L O S I O N**\n\nYou're thrown to the ground again.  You get on your feet as fast as you can calling out to your wife, yelling as loud as you can desperate to be heard amongst all the screaming and dying.  You catch a glimpse of your sisters body, blown apart.  Memories of her start to flood your mind but shock kicks in.  Protects you from completely breaking down. You see your father laying next to your mother.  There's something odd about him...\n\nOh yes.  You notice that he's missing his head.  The man who raised you and loved you is now missing his head.  No more talks about how he's going to spoil his future grandchildren.  Your mother has a large piece of metal sticking out of her stomach oozing blood all over the ground. Your mind threatens to snap but you think of your wife and continue on. You are surrounded by the deaths of those you love.  \n\nYou make it to your wife and turn her over in your arms.\n\nHalf her face is gone.\n\nIt all comes down at once.  An anguish so deep, like nothing you'd ever dreamed of feeling even in your worst of nightmares rushes to the surface.  You begin to scream, holding your dead wife who only has half a face.  Your mind cannot process how quickly you have lost everything.  You pass out.\n\nYou wake up in a hospital bed.  The doctors tell you that you're going to be fine, that there's hardly a scratch on you.  You don't even hear this.  You ask about your family.  The doctor looks down and shakes his head.  He's very sorry you hear him say.  And suddenly, like a switch, you are filled with a rage matched only by the anguish you felt earlier. \n\n\"Who..,\" you ask very calmly, \"...did this?\"  \n\nThe doctor points to the T.V. in the hospital room.  You listen to a newsman relay that the Foreign Invaders got their target wrong.  The Foreign Invaders thought your wedding party was a military target.  They are very sorry, you hear them say.  \n\nVery sorry.\n\nThe apology makes you even angrier.  You doubt the man in uniforms sincerity.  The stars and stripes on his chest becomes an unbridled focal point of hate.  You vow revenge.  You will do everything in your power to extract blood for what the Foreign Invaders have taken from you.  \n\nYou think they are not truly sorry for what they have done.\n\n\"They will be.\" You whisper.\n\nThey will be.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294156035", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 190, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's not printed clear as day. The type is \"dropped out\" of a dark background, that is, the type is a negative image. Due to a printing phenomena called ink spread, small unprinted areas surrounded by printed ink tend to shrink in area as the ink encroaches on the non-inked \"islands.\" So type \"dropped out\" of an otherwise solid field of ink can \"close up,\" that is, the type can partially disappear like low-lying islands when sea level rises. That makes the type harder to see, much less read. With ink spreading into dropped-out type, legibility depends on the font (design of the letters); thick, bold typefaces hold up better than thin, delicate ones. The typeface used for the word homeopathic is especially sensitive to ink spread. It's a Roman typeface, which means the letters have very thin parts that easily close up from ink spread.\n\nHeadlines of all upper-case (capital) Roman letters are generally hard to read. There's wide spacing between the letters: H O M E O P A T H I C, which makes it even harder to read, and maximizes the ratio of dark background to white letters.\n\nThe dark stripe with the word homeopathic is located at the top of the package, where it can blend into the shadows behind the package. \n\nObviously this package was intentionally designed to make the word homeopathic as hard to see as possible short of impossible. The obvious intention is to make it unlikely that potential purchasers will realize the remedy is homeopathic. It is deceptive labeling, which is completely unacceptable for medicines.\n\n*Caveat Emptor* is good advice, but by itself not adequate to protect the public from bogus or dangerous medicines.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294167843", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wow, thanks for this! I will post a picture later if I cannot get this to work (I am at work now). I do have a humidifier, so I guess that accounts for one or both of the other wires on C. I didn't even think of mentioning that earlier and did not put 2 and 2 together on those wires.  \n  \nMy humidifier works, which means that the C terminal itself is okay. It also means I can probably safely disconnect those wires while trying to get the thermostat working, since the humidifer is non-essential.  \n  \nRegarding connecting red to C and powering the thermostat: the thermostat has a row of pins like this:  \nC RC-RH W1 W2 G Y1 Y2  \nX X X X X X X   \nWhen I accidentally connected the R wire to the RC-RH (jumpered R) pin, I also connected all the other pins -- I just put the thing on the plate incorrectly, so everything was shifted down. So, R wire was connected to C pin, W1 wire was connected to RC-RH, etc. I guess I completed the heat circuit and caused the thermostat screen to turn on with the power from that circuit.  \n  \nThank you again for your response! If I can't figure this out with the help of this voltmeter and a little more time and patience, I will post a picture tonight around 9:00. It has to be that blue wire, I think.

{"body": "Or so it seemed.\n\nBut there was still one job left.\n\nObama was already in power; he was elected while Fox had everyone's IQ brainwashed in half. He would continue destroying the country until someone stopped him; the whole world agreed that he needed to be stopped, but nobody could do it.\n\nIt was up to Assange and Moore. They were, after all, the best pair of ninjassassins in the world, on top of Assange's  **H A C K I N G**  skills. It would be no problem at all for them to take down Obama... they hoped.\nThey showed up at the White House on December 23, 2011. There were guards all over the place, continuously brainwashed by all of the Fox News employees who had been moved to the White House to continue live performances. It wouldn't work on the whole country, since it wasn't being broadcast, but it provided the President with a secret service who didn't want to kill him.\n\nAssange  **H A C K E D**  through the security system, disabling the cameras. As Assange sniped out all the guards, Moore headed straight into the White House. It was time to end Obama's reign.\nBut Moore couldn't fight him alone. Bullets wouldn't work on him; he would simply punch all of them out of the air before they got to him. You'd need a steady stream of bullets from all directions to get him; something that only the likes of Assange and Moore were capable of deflecting like that.\n\nThey just had to find a way to get Obama's hands tied, and then he'd be much more vulnerable. But it would be difficult to restrain him.\n\nAfter Moore ran out of bullets, Obama charged at him head-on, exactly as Moore had done a month or so before. Moore grabbed Obama by the forearms and tried to spin him around, but it failed; he only ended up twisting one of his own wrists. If things continued this way and Assange wasn't able to get inside, Moore might be done for.\n\nMoore managed to dodge Obama's next blow, a clap-style punch aimed for his head. Then, he ground-tackled Obama into the ground, using upward momentum to make him lose balance; but Obama spun around, throwing Moore off and getting himself back to standing upright. Moore hit the wall, injuring his shoulders and neck.\nObama ran at him for a drop-kick; hitting him in the throat now would likely collapse his windpipe. Fortunately, Moore was able to roll out of the way, causing Obama to sprain his ankle on the wall.\n\nAfter attempting another tackle and simply being thrown across the room, he started to lose hope. His only chance would be to get at Obama from behind; but Obama wouldn't stop staring at him for even a moment, unless there were a second target. And Assange might take a while to get in, having to provide covering fire for himself.\n\nIf only he could find a way to give Obama a second target... when it hit him.\n\nIf he could throw his shoe at Obama, he would have to dodge it, or he would lose the respect of his mentor, George Bush.\n\nThis would force him to move his eyes away from Moore for a split second to look at the shoe, giving Moore a chance to get behind him and tie his hands. \nIt succeeded. He was finally about to shoot Obama, when he remembered he was out of ammo; and by the time Assange got inside, he was out of ammo, too.\n\nThey decided they would have to launch Obama into space.\n\nThey strapped him to a ballistic missile that they found ready-to-launch in the White House with no warhead, and launched it into space.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nBut some say that he survived.\n\nHe waited.\n\nUntil the missile passed close by a planet.\n\nAnd he jumped, and waited for the months until he could land.\n\nAnd he's still there today.\n\nWaiting for a chance to come back to Earth and finish the job he started in 2006.\n\nWaiting.\n\nWatching.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294188127", "subreddit": "humor", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I pestered him with spitballs, flat tires, ear flicks, pen pokes... any immature and irritating thing I could think of.

One week later I got a game and the following my sister got a game, then whatever for Christmases/birthdays later. That first week without an owned game, my dad rented DEFENDER II, because he had played it on Atari or whatever earlier system. It got boring quickly.\n\nAnyway the point of this story, is I was ninja turtle crazy back then and it was the game I picked out. Since it was my first game I guess my learning curve was up there. I don't recall how long it took me to beat the game and I had met some friends later in high school who never beat it. I also had a moment of Déjà vu or **I N C E P T I O N** with the game as I had a dream of playing a level with spikes on the wall and the next day BAM, got to the level with the closing walls with spikes. I was playing, I paused and had to run and tell my mom about it. Other than that, the game wasn't too hard. I have my methods, somewhere in level where it's dark outside and there are the spot lights, there is a building with scrolls. I fill up each of my turtles with them and that is how I beat the Technodrome and the last level. I don't think I have ever beaten Shredder without it. \n\nAnd for completest sake, my sister got Donkey Kong classics as \"her\" game... my parents still play this game regularly to this day.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294254429", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

L a n g e r h a n s ,  was arrested, in the local city hall in his office, by a crook, in the uniform of an officer of the guard with a detachment of soldiers -- 10 men relieved public bath- and shooting range guards, whom he had commandeered under false pretense. After he had held back the mayor in his office under military guard, he went to the cash office to the treasurer von Wildberg, had him close the accounts *[cashing up, like on the end of the business day]*, took the present money, ca. 4.000 mark, with him, and declared him too to be under arrest. He had both brought to the [neue Wache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Wache) in Berlin in requisitioned cars *[wagons, not necessarily motor powered]* in company of two privates *[grenadiers]* and a police officer. He himself proceeded to the railway station, to travel to Berlin.

{"body": "Memorization of the chords in all keys works, but it does not have to start as a \"rote\" task of brute-force memorization. It can be broken down into steps that you understand so you can always go back and figure it out again.\n\nWhen you harmonize any major scale in 3-note chords (triads) you'll always get these qualities in this order. Just memorize these 7 words in order.\n    \n    I\tmajor\n    ii\tminor\n    iii\tminor\n    IV\tmajor\n    V\tmajor\n    vi\tminor\n    vii\tdiminished\n\nTo apply them to a key you need to know the correct letter name for each step of that key. This can be done by memorizing the major scale formula:\n\nHalf steps between steps 3 &amp; 4 and 7 &amp; 8. Whole steps between all others.\n\n     W W h W W W h\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nNow, the NATURAL HALF STEPS are those from B to C and E to F. All other letter-named notes without sharps or flats are a whole step apart.\n\nTo spell a C major scale, first say the alphabet from C to C. Apply the numbers 1-8.\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nAdd sharps or flats to make the letters follow the major scale formula. In the case of C there are already half steps from 3-4 and 7-8. No sharps or flats are needed.\n\nLet's do another. To spell an F major scale, first say the alphabet from F to F.\n\n    F G A B C D E F\t\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nIn this scale, we already have a whole step from F to G. Good.\n\nThere is already a whole step from G to A. Good.\n\nThere is NOT a half step from A to B (3 to 4). We must flat the B to make it fit the formula.\n\n    F G A Bb\n    1 2 3 4 \n\nContinuing, we now have a whole step from Bb to C, which is what we want from 4-5 in the major scale. Good.\n\nC to D (5-6) is a whole step. Good.\n\nD to E (6-7) is a whole step. Good.\n\nE to F (7-8) is already a NATURAL half step, so no further modification is needed.\n\nHere is the correctly-spelled F major scale.\n\n    F G A Bb C D E F\t\n    1 2 3 4  5 6 7 8\n\nThe triads in the key of F major will be these roots, with the earlier-mentioned qualities.\n\n    I\tF major\n    ii\tG minor\n    iii\tA minor\n    IV\tBb major\n    V\tC major\n    vi\tD minor\n    vii\tE diminished\n\nIt will be easier to find and remember the chords in keys if you practice doing this for all 12 keys. Write them out and review the process for a few weeks. If you can start actually using what you learned on songs, you'll know it forever.\n\nFlat keys: Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb\n\nSharp keys:G D A E B F# C#\n\nThe next chore is to practice finding the relative minor for any major key. It's always the 6th degree of the major scale. The minor key has the same chords as its relative major scale.\n\n    Major key\tRelative Minor\n    C\t\t\tAm\n    F\t\t\tDm\n    Bb\t\t\tGm\n    Eb\t\t\tCm\n    etc.\n\nThe minor scale harmony is the same as major, but since it starts on a different degree of the major scale formula, it's best to memorize those qualities too so you can identify minor keys quickly.\n\n    i\tminor\n    ii\tdiminished\n    III\tmajor\n    iv\tminor\t\n    v\tminor (this triad will change to major often)\n    VI\tmajor\n    VII major\n\nYou can practice by asking yourself questions like this:\nWhat's the V chord in the key of Bb?\nWhat's the iii chord in the key of G?\nWhat's the VII chord in Cm?\nWhat's the VI chord in Fm?\n\nThat's a good start, and at MI we'd assign this to be studied for ~5 weeks in theory class before moving on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294371727", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Both of my grandfathers we're both freemasons and members of scottish rite.\n\nWhat you have here is a tinfoil hat theory, if you want to know about freemasons, ask one. Go to a lodge of your choosing, once a mason you have access to any and all literature.\n\nThe \"secret\" in freemasonry is really a secret of tradition. Masons are followers of god but also believers in Math and Science. they believe that math is Gods secret universal language. In history prior to just a couple hundred years ago these ideas were very much at odds with the church, further more all people that weren't of royal background were pretty much a slave of one form or other all over the world until recently.\n\nMasons were in a paculiar position, they needed math and science to build many of the great ancient sructures, but the church didnt want people having knowledge of math and science as they viewed it as heracy, masons had more freedom than average slaves as they needed to move from town to town to build the great ancient cities and such.\n\nin order to keep the peace with the church , and knowing thatknowledge in books could be rewritten, changed or destroyed like the great libraries of alexandria or in modern times the work of the Nazi's, it has been a tradition that masons be taught the masonic knowledge orally,verbatim  in secret so that a radical pope or an overbearing dictator couldnt have influence over them.\nBy keeping the knowledge secret ensure there importance throughout the centuries as the leaders of the world needed them to design there cities, but were able to keep the history only through the knowledge that enemies of the masons will always seek to destroy what they know which would dismantle the fraternity. And that it is a luxery that we have access to knowledge because a Napoleon or a Hitler or a Stalin can come along at any point in time and have there army erase your history, and only the knowledge passed on orally and in secret will survive without being rewritten by the propaganda machine .\n\nthe true secrets are only a few words, phrases and handshakes that help one mason, know a brother mason during a time of darkness when it is not safe to show an open allegiance do to some form of tyranny.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294440441", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"El pecado de los aviones privados\"\n\nhttp://www.noroeste.com.mx/opinion.php?tipo=1&amp;id=17079\n\nEn resumen dice:\nO P I N I Ó N \nF E R N A N D O A . O R R A N T I A \nEl pecado de los aviones privados\nLa paradoja de los presumidos políticos mexicanos es evidente: el afán de viajar con el lujo oriental y la ostentación y el gasto que demuestra el avión jet privado, combinado con el cada año mayor uso de aviones privados en los cielos mexicanos, producirá un número también mayor de accidentes\n\n\nUno de los pecados más comunes de los políticos mexicanos es la soberbia, cuya expresión más evidente es la debilidad por el uso de los aviones privados cuyo costo, por supuesto, pagamos los contribuyentes. Cientos de millones de dólares cruzan los cielos de México, invertidos por el gobierno federal en la compra o arrendamiento de avioncitos jet, porque en cuanto alcanza cierto nivel o jerarquía, el político mexicano busca cumplir su más caro anhelo, después del cargo obtenido: tener a su disposición un avión jet privado, no importa que nuevos cuesten entre treinta y cuarenta millones de dólares y en el peor de los casos, lograr que su dependencia de gobierno compre uno usado, pero con poco uso, para tener el extremo placer sensual de volar a la hora que se desee, con la compañía que se elija y por supuesto, que el vuelo sea acompañado por la bebida favorita \"del señor\" y reclinado en un asiento amplio y mullido de piel.\n\n...\nObviamente, la crítica por el uso de aviones privados deriva del dispendio injustificable que representa tanto la inversión en la compra del avión como en el muy alto costo mensual del mantenimiento del juguetito, que requiere de dos pilotos con certificación para volar aviones jet, cuando menos un mecánico especializado y además, el gasto del lugar donde se guarda el avión cuando no se usa, lo que en la jerga del ramo se denomina \"hangar\", cuya renta no es barata, todo ello sin contar el costo del combustible que se gasta en el viaje de una, dos o seis personas solamente, en un avión que consume mucho combustible, porque alcanza velocidades de crucero de 800 kilómetros por hora.\n\nLamentablemente, todos los gobernadores y secretarios del Ejecutivo Federal quieren tener su propio avión, para demostrar su capacidad de pago y también la importancia que equivocadamente le atribuyen los políticos mexicanos a la posibilidad de desplazarse en un avión jet privado con capacidad para seis u ocho pasajeros, pero cuyo peligro ha quedado evidenciado de sobra con el último accidente ocurrido en el Distrito Federal, en el cual murió el Secretario de Gobernación, víctima de su propia soberbia, que aunque común entre los políticos mexicanos, no deja de ser eso: presunción, ostentación, alarde de exclusividad, exceso de autoestima.\n\nLa respuesta que los políticos mexicanos ofrecen como inútil justificación ante las críticas por el uso injustificable de los aviones privados, es que deben viajar con frecuencia y a horas que no siempre coinciden con los horarios de los vuelos comerciales y además, por eso mismo es que en Estados Unidos es común el uso de esos muy caros juguetes entre los empresarios y también entre los políticos de alto nivel.\n\nPero nuestros políticos olvidan que no es posible establecer comparación entre el país más rico del mundo -a pesar de la crisis actual- y el país pobre, endeudado y subdesarrollado que es el nuestro, con un triste y lamentable cincuenta por ciento de pobres en su población general que impide el dispendio en cosas superfluas, como lo es volar en aviones privados, sean jet o no. No todos somos iguales, decía el entonces gobernador Alfonso Genaro Calderón Velarde, pero ninguna diferencia -digo yo y millones de mexicanos- puede justificar el gasto enorme de comprar y mantener un avión jet privado como los que usan nuestros políticos.\n\nPor lo que respecta a los empresarios estadounidenses, conviene recordar a nuestros políticos que gustan de comparaciones imposibles, que los requisitos de deducción fiscal de los viajes en aviones privados son muchos y difíciles de satisfacer en ese país y en todo caso, es el dinero privado de una empresa o grupo de empresas lo que se está gastando y no dinero público sacado del erario, como es el caso de los aviones privados del gobierno federal y de los estados. Es inolvidable la justificación que pretendió hacer en el sexenio pasado el entonces Secretario de Hacienda Francisco Gil Díaz, por la compra de la dependencia a su cargo de dos aviones jet nuevos a la empresa brasileña Embraer, con un costo total de 40 millones de dólares: \"¡es que el precio estaba muy barato!\".\n\nNingún político mexicano, salvo el Presidente de la República, puede justificar la compra y el uso de aviones privados para el desempeño de su función pública. La seguridad de los servidores públicos está mejor garantizada si viaja el funcionario con su secretario privado y dos guardias, pero en avión comercial, sea el Secretario de la Defensa Nacional o el de Economía, el de Hacienda o el de la Reforma Agraria, si tomamos en cuenta el costo de un viaje en avión jet privado, que según tres informantes confiables, del Distrito Federal a Mazatlán y regreso, el costo aproximado mínimo es de 200 mil pesos, según el modelo de avión que se use, sin contar el costo proporcional de la inversión o amortización y el seguro del avión, todo lo cual se calcula en dólares, porque en esa moneda se estiman los precios de esos caros instrumentos de ostentación, inadmisibles en un país con las carencias del nuestro. El costo de esas mismas cuatro personas en Mexicana o Aeroméxico sería de 32 mil pesos, volando en primera clase.\n\nPara añadir el insulto a la ostentación, me dicen mis informantes que el uso de los aviones jet privados es común entre funcionarios con un nivel muy inferior al de secretario del Ejecutivo, como son el director del Banco de México, el del Seguro Social, el del Infonavit, el del ISSSTE y hasta el de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad , cuyas delicadas posaderas seguramente se verían maltratadas si cometieran la imprudencia de usar aviones de línea comercial como Aeroméxico y Mexicana, como cualquier ciudadano y en especial los diputados y senadores, que viajan siempre en aviones de línea comercial a sus estados, cada semana.\n\nFuncionarios de distintos niveles de la Procuraduría General de la República y de la Secretaría de Seguridad Pública, de la Policía Federal Preventiva, no pueden quedarse atrás y en aviones propiedad de la dependencia a la que prestan sus servicios viajan a todos los confines del país a prestar con su presencia la tranquilidad de la paz pública convulsionada ahora por el narcotráfico, pero siempre y cuando el viaje sea en avión jet privado.\n\nAl inicio de su sexenio, el entonces presidente Miguel de la Madrid ordenó que se vendieran todos los aviones jet privados del gobierno federal, con excepción de unos pocos. Ante la falta de compradores, decidió el Presidente que se regalaran a los gobernadores de los estados, con lo cual se inició el vicio actual que padecemos en todo el país y Sinaloa no es una excepción, de que nuestros gobernadores ya no quieren viajar si no lo hacen en avión jet privado propiedad del gobierno de su estado. No es posible mezclarse con los ciudadanos comunes y corrientes. Varias veces viajé del Distrito Federal a Mazatlán en el mismo avión comercial que el gobernador Calderón, sin que a éste le pasara nada malo, ni se le pegara ninguna enfermedad. \n\nLos regalos de Miguel de la Madrid contaminaron los usos y costumbres de nuestros gobernadores y ahora el costo de esos viajes alcanza niveles sorprendentes por su injustificable y elevada erogación mensual.\nAl final de su sexenio, en el sexto año, Miguel de la Madrid decidió que si no podía vencer el problema debía unirse a la procesión y ordenó la compra a la fábrica Boeing, de un nuevo avión modelo 757, a un costo asombroso de 120 millones de dólares más el costo de la decoración y del mobiliario interior realizado en Texas, según se informó en la prensa nacional de entonces. \n\nEs el mismo avión que ahora usa el presidente Calderón en sus viajes tanto nacionales como internacionales. Ya tiene 20 años de vida y sólo nos falta que el presidente Calderón decida cambiarlo por uno nuevo. Con los vientos que corren en los estados, nadie se sorprendería.\nUn experto en aviación explicaba recientemente en la prensa del Distrito Federal, a propósito del accidente de la semana pasada, que el uso de aviones jet privados es delicado, porque no son tan seguros como los aviones jet grandes, por varias razones, pero sobre todo, porque como se supone que ocurrió con el avión del secretario Mouriño, es muy peligroso acercarse a un avión grande que precede al pequeño, porque la turbulencia que crean los dos potentes motores del avión grande pueden ocasionar la pérdida de control de los pilotos del avión pequeño y producir el desplome del mismo, como ya ha sucedido en Estados Unidos varias veces en el pasado, según el informante.\n\nLa paradoja de los presumidos políticos mexicanos es evidente: el afán de viajar con el lujo oriental y la ostentación y el gasto que demuestra el avión jet privado, combinado con el cada año mayor uso de aviones privados en los cielos mexicanos, producirá un número también mayor de accidentes mortales que obligará a renunciar al uso de ese medio de ostentación que hasta ahora ha demostrado ser contagioso entre la clase política mexicana. Sin embargo, como decía un viejo político veracruzano hace una década, a propósito de los aviones jet pequeños que empezaban a popularizarse entre los políticos de alto nivel: \"para andar en los cielos y entre las nubes, nada mejor que un avión comercial grandote; que los jóvenes políticos se arriesguen en los pequeños, yo prefiero uno de Mexicana grande, muy grande, con pilotos en verdad expertos\".\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294683758", "subreddit": "mexico", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I'm still learning to use Coq, but here is a brief summary of what I've learned so far:\n\n(I'm going to ignore the whole Curry-Howard isomorphism \"proofs-as-programs\" thing.)\n\nUsing Coq involves (at least) three languages:\n\nThe first is for writing down mathematical expressions, statements and definitions.  For example, the statement of Problem 3(v), after the appropriate definitions, looks something like: \"forall a b c d:Num,  b &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; d &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; (a/b = c/d &lt;-&gt; a*d = b*c)\".  This has the obvious meaning: for all numbers a, b, c and d, if b and d are not equal to zero, then a/b = c/d if and only if a*d = b*c.\n\nThe second language includes commands for controlling Coq: declaring and defining objects and axioms, stating propositions and conducting proofs.  For example, we might declare problem 3(v) above as a lemma:\n\n    Lemma p3v: forall a b c d:Num,\n      b &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; c &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; d &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; (a/b)/(c/d) = (a*d)/(b*c).\n\nDeclaring a lemma puts Coq into an interactive proof mode.  In this mode, there are a list of subgoals -- statements to be proved -- along with hypotheses for each.  You use commands called tactics to construct proofs.  There are lots of tactics.  For example, the `intro' tactic unfolds implications (that is, it takes A -&gt; B, adds A as a hypothesis, and adds the subgoal B.)  The `rewrite' tactic applies an equality hypothesis or proposition to rewrite a term.  There are also more powerful tactics; `ring', for example, resolves ring equalities.  The proof of p3v looks like:\n\n    Lemma p3v: forall a b c d:Num,\n      b &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; c &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; d &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; (a/b)/(c/d) = (a*d)/(b*c).\n    Proof.\n    intros a b c d H H0 H1; unfold div.\n    set (H2 := inv_nonzero _ H1).\n    rewrite (p3iii _ _ H0 H2); rewrite (dbl_inv _ H1).\n    rewrite (p3iii _ _ H H0).\n    ring.\n    Qed.\n\nThe `Proof' command begins a proof and `Qed' completes it.\n\nI admit, this proof isn't particularly readable, a common criticism of automated proof assistants like Coq.  This was my first attempt.  Coq also includes a language called Ltac for programming your own tactics.  Following the philosophy from [Certified Programming with Dependent Types](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/), I started developing a set of tactics for writing (readable) proofs for arithmetic propositions.  Now the proof of p3v looks like:\n\n    Lemma p3vi: forall a b c d:Num,\n      b &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; d &lt;&gt; 0 -&gt; (a/b = c/d &lt;-&gt; a*d = b*c).\n    Proof.\n    arith.\n    Qed.\n\n(Nicer, huh?)\n\nHere's a slightly more complicated example:\n\n    Lemma p5x: forall a b:Num, a &gt;= 0 -&gt; b &gt;= 0 -&gt; a*a &lt; b*b -&gt; a &lt; b.\n    Proof.\n    intros a b Ha Hb; \n    apply contrapos;\n    forward_cases; \n      try assert (a*a &gt; a*b /\\ a*b &gt; b*b) by arith; \n      arith.\n    Qed.\n\nforward_cases implements case analysis (a = 0 or a &gt; 0?, etc.)  The basic organization is still clear from the proof, unlike the first example.  My tactics are still pretty rough, run slowly, and still don't give ideal results for larger proofs.  I'll keep playing...\n\nedit: formatting.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1294792978", "subreddit": "SpivakStudyGroup", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Now you're making dispersions that I'll end up in prison, so I'm just unstable, when compared to the human computer that is you.  The old I'm smarter than you defense.  Got ya.  Lawyers wrote our laws, which are basically common sense.  They were just the first to have the balls to write it down.  Oh yeah George Washington helped didn't he?  I think he went to war too.    You give too much credit to lawyers, half of those people are parasites.  \n\nAccording to you, lawyers are responsible for the democracy I live under.  Go visit Arlington cemetary, there's a field full of men that would disagree with you.  I never said I was building an arsenal.

No revolution can stand a chance in modern times without help from the guards.  Look at prisons, they don't get all that contraband in there without some help, do they?  I only hope some people don't follow orders and instead use their conscience.  \n\nGuns first and foremost were used by the settlers of this country, to catch dinner, and are still used to this day for this purpose.

You're like a priest giving advice on sex, not informed at all.  \n\nYou sound like Dr. Drew on drugs, drugs are bad, mmkay.  You need personal experience with something to know anything about it.  Inform yourself.  Don't keep saying I'm right, when you barely have a clue.  Don't worry there's plenty of room for trolls like you to spout off about what you know nothing about.

Now I'm not personally connected to either party so I cannot predict how they would react but I think one final push from 'Cody' will begin irrigation of the sown seeds.\n\nWhat 'Cody' wrote might seem trivial to us, but to a Theist, especially as zealous as 'Linda' in the first post; my observation is such, since it doesn't seem they both actually know each other; are pretty hard hitting arguments and for her to actually absorb them is commendable.

Gemstone and Dragonrealms had a client (used to be called the wizard) that used to have a nice little scripting language where you could set up macro's and do just about anything you wanted. (Which it still has) It also has a visual representation of your health and mana as well as your body and what part of your body is injured. Along with that it used to show a visual representation of the ways in which you can travel n s e w etc.. The best part is it had a little cooldown time like if you attack it would say wait 10 seconds and you would see a little red bar drain down so you can do your best guess at when you can attack again. Oh and they had map-able keys.\n\nIts the little things like that that kept me playing those MUD's. I would love to get into another mud but if they are lacking in any of this type of client I don't see myself playing another MUD.  Maybe I'm just spoiled.

{"body": "&gt;Your text layout engine should do that for you. Notice how you don't have to manually double-space your sentences in LaTeX.\n\nLaTeX is very uncommon in this characteristic.  Most \"layout engines\" don't bother converting spaces between sentences to em-spaces, they just rely on the period glyph supposedly containing the extra spacing necessary for sentence-end.  Problem is, most proportional fonts have the same spacing around a period as they do around a comma or a colon, *and* the extra spacing as compared to a narrow glyph like \"i\" is negligible, certainly not the extra 30-100% traditional of an em-space.  Most fonts, it's closer to 20%.

Supposedly.\n\n**Edit**:  Examples added.  Also note that Times New Roman is an example of a proportional font that *does* have more spacing around a period than around a comma.

{"body": "I don't think anything he's talking about is *wrong*, but it's a bit unconventional.  A big benefit of studying this stuff is having the ability to communicate with other musicians, and so using unconventional language or concepts might be a hindrance in some cases.  There are also practical issues that stem from how this deviates from convention.  An example:\n\nImagine you're playing a jazz tune in C Major.  This guy's general notion that every chord corresponds to one mode would lead one to believe that a Dm7 chord (the ii chord) should be played with a Dorian melody and that a Am7 chord (the vi chord) should be played with an Aeolian melody.  This is true when the song has a strong key center and doesn't change keys, then playing the same notes (C D E F G A B) will (sort of) be like playing D Dorian and A Aeolian (though not really, b/c the harmonic context would be C Major and so it would all be C Ionian).  However, many jazz players won't do this... rather, they'll actually play D Dorian over the Dm7 and A Dorian over the Am7 to get a more interesting sound.  It works b/c (usually) the guys playing the harmony are just going to play the root, 3rd, 5th, and 7th of those chords (sometimes even less) and Dorian and Aeolian are identical on those scale degrees.  Only if someone comping threw in a Am7b13 or something else that pulled a note from A Aeolian that *isn't* in A Dorian (Dorian has a major 6 (13), Aeolian has a b6 (b13)) would you have a problem.  For the same reason, you could get away with D Aeolian over that Dm7 chord unless the comping player threw in a Dm13.\n\n(This, by the way, is why pentatonic scales are so great... they include the intervals that are common across major or minor chords that would be associated with different modes: minor pentatonic is R b3 4 5 b7; these are included in all of the Dorian, Phrygian, and Aeolian modes; only the 6 (6 for Dorian, b6 for Phrygian and Aeolian) and 2 (2 for Dorian ad Aeolian, b2 for Phrygian) change across the \"minor\" modes).\n\nThis may be useful for composition or playing harmony, now that I think about it... as long as you don't rely on other people thinking this way all the time.\n\nTL;DR: He may be correct, but have fun arguing about it when you get mixed up while playing with actual people.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295323303", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Malphite may be my best champ, so here are my answers to your questions:\n\n1) Skilling order. Whether I'm playing AP/AD heavy or more tanky (99% of the time), the skill order is Q E E W E R. Then finish maxing \"Ground Slam\", \"Seismic Shard\" in that order of importance, and your Ulti whenever you can. Save ranks 2-5 of \"Brutal Strikes\" for last. \n\nThe rationale : As you say, the Shard is for harass. But, later levels of Shard give a somewhat negligible speed buff for the damage it adds. After you are 5 or so, throw a Shard, zone them a little, and drop a \"Ground Slam\" on them if they get too near. Try to get ranged creeps in the Slam as well. Slam is cheaper and does more overall with the AOE, and in general. Slam is also your primary farming spell. If the enemy champ doesn't want to touch you, at level 5 two hits on each ranged creep + a Slam is 3 kills. At level 7 its one hit on each, then a slam. Keep this up and your gold will soar, making your KDA less important. If you're having a bad farming lane, two ranged harassers, \"Heart of Gold\" can be a real boon. I'll be honest, though, only aggressive AP champs are scary early on due to your passive.  \n\n\n2)HP or Armor, why not both? Sunfire, Banshee's, Randuin's. The order is almost totally subjective to enemy team composition, IMHO. I've been playing catalyst into chain mail into Banshee's a lot lately, but when tanking it's important not to get set into a build order. Get what you need to survive the fights, but revolve around a core of powerful items for the champ so you don't get unfocused. \n\nMy item build tends to go Doran's Shield + hp pot -&gt; Heart of Gold or catalyst-&gt; Randuin's or Banshee's. After that you think about who you're fighting, and who's doing well. 6-0 Anivia? Better get Force of Nature. Yi, Xin, Sivir? Thornmail, Frozen Heart, or GA look nice.\n\nIf you're playing against a lot of AD champs, Randuin's early is a real punishment, and kills will come easily. Also, swiftness boots in that Mobafire build. What's that all about? Definitely Tabi or Merc Treads.\nMasteries : 9 - 16 - 5 \n9 - AP, cooldowns, magic pen\n16 - Armor, MR, HP regen, Health, dodge\n5 - Imp ghost, Imp regen, 1 pt in Imp exp or Mana\nRunes : HP Quint, Magic Pen red, Dodge yellow (hp, armor, mr, mana/level also viable), Mana per level Blues (cd blues also good). \nSummoners: Exhaust, Ghost, or Flash\n\n3) How to play Malphite\nThe man is definitely a tank. Huge disabling initiator, solid slow/chase, and an AOE AS debuff, coupled with an obviously fatty passive and armor buff on W. You should rack up a few early kills as his combo at level 6 is totally nuts. W -&gt; R -&gt; E -&gt; Q = dead AD hero. Pick on people who are AD, gank them, switch lanes. Do what you need to have a good matchup. If an AP hero is harassing your passive off all the time you will probably die. Late game your damage starts to peter out. Your skills are still great, and against squishies you can still pull out a combo-kill. Be content to be a tank and defend your own squishies in the late game, initiating and catching with your ult where reasonable. Having a game with a lot of assists is fine, just keep the deaths to a minimum. In fact, I'd rather assist and let our Sivir or Vlad or whoever rack up kills and ruin the other team while I soak damage for them. \n\nTL;DR: Ground slam is awesome, Health and defense can be gotten at once in items, Malphite is a tank, support, initiator.

If you want to know more I'd be happy to re-explain things more properly.\n\nIf we're in the key of C, we need to know what notes are in the key. The key of C contains these notes:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nChords in roman numeral form refer to which scale degree they start on. I, for example, starts on scale degree one, which is C. IV similarly starts on scale degree four, which is F.\n\nMost basic chords like the ones you listed are triads, which means there's three notes in the chord altogether. Without making things too complicated, you can just count every other note from the starting note until you have three notes total. I, which starts on C, will have E and G in it, making it CEG. IV will be FAC, V will be GBD, and vi will be ACE.\n\nThe numbers are upper or lowercase depending on what type of chord it is, major or minor. You can tell if a chord is major or minor by ear, since major major chords sound cheerful and minor chords sound gloomy. Theoretically speaking, a chord is major or minor based on the distance between the notes in the chord.

Cunningham, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 1. (S)\n\nSummary. Since Hamas announced the end of the \"tahdiya\" truce agreement December 19, pressure has been building in Israel for the IDF to respond more aggressively to daily barrages of rockets and mortars from Gaza. The Israeli cabinet meeting December 21 was largely devoted to a lively debate about the appropriate military response in Gaza. While Defense Minister Barak, supported by PM Olmert, has so far managed to resist the pressure for an immediate, large-scale operation, the IDF has prepared a range of contingencies, and we assume these options are now under active consideration. The contingencies range from resumption of targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders to a full-scale invasion and reoccupation of Gaza. In the current environment, even such limited operations as air strikes on Hamas or PIJ rocket launching teams could set off such an intensive barrage of rockets that the IDF could be drawn into a ground operation to stop the shelling.

End Summary.\n\nPressure Building in Israel --------------------------- 3.\n\n(C) Pressure inside Israel is building for a much tougher response to rocket and missile attacks from Gaza. While it appears that the GOI has yet to take a specific decision, the Hamas announcement of the end of the \"tahdiya\" truce and the daily rocket and mortar firing -- over thirty rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza at Israeli communities over the weekend -- is adding to the pressure for an Israeli military response. At the December 21 cabinet session, PM Olmert and Defense Minister Barak had to fend off demands from much of the rest of the government, but especially Foreign Minister Livni, Transportation Minister Mofaz and Deputy PM Ramon, for an immediate, strong military response to the rocket fire. Livni and Ramon have called for overthrowing Hamas rule in Gaza, which would probably entail occupying the entire Strip. Opposition Likud Party leader Bibi Netanyahu visited Sderot yesterday and blasted the government's failure to take stronger military action in response to the shelling. Based on public statements by Barak and IDF Chief of General Staff Ashkenazi, it is clear that Barak and the military want to take action at a time of their choosing and not forewarn Hamas exactly what they have in mind. Nonetheless, the pressure on the GOI to \"do something\" is growing.

These range from renewed targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders to limited brigade or several brigade-size ground incursions (such as the IDF conducted last March) up to a full scale combined air-land-sea invasion of Gaza. An interim operation often discussed before the tahdiya was signed in June was the IDF's seizure of the southern and northern ends of the Gaza Strip in order to stop the smuggling and make rocket launching more difficult. The precise mix of options is a political decision which the GOI probably has not yet taken and Barak is stressing the importance of limiting public discussion in order to preserve operational surprise. There is also the possibility, much discussed in the media here, that given the build-up in Hamas' rocket stockpiles and the extension of their range, even such limited Israeli military operations as air strikes on rocket squads could lead Hamas and the other organizations to launch massive barrages of rockets, which could in turn force the IDF to go in on the ground to stop it. In this environment, there is no guarantee that what starts out as a limited operation will remain that way.\n\n5.

Our recommendation is that the USG start with putting the blame on Hamas for the illegitimacy of its rule in Gaza, its policy of firing or allowing other factions to fire rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian targets, and its decision to end the \"tahdiya\" calming period; and support for Israel's right to defend itself, while also emphasizing our concern for the welfare of innocent Palestinian civilians and U.S. readiness to provide emergency humanitarian relief.

Cunningham, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 1. (S)\n\nSummary. Since Hamas announced the end of the \"tahdiya\" truce agreement December 19, pressure has been building in Israel for the IDF to respond more aggressively to daily barrages of rockets and mortars from Gaza. The Israeli cabinet meeting December 21 was largely devoted to a lively debate about the appropriate military response in Gaza. While Defense Minister Barak, supported by PM Olmert, has so far managed to resist the pressure for an immediate, large-scale operation, the IDF has prepared a range of contingencies, and we assume these options are now under active consideration. The contingencies range from resumption of targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders to a full-scale invasion and reoccupation of Gaza.

(C) Summary:\n\nThe IDF continued its deployment of ground forces around the Gaza periphery on December 29, with elements of at least three armored and two infantry brigades taking up positions opposite Gaza City and Beit Hanoun. Air strikes against strategic and tactical targets continued throughout the day, as did rocket and mortar fire from the Gaza Strip. One Israeli civilian was killed when a rocket landed in Ashkelon on the morning of December 29. According to IDF contacts, 63 truckloads of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza via Kerem Shalom during the day on December 29, with further deliveries scheduled for December 30. Israeli political leaders, including FM Livni and MoD Barak, caution that military operations could continue for weeks, and that the goal is to change the strategic environment and destroy Hamas' offensive rocket capabilities. Separately, Bank Hapoalim and Bank Discount announced that they will cease providing correspondent banking services to Gaza at midnight on December 31. End summary.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2.\n\n(SBU) The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is continuing its strategic campaign against Hamas leadership, personnel and infrastructure throughout Gaza. In addition to targets associated with the manufacture, storage and deployment of Kassam rockets, the IAF has also attacked the Hamas Interior Ministry, Islamic University (which contains labs that the GOI says are active in weapons and explosives research for Hamas), and a Hamas guest house used for official visitors. The IDF Spokesperson announced that the office of Hamas PM Ismail Haniyeh was attacked overnight (note: speaking on Israeli radio December 29, Deputy Defense Minister Vilnai denied that Haniyeh was personally targeted in the airstrike), as were \"dozens of other Hamas-related targets.\" Israeli Naval forces also attacked Hamas vessels and coastal structures overnight, according to the Spokesperson,s office. In his radio interview, Deputy Defense Minister Vilnai also said the IDF has high morale, and in contrast to the Second Lebanon War, all levels of the military know their task and what is expected of them. Vilnai said the operations will last a long time, \"perhaps much longer than people expect.\" Asked to comment on a possible ground campaign, he declined to answer, saying he did not intend to broadcast to Hamas Israel's military intentions.\n\n3. (S/NF) At 16:00 on December 28, the IDF bombed the Phiadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, destroying 39-40 smuggling tunnels. No Egyptian border guards were harmed. IDF contacts have repeatedly told DATT that the targeting of the tunnels was coordinated with Egypt, and that they had passed the coordinates of the attack points to the Egyptians to enable them to ensure the safety of their border forces.\n\n4. (SBU) As of 15:00 local December 29, 50 rockets have been fired into Israel today from Gaza, according to press reports. One Israeli was killed and 14-16 wounded when a Grad-type rocket struck a construction site in Ashkelon during the morning. Two Israelis have been killed since the start of operation \"Cast Lead\" on December 27. On December 28, two 122 mm Katyusha rockets struck areas in or near the city of Ashdod, in what appears to be the first attack by rockets with a range in excess of 30 km.\n\n5. (S/NF) The IDF is continuing its deployment of ground forces around the Gaza periphery, although no ground operations had been initiated as of 18:00. This morning the IDF closed most areas bordering the Gaza Strip to allow for the positioning of armor and infantry units. On December 28, DAO officers observed the movement of M-109 artillery and support/ammunition vehicles into the vicinity of Gaza. Heavy trucks laden with concrete shelters, water storage tanks and other logistical equipment intended to support ground operations were also observed deploying around the Gaza border. DAO also observed the movement of Merkava 3 tanks from the 188 Armor Brigade, which is normally deployed on the Lebanese border, into the vicinity of Gaza.\n\n6. (S/NF) During a subsequent observation mission this morning, DAO officers observed a further significant increase in the IDF ground forces presence around Gaza. Elements of three armor brigades, including artillery batteries and Merkava 3 and 4 tanks, and two infantry brigades were deployed opposite Gaza City and Beit Hanoun.\n\nTEL AVIV 00002906 002 OF 003 Political Developments ----------------------- 7.\n\n(U) During a special Knesset session to discuss the military operations this morning, DefMin Barak called the operation an \"all-out war against Hamas\" and said it would be \"widened and deepened as is necessary.\" He said the security services had spent \"months\" preparing for the operation, and would carry it out until Hamas is not longer capable of launching rockets at Israeli towns. While somewhat less hawkish, FM Livni,s remarks to the Knesset made clear that Israel expects the international community to blame Hamas, not Israel, for the current hostilities and the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\n\n8. (C) During a briefing in Sderot for the diplomatic corps on December 28, Livni and MoD Pol-Mil Director Amos Gilad stressed that Israel needs the support of the international community for an extended military operation designed not to overthrow the Hamas regime in Gaza, but to change the strategic environment by force. Israel will not tolerate continued rocket attacks on its citizens and the operation will continue for weeks. Livni said if the international community forces Israel to stop too soon, Israel will have to do it all over in the near future. She expressed understanding of President Abbas, dilemma and pressure on him to condemn Israeli actions, but she noted that even he had blamed Hamas while in Cairo, and she asked why the rest of the international community was finding it hard to do the same. \"This is the minimum we expect of you,\" she told the assembled diplomats. Livni also said the Gaza operation was in the longer run interests of peace with the Palestinians since Israel could not sign a peace agreement with a Palestinian Authority that did not have control over Gaza.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499294", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

(S) PA security chiefs met with top IDF and COGAT officers late December 29 at Bet El (outside Ramallah) to discuss the West Bank security situation in light of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip. PA security chiefs told ConGenOffs that the PA urged the IDF to avoid Palestinian demonstrations and to refrain from using live ammunition, which killed three Palestinian demonstrators in recent days. According to PA commanders, the two sides agreed to expedite coordination and exchange information on disturbances and agreed both sides have an interest in avoiding violent clashes. Separately, PM Salam Fayyad confirmed to the Consul General that Israeli MoD officials have expressed their understanding of the need to avoid confrontations in the West Bank. End summary.\n\n2. (S) According to PA National Security Forces (NSF) commander MG Thiab Mustafa Ali (Abu al-Fatah), PA Joint Security Committees (JSC) commander BG Qays Makhzumi and other senior security contacts, PA commanders met with IDF West Bank Division Commander BG Noam Tibon, West Bank COGAT Director BG Yoav (Poly) Mordechai and IDF staff principals late December 29 at Bet El DCL (District Coordination Liaison) office outside Ramallah. In addition to MG Ali and Makhzumi, PA police chief MG Hazim Attallah, Preventive Security (PSO) director MG Ziad Hab al-Rih, acting General Intelligence (Mukhabarat) chief Muhammad Thib Mansur, and Military Intelligence (Istikhbarat) chief BG Majid al-Farraj attended the meeting. Security commanders told ConGenOffs that they discussed the overall security situation the West Bank in light of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip, and better methods of dealing with protests.\n\nPA Commanders Urge IDF to Avoid Use of Live Ammunition ---------------------------- 3.\n\n(C) PA commanders complained about IDF use of live ammunition, responsible for three Palestinian fatalities in December 27-28 protests. MG Ali said IDF commanders told them live ammunition is the last resort when dealing with Palestinian demonstrators, and IDF rules of engagement only authorize it when the lives of IDF soldiers or Israeli citizens are at immediate risk. PA security chiefs said IDF BG Tibon reported that the Nil'in village shooting (in which two Palestinian were killed by IDF fire) was quickly investigated by the IDF, and that an IDF officer has already been referred to a disciplinary board for improper use of live ammunition during the incident. According to MG Ali, both BGs Tibon and Mordechai said they re-issued instructions to all forces operating in the West Bank to abide strictly by rules of engagement and refrain from using live rounds against unarmed demonstrators.\n\n4. (C) MG Ali added that IDF commanders said that in the Silwad incidents the Palestinian was about to throw a firebomb, thus endangering soldiers' lives, and that according to IDF rules of engagement Palestinians with firebombs are a threat to life and can be engaged with live ammunition. He added that both IDF commanders agreed, however, that in most cases, even demonstrators with firebombs should not be engaged, and troops should find non-lethal means of controlling the situation.\n\nBoth Sides Agree to Increase Coordination ----------------------------------------- 5.\n\n(S) According to PA security chiefs, the second part of the meeting was dedicated to a review the West Bank security situation. PA commanders said they told IDF officers that President Abbas and PM Fayyad both directed them to avoid situations that could develop into confrontations with the IDF. The security chiefs said Abbas and Fayyad passed a message to all Palestinian factions, at a PLO Executive Committee meeting on December 29, that only peaceful marches away from flashpoints would be permitted. PA commanders noted they have no control on over B/C areas such as Qalandiya and Nil'in, and would need IDF approval to move PA forces to those areas to prevent clashes between protesters and the IDF. PA commanders said both sides agreed that Hebron is a problem, and cooperation on a case-by-case basis is critical. PA commanders said their IDF counterparts agreed to expedite coordination and movement requests and exchange information on possible disturbances, as both sides have an interest in preventing West Bank violence. They said both sides also agreed not to leak substantive discussions about the meeting to the press, given the sensitivity of JERUSALEM 00002314 002 OF 002 PA-GOI security coordination in a time of Palestinian outrage over events in Gaza.\n\nFayyad Confirms MoD Contacts ---------------------------- 6.\n\n(S) In a separate conversation with the Consul General, PM Fayyad said he had received messages from the Israeli MoD on December 29 indicating that the Israeli security leadership understands the need for the IDF to deploy in the West Bank in a way that will minimize confrontations with Palestinian civilians. Fayyad said he was encouraged by the messages, but would watch carefully to see how these instructions are implemented by IDF commanders on the ground.

No ground operations have been initiated; the senior GOI leadership is discussing a range of options. Air strikes during the early morning hours of December 30 destroyed a number of Hamas strategic and tactical targets, including a government complex in Gaza City. Rockets and mortars from Gaza continued to strike Israel, reaching as far north as Yavne and as far east as Rahat; one Israeli woman in Ashdod and an IDF soldier near Nahal Oz were killed in rocket strikes during the evening of December 29. According to the IDF, 93 truckloads of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing during the day on December 30. During a strategic assessment meeting on December 29, PM Olmert challenged GOI officials to avoid talk of a ceasefire, and directed IDF forces to continue their operations with an undefined duration. An Israeli Navy vessel rammed a boat from the Free Gaza movement carrying humanitarian assistance to Gaza from Cyprus, forcing it to turn back. The Free Gaza boat sustained damage but was able to travel north to the Lebanese port of Tyre. The Embassy disseminated a warden message to avoid the 30km area from Gaza due to on-going IDF operations and rocket attacks. End summary.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2.\n\n(SBU) Israeli air and naval forces attacked dozens of Hamas targets throughout the Gaza Strip overnight and during the morning hours of December 30. According to the IDF Spokesperson, targets included three buildings in the Hamas government complex -- including the Hamas ministries of interior and foreign affairs and PM's offices -- in the Tel Al-Hawa neighborhood, Hamas training camps and outposts, stations held by Hamas naval forces, a vehicle transporting a stockpile of Grad missiles, rocket launchers, a weaponry manufacturing facility, and sites used as headquarters by terror cells. Israeli media reported that two top Hamas weapons engineers were killed in the December 29 strike on research labs at the Islamic University.\n\n3. (S/NF) The IDF continues its deployment of ground forces around the Gaza periphery, although no ground operations had been initiated as of 1800 local. Poor weather conditions may have been a contributing factor, although late-breaking press reports also indicate that \"senior defense officials\" may recommend a 48-hour truce to evaluate Hamas' reaction prior to launching any ground offensive. Israel Defense Intelligence (IDI) sources told DAO officers that ground operations could begin at any time; a deciding factor would be weather conditions facilitating the ability to provide close air support and medical evacuation. During the evening of December 29, rain and lowered ceilings dominated weather conditions; overcast skies were prevalent over Gaza during much of the day on December 30. The tempo of air operations decreased greatly during the afternoon of December 30.\n\n4. (S) The IDF continues to reinforce and increase its logistical footprint around Gaza. DAO officers observed more robust logistical support for units in assembly areas at Erez Crossing and at the artillery position located south of Kibbutz Nir'am. Unit flags, tents, and port-a-johns have been erected at these locations. Overnight, reinforcements from units previously unobserved in the Gaza sector arrived, including elements of the Givati Brigade, the Golani Brigade's 12th Battalion, and the Kfir Brigade's Heruv Battalion. DAO reports that the preponderance of IDF units are located around the northern half of Gaza; the deployment of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with mounted mock turrets may represent decoy attempts to portray a larger presence in the south.\n\n5. (S) DATT reports that during a briefing to military attaches and UN military representatives on December 29, IDF Strategic Division Commander Brigadier General Yossi Heyman noted the 122mm rocket attacks on the port of Ashdod demonstrated that Hamas is capable of launching rockets of up to 35km -- putting more than 500,000 Israelis in the range of rockets emanating from Gaza. BG Heyman said the IDF was \"prepared for a long operation,\" and stressed that the IDF was doing its best to minimize civilian casualties. Reserve Brigadier General Baruch Spiegel informally mentioned to embassy officers December 30 that the IDF is ready to carry out a detailed plan for ground operations with multiple TEL AVIV 00002922 002 OF 003 stages and a range of levels of intensity, but is waiting for orders from the political level -- presumably the inner war cabinet of PM Olmert, Defense Minister Barak, Foreign Minister Livni, and Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi. Spiegel said he thought the decision whether to launch a ground operation would be made in the next 48 hours. He commented that the IDF is not in a hurry and can continue to build up ground forces without pressure to act. Spiegel and his colleague at the Economic Cooperation Foundation Boaz Karni told us that the GOI's goal of a \"sustainable ceasefire\" was being complicated by the fact that senior Hamas officials in Gaza have all gone underground and are not able to communicate with potential mediators.\n\n6. (SBU) As of 1715 local December 30, approximately 20 rockets have been fired throughout the day from Gaza, according to press reports. Most of these rockets landed in or near Sderot, injuring two Israelis and damaging several properties. One rocket struck as far east as the vicinity of Rahat; another Qassam rocket scored a direct hit on a kibbutz dining hall in the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council. According to the Israeli MFA, approximately 90 rockets were fired from Gaza at Israel on December 29. Three Israelis were killed by rocket and mortar fire on December 29, including a construction worker in Ashkelon (Grad-type rocket), a soldier in the Nahal Oz area (Qassam/mortar attack), and a woman in Ashdod (Grad-type rocket). Four Israelis have been killed since the start of operation \"Cast Lead\" on December 27. During the evening of December 29, several rockets hit in or near Okafim in the east and Yavne in the north, demonstrating increasing range. Israeli schools in a 30km radius from Gaza remained closed on December 30.\n\nPolitical Developments ---------------------- 7.\n\n(SBU) According to media reports, during a December 29 evening situation assessment meeting with FM Livni, Defense Minister Barak, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi, Shin Bet Director Diskin, and Mossad Director Dagan, PM Olmert reportedly instructed meeting attendees not to talk about a cease-fire with Hamas. He ordered the IDF to continue its actions with an undefined end to the operation. Olmert stressed that Israel will act against Hamas \"with an iron fist,\" but would treat the population in Gaza \"with silk gloves\" by ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid, food, and other needs.\n\n8. (SBU) Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Binyamin Ben-Eliezer (Labor Party) said to the press that Israel would not cease the operation in Gaza until Hamas stopped firing rockets at Israel. He said the operation will continue until a \"new reality\" is created in which communities on the Gaza periphery can \"lead their lives quietly.\" Minister for Industry, Trade and Labor Eli Yishai (Shas Party) commented that the Israeli elections scheduled for February 10 should not be postponed due to the situation in Gaza.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499382", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

(S)\n\nSUMMARY: While IDF troops remained on hold but still poised for a ground attack, rocket fire continues into Israel from Gaza, including increased attacks beyond 30km, and the first hit in the city of Be'er Sheva. Israeli airstrikes are ongoing, although at a slowed tempo, with attacks reported along the Philadelphi corridor, in northern Gaza, and on government buildings including the Hamas \"Prime Minister's Offices.\" Meanwhile, according to press reports, the \"security kitchen cabinet\" of PM Olmert, DM Barak and FM Livni decided to reject the French proposal for a 48-hour humanitarian cease-fire, calling it unrealistic because it was not permanent, placed limited demands on Hamas, and was unnecessary as no humanitarian crisis has developed in Gaza. According to COGAT, over 100 truckloads of humanitarian aid are scheduled to enter Gaza on December 31 through the Kerem Shalom crossing, while the Karni and Nahal Oz crossings remain closed due to ongoing mortar fire in the area. The Erez crossing remains open but restricted. With Karni and Nahal Oz closed, COGAT says it is working with UNRWA on logistically feasible options for bringing bulk grain and fuel through Kerem Shalom. Finally, the Bank of Israel has also given its approval for Bank Hapoalim and Discount Bank to end their correspondent relationship with Gaza banks as of January 1.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2. (S) DAO sources report that the IAF conducted 35 strikes overnight, withIsraeli Naval forces also striking targets withinGaza. This includes attacks against a reported Haas training camp in northern Gaza, a second strie along the Philadelphi corridor against smuggling tunnels, and the bombing of additional government buildings including the office building of Hamas \"Prime Minister\" Ismayil Haniyah. No casualties were reported in these actions, although there are reports of civilian casualties in other strikes, including one that targeted a house in the Jabalya refugee camp.\n\n3. (S) At 1430 local, DAO observers reported an increase in IDF ground forces (over levels observed December 30) along the Gaza border, including elements of at least four infantry and three armor brigades. Unlike during previous observation missions, IDF forces outside the northern Gaza Strip were observed wearing full combat gear and deployed in a combat-ready stance. Additional roads, including highway 4 north of the Erez crossing, were closed, and a large staging area -- with lights, generators, field tents, water tanks and other structures -- had been completed adjacent to the northeast corner of the Gaza Strip.\n\n4. (S//NF) Rocket fire into Israel continues as several more towns suffered their first hit, including at least 5 impacts in Be'er Sheva, the principal city in the Negev. Be'er Sheva is Israel's sixth largest city, after Ashdod (which is also under attack), with a population of 200,000. The first rocket strike into Be'er Sheva was a 122mm Grad that the IDF told the DAO they believe the Grad was made in China but are analyzing it further before confirming.\n\n5. (U) While no one was injured in the initial Be'er Sheva attack, it hit an empty kindergarten and the news photos of the burned dolls and destroyed children's toys elicited a strong response from authorities and the public. The IDF has expanded its orders to close the schools to additional \"third ring\" cities, including Be'er Sheva, and asked residents to stay in or near shelters and avoid public gatherings. At least five more rockets have hit Be'er Sheva on December 31, and attacks are reported on other towns including Ashkelon and Yavneh. Early estimates are over 40 Qassam, Katyusha and Grad rockets fired as of 1430 local on December 31.\n\nHumanitarian Assistance ----------------------- 6.\n\n(U) COGAT told Emboffs that Kerem Shalom and Erez remain open, while Nahal Oz and Karni are still closed due to continued attacks in the vicinity of the crossings. COGAT says as of mid-day over 80 trucks have passed through Kerem Shalom, with a target of over 100 trucks before the crossing closes at 1500. As of 1430, COGAT was not able to provide the number of people that have crossed through Erez, though at least four crossing permits have been issued.\n\n7. (SBU) COGAT officials also said that they have yet to receive a response from UNRWA on the feasibility of transferring the bulk grain at the Karni crossing into 1-ton plastic sacks and moving them through Kerem Shalom. COGAT says it is also still investigating ways that it can move cooking gas and diesel fuel through Kerem Shalom that meet public safety standards. COGAT officials also told EconCouns that two planeloads of aid are expected today and tomorrow from Greece, Norway and the WHO. However, the COGAT official warned that, due to capacity issues, it will take a week and a half to move these goods through Kerem Shalom.\n\nPolitical Developments ---------------------- 8. (C)\n\nPrime Minister Olmert, Minister of Defense Barak and Foreign Miniter Livni met last night and rejected the possibility of a 48-hour humanitarian ceasefire as suggested by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson called the proposal unrealistic because it was a unilateral Israeli ceasefire with no mechanism to ensure Hamas ceases rocket fire, smuggling, and other terrorist activity. Barak was reportedly in favor of the ceasefire to calm the international community, while Olmert and Livni took a harder line according to press reports. Nimrod Barkan, head of the MFA Political Research Department, told A/DCM on December 31 that Barak's primary interest in the 48-hour ceasefire was due to the poor weather expected over the next two days.\n\n9. (U) The full security cabinet met on December 31 to receive a security briefing and discuss a ground operation. Barak has already requested that another 2,500 reservists be activated. During the meeting, Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin reportedly said that the operations against Hamas infrastructure had been more effective than anticipated and that no humanitarian crisis exists in Gaza.\n\n10. (U) In the press, pundits are divided over whether Israel should accept a ceasefire or continue to a more-costly ground operation. Speculation is also growing over the political motivations of the Gaza operation. Opposition leader and PM candidate Benjamin Netanyahu has so far expressed complete support for the government, while the first polls released since the operation began show gains for both Labor and Kadima, with Kadima now even with Likud at 29 seats apiece.\n\n11. (SBU) Israeli Arabs: Protests against the Gaza operation continue in Israeli-Arab and mixed Jewish-Arab towns and cities. While most of these demonstrations have ended peacefully, others have resulted in clashes with police or Jewish counter-protesters. Minor clashes between Arab and Jewish students at Haifa University have occurred each day since December 29. The far-left and predominantly Arab Hadash Party is organizing what it hopes will be a very large demonstration in Tel Aviv on the evening of January 3. At the same time, small groups of Israeli-Arab youths continue to throw stones at cars and block roads throughout the north, with incidents reported in Uhm al-Fahm, Nazareth, Akko and dozens of smaller towns. Media reports on December 31 indicate that police have arrested over 300 Israeli Arabs, a large portion of them minors, for causing violent disturbances and disrupting traffic. POL and DAO officers have seen very large numbers of Israeli police and border police deployed in visible locations throughout the north since the start of military operations on December 27.\n\n********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499432", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

TEL AVIV 2930 B. TEL AVIV 2922 C. TEL AVIV 2906\n\nClassified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers for reasons 1.4 (B/D).\n\n1. (C) SUMMARY: Local and international media highlighted FM Livni,s January 1 comments in Paris that a ceasefire was unnecessary and would give Hamas time to regroup. Israeli troops deployed around Gaza have relaxed their posture, but remain prepared for ground incursions. Rocket and mortar strikes against southern Israeli towns have decreased, but Grad-type rockets continue to impact Be,er Sheva; no additional Israeli deaths were reported on January 1 or 2. Israeli Air Force (IAF) operations against Hamas targets continued on January 1 and 2, killing Nizar Rayan, reportedly one of the IDF's top targets and the first senior Hamas official killed in Operation Cast Lead, along with 15 members of his family, according to press reports. The IAF also destroyed a mosque reportedly serving as a weapons depot and communications hub. On the morning of January 2, Embassy Tel Aviv, Consulate-General Jerusalem and Embassy Amman facilitated the evacuation of 27 American citizens and their family members from Gaza. END SUMMARY.\n\nPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 2. (SBU) After meeting with French President Sarkozy in Paris on January 1, FM Livni reiterated the cabinet,s December 31 decision to reject a 48-hour ceasefire, saying there was no humanitarian crisis in Gaza and therefore no need for a humanitarian ceasefire. Sarkozy restated his intention to visit the region next week. On January 1, France ceded the rotating EU presidency to the Czech Republic, which announced plans to dispatch a delegation to Jerusalem, Ramallah, Amman, and Cairo on January 4 in support of the French ceasefire proposal. Turkish PM Erdogan,s diplomatic tour continued on January 1 with a stop in Cairo after meeting Syrian President Asad on December 31; he is expected to visit Riyadh on January 3. Turkish DCM Bozay provided a readout of President Gul's January 1 conversation with President Peres. Gul reportedly expressed understanding of Israel's need to take action against terrorist attacks, noting that Turkey was also a victim of terrorism, but cautioned Peres that the operation needed to be brought to a quick conclusion due to the impact on Muslim public opinion. Peres responded that he hoped Israeli military operations could be completed soon, but said Hamas was not showing any sign of readiness to accept a ceasefire on terms acceptable to Israel. Local reaction to the December 31 statement by Arab League FMs has been muted.\n\n3. (C) Neither the inner cabinet nor full security cabinet have convened since the December 31 meeting in which cabinet members agreed upon conditions for a ceasefire and ended press speculation of dissent by DM Barak; the next regular cabinet meeting will be on January 4. While reportedly pushing for a major but brief ground incursion, Ha,aretz reports that defense officials recommend parallel preparation of a diplomatic exit strategy that would include an agreement brokered with Hamas; FM Livni remarked in Paris that a ceasefire negotiated directly with Hamas was unacceptable as it would legitimize the group,s hold over Gaza.\n\n4. (U) Polling results in advance of Knesset elections still scheduled for February 10 continue to show gains for DM Barak,s Labor Party, with unclear results for FM Livni,s Kadima Party and former PM Netanyahu,s Likud Party. Media commentators agree that Barak has the most to gain from the Gaza operation, though much depends upon its outcome. A Ma,ariv-Teleseeker poll published January 2 shows the Labor Party earning 16 Knesset seats if elections were held today (up from 11 on December 25), while Likud and Kadima would each take 28 (down from 29 for Likud and 30 for Kadima). The same poll showed public support for the ongoing operations against Hamas at 93 percent, with 40 percent favoring continued air attacks only, 41 percent in favor of a ground incursion, and nine percent advocating an immediate ceasefire. 77 percent of the public believes Israel should only accept a ceasefire if it includes negotiations for the release of Gilad Shalit. (Note: The Ma,ariv-Teleseeker poll showed significantly stronger support for ongoing operations in Gaza than a January 1 Ha,aretz poll that included Israeli Arabs, though their influence on government decision making is minimal, leading us to believe they were excluded from the Ma,ariv poll.) The Likud Party has put up billboards all over Tel Aviv with the slogan \"strong together\" and in smaller print, \"Likud supports our soldiers and the residents of the south.\" In keeping with Bibi Netanyahu's pledge to suspend his electoral campaign during the fighting, the billboards do not refer to Netanyahu directly.\n\nMILITARY OPERATIONS 5. (S) The Israeli Defense Forces, (IDF) ground buildup appears to have slowed after the initial influx of armor and infantry to the Gaza perimeter. Elements of at least three armor and four infantry brigades remain deployed along the TEL AVIV 00000005 002 OF 002 northern Gaza strip. DAO reports no indications of an imminent ground incursion. IDF maintenance and logistical activity continued on January 2, but IDF troops displayed a more relaxed posture than on January 1. DAO assesses that the IDF has not yet deployed sufficient forces for a deep, sustained ground operation, but that more limited incursions into northern Gaza could occur with little or no warning.\n\n6. (SBU) Despite cleared skies over Gaza, the pace of Israeli Air Force (IAF) operations has decreased, with 48 sorties on January 1, according to the IDF. Media reports speculate that the IAF is running out of quality targets and may soon be forced to either scale back operations or turn the fighting over to ground forces. IAF operations on January 1 included a strike that killed senior Hamas official Nizar Rayan in his Jabaliya home, reportedly along with his four wives and 11 of his children. Rayan was reportedly on the IDF's list of top Hamas targets, and was the first senior Hamas political official killed in Operation Cast Lead. IAF jets also bombed a mosque in the Jabaliya area that, according to IDF sources, served as a command and control hub for Hamas militants and storage site for Grad-type and Qassam rockets. As of 12:00 on January 2, the IAF had carried out an additional 20 strikes, mostly targeting the homes of Hamas militants; IDF sources stress that residents received prior warnings to evacuate by leaflet, phone, or text message, although one prominent commentator quoted military sources as saying that at least in the Rayan attack, no one answered the phone when it rang 10 minutes prior to the attack.\n\n7. (SBU) IDF sources report that 35 rockets, including 10 Grad-type, and four mortar rounds were fired into Israel on January 1, with several rockets striking in or around Be,er Sheva, with no deaths or injuries. As of 15:00 on January 2 approximately 20 additional rockets had been launched from Gaza, impacting Ashkelon, Sdot Negev, and Eshkol; one woman was reported injured by shrapnel. Israeli towns and cities within 40km of Gaza remain under special alert, expanded from 30km after rockets began striking Be,er Sheva on December 31. Schools remain closed, and residents have been asked to stay in or near shelters.\n\nAMCIT EVACUATION 8. (SBU) On the morning of January 2 Embassy Tel Aviv, Consulate-General Jerusalem, and Embassy Amman coordinated the evacuation of 27 American citizens (Amcits) and non-Amcit family members from Gaza via the Erez crossing; an additional seven Amcits on the initial evacuation list chose to remain in Gaza. As of 14:00 the 27 evacuees were proceeding through the Allenby border crossing from Israel into Jordan after transiting Israel under embassy escort. A total of 234 third country nationals were evacuated through Erez during the day.\n\nHUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 9. (SBU) The Office for Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) announced that 60 trucks carrying 1,360 tons of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza from Israel via the Kerem Shalom crossing on January 1, including 10 UN Relief and Works Agency trucks with cooking oil and seven with flour, three trucks with medical supplies from Egypt, seven trucks with food from Jordan, and two International Committee of the Red Cross trucks carrying medical supplies. 64 trucks entered Gaza on January 2, according to COGAT (of 72 that were initially expected). According to USAID, the Kerem Shalom crossing remained open as of 15:00 on January 2, while the Rafah crossing into Egypt opened only briefly for the evacuation of 17 wounded Palestinians and entry of six Egyptian trucks carrying medical supplies. The Karni grain conveyor and Nahal Oz fuel pipeline remained closed on January 1 and 2.\n\n10. (SBU) Turkish DCM Bozay told us today that Turkey had completed the coordination with COGAT of substantial Turkish humanitarian assistance, including five ambulances, 330 tons of flour, 11,000 dried food parcels (11 tons), and 13 tons of medical supplies, all of which has now entered Gaza. Bozay said he received full cooperation from Israeli officials, including clearance of the ambulances through the Ashdod port within two days. Based on the success of these shipments, the Turks reportedly are planning additional humanitarian relief, including a number of small generators for Gaza's hospital.\n\n********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499454", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

(C)\n\nSummary. A wide selection of Gaza Strip political, business, civil society, academic and NGO contacts report fear of airstrikes, deteriorating conditions, minimal or no electricity, increasing food pressures, and a gloomy outlook for resolution of current hostilities. Several who are strongly opposed to Hamas said they have little hope that Hamas will lose control or change its behavior due to Israel's military operations. End summary.\n\nGaza PLO ExComm Member: Situation Deteriorating; Hamas Unwilling to Return to Ceasefire; -------------------------------------- 2. (C)\n\nGaza City-based PLO Executive Committee member Riyad al-Khudari (independent, please protect) told PolOff January 2 that he doubts Hamas will accept a mutual cessation of hostilities, as Hamas' objective is permanently reopening the crossings, not halting Israeli attacks or protecting Gaza's population. He said ending the fighting will be difficult, as Hamas has made Gaza into an armed camp and does not fear an Israeli invasion. They are too stubborn, he believes, to agree to a ceasefire that does not include guarantees on the crossings. Al-Khudari said most airstrikes have killed civil police, not Izz al-Din al-Qassam fighters, and, except for Nizar Rayyan, few Hamas leaders have been hit. He said his neighborhood (an upscale part of Shaykh Radwan) has been without electricity for three days, and their house has no heat, with only cooking gas left. Al-Khudari, who is also a university trustee, said all schools and universities in Gaza are closed and will not open anytime soon.\n\nGaza PLC Member: Outraged at Israeli Targeting of Non-Hamas Institutions ------------------------------------ 3. (C)\n\nGaza-based Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) member Rawiya al-Shawwa told PolOff that she and most Gazans are outraged by Israeli targeting of the PLC building, where she and several Fatah PLC members kept offices. She said the building had only recently been completed and complained it was a PA facility, not used by Hamas as a faction, and its destruction is an affront to the PA and delegitimizes the PLC as an institution. She worries that her home in Shuja'iya will be destroyed in fighting, as houses nearby have been bombed by the IAF and it lies on a main avenue of approach to Gaza City from the border with Israel.\n\nKey UN OCHA Contact's House Destroyed, Airstrikes Jarring Children --------------------------- 4. (C)\n\nHamada al-Bayari, a key Economic/crossings contact, told EconOff January 2 that his house was largely destroyed when IAF ordnance struck a house nearby. He said the bomb targeted a single house but destroyed or heavily damaged all the houses on his street. He said airstrikes are having a severe psychological impact on his children, who have become distant and distrustful. He said he was fortunate to have relocated his family to an in-laws' house the night before his house was wrecked.\n\nAmerican Corner Director: Situation Terrible for the Children; Food Shortages Acute -------------------------------------- 5. (C)\n\nGaza City-based Dr. Awni Karzon, Director of Gaza's American Corner, told PDoff January 2 that his house was heavily damaged in IAF strikes on Justice Ministry buildings, and he had to relocate his family to a friend's house. He said his family could not take anything from the remains of his house, and they are sharing food provided by his hosts. The adults are eating little themselves so the children can eat. Most food stores in his area are closed, he said, and few Gazans will venture outside because of airstrikes.\n\nGovernor's Office Contact: No Electricity for Days, No Confidence Hamas Will Weaken ----------------------------------------- 6. (C)\n\nThe Gaza Governor's office manager, a 35-year-old mother who lives in Rimal (northwest Gaza City) near the ocean, said she has had no electricity for three days, and only had a few hours of electricity daily since Israeli airstrikes began on December 27. She said her home has no heat, and her family must simply bundle up throughout the day for warmth. She said she hates Hamas and sympathizes with Israel's need to stop rockets, but commented that she sees little connection between Israel's bombing targets and Hamas, JERUSALEM 00000017 002 OF 002 and doubts current military operations will weaken Hamas' grip on power.\n\nDemocracy Program Manager: Israel Targeting Our Civil Infrastructure More than Hamas ------------------------------------ 7. (C)\n\nManal al-Bashti, program manager of a USAID-funded civil society/democracy project, told USAID staff that Israeli airstrikes have frequently targeted government institutions, such as the PA Education Ministry building and PLC headquarters, that have no connection to Hamas' military forces or rockets. She commented that Israel's military campaign seemed more directed at destroying Palestinian civil infrastructure than degrading Hamas' capabilities to attack Israel. She said moderates and civilians are suffering the most from the fighting.\n\nAMIDEAST Director: Bombing, Food Shortages Threaten Civilians ---------------------------- 8. (C)\n\nGaza AMIDEAST Director Anis Abu Hashim told PDoff January 2 that his multi-story apartment building shook so much from nearby bombings that he worried his home had become structurally unsound. He said his family has had no electricity or water for four days, and must transport jugs of water from street level. He said he does not go outside except when forced to look for food, but on a recent search did not find any stores open except for a donkey cart selling vegetables. He wanted to buy bread, but said the line outside the bakery was at least four hours long, and did not want to risk being exposed during airstrikes.

(S)\n\nAs of 1500 hrs. local on January 4, Egyptian military contacts said Egypt closed the Rafah border crossing on January 4 after the Israelis gave advanced warning of their ground invasion and additional air strikes on the smuggling tunnels along the Gaza-Rafah border. According to the Egyptian military, the air strikes against the tunnels \"appear to be effective8 and the Egyptian Border Guards have seen \"no tunnel smuggling activity8 since Israel began bombing Gaza. The Ministry Of Defense will brief military attaches and diplomats on January 5 on their views of the Gaza situation.\n\n2. (SBU) The Egypt-Gaza border remains stable, with a reported 7000 central security forces (civilian, not military) providing additional security throughout Rafah, al-Arish, and the major roads across northern Sinai.\n\n3. (SBU) On January 3, an Egyptian border guard was shot and wounded by Palestinian gunfire. Until January 4, the Egyptians continued to open the Rafah crossing for the transfer of medical supplies into Gaza and to receive injured Palestinians. The transfer of humanitarian assistance had been slow, as all shipments were transferred by hand between Egyptian and Palestinian trucks. However, even this traffic across the Rafah border has now ceased.\n\n4. (U) According to press reports, 102 Palestinians have been treated in Egyptian hospitals since hostilities began and 294 Palestinians have been allowed back into Gaza. Wounded Palestinians are being initially taken to two hospitals in al-Arish ) al-Arish General and Mubarak Armed Forces ) and then transferred as needed to Ministry of Health or military hospitals in Cairo and Ismailia.\n\n------------------------------ Demonstrations January 3 and 4 ------------------------------ 5. (C)\n\nAccording to independent daily \"Al-Masry Al-Youm (AMAY),\" on January 3, the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organized a mass demonstration of 10,000 at the Doctors' Syndicate in Kafr El-Sheikh in the northern Delta. If this estimate is accurate, it would probably be the largest demonstration in Egypt since the Israeli attacks on Gaza began December 27. According to press reports, there were small demonstrations January 3 in the Delta governorates of Sharkia and Dakahlia. We have confirmed there were demonstrations January 3 in El-Arish approximately 20 miles south of the Gaza border, following the January 2 El-Arish demonstrations when police prevented protestors from moving to the Gaza border. A prominent blogger told us that the AMAY journalist whom police beat unconscious at a downtown Cairo demonstration on Friday, January 2, has left the hospital and returned to work. According to this blogger, the journalist told the police that he was covering the demonstration for \"AMAY,\" but the police continued to beat him anyway. The blogger said that the police prevented opposition journalists from covering downtown Cairo demonstrations December 31, and subsequently transported the journalists to a desert area bordering Cairo and left them there.\n\n6. (SBU) Contacts told local staff that police had violently suppressed a January 4 demonstration in the port city of Damietta, and have arrested several demonstrators. Contacts have estimated 1,500 demonstrators in Damietta January 4. The MB called for a demonstration the afternoon of January 4 outside the Engineers' Syndicate in downtown Cairo. We noticed a moderately heavy security presence in the vicinity around mid-day, and we will continue to monitor developments related to this demonstration.\n\n------------------------- Inside the Demonstrations ------------------------- 7. (C)\n\nA prominent blogger told us January 4 that the MB has tried to avoid chanting anti-Mubarak slogans during demonstrations as it realizes that the police will move in to stop demonstrations when such chanting begins. The blogger said that when leftist opposition members begin chanting such slogans during demonstrations, MB members try to drown them CAIRO 00000007 002 OF 002 out with shouts of \"God is great (Allahu Akbar).\"\n\n8. (C) A leading member of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) told us that MB members tried to stop an EOHR press conference at the Journalists' Syndicate during the week of December 28 by shouting insults accusing the organization of being an agent of the U.S. and the West, before the press conference eventually proceeded. This EOHR contact told us that his organization is asking the GOE to disclose the number of demonstrators it is currently holding in detention. He said the EOHR believes that the GOE has released most demonstrators from custody after a few hours of detention.

The Egyptian military reports that the Egyptian-Gaza border remains stable, with no breaches since December 28. Egyptian border guards successfully prevented subsequent attempts to breach the border by a small number of unorganized individuals. Egyptian forces continue to receive occasional gunfire from the Gaza side of the border.\n\n2. (S) The Egyptian military estimates that Israeli air attacks have destroyed 50 percent of the main smuggling tunnels between Rafah and Gaza. They anticipate that the Israeli Defense Force will take additional measures to destroy the tunnels during the ground invasion. The Egyptian military stressed that the Rafah border would not be permanently opened until the Palestinian Authority regained control of the border crossings. They expressed concern that the Israelis were attempting to sever Gaza from the West Bank, leaving an independent Gaza as \"Egypt,s problem.8\n\n3.

Assistance is being delivered through Rafah, Kerem Shalom, and most recently al-Aouja (Egyptian-Israeli border crossing in Central Sinai) due to the high volumes of goods. All material is being thoroughly searched for weapons and ammunition.\n\n-------------- Demonstrations -------------- 4.\n\n(SBU) Contacts told us that the police prevented the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) from holding a large demonstration planned for Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo on the afternoon of January 5; however, our contacts said the demonstration will be held elsewhere in the city either today or tomorrow. The police allowed the MB to lead a smaller demonstration at the Press Syndicate, not far from Tahrir Square, where approximately 400 people demonstrated as of 1430 hrs. local. Emboff observed a demonstration of about 200 people in front of the Mogamma (an enormous government building about half a kilometer from the embassy). The protestors were waving a Palestinian flag and chanting, \"We are with you, Hamas!\" There were at least 1500 police in full riot gear scattered throughout the public square in front of the Mogamma.\n\n5. (SBU) Contacts told us January 5 that about 17,000 demonstrated in a peaceful protest January in the Delta town of Tanta. Contacts remarked that police allowed the demonstrators to protest, and did not attack the crowd.

Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 1. (S)\n\nSummary: IDF ground operations continued January 5 with heavy artillery fire and troop advances on Gaza City. After bisecting the Gaza Strip, IDF ground forces are methodically closing in on Gaza City. IDF leadership describes a \"root canal\" ground operation aimed at preventing rocket fire, seeking and destroying ammunition storage sites and Hamas combatants, and apprehending terrorists for further interrogation. IDF forces continue to hold ground in northern Gaza used earlier as rocket launching grounds. The number of rocket attacks has decreased, although 28 rockets were fired at Israel as of 1600 local. \"Tens of thousands\" of reservists were called up January 4 and 5, according to press reports, which indicated that some are intended to reinforce the northern border while others are being held in reserve for any expansion of operations in Gaza. PM Olmert made a number of phone calls to international leaders in the effort to convince the international community that Israel is making efforts to assist the population of Gaza as much as possible. Israeli press widely covers French President Sarkozy's anticipated arrival in Israel during the evening of January 5. The GOI continues to restrict media access to Gaza; while the MFA said it would allow a few foreign journalists to enter Gaza January 5, no foreign journalists in fact entered Gaza. On January 4, the GOI announced the establishment of a humanitarian coordination cell within the MOD. IDF sources confirmed that 49 out of 80 planned trucks of humanitarian supplies crossed into Gaza on January 5. IDF sources reported that approximately 200,000 liters of diesel fuel were transferred through the Nahal Oz fuel depot, but the Gaza power station contractor refused to pick up the delivery. Local embassies were planning to evacuate an additional 198 foreign nationals on January 5; no U.S. citizens were evacuated. However, the Canadian Embassy informed us that 18 Canadians and 16 other third country nationals were unable to leave Gaza via bus due to IDF-implemented road obstacles north of Gaza City. Continued call ups of local guards for reserve duty could affect Embassy Tel Aviv's security operations. End summary.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2. (S)\n\nAs of 1230 local, DAO members on the border with Gaza reported heavy artillery fire throughout the Northern Gaza Strip (from southern Gaza City to the northern border), which has been on-going throughout the morning. Apache and Cobra helicopter gunships provided tactical support for on-going troop advances toward and around Gaza City. DAO observers reported at 1400 local that there were no signs of ground operations along the border south of Karni. According to DAO, military police continued to deny foreign journalists access to the exclusive military zone surrounding Gaza, but did allow DAO personnel and other diplomats past checkpoints to areas near the Sufa crossing.\n\n3. (SBU) According to Israeli media outlets, the security establishment has set three main goals for the described \"root canal\" ground operation to destroy terror infrastructure in Gaza: 1) prevent further rocket launches; 2) seek and destroy ammunition storage sites and Hamas operatives; and 3) apprehend if possible those involved in terrorism for further interrogation. After bisecting the Gaza Strip, IDF troops have surrounded Gaza City, and are now cautiously and methodically closing in. IDF ground forces lay to the north, south, and east of the city, with Israeli naval vessels deployed off-shore to the west. IDF ground forces deployed from the Karni crossing to the Mediterranean have cut off Gaza City from potential Hamas reinforcements and supplies from the south.\n\n4. (SBU) IDF forces continue to hold ground in the northern towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya; ministers were briefed during the January 4 cabinet meeting that 73 percent of all rockets fired at Israel during the last week were launched from these areas seized by IDF forces. The number of rocket attacks has decreased as a result, although approximately 28 rockets as of 1600 local have thus far been fired at Israel on January 5, including at least 4 long-range grads. No Israeli casualties were reported as a result of these strikes as of 1600 local. The Israel Air Force (IAF) struck over 30 targets during the evening of January 4, including tunnels, TEL AVIV 00000015 002 OF 004 homes of Hamas operatives, and ammunition and rocket stores. Following the death of an IDF soldier on January 4, there have now been five Israeli fatalities -- two soldiers and three civilians -- since Operation Cast Lead began. According to Reuters and AFP, over 530 Palestinians have been killed since the operation began. Approximately 50 IDF soldiers have been wounded as a result of the ground combat operation.\n\n5. (SBU) Israeli press outlets speculate that Hamas is attempting to draw IDF forces into dense urban areas in order to maximize IDF casualties or attempt soldier kidnappings. Several press outlets report comments from \"security sources\" cliaming that the IDF has internalized the lessons learned from the 2006 war in Lebanon: for example, by maneuvering constantly around the combat zone in order to prevent creating stationary targets for Hamas -- as well as opportunities to kidnap IDF soldiers.\n\n6. (SBU) The press reported an attempted kidnapping by Hamas of an IDF soldier on January 4. According to the press, the IDF soldier from the Golani infantry brigade had been cut off from his unit, and engaged in a firefight with Hamas operatives who attempted to pull him into a tunnel. The soldier was apparently able to escape following the arrival of helicopter air support. In response to the intense media coverage -- both local and international -- of the alleged kidnapping of two IDF soldiers, the IDF spokesperson stated the IDF will not respond to false Hamas-generated rumors, and would report in the future any factual kidnappings to the public in an appropriate manner.\n\nNorthern Border --------------- 7. (S/NF)\n\nDAO reports Israel Defense Intelligence (IDI) concerns regarding possible action by Hizballah, Iran, or Global Jihad organizations, particularly with the one-year anniversary of Imad Mughniyah's death on February 12. On-going IDI and Israel Naval Intelligence analysis strongly indicates a possible maritime attack scenario within the region or abroad. The current IDI assessment is that Hizballah may act now, as Hizballah may see Israel as less likely to be drawn into additional fighting over a one-time Hizballah terrorist response due to on-going IDF operations in Gaza.\n\n8. (SBU) The Israeli press covered January 4 comments made by Director of Military Intelligence Major General Amos Yadlin suggesting Hizballah may open a second front against Israel in the north. The IDF called up \"tens of thousands\" of reservists on January 4, which could be used against potential attacks in the north and the West Bank. Israeli media outlet YNET picked up Syrian newspaper al-Watan's coverage of significantly increased Lebanese and UNFIL patrols in southern Lebanon.\n\nPolitical and Diplomatic Developments ------------------------------------- 9. (SBU)\n\nThe regular Sunday cabinet meeting was moved to Tel Aviv on January 4 as is customary in times of major military operations. The cabinet discussed the continued fighting in the south and in addition to hearing a statement from PM Olmert (ref B), was briefed by Defense Minister Barak, Foreign Minister Livni, IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi, as well as by senior intelligence chiefs. Livni briefed ministers on the various diplomatic issues related to the operation in the south. Education Minister Tamir discussed school cancellations in the south during the emergency. Shin Bet Director Diskin suggested Hamas was \"at a breaking point,\" and was searching for a formula which would provide an exit point without causing the organization further humiliation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499551", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Contacts expressed mounting anger at what they termed the \"randomness\" of Israeli attacks. CNN's bureau chief described a woman at Shifa Hospital who said her baby died after four days without food or water. End Summary.\n\nSTRESS MOUNTS WITH INTENSE BARRAGES ON JANUARY 5 AND 6 =========================== 2. (C)\n\nAmideast Gaza Director Anees Abu Hashem, clearly exhausted after a sleepless night, told PDoff that he could not believe he survived the night. He said the IDF commenced a barrage on Gaza City at 17:00 local time January 5. Airstrikes began at nightfall. He said that, each time the bombs struck, he closed his eyes and crouched down: \"Every time I opened my eyes again, I couldn't believe I was still alive.\" He characterized the bombing as \"totally random,\" saying there were no militants visible in his area of the city. Abu Hashem expressed anger at the mounting civilian death toll: \"The IDF is not organized. I am a witness here. They have lost their minds. They are killing civilians.\" He did not know what he would do if the IDF were to invade his neighborhood, and remarked, \"I am afraid tonight will be even worse.\"\n\n3. (C) Former Fulbright Senior Scholar and Al-Azhar University professor Dr. Jamil Salem told PDoff that his town of Saftawi, located between Gaza City and Jabalya, had been increasingly hit by what he termed \"indiscriminate\" Israeli fire. Just prior to the phone conversation, Dr. Salem said that two Israeli tank shells struck his next-door neighbors' home, destroying a whole portion of the house. Fortunately, no one was in the destroyed part of the house, so there were no injuries. Sounding angry and agitated, Salem said that no emergency personnel had been able to get through to the worst-hit areas in the past two days, and many dead and wounded were still trapped beneath mounds of rubble.\n\n4. (C) While speaking with EconOff about rumors of an IDF-imposed 18:00 curfew on Gaza City, USAID project employee Salem Al-Raiz abruptly cut off the phone call after the sound of a huge explosion on his end of the line, followed by loud screams. \"I don't know where it came from. A shell,\" Raiz said. He cut the call short, saying he had to go and help.\n\nMILITANTS MOVE INTO NEW NEIGHBORHOODS ===================================== 5. (C)\n\nAl-Azhar University professor Dr. Nehaya El-Telbani reported to PDoff that a Qassam rocket crew tried to fire from an olive grove near her neighborhood in the central Gaza town of Zawayda, but that \"Israeli F-16s\" had responded almost immediately. She was surprised the militants had tried to launch Qassams from her area, as she does not live close to the Israeli border. She suspected they had been pushed back by Israeli forces. Telbani said that her six children are screaming day and night, and her eight-year-old has started wetting his bed again. She added that they are completely cut off from north Gaza, with the IDF surrounding Khan Younis.\n\n6. (C) El-Telbani told PDoff that she had received a pre-recorded call on January 5 saying in Arabic: \"This is the Israeli Defense Forces. We do care about you civilians. If you have terrorists living near you, please call this number. Do not let yourself become a cover for terrorists. If you know they are there, then get out.\" Other ConGen contacts reported receiving similar calls.\n\nRUNNING LOW ON ESSENTIALS ========================= 7. (C)\n\nGaza American Corner director Dr. Awni Karazon, who has moved three times since his home was partially destroyed several days ago, told PDoff that he risked his life to return to his bombed-out house to gather some powdered milk, canned foods, and clothes for his kids. He said his old neighborhood was a \"ghost town\". He managed to procure two gallons of water, a mix of 25 percent mineral and 75 percent tap water, being distributed by employees at a local mineral water plant. When asked if he might consider moving into an JERUSALEM 00000049 002 OF 002 UNRWA shelter for the displaced, Karzon said he would consider this only as a last resort, noting that the IDF had struck UNRWA shelters in the last 24 hours.\n\n8. (C) Deposed independent Gaza City Mayor Majid Abu Ramadan told Poloff that he used his remaining gasoline last night to power a generator for three to four hours, allowing five neighboring families to obtain running water.\n\n9. (C) Other contacts said they are also facing increasing shortages of food, water, fuel, and electricity. CNN's Jerusalem bureau chief Kevin Flower told PD chief that his cameraman had encountered a woman at Shifa Hospital who said her six-month-old baby died after four days without food or water. Amideast Director Abu Hashem told PDOff that he has not had electricity or running water for five days, and his pregnant wife and children are all surviving on potatoes, rice, and olives. He mentioned that thousands of displaced persons are staying at UNRWA schools, but, as they do not have sufficient blankets, some local families are contributing extra blankets and bedding to UNRWA. Dr. Telbani said that she has been making bread at home, but is down to her last bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables are an expensive luxury, she added. Just today, her husband took a risky trip to Maghazi camp to buy food for the family. He returned with only a single orange.

Air strikes against strategic and tactical targets continued throughout the day, as did rocket and mortar fire from the Gaza Strip. One Israeli civilian was killed when a rocket landed in Ashkelon on the morning of December 29. According to IDF contacts, 63 truckloads of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza via Kerem Shalom during the day on December 29, with further deliveries scheduled for December 30.

Separately, Bank Hapoalim and Bank Discount announced that they will cease providing correspondent banking services to Gaza at midnight on December 31. End summary.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2.\n\n(SBU) The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is continuing its strategic campaign against Hamas leadership, personnel and infrastructure throughout Gaza. In addition to targets associated with the manufacture, storage and deployment of Kassam rockets, the IAF has also attacked the Hamas Interior Ministry, Islamic University (which contains labs that the GOI says are active in weapons and explosives research for Hamas), and a Hamas guest house used for official visitors. The IDF Spokesperson announced that the office of Hamas PM Ismail Haniyeh was attacked overnight (note: speaking on Israeli radio December 29, Deputy Defense Minister Vilnai denied that Haniyeh was personally targeted in the airstrike), as were \"dozens of other Hamas-related targets.\" Israeli Naval forces also attacked Hamas vessels and coastal structures overnight, according to the Spokesperson,s office. In his radio interview, Deputy Defense Minister Vilnai also said the IDF has high morale, and in contrast to the Second Lebanon War, all levels of the military know their task and what is expected of them. Vilnai said the operations will last a long time, \"perhaps much longer than people expect.\" Asked to comment on a possible ground campaign, he declined to answer, saying he did not intend to broadcast to Hamas Israel's military intentions.\n\n3. (S/NF) At 16:00 on December 28, the IDF bombed the Phiadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, destroying 39-40 smuggling tunnels. No Egyptian border guards were harmed. IDF contacts have repeatedly told DATT that the targeting of the tunnels was coordinated with Egypt, and that they had passed the coordinates of the attack points to the Egyptians to enable them to ensure the safety of their border forces.\n\n4. (SBU) As of 15:00 local December 29, 50 rockets have been fired into Israel today from Gaza, according to press reports. One Israeli was killed and 14-16 wounded when a Grad-type rocket struck a construction site in Ashkelon during the morning. Two Israelis have been killed since the start of operation \"Cast Lead\" on December 27. On December 28, two 122 mm Katyusha rockets struck areas in or near the city of Ashdod, in what appears to be the first attack by rockets with a range in excess of 30 km.\n\n5. (S/NF) The IDF is continuing its deployment of ground forces around the Gaza periphery, although no ground operations had been initiated as of 18:00. This morning the IDF closed most areas bordering the Gaza Strip to allow for the positioning of armor and infantry units. On December 28, DAO officers observed the movement of M-109 artillery and support/ammunition vehicles into the vicinity of Gaza. Heavy trucks laden with concrete shelters, water storage tanks and other logistical equipment intended to support ground operations were also observed deploying around the Gaza border. DAO also observed the movement of Merkava 3 tanks from the 188 Armor Brigade, which is normally deployed on the Lebanese border, into the vicinity of Gaza.\n\n6. (S/NF) During a subsequent observation mission this morning, DAO officers observed a further significant increase in the IDF ground forces presence around Gaza. Elements of three armor brigades, including artillery batteries and Merkava 3 and 4 tanks, and two infantry brigades were deployed opposite Gaza City and Beit Hanoun.\n\nTEL AVIV 00002906 002 OF 003 Political Developments ----------------------- 7.\n\n(U) During a special Knesset session to discuss the military operations this morning, DefMin Barak called the operation an \"all-out war against Hamas\" and said it would be \"widened and deepened as is necessary.\" He said the security services had spent \"months\" preparing for the operation, and would carry it out until Hamas is not longer capable of launching rockets at Israeli towns. While somewhat less hawkish, FM Livni,s remarks to the Knesset made clear that Israel expects the international community to blame Hamas, not Israel, for the current hostilities and the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\n\n8. (C) During a briefing in Sderot for the diplomatic corps on December 28, Livni and MoD Pol-Mil Director Amos Gilad stressed that Israel needs the support of the international community for an extended military operation designed not to overthrow the Hamas regime in Gaza, but to change the strategic environment by force. Israel will not tolerate continued rocket attacks on its citizens and the operation will continue for weeks. Livni said if the international community forces Israel to stop too soon, Israel will have to do it all over in the near future. She expressed understanding of President Abbas, dilemma and pressure on him to condemn Israeli actions, but she noted that even he had blamed Hamas while in Cairo, and she asked why the rest of the international community was finding it hard to do the same. \"This is the minimum we expect of you,\" she told the assembled diplomats. Livni also said the Gaza operation was in the longer run interests of peace with the Palestinians since Israel could not sign a peace agreement with a Palestinian Authority that did not have control over Gaza.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499722", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Cunningham, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 1. (S)\n\nSummary. Since Hamas announced the end of the \"tahdiya\" truce agreement December 19, pressure has been building in Israel for the IDF to respond more aggressively to daily barrages of rockets and mortars from Gaza. The Israeli cabinet meeting December 21 was largely devoted to a lively debate about the appropriate military response in Gaza. While Defense Minister Barak, supported by PM Olmert, has so far managed to resist the pressure for an immediate, large-scale operation, the IDF has prepared a range of contingencies, and we assume these options are now under active consideration. The contingencies range from resumption of targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders to a full-scale invasion and reoccupation of Gaza. In the current environment, even such limited operations as air strikes on Hamas or PIJ rocket launching teams could set off such an intensive barrage of rockets that the IDF could be drawn into a ground operation to stop the shelling. Foreign Minister Livni, who is one of the primary advocates of an immediate, large-scale military response to the rocket fire, has instructed the MFA to prepare a diplomatic campaign to explain and justify likely Israeli military action.\n\n2. (S) We recommend that the Department also begin to prepare press guidance, talking points and Security Council reaction in the event that Israel acts in the near future. Our suggestions as to the content appear in para 6 below. We further recommend contingency planning for humanitarian relief that will likely be needed in the aftermath of an Israeli military operation. End Summary.\n\nPressure Building in Israel --------------------------- 3.\n\n(C) Pressure inside Israel is building for a much tougher response to rocket and missile attacks from Gaza. While it appears that the GOI has yet to take a specific decision, the Hamas announcement of the end of the \"tahdiya\" truce and the daily rocket and mortar firing -- over thirty rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza at Israeli communities over the weekend -- is adding to the pressure for an Israeli military response. At the December 21 cabinet session, PM Olmert and Defense Minister Barak had to fend off demands from much of the rest of the government, but especially Foreign Minister Livni, Transportation Minister Mofaz and Deputy PM Ramon, for an immediate, strong military response to the rocket fire. Livni and Ramon have called for overthrowing Hamas rule in Gaza, which would probably entail occupying the entire Strip. Opposition Likud Party leader Bibi Netanyahu visited Sderot yesterday and blasted the government's failure to take stronger military action in response to the shelling. Based on public statements by Barak and IDF Chief of General Staff Ashkenazi, it is clear that Barak and the military want to take action at a time of their choosing and not forewarn Hamas exactly what they have in mind. Nonetheless, the pressure on the GOI to \"do something\" is growing. Political posturing is part of the mix, as all of the players except Olmert -- who has resigned and will not seek reelection -- are focused on building public support in advance of the February 10 general elections.\n\nIDF's Range of Military Options ------------------------------- 4.\n\n(S) The IDF has prepared a range of operational plans over the past year. These range from renewed targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders to limited brigade or several brigade-size ground incursions (such as the IDF conducted last March) up to a full scale combined air-land-sea invasion of Gaza. An interim operation often discussed before the tahdiya was signed in June was the IDF's seizure of the southern and northern ends of the Gaza Strip in order to stop the smuggling and make rocket launching more difficult. The precise mix of options is a political decision which the GOI probably has not yet taken and Barak is stressing the importance of limiting public discussion in order to preserve operational surprise. There is also the possibility, much discussed in the media here, that given the build-up in Hamas' rocket stockpiles and the extension of their range, even such limited Israeli military operations as air strikes on rocket squads could lead Hamas and the other organizations to launch massive barrages of rockets, which could in turn force the IDF to go in on the ground to stop it. In this environment, there is no guarantee that what starts out as a limited operation will remain that way.\n\n5. (C) Livni has instructed the MFA's senior staff to prepare a diplomatic strategy to explain a large-scale Israeli military operation in Gaza. While international criticism of Israeli action is predictable, we anticipate that the tenor of the Arab and international response will be TEL AVIV 00002864 002 OF 002 determined by a number of unknown factors, including the scale and duration of the operation and the extent of the damage to the civilian populations on both sides. There is also the question of an Israeli exit strategy: if the GOI decides to reoccupy large parts of Gaza, as soon as the smoke clears the Israelis probably will be looking for a third party to whom they can transfer responsibility.\n\nAction Recommendation: Consider U.S. Response Now --------------------------------------------- ----- 6.\n\n(C) We strongly recommend that the Department consider now the U.S. response to the above-mentioned range of Israeli military operations, including press guidance, talking points and even Security Council action, bearing in mind that we are likely to have little to no advance warning and that even a relatively restrained operation could rapidly grow into something much bigger. Our recommendation is that the USG start with putting the blame on Hamas for the illegitimacy of its rule in Gaza, its policy of firing or allowing other factions to fire rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian targets, and its decision to end the \"tahdiya\" calming period; and support for Israel's right to defend itself, while also emphasizing our concern for the welfare of innocent Palestinian civilians and U.S. readiness to provide emergency humanitarian relief. On this last point, USAID points out that large-scale U.S. and international humanitarian assistance will be urgently needed in Gaza if the IDF ends up carrying out a broad-scale military operation.\n\n********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM\n\n23.12 from Jerusalem\n\nAl Quds quotes a recent World Bank report that concludes trade in the West Bank cannot improve under the current Israeli restrictions and checkpoint regime.

Elements of three armor brigades, including artillery batteries and Merkava 3 and 4 tanks, and two infantry brigades were deployed opposite Gaza City and Beit Hanoun.\n\nTEL AVIV 00002906 002 OF 003 Political Developments ----------------------- 7.\n\n(U) During a special Knesset session to discuss the military operations this morning, DefMin Barak called the operation an \"all-out war against Hamas\" and said it would be \"widened and deepened as is necessary.\" He said the security services had spent \"months\" preparing for the operation, and would carry it out until Hamas is not longer capable of launching rockets at Israeli towns. While somewhat less hawkish, FM Livni,s remarks to the Knesset made clear that Israel expects the international community to blame Hamas, not Israel, for the current hostilities and the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\n\n8. (C) During a briefing in Sderot for the diplomatic corps on December 28, Livni and MoD Pol-Mil Director Amos Gilad stressed that Israel needs the support of the international community for an extended military operation designed not to overthrow the Hamas regime in Gaza, but to change the strategic environment by force. Israel will not tolerate continued rocket attacks on its citizens and the operation will continue for weeks. Livni said if the international community forces Israel to stop too soon, Israel will have to do it all over in the near future. She expressed understanding of President Abbas, dilemma and pressure on him to condemn Israeli actions, but she noted that even he had blamed Hamas while in Cairo, and she asked why the rest of the international community was finding it hard to do the same. \"This is the minimum we expect of you,\" she told the assembled diplomats. Livni also said the Gaza operation was in the longer run interests of peace with the Palestinians since Israel could not sign a peace agreement with a Palestinian Authority that did not have control over Gaza.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499812", "subreddit": "AmKon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

(S) PA security chiefs met with top IDF and COGAT officers late December 29 at Bet El (outside Ramallah) to discuss the West Bank security situation in light of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip. PA security chiefs told ConGenOffs that the PA urged the IDF to avoid Palestinian demonstrations and to refrain from using live ammunition, which killed three Palestinian demonstrators in recent days. According to PA commanders, the two sides agreed to expedite coordination and exchange information on disturbances and agreed both sides have an interest in avoiding violent clashes. Separately, PM Salam Fayyad confirmed to the Consul General that Israeli MoD officials have expressed their understanding of the need to avoid confrontations in the West Bank. End summary.\n\n2. (S) According to PA National Security Forces (NSF) commander MG Thiab Mustafa Ali (Abu al-Fatah), PA Joint Security Committees (JSC) commander BG Qays Makhzumi and other senior security contacts, PA commanders met with IDF West Bank Division Commander BG Noam Tibon, West Bank COGAT Director BG Yoav (Poly) Mordechai and IDF staff principals late December 29 at Bet El DCL (District Coordination Liaison) office outside Ramallah. In addition to MG Ali and Makhzumi, PA police chief MG Hazim Attallah, Preventive Security (PSO) director MG Ziad Hab al-Rih, acting General Intelligence (Mukhabarat) chief Muhammad Thib Mansur, and Military Intelligence (Istikhbarat) chief BG Majid al-Farraj attended the meeting. Security commanders told ConGenOffs that they discussed the overall security situation the West Bank in light of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip, and better methods of dealing with protests.\n\nPA Commanders Urge IDF to Avoid Use of Live Ammunition ---------------------------- 3.\n\n(C) PA commanders complained about IDF use of live ammunition, responsible for three Palestinian fatalities in December 27-28 protests. MG Ali said IDF commanders told them live ammunition is the last resort when dealing with Palestinian demonstrators, and IDF rules of engagement only authorize it when the lives of IDF soldiers or Israeli citizens are at immediate risk. PA security chiefs said IDF BG Tibon reported that the Nil'in village shooting (in which two Palestinian were killed by IDF fire) was quickly investigated by the IDF, and that an IDF officer has already been referred to a disciplinary board for improper use of live ammunition during the incident. According to MG Ali, both BGs Tibon and Mordechai said they re-issued instructions to all forces operating in the West Bank to abide strictly by rules of engagement and refrain from using live rounds against unarmed demonstrators.\n\n4. (C) MG Ali added that IDF commanders said that in the Silwad incidents the Palestinian was about to throw a firebomb, thus endangering soldiers' lives, and that according to IDF rules of engagement Palestinians with firebombs are a threat to life and can be engaged with live ammunition. He added that both IDF commanders agreed, however, that in most cases, even demonstrators with firebombs should not be engaged, and troops should find non-lethal means of controlling the situation.\n\nBoth Sides Agree to Increase Coordination ----------------------------------------- 5.\n\n(S) According to PA security chiefs, the second part of the meeting was dedicated to a review the West Bank security situation. PA commanders said they told IDF officers that President Abbas and PM Fayyad both directed them to avoid situations that could develop into confrontations with the IDF. The security chiefs said Abbas and Fayyad passed a message to all Palestinian factions, at a PLO Executive Committee meeting on December 29, that only peaceful marches away from flashpoints would be permitted. PA commanders noted they have no control on over B/C areas such as Qalandiya and Nil'in, and would need IDF approval to move PA forces to those areas to prevent clashes between protesters and the IDF. PA commanders said both sides agreed that Hebron is a problem, and cooperation on a case-by-case basis is critical. PA commanders said their IDF counterparts agreed to expedite coordination and movement requests and exchange information on possible disturbances, as both sides have an interest in preventing West Bank violence. They said both sides also agreed not to leak substantive discussions about the meeting to the press, given the sensitivity of JERUSALEM 00002314 002 OF 002 PA-GOI security coordination in a time of Palestinian outrage over events in Gaza.\n\nFayyad Confirms MoD Contacts ---------------------------- 6.\n\n(S) In a separate conversation with the Consul General, PM Fayyad said he had received messages from the Israeli MoD on December 29 indicating that the Israeli security leadership understands the need for the IDF to deploy in the West Bank in a way that will minimize confrontations with Palestinian civilians. Fayyad said he was encouraged by the messages, but would watch carefully to see how these instructions are implemented by IDF commanders on the ground.

No ground operations have been initiated; the senior GOI leadership is discussing a range of options. Air strikes during the early morning hours of December 30 destroyed a number of Hamas strategic and tactical targets, including a government complex in Gaza City. Rockets and mortars from Gaza continued to strike Israel, reaching as far north as Yavne and as far east as Rahat; one Israeli woman in Ashdod and an IDF soldier near Nahal Oz were killed in rocket strikes during the evening of December 29. According to the IDF, 93 truckloads of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing during the day on December 30. During a strategic assessment meeting on December 29, PM Olmert challenged GOI officials to avoid talk of a ceasefire, and directed IDF forces to continue their operations with an undefined duration. An Israeli Navy vessel rammed a boat from the Free Gaza movement carrying humanitarian assistance to Gaza from Cyprus, forcing it to turn back. The Free Gaza boat sustained damage but was able to travel north to the Lebanese port of Tyre. The Embassy disseminated a warden message to avoid the 30km area from Gaza due to on-going IDF operations and rocket attacks. End summary.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2.\n\n(SBU) Israeli air and naval forces attacked dozens of Hamas targets throughout the Gaza Strip overnight and during the morning hours of December 30. According to the IDF Spokesperson, targets included three buildings in the Hamas government complex -- including the Hamas ministries of interior and foreign affairs and PM's offices -- in the Tel Al-Hawa neighborhood, Hamas training camps and outposts, stations held by Hamas naval forces, a vehicle transporting a stockpile of Grad missiles, rocket launchers, a weaponry manufacturing facility, and sites used as headquarters by terror cells. Israeli media reported that two top Hamas weapons engineers were killed in the December 29 strike on research labs at the Islamic University.\n\n3. (S/NF) The IDF continues its deployment of ground forces around the Gaza periphery, although no ground operations had been initiated as of 1800 local. Poor weather conditions may have been a contributing factor, although late-breaking press reports also indicate that \"senior defense officials\" may recommend a 48-hour truce to evaluate Hamas' reaction prior to launching any ground offensive. Israel Defense Intelligence (IDI) sources told DAO officers that ground operations could begin at any time; a deciding factor would be weather conditions facilitating the ability to provide close air support and medical evacuation. During the evening of December 29, rain and lowered ceilings dominated weather conditions; overcast skies were prevalent over Gaza during much of the day on December 30. The tempo of air operations decreased greatly during the afternoon of December 30.\n\n4. (S) The IDF continues to reinforce and increase its logistical footprint around Gaza. DAO officers observed more robust logistical support for units in assembly areas at Erez Crossing and at the artillery position located south of Kibbutz Nir'am. Unit flags, tents, and port-a-johns have been erected at these locations. Overnight, reinforcements from units previously unobserved in the Gaza sector arrived, including elements of the Givati Brigade, the Golani Brigade's 12th Battalion, and the Kfir Brigade's Heruv Battalion. DAO reports that the preponderance of IDF units are located around the northern half of Gaza; the deployment of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with mounted mock turrets may represent decoy attempts to portray a larger presence in the south.\n\n5. (S) DATT reports that during a briefing to military attaches and UN military representatives on December 29, IDF Strategic Division Commander Brigadier General Yossi Heyman noted the 122mm rocket attacks on the port of Ashdod demonstrated that Hamas is capable of launching rockets of up to 35km -- putting more than 500,000 Israelis in the range of rockets emanating from Gaza. BG Heyman said the IDF was \"prepared for a long operation,\" and stressed that the IDF was doing its best to minimize civilian casualties. Reserve Brigadier General Baruch Spiegel informally mentioned to embassy officers December 30 that the IDF is ready to carry out a detailed plan for ground operations with multiple TEL AVIV 00002922 002 OF 003 stages and a range of levels of intensity, but is waiting for orders from the political level -- presumably the inner war cabinet of PM Olmert, Defense Minister Barak, Foreign Minister Livni, and Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi. Spiegel said he thought the decision whether to launch a ground operation would be made in the next 48 hours. He commented that the IDF is not in a hurry and can continue to build up ground forces without pressure to act. Spiegel and his colleague at the Economic Cooperation Foundation Boaz Karni told us that the GOI's goal of a \"sustainable ceasefire\" was being complicated by the fact that senior Hamas officials in Gaza have all gone underground and are not able to communicate with potential mediators.\n\n6. (SBU) As of 1715 local December 30, approximately 20 rockets have been fired throughout the day from Gaza, according to press reports. Most of these rockets landed in or near Sderot, injuring two Israelis and damaging several properties. One rocket struck as far east as the vicinity of Rahat; another Qassam rocket scored a direct hit on a kibbutz dining hall in the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council. According to the Israeli MFA, approximately 90 rockets were fired from Gaza at Israel on December 29. Three Israelis were killed by rocket and mortar fire on December 29, including a construction worker in Ashkelon (Grad-type rocket), a soldier in the Nahal Oz area (Qassam/mortar attack), and a woman in Ashdod (Grad-type rocket). Four Israelis have been killed since the start of operation \"Cast Lead\" on December 27. During the evening of December 29, several rockets hit in or near Okafim in the east and Yavne in the north, demonstrating increasing range. Israeli schools in a 30km radius from Gaza remained closed on December 30.\n\nPolitical Developments ---------------------- 7.\n\n(SBU) According to media reports, during a December 29 evening situation assessment meeting with FM Livni, Defense Minister Barak, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi, Shin Bet Director Diskin, and Mossad Director Dagan, PM Olmert reportedly instructed meeting attendees not to talk about a cease-fire with Hamas. He ordered the IDF to continue its actions with an undefined end to the operation. Olmert stressed that Israel will act against Hamas \"with an iron fist,\" but would treat the population in Gaza \"with silk gloves\" by ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid, food, and other needs.\n\n8. (SBU) Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Binyamin Ben-Eliezer (Labor Party) said to the press that Israel would not cease the operation in Gaza until Hamas stopped firing rockets at Israel. He said the operation will continue until a \"new reality\" is created in which communities on the Gaza periphery can \"lead their lives quietly.\" Minister for Industry, Trade and Labor Eli Yishai (Shas Party) commented that the Israeli elections scheduled for February 10 should not be postponed due to the situation in Gaza.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499886", "subreddit": "AmKon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

TEL AVIV 2922 B. TEL AVIV 2906\n\nClassified By: Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Marc Siever s, reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 1. (S)\n\nSUMMARY: While IDF troops remained on hold but still poised for a ground attack, rocket fire continues into Israel from Gaza, including increased attacks beyond 30km, and the first hit in the city of Be'er Sheva. Israeli airstrikes are ongoing, although at a slowed tempo, with attacks reported along the Philadelphi corridor, in northern Gaza, and on government buildings including the Hamas \"Prime Minister's Offices.\" Meanwhile, according to press reports, the \"security kitchen cabinet\" of PM Olmert, DM Barak and FM Livni decided to reject the French proposal for a 48-hour humanitarian cease-fire, calling it unrealistic because it was not permanent, placed limited demands on Hamas, and was unnecessary as no humanitarian crisis has developed in Gaza. According to COGAT, over 100 truckloads of humanitarian aid are scheduled to enter Gaza on December 31 through the Kerem Shalom crossing, while the Karni and Nahal Oz crossings remain closed due to ongoing mortar fire in the area. The Erez crossing remains open but restricted. With Karni and Nahal Oz closed, COGAT says it is working with UNRWA on logistically feasible options for bringing bulk grain and fuel through Kerem Shalom. Finally, the Bank of Israel has also given its approval for Bank Hapoalim and Discount Bank to end their correspondent relationship with Gaza banks as of January 1.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2. (S) DAO sources report that the IAF conducted 35 strikes overnight, withIsraeli Naval forces also striking targets withinGaza. This includes attacks against a reported Haas training camp in northern Gaza, a second strie along the Philadelphi corridor against smuggling tunnels, and the bombing of additional government buildings including the office building of Hamas \"Prime Minister\" Ismayil Haniyah. No casualties were reported in these actions, although there are reports of civilian casualties in other strikes, including one that targeted a house in the Jabalya refugee camp.\n\n3. (S) At 1430 local, DAO observers reported an increase in IDF ground forces (over levels observed December 30) along the Gaza border, including elements of at least four infantry and three armor brigades. Unlike during previous observation missions, IDF forces outside the northern Gaza Strip were observed wearing full combat gear and deployed in a combat-ready stance. Additional roads, including highway 4 north of the Erez crossing, were closed, and a large staging area -- with lights, generators, field tents, water tanks and other structures -- had been completed adjacent to the northeast corner of the Gaza Strip.\n\n4. (S//NF) Rocket fire into Israel continues as several more towns suffered their first hit, including at least 5 impacts in Be'er Sheva, the principal city in the Negev. Be'er Sheva is Israel's sixth largest city, after Ashdod (which is also under attack), with a population of 200,000. The first rocket strike into Be'er Sheva was a 122mm Grad that the IDF told the DAO they believe the Grad was made in China but are analyzing it further before confirming.\n\n5. (U) While no one was injured in the initial Be'er Sheva attack, it hit an empty kindergarten and the news photos of the burned dolls and destroyed children's toys elicited a strong response from authorities and the public. The IDF has expanded its orders to close the schools to additional \"third ring\" cities, including Be'er Sheva, and asked residents to stay in or near shelters and avoid public gatherings. At least five more rockets have hit Be'er Sheva on December 31, and attacks are reported on other towns including Ashkelon and Yavneh. Early estimates are over 40 Qassam, Katyusha and Grad rockets fired as of 1430 local on December 31.\n\nHumanitarian Assistance ----------------------- 6.\n\n(U) COGAT told Emboffs that Kerem Shalom and Erez remain open, while Nahal Oz and Karni are still closed due to continued attacks in the vicinity of the crossings. COGAT says as of mid-day over 80 trucks have passed through Kerem Shalom, with a target of over 100 trucks before the crossing closes at 1500. As of 1430, COGAT was not able to provide the number of people that have crossed through Erez, though at least four crossing permits have been issued.\n\n7. (SBU) COGAT officials also said that they have yet to receive a response from UNRWA on the feasibility of transferring the bulk grain at the Karni crossing into 1-ton plastic sacks and moving them through Kerem Shalom. COGAT says it is also still investigating ways that it can move cooking gas and diesel fuel through Kerem Shalom that meet public safety standards. COGAT officials also told EconCouns that two planeloads of aid are expected today and tomorrow from Greece, Norway and the WHO. However, the COGAT official warned that, due to capacity issues, it will take a week and a half to move these goods through Kerem Shalom.\n\nPolitical Developments ---------------------- 8. (C)\n\nPrime Minister Olmert, Minister of Defense Barak and Foreign Miniter Livni met last night and rejected the possibility of a 48-hour humanitarian ceasefire as suggested by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson called the proposal unrealistic because it was a unilateral Israeli ceasefire with no mechanism to ensure Hamas ceases rocket fire, smuggling, and other terrorist activity. Barak was reportedly in favor of the ceasefire to calm the international community, while Olmert and Livni took a harder line according to press reports. Nimrod Barkan, head of the MFA Political Research Department, told A/DCM on December 31 that Barak's primary interest in the 48-hour ceasefire was due to the poor weather expected over the next two days.\n\n9. (U) The full security cabinet met on December 31 to receive a security briefing and discuss a ground operation. Barak has already requested that another 2,500 reservists be activated. During the meeting, Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin reportedly said that the operations against Hamas infrastructure had been more effective than anticipated and that no humanitarian crisis exists in Gaza.\n\n10. (U) In the press, pundits are divided over whether Israel should accept a ceasefire or continue to a more-costly ground operation. Speculation is also growing over the political motivations of the Gaza operation. Opposition leader and PM candidate Benjamin Netanyahu has so far expressed complete support for the government, while the first polls released since the operation began show gains for both Labor and Kadima, with Kadima now even with Likud at 29 seats apiece.\n\n11. (SBU) Israeli Arabs: Protests against the Gaza operation continue in Israeli-Arab and mixed Jewish-Arab towns and cities. While most of these demonstrations have ended peacefully, others have resulted in clashes with police or Jewish counter-protesters. Minor clashes between Arab and Jewish students at Haifa University have occurred each day since December 29. The far-left and predominantly Arab Hadash Party is organizing what it hopes will be a very large demonstration in Tel Aviv on the evening of January 3. At the same time, small groups of Israeli-Arab youths continue to throw stones at cars and block roads throughout the north, with incidents reported in Uhm al-Fahm, Nazareth, Akko and dozens of smaller towns. Media reports on December 31 indicate that police have arrested over 300 Israeli Arabs, a large portion of them minors, for causing violent disturbances and disrupting traffic. POL and DAO officers have seen very large numbers of Israeli police and border police deployed in visible locations throughout the north since the start of military operations on December 27.\n\n********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499921", "subreddit": "AmKon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

(C) SUMMARY: Local and international media highlighted FM Livni,s January 1 comments in Paris that a ceasefire was unnecessary and would give Hamas time to regroup. Israeli troops deployed around Gaza have relaxed their posture, but remain prepared for ground incursions. Rocket and mortar strikes against southern Israeli towns have decreased, but Grad-type rockets continue to impact Be,er Sheva; no additional Israeli deaths were reported on January 1 or 2. Israeli Air Force (IAF) operations against Hamas targets continued on January 1 and 2, killing Nizar Rayan, reportedly one of the IDF's top targets and the first senior Hamas official killed in Operation Cast Lead, along with 15 members of his family, according to press reports. The IAF also destroyed a mosque reportedly serving as a weapons depot and communications hub. On the morning of January 2, Embassy Tel Aviv, Consulate-General Jerusalem and Embassy Amman facilitated the evacuation of 27 American citizens and their family members from Gaza. END SUMMARY.\n\nPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 2. (SBU) After meeting with French President Sarkozy in Paris on January 1, FM Livni reiterated the cabinet,s December 31 decision to reject a 48-hour ceasefire, saying there was no humanitarian crisis in Gaza and therefore no need for a humanitarian ceasefire. Sarkozy restated his intention to visit the region next week. On January 1, France ceded the rotating EU presidency to the Czech Republic, which announced plans to dispatch a delegation to Jerusalem, Ramallah, Amman, and Cairo on January 4 in support of the French ceasefire proposal. Turkish PM Erdogan,s diplomatic tour continued on January 1 with a stop in Cairo after meeting Syrian President Asad on December 31; he is expected to visit Riyadh on January 3. Turkish DCM Bozay provided a readout of President Gul's January 1 conversation with President Peres. Gul reportedly expressed understanding of Israel's need to take action against terrorist attacks, noting that Turkey was also a victim of terrorism, but cautioned Peres that the operation needed to be brought to a quick conclusion due to the impact on Muslim public opinion. Peres responded that he hoped Israeli military operations could be completed soon, but said Hamas was not showing any sign of readiness to accept a ceasefire on terms acceptable to Israel. Local reaction to the December 31 statement by Arab League FMs has been muted.\n\n3. (C) Neither the inner cabinet nor full security cabinet have convened since the December 31 meeting in which cabinet members agreed upon conditions for a ceasefire and ended press speculation of dissent by DM Barak; the next regular cabinet meeting will be on January 4. While reportedly pushing for a major but brief ground incursion, Ha,aretz reports that defense officials recommend parallel preparation of a diplomatic exit strategy that would include an agreement brokered with Hamas; FM Livni remarked in Paris that a ceasefire negotiated directly with Hamas was unacceptable as it would legitimize the group,s hold over Gaza.\n\n4. (U) Polling results in advance of Knesset elections still scheduled for February 10 continue to show gains for DM Barak,s Labor Party, with unclear results for FM Livni,s Kadima Party and former PM Netanyahu,s Likud Party. Media commentators agree that Barak has the most to gain from the Gaza operation, though much depends upon its outcome. A Ma,ariv-Teleseeker poll published January 2 shows the Labor Party earning 16 Knesset seats if elections were held today (up from 11 on December 25), while Likud and Kadima would each take 28 (down from 29 for Likud and 30 for Kadima). The same poll showed public support for the ongoing operations against Hamas at 93 percent, with 40 percent favoring continued air attacks only, 41 percent in favor of a ground incursion, and nine percent advocating an immediate ceasefire. 77 percent of the public believes Israel should only accept a ceasefire if it includes negotiations for the release of Gilad Shalit. (Note: The Ma,ariv-Teleseeker poll showed significantly stronger support for ongoing operations in Gaza than a January 1 Ha,aretz poll that included Israeli Arabs, though their influence on government decision making is minimal, leading us to believe they were excluded from the Ma,ariv poll.) The Likud Party has put up billboards all over Tel Aviv with the slogan \"strong together\" and in smaller print, \"Likud supports our soldiers and the residents of the south.\" In keeping with Bibi Netanyahu's pledge to suspend his electoral campaign during the fighting, the billboards do not refer to Netanyahu directly.\n\nMILITARY OPERATIONS 5. (S) The Israeli Defense Forces, (IDF) ground buildup appears to have slowed after the initial influx of armor and infantry to the Gaza perimeter. Elements of at least three armor and four infantry brigades remain deployed along the TEL AVIV 00000005 002 OF 002 northern Gaza strip. DAO reports no indications of an imminent ground incursion. IDF maintenance and logistical activity continued on January 2, but IDF troops displayed a more relaxed posture than on January 1. DAO assesses that the IDF has not yet deployed sufficient forces for a deep, sustained ground operation, but that more limited incursions into northern Gaza could occur with little or no warning.\n\n6. (SBU) Despite cleared skies over Gaza, the pace of Israeli Air Force (IAF) operations has decreased, with 48 sorties on January 1, according to the IDF. Media reports speculate that the IAF is running out of quality targets and may soon be forced to either scale back operations or turn the fighting over to ground forces. IAF operations on January 1 included a strike that killed senior Hamas official Nizar Rayan in his Jabaliya home, reportedly along with his four wives and 11 of his children. Rayan was reportedly on the IDF's list of top Hamas targets, and was the first senior Hamas political official killed in Operation Cast Lead. IAF jets also bombed a mosque in the Jabaliya area that, according to IDF sources, served as a command and control hub for Hamas militants and storage site for Grad-type and Qassam rockets. As of 12:00 on January 2, the IAF had carried out an additional 20 strikes, mostly targeting the homes of Hamas militants; IDF sources stress that residents received prior warnings to evacuate by leaflet, phone, or text message, although one prominent commentator quoted military sources as saying that at least in the Rayan attack, no one answered the phone when it rang 10 minutes prior to the attack.\n\n7. (SBU) IDF sources report that 35 rockets, including 10 Grad-type, and four mortar rounds were fired into Israel on January 1, with several rockets striking in or around Be,er Sheva, with no deaths or injuries. As of 15:00 on January 2 approximately 20 additional rockets had been launched from Gaza, impacting Ashkelon, Sdot Negev, and Eshkol; one woman was reported injured by shrapnel. Israeli towns and cities within 40km of Gaza remain under special alert, expanded from 30km after rockets began striking Be,er Sheva on December 31. Schools remain closed, and residents have been asked to stay in or near shelters.\n\nAMCIT EVACUATION 8. (SBU) On the morning of January 2 Embassy Tel Aviv, Consulate-General Jerusalem, and Embassy Amman coordinated the evacuation of 27 American citizens (Amcits) and non-Amcit family members from Gaza via the Erez crossing; an additional seven Amcits on the initial evacuation list chose to remain in Gaza. As of 14:00 the 27 evacuees were proceeding through the Allenby border crossing from Israel into Jordan after transiting Israel under embassy escort. A total of 234 third country nationals were evacuated through Erez during the day.\n\nHUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 9. (SBU) The Office for Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) announced that 60 trucks carrying 1,360 tons of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza from Israel via the Kerem Shalom crossing on January 1, including 10 UN Relief and Works Agency trucks with cooking oil and seven with flour, three trucks with medical supplies from Egypt, seven trucks with food from Jordan, and two International Committee of the Red Cross trucks carrying medical supplies. 64 trucks entered Gaza on January 2, according to COGAT (of 72 that were initially expected). According to USAID, the Kerem Shalom crossing remained open as of 15:00 on January 2, while the Rafah crossing into Egypt opened only briefly for the evacuation of 17 wounded Palestinians and entry of six Egyptian trucks carrying medical supplies. The Karni grain conveyor and Nahal Oz fuel pipeline remained closed on January 1 and 2.\n\n10. (SBU) Turkish DCM Bozay told us today that Turkey had completed the coordination with COGAT of substantial Turkish humanitarian assistance, including five ambulances, 330 tons of flour, 11,000 dried food parcels (11 tons), and 13 tons of medical supplies, all of which has now entered Gaza. Bozay said he received full cooperation from Israeli officials, including clearance of the ambulances through the Ashdod port within two days. Based on the success of these shipments, the Turks reportedly are planning additional humanitarian relief, including a number of small generators for Gaza's hospital.\n\n********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy Tel Aviv's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295499938", "subreddit": "AmKon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

(C)\n\nSummary. A wide selection of Gaza Strip political, business, civil society, academic and NGO contacts report fear of airstrikes, deteriorating conditions, minimal or no electricity, increasing food pressures, and a gloomy outlook for resolution of current hostilities. Several who are strongly opposed to Hamas said they have little hope that Hamas will lose control or change its behavior due to Israel's military operations. End summary.\n\nGaza PLO ExComm Member: Situation Deteriorating; Hamas Unwilling to Return to Ceasefire; -------------------------------------- 2. (C)\n\nGaza City-based PLO Executive Committee member Riyad al-Khudari (independent, please protect) told PolOff January 2 that he doubts Hamas will accept a mutual cessation of hostilities, as Hamas' objective is permanently reopening the crossings, not halting Israeli attacks or protecting Gaza's population. He said ending the fighting will be difficult, as Hamas has made Gaza into an armed camp and does not fear an Israeli invasion. They are too stubborn, he believes, to agree to a ceasefire that does not include guarantees on the crossings. Al-Khudari said most airstrikes have killed civil police, not Izz al-Din al-Qassam fighters, and, except for Nizar Rayyan, few Hamas leaders have been hit. He said his neighborhood (an upscale part of Shaykh Radwan) has been without electricity for three days, and their house has no heat, with only cooking gas left. Al-Khudari, who is also a university trustee, said all schools and universities in Gaza are closed and will not open anytime soon.\n\nGaza PLC Member: Outraged at Israeli Targeting of Non-Hamas Institutions ------------------------------------ 3. (C)\n\nGaza-based Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) member Rawiya al-Shawwa told PolOff that she and most Gazans are outraged by Israeli targeting of the PLC building, where she and several Fatah PLC members kept offices. She said the building had only recently been completed and complained it was a PA facility, not used by Hamas as a faction, and its destruction is an affront to the PA and delegitimizes the PLC as an institution. She worries that her home in Shuja'iya will be destroyed in fighting, as houses nearby have been bombed by the IAF and it lies on a main avenue of approach to Gaza City from the border with Israel.\n\nKey UN OCHA Contact's House Destroyed, Airstrikes Jarring Children --------------------------- 4. (C)\n\nHamada al-Bayari, a key Economic/crossings contact, told EconOff January 2 that his house was largely destroyed when IAF ordnance struck a house nearby. He said the bomb targeted a single house but destroyed or heavily damaged all the houses on his street. He said airstrikes are having a severe psychological impact on his children, who have become distant and distrustful. He said he was fortunate to have relocated his family to an in-laws' house the night before his house was wrecked.\n\nAmerican Corner Director: Situation Terrible for the Children; Food Shortages Acute -------------------------------------- 5. (C)\n\nGaza City-based Dr. Awni Karzon, Director of Gaza's American Corner, told PDoff January 2 that his house was heavily damaged in IAF strikes on Justice Ministry buildings, and he had to relocate his family to a friend's house. He said his family could not take anything from the remains of his house, and they are sharing food provided by his hosts. The adults are eating little themselves so the children can eat. Most food stores in his area are closed, he said, and few Gazans will venture outside because of airstrikes.\n\nGovernor's Office Contact: No Electricity for Days, No Confidence Hamas Will Weaken ----------------------------------------- 6. (C)\n\nThe Gaza Governor's office manager, a 35-year-old mother who lives in Rimal (northwest Gaza City) near the ocean, said she has had no electricity for three days, and only had a few hours of electricity daily since Israeli airstrikes began on December 27. She said her home has no heat, and her family must simply bundle up throughout the day for warmth. She said she hates Hamas and sympathizes with Israel's need to stop rockets, but commented that she sees little connection between Israel's bombing targets and Hamas, JERUSALEM 00000017 002 OF 002 and doubts current military operations will weaken Hamas' grip on power.\n\nDemocracy Program Manager: Israel Targeting Our Civil Infrastructure More than Hamas ------------------------------------ 7. (C)\n\nManal al-Bashti, program manager of a USAID-funded civil society/democracy project, told USAID staff that Israeli airstrikes have frequently targeted government institutions, such as the PA Education Ministry building and PLC headquarters, that have no connection to Hamas' military forces or rockets. She commented that Israel's military campaign seemed more directed at destroying Palestinian civil infrastructure than degrading Hamas' capabilities to attack Israel. She said moderates and civilians are suffering the most from the fighting.\n\nAMIDEAST Director: Bombing, Food Shortages Threaten Civilians ---------------------------- 8. (C)\n\nGaza AMIDEAST Director Anis Abu Hashim told PDoff January 2 that his multi-story apartment building shook so much from nearby bombings that he worried his home had become structurally unsound. He said his family has had no electricity or water for four days, and must transport jugs of water from street level. He said he does not go outside except when forced to look for food, but on a recent search did not find any stores open except for a donkey cart selling vegetables. He wanted to buy bread, but said the line outside the bakery was at least four hours long, and did not want to risk being exposed during airstrikes.

(S)\n\nAs of 1500 hrs. local on January 4, Egyptian military contacts said Egypt closed the Rafah border crossing on January 4 after the Israelis gave advanced warning of their ground invasion and additional air strikes on the smuggling tunnels along the Gaza-Rafah border. According to the Egyptian military, the air strikes against the tunnels \"appear to be effective8 and the Egyptian Border Guards have seen \"no tunnel smuggling activity8 since Israel began bombing Gaza. The Ministry Of Defense will brief military attaches and diplomats on January 5 on their views of the Gaza situation.\n\n2. (SBU) The Egypt-Gaza border remains stable, with a reported 7000 central security forces (civilian, not military) providing additional security throughout Rafah, al-Arish, and the major roads across northern Sinai.\n\n3. (SBU) On January 3, an Egyptian border guard was shot and wounded by Palestinian gunfire. Until January 4, the Egyptians continued to open the Rafah crossing for the transfer of medical supplies into Gaza and to receive injured Palestinians. The transfer of humanitarian assistance had been slow, as all shipments were transferred by hand between Egyptian and Palestinian trucks. However, even this traffic across the Rafah border has now ceased.\n\n4. (U) According to press reports, 102 Palestinians have been treated in Egyptian hospitals since hostilities began and 294 Palestinians have been allowed back into Gaza. Wounded Palestinians are being initially taken to two hospitals in al-Arish ) al-Arish General and Mubarak Armed Forces ) and then transferred as needed to Ministry of Health or military hospitals in Cairo and Ismailia.\n\n------------------------------ Demonstrations January 3 and 4 ------------------------------ 5. (C)\n\nAccording to independent daily \"Al-Masry Al-Youm (AMAY),\" on January 3, the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organized a mass demonstration of 10,000 at the Doctors' Syndicate in Kafr El-Sheikh in the northern Delta. If this estimate is accurate, it would probably be the largest demonstration in Egypt since the Israeli attacks on Gaza began December 27. According to press reports, there were small demonstrations January 3 in the Delta governorates of Sharkia and Dakahlia. We have confirmed there were demonstrations January 3 in El-Arish approximately 20 miles south of the Gaza border, following the January 2 El-Arish demonstrations when police prevented protestors from moving to the Gaza border. A prominent blogger told us that the AMAY journalist whom police beat unconscious at a downtown Cairo demonstration on Friday, January 2, has left the hospital and returned to work. According to this blogger, the journalist told the police that he was covering the demonstration for \"AMAY,\" but the police continued to beat him anyway. The blogger said that the police prevented opposition journalists from covering downtown Cairo demonstrations December 31, and subsequently transported the journalists to a desert area bordering Cairo and left them there.\n\n6. (SBU) Contacts told local staff that police had violently suppressed a January 4 demonstration in the port city of Damietta, and have arrested several demonstrators. Contacts have estimated 1,500 demonstrators in Damietta January 4. The MB called for a demonstration the afternoon of January 4 outside the Engineers' Syndicate in downtown Cairo. We noticed a moderately heavy security presence in the vicinity around mid-day, and we will continue to monitor developments related to this demonstration.\n\n------------------------- Inside the Demonstrations ------------------------- 7. (C)\n\nA prominent blogger told us January 4 that the MB has tried to avoid chanting anti-Mubarak slogans during demonstrations as it realizes that the police will move in to stop demonstrations when such chanting begins. The blogger said that when leftist opposition members begin chanting such slogans during demonstrations, MB members try to drown them CAIRO 00000007 002 OF 002 out with shouts of \"God is great (Allahu Akbar).\"\n\n8. (C) A leading member of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) told us that MB members tried to stop an EOHR press conference at the Journalists' Syndicate during the week of December 28 by shouting insults accusing the organization of being an agent of the U.S. and the West, before the press conference eventually proceeded. This EOHR contact told us that his organization is asking the GOE to disclose the number of demonstrators it is currently holding in detention. He said the EOHR believes that the GOE has released most demonstrators from custody after a few hours of detention.

(S)\n\nOn January 5, Egyptian military officials briefed defense attaches on the situation in Gaza. The Egyptian military reports that the Egyptian-Gaza border remains stable, with no breaches since December 28. Egyptian border guards successfully prevented subsequent attempts to breach the border by a small number of unorganized individuals. Egyptian forces continue to receive occasional gunfire from the Gaza side of the border.\n\n2. (S) The Egyptian military estimates that Israeli air attacks have destroyed 50 percent of the main smuggling tunnels between Rafah and Gaza. They anticipate that the Israeli Defense Force will take additional measures to destroy the tunnels during the ground invasion. The Egyptian military stressed that the Rafah border would not be permanently opened until the Palestinian Authority regained control of the border crossings. They expressed concern that the Israelis were attempting to sever Gaza from the West Bank, leaving an independent Gaza as \"Egypt,s problem.8\n\n3. (SBU) According to the Egyptian military, 325 tons of medical aid has been delivered to Gaza since December 28, including 60 tons donated by the GOE. Assistance is being delivered through Rafah, Kerem Shalom, and most recently al-Aouja (Egyptian-Israeli border crossing in Central Sinai) due to the high volumes of goods. All material is being thoroughly searched for weapons and ammunition.\n\n-------------- Demonstrations -------------- 4.\n\n(SBU) Contacts told us that the police prevented the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) from holding a large demonstration planned for Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo on the afternoon of January 5; however, our contacts said the demonstration will be held elsewhere in the city either today or tomorrow. The police allowed the MB to lead a smaller demonstration at the Press Syndicate, not far from Tahrir Square, where approximately 400 people demonstrated as of 1430 hrs. local. Emboff observed a demonstration of about 200 people in front of the Mogamma (an enormous government building about half a kilometer from the embassy). The protestors were waving a Palestinian flag and chanting, \"We are with you, Hamas!\" There were at least 1500 police in full riot gear scattered throughout the public square in front of the Mogamma.\n\n5. (SBU) Contacts told us January 5 that about 17,000 demonstrated in a peaceful protest January in the Delta town of Tanta. Contacts remarked that police allowed the demonstrators to protest, and did not attack the crowd. The MB has claimed that it led demonstrations January 4 of at least 10,000 protestors each in the Delta town of Mansoura and in Fayoum (about 100 kilometers south of Cairo), and of 25,000 protestors in Alexandria.

Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 1. (S)\n\nSummary: IDF ground operations continued January 5 with heavy artillery fire and troop advances on Gaza City. After bisecting the Gaza Strip, IDF ground forces are methodically closing in on Gaza City. IDF leadership describes a \"root canal\" ground operation aimed at preventing rocket fire, seeking and destroying ammunition storage sites and Hamas combatants, and apprehending terrorists for further interrogation. IDF forces continue to hold ground in northern Gaza used earlier as rocket launching grounds. The number of rocket attacks has decreased, although 28 rockets were fired at Israel as of 1600 local. \"Tens of thousands\" of reservists were called up January 4 and 5, according to press reports, which indicated that some are intended to reinforce the northern border while others are being held in reserve for any expansion of operations in Gaza. PM Olmert made a number of phone calls to international leaders in the effort to convince the international community that Israel is making efforts to assist the population of Gaza as much as possible. Israeli press widely covers French President Sarkozy's anticipated arrival in Israel during the evening of January 5. The GOI continues to restrict media access to Gaza; while the MFA said it would allow a few foreign journalists to enter Gaza January 5, no foreign journalists in fact entered Gaza. On January 4, the GOI announced the establishment of a humanitarian coordination cell within the MOD. IDF sources confirmed that 49 out of 80 planned trucks of humanitarian supplies crossed into Gaza on January 5. IDF sources reported that approximately 200,000 liters of diesel fuel were transferred through the Nahal Oz fuel depot, but the Gaza power station contractor refused to pick up the delivery. Local embassies were planning to evacuate an additional 198 foreign nationals on January 5; no U.S. citizens were evacuated. However, the Canadian Embassy informed us that 18 Canadians and 16 other third country nationals were unable to leave Gaza via bus due to IDF-implemented road obstacles north of Gaza City. Continued call ups of local guards for reserve duty could affect Embassy Tel Aviv's security operations. End summary.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2. (S)\n\nAs of 1230 local, DAO members on the border with Gaza reported heavy artillery fire throughout the Northern Gaza Strip (from southern Gaza City to the northern border), which has been on-going throughout the morning. Apache and Cobra helicopter gunships provided tactical support for on-going troop advances toward and around Gaza City. DAO observers reported at 1400 local that there were no signs of ground operations along the border south of Karni. According to DAO, military police continued to deny foreign journalists access to the exclusive military zone surrounding Gaza, but did allow DAO personnel and other diplomats past checkpoints to areas near the Sufa crossing.\n\n3. (SBU) According to Israeli media outlets, the security establishment has set three main goals for the described \"root canal\" ground operation to destroy terror infrastructure in Gaza: 1) prevent further rocket launches; 2) seek and destroy ammunition storage sites and Hamas operatives; and 3) apprehend if possible those involved in terrorism for further interrogation. After bisecting the Gaza Strip, IDF troops have surrounded Gaza City, and are now cautiously and methodically closing in. IDF ground forces lay to the north, south, and east of the city, with Israeli naval vessels deployed off-shore to the west. IDF ground forces deployed from the Karni crossing to the Mediterranean have cut off Gaza City from potential Hamas reinforcements and supplies from the south.\n\n4. (SBU) IDF forces continue to hold ground in the northern towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya; ministers were briefed during the January 4 cabinet meeting that 73 percent of all rockets fired at Israel during the last week were launched from these areas seized by IDF forces. The number of rocket attacks has decreased as a result, although approximately 28 rockets as of 1600 local have thus far been fired at Israel on January 5, including at least 4 long-range grads. No Israeli casualties were reported as a result of these strikes as of 1600 local. The Israel Air Force (IAF) struck over 30 targets during the evening of January 4, including tunnels, TEL AVIV 00000015 002 OF 004 homes of Hamas operatives, and ammunition and rocket stores. Following the death of an IDF soldier on January 4, there have now been five Israeli fatalities -- two soldiers and three civilians -- since Operation Cast Lead began. According to Reuters and AFP, over 530 Palestinians have been killed since the operation began. Approximately 50 IDF soldiers have been wounded as a result of the ground combat operation.\n\n5. (SBU) Israeli press outlets speculate that Hamas is attempting to draw IDF forces into dense urban areas in order to maximize IDF casualties or attempt soldier kidnappings. Several press outlets report comments from \"security sources\" cliaming that the IDF has internalized the lessons learned from the 2006 war in Lebanon: for example, by maneuvering constantly around the combat zone in order to prevent creating stationary targets for Hamas -- as well as opportunities to kidnap IDF soldiers.\n\n6. (SBU) The press reported an attempted kidnapping by Hamas of an IDF soldier on January 4. According to the press, the IDF soldier from the Golani infantry brigade had been cut off from his unit, and engaged in a firefight with Hamas operatives who attempted to pull him into a tunnel. The soldier was apparently able to escape following the arrival of helicopter air support. In response to the intense media coverage -- both local and international -- of the alleged kidnapping of two IDF soldiers, the IDF spokesperson stated the IDF will not respond to false Hamas-generated rumors, and would report in the future any factual kidnappings to the public in an appropriate manner.\n\nNorthern Border --------------- 7. (S/NF)\n\nDAO reports Israel Defense Intelligence (IDI) concerns regarding possible action by Hizballah, Iran, or Global Jihad organizations, particularly with the one-year anniversary of Imad Mughniyah's death on February 12. On-going IDI and Israel Naval Intelligence analysis strongly indicates a possible maritime attack scenario within the region or abroad. The current IDI assessment is that Hizballah may act now, as Hizballah may see Israel as less likely to be drawn into additional fighting over a one-time Hizballah terrorist response due to on-going IDF operations in Gaza.\n\n8. (SBU) The Israeli press covered January 4 comments made by Director of Military Intelligence Major General Amos Yadlin suggesting Hizballah may open a second front against Israel in the north. The IDF called up \"tens of thousands\" of reservists on January 4, which could be used against potential attacks in the north and the West Bank. Israeli media outlet YNET picked up Syrian newspaper al-Watan's coverage of significantly increased Lebanese and UNFIL patrols in southern Lebanon.\n\nPolitical and Diplomatic Developments ------------------------------------- 9. (SBU)\n\nThe regular Sunday cabinet meeting was moved to Tel Aviv on January 4 as is customary in times of major military operations. The cabinet discussed the continued fighting in the south and in addition to hearing a statement from PM Olmert (ref B), was briefed by Defense Minister Barak, Foreign Minister Livni, IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi, as well as by senior intelligence chiefs. Livni briefed ministers on the various diplomatic issues related to the operation in the south. Education Minister Tamir discussed school cancellations in the south during the emergency.

Contacts expressed mounting anger at what they termed the \"randomness\" of Israeli attacks. CNN's bureau chief described a woman at Shifa Hospital who said her baby died after four days without food or water. End Summary.\n\nSTRESS MOUNTS WITH INTENSE BARRAGES ON JANUARY 5 AND 6 =========================== 2. (C)\n\nAmideast Gaza Director Anees Abu Hashem, clearly exhausted after a sleepless night, told PDoff that he could not believe he survived the night. He said the IDF commenced a barrage on Gaza City at 17:00 local time January 5. Airstrikes began at nightfall. He said that, each time the bombs struck, he closed his eyes and crouched down: \"Every time I opened my eyes again, I couldn't believe I was still alive.\" He characterized the bombing as \"totally random,\" saying there were no militants visible in his area of the city. Abu Hashem expressed anger at the mounting civilian death toll: \"The IDF is not organized. I am a witness here. They have lost their minds. They are killing civilians.\" He did not know what he would do if the IDF were to invade his neighborhood, and remarked, \"I am afraid tonight will be even worse.\"\n\n3. (C) Former Fulbright Senior Scholar and Al-Azhar University professor Dr. Jamil Salem told PDoff that his town of Saftawi, located between Gaza City and Jabalya, had been increasingly hit by what he termed \"indiscriminate\" Israeli fire. Just prior to the phone conversation, Dr. Salem said that two Israeli tank shells struck his next-door neighbors' home, destroying a whole portion of the house. Fortunately, no one was in the destroyed part of the house, so there were no injuries. Sounding angry and agitated, Salem said that no emergency personnel had been able to get through to the worst-hit areas in the past two days, and many dead and wounded were still trapped beneath mounds of rubble.\n\n4. (C) While speaking with EconOff about rumors of an IDF-imposed 18:00 curfew on Gaza City, USAID project employee Salem Al-Raiz abruptly cut off the phone call after the sound of a huge explosion on his end of the line, followed by loud screams. \"I don't know where it came from. A shell,\" Raiz said. He cut the call short, saying he had to go and help.\n\nMILITANTS MOVE INTO NEW NEIGHBORHOODS ===================================== 5. (C)\n\nAl-Azhar University professor Dr. Nehaya El-Telbani reported to PDoff that a Qassam rocket crew tried to fire from an olive grove near her neighborhood in the central Gaza town of Zawayda, but that \"Israeli F-16s\" had responded almost immediately. She was surprised the militants had tried to launch Qassams from her area, as she does not live close to the Israeli border. She suspected they had been pushed back by Israeli forces. Telbani said that her six children are screaming day and night, and her eight-year-old has started wetting his bed again. She added that they are completely cut off from north Gaza, with the IDF surrounding Khan Younis.\n\n6. (C) El-Telbani told PDoff that she had received a pre-recorded call on January 5 saying in Arabic: \"This is the Israeli Defense Forces. We do care about you civilians. If you have terrorists living near you, please call this number. Do not let yourself become a cover for terrorists. If you know they are there, then get out.\" Other ConGen contacts reported receiving similar calls.\n\nRUNNING LOW ON ESSENTIALS ========================= 7. (C)\n\nGaza American Corner director Dr. Awni Karazon, who has moved three times since his home was partially destroyed several days ago, told PDoff that he risked his life to return to his bombed-out house to gather some powdered milk, canned foods, and clothes for his kids. He said his old neighborhood was a \"ghost town\". He managed to procure two gallons of water, a mix of 25 percent mineral and 75 percent tap water, being distributed by employees at a local mineral water plant. When asked if he might consider moving into an JERUSALEM 00000049 002 OF 002 UNRWA shelter for the displaced, Karzon said he would consider this only as a last resort, noting that the IDF had struck UNRWA shelters in the last 24 hours.\n\n8. (C) Deposed independent Gaza City Mayor Majid Abu Ramadan told Poloff that he used his remaining gasoline last night to power a generator for three to four hours, allowing five neighboring families to obtain running water.\n\n9. (C) Other contacts said they are also facing increasing shortages of food, water, fuel, and electricity. CNN's Jerusalem bureau chief Kevin Flower told PD chief that his cameraman had encountered a woman at Shifa Hospital who said her six-month-old baby died after four days without food or water. Amideast Director Abu Hashem told PDOff that he has not had electricity or running water for five days, and his pregnant wife and children are all surviving on potatoes, rice, and olives. He mentioned that thousands of displaced persons are staying at UNRWA schools, but, as they do not have sufficient blankets, some local families are contributing extra blankets and bedding to UNRWA. Dr. Telbani said that she has been making bread at home, but is down to her last bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables are an expensive luxury, she added. Just today, her husband took a risky trip to Maghazi camp to buy food for the family. He returned with only a single orange.

PA security chiefs told ConGenOffs that the PA urged the IDF to avoid Palestinian demonstrations and to refrain from using live ammunition, which killed three Palestinian demonstrators in recent days. According to PA commanders, the two sides agreed to expedite coordination and exchange information on disturbances and agreed both sides have an interest in avoiding violent clashes.

MG Ali said IDF commanders told them live ammunition is the last resort when dealing with Palestinian demonstrators, and IDF rules of engagement only authorize it when the lives of IDF soldiers or Israeli citizens are at immediate risk. PA security chiefs said IDF BG Tibon reported that the Nil'in village shooting (in which two Palestinian were killed by IDF fire) was quickly investigated by the IDF, and that an IDF officer has already been referred to a disciplinary board for improper use of live ammunition during the incident. According to MG Ali, both BGs Tibon and Mordechai said they re-issued instructions to all forces operating in the West Bank to abide strictly by rules of engagement and refrain from using live rounds against unarmed demonstrators.\n\n4. (C) MG Ali added that IDF commanders said that in the Silwad incidents the Palestinian was about to throw a firebomb, thus endangering soldiers' lives, and that according to IDF rules of engagement Palestinians with firebombs are a threat to life and can be engaged with live ammunition. He added that both IDF commanders agreed, however, that in most cases, even demonstrators with firebombs should not be engaged, and troops should find non-lethal means of controlling the situation.\n\nBoth Sides Agree to Increase Coordination ----------------------------------------- 5.\n\n(S) According to PA security chiefs, the second part of the meeting was dedicated to a review the West Bank security situation. PA commanders said they told IDF officers that President Abbas and PM Fayyad both directed them to avoid situations that could develop into confrontations with the IDF. The security chiefs said Abbas and Fayyad passed a message to all Palestinian factions, at a PLO Executive Committee meeting on December 29, that only peaceful marches away from flashpoints would be permitted. PA commanders noted they have no control on over B/C areas such as Qalandiya and Nil'in, and would need IDF approval to move PA forces to those areas to prevent clashes between protesters and the IDF. PA commanders said both sides agreed that Hebron is a problem, and cooperation on a case-by-case basis is critical. PA commanders said their IDF counterparts agreed to expedite coordination and movement requests and exchange information on possible disturbances, as both sides have an interest in preventing West Bank violence. They said both sides also agreed not to leak substantive discussions about the meeting to the press, given the sensitivity of JERUSALEM 00002314 002 OF 002 PA-GOI security coordination in a time of Palestinian outrage over events in Gaza.\n\nFayyad Confirms MoD Contacts ---------------------------- 6.\n\n(S) In a separate conversation with the Consul General, PM Fayyad said he had received messages from the Israeli MoD on December 29 indicating that the Israeli security leadership understands the need for the IDF to deploy in the West Bank in a way that will minimize confrontations with Palestinian civilians. Fayyad said he was encouraged by the messages, but would watch carefully to see how these instructions are implemented by IDF commanders on the ground.

No ground operations have been initiated; the senior GOI leadership is discussing a range of options. Air strikes during the early morning hours of December 30 destroyed a number of Hamas strategic and tactical targets, including a government complex in Gaza City. Rockets and mortars from Gaza continued to strike Israel, reaching as far north as Yavne and as far east as Rahat; one Israeli woman in Ashdod and an IDF soldier near Nahal Oz were killed in rocket strikes during the evening of December 29. According to the IDF, 93 truckloads of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing during the day on December 30. During a strategic assessment meeting on December 29, PM Olmert challenged GOI officials to avoid talk of a ceasefire, and directed IDF forces to continue their operations with an undefined duration. An Israeli Navy vessel rammed a boat from the Free Gaza movement carrying humanitarian assistance to Gaza from Cyprus, forcing it to turn back. The Free Gaza boat sustained damage but was able to travel north to the Lebanese port of Tyre. The Embassy disseminated a warden message to avoid the 30km area from Gaza due to on-going IDF operations and rocket attacks. End summary.\n\nMilitary Operations ------------------- 2.\n\n(SBU) Israeli air and naval forces attacked dozens of Hamas targets throughout the Gaza Strip overnight and during the morning hours of December 30. According to the IDF Spokesperson, targets included three buildings in the Hamas government complex -- including the Hamas ministries of interior and foreign affairs and PM's offices -- in the Tel Al-Hawa neighborhood, Hamas training camps and outposts, stations held by Hamas naval forces, a vehicle transporting a stockpile of Grad missiles, rocket launchers, a weaponry manufacturing facility, and sites used as headquarters by terror cells. Israeli media reported that two top Hamas weapons engineers were killed in the December 29 strike on research labs at the Islamic University.\n\n3. (S/NF) The IDF continues its deployment of ground forces around the Gaza periphery, although no ground operations had been initiated as of 1800 local. Poor weather conditions may have been a contributing factor, although late-breaking press reports also indicate that \"senior defense officials\" may recommend a 48-hour truce to evaluate Hamas' reaction prior to launching any ground offensive. Israel Defense Intelligence (IDI) sources told DAO officers that ground operations could begin at any time; a deciding factor would be weather conditions facilitating the ability to provide close air support and medical evacuation. During the evening of December 29, rain and lowered ceilings dominated weather conditions; overcast skies were prevalent over Gaza during much of the day on December 30. The tempo of air operations decreased greatly during the afternoon of December 30.\n\n4. (S) The IDF continues to reinforce and increase its logistical footprint around Gaza. DAO officers observed more robust logistical support for units in assembly areas at Erez Crossing and at the artillery position located south of Kibbutz Nir'am. Unit flags, tents, and port-a-johns have been erected at these locations. Overnight, reinforcements from units previously unobserved in the Gaza sector arrived, including elements of the Givati Brigade, the Golani Brigade's 12th Battalion, and the Kfir Brigade's Heruv Battalion. DAO reports that the preponderance of IDF units are located around the northern half of Gaza; the deployment of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with mounted mock turrets may represent decoy attempts to portray a larger presence in the south.\n\n5. (S) DATT reports that during a briefing to military attaches and UN military representatives on December 29, IDF Strategic Division Commander Brigadier General Yossi Heyman noted the 122mm rocket attacks on the port of Ashdod demonstrated that Hamas is capable of launching rockets of up to 35km -- putting more than 500,000 Israelis in the range of rockets emanating from Gaza. BG Heyman said the IDF was \"prepared for a long operation,\" and stressed that the IDF was doing its best to minimize civilian casualties. Reserve Brigadier General Baruch Spiegel informally mentioned to embassy officers December 30 that the IDF is ready to carry out a detailed plan for ground operations with multiple TEL AVIV 00002922 002 OF 003 stages and a range of levels of intensity, but is waiting for orders from the political level -- presumably the inner war cabinet of PM Olmert, Defense Minister Barak, Foreign Minister Livni, and Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi. Spiegel said he thought the decision whether to launch a ground operation would be made in the next 48 hours. He commented that the IDF is not in a hurry and can continue to build up ground forces without pressure to act. Spiegel and his colleague at the Economic Cooperation Foundation Boaz Karni told us that the GOI's goal of a \"sustainable ceasefire\" was being complicated by the fact that senior Hamas officials in Gaza have all gone underground and are not able to communicate with potential mediators.\n\n6. (SBU) As of 1715 local December 30, approximately 20 rockets have been fired throughout the day from Gaza, according to press reports. Most of these rockets landed in or near Sderot, injuring two Israelis and damaging several properties. One rocket struck as far east as the vicinity of Rahat; another Qassam rocket scored a direct hit on a kibbutz dining hall in the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council. According to the Israeli MFA, approximately 90 rockets were fired from Gaza at Israel on December 29. Three Israelis were killed by rocket and mortar fire on December 29, including a construction worker in Ashkelon (Grad-type rocket), a soldier in the Nahal Oz area (Qassam/mortar attack), and a woman in Ashdod (Grad-type rocket). Four Israelis have been killed since the start of operation \"Cast Lead\" on December 27. During the evening of December 29, several rockets hit in or near Okafim in the east and Yavne in the north, demonstrating increasing range. Israeli schools in a 30km radius from Gaza remained closed on December 30.\n\nPolitical Developments ---------------------- 7.\n\n(SBU) According to media reports, during a December 29 evening situation assessment meeting with FM Livni, Defense Minister Barak, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ashkenazi, Shin Bet Director Diskin, and Mossad Director Dagan, PM Olmert reportedly instructed meeting attendees not to talk about a cease-fire with Hamas. He ordered the IDF to continue its actions with an undefined end to the operation. Olmert stressed that Israel will act against Hamas \"with an iron fist,\" but would treat the population in Gaza \"with silk gloves\" by ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid, food, and other needs.\n\n8. (SBU) Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Binyamin Ben-Eliezer (Labor Party) said to the press that Israel would not cease the operation in Gaza until Hamas stopped firing rockets at Israel. He said the operation will continue until a \"new reality\" is created in which communities on the Gaza periphery can \"lead their lives quietly.\" Minister for Industry, Trade and Labor Eli Yishai (Shas Party) commented that the Israeli elections scheduled for February 10 should not be postponed due to the situation in Gaza.\n\n9. (C) The MFA is closely following Egyptian-Turkish discussions of possible ceasefire terms, which they believe are backed by the USG. Israeli press reports, meanwhile, speculate on a joint French-British proposal to force a cease-fire on Israel and Hamas. According to the press, the proposal will be presented at an emergency session of the EU's foreign ministers' meeting on December 30. The Israeli press quotes Foreign Ministry sources as saying the \"British are promoting a very bad proposal for Israel.\" The same sources indicate the \"international hourglass\" would allow Israel to continue its operation in Gaza at most until January 5. Israeli press reports indicate that \"senior defense officials\" may recommend a short-term cessation of hostilities to evaluate Hamas' reaction, although the cabinet's views on any such suggestion were unclear as of 1800 local.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295501593", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Silver Z here, playing Gold dudes.\n\nJust a few notes and this has been said of my Toss play when I go random, that is there are **larger holes in your play than just macro**. It's not whether you go thor or he does this or that. That matters but first get yourself used to a build order. Eg when I am Z v X I have certain strats. You opened with two rax after seeing him go hatch first. Good. But why send one rine and then get tech labs? He insta spawned 6 lings which crushed your att. This is good for you because as Z all we wanna do is make drones and you've forced him not to make drones, good. Macro up. Get an **orbital command**. I cannot stress that enough. MULES are OP ( well not really ) but he has queens and you have no MULES. Bad. You then expand and proceed to get...two factories? \n\nIdea here is that *what do you wanna do?* I can see you're spending money better than your Z opponent and if I remember correctly you have more scvs than he has drones. Your hole is in that you don't have a plan. Or to me it seems that way. Learn build orders and try to practice your timings better. Your first push could have pressured Z even more if you made a few more rines instead of a tech lab. And do note that when you do something do it properly and not everything at the same time. It's easy to say \"spend money = macro\" and then expo while teching and building structures while *not* building scvs and units. Wrong. If you wanna tech up and expo you would normally die. So hopefully you get what I was trying to say, build orders and spend wisely, not *just spend*.\n\nAnd oh, do scout. If you could see more lings than usual than get more tanks or in your case get a few more of those hellions. Try to gauge while scouting.\n\nI may be wrong in my analysis though, given that I'm just silver so if anyone else wants to correct me feel free to do so. I *just* might be a changeling. ;)\n\nGLHF", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295534558", "subreddit": "StarcraftFeedback", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As a good Mejai's hero, you want all the kills you can get, and ignite also helps when fighting healing heroes. I personally pick up cleanse so I can break out of stun locks +ult.\n\nMasteries: 9 0 21. Havoc is cool and all, but utility overall provides you with many more relevant bonuses.\n\nRunes: Mag pen reds, mana regen yellows. Blues and quints are up to you (AP/level, cooldown, or mana regen are all reasonable choices on blue; AP, health, or move speed on quints).\n\nSkills: Q E Q E Q R Q E Q E R E W W W R W W. While E is a beastly spell, Q is just your most reliable, spammable spell by a long shot, so you gotta max it first. W is literally there just to get E stacks. :(\n\nItems: Blue crystal and 2 health pots. Catalyst (ASAP!) and boots. Rod of Ages and Mejai's. Sorcerer's shoes. From there, you can get whatever you think appropriate.\n\nLane: Unless the enemy is a weak laner, you'll probably be pretty defensive at the start, using your Q for last-hitting just as much as (if not more than) harassing. When you can afford catalyst, go back for it (if it's not a good time to leave your lane empty, go once you can afford catalyst+boots, at the latest). Starting at level 6 you can take part in ganks and harass aggressively (and should be getting blue buff as often as possible).\n\nGanks: Be aggressive. Your R can deal more damage than you'd expect. Try to start fights with 4+ stacks on your E. Practice the R+Q combo (look at your enemy, not you) and the R+E combo (aim past them from the start, otherwise you might E backwards!).\n\nTeam Fights: Go for hit-and-run spikes and cleanup. Avoid getting in melee range of the enemy group until they've blown their spells and are focusing other people. Your E is super useful for team support (try to hit as many people as you can) and its stacks will refresh frequently in team fights, while your Q is great for shutting down squishies. Use your ult to avoid getting spiked and to finish off runners (or, if the enemy is disorganized, use it to initiate against a straggler with Q and E).\n\nGL and HF. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1295604501", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Most classical pieces in a minor key use harmonic minor.  Here's an example of a minor scale: \n\nA minor (natural):\n\nA B C D E F G A \n\nTo make this a harmonic minor scale, raise the seventh note:\n\nA B C D E F G# A\n\nThis is called \"harmonic\" because it modifies the harmony of the V chord, making it E G# B.  It creates a leading tone (the G#) back to the tonic, and is generally a more satisfying cadence.   However it's not necessary to always play G# instead of G, it's more like an option.  So that second scale is \"harmonic minor\", but the key is still A minor.\n\nIf you're playing the harmonic minor scale upwards, you'll get the augmented second leap from F to G#.  This is probably the interesting sound you're hearing as you play the scale on your harmonica.  You may not notice this in classical pieces because traditionally this interval is used judiciously in melodies.   There is another variant of the minor scale, called \"melodic\", which also raises (in our example above) the F to F#, which eliminates this weird interval and is typically used for melodies that go up stepwise to the tonic.  Confusingly enough, when traveling down from the tonic, the proper melodic minor scale is the natural minor scale.  \n\n\"tuning\" to harmonic minor would only really apply to an instrument with a fixed scale, like a harmonica.

{"body": "For easier reading (I also added some paragraphs\":\n\n\n                  \nIt started out like any other argument Dad and I would have. “Why would you do something so stupid? You should know better!” This time, he was upset with me for being a pizza delivery person, which was something he begged me not to do. \n\nAt sixteen years old, I was not much of the rebellious type. I still had the kind of father who excessively sought to protect his kids, especially the baby of the family: me.  Compared to my two siblings, Dad held sort-of an iron fist over me, thinking I could not handle the world on my own.  This job was my first attempt at independence. I had failed.\n\nOnce we got in his truck, the focus of the argument shifted.  My father scolded me for nearly the entire ride, making comments like, “Now Sarah, I’m not mad at you or angry with you. I’m just so disappointed in you.” I started to tear up and kept silent like I always had. Hearing him say he was disappointed caught me off guard.  When we were finally home, I kept silent as I walked up the stairs to my bedroom.  I quickly shut and locked the door.   \n\nMy father’s words echoed in my head. I repeated them over and over again, feeling worthless, hopeless, with no apparent end in sight to any of these feelings. Lying face toward the ceiling on my bed was the only thing I had enough energy to do. I thought about how I could be enjoying our first football game of the season, listening to my friends in the marching band play, and how much fun everyone else was having…except me. Looking at my phone, I saw I had no missed calls and no new text messages. I felt utterly alone.\n\nI got up to go to the bathroom to dry my tear-streaked face. As I stood in front of the mirror for a few moments, I did not recognize myself. “Why does this happy person look so upset?” I hated my reflection. Never have I seen so much disgust in my reflection. I started crying some more, but kept as silent as possible. I could not stop crying or simply dismiss my self-resentment, along with any other feeling of melancholy. How could anyone ever love me? I repeated these thoughts for a couple of minutes. I thought of how others would solve their self-hatred. I thought of cutting myself.\n\nThe razor I used for shaving seemed to have too small of blades. I wanted deep precision. Thoughts of my dad’s box of razorblades entered my mind; they were in the garage, next to his tools. Figuring he would not notice one missing, I crept silently downstairs to our garage—thankfully everyone home was occupied watching television. Before I knew it, I was crouching back to my room, and I found myself irrationally excited about cutting. Quickly locking the door behind me, I grabbed a journal and a pen to write down my thoughts. With pillows supporting my back, I sat upright.\nI took the single razorblade out of its protective shell and sat there staring at its shiny, thin features. Thinking of how glorious it would feel to slice it into my arms, I started writing down my thoughts: \n\n*You’re always so quick to point the finger\nBut it’s not your place to judge\nAnd that was my final nudge.\nSo I lock the door behind me\nTrying to cry myself to sleep\n Now I don’t understand how I’ve survived thru this week.*\n\n\n*It’s my turn to pay the price\nAnd with this razor I will sacrifice\nMy blood and every single tear\nEven though you’re so near there’s nothing that I fear more.*\n\n*Every time I reach out to you \nYou turn away and look in dismay\nActing like I’m some sort of drug \nThis seems to be the only way I’m ever gonna’ get thru*\n\n\n*It’s when I see my friend\n That has a sharp edge—\nIt’s my only way of reaching the ledge\nThe ledge that leads me to\nA place where no one can see this face\nThis face of doom.* \n\n\n*At least that’s what they tell me\nThey say I’m a big disgrace\nWhen the only thing that’s really happened\nIs that I’ve fallen from grace.* \n\n\n*It’s my turn to pay the price\nAnd with this razor I now sacrifice\nMy blood and every fucking tear\nEven though you are so near\n There’s nothing more that I fear.*\n\nSetting down my pen, I grabbed the razor. The first cut created a warming numbness all over my body. The second one recreated the sensation. After the sixth or seventh slice, I decided that my cuts did not look deep enough and retraced some of the other slices, along with making new ones. My whole body felt like it was tingling. A smile came to my face. I read and re-read my poem, feeling accomplished. I smeared the blood from my wrists over the page. A bloody masterpiece had just been created. The smile lingered until I saw the blood covering my arms.\n\nI sat and stared at the tiny blood-soaked razor marks. These fresh markings that had just made me feel alive suddenly evoked an unspeakable horror. Was I really trying to kill myself? I could not answer I was unsure. Fortunately, the markings did not appear to be very deep. Maybe there wouldn’t be any scars. Shutting my eyes in disbelief, my eyes began to drown once more. I n h a l e.  E x h a l e. I am alive.\n\n In a moment’s notice, I started writing my mom a letter, explaining everything that I had experimented with in the past few years. I figured, “Why not be completely honest?” In the letter, I wrote about how I started drinking my freshman year, smoking pot my sophomore year, and stopped because neither nulled my pain. I said that I popped Xanex a few times, and stopped taking them because they, too, did not solve my problems. I also said for her to not worry about my virginity since I was still a virgin, and I was currently sober. I told her I cut myself, and that it was not her fault.\n\nI heard a knock on my door. “Sarah, are you okay in there?” my mom said through the door. I folded the letter, stuck it in the envelope, and wrote her name on it. “Just a second,” I managed to say. Quickly hiding the razor in my pillowcase, I looked at my arms and said, “Guess she’ll figure it out anyway.” I unlocked the door, immediately showing her my arms and handed her the letter. Tears began streaming down my face. I realized I could not face my suffering alone ever again. Mom and I cried together on my bed. Mothers still have a way of comforting, of easing pain. Moments later, we both went out to the living room to tell my father what happened.  I showed him my arms. Dad just held me, stroking my hair; he was unsure of what to say. My mom sat to my right, holding my hand. When he and Mom finally got up to head off to bed, he looked me in my eyes and said, “I love you.” Neither of us managed to hold back our tears. “I love you too, Daddy.”\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296071530", "subreddit": "WritersGroup", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My thoughts on a drowning/spiking to death trap is basically have the spiders spawn and fall onto a field of cactus. The walls have water falls coming out all around the room and then the spiders get pushed down towards the cactus if they try to climb. Then when they die the string that falls will float to a collecting spot. Looking something like this.\r\nFront View:\r\n    XXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\n    XW W W W W WX\r\n    X           X\r\n    X     S     X\r\n    X           X\r\n    X C C C C C X\r\n    X C C C C C X\r\n    X C C C C C X\r\n    XXXXXXWXXXXXX\r\n\r\nWater would also be coming down the sides as well.\r\nand I don't believe you should ever have to worry about \"missing\" any string because the spiders should just keep spawning and you can collect as much as you want. Let me know what you guys think of my design and if it would work or not. I haven't been able to collect any cactus yet in my world because I spawned right on top of the dungeon and have been working around it ever since trying to figure out how to trap them. Hence what I came up with :) \r\n\r\n\r\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296155899", "subreddit": "Minecraft", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Cut off excess (Waaaayyy more important than it sounds, don't skip this step)\n\n**Step 4:** Tie one end of twine around balloon, other end around ball sack. (Females w/o ball sacks- find a short stick and tie the other end of the twine around that, turn it sideways and bingo, drainstopper magic)\n\n**Step 5:** To infinity and beyond. Seriously, no gentle way to say this, shove the balloon up your ass. I prefer putting one foot up on the toilet seat in a sort of \"got a lil captain in me\" pose but others swear by the on all fours approach.\n\n**Step 6:** Travel and enjoy without worry of cops finding anything in your car!\n\n*Bonus:* Use beeswax covered hemp rope and you can use it to light your herb when you get where you're going- just be sure to save enough for the trip home if required. Trust me, being able to tie that sucker off on your ball sack is crucial for retrieval upon arriving at your destination.\n\nedit: s p a c i n g", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296159936", "subreddit": "trees", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

(C) Summary and comment: Police brutality in Egypt against common criminals is routine and pervasive. Contacts describe the police using force to extract confessions from criminals as a daily event, resulting from poor training and understaffing. Brutality against Islamist detainees has reportedly decreased overall, but security forces still resort to torturing Muslim Brotherhood activists who are deemed to pose a political threat. Over the past five years, the government has stopped denying that torture exists, and since late 2007 courts have sentenced approximately 15 police officers to prison terms for torture and killings.\n Independent NGOs have criticized GOE-led efforts to provide human rights training for the police as ineffective and lacking political will. The GOE has not yet made a serious effort to transform the police from an instrument of regime power into a public service institution. We want to continue a USG-funded police training program (ref F), and to look for other ways to help the GOE address police brutality. End summary and comment.\n\n ------------------- \nA Pervasive Problem \n------------------- ¶\n\n¶2. (C) Torture and police brutality in Egypt are endemic and widespread. The police use brutal methods mostly against common criminals to extract confessions, but also against demonstrators, certain political prisoners and unfortunate bystanders. One human rights lawyer told us there is evidence of torture in Egypt dating back to the times of the Pharaohs. NGO contacts estimate there are literally hundreds of torture incidents every day in Cairo police stations alone. Egyptians are bombarded with consistent news reports of police brutality, ranging from high profile incidents such as accidental but lethal police shootings in Salamut and Aswan this past fall (refs B and C) that sparked riots, to reports of police officers shooting civilians following disputes over traffic tickets. In November 2008 alone, there were two incidents of off-duty police officers shooting and killing civilians over petty disputes. The cases against both officers are currently making their way through the judicial system.\n\n¶3. (C) NGO and academic contacts from across the political spectrum report witnessing police brutality as part of their daily lives. One academic at XXXXXXXXXXXX  told us XXXXXXXXXXXX the police proceeded to beat a female suspect into confessing about others involved in the theft and the whereabouts of the stolen valuables. A contact from an international NGO described witnessing police beat the doorman of an upscale Cairo apartment building into disclosing the apartment number of a suspect. Another contact at a human rights NGO told us that her friends do not report thefts from their apartments because they do not want to subject “all the doormen” in the vicinity to police beatings. She told us that the police’s use of force has pervaded Egyptian culture to the extent that one popular television soap opera recently featured a police detective hero who beats up suspects to collect evidence.\n\n¶4. (C) Contacts attribute police brutality to poor training, understaffing and official sanction. Human rights lawyer XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX speculated that officers routinely resort to brutality because of pressure from their superiors to solve crimes. He asserted that most officers think solving crimes justifies brutal interrogation methods, and that some policemen believe that Islamic law sanctions torture. XXXXXXXXXXXX commented that a culture of judicial impunity for police officers enables continued brutality. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, “Police officers feel they are above the law and protected by the public prosecutor.” Human rights lawyer XXXXXXXXXXXX attributed police brutality against common criminals, including the use of electric shocks, to the problem of demoralized officers facing long hours and their own economic problems. He asserted that the police will even beat lawyers who enter police stations to defend their clients.\n\n ----------------------- \nCriminals and Islamists \n----------------------- \n\n¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX explained that since the GOE opened a dialogue with formerly violent Islamists, such as the Islamic Group, following the 1997 Luxor terrorist attacks, torture of Islamists has decreased. XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed that the GOE now treats Islamists better than common criminals. Some Islamist detainees are “spoiled,” he asserted, with regular access to visits from friends and family, decent food and education. Before the Luxor attacks, XXXXXXXXXXXX commented, the government would torture Islamist detainees on a daily basis.\n\n¶6. (C) Attorney XXXXXXXXXXXXXX commented that the GOE is more reluctant to torture Islamists, including Muslim Brotherhood (MB) members, because of their persistence in making public political statements, and their contacts with international NGOs that could embarrass the regime. XXXXXXXXXXXX speculated that the exception to this rule is when MB members mobilize people against the government in a way the regime deems threatening, such as the April 6 Facebook strike (ref D). According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the MB-affiliated blogger and “April 6 Movement” member XXXXXXXXXXXX whom police arrested XXXXXXXXXXXX (ref A) falls into this category, and the GOE is probably torturing him to scare other “April 6” members into abandoning their political activities. XXXXXXXXXXXX’s assessment tracks with “April 6” member XXXXXXXXXXXX’s accounts of his own torture and the alleged police sexual molestation of a female “April 6” activist this past November (ref A). Bloggers close to XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that following his arrest he was tortured severely with electric shocks and needed to be hospitalized, but that security forces stopped the torture when he began cooperating.\n\n ---------------------------- \nGOE Awareness of the Problem \n---------------------------- \n\n¶7. (C) Contacts agree that in the past five years, the government has stopped denying that torture exists and has taken some steps to address the problem. However, contacts believe that the Interior Ministry lacks the political will to take substantive action to change the culture of police brutality. XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted that following alleged standing orders from the Interior Ministry between 2000 and 2006 for the police to shoot, beat and humiliate judges in order to undermine judicial independence, the GOE made a political decision in 2007 to allow the courts to sentence police officers to short prison terms. XXXXXXXXXXXX described the 2007 Imad El-Kebir case as a turning point in influencing the government to permit the sentencing of police officers.\n (Note: Per ref E, a court sentenced two police officers to three years in prison in November 2007 for assaulting and sodomizing bus driver Imad El-Kebir. The case gained notoriety after a cell phone video recording of the torture was posted on YouTube. End note.)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296275043", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
