{"body": "Gah, watching The King's Speech was soo hard for me, so cringey! Have you seen Rocket Science? Great movie.\n\nAnyway, I am a former stutter, but it still shows up when I'm super stressed. I had speech therapy for 6+ years starting when I was about 3 or 4. I also entered kindergarten wearing an eye patch in order to strengthen my other eye after lazy eye surgery and wore brown orthopedic shoes due to a high arch for years. Yeah, I totally got picked on and hated it. Kids are assholes, etc etc. I couldn't say the following letters without extreme difficulty : w r t p d f g j c v b n and m, which was a total bitch. I remember them checking my hearing a lot, and doing cognition tests. Turns out, I was healthy I just stuttered very badly. My mother went to a teaching university so I was helped by graduate students, boy did they make it fun teaching me about where to put your tongue and what to focus on and gave me a life long interest in linguists. \n\nI think what made it worse was the domino effect of not being able to control the tongue and people's reactions to it. The snickers and weird looks and all of that just makes you more anxious and it just snow balls. My mom, as a joke, would nudge me in the back, like you would a skipping record and laugh, but inside I felt so embarrassed. After years of flash cards and exercises, I over came it. Today, you'd never guess I'd ever had a problem. And the eyes look normal too, except when I drink too much or am tired, that kinda like how you can tell I've had too much, haha!\n\nSo, all I can say is my heart goes out to you, and hang in there, this can be changed.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296527579", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Tension and release, man. First, let's assume you have bare-bones music theory knowledge (scales- mainly major, minor, and pentatonic, and basic chords). Let's look at the C Major scale: C D E F G A B. You have 3 really safe notes to play, the triad for the chord the rhythm parts are playing- i.e. they start on a C chord, you can play C, E, or G till the cows come home.\n\nBut that'd be boring just playing harmonies, wouldn't it? That's where tension and release comes in. Moving out of that \"safe\" zone creates tension in the chords as non-triadic intervals are made, like playing a B during a C chord. But once you're there, you don't want to sit on this tension, do you? That's why you return to that safe, harmonic zone. And now mix all this up- like for one 4/4 bar with a C chord backing, you could play C-C-D-F-G-G-A-E as eighth notes.\n\nSome tips for this are:\n\n* Return (aka resolve) on 1 and 3. It helps lead the listener along.\n* Pentatonic major/minor are going to be mostly safe most of the time, so it's easy to just start out trying to build your chops on this. Don't use it as a crutch, though!\n* Another way to think of it is that tension is the flavor and release as the substance. Use tension to spice up stuff, but don't forget about the substance.\n* Also look up phrasing. To put it simply: it's like breaking your solos into sections, not just constant playing.\n* Silence/holding a note can be 100x more effective than constant notes.\n\nHope this helps somehow and I didn't just do a nonsensical rant!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296528513", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First things I teach:\n\n1) Learn the names of the parts of the guitar - head, neck, body, frets, tuning pegs, nut, bridge etc. This helps give you confidence as well as being useful.\n\n2) Learn the fret numbers, how to find the 1st fret, 5th fret, 9th fret etc. You would be surprised at how many guitarists cannot find their 8th fret when asked.\n\n3) Learn the names of your strings - E A D G B E. You should know these like you know your own birthday. Test yourself. Make up a mnemonic to remember them. Again, I encounter guitarists whom have played for years that aren't sure which string is their B string when asked. Don't be like them.\n\n4) Posture and how to sit with the guitar. Sit upright but relaxed. Relax your shoulders, don't hunch. Tilt the guitar slightly back towards your body so that you can see the fretboard. Don't support the neck with your fretting hand/arm.\n\n5) Where to place your finger for the note to sound the best. Place it as near to the metal of the fret as possible without touching the metal fret. Experiment as to what happens when you don't do this. Use the tip of your finger when making a note, place it as if you were placing a foot on its tip-toe.\n\n6) How much pressure to apply with your finger to get a good note. You don't need to press very hard at all. Experiment with no pressure at the start and keep applying pressure until you get a good solid note. Notice how little pressure you need to apply. Listen to what happens when you apply too much pressure.\n\n7) Right hand - practise playing with your thumb (or use a plectrum but you may find it easier to use your thumb in the beginning) by simply picking regular downstrokes on one string. 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4. Try and be regular and accurate. Try on all 6 strings.\n\n8) Practise going down the strings using the right hand, pick the E string, then the A then the D etc. down to the top E. \n\n9) Practise exercise - Start by putting your first finger on the 3rd fret of the top (thinnest) E string. Then put your 2nd finger on the 4th fret whilst taking your 1st finger off. Then put your 3rd finger on the 5th fret whilst removing the 2nd finger. You are aiming for a clean transition from note to note. Now do the same in reverse (5th fret to 4th fret to 3rd fret). Keep the sound clean, without breaks or duff notes. Don't worry about your 4th finger at this point.\n\n10) Play a very simple 12 bar blues. I have tab I can send you if you like. It's 4 notes per bar and you only play 2 different notes per bar and much of it is repeated. At this stage you are simply aiming to play notes that are in time and that sound good.\n\nThese 10 things will give you a great foundation. \n\nBy following these steps, I have heard my pupils make a very pleasant (albeit simple) sound after only an hour of picking up a guitar.

The L4.verified project used Isabelle verify memory protection (google \"Verified Protection Model of the seL4 Microkernel\"). According to Wikipedia's [Isabelle page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_%28theorem_prover%29), this work required 200 KLOC of Isabelle scripting. Since they were verifying the C code's implementation, they had to do a lot of work manually. What impresses me about the Verve work is that they built the appropriate type system abstractions, even at the assembly level, to make running the type check much simpler. This means that they can change the design without having to manually redo the proof.\n\n&gt;yes, there is the halting theorem, but in practice it's possible to prove that many programs - many interesting ones even - do halt.\n\nAs you stated before, this requires restricting the language. \n\n&gt;A good example of some neat formally verified components and stuff they've done can be found under their fine project, and Fine ranges all the way from a dependently typed .NET bytecode, to the language itself which uses refinement types (they let you say things like \"x has the type string, but that string is 'hello'\" and if you try to put \"goodbye\" inside x, you get a compiler error, i.e. you refine the type of x to specify it can only contain 'hello.') There's also their FX tool in there that turns mutable programs into pure functional ones for verification via SMT solvers and refinement types. Lots of good stuff: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fine/\n\nThis looks like some very interesting work. I was not aware of the Fine project.\n\n&gt;Microsoft deserves much praise for putting so much work into programming language research, if you ask me.\n\nAbsolutely agreed. I just hope it can translate into their products. PL work tends to get stuck in the well-developed research phase without making it into actual deployments, while widely used languages get designed by [committees](http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html) or [BDFLs](http://www.python.org/~guido/).\n\n&gt;xmonad is a wonderful and beautiful example of pragmatic haskell - it's a full, very stable window manager and it is a little over 1000 lines of code, while still being very extensible in nature (and allowing features like on-the-fly config file reloads, etc.)\n\nI downloaded the tarball and the first thing I saw was the @galois addy. Those people know their shit and this code is nicely done as a Haskell system. However, after scanning the code, I don't think this is something that a typical BS in CS can just pick up and play with without having a fairly significant amount of training.\n\nFor example:\n\n    focusWindow :: (Eq s, Eq a, Eq i) =&gt; a -&gt; StackSet i l a s sd -&gt; StackSet i l a s sd\n    focusWindow w s | Just w == peek s = s\n                    | otherwise        = maybe s id $ do\n                        n &lt;- findTag w s\n                        return $ until ((Just w ==) . peek) focusUp (view n s)\n\nThis small function requires people to understand Maybe, which to properly understand what this code is doing, they really need to understand [this stuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29#Axioms). You might argue that a Haskell programmer doesn't need to understand the math to use Maybe, but that just means that they will think of it as black magic and won't really understand how to use it appropriately. The Galois guy certainly understood Maybe before he wrote this code. I have serious doubts that an average programmer could figure this code out. It also requires the programmer to understand language features that are not common elsewhere (e.g. guards, Haskell classes, do, return, etc.). I hate to say it, but this particular function is trivial even in C (it would be a small loop with two function calls). Haskell seems to just add unnecessary complexity here to maintain purity. As you said, this isn't the super-advanced stuff (I had the honor of playing with some of SPJ's techniques in a class on generic programming, so I've had some experience in the area), but it still is going to confuse the hell out of most people, which was my main point above.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1296742352", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In order that they're written those notes are G G A G. The order of the notes- C D E F G A B C- continues above the horizontal lines of the musical staff. The second, third, and fourth notes- the ones with a big \"3\" underneath them- are played in a different rhythm than the notes without numbers under them. They're called \"triplets\". Three of these notes are played in the same amount of time as two of the type of notes before or after it. Those notes- the ones with a single horizontal line connecting them- are called eighth notes. The triplet notes would have to be connected using a redstone arrangement that was different than the eighth notes, producing a different rhythm. It's hard to explain the difference in rhythm between eighth notes and triplets without being able to play the music as a reference. Anyway, you can totally play those notes on Minecraft music blocks. Music blocks have a range of tones that covers all the notes in two octaves. An octave is when you go through all the notes- C D E F G A B- and then come to C again. The difference in pitch between the first C, down low, and the next C in the sequence is called an octave. \n\nI'm not sure how much of a music lesson I can give you by posting on Reddit, but there are plenty of crafty musicians around to help, and I'm sure if you keep at it for a while you'll get good at using note blocks. Let me know if anything I've told you makes sense. I think messing around with note blocks and redstone in Minecraft would be a fantastic introduction to learning music.

The three papers referenced below all use some variants of these strategies (if i remember correctly, its been a while).\n\nIn my bachelor thesis we used the latter as our species could not maintain plasmids and was recA+. What you basically do is select a locus to insert it into. We selected a gene that might divert carbon away from our pathway, but there could be a point in doing it in a neutral site then you simply construct a plasmid that looks like this:\n\nHomologous recombination site 1 | promoter | gene1| ..| gene n| terminator| HR 2\n\nWhere the homologous recombination sites is simply to halves of the selected gene we wanted to insert into.\nThis will give you a polycistronic expression system, and this can all be constructed with clever use of PCR and restriction enzymes, nothing fancy.\n\nThere is a lot of room for optimization in these expression things. \nOne thing in particular, now that we are talking about space, that i've always wondered about is the feasibility of knocking out the KaiA/B/C system, the circadian clock that (most?) cyanobacteria sport.\nWhen it is dark on the bacterias subjective night, storage hydrocarbons is produced which would seem to be a waste of carbon flux in a constant daylight environment. I have never been able to find any studies on whether circadian clock activity changes in lab strains that grow in constant light though so it is kind of speculative.\n\nSorry for the poor formatting\n\nHenrike Niederholtmeyer, Bernd T.

{"body": "The main thing that you should know is how the modes relate to different chords. If you play all the chords that are native to a (major) key you have the I IV and V chords are major (the 5 being dominant), the ii iii and vi are minor, the vii is half diminished. \n\nNow if you think about the modes: a lydian is the native chord scale for the IV chord; in the key of c major your IV chord is an F major, and your chord-scale is F lydian. \n\nThis is where the context of the chord is important, if you don't know that the F major is the four chord, you might assume it is the one chord and play F ionian, or assume it is the five chord and play F mixolydian.  \n\nThe notes that distinguish F lydian from F ionian is the #4, so instead of F G A Bb C D E you have F G A B C D E which is the same thing as the C major scale starting on the fourth note.\n\nThe same concept applies for the other degrees of the scale. The way I see it, the modes are just a name for something you would otherwise intuit if you spent enough time figuring out the way melodies fit over chord progressions. As long as all the chords are in the same key (like most pop music), you don't have to even really worry about the modes since all the chord scales that you use will have the same notes in them. The only thing at that point that you need to pay attention to is which notes sound better than others over that chord.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1297125658", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

ANUS was completely wrong and so were we. But he was right at least that the structure is somewhat similar to rock. Maybe he just heard it in his bones and bullshitted some music theory to justify his vague impressions? \n\nI think this article is a bit confused to be honest. They seem to be saying \"this style sucks, but it's okay when a band we like does it (though we still think it's incompatible with the \"pure\" metal), otherwise it's hipster trash\".

Has your mom taught you any other tricks with chocolate sauce that you'd like to show us?\n\nSee? This is why I am not Forever Alone. You don't have to be Forever Alone. It's simple - don't scare away the cute ones and then over-react to the ones with especially vulnerable self-esteem. That's creepy to pump up girls way past what they are comfortable with/expecting and then knock girls like mysfiction04 down a few pegs.\n\nEDIT: And I don't care how far this gets downvoted as long as one or two of you people see it. **I N C E P T I O N**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1297592010", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's what I went through in Music Theory 1 in college:\n\n1. Staves (plural of Staff) – Where the notes are located, what the bars mean, you should at least know the treble and bass clefs by heart; tenor/alto/soprano/etc aren't as important yet and are easier because they give you the location of middle C. Knowing what ledger lines are. Writing: Knowing how to form the clefs properly.\n\n1. Notes – C D E F G A B C, naturals, sharps, flats, double sharps, double flats, enharmonics (E# = F, B# = C, etc.). Understanding that enharmonic notes are not functionally equivalent (in other words, E# and F produce the same sound, but have different purposes in songs, which is why you don't \"simplify\" E# to F in music). Writing: knowing when to place the stems of notes up or down. Knowing the numbering of the octaves (C vs. c' for example). Knowing where to find middle C (c') on a piano.\n\n2. Scales – Major scales first (worry about minor scales later). Memorizing the order of sharps and flats in relation to each key(Sharps: \"Fred Can Go Down And Eat Breakfast\", Flats: \"BEADGCF\") and being able to recreate any scale by memory. Writing: Being able to properly write key signatures (with the sharps/flats on the proper lines). Knowing the functional names. In C major: C = tonic, D = supertonic, E = mediant, F = subdominant, G = dominant, A = submediant, Bflat = subtonic B = leading tone. For example, in C major, the \"major third\" from C is E natural.\n\n3. Rhythm – Knowing the basic notes and rests (quarter note, half note, whole note, etc.). Knowing what ties are. Knowing what dotted notes and rests mean. Knowing simple time signatures (as opposed to compound time signatures like 6/8; learn those later) like 4/4, 3/4, 2/2. The top is the number of beats per measure and the bottom is the note that gets the beat (4 = quarter note, 2 = half note). Knowing what \"common time\" (4/4) and \"cut time\" (2/2) are. Understanding what a \"measure\" is. Understanding the relationship between tempo and time signature (2/2 is twice as fast as the same song in 4/4). Definition of/how to find a downbeat (4/4 has downbeats on 1 and 3, 3/4 has a downbeat on 1). Writing: how to write time signatures, how to properly separate a song fragment into measures. Ear training: Differentiating note length; being able to transcribe a rhythm to a staff using proper notation. Identifying time signatures.\n\n4. Intervals – The distance between two notes on the major scale. Understanding major, minor, and perfect intervals. Writing: being able to write a tonic and its proper interval, both higher than and lower than the tonic (for example, the interval of the dominant note below C is actually a perfect forth below C, rather than a perfect fifth as would be the case if you were ascending the scale). Ear training: Learning what intervals sound like. You should at least be able to identify major, minor, and perfect intervals, especially perfect fifths, perfect octaves, perfect fourths, and major thirds. Start by listening for consonance vs. dissonance, then refine your skills to pick out specific intervals.\n\n5. Chords – Don't start out worrying yourself with 7th chords (chords with four different notes in them). Focus only on triads and stay within a given scale. Learn what a triad is and how to build chords. Learn about chords in first and second inversion. Study the basics of basso continuo so that you understand figured bass chord notation, as this will become important in functional analysis. Writing: you should be able to take a root note on the staff and a figured bass marking and form a triad with it. Learning roman numeral notation. Ear training: you should be able to distinguish major chords from minor in root position, first inversion, and second inversion.\n\n6. Basic tonal functionality – You should learn how notes \"resolve\" when forming melodies; supertonic and mediant resolve downward to the tonic, subdominant and submediant resolve to the dominant, leading tone resolves upward to the tonic. Learning this well will help you form chord progressions.\n\n7. Chord progressions – Learning the Circle of Fifths chord progression (pretty sure it goes something like I-iii-vi-ii-V-I) and why it works, learning the different types of cadences. Ear training: you should know how what an authentic cadence sounds like vs. a plagal cadence, being able to identify a deceptive cadence.\n\n8. Basic four part harmony – Learning how to write music for Solo, Alto, Tenor, and Bass parts at one time, avoiding parallel fifths and octaves as well as direct octaves, making sure that the parts stay within vocal range and that two parts do not span more than an octave apart.\n\n9. Piano – We were required to learn how to play the piano. This is an invaluable tool for you to understand music theory as all notes are readily available. You should learn proper hand positioning technique as well as how to play with both hands simultaneously.\n\n10. Voicing – We were required to learn solfege (do-re-mi) and to sing melodies from written music. This is also a pretty useful tool for when you're writing music and have a melody in your head. It makes transcribing infinitely easier. We also had to voice rhythms using \"ta\" as a quarter note. I've had one instructor use \"ti\" for eighth notes and \"tiki\" for sixteenth notes. Either way, it's a useful tool for learning how to transcribe rhythms.\n\nI'm sure there was a lot more, but that's mostly what I can think of. Good luck! It's fun once you get past the initial hurdles, i promise!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1297710939", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yea I couldn't work out where the \"linearly increasing amount of staff working indefinitely for each individual purchase\" thing came from, but just figured it out. I turned all cylinders and circles into cuboids and squares, but since we're just talking about order of functions, it shouldn't matter. \n\nBottomless pitcher: Say the pitcher has a x b cross-section and you have to finish d depth of it before you get a refill (or maybe it's continuous, but you can only drink that fast, it doesn't matter). Then they just need a constant amount of staff that can churn out a x b x d of beer over a reasonable amount of time.\n\nCircumferenceless nachos: Say the place is a square that starts of 1 x 1. Then you finish it and the square gets extended to 2 x 2 (except the eaten 1 x 1 portion remained empty). Then you finish that and it becomes a 3 x 3 square, where the 2 x 2 centre is now empty. Sounds like a circumferenceless nacho plate to me (albeit square..). Anyway, each time you finish a serving of nachos, the establishment has to add\n\nn^2 - (n - 1)^2  = 2n - 1 of nachos to the plate.\n\nSo there's the linear scaling, but I just realized as I wrote this... that it still means that the customers would have to be eating at a linearly increasing rate.. argh.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1297829151", "subreddit": "math", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think this is pretty neat. You found a map from the diatonic scale onto itself, with two interesting properties: (1)  It's a bijection - that is, for any scale note x mapping to scale note y, y also maps to x. (2) It yields the chord mappings you mentioned. (eg: C-&gt;E, E-&gt;C, G-&gt;A, therefore CEG-&gt;ECA).\n\n(2) guarantees that any melody note that was a chord tone in the original tune is also a chord tone in the new tune - this combined with the fact that i-v-iv-i has (eh...) similar harmonic movement to I-IV-V-I has the most to do with why this works.\n\nI'm not sure if property (1) really has anything to do with why the transformation works. Will have to tinker when I'm home. It does, however, have to do with the \"rainbow\" rendering of the map. But I don't know if I'd make too much of that.

{"body": "I was really interested in this so later I compared it to some other mappings that would produce Aeolian harmony. (Neither of the ones I tried are bijective like yours)\n\n First, the trivial map: (c-&gt;a, d-&gt;b, e-&gt;c, f-&gt;d, g-&gt;e, a-&gt;f, b-&gt;g) Notice that this yields I-&gt;i, IV-&gt;iv, and V-&gt;v. So this mapping works similarly to your example in that it preserves chord tones and harmonic function. It also has a similar melodic contour to the original tune, and the melody is aeolian.\n\nAnother, more bizarre mapping: (c-&gt;a, d-&gt;g, e-&gt;c, f-&gt;f, g-&gt;e, a-&gt;d, b-&gt;b) Again this yields chord mappings I-&gt;i, IV-&gt;iv, and V-&gt;v. So again, harmonic function and chord tones are preserved. The melody is again aeolian, but the contour is now out of whack. So, while this one was fun, it's perhaps less recognizable as being related to the original tune. This led me to appreciate something interesting about your rainbow map that I hadn't thought of before: \n\nIf you consider my earlier example of a step-wise rendering of the rainbow map (notes ordered A B C D E F G) you'll notice that the distance from each scale note to D is the same as that of its corresponding pair note from the rainbow map. Thus, the melodic contour is preserved, but as a *reflection* about an axis through the note D. (Tedius picked up on this first).\n\nIt's also pretty neat that, as housesnickleviper pointed out, the melody that results from the rainbow map is really phrygian, though the chord progression is aeolian. But then I just think that this is just a quirk of the map and doesn't really have to do with *why* it works.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1297919496", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Walker manufactured a crisis when in fact there has been the same shortfall for years. The last Governor, a democrat, to make true progress with the budget was Tony Earl in the 80s. And he didn't do it on the backs of other people.\n\nBut some people, as yourselves, would happily see Wisconsin race to the bottom and join other red states in their education. I doubt you even live here.\n\nWhat I'm commenting on is that if Walker wanted to balance the budget, then fucking do that. Don't trojan horse some cowboy move like he did. He could have propose a budget bill that did just that. But he didn't do that. Instead he'd like to roll the clock back to the 30s.\n\nSo far no one had checked this guy's little tirade and when someone finally does, *they* are somehow the cowards.

Among modern commentators and textual critics, it is a foregone conclusion that the section is not original but represents a later addition to the text of the Gospel. B. M. Metzger summarizes: “the evidence for the non-Johannine origin of the pericope of the adulteress is overwhelming” (TCGNT 187). External evidence is as follows. For the omission of 7:53-8:11: Ì66,75 א B L N T W Δ Θ Ψ 0141 0211 33 565 1241 1424* 2768 al. In addition codices A and C are defective in this part of John, but it appears that neither contained the pericope because careful measurement shows that there would not have been enough space on the missing pages to include the pericope 7:53-8:11 along with the rest of the text. \n\nAgain, quoting from biblical scholars, the evidence that this passage is not original is \"overwhelming\".

Wel, even as she confessed to some details of the affair, she kept on lying.  Every single thing she initially said, she lied about, then backpedaled and corrected.  People with remorse at least pour their hearts out and admit to everything, even volunteer information.  She did not.\n- She is trying to blame *you* -- yes, **you** -- for the deliberate decision *she* made to spread her cunt wide open so that your neighbor could penetrate her.  How shitty is that?  Did you put a gun to her temple to have her do that?  No.  Did you at some point rescind the vows you made when you got together for real?  No.  Does she have any argument for mapping her actions to yours?  No.  Can you really envision her sitting down one day and thinking \"My husband is a piece of shit, *t h e r e f o r e, instead of talking to him or at least divorcing him, I am going to spread my legs so my cunt can consume every drop of the juice from the penis of my neighbor*\"?  **Obviously not**.

She was fucking the man that she was calling \"a piece of shit\" to her own wife's ears.  Can you imagine the level of evil and deceitfulness it requires to plan and deliberately do this, *while lying to your face too*?  It's terrible.\n\nSo, do you really see yourself together with this sick and disgusting human being?  Is this the type of person you want to associate with?  Or can you repair your life in the context of *healthy* human beings?\n\nI would not continue if I were you.  Don't feel guilty.

{"body": "A 6x5 layout like Fitaly is indeed a much better layout for one-finger use because it is closer to a square than 7x4 or 10x3 layout but I had to make my own for a number of reasons.\n\n* Fitaly is not freely available and I wanted to release Optimus free (as in beer and speech) for anyone to adopt for their own. This alone was reason enough for me to go through this the entire experiment.\n\n* While Fitaly was made with the intention of reducing typing distance, I don't think it is the most optimal layout for my users. Fitaly uses letter-pair frequency based on the [Brown Corpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus) and put the most frequently used characters in the middle. I used letter-pair frequency, compiled from 9 million Tweets because I feel my users will most likely type informally like in a chat instead of formally like in newspaper articles.\n\n* Fitaly is 6x5 and wouldn't fit my [iPad app layout](http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20110204#keyboard_in_use) as nicely as 7x4 would. In the landscape iPad mode, need some vertical space for showing the text already typed and suggesting autocomplete words/phrases.\n\n* I realize that putting multiple space bars in the middle of the keyboard is a very useful thing but I assume my users will make a lot of typing errors due to unstable movements and lack of control. As a result, I want them to avoid hitting the space and back-space keys as much as possible. I can account for unnecessary letters in code but unintentional space characters would be significantly more complex to deal with.\n\nI just ran Fitaly through my code to see how well it compares against Optimus. It does a very good job though it is not the most optimal layout I could find:\n\n    Score: 144907249668: Fitaly\n      Z V C H W K\n      F I T A L Y\n      _ _ N E _ _\n      G D O R S B\n      Q J U M P X\n\n    Score: 138246202149: Optimized Fixed Space Bars 6x5\n      J F L D G Z\n      P U O I N K\n      _ _ S T _ _\n      B R E A H C\n      Q V M Y W X\n\n    Score: 128279365677: Random Grid 6x5\n      Z P L D Q _\n      K S I N G _\n      C A T O U J\n      W H E R F _\n      X V M Y B _\n\nOptimized Fixed Space Bars 6x5 is better than Fitaly though not significantly. The different is most probably because the dataset Fitaly used to build its letter-pair frequency table is different from KType's Twitter data.\n\nI will try to get in touch with Fitaly's designers to see if they will allow me to provide a Fitaly layout option in KType. Swype is indeed a whole different ball-game and I highly doubt my users will have the dexterity to swipe correctly from one key to another, regardless of the layout.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1298916062", "subreddit": "compsci", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
