But just because something CAN be abused doesn't mean it's inherently wrong. \n\nThe process of righting a great wrong or pulling an oppressed population out of oppression is never linear, and the oppressed aren't perfect, just like the oppressors aren't.

A massive wrong like racism will always produce offshoots of bullshit like the abuse of the race card--it's the nature of the thing. But just like a wound itches like hell when it's healing, we should expect to have to endure ancillary problems like this on the road to reconciliation. \n\nIn my humble opinion, I think as I white person I have a responsibility to put up with more bullshit from blacks than from whites because of what my ancestors did to theirs. Not a blind eye turned to black problems or patronizing, bleeding-heart treatment for those poor adorable little black folks, but an extra measure of resolve not to blame the victims, along with a realization that the extreme poverty and lack of opportunity we handed them has far-reaching consequences--including a bitterness and anger towards white people that is at least somewhat justified.

{"body": "I just posted something very similar in another thread, please pardon the redundancy...\n\nBut set theory absolutely applies to music from early modal to late harmonic eras.  Here's a rudimentary example:\n\nIn mod12, integer 5 is equivalent under inversion (or reflection or rotation) to 7.  Read: a perfect fourth up is the same as a perfect fifth down (assuming octave equivalence).\n\nAlso, use the integer 7 to generate a set, mod12 | 0 7 2 9 4 11 6 | Now assign each integer to a pitch - | C G D A E B F# | you see the beginning of the circle of fifths, and the major scale as a pitch class set generated by an interval that is prime in relation to the modulo (7 and 12 share no common divisors).\n\nIt can also provide a model for African polyrhythms, substituting beat class for pitch class.  | 0 7 2 9 4 11 6 | reordered sequentially is | 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 |, which is C major, and a bell pattern common in much of African (esp. Ghanian and Afro-Cuban) music.\n\nbreaking the routine from mod12 and going to mod8 or mod16, but using prime generation to create sets, results in polyrhythms found in Balinese gamelan music.\n\ntl; dr - Music theory that points to structures we almost universally use without thinking... is deep stuff.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1299311606", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Bill Evans deciding to build the chords in 4ths is a stroke of genius, because he can play every note in the mode without having to change voicing.  \n\nBill Evans' voicing of d dorian (aka minor):\n\n    chord 1: e a d g b   (em7 11 - e g a b d) \n    chord 2: d g c f a   (dm7 11- d f g a c)\n    d dorian: d e f g a b c\n\nHe's really treating each mode as an eight note chord.  The oscillations between the higher voiced chord and the lower ones give the piece some harmonic motion but there's no harmonic *function* involved.  I mean, what could we call that motion?  v7/V - i7?  v7/v - i7?  There's no dominant-tonic relationship at all.  That's not to say it doesn't go anywhere, just that the traditional implications of the term \"chord\" start to lose meaning.\n\nA reason for this is that the m7 11 (or m7 add4) chord is symmetrical in the close position.  Like the other symmetrical chord, the full diminished 7 - they're tonally ambiguous when played in series.  But unlike the full diminished, the m7 11 can be voiced with a close interval on top, which gives it some impetus for motion.  So I don't think we could properly call the em7 11 - dm7 11 motion harmonically driven rather than melodically driven.\n\n**tl;dr:** mostly passing tones, yo\n\n**edit:** also Miles only wrote Dm7 and Ebm7.

{"body": "There are many different guitar styles out there! Strumming chords is simply one way of playing and what you stumbled upon is slightly different - finger style playing. You could also achieve the same effect with using a pick - by picking them one note at a time (like in a melodic line). Some people use their fingers, some use a pick, some use a thumb-pick so they can have the flexibility of both, some grow out their nails to get the sound of a pick when using each finger...\n\nUsing all 3 fingers in a picking pattern is something that many styles use - notably, [classical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ9jrBg4Lwc) and [flamenco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CjLfu9zCk) guitarists.\n\nAs you can see, there are many different 'patterns' ... actually, a pattern is what you start with... eventually you will learn to apply different orderings of the notes to create different rhythmic and melodic effects, once you get better. (for instance, check out [tremolo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3hkO4rRdA) - when you pick the same note very quickly in succession).\n\nIdeally, you want to teach your left and right hands to work independently - so your picking hand does whatever picking pattern you choose independently of your fret hand. I started with these patterns:\n\na = ring finger\nm = middle finger\ni = index finger\np = thumb\n\nlow(pitch) E string = 6, high(pitch) E string = 1.\n\nwhen written together, play simultaneously...\n\np a m p a m - 5 2 1 4 2 1\np m a p m a - 5 1 2 4 1 2\npa m pa m - 52 1 42 1\npm a pm a - 51 2 41 2\n\np a m i p a m i - 5 1 2 3 4 1 2 3\np i m a p i m a - 5 3 2 1 4 3 2 1\n\np a m i p a m i - 5 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 5 3 3 3 4 3 3 3\n\netc etc...\n\nTry making up your own, and playing them with a RELAXED right hand, to a metronome. Do it without fretting any chords first, to make sure you have the movement down. Make sure they are loud - but make the sound come from your finger, your wrist should be almost completely stationary. Move at your elbow as you go up and down the strings.\n\nFinally, a problem that I ran into and am still trying to fix - pay attention to your left hand while you do this. Many people press way too hard on the frets when they start doing picking patterns. Practice the chords switches and patterns separately, until you can do each very lightly. Then try to carefully combine them.\n\nGood luck!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1299383725", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Victoria.\n\nI was 12, she was 13, we met on a caravan holiday. We ran around the swings together playing tag with other kids but really we didn't care about them, we ran for each other and forgot the world around us.\n\nI held her hand and felt tingles all over, it was bliss. Her smile was the most beautiful thing i'd ever seen and i wanted to kiss her, but i didn't know how and mum shouted me to come in for dinner. A wry smile and a \"see you tonight\" was all i could muster.\n\nI thought about her all through dinner, how amazing she was, how beautiful, how her eyes shone when she looked at me. I was in love. I began to wonder how to kiss her, i'd heard about sex, she was older than me, had she had it? did she know what it was? what do i do?\n\nI didn't know, but it was our last night there and i had to tell her how i felt. In the movies its always amazing and they live happily ever after right?\n\nSo we go to the evenings entertainment and i can't find her, disheartened i return to my parents, mournful, they didn't understand lost love, how could they? But fate intervened, out of the corner of my eye i saw her sitting at the front listening to the children's entertainer.\n\nI run to her and sit next to her, her face was lit up as she saw me, that old tingle returned and i felt safe, she grasped my hand and i wasn't nervous anymore. This was it.\n\nSitting next to her i realised i hadn't thought about how i could tell her how i felt, how i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, i wanted to marry her, to have kids with her, to die old with her. Nothing could be more perfect. But the words escaped me.\n\nWe sat listening to the entertainer for a while, just being with her was enough for now. I decided that a quieter place would be best, somewhere alone to talk, i was going to kiss her, i just put my face on hers right? i hope she knows what to do then. I trust her.\n\nShe gets up and walks to the door to go outside, i follow, this is my moment, this is going to set up the rest of my life. My life starts here.\n\n\"OneLifeLiveIt! come here! we're going\"\n\n\"B b b b b but.....i need to tal.....\"\n\n\"We're going come on it's bedtime\"\n\n\"Nooooooooo Dad please!\"\n\nMy father picks me up, Victoria still grasping my hand as he pulls me away.\n\n\"Wave goodbye to Vicky then\"\n\nTears streaming down my eyes i slowly wave to my one true love, a look of sadness and confusion upon her face.\n\nWe left the next morning, i never saw her after that but i often thought of her. \n\nVictoria, you were beautiful.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1299637655", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;How is it not transphobia? It's specifically making fun of a trans person for being trans. It's denying their gender presentation by referring to them with a male name and pronouns. It calls them \"creepy\". It alludes to cis straight men's fears of being \"tricked\" by trans women. None of this would have been said about them if they weren't trans.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily making fun of him for being a trans person. That's down to intent, and it's not how I read it. Even if it was, then that *still* wouldn't make it transphobia, since it wouldn't mean that the author hates transgender people. Transgender people can be made fun of just like everyone else can be. Thinking that he looks creepy (before, in between or after) doesn't mean that one hates transgender people, and neither does joking about being \"tricked.\"\r\n\r\nAs for ones gender presentation; that's irrelevant to what ones sex is. Being factual is not transphobic.\r\n\r\n&gt;Why don't you explain why it's not transphobia, instead of telling trans people no one is going to take them seriously because they dared to point out prejudiced behavior? That's transphobia on top of transphobia, and you've willingly become a part of it.\r\n\r\nNo, that's not transphobia, either. This is what the problem is. You don't even have the *beginning* of a clue to understand what the word means. Like I already pointed out above it's not necessarily prejudiced behaviour. Prejudiced behaviour towards transgender people != hating transgender people.\r\n\r\nYou've phrased yourself in a manner that implies that I've said that no one is going to take transgender people seriously because we point out prejudiced behaviour. Even if your premise about it being prejudiced behaviour was true (I've yet to see anyone prove this), that's *still* not what I said. Now you're misconstruing what *I'm* saying. Take your time to read what I'm saying more carefully.\r\n\r\n&gt;That's transphobia on top of transphobia\r\n\r\n**T R A N S C E P T I O N**\r\n\r\nNo, but seriously, that's nonsense.\r\n\r\n&gt;Thanks for the comprehensive refutation. You really explained why intent makes everything better. Great answer.\r\n\r\nPointing out that your intent argument is irrelevant != saying that intent makes everything better. \"Better\" is a value judgement. There's no need to refute arguments that are irrelevant.\r\n\r\n&gt;\"Most sensible people\" is an assumption, not an argument. It suggests that if you do take offense to this, you aren't being \"sensible\". You have no grounds to make such an accusation because you haven't explained why it must be so \"sensible\" not to be offended by it. If most sensible people don't find it offensive, they might simply be ignorant of why it is offensive. And if you're going to use the claim that it's \"subjective\" as license to ignore anyone who says it's offensive, the rest of us can just as well choose to ignore anyone who says it isn't offensive.\r\n\r\nI never claimed that it was anything besides an assumption, but you're using similar \"arguments.\" Your entire premise about it being transphobic or prejudiced relies on your assumption of the author's intent, and you're also making assumptions in regards to how offensive it is or isn't (just like I did.)\r\n\r\n&gt;It suggests that if you do take offense to this, you aren't being \"sensible\". You have no grounds to make such an accusation because you haven't explained why it must be so \"sensible\" not to be offended by it.\r\n\r\nYes, that's what it implies. I think that anyone who takes offense by this, because of \"transphobia\" or \"bigotry\" is not only ridiculous, but also not sensible. Because that's not what the words mean, quite simply. Granted, it could have more to do with them not knowing what words mean, i.e., with their education.\r\n\r\n&gt;If most sensible people don't find it offensive, they might simply be ignorant of why it is offensive.\r\n\r\nNo. You see, here you're implying that there's an objective standard for what's offensive or not. There isn't. They might come to learn something new about it that would lead them to the opinion that it's offensive, but it holds no such inherent value, as things cannot be inherently offensive.\r\n\r\n&gt;And if you're going to use the claim that it's \"subjective\" as license to ignore anyone who says it's offensive, the rest of us can just as well choose to ignore anyone who says it isn't offensive.\r\n\r\nDefinitely. That's just my opinion. My main point is that it's not transphobia or bigotry.\r\n\r\n&gt;By the way, marginalizing minorities even further by hinting that they just find \"everything\" offensive, and so can't be taken seriously, is offensive as well.\r\n\r\nI didn't mean that transgender people find everything offensive, but that there are a lot of transgender people who seem to. I never linked that and them not being taken seriously in that statement, so that's a false conclusion to make.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't care about what's offensive. As an example, being gay is offensive to most religious people.\r\n\r\n&gt;Good faith can't be assumed when jokes at the expense of minorities are made in societies where prejudice against those minorities is pervasive and overwhelming. In such a situation, we do not have the luxury of assuming good faith because in most cases, it is not being made in good faith at all.\r\n\r\nI disagree. Regardless, I meant that you should assume good faith about them not being transphobic or bigoted. You yourself noted that people might not understand why it's offensive to some, so why jump to such a conclusion about their intents?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1299675465", "subreddit": "lgbt", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here’s my second attempt at a reply, after not saving and…you know the rest of the story.\n\nI’m a big fan of Tesla. Who could have ever imagined that if a individual takes possession of  this mineral, something that we labeled thusly, “copper,” found in the earth. Pound it into a long string. Pass it within something we can’t see, however; we call it a magnetic field and it surrounds something with m a g n e t i c qualities; it moves electrons in a certain direction. There after, I’ll skip the redundancy; we recreate the first 1/100 second of the big bang to observe it…men in a cold outer space find themselves being held in orbit, in place, by the magnetic field of the earth. There we find ourselves orbiting in a magnetic field, emitting from an archetype representative to a mother figure, mother earth.  Whereas we find ourselves made from the same material, including copper ;-) Tesla was onto something I suspect. Something that could had been huge!\n\nI like to think we are as fish in water. That we are washed in all types of energy that we are simply not able to detect at this moment. Consider we can see as far into outer space as our technology allows and as well into the inner unseen space equally well with the same limitations. Not restrictions.\n\nI consider this import when placing the idea of a thought as an energy being either transmitted or received.  These energy waves are emitting from within and without, vibrating, changing states (engineers remember, work is harnessed ALWAYS when it changes states) within our body, emotionally, physically, maybe our reality? Stress creates sickness, why not joy create health.\n\nIf a better model, than what I’ve gained from Tesla, shows up I may adopt this new stance. \n\nAnyhow, so if you have some supporting evidence stating that Tesla’s work was improvable, to my rigorous scientific approach, I’m with ya’.\n\nNo, I didn’t know he practiced Hinduism. \n\nAnd what does all this have to do with the occult?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300156022", "subreddit": "occult", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I like the overall concept and design, my only real suggestions could be considered nitpicking. \n\nFor starters, I think the font size for the video names and buttons within the sliding components might be a bit too large. I think it would look a lot better if you made it about 13-14px. Same goes for the Viewers/Duration/Name buttons.\n\nThe \"Are we missing a stream? Request it!\" text within the masthead might be hugging the right side a little too hard, it could use a slightly increased margin-right. Maybe even a little margin or padding between the \"Are we missing a stream?\" and \"Request it\" text.\n\nFor your scrollbars, it might be kind of neat instead of having the scroll up and down buttons sort of just disappear when the bar is at the top or bottom, if they gracefully faded out. I notice you're using jquery, so it's fairly easy with .fadeOut() or just .animate() the opacity.\n\nIt might look better if the main media component's top margin was a bit less, it looks off center in comparison to your slide out components. I'm a symmetry whore :(\n\nAlso, it looks like the space between your games component and the main media component is not the same as it is between the streams component and media component. I would center the main media component. I told you I was a symmetry whore..\n\nI think the subtitle within the masthead could be bumped up a couple pixels so it appeared to be sitting on the same baseline as the logo. \nS y m m e t r y . . \n\nWhen the sliding components aren't active, I notice it has a slight transparency. It might look cool if you kicked it down a little more and then faded in the transparency on the mouse over, instead of just having it pop. \n\nJust little things really, otherwise I think you have a very solid idea going on! \n=)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300160235", "subreddit": "design_critiques", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A lot of it comes down to this: \"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures. --Alan Perlis\"\n\nIn OO programs the things you can do with the data inside an object are limited to the methods that the object responds to. In functional programs the data is stored using general data structures, and you can work with that data using any functions written to operate on that data structure. This has two big benefits for program composition:\n\n- When you need to do something with a piece of data, there's a good chance that a function to do that already exists.\n\n- When you do need to write new code, it's often easy to generalize it to work with any data stored in the same data structure.\n\nFor example, in Clojure there's no need for the visitor pattern; just call one of the functions in [clojure.walk](http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.walk-api.html) on any tree structure.\n\nHere's a short RLE implementation which IMO shows how powerful function composition really is (taken from [Michael Fogus' blog](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/03/09/recursion-is-a-low-level-operation/)):\n\n    (def S '[a a a a b c c a a d e e e e])\n\n    (def pack (partial partition-by identity))\n\n    (pack S)\n    ;;=&gt; ((a a a a) (b) (c c) (a a) (d) (e e e e))\n\n    (def rle (comp (partial map (juxt count first)) pack))\n\n    (rle S)\n    ;=&gt; ([4 a] [1 b] [2 c] [2 a] [1 d] [4 e])\n\n    (def rld (partial mapcat (partial apply repeat)))\n\n    (-&gt; S rle rld)\n    ;;=&gt; (a a a a b c c a a d e e e e) \n    \nIt may look dense if you're new to Clojure (and no wonder, it's defining an encoding function, a decoding function, and a general-purpose utility in one short line each), but once you've learned the basic sequence functions code like this becomes very easy to read since it's just a combination of a couple of simple things you already know.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300201202", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's not a study, but a good write-up from Starting Strength about why deep squats are good for the knees:  \n\n&gt;Any squat that is not deep is a partial squat, and partial squats stress the knee and the quadriceps without stressing the glutes, the adductors, and the hamstrings. The hamstrings, groin muscles, and glutes perform their function in the squat when the hips are stretched to the point of full flexion, where they get tight — the deep squat position (fig. 2-3). The hamstring muscles, attached to the tibia and to the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, and the adductors, attached between the medial femur and various points on the medial pelvis, reach a full stretch at the very bottom of the squat, where the pelvis tilts forward with the torso, stretching the ends of the muscles apart. At this stretched position they provide a slight rebound out of the bottom, which will look like a \"bounce,\" and which you will l e a r n more about later. The tension of the stretch pulls the tibia backwards, the posterior direction, balancing the forward pulling force produced by the quadriceps, which pull from the front. The hamstrings finish their work, with help from the adductors and glutes, by straightening out, or \"extending,\" the hip.  \n\n&gt;In a partial squat, which fails to provide a full stretch for the hamstrings, most of the force against the tibia is upward and forward, from the quadriceps and their attachment to the front of the tibia below the knee. This produces an anterior shear, a forward directed sliding force, on the knee, with the tibia being pulled forward from the patellar tendon and without a balancing pull from the opposing hamstrings. This shearing force — and the resulting unbalanced strain on the prepatellar area — may be the biggest problem with partial squats. Many spectacular doses of tendinitis have been produced this way, with \"squats\" getting the blame.  \n\nNow it's your turn to back this up:  \n\n&gt;ATG squats are the BEST way to tear up your knees.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300296569", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First of all, don't be hard on yourself. Think of how far you have come in the relatively short amount of time that you have been playing. Often the greatest impediment to (seeing) improvement is ourselves. We seem to think that we are either stagnating or digressing even though we are still progressing, though our progression may appear less evident. \n\nChord construction is rather easy when you understand how it works. As long as you know the notes of a particular scale, you can easily figure out the notes of a chord. Take C major scale for example, comprised of C D E F G A B C. The C major chord consists of taking the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the scale and playing them together (known as a triad). From that you get C E G. As another example, a Suspended 4th replaces the third of a major triad. So you take the 1st, 4th, and 5th notes of the scale to get C F G and that gives you Csus4. \n\nOnce you know the notes of the chord, you can map it out on the guitar. You just need to learn which notes to add and where (there are ample resources available for that if you just google \"chord construction). \n\nInsofar as what you want to do next. Continue with lessons, first of all and explain to them what you are feeling. Secondly, what is it that you want to accomplish in your playing? Don't get bogged down in technique. I think Devin Townsend had a really valuable piece of advice when he said \"build enough technique so as to facilitate the ideas in your head. Anything beyond that is excess\". A song doesn't have to be technically challenging for it to be beautiful. \n\nThink of music like learning a language. The notes are the letters, the chords are the words. Music theory, in this sense, will expand your musical vocabulary by helping you to construct musical sentences. So any theory is beneficial and when you say \"which I feel I need to know\" sort of misses the point. Learn it because you want to, not because you think you have to. \n\nIn any case, improving your technique can only be achieved through practice. Learn songs, as you are doing. If parts are too hard, don't worry about it :) Come back to it later on and practice the parts that you can. There's no harm in attempting the hard parts though (that's how we improve!) just do it slowly and focus on what you are doing and don't worry if you can't get it perfectly. \n\nLastly, don't be so concerned with where you want to be in your playing. You will get to where you want to be eventually, so you may as well make the trip there as enjoyable as possible.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300416318", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

You can't really dial them down all that much and still get a good picture.\n\nIf you take just one slice it's N x C (1 chest X-ray), where N is the number of separate angular orientations used and then with M slices it's M x N X C in terms of dosage.  Typically N is ~10-20 and M depends on what they are trying to diagnose.  \n\nThe worst case is a \"full body scan\" where M is enough slices to do you from head to toe, which has a hellacious X-ray total dose.

{"body": "I suggest you learn about key-centers, triads, chords, and Roman Numeral Notation. Knowing these things really helps break down a progression to its essential elements while providing a more generic system of remembering the chords.\n\nFor instance, lets first look at the the notes in the triads in your progression. I won't presume to know what you know or not. If you have questions, then please ask!!\n \n    First, the triads:\n\n    Am = A C E\n    C  = C E G\n    G  = G B D\n    D  =  D F# A\n\nNow lets take *all* of those notes and pool them together into a general-use note-group:\n\n    A C E, C E G, G B D, D F# A\n\nLets eliminate the redundant notes and put the remaining notes in some kind of order:\n\n    A C E, ~~C~~ ~~E~~ G, ~~G~~ B D, ~~D~~ F# ~~A~~ (goddamn reddit strikethru. Let me get back to this)    \n\n    A C E G B D F#\n\nNotice that one pesky F#? According to the [Circle of 5ths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths) that suggests a \"key center\" of G Major. Lets re-arrange the note-pool and see how well it fits now:\n\n     G A B C D E F#\n\nPretty well. Fits perfectly in this instance. This is what we call a \"Diatonic Progression\" --only notes within a key-signature. Oftentimes there will be other notes that don't fit so well, but that is not important right now.\n\nThis does not mean that the tune is in the **key** of G Major, despite the fact that it has the same *key-signature* as G Major, but it does mean that one of the modes of G Major is a safe bet since all of the notes in this progression are \"diatonic\" to the key of G Major, and therefore its modes. You might ask \"What key is this progression in anyway?!\". The answer is \"A Dorian\"\n\n[I'll edit later, I have to leave for now]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300674280", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

I do not consider this an algorithm since it only involves one move\r\n\r\n* If oriented wrong, use B R 'F (Algorithm #1)\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Complete layer 1\r\n\r\n* Bring the corner below the spot where it needs to be\r\n\r\n* Use 'R 'B R B (Algorithm #2) until the corner is on the top layer oriented correctly. May need to use the algorithm up to 3 times to get it oriented right in the right spot\r\n\r\n\r\n**FLIP THE CUBE UPSIDE DOWN**\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Complete Layer 2\r\n\r\n* Chose a random face and rotate the top layer until you have, in the top layer, an edge with the right color for your front face, but the wrong color for the top face. If you can't find any such edge for any of the 4 side faces, chose a random face, do the following algorithm and search again. If you are interested in why this works, PM me, it's quite much to explain.\r\n\r\n* Depending on whether the edge belongs to the left slot in layer 2 or the right slot in layer 2 either use U R 'U 'R 'U 'F U F (right slot) or 'U 'L U L U F 'U 'F (left slot). These are Algorithm #3 (and #4 if you count mirrored algorithms as seperate)\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Build the cross on the top layer\r\n\r\n* Use F R U 'R 'U 'F (Algorithm #4) depending on what part of the cross you already have\r\n\r\n* If you have no part of the cross: Use it with a random face to front -&gt; use the algorithm -&gt; you get an L shape\r\n\r\n* If you have 2 parts of the cross L shaped: Make the L face left &amp; back (seen from top/front) -&gt; use the algorithm -&gt; you get a line\r\n\r\n* If you have 2 parts of the cross in a line: Make the line face from left to right -&gt; use the algorithm -&gt; you get the cross\r\n\r\n\r\n5) Permutate the top layer edges\r\n\r\n* Use R U R' U R U2 R' (Algorithm #5) depending on what edges you can align with the side faces. Rotate the top layer until one color aligns with a side face -&gt; check if a 2nd color aligns anywhere. If it doesn't, rotate and look again.\r\n\r\n* If 2 opposite side faces align correct -&gt; use the algorithm -&gt; front and right face will align\r\n\r\n* If 2 adjacent faces align correct -&gt; make them face back and right -&gt; use the algorithm -&gt; use and additional U -&gt; all faces align with top layer edges\r\n\r\n\r\n6) Permutate top layer corners\r\n\r\n* Use U R 'U 'L U 'R 'U L (Algorithm #6) depending on what corners are at the right place\r\n\r\n* If no corners are at their right place, do it with a random face facing front -&gt; use the algorithm -&gt; at least one corner will be at the right spot\r\n\r\n* If one corner is at the right place, turn the cube until it is on the front &amp; right corner in the top layer -&gt; use the algorithm until all corners are at the right place\r\n\r\n\r\n7) Orient the top layer corners\r\n\r\n* Use 'R 'B R B (Algorithm #2) on a corner that is not oriented right until it is oriented right in the right spot\r\n\r\n* ONLY ROTATE THE TOP LAYER to get another corner to the front &amp; right corner in the top layer\r\n\r\n* Use the algorithm again until that corner is solved -&gt; repeat for all corners that are not oriented right\r\n\r\n\r\n**CUBE SOLVED**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300696842", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So to prove something like x^m x^n = x^(m+n) just view it like x..m of them..x x...n of them...x = x...m + n of them...x. Another useful identity is ( x^a )^b = x^ab you can view that one like a rectangle e.g. ( x^5 )^3 = (xxxxx)^3 = xxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxx = x^15\n\n* simplifying expressions involving radicals and exponents\n\nNo idea what that means. Maybe things like sqrt(x)^2 = x, cuberoot(x^6) = x^2 All of these come from the rules if you just know that sqrt(x) = x^(1/2) and cuberoot(x) = x^(1/3) and so on.\n\n* working with variables\n\nJust treat them like numbers? If you have an equation X = Y then it is always the case for any function f that f(X)=f(Y). For example if you had the equation 7x+3 = 9x-2 then you use the function f(m) = m+2 to get 7x+5 = 9x then you could use the function g(h) = h-7x to get 5=2x. Of course nobody expects you to write out the function definition every time but it's useful to have the idea in mind.\n\n* factoring and distributing\n\nDistributivity says that (x+y)b = xb + yb (and similar for b(x+y) = bx + by). To see why this is true draw a rectangle with length x+y and width b, it has area (x+y)b. Cut into two so you have a rectangle with length x and width b + a rectangle with length y and width b.\n\nTo factor a number like 15 you just have to check, is it even? no, is it a multiple of 3? yes: 15/3 = 5 so 15 = 3*5.\n\n* solving simple linear and quadratic equations\n\nSolving a system of two linear equations (y=mx+c, y=nx+d) is quite simple, just eliminate y to get mx+c=nx+d then isolate x to get (m-n)x=d-c so x = (d-c)/(m-n).\n\nTo solve a quadratic equation you can either try to factor it (that is not always possible) or complete the square (which is always possible). Completing the square means turning a quadratic into (x+p)^2 + q. For an example of completing the square take x^2 + 6 x + 11, if you multiply out (x+p)^2 + q = x^2 + 2px + p^2 + q so we have 6 = 2p implying that p = 3. We also have 11 = 3^2 + q = 9 + q and 11-9=2 so x^2 + 6 x + 11 = (x+3)^2 + 2. This makes solving the equation easy because if (x+3)^2 + 2 = 0 then x = sqrt(-2) - 3.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1300763332", "subreddit": "math", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Even I managed to figure out a secret or two with my non-existent experience -_-;\n\nSo be excited! I sure am. BFDF got me hooked.

Now you have most offensive items, and we get more situational items:\r\n\r\nchoices are: Void staff if you just want to hurt them even more, abbysal scepter if they have alot of magic damage, Guardian angel if they have alot of physical damage, or zonyas hourglass if they have very low mobility, and you can stretch your ult 2 sec longer.\r\n\r\nsummoner spels: ghost and flash, to give you better escape+initiate capablities.\r\n\r\nrunes: magic pen reds, mana/level yellows, cd reduction blues and ap quints.\r\n\r\nskill order W E W Q W R W E W Q R E Q E Q R E Q\r\n\r\nJungling pattern: begin at golem, since you don't have smite, they probably won't be there to gank you. auto attack him 3 times, then start draining the golem. when drain ends, auto attack him, and use drain as soon as it is up. since you only have 8 armor, the golem does serious damage. after 3 drains and some auto attacks, he should be done. auto attack a lizard to death, and drain the other. take dark wind as second skill.\r\n\r\ngo to the wolves. use dark wind+drain on the big one, auto attack the smaller one that got hit by dark wind to death, and drain the other wolf.\r\n\r\nWraiths: dark wind+drain on the big one, auto attack the smaller wraith that got hit by dark wind to death, drain the 3rd and auto-attack the 4th. take drain as 3rd skill.\r\n\r\nBig Lizard: same as for the big golem, drain+auto attack him to death, kill all the small lizards with auto attacks.\r\n\r\nsmall golems: dark wind+drain on the first one, then drain the 2nd one, if they are still alive, red buffed auto attack will take care of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nmove to the enemy blue golem. refresh your blue buff with the same tactic. take fear as 4rd skill.\r\n\r\nTo do dragon, you need level 3 drain. try to get a gank on the lower lane, if the people in lane are a bit smart, and their opponents have no stuns, you will probably get a kill, or even 2. stay in lane till you have level 5.\r\n\r\nGo to dragon, and just drain him. try to get some red buffed auto attacks in between drains.\r\n\r\nmove to your own golem, since he will be close to respawning now. kill him to refresh your blue buff. you will now have level 6. try to get a gank on the top lane. drain a minion for hp once finished. proceed to mid lane for a gank, or, if you allready have enough money (about 1800 gold), recall and get mejais and a tear.\r\n\r\nFor your ganks, remember, Fiddlesticks is all about the element of surprise. if you are spotted during channeling your ultimate, you are done. try always to channel it while out of sight, or in a bush. if a enemy proceeds to facecheck the bush, channel your ulti in the bush, once he gets close, jump out of the bush, fear him, dark wind+drain, and see his hp plummit.\r\n\r\nIn later teamfights, try always to stay out of sight of the enemy, until either your tank engages, or you can channel your ult and not get immediately killed. if you cannot find such a position, you can always use flash to get extra range for your ultimate. once in, pop ghost for the movement speed. immediately use dark wind, fear someone and if you are sure of the kill, start draining. if you are going to die, use zonyas if you have it, or flash to get out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1301563851", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
