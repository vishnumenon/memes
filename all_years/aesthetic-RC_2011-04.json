The analysis was after the fact, though is very interesting.  \n\nIn the Gregorian times, you would always have one person singing first, and their intonation would set where C or F or D etc. was, and then everyone would come in from there.  So there was NO standardized intonation, but there was a sense of intervallic space, with the 7 important nodes do re mi fa sol la ti, better known as C D E F G A B.  The flats and sharps were introduced to account for the \"far out\" conceptions of the contemporaries, who would throw in a Bb(hinting at the key of F or Dm).  \n\nOnly after this rich culture of harmony, only until we started to standardize intonation did this \"discovery\" of all of the major scale coming from just intonation(intonation by harmonic series) occur.  Although, much was known about these intervals, pythagoreas tuned his hexachords in a tuning based on Perfect 5ths(3/2).  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1301718117", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "^This. Hanon has good finger exercises for once you fully comprehend music reading and need to start training your fingers specifically. Personally, I think the 'Alfred's Basic Piano Library' series of books, three consecutive volumes for adults, is a great resource of music for the novice pianist. It starts out familiarizing the student with reading music, counting time, then begins getting more complicated with fingering and syncopation and otherwise strange/hard stuff. \n\n\nAll the while if you can study keys this is crucial to actually being fluent in the piano. I'm not personally especially disciplined in this manner, but I **know** that if you apply yourself and consider theory thoroughly and examine every song you learn you will learn far faster, though this requires much dedication and daily repetition, like learning a language.\n\n\nReading music can take some time to fully understand, and counting in your head is crucial, but once you can do both at a decent speed you should be able to break lots of songs into smaller segments and slowly learn whole complex pieces. Try to find if the keyboard has a metronome feature.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo clarify what a key is: A key is 7 related notes, for example C Major is C D E F G A B, pretty simple. You need an understanding of chords. Like a basic three note chord in that key is C E G.

{"body": "That's the notation for chord progressions. It's kind of a long explanation, and I'll probably go over stuff you already know, but basically, so you know how a scale is 8 notes? \n\nFor example, the C major scale is C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C\n\nIt can also be thought of as just scale degrees, 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8\n\nThat way, it can be used to talk about just any major scale generally, any pattern of notes that fits this: W W H W W W H, where W is a whole step between notes and H is a half step. So 1 W 2 W 3 H 4 W 5 W 6 W 7 H 8, or going back to the C major scale, it's a whole step from C to D and D to E, a half step from E to F, then whole steps between F-G, G-A, and A-B, and another half step from B to C.\n\nIn the same way, we can talk about chords in this nonspecific way. A major triad chord built off the first note of the scale, 1, would be the notes 1, 3, and 5. So for C major, the C major triad chord is C, E, and G. People don't normally write out the \"triad\" part of the name, but I've included it to show how it's 3 notes. When you're talking about a chord built from the 1st note of the scale, you refer to it with a capitol roman numeral I.\n\nIn this way you can build distinct chords from the each of the notes of the scale. For example, building the triad from the 2nd note of the C Major scale, D, would be D, F, and A. This is actually a minor chord, so it's referred to with a lowercase roman number ii. If you keep on going like this, you get a pattern of major and minor chords that goes like this: I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii^o\n\nSo when I say I - IV -V, it means a series of chords built from the first, fourth, and fifth notes of the scale respectively. For C Major, that would be C Major, F Major, and G Major. It's really easy to make a catchy song with these three chords, the I, IV, and V, in any key.\n\nSo for a G Major scale, G - A - B - C - D - E - F# - G, the I chord is G Major, the IV chord is C Major, and the V chord is D Major.\n\nFor the A Major scale, A - B - C# - D - E - F# - G# - A, they'd be A Major, D Major, and E Major.\n\nI - IV - V is just easy to remember and widely used, so it's always good to be able to identify the 1, 4, and 5 notes of a scale. The reason I say those are good combinations of chords to learn is simply because they're so ubiquitous that they'll come in handy for playing an awful lot of songs.\n\nThe Circle of Fifths is also a great, easy way to figure out good sounding I - IV - V combinations, wikipedia has a good article on it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1301891333", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I dont see anyone saying anything about AP ezreal. I'll have you know that I used to play AP ez back in the day when he actually had a heal and was pretty much the strongest thing in the game. I have about 400 games as ap ez maybe?\r\n\r\nAnyway I go 9/0/21\r\n skill order goes as follows for 1-6, q w w e w r\r\nmax out w first then e second. Leaving q at rank one lets you keep your passive stacks at 5 and last hit easier with barely any mana cost. \r\n\r\nFor runes I run magic pen red, mana regen/level yellow, and cdr blues. For quints I go 2 mpen and 1 flat ap. Why? bc sorc boots + the 10 mpen from the runes this way is 30. Which is the base mr for a lot of people.\r\n\r\nThere is a trick when playing ap ez in the laning phase. What you have to realize is his w does a bit longer then the blue arrow shows. It can end right before them and it will still hit them regardless. So try and get a feel for this max range and sit at that length from the enemy champ as you last hit. They wont think twice about it be the distance seems to far for you to actually hit them. \r\n\r\nFor summoner spells i run flash ghost. The thing with flash is you gotta save it for when you f yourself by e'ing on top of someone to only to get counterganked. \r\n\r\nAP build goes lvl 1 saph crystal and 2 hpots. Go buy when you have enough for lvl 1 boots and catalyst. Now build ROA, sorc boots then lichbane, Q will proc the lichbane meaning even as AP your Q on a 1.5 sec cd will do 500-700 damage. After LB go DCAP then what you need from there. Survivability or more ap. \r\n\r\nFinal Note even though AP ez is extremely rare these days it is still very viable. Check my match history, I won 3 in a row the other day as ap ez. My name is Chiapet, you can add me to talk about him if you want. I played him soooo much :) haha", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1302021409", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Internet goes into full swing using Xzibit as a joke concerning anything recursive in nature, such as \"Yo dawg, we put an attic in your attic, so you can hide while you hide [Anne Frank joke]\".\n\nSo while that's happening, and in reality, a while after the joke was popular, the film Inception released. The film became popular for its visual effects and plot featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, and a team of agents tasked to implant a thought into the mind of the client's leading competitor's mind, a technique called 'inception', by entering their dream, but having to create dreams within dreams to keep the victim from thinking it was possible someone had gotten into their mind, and left to think it was really their own idea. This movie sparked a ceries of jokes, similar to Xzibit jokes, but that people would say \"**I N C E P T I O N**\", or something similarly worded when something recursive was brought up, such as saying \"**I N C E S T I O N**\" when talking about Adam and Eve or something.\n\nSo, what we have here finally, is the bastard child to these two jokes.

See what topics and styles of questions are popping up more.\n3. If you talk to the TA about the course and the exam about 2 weeks prior, you get bonus ideas.\n4. **This is immediately relevant:** Break syllabus into topics. Quantify How much each time would take. Sort them in decreasing order of *importance wrt weightage of marks* - this you figure out based on 1-3 above. Figure out how much time you have left. Pick topics for the maximum marks per unit time for the time remaining. FORGET the rest of the topics until you're done with the former.\n5. If there's time, read the remaining topics or review what you've already done.\n6. *B o n u s t i p*: Make short notes every time you read a topic from your notes. So each iteration of a topic gives you more and more compressed notes, i.e., Mnemonics of mnemonics of mnemonics...\n7. Finally: Stop thinking about what you won't be able to do, and just what you can do. Be aggressive, not defensive! Courage wolf attacks the syllabus it can.

I started with the standard alphabet\n\n    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z - 00:40:33\n    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z - 00:32:63\n    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z - 00:41:88\n    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z - 00:41:98\n    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z - 00:46:30\n    Average: 00:40:62\n\nThen I attempted the same technique but rather than using the alphabet, reorganized the letters according to an english language letter frequency table found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency\n\n    e t a o i n s h r d l c u m w f g y p b v k j x q z - 00:32:96\n    e t a o i n s h r d l c u m w f g y p b v k j x q z - 00:29:86\n    e t a o i n s h r d l c u m w f g y p b v k j x q z - 00:45:25\n    e t a o i n s h r d l c u m w f g y p b v k j x q z - 00:31:93\n    e t a o i n s h r d l c u m w f g y p b v k j x q z - 00:31:39\n    Average: 00:34:28\n\nObviously not enough data to be statistically significant, but interesting nonetheless.

{"body": "Obviously there's a lot I haven't included in my original post.\n\nYes, the idea of being from a single ethnicity may have existed well throughout the history of China.  Yes, the Han identity may have existed back in the day.  But these can be mutually exclusive.  \n\nRecognizing that you and the majority of a neighboring state may share the same ethnicity, doesn't mean that you may necessarily think yourself as \"Han\".  Even if the identity of \"Han\" existed back in the day, it was just one of hundreds, such that it would not be THE Chinese identity as it is today.  We cannot project backwards by assuming that if 92% of the population of China admits they are Han today, means that their ancestors are truly Han, even considering mixed bloodlines.\n\nThis is a really loose analogy but consider a tree diagram.  At the lowest level of the tree (leaf level) you have ethnicities A, B, C, D, E, F.  Suppose A, B, C, D are grouped as sharing a common culture, and thus someone names them collectively as \"D\".  Eventually if you propagate the identity \"D\" long enough, people forget they were once separated into 4 different ethnicities.  Suppose the other ethnicities E and F were not grouped and propagated in the same way as D.  Then centuries later you would have ethnicities D, E, F, with D being the largest ethnicity.\n\nWhat does this mean?

{"body": "I know this is an old post, but hear me out. You're saying things that aren't completely in line with the history of the evolution of \"scales.\" Beware, a lot of parenthetical statements are to follow:\n\nWritten western music didn't begin using the \"major scale\" in earnest until well after Greek times. After medieval times even. After the Renaissance! The ancient Greeks considered \"scales\" as groups of interlocking tetrachords (4 notes, not 7), while in the medieval era, composers organized notes into hexachords (6 notes, not 7). \n\nNeither conceived scales in the fashion of diatonic octave-to-octave as you claim. They had scales *similar* to the major scale, but definitely did not have \"do re mi fa so la ti\" in mind (they were not *the* important notes), nor did these similar scales function in the same was as a major scale does.\n\nAlso, flats and sharps not belonging to a mode were introduced to account for motion on the outer limits of the medieval hexachord (which was limited to a deviation of a half-step). To say that they were hinting at FM or Dm would be an anachronism as \n\n-harmony was a result solely of contrapuntal melodic construction roughly until the common practice period\n\n-tertian chordal harmony, which existed before but wasn't articulated until the CPP, was still not introduced to western music until the introduction of the English concept of panconsonance during the Renaissance\n\nI know you might say, \"Well they don't have to know exactly what they're doing to hint at a key unintentionally,\"  but that would be impossible, as you cannot hint at keys when keys *themselves* were not yet a reality. There was no such thing as C major (which I guess is the point of me saying all this), so you can't hint at any other sort of major or minor pitch organization. If you had a Bb, it was probably because you were singing in the 5th mode (F G A Bb C D), which was most definitely not \"far out.\"\n\nIf you did have an accidental outside of the mode you were singing in, it was either because you were singing a half-step above or below the limits of the hexachord (for instance, if you were singing in the 6th mode C D E F G A, a written B at the top of the tessitura would be sung Bb as it is outside the hexachord...and that was just the rule. You get to deviate a half-step), or because the practice of musica ficta dictated that your note be altered to avoid a tritone harmony in your counterpoint (B becomes Bb when written against an F).\n\n\nPoint is, the 7-note major scale as we think of it, heck the whole concept of a 7 note scale, is a *relatively* recent and non-universal phenomenon, and definitely does arise out of an evolution of the mathematical pitch organizations that began with Pythagoras and have gone through a multitude of iterations. Even if a piece ostensibly had someone sing a major scale in ancient times (say they were singing in that 6th mode and had a written B at the bottom of the tessitura...this would be a B natural as that is the half-step deviation), I can guarantee they weren't thinking of it as a fundamental pitch class set (In this case, the B natural would be considered outside of the mode, and generally acceptable only in very particular instances). \n\nIf there is evidence of the use of the major scale before pretty much \"modern\" times, it is not reflected in the written music or theory, and would therefore be difficult to argue. If you believed that people knew of the major scale before Pythagoras, it wouldn't follow that not only would western music not arrive at it's diatonic concept until a full millennium later, but that they would begin with a concept so entirely different. The mistake is in assuming that the ancient musicians thought of music in even remotely similar ways as we do today.

{"body": "This. When I was a child, I learned very quickly that the guaranteed way to have a nightmare (especially an intense, paralytic nightmare) was for me to sleep on my back. As soon as I stopped, I never had night terrors again.\n\nAlthough I'm kind of messed up now, in a way. I actually *missed* having those nightmares after they stopped. So, one night, I intentionally slept on my back, and had the blackest terror of an experience you can imagine. It was so vivid, evil, and real, and I experienced many of the same symptoms you did: a darker-than-black shadow looming and suffocating me, smoky apparitions with red, glowing eyes seething at me from another plane of existence, complete inability to physically react. It was the scariest of the nightmares I'd ever had while sleeping on my back.\n\nThen, I woke up in a hot sweat and realized my heart was pounding and adrenaline was pumping through my veins. My first reaction, when I found it was just a dream was *that was fucking cool!!* I came so close to the actual experience of death with that nightmare. It was a completely charged thrill ride throughout the night, like seeing the scariest horror film you could imagine.\n\nThen, I started sleeping on my back more and more, because it was a surefire way to have nightmares on demand, night after night. I loved completely suspending disbelief and becoming engrossed in fear like no movie ever could do for me. Every night, a new and more chilling evil would attack my helpless self, which caused my body to release more stress hormones and adrenaline. I started having nightmares within nightmares (yes I N C E P T I O N), where I would narrowly escape the evil lurker only to \"awaken\" to a paralyzed state beset by another terror. It was messed up, but upon awakening, I would remember the nightmares from a fully conscious state and just think it was so much *fun.*\n\nEventually, sleeping on my back did not reliably produce nightmares anymore. Nowadays, this ability is gone completely, and I only get (normal) nightmares randomly like everyone else. But unlike everyone else, I look forward to having nightmares. It is the ultimate horror film, the best consequence-free look at my inevitable end. I've never shared this with anyone.\n\nAfter this experience (I was about 11 years old or so), never again was I afraid of roller coasters, heights, or other things that commonly frighten people. I think my ability to fear dangerous things has been adversely affected by becoming such a nightmare junkie.\n\nTL;DR: I had extreme night terrors while sleeping on my back. Twist: I fucking loved them.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1302857454", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "i never said false claims aren't a problem.  they very much are.  and i do come from a biased point-of-view from BOTH perspectives.  a close family family (a man) has spent years in prison due to a false claim and people close to me have been accused of falsifying their allegations of rape and i have worked in a rape crisis center for several years, so i see what rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence does to victims.  and because that rape crisis center helped with investigations, i also know how difficult it is to prove such assaults occurred and how difficult it is to bring these cases to trial.\n\nyour source on DNA was written in 1996 and i'm positive at that time the DNA evidence didn't match 1 in 3 people in prison and because of such even today people sitting in prison are innocent.  But because of various legal projects in this country those men and women are finally being freed and because of those same projects the legal system is becoming more diligent (though it still has flaws) about putting the right person in prison.\n\nAs for that Kanin study, here's a quote from one of those links i provided that show's how he arrived at that number and why it's not held up as the truth:\n\n\"In the most frequently cited study on this\ntopic, Professor Eugene Kanin (1994)\nreported that 41% of the 109 sexual assault\nreports made to one midwestern police\nagency were deemed to be false over a\nnine-year time period. However, the determination\nthat the charges were false was\nmade solely by the detectives; this evaluation\nwas not reviewed substantively by the\nresearcher or anyone else. As Lisak (2007)\ndescribes in an article published in the\nSexual Assault Report:\n'Kanin describes no effort to\nsystemize his own ‘evaluation’\nof the police reports—for\nexample, by listing details or\nfacts that he used to evaluate\nthe criteria used by the police\nto draw their conclusions. Nor\ndoes Kanin describe any effort\nto compare his evaluation of\nthose reports to that of a second,\nindependent research—\nproviding a ‘reliability’ analysis.\nThis violates a cardinal rule of science, a rule designed to\nensure that observations are\nnot simply the reflection of the\nbias of the observer (p. 2).'\n\n\"In other words, there is no way to explore\nwhether the classification of these cases as\nfalse was simply made as a result of the\ndetectives’ own perceptions and biases,\nwithout any real investigation being conducted.\nThis concern is compounded by the\nfact that the practice of this particular police\ndepartment was to make a “serious offer to\npolygraph” all rape complainants and suspects\n(Kanin, 1994, p. 82). In fact, this practice\n“has been rejected and, in many cases,\noutlawed because of its intimidating impact\non victims” (Lisak, 2007, p. 6). The reason is\nbecause many victims will recant when faced\nwith apparent skepticism on the part of the\ninvestigator and the intimidating prospect of\nhaving to take a polygraph examination. Yet\nsuch a recantation does not necessarily\nmean that the original report was false.\nIn reality, there is no way that an investigator\ncan make an appropriate determination\nabout the legitimacy of a sexual assault\nreport when no real investigation has been\nconducted—and the victim is intimidated by\nthe department’s policy of making a “serious\noffer to polygraph” all rape complainants. As\nwe will discuss at length below, the determination\nthat a report is false can only be\nmade on the basis of findings from a thorough,\nevidence-based investigation.\nAs a result of these and other serious problems\nwith the “research,” Kanin’s (1994)\narticle can be considered “a provocative\nopinion piece, but it is not a scientific study\nof the issue of false reporting of rape. It certainly\nshould never be used to assert a scientific\nfoundation for the frequency of false\nallegations” (Lisak, 2007, p. 1).\n\nM e t h o d o l o g i c a l l y r i g o r o u s\nr e s e a r c h f i n d s 2 - 8 %\nIn contrast, when more methodologically\nrigorous research has been conducted,\nestimates for the percentage of\nfalse reports begin to converge\naround 2-8%.\"\n\nit's very important to research the methods a study used to determine its conclusions, especially when examining issues like this.  Obviously, the Kanin study is very flawed and the results it produced are opinion at best and flat out lies at worst.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1302876277", "subreddit": "reddit.com", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; [Apologies to the music pros that are going to cringe slightly at what I write below]\n\nBullshit, I think you understand more than a great deal of what you might consider \"real musicians\". Especially the bit about playing around with different scales to get a sense of their character, their special features.\n\nFor example, take the Lydian mode (normal major scale, but take the 4th note up a half step). As you play around in it yourself, and listen to music written in a Lydian mode, you start to recognize the idioms, the common tricks people you use. Raising the fourth totally changes the dynamics of the scale. The third isn't anywhere near as interesting, because you don't have that half-step tension between the 3rd and 4th. Now you have it between the 4th and the 5th, so *that* resolution becomes central to any kind of music going on in the Lydian mode.\n\nInsights like that will never came from just learning a scale by rote. You have to experiment, improvise; literally just screw around and see what happens, see what sounds you can make with that scale. Learning it this way also makes the idea of learning them in every key less intimidating. If the major scale to you is just \"C D E F G A B C\", or even \"whole whole half whole whole whole half\", then learning it in every key is going to be a painful exercise. If, however, you have an intuitive understanding of the major scale, how the half step tensions between 3/4 and 7/1 drive most of the music written in it, then learning it in new keys is conceptually very easy. All the concepts are the same, they're just shifted off a little bit and you might have to learn some new fingerings to get them, but it's very doable with practice.\n\n**tl;dr** You're on the right track to musical understanding, a track that a lot of people totally miss out on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1303017851", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

For the last item slot, you have a couple of options, each of which are viable: a second Archangel's, a Manamune, a Lich Bane, or a Deathcap (most games won't last this long, so I haven't really been able to test out the last item slot thoroughly, but I think that any of these items would be good).\n\nFor skillups, I usually follow this pattern:\nE W W Q W R W Q W Q R Q Q E E R E E\nHowever, if you and your lanemate are being harassed or having trouble laning early on, feel free to put a point in Imbue more often.\n\nFor summoner skills, I take Clarity and Ghost. The Clarity helps early on while you are still building your mana pool, and sometimes it will give you that last little bit of \"oomph\" that will let you run your ult long enough to take out an early turret. I like Ghost because Taric is slooooow and Ghost can help you get into a teamfight, get out of a teamfight, or chase down a fleeing enemy for a stun.\n\nIf you can get someone to help you get Blue Golem in the early game (unless someone else on your team needs it more, of course), the buff will really help out. Later in the game, you won't really need the buff as much.\n\nIf you don't like this build, Aura Whore Taric is also fun to play.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1303176168", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, in my opinions, a very large number of people here do not understand how Cass works. You need to build a littler heartier on her, because you are a *sustained* DPS mage, not burst. That being said...\n\nStart out with a Mana crystal + 2 Hpots. Rush the catalyst. Grab boots 1, then turn the cata into RoA. Boots 1 -&gt; Sorc shoes. Then get a Rylai's. Deathcap -&gt; Zhonya's -&gt; Choice last item. I usually go a little more defensive. BV or QSS. I would highly recommend not building CDR on her, since her E becomes a flat cooldown when the target is poisoned, and your Q already recharges before the duration ends. There is no sense in building more CDR than base.\n\nFor skills you want to go Q E W E E R E Q E Q R Q Q W W R W W\nThe reasoning behind this is, even though your Q does more damage over time, that is precisely what it is. A DoT. You have no burstyness with it. So in between casts of Q, you will be using your E which is your main source of damage. Yes your Q does more number wise, but not actually DPS more.\n\nThe mindset of Cassiopeia is the longer you stay in battle, the more you do. Unlike Annie, who just walks in, blows her spells, and then doesn't do anything. You have to be in the fight longer than other people. As soon as you can get 2 - 3 people in your ult, use it. Spam your Q, use your W in tactical positions that will slow/poison multiple people, and E spam on those squishies that you catch in your poison. You are essentially a midline caster, thus why you need to have a little more health on you. Positioning is what makes Cassiopeia a good character. Knowing how and when to use your spells.\n\nTL;DR Get some health kids. You are a midline sustained DPS caster who needs to live a long time to do what you do.

Basically 'f o u r  l e v e l s  d o w n' before we even start considering 'social self'.\r\n\r\nBuddhism concerns a far more fundamental problem, given that 'it's all atoms (or potentially strings)', what governs where things start and stop? Why are certain bonds between molecules more significant than a lack of bonding between others?\r\n\r\nSee what I mean?\r\n\r\nFinally as an aside, I tend to find the majority of my thoughts are abstract and constructed without language.

{"body": "First off, thanks for all the compliments! This was fairly painstaking, so it's really rewarding and exciting to see people enjoying my artwork. Here's a post answering some general questions about the process, aka, ruining the magic:\n\nI first sketched out each part, pasted them on some posterboard, and then cut them out. The heads, bodies, arms, and Rocco are each separate pieces, about 4.5 inches tall, all set in front of the other. To get the exaggerated depth perception, I set a wide aperture (I think F5 or so) on my camera. The light and cutouts were slightly angled in relationship to the background so I could have some sort of control over where the shadows fell. Lastly, there is some light photoshopping done - I removed a bit of the support that ended up showing in the picture (I wanted to crop it out, but then the image became off center), removed a color cast, and added a small vignette. Oh, and I shot everything on top of a pizza box.\n\nBy request, here are some different angles: [angle 1](http://i.imgur.com/V03RI.jpg), [angle 2](http://i.imgur.com/edtyz.jpg), [angle 3](http://i.imgur.com/pLPlR.jpg).\n\nAlso by request, here are some examples of my other artwork. I usually do hyper realistic drawings and paintings, but i'm currently exploring photography and ceramics right now. I don't have a digital portfolio up yet (mainly because i'm lazy) but I will definitely post it here when I finish it.\n\n[ceramic tree](http://i.imgur.com/XI8iO.jpg) 2011\n\n[my shoes](http://i.imgur.com/QdiNe.jpg), oil on canvas, 2010\n\n[Fraaanciiss!](http://i.imgur.com/ADqfL.jpg), oil on canvas, 2010\n\n[octowhat?](http://i.imgur.com/podaa.png), photoshop, 2010\n\n[cello](http://i.imgur.com/w0Jps.jpg), charcoal on paper, 2009\n\n\nAnd by this [request](http://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/gzc68/i_recreated_a_scene_from_the_boondock_saints/c1rflfz), here is a photograph of me photographing this photograph (no pizza box this time, though) for ~~science~~ art: \n[A R T C E P T I O N](http://i.imgur.com/LWiZ2.jpg)\n\nIf you have anymore questions, i'm happy to answer them.

{"body": "Hello! ^__^ Thank you for the well thought out response!\n\nI still feel as though I am bisexual, because strictly speaking, I am. When you boil it down to it's simplest form, all the way down to biological sex, I am bisexual. However, the term bisexual is, to me, still too black and white - because IMO there are more than 2 sexes. There are XY and XX, and XXY and XXX - but Klinefelter's Disorder and Trisomy X are often phenotypically indistinguishable. I'm aware that the scientific community doesn't consider chromosomal differences such as these to be separate sexes, but maybe we should. Maybe it would help the next generation be more understanding of gender fluidity if we separated biological gender from gender identity, and taught that even our biology doesn't always stamp us either XX or XY at conception.\n\nPerhaps then we would all find it easier to define love as an undefined variable, as something that is different for each of us - shaped by our own lives and experiences. Perhaps we could then teach that the definition of love is wholly individual and therefore our own definition of love applies only to ourselves and that we should accept and understand other's definitions of love. From there, I would hope we could then find it easier to explain that our own definition of love is fluid and dynamic - changing multiple times throughout our lives. It would be easier, then, for our children to embrace themselves and others as they find out who and what they like. But, I'm rather idealistic.\n\nI do still identify as bisexual, and omnisexual... and polyamorous and a S L U T of various shades (because I am - I'm a cuddle-slut, a love-slut, a slut in the most traditional terms, a book-slut, a beard-slut... et c. Because we should be taking the shame right on out of that word...). :) I just have a term now which is easier for me to discuss and explain than my previous \"I'm a bisexual... but...\" spiel, and was excited. I agree with you - and maybe even going one further in that I think all of the sexuality labels are huddled together and interchangeable under the one label that we all have in common: Human Being.\n\nI am very happy to have found /r/bisexual, thank you for modding, and thank you for your response.
