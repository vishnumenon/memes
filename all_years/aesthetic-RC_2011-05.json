Now the scale should go from D to D using only the white or natural keys on the keyboard, as such:  \n\n D E F G A B C D  \n\nThis is known as the **Dorian** mode. \n\nFollow the same pattern to figure the other modes, starting on each scale degree of the C major scale.\n\n(E-E) is the **Phrygian** mode.  \n\n(F-F) is the **Lydian** mode.  \n\n(G-G) is the **Mixolydian** mode. \n\n(A-A) is the **Aeolian** mode.  \n\n(B-B) is the **Locrian** mode. \n\nThis same method can be used to deduce different scale modes for other keys by starting on the corresponding scale degrees in each major key. Per your example, An E major scale with an A# in stead of an A would be in E Lydian mode. The Lydian mode is based on the 4th scale degree of the B major scale.

{"body": "[edit] slow reply because I had to take my final\n\nE is really good for level 1 fights. This allows you to slow anyone your team is chasing even with ghost on since you're also giving your teammate a small movespeed bonus. Q is definitely better for the laning phase, so you can always go E Q Q W Q first.\n\nI build Sona tanky because she is easily picked off. By having more survivability, I can spam more and keep my team alive during a team fight. If my sole reason is to be alive and take the ults, I am fine with that as my team should be able to pick them off. [edit] This part is also very situational but most of the time when they do use all their ults on me, we can pick them off just fine.\n\nAs for your items, a Doran's ring is much better than the blade. Most of the time, I'm usually not last hitting which is also the reason why I go 2 gold items and mastery. I tend to give the other laner all my CS while denying the other team of CS. A Doran's Ring will provide enough regen and AP to put out damage. I didn't get sheen because I rather raise my team's overall damage than just my own. 4 20's is better than 1 50.\n\nW is really good if the other team has heavy hitters. For example, if a Vlad does 500 damage with Q, throwing a W on him will reduce his damage by 100 and only dealing 400 (if you're at 0 MR that is).\n\nThough tbh, theorycrafting isn't really my thing. Through experience, this just works out better. As always, your game is very situational. Build accordingly to your team and most of all, build accordingly to the other team.

B C D E F G H all shook a different number of hands, 0-6, because nobody can shake hands with themself or their spouse. Mr Brown (A) did not say how many hands he shook. Mrs. Brown (B) could not have shaken hands with 6 people, because that would mean she shook C-H's hands, but somebody in C-H shook 0 hands. Similarly, she could not have shaken 0 hands, because somebody in C-H would have shook 6 hands, and Mrs. Brown would have to be in that group. So we know B shook anywhere from 1 - 5 hands. Lets call C the person who shook hands with 6 people, or everybody except D and C. Then D must have shaken 0 hands, because everybody else shook atleast one. Suppose B shook hands with 5 people, which would have to be C E F G H; but E F G H all shook hands with C, and all with B, but one of them answered 1, so B did not shake 5 hands. Suppose B shook 1 hand, then she only shook hands with C, but somebody of E F G H shook hands with 5 people, everybody except D, their spouse, and themself, which means B shook 2 hands, a contradiction, therefore B did not shake 1 hand. So B either shook 2, 3, or 4 hands. Call the person who shook 5 hands E, therefore he shook the hands of A B C G H.

Next, break it up in to grids of various sizes.  Since we're dealing with thousands of characters, it is inevitable that some sized grid will turn up words that we want to see.  The Bible code proponents aren't just looking at the Torah and they happen to see these phrases.  They are using computer programs to search for particular words.  The computer program makes a grid sized to find the word they're after.  Let's use that first sentence as an example.  It's 28 characters, so I'll break it into a 7x4 grid:\n\n    B R A ShY S B \n          ^\n    R A A L H Y M \n          ^\n    A S H ShM Y M \n          ^ ^ ^ ^\n    V A S H A R Tz\n\nThis creates the phrase \"**Sh**a**L**o**Sh** **M**a**Y**i**M**\", \"three waters\".  What does that mean?  Absolutely nothing, of course.  It's completely arbitrary, just like any of the other Bible codes.\n\nWith all that said, from a Jewish perspective the Torah is, in a mystical sense, the blueprint of creation.  It does, *in a mystical sense*, have all past and future events contained within it.  The Torah is a very special document with many deep significances in the placement of every single letter.  It would just take more than a bit of wordplay to illuminate that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304396381", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "nobody here is really getting it, so im going to try and break it down.\n\n60hz essentially means the screen refreshes 60 times in a second.  this can be thought of as 60fps.  this is about where the limits of the human eye can perceive are.  of course there is some variance depending on what is being viewed and the viewers own eyes, but 60fps is generally thought of as topping out.\n\nSo why make 120hz lcds?  well, there are two types of video, one is 29.97 (we'll call it 30fps for simplicity) and the other is film which is 24fps.  for 60hz lcds, each frame of video is broadcasted twice to fill up the space.  so even though your screen is capable of 60fps you are still only essentially seeing 30, since each frame is sent twice.  for example, imagine a sequence of frames A B C in a video.  it would look something like this:  A A B B C C.  However, since film uses 24fps, the frames cannot be evenly distributed into 60hz.  to compensate, they use a method known as 2:3 pulldown.  That means that the frames A B C are sent out as A A B B B C C etc.  Each frame is broadcast a different amount of times, which is why it will seem to stutter.\n\nSo to solve this, LCD makers began making 120hz LCDs since 120 could be easily divided by both 30 and 24.  when the source is 30fps, each rame is shown 4 times.  when the source is 24, each frame is shown 5.  video ends up looking like A A A A B B B B and film ends up looking like A A A A A B B B B B.  no frame is shown any more or less that other frames, essentially getting rid of that jerky movement to get from 2:3 pulldowns.\n\nOf course, then they realized that they could sell consumers 240hz lcds and 600hz lcds and claim smoother video, but thats just pure marketing.  each frame is still on the screen for 1/24 or 1/30 of a second no matter what your lcd is capable of.\n\nnow that we have all that out of the way, how does this relate to video games?  well if your graphics card is capable of pushing out fps equal to or greater than 120fps, then sure, you can get one.  however, anything below that will still cause you to have weird 3:2 pulldown like problems and keep you from getting perfectly smooth video until you get to the point of 60fps.  and by then you might as well just have a 60hz lcd.\n\n hope this clears things up.\n\n**tl;dr: Higher Hz are only meant to solve 2:3 pulldown problems.  human eyes cant perceive much past 60fps.**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304540149", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

I literally walk into the door of my grandma's house and my 66year old aunt looks at me and says...\"why won't your cousin Melyssa add me as a friend on facebook?\" I almost died....and to top it off i witnessed my 90 year old grandmother *calling people on the phone* during the day to tell them that she can see they are on facebook and she wants them to do something with her Farmville. Oh lordy i couldn't delete that thing fast enough! \n\nscrew facebook. there's phone, there's email, and if you're too lazy for that there's a text message. i laugh everytime someone goes \"oh you didn't hear about (so and so's) party?\" NO...because no one thought to actually TELL ME! haha. /rant\n\n\nSabado is fucking rad too.

Nobody identifies with \"faggot\". \"Gay\", sure, and I don't like using that word because it's simply short for \"homosexual\", which is a neutral adjective in my opinion. \"Faggot\" is clearly negative. For example, saying \"You're so gay!\", while I understand it, is kinda dumb. Still, as long as you interpret it as non-hurtful sentence, there's nothing inherently wrong with it.\n\nLook, I have gay friends who use the word. There isn't some universal law that says that the letters F A G G O T stacked in order is something that is hurtful. Or even \"that's so gay\".\n\n&gt;And also by your argument, aren't names just words? So it's all fair game right? :-)\n\nYes, and no. It depends on the situation. I don't condone people harassing others by saying hurtful things to them, but I'm not stupid enough to think that words in themselves are evil. The thing is, you have to interpret the context. If someone calls a gay person a \"faggot\" because he dislikes the fact that they're gay, that's harassment and not acceptable at all. If a someone calls a close friend the same jokingly, it's probably in good nature and not meant to harass gay people everywhere.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304597292", "subreddit": "starcraft", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

However, I will admit, during my plateau, my clothes are fitting better, and I can hit a new hole in the belt.\n\nSome claim you go through periods of loss, and then periods of volume loss, and then periods of weight loss again.  I suppose its entirely feasible that through my massive new protein intake, I could be building muscle?  I don't exercise much outside of regular walking (yet), though as soon as the pool warms up more I'm going to work in regular swimming.\n\nAs for daily intake, I don't count calories but I can confirm I'm under 30g of carbs, easy.\n\nMorning is generally: 3 eggs, 4 slices bacon, small handfull of asparagus/green beans.\nEvening: some type of salad with bacon bits, cheeses, ranch dressing.\nSnacks: (If any): Cheese Sticks and Salami.  OMNOMNOM DIET\n\nI may try some intermittent fasting this coming week, if I don't see any loss for 2 weeks straight.  I feel SO FULL all the time on this diet, I can easily see 1 huge breakfast lasting for a day and a half. \n\nThere's also the 16/8 intermittent fasting, eat during an 8hr third of the day, and fast during the other two thirds of the day (16hrs).

Why should I enjoy it?\n\n&gt;appreciating the thoughts, musings, kisses, and time with my boyfriend is a complete waste of time that I should be ashamed of, but your posting on reddit ad nauseum is an appropriate and productive use of time?\n\nI'm engaging my mind in rational debate.  I'm critically thinking.  I might learn a thing or two.\n\n&gt;You essentially say you only want us to wake up as a species and move towards a productive, science and rationality-based future for humanity, yet everything you say screams FOREVER ALONE\n\nUm, doesn't this describe a large, almost unanimous part of reddit?  Whenever any news comes up about the rich vs. poor, corporations, etc... everyone is always going on about how they can't wait until the southern religious rednecks wake up and be more logical and science minded, with regard to research, evolution, and everything.  I don't see how I'm so radical.\n\n&gt;Should we stay individuals and purposely avoid distractions like each others company as we learn more and more of the secrets of our universes fundamental laws?\n\nYes.  You said it right.  Progress is synonymous with scientific, and philisophical progress.  I dont see how you could be \"for\" science research, but be ok with somebody researching AIDS taking a break or a week long vacation to be with his girlfriend.\n\n&gt;Also, and please don't avoid this question either, what do you do for fun? Do you not acknowledge this as a concept?\n\nI guess internet debate would be the closest thing to fun.  I acknowledge it as a concept, but do everything in my power to ignore it.  It's an irrational behavior.\n\n&gt;Are you telling me all you do is study, and then browse the internet until you go to sleep and wake up again.\n\nYes, but then again, doesn't most of reddit?  Or at least they make it appear as if they are.  While they whine about being forever alone, I embrace it.\n\n&gt;If this is all just you compiling data, and that's all that matters, why not attempt a sincere romantic relationship? Have you tried once and it did not go well, and thus you think you've \"learned all you need to\", or have you simply seen so many horrible examples of what it can bring that you are too afraid to give into your biological yearnings to experience one of the simplest and most universally appreciated desires of humans.\n\nI would if it was to be a case study, however, humans as we know them now would view that as a violation of ethics.  I have never been in a relationship.  As I said, I've seen and heard enough horrible things about them to be turned off forever.\n\n&gt;Does the fact that virtually all scientists and philosophors alive and dead, of whom you have the ability to build your knowledge base upon would and do agree with my outlook at least make you consider the possibility you are wrong? \n\nNo, the very concept of progress implies that beliefs previously held can be rejected or modified due to new findings.  Human interaction is only necessary in terms of a project that can't feasibly done alone, like building a rocket.  Wasting an afternoon playing frisbee is just stupid.\n\nI am not happy with my time redditing.  I believe this website has a fantastic framework for rational discussion, but the constant onslaught of \"Nice try ____\" or \"I N C E P T I O N\" really makes me wonder why I come here.\n\nWe should work towards inhabiting the rest of the universe, and continuing scientific research.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304623988", "subreddit": "DoesAnybodyElse", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm a former airline pricer (with America West back in the day), so I can help answer this one.\n\nFirst of all, neither airline is allowed to coordinate pricing with each other, even if it's on the same flights.  That's illegal except for those airlines that have been granted antitrust immunity.  (An example of that is United and Lufthansa over the Atlantic, but there is none of that domestically.)\n\nWhile that is the case, there is a general understanding that you don't want to underprice the operating airline (United, in this case).  It's not always the case, but it's rare to see that happen.  If it happened a lot, then the operating airline wouldn't continue to codeshare with that airline.\n\nThere is no separate availability between the airlines.  They're all pulling out of the same pot of seats, so there has to be a method to the madness.  \n\nAs has been mentioned here, airlines have \"buckets\" in which they decide how many seats they want to sell.  For United, it looks like this domestically:\n\nF A Y B M E U H Q V W S T L K\n\nThese buckets are in descending order in terms of value to the airline, but in reality, there are only two classes of service here.  F is full fare First Class while A is discounted First Class.  Y is full coach (and is for just about every airline) and they go down from there.  Just remember that it doesn't matter if you buy Y or if you buy K - you're sitting in the same place, but United wants to sell more Y because it's a higher fare for them.\n\nUS Airways has its own set of buckets, and there has to be an agreement on how those get \"mapped\" to the United ones.  So, if someone books Y on US Airways, it will book into Y on United.  But what if someone books S on US Airways?  Where will that book on United?  It's all in the agreement between the airlines.\n\nOn this itinerary, the lowest United had on the way out was Q and T on the way back.  But there is no fare filed in T class, so the lowest fare on the return is in W.  (If you go back and search now, you'll see Q is no longer available, so the price is higher and you have to book in H.)  US Airways, however, is showing only higher buckets available.  So it only has higher fares available.  This isn't US Airways trying to make an extra (thousand) bucks but rather just an annoying anomaly.  It's probably not something that US Airways is spending much time on, because it has much more important routes that need attention.\n\nI can get into much greater detail here, but I've probably already put half of you to sleep.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304636795", "subreddit": "travel", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For a very simple to-do list I use Google Tasks (gtasks) because I can access it in my e-mail and even better there's a widget for android phones so I can always see it when I'm using my phone.  I find it better to have it always present like that, but each person has their own method.  Obviously not going to be a replacement for a complete time-management system.\n\n*Edited to add*: There are a lot of methods and books for time/task management out there but I have found they almost always boil down to simplification.  Here's an example:\n\nList your tasks and give them a label depending on priority.  For example a system like A B C D could be: A=Extremely urgent.  Has to be done before anything else or is due asap.  B=Very important.  Must be done soon but isn't imminent, however not getting it done soon will result in a negative consequence.  C=Needs to be done.  It would be nice to do these soon but they can wait a little while if you have A or B tasks to do.  D=Would like to do.  Not getting these done will not result in any negative consequence.  F=Not important.  If you have an F task just ask yourself, \"why?\".  If it's not important enough to make it to at least a D you should probably get rid of it.  If you're in a position to delegate your work you should try to delegate any lower level tasks you can so that you can focus on the important ones.\n\nNow these are just some labels I made up on the spot to give you an idea but basically just have a few labels of importance and always do the most important ones first.  In the example I gave you would never want to take on additional work, even as a favor, if you had an A or B task.

{"body": "Dude, flashcards are the way to go. Flashcards, I say! Listen to me. Flashcards. Now read on, and trust me.\n\nCreate a set of flashcards including the key signatures of every key (easily created: basically staves depicting treble clefs (or bass clefs or whatever) and 1,2,3,4,5,6 flats, sharps, and of course no sharps or flats. You can find images online if you don't want to make it by hand.) Include 2 of each, and distinguish half of the set with a simple star or 'min' or the word 'minor' or whatever, just so you know half of them are for major and the other half for minor.\n\nThat's all you need for now! Begin by memorizing what major key has 3 flats, what minor key has 4 sharps, and so on! Start with a set of 5 cards only; memorize those, throw in another few, etc. You can memorize it all in a day by rote memory.\n\nNext, you want to be able to say exactly which sharps/flats are in each key. Look at the circle of fifths, which you may have heard of. Look at it for it bit, it's not hard to memorize. I used acronyms back in high school: Fat Children [are] Good [for] Dinner Alway Eat Babies! (I used it for a while, too! Even though I don't recommend it since I included those bracketed words that don't follow the letters.) Backwards, for the use of flats, I always just thought of it as \"bead-g.c.\" not that it means anything.\n\nSo your answers for the flashcards will then be, B Major: \"5 sharps! F#, C#, G#, D#, A#!\" Another example: F minor: \"4 flats! Bb, Eb, Ab, Db!\" It will take you a very short amount of time to memorize this.\n\nOk, so this next part you want to do until you become really speedy. You want to learn to spell every key. So again with the flashcards, and now the answer will be something like this: E Major: \"E F# G# A B C# D# E.\" Boom, make your answers fast. Again, rote memory. You're basically just doing what you already did but putting the notes in alphabetical order. Remember, major and minor.\n\nFrom there, it may be a good idea to start applying this stuff to your instrument. The rote memory is awesome and it will make you speedy for any future applications of keys, applied to your instrument or any further theory studies like voice-leading or creating progressions. As a guitarist, I can offer the advice that I managed to get through my AP Theory class [in high school] and Theory II class in college as the fastest person in my class *because I would imagine the voice-leading on my guitar's fretboard*. It also made me a better guitarist, obviously. Visualizing skills ftw! So see if you, too, can kill two birds with one stone with what have you.\n\nOk, so after learning all the keys really, really well (HONESTLY, might take only a WEEK! (I taught my ex-gf back during lunches in senior year of high school and she learned it simply and not as a musician very easily indeed)) what you then want to do is start learning about the chords in the keys.\n\nMajor scale follows a formula. All those scales you just memorized follow this: W W H W W W H. \"Whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half.\" Whole means a whole step, and half means a half-step; so go to a piano and start on any note and go up in this formula (half steps are notes RIGHT next to each other and whole means two half steps) and you will quickly see it *plots out the very scales you've been spelling*. For minor, there is the minor scale formula (WHWWHWW) but you can also just think of it as starting on the sixth of the major scale. Meaning: there are 7 notes in the scale (8th note is the octave of the root, or the first) and every note has a degree value, and a name! You don't really have to know the names, but I think it helps to add character to the tones especially later when you're involved in chord progressions on a creative level. So,\n\n1st Tonic (or Root),\n2nd Supertonic (or Rising Tone),\n3rd Mediant (or Major 3rd),\n4th Subdominant (or the Fourth),\n5th Dominant (or the Fifth),\n6th Submediant (no one calls it that; it's the Sixth),\n7th Leading Tone!\n\nIf you're into solfege, they also have these names: Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti\n\nOk, so that's just things to know, not memorize with the cards or anything like that. Make sure to also memorize the major scale and minor scale formulas by saying them out loud.\n\nWhat you want to know next is that every single tone I just finished naming can have a chord built upon it. The way you do so is by treating that tone as a \"first\" and adding a corresponding \"third\" and \"fifth\" to it. If your desired chord already starts on the 1st, the 3rd will just be the \"third\", and your 5th will just be your \"fifth\". However, if for example you start on the 5th wanting to create a chord from that tone, your 5th is your \"first\", so your 7th is your \"third\" and your 2nd is your \"fifth\"! You might hit the 2nd an octave higher so you keep the chord in root position and sometimes it is then called a 9th since it's passed the 8th aka root aka octave.\n\nOk, so all clear yeah? Each of these are chords. Plotting out the chords will show you they are all major or minor except the seventh which makes an unusual chord called diminished.\n\nA chord aka triad built on the 1st produces a Major chord.\nA chord aka triad built on the 2nd produces a minor chord.\nA chord aka triad built on the 3rd produces a minor chord.\nA chord aka triad built on the 4th produces a Major chord.\nA chord aka triad built on the 5th produces a Major chord.\nA chord aka triad built on the 6th produces a minor chord.\nA chord aka triad built on the 7th produces a diminished chord.\n\nRemember in **minor** your 6th is your new 1st. So,\n\nA chord aka triad built on the 1st is minor.\nA chord aka triad built on the 2nd is now your diminished.\nA chord aka triad built on the 3rd is now major (also the root of the relative major key!)\nand so on.\n\nBTW, here are two terms:\nRelative minor/Major,\nParallel minor/Major\n\nRelative means C Major which has no sharps or flats relates to A minor which includes the very same notes in its scale. If I were asking for a parallel minor to C Major, I'd end up with C minor which has 3 flats (whose corresponding *relative Major scale* is Eb Major! Are you getting it? Don't forget to go back to mastering the flashcards if you're reading ahead. It would help to use the flashcards to name **relative major and minor keys** to the cards/keys flashed.\n\nAnyway, you can now set new parameters on exercises with the flashcards by turning it into a game. Basically, you hold in your hands a stack of cards representative of all minor and Major keys. I'm going to create a game right now! I will **name** the 2nd-chord (aka \"two-chord\") of any key presented to me and **spell** out the chord I'm naming! The first card is 3 flats, marked as minor: I think like this: 3 flats minor is going to be C minor and the second of C minor is D and the 2nd chord in a minor scale is diminished; now I just have to skip over each following note (I call it leap-frogging to my guitar students) and I will have the \"first\" \"third\" and \"fifth\" that I need. Okay, so D, F, and Ab! Answer: \"The two-chord of C minor is D diminished spelled D F A-flat!\"\n\nAnother example: the game is I name and spell the fifth chord (aka just \"fifth\") of any key that's presented to me in notes *and* solfege! I pull out a card that offers D Major. So I say: \"The fifth of D Major is A, whose chord is A Major, whose notes include A C# E or Sol Ti Re.\" Remember, to recap on solfege, in this case, D is Do, E is Re, F# is Mi, G is Fa, A is Sol, and so on...\n\nOk! You're learning chords in keys. **In Major keys**, the first is major, represented by capital I. The second is minor, represented by lower-case ii. The third chord is iii, meaning it's minor too. The fourth is IV. The fifth is V. The sixth vi. The seventh viidim. Yeah, you should write 'dim' after it. \n\nIn minor, it is like this:\ni\niidim\nIII\niv\nV\nVI\nVII\n\nNote: the fifth here should be minor, but in minor keys the fifth just sounds so damn good as Major. It's a traditional thing, used to bring out its \"Dominant\" function, so just accept it for now. (You can break any rule in composition, anyway.)\n\nAlright now....check this out.....\n\nIn Major keys:\n\niii -&gt; vi -&gt; [IV -&gt; ii] -&gt; [viidim V] -&gt; I -&gt; any chord; also: iii -&gt; IV, IV -&gt; I, V -&gt; vi (deceptive progression) -&gt; any chord.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe iii can go to the vi or the IV.\nThe vi can go to *either* the IV or the ii. (represented by being bracketed)\nEither the IV or the ii can go on to *either* the viidim or the V, but also know that the IV can take a roundabout course by first detouring to the ii before moving on. The IV also has the capability of going directly to the I, created what is called an amen cadence.\nThe viidim or the V can go on to the I, but the V also has the option of deceiving the listener by going instead to the vi.\nWhen the vi is treated this way, it can go on to any chord, just as the I can go on to any chord once reached.\n\nIn minor keys:\n\nVII -&gt; III -&gt; VI -&gt; [iv -&gt; iidim] -&gt; [viidim V] -&gt; i -&gt; any chord; also: III -&gt; iv, iv -&gt; I, V -&gt; VI.\n\nTake note here there is a new chord in the minor scale system called viidim which is basically a substitute for the rule-breaking V chord that is present.\n\nThis takes you very far, further than your average person. Beyond this is learning about seventh chords and other chords, voice-leading aka part-time writing, and modulation and other cool things in writing progressions. You'll need a text book for this stuff. I used Tonal Harmony fifth edition (with the workbook) by Stefan Kostka and Dorothy Payne, and I loved the book.\n\nOk......have fun.

{"body": "**tl;dr: un-altered 11 scale degrees clash to much with the 3rd of the chord and lead to ambiguous harmonic structure, while a raised 11th helps clarify some of the harmonic sound as well as creating a more pleasing dissonance in the harmony. However, if the chord is minor, an un-altered 11th can be employed because it creates a major 2nd dissonance against the third as opposed to a minor 2nd dissonance.**\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is what I have been taught at my uni's jazz arranging course, but it was taught by a pretty highly thought of jazz arranger. But I am sure that, much like all aspects of music theory, specifics will probably be taught differently by different people.\n\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't write a chord name as \"G11\" and leave it at that, because it is ambiguous. (I would either specify it as G7#11, G9#11, or G13#11, depending on what added tones I wanted.) Depending on level of experience with the idiom, musicians could play it as either a #11 or an unaltered 11, and if yu have different people in the same ensemble playing it differently, then chaos ensues and it means you have done something wonrg (meaning unclear) as the composer/arrnager. As a rule of thumb, dominant and major chords with an 11 (or 4) included use a #11 for two reasons: first, the clash between the 3rd and 4th scale degree isn't really a happy dissonance, being a minor 2nd. If you want the 4th scale degree you could employ a sus4 chord, which would omit the third, of course. Second, if you include a non-raised 4th, the harmonic structure becomes muddy. Take Cmaj13. If you to use a non-altered 11, the chord stacks like this: C E G B D F A. The problem arises that, with a C in the base note, these notes spell out a F13#11 chord over a pedal 5th scale degree as well, so it's difficult to differentiate between your I and IV chords. (This being especially heinous in blues charts.) If you use a #11, F#, then you don't have that confusion aurally. \n\n\nHowever, an un-altered 11 can be used in a *minor* chord, because at that point there is a whole step between the 3rd and 4th scale degree, but a #11 is still usable depending on what sound you want.\n\n\nLemme know if that helps :-)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304898481", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

That 9th chords contain 2nds?  They sort of do.  Is there a distinction between an Add2 and an Add9?  Kind of: it depends who's playing it.  \n\nIn jazz I doubt anyone would ever say \"Add2\".  In those terms it's a 9th, because they construct chords in stacks of 3rds.  In folk and rock they'll call it a Sus2, and it means that they're dropping the 3rd and adding the 2nd.  They might use a 9th chord in those styles, but there would usually be a 7th added as well.  Everything else would probably fall more or less within those categories.\n\nGenerally, modern music does not deal with inversions, they just rename the chord according to the lowest note.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304899294", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Tip # 4: Know one mode, know all modes** -  Let's say you got the hang of the major scale. You can run through it for pretty much any key, because it's the same pattern or shape everywhere on the neck. But know you're like, *darn it, I need to re-learn for all the minor keys*. Nope!\n\nTake the C major key: C D E F G A B. If the song is in the key of C major, you can't go wrong playing any of these notes. The funny thing about this is that these notes are the same ones you find in the A minor scale (the 'aeolian mode' in fancy-talk). Every major scale is some other key's minor scale. (In fact, every major scale is some mode of a key, but never mind for now).\n\nHow do you know which major scale to play in for some given minor key? Easy: it's the minor third of the key. Say you're in A minor and you want to know what major scale to play. The difference betwen A major and minor is one note: C# versus C (i.e., x02220 versus x02210). The one that changes is the scale you want: so, the C major scale is the same as the A minor scale. \n\nLikewise for every key! G minor? Bb. E minor? G. When in doubt, fret the major and minor open versions of the chords, see what's different, and choose the lower note. That will be the major scale to play against your minor key. Next time we'll talk about the other modes!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1304922476", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Fair enough. \n\n[Spatial reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial-temporal_reasoning) is basically the ability to form an image of an object in your mind and then manipulate it - rotate it, un-fold it into a net, that kind of thing. The [UMAT](http://umat.acer.edu.au/) site has more information, but the test has three parts. \n\nThe first is just reading information and asking questions about it. You want your reading speed really high for this, because they'll give you a block of text ~400 words long and then ask you ~5 questions about it, and if you only have to read it once you'll save a lot of time. \n\nThe best thing to do is read ~400 words from a text you don't know (grab a book you haven't read, open it to a random page, read a page) as many times as you can in 1 minute (you might not be able to get the whole way through the first time but it gets easier, fast). Then write down as many words from the text you read as you can - anything, like 'John', 'red', 'garden', 'angry' etc. The first time you might only get a few, but you'll quickly be able to remember &gt;40 things from the passage, and you'll find your reading comprehension going through the roof.\n\nThe second is emotional reasoning, like they'll give you a passage of speech or section of conversation, then ask how someone might feel after that conversation. \n\nThe trick with this is to get an [emotion wheel](http://www.google.co.nz/imgres?imgurl=http://lindly.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/emotions1.jpg%3Fw%3D494%26h%3D526&amp;imgrefurl=http://lindly.wordpress.com/2009/04/15/emotional-color-wheel/&amp;h=526&amp;w=494&amp;sz=32&amp;tbnid=kZNzbm2Hi0IFOM:&amp;tbnh=132&amp;tbnw=124&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Demotion%2Bwheel%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=emotion+wheel&amp;usg=__YVCAWbZYhHkvTmA-llNQv14AzRc=&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LqTHTeCIFYPKiALyg-DXBA&amp;ved=0CFIQ9QEwBQ) and do your best to really understand the link between emotions and the combinations and how they link and relate to each other - for example, the progression from annoyance-anger-rage, and how contempt is a mixture of annoyance, anger, disgust and boredom.\n\nThe third is spatial reasoning. It's all visual, and has a few different types of questions:\n\n* five images that form a sequence but are scrambled. Unscramble the sequence and select the middle image as the answer, e.g. BDCAE - ABCDE, answer = C\n\n* Sequence of images, select one from a group to show what should come next in the sequence, e.g. A B C D ...  choose from S E U V I, answer = E\n\nand so on. If you practice being able to recognize common patterns and try to improve your ability to form strong mental images of pictures you look at, it will help. \n\nThe best thing to to is to look at a picture for one minute, close your eyes for one minute while focussing strongly on that picture, then try and recreate it on paper. It's hard at first, but if you do this several times a day you can move into trying to draw the image from memory from multiple angles. \n\nWow this got long. Hope this helps :) and yeah, take UMAT this year.

{"body": "Ryze got hit somewhat significantly though.  Assuming you have 4K mana and get into a team fight, you'll throw your Q about 3 times with him before you have to wait on your cooldowns.  Pre vs. post nerf, you are effectively losing 240 damage from his spell combo.  It's kind of disappointing for me when I'm playing him now to see enemies run away with a sliver of life, knowing that they'd be dead if he wasn't hit (this used to never happen; they either got away with a good chunk of HP or got melted).\n\nThat being said, the weaknesses I see in Ryze are primarily his early early game (when he has nothing), at which point his mana pool is small and he has to last hit with his slow as balls auto attack.  If he's given a solo lane, he *needs* to force the other team to go home first, because he has no way of pushing a tower (even AP solos can start pushing once their AP is high enough).  If he gets a dual lane then his farm suffers.  Ryze is a carry in the sense that he is entirely item-dependent; if he doesn't get his core items within 30-35 mins or so, or if the game doesn't even last that long before the enemy starts getting FoNs and Banshee's, then he's not in a good position to do much damage.  \n\nI also find that the number of people playing Xin nowadays is an indication that he might be starting to get OP.  Xin's lane presence has significantly improved and it's a lot harder to kill him in team fights even as he charges into 5 enemies and knocks up their carry with his W Q E R combo (charges his battle cry and 3 talon strike, goes in with audacious charge, ults).

First, I don't insert the parens manually, because I'm not editing a bunch of text with a critical amount of parentheses, but a tree data structure, a list of lists and atoms, which is a *HUGE* advantage. With I-expressions, I have indented symbols and parenthesized expressions.\n\n&gt; On \"code=data\", you're still using the same syntax for code and data, although data tends to be flatter so it won't change much.\n\nI can't still think of an indentation-sensitive data structure.\n\n&gt; If by structural editing you mean transplanting sub-expressions easily, you can still do that, just point to the \"root\" line and use some kind of script to grab until unindent.\n\nYes, I can transpose two physically-700-lines-long expressions with one keystroke. I can cut one and paste it in some other file, if the current file's indentation level is different than the previous', I can reindent it with a single tab.  \nThis is not possible with I-expressions.

{"body": "That is a great question. I have heard about the CAGED system and I think it is worthwhile if you want to gain some speed and some quick soloing ideas. However, I would go a very different route. In my opinion, the CAGED system it is a band-aid solution to what many guitarists really desire... to be able to fluidly move up and down the fretboard hitting the notes they want to hit, or in other words, to connect what we hear in our minds with what we play with our hands. To be able to do this, one has to go beyond \"positions\" and really understand scales as they exist in sound, and not just on the fretboard. The major scale wasn't frets on a guitar until a few hundred years ago. For a much longer time, it had always been W W H W W W H (whole and half steps). Until we wrap our minds around this, and the fact that a guitar's strings are tuned 5, 5, 5, 4, and 5 half steps apart (standard), we will never be able to truly understand what we're doing with our fingers, move from string to string and know what is happening as we do so, and be doomed to repeat the same patterns we have grown accustomed to. To go beyond frets and fingers, I believe the solution is to link what we hear in our head with what we play, so that the limits are not what we know how to do physically with our hands, but that the limit is what we can imagine. The stronger that bond is, the more we will be able to play exactly what we want to hear.

{"body": "*/Thanks, but how does it make you FEEL?*\n\nNot to be that guy who refutes any suggestions with new information, but while you are right that I do have anxiety, I've contemplated and experimented with it enough to... go a level deeper (inb4 **D E P R E S S I O N**). I have somewhat come to the conclusion that it's not so much that if I say the wrong thing, I'll lose a friend. It's more that I am interested in being closer with the friends I have, but getting there is something that has to be done organically. If I were to explicitly describe what kind of friendship I wanted with a person, there is a strong likelihood that the act of explaining it will lower the chances of that happening because it seems so abrupt. I imagine it's like trying to persuade someone to do a task rather than command them. \n\nAs for alcohol, it's funny because when I said \"socially neutral\" activities, that included mostly clubs/bars/parties. People can be too busy to play a round of tennis everyday for 4 months but drop all plans the day of for a party. Senior year of high school and first year of university were heavy drinking years, but the magic wore off after you realize all you have in common with these people is the last party you were at together. I envy that you can casually drink with friends and not have it turn into a \"Look at me, I'm drinking\" affair. At the very least, I've come to terms with where I am currently in life, and slowly, I'm looking up to the future where times will be different.

{"body": "&gt;And though they have not yet been hailed as a victory, the massive protests in 2003 against the US invasion of Iraq have been much applauded by nonviolent activists!\r\n\r\nLet me say unequivocally I did not view the protests about the Iraq war to be nonviolence as such. I can't express my contempt for that kind of activism adequately without resorting to...well, without resorting to *satyagraha*, let me say. I swear that as I think of this particular issue, my hands are shaking. When I read the quoted quip here, my head spins. Neither did Gene Sharp praise these protests; he was quite explicit about it, saying it is nice to express yourself, but that's not nonviolence. Why get so upset about such a determination? *Because it is the thinking, or lack thereof, upon which nonviolence is chosen or ruled out, and in turn pertains to whether thousands die in Egypt, say, or hundreds.* Let me add, to be clear here just how deeply I \"question\" the prevailing activism in this regard: were one to take this issue *seriously*, to get genuinely upset about it, have no doubt that were one in an activist settings, this would be viewed as \"eccentric\", at least, and positively quashed, albeit in a \"peaceful\", back-channel way among the activist good ol' boys and girls who, well, can \"get real\" and get rid of anyone outside the usual thinking. The crisis is right in the center core of this very nerve and complex.\r\n\r\nThat is why there is a *crisis for thought* concerning nonviolence. There *really is*, and it's hard just to imagine what that could possibly mean. \r\n\r\nI viewed the rallies as pointless and much worse as serious degradations of nonviolence. I continue to hold that most P and J activism does a tremendous disservice to serious nonviolence. I believe it is riddled with layers and layers of a certain corruption in this regard. Around activists I tend to be afraid to say this as I fear I will get \"beaten up\", no, not physically, but in other ways. I honestly do believe that. You go in some directions and you get the message \"that is not done\". \r\n\r\nNonviolence is systematically degraded. Some of the kind of critique being used against nonviolence here is admirable in its very willingness to scratch the surface, to take a minority view, to question the status quo, and it is indeed quite a status quo. But it needs to scratch in the other direction. This has barely yet begun.\r\n\r\nThe crisis could be seen concerning the sanctions. This points to a failure to consider adequately the *essence* of violence. Recall that they killed 1.5 million and were a, if not the, chief factor prefiguring the rise of Bin Laden. The problems was that the sanctions were *essentially* violent, while they didn't involve dropping bombs. Yet, smarter than any smart bomb, the killed the most vulnerable in the population with some real discrimination. More than that, they were fucking brilliant \"bombs\" because they took place without people even knowing it.\r\n\r\nThis goes to the heart of the problem of the essence of violence, but that in turn goes to the problem of *essential thought*, that is, thought that is able to think of the *essence* of things: their being, what they *are*. This level of thought is systematically shut down in many ways. The problem of nonviolence, which is at once the problem of the sanctions, of Bin Laden, of Iraq, etc. lies right smack dab in the middle of this seeming obscure issue concerning thinking. \r\n\r\nI imagine someone saying: *Come on! \"Thinking...\" That's all whatever, we know what needs to change, no one's going to tell me I have to think, learn to think, learn anything new...I went \"left\" a long tme ago; I got one whole brain cell that's always leaning left. I now know it all, it's just a matter of strategy. And we all know that nonviolent stuff only goes so far! It's about p o w e r and just rattling off issue A, issue B, issue C. No new thinking here, no crisis for thought, and no one's going to bring up some obscure shit like that and make it out like it's in any way important...I'm not spending one second in the grips of some question to which I don't have the answers. I know the demons. I just wanna know **where they are...** *\r\n\r\nEDIT: I actually wrote \"but that's nonviolence\" and not \"that's *not* nonviolence\" concerning Sharp....\r\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305232231", "subreddit": "Anarchism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Doing 80-85 dmg at level 1 with your Q makes you a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSpell Order for me is usually:\n\nQ W Q E Q R  with the general rule of thumb being  R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E.  You use your E to proc your passive so your Q comes off cooldown faster, not for that thing to do much damage.  At level 2, you can pull off a Q W Q combo and bring most squishies to half life, so I do find that this is much better than E (just remember that, after your W, you need to walk towards them, or you won't be able to land another Q).  \n\nMasteries 9/0/21.  He needs as much CDR as he can get, and you don't get that with only 14 pts in utility.  Get some more points into that and a frozen heart will provide you with ~35% CDR already, which is very good to say the least.  \n\nYou should ideally only go back the first time when you have ~950gold so you can pick up shoes and tear at the same time and have a little extra for another pot.  Your goal should be to charge your tear as fast as you can so you can get your Q stronger.  You should very rarely get Sorcs unless you have a full on tank and the other team is not very CC heavy.  Most of the time in solo queue you will be taking on the role of an off tank since no one wants to tank and so you should ideally get merc treads most/all of the time.  \n\nAfter your early items, you should look at what their team is doing.  If they are AP or AD heavy, lean towards rushing Banshee's or Frozen Heart respectively.  If not, then see which one is killing your team the most and build towards that.  I prefer Frozen Heart and Glacial Shroud simply because it is more useful to Ryze (it gives more Mana and it has 20% CDR) and cheaper than building a catalyst, however, building a catalyst and shroud are very strong mid game options.  \n\nAP items work on Ryze, but it should be to stack RoA or to buy an Abyssal (if they're simultaneously AP heavy and stacking MR or something).  RoA works extremely well with his already considerable mana pool on top of his inherent tanky build.  If you're dealing with pubs, you might stomp them early game and they'll try to kill you late game, only to find that going through 3.5K HP is not exactly easy.  \n\nEarly Game:\n\nHardest thing about his early game is that you shouldn't be wasting your mana on last hitting unless you have to, and so you have to get used to his slow as balls autoattack.  If you can get last hits effectively, you will be able to dominate early game for the most part.  Your Q should be used to harass the enemy team, and so you should ideally pick someone with your lanemate that you will target (the one that can't heal preferably).  \n\nMelee and ranged creeps alike need to take one autoattack or E bounce before you can autoattack them after tower hits (like you said, 2 for melee, 1 for ranged).  Your harassment should be focused on preventing them from farming, and that's where you use your Q W Q E Q combo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305321491", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's more than experience, although enough experience in anything will get you very far in a lot of things in life. To be specific, you are asking a couple questions, actually. One is, how do you describe what it is you are hearing in concrete terms, and the other question is how do you play that on the guitar (and figure out what moving from string to string does to your movement in pitch).\n\n1) The key to describing what it is you are hearing (and not hearing it alone) is relative pitch. I use a cipher system with my students where the numbers correspond to the C major scale... For example, in the key of C, you have C = 1, D = 2, E = 3 and so on. Then you account for half steps and whole steps (a Major scale is W W H W W W H).\n\n2) When you hear something, find the first note of what it is you hear. Once you have that, move from there. This works best at first if you use simple melodies that don't jump around a lot (Mary Had a Little Lamb or something equally simple). What happens once you move in larger intervals and across multiple strings is you need to learn how your strings are tuned (in half steps, EADGBE is 5 5 5 4 5), so when you play from one string to another you need to factor in the pitch change you are getting that is not really something we visualize when our fingers don't move so much, like 1st fret 6E string to the 1st fret 5A string doesn't look like a big jump, but melodically it is a jump of 5 half steps. \n\nMoving around on the fretboard and across strings will never seem easy until you learn all the half steps between all of the notes you hear (question number #1) and the distances inherent in moving from one string to another (#2).\n\nThe purest goal of these exercises is to discern what you hear and know what your fingers should do to produce what it is before you have to guess. When you are able to hum something and play it without a wrong note, you've got it.

{"body": "This comic strikes me as an interesting representation of the way that the F7U12 community uses the various \"ending faces\". These are (at the moment, for the moment):\n\n[](/ohcrap \"\") [](/fu \"\")[](/futext \"\") [](/stare \"\")\n\nThe original rageguy (above, centre) has long been the forefront of the rage comics, and indeed began the exploitable 4 panel that we know today. Various situations of pain and misery, often caused by his arch-nemesis, [](/troll \"trollface\") served as plot elements for the humorous payoff of a very-relatable \"FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU\". The \"troll\" character could manifest in any number of ways, such as poop, traffic lights or females.\n\nAs the character of rageguy grew in popularity (in incubators such as 4chan) other faces manifested themselves from the various internet hive-minds. However, it was raisinface that would advance the genre of \"troll-to-payoff\" rage comics. Other genres do exist, such as the [\"Challenge Accepted\", \"stonerF7U12\" \"fuck that shit/awww yeah\" and \"Forever Alone (&amp; pun variants)\"], though those may be for a different discussion.\n\nRaisnface is primarily used to indicate intense fear and surprise. The addition to the cache of faces allowed the F7U12 builders to increase the scope of the situations they could address. Where rageguy is used in relation to direct trolls, the raisinface address surreptitious or sneaky trolls (a prime example being the above comic) where the troll is completely metaphorical. Raisinface represents a common feeling (as the rageguy does) of fear or uncomfortable realisation.\n\nOf nearly untraceable date-of-origin, raisinface remained in obscurity as a 4chan reaction face, and it is generally thought that his **I N C E P T I O N** as a rageface was the doing of the r/FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU community right here at reddit. As a result, he's remained very popular, due also to his humorous art, which allows us, in combination with our own independent empathy for the feeling he represents, to connect with the comic.\n\nStareguy is different. He represents a darker side of the rageface ending, and though he is of similar use to rageguy and raisinface, he is *actually* angry. The dark shading obscures his face, and the design may have been influenced by raisinface. \n\nAlso like raisinface, he toiled in obscurity for a long time, until a recent resurgence. He acts as an almost anti-punchline, representing actual hatred for the troll (and in many cases, the ignorant, unkind or incompetent). He evokes a feeling of seething revenge in message and design, making him very effective, and most likely will remain in the popular F7U12 lexicon for a long time.\n\nTL;DR the rage face repertoire has increased and has broadened the scope of situations that can be conveyed by F7U12 comics, and is a fascinating example of the hivemind creating and building new ways to explore what was once a simple concept.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305701030", "subreddit": "fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu", "score": 327, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm going to toss my own reply in here even though a few people have already answered.  Chords follow from harmonizing scales.  Scales can only have one of each numbered note in the sequence.  Doesn't matter what the interval distance is from the root, the fifth note in the scale is the 5th.\n\nThe situation gets trickier in certain applications.  The most common scale that gets referenced by #9, b9, #5 and b5 is the dminished whole tone scale, the 7th mode of melodic minor.  B C D Eb F G A B is the easiest example.  Harmonized normally, you clearly get a Bm7b5 (b9, b11, b13) chord, B D F A (C Eb G).  A more useful way to think of this scale, however, is to treat the Eb as a D#, and call it a B7 chord from the B D# A (1 3 b7), and then name the rest of the notes whatever is convenient, either #11 and b13 if you like those names, or b5 and #5 if you like those names, and you don't have much option for b9 and #9 as it makes no sense to have a chord with a major third and a minor third.  Most people just refer to this as an altered scale and the harmonized version as an altered chord (B7alt).\n\nSo hopefully that answers your first question.  The second question would be that since, no, you cannot technically have a chord with both b5 and #5, you'd just number the inversions however you were used to.  I prefer to just use slash notation (B7alt/D#). \n\nThis all falls apart when we talk about scales that aren't 7 notes.  Take a HW diminished scale, C Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Abb, Bbb, Cbb.  Yes, this is not the simplest way to write the scale, but we only use 7 letters so there isn't really a perfect way to do it.  And then, what are the intervals?  1, minor 2nd, minor 3rd, diminished 4th, diminished 5th, diminished 6th, diminished 7th, and diminished 8th?  So, I wouldn't worry too hard about the theory behind those scales.  We live in a musical system with 7 letters and most commonly scales with 7 notes and everything logical is constructed from that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305855580", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I find Cass to be a fun and fairly powerful character, though i hesitate to play her in ranked over more forgiving characters.\n\nOne her main downfalls is that Pre-6 she has almost no CC (unusual for an Ap char) making her very susceptible to jungle/roamer ganks. A small mistake/death early can really screw up your game (kind of like eve, but not as serious).However, if you ward up and know approximate jungle speed of most jungles you can mitigate this fairly effectively and focus on what Cass does best: 1v1.\n\n She is a kiting character, and does it better early game then anyone. I run flat AP quints, mpen reds, Mana regen/lvl yellows, ap/lvl blues. For starting items dorans ring or boots and 3 pots. If you can learn to predict/shepherd the opposing champion so that you land the majority of your Q's, you will be able to harass them out of the lane, and often get an early kill. The goal is to land 80+% of your Q's on the enemy champion. This is so key to Cass it cant be overstated. If Cass doesnt land her Q skill shot, she dies.\n In terms of laning, she has a good auto attack animation for early game farming, and if you do well you should be able to go back to base and buy a NLR and boots at aproximatly 10-12 minutes (The goal is to have boots 2, dorans ring, and a deathcap by 18 minutes). With AP runes and a NLR, one Q will clear creep waves. Her Q + E combo will out dmg most other harass  and give you some lane dominance. If you get the 18 min DC, you will be able to kill most mids in Q E R E Q combo, and most side lanes even easier. Basically this is when Cass has to win the game, early deathcap snowballing into wins at dragon, ganks on sidelanes etc.\n\nIn terms of play, she is fairly unique and fun due to her kiting/skill shot focus, but can sometimes go against teams that just hard counter her. Mostly champions with multiple gap closers.\n\nTLDR: I dont think she is bad, but i would generally not pick her in ranked. She is a 1v1 beast, but is unforgiving and vulnerable against coordinated teams. \n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305884698", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To clarify, a standard Go board is a matrix of 19x19 vertices, each of which can hold a single base-3 value.  Therefore, a board can represent 3^19x19 different values, or 1.74×10^172 .  This is just over 2^572 , which is 1.55x10^172 .  572 bits is a nibble over 71 bytes, meaning any 71 bytes of data can be expressed as exactly one unique Go board.  Since typical English messages don't require a full 8-bit byte but can be expressed in the reduced base64 (5-bit) encoding, that means a Go board can be used to express 95 characters, or a sentence of about 15 words (2/3 of a tweet).  In other words, a blog could be expressed through a series of Go boards using a very simplistic version of stenography.\n\n*Edit:* Since there are 3 values for each vertex, base64 becomes a little unwieldy; the following script uses a pseudo-base81 encoding of four base-3 vertices (similar to how a binary nibble maps to a single hex digit) to easily map text messages to their Go equivalents:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/f3p68wyy *(clearly this would be cooler if itself written in Go)*\n\n    $ ./goblog \"You're striving for harmony, and if you try to take too much, you'll come to grief.\"\n    O X X X X O X + X X O + + + X O X X +\n    + X + O X + + + + X X + O X X + X X X\n    + + X O + + X X O O X O + + X O O X X\n    + X O + + + + X + X + X O X + X X + +\n    + + + + X + X X X + + O X X + + X O O\n    O X O X + X O O X X X X O + O O + + +\n    + + X + + O X O O X X + O O + + + + X\n    O + + X + X + + + + + X X X O X O X +\n    X X O + + + + + X X + X X X + + X X X\n    O + + + + X X + X X O X + + + + + X X\n    + X X + + O X O + X X + O X + + + + X\n    X + X X O X + X O X + + + + + X O O O\n    X X O + X + O + X + X X + O O + + + +\n    + X X X O X O X + X X O + + + X O X O\n    O + X O O + + + + + X + O + X O X + X\n    O O O X + O X + + + + X X + X X O X +\n    + + + + X + X O X X + + X O + + X + O\n    X X + X + + O O X + + + + + + + + + +\n    + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +\n\n—*Michael Redmond, 9-dan*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1306046977", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

To get there I had to run up a hill and climb in and out of some giant 70s or 80s American car, possibly a Lincoln towncar, then run through what was like a cross between a subway station and an East German checkpoint. Something was after us, whatever was the power of the hellish third layer, but it lost power the further back to \"reality\" we got (the dream became less and less nightmarish the further we travelled).   \n\nThe layer before this more friendly thrid layer (AKA the second layer) was a post-apocolyptic wasteland like Chernobyl.

My dreams aren't usually violent. There was an overwhelming evil presence. I only touched the surface of that thrid layer, I can only imagine what was beyond. The rest of the dream was just getting as far away from that place as possible.

{"body": "Wow, thanks for that, you make me want to replay it.\nI can't remember if I got far enough to find out what the occuria were, I remember I had just went to some science lab and some big black guy with duel swords was there being a badass or something.\n\nI did actually enjoy the combat, it felt like I was programming an AI, it was awesome. I'm now usually very very disappointed when I see shittier versions of the gambit system in other games, I don't think any let you be so precise. However, I don't remember there being many good side quests, just a lot of monster hunting. Sure beating a boss is kind of fun but it gets repetitive if their isn't fun exploration. \n\nMy favorite in FF is actually ff8. I thought it had near perfect dialogue, every character felt so, real, so true to themselves. It had AMAZING dialogue for the random NPCs though. If you talked to a guard for example he wouldn't just be like \"Hey I heard if you use Cure it heals you\" or some other BS method to tell you something about the game. Instead they would actually talk about their lives \"Oh man its my first day on guard duty, I'm so nervous.\" or something. It was very engrossing and made me want to talk to the NPCs instead of making it seem like a chore where otherwise I would miss information. It also had amazing backstory with the whole sorceress wars, and the monsters coming from the MOON and stuff. So much so that it warranted a giant essay on ultimecia and how she must have been harassed when she was younger because she was a sorceress which probably led to her insane time compression goal. Which also, she must have known would fail but she did anyway. \n\nAlso laguna was just an amazing character, and the game itself was just very funny while quite deep and sad at parts as well. Something none of the other FFs did intentionally (except maybe ff9, but I can't remember to much of it). I say intentionally because of accidentally hilarious scenes like the \"HAHAHA\" moment in FFX. Squall also changed A L O T during the course of the game and is a very relatable main character. He isn't some guy whos sad because he has memory issues, and he isn't some epic thief whos actually an alien or something. Hes just a normal guy who gets unwillingly THROWN into responsibility. Sorry got sidetracked there, this should be about ff12 lol...\n\nAnyway, thanks for the review I have to play it again now. Although I think the game is still lacking compared to FF8 in dialogue. FF8 was pretty event driven as well with there reaction to events being the main method you got to know them (none of the characters had major backstory side quests really). But it did it so great. You had strange love triangles (quistis and squall in the beginning). Emotional events like when irving was too scared to take a shot at the sorceress. Selphie's home garden being blown up. There were a lot of emotionally impacting events going on that made it very interesting, I don't remember things like that in FF12 except in the beginning. After you freed that captain guy it got duller. Still though maybe if you replay the game after beating it, it makes it better like you said. \n\nAlso main character being a kid was a terrible idea. I heard that originally the pirate guy was supposed to be the main character but they threw in the kid because they thought people would be able to relate to that.

{"body": "I believe intervals are probably the most confusing and important concept in music. I'll try my best to explain it.\n\nAn interval is a measurement of the difference between two notes. When we play a song in one key, say C major, and then play it in G major, the voice of the key changes but not the intervals that make up the melody of the song. So when we change keys, all the notes go up or down an equal amount-- that is unless we change the type of key. It's weird, but listening to Happy Birthday in C major followed by listening to it in G major you could easily tell that it's the same song only higher. But if you switch from C major to C minor, the song would be in the same voice, but what it's saying would sound significantly different--you would still be able to tell it's Happy Birthday, but it would sound sour or ironic, a touch sadder. That's because when you change from a major key to a minor key or vice versa, or to a blues key, or when you change modes to dorian or phrygian (modes are kinda like scales, but not exactly) what you are changing is the intervals. The music sounds different because the difference in pitch between the tones in the melody are no longer preserved, and they change unequally.\n\nThat difference between tones is what gives music it's musicality, not the tones themselves, so that's why intervals are so darned important.\n\nNow the reason they're confusing is because you have minor and major seconds and thirds and they don't always line up to the number of frets on your guitar, and why does it take seven frets to make a perfect fifth and not just five frets?\n\nTry thinking of it this way: there are two intervals that make up each scale position, a minor and a major--except for the fourth (IV) and fifth (V) scale positions, those tricky guys have just one \"perfect\" position and they share the interval called the tritone (also called flat fifth, augmented fourth, etc.) So since there are more than one interval per scale position, there is not going to be a one to one to one correlation between the number of frets used, the name of an interval, and a scale position described.\n\nNormally the scale positions are based on the C major scale, so the intervals named \"major\" and \"perfect\" are going to be the intervals (difference in tone) that make up that C major, or any other major scale. So a major scale, whether C or any other key, is going to be made up of a Root (also called a Unison), and the interval distances of a Major Second, a Major Third, a Perfect Fourth, a Perfect Fifth, a Major Sixth, a Major Seventh, and an Octave. You've seen this before written as \"I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII\" when naming the intervals in a scale, or written as \"Root, Whole Tone, Whole Tone, Semi-Tone, Whole Tone, Whole Tone, Whole Tone, Semi-Tone\" when describing the distance between each.\n\nRemember how some scale positions have a flat or minor version? I think I may have mentioned the minor scale before. In a minor scale flatten the third (among other things) to make it sound sadder--that interval is called the \"minor third.\" That means that ignoring everything else and just describing the position known as \"third\" (III) in that scale, it will fall a semi-tone lower or flatter than that same position would in a major scale. Thus, in a minor scale, III becomes iii. Now the same thing also happens to the VI and the VII in a minor scale. So compare the major to the minor.\n\nMajor scale = R W W S W W W S = I,II,III,IV,V,VI,VII,VIII = Root, major second, major third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, major sixth, major seventh, and octave\n\nMinor scale = R W S W W S W W = I, II,iii,IV,V,vi,vii,VIII = Root, major second, minor third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, minor sixth, minor seventh, octave.\n\nNote the II, IV, V, and VIII positions are the same distance from the root in both scales. Again, the 3rd, 6th, and 7th positions are where the difference in distance lies... Those differences and distances are what intervals, and ultimately music, are all about.\n\nI'm just now starting to get them all memorized on the fretboard. The trick is to learn the relationships. On the lowest 3 strings you can pick any note, go two frets higher and two strings up and that will be your original note's octave. Two frets higher and one string up is your fifth. Play the original note (root) plus the fifth, plus the octave and you have a power chord. It changes from the G to the B string. You know how you have to tune the B to the fourth fret of the G, instead of the fifth? That's because the interval between all the strings on the guitar are the same except for that pair.

{"body": "The thing is, I respect that. It's kinda sad, looking through your posts you actually seem like an interesting guy. Yes I'm an undergraduate, but if I knew nothing about the modules I take, I wouldn't still be on the course. (I passed Materials with a 2:1 classification last semester... really not that bad)\n\nThe thing is, I didn't say \"I demand all of these things now!!!!11one\" - I was responding to the OP's question about 'what could you live without in your ideal car'. Much like your ideal girlfriend, or your ideal job, **your ideal car probably doesn't actually exist in the real world**. But that's not to stop me throwing together some ideas for improvement, and there's no reason why I can't speculate about what will be used for lightweight structures in the future, or bitch about shit which personally is of no help to my driving experience.\n\nYou know the thing about technology? - It trickles. Any material starts off life in a Petri dish, or on a tensile destructive-test rig, in tiny and insanely expensive amounts that are only any good for labs to write analysis on. Soon afterwards, chemical engineers find economic ways to produce half a tonne per batch rather than 50g, and soon after that this exotic material is used in super-high-end applications by the military. Next, maybe someone uses it for some miscellaneous non-critical component in a production supercar, then eventually larger components, maybe finally structural elements if it can be 'trusted'. Now more manufacturing plants gradually spool up, and the price drops over many years, until it's gone from exotic to commonplace. This is the story of almost every plastic ever, and now we're seeing it happen all over again with a vast array of new materials.\n\n.\n\nNow then. If steel is so unassailable, you won't mind my asking why the most heavily stressed lightweight vehicles mankind make - intercontinental ballistic missiles that rip out of Earth's atmosphere and back in again at mach 14, the Space Shuttle, every aircraft from Cessna 172s to fighter jets via every commercial airliner in production, even the old ones - avoid it like the plague? It's heavy, that's a fact. If you don't believe it can ever be beaten by still-developing technologies - technologies which are currently laid-up by hand, but mass production is getting better all the time - you might as well be saying *\"Nothing will ever replace beechwood suspension, it's perfect. Period. Now let me build carriages in peace\"*\n\nWhat can be done for lightweight aircraft can give serious weight-saving benefits by lending inspiration to cars. Yes, they are totally different beasts (with no crumple zones and almost guaranteed death on impact), but the materials they use deal with immense stress despite their light weight - if you think the best of both worlds can't be engineered, you lack vision and common sense. If you think expensive materials don't get cheaper as the technology matures, you're awfully pessemistic, but maybe you should crunch some numbers on how preformed carbon fibre components have dropped in price since they first came to market. In time, they will be viable.\n\nAs for fiberglass, what are you talking about steel frames? I said non-load-bearing bodywork. Maybe you should research racing yacht construction, it'll give you more faith in both fiberglass and composites to learn how an enormous monocoque structure and a slender mast can cope with immense water stresses in the storms of the Antarctic Ocean. They stopped using steel for that years ago, and the forces at play are orders of magnitude beyond anything the highest-end car knows.\n\nBy the way, there's *no such thing as* **\"ceramic composite plastics\"**. There's *composite plastics*, and there's *artificial ceramics*, but that's comparing apples to oranges and *I'm starting to wonder if you know what you're talking about.* Did you know ceramic materials are replacing titanium-aluminium alloys for large blades in gas turbine (jet) engines - not just research, available commercially right now? Do you really think that has nothing to offer the high-stress components of the combustion engine?\n\nNo, it's not a magic bullet, it needs research and development to be properly scaled to mass production and that doesn't happen overnight. R E S E A R C H A N D D E V E L O P M E N T. Did I mention that I was merely speculating on the future?\n\n.\n\n&gt;its a driver aide to **keep goombas like you from smashing into everything you see**.\n\nThat's a lovely strawman, you have no idea how much driving experience or otherwise I have (clue: a fair few miles), and for the record I've never had an accident. Again, my current car does just fine without it, so I added it to my list of things I can live without. \n\nI know you have no idea what a Citroën supermini is, beyond *\"some European faggot car with less than 650hp\"*, so I'll let you off for thinking I smash into everything I see through my own stupidity. I have quite a low-powered set of wheels, and that's just fine with me, including for my ideal car (which was the point of the thread) - I don't care about straight-line acceleration, I want great handling, light weight, and small size.\n\n&gt;**Your car probably runs like garbage** and **pollutes 10x more than engines twice the size and power.**\n\nAgain, I don't think you'd know, but if that were true it'd fail the UK annual MOT emissions test. It's never failed. As it stands, it's in the second-lowest emissions bracket for road tax and a heck of a lot less polluting than many other larger-engined cars.\n\nLook, let me make this clear:\n\n**Leave me alone now.
