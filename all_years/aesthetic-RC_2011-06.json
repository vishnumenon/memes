I've changed some other things, like show items (space), but the important gameplay (read: functional) ones (stuff you saw in those videos) are covered with skill bindings, weapon swap, run/walk and standing still.\n\nI recommend you use at least QWERASDF for skills and see what you like. You should also get used to using left click + stand still. I'm not sure if you know or not, but standing still basically turns your left click into a right click. Hammerdins, for example, need Concentrate on their right skill, so this forces Blessed Hammer on the left click. But if you left click on the ground, you walk. If you stand still, though, you throw out a hammer when you click. No need to find a name to click on. Whirlwind should stick to left click + standing still as well (hold left click to walk/run, tap shift to whirl).\n\nThis might be more info than you wanted :D, but it seems like a lot of people in this subreddit are pretty new to the game, and everyone should know about how awesome standing still is :)\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1306910375", "subreddit": "Diablo", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Therefore, on the violin, each note letter is played by one finger (i.e. A is open, Bb and B are first finger, C and C# are second, etc.) which means that the four fingers plus the open sting cover a fifth (A-O, B-1, C-2, D-3, E-4). \n\nOn guitar, each finger covers one fret, or semitone. 5 semitones = A fourth.

It is one of the simpler things about English. \n\nNow to the first paragraph.. The \"assist\" files in question.. Some programs have it.. Some don't.. If it is bought and paid for software and it is very popular and a lot of people have it.. Then you are likely to have something like that for it.. But digging through it and where each and every one puts it? It is just simpler to do a damn google search for the issue you are having.. \n\nAlso a laptop.. and computer? They are both \"computers\".. One is a desktop not to be confused with windows desktop where your icons and taskbar is at.., and the other..  A laptop. A laptop = highly portable.. A desktop.. Not so much. \n\nUsenet is for people who know what they are doing and that is usually in technical arenas.. Things an average user will have no need to get into and no use in trying to understand. Nor are pc support groups. Most of those people don't know what the fuck they are talking about half the time and can lead you down some shitty paths. \n\nSupport lines are a last resort and even they are unlikely to help with the most complicated issues. \n\n&gt;As you can see, aid is uncomplicated to discover\n\nIn some instances this statement can be true.. But in most? It isn't.. Finding a solution to a problem requires some basic understanding of software and possibly hardware and then building onto that base with more knowledge of what is wrong and how to fix it. Depending on the issues at hand it can be relatively simple or it can be complicated to the extreme. \n\nAll in all.. There is no virus or no this or that.. That will actually blow up your computer. If push comes to shove and you can't fix the software side.. Guess what you can reinstall the o/s.. If your hard drive is fried.. Replace it. Memory is fucked up? Replace it. But how do you know that it is??? That is where the basic understanding comes in.. Computer shops these days are like how auto shops use to be. Well still are to some degree. They tell you all kinds of shit that is wrong to get you to spend more and more to fix it when all it really needed was a 50 dollar tune up. At times its cheapest to replace a failed part on a computer.. The older the computer the more expensive this can get. It just really all depends on what is wrong and the situation at hand.. \n\nIf you or any one else has a computer issue.. Feel free to send me a message and I can point you in the right direction.. This article will just have you scratching your head and running in circles and 2 weeks later you will be in the same boat as you were prior.. Or worse.

We don't know who the fuck you are or what you want unless you tell us.  \n\n- I'm sure you're, like, totally best friends with such n' such attorney but I still need your full goddamn name to tell him who is calling. \"Sarah\" won't do. He probably has 200+ Sarah's he consults for. Don't get all huffy and offended, just say your full name. \n\n- Have a nearly debilitating thick accent? If so, that's fine. But I'm going to have to ask you to repeat your name in order to understand what you are saying. Spelling it out helps. I can't call the head attorney and say \"Uhhhh, I have Arr-neee-triiii-olia?? on the line for you\" because I will look like an ass and get yelled at. It's just an accent. Get over it and try to help me out here.\n\n- No matter how many times you tell me that you need to speak to Mr. Soandso, if they are not in their office then I can't get them on the phone for you. Sorry, I must be the only person in the world unable to do this. \n\n- However, most of the time \"So and so is not available at the moment\" means they don't want to talk to you right then. Asking me where they are will get you no where. I'm not sitting on that person's floor and we don't install tracking devices on our employees. Also, how in the hell would knowing they are taking a piss or buying coffee at the moment really help you? You still have to call back!\n\n- Yes, our fax machine is ON.\n\n- Solicitors, you are fooling no one. No one is that happy to be calling a law firm. It's the first dead give away. The overly excited, cool guy attitude and acting like you are on first name terms with the owner is laughable, especially when the men the firm is named for have been dead for 60 years. You just want to sell toner and I'm not putting you through. \n\n- When you come in, go to the receptionist and say \"Hello, I'm here to see ____ . My name is ______ .\" This is the fastest, easiest way to get what you want. Coming in with big sunglasses on, yelling on a cell phone, glaring down at me and motioning with your hands is not going to make know your name and who you're meeting with, no matter how important you believe yourself to be. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1307049012", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

(C) In the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt \n&gt;targeting Assistant Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin \n&gt;Naif (MbN) (ref A), King Abdullah and other officials \n&gt;responded swiftly and decisively to reassure the public that \n&gt;the Prince was well, and reaffirm the Kingdom's commitment to \n&gt;combating terrorism.  The press and the public universally \n&gt;condemned the attack, characterizing it as a direct assault \n&gt;against the Saudi state and Islam.  A more measured reaction \n&gt;in the blogosphere hints at how this most recent incident \n&gt;might affect domestic debate on the proper approach to \n&gt;dealing with domestic terrorism, with some calling for \n&gt;continued leniency and emphasis on reform and others arguing \n&gt;the Saudi government is being too lax.  The attack seems to \n&gt;have strengthened the already positive public reputation of \n&gt;Prince Mohammed bin Naif, and many religious-minded Saudis \n&gt;will see his miraculous survival, almost unscathed, as a sign \n&gt;of Divine protection and blessing for his efforts against \n&gt;Al-Qaeda and other extremists.  For his part, Prince Mohammed \n&gt;has told us the attack has only strengthened his resolve, and \n&gt;convinced him that the Kingdom's counter-terrorism strategy, \n&gt;combining firmness with understanding, is effective and \n&gt;should con\ntinue.

His rockets are extremely effective at harassing people under their tower once the creepwave is gone, he excels at clearing creepwaves, and his passive ensures that you never have to stop.\n\nI encourage you to play heimer on a push oreinted team, securing your blue buff and a tear.  Skill order is R W Q E with one point in E at level 1 if you prefer having the stun, skip it until later if you aren't afraid of melee.  Push extremely aggressively with your team, you want to be a machinegun of creep destruction and champion harassment.  Use your turrets as a fallback location, they should be placed outside of tower range and far enough away as to be behind your team.  This will make it ridiculously difficult for the enemy team to bash your team away from their tower.\n\nHeimer is weak right now because the current meta isn't about pushing mid.  He could become an allstar at any moment if a few other complimenting champions are changed, giving him a better team to fit into.

The vowels probably have an even broader range of realization--ɪ or ɨ for i, for instance, or u for ɯ, and ɑ or æ for a.\n\nI've gone ahead and gone with only five phonemic vowels to keep the phoneme inventory from being too large, and because I have a bias towards consonants myself.

For the onset, either a nasal, a stop, a stop and a fricative, a fricative, or nothing. For the nucleus, a vowel, obviously, and for the coda, a single nasal, stop, or fricative.\n\nAnyway, I'm just throwing out all of the above as one proposal, so make of it what you will. Once we do have the phoneme inventory and syllable structure nailed down, I might see if I can't throw together some kind of random word generator in Python that will make building the vocabulary easier.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1307239401", "subreddit": "MakeALang", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;4.) Our tech services are contracted through Support.com, which is nothing more than a group of professional checklist followers. Their method of \"fixing\" computers is to remotely connect and run an automatic repair program, and if it doesn't work, they give up and give you a 70% refund. Even though I am more certified than the clowns on the other end, I'm not allowed to actually do anything to the computer.\n\nI came here to say that I was one of the SEs who does your Tech Depot Services. Some things to address:\n\n1) There are two kinds of SEs, Attach and Break Fix. Most of the ones still on Attach haven't been trained to and aren't expected to know very much beyond doing the checklist. These are probably the dumb ones you talk to. They do new PC setups, and tuneups, and that's about it. They are not allowed to go outside the checklist on those services at all. But there may be some lemons in Break Fix. Break Fix were selected and trained for more; e.g., they are the ones who do Diagnose and Repairs (i.e. virus removals) and other such complex things, and they know more than any given ODA. You know as much as or more than most SEs? That's great. Feel free to collaborate with us. I liked it when you guys did that. Also, I knew more about your end of the operation than most ODAs do. If you can do the services, you should get into SDC. \n\n2) Please stop calling to see if a work order is done. You have the computer. Refresh the hotlist and check. If it is done we will have marked it Finished so you can check and approve it. If it is not marked Finished, it is not done. Use the chat to talk to the SE who's actually working on it, instead of calling some random person who will have to talk to that SE anyway to find out what's going on, and who now is not working on another machine, slowing the whole operation down further. Sometimes the SE is working on other computers at the same time, and did not know that yours was done scanning/rebooting/opening a window, so just poke them in chat and they'll get on it. \n\n3) If you cannot connect a computer for service, before you call us:   \n&gt;Infected? Go to Safe Mode with Networking, then continue if you can't connect.  \nFirewall?  \nStart &gt; [Run] &gt; cmd\ninetcpl.cpl (Internet Properties)  \nConnections Tab &gt; LAN Settings &gt; Lower two unchecked!  \nStart &gt; [Run] &gt; cmd   \nipconfig /release   \nipconfig /renew   \n[Try to get online]  \nnetsh i i r r  \nnetsh winsock reset  \n[Reboot; try to get online]  \nReseat cable.  \nTry new cable.  \n[Try to get online]  \nGo to Control Panel &gt; Network Connections (or Run &gt; control netconnections) &gt; Right-click relevant connection &gt; Properties &gt; Internet Protocol v4 &gt; Properties &gt; Make sure everything is set to Automatically etc.\nWireless? On the right network?  \nAre other computers online?  \n\nThese things will almost always fix it, and that's one less time we'll have to spell ipconfig to you. \n\n4) Put the laptops on AC power. Even if the battery is full, it may go into a power-saving mode without the AC power, which involves slower performance. Power = faster service.\n\n5) If you call to get service started on a work order and mention that you fixed some routine problem before calling us, we may not say it, but we love you. \n\n6) Make sure we get the Windows password. It should be where it belongs in the work order form, not stuck in the chat. This way we can reboot and autologin without copying it in. Please? :3\n\n7) Stop telling customers to call us for every technical problem they have. We cannot help them unless they have a service or service plan. You will only make them mad at you because they think that we are you. Also, don't send us [Protection Performance Plan customers](http://jack.is/tech-support/stories/ifiargue.php). That's not us. \n\n8) Do not submit work orders with the service questions left blank or all the same thing. They are different questions and we need the information. We will send it back.\n\n8b) Stop submitting work orders saying the computer is \"full of popup viruses\" only for us to connect to a perfectly clean computer. Did you connect the right one? By the way, we can tell if you already ran MBAM. Thanks. ;) You should run CCleaner instead so MBAM has less to scan through. \n\n9) Get that thumb drive out of there. We have to report those. \n\n10) If we've been troubleshooting for a good while and the SE says there's nothing we can do, it's true. Especially if the SE suddenly got confident about it, they probably got that answer from a Tech Lead. No, you can't talk to the TL. \n\n10b) We can troubleshoot the internet connection for 10 minutes. After that, we have to recommend a **Restore, Optimize and Protect**. I didn't follow this rule and I don't think anyone else did, either, because 10 minutes isn't really long enough to go through the basics I listed, plus some other things to check, when I have to spell ipconfig and netsh over a bad phone connection to someone who doesn't understand the phonetic alphabet. \n\n11) Learn the god damn NATO phonetic alphabet. If I give you S as in Sierra, I should not hear \"F or S?\" If I can use the phonetic alphabet fluently and without the \"S as in\" part, you get extra imaginary bonus points. \n\nYou already do/don't do all these things? Awesome. Tell your ODA buddies, help us out. \n\nI've overheard the stuff you guys deal with from customers and sups over there. You have my sympathies.

For the major scale, I just remember this pattern \"R2212221\", where R=root note/tonic &amp; the numbers correspond to the number of 1/2 steps (frets/keys) apart each note is.  Other scales have their own patterns (natural minor is R2122122, and blues scale is R321132).\n\nWhile it's easier to play on guitar, it's easier to explain/learn on piano, IMO, but here is the idea in C Major:\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n    R 2 2 1 2 2 2 1\n\nAnd also E, for comparison:\n\n    E F# G# A B C# D# E\n    R 2  2  1 2 2  2  1\n\nAnyway, just something to play with.

{"body": "My Items:\n\nStart with Tome and a HP pot.  I think your items are perfectly viable, however, but it does matter how well you can farm and hat's not something I believe you've addressed.  \n\nI go back when I have ~1300gold or if they force me back and try to get boots and revolver.  At this point, I have lane sustainability and, if my tower isn't broken (it usually isn't), then I should be able to dominate the lane since I'll be around lvl 9 by then.\n\nMy items afterwards are going to be Rabadon's, followed by Zhonya's, or I finish my WotAs and potentially go for another Revolver for increased sustainability in team fights.  Rylai's is an attractive choice on him as well since he lacks CC besides his pool and since he scales off the HP portion of it too, but the cost makes me wary about it and my games are usually decided before I scrounge up the money for it.\n\nAlso, never be afraid to buy defensive items and never be constrained in your item choice.  If that Leblanc mid is nuking you like no other, don't hesitate to buy a Negatron Cloak instead of the components for your hat.  If that Caitlyn somehow got farmed enough to screw you over, buy a chainmail.  You're no good to your team if you're dead, and you should much rather get items that make you useful as a harasser than as a glass cannon.  \n\n\nMy Build:\n\nI do the standard thing with maxing Q, but I max E second.  I feel like the idea of using pool a lot isn't very good in the first place, and you should never be in a position where you need to use it for more than a second or two.  Also, by not getting many points into it, you might feel less incumbent to rely on it to get away.  It is a get out of jail free card, but it's not entirely free, and if you're pooling too much, the 22% HP it costs might easily be worth more than an autoattack or two by the enemy team.  \n\nMy Playstyle:\n\nAs with my items, I want to stress that you should never be constrained to play the same way for all your games.  If you are facing a tough opponent, then you play passive.  If they for some reason decided to put an easier person mid, then you play aggressive.  It depends on who you're up against (Cait/Brand vs. Teemo/MF for instance where the former are more formidable and the latter are more manageable) and you should deal with that accordingly.\n\nEarly Game-\n\nIf you have easy opponents, go in for a few Qs and most noobs think that you can do it all the time and tend to start playing passive.  Your Q doesn't do much damage until lvl 2 or 3, though, so I would suggest just using it to last hit until it gets those ranks since the damage from minion aggro and enemy autoattacks doesn't really justify using it against them until that point.\n\nMid Game-\n\nYour Q is up all the time, use it to harass, but also be mindful to heal yourself back as well.  Your job is to farm and to deny their farm but, if its a choice between the two, your gold is more important than denying theirs most of the time.  In team fights, you throw your R W Q E combo but never \n\nLate Game-\n\nTry to build tankier at this stage because you won't be doing as much damage anymore.  If you do well, they'll target you because you're the carry.  If you didn't do so hot, they'll still target you for being annoying mid game.  Your damage output realistically caps once you get your hat and another AP item.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1307584047", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Do I write down African American?\n\nYou must be a white guy and never had to seriously consider this on a form before if you have to ask this question. That explains a lot about the privilege and anger in your entire post actually.\n\nBut if you want to ask a serious question about what to put down, I'd be happy to help.

{"body": "&gt;costs are a result of reaction to surveillance as opposed to the surveillance itself\n\nThen by your definition, surveillance couldn't affect anyone because you're limiting it to a basic definition of secretly watching someone without any direct contact. The harm comes from how the information \"learned\" is acted upon. It's like saying, fire doesn't burn you, you putting your hand in the fire burned you. Fire has never harmed an innocent american.\n\n&gt;I'm leery of accepting vague and unsubstantiated claims.\n\nOnce again, it took 5 seconds to clear this up. Read the article. Google the name of the victim \"Gulet Mohammed\" and please look at any of the infinite numbers of articles available.\n\n&gt;his random travels across the middle east are precisely the sort of actions that should be surveilled.\n\nDo you have any conception of how terrorist cells work? [Oh wait. Google cleared that up within 2 seconds as well.](http://www.slate.com/id/1008311/) People visiting random places in the middle east should not be an indication that they are a threat, as there are NUMEROUS reasons for visiting the middle east.

You've made a very naive, weak point that is intended to provoke people. When they take time to discuss their thoughts, you disregard it because you only want one sort of proof: anecdotal evidence. It's basic knowledge, but I feel that I need to explain that this is not the only way to disprove a statement. The fact that the system we live in (and that most governments operate in) makes it so that you are always committing a crime means that you are never technically innocent. So you can always be damaged by an authority watching you. That is why it is relevant.\n\nThis is why I hate r/politics. There is no discussion present. It's people such as yourself that adopt some sort of incredibly stupid viewpoint, challenge the internet, and then refuse anything brought to the table by the people that try to present an alternative. It's the Tea Party Mentality. It's the Westboro Baptist Church. It's late 90's message board  behavior. You're only purpose is to provoke. You don't want to learn something. You want to feel superior, which is why you love leaving snarky comments on people that insult you. Whether you like it or not, you are a troll.\n\nHad you actually wanted to entertain a discussion, you would have posted something closer to \"Does government surveillance really harm innocent American's? and then posted your own thoughts. Instead, you asked for people to fight you. **Well I took the troll bait, and an innocent kid getting the shit beat out of him due to faulty surveillance meets your requested criteria for proving your ignorant ass wrong.

{"body": "Good evening! \n\nShort answer: \nThe intervals in the Maj7 chord go Root, Major third, Perfect fifth, Major seven. \nIn a dominant 7th chord (when you see C7 and so forth) the intervals between the notes in the chord go Root, major third, perfect fifth, flattened seventh. \nThe difference is that the dominant 7 chord's 7th note is a semitone lower than a major seventh, it's a minor seventh.\n\nLong answer: We can use scales to make chords. Each note in a scale can be the root of a chord in a progression. You make chords by adding intervals relative to your chosen root for each chord. For instance the most basic type of chords are triads. The key Cmajor goes as follows:\n\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nThese traids are made by playing every other note until you have three notes. If C is your root, then skip a note, grab one, skip a note grab one until you have 3 notes. These will be C, E and G; 1, 3 and 5 AKA C major! The first chord in the key. Let's do this from D...\n\n\nD E F G A B C D          (This is D Dorian: C major scale from D)\n\nIf we do the same thing and take 1, 3 and 5, we end up with D, F and A AKA D minor! This is the second chord in the scale. Do this for the rest of the chords on a notepad. You will get E minor, F major, G major, A minor and B minor b5.\n\nNow what if we went a note further than a triad? How about if we take the 1, the 3, the 5 AND the 7? We get a seventh chord. Depending on which chord you're playing in which key; you will end up with different 7ths. \n\n \nC D E F G A B C\n\nThe first 7th chord in Cmajor has these notes\n\n\nC E G B      (CMaj7)\n\nA dominant seven chord is found within the major scale as a chord stemming from the 5th note of the scale. \n\n\nG A B C D E F G             C major from the 5th note (G Mixolydian)\n\nThe chord taken from here will have the notes G B D and F. This is a dominant 7th chord. As you can see when you take the notes from Cmajor to build your chord, the 7th note is B. A B is a semitone lower than C. When you take the notes from G using the possible notes within the Cmajor scale, your 7th note is F. F is a tone lower than G. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1307723506", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's would be understandable violence, but what will the effects be? Would it not make things worse? The dream of a hopeless violence is another prison for your dreams. \n\nBut beyond that is the most important thing (IMO): the people arriving at a new consciousness. Do you want to know what you really need to do most of all? This is my opinion, of course. But I think you should wait to protest for the time being. There are several reasons, the main two are as follows:\n\nWith the toppling of Mubarak, other governments are pulling the triggers faster and harder to prevent their being overthrown. \n\nbut more importantly:\n \nYour main goal should not be to protest at all right now. It should be one thing, and the others follow (although nonviolence has to be affirmed as well):  I N T E R N E T. Some years of improving internet, and then begin to protest in earnest, something like that, massive strikes, totally nonviolent, with much shared dreams, consciousness and especially *freedom of the mind* through the Internet. \n\nThis is just what appears to me to be important.\n\n\n\nIf you want real success, you should spend some years doing nothing but improving connectivity. Making \"underground\" internet cafes. Starting a movement: not to protest yet, but a movement only to acquire cheap computers by the thousands and thousands. If you want to change things, the internet is the thing you need most of all.\n\nThen consciousness will arise and become strong, dreams will grow and the obvious will become more obvious. \n\nIt is here that the activists of other parts of the world can help you, but also may be \"dropping the ball\" (failing). \n\nYou must arrive at new consciousness. If you protest in old consciousness, too much of the old ways will come along with you and your only unification will be anger and pain. \n\nWhen you talk of deceiving pigs, you should remember that language like \"pigs\" is part of the spirit of violence. The \"pig\" is evil, but really is just a man or woman who is as trapped as you, but maybe more ignorant. Ultimately you must understand them. Do not say \"forgive\" because to \"forgive\" is a mistake in a way, as the forgiven is always held to be \"really a pig\". You must reach *understanding*, and from that comes true forgiveness. As your consciousness and dreams grow, you come to see them for what they are: simple, poor and very violent people. They may not be \"poor\" in terms of money, but they are poor in their hearts and they, too, are trapped.\n\nYou should have INTERNET and pamphlets and \"story tellers\" for the illiterate who go around telling stories of things that are important. Wired and wired and wired, mini-connections, some kind of satellite connection or something, any way to extend connections, to give access to the Internet. Could organizers use this? Yes. But more than that, people should be looking at *anything*: your goal is to teach the mind of a \"clickable reality\". Freedom to look, read, laugh, cry, see the world through the internet. But not just to organize. Not to make web sites about \"the pigs\": no, just to BROWSE. This is the most radical thing of all. It is a taste of freedom that blossoms in the mind. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1307816446", "subreddit": "Anarchism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You have requested that we review \nthis action for compliance with applicable HNXY Bylaws.\n\nOur review of the HNXY Bylaws indicates that the sole body empowered to remove an \nelected officer of the School from his/her position is the Membership by a two-thirds majority \nvote.  HNXY Bylaws §§ 5.01.04, 5.03.4.  Indeed, the latter section expressly states:  “A twothirds majority vote is need for the removal of the elected school officers and Directors.”\n\nWe understand that the five members seek to justify the Board’s purported removal of \nPrincipal Wang by reference to HNXY Bylaw § 6.05.6, which refers to the ability of the Board \nby a two-thirds majority vote to “impeach” school officers.\nThe standard use of the term “impeach,” is as an equivalent to an indictment or bringing \nof charges.  Thus, whereas the HNXY Bylaws permit the Board to bring charges against a school \nofficer, the power of removal appears to reside exclusively with the School’s Members.\n\nIn our opinion, equating the power to “impeach” with the power to remove would do \nviolence to the letter and spirit of the HNXY Bylaws.  It is a standard rule of contractual and \nstatutory construction that use of distinct terms reflects the assignment of distinct meanings, i.e., \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1308362152", "subreddit": "hxcsny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Don't know if you read my post the other day on sexualizing dates; I've been getting phone numbers and dates regularly in the last 20 months but I only close one in five. It's absolutely maddening. \n\nMy compliments to you for keeping up the pressure and pushing on. But you know, your life is not going to change unless you continue the fight. \n\nThe best advice I can give you, which has already been given by others here, is to get some coaching from a guy who knows what he's doing. You need some detailed feed-back so you can start to change whatever needs changing immediately. \n\nBelieve me, coaching may be expensive, but the money will be WELL spent. I got coaching a few times, and it's kicked my game in the right direction; before the coaching I was fumbling in the dark. Otherwise, if there's a local lair where you live, try to talk to some of the top guys there if you didn't do so already and get them to help you.\n\nI'll get flak and be downvoted for saying this, but consider getting a microphone so your wings can actually hear where it is you fuck up in the conversation. I did and it has helped tremendously. Some people will say that you'll be in the grey or dark zones of ethics for doing so, but to use the same words it's equally 'unethical' from destiny's side that a person who seems like a good guy should be unhappy with life, struggle H A R D to change it where other people just sit on their asses and do nothing, and yet still get absolutely nothing in return but frustrations! That's where I've been at in the last 20 months, but it's a plateau I finally sense that I'm about to leave.

{"body": "Modes are entirely your discretion, you just have to get a feel for where to use them. \n\nGenerally, you'll want to choose a mode that has all the chord tones of whatever chord you're playing, so if you have dominant 7 chords (like in your example) you'd generally want to play the mixolydian mode of that root (e.g. A mixolydian over A7), since mixolydian is the only mode that has a dom7 of the root. Generally, you'd also mix that up with the dorian mode, which is the same except it has a flattened 3 (which, along with the tritone, is an important blues note).\n\nSomething I find helpful is to not necessarily think of which mode you're using, but rather which scale degree you're changing. For example, let's say you're playing over an Am. If you play the aeolian mode/minor scale, that means you have 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 (i.e. A B C D E F G) in relation to A major. If you wanted to do Dorian, you'd just have to change the b6 to 6 (F to F#).

At the 2:30 hour mark I had an ego death experience and I did not come back from that \"WEIRD\" until the 7:00 hour mark. The second time that it happened it was with a lot of s h r o o m s. It is indescribable, and it made me realize that there is much more to this reality. And yes, it is something completely different. The explanations of \"yeah, you were a process rather than a person\" make sense only to some extent because they do not account for the actual wholesomeness and immensity of the experience. The rubber band description is quite accurate. In fact, if you habve any chance I highly recomend the manual \"the psychedelic experience\" written by Tim Lear and R. Alpert. They described this process in quite detail: its amazing the effort they put in creating a framework within which this can be understood. They call it the 1st and 2nd bardo experience. In particular the 1st bardo is what happens the moment your ego dies, which if done right, terminates all the games that you play and have ever played and enter this non-game existence of unadulterated bliss and cosmic unity. The second bardo lies in the edges of the 1st, and it can take many forms, but they are what we hear about most of the times when people explain their experiences: heavy hallucinations, interplays of memory and philosophical insights. The 1st bardo is simply different, one level up. \nIn both of my experiences I had the distinct impression that existence itself can be explained. And more importantly, that we lie just at the edge of something infinitely bigger and brighter. The geometry of light and existence and consciousness allows for the creation of infinite universes at no expense whatsoever... they flourish everywhere and each of them is immense... but beyond the normal universe we know about, there is just much much much more... much more than infinity, much more than eternity. \nI am not sure how this actually plays out... but I hope that we can find out when we actually investigate these states of mind with precise technology. But that's just a wish. And the best thing is, that even the worst case scenario is actually awesome! If this first bardo is merely an hallucination, it still does not mean that it is a inexistence! We are made of experience after all, and if at its edges lies these wonders, I can only imagine how fantastic and huge the future of whatever intelligence we happen to evolve or create will be... they will not only have the common human experience to play with (like us, who play all these human games) but also a very very huge uncharted canvas of possible conscious experiences of unbelievable beauty and conscious density, if that makes sense.\n\n- I'll see you in the place where we have no names.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1308633856", "subreddit": "Drugs", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh wow, I'm sorry to sound like a total dick here but please don't listen to anyone else's bad advise. My advise will actually help you.\n\nThe problems that you are having are symptoms of reading too slowly. Every single complaint that you have would be erased if you were to read faster.\n\n\n&gt;I find myself not remembering the whole passage I just read, and I have to read it again.\n\nThe faster you read the better your comprehension will be.\n\n&gt;It's very hard for me to concentrate on the book, even though I really like what I'm reading, other thought just creep in, and I start imagining my own scenarios and sub-stories from what I just read, figuring out 5 minutes later that I'm not even reading any more.\n\nThe faster you read the more involved you will be in actively reading. If you're out for a run you would deliberately have to slow yourself down in order to stop to read something posted on a wall. It's harder to get unintentionally distracted the faster you are moving.\n\n&gt;I usually just \"read through\" parts of the story, usually the very end. I just acknowledge them, like \"oh so that's what happened\".\nI read reviews from people saying how the story terrified them \"and haunted their dreams\", but I didn't really feel anything. I mean, it was interesting, but I didn't really feel scared at all, or in fact feel much of anything, and I really wanted to.\n\nWhen you learn to read 5+ words at a time you will start to feel the words. The story will jump off of the page. When you see a batter hit a baseball towards you, you don't stop to say \"baseball flying at head, better react quickly\" You just react. When you're able to read quickly enough you will just react to the words. Y O U D O N T R E A D L E T T E R S O N E A T A T I M E and you shouldn't read words one at a time either.\n\nIf you want to learn more about speed reading check out Evelyn Wood's book.

Period.     The  n a m e  of  the  game  is \nresistance.      A   muscle   contracts   against   resistance   and,   with   perseverance, \nbecomes  stronger  over  time.   For  strength  to  increase,  the  a m o u n t  of  resistance \nor  load  w o r k e d  against  m u s t  also  increase  over  time.   Hence  the  problem  with \nb o d y w e i g h t  conditioning  -  as  the  resistance  (weight  of  the  body)  is  fixed,  is \nh o w  to  continue  increasing  strength?    Surprisingly,  the  answer  is  simple  -  by \ndecreasing  the  a m o u n t  of  leverage  it  is  possible  to  exert  on  an  exercise,  the \nresistance  of an  exercise  becomes  increasingly  greater.   For  example,  a  hanging \nstraight  leg  lift  is  m u c h  harder  than  a  tucked  leg  lift.     In  both  exercises  the \nweight  of  your  legs  remains  constant;  however  by  reducing  your  leverage  (i.e. \nin   this   case   straightening   your   legs)   we   are   able   to   greatly   increase   the \nresistance.   By  straightening  the  legs  we  have  effectively  doubled  the  difficulty \nof  the  exercise  even  t h o u g h  the  weight  of  the  b o d y  has  remained  constant.

He is not good in a 1v2 lane however.\n\nSolo Lane Playstyle Notes:\n\n* Harass from level 1 with Spear Shot\n* Never use more than 70% of your mana (always have at least 30%)\n* Try to maintain mana so that at level 4 you have 150-200 mana, then harass more aggressively; if you see that you can throw a spear and get them at or below 15% life, attempt to combo him\n* If you kill him, farm quietly until level 6 and recall\n* \"This is what I love most\", seek out lanes to gank; use clairvoyance to find junglers are buffs\n* Pantheon is perfect for tower diving because his passive can block a tower shot\n\nDuo Lane Playstyle Notes:\n\n* [Shushei] does not like playing Pantheon in a duo lane\n* Good lane partners: Taric / Sion / Garen; almost 100% chance for first blood at level 1; get stun at level 1\n* Still try to harass a lot, but instead of ganks try to focus on farming + harassment\n\nSplit Pushing Notes (Mid/Late Game):\n\n* Because of his global ultimate, Pantheon can be a successful split pusher\n* Push side lanes, leave middle lane for your allies to push\n* Jumping successfully: If allies start the fight, try to jump in the vicinity of the enemy carry but not too far from your allies\n* In team fights, try to jump on the carry and get out; once your opponents stop focusing you, enter the fight again\n* Your goal in the team fight should be to kill the hard carry - \"Our spear should pierce his heart\"\n* If you play smart, you won't die\n\nTeam Fight Playstyle Notes:\n\n* Stay close to your tank\n* Try to keep flash up to escape (unless you won your teamfight and you need to use it to catch up with someone)\n* If you get focused, try to flash out of the fight, recall and use your ultimate to re-enter the team fight\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1308846695", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll clarify then.  It isn't a belief structure or system, it is the opting-out of a belief.  These aren't the same things.\n\nFor Example:\n\nWicca, Christianity, Satanism, Hinduism, etc. are all belief structures.  They stem from one belief and many beliefs branch off from that.  They have tradition, guidelines for life, rules, etc.  Athiesm has none of those things.  It is the absence of a belief.\n\nBegin an athiest does not mean you are in a community of athiests who all serve a similar value category or share a common belief because there *are* no values associated with athiesm.  The only connecting factor is the absence of a belief in God.  As long as they don't believe in a God, they are Athiest.  It's a yes or no question, you either are or you aren't.  \n\nIt's like saying someone is a thiest.  There isn't a \"thiest\" belief structure or religion. It isn't a \"belief\", it is a designation.  Then from thiest branches down to types of thiesm.\n\nIn essence, athiest is the Kingdom version of a belief.  Christianity, on the other hand, is more like the Family version of a belief.  They are not equivalent in anyway.  No organized religion is the equivalent of athiesm.\n\nK P C O F G S ss", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1308860763", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you need a pure take-no-damage tank 0 21 9 works, I run 9 0 21 with HP quints, MPen reds, Armor yellows and scaling MR blues. I like to take a mana crystal and pots first...but he can pretty much succeed with anything. Scaling q e e w e r...scaling your spikes gives you some of the best early AOE auto attack damage: this lets you last hit and regen HP and mana from your passive so you can stay in lane forever. \n\nMy item build, again varies per game, but RoA and 3 speed boots tend to be pretty much my core. Bveil, frozen heart, deathcap, Guardians, FoN all work pretty well on him also, but build according to team comp. RoA gives him extra bite (huehue) and not being one of those silly no damage-never-kill tanks.\n\nLand your rupture. This will bring everything together and if you can yell \"UP YOU GO!\" at chumps, there is a high possibility of that hero just blowing up after.

A couple of minutes, no design decisions; possibly a little more in total if the message has been translated into the other languages as well, but this is likely done en masse via string tables.\n\nFor DND... You maybe have to change both the client and the server, both likely to be managed by two entirely different teams. You probably have to add new art in the form of icons. You have a lot of design decisions to make: should the setting be persistent and remain \"on\" forever until the user switches it back? How is it possible to reach the user at all if he forgets to turn it off; or if somehow he turns it on, but doesn't know how to turn it off? Should game and party invites be affected by this? New status, feedback, and error messages have to be added and translated to every language. The code complexity isn't trivial: If the bulk of chat is currently implemented in each client and the b.net simply relays it blindly, then either your client will have to send back an automatic \"I am in DND mode, your message has been discarded\"-type reply, or the relay mechanics on the server itself has to be modified; which one is the best design choice and why? Should you still be able to receive messages from users on your friend list? (If the check is done on the server, do we now have to pull a user's friend list at a point where we didn't need it before?) What if you are in DND and you message other users, should it be switched off so they can reply? Is it actually a good thing, part of what we want to accomplish with b.net? (E.g. what if most people just end up going /dnd, what's the point? What if our overall plan is to make b.net more \"social\" and open?) Will it make \"busy\" more or less redundant, should we just change the mechanics of that instead? How and why is this upsetting people, who is affected, is it worth the effort? And all of this has to be discussed / coordinated with many people: UI, code, design, Q&amp;A, B.Net team vs. SC2 team vs. possibly other teams using chat-system of b.net.\n\n= not a couple of minutes, even if the coders aren't \"fucking retarded\". Depending on design, it could easily amount to a week+ in man-hours.\n\nIf you still disagree or don't believe me I dare you to find any large open-source chat client/server model which doesn't already have it and \"simply\" add a new user status where new incoming messages are completely discarded (&amp; the sender is notified that his message was thus rejected). Coordinate the patch with the main developers of the project. At the same time I will take the same project and add an easter egg where, if you try to send a message that says exactly \"it's easy unless you're fucking retarded\", it changes it to \"arrogance and ignorance were sitting in a tree, k i s s i n g\". I will shit in your hat and eat it if you have to do less than 100x as much work as I do.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1309173508", "subreddit": "starcraft", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

I mean to say that it is actually impossible to accomplish the feat of watching the second without catching the entirety of the first film as a side effect.\n\nThis is primarily because the vast bulk of the screen time in the second film is  dedicated to clips from the first film. Actually, it's essentially the first film framed with snippets of nonsense about the supposed younger brother of the first film's anti-hero.\n\nAmusingly, the first film *also* contains clips of the first film, and not just during flashbacks: at one point the main character brings his girlfriend to a theater to watch a film made up of clips from earlier in the movie, which the first film's star is narrating for his date.\n\nThis segment is in the second film. You watch this sequence being narrated to a character of the second film.\n\n...\n\nLet me run that by you a little slower:\n\nAt some point, you are watching a character of the second film watching the second film's main character describing a sequence from the first film, where they are watching the first film, which is being described by the first film's main character.\n\nThat is, if I fully remember it.\nIf I actually recall correctly, the second film's main character is actually narrating to his psychotherapist a sequence during which he brings his date to a theater *playing* the first film, during which we watch the first film's main character narrating the first part of *his* movie to *his* date.\n\n**TL;DR: lol wat?

{"body": "Yes. Consider case 1: No two letters are horizontally or vertically the same --\n\n    A B A B A B A B\n    B A B A B A B A\n    A B A B A B A B\n    B A B A B A B A\n\n.... In this case, there is clearly a valid move! But we want to draw a scenario where there are no valid moves (if it exists). So what if we DO have two letters the same (without loss of generality), looking like this:\n\n   .... A A ....\n\nNow consider the 'squares' just to the right of the \"A A\":\n\nThe one immediately to the right clearly cannot be an A. So it must be a B.\n\nSimilarly, the ones above and below this B cannot be As (as then they could be switched with the B to get a match). Thus these are both Bs too.\n\nSo now we have 3 Bs in a row!!\n\nThis completes the proof.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1309466948", "subreddit": "math", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
