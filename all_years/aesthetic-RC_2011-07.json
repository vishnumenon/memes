When she has stun, her standard \"burst\" is Q and W, where this should bring down 1/3rd of their HP.  \n\nYou get Q W W E W R, after which you prioritize maxing R over W over Q over E.  Just try to last hit minions with Q for now, and try to use your ult with the stun.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend Ryze as other people have been saying, mostly because I don't believe newbies are fairly good at last hitting (heck, I'd say a lot of lvl 30s need help with that too), and Ryze relies on this rather slow autoattack to last hit most of the time.

{"body": "I tried a few times unsuccessfully to ween myself off and I tried a variety of methods that were more or less successful. The first few times that I tried, I ultimately failed because the withdrawal symptoms were so severe. The most common withdrawal symptom for me was severe vertigo and dizziness, to the point where I wasn't even able to move around. The way I managed to get off it was, as the others have suggested, a VERY slow process, but one that minimized the withdrawal symptoms almost entirely. What I did was gradually reduce my dosage each week. For example, 50mg on M T W T F and Saturday, and then on Sunday I'd cut off a piece of the 50mg pill to reduce the dosage to around 40mg. Then I'd do 40mg on Saturday and sunday, and then added the other days until I was taking 40mg every day instead of 50. There were a few times that I \"rushed\" it by adding 3 or 4 days a week of a lesser dosage and experienced some withdrawal symptoms etc.\n\nI don't want this to be interpreted as a \"how-to-guide\" since everybody is different and if you're on it and wanting to come off, talk to your doctor and explain what's working and what isn't. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1309792200", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

In this case we'll use the scales around the fifth fret.\n\nFor the C chord, the appropriate pentatonic scale would be:\n    \n  |-5--**8**-|\n\n  |-**5**--8-|\n\n |-**5**-7--|\n\n|-**5**-7--|\n\n|-5-**7**--|\n\n|-5--**8**-|\n\n\nFor the G chord, the appropriate pentatonic scale would be:\n    \n|-5-**7**--|\n\n|-5--**8**-|\n\n|4--**7**--|\n\n|-**5**-7--|\n\n|-5-7--|\n\n|-5-7--|\n\nFor the Am chord, the appropriate pentatonic scale would be:\n    \n|-**5**--8-|\n\n|-**5**--8-|\n\n|-**5**-7--|\n\n|-5-**7**--|\n\n|-5-**7**--|\n\n|-**5**--8-|\n\nFor the F chord, the appropriate pentatonic scale would be:\n    \n|-**5**--8-|\n\n|--**6**-8-|\n\n|-**5**-7--|\n\n|-5-**7**--|\n\n|-5--**8**-|\n\n|-5--8-|\n\nThe numbers in bold represent the outline of the chord shape in the fifth fret position, C=G shape, G=D shape, Am=Em shape and F=C shape. Apologies for it not being clearer! \n\nPlay over each chord with it's associated scale. You'll notice that all of the notes 'work' but that the chord tones sound 'strongest' - this includes the alternative positions for these notes, e.g. over the C chord, both the E at the 5th fret, and the G at the 8th fret on the B string will work.\n\nThe scale shapes for C and Am are the same. However, because they're played over different chords, there will be correspondingly different strong tones within them.\n\nIn this case, all the chords are from the key of C Major and 'superimposing' the scale shapes on top of each other produces:\n\n    |-5-78-|\n    |-56-8-|\n    |45-7--|\n    |-5-7--|\n    |-5-78-|\n    |-5-78-|\n\nWhich, with C as our root note gives C D E F G A B - the full set of notes in the key of C Major.\n\n(You could also look at this shape as being A natural minor/A Aeolian if it had an A root)\n\nThere's a *lot* more which can be done with this, but for the sake of clarity, we'll leave it there!\n\nI'm not sure I've explained particularly well as I'm in a bit of a rush - please feel free to ask questions to clarify my clumsiness.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1309880483", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

If you decide to use C for a C Major scale, going from C to C, thats Ionian, and its what most people are used to.  But now say you go from D to D with the notes in a C Major Scale, like D E F G B A C D, thats D Dorian and you get a very different sound.  There are 7 different modes and they all sound pretty unique and are fun to play with.  This is a very brief cursory explanation, but hopefully it helps a little.  Major and minor scales are actually just different modes of the same scale.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1309911781", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oof. Have I been here before.\n\nOk, first of all: Don't panic.  It's the **worst** thing you could possibly do and y'know why? Because SHE panics. Even if it's quiet, she's feelin' the pressure and pressure means panic.\n\nTwo things can be goin' on, so think long and hard about what I'm going to tell you.\n\n1) She really might not be horny IN GENERAL. Not just for you, but about sex in general.  This crazy shit happens to me all the time and I don't really know how to explain it other than \"I don't wanna fuck, but I love the hell out of you. We cool? You mind stickin' around? It'll come back, I'm pretty sure.\" \n\nThe only reason I know not to panic when the \"bed death\" shit creeps in is because ... well, hell ... I set that bitch on fire *myself* a few times and let it burn for a couple months. GF wasn't too happy, but waiting on good sex is WAY better than both of you crying in the middle of some bullshit sex because neither of you could get into it with all that ... *p r e s s u r e.* \n\nYa feel me?\n\n2) She's not feeling you. But YOU'LL KNOW if she's not feeling you and it won't be from just sex, c'mon. She won't do sweet stuff anymore, won't baby-talk and want to cuddle. She'll pull away from you and hang with other people. She'll get annoyed when you want to be a bigger part of her days, her nights...  it won't be just a lack of sex.\n\nIf she's not pushing you away in every aspect, please ... for the love of love, don't panic. You'll damn the thing straight to hell.\n\nThat said, good luck. You're probably fine. \n\nMy advice? Concentrate on making you sexier and act like you're not even worried if she's lookin' or not. Dress hotter, smell better, and let her come to you. (For some reason, the whole \"pretend you don't really care about the sex\" really turns some girls' heads.) At the very least, it'll help her relax and see that you're backin' off, which will pull her out of her shell if she's still diggin' you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310030294", "subreddit": "actuallesbians", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry to disagree with you here, but the fact that the major scale and minor scale have the same notes is not actually as significant as you claim -- in other cultures, for example, especially in Arabic music, scales aren't thought of in this way.  The big affective difference between major and minor comes from the melodic intervals rather than the harmonic ones.  You could play A B C D E F G# A instead or A Bb C# D E F G A or A B C D# E F# G A, and they'd sound very affectively different from a minor scale because they don't have the same intervals with the root.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310230807", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Good morning to you too (from your username).\n\nIf you know anything about Jewish music, you know that major scales are associated with sadness -- specifically, slichot; you know what I'm talking about if you remember the Vidui (Confession) on Yom Kippur -- and minor scales with happiness -- siman tov umazal tov, etc.  Sometimes major scales get associated with peace, but that's probably a Western thing.  I'm obviously oversimplifying, but you get the picture.\n\nI have to strongly disagree with a lot of the other posters here as to the reason for the difference in affect between the different scales.  First, let's make it clear that minor and major are not the only two scales out there!  Here are a bunch, on C:\n\nCDEFGABC (major), CDEF#GABC (lydian), CDEFGABbC (mixolydian, which is also Adonai Malach), CDEbFGABbC (dorian), CDEbF#GABbC (Mi Sheberach), CDEbFGAbBbC (minor), CDEbFGAbBC (harmonic minor), CDbEbFGAbBbC (phrygian), CDbEFGAbBbC (Ahavah Rabah)\n\nThey all feel different, and that's probably because of the harmonic implications of the melodic intervals, if that makes any sense.  This is most likely trained rather than inherent in the music, though I can't cite studies.  If you play part of a song, you'll want to fill in the other part, right?  If you play C D E F E D _, your mind will be knocking you over the head to play the final C.  When given a root of the scale, a root of the chord, and a note, there are certain tendencies for how that note will \"resolve\".  For example, in the key of C, the interval C F will tend to \"resolve\" to C E, and the chord Db F G will tend to resolve to C E G, and the interval Db G will tend to resolve to C G if you're familiar with the preceding chord (say, from Spanish music).  In the key of D, that same interval Db G will tend to be thought of as C# G and resolve to D F#.  What happens is that your mind keeps a record of what key it's in and what the stable chords are in that key, and when presented with another note and chord, it figures out how to make it resolve to one of those stable chords.\n\nThe upshot of this is that in each scale, each note has its particular way it wants to go, particular notes it calls to mind, and that plays with your associations to give the scale some kind of affect, happy or sad or mysterious or melancholy or painful or whatever.  And once you have these emotions attached to chords, which is tied in to their function (this is getting out of scope), when the notes in the scale bring to mind the chords and their resolutions, you get the affect from that, too.  For example, if you play C D Eb F G A, you'll have the minor i affect from C to G, and when you hit that A, you'll have the major IV affect.  Change it slightly: C D Eb F# G A.  Now, the F# has a strong desire to resolve to the G rather than the stable F of the previous example, and the A doesn't get to be in an F major chord, so you might hear the A as part of a Cm6 or even a Cdim7.  Totally different affect.\n\nAnyway, the answer is that yes, they do vary, and nobody really knows why music works this way but if you think about it long enough you might get some insight.  Maybe the fact that I was brought up with Jewish and Brazilian music means that I interpret music differently, or maybe that's unrelated to why I interpret music differently, but there you go.  I think that's ultimately a question that only you can answer, after seeing many people's responses and realizing they're all incomplete or wrong.

It's an extremely easy and fun song, and will also help with your C chord if you are struggling with that.\n\nThere is also Boulevard of Broken Dreams by Green Day. That song goes E minor, G, D, A. The strumming pattern is D D D U D but the last D should be playing the next chord your moving to. For example, if you are going from E minor to G, you play D D D U on the E Minor then play D on the G, then continue doing this for each chord for one measure each.\n\nEdit: [Here](http://www.justinguitar.com/en/ST-514-HeyYa.php) is a tutorial for the song from Justin.

And this happened before I saw the movie.\n\nThere were 4 levels of dreams, I don't remember the first one, the second was semi-realistic (means that I had no control over what my character was doing), third one was realistic (I had control over my actions but I didn't know it was a dream) and the last one was a lucid dream (I could do anything I wanted).\n\nAs I said, I don't remember the first dream, I only remember that I saw something before the second one.\n\nIn the second dream, I'm suddenly at a party with all the people I went to school with in a large cafeteria. Everyone was having fun. I see my old classmates and they were having fun and they made a joke about my appearance. I laughed along and was quite social.\n\nThen I wake up into the third dream. Literally I wake up thinking that I just woke up for real. My city was under attack by alien ships during night time, rockets and lasers everywhere. I was scared shitless. Then this cat in a basket gets thrown into the window. I quickly try to hide the cat to protect it but I notice something wrong - it slowly morphs into an alien and starts killing me with blunt weapon.\n\nThen I wake up into the fourth dream. I realised what had just happened. I was in some kind of airport terminal area. I look at my hands and start rubbing them together and then I realise I'm in a dream. A lucid dream. Whenever I have these kind of dreams, I do anything that is socially unacceptable, because I **can**. Anyways, I took this random hot looking girl and had sex with her right in front of hundreds of people, and as soon as I finish, I wake up.\n\nLooking around the room, I realise I just saw the most epic dream in my life. I find a paper and pen and write down as much as I can remember. I currently can't find the paper so there's a lot that I missed out.

Always keep an eye on my meter, because if I have meter, and I see you throwing projectiles/assists fullscreen, I will use Shinku. One common way for Ryu players to approach is to use Air Tatsu L. This is not an overhead, so you can block this low, and most average Ryu players will follow it up with c. L, so watch for that. His launcher is unsafe on block, so you can punish that if someone finishes their L M H S series. You can punish Hadokens with your own full screen supers to make him rethink his zoning. Ryu with X factor + meter is deadly. Shinku Hadoken does a lot of chip. Try not to put yourself in this situation without your own X factor.

{"body": "Understanding your circle of 5ths and how different keys relate to each other might help. Scales and tendency tones are also rather important\n\n\nMost popular music is based strongly on relationships derived from 5ths, 3rds and 2nds. For example C | F  | C | G F | C | G C, is a standard 12bars blues progression is based on 5th relations. C being the tonic, F being a 5th bellow C (subdominant) and G being a 5th above C (Dominant). Classically speaking it is unlikely you will find a Dominate chord descend to the tonic chord, but in popular music this happens all the time.\n\n\nThese 3 chords make up the majority of chords in most popular songs.\n\n\nA simple way to use a 3rd relationship is to progress from on chord and simple just change one note. For example F to Am, since they have 2 shared notes you can flow easily into one another. If you like instead of using a C F G progression, you can use chord that is a 3rd away from F, like C, Dm G, or even C, Am G. This is a bit of an over simplification but it's a good starting point.\n\n\nAlso when changing keys it is important to remember the circle of 5ths as well. The closest key relationships are next to each other on the circle. ie Bb F C keys. C and Bb are both one note different from F. As apposed to changing from C to F# which is the furthest relationship on the circle of 5ths, these two keys share only 2 notes.\n\nStarting out I would try to limit pitch material to the key you are in and the 2 most closely related keys. For example C | F | D | G, or C | G | Bb | F. The first progression is in C but borrows from G major, while the second borrows from F major.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310405398", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't know if I have anything to contribute that hasn't been said already but I'll just try to throw in my two cents.\n\nAs been said, it really comes just down to practice. The really good ones have just been pushing it for days, weeks, and years. I don't remember who I'm quoting here but \"The correct spelling of creativity is \np r o d u c t i v i t y\"\n\nI don't know what kind of specific advice I can give you since I don't know what kind of direction you would like to go with art, but it's always best to start off with basics. Stuff like composition, perspective, and value (the \"darkness\" of a colour if you will, try to convert all colours you see to shades of grey in your mind. It doesn't really matter what colours you use if your value is right.) are the most important ones.\nYou should always carry a sketchbook with you, drawing from life is always the best way to learn. When you're drawing don't try to just copy what you see but try to understand what you are seeing. For example you know how the mountains far away tend to look more blue than they actually are on a clear day, or why they acquire more yellow hue in the evenings. When you understand what you are drawing it's only a matter of execution. You can help your understanding also by studying pictures. Choose a subject you think you need some practice in and pick a picture you think could teach you something. For example doing studies of multiple photographs of sunsets, trying to understand why the colours turn out the way they do.\n\nI started practicing drawing relentlessly maybe a year ago. I always carry a few sketchbooks with me with multiple pencils. During one year (12.7.2010 to this day) I've done 725 digital paintings plus all the traditional stuff I've done. This includes selfportraits drawn from mirror, doing studies of different photographs, drawing from life, and doing stuff from imagination to test out what I've learned.\n\nThis is what I've achieved in exactly one year. I always feel like I'm not doing enough and that's what pushing me further. I hope this will give you a spark! Both from imagination:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WReUR.jpg\n\nThats what beats natural talent, relentless practice!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310418398", "subreddit": "drawing", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I started off playing the guitar poorly and never took lessons for the guitar.  I knew the chords G D C E F and Am.   \n\nThe beginning was the toughest part.  Trying to learn \"rolls\" and then listening intently to the bluegrass channel on XM helped.   Then I learned a few starter songs: \n\nCripple Creek\nJohn Hardy\nBoil Them Cabbage Down\n\nI learned them from the \"You can teach yourself banjo\" book and my instructor helped.   I sucked at banjo and it was terrible.  I had a fender cheap-o model that I got for about $300, but I highly reccommend a deering goodtime open-back starter banjo.   \n\nI started off listening to the CD that came with the book, going to lessons, and making incremental improvements.  \n\nAlways leave your banjo out on a stand beside your favorite chair.  Never put it in the case for long durations.  You will fail if you do.    Keep it out, pick it up for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, just for a song or two. \n\nPlay the same roll over and over and over and over and over until you want to pull your hair out. \n\nThen, once you know a song pretty well through the chord progression and can play it, learn it a new way using different rolls and different positions up the neck.  For instance, I can play John Hardy Down the neck with about 4 variations on the A and the B parts.  Then I can play it up the neck several ways, then I can play it by \"vamping\" or just playing simple chord backup.  THis has been hard for me. \n\nI practice between 5 minutes and 20 minutes a day, and one hour of lessons a week.  The hour is spent playing a few songs I like, then exploring a new part of a new song, then playing a song or two that I like at the end.  Playing with someone else is hard but you learn SO fast that way. \n\nThen I bought \"Band in a box\" and was able to download some midi files of the songs I know, then turned off every other instrument except the bass, and then played along with the bass line only.  This acted as a metronome and as a way to explore new ideas.  This is an excellent learning tool. \n\nFor speed:   Play with a metronome.  Very slow at first.  Play it 5 times through at a slow speed.  Turn the metronome up one tiny notch.   Play again 5 times with no mistakes.   UP a notch.   Play again.   Eventually you'll be fast on that song. \n\nChords and licks transfer from song to song.  Now I can learn a song in a week or so, be pretty decent at that song in a month of dedication.   It's MUCH easier now that I've been playing for awhile. \n\nHere is a video of me and my teacher playing \"Hangman's reel\"  I'm on the Cello Banjo. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU_dgLOn6Eg", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310419153", "subreddit": "banjo", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Careful because the prefix '7th' alone in reference to a chord implies dominant 7th. \n\nI suggest you familiarize yourself with the following scales: Ionian (1 2 3 4 5 6 7), Harmonic Minor (1 2 b3 4 5 b6 7 8), and Jazz Minor (1 2 b3 4 5 6 7 8).

Once you are comfortable with these, you can start adding the 9th, 11th, and 13th and start altering (raising/lowering) certain tones.\n\nNext you need to learn how to extract the modes of the scale.

I'm saying that because wookies do not contribute to their team and make losing an inevitability they deserve to be trolled by smoke. \n\nPS, I'm glad we're back to engaging in a level-headed debate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310513550", "subreddit": "badcompany2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is hard to talk about for me, because I do not like to hurt other people. Its just something that happens and is a danger to happen. I have grown and taught myself to have a very v e r y long fuse to survive in society where everything &amp; everyone irritates and pisses me off. Words don't bug me at all--folks can say anything to me, about me or anyone and I don't care. Its just words. But I have found that as soon as someone touches me or gets physical to me or anyone I know--there is a warm calming 'snap' I feel in my brain that just clicks, and that is it. It feels like my eyes or vision just starts shaking and I get the feeling of going over a waterfall in a raft and it all just rushes into instant rage and I explode from inside and that person in my sights is gone. My drive then is nothing short of destroying and inflicting as much damage as is possible. I did a lot of fighting when I was a little kid but realized I had to learn to curb it as I got older cause I was not just fighting, when I got mad I was out to hurt people and WAS hurting a lot of people doing a lot of severe injuries and that extra mile of terrorizing emotional distress that you wouldn't find in a normal kid fight. That IS my dark passenger. In my early teens I learned a LOT about the vulnerabilities on the human body. Greys Anatomy was one book I read a lot of among others.     \n\n\nGood friends of mine (they were brothers) back some 20 years ago around Senior year in High School had a younger sister 1 year behind us in classes. Very nice girl, very sweet, everyones ideal kid sister and since she was my best friends sister she was in my heart my kid sister too.  \n\n\nShe was out on a pizza date and ended up back at this guys house. They hung out and watched movies etc. He got drunk somewhere along the line, tore her clothes and smacked her around at his house. His family was away so he was trying to get some action from her and she was not interested though he did try to force her physically, so when she declined he smacked her around pretty good, calling her every name he could to hurt her feelings, and then tossed her out of his house to walk a few miles home in the winter cold. She eventually came home crying hysterically, bleeding with ripped clothes and informed us what happened. Her parents wanted to call the cops but she begged for 10 minutes them not to. It wasn't needed. Myself and her two older brothers who were my best friends at the time decided we would pay him a 3am visit at his empty house. We got a couple of 2x4s from their dads work truck and drove over. \n\n\nA few days later he showed up on their doorstep (I practically lived at my friends house) with his parents in the car. His parents did not get out of the car or even look or stare at anyone. He however did hobble out of the vehicle. He was in a neck collar, with a broken arm/collar bone wrap around his chest, and a swollen face over one eye/jaw area with lots of stitched up cuts and bruises. He came by to formally apologize for his disrespectful poor behavior and state he would never ever bother her or do what he did ever again and wanted to make sure this incident was over. He never did bother her or anyone again that we knew of. It was one of those few rare \"rages\" I have had that I got to fully go to town completely like not before. Its where I do not remember a whole lot of what we did. I just have a beginning and an ending in my memory, but everything in between is a blurry cloudy haze. I remember we drove over. We went around back and kicked in his backdoor and we saw him shoot up on the couch in surprise. Then as we entered the home all I recall was a white sheen cloud in my mind as I shook and my next solid memory is being back at their house, hanging outside of thier house calming down and icing my swollen hands in the snow a while later. I had cuts and my hands were swollen for a week and I don't remember how it got that way or how I got any of the small cuts I had. I do recall that he screamed like a dog going into a wood chipper alive, ass first, during the whole thing though. I recall he tried to get away and we would drag him back by his feet and I remember the screaming. Think the scene in Shawshank Redmption where the guy got dragged back into the cell by the guards for a beating for putting Andy in the hospital. It was a really high pitched terrified scream and sounds I recall him making. It phases me today but back then, the screams kinda drove my rage into a pleasure. My friends never said much about what happened after, except they were glad I was on their side and hoped I never ever got mad at them like that. I never asked them to fill me in on what happened or that I didn't remember what went on. Seemed kinda mental to explain that I did not really remember anything.   \n\n \n\nYes I have known violent anger issues. No I do not talk or see anyone about them. I manage them just fine and always have kept my temper buried. The above was the last time I raged. I still have my nasty temper and rage issues and usually end up putting a few holes in walls or doors to cope, but so far no one has been stupid enough to go further with me as an adult. They usually look into my cold eyes and sense makes them immediately back down. Otherwise I'm a very friendly and very quiet kinda guy who pretty much just keeps to himself. :) \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310618225", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some advice: \n\nDo what you say.  My \"mentor\" liked to play the hard-case teacher, but he never followed through on his \"threats\" so he just came across as an asshole.  \n\nAlso, my experience in primary school has taught me to  A L W A Y S  have a backup activity.  Something that, no matter what you were doing before, if you finished the current activity ahead of schedule, or the little ones were getting antsy, you could fall back on with little or no preparation.  For me, it was hi-five rotations.  It's not an *academic* activity, per se, but it does teach teamwork and it also allows young ones to burn off a fair bit of energy.  Whatever you want to do, just have a fallback.  Ask your mentor if he/she has anything like that.  If you're observing primary, I can almost guarantee he/she does.  \n\nRight.\n\nNow, to more directly answer your questions, I was terrified that I was going to get so flustered that I would snap at a student and end my teaching career before it ever began.  I dealt with that by getting so liquored up shortly before --- no, I'm not serious.  I found out who was going to be on my testing board and I told them, \"Look, I'm not looking for advice on how to pass certification, I just want you to know that I am extremely nervous.\"  Then I confided the same to my \"mentor\", who as I mentioned before was a bit of an asshat, but he told me one thing that helped: \"Just remember, you're not fighting the system; it's *helping* you.  We are all conditioned from an early age to accept the authority of a teacher.  If you can convince yourself that you **are** in fact the teacher, you will have no problems.\"  \n\n**Now we get serious.  I was also terrified that I would get burnt out and tired of teaching.  I obviously didn't deal well with that fear, because it happened.  I taught for about ten years; the last six were hellacious. The last year, I did the absolute minimum to guarantee my salary, subtly and indirectly apologizing to the kids the whole time.  Then I quit.  Now I do IT and I'm much happier.  I think my problem, though, (so you can try to avoid this pitfall) was that I did the SAME thing every year.  I taught the same classes, with the same materials, and more-or-less the same activities, every friggin year.  Make sure that whatever school you end up teaching for has an option to vary things up, or at least gives you leeway in lesson preparation.  \n\nAnyway, I hope that helps and I hope you enjoy teaching.  When it's good, there's nothing like it.  I say that from the viewpoint of having worked over fifty jobs in twenty different industries.  Teaching, when it's done right, is the best job in the world, and it doesn't even matter what level you're teaching if your heart is in it.  Good luck to you!\n\n\n\n**Edit:** For the record, I'm male. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310663553", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This one time I woke up completely scared out of my mind. Like I had the sweats, my heart was beating like crazy, and such. The weird thing though was I couldn't remember what the nightmare was about. After sitting up in my bed for a few minutes and calming down a little I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I quickly looked over and I saw this lumberjack standing over my bed with an axe in the air. He had this crazy beard and his face was hidden in a shadow which somehow made it even creepier.  \nAnyways I of course freaked out and did what any logical person would do: immediately dive underneath my covers and try to stay perfectly still. After a while however it started to get really hot and stuffy underneath my blankets and I was faced with an ultimatum. Die of suffocation or die by being chopped up into teeny tiny little pieces. After debating with myself I decided I would take a risk and with a mighty bellow of \"I. WANT. TO. BREEEEEEEATHE\" I threw off the covers and jumped out of my bed to take on my attacker. He wasn't there however.  \nBest I could figure is I woke up from a dream only to be in another dream (I N C E P T I O N) and finally woke up completely while underneath my covers.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310713812", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Keep your crosshair level with the enemy, and simply try to strafe back and forth until your aim lines up. When it does, fire. Even pro, mlg-type scouts use this basic strategy more or less. Once you understand how to actually control your movement and use it for your advantage, you'll start to understand how much ass scouts can really kick when played correctly. \n\nHope that helps. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310806537", "subreddit": "tf2", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hello. I'm currently writing my Master's dissertation on Enochian angel magic. Much of my research has required me to carefully pore through Mediaeval and Renaissance grimoires; namely the *Liber Juratus, Ars Notoria, Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel, Heptameron, Clavicula Salomonis* and all their various manuscript forms.\n\nTo be clear, talismans and tables in grimoires are never protective. It's only in folk traditions you see the notion of protective talismans, and they always hinge on the authority of angels or God (Christian, Hermetic, Jewish, Neoplatonic, but always God in some sense).\n\nIt is only in the recent, psychological era and revival of paganism that we see the idea of talismans that are detached from any entity; talismans that seem to work on nature by the will of the user. Very Jungian. That's the New Age in a nutshell.\n\nIf you consider the Mediaeval and Renaissance perspective, a talisman is indeed a light. It's a beacon communicating a purpose. If you put up a beacon, someone will most certainly answer. If you do not carefully craft the focus for that beacon, the one who answers may not be the one you want.\n\nLook at John *[Dee's Sigillum Dei Aemeth](http://hermetic.com/dee/sigillum-dei-aemeth.gif)*. Looks a mess, doesn't it? It is a carefully encoded talisman crafted to communicate to the angelic hierarchy laid out in his conversations with angels. It's rather easy to decode thanks to the publication of his journals, but even the methods used to encode them are significant to the purpose. For example, for the heptagon inside the circular ring, he took the names of the angels (taken from Agrippa's 'Scale of the Number Seven' in his *De Occulta Philosophia*) in a 7X7 square and listed the names vertically instead of horizontally, but reordered them around the ring with the letters represented horizontally. Example:\n\nZ L L R H I A\n\nA Z C A A C B\n\nP A U P N H R\n\nH D M H I A I\n\nK K A A E E E\n\nI I E E L L L\n\nE E L L M G +\n\nThe first is the easiest to read. Going down and back up to the top, you can see the name 'Zaphkiel' and so on.\n\nThe use of the 7X7 square is relevant because the names of 49 angels are represented in the *Sigillum*. The rest of the names have their own methods and significance, but I think you get the drift.\n\nTrust me. The golden oldies knew what they were doing when it came to the notions of 'magic'. That the New Age attempts the same through the blunt force of will is a bit of a headscratcher.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311006572", "subreddit": "nosleep", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, so the major scale is definitely the most important scale to learn first. I'm not quite sure how to explain it so bear with me for a moment. The major scale I would say is one of the most basic tools in music but used everywhere. Think of the notes you can play as letters in the alphabet, and then the major scale as the first words you learn how to spell.    \nSo for your first question: \n&gt;Is the major scale the one that starts in G?\n\n\nTo answer this question by itself, yes the major scale can start in G, but really a major scale can start on any note. The form of a major scale really depends on the \"space\" or \"steps\" in between the notes. To help make this clearer, consider the [keys on a piano](http://www.eprintablecalendars.com/images/music/piano-keys-with-notes.jpg). For a major scale in the key of C, the notes to play would be C D E F G A B C. But how did I determine this? It may seem like I'm just following the order of the alphabet, and I certainly am, but if you look closer you'll see that I'm also skipping over notes. The pattern of steps between the notes is very important. For a major scale, the pattern of steps is whole whole half whole whole whole half (W W H W W W H). This may seem difficult but it's very simple. A half step is the space between any two keys on the piano, or since we are discussing bass, the space between any two frets on your bass. But since we are visualizing this with the piano, I'll stick with that for now. Between C and C# is a half step, and you'll notice that the keys are right next to each other. And so if that one space is a half step, it is logical to assume that two of those spaces equals a whole step, which brings us from C to D. That's the first whole step in the pattern for forming the major scale. The next note is a whole step away (referring back to our pattern). So on the piano go a whole step from D to the next note. D -&gt; D# -&gt; E. See, not so difficult. So far for our major scale in C, we have C, D, and E. The next spot in our pattern calls for a half step. So \nfrom our E we go a half step up, which is just the next note on the piano: F. Notice that there isn't a black key between E and F which makes this only a half step, perfect for our scale. And so if we keep following our pattern, we will eventually determine that the notes of the C major scale are: C D E F G A B C.    \n\n\nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg. To figure out major scales in other keys, you'll need to know your key signatures. But I'll explain that later on, if you want me to. A chord is just a name for a group of notes (usually three or more) played together. I realize this is a lot of writing, and probably might seem overwhelming at first so I'll let you decide whether or not you want me to keep explaining. Send me a message if you want more explanation or you have any questions at all.

{"body": "In music, a chord is when multiple notes are played at the same \ntime. So if I were to play C, E, and G at the same time on a \npiano, or any instrument really, I would get a C major chord. But \nI'll get to that when I start to explain chords more. \n\n\nNow to begin where I left off. Key signature is a very important \npart of music. If you can't play in the key, you're mostly better \noff not playing at all. Even to someone who isn't musically \ntrained, you can hear when something isn't played in key. It just \ndoesn't sound right. Although this is not the rule for everything \nbecause you can still stay be in the key without it sounding \ncorrect. I would say a key signature is a guideline on what notes \nyou can play within the piece. This doesn't mean that you should \nnever play notes outside of the key, but you definitely need to \nknow the rules before you start breaking them.\n\n\nA key signature is a designation (always found at the beginning \nof a piece but can be just about anywhere) that certain notes \nwill be played a half step higher or lower than what they are \nwritten. So let's go back to the [piano](http://www.eprintablecalendars.com/images/music/piano-keys-with-notes.jpg) for a moment. In our key of C we were using earlier, the [key signature](http://i.imgur.com/3fHsa.jpg) was empty. There are no [accidentals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_%28music%29) (sharps or flats) notated in the key signature. The key signature always comes after the clef, those two funny symbols you see on the [staff](http://i.imgur.com/3fHsa.jpg). The top clef is the treble clef, which is used by many instruments such as a guitar or a flute. The bottom clef is the bass clef, which is used by many instruments as well, such as the bass and the trombone. A piano uses both clefs and thus, piano music is written with both \nstaffs. So what you're actually looking at is a piano staff. Anyway, in the key of C, there are no accidentals, which means every note is written the way it's played. So if you see a G, you play a G. \n\nSo why do we have key signatures if they seem to make things more \ncomplicated? Why couldn't we just play music the way it's written?\n\n\nWell for starters, music is incredibly diverse. If we didn't use key signatures, we would always have to separately notate when we wanted an F# (F sharp) or an Ab (A flat). This just becomes impractical when writing any piece of music. Say you're following one of those color by number pictures. Instead of the creator writing \"red,\" \"yellow,\" \"green,\" etc. over and over again, he or she places numbers on the picture and then there's the key in a separate part so that you know what color goes where without having all these intrusive words over your fine picture. Similar to music, without a key signature, the \"picture\" or the song would be much more difficult for the musician to understand.\n\nFinally we can talk about key signatures. I'm not sure how to approach this since I've never explained this stuff to someone else before, but I'll try to make it as simple as possible. First off, you need to know your order of sharps and flats. This order is key (hehe) in understanding key signatures. A key signature is always notated in this order no matter what, so memorize these patterns and your life will be much easier.\n\nOrder of Sharps: F C G D A E B (Whenever my music teacher asked me what the sharps were in the key, I would always have to say \"sharp\" after each letter in order for my answer to be correct, so practice saying it as \"F sharp, C sharp G sharp...etc.\")\n\nHere's a mnemonic device I was taught as a child: \"**F**at **C**ows **G**o **D**own **A**nd **E**at **B**arley.\n\nOrder of Flats: B E A D G C F (Same thing goes for flats \"B flat, E flat, A flat...etc.\")\n\nTo remember this one, I always just thought \"**BEAD** **G**reatest **C**ommon **F**actor.\n\nPerhaps you have noticed that the order of flats is just the reverse of the order of sharps. This means that all you have to do is memorize either one so well that you can repeat it backwards, and then you'll know both.\n\n\nSo allow me to repeat myself, the order of sharps and flats is very important, and you should take the time to memorize them if you want to learn your key signatures more easily.\n\nAny key uses a number of either sharps or flats (never both in one key signature) to notate what is desired. But how do we determine which ones use sharps and which ones use flats?\n\n\nI'm going to pause here and give you the [circle of fifths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg) which is pretty much all you need to teach yourself keys if you don't want to follow my explanation. On this circle of fifths, it shows the major key, which is designated red, and its relative minor key in green. This means they use the same key signature but for two different keys, sort of like homophones. So you'll notice that the relative minor to \"C major\" is \"a (always keep minor keys lowercase to avoid confusion) minor\". The funny symbol\nin the gray area explains what is in the key signature. The symbol between the \"C\" and the \"a\" is a natural sign, which means there are no sharps or flats in the key signature. Now let's try this with a different key. The next key to the right is G major. Its relative minor is e minor, and there is one sharp in the key. But how do we know what is sharp? We go back to our order of sharps (in this case) and figure out what our first sharp is. Since there is only one sharp in the key, we go with our first sharp in the order of sharps. So in the key of G major (or e minor), the F is always F# unless notated otherwise. So this translates to your earlier question about the major scale that starts on a G. The major scale in the key of G major, or the G major scale, goes G A B C D F# G. So what you were referring to was in fact, the G major scale. Let's try another key, I pick Ab major. On the Circle of Fifths it shows that the relative minor to Ab major is f minor. And there are four flats in the key. Now we go to our order of flats and say the first four flats in the order of flats. Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db. These flats are the flats found in our key signature, so we know that every B, E, A, and D should be played as Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db. So the notes in the Ab major scale would be Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab. Easy enough. Oh, I forgot to mention that there's a helpful diagram of how the key signature is notated in the Treble Clef for each key. It's slightly different for the Bass clef, but I'll explain that later.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311126808", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "So now that we have our trusty Circle of Fifths, keys should be no problem. But we can't always carry around a Circle of Fifths with us. Well I guess we could, but it's not cool to stop a jam session in order to look up what's in the key. So make sure to memorize how many flats or sharps are in each key after memorizing the order of sharps and flats, and then you won't need to keep referring to the Circle of Fifths. All the keys that have flats in them have a flat in the name, except for the key of F. And all keys that use sharps are notated as the plain letter, except for the key of F#. And our key of C is neutral so there aren't any sharps or flats in it.\n\nHere's an easy way to memorize what flats are in what key. Take the name of the key, I choose Bb major. In the key of Bb major, there is a Bb and an Eb. Notice that the flats in the key go one flat past the name of the key in the order of flats. This is the same for every key with flats in it except for the key of F, but you only have to remember that there's only one flat in the key of F major. Here's another example, in the key of Eb major there are three flats. I know this because in the order of flats, if I include all the flats up to the name of the key, and then one after, there are three: Bb Eb and Ab.\n\nMemorizing what sharps are in what key is slightly more difficult, but it gets easier with practice. For this remember that the name of the major key for sharps is one letter past the last sharp in the key. Take D# major for example. In the key\nof D# major, there are two sharps, F# and C#. The last sharp in the key is C#, and so one letter past C is D. Let's try another one but in the opposite thought process. You're given a key signature with three sharps. Since you've memorized your order of sharps, you know that the first three sharps are F#, C# and G#. Then you take the last sharp in the key signature and you go one letter past that in the musical alphabet to determine what key you're in. So G goes to A, which means you're in the key of A major.\n\n\nOkay, that's easy enough, but what's up with the Gb/F# thing? Well this brings us back to our similarity with musical notation and homophones. These are called enharmonic notes, or in this case, enharmonic keys. These are, notes that are written differently, but they sound the same. Let's take a quick look back to our [piano](http://www.eprintablecalendars.com/images/music/piano-keys-with-notes.jpg). You'll notice that the black keys on the piano all have two different notes on them. These are all enharmonic notes. Why can't you always just call a Db a C#? Well in any scale, there has to be a C D E F G A B C. There is no repeat of a letter in our major or minor scales. Take our G major scale from earier. It is incorrect to say that the notes in the G major scale are G A B C D E Gb G. Gb and F# might make the same sound, but they are not the same note notationally. You'll notice on your bass that the E string held at the third fret produces a G. And with our knowledge from eariler, the fourth fret on the E string should move the note a half step up to G#. Now on the fifth fret E string, you have an A. You'll definitely know this if you use relative tuning at all, but if you don't, ask me and I'll explain relative tuning to you. It's a neat way to tune yourself when you're practicing by yourself and there's no tuner around. Now if you go down a half step from the A at the 5th fret, you go to the 4th fret, which would be an Ab. This should enhance your understanding of enharmonic notes and how they sound the same but are spelled differently.\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here, so you'll have to start asking me more questions before I know which direction to head next if you want more information on music theory. The internet is also full of this information so don't be afraid to search around when you don't understand something. And of course, feel free to ask me any questions you have. Although I'm sure there are many redditors more qualified to speak on the subject than me, I'll be happy to help as much as I can.\n\nAnd here's a little bit about myself if you're at all curious. I'm a seventeen year old kid entering my senior year in high school. I started my \"music career\" learning how to play the trumpet in fourth grade. I still play the trumpet now in my concert band at school and for the marching band. I started playing guitar in eighth grade. Played for two years and then took lessons for two years. I might go back for lessons but first I need to get a part-time job before I start that again because my mom says I'm too old for her to be paying for my music lessons. I started playing the bass guitar this past October because our school jazz band needed a bassist desparately in my senior year and I was willing to step up to the position. I'm actually becoming the school's bassist so I'll even be playing bass in the marching band this year. I also took the school music theory class this past year, which I did fairly well in. Here's a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq7P9V6l6cI&amp;feature=channel_video_title) of me playing bass in my band with my friends. I'm the one standing up if it's hard to tell. Feel free to ask me anything, I'd love to help.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311127202", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's definitely what happened.  In the snow fortress, when all is lost, Ariadne convinces Cobb to follow her on a crazy mission.  It is the same thing Cobb did to Fisher in the hotel.  \n\nAs soon as Cobb agrees the next shot is of Eames looking at Ariadne, not at Cobb, and then producing a PASIV machine from around the corner.  Ariadne's plan was always to take Cobb back to the tragic dream he shared with his wife, which he rationalizes to himself as \"Limbo.\"  (There is no Limbo and there are no special rules)\n\nAfter Cobb gets closure with his projection of Mal, Ariadne implores that Cobb \"save Saito,\" but the only two characters that used the PASIV machine in the snow fortress were Ariadne and Cobb.  In this dream sequence we understand that Mal is a projection, as we have all along, but Fischer and, most importantly, Old Saito are *also Cobb's projections*.\n\nThe moment of Inception occurs in Saito's fortress, where Cobb finally adopts the idea that he should \"go home.\"  Cobb returns to the most important sentence in the entire movie:\n\n&gt; Saito:  Don't you want to take a leap of faith? Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone!\n\nOn the helipad, Saito sets the context for the entire Inception job and first plants the idea.  Cobb has a choice, he can either continue to use the dreaming technology and die an addicted, old man like those we see in Yusuf's den, or he can take the leap of faith, give up the dream world, and go home to his children.  It's not possible to understand the importance of Saito's offer the first time viewing the movie because we don't learn the nature of Cobb's addiction until we see Yusuf's den and until Ariadne invades Cobb's dream (the elevator) to learn the details she will need.\n\nBeing framed for his wife's death and not being able to get through immigration is just the scenario the team has created for him, like Fischer's kidnapping.\n\nHalfway through the story Cobb returns to that sentence and because he has not adopted the idea he speaks in the negative:\n\n&gt; Cobb: Worst case scenario? When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.\n\n&gt; Saito: Cobb. I'll still honor the arrangement. \n\n&gt; Cobb: I appreciate that, Saito, but when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement. Limbo's gonna become your reality. You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna **become an old man**. \n\n&gt;Saito: Filled with regret. \n\n&gt;Cobb: **Waiting to die alone.** \n\n&gt;Saito: No. I'll come back. And we'll be young men together again. \n\nThe Inception moment is when Cobb must make the choice.  The choices are the two parts of himself sitting across at the table, him on one side and the old man waiting to die alone on the other.  The emotional climax of the movie is not the crap with the pinwheel, but Cobb's conversation with himself when he gets redemption:\n\n&gt;Saito: Have you come to kill me? I've been waiting for someone... \n\n&gt;Cobb: Someone from a half remembered dream. \n\n&gt;Saito: Cobb? Impossible. We were young men together. I'm an old man. \n\n&gt;Cobb: Filled with regret... \n\n&gt;Saito: Waiting to die alone... \n\n&gt;Cobb: ***I've come back for you... to remind you of something. Something you once knew... ***\n\n&gt;[the top spins without end] \n\n&gt;Cobb: ***That this world is not real.***\n\n&gt;Saito: To convince me to honor our arrangement. \n\n&gt;Cobb: ***To take a leap of faith, yes. Come back... so we can be young men together again. Come back with me...***\n\n&gt;[Saito reaches for the gun] \n\n&gt;Cobb: ***Come back...***\n\n**I N C E P T I O N**\n\nThe resolution is *the only scene in reality*, where Cobb demonstrates he is free of his addiction when he no longer cares what the outcome of Mal's totem is and he walks away to be with his children.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311287321", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 40, "controversiality": 0}

Narahiro, the programmer credited for the NES conversion of the game -- since the original Japanese Famicom version had a &gt;save-game system rather than a password feature, chances are good that Narahiro is the one who programmed it, and may have put in this &gt;debug mode himself. Others claim that NAR could stand for \"North American Release.\" Unless we can talk to one of the original team members, guess we'll never know -- but until then, you can enjoy this password which enables you to blaze through the game from start to finish in about 15 minutes -- all you need to do is go kill Kraid and Ridley and then head to Tourian, and it's hello bikini ending!

{"body": "Our son (almost 7) used to freak out when he had to go visit his mom after we got custody. (I'm technically a step mother but my husband has primary custody and I'm a SAHM.) The problem wasn't that he didn't want to see her; he was terrified of the transition and change. He'd scream and cry, but these were behaviors he'd LEARNED from his mom. She reacts emotionally to everything. It took me a while, but I taught him that it's OK to feel a n y t h i n g as long as you use calm words to express it. Now it will be obvious he's not happy about going but he doesn't throw a fit and he's not rude. He'll still load up and get in the car when she picks him up. He's still respectful. After a few days there, he adjusts just fine. \n\nBottom line, your wife needs to put his behavior in check no matter how she feels about your breakup. She should be supportive and reassuring to the child and she should make it clear what is and what is not an acceptable behavior. \n\nOh, on another note? If our son had screamed that he hated his mother or ANY OTHER ADULT, he would have been punished swiftly and immediately. Children are children. They do not make choices about where they go or with whom they visit. If they knew what was best for them, they wouldn't need our guidance. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311520027", "subreddit": "Parenting", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi there.\n\nI think it's great that you've posted here.  This is a warm and caring community, and I am hopeful that you will find understanding, support, and good advice.  \n\n\nThe first thing I want you to do, if you're in the US, is write down this phone number:  1-800-S U I C I D E.  Keep it by the phone.  Put it in your cell phone.\nIf you're not in the US, click this link [International hotline numbers](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/c305t/hotline_numbers), scroll to find your country, and write down the number.  Again, keep it by the phone and put it in your cell phone.\n\nNow that you have that number, you get to use it if things reach a crisis point.  If you feel the urge to kill yourself, call that number.  If you want to talk or vent, call that number.  I mean, if things are bad enough that you want to kill yourself, it won't hurt to call a phone number, right?  The people who work those lines are there to talk and help you through an immediate crisis if you experience one.  Please, promise me that you'll call the number if you feel an urgent need to kill yourself.  Think about calling it anyway if you want a live person to talk to.\n\nIt sounds like your family means a great deal to you, and that your parents' situations and your sister's absence have hurt you deeply.  It also seems, though, that your father's situation makes you feel a lot of despair for two reasons:  1) the way he has lived his life has left him in a sorry state (adult care, alcoholism), and 2) you are afraid you will end up like him.\n\nHere's the point where we stop and take a deep breath:  you're living *your* life.\n\nYour dad is an alcoholic who has spent his life in a downward spiral.  You are not living *his* life:  you're living *your* life.\n\nYour sister chose faith to help her cope; that works for her, but you're not living *her* life:  you're living *your* life.\n\nYour mother hides from things she doesn't understand; that's how she protects herself, but you're not living *her* life:  you're living *your* life.\n\n*Your* live doesn't have to be anything like *theirs*, genetics be damned.\n\nYou're clearly an intelligent, educated, accomplished person.  Your involvement in your academic department, work as a TA, and that you are a specially invited research assistant all speak to that.  Well, here's the part where I hit you up with some science:  depression is a chemical brain thingy that messes with moods, thoughts, and desires; the harder life is, the worse the depression can be.  (And yes, \"thingy\" is the technical term.)  I know that you know that.  I am not a doctor, but it sounds like you may be experiencing some severe depression that makes it really, really hard to cope with life.\n\nHere's the good news:  It can get better.  No, I am not telling you to run to the nearest pharmacy.  Here's what I *am* suggesting, though:  find a psychiatrist.  Wait, give me a second and I'll explain:\n\nMaybe you've tried it before with no luck (or even bad luck).  Maybe none of your relatives have been able to find stability with the help of medication.  Remember:  depression is a medical condition.  Yes, I know insurance companies and society label it as a \"mental health issue\", but if something involves chemicals in a brain, that's what I call physical health.  As I am sure you know, psychiatrists go to regular college, then medical school, and there's probably some additional schooling and training involved to specialize in psychiatry.  Like you, psychiatrists are educated people, and there are some phenomenal ones out there.\n\nDepression is hard to handle.  It might be *too much* to handle for many of us.  That's one of the reasons that many of us choose to go to doctors.  It's okay that we need some medical help to manage it.  It's okay if it takes medical help to manage any medical condition that you may have, whether it be cancer, depression, a broken arm, or an overabundance of wisdom teeth, for example.\n\nAbout psychiatrists:  A good one will ask about your family medical history as well as your own.  Also expect the doctor to talk extensively about your life situation and how you feel about it.  Be open and honest with your doctor.  The doctor is there to help with your medical condition, so it's counter-productive to leave things out or twist things.  Just lay it all out on the table---the more info the doc has, the more he or she can help.  There's nothing to be embarrassed about, even if you have to talk bout embarrassing things  (really, the doc has probably seen tons of different stuff and won't be judgmental).  If you don't click with your doctor, find a new one.  (Maybe search the internet for a local doc with good reviews.)\n\nThe doctor may choose to prescribe you something.  I know it didn't work for your relatives, but you are not your relatives:  you are *you*, and you're a different person.  So try it (yes, even if you've tried it before).  If it makes your thoughts worse, call the doc right away.  Otherwise, give it time to kick in.\n\nIn the meantime, go for a walk every day, or maybe do a little exercise.  Ask your psychiatrist for a recommendation for a therapist; call and schedule an appointment, and keep that appointment.  Like the doctor, the therapist is a trained professional who is here to help.  Be open and honest with the therapist.  Listen to the therapist and to yourself---what are you saying, and what does it mean?  What are you feeling, and what does that mean?\n\nI promise you, it can get better.  Please don't kill yourself.  Life is really, really hard; it can even be unbearable, but there are good things, too, and things to look forward to.  Like taking a trip to China to visit your sister.  Like walking around in the rain on a Saturday afternoon.  Like re-reading a favorite book.  Like things turning around---I can tell you from experience, it can happen, but you've got to *make* it happen.  It's not easy, but it's worth it.\n\nBut none of those things can happen if you kill yourself, so stick around.  You can make it through. I know that things have been difficult---maybe even downright awful---for a long time.  You *can* make it through, though.  Please don't kill yourself.\n\nI hope that something I've said has been helpful.  If not, I'm sure someone will be along soon with better words.  At any rate, please feel free to PM me if you want.

With that said, my build is very very similar to their's, getting a Philo Stone + HoG early, the appropriate boots (Tabi or Merc), and then Triforce. I usually get Sheen, Phage, then Zeal in that order, because Sheen gives me amazing burst damage with my E+Q combo, Phage because I technically auto-attack multiple times in succession due to attack reset through Q so getting the proc off is actually relatively easy, and then Zeal to finish it off.\n\nI actually like rushing a Shurelya's on him. His ult is a great \"get in the center of their team and ult\" kind of skill, but my flash's CD is high enough that I cannot flash in every single time to do it. His E offers a great gap closer for his ult too, but with Shurelya's I too can guarantee another method to close gap and keep them in my ult's AOE for the entire duration. It synergizes with his ult very very well when activated.\n\nHis Q is great for taking out towers. It actually does the additional damage from his Q onto the tower, but no armor reduction. Still, with sheen proc + his Q additional damage, I have done around 350-400dmg to a tower when my Q is maxed.\n\nMy typical skill order is E Q W E E R, and then I priority R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; W.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311721648", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Aftermarket mods?  Depends on what you're talking about.\n\nIn the case of non performance accessories, such as body kits, stereo components, etc., then you simply need to make sure they're aware of these things... they will charge you a bit more (based on declared value), but it's usually not much.\n\nIn the case of performance mods, if you have serious performance mods, your company may refuse to cover you in the event of an at-fault accident.  Trust me, even if your mods played no part in the accident, an insurance company, no matter how good or how nice, will ***A L W A Y S*** look for a way not to pay a claim.  (One general exception to this is a simple exhaust/intake mod - if you are one of those folks who likes the sound of a fart cannon on the back of your Civic, it's probably not going to affect your insurance rates so have fun.)\n\nMost people don't know that a nitrous bottle, or a bolt on supercharger kit, or whatever will keep their insurance company from paying when they run into another car.  Even brake and suspension mods can cause a company to not pay a claim, with the mindset that you changed the odds of how the OEM vehicle setup was rated for coverage (even if you IMPROVED the safety).  It's in the fine print.\n\nI actually was insured with a carrier I'd been with for years before becoming an agent, and who I didn't represent.  They were just a really great company not many people had heard of (Horrace Mann, later, Teacher's Insurance Company).

Been with them for a decade now and they've never questioned any claims (been rear ended 4 times between me and my wife), have always been more than competitive on the rates, and their website is extremely easy to use.  In addition, their people on the phones are AWESOME.

{"body": "Theory is hard to get into, but once you understand the basics it is not so bad. But it's really really important to start at the beginning and work up, and to make sure you understand everything.\n\nStart with learning your clefs (pretty much just treble and bass), and how to read music. Know how sharps and flats work (I don't know how good you are at reading). It would also be good to know how time signatures work, and how to write different notes and rests (quarter, eighth, etc).\n\nThe next thing to learn is how intervals work. An interval is the space between two notes. I'll try to explain with words the best I can. An interval could be unison, a second, third, fourth, etc. (An eighth is an octave). But most of the time the biggest interval you'll worry about is an octave. (Because a ninth is essentially a second) So say you have the note C, and you want to know what the interval between that and the E above it is - it would be a third. You'll count the note you start on, the notes above or below it, and the note you end on to say what the interval is. So C (1) - D (2) - G (3). Or maybe you're starting on Ab and you're looking for the interval to the F above it - that would be a sixth.\n\nIntervals can be major or minor and augmented or diminished and perfect. But not all of them can have those labels. Intervals that are in unison, fourths, fifths, and octaves are all 'perfect,' but they cannot be major or minor. They can only be augmented or diminished (except unison can't be diminished). 2nds, 3rds, 6ths, and 7ths and be major, minor, aug, and dim. Now, to explain some things... \n\nAn interval will tell you how many steps are between the notes. In western music, the smallest division is a half-step. Every adjacent note has 2 half-steps between them, except B/C and E/F. So think of it like A (2) B (1 ) C (2) D (2) E (2) F (1) G (2) A. That's why an Fb is an E natural. You should remember this for intervals (if I knew how to format things I would, sorry):\n\nUnison (0 half-steps)\n\nMinor 2nd (1 half-step)\n\nMajor 2nd (2 half-steps or 1 whole step)\n\nMinor 3rd (1 1/2 steps)\n\nMajor 3rd (2 steps)\n\nPerfect 4th (2 1/2 steps)\n\nAug 4th or Dim 5th, also known as a tritone (3 steps)\n\nPerfect 5th (3 1/2 steps)\n\nMinor 6th (4 steps)\n\nMajor 6th (4 1/2 steps)\n\nMinor 7th (5 steps)\n\nMajor 7th (5 1/2 steps)\n\nOctave (6 steps)\n\nAnd really the best you can do it memorize that. So going back to the example C - E, which we said was a third... it would be a major third, because there are 4 half-steps in between them. But if you were going from C - Eb it would be a minor third. \n\nNow, augmented and diminished does not necessarily mean making things flat and sharp. Think of it more as adding or taking away space between the notes. So, C# - Eb would still be a third. However, there are only 2 half-steps in between them. If you look at the list above, it would line up with a major second, but since it is a third it needs another name. That is why it would be called a diminished third. Also, that is why unison can't be diminished; two notes that are the same cannot get any smaller. But D - D# would be an aug. unison.\n\nAfter you understand intervals, you should learn scales. Scales are determined by the sharps and flats in them, and also the intervals between the notes. All major scales have the same intervals; the notes are just different. So C major goes C D E F G A B C. Or the half steps would look like 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. So the key of C# major would go C# D# E# F# G# A# B# C#. Even though the notes are all changed the intervals are still the same. Or Bb major goes Bb C D Eb F G A Bb. Same thing. The best way to learn scales is the [circle of fifths](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg/400px-Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg.png). (That one has minor keys on there too which are denoted by lowercase letters).\n\nThere are three different types of minor keys. Natural (no notes are changed), Harmonic (the 7th note (or scale degree) in the scale is raised), and Melodic (the 6th and 7th are raised while ascending, but lowered while descending). Knowing your keys and key signatures and memorizing them are essential in theory. A good way to do that is to install [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) and one of the more popular flash card sets is key signatures.\n\nAfter scales you can start learning chords. A chord is three or more (different) notes. Chords can also be major and minor and diminished and augmented. That is also determined by the notes' intervals that are in the chord. And I'd explain it further but it's late now and I'm tired so I'm going to bed. :P So PM me or comment if anything isn't clear and I'm forgetting things, or if you want better pictures and examples.

For example, the second mode of the major scale begins on D:\n\nD E F G A B C D = W H W W W H W\n\nThe third mode:\n\nE F G A B C D E = H W W W H W W\n\nEtc.\n\nThe modes are traditionally called Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian. \n\nFor C major, the relative (as in modes related to C major-if we use Bb major, then the related key for all the modes would be Bb) modes are: C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian, and B Locrian. \n\nThe Ionian mode is the major scale and the Aeolian mode is the minor scale (called the relative minor of whatever key you are in)\n\nGiven the pattern of half and whole tones for all the modes, you can quickly determine the mode structures for any note.

{"body": "&gt;Each scale consists of a contiguous set of 12 notes, each one semitone apart, with a given starting point.\n\nNot quite. There are 12 notes in total to choose from, and every scale consists of some subset of those 12 notes. There is only one scale that consists of 12 notes: the [chromatic scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale). The chromatic scale does not have a starting point, since it contains all the notes. All other scales are ordered subsets of the chromatic scale.\n\n&gt;Different scales sound different because the 'missing sharps' - the B-C and E-F intervals - appear at different points in the sequence.\n\nWe need to be careful with what we mean by \"different scales\". The B major scale is a different scale from the C major scale in a different way than the B major scale is different from the B [hungarian gypsy scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_gypsy_scale).\n\nAll scales (except chromatic, as I explained above) have this in common: \n\n- A scale starts on a note (the *tonic*, or simply the I (that's a roman numeral one, and you say \"the one\")), and is referred to by this note (ie. B major, E minor pentatonic).\n- A scale is a subset of the chromatic scale \n- The scale is defined by intervals. The intervals are what make the scale what it is—not the pitch names themselves.\n\nSo when I tell you to play a B major scale, the \"major\" part tells you a lot more than the \"B\" part. All \"B\" tells you is \"start on B\". \"Major\" tells you:\n\n\"There are 7 notes in this scale. The second note is up two semitones. The third note is up four semitones. The fourth note is up five semitones. The fifth note is up seven semitones. The sixth note is up nine semitones. The seventh note is up eleven semitones.\"\n\nSo if I were then to tell you to play me an F major scale, I'm telling you:\n\n\"Start on F. There are 7 notes in this scale. The second note is up two semitones. The third note is up four semitones. The fourth note is up five semitones. The fifth note is up seven semitones. The sixth note is up nine semitones. The seventh note is up eleven semitones.\"\n\nAs you learn more scales, all you're learning is more interval sets. Some involve going up three or four semitones, some involve going up only one semitone a few times in a row followed by a jump of three. Really, any subset of the chromatic scale that you can construct is a scale, technically, but some of them will sound bad. [Here is a list of scales from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_scales_and_modes).\n\nSing \"Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do\". You just did all the interval jumps of the major scale in your head without thinking about it (you started on an arbitrary note, but that's okay. With training you could learn to start on a particular note, so if I told you 'sing a C major scale' you would sing what you just sang with 'Do' being a C rather than an arbitrary note). It's really not as hard as it seems like it should be when you write it out on paper—sort of like walking, which should by all accounts be a baffling ordeal as well.\n\n&gt;A key consists of an arbitrary(?) subset of the notes of a given scale.\n\nA key is typically defined by a scale, and that scale is typically a major scale.\n\n&gt;Key names consist of a base note - the scale in question - plus an optional modifier denoting how the subset is chosen. So the key of C is a subset of the range C...B, the key of D is a subset of the range D...C#, and the key of D minor (assuming it exists) is a different subset of the range D...C#.\n\nYou are describing a scale. Then a key is defined in terms of a scale. The \"optional modifier\" isn't really optional—if it's omitted, you assume major. \n\nIf I tell you a song is in the key of C, that is sort of like saying: \n\n\"Most or all of the notes in this song will belong to the C major scale. If you feel like improvising a solo in the middle of the song, if you stick with notes from the C major scale, you can't really go wrong. If you play notes from the F# major scale, it will probably sound really bad, so stay away from those. There is a high probability that the last note in the melody will be a C.\"\n\n&gt;Specifically, a key consists of seven of the 12 notes in its scale - C major being [A,B,C,D,E,F] with intervals of [2,2,1,2,2,2,1] semitones between each.\n\nSo, that's the C major scale that you've described. Then if we say that the song is in C, we're saying that most of the notes in the melody will come from the C major scale. Keep in mind though that a scale does *not* need to contain 7 notes; as I mentioned, the chromatic scale contains all 12, whereas a pentatonic scale would contain five, the whole note scale contains 6, etc. There's no rule about how many notes a scale must contain.\n\n&gt;Music played in a given key will generally consist only of that subset of notes.\n\nI would say mostly. Sometimes you might *want* a note that's not in the key. That's where it stops being science and starts being art.\n\n&gt;Different keys, as well as having different starting points, will divvy up the semitone intervals differently, so presumably you could have intervals of [1,2,2,1,2,2,2] from a given start. (would that be the key of B? I just shifted the sequence back one notch)\n\nIf a song is in the key of B, that means that most of the notes in the melody will come from the B major scale. The B major scale is the same set of interval jumps as the C major scale, translated down one semitone. So the C major scale contains C D E F G A B, and the B major scale contains B C# D# E F# G# A# (# means sharp).\n\nWhat you're describing is a [mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode). A mode is where you take the same intervals, but pick a different note as the starting point. Naturally there are 7 modes of the major scale, since there are 7 notes that you could start on. The one you've described is the [Locrian Mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode#Locrian_.28VII.29). So what we're doing when we play the Locrian Mode of the C major scale is we are taking the set of notes picked out by the designation \"C major\", but instead of playing from C to B, we play from B to A.\n\n&gt;Each of the seven notes in the key can be denoted as I..VII, and these labels are used to denote the base notes of chords when describing the 'chord progression' of a piece - the exact flavour (major, minor, diminished etc) being specified elsewhere (how and where?)\n\nTypically upper case roman numerals signify major and lower case signify minor. Then if you want you can start adding in notation for 7 (just put a 7), diminished (usually dim), and etc. \n\nIt's important to note though, that only certain chords will \"fit\" into a certain key. For instance, let's say we have a song in C major. The notes of the C major scale, again, are\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nSo I will denote a C major *chord*. A major chord is just the I, III, and V notes of a major scale played together. So C major will contain C E G.\n\nIt is far more likely that the ii chord will sound good in our song than the II chord. Why? The ii would be D minor, and the II would be D major. The D major chord, like the C major chord, picks out the I, III, and V notes from the D major scale. Those are D F# A. Now since our song is in the key of C, we want the notes in the song to come from the C major scale. F# is not in the C major scale, and thus the D major chord doesn't \"fit\" with our key. \n\nOn the other hand, the D *minor* chord picks out the I, III, and V notes from a D *minor* scale. Those are D F A. All of those notes are in the C major scale, as well as being in the D minor scale, so the D minor *does* fit in with our key.\n\n&gt;People do this shit in their heads\nIn realtime.\nSomewhat akin to doing N-body orbital mechanics by the seat of your pants\nAnd consider it a relaxing diversion.\nWhile drunk.\nI am several hundred IQ points below the mean.\n\nYes. Although, in practice it's not as hard as it sounds. You start to visualize shapes and patterns rather than intervals and notation, and once you understand the basic mechanics of a major scale and a minor scale, stuff just kind of starts flowing together.

{"body": "Music Theory is kind of a HUGE topic. For starters, here's how scales work (And for all the pedants, all of this is pertaining to typical Western music):\n\nThere are 12 different recognized notes in the musical alphabet:\n\nA - A#/Bb - B - C - C#/Db - D - D#/Eb - E - F - F#/Gb - G - G#/Ab\n\nAll the Sharp/Flat (# and b respectively) pairs, for instance A# and Bb, are the same note with two different names.\n\nEach of these notes is a \"half-step\" apart. This will be eays for you to grasp as a guitarist - each fret is a half-step from the next, so your first fret on your A string, an A# or a Bb depending on how you look at it, is half a step from the second fret, which is a B. Two half-steps is a whole-step.\n\nA scale takes these notes, keeps them in the same order, and gives them a pattern. Each \"flavor\" of scale (Major, Minor, etc.) is just a different pattern. For instance, here's the pattern for a Major Scale (W means Whole-step, h means half-step):\n\nW - W - h - W - W - W -h\n\nTo use this, pick a note to start from. We'll start from C because it's the easiest scale to remember, IMO. \n\nSo, C Major Scale. Let's do this shit. We start from our root note - in this case, C. If this were D Major, the root would be D. If it was G# mixolydian, our root would be G#. Nice and simple so far.\n\nNow we take our first step - in this case, a Whole-step. The next note after C is C#, but that's a half step - to get a Whole-step, we go one more, to D. Now we take another Whole-step, so we skip the very next note and keep the one after, E. Now a half-step, right up to F. Keep going on like that and you'll wind up with these notes:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nNice and easy, right? Now let's do it with a different scale. We'll try A Major. So, we take our root note, A. Go up a whole step, we've got B. Up another whole step... and now here things get weird... ish. The next note is C#/Db. The rule in music theory is if you can help it, you never want duplicate notes in your scale. Hold on to this one for a sec - the next note we need, up a half-step, is D, right? So far out scale looks like this:\n\nA B C#/Db D\n\nWe don't want any repeated notes, so we don't want to use D, whether #, b, or elsewise, twice. So we'll use C#, making our scale thus far look like this: \n\nA B C# D\n\nMusically, whether you say C# or Db if will sound the same and be played in the same spot. But the tried-and-true standard says keep duplicates out, so that's what we do.\n\nShit that's a lot of writing. Anyway, that's Major scales. If you want me to keep going, I can - there's a LOT more basic theory out there (Minor scales, for instance, as well as modes and the Circle of Fifths and that just scratches the surface).\n\n\nAlso, I learned music theory on bass, and I can tell you a lot of it is similar on guitar (as far as the basics go). One thing you'll notice that will REALLY benefit you is that for all your different scales you only need to know two things: the pattern for the scale, and where the root note is. For example, no matter what Major scale you play, whether it's A, C#, Db, or whatever, it'll be the exact same pattern of frets - you can move that pattern around the neck and just start from whatever root note is appropriate. For the record, the pattern looks like this:\n\n    -----------1-3-4--\n    -----1-2-4--------\n    -2-4--------------\n\nThat can start on either the E or A strings of the guitar. Don't think of those as frets, though, think of those as fingers: Index is 1, middle is 2, etc. So for E Major, you'd start at 7th fret on the A string, play the 9th fret on the A string, 6th fret on D, 7th Fret on D, etc. Make sense?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311967970", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Remember there are 12 notes in an octave: A, A#/Bb, B/Cb, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E/Fb, E#/F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab.\n\nA key concept to understand in music theory is that the notes you're playing doesn't matter quite as much as the intervals between the notes you're playing. For example, many songs are based on the major scale. To form a major scale, pick any starting note, and then make the following sequence of jumps to choose the rest of the notes: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.\n\nFor example, start with F#. The F# major scale is thus:\nF# G# A# B C# D# E# F# (follow this on keyboard if it's confusing; remember there is no semitone between B and C, nor between E and F).\n\nThere are other types of scales, such as the natural/harmonic/melodic minor, which similar to the major scale is just another sequence of different sized jumps. There are also more complicated modifications that can be made to produce new scales; see: church modes.\n\nNow, songs are written to be in certain \"keys,\" for example Stairway to Heaven is in A minor. The notes in A natural minor are A B C D E F G A (it is the relative minor to C major because both use the same notes). Therefore the notes played in this song are chosen based off this scale, possibly with a few exceptions. Listen to the solo in this song and see if you can hear the scale progressions.\n\nYou should know that certain intervals are considered more pleasing than others to hear. For example, fourths and fifths (7 and 9 half steps respectively) are considered very pleasing and show up all the time in music (your guitar strings are mostly offset by fourths under standard tuning). Conversely you'll almost never hear a third in modern music, although it was a popular interval to use a few centuries ago.\n\nThe story with chords is similar. A major triad is just three notes played at intervals of 4 and 3 half steps from the preceding notes. For example, the A major chord consists of A, C#, E. Similarly a minor chord has intervals of 3 and 4 instead of 4 and 3. For example, the B minor chord played in the verses of Comfortably Numb consists of B, D, F#.\n\nThere are lots of other chord types as well. A common one in modern rock music is the power chord, which consists of the root note, the fifth (as I said a common interval), and the octave. For example, the opening power chord of Smoke on the Water is G, E, higher G.\n\nI hope this basic introduction came off as somewhat coherent and not as a stream of consciousness.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311969162", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have one they are great. But first off they are not really a guitar or a ukulele, they are a hybrid. The A D G C E A tuning is ukulele tuning on 4 of the strings with added A D bass strings. It works as a travel \"guitar\" though and standard tuning songs sound great on it. Also one thing to consider is E A D G B E tuning doesn't work very well on the Guitalele because the string tension gets too loose. The volume is decent for something so small, and you can get some pretty nice sound out of them. There is no trust rod because ukuleles don't need them.

{"body": "I'm glad you enjoyed it. I remembered that I did leave out scales, so I'll write up something about those, and that should hopefully answer your question.\n\nA scale is just a sequence of notes going in order from lowest to highest. Normally, when practicing, you'll do a scale for a whole octave, going from, say A to the next A above it, then back down to the original A. The progression of notes in a scale will always sound the same, regardless of which note you start on, as long as it is the same type of scale. There are many types of scales, but the most common is a major scale. So, for example, the A major, C major, B-flat major, etc scales will have the same \"sound\" to it, but just pitched lower. This is hard to explain, so listen to it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:C_major.ogg). That is C major. The formula of a major scale is simple. The easiest way to do it is look at a piano. Pick any note you want, and you can make a major scale from it if you think about it. Start on that note, and move up as follows, playing each note: 2 keys – 2 keys – 1 key – 2 keys – 2 keys – 2 keys – 1 key. You should end up back on your original not, but an octave higher. That was a major scale. C major is the most simple, its notes being (C D E F G A B C). Another example is Eb major (Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb). I couldn't find an example of this, but the progression sounds very similar. Try it on a piano. Other than major scales, there are many different types scales including minor. The most common type of minor (called *natural minor*) is similar to major. In order to turn a major scale into a minor scale, bring the third, sixth, and seventh notes down a half-step. So that makes the C *minor* scale (C D Eb F G Ab Bb C). But wait. Do you notice how the C minor scale has the exact same flat notes as the Ab major scale? Scales that coincide like this are called *Relative keys*. I could go into even more advanced types of scales, but this is the most basic.\n\nSmall note: Piano minor chords. Take C, for example. Doing a C chord takes the first, third, and fifth notes (C, E, G) and plays them all at once. [Listen here.](http://www.8notes.com/piano_chord_chart/C.asp) As you know, C minor drops the third, sixth, and seventh notes. However, the only note that is affected in an ordinary C minor chord is the third. [Listen here.](http://www.8notes.com/piano_chord_chart/Cm.asp) See how the minor chord sounds darker, and more... mysterious, so to speak? That is the difference between using major and minor. It's to get different emotions out of a song.\n\nLet's talk about keys. We briefly touched on them in the key signatures section. As I said, key signatures are used to show you the key of a song. In simpler songs, the entire song will have the same sharps and flats as dictated by the key signature, but *why*? Well, have you ever noticed that singing the wrong note in a song isn't just wrong, but it sounds *horribly* bad compared to other parts of the song? That because the range of notes used in a song is dictated by what key it is in. This is based on a scale. A song in the key of Eb major, having no sharps or flats, will only use notes Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, and G, with some accidentals (notes which go against the key signature) thrown in every once and a while. Songs can also be in minor keys. A song in the key of C minor will also use those same notes, but will sound darker. Remember the C minor chord? That's how it sounds.\n\nProtips: Key signatures will only add flats/sharps in a certain order. There is only one key signature with one flat: that flat is a Bb, and the key is F. Here is the order of flats added before you've added them all: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb, Fb. Sharps are different. The first sharp added is an F#, and that is the key of G. Here is the order of sharps added: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#. Note that these are reverses of each other. \n\nAlso, It seems I haven't mentioned this yet, so I will now. There is no semitone between E and F, and there is also none between B and C. Don't ask why, because I have no idea. When a song calls for Cb, Fb, B#, or E#, just go to the note above it instead. Cb = B ; B# = C ; Fb = E ; E# = F. This is uncommon, but by no means rare. Being a tuba player, I commonly see Cb, and the occasional Fb. However, only the dickiest of composers will write me an E# or a B#. \n\nSomething else I haven't mentioned: tempo, dynamics, and articulation. Tempo is the speed of music. In a 4/4 time signature, it is expressed by how fast the quarter note goes, but in others it might be how fast the eighth note or half note is (remember the uncommon time signatures, with numbers other than 4 on the bottom?). Usually it is BPM, or beats per minute. Easy way to remember: 60 BPM is one beat per second, 120 is two beats per second, 240 is four beats per second. However, on a lot of pieces you won't see BPM, but rather Italian words that tell you how fast to go. Here's some copypasta from wikipedia. I've bolded the most common ones:\n\nLarghissimo — very, very slow\n\nGrave — slow and solemn\n\nLento — slowly\n\n**Largo — broadly**\n\nLarghetto — rather broadly\n\n**Adagio — slow and stately (literally, \"at ease\")**\n\nAdagietto — rather slow\n\nAndante Moderato — a bit slower than andante\n\n**Andante — at a walking pace**\n\nAndantino – slightly faster than andante\n\n**Moderato — moderately**\n\nAllegretto — moderately fast (but less so than allegro)\n\nAllegro moderato — moderately quick\n\n**Allegro — fast, quickly and bright**\n\n**Vivace — lively and fast (quicker than allegro)**\n\nVivacissimo — very fast and lively\n\nAllegrissimo — very fast\n\n**Presto — very fast**\n\nPrestissimo — extremely fast\n\nThese tempo markings are placed [here](http://www.finalemusic.com/usermanuals/finale2011win/content/image490.gif) on a staff. Occasionally it will be used to explain a feeling that you should convey through the music, not a speed per se. sometimes, below or under the music, there will be markings that indicate change in tempo. Commonly, they are accelerando (speed up), and ritardando/rallentando (slow down). There are sometimes abbreviated as acc, rit or ritard, and rall or rallen, respectively. These terms may also be accompanied by molto (much) or poco a poco (little by little) to explain how much change to make. Dynamics is how loudly you play. It is placed under the music as an italicized letter representing what it is. This is mostly what you will see:\n\nppp - pianississimo - very very softly\n\npp - pianissimo - very softly\n\np - piano - softly\n\nmp - mezzo piano - moderately softly\n\nmf - mezzo forte - moderately loudly\n\nf - forte - loudly\n\nff - fortissimo - very loudly\n\nfff - fortississimo - very very loudly\n\nfz - fortzando - a sudden, forceful note\n\nsfz - sfortzando - a sudden, very forceful note\n\nfp - forte piano - loud hit, followed by an immediate piano-level note.\n\nsfzp/fzp - sfortzando piano/fortzando piano - more forceful opening hit before backing off; a combination of sfz/fz and fp\n\nThere are also markings to indicate a gradual change. These look like [this](http://studio3music.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/crescendo-decrescendo.png), and are called crescendo (getting louder) and decrescendo or diminuendo (getting quieter). The big end is the louder one, so change dynamics (volume) accordingly. Finally, articulation. These are simply markings placed above/below the oval of the note (depending on whether the stem is up or down) that tell you how you should play a specific note. A staccato mark is a dot that tells you to play the note about half its length. It's used for jumpy or sudden parts, like the bass line of a march. A marcato or accent (small, wide triangle with no left side, looks like a skinny decrescendo) implies that you should play the note more forcefully, but with its full value. A martellato, called a marcato by wind or jazz players, (looks like a tent above/below the note) tells you to play the note at 3/4 length and accent it. A tenuto (line above/below note) dictates that you should hold the note out with little separation between it an surrounding notes. More rarely, staccatissimo markings (pike above/below a note) are extremely short, a staccato on steroids. Tenutos can also be expressed as slurs. This looks like a line for tied notes, but pulled over many notes. [Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Notation_accents1.png) is all of the articulation markings, and [here](http://www.sibeliusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/slurs_after.png) is a slur. (By the way, the marking on the last note of the second picture is a natural sign.)\n\nIf anyone wants it, I can go even further into music theory.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312133745", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry if any of that was unclear.\n\n* Yes, that's exactly right. Sometimes notes that go against the key are used, but only sometimes. A basic song will only use the notes from a certain scale.\n\n* It's because each scale is made up of all the notes between it in alphabetical order. An F scale, for example must be made up of the notes F G A B C D E F, with corresponding flats and shaps to turn it into whatever type of scale you want, where it's a major, minor, or even an Adonai malakh scale! (That's a real thing, by the way.) For example, an F major scale is F G A **Bb** C D E F. It would be less clear to say that it goes F G A **A#** C D E F, because B is not there, and A is used twice. This would go against the fundamental definition of a scale.\n* Originally, to save space. Back in the old days when composers wrote music all by hand, if they wanted to have four staccato eighth notes without articulation markings, they would have to write a sixteenth note and a sixteenth rest four times. It's much quicker to write a dot above four eighth notes, not to mention much less complicated and cluttered to read.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312137577", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Its not just a matter of being messy looking; the way that keys and notation are set up is based on the major scale. Music theory and notation are set up around stability (harmony). The C Major scale is the most stable and 'right' sounding scale, and all others are set up around it. Why don't we just drop the g and have 6 evenly spaced notes? Because that doesn't describe how they are used by musicians. Major scales don't have 6 notes, they have 7. C major has C D E F G A B C, and it's not entirely arbitrary. There are seven unique notes, thus seven unique letters. All the other scales are notated by their deviation from the C scale. In order for the G Major scale to start on G and maintain the pleasing, harmonious half half whole half half half whole progression of the major scale, the F note must be moved up a half step (made sharp), so the scale is notated as G A B C D E F# G. \n\nLike OpinionGenerator said:\n\"…it has more to do with the way it's drawn on sheet music as I explained more above. Even the D major scale looks neat on sheet music (because all the messy elements are detailed in the key signature at the beginning of the piece)\"\nIt looks neat because every major scale contains one note of each letter, and the key signature tells us whatever changes we have to make from the C Major scale in order to play in key. If there is a # on the F line, we know that every time we see an F, we play an F#. If we used the truncated, 6 letter scale, a key like C, D, E, E#, F#, A#, B# C, would have two E's: E natural and E sharp. You have to notate the difference *every* time there's a different one. *That's* messy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312147911", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
