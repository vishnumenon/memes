That was fixed with an evolution though. We nurtured that chao like our own children. Gave it every fruit, every animal to level it up. One time it got sick, and I don't think my heart had ever beat so fast. That was the pride and joy of me and my brother in our elementary school days. Our biggest accomplishment.

{"body": "Linked lists are kind of an array, the main difference is that a linked list can change length, whereas an array is staticly defined.\nEvery element in a linked list has:\n\n* the content\n* a pointer to the next element\n* optionally, a pointer to the previous element (double linked list)\n\nIt's important to remember that the last element must have NULL as next pointer, and the first element, if you are using a double linked list, must have the previous element pointing to NULL. Unless you want something special like a circular list. \nIf you don't remember to do this, you will experience segmentation faults.\nThe most common way to cycle through linked list is (in C, but other languages have similar syntax):\n\n    list *tmp;\n    list *head; //the first element of your list\n    for(tmp=head; tmp-&gt;next; tmp=tmp-&gt;next) {//do stuff }\n\nBinary trees are lists where every element has two children (usually named left and right). It has no important difference from a linked list. So, you'll need: the content, a pointer to the left child and a pointer to the right child. Here too, element with no children (left or right or both) must have those pointers equal to NULL. This data structure is usually traversed with recursion, something like that (this time in pseudocode):\n\n    function traverse(tree *root)\n    {\n        // if you have a tree like this: \n                       A\n                   B       C\n                D     E\n        //this program will print out A B D E C\n        print (root-&gt;data);\n        if root-&gt;left != NULL then traverse (root-&gt;left);\n        if root-&gt;right != NULL then traverse (root-&gt;right);\n    }\n\n~~Note: &gt; doesn't seem to work, it's replaced with &amp; gt;~~ RES live preview fault", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312307030", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I understand your point. I think this is really, really difficult. Cutting through the massive complexity of this sort of issue is quite important, while retaining its complexity is just as important. Here a diversity of tactics would seem to be important; a mix of actual platforms, such as universal coverage and messages that can at times be simple is important. Regarding health coverage, for example, I thought it would, and may, after 2012, be very important to, among other things, be able to push some rather hard hitting points through with a very *deliberate* simplification. Not over-simplification, but at times simplification, the problem presented by the GWB's and Tea Partiers of the world notwithstanding, is necessary. Indeed, it is partly because of those over-simplifiers that at times good, true enough and hard-hitting simplifications have to be pushed forward in a hard-hitting way. I.e., if you buy the stat, 44,000 people dying every hear due to lack of health insurance. That's **ten times as many as died in 911 every year**. **E V E R Y     Y E A R **. Hehe. Well that's the point: that should have been pushed harder, real hard. Members of congress going on fasts hard. The moderation that has been taken by the always more complicated democrats backfired in that respect, at that juncture. When you have a real stat, buried beneath the *very menu-able complexity* -- and the republicans are, above all else, *menuers* -- there are times when you have to do the real opposite of being measured, mitigated and moderate: you have to be hard hitting, hyperbolic and hysterical. And alliterative. :) \n\nEdit: formatting and spelling of a non-word (menu-able)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312395013", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Chords are actually (IIRC) derived from scales by taking every other note, for example, the notes in the CMaj scale:\n\nC D E F G A B C, would produce: C E G  (or C E G B if you want to keep the 7th note, making it a maj7). This also applies for minor chords by flatting the 3rd, making C D# G, which is Cm.\n\nNow, if you take each note and add a third twice to each (Essentially going up two notes of the scale) you would get:\n\n(C E G - Cmaj) (D F A - Dmin) (E G B - Emin) (F A C - Fmaj) (G B D - Gmaj) (A C E - Amin) (B D F - Bdim)\n\nAll these scales and chords are \"in key\" with Cmaj, as they are all derived from the Cmaj scale. If you've ever seen the chord progression I IV V I that would essentially mean using the respective chords out of the scale, essentially what David had said. So in Cmaj it would be:\n\nCmaj - Fmaj - Gmaj - Cmaj\n\nSo now if you know the key that the song is in, it's possible to work out which chords (and scales) would fit within that key, however just because the scales you are playing are in key doesn't mean that they will sound good, but it's always good to know the possible scales you can use. If you're looking to just throw out some chords then you can either learn some popular chord progressions (such as the I IV V I, which I think is used in pop) or make your own and see what sound good.\n\nSorry if I missed anything or didn't explain something very well, I'm sure there's a lot more theory but this is what I know.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312395257", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Where provided, spending totals are for fiscal year 2008. \n\n● Agriculture Department: Market Access Program. This program \nhands out more than $200 million annually to exporters of agricultural \nproducts to pay for their overseas advertising. Some of the recipients \ninclude the Brewers Association, the Pet Food Institute, Sunkist \nGrowers, Welch’s Food, and the Wine Institute. \n\n● Commerce Department: Advanced Technology Program. This \n$198 million program gives research grants to high-tech companies. \n\n● Foreign Military Financing. U.S. taxpayers fund weapons purchases \nby foreign governments through this $4.7 billion program. \n\n● Amtrak. The fe de r a l pas se nger r a i l company r ec ei ve s a bout \n$1.4 billion in subsidies annually. But Amtrak would be better off \nprivatized so it could cut inefficient routes, maximize profits, and \ninnovate. \n\n● Export-Import Bank. This agency uses taxpayer dollars to subsidize \nthe financing of foreign purchases of U.S. goods. It makes billions \nof dollars of preferential loans to foreigners, guarantees the loans of \nprivate institutions, and provides export credit insurance. In 2007, a \nDallas television station (WFAA) discovered that the agency provided \n$243 million in loans to bogus Mexican companies, including \ndrug cartels. \n\n● Maritime Administration. This $591 million agency provides sub- \nsidies to the commercial shipping and shipbuilding industries. For \nexample, the agency provides loan guarantees for purchases of ships \nfrom U.S. shipyards. But the best way to ensure a vigorous U.S.- \nowned ship industry is to reduce domestic taxes and regulations, \nwhich have encouraged the industry to move offshore. \n\n● Energy Department: Energy Supply Research. This $894 million \nprogram aims to develop new and improved energy technologies. \nBut the energy industry itself should fund such work, since it will \nearn profits when breakthroughs are made. \n\n● Small Business Administration. This $530 million agency provides \nsubsidized loans and loan guarantees to small businesses. It has a \npoor record of selecting businesses to support, as its loans have high \nrates of delinquency. \n\n*From the Cato Handbook for the 108th Congress ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312408117", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey, I'll try my best to give you a little insight into the theory of this type of music and some basic analysis of the songs.\n\nA bit of background \"pop/rock\" theory first.... I'll assume you're somewhat familiar with major and minor scales and Roman Numeral chord notation for chords built on a scale. I'll use the key of C for my examples.\n\nPop music, Adult Contemporary, etc., usually uses chords built off the notes of the major scale. The most commonly used chords are I, ii, IV, V, and vi. So in C major (C D E F G A B), most of the time you'll see these chords being used: C, Dm, F, G, and Am.\n\nBlues, Rock, Alternative, Metal, R&amp;B, Dance music, etc., often use the MINOR scale instead... or something similar, like a blues scale, phrygian scale -- basically anything that flattens a bunch of notes in our C major scale. \n\nThe C minor scale is C D Eb F G Ab Bb C. The twist is that in blues/rock/etc., we often build MAJOR chords on top of most of these notes. So you might see a song made up of these chords: C, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C  -- where all of those are major chords.\n\nBecause we're playing major chords, it's not fair to say we're in the key of C minor even though we're following a C minor scale, especially if the \"home\" chord is a C major chord!. So I'll usually notate the chords using roman numerals relative to the major scale. Thus, a song in C/Cm with the major chords C Eb F Ab Bb  would be notated I, bIII, IV, bVI, bVII. Another way to look at it is that the C minor scale is just the C major scale with a flattend third, flattened 6th, and flattened 7th -- so you'll see a lot of bIII, bVI, and bVIIs, but you will still see the normal I, IV, V, and even ii chords.\n\nNow I said we play MAJOR chords on the scale, but not always. Particularly on I, IV, and V, we'll sometimes play these as MINOR chords instead. This works because of the minor scale. Note that C minor (C-Eb-G) sounds normal because the scale we're basing the song on has an Eb in it (it's actually more weird that we can play a major chord and have it sound normal). Same for the IV chord, it can be played as IV major (F) or iv minor (Fm: F-Ab-C), because of the Ab that is in the C minor scale. And same with the V chord (G vs Gm). So you get lots of chord options that \"just work\" in the song.\n\nFurthermore, in a lot of rock music, guitars play \"power chords\", which are just 2 notes (the 1st and the 5th of the triad), leaving out the important middle note (the 3rd) which would tell our ear whether to interpret the chord as major or minor. E.g. for a C chord, you'd play the notes C &amp; G. Without an E or Eb in the middle, the chord quality is ambiguous -- it's neither major or minor.\n\nAND, within the song we'll often switch randomly between major and minor and power chords. Sometimes I might play Cm, and other times C (major), or just C5 (C power chord). \n\nThe melody gets to have a lot of fun too in this type of music. Notice that in the I major chord (C major) the notes are c-e-g. Notice in the bIII chord (Eb major) the notes are Eb-G-Bb. So sometimes we'll sing an \"E\" (natural) to fit with a chord, and other times an E-flat. The song might jump right from a C chord to an Eb chord, so you'll hear melodies that move over an E note and immediately move to an Eb note. If power chords are being played, the singer has his/her choice of what type of 3rd to sing and can (and often does) randomly select either the minor or major type.\n\nIn alternative music with bands like NIN and Tool, they really like to sing over an ambiguous I chord (you can't tell if it's major or minor), but the song sounds dark and feels \"minory\", and the singer will sing a whole line that either avoids the 3rd of the scale or hits the flattened 3rd (Eb, so it definitely sounds minor), but *THEN* they'll end the phrase by singing the MAJOR 3rd note (e.g. E natural). This is like a [\"picardy third\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picardy_third), and gives a neat sound that you hear a lot in this type of music.\n\nTLDR:\n------\n* Pop music chords: I ii IV V vi  (C, Dm, F, G, Am)\n* Cool music chords: I bIII IV V bVI bVII  (C, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb)\n* Also: I, IV, V can be major or minor  (C or Cm, F or Fm, G or Gm)\n* Melody likes to change the 3rd note a lot -- sometimes flattend (\"Eb\") sometimes not (\"E\") -- and end phrases on the major 3rd (see Picardy Third). \n\nNext post: I'll show how the NIN songs follow common patterns based on the above concepts.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312524287", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I'll give this a try (if I understand your question).\n\nIn western music, an octave is divided into 12 semi-tones.  People worked out that you could pick 7 or so of those tones to create a scale (or 5 say for a pentatonic \"blues\" scale), and that those notes sounded good when sequenced into a melody.\n\nThe example we'll use is C Major.  A major scale is the old Do-Re-Mi scale, and you could say it has a fairly bright happy sound to it (as opposed to a minor scale).\n\nC Major is convenient because the notes are white keys on the piano: C D E F G A B.  No sharps or flats.\n\nThey also noticed that playing certain notes simultaneously (a chord) sounded harmonious, some don't work so well.\n\nThe gap between notes (the number of semitones) is called an interval.\n\nProbably the cleanest (most harmonious) interval is a perfect 5th.  For example C and G.  This is incidentally a \"power chord\" in rock music.\n\nOther intervals are a little more dissonant, but still sound good.  Such as a Major 3rd (4 semitones) or a minor 3rd (3 semitones).\n\nThe basic chords (triads) in a given scale are created by starting at one note, skip one, next note, skip one, next note.  For example C Major is C-E-G.\n\nIn the key of C you can play all the triads in the scale on a piano by playing the white keys in this pattern (note-skip-note-skip-note).\n\nSo you start with C Major: C-E-G.  \n\nNext is D minor: D-F-A.\n\nThen E minor: E-G-B\n\nThen F Major: F-A-C\n\netc...\n\nAs it turns out, a Major chord has 2 intervals: A Major 3rd with a minor 3rd on top.\n\nA Minor chord is the reverse: A minor third with a Major 3rd on top.\n\nNow, if you want to stack an additional note on your triad, you skip a note then play the next note.\n\nSo you might have C-E-G-B.  Which is called a C Major 7th.  It's a slightly dissonant chord (or colorful perhaps) because you've got two notes, B and C, that are only a semitone apart.  The intervals are Major 3rd, minor 3rd, Major 3rd.\n\nOne chord that is especially popular and fairly harmonious is a 7th chord at the 5th note of the scale. In the key of C Major this would be G7.  The notes are G-B-D-F.  The intervals are Major 3rd, minor 3rd, minor 3rd.  That top F note is a full-tone (two semitones) away from the G tonic.  So it's smoother sounding than the above example of C Maj 7.\n\nOf course, you don't need to only stick to the notes of a scale, you can use accidentals or whatever you want so long as it sounds good.\n\nTL;DR;  You can add an additional note to a basic triad for color.  7ths, Maj 7ths, 6ths, etc.  The difference in sound relates to the intervals between the various notes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312539993", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To *really* understand triads, [which are chords built on thirds consisting of a root, a major or minor third, and a diminished, perfect, or augmented fifth], I think one first needs to understand the major scale.\n\nAn arbitrary Major scale contains its Root, a note a whole-tone above it, a note a whole-tone above *that*, a note a half-tone above that and so on. \n\nHere is the basic pattern of the Major scale [R = Root, W = Whole-tone, H = Half-tone]:\n\nR W W H W W W H [which leads to the octave of the root.]\n\nA little visual diagram where these steps occur in C Major:\n\n    C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C\n      ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^\n      W   W   H   W   W   W   H\n\n*If this seems basic, then please bear with me for a moment.*\n\nStacking thirds:\n\nWe'll take this scale and apply each notes *diatonic* third. For now consider the word \"diatonic\" to mean \"proper to the scale\" - i.e. no accidental notes. Only those that occur within this scale. The thirds are the note 2 after the one we are stacking them on. E.g. C [skip D] **E** is the third, etc\n\n    C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C\n    E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E\n\nNotice how the notes stay in order starting from the E, so basically we shifted the scale and went from there... And using the same rule as above, repeat this process to stack another third:\n\n    C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C\n    E   F   G   A   B   C   D   E\n    G   A   B   C   D   E   F   G\n\nAnd again the notes stay in order shifting and starting from the G. \n\nRead these top-down as columns. These are the diatonic triads of the C Major scale. This is also called the *Major Harmonized Scale*. A big chunk of western music is made using these diatonic triads, though not necessarily always in the key of C Major of course!!\n\nEach triad has a position and a certain property. Allow me to illustrate:\n\n    I      CEG   Major   (Root + Major3 + Minor3)\n    ii     DFA   minor   (Root + minor3 + Major3)\n    iii    EGB   minor   (Root + minor3 + Major3)\n    IV     FAC   Major   (Root + Major3 + minor3)\n    V      GBD   Major (for now)   (Root + Major3 + minor3)\n    vi     ACE   minor   (Root + minor3 + Major3)\n    viio   BDF   diminished (Root + minor3 + minor3) (the little \"o\" symbol means diminished. Sometimes it's spelled \"dim\"\n\n*You'll notice how each triad *besides the diminished* is some combination of stacking Major and minor thirds. A major and minor third above a root will always give a perfect 5th, and this is why the diminished triad is what it is -- it is two minor thirds stacked together which give a *diminished* 5th.*\n\nWhen people spell out a progression, such as a I vi IV V, this is what they're talking about (forgetting about fancier chords like 7ths, 9ths, Add6ths, etc. for now). In this case a I vi IV V progression would be C Major, A minor, F Major, G Major.\n\nHere we have encountered the 3 most common triad types: Major, minor, and diminished. There is one other type of triad and that is called the Augmented triad. This triad is built with the same principles, but it occurs when one stacks a Major third on a Major third on a root. In other words it has a Major third and an \"Augmented\" or sharpened 5th. This type of triad does not occur within the diatonic harmonized scale! An example would be C-E-G#\n\nI'll leave this for now... But remember, one can keep stacking thirds to get diatonic 7th chords, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths. The same rules apply as they do with these basic triads!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312640518", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Curse my tiny netbook screen for not being able to see what I'm trying to write... :-(*\n\nNow that the basics of triad harmony and suspended chords are out of the way, we can get to something a little more interesting. Quartal and Quintal chords!! As triad chords are based on stacking diatonic thirds, Quartal and Quintal chords are based on stacking diatonic fourths and fifths respectively. Quartal and Quintal chords are inversions of one another, and although they sound different from one another, the function of the chords containing the same notes is *often*, though not always the same as each other.\n\nWe've already seen these in action, way up there in the little jaw-wag about sus chords!! And we also happened to look at a quartal and quintal voicing of the same chord -- er... sort of. Remember how C Sus4 and F Sus2 contain the same notes?\n\n    C Sus4 = C F G Re-arranged = F C G\n    F Sus2 = F G C Re-arranged = F C G\n\nThese are different inversions of the same basic chord. We can re-arrange the notes of those two chords in two very interesting ways: G C F and F C G. You'll see why in a little bit. \n\nThe principles of quartal and quintal harmony are very similar to triadic harmony, but a little bit different...\n\nFirst, lets ignore what I just said above and consider inversions containing the same notes to be different chords for now, and we're going to start from the root and add to that sequentially by stacking.\n\nFirst, C Major Diatonic 3-note quartal groups. [Some call them *quartal triads*, but that's not very well known. Stick with \"quartal groups\" or \"quartal tone groups\" or something like that for now.]\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n    F G A B C D E F\n    B C D E F G A B\n\nSince quartal chords lack a third, and it is the third that gives the basic Major or minor tonality, these chords are all pretty ambiguous with the exception of the C-F-B and F-B-E groups/chords since they contain the tritone [i.e. Augmented fourth] or diminished fifth interval between the B and F respectively. Interestingly, the *interval* between a perfect fourth and a perfect fifth are both inversions of one of another, which also means that the augmented fourth and diminished fifth are inversions of each other...\n\nI don't know if there is a common way of illustrating quartal chords like triad-based chords with the normal Roman-numeral notation, so I *might* be doing something weird here... Here we have the notes and a simple way of playing them on the guitar using horizontal TAB:\n\n    [I]      CFB   x-3-3-4-x-x\n    [ii]     DGC   x-5-5-5-x-x\n    [iii]    EAD   x-7-7-7-x-x\n    [IV]     FBE   x-8-9-9-x-x\n    [V]      GCF   x-10-10-10-x-x *REMEMBER ME?*\n    [vi]     ADG   x-12-12-12-x-x\n    [vii]    BEA   x-14-14-14-x-x\n\nI've kept the scale-degrees in brackets to illustrate just how different these quartal chords are to their basic triad counterparts. These kind of 3-note quartal groups often do not have a particular function based on the scale-degree on which they occur, though sometimes they do!\n\nOf course, one can keep stacking fourths to get 4-note and 5-note groups for as long as you want to, but they get weird to play on the guitar.\n\nJust a quick note on quintal chords, which are chords based on stacking fifths. They are.. well, lets just look at them for a moment. Again, diatonic to the key of C Major:\n\n    [I]      CGD   x-3-5-7-x-x\n    [ii]     DAE   x-5-7-9-x-x\n    [iii]    EBF   x-7-9-10-x-x\n    [IV]     FCG   x-8-10-12-x-x *REMEMBER ME?*\n    [V]      GDA   x-10-12-14-x-x or x-x-5-7-x-5\n    [vi]     AEB   x-12-14-16-x-x or x-x-7-9-x-7\n    [vii]    BFC   x-14-15-17-x-x or x-x-9-10-x-8\n\nLook at these charts for quartal and quintal harmony, look at sus chords, and look at the basic triads.

{"body": "Yes, I would definitely memorize the pattern of whole and half-steps that make up the scale instead of just drilling the notes of each key into your head. Once you know the pattern, you can figure out any scale on your own, so straight memorization is unnecessary.

What are the notes in, let's say, E Major? I don't know them off the top of my head, but applying the pattern we can figure them out.\n\nFirst note is E. This is (hopefully) obvious.\n\nThe second note is a whole-step up from E, which is F# (Remember that E-F is a half step, as well as B-C).\n\nThe third note is a whole-step up from F#, which is G#.\n\nThe fourth note is a half-step up from G#, which is A.\n\nThe fifth note is a whole-step up from A, which is B.\n\nThe sixth note is a whole-step up from B, which is C#.\n\nThe seventh note is a whole-step up from C#, which is D#.\n\nGoing up a half-step gets us back to the root of the scale, which is E.\n\nAs I said before, now that you know this pattern, you can figure out the notes in any Major scale.

{"body": "Memorizing the circle of fifths and orders of accidentals is a great method if you know the notes on the fretboard well enough (which you should). Knowing \"W W H W W W H\" is okay too, but that's mostly helpful only if you're going straight up or down the scale. When you think in terms of relation to the root note, it's a lot easier to skip to different notes in the scale. Consider this, if you know where the root is on any string other than G , you can easily find the 4th because it's on the same fret on the next string up. That's two notes in the scale down, and only 5 more that you can figure out using similar methods.\n\nAlso, consider that the interval away from the root determines the function of the note. In any major key, the 7th, for example, always sounds and functions a certain way (traditionally, it leads up to the root). It's helpful for understanding modes, too, because, for example, you can think of Mixolydian as a major scale with a minor 7th from the root instead of a major 7th. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312705402", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, I'd probably take a look at a guitalele subreddit, but I think that the following might be more helpful for you...\n\nIsn't it true that a capo at the fifth fret of a guitar in standard tuning gives an instrument with the same tuning as the guitalele?  (from bass to tenor, that would be A D G C E A)  My thought is that you should start with guitar tutorials (NOT uke).  All your chord shapes will be the same, the chords will just be transposed up by a fourth.\n\nFor example: playing the shape of a guitar E major chord on the guitalele will give you a great sounding chord ... an A!  The I-IV-V chord family E - A - B can be made with the same shapes on the guitalele ...  and will suddenly be A - D - E ... so blues chord progression tutorials will work great.  If you want to play some pop music, try learning the 12 bar blues form and a couple of variations.  It will probably sound familiar; a fair amount of rock and jazz music was built on the blues foundation.\n\nEDIT:  ADGBEA should be ADGCEA.

{"body": "The Warrior-Prophet, from the Prince of Nothing Series by R. Scott Bakker. The scene where Achamian escapes from the Scarlet Spires. Bakker is like no other when describing magic and combat. \n\n\n&gt;Vengeance roamed the halls of the compound—like a God.\nAnd he sang his song with a beast’s blind fury, parting wall from foundation, blowing ceiling into sky, as though theworks of man were things of sand.\n\n\nAnd when he found them, cowering beneath their Analogies, he sheared through their Wards like a rapist through a cotton shift. He beat them with hammering lights, held their shrieking bodies as though they were curious things, the idiot thrashing of an insect between thumb and forefinger . . .\nDeath came swirling down.\n\n\nHe felt them scramble through the corridors, desperate to organize some kind of concerted defence. He knew that the sound of agony and blasted stone reminded them of their deeds. Their horror would be the horror of the guilty. Glittering death had come to redress their trespasses.\n\n\nSuspended over the carpeted floors, encompassed by hissing Wards, he blasted his own ruined halls. He encountered a cohort of Javreh. Their frantic bolts were winked into ash by the play of lights before him. Then they were screaming, clawing at eyes that had become burning coals. He strode past them, leaving only smeared meat and charred bone. He encountered a dip in the fabric of the onta, and he knew that more awaited his approach armed with the Tears of God. He brought the building down upon them.\n\n\nAnd he laughed more mad words, drunk with destruction. Fiery lights shivered across his defences and he turned, seething with dark crackling humour, and spoke to the two Scarlet Magi who assailed him, uttered intimate truths, fatal Abstractions, and the world about them was wracked to the pith.\nHe clawed away their flimsy Anagogic defences, raised them from the ruin like shrieking dolls, and dashed them against bone-breaking stone.\n\n\nSeswatha was free, and he walked the ways of the present bearing tokens of ancient doom.\nHe would show them the Gnosis.\n\n\n———«»——————«»——————«»———\n\n\nWhen the first shiver passed through the foundations, Iyokus thought, I should’ve known.\nHis next thought, unaccountably, was of Eleäzaras.\nI told him ill would come of this.\n\nFor the completion of their task, Eleäzaras had left him only six Schoolmen, three of them sorcerers-of-rank, and some two hundred and fifty Javreh. Worse yet, they were scattered throughout the compound. Once he might have thought this would be more than enough to manage a Mandate sorcerer, but after the fury of the Sareotic Library he was no longer sure . . . Even had they been prepared. We’re doomed.\nOver the long years of his life, the chanv had rendered his passions as colourless as his skin. What he felt now was more the\n\nmemory of a passion rather than the passion itself. The memory of fear.\nBut there was hope yet. The Javreh possessed at least a dozen Trinkets, and moreover, he, Heramari Iyokus, was here.\nLike his brethren, he envied the Mandate the Gnosis, but unlike them he did not hate. If anything, Iyokus respected the Mandate.\nHe understood the pride of secret knowledge.\n\nSorcery was nothing if not a great labyrinth, and for a thousand years the Scarlet Spires had charted it, delving, always delving, mining knowledge both dread and disastrous. And even though they’d yet to discover the glorious precincts of the Gnosis, there were certain branches, certain forks, which theya l o n e had mapped. Iyokus was a scholar of these forbidden forks, a student of the Daimos.\nA Daimotic sorcerer.\nIn their darkest conferences, they sometimes wondered: How would the War-Cants of the Ancient North fare against the\nDaimos?\nThe sound of screams percolated through the halls. The wall thrummed with the reverberations of nearing blasts. Iyokus, who\nwas wary and calculating even in circumstances as dreadful as these, understood the time had come to answer that question.\n\n\nHe threw aside the brilliant carpets and painted the circles across the tiles with deft, practiced strokes. Light spilled from his colourless lips as he muttered the Daimotic Cants. And, as the tempest approached, he at last completed his interminable song. He dared speak the Ciphrang’sn a m e.\n“Ankaryotis! Heed me!”\nFrom the safety of his circle of symbols, Iyokus gazed in wonder at the sheeted lights of the Outside. He looked upon a writhing\nabomination—scales like knives, limbs like iron pillars . . .\n“Does it hurt?” he asked against the thunder of its wail.\n“What hast thou done, mortal?”\nAnkaryotis, a fury of the deep, a Ciphrang summoned from the Abyss.\n“I have bound you!”\nThou art damned! Dost thou not recognize he who shall keepeth thee for Eternity?\nA demon . . .\n“Either way,” Iyokus cried, “such is my fate!”\n\n\n———«»——————«»——————«»———\n\n\nThe Javreh leapt like flaming dancers, screaming, stumbling, thrashing across the lavish Kianene carpets.\n\n\nBattered, naked, Achamian walked between them.\n“IYOKUS!” he thundered.\nSheets of falling stucco flashed into smoke against his Wards.\n“IYOKUS!”\nDust shivered in the air.\nWith words, he tore the walls before him away. He walked over empty space, across a collapsed floor. Masonry\ncrashed from the ceilings. He peered through the billowing clouds of powdered brick . . .\nAnd was engulfed in brilliant dragon fire.\n\n\nHe turned to the chanv addict, laughed. Encircled by ghostly walls, the Master of Spies crouched on a floating fragment of floor, his pale face working to his staccato song . . . Vultures brighter than sunlight swept into Achamian’s defences. Shimmering lava exploded from beneath, washed across his Wards. Lightning danced from the room’s four dark corners . . .\n“YOU ARE OVERMATCHED, IYOKUS!”\n\n\nHe struck with a Cirroi Loom, grasping the addict’s Wards with geometries of light.\nThen he was falling, borne down by a raving demon, perched upon his Wards, hammering with great nailed fists.\nWith each blow he coughed blood.\n\n\nHe crashed into heaped debris, struck with an Odaini Concussion Cant, throwing the Ciphrang backward through shadowy ruin. He glanced up, searching for Iyokus. He glimpsed him scrambling through a breach in the far wall. He sung a Weara Comb, and a thousand lines of light flashed outward. The wall collapsed, riddled with innumerable holes, as did the ceiling beyond. Incandescent threads fanned across Iothiah and into the night sky.\nHe pushed himself to his feet.\n“IYOKUS!”\nHowling, the demon once again leapt upon him, blazing with hellish light.\n\n\nAchamian charred its crocodile hide, ribboned its otherworldly flesh, smote its elephantine skull with ponderous cudgels of stone, and it bled fire from a hundred wounds. But still it refused to fall. It howled obscenities that cracked rock and rifled the ground with chasms. More floors collapsed, and they grappled through dark cellars made bright by flickering fury.\nSorcerer and demon.\nUnholy Ciphrang, a tormented soul thrust into the agony of the World, harnessed by words like a lion by strings, yoked to the task that would see it freed.\n\n\nAchamian endured its unearthly violence, heaped injury after injury upon its agony.\nAnd in the end it grovelled beneath his song, cringed like a beaten animal, then faded into the blackness . . \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312750992", "subreddit": "books", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

On farms that have a large proportion of special crops, such as potatoes, sugar beet and seed grass, the production losses in terms of quantity would be closer to 50%.

{"body": "I saw this thread and my eyes lit up. Incoming essay...\n\n\nEssay:\n\nKatarina is for me the most fun champion in the game. She may not be my most played champion, but she does have my highest win %age in ranked (64%). Some consider her overpowered; some consider her ridiculously weak; I consider her *perfect*.\n\nThe fun comes from the fact that she has hilarious mobility (I know I'm rambling, I'll move on to strategy etc. in a minute) as well as ridiculous damage output. It's not impossible for a well-placed ultimate to kick out over 9000 damage across a team (no, really). This is why people call her overpowered. The reason Riot haven't nerfed her into the ground for this is because of one factor: she is incredibly situational. You can only destroy people if you have enough farm, the right enemies and the right timing, which is not an easy proposition. This is why rolling with Kat is so rewarding. The nice thing is that if you've got a good measure of her power and a handle on what the other team can throw around you can still have fun and be useful when they are concentrating on countering you. (Enough waxing lyrical, on to the guide-  Note I will not give concrete instructions, merely advice and recommendations. This is how I roll.)\n\n* **Items**\n\nCore items are Boots (either Sorc's or Merc's). All other items are optional and situational.\n\n* For damage, choose from Gunblade, Hat, Bloodthirster\n\n* For survivability, choose from Rylai's, Abyssal, BV, Warmong's\n\n* For utility, choose from Gunblade, Rylai's, Triforks, Lichbane\n\nGunblade is a beautiful item. By the numbers, it gives the highest damage output of any item for her ultimate. In addition, the spell vamp is delicious (building a Revolver early gives you great staying power in lane) and the active is amazing (long range, long duration, high-powered slow with reasonable damage). Gunblade is the closest to core of any of the suggested items: rare is the game in which I don't build it first.\n\nHat is second only to Gunblade in terms of ultimate damage, plus it complements any AP items you get. Standard if you're not sure what to get later in the game.\n\nBloodthirster is a controversial choice. It gives similar amounts of damage to Hat and Gunblade, but that fact that it is all from AD means that your dagger and autoattacks hit super-hard. Downside comes from the fact that if you die (which you will) then you have to refill it every time. Snowballing with SotO and Bloodthirsters gives hilarious results, but it is inadvisable due to unreliability.\nRylai's is also a common choice. If I need hp, I'll often get the Belt after the Revolver to build into Rylai's later on. The slow is semi-useful, adds a lot of utility to your teamfight ability as your ultimate applies full slow on each target.\n\nAbyssal is cool if your opponents start building MR or you're taking too much magic damage. Reduction rather than Penetration is cool, since your allies also benefit from the aura.\n\nBV is ok. HP and spell shield are lurvely, especially if you're being targetted with interrupts but the mana is useless to you and it doesn't contribute to your damage output.\n\nWarmong's is one I personally avoid. The HP, along with building resistances makes you gloriously tanky but that is kinda useless if it's not worth focussing you.\n\nTriforks and Lichbane are similar items, bought primarily for their on-hit effects. Lichbane works better with AP-heavy builds, whilst Triforks gives more utility with its slow and +HP. I experimented with these a little but found them not to my liking. Kat doesn't hit fast and I figure if you're in melee range to hit, why not hit them with your ultimate? Could work if they're interrupt-heavy and saving them for when you ultimate; some kind of mind-game.\n\nI should mention snowball items. They are cheap, they are scary, they are *not worth buying*. Mejai's and SotO when **fully charged** give *less damage* on your ultimate than a Gunblade. I'm willing to shell out 2K for the extra reliability and active of a Gunblade than hope that I'm good enough to stay alive.\n\n* **Skills** (Note I suck with names, so I'll stick to hotkeys and descriptions)\n\nSomething like Q E W Q E R SomeStuffHere - Skill order is open for you to customise as you please. Use the guidelines Q for farm/harass E for chase/escape W for utility (it also gives small damage bonus to everything).\n\n* (Innate) I think you are underestimating this ability. Bonus assist/kill gold is small, but its main power comes from the way it affects cooldowns. With enough CDR, 2 kills/assists will almost reset your ultimate's cooldown. You can jump into a teamfight and as long as you get a kill or assist yuo can imediately jump out again. If you're not first in, this is almost guaranteed. Alternatively, you can tower-dive a low-health hero, finish him off and jump out again in the space of two seconds. Sexy-as-fuck.\n\n* Q (Dagger) Lasthitting and harassing early, finishing off fleeing opponents, reducing healing, general farming, general nuking. This is a very flexible spell with a lot of uses. Cast it as often as possible. Remember that with spell vamp this gives nice heals.\n\n* W (Passive) This spell adds utility to other spells. It is unique. Not much to say beyond if it's on cooldown, might as well use it. I prefer to use it with Shunpo to get the reduced damage effect, but it's also handy for making sure your dagger hits harder and really annoys that mundo/vlad/&lt;insert healer&gt;\n\n* E (Shunpo) A lurvely blinkstrike. Unlike Akali's ultimate it can target allies and wards as well as enemies (correct if wrong), which makes it great for attacking as well as running or chasing. With a good amount of AP it hits like a truck. Use to jump into teamfights, jump out of teamfights, burst-harass early, farm mid-late, so on and so forth.\n\n* R (Holy Death Lotus of Antioch) Thus thy foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it. This is the critical point upon which Katarina either makes or breaks the teamfight. If you go in too early you get focussed down, interrupted, killed in a burst of ouch. If you go in too late, your team is already dead and you get focussed down, interrupted, killed in a burst of ouch. If you go in during the prime window, you spin your spin and you turn the teamfight in your favour. This is the point at which strategy is key.\n\n* **Strategy**\n\n* Ultimate\n\nThe key things to remember are that you need to get as much of your ultimate off, and get as much of the damage in where it will hurt. Shunpo allows you to position yourself with minimum of fuss and ideally jump over/around the tanks to spin like a cat amongst the pigeons and romp through their squishies. See that Ashe? Standing a little too close? Just used her arrow? Shunpo -&gt; Ulti -&gt; Dagger -&gt; What Ashe? Throw in a Rylais and/or Gunblade and she is not getting away. Unfortunately, the Janna standing next to her was paying attention and inserted *her* Ulti in between the L and the T of yours. **This is O K**. Janna and Ashe have stopped pouring their scorn into the teamfight and are concentrating on you. Since you used Killer Instincts with Shunpo, you're taking 40% less damage, and since you have a couple of large items your spells still hit like a truck. Ashe is still down to half HP and is on the run, leaving a couple of tanks or so to be mopped up by your team. If you can exercise the \"get the fuck off my team mates\" mindset correctly, you can screw up the enemy with just your presence. It is not unheard of for a Katarina to keep an Annie/Ali/Blitz from using their combo on your team just by being around and *threatening* to ultimate. It's like the cold war all over again. Katarina is not just about silly damage, she's also about mind-games and bluffing. The key thing is to not be bluffing with an empty hand.\n\n* Early game laning\n\nThe best place to have Katarina kicking about early is in mid. The mindset here is something of a double-think, where you *know* you are a bad-ass mother who can eat the shit out of anyone you're against. At the same time you know that they are a scary scary guy who will harass the pants off you when you try to farm and hit them. My favourite technique is the burst-harass. From level 3 you will have three spells, plus ignite. Killer Instincts then Shunpo, hit them until they're out of range then toss your dagger after them. You are scary, you deal quite a hefty amount of damage and you take hardly any. It's a simple matter to have them on half health before they can run away, and you've lost maybe a third because of your damage reduction. Delicious. Beyond this, you need to farm as much as possible. Feel free to use spells to lasthit (as you have no mana), and try and get your dager in where it can lasthit and bounce to the champion for some extra harassment. You want to keep them on the back foot so you can own the lane and do as you please. Burst them when you can, but don't take too much damage. Remember they are a bad-ass mother who will eat you if you let them.\n\nInto the midgame, just keeping farming and pushing. You can't gank well without Rylais or Gunblade (or both) so don't bother trying. Let the jungler come to you, or go assist with river fights. Once you've hit level 6 you can comfortably throw a certain amount of weight around although remember that your ultimate's base damage is actually fairly low and most damage comes later from items.\n\n* **Other stuff**\n\nI run Flash and Ignite with 9/0/21 masteries. For runes i use AP Quints, CDR Blues, Penetration Reds and HP/level Yellows.\n\nComparing with Akali; Cooldowns are larger but hit harder and are reduced by her innate, Akali has better chasing and the invis is great to play with. In my experience Kat is generally tougher than Akali but that could be dependent on how I build her. Akali has a much more passive early game until she gets her Ultimate.\n\nIf I missed anything I'll edit it in.\n\nTL;DR goto Essay", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312809783", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No questions are dumb questions especially if your just getting into the game. The best way to be a force in the late game with an AD carry is to CS as much as possible. Now of course when you can get kills go for them, but try to focus on last hitting. At your level in the game, the best way to carry a game with Ashe would be take a solo lane because there is a very low chance someone will play support and babysit you properly.\n\nA very basic Ashe guide is\nboots + 3 pots for solo lane\ndorans blade for dual lane\n\nthen first trip back get a BF sword if you have the money, if not get boots and 2 dorans blades.\n\nFrom there get infinity edge, phantom dancer, last whisper\nIf your having a really hard time sustaining your health in teamfights you can get a bloodthirster instead, but once you learn how to position the infinity edge is really preferable.\n\nFrom there id probably build banshees veil, but this item is situational.\n\nFor summoners you should go flash ghost or flash exhaust.\nAshe has great kiting power, but no true escape mechanism aside from her ult. If you see that the enemy team has an assassin like akali or xin, then id take exhaust. When they jump to you just exhaust them and kite them. If not ghost is another viable option, it allows alot of defensive and offensive utility.\n\nFor skills id go W Q W E then max R W Q E in that order. Volley is a far more versatile skill then it appears to be. Not only is it decent AOE damage for a team fight, it is great for popping enemy's banshees veils, and allows you to AOE slow, which lets your team chase or escape well. Ashe is an extremely good kiter due to her volley and frost shot.\n\nBasic harass in lane with ashe is volley kiting when the enemy steps up, if they start to back off then you can auto attack them with frost shot on. If they start coming towards you again just keep kiting them with volley and frost shot. Careful when doing this at low levels though because minion damage is a much more significant factor. \n\nAshes true strength lies in her ult, which is one of the best skills in the game. It allows you to initiate fights whenever you want, which really lets you control the pace of the game. If you see an enemy out of position you can ult them and have your team engage on them. It also is really deadly in securing jungle ganks and kills in lane.\n\nSince your a brand new player, you probably will not see many wards on the map. Wards are a huge aspect of the game, well placed wards will allow you to farm completely uninterrupted, which is especially important for an AD carry.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312932760", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

If that is the case my 2x30 gallon tubs are:\n\n    - 30.5 inches long\n    - 18.25 inches wide\n    - 18.25 inches deep(height of one)\n\nSo my calculations:\n\n    - 30.5\" = 2.54'' Long\n    - 18.25\" = 1.52' Wide\n    - 18.25\" x 2 tubs = 3.04' Tall\n    - L x W x H = 2.54' x 1.52' x 3.04' = 11.74' \n\n\nSo that is 11.74 cubic feet of my box. Using your calculation for light:\n\n    - 50watts per 1 cubic foot\n    - 11.74 x 50 = 587watts needed\n\nI am really hoping that this is not the case. Since I am maybe at around 250watts. I am also guessing (hoping still) that the 2 pots remove from this volume. I also feel that since my lights are 4 hanging 2-4 inches from the plants and the 8 in the fixture about 7 inches away this would cut down on the cubic foot coverage. \n\nDo you think I should some how add more than 12 lights? Maybe upgrade some of the lower wattage bulbs with higher wattage? What would you suggest. Maybe invest in higher wattage 2700k's since I will be using them more?\n\n2) Exhaust, cooling. Since I am cranking freaking 12 lights along with being on the third floor in the middle of the summer it is about 83 just in my place. I started combating this by placing the box by my air conditioner and keeping it running. But how much more exhaust would u suggest? I thought that the 6\" personal fan for outtake and the 8\" clip on fan would be enough at least better at extraction/movement than a computer fan. Are computer fans really more efficient? Should I add one or two to extract the air? Should I add one to extract the air and one to force more air in?\n\n3) Watering. When I first setup the dirt, before I put in the germinated seed I soaked the soil. About a half gallon of water in each pot. But as I said the box got decently warm over the past few days and this seemed to dry the dirt out at the top. About a knuckle and a half deep from the top the dirt seemed dry. But the holes at the bottom the dirt felt damp still. So I lightly watered the plants with about 10oz of distilled water twice so far (put in dirt last Thursday August 4th and today is August 12th) . Is distilled water the best to give them? \n\n4) Final question i swear. I have the first sets of leaves on both. However it looks like the ends of the leaves are curling up. Not a lot. But slightly at an upward angle. The 2 first leaves on the larger seedling are also starting to point upwards. Also, the stems appear purple and the leaves have a dark green/purplish spots on them. Is this normal? I read somewhere this happens to fast bud. I was just checking.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1313178908", "subreddit": "microgrowery", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It works well since you basically always have the Sheen proc up, and combined with your passive it can be a lot of damage. It does make you feel more useful when you don't have another champion around, but if you do poorly your team will bitch and moan.\n\nMy standard build now is:\n\nMasteries: 9/0/21. Mpen in offense tree, Exp Gain, mana Regen, gold/10, movespeed, improved Flash/CV in Utility (pretty self-explanatory)\n\nRunes: Mpen Reds, Mana Regen/lvl yellows, CDR Blues, Health Quints\n\nStarting items: 2x Faerie Charm, 1 Ward, 1 HP pot. Make sure you pick Q at the fountain and use it 3 times to charge your passive.\n\nTry to lane bottom with a good carry, and dont steal lasthits from them (if they are lasthitting well). Q W W E W R. Try to save your mana for at least rank 2 heal at level 3, since rank 1 is very ineffective.\n\nFirst trip back: PHILOSOPHERS STONE. Also, wards, boots, wards, wards, heart of gold, Mana manipulator. \n\nAfter your trip back, try to keep vision on dragon/entrance to your lane to keep your carry safe. Keep them healed up, harass the enemy with your autoattack+passive. If your jungler is good and is going for dragon, go there and sing songs to him.\n\nMid game: Philo Stone, Heart of Gold, Soul Shroud, Boots, Wards, Wards. I've tried a lot of different boots and still cant decide which I like. Boots3, Merc treads, and Boots of Mobility are all viable.\n\nNow is when teamfights will be going down. Your first order of business is spamming W, whenever it is off cooldown. Your ult is pretty powerful, try to hit more than 1 person in it. The best situation is if 2-3 champs decide to towerdive someone on your team, you ult them under the tower and get a double/triple kill while kiting them around the tower and healing. You can also use it right after your initiator goes in if the enemy team is grouped up.\n\nFinal Build: Boots, Shurelya's, Soul Shroud, Randuins (last), wards, wards, wards, then if the game goes long or you carried like a boss, banshee's veil or something.\n\n\nSona is my winningest champion, but you will have some infuriating games with her.

{"body": "**Example 2: hijacking the program flow.**\n\nLet's first look at the structure of the stack for our auth function.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TAM7l.png\n\nFirst, we see that the stack variables for the function main is at a higher address than those for the auth function.\n\nSecond, we see a **return address** cell on the stack. This is a pointer type that points to the instruction to be executed after the auth function returns. The fact that this is on the stack is what we will be using to the program.\n\nThird, we see a **saved frame pointer** cell on the stack as well. This is the base pointer for the main function. A base pointer is the relative address from which all of the stack variables and the arguments are indexed for the current function. (It is in effect the last position of the stack before the function begins running) We can alter this too to replace the stack variables with those of our own choosing.\n\nSo continuing where we left out last time. Running\n\n&gt; ./a.out AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nprints out 65. Referring back to our stack chart, we see that we've broached the first byte of the reserved space for **int ret**. If we keep on going with the A's , we'll eventually overwrite part of the *SFP*, and then the *return address*. For example, debugging with 42 A's gives us the following stack dump at **return ret**\n\n    gdb$ continue\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------[regs]\n      EAX: FFFFFFD1  EBX: B7FC1FFC  ECX: 00000070  EDX: 70F00AF0  o d I t S z a P c\n      ESI: BFB40E94  EDI: BFB40E20  EBP: BFB40DD8  ESP: BFB40DB0  EIP: 08048452\n      CS: 0073  DS: 007B  ES: 007B  FS: 0000  GS: 0033  SS: 007B\n    [007B:BFB40DB0]----------------------------------------------------------[stack]\n    BFB40E00 : 00 00 00 00  E0 7C FF B7 - 68 0E B4 BF  14 BE EA B7 .....|..h.......\n    BFB40DF0 : FC 1F FC B7  FC 1F FC B7 - C8 95 04 08  FC 1F FC B7 ................\n    BFB40DE0 : CF 24 B4 BF  00 00 00 00 - 08 0E B4 BF  CB 84 04 08 .$..............\n    BFB40DD0 : 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 - 41 41 00 BF  8C 84 04 08 AAAAAAAAAA......\n    BFB40DC0 : 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 - 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n    BFB40DB0 : 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 - 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n    [007B:BFB40DB0]-----------------------------------------------------------[data]\n    BFB40DB0 : 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 - 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n    BFB40DC0 : 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 - 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n    BFB40DD0 : 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 - 41 41 00 BF  8C 84 04 08 AAAAAAAAAA......\n    BFB40DE0 : CF 24 B4 BF  00 00 00 00 - 08 0E B4 BF  CB 84 04 08 .$..............\n    BFB40DF0 : FC 1F FC B7  FC 1F FC B7 - C8 95 04 08  FC 1F FC B7 ................\n    BFB40E00 : 00 00 00 00  E0 7C FF B7 - 68 0E B4 BF  14 BE EA B7 .....|..h.......\n    BFB40E10 : 02 00 00 00  94 0E B4 BF - A0 0E B4 BF  6C CB FE B7 ............l...\n    BFB40E20 : FC 1F FC B7  00 00 00 00 - 20 0E B4 BF  68 0E B4 BF ........ ...h...\n    [0073:08048452]-----------------------------------------------------------[code]\n\nHere, our EBP resides at BFB40DD8, which contains *41 41 00 BF* (remember that C strings are 0 terminated, which explains the 00 instead of the expected b4). Which means that for 2 more bytes, we will be able to overwrite the **return address** cell, and then be able to hijack the program flow after the function returns.\n\nIf we then call ./a.out with 45 A's as the parameter, we'll see \n\n    Cannot access memory at address 0x8040041\n    0x08040041 in ?? ()\n\nwhere '0x41' '0x00' is the string \"A\". Well, look at that, our program attempted to jump to 0x08040041 but raised a segfault because that memory address is out of bounds for the current process.\n\nThe problem now however is to figure out a way to reroute the execution to a meaningful set of instructions. This is difficult, but here are two common techniques.\n\n1. If the buffer we're trying overflow is large, we can embed the instructions within that buffer itself. The challenge here is to find the correct starting position of the instruction. This is usually all but next to impossible. But we can improve our chances of successfully executing our shellcode by extending the range of address for the program to jump to. We can prepend the shell code with a dozen or so NOP instructions so that if the jump lands on any one of these NOP instructions, we will be able to successfully execute our payload. \n  We will still have to find an approximate address for the NOP sled, namely, the address of the parameters to main. This is a guess and check game, but usually, the exploit author will wrap the entire exploit within another C program, which guesses at that address via an offset of the address of one of its own stack variables. This is a great technique if the program we're delivering the payload to has no side effects.\n  \n2. If we're on Linux, we can store our shellcode in an environment variable. This has the advantage that while the code is still on the stack, we can also deterministically find its starting instruction using getenv.\n\nEverything else rests upon the art of crafting the shellcode itself, which is another expansive field itself.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1313387797", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

I've heard people say, \"Oh I just can't lose the weight.\"  When I hear that my brain understands this: \"Oh, I like to talk but I don't really do anything!\"  And my judgemental mind then dismisses their entire life as refuse that a corpse-devouring maggot should pass in favor of something else to eat.  (Not sure if that makes any sense, but it was fun to write!)\n\nShe does not like how she looks.  She is self consious and emotionally fragile.  She makes a good effort to appear confident when she needs to.  She runs her own business and her customer service skills are amazing.  She has a beatiful face, seriously the greatest skin I've ever seen on a woman.  She is complimented on her hair all the time.  But she knows she's carrying a spare tire.  She looks pretty decent when she's clothed.  But naked, her belly is as awkward as a walrus trying to make belgian waffles.  She does not like that.  There was a long time after I was caught with porn that I was not allowed to see her naked.  Now I get to (on the very rare occasion she comes to bed at the same time as me) and when I see her I compliment her.  My compiments sound good but they are lies. \n\nI think she could lose more weight if she got serious about it.  That would require taking the kids for a walk in the middle of the day and sweating.  Yes, its hot, yes it sucks, YES, YOUR KIDS WANT TO GO PLAY OUTSIDE, YES, IT'S YOUR JOB AS A MOTHER TO MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENS!  GO O U T S I D E ! ! ! !

{"body": "Ok cool! Here's some really easy easy theory.  You only really need to know chords I, IV, V and vi.  Those are the placements on a normal major scale.  Let's say you have a G Major Scale.  The notes are as follows: G A B C D E F# G (you can check that out on a piano or even on the guitar for a good listening reference).  For any given song, you can probably play it with G, C, D and em.  If you look, G = I, C = IV, D = V, em = vi (lowercase = minor, uppercase = major).  In case that wasn't too clear here's what i mean:\n\nG=I, A=ii, B=iii, C=IV, D=V, E=vi, F#=vii*, G = I. \n\n\nI'll give you an example.  Forgive me if you hate these songs but they're good examples.  Listen to Jason Mraz's I'm Yours.  In the chorus you'll find that the order of chords is I, V, vi, IV most of the time.  In Taylor Swift's Love Story, the order is I, v, vi, IV, I.  Soul Sister is the same.  Billy Joel's We didn't start the fire is the same.Start with those songs for now.  Afterwards you can think of other songs and get a better understanding of chords.\n\nAlso, remember that you're not limited to one key.  After you understand the whole I, IV, V, vi thing, you can apply it to any major scale.  Use a capo.\n\nHappy playing.\n\nedit-forgot about the capo", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314032405", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, let me try again.  Ever ask, \"why do the notes of a chord sound good together?\" \n\nWhen you play one note, there is also an infinite series of overtones above that note which sound, and the strengths or weaknesses of the various overtones result in what we call \"sound color\" or \"timbre.\"  It's the scientific reason *why* a clarinet sounds different from a saxophone.\n\nDividing up the string (or column of air for clarinet or sax) is how you discover these overtones.  The wave-forms of the overtones perfectly divide into the fundamental, or, more simply, you get 2 or more perfect sausages instead of one.  A pure fundamental with no overtones is just a sine wave, and sounds \"very round\" or like a bell.  Something with lots of strong higher overtones sounds \"nasal\" or like a saw.  Almost *all* sounds have overtones of some kind.\n\nEach time the bottom number of the fraction is prime, you get a new note in the series.  Starting on C the series is: C C G C E G Bb C D E F# G Ab Bb B C.... and higher, but the important thing is to notice the first 5, or the two first new notes.  C, the fundamental, and G, the fifth, and E, the third.  That's a major chord.  The first large divisions (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5) of any note play a major chord.  When you play one note, you actually play a major chord(and more!) inside that one note! So the reason the major chord sounds like \"a place\" around the fundamental note is because the other notes excite (or color)the overtones inside the fundamental.\n\nWhen you change a major chord to a minor one, you just change one note: the E to a E flat, in a C chord.  Now that E flat is pulling down at it's overtone; it's flat by about a half-step, which alters the resonance of the chord: feels darker.\n\nvihart (of doodling snake fame) recently made a [you-tube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_0DXxNeaQ0) which explains some of this overtone series stuff.\n\nEdited for clarity; I'm around for questions.\n\nEDIT: You can't hear to infinity.  The overtones drop in volume exponentially as you go up, so eventually you can't really hear new ones anymore.  Theoretically the series can go on forever, with a limit, as the overtones get closer and closer together at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314041398", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 25, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\nThanks! Nice computer you got there. Very compact. I thought about trying compact but I threw that out the window almost instantly. Didn't want to bother with it. I really like the variable clock speed for different operations.\n\nI do have a 16 bit CPU but the RAM for storing code is insanely slow (7 seconds from the farthest bit) meaning a 15 second clock minimum. Gave up went back to 8 bits :p\n\nThe instruction set is fairly similar to the HACK platform, where the MSB determines wether to write to the A register (MSB = 0) or to perform a data operation.\n\nI have the bits named out in an odd way I guess. They go: MSB, a b c d e, A0 A1 B0 B1, f g h i j k. \n\nIf the MSB = 1 it takes abcde and determines what operation to perform. A0 and B0 NOT the A and B registers, but do not change the registers. A1 and B1 zero the registers. f and g determine which register to write to (if there is a value coming from the ALU or the register for the keyboard). h is useless unless deciding a RAM location or a value to write to A. i j k decide what comparisons to perform if abcde are 00000. The i makes the PC jump to A if B == 0, j - B &gt; 0, k - B &lt; 0. You can have any combination of these and ijk = 111 is just Jump no matter what. or 000 for a no operation.\n\nThe commands are, IF ijk jump, all bitwise, add/subtract, B -&gt; RAM, RAM -&gt; B, K (keyboard register) -&gt; A/B, reset K, PRINT(B) (B to seven segment), SCREEN(B) sends b to an encoder for the characters then to the screen to be written to the next spot, DELETE(V) moves screen pointer back one then erases the screen portion there, and CLEAR(V) resets the screen.\n\nFor example, heres how to add two numbers from code:\n\n00|  0 00000 0000 00 0011 // load 3 into &amp;A\n\n01|  1 00110 0001 01 0000 // OR, zero B, write to &amp;B\n\n02|  0 00000 0000 00 0101 // load 5 into &amp;A\n\n03|  1 01001 0000 01 0000 // ADD, write to &amp;B\n\n04|  1 10010 0000 00 0000 // PRINT &amp;B\n\n05|  1 00000 0000 00 0111 // JUMP 5", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314118859", "subreddit": "Minecraft", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Like you're five?  I can get *close* but I'd lose a five year old further on.  Try this:\n\nYou know how there are some puzzles that are really hard and would take you a really long time until somebody tells you the secret trick to solving them, and then they're easy?  On one hand, your friend can just give you the answer to the puzzle, and you can see that the answer is right, but not know how he did it.  All you know is that your friend knows how to do it, and you would still need him to do it again.  On the other hand, he can give you the secret trick and then you can solve the puzzle yourself.\n\nThat's how certificates work.  Every certificate is a sort of puzzle.  It's a math puzzle using very, very big numbers.  These numbers are so big that the fastest computers in the world could guess numbers as fast as they can for a million years and never get the right ones.  The \"trick\" to these puzzles is a very big number that the person who owns the certificate doesn't tell anyone, ever.\n\nBecause you know that nobody but your friend knows that secret number, if somebody gives you an answer to the puzzle, and you can see that the answer is right, then you know that that solution had to have come from your friend, because that's the only person who has the trick to solve the puzzle.  No matter who brought you the solution, you would know your friend wrote it.\n\nLet's pretend for a moment using really simple puzzles instead.  Say I give you a dial with the letters A B C D E F G on it, and an arrow that spins and points to one of the letters.  I tell you to always start it off pointing to C.  This part isn't secret.  We don't care who knows it.\n\nSay we want to share a simple secret between us.  First I'd pick one of the seven letters at random, and you would do the same.  Each of us would start the dial off at C (as we agreed) and then start singing the alphabet song, turning the arrow once for each note we sang.  So say I pick B and sing \"A.. B..\" and then the arrow would point at E on my dial.  Then say you pick F and start singing \"A.. B.. C.. D.. E.. F..\" and when you were done your arrow would point at B.  We would then share what our arrows pointed at with each other and do the same thing with those letters.  My arrow is pointing at E and you told me yours said B, so I start singing, \"A.. B..\" and my dial points at G.  Yours points at B and I said E, so you sing, \"A.. B.. C.. D.. E..\" and almost like magic, your dial *also* points at G, based on randomly picked letters we never told each other.\n\nNow in this case it would be easy for another person to figure out what we were doing and come up with \"G\" himself, but if instead we were picking random numbers on a very, very big dial, and we were using a slightly more complicated rule to decide where the arrow ends up, then we would end up agreeing on a huge number that nobody else could guess, and neither of us could guess what random number the other had picked to start with.  Anybody could know how big the dial is and where we start from, and even where both our arrows ended up after applying the rules to our own random numbers, and it wouldn't help them figure out either our secret random numbers, or the shared secret number we could both agree on.\n\nIn fact, you can create a shared number with anybody by sharing the size of the dial, the starting position for the arrow, the rules for moving the arrow and where your arrow ends up when you follow the rules using your random secret number.  Anybody else could pick a secret number, follow the rules, and share with you where the arrow ended up, and then you could come up with a secret shared number unique to that person.\n\nThat's basically what a certificate contains:  The size of the dial, a starting position, something that indicates what set of rules to use in moving the arrow, and the number the arrow points at after applying the rules to the certificate owner's secret number.\n\nOnce you share a secret with somebody that nobody else can figure out, you can use it to scramble messages in a way that only somebody else who knows that secret number can unscramble.  Then the only way somebody could read your messages is to figure out the secret random number that either you or your friend came up with.  But because the numbers are huge and the math hard to do without the right secret number, that snooper would have to guess numbers forever to get the right one.  He probably doesn't care enough about the contents of your message to spend the rest of his life guessing, so he gives up.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314221836", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That's good man. So if you are interested in learning modes and scales, it will help a lot if you know where your notes are on the guitar. Knowing them up to the 7th fret is very good, but you should know them all the way up to the 12th fret. A good exercise is to challenge yourself to find a note (say C or F#) in every single string. Ex. C is in 68, 53, 410, 35, 21 and 18 (where the first number is the string and the second number is the fret). Try to find more notes on all strings.\n\n------\n\nSo here is an easy way of thinking about modes (although there is a better way to think of them once you start using them, but we'll see that later). They are a major scale that start an end on different notes. So if we take the notes of the C major scale (C D E F G A B C) but start an finish on D, we would have the D Dorian scale  (D E F G A B C D). This is a scale that has no sharps or flats, just like C major, but where the most important note (Tonic) is D. Notice that D Dorian is different from D major (D E F# G A B C#D) and D minor (D E F G A Bb C D). But also notice that D minor is very similar to D Dorian; for that reason we say that D Dorian (or any other Dorian Scale) is a minor scale. By that we mean that the sound, the quality is \"minorish\", but we don't mean that it is THE minor scale. As you saw, it is not. D minor has a Bb, whereas D Dorian has a B natural. \n\nUsing this logic you will be able to find all the other modes. Take the notes of the C major scale and start and finish on different notes. You will find the following modes:\n\nPhrygian (E F G A B C D E) - Minor (because it is very similar to E minor)\nLydian (F G A B C D E F) - Major (Because it is very similar to F major)\nMixolydian (G A B C D E F G) - Major\nAeolian (A B C D E F G A ) - Minor \nLocrian (B C D E F G A B) - Diminished\n\nNotice that the Aeolian mode (6th note of a major scale) is truly a minor scale. A minor is A B C D E F G A. So every time you play a minor scale, you are actually playing the Aeolian mode. This mode is also called the \"relative minor\"; that is, the minor scale that has the same quantity of sharps or flats as another major scale. In this case C major and A minor share the same quantity of sharps or flats (that is, None).\n\nTry to play all of this modes in one position. Once you are comfortable with them try to compare them to their major and minor counter parts. In other words, see if you can play D dorian, D major and D minor; E Phrygian, E major and E minor. That way you will see how those scales are related.\n\nLet me know how it goes.

{"body": "Ok, so at least you're going mid, which in my opinion is the only option for DR.  Your starting items sound good for most situations.  Last hitting with DR as I'm sure you know can be done with relative ease as he has a good attack animation and projectile travel time.\n\nAs far as skill build, if I'm against a ranged opponent, I'll typically be maxing my passive (3rd skill) for extra harassment damage/last hitting potential.  Of course you put your first point into Q (electric bomb thing) as your 3rd skill is useless without some sort of cast.  Against range my build looks like this: Q E E W E R E Q Q etc.  Very rarely if I am against an aggressive range with a blink (valk, hag), I will put my 4th point into Q for extra damage if they decide to blink on me.  Against melee, I will typically max Q first to punish them when they come in for a CK or deny.\n\nAfter your bottle, I typically rush my steamboots (and always steamboots on DR) and complete a power supply with the initial two minor totems I/we purchased.  My first major item is a sheepstick or nullstone 99% of the time, as DR needs a large mana pool and high mana regen to be effective.  While you may get bitched at by your teammates for not ganking all the time, I only gank with a haste or DD rune on DR, and only if the opportunity presents itself.  DR isn't a hero that can afford to sit in the jungle waiting for the enemies to push too far up or waste a stun on creeps to present a viable ganking opportunity.  He needs continuous farm to transition well into the mid and late game.\n\nYour ganking strategy sounds right.  Make sure you're ulting as short a distance as possible, to not waste more mana than needed to activate your passive's charge. Also try to block the hero and make him have to run around you to ensure you get off as many attacks as possible.  Your Q skill is VERY mana efficient, so if you find you're OOM quickly in mid/late game teamfights, use your Q for the 3rd skill charge instead of ulting, and save your ult for emergency kills.  I can usually have a nullstone and sheepstick by no later than 35 minutes, and at that point you should find your mana issues to be under control.\n\nHope you found this helpful, let me know if you think I've missed anything.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314390375", "subreddit": "HeroesofNewerth", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Can you post a link to where he explains this? I'm not too up on his pitch-axis stuff, but I can try to explain perhaps *why* dorian and mixolydian *might* go together.\n\nA simple answer is that they are somewhat complementary in that the only note that is different between the two is the third. I.e.:\n\n    Mode:   Scale Pattern   Parent Major Scale\n    -----------------------------------------------\n    G Mix: G A B  C D E F   C Ionian (i.e. C Major)\n    G Dor: G A Bb C D E F   F Ionian (F Major)\n\nI don't know why these two in particular, but if you consider the parent scales -- that is the particular Ionian modes that these two are derived from --  well, lets just take a little look at it:\n\nG Mixolydian comes from C Ionian -- They share the same notes. G Dorian comes from F Ionian -- They share the same notes. These two parent scales are a 4th/5th apart (depending on how you look at it). In other words, it is a pretty simple modulation either way. There's actually a lot going on \"under the hood\" so to speak, but suffice to say, it just sounds good. Also, \"blending\" these two scales together in a phrase *often* sounds pretty damn hip!\n\nNow, as to why Mix and Dor, rather than say, Ionian and Lydian, I don't know. \n\nWe could do the same thing with Ionian and Lydian, and this time the only different note is the fourth:\n\n    Mode:  Scale Pattern     Parent Major Scale\n    -------------------------------------------\n    G Ion: G A B C  D E F#   Well, G Ionian\n    G Lyd: G A B C# D E F#   D  Ionian (Major)\n\nAnd again, G and D Major are a 4th/5th apart, depending on how you look at it.\n\nNot sure if this helps per the actual question you asked, but it's still pretty interesting IMO.

It seems to me that everyone is letting their superlatives run away with them this evening, but nonetheless, I want you to know that I'm mighty, mighty happy to accept this trophy this evening.\nEvery football player in these United States dreams about winning that trophy, and of this fine trip to New York. Every player considers that trophy the acme in recognition of this kind. And the fact that I am actually receiving this trophy tonight almost overwhelms me, and I know that all those boys who have gone before me must have felt somewhat the same way.\nFrom my own personal viewpoint, I consider my winning this award as indirectly a great tribute to the new coaching staff at the University of Iowa, headed by Dr. Eddie Anderson, and to my teammates sitting back in Iowa City. A finer man and a better coach never hit these United States, and a finer bunch of boys and a more courageous bunch of boys never graced the gridirons of the Midwest than that Iowa team in 1939. I wish that they might all be with me tonight to receive this trophy. They certainly deserve it.\nI want to take this grand opportunity to thank collectively all the sportswriters, and all the sportscasters, and all those who have seen fit, have seen their way clear to cast a ballot in my favor for this trophy. And I also want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Prince and his committee, the Heisman award committee, and all those connected with the Downtown Athletic Club for this trophy, and for the fine time that they're showing me. And not only for that, but for making this fine and worthy trophy available to the football players of this country.\n_Finally, if you will permit me, I'd like to make a comment which in my mind, is indicative, perhaps, of the greater significance of football and sports emphasis in general in this country, and that is, I thank God I was warring on the gridirons of the Midwest and not on the battlefields of Europe. I can speak confidently and positively that the players of this country would much more, much rather, struggle and fight to win the Heisman award than the Croix de Guerre.\nThank you._\"\n\nThe team is shown walking from the locker room to the stadium entrance to 'Back and Black'.

{"body": "**Advanced Cricket 102**\n\n*Prerequisites - [Basic Cricket 101](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jzbyp/eli5_the_rules_of_cricket/c2gb70r)*\n\n&gt;Overs - bowlers switch after 6 bowls (equivalent to pitches, right?) and then another bowler comes in. can two bowlers just rotate every 6 pitches or is there a larger rotation or if a bowler goes through his 6 is he done for the match?\n\nA bowler can bowl many overs during a match. As long as they do not bowl consecutive overs, there is no limit during a Test match. The shorter formats have limits to encourage balanced teams, as Test bowlers could easily bowl half (or even more) of the 50 overs in a one day match on their own.\n\nPacemen (the bowlers who bowl fast) usually have a long run up and an aggressive action to increase their speed. This usually tires them out quite significantly during the course of a day, let alone the end of the 5th day.\nSpinners (those who use flight and turn to deceive and challenge batsmen) usually have a short run up and a technical action to increase variation of their delivery. This gives them the ability to bowl a LOT of overs during a match.\n\nTest match - no limit per bowler\n\nOne day - 10 overs per bowler\n\n&gt;also, i'm confused about who actual bowls. there are two people running between the two \"bases\" but does the same person keep batting or does it just matter who ends up at the side with the wickets?\n\nThe batsmen will run between the two wickets. When the over is complete, the bowlers will actually change ends. That's right, instead of making the two batsmen switch at the stoppage of play, the fieldsmen and bowlers will actually change the position of their fielding whilst the batsmen stay where they are. If you've seen a cricket pitch, that's a lot of walking every over if you're in the outfield.\n\n&gt;when looking at scores, i see several types of results: teams can win by runs (this one makes sense) or by wickets or by \"an innings\" and __ runs - what do each of these mean? i'm just looking at results [1] here\n\nIf you **win by runs**, it means that you have batted first (for example, set 500 runs to win) and the opposing team has not been able to chase it down (they scored 350). In this case, you have won by 150 runs.\n\nIf you **win by wickets**, it means that you have bowled first and gotten a team out for a total (for example, all out for 400) and during your turn at-bat, you have successfully chased down the total, whilst only losing 3 of your batsmen (7 wickets remaining). In this case, you have won by 7 wickets (since the match stops after a successful chase).\n\nIf you **win by an innings and runs**, this is an immense victory. This will only occur during Test matches (as they are the only matches with more than one innings). See as follows:\n\nTeam A decides to bat first (via coin toss) and scores 500 runs.\n\nTeam B comes in and only manages to score 150. Team A can enforce what is known as the \"follow on\". This means that if Team B did not come to within 250 runs of Team A's score, Team A can choose to force Team B to bat again, instead of following the standard ABAB procedure. This means the batting order is now ABBA.\n\nAfter enforcing the follow on, Team B only manages to score another 100 runs, for a total of 250!\n\nTeam A has won by an innings and 250 runs.\n\n&gt;can you explain what some of the stats on the [2] scorecard mean? R M B 4s 6s SR for batters and O M R W Econ for bowlers\n\n**For Batsmen**\n\nR - Runs\n\nM - Minutes (in the middle, not facing deliveries directly)\n\nB - Balls faced\n\n4s/6s - Boundaries (4 run/6 run hits made)\n\nSR - Strike rate (ratio of runs scored per balls faced. 80.00 means 80 runs scored in 100 balls faced)\n\n**For Bowlers**\n\nO - Overs bowled (sometimes seen in decimal such as 5.3. This means they have bowled 5 overs and are 3 balls into their 6th)\n\nM - Maiden overs (an over where 0 runs have been conceded)\n\nR - Runs against\n\nW - Wickets\n\nEcon - Economy rate (runs conceded per over)\n\nYou may also see some stats in a career profile for a bowler. An important one is the Strike Rate (same name as batsmen but different context). This displays the number of deliveries per wicket on average. Something under 60 is very impressive at the Test level.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314746079", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As for why I'm not attending senior year:\nI had an alarm clock that would often malfunction, and a cheap cell phone whose alarm would also sometimes malfunction. I was fairly poor and couldn't buy any better alarms, so I was stuck with those. During the first two weeks of my second semester, this caused me to miss a couple of classes. Most of my teachers handed out tiny ~10point \"Introduce Yourself\" or similar assignments, and bellringer grades. I missed some morning classes and therefore got 0's on those assignments. So my grades were D D D A A A A, but the D's were all 0/20s and such and could be very easily brought up. Word was though, LSMSA was applying for some kind of government grant in February whose factors included average GPA of the student body. Now, I had failed two classes the previous semester, Russian and American History. It was evident that Russian was a lost cause pretty early on (big mistake taking it), and failing American History was mostly due to old habits of laziness dying hard. I ended up signing a contract with the school stating that, if my grades weren't all passing at the end of the first nine weeks, I'd be kicked out, but otherwise I would be allowed to stay.\nWell, early one morning of an extended break nearing February (about 4 or so weeks into school), I get woken up and called in to Mr. Pat's office to be told that they would probably be sending me home due to my grades, and I'd find out for sure over extended. I really didn't have any time to prepare a counter-argument to show them how easily they could be brought up, and still being half-asleep after being woken up, and not being able to shower, probably didn't help my image either. Even after doing some quick math to show Mr. Pat how fast I could bring up all of the D's back to A's, as well as bringing up our signed contract, I still found out (the day we were supposed to come back) that I was kicked out. I don't think it was him, but rather the board. That being said, they broke a contract with me and it still peeves me.\n\nCurfew was still Sun-Th 10 and F-Sat 12. I probably couldn't point out the slight differences unless I knew exactly how it was in 2002. I don't think you guys had mandatory study hour for those on academic probation though, where one hour a day would be spent checking in and studying. This sometimes meant curfew was eight if you hadn't had a chance to study before then.\n\nI've heard a lot of people mention Dr. McCoy, from what I hear he was a great staff member. And I agree when you say that the remaining computer science staff hasn't been the best.\n\nYou're right about that persistent notion, I've talked with both returners and alumns who unanimously agree with it. I think that the \"worse than it was before\" mindset among the students was for the opposite reasons that the parents thought, i.e. it was harder to get away with doing things that the school may not agree with. That being said, the positive aspects of the school definitely outweighed the negative, otherwise I wouldn't have hung around as long as I did. For me, personally, my decision to attend LSMSA was partly for the academic opportunities and partly for escaping an abusive and oppressive situation at home. Later, another reason to continue attending was my love for the student body. I don't for a minute regret all of the effort and time I put into LSMSA, it was a very positive experience in my life, and many of my best memories were from there. LSMSA really helped me grow up.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314751464", "subreddit": "LSMSA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You could skill W more if the harassment is too heavy, but having at least 1 level in Q got me several kills (even double kills).\n\nFor items I mostly build Doran's Ring, Ionian Boots of Lucidity (CDR), Spirit Visage and Rylais. Most games end before I can finish any other item, but if they last long enough I go for Zhonya's Ring or Rabadon's Deathcap or some defensive item if they focus me like crazy.\n\nEarly game I play mostly passive, supporting my bot lane. But if they screw up last hitting, I will start last hitting. I also try to harass with Q and auto-attacks, but be careful because getting away as Soraka is not easy. If they catch you, you're dead most of the time.\n\nEnd game my cooldowns are something like 1s on Starcall, 12s on Heal, 6s on Infuse and ~60s on Wish. So what I do is throwing heals everytime somebody has not 100% HP and restore mana all the time. Since the patch it makes no sense to give it only to yourself, so I always cast it on somebody else (except I'm oom and need the mana, then I just mash ALT+E and ALT+W or R like crazy).\nBetween healing and infusing I cast Starcall like crazy to stack its debuff and to deal some nice damage.\nRemember to save your infuse before fights so you can silence the AP Carry (stopping burst), interrupt some channeling (Kat, WW, Malz), or prevent using escape abilities.\nSo far this works pretty well.\n\nAlso you want to buy wards like crazy. Even though I think everybody should put up wards (seriously, it's only 75 Gold...) people expect you to do it, since you are the support.
