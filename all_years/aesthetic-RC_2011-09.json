{"body": "You know, this happened to me about two years ago. I got a text from her, \"Hey. derp and I are engaged! We are so excited.\" I never responded.\n\nBut then I couldn't help but wonder why in the hell it bothered me so much? If I really cared about her, shouldn't I be excited for her? Shouldn't I at least congratulate them?\n\nAnd then it occurred to me that, in the end, what hurt the most was that all of the things I (perhaps even: we) had felt, at one point in time, were really just obstacles to her ultimate happiness. She needed to learn something from us, to gain some knowledge or self respect or preference or *something* (hell, maybe she just needed to eliminate a possibility), before she could obtain what she truly wanted.   \n\nWhich is a shitty way to look at things. An even shittier way to feel. Here's this person. You see her every day. You are beginning to wonder if there would be anything better than seeing her every day. You are beginning to wonder whether or not you could achieve everything you want in life without this person, and then SHAZAM. hah.\n\nBut over time I realized that, therefore, the same must be true for me as well. In the end, SHE was obstacle to MY ultimate happiness. Some people will say we were STEPS on each other's path, but I call that bullshit. Love is hard. You have to find the person who you are willing to fight for. Sometimes you have to fight THAT PERSON in order to have that person (R E L A T I O N C E P T I O N), but you must first overcome a lot of bullshit before you are in a place to take responsibility for yourself, and then take responsibility for someone else.\n\nNot that I'm ready for that. But I think I learned that from her. It just took two years to realize it. You'll see her name change on Facebook. And then you'll think, \"That's not my name. GTFO.\" And then you'll realize that you're only upset, not out of jealousy or anger, or even because you're afraid your \"ultimate happiness\" has moved on without you, but because you miss what you once had. It becomes an item of nostalgia. And then you realize that the person you're holding out for is going to be *that much better, but that much more difficult to obtain.*\n\nChallenge accepted.\n\ntl dr; murder her fiance. you'll feel better.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314902471", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

So now we have \"I ii iii IV V vi vii\".\n\nNow within C, this translates to the I chord being C major (upper case roman numerals mean a major chord, and lower case meaning minor chords) ii being Dmin, iii being Emin, IV being Fmaj, and so on.  Except vii which will be a diminished chord.  You can translate this rule into any key.  Try playing a I IV V progression (Cmaj Fmaj Gmaj) and you will start to recognize it.  I hope this at least gives you a baseline for learning...\n\nEDIT:  for Minor Keys.  We'll use A minor for example since it's so related to C maj.\n\nYou now have (A B C D E F G) for notes in the scale.  The corresponding chords for minor scales is as follows.\ni ii(diminished) III iv v VI VII.\n\ni = Amin -- ii = Bdim -- III = Cmaj -- vi = Dmin -- and etc. \n\nNow go google some common chord progressions and that'll get you started on the basic chord structures of a majority of popular songs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314920936", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It depends on the advice.”\n“No, you wouldn’t follow my advice. No one has ever\nfollowed the advice of another person.”\n“Now you’re just being disagreeable,” I said. “Obviously\npeople follow advice all the time. That’s not a delusion.”\n“People think they follow advice but they don’t. Humans\nare only capable of receiving information. They create their\nown advice. If you seek to influence someone, don’t waste\ntime giving advice. You can change only what people know,\nnot what they do.”\n“Okay then. Can you give me some information that\nwould help my personal life?”\n“Perhaps,” he said, clenching his red plaid blanket\ntighter around his tiny body. “What topic interests you\nmore than any other?”\n“Myself, I guess,” I confessed. \n“Yes, that is the essence of being human. Any person\nyou meet at a party will be interested in his own life above\nall other topics. Your awkward silences can be solved by asking simple questions about the person’s life.”\n“That would be totally phony,” I said. “First of all, it\nwould be like interrogating him. Secondly, I couldn’t possibly\npretend to be interested in the answers. If he turns out to\nbe some shoe salesman living with his mother in Albany, my\neyes will glaze over.”\n“It would seem phony to you while you asked the questions, but it would not seem that way to the stranger.

Find out what you and\nhe have in common, then ask how he likes it, how he deals\n108\nG o d ’ s   D e b r i swith it, and if he has any clever solutions for it. Perhaps you\nboth have long commutes, or you both have mothers who\ncall too often or you both ski. Find that point of common\ninterest and you will both be talking about yourself to the\ndelight of the other.”", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314975163", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Consider the notes within this, including, of course, the note you are trying to sing. Look at the nearest notes and consider the relationships between them. So if you were singing \"e e f g g f e d c c d e e.....f F\" (Ode to Joy), while you look at the first \"e\", you are aware of the \"f to g\" part, say. Not all the way to the end of the phrase, but within that third (mediant up to dominant or e  up to g). I don't know what key it's actually in but I'm using c major for this example. By doing this you \"situate\" the note, but then it also situates the \"g\" you go up to, which enable it to be processed better when you get to it. You are already \"at it\" in a way, since you are taking it together with the first \"e\". You will be aware of the \"third\" (e to g is a third, whether you are aware of it or not), and that will help constitute the collection of notes in the area. This all goes into how you are reading it. As you move along, the circle you draw, which is only approximate and meant to give you a sense simply of your effective reading \"locality\" will move along with you, of course, disclosing and enabling new such relationships as you go.

Any sentient creature that evolved through natural selection (which is almost certainly the only way it can happen) will at one time have had to record information. Biological organisms have limits on the amount of information they can remember.\n\n Further, any advanced lifeform will have some method of building a picture of it's environment at a distance, whether that is though the electromagnetic spectrum (which many lifeforms seem to have evolved independently on earth) or otherwise, they will have some analogue of \"vision\"\n\n They could record information in any number of ways; they could line up rows of stones, they could tie knots in a rope, they could carve 3 dimensional shapes from some material, they could imbue pheremones into some material, but eventually they will discover that recording this information in characters on a flat surface is an awfully efficient way of doing it. From there it is trivial to assume that a square is the most likely shape to be adopted- all you have to do is measure a certain distance in one direction, measure that same distance another direction, and cut.\n\nFurther, the idea of a n X m matrix is powerful and widely necessary to form a basic understanding of mathematics, I struggle to conceive of a sentient brain that would not comprehend the idea of creating an array. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315172785", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I also have too much BL to go through to remember what all I have!\n\n- your favorite BL mangaka\n\nDefinitely Fumi Yoshinaga, with Hyouta Fujiyama a close second. Yoshinaga's stories and characters are wonderfully human and grounded in reality, and yet not so mundane you find it boring. She has a way of showing rather than telling, which is very sadly lacking I find, most of the time. \n\nHyouta Fujiyama... she's not as masterful as Yoshinaga, but her stories are light and fluffy and just fun to read and with nice artwork to admire.\n\n(Third bonus mangaka: Uki Ogasawara. I wish she had more US releases!)\n\n- a BL manga you started out enjoying but ended up not liking as much\n\nMaki Murakami's Gravitation. Everyone seems to love it and there's so much merch for it... but.... I liked it up until the sudden and abrupt personality change in Shuichi (which I think coincided with his haircut) and I found the overlying premise of the story, as well as its many characters, to just be... tiring. I couldn't like Yuki one bit, and I thought Shuichi was just a doormat.\n\n- a non-BL series that you WISH was BL\n\nTiger &amp; Bunny. d e f i n i t e l y.\n\n[edited for formatting]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315202263", "subreddit": "boyslove", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So many have added their two cents, but here's my explanation.\n\nA series of examples:\n\nWhen you write a scale, you want to have one of every note name. So C D E F G A B. Now, moving round the circle of 5ths, we add a # to each scale. So G has F♯, D has F♯ and C♯, etc, etc. When we reach the key of G♯, the scale is now G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, but wait... the note that should go here is enharmonic with G! But we've already named a note after G: G♯. What we do is make that Fx (double sharp), so now we have a full G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯ E♯, F♯♯, G♯.\n\nThe thing often happens with harmonic minor scales. Using the G sharp example, a G sharp natural minor scale looks like this: G♯, A♯, B, C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯. However, to make that a harmonic minor, we just raise the F again, making it G♯, A♯, B, C♯, D♯, E, Fx, G♯.\n\nIt is much neater to use only one of each note name, because then the note retains its abstract function. For instance, F is always written notes about G on a staff. However, in the G major scale, the 7th note above G is F♯. We don't write G and Gb, because we want to show we're using the note whose function is the be 7 notes above G, regardless of whether we've modified the note. It's like how we can have a diminished 7th chord. One might just say 'It's just a diminished triad with a major 6th'. But no: its harmonic function is to be like a 7th chord. Therefore, we use a 7bb, rather than a 6.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315254367", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well...  I have a different take on this.  I can't listen to the link now because my girlfriend is asleep and I don't feel like digging out my headphones, so if this doesn't really apply, I apologize.  But.\n\nHarmonies are made of melodies.  A C major chord has three notes, C, E and G (which any 5-year-old who gets piano lessons, including myself at age 5, will know, so no crap about that).  Each of those notes has a little bit of melody inside, and it's those little bits of melody that make the harmony sound good!  For example, sing along with me:\n\nC D E F G A B...  Or, in solfege: Do re mi fa sol la ti...\n\nYou REALLY want to sing the C or the do, right?  That's because, when all of those notes come in order, the note B REALLY wants to go up to C, to resolve.  The note F, on the other hand, really wants to resolve *down* to E.  So if I play an F and a B together, the F will want to resolve to E and the B will want to resolve to C.  Harmony!\n\nWhy does a C major chord sound good, though?  Other people have already explained that -- a pitch is when air shakes at a certain speed, and for every three times G shakes, C shakes twice.  So if you play the C and the G together, their shakes will line up, and the brain likes that and thinks that it's nice.  That's called a fifth.  C to C, do to do, is called an octave.  If you put together fifths in the right way, you end up with the scale: C D E F G A B C.\n\nIf you play two notes together, that's called an interval.  If I play a C and a B together, that interval is almost like an octave, since B is close to the C just above it, but not quite, so it sounds really ugly.  But if I play C G B, the C and G sound good together -- a fifth -- and the G and B sound good together -- a major third, which is another interval that kind of lines up -- so the chord doesn't sound ugly.  It actually sounds really pretty and sad, because the mind fills in the E, making it C E G B.  C E G is a major chord -- happy -- and E G B is a minor chord -- sad -- so C E G B sounds both happy and sad at the same time.  On the other hand, C Eb G Bb has C Eb G -- a minor chord -- and Eb G Bb -- a major chord.  Since the interval between C and Bb doesn't hurt so much, you hear it, and the Bb sounds like another note in the chord but doesn't make the major chord Eb G Bb stand out.\n\nAnyway, the real answer is that nobody knows in general why harmonies sound good, but you can probably come up with some good reasons why a *specific* harmony sounds good.  My absolute favorite harmonic moment in music is in Recuerdos de Alhambra, by Francisco Tárrega -- it's a classical guitar piece (that I can't come close to being able to play yet), and it has a really simple tune with simple harmonies, in A minor.  One phrase ends with a G# on an E major chord, and the very next note is a Bb in an A major chord (really an A7b9 -- A C# E G Bb).  Why is that SO pretty?  I think it's partly because the melody has a very relaxing shape, but mostly it's because the notes G# and Bb don't belong together.  You'd expect G# and A#, or Ab and Bb, but not G# and Bb.  And at the same time, the interval of A to Bb is a really painful interval that isn't made that much better by the other notes; the G# wants to resolve up to A, but the Bb REALLY wants to resolve down to A.  So you're just waiting on the edge of your seat for it to finally get down to A.  When you have pretty chords, what usually happens is that ALL OF THOSE NOTES WANT TO RESOLVE AT THE SAME TIME, so you get a lot of feelings at once, plus you like some of the intervals (like major seconds) and they make it even prettier.\n\nIt's past 4 AM and it's past everyone's bedtime.

You can pretty much feel exactly when the show starts to falter, around mid season 2 when Charlie goes off the rails and the tailies stand around and do nothing.  \n\nThe writers even said that by mid season 3 they were *deliberately* making the episodes bad so that ABC would give them a deadline for the shows end.

{"body": "Im glad you brought this up. From journals I have read about DNA it is very complex. But before I get into that, I would like to preface my thought with DNA coding being a form of higher information. As DNA controls all the process in the living organism. The fact information is present shows there has to be a higher from of life that \"wrote\" or \"programed\" the coding. More on that later.\n\nBeside the experiment in 1953' by Dr. Stanley Miller trying to spark a bunch of gasses to produce some basic amino acids that could have lead to life. The fact of the matter is he only produce a few amino acids. They have never in any experiment found that nucleotides where ever present in their findings. Nucleotides are different then amino acids and is also just as important for life, they are smaller and more complex then RNA molecules.  Scientists have never ever found evidence of a self replicating RNA molecule randomly assembling in some pool of chemical building blocks. The consensus is minuscule, for that to actually take place, in the wild would take \"luck\". Luck is not what science is built on.\n\nNext protein molecules they are made up of as few as 50 or several hundred amino acids bound together not randomly but in a specific order, some say highly specific order. The average functional protein in a simple cell contains 200 amino acids bound in a specific order.  The chance of having some protein with only 100 amino acids in the right sequences, form on earth has been calculated as one in millions-billion.\n\nYet you need protein to create RNA Hubert P Yockey a scientist says its is impossible to think that proteins came before the RNA, because you need RNA to create the proteins.\n\n**Now on to DNA**\n\nFor a cell to survive you need RNA, DNA and proteins. How can life come about when you cannot lack even one of those they all need to be present? Like I said about DNA is a high form of information, instruction. This high form of information just happens to have its own alphabet A T G C ,\"words\"(condons) that form \"sentence structures\"(stories). The average gene has 27,000 letters that happen to complied themselves logically in \"chapters\" of sorts (chromosomes) and it takes 23 chromosomes to make a book. Would a \"book\" this complex really have no author?\n\nThis is all on top of the fact only certain letters of the genetic \"alphabet\" will go together G-C, A-T that's it! Where did the instruction for how DNA behaves come from? Trial and error hopefully over a few billion of years? Again you need DNA, RNA and proteins to make a basic cell for life.\n\nLook at how DNA is packed in the most efficient way possible mankind with our science cannot even touch the efficiency of DNA for even something as simple as computer storage. DNA can hold more information then a trillion cd's in the space smaller then the human eye can see. Look at how it is packed each chromosome is actually a long strings of DNA spun in loops the loops also are packed on coils are the right intervals for efficiency. The packing is a marvel of engineering efficiency itself. Again this takes instruction obviously of an higher order seeing we cannot duplicate this even close.\n\nWhat about the organic \"machines\" for a lack of a better word. These  specialized organic \"machines\" unpack the DNA with out damaging it, \"unzip\" the two sides, replicate BOTH sides with the exact opposite of the relevant letter G-C, A-T, with no error!! Another specialized organic \"machine\" is the transcription machine. It unwinds the DNA reads it passes the information on to the RNA. The DNA tells the RNA where to start and where to stop the reading for the information depending on what protein needs to be made. Do you really think this could have come about by chance?\n\nOk let me finish off by saying this is like but beside all this complexity within the organisms, life, or the human body. Look at all the things that needed to come together from the universe, to our solar system. The earth is in the right solar system for life. Our universe is not close to the center of the galaxy where there is a massive black hole. We are in what some have called the galactic habitable zone.\n\nOur sun is the right kind for life it isn't to massive, or too small. It isn't a red or dying star, it puts out the right kind of light for life. \n\nThe earth is the right size not to large to affect life, not to small that it doesn't have enough gravity. The earth is not to close to the sun or too far but in the right zone for life. The tilt is just right 23.5 degrees\nthat results in annual cycle of seasons, moderates temperatures, and enables a wide range of climate zones. The rotation is not to fast or too slow\n\nWhat about the moon it is the right size, and distance. Could these ting come about by chance? Without the moon the earth spin would be a wobble, that could leave the earth tipped over on its side.\n\nLets go down to the atomic level. The laws underlying these forces appear to have been fine-tuned in such a way as to produce a universe capable of supporting life. “Changing the existing laws by even a scintilla could have lethal consequences,” according to Paul Davies. For example, if protons were slightly heavier than neutrons, rather than slightly lighter as they are, all protons would have turned into neutrons. Would that have been so bad? “Without protons and their crucial electric charge,” explains Davies, “atoms could not exist.”\n\nThe electromagnetic force attracts electrons to protons, allowing molecules to form. If this force were significantly weaker, electrons would not be held in orbit around the nucleus of an atom, and no molecules could form. If, on the other hand, this force were much stronger, electrons would be stuck to the nucleus of an atom. In that case, chemical reactions and life would simply be impossible.\nA slight difference in the electromagnetic force would affect the sun and the solar energy that reaches our earth. Such a difference could easily make photosynthesis in plants difficult or impossible. So the precise strength of the electromagnetic force determines whether life on earth is possible or not.\n\nPicture this illustration visualize an explorer’s visit to an imaginary “control room for the whole universe.” There, the explorer observes rows and rows of dials that can be set to any value, and he learns that each has to be calibrated to a precise setting in order for life to be possible. One dial sets the strength of the force of gravity, one the strength of electromagnetic attraction, another the ratio between the mass of the neutron and the proton, and so on. As the explorer examines these numerous dials, he sees that they could have been set to different values. It also becomes clear to him, after meticulous calculation, that even a small change in any one of the dial settings would modify the architecture of the cosmos in such a way that life in it would cease to exist. Yet, each dial is set to precisely the right value needed to keep the universe running and habitable. What should the visitor deduce about how the dials came to be set the way they are?\n\nWith all this evidence for a fine tuned, precise intricately designed things that make up life, I cannot with reason think that all this just came about. What the evolutionist, atheist understanding or focus on one thing evolution, but even that isn't follow all considered as I pointed out information and instruction of a higher order comes into play in to many parts of life to be dismissed. And that is just on life it self when you add in all the rest about the solar system, earth, and atomic level things that play a large part life coming about by evolution in zero.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315520509", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not sure what's your level. I guess you could use a harmony book that teaches how to harmonize melodies.  I've got Leo Kraft's Gradus, but it's out of print.\n\n1) Make a rough outline of the melody. Delete repeated notes, passing tones and embellishments. For instance, if your melody goes like C D E G G G A B A B C F F E D C, you could draw an outline that goes from C up to G then higher C then again down to F and lower C.  This is not a deterministic process, of course.\n\n2) Then make a sketch of the chords. At first, use I, V, V7 only, 1 or 2 chords per bar. These chords will fit most notes in the melody. For instance, in the key of C major, the only diatonic tone not included in those chords is A.\n\n3) The version 2 will probably be a bit boring. You can insert other chords to make it more interesting.  Since you know chord progressions, that shouldn't be hard for you. If you're overwhelmed by the number of choices, just keep it simple. For instance add only ii and IV chords. \n\nWhen the music is in a \"calm\" part, you can keep only 1 chord per bar, or the same chord for 2 bars. But in more dynamic sections, you should increase the rate of chord change.\n\n4) Invert chords as necessary so that the bass line is interesting. In this process you also create some dissonance, which is good because dissonance creates a sense of motion. 100% consonance is boring.  \n\nBy the way, Kraft's answer to your question is that the melody note can be the root, third or fifth of the triad. However, if you're in the end of a phrase but not in the end of the song and the melody note is the tonic, avoid using a regular I chord, because it sounds too much like the end of the song. You can either use an inversion of I or use another consonant chord, like VI or IV. For instance, if the song is in C and the phrase ends with a C in the melody, you can use a inverted C chord such as C/E or an A or F chord.\n\nOf course, in practice you can have 7ths, 9ths and 11ths all the time, chords that aren't part of the key (say, a C# chord in a song in C), chromatic motion (D#, D, C#, C), etc. Above is just a simple start.\n\nI hope this helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315546261", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Western music theory as it is today was developed from an 11th century pedagogical system for teaching gregorian chants using hexachords. A Hexachord just means a collection of six notes, and in this context specifically two whole tones, a half tone, and two whole tones: WWHWW. All the notes used at the time in Gregorian chants could be arranged with overlapping hexachords. Thus:\n\n* G A B C D E\n* C D E F G A\n* F G A Bb C D\n* G A B C D E\n\nThe notes were sung Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La. That was it for a couple hundred years.\n\nAt this time, the only accidental necessary was a Bb. As church compositional techniques expanded, musical structures in Church settings became less rigid and more imaginative,  the keyboard was invented allowing full exploration of the 12 tone chromatic scale, and music notation advanced with advances in melody and harmony, by the 14th century (only three hundred years) sharps and flats were an obvious and necessary aspect of music. \n\nLetter/solfege names are tied to staff notation. Staff notation has the advantage of being relatively compact while symbolizing a great deal of information. If we had a system without sharps or flats with each note being distinct on its own line or space with no redundancies, the amount of awkward and wasted space would be staggering. Sharps and flats also provide quick visual clues for tonal direction (leading tones and ascending passing tones with sharps, suspended tones and descending passing tones with flats for example) that would otherwise be absent. Its only real disadvantage is that having to read sharps and flats out loud takes a mouthful of extra syllables. Solfege takes care of that well, however.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315623989", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, the total map isn't an isometry.  It's a collection of rigid motions applied to various subsets of a ball.  For example, consider the square [-1,1]^2 .   If you let A=[-1,0)x[-1,1] and B=[0,1)x[-1,1] and C={1}x[-1,1], then translating B left by 1 to f(B) and A right by 1 to g(A) will give you a reconstruction of the original square, but it's not an isometry because the distance between the point (-1/3,0) and the point (1/3,0) in the original square is 2/3, but in the reconstructed square it's d(f(-1/3,0),g(1/3,0))=d(1/3,-2/3)=1.  So not an isometry.\n\nYes, it is essential that the sets in question are non-measurable.  I can briefly go over the concept.\n\nConsider sets on the real line.  We'd like to define a \"measure\" on these sets such that the measure is \n\nA) translation invariant; m(E)=m(E+x) for any x\n\nB) obeys m(A U B) =&lt; m(A)+m(B)\n\nC) m(I)=b-a if I is [a,b], (a,b), [a,b), or (a,b]\n\nD) if I,J,K,...,L are disjoint sets, m(I U J U K U ... U L)=m(I)+m(J)+m(K)+...+m(L)\n\nE) m({})=0; m(A)&gt;=0 for all sets A\n\nYou might think we'd like it to be defined for all subsets of the reals, but as it turns out, that's impossible.  Let's see why.\n\nAn equivalence relation on a set is a statement x~y if it satisfies x~x for all x, x~y implies y~x, and x~y and y~z implies x~z.  The most common equivalence relation we're familiar with is equality, =.  But there are others; for example, over the matrices, say A~B if and only if their determinants are equal.  It's trivial to show this is also an equivalence relation (try it!)\n\nEquivalence relations partition their sets into equivalence classes.  That is, every element x is a member of a set {y:y~x}, the set of all things \"equivalent\" to x under the relation.  Since x is always equivalent to itself under any equivalence relation, such a set is always non-empty.\n\nDefine an equivalence relation on [0,1] as x~y if and only if x-y is rational.  This partitions [0,1] into uncountably many equivalence classes.  Now, using the axiom of choice, pick one element from each equivalence class and call the collection of all such choices S.  Observe that for any real number t in [0,1], there is an equivalence class T which contains t, and so by definition there must be some representative of T in S - call it t'.  By definition, t-t' is rational; hence, there is a rational number q such that t is in S+q (where the translation \"wraps around\" at 1, so that numbers larger than 1 are shifted down by 1).  Since t was an arbitrary real, we know that every real number in [0,1] is contained in some rational wrap-around translation of S.\n\nTherefore, [0,1]=U S+q, where the union is taken over all rational q between 0 and 1.  Since there are countably many such rationals, [0,1] is a countable union of these sets.  By our first defining feature of a measure, m(S)=m(S+q), and by our fourth, m([0,1])=Sum(m(S)) where the sum is counable.  But then 1=countable infinity*m(S).  So if m(S)=0, then 1=0, and if m(S)&gt;0,  1=countable infinity.  Since these are both false, S must not be measurable.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315685910", "subreddit": "math", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "On a piano, start on C, and then play every note (white and black), until you get to C again an octave higher. You will have played the twelve notes of the chromatic scale (C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B). The difference between each note is called a semitone.\n\nNow, let's look at a different type of scale, one more commonly used in popular music, called the diatonic scale (with seven notes as opposed to twelve). Instead of using equal intervals between the notes like the chromatic scale did, the diatonic scale is a little bit different. Starting on C again, if you play only the white notes (C D E F G A B), you will have played a diatonic scale. You'll notice that instead of only using semitones, it uses the following pattern - tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone (a tone is just two semitones). Now try it again, starting on D and sticking to that same pattern of tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone (D E F# G A B C#). You'll notice it sounds very similar, only this time you're playing in the key of D, as opposed to C.\n\nThis is where major and minor come in. The diatonic scales that we've played so far are major scales. Major scales use that tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone pattern that we heard earlier. Now, let's go back to C major (C D E F G A B). You can play those same notes, starting on any of the seven notes in that scale (D E F G A B C, G A B C D E F, etc). You'll notice it sounds quite different every time. These are called modes of the diatonic scale, and of course, there are seven in total. Most of them aren't important right now, but the ones we want to look at are the first (which we know) - the major scale, and the sixth - the minor scale.\n\nLet's play the notes of C major, but instead start on A (A B C D E F G). The result is a sadder sound. But we don't call this the sixth mode of C major (although we could, if we really want to), we call it a A minor. After all, it starts on A and it seems to be built around A. It uses a different pattern to the major scale - tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone, tone.\n\nTo think of it in a slightly different way, the minor scale is like the major scale, except the third, sixth, and seventh notes are lowered by a semitone. So while C major is C D E F G A B, C minor is C D Eb F G Ab Bb. A major is A B C# D E F# G#, A minor is A B C D E F G. Since we have twelve different notes, we can have a major and a minor scale built on each, making for twenty-four commonly used scales in Western music.\n\nGoing back to your question, to play in the key of (for example) G minor means to play a piece of music built around the notes in the G minor scale (this is an oversimplification, but for all intents and purposes, it'll do as a definition).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315924252", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Something like \"Angus McSoandso reads the newspaper about an IRA bombing.  He says 'No Scotsman. yadda yadda yadda'.  He is then shown another clipping about Feargus McOtherguy blowing up a post office.  He then says, 'Well, no *troooeu* (poorly simulated brogue) Scotsman would do such a thing'\n\nLanguage is by consensus.  Logic is not.  A bare statement \"No true X is Y\" simply  c a n n o t   b e  a logical fallacy.  More is required.  This is all I have been insisting on.  When you bring in external context, we are no longer dealing with a bare statement.  However, the fallacious reasoning can be inferred from the context.  It is therefore an *implied* fallacy, but not on its face a fallacy.\n\nAlso, \"I reason that you are a frog who has learned to type\" may very well be a stupid conclusion.  It is almost certainly false.  **But it is not fallacious.  It, on its face, entails no error in logic.**  Until we know how you arrived at the conclusion, and what the terms you are using are intended to mean in their context, we cannot know that your reasoning is flawed.  We only know that it probably is flawed somewhere.\n\nAnd I'm not talking about secretly redefining anything.  If the point is to determine whether the speaker intends to say something cogent or fallacious -- that is to say whether his/her thinking is flawed -- we have to know what he is using them to mean.\n\nIdentifying every possible definition is not necessary, as long as we recognize the difference between an explicit and an implied error.

Evidence of government collusion, ok how about the fact WTC7 was not included in the 9/11 Commion report and the NIST engineers have yet (including the goverment) offer an \"offical reason\" for the collaspe. If it were fallen due to debris, (debris was not evenly dispearsed throughout the area,) how could it  collaspe staight down and one side falling into another area,  straight down in \"almost\" free fall speed. Not to mention the BBC reported it had collasped 15 mintues before it actually dropped. The only question I ask that you MUST answer is how the building fell at free fall speed, near freefall. Use only logic and see how it came down. Regardless if it was GOVERNMENT, AL Q + Bin Laden, the fact is WTC7 has been completely ignored in media. Can't have it both ways ok, planes hit towers with JET FUEL weaken steel and collaspe. But this time plain old fires bring down a builind. \n\nSo yes, mindless in the fact you can see evidence right in front of you, research it yourself, but you wait for someone, or thing from some \"authority\" you deem good enough before you'll except facts.\n\nWHat about this evidence : \n\nRead the NIST REPORT : http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.cfm\n\nStudy what is says, they say ... things like \"Is it possible that thermite or thermate contributed to the collapse of WTC 7?\n\nNIST has looked at the application and use of thermite and has determined that its use to sever columns in WTC 7 on 9/11/01 was unlikely.\"  U N L I K E L Y, not yes or no. Read it. Question it. Now if you got the guts, look harder ..............\n\nBeginning with the penthouse, all 47 stories of it imploded into its own footprint in less than seven seconds. Three different videos of Building 7’s vertical collapse – two from CBS video broadcasts, and one from an NBC news camera – can be seen online at http://wtc7.net/videos.html.\n\nIf you go back to the NIST report ( which is IF you read it NOT conclusive), if says one collum failed and brought down the whole thing, again in under 10 seconds. 1 ..... 2 ..... 3..... 4...... 5..... get my drift.

{"body": "Udyr is a very good solo top champion with only a few counters. He generally performs exceptional in lane. \n\nI like to start with Q, use Q in the starting area and head to your lane (or jungle if your team wants to make some early game noise).\n\nNow your next attack will apply Tiger dot, so if your lane opponent wants to tango early and gets in range smack him with that first dot, hit Q and smack him again with the Tiger dot. He will be very afraid.\n\nI forgot to mention, if you are playing against an AD player top go cloth armor + 5 pots, it gives you good sustainability. You aren't looking to kill your opponent unless your jungler wants to go for an early gank. You need a lot of CS to be a useful Udyr late, so make sure you're last hitting well.\n\nI level Q W W E W Q W Q W etc.\n\nStaying in turtle stance and regening health/mana is what makes lane Udyr strong. Getting a lantern is very good for lane sustain as well, and merc treads or ninja tabi depending on the game are the way to go. When you want to harass your opponent and they are getting close to you, pop into bear, stun, hit Q, get them with the Tiger dot and let them run away unless you think you can get the kill. It will keep them weakened and afraid of you.\n\nYou will spend most of your time in turtle, just farming away, try not to get too overextended. A Spirit Visage should be your next item assuming that your laning phase is still happening. If laning is over for whatever reason I would go straight for a Wit's End assuming they've got a couple of APs.\n\nIn team fights, Udyr is a bruiser, you will want to be spamming your stances, get those stuns onto a few people with E, then make sure you get your Q up on a squishy and W shield for survivability, and repeat. Udyr is VERY disruptive and hard to stop in a team fight as long as your team is with you. Don't just charge in if your team isn't ready.\n\nIf AD champs are hurting too much a Randuin's is a great choice. Udyr is  a very strong champion, and can definitely be a game changer.\n\nAlso, you have a Wriggle's and very good attack speed, you and your jungler can dragon exceptionally fast, so keep that in mind as well. Same goes for Baron just don't do anything super risky.\n\nUdyr can take a beating in lane and not care when you've got a couple items and a high ranked W. The Rain Man plays an excellent Udyr if you can find any videos of that. \n\n\nIn the end Udyr needs items, he needs to be able to take punishment do be effective in a team fight.

{"body": "&gt; Sure, but that's like saying that subsistance farming has been around for millennia longer than computers, so farming your own food is more relevant and influential in developed countries today than being able to find your way around Windows.\n\n... you're twisting a flawed analogy to the limits of intelligibility here! :) (Another smiley to reassure you, lol.) My argument wasn't about which social construct is more \"relevant\" today! \n\nMy argument was, an idea that has been part of a social construct for millennia is necessarily more deeply rooted and more pervasive than an idea that has sprung up in our society only a few decades ago. \n\n*Deeply rooted*. Its roots spread out farther than you can see on the surface. It has sprouted other practices and traditions and ways of thinking elsewhere, in seemingly unconnected spheres of life, and we can't tell just by looking at the surface that the same idea is at the root of all these things. \n\nIn fact, this new idea that has sprung up? Has sprung from the same root. It's not a new idea at all. Just a new incarnation of the older, deeply rooted one. But you're looking at this new idea and going: *Here's the culprit! Look, its fruit is so sweet everybody loves this plant, so it MUST be the culprit!*\n\nOh dear... I seem to have gone from analogy to extended metaphor. But does that make it clearer? If you agree that the root of the \"women are nonthreatening\" idea lies in the patriarchy, then you must necessarily blame the patriarchy for it, not feminism, even if some feminists spout the same line. Because the patriarchy's where feminism is getting that idea from, and more importantly, the patriarchy is the reason why feminists are taken seriously when they spout this idea. \n\nFeminism is new, people don't take to its pronouncements easily unless it meshes perfectly with a more powerful idea that already exists. Women only got the vote, for instance, because of two ideas already having been well established in society: \"a democracy is *of the people*\" and \"women are people\". \n\nOther feminist ideas, no matter how reasonable or logical or just, are still struggling against the overbearing power of patriarchal traditions because they don't mesh easily with well established ideas in society. For instance, women still take their husband's names when they get married, and children still get their father's names, because patriarchal tradition says \"men give their names to their wives and children\". \n\nSo feminism isn't as powerful as you are making it out to be. Feminists are only successful when our ideas happen to coincide with society's other long-held beliefs, because feminism is new and relatively powerless to impose *actual* original ideas yet. \n\n&gt; Sex roles have been turned on their head in span of some people's lifetimes.\n\nI agree. Don't get me wrong, I am by no means arguing that we are still caught in the vice of overt patriarchalism to nearly the same extent that we were just a lifetime ago. \n\nBut you must recognise that the roots of the patriarchy go deeper than *any* of us can see, it frames our lives and defines the parameters on which debate can even take place to an extent that we cannot even begin to deconstruct. \n\nTake for instance the idea that women ought to be paid to perform the labor of pregnancy and childbirth and breastfeeding. Even *capitalist* feminists will fight against this, instinctively, for no reason at all. Is it not real labor? Does it not financially impact only women, even though the decision to have children is taken by both men and women, and we aspire to consider fathers and mothers equal parents in every other way? \n\nBut this is considered sacriligeous by most people. Because forces stronger than the idea of perfect equality and justice for men and women have conditioned us to think of women's labor as something we all are simply entitled to. Not like men's labor, which must always be paid for, because how else will a man support himself and his family. Or so the horrendously faulty chain of logic goes.\n\n&gt; If women don't have a sex drive, why mutilate them to prevent them from using it? ... To bring it full circle, though, if your original argument was that denying that women have a sex drive contributes to dismissing the idea of women as perpetrators of sexual abuse, how does that fit with only \"bad\" women enjoy sex?\n\nYou expect me to defend patriarchal beliefs as logical when they are anything but! Hahaha. Perhaps their \"logic\" would word it this way: \"bad women have sexual appetites, but in order to avoid giving good women ideas, we must acknowledge such appetites in women as little as possible and make chastity the standard all women must aspire to.\" So overtly, the patriarchy says \"women don't have sex drives\". One level deeper, it says \"women who do have sex drives are flawed, broken, or damaged\". Go deeper still, and you get your madonna/whore dichotomies and complexes.\n\ntl;dr:  **P A T R I A R C H Y**\n\nWhat I am saying is surely not news to you. Try not to come at this from such a rigidly present-day-western-country perspective. Why was Mary the mother of Jesus a virgin? Why was she herself concieved immaculately? Why are there so many Hindu myths centering around trial by fire to determine if a woman is \"chaste\"? Why does the word chaste only ever apply to women? Why are there so many Chinese myths centering around virginity and deflowering (and subsequent degradation) of women? Why, until just a couple of decades ago, was the word \"virginity\" only applicable to women, and why is sex with a virgin woman called \"deflowering\"? Move to present-day-western-societies: why is it that over 95% of men report having masturbated by age 16, but less than 30% of women can say the same? \n\n&gt; Thousands of prominent feminist voices? Really? Could link to some examples?\n\nPlease google the phrase \"ways in which the patriarchy hurts men\", and enjoy the cornucopia. \n\n&gt; feminists working on degendering abuse-- where are they when VAWA comes up for refunding?\n\nThere's a difference between working on degendering narratives of abuse and victimhood *in order to empower women* and *in order to delink violence from the performance of masculinity*, and pretending that actual abuse that happens in the world today is completely free of gender issues. \n\nHere is where feminists and MRAs disagree: the so-called \"facts\" are different in our opinions. Feminists don't believe that DV against men *as it actually happens today* is just as bad as DV against women *as it actually happens today*. So you won't see feminists clamoring for equal funding for battered men as battered women. Because the facts according to feminists say many many many times more women are battered than men. \n\nBut you will see most feminists speaking out very loudly about the necessity of listening to and believing and helping victims of DV (or violence in general) no matter what their gender. It is not necessary to think women batter men just as often as men batter women in order to do this. \n\nOkay, this has become really long and it has meandered to places far from where we started.

{"body": "Don't worry buddy, this will probably be its only two posts. After this it's straight to basement for FlairBot where he'll be making neighborhood tags at slave labor wages for the rest of his robot life until he wears of his usefulness. Then we'll take the remaining tired, worn-out, rusty husk of FlairBot and sell him for scrap metal. From there, he will be moved by the \"robot reconditioning\" buyers to the scrap yard so his batteries can be completely depleted of energy before the reconditioning process. Due to the nano-super-conductive battery cells FlairBot has installed, it could be up to 100 years before they reach there half-life and FlairBot can be safely disassembled. During this time he will be left to sit and contemplate his once shining moment in r/Chicago before being put forth to its programmed task. FlairBot will remain in the corner of the scrap yard, a shadow of once he once was, now just a piece of twisted rusty metal, scared, broken and lonely. Only occasionally piquing the interest of teenagers who enter the yard to tag profanity on the side of FlairBot and the rest of the broken machines who spent their lives in servitude to the human race. \n\nIt will comfort itself on those cold endless raining nights with the only happy memory of it's toilsome existence \"[LINK FIXED]Hello, I am the ChicagoFlairBot.

It will be crushed, and it's aluminum will be extracted and probably be used as containers for the latest 2130 diet craze \"The Horned Melon Diet\", which was a big hit on the show \"Fucking things suck, lulz.\"!  \n\n\nAnyway guy, don't worry, you still got a lot of time to catch up that Karma!

{"body": "The pictures are pretty important in this devblog, so [here's a screengrab](http://imgur.com/J7x3C) hosted on imgur.  Failing that, here's the text:\n\n&gt;Ola!\n\n&gt;I'm CCP Punkturis of Team BFF and I'm here to talk about font changes. Yup you heard me F O N T changes!\n\n&gt;I know you have all had problems with differentiating between I1, O0, 5S, 6G&amp;, 8B  and I don't blame you:\n\n&gt;the old font\n\n&gt;So let me present Eve Sans Neue, where you can see the difference between letters:\n\n&gt;We’re still tuning this, don’t worry if some screenshots look a bit wonky right now. The font is, for example, sitting a bit too high at the moment so it seems like there’s not enough space above it at times, but that will be fixed.  \n\n&gt;All about it\nEve Sans Neue is a refinement of the original Eve Sans font. The design was revised, it was technically updated and readability has been improved. Among other updates, it now contains native Cyrillic characters, different fonts for different size groups, and a rounder form that improves legibility.\n\n&gt;To get the new font to render the best we could we had to update our version of FreeType. While we were at it, we decided to change our approach of using FreeType slightly and move more of the work into C++, rather than Python. This results in a significant speed boost in text rendering, meaning we spend less time opening up new windows in EVE. We've also changed how we handle characters that don't exist in our font. We used to search through your Windows Fonts folder for some preferred fallback fonts, then failing that, searching for the font with the most characters in it. Now we've simply licensed the Arial Unicode font and provide that with the EVE client, using it to render any characters not available in the EVE font.\n\n&gt;Label styles\nWe didn’t have much consistency in the way we displayed labels. So to make the look of EVE more consistent we created just a few label styles and applied those to the existing labels. That means some of the text will be smaller than it was before, and some will be larger. This also means that maintaining the labels and making style changes in the future will be a walk in the park.\n\n&gt;\"I DON'T TYPE IN CAPS CAUSE I'M MAD I TYPE IN CAPS BECAUSE I'M LAZY!!!\" - Kanye West\nEVE was full of uppercase labels. I kind of felt sometimes like the client was screaming at me; anyone else feel the same? So we removed a lot of the uppercasing. It's our opinion that the text is more readable now.\n\n&gt;A good example of this is the esc menu. Here's how it was before:\n\n&gt;the old esc menu\n\n&gt;And here's how it is now:\n\n&gt;the new esc menu\n\n&gt;I know this is quite a lot of change in something that many of you spend a lot of time staring at so it's probably going to take some time getting used to. Some people at the office thought it was a bit wonky at first but quickly started to like it.\n\n&gt;Try it out and post!\nSince there are endless things you guys do in EVE and we have probably not covered all of the use cases, we want to ask you to try it out on Singularity (real soon) and then report all issues in this thread.\n\n&gt;Let us know if you find text that doesn't fit in windows, let us know if you notice that the wrong font is being used. Let us know if you see anything you don't like! Try typing in the chat and see if the correct font is being used (especially you guys who type in \"weird\" languages - I'm Icelandic and I consider Icelandic not weird).\n\n&gt;Note that this is still work in progress!\n\n&gt;We will be monitoring this thread and we'll try to get to things as quickly as possible.\n\n&gt;I really hope this change is going to make life easier and EVE more readable for you all,\n\n&gt;Thank you for listening!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1316529423", "subreddit": "Eve", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK, the explanations here range from the overly succinct to the unnecessarily complicated, so I'm just going to try and write something coherent and short as possible. \n\nEvery key has a series of chords associated with it. We call these chords the *diatonic chords*. All the notes in all the diatonic chords are members of the scale of the key. For instance, in the key of G, all the diatonic chords are members of the G major scale.\n\nOK, so how do we choose which notes go to which chord?\n\nLet's look at the G major scale:\n\nG A B C D E F# G A B C D E F# G\n\nEssentially, to find the diatonic chords, we simply take every other note for three notes starting from a particular pitch. For example:\n\n**G** A **B** C **D** E F#  - The bold notes here give us a **G Chord**\n\nG **A** B **C** D **E** F#  - The bold notes here give us an **Am Chord**\n\nAnd so on and so forth. As it turns out, the diatonic chords will always follow the pattern \n\nI IIm IIIm IV V VIm VII˚ (the last one is diminished - don't worry about it.) So Bm and Em will also be minor in the key of G, since Bm is the 3rd note in the scale and Em the 6th.\n\nNow of course comes your central question: why are some chords minor? \n\nIf you look at the G chord, it contains the 1st (usually called root), 3rd, and 5th note of its G major scale right? OK, well since it just contains the root, 3rd and 5th from it's *major* scale we'll call it a *major* chord.\n\nNow let's look at the A *minor* scale:\n\n**A** B **C** D **E** F# G# - Notice anything? It's an A minor chord in bold! I used the same method that I used before to find the G major chord. So essentially, the minor chords in the diatonic chords act like they're each in their own minor key, but when put in context of the key of G, it still goes well because all the notes of the chord are in the key! Isn't music awesome?!\n\n\nPS: If you actually can't spell out scales and I misinterpreted you, visit [musictheory.net](http://musictheory.net). If that's the case, by the way, you don't actually know what a \"key\" is; this mixup happens a lot with beginners.\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1316561529", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I usually run Armor Pen reds, Attack speed blues and quints, and flat armor yellows. For masteries i either run 21/0/9 or 1/8/21. Offensive gives you a slightly faster jungle time, but utility gives cdr, regen, 30% longer buff duration, and sweet sexy runspeed, lower smite and flash cds. I prefer the tiger route and usually start with cloth armor + 5pots and ask for a leash on blue. \n\nI usually skill Q W Q E (prioritize W&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;R, you only need 1 point in bear at either 3 or 4 to gank, max phoenix last) and try gank at 4. \n\nTiger spam and smite is more than enough to do a healthy blue with a leash, then move on to wolves, wraiths, double golem, save smite for red (depending on how well you do you might have to B for red. If i do, i usually buy boots before i red and maybe a health pot just in case so i can gank immediately after). \n\nIts slightly slower than the phoenix route but it has a much stronger gank potential imo. Wriggles really shouldn't be passed up on udyr, as it's an EXCELLENT item for bruisers in general. The lifesteal with turtle is just amazing. It has armor, AD, and free ward for only 1600g. Whats not to love? \n\nThe main thing about jungling is map awareness. Ward river, their jungle and other key points (buffs, dragon, blah blah). I usually carry an extra ward or 2 on top of wriggles just to keep an eye on their jungle and to help counter gank or warn my team. \n\nI personally love playing udyr as a jungle bruiser and usually build from wriggles, either mercs or ninja tabis depending on the other comp, heart of gold, phage, chain armor, negatron, finish atmas. Then either a FoN or Banshees depending on the enemy comp. There is no specific item build because so many items for bruisers are dependent on the other team comp. You just have to adjust to what fits the situation. Sometimes I'll mallet, sometimes I'll skip getting defensive items and rush a trinity.\n\nTL;DR By lvl 4 have 2 pts in Q, 1 in W and E.

{"body": "There are two schools of thought on this. Descriptive linguists think we ought to study how and why language changes. Prescriptive linguists think that precedent doesn't matter, and the only true meaning of a word is what which is printed in a rule book. \n\nFirstly, from where (if i were writing this 300 years ago, I'd have said \"whence\" or you'd have criticized me) can we derive \"proper\" language use. Who decides that? \n\nI present the word \"nice\". The etymological history of the word nice comes from \"nescius\". (http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nice)[source] meaning \"not knowing\", \"foolish\", \"ignorant\" etc.\n\nIf I say \"Oh, he's a nice guy\" or \"Oh, he's a foolish guy\" you'll take away very different meanings. But the word changed over the last 6 or 7 hundred years, as these things are wont to do.\n\nIt's an ongoing battle among linguists. One one hand descriptivism sounds highly nihilistic, but on the other hand, why not let the native speakers decide what their language does and doesn't do?\n\nIf we disagree on this, it's only because our definition of \"word\" is different. My definition calls it a single and distinct element of language.  Yours is different. I'm not going to call you out on that, because that's not what I do. Instead, I'm going to ask many people what \"word\" means to them and try and figure out how and why it came to be that something that I see so blatantly as a word is so decidedly not in your mind. \n\nNow you're attacking my grammar. If I were an English teacher, this might bother me. But you presumably knew about what I meant (which is the function of language\" As a counter, i had to read that rebuttal several times before i realized it was a fragment, but once I did, I moved on with my life. I Recognize my \"botched contraction\" as nonstandard, but I do feel like my placement of \"as such\" was appropriate. The rest I'll dismiss as typos and appeal to (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7E-aoXLZGY)[Stephen Fry]. \n\nHere again, my definition of what qualifies as a linguistic variation is different. In my opinion, that's a linguistic variation (**V A R I A T I O N**). It is a token of a word which I take to mean one thing, and you take to mean another. Perhaps I should have said \"semantic variation\"? If this is still incorrect by your reckoning, then I'm very sorry for having offended you, but I would like to point out, that you more than likely knew about what I was talking about. \n\nCorrect (or should I say \"standard\"?) use of (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription)[prescriptive]. \n\nCounterproductive is already a word. A word which in my mind is negative, but by using the Latin root from which the word came from, I think it sounds a little MORE negative. I just like to use Latin roots, no need to hate. But you DID know what I meant there! So I succeeded in coining a new word. (according to my definition)\n\nYou don't need to believe me, because our definitions of \"linguist\" are probably very different things.

Its especially useful when you are trying to describe notes in chords / some of the harmony being created / interactions between notes.\n\nDegrees refer to the individual locations of notes within a scale.  For example C major  (C D E F G A B) the 3rd degree is E, the 6th degree is A.\n\nIf you have a C minor chord (C Eb G) you can see by comparison to the C major scale, the Eb is a flattened note.  You can describe that as having a b3, which creates a minor third with the root of the chord -&gt; C minor.  In fact, take any chord, identify its \"root\" note and compare the other notes to the major scale of the root, and you will find out alot about the chords structure.\n\nBe careful, having a 3 or b3 does not always mean major/minor.  Diminished and augmented chords have a b3 and 3 respectively, but tell tell signs would be the presence of a b5 or #5 to name those chords.\n\nMay be well worth the time to look into the structures of chords + how to name them and also some ways to construct chords. For example, in the Key of C, which seventh chords have a 7 or b7 and why.

{"body": "Roman numerals are a way to represent chords in music theory.  If it's a capital roman numeral (I V VI etc), the triad is major.  If it's lower case (ii vi etc), the triad is minor.  Roman numerals allow you to quickly take a chord progression from one key and transfer it to another key.  The next step is to associate the roman numerals with a scale.  Let's take a C major scale:\n\n* C D E F G A B C\n\nNow lets form a triad on each scale degree using only notes from the C major scale.  We want a triad, which is a stack of thirds, so we're going to use every other note from the scale:\n\n* C E G | D F A | E G B | F A C | G B D | A C E | B D F | C E G\n\nSo now we want to figure out what quality each triad is:\n\n* Major | minor | minor | Major | Major | minor | diminished | Major\n\nAt this point we can assign a roman numeral to each scale degree to accurately convey what the quality of the chord is:\n\n* I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | vii° | I\n\nSo why bother with roman numerals?  Let's say we have a simple pop chord progression like:\n\n* C | Amin | F | G\n\nNow we can play the \"song\" in the key of C, great.  What if we want to play the song in F?

The fifth note, or G, is the base of the \"fifth\" - so the G major chord is the \"fifth.\"\n\nIt just so happens that if you play the fourth (F chord), then the fifth (G chord), then the root (C chord), it sounds pretty darn good.

Write my-insert, which inserts a given element into a list at a given location (zero based). If the location is too small (i.e. negative) or too large (i.e. greater than or equal to the length of the list), the function should place the new element at the beginning or end of the list as appropriate.\n\n        (my-insert 'a '(b c d e) 0) =&gt; (A B C D E)\n        (my-insert 'a '(b c d e) 3) =&gt; (B C D A E)\n        (my-insert 'a '(b c d e) 14) =&gt; (B C D E A)\n      \n3.

Write my-flatten, which \"flattens\" a list.

He switched to edit mode, eager to demonstrate his knowledge. \"See you just type in a URL\" he proceeded to type www.

A managed language was not even on the table.\n\n&gt; It's really little more than managed C++ with some upgrades\n\nNot at all. Out of the top of my head, C++ supports template meta-programming and functional programming, (I know there are others) that C# simply doesn't have in it's toolbox. On top of that, it is deterministic (no VM). In all cases where those things matter, C# is not even in the running.\n\n&gt; and lets face it managed code is eventually going to take over.\n\nFor the \"typical desktop application\" ( that means, probably GUI oriented, using a DB somewhere and requiring _ decent performance^TM _ ) you're probably right.\n\nFor high quality graphics games, you are not. Nor are you for low level code (have a look at Haiku OS, linux - though linux is in C), performance critical code, embedded systems or simply places where you really don't want managed code at all.\n\nFor example, the scripting support in your browser is (probably) written in C++, because having a VM running an interpreter that processes JavaScript would be downright stupid (and lead to **I N C E P T I O N**).\n\nAs another example, I had an interview for a C++ job with a company developing positronic particle accelerators for cancer treatments. Their HW was controlled with a C++ application, because they wanted 100% deterministic behavior (the risks of something going bad were bad enough that they didn't even consider anything managed). \n\n&gt; I don't buy the performance argument because in the big picture most of your performance bottlenecks are probably from bad code\n\nFor amateurish applications (\"I wrote a python script to download my gmail\") or the typical website or desktop application, you're probably right.\n\nFor a server platform where weekly performance testing throughout development was a requirement from the design stage of the product, there is no \"most of your performance bottlenecks\", because the whole server is designed from the ground up to avoid all conceivable performance bottlenecks.\n\nAt that level you have to be familiar with memory allocation policies (and sometimes implement several of them in several parts of your code), thread synchronization alternatives (i.e. \"don't use mutexes at all\") numerical methods for approximating a function's results with a faster-implemented approximation, processing parallelization, in-memory databases and others.\n\nManaged code just doesn't cut it.\n\nOn the other hand, the performance argument is not the only argument to consider. For example you may want low-level control (C, C++, ASM, D, ...), C-like performance (ASM, C, C++, D, ...) with higher-level abstractions (C++, D), with good cross-platform support (and suddenly C++ is the only candidate remaining).\n\n&gt; I think you'd eventually find that averaged performance and up-time will be higher with managed code, \n\nJust \"no\". This also ignores the cases where the performance is \"so critical\" that you want to avoid the overhead of the VM itself. It may apply for high-performance applications, but not for performance-critical ones.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317372366", "subreddit": "cpp", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}
