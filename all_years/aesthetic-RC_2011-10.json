{"body": "1. Yes you can, just get a okay leash at blue buff and if nessecary use your potion.  I generally dont have to much of an issue with blue, as long as they leash it you can use the potion to make up the difference in good/bad leash since you dont really NEED it(the hp pot) anyways since your passive and camp clearing will leave you half hp + for every camp with my runes etc.\n\n2. Early ganks only work if they are effective and if done correctly.  If you think it would pay of to gank a lane early then do it.  If you think you wont be able to take advantage of that early gank all you did was waste your own time and open yourself to counter jungling.\n\n3. philo &gt; boots &gt; mana crystal &gt; catalyst &gt; RoA &gt; mercs/sheen &gt; triforce &gt; need damage?(atmas) otherwise build tank\n-note that maokai scales very well with HP, so much so i would get sunfire or banshees just because of the health over an item like thornmail or frozen heart unless necessary for CDR or to counter a fed enemy.  If you think you need randiuns, then get a HoG early, I generally dont build randiuns unless they have a trynd or we severely lack cc.\n\n4. Know the enemy junglers speed and take advantage of them being slow or not clearing their wolves or other camps quickly before blue.  Most junglers are too slow to stop you if you instaclear wolves and do blue then steal wraiths and go finish your jungle.  Be sure to call cvs and know thy enemies clear speed and you can counter jungle them easily, quickly, and very safely.  \n\nTips\n\n--------------------------\n\nWhen you do your combo with maokai in ganks etc, the most effective way to do it is first toss sapling and then bind them.  If you miss sapling you lose LOTS of damage on them, but your bind is not long enough to get the full sapling off if you sapling AFTER a binding. attack order would be, sapling &gt; bind &gt; ult &gt; Q &gt; end ultasap &gt; hope they die\n\nMy skilling order as it is rather unique...\n\nE Q E W E R E Q E Q Q Q R W W R W W \n(usually)\n\nMy reasoning is that the extra damage from your ult is not worth it because your Q has about a 2.5-3.5 second cooldown and does about 300 damage, as well as the damage reduction or cooldown on your ult do not increase/decrease enough to make it worthwhile either.  Your ult only gets an extra 100dmg from another level so your damage output is dutifully decreased if you level W which has a high cooldown, and R which is a once a fight thing that is very difficult to use for damage.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317663722", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In the following, the numbers represent the quarter notes and the \"&amp;'s\" represent the offbeat eighth notes of two measures in 4/4 time. K=Kick and S=Snare.\n\n    |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |\n    |K   S   K S     |K   S   K S     |\n\nSo basically, yes, you're right about the rhythm. Sometimes the Kick on beat three is dropped for a few measures, usually when the low growl sound comes in. This moves the Kick sound out of the way so that the growl sound has room, frequency wise. All the other Kick-Snare variations are based on this basic beat, and in particular the change-up two bar phrase that sometimes follows the main one from above is this:\n\n    |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |\n    |K   S K   S   S |K K S K K S S   |\n\nFor example, if you listen to the four bars beginning at 1:00 (although it first happens earlier in the track), the Kick-Snare pattern is this:\n\n    |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; |\n    |K   S   K S     |K   S   K S     |K   S K   S   S |K K S K K S S   |\n\nNotice the subtle alteration of the Kick placement in measure three; this gives momentum to the rhythm and leads into the final, frenetic measure of the phrase. There is neither Kick nor Snare on the final eighth note so that the beat has some room to \"breath\" before going back into the main break. All the other Kick-Snare patterns are simply minor variations on these two basic ideas.\n\nHope that helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317799463", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Trying to break down the studio version of Bloom would be quite a task; there is so much going on that it'd really be sort of pointless to try and transcribe it perfectly as sheet music. \n\nOn the other hand, while the live version is pretty thick with percussion and guitar loops, we can actually see most of what's going on as it's being played. Unlike the studio version, I can tell with you certainty that the live version is all in 4/4 (I guess you could *technically* say Jonny's snare/tom bit is in 12/8, but it's really just a sort of swung beat exaggerated to be a little slow in 4/4). The first few licks that Thom plays and loops (the E D E D part being one of them) repeat and them seem to fall off the beat, but that's just the nature of adding 3+ layers of loops at one time really quickly as Thom does; it's also one of the things that gives the song its lush texture and depth, i.e. makes it fuckin' TOIT.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317893577", "subreddit": "radiohead", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

A lot of these new-age piano songs rely heavily on arpeggios.  So try working out arpeggios on the four chords above and start stringing them together until they start to sound like the recording.\n\nFor another hint on figuring out probable notes, break it down into an overarching scale.  The chord progression is always going back to D minor so that's a safe bet for what key it's in.  From there we can figure out that it's D natural minor (which uses the same notes as F major).  So now we have a scale: D E F G A Bb C D.  That tells us that we're not expecting tons of flats and sharps, we're going to stick to mostly white notes.  Try playing that scale over the chord progression, it sounds nice.\n\nI strongly urge you to break out of the \"I need sheet music to play the piano\" mentality.  If pianists would take the time spent searching for sheet music and starting using that time to transcribe, they would learn a lot more in the long run.  Yes, it's difficult.  Yes, it takes longer.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M\n\nHowever, the typewriter was a complicated machine and when you press two keys side by side quickly it sometimes jams. \n\nSo, using trial and error, he moved the letters around so that all the most used letters are very far apart. He also studied [the frequency of letter pairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram_frequency) and tried to separate letter pairs as much as possible. That way when you type, you don't usually press keys that are right beside each other -- hence reducing the probability of jamming. Interestingly, some relics of the original alphabetical arrangement still survives in small fragments like \"JKL\" and \"FGH'.

{"body": "Enjoy!\n\nWell im here at IPL still and I am reading all the forums threads, and my facebook dicussing the best of 3 we had so I may as well join the discussion too ^^\n\nReason we lost wasn't because of Akali. We lost because for some reason we never focused her and just let her kill us. That's truthfully it. If we focused her she would of dropped easily and we could win the rest of the fight. In fact I ****ed up by ulting her away when Chauster exhausted which was just bad timing as I saw the cait ulti mark on him and akali jumped so I pressed R as a reaction, which turned out to be the wrong choice so I take some blame for that 2nd game as if I didn't do that we might of won the game right there. We did have another chance to come back 2nd game but I believe Chauster should of realized after taking mid and fighting them after Baron that he was way too low to continue pushing, instead they caught up, came at us, and he instantly died. Classic bite off more than you can chew mistake but it's okay because that happens sometimes.\n\nAs a team RS was making the right calls on GOING to dragon. You think we didn't know they were going or when it's up? Of course we do, it's just the fact of ACTING on what's being said and it's a communication issue.\n\nRS is a really good team with great coordination. They're good and they were better so they won. Just comes down to taking objectives as a team and we didn't. Objective force dragons and take it, we just didn't. Objective kill Akali, no one did, everyone trying to kill Noc n Cait. Don't over analys why we lost because it's a very simple reason that series.\n\nAs far as CLG's issues..\n\nFor those saying we didn't do good duo lane with Chauster, did you guys somehow forget about the first game were we completely stomped bottom getting 3 kills to 0 on us? You might say (OHH BUT CHAUSTER -100 CS OH MY GOD) yeah it's because after taking the tower we start doing random stuff. It's like \"Yes we took a tower, now let's do nothing\" same thing happened vs WE in the final game. FB'ed Singed, took his tower, didn't apply more pressure to that lane. We crushed bot, except Cait sat bot lane CSing while we essentially ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. This comes down to leadership issues, which for some reason we're running into again.\n\nFor me and Chauster our problem is that Chauster doesn't CS when tower is gone because either Saint or Hotshot are in the free lanes besides mid after that so it becomes difficult for him to get CS, but at the same time he could be more aggressive and demand those lanes as he is the AD carry and should be the one getting fed. Again communication issue.\n\nMy issue's are I don't play confidently / aggressive enough when I should be in lane. We could be dominating a lot harder if I was confidently going in but since my infamous Annie at DH I lost a lot of my confidence for making decisions in competetive play hence me playing so passively in lane. It really broke me as a player after that because it was such a poor choice ontop of a fail. If I could get over that we could flow a lot better bottom lane. It's just the fact I think I might make the wrong choice again but that's what competitve play is in any sport. You're not always going to make the right choice, no one ever can, but you have to at least take the risk in hopes that it's the right choice or you'll never succeed and grow as a player. I think that sums up my biggest issue.\n\nAs for the warding flak I get. I agree, that I used to be a little stingy on the wards but in the last few tournaments I have really turned that around and I think I might buy the most wards out of any player in competitve play right now. The reason it looks like I am behind in wards sometimes is because CLG doesn't ward anything. They rely on me to have full ward coverage all the time when in reality that imposslbe for any single player to do. Look at our games just now. Riv said DIG's TEAM had 10+ wards out at a single time all game. You think L0CUST placed all 10 of those? No, he most likely did 4-6 because warding that all much would literally require to buy 0 items and only wards. His team contributes to it because wards are game changing. CLG as a team needs to buy wards, everyone, not just Saint and me.\n\nOtherwise Chauster and I statistically really don't lose our lane. Very few times we get out laned. It's only after the tower is gone that we lose our focus. When it comes to straight up 2v2ing bot we do quite well. We just need to work on what we do outside of the laning phase in terms of support and AD carry.\n\nHotshot plays quite well actually and he's most likely our most consistent player in terms of we can usually count on him not to die, and go even or out CS the opposing player in his lane. He's not known for killing people but that's okay because he's not the one dying either. Hotshot issue's aren't his play, but his calls can be silly at times and often contradicts what the rest of the team wants to do. Again the communication issues are I believe Hotshots biggest issue as he often wants to do one thing, and the rest of the team wants to do another. His calls are sometimes spot on but sometimes they're really not. Until Saint and Chauster start using those balls I know they have and start calling stuff again CLG will most likely be stuck in this little rut.\n\nBigfatjiji's issue that he just seems to not try it seems. The guy is hands down, one of the best team fighters in this game. His reactions, his skill, his ability to team fight is unrivaled yet his laning phase is most likely one of the weakest in competitive play right now. The only thing I can think of is that he honestly forgot how to lane, or is having some confindence issues like I am and is scared to do poorly so he's playing way too passively now. Akali vs Kennen - Kennen R A P E S that lane, yet Scarra had higher CS.. Wtf? Cass vs Ryze - Goes to Cass but not as much, but still he has the advantage. Kennen vs Singed yesterday - Goes to Kennen as he murders melee yet Singed was completely able to farm and jiji actually got first blooded by him.. These are honestly unacceptable things coming from him. We KNOW he can do it and we KNOW he's hands down top 5 players in the world when it comes to this game yet he gets outlaned almost every single game by lane matchs he should win. Something just ain't clicking and no one knows why. CLG will still manage to get by and place well in tournaments but we really need our old jiji back. The guy who doesn't give a ****, crushes noobs in lane, and dominates confidently all game long. I know he's there waiting to come out again, and when he does I really feel like CLG would be placing first or 2nd in every single tournament IF jiji manages to get his superior ability to lane back. A lot of CLG is riding on a good AP mid to come back because we haven't had one for a while now and it's hurting us massively.\n\nSaint's issue are he plays competitive play a bit too much like solo queue. He can rambo in or go on the wrong target sometimes and is a little stubborn when it comes to picks. I believe his stubborness and lack of being open is a big issue. If saint doesn't want to play a champion, he literally just won't and will pick what he wants to play sometimes. Granted this makes HIM more confortable which is a good thing to have, but at the same time it might not be the best choice to take that champion sometimes. For instance, the reason we ran Janna so much is because Saint loves the MS when he plays Udyr. Yet if we thought about it a bit more instead of going \"OH WELL SAINT LIKES JANNA ON UDYR LETS AUTO PICK HER!\" and look at that game, if I picked Taric vs Janna we would of most likley won those games. I can lock down anyone who dives Kog with a Shatter + new ulti + exhasut on Akali, she drops ****ing INSTNATLY. Hindsight is truly 20/20 and it's clear that's what we should of done. So if we didn't listen, and Saint was a little more open to team choices opposed to what he wants I think it would benifit us more.\n\nBack to Chauster again here. His issue is he is one of the smartest players in this game. He knows what to do, when to do it, and has the best calls usually. Yet he doesnt' speak up, and if we're not winning he often doesn't step up and make the calls I know he can make. He should be, and is when he does make calls, CLG's true leader. When he makes calls, and we all feed off what he says, and do stuff around him we do really well. When others start making calls because he's not stepping up to make the choices we get those communication issues, we get those bad calls, and we don't play as good. Chauster needs to work on his leadership issues because his calls alone when he's in the mindset to lead, will guide us to victory every time.\n\nEven though we're in a rut at the moment we still compete and do well vs other top teams. That's why 1 month ago when we weren't in this spot we dominated everyone with ease because when CLG flows as 1 mind we are unstoppable. It's the matter of that it most likely gets to our heads a bit, we think we can relax and stop trying so hard so we let up and teams take advantage of us in. When we do we go through these hickups, it costs us. Look at our history. Best team in the world to they're okay, to Best team in the world again, to eh they're alright, to 1 month ago, we dominated completely and almost uncontestedly took tournaments. It's just how it is sometimes and it's something we will continue to work on and be the team I know we can be.\n\nCLG is the oldest and most successful league of legends team to date. You think a few bad tournaments is going to stop us from coming back and taking hold of the scene again? We all got issues and stuff to work on as a team, but that's what good teams do. We work on it, we get out **** together and come back stronger than ever and that's what CLG will continue to do.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318252293", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah but *gasp* people still don't listen!\n\nPlayed my first ranked of the season tonight.  Last season I ended up playing competitively in the 1550-1630 range.  A term I like to use a lot--Playing Competitively--refers to the approx. Elo range that I usually reside in, after playing many, many games.  So, as a gold player, I queue it up tonight after been scared to get matched with randoms that belong much, much lower than ~1250 the starting point.  I got 1 person who understood these basics, and 3 people that were mentally clueless in terms of what they were supposed to be doing at any given point in the game.  They were actually aware of how bad they were too, especially the Malzahar who was 0-5 by 12 or 13 minutes.  I was kind the whole time, gave them constructive criticism on what they should be doing.  They didn't take it the wrong way, which people normally do, but they didn't really listen either.  If they had just listened to me saying \"alright, now the ideal thing at this point is to just farm safely and don't engage in a fight with anyone unless I am coming to gank or its a fight over dragon/baron\".  They just didn't get it at all.  People think they're doing it correctly!  They honestly do!  When I say \"Just farm, don't fight\" they think they are doing it already and continue to harass and pickle with the enemy.  You do NOT need to do that at all.  Not at all!  Just farm means j u s t - f a r m.  \n\nMy first ranked game of the season ended up a failure the first 30 minutes, but once late game rolled around (because people at 1200 have no clue how to actually push and end games), I, as Udyr, was very stout and carried my team to a win.  The sad thing, though, is that these guys got the win also..they are moving up, getting in another queue with some other people higher than before.  I feel for those people, because these guys didn't understand a single one of the points outlined above.\n\nIt's a simple game, really.  People complicate the hell out of it by thinking you gotta be so offensive by tangling with the enemy.  You really don't.  If you just focus on farming and staying safe, letting the jungler make fights happen, and defending dragon and baron, the game goes so much smoother and you end up having a much better game with your team.  If you can get each lane to do this, you'll win a game in this Elo bracket 90% of the time.  It's so simple but people complicate the shit out of it... I don't get why.  But they think they're doing it \"right\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318304114", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Chandra's Phoenix shares the 3 drop slot.  Phoenix has haste, evasion (which red aggro is going to need after turn 3) and recursion/deterrent to removal.\n\nOutlaw lacks haste, lacks evasion, and draws removal for being a flip card.\nTerror, on the other hand, is a superb card (and gains evasion), but realistically, it's a stormblood berserker with double strike (still nothing to scoff at, for sure).\n\nThe problem is that Chandra's Phoenix is  S T R I C T L Y better than outlaw.  Outlaw is ONLY better than Phoenix if it flips, and can crash for MORE than one turn.\n\nSo.  These are the scenarios. It's turn 3, you play [C'sP/KO].  You attack with [CP(2)], pass turn. your opponent plays something/anything, passes, [KO] doesn't transform. You attack with [CP(4)] [KO(2)] Cast Shock (or hold for opponents turn) if [CP(6)] Pass if [KO], transform.  If the turn wheels, and your opponent doesn't A)cast on your end step to keep KO from flipping, B)casts 2 spells to flip it back from ToKP, or C) casts removal on ToKP/CP (shock on their end step to recur CP for the next turn, with haste), Then you can swing and it brings the totals in favor of ToKP, after 3 turns.  \nThe likelyhood of that happening so so low, It can't ever be relied on.\n\nIf they didn't play after your third turn, you're completely right, ToKP will probably end the game then and there. But the vast majority of decks will reliably be playing spells on turns 3 and 4 unless they've been very unfortunate with draws.\n\nIf at any point that's interrupted, so it can't stay flipped for at least one combat step without getting removed, or doesn't flip in 2 turns, CP will always be better.\n\n**tl;dr**  Chandra's Phoenix is faster, more reliable, and dodges removal for the same cost.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318387644", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

With that the unity was over. \"My ego was dissolved,\" I thought to myself, \"that was a p r e c i o u s experience,\" I thought, as if it were mine to treasure. In the next moments, I hoped to return. And even in this very hope, my ego was fighting the possibility of freedom with the most conniving trickery. In one moment, it mocked what had happened as a mere drug experience. In another it accused me of selfishness and solipsism. It feared I was betraying myself to death, then that I was showing no compassion to myself nor to others, then that I would never be happy. It asked me why I was in my room doing drugs when I could fight to end the suffering in the world. Then it saw all of these thoughts as chains holding it from its paradise, the treasure to which it was entitled---this was of course more conniving trickery.  It was all so convincing. And then something happened that I cannot tell you about because this way of talking can only convey my experiences. As far as I experienced it, it was as if a great force came, like a lion with a spiraling mane to clear everything away. It was like a vision I had once of the angle Michael stabbing me with a flaming sword that screamed \"thou shalt\" in the languages of every sense at once. I remember the thought that it was evil. One of my last measures at protecting myself was to think that evil had come over me to tempt me by the most conniving trickery. Evil. The worst of all things. I remember a vision of a nine year old girl screaming in a house quietly in ruins in the midst of the thirty years war. I had done that, it was not nearly the worst of what I had done. I bowed in every direction until the bowing bowed as low as nothing. The unity and birth that was always there returned somehow. It was as all my breathing joined the one exhaling. I think that is thinking together... I am missing the whole thing! ... Let us try to think together. Let us even stop loving ourselves...

{"body": "If you're holding each chord for two measures, you're kind of giving each of them the opportunity to become \"home\" before you move on.  You can't necessarily be purely analytical, one of the coolest things about music theory.\n\nAnyway, the A major is probably going to be the I, and the F major is the bVI, which, as other commenters have pointed out, is \"borrowed\" from A minor.  This concept of \"borrowing\" might not be so useful here, though, so let's take a step back and reconsider what a \"key\" means.\n\nIn Western music, certain patterns have emerged where a piece of music uses a particular set of seven pitches with one of them the tonal center.  Those seven pitches might be C D E F G A B, with C the tonal center, and this is called C major.  Why those seven pitches?  They just work, harmonically.  The I, IV, and V chords, the basis of our Western system of harmony, are contained in those pitches.  If we relax the requirement that those pitches \"work\" harmonically and decide not to take the IV and V chords as our principal helper chords, we're not necessarily tied to those seven pitches.  For example, non-Western scales, including Chinese, African, Arabic, even Eastern European scales, don't insist on all of those chords, so their scales are different.  A quick example is the Ahavah Rabbah scale (aka phrygian dominant), on C:\n\nC Db E F G Ab Bb C\n\nIt has a I and a iv, but no V -- the dominant is the bvii or the bII (or especially the bIIb5, Db F G, though that's pretty much vø7).\n\nSo once we relax the harmonic constraint, the concept of a \"key\" needs no longer apply.  You don't have to use a fixed set of 7 notes.  You can make up your own scales, and if you do it fluidly enough, they don't have a chance to be established, so you can change it two bars later.  More importantly, if you have a major tonic chord, there's nothing stopping you from using the melodic progression b6-b7-1.  If you have a minor tonic chord, there's nothing stopping you from using the melodic progression n6-n7-1, which happens to be the melodic minor scale anyway.  There's nothing stopping you from using the *harmonic* progression bVI-bVII-I, either, and that happens to be a pretty one (overused in pop music, but meh).\n\nTo get back to your original progression, I-bVI, the sense of mystery you're getting is probably because those two chords are somewhat far apart and you're not connecting them with other chords, so you're leaping around in the harmonic space without a clear path.  I think the A is clearly home, the tonic, but it doesn't necessarily feel that way.  Don't try to pigeonhole your progression into a \"key\".  You don't need one.  Hell, you don't even need a tonal center.  The chords G and Am will fit well into your progression in a bridge section, for example.  You can go from G to Cm instead, just throwing everything else out the window.  It's all OK; it's all music.  If you give a chord enough time, it'll start to feel a little more like home, and changing chords will feel like more of an adventure.

{"body": "I've been playing Soraka for too long....so I'll share my insight:\n\nI get basic caster runes:  magic pen, flat AP, and CDR.\n\nMy spell order is w e w e q r then max r, w, e, q (you can change this up some depending on how your game is going).\n\nItems:  I get 3 gp5 items (philo, hog, and pick)  My exact build order early game is hp regen, hp pot, philo, cdr boots, hog, pick.  After this it comes down to how you want to play soraka.\n\nI'm a crazy S.O.B.  I will immediately rush a deathcap, then complete my gp5 items (not the lucky pick; I'll buy something useful like aegis).  The purpose of this is to get big heals out as well as nice deeps.  I position myself in such a way that if the enemies commit to killing me, they're going to lose at least 2 in the process if not more (that comes with experience).\nIf you want to go a more durable route, consider a rylai's, frozen heart, and a shurelia's.  You'll be spamming that q and slowing the enemy while soaking up some damage.\nIf you want to run auras, feel free!  Straight support soraka is great!  go for an aegis, shurelia's, abysal scepter, etc.\n\nAlways keep a slot open for wards.  As a support character it's your job to support your team (derp).  This includes giving your team vision of the map and removing enemy vision (oracles).  Ward around baron, dragon, as well as the buffs.\n\nFor summoner spells I take flash and cv.  Positioning is very important for Soraka and flash is 2nd to none.  CV will get you the situational vision you need to succeed.\n\nPlaystyle:  Lane with a damage dealer.  Feed them mana and heals.  HARASS THE ENEMY!  For the love of god, you aren't attacking the creeps so throw some bananas at the enemy why don't you!  Also, situational silences will really mess up enemy casters going to harass your partner and allow for you and your partner to punish such aggression.  I harass with e and autoattacks more than anything (q requires me to get a bit too close for comfort).\n\nIf you are alone in lane, don't overextend.  How do you know if you're overextending?  Ask yourself this:  Can my enemy get in attack range before I can get to my tower?  You can't afford to get cc'd because you are squishy.  Play conservatively and wait for some back up before you get aggressive again.\n\nOnce you get your ult be sure to be watching other lanes with yours.  You can't wait for a ping from your allies to let you know when to ult.  Don't ult if you know it won't help. Save it for team fights if possible.  Use it the same way karthus uses his....except vice versa.\n\nIn team fights, stay in the back, use your w on the guy who gets focused, silence the enemy caster / channeling ult, drop starfall constantly, and ult when everyone gets to about 3/4 hp.  And for the love of god, don't end up in the center of the team fight!\n\nHope this helps out.  I read other guides here and they're great.  Take the best from all of our comments and go win some matches!  good luck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318763627", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think you've answered your own question.  The next step after finding out the key is figuring out the progression.  \n\nThere are many ways of doing this.  I'll share the one that works best for me.  \n\nI start with the first chord.  I let it play, and then I hit pause.  I'll hold that chord in my brain and first figure out the root.  Then play the recording again and pause it once more to solidify the chord.  I'll then start on the root and play a scale until all of the notes fit in with the chord in my head.  For pop music 99% of the time it will be a major, minor, or 7th chord.  Only every once in a while will you find a diminished, sus, or b5 in there.  Then check your work against the recording to make sure you got it right.\n\nRepeat this for the entire progression and write it out as you go.  After a while, you won't need to pause as frequently, or at all.  You can hit each chord as it comes up in the progression, or keep the entire progression in your head as you figure it out.  \n\nThe next step is to get that progression under your hands.  Play scales and arpeggios over the recording for each chord as it comes around.  Again, with time, you'll have to do less and less of this.  Eventually, you'll just be able to look at the chords and know the scales behind them.\n\nFinally, you can construct your bass line!  Let me start by saying when in doubt, you can always play roots and fifths.  You'll never get fired or sound bad.  You might get a little board, but that's a different issue.  The trick to bass lines is shifting your mentality.  Don't think about the chord you are on.  Think about the chord you are trying to get to while keeping in mind the chord you are on.  This is easily demonstrated by learning to walk.\n\nLets take the example of Cmaj7 to Gmaj7 back to Cmaj7:\n\nStart on the root of C, and you'll want to go up to G.  Think to yourself *I have 4 notes to land on G starting from C*  start moving to G, and remember that you're on the C scale.  With this in mind you'll play:\n\nC D E F\n\nThat puts you in a great spot because the next note is G.  It's right when and where you want it.  Now time to go back down.  Again, you're thinking *I have 4 notes to get to C starting on G in the Key of G*  So on the way down it will be:\n\nG F# E D\n\nAgain you're ready for C on the downbeat.  Now you're learning a rock song, so you'll want to walk a little less, and hang out on the root and fifth a little more, so let's apply the same progression to a rock song.  for the sake of simplicity, we'll assume you're playing 1/8 notes.\n\nThe simple way of doing it would be: \n\nC G C C C G C C\n\nG D G G G D G G\n\nC G C C C G C C\n\nIt will sound good, but it will get a little boring.  Let's take what we learned and make it a little more interesting.  Try this instead:\n\nC G C C C D E F\n\nG D G G G F# D B\n\nC G C C C G C F\n\nIt takes a lot of time and practice, but stick with it, and all of this will become second nature.  \n\ngood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318868059", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are a number of different chord shorthand systems used by guitarists but none of them are for remembering the fingerings. There's only five basic chord shapes to know (CAGED), so you have those memorized in the first few weeks usually. From those basic shapes you raise or lower a note to get the different versions like:\n\n           A major: x02220\n           A minor: x02210\n             \n              A 7: x02020\n        A minor 7: x02010\n     \n       A major 7: x02120\n    A diminished: x0101x\n \nSo generally you know that stuff and just need the chord names. The most basic shorthand for the chord names is something you'll see in sing along books and lyric sheets online:\n\nA (nothing after it) = A major\n\nAm = lower case 'm' means minor, so A minor\n\nA7 = A dominant 7\n\nAM7 = uppercase 'M' means major, so A major seventh\n\nAm7 = A minor seventh\n\nAsus4 = A suspended fourth\n\nA aug or A+ = A augmented\n\nA° or Adim or A- = A diminished\n\nI'm probably forgetting a few but you get the idea. So usually you just have one of those shorthand names written down and maybe a position number if you're playing an inversion of it up the neck. Like E (VII) would tell me to play an E chord at the seventh fret instead of the open position.\n\nThe other system is even more abbreviated and is more of the professional lingo. In this system the chord built on each note of the key is given a number. So number the notes of c major:\n\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    C D E F G A B\n \n\nand the chords would be:\n\n    1  2   3   4  5   6   7\n    C  Dm  Em  F  G  Am  Bdim\n\nSo for a basic blues progression the sheet would only say \"C major 1-4-1-5\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318924226", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sound is vibrations.  The range of human hearing is from about 20 vibrations per second (hertz, abbreviated Hz) at the low end, to about 20,000 Hz at the high end.  \n\n\nWhen two strings vibrate at different frequencies they produce interference patterns based on the ratio of the two frequencies to each other.  For example if one string is vibrating at 220 Hz and another is at 440 Hz, the interference pattern would be practically nil.  The two notes are barely distinguishable.  The ratio of the higher pitch frequency to the lower is 2:1, which is the definition of the octave.  In this case, both notes are (American) A.\n\n\nUsing higher ratios like 3:2, and 4:3, etc gives you notes that are closer together than an octave, and as the ratios increase even higher the interference between the two notes becomes more chaotic, and as a result they aren't as pleasing to the ear.   When an instrument is in tune (modern system), all of the notes are at close approximations to even-integer ratios i.e. all the vibrations line up (more or less).  Out of tune means that something is causing an interference pattern that isn't lined up, and is causing all kinds of chaotic overtones (multiples of the vibration sources' frequencies).\n\nIn the modern system, the octave is split into 12 equal parts called half-steps and 2 half-steps is a whole-step.  A diatonic scale is an arrangement of 7 of the 12 possible notes in an octave, set up in half-steps and whole-steps.  In the following H=half-step, W=whole-step:\n\n\nMajor scale:  W W H W W W H\n\n\nNotice that it's seven notes long and it's asymmetrical.  If you start a scale on each of the seven notes you get seven unique sequences of W's and H's.  These are the diatonic modes.  The major scale is the first mode.  The natural minor scale is the sixth mode.  The rest are the exotic names like dorian, lydian, that you've seen.  \n\n\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg.  \n\n\nCheck the links in the side bar!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318935371", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No it doesn't.  I don't think your 'state' and my 'state' are the same.\n\nTo me the weightedness is a property of the coin, but the coin's state is either H or T.  The agent needs to look at successive states in order to calculate the probability (ie H H H T H H T H, etc) which is why it's partially observable.  You need to remember previous states in order to accomplish the task.  But those successive states are still discrete.\n\nThe coin doesn't have a .3H/.7T state.  It's either H or T and the weightedness of the coin only affects how often one state will come up rather than the other, but no matter what there will still be only those two states (H|T).\n\nA light switch that's statistically on 23 hrs a day doesn't have a state of 0.96 on.  It is either on or off.\n\nA d6 has one of 6 states (1,2,3,4,5,6).  It doesn't matter if it's a loaded die.  When I throw the die, it will have one of those 6 states.  It will never come up 7 or 3.2.  It doesn't matter if the die comes up with 1 50% of the time.  It has 6 states.\n\nThe state of the environment changes through Actions.  In the case of the coin, this action is the Flip.  If the current state is H and I flip a coin and get H, then sure, the state remains the same.  But in this case it's just a coincidence that the old and new state are the same.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318939185", "subreddit": "aiclass", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "EVERYTHING. The learning curve to vim is quite steep. That's because you essentially need to learn a mini-programming language on its own just to even USE the editor properly. Textmate, notepad++, and all those have one mode ... text entry mode. Vim has around 7 I believe, the 3 most important being insert mode, normal (movement) mode and command mode.\n\nThe goal of vim is to pretty much make it the fastest editor to get from one thing to another, to accomplish tasks, and NEVER to touch the arrow keys or mouse.\n\nImagine you're editing an html file (for simplicity sake here), and want to copy a div above to a div down below and change a few things (specifically you want to change on div to a span). \n\nPreviously on a standard text-edit type editor... youre going to take your big fat hand, put it on the mouse.. drag it up... highlight and select teh whole top div, likely haveing to select a few different times because you missed a letter in the selection. or youre going to use teh arrow keys like michael j fox... or, youre going to use alt+command+arrow keys to speed up the process a bit but not much.\n\nThen youre going to have to scroll down.. hit paste... the meticulously place the mouse cursor in between a &lt; and the div so you can delete, or meticulously double click 'div' so you can highlight it. Then youre going to need to do the same thing for &lt;/div&gt;\n\nWell in vim to do all of that. And btw I dont have vim open to actually double check this but MORE OR LESS its going to go something to the tune of......\n\nyoure going to muve the cursor around with h j k l until youre on the first line.\n\nTHen you will hit\n\nv a t y l % p /div l cit (cant remember exact hotkey for surround, I dont use it that much, but its something like that for the last step)\n\nSeems confusing, but you can type those letters very fast and they all do a certain function, they can be an object, a motion, a verb, etc. You can combine them to do different functions, for example 'vat' when typed as v-a-t will Visually select Around the Tags... meaning the entire block of html. y copies, it, % moves the cursor to the closing tag, p puts the copied (yanked) text on the line below, etc etc\n\nThere are millions of plugins, and there is literally nothing it cant do. Not to mention it supports macros, and has its own scripting language so you can write your own keybindings. Example being... when I write css after the last attribute in a class instead of hitting down down down enter, then enter again to start a new class, i just hit command+shift+enter to automatically format, tab to the left, move down to the last brace, insert a blank line below, start a new class, open braces, then move cursor back up ready to go... there are millions of other keybindings you can choose to use.\n\nI have been an AVID textmate user for years, and only when i got tired of waiting for textmate 2 i finally forced myself to use vim. (I knew it was poowerful before but it is a huge doozie to learn). Once i learned it (in abot 7 days i was very proficient)... .. i can never use anything ever again. EVER.

[Here is a good introduction to intervals.](http://mlblog.musiclearningworkshop.com/81/learning-music-intervals)\n\n* Next, learn the notes on the fretboard. You should have your fretboard down cold. [Here is a good diagram that shows the notes on a four string bass fretboard.](http://www.cyberfretbass.com/first-fret/note-names/index.php)\n\n* After that, start learning to identify the roots of the chords. (A chord is what a guitar usually plays when not soloing.) DO NOT work by tabs for this, use chord charts at first to help you. [Here is the chord chart for Knocking on Heaven's Door - Bob Dylan.](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/b/bob_dylan/knockin_on_heavens_door_crd.htm)\n\n* At the same time you're learning to identify the root notes of the chords, learn how to construct chords and practice their arpeggios. Simple ones, of course. Minor, Major, 7th chords for now. We'll keep the Jazz chords for later. [Here is a not bad link on how to construct chords.](http://www.pianoclues.com/2008/01/11/how-to-construct-chords/)\n\n* After you can identify the roots and know how to build chords, combine them by identifying the roots of the chords of the song that you want to learn, then the actual chords. \n\nVoila! once you have mastered the above steps, you are now equipped to explore the deep-end and start the real learning journey.\n\nWelcome to the world of bass!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319020513", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Then, convert this matrix into the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminescence) colour space. Take the \"Red\" pixels (+/- 25 based on their H value) and change them into \"Yellow\" (Ie, offset the H value - add a constant). Convert back to RBG and export.

{"body": "Well I'd write that b13 as #5 (same thing), and the F# is not a b9 of an Eb7 chord, it's a #9. So it actually goes 3rd, #5th, root, #9. If you had the 7th, then you'd have a Eb7(#5,#9) which is a very common way to play a V chord in a minor blues/funk song. So you were right to think of altering 5's and 9's :)\n\nI took a listen to the album version (http://grooveshark.com/#/album/The+Next+Step/316327) and the only place I heard close to what you wrote is at 2:27, a super-fast descending line: F D# B F# F B Ab or something. It's too fast to make out the exact notes, and there might be a G in there as you have, but it's so fast that I don't think it even makes any sense to even analyze it as a functional chord.\n\nHowever, I did listen to a live version of them playing the song here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9LlIbmfpGQ\n\n...and I noticed that the guitar &amp; piano are playing their Ebm chords or patterns and then usually just move their pattern up a half-step (to Em) for the approach chord, with the bass usually playing an A natural at this point (sometimes an E), and the bass just resolving down a half-step to the following Abm chord.  So they lead into the Abm chord with some kind of Am or Em chord. I wouldn't over-analyze this, as it seems very common in jazz to lead into things with half-step moves (e.g. even when just vamping on Ebm, moving from Ebm to Em to Ebm).\n\nBelow are some specific instances from the youtube link that stand out:\n\n0:54\n\n2:11  - let's break out each instrument here (Ebm chord, to approach chord, to Abm chord):\n\n  guitar: Bb-Db-Eb-Gb arpeggios (Ebm7), up 1/2 step to B-D-E-G arpeggios (Em7),  to Abm lick\n\n  piano: block chords: Eb-F-Gb-Bb (Ebm add9), up 1/2 step to E-F#-G-B (Em add9), to Abm9\n\n  bass:  walking around on Ebm pattern, to an Am pattern (notes: A, E, Eb, E) to Ab\n\n  So the approach chord could be interpreted as an Am7 (with 9,11,#13), or as just an Em7 chord, though the bass seems to be hinting at an A root.\n\n2:49\n\n3:24 - lets break this one out too:\n\n  guitar solo: holding Gb (from Ebm chord), to descending scale (F E D C B A G F E D C B down to Eb), up to Ab for Abm chord (notice last 3 notes B-Eb-Ab make the Abm chord). \n\n  piano: At approach chord, seems to pound out B major triads (why does that work so well?)\n\n  bass: on A for the whole approach chord\n\n So bass on A note + piano on B major + guitar soloing on basically an Am scale = Am7 (with 9,#11,#13 from piano)\n\n4:03, can't make out the piano approach chord exactly, but it's some sort of altered Eb chord like what you identified (e.g. piano/guitar are hitting notes like F# G Bb B Eb), with the bass on E this time (just moving up half-step from previous Ebm chord).\n\n4:40 same thing as 4:03, with bass soloing.\n\n**tl;dr:** In the live version they seem to use an \"up-a-1/2-step\" approach chord, which depending on how they play it and how you interpret it, can be an Am chord (up 1/2 step from the following Abm chord), or an Em chord (up 1/2 step from the preceding Ebm chord).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319268171", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

But the interesting part is when it comes to diseases that can be fought through the immune system.  This goes back to the MHC complex I mentioned earlier.  There have been a lot of studies that have shown that people are attracted to those that have different MHC complexes.  This is due to different pheremones that are emitted due to the MHC complex.\n\nLet's say Male A is immune to disease A B F and G, Female B is immune to A D E and F.  Chemically, those two would be attracted to each other because of the genetic variation.  Their offspring would have the potential to be immune to A B D E F and G.\n\nThat being said, there would also be less odds of the offspring inheriting a genetic related disease such as Lupus compared to the offspring of two black individuals.  There would be an increase compared to two white individuals.\n\nThe clear cut white and black lines become gray now that we have destroyed the barriers that used to exhist.  That white-skinned guy that had a great great grandfather that was black carries genetic traits of both races.  Can you clearly designate a race for that?

{"body": "Alright then,\n\nFirst I'll speak about the limitations of DNA, while I still recognize all that we have put forth in this discourse. It is touted as a stable genetic molecule because of its ability to form a double helix, that is two complementary strands. In this way the genetic information is \"backed up\" and more resistant to single strand breaks (SSB). This double helix structure is stable up until ~95 degrees Celsius. Also, below freezing temperatures DNA is much more subject to Double Strand Breaks (DSB) due to stress. Dimethylsulfoxide can stabilize it down to very low temperatures, but is deadly for most organisms at living temperatures. Extremeophiles have evolved mechanisms to stabilize it at ranges higher lower than this but we are compelled to assume that this is after the intitial emergence of DNA (or at least a double helix nucleic acid). That seems to be a relatively small niche of temperature compared to the various ranges that exist on the planets we know of. In addition to this is the required balance of elements (S P O N C H Ca K and more) to generate organic molecules that eventually organize inside proto-cells... you know all that [fuzzy stuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis) that is at the border of chemistry and biology.\n\nNow lets get parsimonious. \"Space... is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space, listen...\" there are quite a few planets discovered that are similar to earth, but there are also a lot more planets that are dissimilar. Does it seem more reasonable to have all the same improbable and singular events that led to DNA as the hereditary molecule or do you think that perhaps it is more probable that there are indeed other types of Goldilocks Zones for other other stable molecular conformations? There is [evidence](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110915091625.htm) of the *possibility* of inorganic life by some research groups. There are many planets where many improbable and singular events are happening and have been happening for billions of years. It simply seems lazy to assume that there life can't come in different flavors.\n\nThose are my conjectures on this subject. I would love to hear some contributions, thoughts, whatever your canine-like passions would like to add, anything but your wrath!\n\n**Edit**: *That quote is from Douglas Adam's *Hitchhiker's* *Guide* *to* *the* *Galaxy", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319543424", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

OH WAIT is that where Aradia transportalized them after Jack sliced up the big house icon or w/e?\n\nYep, they are still at the ectobiology lab where Aradia transportalized them.

{"body": "Yup. This is an elegant and concise answer.\n\nI'd like to go a bit further into the \"straight-up caper\" part though. Note: This is more of an ELIfifteen, rather than ELI5.\n\nThe movie, as Hapax said, bases itself off of the hypothetical scenario that you can have dreams while you're dreaming. And as Hollywood likes to do, as with most humans do when imagining their own scenarios, they take the liberty of inventing and justifying the rules and laws governing the dream world.\n\nThe movie can pretty much make up their own \"dream laws,\" seeing as how most modern science (to my limited knowledge) doesn't do much research into defining \"dream laws.\" The movie (somewhat logically, kind of) claims that the only way to truly wake yourself up from a very realistic dream is to die in the dream (think of how you always wake up before you smash onto the pavement after falling off that building).\n\nThe movie invents its own near-future technology based off of injected chemicals and machinery that allows you to go into *other* people's dreams, and their dreams within dreams, and one of the two ways to get out is to die. The other method is having someone in the \"real world\" wake you up. I put \"real world\" in quotes, because this also applies to the dream level above the one you're in. So if you're dreaming regularly, in Dream Level 1, someone in Real world can wake you up. If you're dreaming within a dream, in Dream level 2, someone in Dream level 1 can wake you up. If you're in DL 3, then someone in DL 2 can wake you up, and so forth.\n\nThis basically evolves into a full movie of people inside dreams within dreams shooting each other to kick each other out of dream levels. While people go around (rather nonsensically) shooting fucking everything in sight, there's people in higher dream levels splashing water on their friend's faces to wake them up. There are more \"dream laws\" the movie takes liberty in defining, such as what happens if you're woken up in dream levels that are multiple tiers higher than the one immediately above yours.\n\nIf you're lost at this point or are thinking it's bullshit, don't worry. It mostly is. The movie was widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of the year by most of my close friends, with a mysterious ending. I don't necessarily disagree; compared to a lot of the garbage in theaters (think Transformers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Shrek 15) it wasn't so bad. My personal opinion is that it's kind of overrated, but it really was still good cinema.\n\nThe constant **I N C E P T I O N** meme you see is people referencing when something goes multiple levels deep, such as a photo of a photo of a photo. Think of Xzibit saying \"So i herd you like museums so we built a museum full of museums so you can visit museums while museum-ing your museum, museum.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319646361", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

She has no sustain vs his two potions (she can't autoattack creeps for lifesteal or else she'll push the lane too hard). Ryze Q at level 1 should be hitting for, what, 120ish? Caitlyn loses a straight exchange unless she lands the Q as well, which is hard. By level 2, Ryze has added another 100 damage to his burst, and now he immobilizes Caitlyn, too. Level 3, another 50ish damage to his burst. By now, Caitlyn has 700hp max and Ryze is doing almost 300 damage per spell rotation, not even counting if he can get a second Q off which isn't hard.\n\nFights between Caitlyn and Ryze go, roughly, like this: Caitlyn autoattacks as Ryze runs forward. Ryze Q &gt; W's Caitlyn as she starts to back off, keeps moving up. Autoattacks, keeps moving forward. Jukes the Caitlyn Q while caitlyn keeps autoattacking. About now, Ryze gets a second Q off, while caitlyn either flashes away or else uses her net. Either way, Caitlyn has taken about 400 damage and Ryze has probably taken half that. Now, Ryze drinks a health potion and is fine. Caitlyn has no potion to drink.\n\nShe's forced back early, at level 3. Comes back with boots, only Ryze could also b and get boots, so nothing changes. By the time we hit 7ish, Caitlyn has another couple Doran's, but Ryze has Catalyst now which means he's got nearly unlimited regen in lane and is nearly impossible to push out, while he can freely spend mana bursting down Caitlyn. By level 7, w/ ult and cata, his Q W R E Q combo should do about, what, 600-700 out of Caitlyn's 1000 hp? And he has his full combo up every, what, 35 seconds?\n\nThe problem with running an AD carry mid is that the more health they build, the more dorans items they stack, the longer they're delaying the brutal IE/PD combo that makes them such a beast. They don't want to go mid because they have to focus on fighting the mid, instead of freefarming and letting their support control the lane FOR them so that they can just last hit.\n\nMy side doesn't need credibility because your side doesn't understand the meta or the theory behind why champions go certain lanes or how champions counter other champions. Your first statement was that Ryze was hard countered by Caitlyn which is ludicrous.

They continued, side-by-side.\n\n\"I...I think my mane is still pretty, don't you?\" Fluttershy asked.\n\n\"Sure. Whatever,\" Dash said blandly.\n\nFluttershy looked at her hooves as she walked, then back at Dash.\n\n\"I think I did a good job brushing it, don't you?\"\n\n\"Eh.\" Dash shrugged.\n\n\"You aren't even looking at it. C'mon, look. Isn't it...what's the word you use...cooler? Like 20% cooler than it used to be? Please? I worked really hard on it.\"\n\nDash looked, and raised an eyebrow. A mischievous smile crept across her face. \"Nahhh...\"\n\nFluttershy's eyes were wider than Dash had ever seen. Tears welled in them. Her ears were pinned back. Before Dash could say anything, Fluttershy had turned, and was running in the other direction. Running. Away. Running. Towards the edge of the cloud. Dash tried to shout. Nothing came out. To the edge. Over the edge. Suddenly, Fluttershy was gone.\n\nDash's shocked paralysis suddenly evaporated. She screamed, and took off, flying. *C'mon let her fly let her fly let her fly I know you're scared Fluttershy fly please fly extend your wings fly* She whipped around the corner of the cloud. She saw nothing. She dived, down, as fast as she could fall. She strained against the air. She knew she wasn't at her fastest. She had done it before, that thing with the rainbow. She knew she had to do it again. But try as she might, as hard a she flapped her wings, she couldn't do it.\n\nShe scanned the ground frantically as she made her approach. Below, a skinny yellow pony lay on the ground near a patch of trees. Dash landed. *Oh please be alive c'mon Fluttershy you used your wings you had to you have to be alive*.\n\nShe walked up to Fluttershy and nudged her with her nose. No response. She grabbed her shoulder and flipped her over, onto her back. The shoulder didn't even feel connected to the rest of her body. The yellow filly's body was contorted; her face obviously shattered. But there was no response. Dash nudged her again. And again. She started babbling, begging her to say something, to say anything, to move anything. There was nothing. She wasn't breathing. She wasn't moving. Dash looked around helplessly. There was nopony nearby. There was nothing but grass and trees and a few butterflies. Dash bit her lip, and grabbed Fluttershy with both hooves. She shook her, violently, yelling at her, begging her to move. Nothing. No response. She remembered something she had learned once in school. She put her head to Fluttershy's chest and listened for a heartbeat. Nothing. She could feel broken ribs giving way beneath her chest.\n\nShe was crying by now. Crying in desperation. She was dead. She was dead and there was nothing she could do.\n\nDash kept babbling at her. \"Oh God Fluttershy oh God oh God why why didn't you fly oh God oh God I'm so sorry I'm so sorry oh God please God oh God please Fluttershy please oh I'm sorry you're really pretty I always thought you were pretty and I was just about to say it I didn't mean you weren't cool I I I I WAS GOING TO SAY YOU WERE 40% COOLER I WAS YOU'RE COOL I'M SORRY I'M SORRY\"\n\nShe lay down next to her, crying and apologizing to her friend's corpse.

We would expect there to be a 1-1 correspondence between probabilities and nodes in the network, as in previous examples, but in this case there are not.\n\nIn this case, you create a new BN for every message; the root node is of course always SPAM/HAM, and there is one leaf node for each word in the message. So if the message is \"A C A\", you get a BN like this:\n\n       SPAM\n      /  |  \\\n     A   C   A\n\nThen:\n    P(\"A C A\" | SPAM) = P(SPAM) P(A|SPAM) P(B|SPAM) P(C|SPAM)  {from the network structure}\n\nWe assume all words are independent (which is not a very good assumption; in reality, there are lots of word pairs that have higher probability of co-occurring, but we ignore this).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319724808", "subreddit": "aiclass", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's helpful for finding the key signatures. You start at the top with C major, which has no sharps (#)/flats (b) in the key (so a C major scale has the notes C D E F G A B). As you go clockwise, you start adding sharps, and as you go counter clockwise, you start adding flats.\n\nThere is a specific order for sharps and flats:\n\nSharps: F C G D A E B (**F**ather **C**harles **G**oes **D**own **A**nd **E**nds **B**attle)\n\nFlats: B E A D G C F (**B**attle **E**nds **A**nd **D**own **G**oes **C**harles' **F**ather)\n\nSo if you wanted to know the notes for E major, you'd start at C and go to E. Since it's the fourth note going clockwise from C, you take the first four letters from the order of sharps, F C G D. \n\nSo now, you just list all 7 of the musical letters starting from your key: E F G A B C D\n\nNow, you add a sharp to each of those four letters I mentioned earlier: E **F#** **G#** A B **C#** **D#**\n\nAnd that's the E major scale. \n\nThe notes on the inside are the relative minor scales. So notice how C# minor is below E. That means that the C# minor scale and the E major scale share the same notes. \n\nIf you're the kind of guitarist that can only solo using the pentatonic box, this also means that if someone tells you the song is in E major, you can solo using the C# minor pentatonic scale and you'll be in key.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319747158", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Italktowind covered the basics. \n\nI'll add: The circle of fifths is very useful for modulation (changing key). say you're playing in C major. The major scale a fifth up, G major, is only different by one note, i.e. F# instead of F natural. Also the major scale a fifth down, F major, is only different from C major by one note, i.e a B flat instead of a B natural.\n\nlet's review:\n\nC major; A B C D E F G\n\nG major: A B C D E F# G\n\nF major: A Bb C D E F G\n\nThese are clearly very similar scales, and because of this it's easy to switch from C major to F major or G major. This helps vary the sound of a piece, and make it less repetitive. \n\nThis works for minor scales too, so from C minor you can modulate to G minor, or F minor easily. \n\nThe other most common modulations are modulating from major to relative minor and vice versa (example: C major to A minor), and modulating from Major to to parallel minor and vice versa (example: C major to C minor). If you think about it the melodic minor and harmonic minor scale are simply hybrids of the major &amp; natural minor scale. \n\nAnyways you can modulate to any key, but these modulations are a good starting point.

{"body": "I wanted to come in and say learn your major and minor triads.\nwith your C major scale: CDEFGAB CDEFGAB C, take your root note (1) then 2 notes up the scale (3rd) then a further 2 notes up (5th)\n\nThe third determines if the chord is Major or Minor. A Major is 4 semitones (1 semitone=1 fret) higher, a Minor is 3 semitones higher.\n\nMoving between chords, one of the strongest techniques is the chromatic approach. That means the note before a new chord is one semitone above or below. e.g, moving from C to G, you could use an F# just before the G. Or you could extend this into a run- C   E(the 3rd) F F# G\n\nFinally, sequences are good. if you have a little lick that you like in the key of C major that fits over (e.g) a Cmajor chord and your bass lick goes C B C G E G, you can look at the notes as intervals in the scale - 1 7 1 5 3 5. If your next chord is an A minor, your 1 7 1 5 3 5 lick becomes A G A E C E. This can be a strong technique for the foundation of a bassline. Once you've done that, get creative! \n\nI hope this makes some sense!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319790323", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Modes are nothing more than different scales, just like the major and minor scales, that can be used at various times. Each mode or scale has a different mix of half steps and whole steps, which changes the feel of the music. It's up to the musician to know when each mode might sound good over which chord changes.\n\nAs far as how they are different, let's use compare A minor and A dorian. The A Minor scale is the same as C Major. Starting with A you have A B C D E F G A. One important thing to note is that the interval between the first A and the F is called a minor 6th. The Dorian mode is the same scale except it has a major 6th: A B C D E F# G A. Here's a video showing a cool sounding guitar jam in the Dorian mode. Interestingly, it also uses a Lydian mode (augmented 4th instead of a perfect 4th) when the backing track is on one of the major chords. It's a very cool tone.\n\n\nAs another example, let's compare G Major with G Mixolydian. The G Major scale is G A B C D E F# G. Notice that the interval between the first G and the F# is a major seventh. The Mixolydian mode has a minor seventh in that interval, so the scale would be G A B C D E F G. Here is a cool jazz fusion jam using the Mixolydian scale (over the head of a five year old, I'm sure.) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiZOa7Nxwgo&amp;feature=related\n\nAnd yet another example. Let's compare E Minor with E Phrygian. E Minor is E F# G A B C D E. Note that the interval between the first E and the F# is a major 2nd, or a whole step. The Phrygian mode has a minor second here, a half step: E F G A B C D E. It still has a minor sound, but it has an exotic vibe to it. Here's some good stuff using the Phrygian mode: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgpLzDX_ZFU\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319870535", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So memory works at a few levels.\n\nWhen a sound comes into you brain, it is converted into electricity. Most of your brain cells cannot 'hear' but they can 'understand' electricity. This electricity is then processed by your brain. Sounds that occur together activate cells together. The electrical linking between these two cells becomes stronger in a permanent way. (Cells that fire together wire together). So now when you hear A B C D the cells for E F G begin activating. (You don't actually have letter cells, this is a simplification). So to recognize something, all it has to do is activate some cells which activate other cells. This is very simple.\n\nRecalling (Remembering) something is much harder. To recall something, the firing patterns of those cells have to be linked to other facts in the brain. (Usually by thinking about it, interacting with it, or sleeping on it.) For example you might know what the contents of a series of drawers look like. If someone put a red pen in a drawer, you'd know it had changed. This would be recognizing. If they asked to you which drawer a tool that could help you make a 3in circle was in, you would have to 'recall' the exact nature and use of the objects in the drawers. If you'd just glanced at the drawer you would not do well at recalling. If it was a  bunch of drawers you'd spent a few hours with, or that you used everyday, you'd be able to tell them. (Teachers usually try to get students to recall information, eg make students remember why certain facts are true. Students prefer recognition memory as it is MUCH easier. As a study tip, to switch one type to the other focus on what a fact means to you, your body, or to the universe.) You can think of recall as the number of strings tied to a memory. If the memory has a lot of strings, pulling on it will move a lot of things and you will know a lot about it. If it has one string, it will only move the nearby simple links and you might only recognize it.\n\nSo when talking about a song, it's easy to recognize a song as it only takes knowing a pattern has occurred. However, to recall details about the song, it has to be tied to your word processing centers in the brain and into broader parts. Also if you haven't thought about a song for a long time, the recall memory won't be gone, but it might be obscured by other memories that have linked to the beats of the song or to the name of the song. \n\nI can explain anything in more detail if you'd like.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319994422", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "EDIT: This is a good book for learning to read music and basic fingerpicking/ sight reading \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Solo-Guitar-Playing-Book-Classical/dp/0825694000\n\n\n\n\nOk I'm stoned and a giving person so I will impart to you the knowledge of basic theory.  Read this comment carefully and you will learn everything you need to know to learn the guitar.   Ok, you have a six stringed instrument, in E standard that means you should have the notes starting from the lowest (thickest) string: E A D G B E.  Each fret on the guitar is a semi-tone or a half-step.  A step is an interval, the distance between two tones.  There are names for these intervals, half steps (1 fret) and whole steps (2 frets).  The major scale is how you will learn this.  A scale is just a pattern of intervals.  If you pick a note, E in this case to build its major scale without thinking about notes just use this formula WWHWWWH (whole, half).  You can do this for any note on the guitar, it's easy to see the pattern using the notes on the open strings.  Master this.  There's a lot to cover, but I promise I can explain it faster and more coherently than any book I've read, I had a great teacher lay this out for me in an hour. \n \nOnce you have become familiar with the sound of the major scale (do re mi fa so la ti do) it's time to name the intervals of the notes you're playing.    Play the first then second note of the major scale.  That interval is a major second. Play the root, or first note of the major scale and the third note in the scale and this interval is called a major third.  The third is a key note, this is special but I will explain why later.  The fourth and fifth notes are called perfect fourths and fifths. The sixth is minor, major seventh and the octave.  So why do these intervals have these names?  Play them and hear the way they sound...they have a specific number of steps in regards to the root, this is true for all keys.  Ok mull that over but here's the cool part.  If you take the third note of the major scale and play it a half-step lower you will make a minor third.  Do you know the open A major chord and the open A minor cord?  See if you can find the third and hear how it sounds when you play those two chords...notice that the fifth is the other interval played in those two chords.  A chord is constructed from the first third and fifth notes of a scale. (and a seventh sometimes, but we'll talk about that later).  This applies to all scales, so let's go back to that major scale.  Let's use C for this example.  What if I were to play the notes that are in the C major scale, but instead of starting and ending on C, I start and end on the second note D?  Well I've created a different pattern of intervals.  The major scale is WWHWWWH remember? This new scale is WHWWWHW and now the third interval of this scale is minor, making it a minor scale.  For any major scale, I can do this using any of the 7 other notes in the scale, each with its own pattern of intervals.  These scales are what are referred to as the \"modes\" of the major scale.  Guitar books teach this concept retardedly. \n \nLet's construct the third mode of the E major scale, so you can see it on the open string.  The pattern is HWWWHWW, this mode has a name it's called phrygian.  You can hear it sounds dark and spanish.  Every mode has a name, the major scale is the Ionian mode, the next is a minor mode Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian.  memorize them gradually, but more importantly work out the steps of each scale and play them on the guitar.  If I take the first third and fifth notes of each mode of a major scale, I will have each chord that belongs in that key.  You can play the seventh note on every chord if you want to, you can experiment adding the 4th, 10th (the major second and octave higher) and other intervals into your chords later.  Chords are thrown together in progressions, we label them in roman numerals and they are repeated often.  The l chord is the major root the ll is minor the lll is minor the lV is major the lV is major the Vl is minor the Vll is odd as you may have discovered, it has a major third and a flat fifth.  This is called a \"half\" diminished chord.  A whole diminished chord would be a chord with a minor third and double flatted fifth.  (flatting is lowering a note semi-tone, sharp is a semitone above the note)  There you go. ask me questions I'll answer I can probably make videos.  I can get you going on the guitar.
