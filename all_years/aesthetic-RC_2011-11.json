{"body": "No it wouldn't be. Nobody starts learning music by reading theory. I, and most other musicians learned when our parents bought us an instrument when we were young, or we cashed in our first paycheck to buy a guitar to pick up chicks, or we felt like learning music would be good, so we bought an instrument. A cheap acoustic guitar can run you 100-200 dollars, and if you look around for used instruments (which can be better if you ask me) you can save a lot of money. Honestly, I didn't know what a chord or note was either until I had been playing guitar for a month or two and my parents made me look up lessons online.\n\nAny questions you have before you start can be answered by myself or one of the many other talented folks here, but I don't think the best way to learn music is to sit down with a text book or recording program and figure it out. That's not fun and won't facilitate your learning. I can give you a quick rundown though.\n\nA note is a single tone. Whenever someone presses one key on a piano or plucks one guitar string, that's a note. A lot of the time, when you hear a riff or melody, that's made of notes. So for example, the classic line from Sweet Child of Mine is made of a collection of notes. Notes go in alphabetical order, starting with A and ending with G before repeating, usually with C as the starting point (I know, it sounds weird, but it's intuitive). Sometimes you hear a term such as sharp or flat, which simply means to make a note slightly higher or lower, respectively. Not all notes have the same distance between them. For example, B and C are right next to each other, but C and D are seperated by a note. This note can be called C# or Db (c-sharp or d-flat). It might sound confusing at first, but when you get to the inner workings of how music is made, it makes a lot of sense.\n\nA chord is a set of notes played all at the same time that sound good together. These are how most songs are played. When you hear those stereotypically crunchy rock and roll kind of guitar strums, those are chords. The chorus to Smells Like Teen Spirit is a good example. Or if you listen to folk music, basically any acoustic guitar part will be chords. Any instrument that can make more than one note at once can play a chord. Alternatively, a chord can be made by multiple instruments playing together. \n\nA scale is a group of one of each note in ascending or descending order, made to sound a certain way. The most simple scale is C Major, which is just every note with no sharp or flat. C D E F G A B C. Other scales have sharps and flats in them, and have unique feels to them. The Major scale sounds happy, Minor sounds sad, Melodic has a certain foreign sound, etc. \n\n\nMind you, I didn't learn any of these terms until after I had picked up a guitar for the first time. It's much easier to grasp these concepts with an instrument in hand. If you have any other terms or concepts you'd like explained, go right ahead and ask, but your best bet is to go buy a guitar or keyboard and google \"free guitar lessons\" or \"free piano lessons\". A lot of this is going to sound absolutely absurd because you don't have an instrument in your hands to help illustrate it, so that's step one for you. Go buy an instrument tomorrow.

Hard to respond or follow you if you dont click reply under my comments. \n\nFirst off you are woefully ignorant to all the criticisms I raised. Its apparent you have no interest or just don't want to spend any time doing some real research about your own religion. Second, I use to be Mormon, served a mission and baptized plenty of people into the good ole church. I am more than qualified to understand your objections, your reasoning and your hesitation I was once in your shoes, you however, have never been in mine.\n\nJoseph Smith didn't write the book in 65 days, thats a half truth. Yes the book was literally written over that short span, but years before he even started writing it he told stories about the lamanites and nephites which are the principal peoples of the book. For anyone that doesn't believe in Joseph's prophetic calling that's unquestionable proof that he had ideas and thoughts formulating Y E A R S before the book was written. \n\nI will make this very simple for you. The Book of Mormon contains plagerism ONLY found in the Kings James Version of the Bible and later found to be A BAD TRANSLATION. So a book that claims to be the most correct of any on earth, contains errors made by those who put the KJV together. There is also material in the book that would literally have been IMPOSSIBLE for Nephi or any author of the Book of Mormon ( besides Joseph Smith ) to have included. Portions of Isaiah including in the Book of Mormon Were written A F T E R Lehi and family crossed the ocean and arrived in america. Unless the Book of Mormon talks about Nephi being able to travel through time and across great spans of distance...the only conclusion that can be made is that Joseph Smith copied that part directly from the Bible.  And before you start formulating other possibilities ill shut it down by informing you that there is NO dispute about deutero-Isaiah between any biblical scholar worth their salt.  \n\nI mean this as no insult, but you have a some seriously misinformed ideas.

Hopefully, you will never need to tap the funds in (d).\n\nIf you tap the funds in (a), (b) or (c) - you should replenish the funds in (a), (b) and (c) before putting any more money in (d).\n\nIf you tap the funds in (b) you should only have to forfeit the \"interest\" earned so far on the CD.  Be sure to confirm what the \"early withdrawal penalty\" is when you open the CD.  Forfeiting the interest on a one-year CD will not be too bad since interest rates are less than 1% now.  (Purchase multiple $10,000 CDs over time so you forfeit as little interest as possible if you redeem one.)\n\nNote:  If you anticipate needing money for a new car or home improvement, just build up your (a) account instead of continuing to put money in your (d) account.\n\nRealize that (d) will go up and down with the stock market over time (just like your IRA and 401K accounts) - so don't get spooked and sell it when the stock market drops 20% - it will bounce back if you just leave it alone.  This (d) account is for your long term goals - like the kid's college funds and/or retirement. \n\nThis is a good long-term financial plan that will serve you well until you retire. \n\nIf you want to learn about (c) and (d), just google the following:\n\"target date retirement funds\"\n\n\"VTINX\"  (that's the letters  V T I N X  all together)\n\n\"VTIVX\"  (that's the letters  V T I V X  all together)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1320269414", "subreddit": "Frugal", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Publicly. Very bad decision already. But then, it was just comical. Merkel has fire up her ass now, but it took her F O R E V E R to decide whether Germany wanted to help, how much, when, how, etc. All of this because, of course, there were regional election in Germany and god save us from acting responsibly when elections knock at the door. The superb result of this waiting: she lost the elections in many regions anyway AND the Greek situation went from very bad to desperate overnight.\n\nAnd what about this joke about Greek being pushed into draconian cuts left and right, but still having to buy foreigner military airplanes as one of the little known conditions to grant the money? Gee! I think they didn't fight any single war that wasn't all about ambushes since the war of Troy, so I am sure those military planes will save the day repeatedly while the services are cut and the taxes are raised.\n\nLet's face it. It was (because, with a supreme display of democracy, it looks like the other European countries have \"convinced\" the Greeks not to have the referendum) a public vote on the union, on the euro as it is, and on the fiscal philosophy that has informed European decisions so far. But evidently that was too much democracy.\n\nLike when they wrote a shitty European constitution, and after the first two failed referendum (was it France and Ireland, if I recall well?) and they decided that that didn't mean that the constitution needed re-writing and that MORE talks were needed. No! It's because people are not ready.

{"body": "I'll repost something I left in another post, there might be some redundant info, but it's good to think of theory in this way.  You say you have basic theory knowledge, I suspect that means fundamental knowledge, this is basic theory:\n  \nOk, you have a six stringed instrument, in E standard that means you should have the notes starting from the lowest (thickest) string: E A D G B E. Each fret on the guitar is a semi-tone or a half-step. A step is an interval, the distance between two tones. There are names for these intervals, half steps (1 fret) and whole steps (2 frets). The major scale is how you will learn this. A scale is just a pattern of intervals. If you pick a note, E in this case to build its major scale without thinking about notes just use this formula WWHWWWH (whole, half). You can do this for any note on the guitar, it's easy to see the pattern using the notes on the open strings. Master this. There's a lot to cover, but I promise I can explain it faster and more coherently than any book I've read, I had a great teacher lay this out for me in an hour.\n\nOnce you have become familiar with the sound of the major scale (do re mi fa so la ti do) it's time to name the intervals of the notes you're playing. Play the first then second note of the major scale. That interval is a major second. Play the root, or first note of the major scale and the third note in the scale and this interval is called a major third. The third is a key note, this is special but I will explain why later. The fourth and fifth notes are called perfect fourths and fifths. The sixth is minor, major seventh and the octave. So why do these intervals have these names? Play them and hear the way they sound...they have a specific number of steps in regards to the root, this is true for all keys. Ok mull that over but here's the cool part. If you take the third note of the major scale and play it a half-step lower you will make a minor third. Do you know the open A major chord and the open A minor cord? See if you can find the third and hear how it sounds when you play those two chords...notice that the fifth is the other interval played in those two chords. A chord is constructed from the first third and fifth notes of a scale. (and a seventh sometimes, but we'll talk about that later). This applies to all scales, so let's go back to that major scale. Let's use C for this example. What if I were to play the notes that are in the C major scale, but instead of starting and ending on C, I start and end on the second note D? Well I've created a different pattern of intervals. The major scale is WWHWWWH remember? This new scale is WHWWWHW and now the third interval of this scale is minor, making it a minor scale. For any major scale, I can do this using any of the 7 other notes in the scale, each with its own pattern of intervals. These scales are what are referred to as the \"modes\" of the major scale. Guitar books teach this concept retardedly.\n\nLet's construct the third mode of the E major scale, so you can see it on the open string. The pattern is HWWWHWW, this mode has a name it's called phrygian. You can hear it sounds dark and spanish. Every mode has a name, the major scale is the Ionian mode, the next is a minor mode Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian. memorize them gradually, but more importantly work out the steps of each scale and play them on the guitar. If I take the first third and fifth notes of each mode of a major scale, I will have each chord that belongs in that key. You can play the seventh note on every chord if you want to, you can experiment adding the 4th, 10th (the major second and octave higher) and other intervals into your chords later. Chords are thrown together in progressions, we label them in roman numerals and they are repeated often. The l chord is the major root the ll is minor the lll is minor the lV is major the lV is major the Vl is minor the Vll is odd as you may have discovered, it has a major third and a flat fifth. This is called a \"half\" diminished chord. A whole diminished chord would be a chord with a minor third and double flatted fifth. (flatting is lowering a note semi-tone, sharp is a semitone above the note) There you go. ask me questions I'll answer ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1320512846", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Here's what I mean:\n\n    G x\n    D 0\n    A 2\n    E 3\n\nThis is a perfectly valid chord, that's going to sound like \"mush\" on a bass guitar.

It's there to richen the sound, but if you leave it out, it won't change the fact that you have a major G chord there.  Like poo_scradly said, you can move that fingering (E string fretted, then G string the next fret up for a major 3rd + one octave interval) to any fret on the neck, for an easy instant major 3rd.  Move the G string fingering down one fret (so both E and G would be, say, on the 10th fret) and you have a minor 3rd plus one octave.

I skimmed through the FAQ and decided to make a myfitnesspal account (they had an android app which makes my life easier). I'm going to start counting calories. \n\nA little more background + info: My BMI is 28 so I'm pretty close to being obese and that scares me. I always knew I was kind of overweight but going into a new school and seeing that I'm one of the fattest 10 people / 180 people is very shameful for me, so I'm taking this diet change and exercise program very seriously. \n\nAs for my exercise, on M W F I get on the treadmill for 30 minutes, where I jog at the 8 setting (don't know if that means anything) for twenty minutes then take a 5 minute walking break (at 5.5) and then Jog for another final 5 minutes at 8.5. I burn ~160-180 calories according to the electronic read out. I follow this with 30 minutes of weight lifting, working out pecs, biceps, triceps, lats, and legs. On Tuesday and Thursday I jog on the treadmill for 45-50 minutes only. \n\nAs for food, my major complaint is lack of time, but the more I think about it, the more I see it as an excuse. I'm planning to buy a George foreman like grill and start grilling my own chicken breasts / beef etc. I regularly eat cereal/PBJ sandwiches/Cream Cheese Sandwiches when I'm lazy. As for snacks, I've cut them off completely (since about 2 weeks ago). I don't drink Sodas, but I do drink milk and juice. I don't drink coffee, and I do drink 2-3 beers a week. \n\nIf you have any more questions please ask.\nAnd thanks for the support.

{"body": "I'm going to assume the grate is an s x s square, and that the center of the acorn is uniformly distributed over the grate.  Assume the grate is chopped horizontally into rectangles that are alternately covered or uncovered, and that there are n of each kind (so that each rectangular cover is s by s/(2n) ).  The case n=1 is the one where all the cover is pushed to one side, and as n gets big it will become impossible to fit an acorn through the finer and finer grate.  I'll assume the acorn is a sphere with diameter d.  Let w=s/2n be the width of each rectangle.\n\nFor the acorn to go through a w x s uncovered section, the center has to be above a (w-d) x (s-d) subrectangle in the middle.  (If d &gt; w, the grate is too fine and it is impossible, so ignoring that for now).  Thus the probability of going in any uncovered section is (w-d)(s-d)/s^2 .  For simplicity, I'm going to assume that the length of the grate is much larger than the acorn, so that s &gt;&gt; d, and just assume that s - d = s .  So this becomes (w-d)/s .  There are n grates, so the overall probability of going through one of the n grates is n(w-d)/s, or substituting in for w you get n(s/2n - d)/s or 1/2 - nd/s .  \n\nSo the probability for the 50/50 split is around 1/2 - d/s (which is right around 1/2 if the acorn is much smaller than the grate), and it gets smaller and smaller as you increase n, the number of pieces you cut the grate into.  Eventually, nd/s exceeds 1/2 and it becomes impossible when the grating is too fine.\n\nIntuitively speaking, every covered piece comes with a buffer area on each side that the acorn cannot fall through, and this area does not depend on the number of covered areas you've cut the grate into (they're all the width of the acorn).  So as you have more and more covered areas, you have more and more of these buffers, and eventually they add up to cover the whole grate so the acorn cannot get through.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1320903212", "subreddit": "math", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK I see your point about the need to retain order for addition and subtraction. I wasn't thinking about that. The part that really gets me though is the second part, because the Wikipedia entry on ordered pairs doesn't say anything about addition/subtraction; that was part of this formula, not the definition of ordered pairs itself. It just says a nested tuple is equal to a flat tuple.\n\nSo I can see the *need* to retain order for this, but if the function were defined as this:\n\n&gt;  MULT : R X R -&gt; R\n\nThen the output would be MULT(a, b) and order would not be important.\n\nI just don't really see what is inherent in a Cartesian product operation that forces it to result in a flat tuple vs nested tuples.\n\nBut then again, like I said that is my programming background speaking, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nThanks for taking a stab at it anyway. I may bring this up again sometime if I stumble over another problem like this.\n\n**EDIT** I think I just realized why R X R creates a set of ordered pairs. I was flipping through the \"look inside\" of [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Transition-Advanced-Mathematics-Douglas-Smith/dp/0495562025#reader_0495562025) at Amazon and came across a fact I had failed to recall when looking at the function notation: R X R is the establishment of a 2-space Cartesian plane of the reals, therefore all objects resulting from R X R are points referenced by ordered x/y pairs. In the same way, R X R X R is the creation of a Cartesian 3-space of the reals, all of whose mathematical objects consist of points referenced by 3-tuples of x/y/z coordinates. And so on for R^*n* etc.\n\nThis stuff gets hard. :\\\n\nI still haven't taken calculus.

The driver/speaker will tell you what it's optimal box size would be in cubic inches. Some simple math will tell you how large your box will be. I believe it's L x H x W.\n\n&gt; i always figured that a ported box has to be made specially for the speaker as the port size and position has to be \"tuned\" in order to get the proper sound.\n\nYou're right. Though it may be a little over-zealous. You can get a ported box with some kind of port, be it small and round or large and square, but it will have to be *really* bad for it to be very noticeable. Most cheap boxes come with like a 2\" round port. Some come with a long rectangular port with no flange. But if you want great sounding ported box, you got the right idea. Get an amp that can push your driver in the range it's designed for. And get a box that has been tuned to perform in the driver's frequency range.\n\n&gt; or can i just go nuts with a 3\" hole saw anywhere on a sealed box and end up with a good sounding ported box?\n\nI wouldn't go with a 3\". There is science behind the port  size, along with cabinet size, port length, port flange, port diameter. Without having access to stuff like waveform generators and meters If I were you, I would start small and work your way up. Maybe sacrifice a piece of MDF, drill a small hole, assemble the box, see how it sounds. You'll eventually get to a hole size that sounds like crap, then you know you've gone too far. Your port, seeing as how you probably won't be entering any competitions, can be as simple as PVC conduit. Or it can be a tuned flange.

{"body": "You got Asperger’s, this ain’t a barbecue. It’s your whole afternoon though, lost down a rabbit hole, looking for a timepiece, wonder when your date’s at, wonder if she’ll visit you at all today —relax. Wonder how many ribbons to expect in her hair —to deflect talk of triplets in respect for the pair or to stare at the bow made of four different colors —didn’t notice someone talking to you: there were others in the room, out in the gloom of the periphery. To shift your focus for a moment is to give the ribbons liberty, and that’s to suggest they make escape. This is a secret from the future: can’t rewind like a tape. Got to make the best and the most of each moment as it happens, got to keep your eyes on those bows, got to trap in your vision all four of them ‘cause this is a first: she might have noticed last time that you like ribbons that are hers.\n\nAnd sometimes you wish you didn’t. Sometimes it slips your mind. But when she’s supposed to visit isn’t one of those times, and you’re on one of those lines of thought that you encounter when you’d rather your surroundings were quieter instead of louder so that you could focus on other than a clock tick. You don’t want to talk shit but the one who made the clock made the cog stick. Minutes are violent noise, obliterating what you thought of as silent poise . Miles of boys before you done got crushed out on a girl like that, her hair flush with ribbons on all occasions and every day. If only making study of the bow could stem its getaway. Letter A S P E R G E R S: wonder whether she’s so confident with alphabets that she’d do it backwards skipping alternate letters. If you offer demonstration, would she consider that clever? This bitter endeavor: trying to predict a reaction. You know you’re supposed to try to give the notion traction but it don’t do nothing ‘cept make the clock tick. It don’t even do that. Yo, you got Asperger’s, kid.\n\nAnd I feel for you, son. I know love is hard. Can’t even write down all the answers on the back of a card. From the back and the far end of a cafeteria line you seem to catch sight of a ribbon. Fabric shines, and you abandon your tray, leave it clatter on the floor. You haven’t planned it this way. You can’t look at her no more. You don’t know what her eyes are like, whether she ever smiles, whether anything other than how she wears her hair beguiles. And while some apron ladies holler at you, you clutch your left ear and stand still like a statue. You could count cut corn on the floor without subtracting misplaced fish sticks like Dustin Hoffman overacting. Ain’t this already a scene in need of a fast forward? Why won’t the lunch people hush, do they court discord? You think you see a flash of color fleeing; it could be worse: you could have known how many ribbons there are, if they were hers.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321084272", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is essentially what my fiancé did for me and I LOVED it.  Especially because it was personal: I love games and reminiscing :)\n\nIt was so special and fun... He picked out something for me to wear that day and then he said he had to go run some \"errands\" (in reality, set up the scavenger hunt).  Then, he texted me to tell me I had to do a special scavenger hunt today and sent me the first hint.  I had to send him pictures of myself with the clues along the way too before he would give me the next hint.  (A great way to document that day by the way.)  In my case, my fiancé hid the letters: M A R R Y all around the city at places like:  where we first met, where we had an amazing first date, and other special places throughout our relationship.  Then, the last hint led me to go to my favorite tree in the city (where banana magnolias bloom) and there he was!  He had a sign taped to his shirt that said \"ME ?\" As soon as he finally saw me after I had ran all over for him doing the hunt, he got down on one knee &amp; asked me to marry him.  I said yes of course :). I was so excited... The ring wasn't as special as that memory is it me (although the ring is perfect too, it's my grandmother's diamond).\n\nEven better... After the proposal he had made dinner reservations.  I finished the scavenger hunt a lot sooner than he thought we would (I was excited, lol) and we got drinks at a fancy bar.  Then, at dinner he really blew me away.  Both of our parents had known about the proposal and were waiting at the restaurant ready to celebrate our engagement with us.  I had already called them to tell them the good news but they acted like they were at home. And surprised too... It was hilarious.  I can't tell you how much the surprise of sharing that day with both of our parents was for me.  The joining of our families, the 5 hour drives they took to be there, &amp; the thoughtfulness of my fiancé to realize that I wanted to share this special day with them is so special to me.  It confirmed for me that he is the one I want to be with forever no matter what.\n\nI hope you shine like this when you propose too :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321157479", "subreddit": "wedding", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To blow your mind even further, remember the film the Matrix? Problem seemed pretty cheesy when you first saw it, did to me too. However, it's extremely possible that we are in a simulation. If we ever achieve enough computing power and understanding of the universe's physics, we too could create a simulation of our own universe.\n\nJust the very idea that we will never be able to know if our entire existence is an experiment is extremely mind-blowing. Life is special but is not unattainable to even create ourselves, all it needs is enough executions of frames of entropy, ie. time. The world is a state-machine with rules (physics) and a driving force (energy.) It's not irreproducible with hypothetical quantum computing, and we would be able to set time to be 100000x as fast as our world inside of the simulation, resulting in life sprouting almost immediately. However, any being in the sim would be oblivious to the time outside of their simulation. Once this is done, we could actually advance time so fast in the simulation, to see inventions that the simulated humans create in 1000000 A.D, way past the time in our own world. Effectively, we would not even need to think anymore about creating new tech, the simulated humans would do it at a far faster rate, due to our computationally induced time dilation, we just run the simulation faster. \n\n\nTo blow your mind even further, imagine that you could sit down and join the simulation for 30-minute intervals before being woken up by your proctor. The procedure would allow you to forget who you were before, and allow you to enjoy the simulation without un-heeded knowledge from your real world. Now imagine that the sim world advances far enough to obtain the same technology. You go 3 levels deep, you no longer remember if you're in a sim or not -- **S I M C E P T I O N**\n\n\nEDIT: (fictional? you decide) story about what I discuss: http://qntm.org/responsibility", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321189104", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This works because of the long scale of the bass, and Spectors are some of the nicest basses you can buy in terms of playability. The tone isn't for everyone though. \n\nB. Ibanez SR500 tuned to B F# B E: 24\" scale. 2/16 on the low B at the 12th fret, 1.5 /16 on the rest of the strings. Enough relief to slide a thick business card under at the 7th fret. This was used in a metal project I was in, we played live a lot, and the slightly higher action allowed me to bang the shit out of the B string while articulating on the high strings.\n\nC. Galvaston (found it in a garage) 24\" scale. Tuned in standard. Neck relief is about 1 business card. Strings are 2/16 at the 12th fret. Great for aggressive slapping and heavy handed fingerstyle.\n\nI have another Spector and Geddy Lee and both feel similar to the set up of the Ibanez.

In the second case, we're in E minor, so we're using Am's, E's, and Dm's.  Of course, the original song is in major, but I can reharmonize it into a different key/mode without actually changing any of the notes of the melody.\n\nThe key (and I'm not making a distinction between keys and modes, so I could be referring to D phrygian or G major or F ahavah rabbah or C# dorian #4 or what have you) is defined by the tonal center and the set of notes the music uses, including the harmony, but it's not *well*-defined.  It's pretty easy for the key to be ambiguous.  Take your four-chord alternative rock song, for example, and suppose it has the chords Am, F, C, G.  Is it in C major (vi-IV-I-G) or in A minor (i-bVI-bIII-bVII)?  G-Am is a perfectly fine cadence.  It's just not clear which it is, and it's not necessary that there be an answer.\n\nThe main answer lies in the harmony, because without harmony, you have a lot more ambiguity.  But even still, the harmony may be ambiguous, and in that case, sorry, you're stuck with an ambiguous key -- nothing wrong with it!  However, wherever there's a strong tonic *chord*, that is, a defining tonal center, you can figure out what the key/mode is -- if it's not changing too rapidly!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321387398", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I understand where your coming from and have been in your shoes. I'm the kind of drummer who can pick up on ploy-rythms quickly and only need to hear a song once to be able to play it (usually), but I always had issues with improv. I thought that it was because I didn't have enough in my metaphorical bag of tricks and so was constantly learning crazier and crazier grooves but in all honestly that made my improv worse. I think that's because the crazier the groove the less room for deviation from that groove there was, and thus if the musical conditions weren't perfect (playing the song like a cover) I would just trip myself up more trying to make it fit. Lately, with alot of research, i have discovered what I believe to be the key of improv....ready for it?.... GET BACK TO THE BASICS!! As a drummer you have a plethora of instinctual beats, fills, and grooves already waiting for you in your head. But the problem is your hands aren't used to doing them thus, when they appear out of no where, you stumble. So I think if you train your hands (and feet) to master the basics (by master I mean any tempo, around the entire kit, as quiet and as loud as possible, off the left, with relaxed consistency) then all those things that pop into your head that you think will sound good but has weird sticking or impossible (to you now) movements that require alot of speed, you can do, instinctively. It's all about muscle memory bro. Why do you think all pro drummers  (exception of prog stuff) play so minimalist? it's the hierarchy of drumming knowledge. First you think \"Loud is better\" then \"Fast is better\" and once you are enlightened its \"Less is better\". we can all play loud and fast but it takes true skill to sit back in the pocket, listen for the perfect opening, and then DESTROY a fill that had no preconception but because your hands move freely with your mind (mastering the basics). What are these basics? you might ask. well i consider them to be diddles or doubles,(rrll) triplets (RLR,LRL) , singles (RLRL)  all paradiddles (RLRRLRLL, RLRLRRLRLRLL ect.) and that's pretty much it. Use them all in any and every way you can think of. RLK,RLK (gospel fills) RKRKRKLKLKLK (rock fills) RLKKRLKKRLKK (more rock fills) and then mix em all up between genres. Once you feel you've master some stuff then apply them to what ever music you like. I repeat, it's all about muscle memory. Hope this helps. (i can show you sick drum solos to give you an idea of how far you can take the basics). Also, Listen to EVERYTHING. the more different kinds of music your used to hearing the better knowledge you have for playing. I suggest \"Tower of Power\" for funk, \"Tool\" and \"porcupine tree\" for prog rock, Miles davis \"kind of blue\" for Jazz, Gordon Goodwin for Bigband,  \"Volumes\" for Metal, \"Circa Survive\" for pop rock, \"Every time I die\" for hardcore, \"\"The Roots\" for hip hop, \"Lamb of God\" for groove metal, \"Gypsy kings\" for latin, \"jimmy Bosch\" for salsa....I could keep going all day but thats a good start.\n\nAll that and i didn't answer your actual question, for solos Jestaverick s right its all about groove, all about what sounds you want to make. mastering the basics allows you to fill in between the main sounds of your solo giving it depth.\n picture a 4/4 rock groove. kick on every 1 and 3 snare on 2 and 4 and hat on 8th notes through it all.\n\n\n\nnow the sound you want to make is, (in 16ths): \n\n1e&amp;a2e&amp;a3e&amp;a4e&amp;a \nS   S     SS   SS \n\n(bap   bap    bapbap   bapbap) I always vocalize things and it seems to help\nnow get that in your head. ok now fill it in:\n\n1 e &amp; a 2 e &amp; a 3 e &amp; a 4 e &amp; a\nSssssSsssssssSSsssssSSssssss\n\n          &gt;      &gt;          &gt;&gt;       &gt;&gt;\n\nRl l r rLr r l l r r LRl l r r LR\n\nBasically just play diddles between accented notes, and there you go a one measure solo that sounds awesome (so get the sound that you want in your head and if you practice the basics you'll be able to fill in between those sounds without thinking about it and sound awesome (I tried to make a chart to explain better but didn't take into account text conversion so w/e you get the idea)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321390405", "subreddit": "drums", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This all may be viable, but not at *all* how I play Ryze.\n\nyour post reminded me how much I missed him, so I played some Ryze today. I went insanely positive in all of them, and carried. I even tried a Jungle Ryze, and got great ganks. I went 9/4/14 in that one.\n\nAnyway, here's what's up.\n\nFirst, you *always always always* level up your Q first. It has a tiny cooldown, and does the most damage. Your W is next for duration. Ryze is one of the only champs I have a set skill order with. It's \"Q W Q E Q R  then Q till max, W till max, then E. (while getting R every time you can)\".\n\nMaxing his Q is so incredibly important, I can't even stress it enough. It passively gives you CDR so you can spam everything more. It does the most damage of any spell. It has the shortest cooldown. It has the highest range. It has the highest Ratio (8% mana). It lets you spam it more, which triggers your passive. You get the point. It's 100% your best ability.\n\nFor masteries, go offensive. I actually made a spec specifically for you in [this tree.](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/mastery-tree-planner#&amp;tree1=1-0-3-0-0-4-0-0-0-1-2-0-0-0-0-0-0&amp;tree2=0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0&amp;tree3=1-0-3-0-4-0-0-0-3-1-0-4-0-0-3-0&amp;v=2) I won't go over it too much, because this post is already long. But basically, you go for the 10% CDR. That way, when your Q is maxed, you have 20% flat CDR with no items and no runes. Otherwise, the mana choice is obvious. I get movement speed instead of Mana regen, because you shouldn't have that many mana problems past the ~15-20 minute mark (you will have to B sometimes for mana, but that's fine. With a blue buff, you might never need to go back for mana.). You could mix up points in Awareness/Greed/Runic Affinity, but I went that way because 1. Ryze loves blue buff, and 2. Experience tends to be more important for a caster, specifically an early-game level-dependent caster such as ryze.\n\nFor summoner spells, I used to go Ghost/Flash because Ryze has no good escape mechanism. I'd still go ghost (for chasing and running) definitely. But flash got nerfed. I think it's still a good choice, but something like Promote or Heal(really nice after the buff. it can turn tides) might be a better choice. It's up to you.\n\nYou don't really need defensive masteries, because you build defensive items. You should start with a mana crystal and potion. Build that directly into a tear. At that point, there are three items to get. Catalyst/boots(1)/Glacialshroud. Which order you get them depends on the enemy team. More AP? Catalyst. More AD? Shroud. I always get my boots when I'm leftover with 350ish gold. Try to get them semi-early. Don't put them off too long. After those three, simply upgrade them to Frozen Heart/Banshee's. After that, get your archangels, then it's free game. If a game has lasted that long it's up to you. Items I tend to build are Rod of Ages, Void Staff, and sometimes Guardian Angel.\n\nThe way you play is also important. If you want, I could play a game with you sometime (probably this weekend) and show you. In the mean time, I can explain some simple stuff. \n\n1. When you get your tear, always be casting. You want to wait for your Archangel's because the Tear's passive is better for spam-casters. Which is what you are. Basically, just last hit or harass with your Q. That's good enough. Just *always* be doing it.\n\n2. NEVER FORGET YOUR PASSIVE. Pretty much the entire game, your E will do very little damage. The main point of it is to lower their MR, but *never* forget it lowers the cooldown on the other abilities. Same with your ult. Sometimes, you just need 1 more Q to kill a person. Well, popping your ult JUST for the 1 second less CD on your Q is worth it.\n\n3. There are 2 main combos I use. The first is my Harassing/burst combo. It does the most damage in the smallest amount of time. That is QEWQ.  You can cast the three one after the other, almost instantly... and then Q will instantly be off cooldown. The other is \"Sustained damage\". It's best when there's a teamfight and the enemies aren't focusing you. It does QWQEQRQWQ. After that just use stuff as it comes off cooldown. With this, you'll have to wait about 1 second before every Q. But doing it this way makes sure you're getting the most out of your passive.\n\nOk, this post has become ***way*** too long, so I'll stop here.\n\nAny more questions, just ask.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321600052", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my take:\n\nAnything other than a major or minor chord is pretty much a variation on the major or minor chord.  A sus chord, for example, is a chord where the 3 is replaced with a 4 -- Csus4, for example, is C F G.  Why would you want to use it?  Because the 4 REALLY wants to \"resolve\" to the 3, and you can play with that.  Put a sus4 chord, and all of a sudden people will be waiting expectantly for the 4 to resolve to the 3, and you could either do that or do something different to fake everyone out.\n\nAdd9 chords add the 9, which is the same as the 2.  If you play a chord with an added 9th, you'll hear how it's really the same chord but prettier.  Cadd9, for example, is C D E G, and the major second between the D and E is really beautiful, but it doesn't *do* anything like the 4 in the sus4 chord -- it's just pretty.  This isn't *technically* true, since the 9 does want to resolve to the 1 or the 3 a bit, but that's not so important.\n\nDominant 7th chords are just major chords with an added minor 7th: C E G Bb.  They tend to resolve to the chord a fourth above, so you'll often see G7 to C, or C7 to F, or whatever.  They don't always do that.  One use of the dominant 7th chord, especially with a b5, is to resolve down a half step: Ab7b5 to G7, which then goes to C.  In classical music theory, this is known as an augmented 6th chord (not related to augmented chords).  How would you spell Ab7b5?  Well, Ab7 is Ab C Eb Gb, so if you flat the 5, you have Ab C Ebb Gb or Ab C D Gb.\n\nWhat about major 7ths and minor 7ths?  Cmaj7 (or CM7) is C E G B.  The 7th just adds some color, so you can use it whenever you'd use a C major chord.  Same thing with Cm7, C Eb G Bb -- you can use that whenever you'd use a C minor chord.  Of course, this isn't *exactly* right: C major is unambiguously happy, while C major 7 has a twinge of sadness to it.  The 7th could also have to do with the melody; you might not want a Cmaj7 to harmonize an A, while a C6 would harmonize the A with no problems.  C6, by the way, is just a C major chord with an added 6: C E G A.  Cm6 is C Eb G A, and notice that the A isn't in the key of C minor, so this has a mysterious quality to it.  Both can be used as tonic chords -- the I or i.\n\n9ths are 7ths with an additional note.  C9, for example, is C7 with a 9th: C E G Bb D.  This is different from an add9 chord, because the add9 chord doesn't have the 7th.  Cadd9 is C D E G (or C E G D), and there's no Bb.  Cmaj9 is Cmaj7 with a 9.  Cm9 is a Cm7 with a 9.  Easy, right?  A nice chord to use is G7b9, which is a G7 with a b9 added: G B D F Ab.  If you play those notes, that's the beginning of \"I Will Survive\".  When do you use a 9th?  Pretty much whenever you'd use a 7th.  The 9th adds complexity.  If you're in C major, for example, G9 is a nice chord to use to resolve to C, but in C minor, you'd probably want to go with G7b9 because of that Ab in the key.\n\nAugmented chords are a weird bunch.  There are usually notes in them that want to go someplace else, so it's a tense structure.  You should not use an augmented chord as a tonic, though: Caug (or C+) is not a good home chord.  However, G+ is a good dominant chord.  Let's look at it: G B D#.  That's one way to spell it.  This would be something like G(#5).  The B wants to go to C because it's the leading tone.  The D# really wants to go to the E.  So you'd resolve it by going to C major: G C E (the bass would probably go down to the C).  You could also spell G+ as G B Eb.  The B still wants to go to the C, but the Eb wants to go down to the D.  It's really a case of spelling!  So one common thing to do would be G B Eb to G B D to C, or G B Eb to C Eb C D, which is a chord with an added 9th.  You could write G B Eb as G(#5) like the enharmonically different chord, or you could realize that the Eb is the b13, so this would be a G(b13), or more commonly, G7b13 (even if the 7th isn't there; that's OK).\n\nSo, this business with 6's and 13's, what's going on?  Well, you can think of a chord as 1 3 5, but the *extended* chord gets built up in thirds: C E G B D F A, or 1 3 5 7 9 11 13.  So when you add notes that are in the extended chord, you use 9/11/13, but when you add notes that are not meant to be part of the extended chord but alterations to the basic chord, you use 2/4/6.  Csus4, for example, is just C F G; C11 would be C E G Bb D F (all of those notes are optional, though).  C6 is C E G A, but C13 will probably have a 7th.  Really, though, it's just a matter of convention.  Sometimes it's called a 13 and sometimes a 6, but you pretty much have to figure it out from context.  One note that's worth mentioning is the #11.  Sometimes it's a b5, sure, but if you mean it as an extension, you use #11.  When would you use a #11?  The #11, the lydian note, is REALLY pretty next to the 3 or the 5.  You can use it when you want extra prettiness.\n\nAnyway, good luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1321653952", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

So one day her cousin came to her and explained that she had been scammed- one of her friends from abroad emailed her, saying they were trying to mail her a very nice gift but it was held up in Malaysia customs.  She would need to pay the customs $1500 for them to release the package, and then once the package made it to Korea they would reimburse her.  So this cousin decides \"$1500 is too much, but I'll give them $700 and hopefully that's enough\" and she borrows $700 from a friend to pay this.\n\nA couple days pass and she realized she's a total idiot, and tells my friend what happened and she's worried about paying her friend back the $700, and what would happen if her hard-ass parents find out, etc.  So my friend agrees to give her the $700 so she stays out of trouble, in exchange for hour long Korean lessons every day for 10 weeks.  Now the cousin is totally avoiding her and it's pretty clear there might not have been an original scam and the cousin just stole her money\n\n\n**TLDR** friends cousin gets Internet scammed out of borrowed money, friend agrees to help her out and help pay back the borrowed money to stay out of trouble.

The game probably thinks you're a snow biome or something. I had the same problem when I loaded my 1.9 world in my 1.8 world -- ice everywhere.\n\nAnd also, \n\nThink of it this way -- the biomes are probably saved as a number, the biomes are defined on the world and saved with that number.

Now, you have (s = swamp)\n\n    a b c s d e\n\nHowever, the game doesn't look at the actual biome, just its position in the list -- in this list, it is the fourth element, so it would be assigned the value of \"3\" (lists start at 0).\n    \n    0 1 2 3 4 5\n    a b c s d e\n\nCompare this with the original list of biomes:\n\n    0 1 2 3 4\n    a b c d e\n\nThe third element of the list changed from \"d\" to \"s\", which makes all the \"d\" biomes \"s\" biomes.

{"body": "Well myself, all my musical knowledge is self taught. When I first started off I would spend time putting notes together and forming chords. As I would add notes I would adjust to what sounded right to my ear. Now some people find it hard to match notes together so this may not work for everyone. I eventually found learning the basic chords helped a ton. C D E F G A B major and minor. Also I recommend getting a midi keyboard to use. By having a keyboard to play around on and experiment on really helped me learn and form my own knowledge of music theory.\n\nI know some may say you must learn the theory first before you can make melody but I have found that this is not the case. Really it all depends on your learning style and how your mind grasps and forms musical structure. So reading theory learning guides may work for you or may not.\n\nI'd say progressive house and dubstep aren't as melodic as trance is. If you want to make trance its all about the chords and melody. Trance is a beautiful genre capable of expressing any emotion possible. It's all about taking a feeling and putting it into musical form. With any music creation though I'd suggest listening and analyzing songs of the genre you want to make. Listen for the different chords, note velocities, quantization, and various note patterns that make up the melodies. Eventually you will start to piece together melodies in your head and expand on them. It all takes time though. Funny thing I can do now after may years of self taught music is actually picture a melody as if it was laid out in a piano roll in a DAW. That's how I learnt music :P Wonder if anyone else here does the same.\n\nOh also I found importing midi songs into my DAW and looking at the melodies really help as well. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1322016417", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey, sorry about the late reply. Here's what I found as far as your wiring:\n\n- Car Radio Battery Constant 12v+ Wire: Red\n- Car Radio Accessory Switched 12v+ Wire: The radio harness does not provide a switched power source. Run a wire to the fusebox or the ignition switch harness for switched power.\n- Car Radio Ground Wire: Brown\n- Car Radio Illumination Wire: Gray/Blue\n- Car Stereo Dimmer Wire: N/A\n- Car Stereo Antenna Trigger Wire: White\n- Car Stereo Amp Trigger Wire: N/A\n- Car Stereo Amplifier Location: N/A\n- Car Audio Front Speakers Size: 3 1/2″\n- Car Audio Front Speakers Location: Dash\n- Left Front Speaker Positive Wire (+): Blue\n- Left Front Speaker Negative Wire (-): Brown/Blue\n- Right Front Speaker Positive Wire (+): Red\n- Right Front Speaker Negative Wire (-): Brown/White\n- Car Audio Rear Speakers Size: 6 1/2″ Speakers\n- Car Audio Rear Speakers Location: Rear Deck\n- Left Rear Speaker Positive Wire (+): Blue/Green\n- Left Rear Speaker Negative Wire (-): Brown/Red\n- Right Rear Speaker Positive Wire (+): Red/Green\n- Right Rear Speaker Negative Wire (-): Brown/Black\n\nIf those wires don't match up, don't panic. There's a method to finding out what does what. Here's how I do it:\n\n- Disconnect car battery first!\n- Pick one wire and put it to a positive side of any 1.5 volt battery and start touching the negative side to the other wires that are loose. Once you hear a pop, you've found a speaker. To determine the positive and negative wires, put a piece of paper over the speaker. Once you pop it, you should see the paper move. If the paper gets sucked in towards the grill, your wires are backwards. If the paper gets pushed out, then you're good. The wire on the positive end of the batter is the positive wire of the speaker.\n\nYou will not be able to find speaker wires and if they are negative or positive based on the color coding. They have no consistency.\n\nReconnect your car battery.\n\nNext thing you need to do is find the ignition, ground, and constant. You'll need a test light for this. Ground the test light and start touching the other exposed wires with the key OUT of the ignition. Once the test light turns on, this is your constant 12v supply. To find the ignition wire, find the one that turns the light on only when your key is in the \"On\" position. To find the ground, first connect the grounding end of your test light to a positive electrical source. Once you find the ground wire, the light will turn on.\n\nWith all this said, you still won't be able to power up the speakers with a simple MP3 player. You will need amplification of some sort. I reccomend a cheap CD player with a mini-jack out. At least this way, you won't have a hard time trying to figure out what to connect where.\n\nHere's the wiring diagram for all aftermarket head units:\n\n- P o w e r\n- Memory (+12v Constant) \tYellow\n- Ignition (+12v Switched) \tRed\n- Ground (-) \tBlack\n- Power Antenna \tBlue\n\n- S p e a k e r s\n- Right Front (+) \tGray\n- Right Front (-) \tGray/Black\n- Left Front (+) \tWhite\n- Left Front (-) \tWhite/Black\n- Right Rear (+) \tViolet\n- Right Rear (-) \tViolet/Black\n- Left Rear (+) \tGreen\n- Left Rear (-) \tGreen/Black \n\nAnd just for your reference:\n [Test light.](http://www.2carpros.com/images/articles/tools/test_light/test_light.jpg)\n\nLet me know if you need any more help.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1322077929", "subreddit": "Autos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Are you practicing on a practice pad? Some drummers coming from beginner into intermediate don't realize their snare head is so stretched out and loose/flat that it's difficult to -learn- a consistent double bounce with both hands. If you have a practice pad, what helped for me was to focus on the stick coming up higher between each bounce. In your R R L L combo, start forte with the first stroke, and right after the first stroke, focus on relaxing your grip (especially your thumb) to allow the stick to come up high enough that -on it's own- it will 'snap' back down with force equal to a second forte stroke. JUST do the R, until you can deliver 2 strokes of equal force with one -actual- stroke. Repeat this with your L, and then chain them. Like most things you practice, you will be unsure if you are doing it right until you feel it, and you will have a light bulb moment where you -know- you just stumbled onto the technique. Best luck!\n\nTL;DR, Focus on even strokes one hand at a time, using a practice pad instead of snare.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1322106534", "subreddit": "Drumming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Case in point, the girl serving me food at the McDonald's in Riga, Latvia could have walked off the pages of Playboy. The women there were so friendly and soft in attitude that it was disconcerting and was...odd...compared to what I was used to. It's definitely a culture shock. When we were in Bucharest, Romania the women L O V E D us to death. When they found out we were leaving in a few days the girls literally balled their eyes out. We later came to find out that the manager of the bar we frequented would beat up the girls and treated them like a stereotypical pimp would treat a hooker. They loved us because we were nice, and compared to their living conditions we were loaded. What we made in a month was more than most of them would make in a year. Even the guys are different. My boss gave our guide a Leatherman to show his appreciation and the guy cried and it was hugs for all because he'd never been given a gift like that before and it was way out of his affordability range. In short, in Eastern Europe they actually appreciate men, not being brutalized, and wealth, and don't have a lick of entitlement attitude from what I saw.

{"body": "I use [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Scales-Modes-Melodic-Patterns/dp/0786617918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322234354&amp;sr=8-1) with my students.  It covers all the scales you will ever need to know.\n\nI've been trying to keep a list of the good jazz discussions that come through r/piano.  I would start by reading through: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/mcf6k/an_introduction_to_jazz_piano/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/lqf0z/beginning_jazz_at_16any_advice_or_resources/), and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/m5ia0/jazz_piano/).\n\nIf it's an option for you, then I **strongly suggest getting a teacher**.  Most of my students come from a classical background and it's quite a shift to get them playing jazz.  If you want to learn by yourself, then the thing to do is transcribe.  Find a player you like and figure out what they are doing and when they are doing it.  \n\nRegardless of if you get a teacher or not, you NEED to listen to as much jazz as possible.  I like to point people to [JazzRadio.com](http://www.jazzradio.com/pianotrios) for starters.  You also NEED to start training your ears with [daily practice](http://www.iwasdoingallright.com/tools/ear_training/main/#top).\n\nIn answer to your question on modes, start simple with a C major scale.  What you're going to do is use only the notes that make up the C major scale but start on different scale degrees.\n\n* **Ionian: C D E F G A B C (simple major scale)**\n* **Dorian: D E F G A B C D (you can think of it as b3 and b7 with regards to a major scale)**\n* Phrygian: E F G A B C D E (b2, b3, b6, b7 with regards to a major scale)\n* Lydian: F G A B C D E F (#4 with regards to a major scale)\n* **Mixolydian: G A B C D E F G (b7 with regards to a major scale)**\n* Aeolian: A B C D E F G A (natural/pure minor scale)\n* Locrian: B C D E F G A B (b2, b3, b5, b6, b7 with regards to a major scale)\n\nI bolded Ionian, Dorian, and Mixolydian because those are the most common scales you will use in jazz.  They are used over a ii V I progression which is the core progression in jazz.  You'll usually see a ii V I progression as a minor seventh chord, followed by a dominant seventh chord, followed by a major seventh chord.  In the key of C, for example, you would have Dmin7 G7 Cmaj7.\n\nI hope this is enough to get you started!\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1322235883", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

A shoot-out might play very differently depending on weapon, location, enemies.

A \"grindy game\" that doesn't feel lame has to have solid, satisfying gameplay at the core. It can't just be you mashing X X X X X X X X X on your controller like jrpgs of yore, or spamming the one skill you put any points into like D2.\n\nPersonally, I feel like Skyrim shoots my \"grind fatigue\" through the roof, even though every dungeon is unique, and every sidequest has unique voicework, because the combat is super-lame.

{"body": "Alright, cool, I'll just start from scale construction. You'll want a keyboard in front of you for this, and if you don't have one [this](http://method-behind-the-music.com/piano) will do. Alright, so, the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and then C again will make up the C major scale. From C to C we have a pattern of whole and half steps that is this:\n\n* WWHWWWH\n* W standing for a whole step, and H standing for a half step.\n\nSo, this pattern of whole and half steps will make a major scale starting from any key on the piano. For keeping the explanation simple (for now) we're just going to work with C major for now.\n\nThe scale degrees are numbered from 1 to 7.\n\nSo in C major your scale degrees are these:\n\n* C D E F G A B C\n* 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1\n\nThere are fancier names for these scale degrees: [Tonic, Supertonic, Mediant, Sub-Dominant, Dominant, Sub-Mediant, Leading Tone, and Tonic again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scale_degree_names.png), but we're not gonna worry about those for now either, most of the time for basic things you just need to now the number of the scale degree.\n\nNotice that the next C after B is also 1, not 8. All instances of a scale degree, regardless of where they are on the piano, are the same so long as you're still working within that scale. So in C major, C is always 1, regardless of which C it is.\n\nI'll stop here for now, and let you take this in. Please ask any questions you have, I'll be more than happy to clarify for you, and then we can move on to the next step.

{"body": "You'll have to be more specific.\n\nP2P is a mess right now, it's just a bunch of people teleporting, PJing, and running away after they blow their special attacks.  I would personally recommend a G2Her.\n\nIf you were to do that, I can give you a brief rundown. After making a bit of money off skills or however you'd like to do that (I would say 10m is a good amount), if you want to jump straight into decent G2H stats, you should do the following:\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to create a dungeoneering party, preferably friends, set a schedule, and dungeon large floors whenever you can. Start at F1, and keep going until you can no longer go, then reset. After resetting, c1 rush the first half of your available floors, and then large the rest. Continue on a regular basis, as you don't want to just stop at a gravite 2h.\n\nWhile you're doing that, when you're not dungeoneering or skilling, you should begin training your combat skills. \n\nFirst rule, 1 prayer, no higher. Do not train prayer, you will regret it. \n\nSecond, your Ranged level OR your Strength level can be calculated using this formula:\n\n\nRanged x 1.5 = Attack + Strength\n\nAttack will always be 45. For example, let's say you wanted to know what strength level you need at 70 Range (A good starting number).\n\n70 x 1.5 = 45 + Strength\nStrength = 60\n\nMy recommendations are 45 attack, 62 strength, and 70 range. The reason you get 62 strength rather than 60 is because your Range level increases more quickly in PvP, this gives you a bit of leeway when PKing so you don't have to go back and fix your stats.\n\n\nHP level is a different matter. My recommendations are to have the HP level of a strength pure. This allows your range and strength level to be much higher, and your strength level will match that of a pure strength's (5 less because you're 45 attack, but you'll hit way harder).\n\nHow do you do this? To calculate your HP level required, go to tip.it's combat calculator. After you know what strength level you want to get, add 5 to it and change your attack level on the calculator to 40, and then hit the 'constitution' button. It will automatically fill in an HP level for you.\n\n\nHow do you train combat skills and meet that HP level requirement? There's a few options.\n\n\nMy personal recommendations, train strength using Sacred Clay Scimitars (use non-combat SC for it, FC is 'Fast SC' world 99), until you reach your desired strength level. If you reach your HP level before you reach your strength level, Soul Wars the rest of your strength level.\n\n\nIf you reach your strength level before your range level, begin ranging whatever you're training on (rock crabs) until you do reach your required HP level, then finish off at Ranging guild.\n\nQuick Ranging guild guide, you'll need max range bonus, I highly highly highly recommend  a longbow sight, it's only 10k dungeoneering tokens, and you're already going to be dungeoneering so you might as well.\n\nTo train attack, I recommend quests.\n\nWaterfall, Tree Gnome Village, Grand Tree, Vampire Slayer, Underground Pass, Death Plateau, and then train the rest (should be no more than 10k xp).\n\nOnce you have all your perfect skills (in this case 45 attack/62 strength/70 range/whatever HP level you want), you can choose to get 70 magic just so it looks nice, it won't really do much though (maybe if you like multi), and a gravite 2h, you can start PKing.\n\nThere isn't really much of a guide I can provide you for that, it all comes from mainly experience. \n\n\nBecause you'll be using a gravite 2h, you don't skull. Your best bet would be to wear two expensive items, such as dragonhide chaps (g) and some expensive hat, and then carry about 50k in coins in your inventory. When people ask to fight, simply say \"I don't skull, I risk cash\", show them the cash, and if they aren't morons, they'll fight you without you skulling.\n\nOh, one more thing, NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER N E V E R SMASH with the gravite 2h. There will always be morons who will tell you that it hits harder, it doesn't. It's simply more accurate, and by more accurate, I mean less 0s. It doesn't make your 100 become a 200, and it is &gt;COMPLETELY&lt; useless against a pure with 1 defence. If someone with high defence starts to attack you, you can just say you don't want to fight.\n\nIt's too risky for someone who's never done the smash switch, as there is a stupidly high chance you'll screw up and get defence.\n\n\nIf you have any more questions or if I left something out, let me know. good luck!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1322678105", "subreddit": "runescape", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
