{"body": "You'd think I'd have to stop posting this by now\n\nhttp://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Another-view-of-game-piracy\n\n80% piracy rates (same about as they are claiming here) for iphone aps can come from only 10% of the market being pirates. \n\nI'm just going to block quote a long post about this I made somewhere else. note this is not an attack on CD project, they are doing wonderful thing. Yet it is an attack on the use of \"downloaded this number of times by pirates\" as useful thing to say.\n\nI wish devs would just stop with the whole \"pirated copies downloaded\" thing. It's a pointless number that is relevant to nothing. Iphone apps that saw a 80% piracy rate do so when only 10% of the market is made up of the jail broken iphones that run them. Pirates, and this may seem silly to have to point this bout but stay with me, can afford to download more games than a normal consumer can afford. The number of times a torrent is downloaded does nothing to account for the fact that pirates have unlimited \"spending power\" when related to a normal consumer.\n\nLets say as a consumer I can only buy one game a month. Between Game A and Game B lets say I pick to buy Game A leaving Game B for a future date or sale. If I decided to buy neither and pirate them I get both Game A and Game B (and like Game C D E F and G too). When counting number of sales I would have only counted to Game A if I brought instead of pirated but as a pirate I would be counted in the downloads of both Game A and Game B.\n\nIt should be very clear then that there is an issue when game devs then will then take those download numbers and relate them to their sale figures. You are contrasting two groups where individuals on either side have vastly different ability to effect those numbers. Legitimate customers are only going to be able to count towards game they can afford to pay for, pirates can count towards vastly more. \n\nOne in 5 copies of the game being legal means a 80% piracy rate (rounding numbers to make life easier) is in line with the iphone piracy app data that this argument is based on. All those illegal copies could be accounted for if only 10-20% of the market for the game are pirates. \n\nSo 5 million pirate copies sounds like a shocking number but when you adjust for the fact that a given pirate likely downloads far more games than a consumer buys then the number of sales that may have lost will come out drastic smaller. If 10-20% of the market are pirates then we have a 50-100 million people market. Take out the pirates and that is 45-95 million people who may have brought the game. Given that only 1 million people did then that is 1-2% of the market. If we assume then that same percentage of the downloaders would have brought it that is 50,000 - 100,000 copies that they may have sold if piracy was not a factor. \n\nThat is of course ignoring all the other factors that come in to play when looking at why people pirate. Economic ones like how pirates are far more likely to be people who would buy fewer games if piracy didn't exist than those who already do. Or that there are people who both pirate and buy games for a number of reasons like wanting to test how it runs on the system or to make more informed choices about the quality of the game they are paying for.\n\nSo ya with some leaps we can argue that those 5 million pirate downloads means at the very best means maybe 100,000 copies that may not have sold. Which is sad for the devs but is a fraction of what blindly looking at download sales suggests even before you start talking about the economic and other reasons people pirate that would lower that could lower that number more. \n\nAll that I've done with the numbers here is hugely sketchy but what I'm trying to get across is that \"our 1 million selling game got pirated 5 million times\" is a pretty meaningless and likely misleading statement.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1322733665", "subreddit": "Games", "score": 38, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "G B E -- what chord is it?  In E minor, it's an E minor first inversion, while in C major, it's a G13. (:\n\nWhat I was taught once when I asked this question is that the 13th in a V13 chord resolves to the 9th of the tonic.  In bossa nova, it's often used to give complexity to the chord (unless it's in the melody, of course), with a b13 used in a minor key (often misspelled as #5).  It's a VERY characteristic chord!  It's a melodic structure more than a harmonic one, I'd say, and while I analyze the chord as a 13th chord, I don't consider it a huge tertian tower.  I'd never voice G13 as G B D F A C E; I usually voice it G F B E.  (G7b13 would be G F B Eb, or even just G B Eb -- a dominant augmented triad, pretty much!)\n\nBy the way, if a chord is a tonic chord, the 13 becomes a 6.  C6 is C E G A; Cm6 is C Eb G A.  The 6 is there for color, usually, unless the melody is leaving a 6-5 suspension unresolved.  One chord that's pretty popular is the 6/9, which is a major tonic chord involving this characteristic perfect fourth between the 6 and the 9, and the 6 replaces the 7.  The major 7th really affects the mood of the chord -- Cmaj7 has that bittersweet feel -- so the 6 or 13 is a nice way to stay in the key and add complexity to a chord without altering the mood too much.\n\nThe 11th is a different story, though.  The 11th, AKA the 4th, is the \"avoid\" note in a major scale, because it clashes really badly with the major 3.  When you see it, it's usually in a minor chord -- Cm11, for instance -- but it can be dominant as well, sometimes, and the 3 will almost always be placed above the 4.  The minor 9th is an interval to avoid inside a chord, except with the bass.  (That doesn't stop me from writing such intervals when I want dissonant-sounding music, of course.)  The 11th is usually in the melody, because the 11th chord is kind of awkward -- the 11th is far from the other notes, harmonically, and an Em11 -- E B D F# A (note the lack of 3rd; it can be omitted in a minor 11th because it doesn't really do anything) -- is just awkward unless you have a good reason for the A being there, like that it's in the melody.\n\nI should point out that this chord is an 11th: G C F A, G11.  This is also written as F/G, and it's an F major chord over a G root.  In C major, this would be both a IV and V at the same time.  Also, quartal chords can be used as dominant 11ths, especially with all perfect fourths, making it less dissonant: G C F Bb Eb is actually a Gm13, and it can definitely be a dominant chord.\n\nThe #11 is a *whole* other ball game.  This lydian note is consonant with pretty much everything, including the 3 and the 5 in a major chord, giving it a really beautiful bite.  Use this note as a color tone, because it doesn't do much other than sound pretty.  I'd avoid making it part of a big tertian structure, though, because then it will tonicize the notes around it.  C E G B D F# sounds more like a polychord than a single thing, but C E F# B is a better Cmaj7#11.  Even C E F# G B, with that half step between the #11 and the 5.\n\nYou might have figured out that I like bossa nova.  These chords are all characteristic of it, and they are where bossa nova finds its complex sound.  The trouble with the 13th chord is that the extended structure is pandiatonic -- it has every white note!  The trick is to eliminate notes and voice the chord so that it's not just a mass of sound, and the way to do that is to liven it up with root motion and only use the most important notes in the chord.  It helps that the guitar, the preferred instrument for bossa nova, can only play four notes at a time (four fingers on the left hand, thumb and three useful fingers on the right; it's rare to see chords with five or six notes because it's much harder to get them to have the notes you want).  You might find this progression:\n\nAm7 G13b9 Gm6 Dm7\n\nWhere do they come from?  The note in the melody is just an E, embellished by F's.  That G13b9 is actually not a G13b9 at all but an inverted E7b9 (voiced G# F B E), so the bass is going down chromatically.  The melody resolves from E to the harmonic F on the Dm7.  The chords themselves come mostly from the necessity of filling in the space between bass and melody.\n\nWhy would you write an 11th or 13th?  Either for color or because you're filling in the space between the melody and the bass.  They are colorful notes and can be useful and complex.

{"body": "Yeah!\n\nFirst, you should know what key your melody is in, and then you should figure out what scale degree each note is.  For example, if you're in C major, then C is 1, D is 2, E is 3, F is 4, G is 5, A is 6, B is 7.  If you're in E major, then E is 1, F# is 2, G# is 3, A is 4, B is 5, C# is 6, D# is 7.  If you're in E *minor*, then E is 1, F# is 2, G is 3, A is 4, B is 5, C is 6, D is 7.  And so on.\n\nNow, you want to have a chord for each segment of the melody.  In major, the chords you have to work with are the I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii0; in minor, they're i, ii0, bIII, iv, v or V, bVI, bVII.  I just said a bunch of confusing things, so bear with me for a bit here.  To build a chord on a note of the scale, you play that note, skip the next, play the next note, skip the next, and play the next note.  For example, in C major, the C major chord is C (not D) E (not F) G.  In E major, the F# minor chord is F# (not G#) A (not B) C#.  Anyway, in C major, your chords are C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim.  In C minor, they're Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm (or G), Ab, Bb.  The Roman numeral system works easily: the numeral is the scale degree of your chord, and it's capitalized if major and lowercase if minor.  And just to clear up confusion, they're the scale degrees of the *major* scale, so if you want the chord on the 3 of your minor scale, since that's a half step lower than the major scale 3, you call it bIII.  In C minor, that would be Eb major.\n\nNow, how do you fit the chords to the melody?  That's called **harmonization**.  Every note can be *harmonized* by some chord or other, and when you write the chords, you do so in a way that the notes go together.  In C major, the note C can be harmonized by C (C E G), by F (F A C), and by Am (A C E) -- that is, C is a member of each of those chords.  D can be harmonized by G (G B D), Dm (D F A), or Bdim (B D F).  You can figure out what chords each note is in.  Then, for each segment of the song -- be it a measure, or half a measure, or whatever -- you put in a chord that fits the most important notes in each measure.  So if your melody is in C major and goes C D E G for one measure, C major is a good chord to use, even though the D isn't in the chord -- the D is called a *non-harmonic tone*, since it's not important enough to bepart of the chord.  In this case, it's a *passing tone*, since the melody passes through D when going from one chord tone (C) to the next (E).\n\nThen you have to worry about **chord progression** -- that is, the motion from one chord to the next.  There are a lot of ways to approach this.  If you listen to a lot of alternative rock songs, for instance, you'll see that they always use four chords only: I, V, vi, IV.  If you listen to the Beatles, they use a LOT more interesting chords.  For example, Yesterday goes something like this: I ii/vi V/vi vi IV V I vii vi II IV I.  And that's just the first verse.  The best way to figure this out is to listen to a bunch of songs, figure out their chord progressions, and look for patterns.  Notice that V likes to be followed by I or i.  So when you have a song in minor, usually you use the major V instead of the minor v, since minor v doesn't yearn for the i so strongly.  And notice how the vi is pretty similar to the I (and the bVI to the i), so even though V wants the I or i, sometimes you can give it the vi or bVI instead and it sounds surprising.\n\nThere are also chord extensions.  I don't want to get into them too deeply, but if after you build the chord, you skip another note and play the next one after that, you get a 7th chord.  For example, in C major, Cmaj7 is C E G B.  That means that you can harmonize a B with a Cmaj7 chord.  If you take a major chord and stick a major 7th on it, it's a major 7th chord (Cmaj7, for example, is C E G B); if you take a minor chord and stick a minor 7th on it, it's a minor 7th chord (Dm7, for example, is D F A C); if you take a *major* chord and stick a *minor* 7th on it, it's a *dominant* 7th chord (G7, for instance, is G B D F).  If you don't see a \"flavor\" in front of the 7, it's a dominant 7th.  Dominant 7ths REALLY want to go to I or i, and they're also REALLY common, so if you have a 4 in your melody that \"resolves\" to a 3, the V7 is a good chord to harmonize it.  For example, if you know Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da (Beatles), you know that the melody of the verse, if it were in C major, would go like this: E E E E E E D C B D D, F F F F F F E D C.  How do they harmonize it?  C major until you get to the B, then G7 until you get to the C at the end, then C major again.  In Roman numerals, that would be I V7, V7 I.  The V7 asks a question that the I answers.  Anyway, I won't go into any chords more complicated than the dominant 7th, but you can look them up.  If you're a guitar player, you can definitely find chord symbols for your favorite songs, and you can learn more about chords that way and through looking things up on Google.\n\nFinally, everything I just said is just some basic guidelines, not rules.  Music doesn't have rules.  You can do WHATEVER you want.  If you break the guidelines, things might not sound good, but then again, maybe they might.  The full set of guidelines for how to harmonize a melody is much wider than this -- there are a LOT of chords to use and a LOT of room for creativity, and I only showed you a small segment of it.  You can change keys in the middle of your melody.  You can \"borrow\" chords from the minor scale or from other keys.  You can play 7th chords of all types, and even 13th chords.  You can write complicated chord structures that don't have anything to do with your melody but sound good anyway.  Your possibilities are limitless.  Good luck!\n\nN.B. Accompaniment is just whatever's not the melody.  The chords would definitely count as accompaniment, but *the* accompaniment also includes whatever rhythm the guitar is playing with the chords, the bass, the drums, the backup vocals, everything other than the melody itself.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1322940183", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, the idea is that the class constraint would serve that purpose.  For instance:\n\n    (Monad m, Errorable e)=&gt; Form m i e v a -&gt; Validator m e a -&gt; Form m i e v a\n\ntells you (concisely) what sort of thing e is without having to write out a descriptive type variable three times.  I can appreciate the desire not to restrict the full generality of the function, but restrictions of full generality happen all the time in order to prevent syntactically correct but pragmatically meaningless computations.  \n\nOr perhaps the folks who wrote `digestive-functors` really did anticipate someone passing Just [1,2,3] as the error, and didn't want to deny them that opportunity.  Essentially, there are two views.  On the first view, you are free to pass whatever you want as the error argument without specifying what types can serve as error types, and hope that whatever function that actually deals with `e` down the line will catch your mistake if you accidentally pass it `i`, `v` or `a`.  On the second view, you define some sort of \"Errorable\" class and ensure that whatever you pass as `e` is an instance of that class.\n\nI'm not saying that the second way is preferable-- I'm saying that I don't see some kind of intrinsic, extra-conventional reason to prefer one to the other.  I guess my question turns on what it means to say that \"my function _works_ [emph. added] for a type with variables that have no class restrictions\".  If my function could potentially store a phone number in a list of social security numbers, is it \"working\" better than its alternative that prevents that automatically with a compile-time check?  My general intuition is that if you know enough about what a type is doing in a given function to give it a descriptive name, it seems you might as well try to enforce that through the type system.\n\nIf you want to say that this is the convention in Haskell, that's a fine and reasonable answer.

I would argue that in your movement, he' not a nobody.\n\nNo he didn't. This is what he said\n\n\"According to a study conducted by former Purdue sociologist Eugene J. Kanin and published in Archives of Sexual Behavior, in more than 40 percent of the cases reviewed, the complainants eventually admitted that no rape had occurred. Mr. Kanin also studied rape allegations in two large Midwestern universities and found that 50 percent of the allegations were recanted by the accuser.\"\n\nHe can't be expected to throw the entire peer reviewed study out, because of some unintentional biases, and the second two studies, used no polygraph, just because feminists would rather we used the numbers on the extreme lower end, and not investigations into false rape claims.\n\nYou characterization, like your claim that he cherry picked the high numbers (41% is the lower mid range), is a mischaracterization. \n\n&gt;O P I N I O N\n\nNo fact based logic\n\nThe fact that the men's movement is full of people that have have been falsely accused, the fact that there are false accusations in the news all the time, the fact that there is research that shows false accusations, the fact that feminists routinely use false accusations and insinuations about rape as a rhetorical device etc strongly implies that that real false accusers create the idea that women can make false accusations \n\nWhat you are implying, the feminist position, that it has manifested itself out of nothing or some sort of delusion, is faith based, implausible and there is zero evidence for it. As well as that, there is authoritative evidence that feminism has been lying about false accusations because of an agenda to convince society that they don't really exist and remove legal standards of proof for men.\n\n\"At the core of LDF discourse  on rape is the proposition that “women don’t lie” about sexual abuse. The foundation for such a bold statement is the claim that false accusations of rape are very rare; specifically, its proponents claim that no more than two percent of such complaints are invalid.  In an attempt to shift the laws governing rape to correspond with this purported social reality, LDF advocates shifting the burden of proof from the woman complaining of the alleged sexual wrong to the man defending against it. As  discussed in Part III, changes to the legal definitions of rape and any corresponding shifts in the burden of proof are ill-advised and dangerous\".\n\nhttp://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v33-issue3/greer.pdf\n\n&gt;MRA's have an agenda to keep them high.\n\nIf the mrm had an agenda to keep them high, they would cherry pick the high numbers. As it stands, the only data that they use is the only data available on investigations of false accusations. Fact is, there are no other studies that actually investigate false allegations.\n\nI don't think that you understand how easy it would be for there to be a high rate. Watch - If for every 100 rapes there only 5 false accusations, and 90% of rapes aren't reported, that's all it would take for there to be a 50% false reporting rate.\n\n&gt;This underscores your goal-setting. You criticized advocacy websites on one paragraph and used one as a source on the next. I merely adapted to your level.\n\nNo, in light what has emerged about McDowells figures, I'm going to complaining to Radar.

I'm prepared to accept that there is a serious problem with McDowell numbers and they shouldn't be used, even on the basis that the criticism came from a blog (I reject the idea that Kanins research is totally unusable as an example of what 3 studies found) and I will be complaining to Radar about it, while you will defend and deny feminist abuse denial till the end, even when the source of the criticism are DV research establishment themselves.\n\nAnother example is your cherry picking 2-8% false accusations rates, numbers at the low extreme, while falsely accusing Glen and others of doing that very same thing and mischaracterizing numbers in the lower mid range, aa numbers in the high range.\n\nYet another example of your cherry picking extreme numbers in the high range is the use of the American NCVS, this is noted to be problematic, and running contrary to 100s of studies that replicate each other, and make up the overwhelming majority of the DV data that's available.\n\n***End***\n\nedit\n\n&gt;I'm sorry, but this is the most hilarious thing I've read all day. The fact that the majority of studies in which the actual resolution of the case is what leads to a rape accusation being declared false does prove the non-existence of a prevalence of false accusations regarding rape.\n\nI never said it did, what I was saying was that reporting data about investigations that are not perusing false allegations, and only report false allegations when they happen across during the course of the investigations of another crime, are not reporting data about investigations in the prevalence of false rape accusations. \n\nVery little research has been done on the prevalence of false rape accusations, the men's movement use the little bit that there is available. That's not the same thing as feminist advocacy research, which is very often more ideological than scientific and designed and produced in order to cover-up, exaggerate, mislead and tell just one half of the story.\n\n&gt;A lot of MRAs believe otherwise - when an influential figure like Glenn Sacks is advocating a 40% figure (contrasted to the 2% of false accusations of other crimes), that is meant to indicate a supposed prevalence of false accusations. The fact that the \"problem\" has not been reliably proven does indicate no reason why it should be taken exceptionally seriously.\n\n\nSo do a lot of mras believe that most rape claims are false (that a false claim about rape is isn't), or do they believe that that its around 41% according to one study?\n\n&gt;This underscores your goal-setting. You criticized advocacy websites on one paragraph and used one as a source on the next.\n\nI criticized you for presenting a deliberately emotive and misleading piece writing, that didn't appear in a peer reviewed journal as one that was. You cited a piece of advocacy research and yes I'm am critical of that.\n\nNote that there is a large difference between non scientific advocacy research that's dressed up as scientific research and produced for a special interest group, and scientific research that has been carried out with no agenda other than trying to find the truth, that appears on a site that advocates. \n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323022853", "subreddit": "AskFeminists", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm going to say this like you're a sophomore in high school. Sorry if I seem to talk down to you. For the experts, I am oversimplifying, yes, but that's the point I think.\n\nConditional Random Fields (CRFs) are called an undirected graphical model. A \"graphical model\" because because it is a model that contains dependencies that are represented by the graph. By \"dependency\" we say that when a node (in the graph) influences the behavior of another node (in the graph) we should draw an edge between those nodes. \"Undirected\" means that the influence goes both ways. \n\nPerhaps the best example I can think of is optical character recognition (OCR). In OCR we have have a camera/scanner that reads characters on a piece of paper. The first step of OCR is to try to match similar symbols. That is, all the markings on the paper that look the same are given the same id. This results in multiple, potentially incorrect ids for each character (because of sloppy handwriting). \n\nFor example: ids '1 2 3 3 4 4' can represent the word 'l e s s e e'. Note that ids 2 and 4 both represent the character 'e'. The problem becomes: how do we go from hundreds of ids to 26 characters?\n\nGraphical models to the rescue!\n\nWe say that words are created by a sequence of characters, that is, the order of characters is important in the construction of a word. In other words, the value of the 2nd character is dependent on the value of the 1st character and the 3rd character, etc.\n\nThus we get a graphical model that looks like this:\n\n    X-Y-Z-W-P-Q\n    | | | | | |\n    1 2 3 3 4 4\n\nwhere the hyphens are undirected edges representing dependencies between characters. That is, character Y depends on character X,Z and id 2 and character Z depends on characters Y,W, and id 3 etc.\n\nWhat I have described can be thought of either a CRF or an HMM. Depending on what you want to do with it.\n\nThe goal of inference on HMMs is to find the best joint probability, as a \"generative model\". In our example this translates to: find the best characters that match *all* of the ids. We do this with techniques that, basically, propagate information through the graph.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that graphs can get very large on actual problems: Consider OCR on an entire document.\n\nCRFs are helpful because they are a discriminative model, in that they do not attempt to find the joint distribution. Instead, CRFs try to find the probability that maximizes the conditional, P(X|**Y**). Where X is the node we are interested in, and **Y** (bold means a set of variables) are the nodes that X depends on. So, in CRFs we only need to look at the neighbors of X to determine the values of X. In our example, this translates to: find the best character for X considering its neighbors **Y** (and repeat for all X): P(X|Y,id1), P(Y|X,Z,id2), etc.\n\nAgain, this is an overly simplified view of the problem. I think that McCallum's paper is the best to overview of the subject: http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/papers/crf-tutorial.pdf\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323104674", "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Haha, fair enough. But there are examples of relatively free markets for music and movies, such as in Hong Kong (before it was integrated back into China). A relative absence of copyright law enforcement resulted in widespread piracy, and thus, extremely cheap and ubiquitous products. It's not a perfect example, as quality often suffered in Hong Kong. But fortunately, we have the legal framework to address both fraud and harm should companies here to do the same. And with pharmaceutical companies forced to compete intensely for much less profit, it's also likely they wouldn't have the arsenal of lawyers on hand they currently use to drag legal challenges through court for years.\n\nHong Kong is a fascinating example, you're right. The thing is, though, much of Hong Kong's markets for media were flooded with bootlegs not of Hong Kong films and music, but films and music from all over the world, particularly the United States. I think if the United States were to be the same way, things might be different because instead of losing one large city, they'd lose the most lucrative country in the world to bootleggers and pirates. Most movies and music make the bulk of their profit here in the US. Imagine movie theaters showing high quality bootlegs without paying the studio back for it's $150 million investment in a movie. While there would be good consequences, like never seeing another movie like Transformers made again, we'd also lose out on The Lord of the Rings and **I N C E P T I O N**. Everything would be very indi, and probably only occasionally in a good way. The same would be true for TV, music, and other media. \n\n&gt;I'll admit that I intentionally avoided mentioning either of these, since I'm not sure I fundamentally agree with either, but for the sake of argument, I think they would both play a large role in scenario I described. To summarize, you'd have the bulk of medical/pharmaceutical research funded by the government and non-profit organizations, and then the private, for-profit sector would compete to offer the solutions as cheaply and ubiquitously as practical.\n\nYou are okay with government funded pharma research? I agree with you, but I don't hear talk like that from libertarians often. In fact, I agree with basically all of this. In a perfect world, medicine would only reach the market by way of doctors. But I'm practically a socialist by American standards. \n\n&gt;Public unions are an entirely different matter. I don't think public workers should have the ability to bargain collectively, as the terms and conditions of their employment is actually supposed to be determined by our elected representatives and not by their ability to strong-arm the government into paying them higher wages. I'm also against mandatory unions (such as the teacher's union). Notice before that I said \"freely associate\" and not \"forced\".\n\nI don't think those nice folks that protested against the legislation were being forced into anything they didn't want to be in. And it's not like the legislation simply makes union membership volunteer... it outright bans public unions. And can't elected representatives be just as bad as upper management in the private sector when it comes to paying an unfair wage and treating workers like garbage? I'm not sure I follow your logic here. \n\n&gt;I think many of the complications involving underpaid public workers (teachers, fire-fighters, etc.) have arisen from the federal usurpation of power that has resulted in drastic misdirection of funds into poorly conceived overseas adventures. If the majority of social responsibilities like education and safety nets had been left entirely to the states, we'd be much better off.\n\nI'd agree with you, only I'm pretty sure Mississippi schools want to teach kids that Charles Darwin ate babies and the earth is a few thousand years old.

{"body": "All points well taken. I think where we might be at odds is elucidated in your third paragraph, and stems from what compound and ternary mean. I recall as an aspiring undergraduate theorist of music, learning the \"simple\" and \"compound\" \"rhythms\" and their types (simple binary, simple ternary, etc.) was all problematic, and are not representative of rhythmic phenomenology. I think I may again be incorrectly defining simple and compound, due to my issue with the standard pedagogy of rhythmic theory. I think by compound I mean based upon hierarchic structures of exclusive 3s and not 2s, especially when combined with 2s (5s and 7s, etc). For this misunderstanding of definitions, I apologize.\n\nAs an example, take these tunes then--Old Smokey and Hickory Dickery--and consider how we can impose a tactus. Old Smokey is very much (to me, and perhaps others) felt in alternating ones and twos. Let's take a look at a 6/8 example, where O's are first and 4th metric position in 6/8, and o's are its subdivisions:\n\nO o o O o o |O o o O o o|\n\n\nThe imposition of 1s and 2s is indicated by large Os, and commonly reported as a phenomenal tactus. You point this out in your second paragraph. But our misunderstanding arises in my thinking that this example is still simple, based on twos. The *subdivisions* of three represent just another level of imposed meter.\n\nMoreover, I think you might be confusing what I mean by \"cognitively demanding\" and \"effort\" by meaning \"difficult.\" This is not the case. What I mean is, if we listen to a sequence of beeps of equally spacing and each beep is the same, studies suggest we are likely--without direction--to impose a binary (1 2 1 2 1 2) organization. It takes effort (albeit just a *little*) to organize them in ternary (1 2 3 1 2 3) (assuming you don't hear it in a larger metric structure of 6/8. which is a new level of decisions). Hard? Probably not. Effort and can involve conscious decisions? Absolutely. If these things are now clear in definition, I think we might agree at the end of the day. \n\n&gt;Compound meters have been around for even longer than simple meters, and at no time have they been less prevalent than simple meters.\n\n&gt;Simple meter was the thing that had to be invented, because compound meter had existed for quite some time. Jehan des Murs was the individual to propose dividing the beat into binary portions (rather than the standard ternary) in 1321. Even after simple meters were invented, though, they were considered secondary to compound meters for quite some time.\n\nI do take issue with this, however, as Jehan des Murs was certainly not the first person to consider organizing periodic sounds into hierarchies of twos. This represents one listening culture at one point in time (comparatively, even not that long ago) and tells us very little about fundamentals of rhythmic perception as a whole through human music making, even in just considering the Western tradition.\n\nEDIT: I also think I just invited what is meant by the Western tradition: do you mean just the *notated* tradition?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323183211", "subreddit": "musiccognition", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Do this for 5 -10 minutes each day when you begin to practice and you'll be playing thirty second notes in no time. \n\nBasically what I'm saying is don't solely rely on songs to learn the fundamentals. Develop warm up exercises, your on the right path if your already acknowledging your own weak points as a player.

{"body": "&gt;While there would be good consequences, like never seeing another movie like Transformers made again, we'd also lose out on The Lord of the Rings and I N C E P T I O N. Everything would be very indi, and probably only occasionally in a good way. The same would be true for TV, music, and other media.\n\nFair point.  I do think that there is yin and a yang to any conceivable system.  If the lack of Lord of the Rings or Inception is the price we'd have to pay to prevent an oligopolistic stranglehold of the arts, I'd say we're getting the better end of the deal.  And who's to say people wouldn't develop brilliant and innovative ways of producing high-quality product on a low budget.  Movies ranging from Resevoir Dogs to Napoleon Dynamite were made with incredibly low budgets, so we know it's possible.  I'm not saying it would be all rainbows and unicorns, but I rather like the thought of a world where art is pursued as the result of artistic motivation rather than purely for profit.\n\n&gt;You are okay with government funded pharma research? I agree with you, but I don't hear talk like that from libertarians often.\n\nNot exactly.  I just meant that if we were to remove intellectual property laws, this would likely be a role the government would assume.  That's not to say I'm entirely opposed to the idea either.  But I'd rather that it be done constitutionally, at the state and local level.\n\n&gt;And can't elected representatives be just as bad as upper management in the private sector when it comes to paying an unfair wage and treating workers like garbage? I'm not sure I follow your logic here.\n\nPerhaps.  But as public servants, shouldn't their wage be up to the public (i.e. representatives)?  Here's an article that I think illustrates this pretty well:\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/18/the-first-blow-against-public-employees/fdr-warned-us-about-public-sector-unions\n\n\"The founders of the labor movement viewed unions as a vehicle to get workers more of the profits they help create. Government workers, however, don’t generate profits. They merely negotiate for more tax money. When government unions strike, they strike against taxpayers. F.D.R. considered this “unthinkable and intolerable.”\"\n\n&gt;I'd agree with you, only I'm pretty sure Mississippi schools want to teach kids that Charles Darwin ate babies and the earth is a few thousand years old. I know I sound like a nanny-state apologist, but should that be allowed to happen?\n\nIsn't that democracy?

{"body": "It sounds like you don't know your way around the fretboard!\n\nCan you quickly find your root notes around the scales?\n\nSee CAGED, although personally I found my way around (painfully) and eventually developed some shortcuts.  The painfulness of figuring it yourself definitely drills it into your head (IMO).  For example, look at your standard tuning.  E A D G B E.  Between the E/D string, is two frets (ignore octaves).  Therefore, say you're playing an A on the 5th fret, E string; A is also found on the 7th fret, D string.  Same for A and G (2 frets).  D and B differ by 3 frets.  G and E differ by 3 frets.  That's a start!  Then you can look at all the other combinations as well (e.g. E to A, A to B, D to E, etc).\n\nDo you know the relative relationships between the root notes and its nearby notes?\n\nLet's take D, 5th fret, A string as the root note.  The note on top is A, 5th fret, E string.  Where else can I find a A?  Oh right!  7th Fret, D string (see: above).  What's the relationship between a D and an A you say?  The A is a perfect 5th above D.  Now you know that the fret immediately above and that if you moved down two frets on the string below - they're both the perfect 5ths from your root!  Repeat for 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 6th, 7th, etc.\n\nAlthough, I must say... my most enlighten playing comes naturally.  Close your eyes, relax, concentrate and focus on what the rest of the people are playing.  Try to imagine what you want to add to the sound.

{"body": "I'll post the thread here as well in case people prefer to stay on reddit.\n\n&gt;Hi Everyone,\n\n&gt;I have quite probably taken more Nitrous (at least in Whippit form) than anyone else alive. So I feel compelled to share with all of you - my experience.\n\n&gt;Excessive Nirous Oxide abuse can cause permanent irreversible brain damage. I am Patient Zero, so please, everyone, read this all the way. If I had been fortunate enough to read what I am about to write, 30 years ago, my life would be very, very different. I could just post the facts, but if you will walk with me through my life, you need never run the risk of having what happened to me, happen to you. If you are a serious Nitrous user, reading this could help save your life. It's going to be quite long - but it is important to me to paint the whole picture. I also hope that it might prove entertaining - and some of you might recognize yourselves in the narrative - and those who feel a sympathy with my feelings - those who relate to my expression and understanding - those who think yes, Yes, YES!! are the ones who need to read this the most - as you are in the greatest danger - or could be if you are not careful. I am being honest about some stuff that I have hidden from others all my life - some of it is quite embarrassing - but I choose to share the humourous aspect with you all. I can't be the *only* lunatic in the world.\n\n&gt;This is *not* an anti-Nitrous post. This is information that has only recently become available. Personally I wish our atmosphere was Oxygen and Nitrous Oxide instead of Oxygen and Nitrogen. So without further ado...\n\n&gt;The tale begins in the dentists chair. I was 9 years old. I had never taken any drugs, and was not looking to at the time. But I had a phobia about dental work, and the new dentist told me that he would give me 'laughing gas', and it would remove my fear. So he attached the mask to my nose and told me to breathe normally. After about 20 seconds I began to feel a tingle, quite pleasant, which was getting stronger with each passing second. The dentist asked me if I could feel the gas yet - and a drug addict was born. I told him \"No, I don't feel anything\", so he turned it up. By now I was really starting to feel *amazing* - it was fantastic. But it was more than just tingles and physical well being. Even though I was only 9, I started seeing patterns - in everything - a deeper connection - set of connections - a lattice that embraced reality, but which had a meaning - a message - beneath the surface - something *important*. The dentist asked me once more if I felt the gas. I told him that it was starting to take effect, but was not very strong - despite the fact that I could barely string the sentence together - as I wanted him to turn it up even more - which he did. The last thing I remember hearing was the dentist saying to the nurse, \"This one likes to fly high\".\n\n&gt;From that moment, I knew that I had to obtain Nitrous Oxide again at some point. I had imaginings of listening to music while feeling that way and how awesome it would be (and I was right, of course). It stuck there - in my memory - unforgettable - I was 9 - and I no longer saw the universe the way that I had before.\n\n&gt;Jump ahead 11 years. I'm 20, and I found acid about six months earlier. I'm in Amsterdam, having left South Africa to avoid military service. I'm a musician and making a living playing street music. We're on acid all the time, taking larger and larger doses each time. It's classic. I'm the messiah and I'm going to save the world by turning everyone onto LSD. I'm Ken Kesey, I'm Ram Dass, I'm Neal Cassidy driving the bus to the next Acid Test. I'm on a mission. I have found the ultimate truth, and I believe that I have the ability to express it. It's straight out of the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. I am The Merry Prankster - doing ever increasing doses of LSD because I believe that there is a reality behind this one, and I am going to evolve and become a transformed being - a metamorphosized, evolutionised, mental telepathical Guru. I even have a following. There are 5 of us - and I am the leader. I'm the fucking chosen one. This is why I am alive - this is why I exist - I am the new Messiah!@!\n\n&gt;It's funny looking back on it now - a bit embarrassing (OK - a lot) - and I have never told *anyone* about this before - like who would admit this shit - but it's important to paint the whole picture.\n\n&gt;But LSD is not a beast to be tamed. Oh, I *believed* that I was in control of the acid - that *I* held the reigns. I had become it's master, and it's servant. But I was treating it disrespectfully - and when you do that, the Acid inevitable turns around and slaps you down a peg or two. In my case it was all the way down from my lofty delusions of grandeur, to a smear on the roadside. A new acid had come out - called simply \"Mandala\" (Amsterdam 1981). The dealer told me that it was not 'commercial' acid, a bit stringer. And to boot, a *half* a hit was a whole. I had been dropping between 5 and 10 at a time, and I did not assume that this half hit of new acid was going to top my multiple ingestions from the weeks before.\n\n&gt;But I learned that day that what I had been taking was not truly LSD - but a pale shadow of what *real* LSD is. All my research - all my dosing - nothing - had prepared me for what happened. It was *phenomenal* acid - I had never seen such colours - and it warped dimensions that I did not recognise anything around me. It was too much for downtown Amsterdam, so we all jumped on a tram, laughing uncontrollably all the way home. Once home it was even sronger, having really kicked in. I made a big hashish pipe and took a huge hit of really good Afgan hash.\n\n&gt;And then I completely lost my mind.\n\n&gt;I had to reconstruct it all afterward, with the help of my friends. There was a huge flash - and reality had shattered - literally. It was as though everything I had been seeing was made of glass - like a mirror, and the hashish exploded the acid so hard and fast, that I suffered a psychotic break. More to the point - from one moment to the next I had total amnesia. I was with my closest friends - a girl who had come over to Europe with me who was like my sister - I had known them all for years - but I recognized no-one. And I did not know who I was - or where I was (and I don't mean which town - I mean which *Universe*). I was a total blank - wiped clean - nothing left. I realized that I was bleeding - in my throat - it had turned to glass - and shattered - blood was everywhere, and my life started slipping away - I collapsed slowly to the floor - and died.\n\n&gt;However, a while later I appeared to be conscious. SO this was it - I was dead. This must then be the afterlife. A man walked up to me and looked at me curiously - and then said \"Are you OK?\" But what I heard was \"A R E Y O U O K A Y\" in a kind of deep Twilight Zone surrealism. Who *was* this person. If I was dead - perhaps he was me - a reflection of me - on the other side of the shattered mirror that was reality - so I said \"Who *are* you?\" And he said to me \"You know who I am\" - which I heard in a big boomy voice as \"Y O U K N O W W H O I A M!!!\" The poor guy - he didn't have a clue what was going on - none of them had actually realized yet that I had quite literally lost my mind - all of it. So I deduced that if he were me - a kind of 'afterlife' version - that we would have the same mother as I - so in an attempt to confirm this I asked him \"who is your mother\", to which he replied \"You know who my mother is...\" which I heard as....\n\n&gt;OK - you get the picture. I treated LSD as though it was something that I actually had control over - that I was bigger than Acid - that I was beyond a bad trip. I will end this part of the tale of this day here, but know that it took the rest of the day to reconstruct my *basic* ego - just knowing who and where I was. I still felt broken glass in my throad from where it had shattered when the 'mirror' shattered. I could no longer sing. When I tried I was overwhelmed by an abject terror, and shut down. It was weeks before I could sing again (which I needed to do to survive) - and I continued to have terrifying Flashbacks for the next 6 months.\n\n&gt;This was the most phenomenally life changing experience of my entire life. I was afraid - afraid to do acid - I had been so humbled - so beaten - so kicked in the teeth - any 'normal' person would have just said \"That's it! Never again!!\". But I could not do that - live in fear the rest of my life, because i had experienced this overwhelming and incomprehensible annihilation of ego. I had to face my fear. I had to get back in the drivers seat - I had to understand what had happened in order to be whole again. And there was born a true and devout Acidhead - for life (still going strong). I needed to *understand* myself - how my brain worked - and LSD was the tool that had both damaged and which would repair me.\n\n&gt;The experience kind of put a crim p in my plan to save the world, as I realized that it was *completely* unethical to turn anyone on unless they truly desired to be turned on. It was a full year before in mid winter, Christmas time in Konstanz, Germany, that I did my next truly supurb LSD - only this one was as soft as the other one had been hard - and finally - utterly high, I looked in the mirror and was no longer afraid. I finally had all of my mind back - and my fear was gone (but my respect has never faltered).\n\n&gt;And now the long awaited return to the topic of Nitrous Oxide.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323334330", "subreddit": "Drugs", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

It's silly to downvote someone because they shared an experience they had in game.\n\nNow, @karnoculars, you're already talking about level 6 and beyond. One of Udyr's greatest strengths is his lack of an ulti. From 1-5 Udyr has a rather sizable advantage (going W E W Q W, leveling W first, Q second, and E third) in that he can see when you are about to frenzy him, turtle up, and retaliate with a tiger DoT. Going cloth 5 pot gives you immense sustain while doing this, and you should be able to focus solely on farming with minimal interruptions for trading damage.\n\nAgain, this is anecdotal, as I've only played this lane once, but if you play Udyr pseudo-passively like this, focusing on farming, you can at worst be even with the Voli. In my case, I was actually zoning him just by farming and popping bear occasionally to scare him off. Getting Ninja Tabi and Wriggle's makes you tanky vs his damage, give you sustain, and some DPS. I don't see how a Voli would be able to trade with you in that situation. Combine that with Udyr's (OP) ability to escape (turtle bear turtle bear until you're safe) and you have an unbeatable laning opponent.\n\nUdyr's biggest (arguably only) weakness is his necessity to be in melee range to do ANYTHING. Volibear doesn't have anything in his kit that allows ranged harass, so he can't really beat Udyr in lane.\n\nTL;DR- Udyr's E stance is Udyr wearing Voli as a hat.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323381718", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Former UC music prof here FWIW, probably nothing :-)  The other guys in the thread have given the best advice - the best way to learn how to harmonize is to listen to music that uses a lot of harmonization and gradually pick it up from example.  But, if the technical version would be of any use to you, here goes.\n\nMost normal sounding tunes are created using the seven tones of a scale, referred to with the numbers 1 through 7.  So, for example, a C Major scale (using only the white keys on the piano) has the notes C D E F G A B, then back to C, and we refer to those notes with numbers so that C=1, D=2, E=3 etc.  \n\nMost of the time a melody constructed from scale tones will be accompanied by harmony (chords) that are also built from those same seven tones.  Each chord is built on a scale tone by adding the notes a 3rd and a 5th higher than each tone, so the chord built on scale tone 1 consists of notes 1, 3 and 5 (C, E and G in the C Major scale).  The chord on scale tone 2 uses the notes 2, 4 and 6 (i.e. D, F and A), chord 3 uses 3, 5, 7 etc. etc.  \n\nMost of the notes in any melody will usually be a member of whichever chord is playing at any particular time.  So if a song starts with a measure that uses the chord built on 1, the melody for most of the measure will most likely use scale tones 1, 3 or 5.  To add variety to the melody composers will usually pass between the chord tones of any particular measure using scale tones not in the chord ([nonchord tones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonchord_tone) if you're interested, but probably a bit too technical right now) - but most of the melody notes in any measure will mainly use the notes from the chord playing in that measure.  \n\nWhen we talk about \"harmonization\" in the context of a song tune, it means the process of adding another melody line to support the main tune - and that second melody also uses mainly the notes from whichever chord is used in that melody.  \n\nAs an example we could look at a \"round\" song, because (** in their most basic form) these only use a single chord for the whole song made from scale tones 1, 3 and 5.  An example of a round is \"Three Blind Mice\" (**this actually uses the chords built on 1 and 5, but for the sake of example let's imagine it only uses the chord on 1 using scale tones 1, 3 and 5).  The first melody starts with the words Three Blind Mice on the scale tones 3, 2, 1.  When the first melody moves on to the next measure (See how they run - using scales tones 5, 4, 3) the second harmonizing melody sings the first measure (Three Blind Mice on scale tones 3, 2, 1).  This fits with the 1st singer because both melodies are mainly using notes of chord one (1, 3, 5) - 2 and 4 are used only briefly to move between the chord tones (1, 3 and 5).  Then a third melody comes in harmonizing the first two melodies because it is again mainly using notes of the chord etc. etc.  Try it out.  Another example of a tune that works the same way is \"London's Burning\".  \n\nSo - if you want to harmonize any melody, the easiest way is to sing notes from the chord in any particular measure - and usually you'll want to be singing a different chord tone from the main melody.  So if the main melody starts with a measure using chord 1 and the tune goes 5, 5, 3, you could harmonize that by singing the same rhythm and words, but on scale tones 3, 3, 1 - does that make sense?  \n\nObviously most songs use more than one chord, but the most frequently used chords are the ones built on scale tones 1, 5 and 4 (i.e. 1,3,5 - 5,7,2 and 4,6,1) - \"harmonization\" is the process of figuring out which chord is being used in which measure and singing a member of the chord that is different from that used by the melody.  \n\nWhen you start out harmonizing, you can just stick entirely to chord tones so you can't go wrong.  Usually the harmony line will follow the same basic shape as the melody (and the harmony notes will often be a 3rd above the melody or a 6th below the main melody).  As you become more confident you can add some nonchord tones (again usually following the same basic shape of the main melody).  \n\nSorry if this all sounds confusing and technical.  Please do PM me if you would like any further explanation or examples.  I'm sure you already know more about harmonization than you think you do, but it can't hurt to know a little bit about the theory.  Best of luck :-)\n\nEdit 1: Clarifications indicated with **", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323506257", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

That a European Financial Transaction Tax would effect the UK disproportionately, for a problem that has essentially been born out of the Euro.\n\nThe UK government had already said months back that it does not object to a global Tobin tax but a European transaction tax would see London financiers move to Asia and the US.  I don't see how that's good for France or Germany either.\n\n&gt;**[A]n agreement to let Britain enforce bank capital requirements that are HIGHER than the proposed European maximum.**\n\nI like the idea of banks having to have more capital.  I don't like bailing banks out.  If Britain wants to go higher, set the beam higher, I don't really see why France and Germany should flinch.  Are they really suggesting that British banking should be LESS secure so it is more comparable to mainland European banks?  That's ridiculous.\n\nOf course Britain should be allowed to set itself a *higher* standard if it should choose.\n\n&gt;**[A]n agreement that the new European Banking Authority should remain in London.** \n\nIf Britain had chosen to go with the reform surely the point would have been to improve stability.  In the event of it going through it would have made sense to keep things that were working and established where they were.  I can't really see what could be gained by moving it.  It's an hour or so from Brussels and in the heart of the world's number one financial centre.\n\n&gt;**[P]rotection from EU regulation of London-based US financial institutions that do not trade with the rest of Europe.**\n\nWhen in Rome, as the Romans do.  If the Yanks don't want part of Europe-proper don't make them privy to European regulation.  That Britain wanted to be able to retain a personal relationship with the US and to let Americans worry about American banks.\n\n&gt;**[A] written guarantee – making explicit what is already the case – that unanimity should apply to any proposed “user charges” for financial groups, including any variant of the controversial European financial transactions tax.**\n\nSo basically a love letter for something that is already happening.\n\nEvery one of those points is genuinely both fair and in the interest of Great Britain.  I don't really see how poor, little UK two-tiered Europe has come off bad.  At all.  I know words like 'outside', 'two-tier', and 'cold' sound negative but *outside* is good when you're talking about a prison, a hospital or a mental asylum.  Outside is where I want to be.  'Two-tier' sounds apart, alienated; I like to think on it as exclusive,  above the rest.  Don't think of it as not being part of the crowd, think of it as having your own balcony at the opera.  Cold.  Cold is exactly what I like when talking about financial meltdowns.  Cold's a good place to be.  Britain likes cold.  It's used to it.  But we're not really out in the cold, we're out in the drizzle.  I like drizzle even more.  I even like the word.  It's mellifluent: *d r i z z l e*.  When people with their heads on fire are running around screaming, \"The UK is going to be left in the cold!\" I think of the word drizzle, close my eyes, and take in a deep breath as I  imagine the smell of freshly mown grass and petrichor.  Yes, Britain has stepped outside into the drizzle to have a cigarette whilst the rest of the European types sort out the mess they created.\n\nI guess you can say I'm okay with what Dave did.\n\nhttp://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8bd8f388-21cf-11e1-8b93-00144feabdc0.html", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323531840", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Four Arms, four blades, no soul, no more.\n\nThe first thing that popped into my head was Zelda four swords, maybe not.  \nThe 2nd thing was a boss in Final Fantasy there's a boss named Kary, the fiend of fire, who has 4 arms and four swords, being a demon probably no soul, and you kill her.  Kind of obscure, not really relevant.  \nThe third thing that comes to mind is a helicopter.  Starting to think I'm just grasping at straws.  \nAn alternative theory I have is that each line is for one letter.  This letter could be X or H or K.  X signifies crossing something off, meaning it's no more, and letters don't have souls.\n\n&gt;Two lives, two towers, no purpose, no being.\n\nMy letters theory fails here, kind of.  U V W M N Y all would work for \"two towers\" but nothing else really fits.  Maybe W works the best because it's \"Double You\" for two lives?  Letters don't have a being... but they do have a purpose.\nThere are some areas in Skyrim that have two towers, but I haven't played it yet, so I don't know how the rest of it would fit.\nLord of the Rings seems fitting except there was a big purpose to that journey.\n\n\n&gt;One arm, one hero, no head, no tale.\n\nMy letters theory kind of fits here, but not quite.  'O' fits for no head no tail, but it doesn't fit since it was supposed to be tale in the first place and is not misspelled.  Could be a dual meaning?  Most likely fit for my letters theory then is XWO...  a wrestling organization, denomination for extinct languages, or Kimball, NE airport.  No dice I think.\nThere's a horror movie named \"Headless Hero\" but it's also a foreign language film, so probably not relevant.\n\nCan't think of anything else atm.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323544467", "subreddit": "secretsanta", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Since its how you identify elements. Since when you put them to a flame or make filiments out of them like sodium lamps, you get dark lines (or conversely bright lines if you are looking at emission spectra) that correspond to wavelengths and the \"gap\" between the lines will be unique to each element because its the electron shell transistions which cause them. \n\nIf you also did Chemistry A level you'd know electron sub-shells are given different letters; S P D F G H I...\n\nThese come from spectroscopic notion. Sharp, Polarised, Defuse, because of how these lines looked in a spectrometer. \n\nThis is also how we can calculate how far objects are away from us via Red/Blue shift. Because the ratio of the distance between the emission/absoprtion lines is always constant so you can tell how shifted somethings light is. \n\nSpectrometry is an important and beautiful thing. When you get down to things like Fourier Transformations and you can tell, just by maths, the shape of something millions of lightyears away from the patterns apparent in the light it sends off. Especially when people thought before it was possible that we would never know anything about the chemical composition of things we couldn't touch and feel. I don't have any patience for it Im afraid. Too mathy and too fiddly in lab work as anyone who has used a Michealson-Interferometer will attest. But there is an absurd amount of information available just in the light something gives off. \n\nBut the point is if someone was compiling a list of optical physicists Fraunhoffer would undoubtedly be on there.

Now that I think about it, it's probably tied with **Torches** as my second favorite album because it's really a perfect rap/hip hop album.

I can identify with many of the themes present on the album and it just *gets* me. \n\n\n**W H O K I L L** by the Tune-Yards is a close runner up, because they are doing something so unique and special...it's really unbelievable.

A few notes: Many of the albums had several different listings, however, I only included the top vote getters because most of the additional entries only had a few votes, and this method eliminates the potential for multiple votes for a CD by each person; in the case where there was a 2nd entry with a substantial amount of votes, I included the 2nd entries number of votes with an asterix and did not include this in the total I used to determine placement; furthermore, since I do not have a Reddit account and was unable to wade through all the comments (I had some 1800 left before I gave up), I was unable to find Manchester Orchestra within the to 5200 comments, so it could be taken into account that their CD may be underrepresented. Now, I am new to Reddit, so I hope this will suffice. I am still learning the conventions of the website. My motive for doing this was that I noticed Portugal. the Man's CD had gained in the rankings and it was not taken into account on mehrdotcom's list. I feel they had the best CD of 2011. For all intensive purposes, the first 40 on the list should be accurate, but Since I only down the list to number 60 or so, the end of the list could be slightly off.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323803388", "subreddit": "Music", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to work at a bank that stayed open on Saturdays until noon, but it was only open in the drive-through. I, a twenty-year-old Caucasian woman, was working with my good friend, a twenty-five-year-old African American woman. One minute before closing time, a gentleman pulled up, requesting change. I happily obliged while my co-worker started shutting down computers (since giving change does not require a computer) and counting the registers. When noon hit, she switched the outside and insides lights off (to indicate that we were, without a doubt, now closed). \n\nIt took several minutes to count out this man's change; he wanted precise bills because he was running a yard sale or going to a strip club or something. By the time I was done, the time was 12:10. I sent his money back, he thanked me and drove off, and I shut down the telecom system that lets us talk to people in the drive-through. Just as the silver of his bumper disappears from our window, an older blue car speeds into the lane. \n\nMy co-worker, who has already shut down her system and locked up her drawers, told me to lock up my box while she reminded this new customer that we had been closed for ten minutes. I do as requested; I am just slightly visible to the customer as I put my box in the main safe. My co-worker restarts the telecom system and tells this 30-something black woman that we have been closed for ten minutes. The woman, of course, gets mad. My co-worker is very polite and professional, explaining that we would be more than happy to help her on Monday, but we don't even have access to the money anymore; it's locked up and the computers are off. \n\nThe customer insists on arguing, claiming that we helped that other guy, so we should have to help her, too. My co-worker keeps cool and polite, which enrages this customer even more. She shrieks unintelligibly and peels out. Keep in mind that I spoke not one word to this woman.\n\nOn Monday, when I come into work and have forgotten about the incident, my sweet, sweet manager (who also happened to be black), calls me into his office. He tells me that a customer called the corporate office on Saturday afternoon, complaining that a white teller refused to do her transaction because she was black. She said I helped the white man in the car in front of her, but I absolutely refused to help her.\n\nI was a s t o n i s h e d. I hadn't even sneezed while that woman was there; she only saw my pale face bobbing in the background. My manager told me he knew I had done nothing wrong, but he had to tell me about it because of the bank's policies. My co-worker thought the whole incident was hilarious, and to make me feel better, claimed the rest of the day that anything I did was racist. She still, from time to time, claims that I am not handing her a tissue because I am racist. :)\n\nThe woman, by the way, got nothing out of the incident except making herself mad and making my co-worker and I better friends.\n\nTLDR: A customer reported me as a racist because she came our store after it was closed.

{"body": "Uhh, NO. \nIt's targeting the UNLOYAL, foreign born, naturalized, dangerous jihadi type of US Citizen.\n The reason we have that, is the democrats, and their insane left wing commie love all utopian stupidity has since Ted Kennedy belched out his drunken 1965 \"immigration reform act\" slowly but surely DESTROYED the surety that becoming a US Citizen required showing and proving loyalty to the USA, the language, the culture, the society, and the belief system.\n\n The ANSWER IS, the enemy is already here, and THEY HAVE US CITIZENSHIPS under their belts.\n\n Don't bet DIME ONE that hundreds and thousands haven't been granted since 911.\n\n Now, will the eeeevil government use it against dissenters as well ? Obviously by what you stated it will very definitely have a chilling affect, and we well know that the system is always abused to some extent, that includes every law ever written, so of course there will be some of it going on.\n\n That doesn't negate the REAL FEAR our congressional whores in power have under their belts - because many of them KNOW the criminally INSANE loose as a loon US Citizenship policy they've coddled and supported over many decades that has only gotten weaker and weaker even since 911.\n The argument over Obama's status is a case in point or perfect example. Obama was a citizen of Britain until age 21 and we also know for a fact a citizen of Indonesia for at least 4 years. Until Obama, no POTUS has ever held a foreign citizenship IN THEIR LIFETIME save the grandfathering in clause the Founding Fathers only enjoyed when the Constitution was adopted. \n\nSo what we really have is watered down and LOOSE as a whore citizenship policy, and therefor, our leaders in the know well realize that when they pick up a US Citizen, foreign born and raised, wackadoo jihadi terrorist, they're going to need the \"provision\" they want to pass so badly to \"deal with them\" as \"they see fit\".\n\n This is what we're dealing with.\n The convenient after effects like being able to crush dissidents with it is just an added bonus they surely all must cherish in their minds and in their hearts, since of course, they certainly consider themselves the most lovely and loyal and patriotic persons the nation has ever known - therefor the much lesser thans and those not of their pristine wave the flag stature surely deserve such treatment...\n\n Yes, it's bad, but once again, our lunatic and drunken drug addled democratic CRAP PARTY let loose the hard lined immigration and citizenship rules with Ted Kennedy and their ten thousand tribes tent mantras for many decades, AND HAVE THEREFORE BROUGHT THIS CRIME UPON US ALL. \n I see that clear as a bell. I'm certain it's the same insane loons that are screaming the loudest now.\n Well, they should have thought about the certain consequences to come when they were singing kumbaya and cracking open the nation as they spewed out give up your poor and hungry and said things for the past decade like \"everyone is an immigrant\" (meaning every US Citizen is the same thing - so of course ANYONE can be a US Citizen)\n\n The destroyed the exclusivity of US Citizenship - so now the protection the Constitution has provided for so long shall be CRUSHED.\n That's what happens when you foolishly open the door to every sort of worldwide riff raff there is as you proclaim your pure heart and non biggotted love for all mankind... and scream the old boy white European CANCER invaded this continent and destroyed the population and took over...\n Yes, you have invited in the enemy with your arms open, your holiest of holier than thou tag on your shoulders and all over blubbering pieholes and public appearances, and BECAUSE OF THAT WE WILL ALL LOSE OUR RIGHT IN THIS CASE.\n\n Thanks, you god for saken idiots.\n It was, I N E V I T A B L E.\n Consequences ARE COMING.\nCongratulations !", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323867953", "subreddit": "politics", "score": -26, "controversiality": 0}

They'd all used it, but then again that might just be because they were all cheap bastards.  \n\nPut yourself forward for Uni?  I was referring to [UCAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCAS) which deals with university applications.  You will need some qualifications for that, from either a college or a night school. Typically these are going to be 'A-levels' and are two year courses, but there's nothing stopping you from doing them in one if you want to apply yourself, or even 6 months, or even just registering for the exam and turning up on day one if you're confident enough/smart enough/determined  and disciplined enough to self-teach.  Most students take 3 subject A-levels plus a General Studies A-level (which there is no real study for and a free throwaway one).  You don't even have to wait until you're in the UK.  You can buy A-level study guides on Amazon, but some A-levels have a reputation of being easier than others; Maths, Biology or English Lit for example are going to have more kudos attached to them than say Business Studies or Drama.  I suppose it all depends on what you want to study and when -  there's probably other ways of getting in.  I'm just saying what I know and did myself.\n\n&gt;If what I read is correct I'm only eligible for student loans if I've been a resident for 3+ years so other than that I don't think I could afford it.\n\nThat's perfect if you're serious.  Come over enjoy the summer.  Make some mates, get a job, get pissed, take a nightcourse or do some homestudy.  Slap a couple of A-levels in and after you've been here for nearly two years start applying because at the end of three years, the start of the next academic year you'll qualify.\n\nIf it was me, and some people might laugh at this, I know exactly what I'd do if you're reasonably physically fit and I were you,  join the circus....Nah, I'm shitting with you....but I'd seriously consider joining the [police](http://www.police-recruitment.com/Police-Entry-Requirements.php) because the pay for not having a degree is pretty alright and they'll even pay you whilst they train you, and it'll be shift work so you could move work around your studies.   I know, yeah, it's the p o l i c e,  but so what...and it aint going to hurt your university application any! As long as you've not been a naughty boy in the past I should imagine they'll snap your hands off.   \n\nBut, yeah, fuck it.  If you feel life's going nowhere what've you got to lose?  At least you'll have a hangover and a story.  Thing is with being a backpacker not having any friends or not knowing anyone won't be a problem.  As soon as you walk into the backpacker's hostel eveyone's in the same boat and you just make some.  But mostly I'm more of a 'fuck it' attitude, don't mind getting my feet wet, and just bodge away at something until I understand it a little better.  \n\nI say put your best foot forward and jump.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323878356", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't play much ranked this season but I consider myself a pretty good player, with most of my fav. heroes high skill cap types (cass, nid, leesin).\n\nAll my games tonight I played against other Ahris (who would of known) and destroyed them all.\n\nIt's not that shes OP but in the right hands, she's quite strong.\n\nMy build is 21/0/9 and all ability power and mana regen yellow.\n\nI start with dorans and have virtually unlimited mana to farm and punish the enemy when they step too close to the minions.\n\nI rush straight deathcap since I don't need survivability with her passive in a solo lane, and I don't need to slow the enemy when I just go for the nuke.\n\nMost of the time I punish the mid from a single mistake which is I land a charm near my tower, and finish the entire combo R R W Q R ignite.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* High mobility\n* High burst\n* True damage\n* Long range\n* Autoattack is very fast animation for getting last hits\n* Little mana problems\n* Fast cooldowns on all spells\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* Low health, like all mages vulnerable when stunned (use high mobility)\n* I don't see lots of variation in item builds (yet)\n\nTips:\n\n* When ganking, save charm till lined up\n* When team fight, charm can initiate\n* When defending, use charm at towers and walk back if too close\n* Eat spell shields like Sivir and Nocturne by using dash to catch up, then nuke\n* Save ultis during teamfights to dodge other ultis and free from attackers\n* Charm chasers when you are about to die, they will walk toward you anyway to get the kill but cant use skills when charmed.\n\nItems: (high AP/HP)\n\n* Doran's Ring\n* Blasting Wand\n* Shoes\n* Death Cap\n* ROA\n* Ryali's\n\nReasoning: play like an assasin, if you ever get stunned, flash, dash, dash, dash\n\nI saw other posts about her falling off late game, and since I've snowballed all my games I can't really call that a lie.\n\nFrom the picture though you can see, lots of kills, tied for most assists, and almost 300 minions in 37 minutes (and had 1st blood).\n\nI truly think she will eventually be nerfed, not in 2 weeks but in the 1 month like they usually take.\n\nIt's not her damage that's too rediculous, it just seems that way when she's fed.\n\nTo balance her I would hope they up her mana costs a little so she has to actually choose between farming and hitting heroes, being that her Q is Oriana's Q on steroids.\n\nWhen laning against her, imagine that she plays like Oriana + Ezreal.\n\nThe funny paradigm is if you stay near minions, they will absorb W E R, but they allow her to Q both you and the minions.\n\nMy recommendation is when she misses a Q, not just uses do your damage and get out.\nMost will be maxing Q first, but it does have a low cooldown.\n\n\nJust thought I'd share my 2 cents with the community on this new character.\n\n**Edit:** /Facepalm, downvoted for trying to give solid input to the community so sad people.\n\n**Edit2:** For everyone like OMG It's coz Mejais! A lategame Mejais, does not cause 7000 more gold than their Ahri. I built Dorans, Shoes, DeathCap, ROA 1st.

{"body": "OK, here is a start.\n\nWe are given a box of dimensions A x B x C and we want to know the smallest square sheet of paper that will completely cover the box. Let the square have sides of length S. Let A, B, and C be assigned values such that A&gt;=C and B&gt;=C.\n\nIt seems to me that a rectangle sheet of paper (call it R) with dimensions (A+C) by 2(B+C) will completely cover the box with minimal overlap (wastage). The minimum overlap (wastage) would be 2C^2 . (Note: in the diagonal case described below the overlap can be adjusted on four all corners of R such that S can be reduced; however, I am going to ignore this optimization for now.)\n\nR can be oriented within the square so that a side of the square is parallel to a side of R. Call this the P orientation. Alternatively, R can be oriented within the square so that a diagonal of the square is parallel to the longer side of R. Call this the D orientation.\n\nIf (A+C) = 2(B+C) then S = (A+C) is the smallest square (P orientation) and there is minimal wastage.\n\nIf (A+C) &gt; 2(B+C) then as 2(B+C)/(A+C) approaches zero, S approaches (A+C)/sqrt(2) (D orientation) and taken to the extreme as both 2(B+C)/(A+C) and C/A approach zero, S approaches A/sqrt(2) (D orientation and there is maximal wastage.\n\nIf A=B=C (ie the box is a cube) then S=4A is the smallest square (P orientation) because S=6A/sqrt(2) ~ 4.24A with the D orientation.\n\nI think the question is asking, what is S(A,B,C) meaning given values for A, B and C, what is the smallest possible S? Another useful function is SO(A,B,C) which produces either P or D as the orientation resulting in the smallest possible S. I suspect that the formula for S(A,B,C) will have to determine S for each orientation then return the smaller. I do not know what this formula is yet; perhaps it will occur to me later or perhaps not.\n\nAnother potentially interesting question might be, what is W(A,B,C,O) meaning given values for A, B, C and O, what is the smallest wasted area of paper?  Note: O stands for orientation and can have values of P or D.\n\nEdit: corrected a mistake in the 'approaches zero' case.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1323964890", "subreddit": "cheatatmathhomework", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Remember that scales are simply collections of pitches.  Scales are formed by patterns.  With a Major scale, you start on the root of your scale (if it's G Major it will be G natural) and go up the keys in the following pattern: **W W H W W W H**.  The W's represent whole steps (two note jump) and the H's represent half steps (one note jump).  So, as you start from G, you will have the following notes: **G A B C D E F# G**.  You got from the first G to the A by going a whole step, got from the A to the B with a whole step, B to C with a half step, etc.\n\nMinor scales work the same way, except there are a couple types of minors.  A Natural Minor scale uses the following pattern, starting on the root note: **W H W W H W W**.  A Harmonic Minor scale is the same as a Natural Minor scale except you raise the 7th scale degree (note).  So the pattern looks like: **W H W W H (W+H) H**.  I used the \"W+H\" to represent a three note jump (from the sixth to the seventh scale degree).  There's another Minor scale called Melodic Minor but I won't take time to explain that here.  Wikipedia is your friend!\n\nSo, if we had a scale based on E, the different scales would have the following notes:\n\n* Major: **E F# G# A B C# D# E**\n* Natural Minor: **E F# G A B C D E**\n* Harmonic Minor: **E F# G A B C D# E** (notice the larger gap between C and D#)\n\nThere are plenty of other scales besides Major and Minor as well.\n\nEDIT: Also, notice how the white keys on a piano naturally form a Major scale based on C, and naturally form a Minor scale based on A.  This is because the Major and Natural Minor scales are two different [modes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode).  Any Major scale can be obtained from a transposition of the C Major scale, and any Natural Minor scale can be obtained through a transposition of the A Minor scale.\n\n**FURTHER EDIT:** You really could just look up the articles on major and minor scales on Wikipedia and get a better explanation than I gave you.

and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he

The  \nCourt  is however not satisfied that the manoeuvres complained o f ,  in the \ncircumstances  in  which  they were held,  constituted  o n   the part  of  the \nUnited States a breach, as against Nicaragua, of  the principle forbidding \nrecourse  to the  threat  o r  use of  force\n\nMilitary actions alone do not constitute a use of force unless they are applied to another state.\n\n&gt; Even \nassuming that  the suppl y  of arms  to  the  o pposition  in El S a l v a d o r  could b e  \ntreated a s  imp u t a b l e  t o  t h e  G o v e r n m e n t  of Nicaragua. t o j u s t i f y  invocation \no f   t h e  right  of  collective self-defence  in  c u s t oma r y   i n t e r n a t i o n a l   law, it \nwould  have  t o   be  e q u a t e d   with  a n   a rme d   a t t a c k   by  Ni c a r a g u a   o n   El \nSalvador.

A lineman couldn't have replaced the receiver in that play because he isn't allowed to do anything with the ball unless there is a fumble or tipped pass.  What they could have done is put the center (or any lineman) over the ball and had him snap it to the receiver who then lateraled to the QB behind the rest of the line, but they would have needed another receiver on the line of scrimmage to his left to make it a legal formation. \n\nThe 9ers ran an unbalanced line tackle eligible play against Cleveland earlier this year.  It wasn't quite as extreme as the swinging gate, but it's the same concept.  A tackle reported eligible then lined up in his normal tackle spot with the ineligible tackle to the other side of the line.

{"body": "OK, I think you're missing part of the story, which is why the answers haven't been really answering your question...\n\nTriads do *not* sound stronger in second inversion.  They sound much weaker, in fact, because the fourth is an unstable interval that wants to resolve to the third.  If you have, for example, C F A as your F major triad, the interval C-F wants to resolve down to C-E.  The fifth of the chord, the C on the bottom, is pulling the other notes to resolve.  Since you hear every note in relationship to the bass of the chord, C F A is an issue while F C F A isn't -- in that case, you hear the C as the fifth of F and the other F as the octave rather than the fourth of C.\n\nHOWEVER, what Mark Levine is getting at is that in *slash chords*, the triad sounds better in second inversion.  F sounds very unstable as C F A, but F/G *should* be voiced G C F A (by the way, this is a G11 as well).  My own analysis of why is that the close position second inversion is the weakest voicing that has all of the notes close together.  So you get the *sound* of the F major chord but it doesn't take over the chord from the G.  If you voiced it G A C F, it would sound like an F major chord with the 9th in the bass, and G F A C would sound like an F major chord with a non-harmonic G in the bass.  G C F A is the only voicing that doesn't have F as its root.\n\nThere's a lot more to be analyzed about this, so if you have any additions (or subtractions), I'd love to hear them.

{"body": "Sure let me give it a shot. The theory of evolution believes that life just evolved over billions of years. They dont care about how the building blocks of life came about before things started evolving because deep down they know that something had to created even the \"basic\" building blocks, because although they may be \"basic\" they are still complex. \n\nSo evolutionist to escape the nonsense of their theory, detach the beginning and call it a separate process of abiogenesis. By doing that they can side step ANY AND ALL questions that ask about the start. Because having to explain the complexities of the beginning would lead them to a realization they dont want to admit that there is a creator. But if you ask a evolutionist if they every watch movies after skipping the first third they will say no, if you ask them if there is anything else in life that they do or beleive in that necessitates them skipping the beginning of it, they will say no. You see the stupidity in their beleifs?\n\nSo evolutionist and beleivers in their quest to mislead themselves and others, have proposed a whole range of silly theories none of which has been proven either. Their other \"beginning\" theories are an asteroids with alien matter or as I call it alien poop landed on the earth and started life. Or evolutionist like to say life just started in a primordial pool, but as you see below science has never found self replicating RNA, self forming. The other theory I like to throw out there is it was dino poop, yeah the dino poop coming before life evolved into dinosaurs doesn't make sense and is not meant to, it is just meant to show how stupid evolution is that they can build a whole theory upon something that doesn't even have a proven beginning. \n\nNow before you think you have another mis-informed christian.\n\nFrom Christian based journals I have read about DNA, it is very complex. But before I get into that, I would like to preface my thought with DNA coding being a form of higher information. As DNA controls all the process in the living organism. The fact information is present shows there has to be a higher life form of that \"wrote\" or \"programed\" the coding. More on that later.\n\nBeside the experiment in 1953' by Dr. Stanley Miller trying to spark a bunch of gasses to produce some basic amino acids that \"could\" have lead to \"life\". The fact of the matter is he only produce a few amino acids. They have never in any experiment found that nucleotides were ever present in their findings. Nucleotides are different then amino acids and is also just as important for life, they are smaller and more complex then RNA molecules.  Scientists have never ever found evidence of a self replicating RNA molecule randomly assembling in some pool of chemical building blocks. The consensus is minuscule, for that to actually take place in the wild would take \"luck\". Luck is not what science is built on.\n\nNext protein molecules they are made up of as few as 50 or several millions amino acids bound together not randomly but in a specific order, some say highly specific order. The average functional protein in a simple cell contains 200 amino acids bound in a specific order. The chance of having some protein with only 100 amino acids in the right sequences, form on earth all by itself has been calculated as one in a millions-billions.\n\nYet you need protein to create RNA. Hubert P Yockey a scientist says its is impossible to think that proteins came before the RNA, because you need RNA to create the proteins.\n\nNow on to DNA\n\nFor a cell to survive you need RNA, DNA and proteins. How can life come about when you cannot lack even one of those they all need to be present? Like I said about DNA is a higher form of information, instruction. This high form of information just happens to have its own alphabet A T G C ,\"words\"(condons) that form \"sentence structures\"(stories). The average gene has 27,000 letters that happen to complied themselves logically in \"chapters\" of sorts (chromosomes) and it takes 23 chromosomes to make a book. Would a \"book\" this complex really have no author?\n\nThis is all on top of the fact only certain letters of the genetic \"alphabet\" will go together G-C, A-T that's it! Where did the instruction for how DNA behaves come from? Trial and error hopefully over a few billion of years? Again you need DNA, RNA and proteins to make a basic cell for life.\n\nLook at how DNA is packed in the most efficient way possible mankind with our science cannot even touch the efficiency of DNA for even something as simple as computer storage. DNA can hold more information then a trillion cd's in the space smaller then the human eye can see. Look at how it is packed each chromosome is actually a long strings of DNA spun in loops the loops also are packed on coils are the right intervals for efficiency, the packing is a marvel of engineering efficiency itself. Again this takes instruction obviously of an higher order seeing we cannot duplicate this even close.\n\nWhat about the organic \"machines\" for a lack of a better word. These specialized organic \"machines\" unpack the DNA without damaging it, \"unzip\" the two sides, replicate BOTH sides with the exact opposite of the relevant letter G-C, A-T, with no error!! Another specialized organic \"machine\" is the transcription machine. It unwinds the DNA reads it passes the information on to the RNA. The DNA tells the RNA where to start and where to stop the reading for the information depending on what protein it is making. Do you really think this could have come about by chance?\n\nAll this complexity within the organisms, life, or the human body. Look at all the things that needed to come together from the universe, to our solar system. The earth is in the right solar system for life. Our universe is not close to the center of the galaxy where there is a massive black hole. We are in what some have called the galactic habitable zone.\n\nOur sun is the right kind for life it isn't to massive, it isn't a red or dying star, it puts out the right kind of light for life. \n\nThe earth is the right size not to large to affect life, not to small that it doesn't have enough gravity. The earth is not to close to the sun or too far but in the right zone for life. The tilt is just right 23.5 degrees\nthat results in annual cycle of seasons, moderates temperatures, and enables a wide range of climate zones. The rotation is not to fast or too slow\n\nWhat about the moon it is the right size, and distance. Could these ting come about by chance? Without the moon the earth spin would be a wobble, that could leave the earth tipped over on its side.\n\nLets go down to the atomic level. The laws underlying these forces appear to have been fine-tuned in such a way as to produce a universe capable of supporting life. “Changing the existing laws by even a scintilla could have lethal consequences,” says cosmologist Paul Davies. For example, if protons were slightly heavier than neutrons, rather than slightly lighter as they are, all protons would have turned into neutrons. Would that have been so bad? “Without protons and their crucial electric charge,” explains Davies, “atoms could not exist.”\n\nThe electromagnetic force attracts electrons to protons, allowing molecules to form. If this force were significantly weaker, electrons would not be held in orbit around the nucleus of an atom, and no molecules could form. If, on the other hand, this force were much stronger, electrons would be stuck to the nucleus of an atom. In that case, chemical reactions and life would simply be impossible.\nA slight difference in the electromagnetic force would affect the sun and the solar energy that reaches our earth. Such a difference could easily make photosynthesis in plants difficult or impossible. So the precise strength of the electromagnetic force determines whether life on earth is possible or not.\n\nPicture this illustration visualize an explorer’s visit to an imaginary “control room for the whole universe.” There, the explorer observes rows and rows of dials that can be set to any value, and he learns that each has to be calibrated to a precise setting in order for life to be possible. One dial sets the strength of the force of gravity, one the strength of electromagnetic attraction, another the ratio between the mass of the neutron and the proton, and so on. As the explorer examines these numerous dials, he sees that they could have been set to different values. It also becomes clear to him, after meticulous calculation, that even a small change in any one of the dial settings would modify the architecture of the cosmos in such a way that life in it would cease to exist. Yet, each dial is set to precisely the right value needed to keep the universe running and habitable. What should the visitor deduce about how the dials came to be set the way they are?\n\nWith all this evidence for a fine tuned, precise intricately designed things that make up life, I cannot with reason think that all this just came about. What the evolutionist, atheist understanding or focus on one thing evolution. As I pointed out, information and instruction of a higher order comes into play in to many parts of life to be dismissed. And that is just on life itself when you add in all the rest about the solar system, earth, and atomic level things that play a large part, life coming about by evolution is zero.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1324535096", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

Yes, any set in three-dimensional space is equal to the union the \"slices\" formed by intersecting with R x R x [z, z+0.3mm], but that's almost tautological -- it certainly doesn't give you any information about 3D printing.  You need a better way of formalizing what you actually want to know.  Here are the first questions to ask:\n\n(1) Questions about capabilities: Can you print absolutely anything, so long as it's no more than 0.3mm tall?  I'm guessing not -- for instance, I seriously doubt you can print a cloud of disconnected dust.  Can you print a 0.3mm tall cone (i.e., with slanted sides), or do the slices have to be cylinders over some shape (i.e. S x R, where S is some subset of R^2)?  Is 0.3mm the upper or lower bound on the thickness of a slice?\n\n(2) Questions about how close you have to be to the original shape: If I input a 0.00005mm thick circle, would a 0.3mm thick circle be an acceptable output?  If the input surface is smooth, does the printed output have to be, or can it have jagged edges?  Do you just care about the topology of what's output, or does the exact shape and size matter?\n\nOnce you start answering these, you can formulate the question you actually want the answer to, and then you can have some hope of answering it.\n\nOne place where people look into mathematical problems related to slicing is in computerized tomography, but that's generally a different problem with different aims.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1324541076", "subreddit": "math", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

As an nascent atheist at 12 becoming more aware of my disbelief, my folks became Assembly of God fundamentalists. They came to me post-'conversion' to give me this great 'gift' of salvation.  They were loving about it, (as loving as u can be threatening eternal hellfire) and I wanted to do what was important to them.   But unexposed to the tools to form my argument or just not seeing other options being only a semi-mature being, I just sucked it up and fake prayed for Jebus to not fry my ass.  I then  endured the fundamentalist BS as best I could. It began as faking it to fit in (raising hands in \"praise\" at church 4-yup-FOUR times a week) and going to youth group outings, mostly motivated to be around girls (since I wasn't gonna be allowed to date until 16--at which time I'd have to call the dad before even making intentions known to the daughter, then be chaperoned for the first x # of dates--never allowed to a school dance even Prom), progressing to acquiescing to read 'The Good Book' daily for an hour w/ penalties of extra hours for missing a day and EVEN, gulp,  fake praying in tongues (!), I can tell all redditors there is only so much a person can take of that shit.  I got out as soon as I had the $$ and the stones (18), but made the mistake of trying to maintain a normal relationship even though I leveled with them that their belief system didn't work for me. I relied upon what I'd read in the bible/bunkle.  I applied  the golden rule on them (\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\")  thinking they'd honor their text. I said, \"I respect you find joy in your Jebus, but I disagree and don't feel the need to covert you to disbelief so please, with respect, lay off.\" This faulty strategy caused me so much pain it took me into my mid 30s to finally change it u and STOP talking to them unless it was about the weather, which led to me hanging up on my mom repeatedly and about 2 years of near radio silence.  Eventually she found room in her faith to engage me on my terms and now if shit gets preachy I freeze the conversations for a couple of months. Works way better than the golden rule.

I've even had people think they were being complimentary because they differentiate me (monogamously married to another woman) from other bisexual women (who they assume are just experimenting until they marry a man).  And then they expect me to join them in hating all those women who are bisexual but end up in heterosexual marriages.\n\nThe thing is, just because any given person is bisexual doesn't mean their dating pool is exactly 50/50.  Say, for example, a single bisexual woman goes to a party, and there are 10 available men and 10 available women at that party, like so:\n\nM M M M M M M M M M F F F F F F F F F F\n\nAssuming that these people at the party roughly conform to statistics, at least one of the men is gay, and at least one of the women is a lesbian.

That leaves her actual prospects looking more like this:\n\nM M M M M M M M M F F\n\nSo really, is at any surprise at all that most bisexual people end up in heterosexual relationships?

{"body": "First of all, you're doing the right thing here: keep playing and asking questions. As long as you continue to do that, you'll build up more and more interest and eventually, books on music fundamentals won't feel boring at all.\n\nHere's something to try: *only play black notes*\n\nIn the same way that playing just white notes sounds good, so does playing only black notes. \n\nThat was important for me to realize in getting over the uncomfortability I had with black notes. \n\n~ \n\nAs others have said, black notes actually are not at all different from white notes. The difference in tone between every single key to the very next (whether black or white) is exactly the same.\n\nThis brings up the topic of scales. You see, scales aren't boring, complicated or tedious by default: they are actually kind of awesome when you look at them from the right perspective. \n\nA scale is, in very simple terms, a set of notes that sound good together. The set of notes *is not* arbitrary: it is determined by particular ratios from one note to the next. \n\nThis means that once you understand the ratios of a scale, you can start playing on any piano key and instantly know what other notes will tend to sound good (black keys included!). When this clicked for me, I felt like I had just gotten the cheat codes for music.\n\n~\n\nWhen you play only white notes, it sounds good because your ear will pretty quickly recognize it as the C Major scale (it may be interpreted in other ways, but that's the most likely case). \n\nIt might be helpful, then, to take a minute to understand that a little bit better:\n\nFirst, we just need a way to describe the difference between tones. Don't get too wound up about terminology. \n\nLet's say that between every single key the difference in tone can be referred to as a *half-step* (**H**) - remember that black keys are treated exactly the same as white keys! - and that going 2 keys, two half-steps, is referred to as a *whole-step* (**W**). \n\nThis means that if you start on C and play only white keys, noting the keys you step over in between, the pattern will be:\n\nWhole-step Whole-step Half-step Whole-step Whole-step Whole-step Half-step\nW W H W W W H\n\nThat is the ratio used to create a major scale. It is *the ratio* that matters - *not* that you are only playing white keys. \n\nIf you start on D and play that ratio of notes, you will find that you end up playing 2 black keys and that 2 white keys are left out. It will sound *exactly* as good as if you played all white keys because you've played the beautiful major scale, set in the key of D. \n\n~\n\nWith this small amount of knowledge, you can now have some fun at the keyboard. Shift that same pattern of notes starting on different keys and notice how it only sounds like mud when you accidentally play a key outside of it. \n\nPut together melodies with your right hand and notice how, as long as you play along the same pattern with your left, they'll sound pretty good together. \n\n~\n\nI'd recommend getting a feel for the blues scale, next. Like the Major scale, it's just a pattern of notes that can be played together. It tends to have a funky, rock vibe that is a lot of fun to mess around on. It really helped music *click* for me. \n\nHere's a Youtube video that begins to explain it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGCTnSrBiGo\nAlso, a worthwhile book to read is Piano in a Flash. It's short, simple and only teaches what you need to know to get started in the simplest possible way: http://amzn.com/1401307663\n\n~\n\nHere's an old reddit post with some ideas about why black keys exist at all: http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/gsv5u/why_are_there_half_steps_in_a_key/\n\nHope all of that is helpful! I had many similar questions (and still do) so I know that it can take a bit for everything to absorb.

{"body": "Okay well that website doesn't seem to teach fingering, so I'm assuming you don't know finger numbers just to be safe.\n\nFor easy notation, every finger is given a number.\n\nThumbs = 1\nPointers = 2\nMiddles = 3\nRings = 4\nPinkies = 5\n\nThe fingering for a scale has a specific goal and a specific twist: the goal is to always start/end with either finger 1 or finger 5, and the twist is a little finger trick that you need to do in order to accomplish this. It's really cool when you learn it.\n\nStarting with your right hand on Middle C, you can play a scale up to the next C with the following fingering:\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n    1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5\n\nThe important thing to notice is that you play the first three keys straightforward, but then you have to use your thumb again. To do this, once you play the E, bring your thumb UNDER your hand and play the F with it. Bring the rest of your hand into position and finish the scale easily, ending with finger 5.\n\nGoing back down uses the SAME exact fingering, but the twist will be different: starting on the high C with finger 5, play ALL FIVE FINGERS going down. When you play F with your thumb, bring finger 3 OVER your hand and play the E, then finish the scale.\n\nWhat you'll notice about this is that you can then fluidly go up and down the scale for as long as you want, because you now have a formula for always starting/ending on the correct key.\n\n=======\n\nIn the left hand, this is exactly the same but mirrored. So the fingering will look like this:\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n    5 4 3 2 1 3 2 1\n\nSo if you're going UP the scale with the left hand, your twist is going to come after five keys, bringing finger 3 over your hand. If you're going DOWN, you'll play the first three keys, bring finger 1 UNDER your hand, then keep going.\n\nThe important thing with the scale is that you don't want to make it SOUND like you had to put a twist in there. It should sound like you have 8 fingers neatly lined up to play every key easily. The twist is your weakest link because it requires the most effort and the most time to complete, compared with pressing two keys beside each other with different fingers without moving.\n\nTo practice, you're going to want to start as slowly as necessary in order to play EVERY interval (combination of two keys in the scale) in the same amount of time. When you get used to the twist you can start speeding up. It requires a lot of repetitious practice but it's a very good finger exercise and does a good job introducing you to basic fingering.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325173982", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What I've always been told by my guitar teachers is if you want to play it by the book, it would be as follows:\n\nQuarter notes: all down strokes\n\nEigth notes (and faster): alternating. This alternating should be completely uniform, as in, every down beat is a down stroke, every up beat is an up stroke (as is the case with 8th notes-- 16th notes would be a little different).\n\n8th notes:\n\n1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;\n\nd u d u  d u d u \n\n\n16th notes:\n\n1 e &amp; a 2 e &amp; a\n\nd u d u d u d u\n\nOf course, this is just one way of working on picking. You could do it the exact oppostie (u d u d etc...). You can also work exclusively on picking up or down.\n\nNow this typically is only practical in exercises or practice pieces. It can also be really inefficient (depending on the piece). When I play a song, rarely do I play it as strictly as I play an exercise (picking-wise).\n\nA great example of a non-alternating picking style is sweep picking (definitely google this if you are interested).\n\nTL;DR It's perfectly fine to play without strictly adhering to alternating picking methods.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325179900", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If the expedient of Weiss, adopted from Neander, be allowed, that the writer of James was in this section combating a Jewish- Christian prejudice rather than a Pauline doctrine (the epistle being assumed to have been written before the time of Paul), the conflict of teaching would still remain. There is, however, scarcely a probability in favour of this supposition in view of **the employment in James of the unique Pauline terminology.**\n\n[*Encyclopaedia Biblica*](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_Biblica/Issachar-Janna#JAMES_.28EPISTLE.29)\n\nEDIT: Here's an even clearer statement from [*Encyclopaedia Biblica*](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_Biblica/Issachar-Janna#JAMES_.28EPISTLE.29):\n\n&gt;The acquaintance of the author with some of the Pauline epistles, the particulars of which have already been given, must be regarded as incontestably established by the criticism of this writing in regard to which so many disputed questions still remain unsettled. The most indisputable point of contact with Paulinism occurs in the short section in which the writer discusses the doctrine of justification (2 14-26). The twofold prepossession against admitting that the canon of the NT contains pseudonymous writings and contradictory teachings has led to the confusion of a problem which would otherwise have found an easy solution. For if the same critical method should be applied here that is employed in similar cases from the consideration of which such prepossessions are absent, there can be no doubt that a general agreement among scholars would result. The case in question is not a vague allusion to faith and works in general, which might be accounted for on the ground of Jewish ideas and terms known by the writer of the epistle without dependence upon Paul, but a pointed reference to a distinctly Pauline doctrine and the employment of the apostle s terminology and very words. Paul declares explicitly : We reckon therefore that a man is justified (SiKaiovcrdai) by faith apart from the works of the law (Rom. 828) and a man is not justified by the works of the law . . . even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law (Gal. 2i6). He cites the case of Abraham, and affirms that this patriarch was justified not by works, but by faith (Rom. 4i Gal. 36). On the contrary, the writer of James declares that a man is justified (diKaiovTai) by works, and not by faith only (224), and as if to reply to the advocates of Paulinism by employing the very example adduced by their master he affirms that Abraham was justified by works (221-23). He also turns to his purpose the case of Rahab employed in an opposite sense by the Pauline writer of Heb. In the declaration that a man is not justified by faith only (fi.6vov} is implied the doctrine of the co-operation of faith and works in justification, which is expressed in the words regarding Abraham ; 'Faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect' (2:22). This is essentially a justification t $pyui&gt; in opposition to the Pauline xupis fyrycop, according to the declaration concluding this section ; For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works (X W P S i-pywv, the Pauline terminology) is dead. To Paul, however, the Gospel was the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, i.e., faith in itself or X U P L * fy&gt;7w had a saving efficacy (Rom. 1 16) an affirmation which is pointedly denied in James (fti) dtivarai -f] TriVrtj trcDeroi avr6v, 214).

For Paul, one's actions followed out of faith, is a product of it.\n\nLet me leave you with a critical-scholarly approach to the issue from [*Encyclopaedia Biblica*](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_Biblica/Issachar-Janna#JAMES_.28EPISTLE.29):\n\n&gt;The acquaintance of the author with some of the Pauline epistles, the particulars of which have already been given, must be regarded as incontestably established by the criticism of this writing in regard to which so many disputed questions still remain unsettled.

Paul could never, like our author, as Kern has pointed out, have made salvation depend upon faith and works, because faith in his sense included works i.e., a new life.\n\n&gt;The difference of the two points of view has been well stated by Schwegler : With Paul faith because it justifies is the source of good works ; with James faith because it is the source of good works and shows itself alive in them has a justifying efficacy. With Paul justification is conditional upon faith, or better, justification and faith are present at the same time within the man, and works proceed out of the justification in faith ; with James justification proceeds from the works in which faith shows itself to be alive. With Paul justification comes between faith and works ; with James works come between faith and justification (Nachap. Zeit. \\ 429).\n\n&gt;Nothing could have been further from Paul s thought than to depreciate good works ; but he did not think that the justifying judgment of God was determined by them, for as Luther, rightly apprehending the Pauline thought, says, faith lies at the bottom of the heart, and God looks to the bottom of the heart. (Cp W. Grimm, 7,\\VT, 70, p. 379.) However, the different views of faith and justification entertained by the two men are not of special importance for our purpose. (An admirable statement of them has been made by von Soden in JPT, 84.) Whether the author of James wrote for readers who, as he supposes, misunder stood Paul s teachings, or whether, as is more probable, he did not himself correctly apprehend them, the important fact is that he betrays unmistakably a dependence upon Rom. and Gal. Holtzmann is not too positive in saying that there is no more direct sort of polemics than the verbal citation of a formula (8iKaiov(r6cu tK iriaTews /j,6vov, 2 24), supplied with a definite negation (Einl.W 509). If the expedient of Weiss, adopted from Neander, be allowed, that the writer of James was in this section combating a Jewish- Christian prejudice rather than a Pauline doctrine (the epistle being assumed to have been written before the time of Paul), the conflict of teaching would still remain. There is, however, scarcely a probability in favour of this supposition in view of the employment in James of the unique Pauline terminology.\n\n*Sorry about the strange formatting and characters that occur at times.

{"body": "Chords are the distilled essential bits of harmony, not harmony itself.  C major is really more of a feeling than a chord.  If you can *feel* that the root of whatever's going on is C and you can *feel* that it's major-sounding and you can *feel* that there aren't complicating things like other important notes in the harmony, then it's C major.  You don't need the vertical structure to be there.\n\nHow does that \"feeling\" come about?  One way is that the notes of the chord are there and are somehow made important.  If you have C D E F G, G, A A A A G, F F F F E, E, D D D D C, then you don't really need any other notes to know that the first measure is C major, the second is F major then C major, the next is *either* F major or G7 followed by C major, and the last is G major followed by C major.  Just a couple of other notes -- say, a countermelody that hits some of the auxiliary notes -- will make you certain that the last chord isn't suddenly an Abaug6, say, or it might clarify that the third measure is actually Dm, G9, C, Am7, and the last is Dm7/F, G9, C6.  (I think I embellished that a bit, at the end.)  By the way, the melody is Over the Hills and Far Away, which I know from Percy Grainger's Children's March.\n\nWhat happens is that the mind remembers notes that came previously, especially if they were important.  For example, say you have eighth notes going G F E D C.  That's very much a C major harmony if you have no other clues.  Now, say a low A was being held before this.  Now you're thinking in the context of A minor instead of C major.  If a C major chord was playing before, you're going to hear three C major chords: *G* F *E* D *C*.  If a G7 chord was playing before, you're going to hear two G7 chords resolving to C major: *G* *F* E *D* *C*.  In the first case, the F and D were just passing tones; now, the E is a passing tone.  Same notes!\n\nA good composer can use just hints to tell you what the harmony is, without having to stick a chord in front of you with neon signs and arrows.

Also, your Q helps in canceling his ult if he is stupid enough to cast it in a place where you see it.\n\nSwain? He has to get into closerange to do any serious Damage, thus making it easier for Anivia to bring out her real DPS. Fizz has no real chance against Anivia. Trick him into using playful trcikster to soon, and he gets the combo in the face.\n\nShe also pretty much the most ungankable Champ ever. Wall, AoE Stun, AoE Slow? \n\nThe Porblem of being underplayed is because she has so much Power in her Skillset - 1 wrong W will end the game for you, and thats why alot of players go for other Champs, althought landing a good W will get pretty easy once you learn a few things about usefulnes, making the Enemy do what you want etc.. \n\nOverall, Anivia is a pretty Solid choice, but she is Underplayed due to her being a High Risk champ, althought the rewards of succesfull playing her are unmatched.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325370941", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Aikidi basically already summarized it, but it has to do with the notes in a scale, not just every single half step up from a given note. A whole step is two half steps, and this interval makes most of a given scale.\n\nIn any major key, the pattern from the first note is: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half. It's helpful if you remember it as the same rhythm as a phone number, as there a seven intervals describing eight notes (the last note is the same as the first note, only an octave higher). There are seven intervals between the notes, just as you have four gaps between your fingers despite having five fingers.\n\nSo, each note in this scale can be labeled with a number, and by extending upwards from the note in a certain pattern, a chord is formed. This pattern is: note, skip, note, skip, note. This forms a triad (three note chord) with a root, a third, and a fifth. Those names refer to the intervals between the notes from the first note of the chord. This means a G chord has G, B, and D in it. This is because the first five notes of a G major scale are G A B C D (because of the pattern of major scales), and to form the chord, you omit the notes in between the root, third, and fifth. A is the second, which you don't want, and C is the fourth. So, those are left out.\n\nI realize I got on what may be an unhelpful tangent. Please ask me about anything that's unclear.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325375048", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
