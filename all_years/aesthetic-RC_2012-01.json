{"body": "Bitonal stuff is pretty cool. I like the sound of a major key and its major 2nd neighbor playing at once or the 5th above either major or minor ( which I've heard a psalm by Charles Ives that was in C maj and Gm and it sounded fantastic), but I'm also one for the weirder ones like C and C# together. I describe more but I don't really feel like it. \n\nChords based on more than just thirds are interesting. Secondal, Quartal, and Quintal writing. Playing scales also have intriguing  colors when played in another set other then in seconds. \n\nLike in 3rds: Eb G Bb D F Ab C Eb\n\nOr 4ths: Eb Ab D G C F Bb Eb\n\nIt makes it a little more complex though because these scales require more than just 1 octave to complete. Without an instrument that can play many octaves it might be a challenge and a little restricting, but it give you a new more open sound. \n\nI haven't really explored much of church modes besides Lydian but I figure I'll share what I like to do with that:\n\n1) I like to make the tonic chord in a 6th chord ie. C maj = C E G A\n\n2) Lots of chromaticism, because lydian mode is just that extremely bright happy \"I'm in the forest and skipping along\" kind of mood. I think it deserves some quarkiness\n\n3) Substitute the dominant for the tritone major chord of the key. I learned this from listening to a lot of old video game music from Banjo Kazooie, but it is weaker than the dominant so I do tend to us it as just half cadences. \n\nSynth Scales are nice. I usually make up a scale and do this:\n\nScale: F Gb A B C# D# E F\n\n1) Find a major tetrachord\n\nSo in this case B C# D# E is a B maj tetrachord\n\nThese notes with their corresponding tertiary chords will function as your secordary chords because you want to get away from the sound of  a major key as much as possible to obtain the flavor of this mode. \n\n2) Now take the notes not in your tetrachord and create whatever kinds of chords : tertiary, Quartal, Quintal, Secondal, I'll just use tertiary for simplicity's sake \n\nThese will Function like your Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant chords:\n\nF A C# (Faug), Gb B D#(enharmonic B 6/4), A C# E (Amaj)\n\nIn this case I would use the B 6/4 as the dominant and the Amaj as the subdominant because the Amaj shares the A and the C# with the F+ and, even though the Amaj contains the leading tone, I believe the latter chord has more pull and adds the most flavor.\n\n3) Mess around with it, find sounds you like and don't like, but beware because your ears might pull you into a major or minor key. That's why you want to write down logical systems before you write in these new modes.\n\nI think the principle of writing with logic applies to anything really. To make a new style of music, you just ignore sounds that \"sound right\" to you and get a pen and paper that know nothing of music and create rules. It might not sound good to you at first but you learn to appreciate things outside of the conformity that our society and even us as human beings have come to know and love as major and minor modes. \n\nSo my last bit of advice is open your ears to anything. \n\n\n\nI'm also sorry if my lack theory knowledge might offend anyone. I'm just sharing my knowledge from experiments I've tried, and if anyone wants to correct me or give me more ideas that would be great! \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325478264", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll start you with the basics.  I apologize in advance if this is too basic.\n\nLet's take the C Major scale as an example.  This scale is \n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nThe relationships between two notes is called an interval and the quality of an interval is based on the number of half steps between them.\n\n* 1 half-step - minor 2nd \n* 2 half-steps - major 2nd\n* 3 half-steps - minor 3rd \n* 4 half-steps - major 3rd or less frequently a diminished 4th depending on if the 4th is altered)\n* 5 half-steps - perfect 4th\n* 6 half-steps - augmented 4th or diminished 5th (depending on if the 4th or the 5th is altered)\n* 7 half-steps - perfect 5th\n* 8 half-steps - minor 6th or less frequently, and augmented 5th\n* 9 half-steps - major 6th\n* 10 half-steps - minor 7th\n* 11 half-steps - major 7th\n* 12 half-steps - octave\n\nThere are chords built off each note (degree) of the scale.  The simplest chords are built with three notes a third apart from each other and are called triads. Chords have a quality based upon the qualities of the intervals of the notes within each triad.  \n\nSo, a chord built with C E and G would be comprised of a major 3rd and a perfect 5th (measured from the root, C).  Since the 3rd is major and the 5th is perfect, the chord has a quality of Major.  \n\nIf we take the triad built off D (D F A) and measure the intervals included in the triad, we would get a minor third and a perfect fifth, which would be a minor chord, since the third is minor and the 5th is perfect.  \n\nThere are other types of chords as well.  B D# G is an example of an augmented chord (major 3rd and augmented 5th).  B D F is an example of a diminished chord (minor 3rd and diminished 5th).\n\nThe chords of any major scale are predictable based on the standard relationship between each note intrinsic to the scale.  The formula laid out below for the C scale can be applied to any other scale.\n\n* C (the 1 chord) - Major - C E G\n* D (the 2 chord) - Minor - D F A\n* E (the 3 chord) - Minor - E G B\n* F (the 4 chord) - Major - F A C\n* G (the 5 chord) - Major - G B D\n* A (the 6 chord) - Minor - A C E\n* B (the 7 chord) - Diminished - B D F\n\nIn music theory notation, roman numerals are used to denote the degree and quality of a chord.  Capital roman numerals show a Major chord and lower case are used to indicate a minor chord. A superscript o means diminished and a superscript + means augmented.\n\nC D E F G A B C\n[or]\nI ii iii IV V vi vii^o I\n\nWe don't have to stop at just thirds and fifths either!  If we add the next scale degree to a chord (the 7th), we can build 7th chords which also have a quality, which is based upon the relationships between the root note and each member of the chord.  These relationships are also predictable for diatonic (within the key) chords.\n\nSo,\n\n* I^maj7 - C E G B - major 3rd, perfect 5th, major 7th\n* ii^min7 - D F A C - minor 3rd, perfect 5th, minor 7th\n* iii^min7 - E G B D - minor 3rd, perfect 5th, minor 7th\n* IV^maj7 - F A C E - major 3rd, perfect 5th, major 7th\n* V^7 (dominant 7th) - G B D F - major 3rd, perfect 5th, minor 7th\n* vi^min7 - A C E G - minor 3rd, perfect 5th, minor 7th\n* vii^o7 - B D F A - minor 3rd, diminished 5th, minor 7th\n\nWe can continue this to include 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths.  The shortest way I can explain those is that Jazz players tend to use them A LOT, but consistently alter the quality of those chords to be dominant (major 3rd, minor 7th).  These are mostly useless to traditional folk players, but can be very hip if used properly.\n\nThere are a pattern of relationships among all the scales.  This pattern is called the  [**Circle of Fifths**](http://www.guitaristguitarist.com/images/circle_of_fifths.jpg)  (or the Circle of Fourths).  It is named this because if you go around the circle clockwise, the next scale starts on the 5th scale degree of the current scale.  Going counter-clockwise, the next scale starts on the 4th scale degree of the current scale.\n\nWhen moving around the circle clockwise, the 4th scale degree (of the current scale) must be raised a half step to maintain the relationships between the notes within each scale by adding a sharp to it.  Conversely, when moving counter-clockwise, the 4th scale degree (of the current scale) must be lowered a half step for the same reason.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nPS.

Recognizing noises so far hasn't been as rewarding.  Listening for a pyromancers abilities was a breeze and each animation stood out.  Or looking at venomancer compared to slither.  Slithers ult feels like it lasts a lot longer and inflicts a lot more, but I look at venomancer and see his ult go off then disappear almost immediately.\n\nLastly, coming from heroes like Bubbles -- puck feels weaker.  Not for stats reasons but because shell surf feels so much faster.  This probably has to do with the turning mechanics but I got very good at avoiding abilities like Amun-ra, and it became rewarding.  Now everything feels slower.\n\nI feel like a lot of this can still change (as we are still in the beta) but I don't think much will change toward the release client.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325574394", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The various TFM servers are available under the cheese with a flag at login.  The default is british english in which the servers reside in France.\n\nRegistration is not mandatory to play, but you should register as this will allow you to save and spend your cheese on accessories, chat, and for the regulars this will make \"first cheese\" seem less wasted on an account that's going to be erased as soon as it's logged out.  Saves and cheese are tracked two ways:  Cheese is tracked as First Cheese and Cumulative cheese.  First cheese is cheese collected in first place.  Saves are counted as regular saves and hard mode saves.  Hard mode requires 1000 regular saves and enabling hard mode.  This substitutes Spirit (the spark) with a \"feather\" representing your totem and removes the use of the red pin (B key in regular play).  You get ONE red pin with your totem which is a premade construct of your own build.\n\nJoin a room (I notice one hasn't been picked for the event) by typing /room whatevernameyouwant and practice shamaning and learn the keys c v b n and what the various pins do.  Cheese starts counting at 10+ mice in a room.\n\nIf you're the sort that likes accessories, you'll want to get playing now as I heard that the christmas event ends on friday and this will be the last chance to get the christmas accessories and titles for the remainder of the year.  The vanilla rooms are the best for this under menu Vanilla.  To get presents you need to be standing or running (not having jumped) on top of the presents and click them.  Chances are 40% nothing, 50% cheese, 10% random hat/accessory.  To get titles, do the kiss emote under the mistletoe in proximity to another mouse or get kissed. Titles start at 5 kisses, are every 15 up to 120, 200 kisses is the highest title \"Snowstorm\".\n\nOne of the strategies of mice being able to traverse the map in the game is walljumping or WJing.  This basically involves good timing of some very minor \"bugs which are now a feature\" of the game.  Jump at the wall, and as you're coming down from your jump, touch the wall until you have the running animation, move away, jump and repeat.  This will not work if you are still going up or are level in your jump, it has to be as you are coming down in your jump and it will not work if you are already touching the wall while coming down.\n\nAnother strategy is air-braking, which is performed simply by performing your jump.  There are some grounds, namely the purple trampoline ground which gradually pushes you up and lava ground which could fling you out of the map easily.  When you jump, any vertical velocity imparted by higher than normal bounce grounds is nullified.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325694727", "subreddit": "Playdate", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'm guessing you have 11th fret Bb on the 2nd string and 10th fret D on the 1st string, so your chord is G D G bb d' -- or, since the 10th fret G is the same as 3rd string G, that's D G G Bb D.  It's more of a Gm/D.  I'm going lowercase to go up an octave, and prime to go up another octave.  I hope the notation makes sense.\n\nBut then you slide it down.  D is still the lowest, so it's D F G a c'.  There are many ways to look at this chord, because it's very non-traditional.  The root at the bottom of the chord is G, since D and F both gravitate to G in this context, but A and C aren't.  To me, this screams bitonality -- the D and G are basically a pedal Gm, with an F major chord on top.  Because of the context of the Gm chord and the separation between the bottom part of the chord and the two highest notes, you hear the second chord as a split structure in this way instead of one coherent chord.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325729524", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I'll just agree that I disagree with you.\n\nI didn't have to read through the February 2012 watchtower to know the JW's are crazy.  All religions are.  But, curiosity bested me.  Here's the quotes from the paragraphs about Selma:\n\n&gt;11 Many modern-day examples illustrate the value of applying Peter’s counsel. Consider the case of Selma. When\nshe began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, her husband, Steve,\nwa s  not  p l e a s e  d . He  a dmi t s ,  “ I  b e -came angry, jealous, possessive, and\ninsecure.” Selma observes: “Even before I got the truth, living with Steve\nwas like walking on eggshells. He was\nhot-tempered. When I started studying\nthe Bible, this characteristic intensiﬁed.”\nWhat helped?\n12\nSelma recalls a lesson she learned\nfrom the Witness who studied with her.\n“On one particular day,” says Selma, “I\ndidn’t want to have a Bible study. The\nnight before, Steve had hit me as I had\ntried to prove a point, and I was feeling sad and sorry for myself. After I told\nthe sister what had happened and how\nI felt, she asked me to read 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. As I did, I began to reason,\n‘Steve never does any of these loving\nthings for me.’ But the sister made me\nthink diﬀerently by asking, ‘How many\nof those acts of love do you show toward your husband?’ My answer was,\n‘None, for he is so diﬃcult to live with.’\nThe sister softly said, ‘Selma, who is\ntrying to be a Christian here? You or\nSteve?’ Realizing that I needed to adjust\nmy thinking, I prayed to Jehovah to help\nme be more loving toward Steve. Slowly,\nthings started to change.” After 17 years,\nSteve accepted the truth.\n\nSounds like he effed up. There's probably some people on here that would high-five him for \"smacking some sense into his annoying JW wife.\"  I'm not one of them.   But, was it a full fisted punch, a kick, a slap? Where are the details? There is not enough information in here to know if it was a one-time occurrence, but it looks like she forgave him and everything worked out 17 years later.  Who knows, maybe if you write in and ask for more information in \"Selma\" they might respond in a \"question from readers\" stating what actually happened.\n\nLook.  I really don't like defending the witnesses.  But, when you link crap like this what else am I supposed to do.\n\nThe jwfacts site is sketchy at best.  I read through the whole 'Bulgaria, the Watchtower and Blood Transfusions' post and the author clearly is attempting to twist facts even more than the JW organization itself.  \"He said this, they said that, blah blah blah.\"  Can't he just STFU and give the facts?  Thankfully, he did post scans of the correspondence from both parties and they more or less prove he's excellent at fabricating conspiracy theories from otherwise legit agreements.  Quoting magazines from the 1950's is just the final nails in the coffin for his own argument.  I suggest you listen to NEITHER the jwfacts site (and those like him) or the WTS organization.

Normally, though, what we mean is a 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 (octave).\n\nAlso, major pentatonic != minor pentatonic.\n\n* C major pentatonic = 1 2 3 5 6 8 in C major, which is C D E G A C.\n\n* C minor pentatonic = Eb (relative major of C minor) pentatonic starting on C.

This occurs because in a 12-bar blues all of the chords are dom7s instead of the I and the IV being major7s as they normally would be in an all major progression - that's where the blues feel comes from, baby.\n\n\nFeel free to ask me to elucidate, I may not have explained that perfectly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1325801459", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The popular ones to start are C A G E and D, but also throw in E minor, A minor, and D minor.  If you can follow those so far, then you practice playing each chord cleanly.  Hold down the strings and make sure each note rings out cleanly and in tune.\n\nOnce you get THAT down, practice transitioning.  Try to play one chord and see how quickly you can play another chord.  If you REALLY want to challenge yourself, count in groups of 4 (ONE two three four ONE two three four, etc).  Count somewhat slowly, maybe two counts per second.  And play a chord on the ONE.  Use two through four to find and hold the next chord.\n\nOnce you can switch between chords, you can learn songs.

I tried replying earlier today on my mobile but there was too much to make a decent response twice - I typed it out once and then the app crashed.  \n\nWell, it's a bit hard to answer your question.  So, I'll sort of point to past posts of mine to give you a complete answer.\n\n&gt;... Are you saying I can grind up my vaped weed and I'll get baked just by eating it?\n\nYes.  Yes I am.  That is EXACTLY what I said. :D  But let's go deeper.\n\nP O T C E P T I O N \n\nThis [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/fh88m/for_science_avb_down_the_hatch_with_no_heating/) has details on AVB being used with no alcohol or fat medium needed.  In fact, the only reason I chose peanut butter is because I knew that I'd be able to get that down with no issues.  I had tried to mix some earlier that day with Diet Pepsi, but... things did not go well.  Turns out that the pot just floats at the top, which I should have known from making butter.\n\nMy [top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/fh88m/for_science_avb_down_the_hatch_with_no_heating/c1fx99s) in there that has all of the log info should be informative as to questions on the high. \n\n&gt;Just curious, how high does one capsule get you?\n\nIt doesn't.  ; )  I have a very high tolerance for someone who has only been smoking for 18 months.  Heck, I had a high tolerance for someone who had just started smoking when I did this experiment.  An AVB cap was about .25g, so the method above would have been the equivalent of 12 caps in it.  Considering that I was up to an objective [8.5] judging by the AVB log, I'd say that's success.\n\n&gt;How many do you take at once and does it last as long as if you'd eaten a baked edible?\n\nFor AVB I would likely be taking 6 at a time, or a gram and a half.  They do last as long as edibles for me, and I typically have faster clearance times than most people, meaning the high lasts not as long for me.  But, I was impressed on how these worked.  I need to try doing it this way again, making edibles just takes too long sometimes.\n\nI should also throw out [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/fi9a5/decarboxylated_pot_capsules_how_to_it_works_6/).  I did the same thing that I had done with AVB caps, but with fresh herb that I had done a double pass decarboxylation with two different temps.  Results were epic for me, and so much simpler than any edibles.  \n\nThe interesting part is below for you:\n\n* Each AVB cap that I made was .3g (my estimate of .5g was off, I checked them last night with my mini-scale), and each trucannacap that I made was .25g.\n* The same effects were felt when comparing 4 caps of either cap - this means that 1.2g of AVB is approximately equal to 1g of freshly decarboxylated non-vaped bud.\n* The effects from trucannacaps were longer lasting than that of AVB caps.\n* Trucannacaps seem to have beginning effects after 90 minutes on an empty stomach, peak effects are noticed from hours 4 to 7, and there is a gradual decline from hours 7 to 10, where the effects at hour 10 are 1/2 that of the peak effect.\n* AVB caps seem to have initial effects in 45 minutes, peak effects at 4 to 6 hours, and a decline to roughly 1/3rd of peak from hours 7 to 9.\n* Psychoactive and pain killing elements are present in both.\n* While trucannacaps last longer, AVB caps are the most efficient bang for the buck, obviously gained from being able to vape, and then cap the waste to use again. However, the long lasting effects for trucannacaps should not be discounted, as they seem to be stronger for longer.\n\nThrow me any questions you might have.

{"body": "Ok, so basic entanglement setup looks like this: you have two photons, which have their spins entangled, for example in such a way that if one photon has spin up the other will always have spin down and vice versa. The spin of a photon is just a direction of its polarization. As you've probably heard, in quantum mechanics the outcome of a measurement is probabilistic, so you can't predict the result of an experiment with certainty, you can only predict probabilities of different outcomes. \n\nIf you measure the direction of the spin of one of the photons, you will get with 50% probability spin up and with 50% probability spin down. Now if you get spin up than any measurement of the spin of the other electron will with 100% probability give spin down.  The result of the first measurement does immediately have influence on the result of the second experiment even if they are very far apart, which is definitely weird and this is one of the reasons why Einstein didn't like quantum mechanics (the so-called [EPR paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox)). \n\nThe reason why you can't use this to transmit information is because to see that this is actually happening you must know the results of both of these measurements. In other words the two people (usually called Alice and Bob) doing the measurements must communicate with each other in order to see that they really had entangled photons. To understand that this really is the case imagine that you do the measurement on 10 different photon pairs, then the results can be for example (U means spin up, D means spin down):\n\nAlice: U D U U D D U D D D\n\nBob:   D U D D U U D U U U\n\nif you see both of these results it's obvious that the photons are entangled because Bob always measures the opposite spin as Alice. However, if you see only one of the experiments you can't tell anything, all you see is that probability of having spin up is 50%, which would be the case even if the photons were not entangled.\n\nThis does not mean entanglement cannot be usefull, it just means that you always need a classical communication channel, so you can't use it for transmiting information faster than light.

He spent days rewinding mabuchi motors and creating perfect bodies for the cars. Tiny ballrace bearings, so much work into each car. All I had seen up to then was Scalextric. We went up the back stairs above the model shop to the huge attic filled with track, (not too dissimilar to that in the video.) All the young men were there with their cars, tuned and prepared, and they proceeded to have races all night, eliminations, finals, runners-up trophies, everything. I was the kid brother of one of the club's top racers, I was so fuckin' proud. I got to drink real beer.\nWe caught the bus back to my brother's flat and the following day I went back home.\n\nThat video brought back very happy memories of a great weekend spent away from home with my older brother in Lincoln, England.\n\nBut Oh my God!!!

Minimum Connection Time in ATL is 60 minutes for domestic -&gt; international, and you're under that. Even for a Domestic -&gt; Domestic flight, MCT is 55 minutes, and 52 minutes is under that as well.\n\nIn ATL, the terminals go T A B C D E. To get from B to E, you'd have to take the train. However, the train stop is only in the middle of the terminal, so if you land at gate B1, you'll have to hoof it off the plane to the middle of the B terminal, then go downstairs and get the train.\n\nBut then that assumes that you got to the gate on time. If you're transferring at Atlanta, I assume you're flying Delta. For being the main airline at their airport, they sure don't know when planes are coming in and when gates are needed. Countless times, my plane has arrived at the gate just to wait for the jetway operator to realize there's a plane waiting. I even had to tweet @Delta_Assist once, \"DL xxx, waiting at gate B12 ATL for a jetway operator for last 15 minutes\" before anyone came.\n\nIt's your honeymoon, and I wouldn't add the stress of a sub-60 minute connection at ATL ruin the start of it. However, if the price is a lot cheaper through ATL, I can understand. What day and time are you flying? If it's like a Saturday night, you would be better than at another busier time.

{"body": "There are two ways to think of modes, I find it helps to use them both.\n\nThe first method is by shifting the notes (starting on a different note) which has been explained pretty well already in here. Basically you can get G Mixolydian (G A B C D E F G) by starting C Major (C D E F G A B C) on the fifth note. This is really easy to learn but takes some time to think about. This method is also good for soloing because, say you're soloing in C Major, you can also play any mode that's based off C Major (D Dorian, E Phrygian, etc.)\n\nThe second method is memorizing each scale, or at least the changes in the scale compared to one you already know. An easy example is Mixolydian, any Mixolydian mode will be the same as a major scale but with a lowered seventh. So for G you take G major (G A B C D E F# G) and lower the seventh (G A B C D E F G.) This makes it very easy to figure out which scale to play. Someone asking you to play D Lydian? You might have memorized that Lydian is a Major scale with a raised fourth, so you can immediately play D E F# G# A B C# D.\n\nEDIT: It appears someone else already said this and I missed it.

FLAWLESS LOGIC MAN: F L A W L E S S\n\nNext time you don't feel like paying in the restaurant, just walk out man. Why not expand that logic? \n\nNow your idiot argument: \"Oh, but it isn't stealing, it's just copyright infriiiingement!!\"\n\nYou.stupid.fuckface. If you just spent 3 months to make an awesome video, and someone else copies it from your computer and distributes it as his own...you didn't \"lose\" anything either, now did you? So it wasn't stealing? You still have the video, quit bitching!\n\nI repeat: You are a stupid fuckface. If someone walks into your apartement when you are gone on vacation, destroys nothing, and everything looks exactly the same when you return... it's fine too right? Nobody got hurt, so it's fine! Maybe he will even leave a dollar for you! Or two! He can decide, anything is too much really, since nobody got hurt - he can decide the price on his own leisure. Oh, and the novel you are writing? He read it. No big deal, nobody got hurt.\n\nI hope SOPA v2 passes. Only so that idiots like yourself will finally realize that being a stupid shit is actually NOT enough in this world.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1326998537", "subreddit": "Music", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The fuck are you talking about, dude.\n\nFirst of all, Call of Duty: Zombies is fun as shit. It was the single reason why I bought Black Ops. Secondly, the rest of the things that make Call of Duty what it is suck ass. The multiplayer? Shitty. Always has been. The campaign? Fairly original, but lacks character depth and something to relate to. With that in mind, there is absolutely N O T H I N G in common between RE and CoD. The \"day gaming died\" that you speak of came about when Call of Duty turned from awesome WWII shooters to the garbage we see today.\n\nResident Evil did start out as a survival horror, yes. But it started off as a polygonal, terribly voice-casted game. But, it was original. Which was awesome. And the series stayed true to itself up until RE:3. But then RE:4 came out. And what did it do? It basically invented the behind-the-shoulder cam we see in most third person shooters today. It took the formula and altered it, staying true to the Resident Evil canon, but showing us a whole new way that survival horror can be played and experienced. \n\nI will admit, RE:5 was a bit of a disappointment. It was the same EXACT formula from it's predecessor, only with different albeit canonical characters. But it laid the foundation for what RE:6 will be. We needed closure on Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Wesker's story before Capcom could introduce new characters and enemies. \n\nAnd Capcom has said both Operation: Raccoon City and RE:6, now, will both have traces back to their survival horror roots. Maybe through increased difficulty, maybe by not being able to make an RPG have infinite ammo, who knows?

{"body": "EDIT 3:\n\nBuild 1: E-centric\n=============================\nThis build has fallen out of favor recently, but it was the go-to a couple of years ago, and I think it absolutely shines in the mid game if your team already has a couple of solid stunners. It will allow you to crush a solo lane without breaking a sweat as well. I would not use this build if your lane is going to be really tough (2v1 non-mid or a rough 2v1 (like AM/Lich) mid). The build is also weaker if you have a lane partner. Finally, go with a QW build if your team is light on disables.\n\nWARNING: For very new invokers, soloing mid may lead to irritation and excessive flaming. Go lane with a partner (ideally a friend (I'd be glad to help you out (my Steam name is Prince37373))) for the first few games until you get comfortable.\n\nTo start, get 3 gg branches, 1 circlet, tangos, and a salve. Pick up a level of Ex and get those reagants bubbling. POW! You now deal 16 more damage than you did 10 seconds ago and hit harder than any other ranged hero in the game! Take mid and rock it. The strength of this build is your unparalleled last hitting power, so you should really be aiming for something like 25-10 within 5 minutes. It's a high bar, but quite doable. \n\nLvl 2: Skill invoke and cast it immediately. Communicate: You can now assist in any first blood attempt with Sunstrike. Watch carefully, and cast sun strike as SOON as your team throws the first stun. This should make the 1.7s delay a non-issue. Continue to control the lane.\n\nLvl 3: Wex. This gives you 2 things. 1) Options! You now have Meteor and Alacrity as viable spells! 2) Combo power! You can now throw a 2 spell combo, which can mean a VERY easy first blood if anyone on your team ganks mid. Alacrity + meteor is your best chance here. Invoke Alacrity immediately (WWE) and switch back to WWW for damage. You can now chase your opponent to his tower. If he contests, Alacrity yourself for +20 damage, +20AS on top of your +16 damage and use animation cancelling to move closer to him. You should be able to dish out a few free hits while he's on the retreat, or even combo into a meteor (WEE)! He's already running away and can't turn around without risking more damage, so meteor is a perfect tool. You might be able to FB him then and there! Be aware that's you're ridiculously slow though - don't try chasing into a tower hoping for that one last hit.\n\nIf he (wisely) does not contest, take all the farm! Deny aggressively - building an experience advantage early is critical since your opponent may get MUCH stronger than you at level 6 and you'll have to turn passive.\n\nLvl 4: Ex - that's 11 more damage for you! Remember to switch back to EEE after you invoke anything for the damage bonus! If you're feeling scared of ganks or of your opponent mid, Quas is fine, though not ideal.\n\nLvl 5: Ex - 11 MORE damage.\n\nLvl 6: Skill nothing, or if you're feeling in danger (facing gankers and no wards), skill Quas so you can access Ghost Walk.\n\nLvl 7: If you skilled nothing, skill Ex and Invoke 2 at this point. You can now gank hard with Alacrity &amp; Meteor into Sunstrike. Be aware - if you're ganked with only Ex and Wex, you can't run. You're slow and you have no escape abilities. Instead, use Alacrity, throw a Meteor, and give 'em hell. You're dealing +50 damage per hit from alacrity, +44 from your EEE + intelligence bonus, and your meteor deals over 200 damage per second. You may just wind up with a double kill. Otherwise, try to sun strike the survivor when you respawn.\n\nLvl 8: Quas - Face it, you need Ghost Walk at this point if you don't have it already. Cold Snap (QQQ) is usable at lvl 1, and awesome for interrupting TPs, but it only lasts 3 seconds. Start ganking aggressively when you hit level 8 give or take a couple levels depending on how good the farm is and how the lane is going.\n\nLvl 9: You have your first major decision in the skill tree: Go carry Invoker (EW-centric) or go for a damage-disable hybrid (QE). Carry Invoker is beyond the scope of this course, so pick Quas. Cold snap (QQQ) is now decent, and you can introduce Ice Wall (QQE) into the mix as well.\n\nTo summarize your skill build thus far:\n\nE I W E E _ EI Q Q\n\nYour usable arsenal contains these spells, in order of utility/strength. Unlisted spells are not worth using:\n\nWEE - Meteor\n\nWWE - Alacrity\n\nEEE - Sunstrike\n\nQQQ - Cold Snap\n\nQQE - Ice Wall\n\nQQW - Ghost Walk\n\nItems: Wand, Boots (Treads or Phase), Jango of Endurance, Bracer or Null, TP scroll, and the beginnings of a mana solution (Void for Guinsoo or Linkens, or Sobi Mask/Obsidian Staff for Eul's/Orchid), or an ultimate orb.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327128190", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So a string will vibrate when plucked and it will make a sound.  You can imagine the vibrtion as a wave that travels up the string to the end and then reflects back down the string.  if you watch the video that Naethure provided you will see the physics behind it, but the shorted the string the higher the sound.  Similarly the thinner the string the higher the sound.  If the string is at the correct tensity and length, the wave will reflect back perfectly, so the string will not look like it is vibrating at that point as it is midpoint between swinging one way and the other.  When it does reflect perfectly, the sound will be pleasing and this is a note.  If the tensity of the string is incorrect the guitar will be out of tune, so needs to be corrected with the tuning heads on the head of the guitar.  \n\nSo I already said the shorter the string the higher the note, so we can artificially shorten the string using the fret board and a finger.  The frets correspond to the length of string to create perfect notes, and the video shows the mathematical relation.  Simply push a finger down just behind the fret of the note you wish to play to make that note when the string is strummed or plucked.  If you look at a guitar fretboard you will see the fret markers (usually at frets 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12, counting from the head down), and the marker for 12 will probably be different as this is exactly half way down the string and therefore makes the same note as the one when you play the string open (no fingers on the fret), only higher.  This is an octave.  \n\nIf you look at a guitar hunched over it as if you were playing it the topmost string is usually tuned to E, followed by A D G B e as the strings get thinner, although you can change this depending on your preference.  Each fret from the head is a note higher, so on E the next fret is F, followed by F#, G, G#, A, A# etc.  The note of the 5th fret is usually the same note as the open string above it.  The reason the tuning is that it allows a great many chords to be played easily.  I'm not great with music theory, but chords are notes that sound good together, and on a guitar this means using two or more fingers being used to hold down strings, which are then strummed to make a chord.  Some strings are left open (so they are played with no finger on them), which is why cappos are useful: they hold down all the strings at a particular fret so you can play chords which would otherwise require more fingers.  It allows you to play strings open which you would not otherwise be able to.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327191214", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "The string vibrating at a certain rate (frequency) produces a certain note.\nLook, at the thickest string. If you play it, it will produce the note \"E\".\nIf you place your finger, for example, on the fifth fret of the thickest (E) string, then pluck it, you will be shortening the length of guitar string that is vibrating. This means the the frequency (rate of vibration) of the string will be higher, so it will produce a higher pitched note, (in this case, and A).\n\nThis is a diagram of what note will be produced at each fret up to fret 12 \nhttp://www.learnclassicalguitar.com/images/Fret-Notes-on-Guitar.jpg\n\nTo understand how chords work, you need to understand the basic of music theory. I'll assume you know nothing and try give the most basic explanation. There are 7 NATURAL notes you can play, in order going up in pitch - A B C D E F G \nAfter G, you reach another A, that is the same note, but at a higher pitch then the original A note, this is called the octave.\n\nBetween most of these notes, there are FLATS AND SHARPS (b and # respectively) . So in reality, every possible note you can play is-\nA A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#  Each of these 12 notes are evenly spaced (pitch wise), and this separation in pitch is called \"one semitone\". \n\nYou could alternatively write these as flats instead of sharps, for example A Bb B C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab  \nBasically, Bb means the same thing as A#, and Db is the same as C#. There are not flats or sharps in between B and C, or between E and F. Whether you use flats or sharps to denote them depends upon the key of the piece, and is heavily reliant on an understanding of how to read sheet music, which is unessential for this explanation, all you need to know is that they exits, and can be written as sharps or flats. \n\nOk, so now, you know that there are 12 evenly spaced notes (one semitone apart) from A to G#, then the next note a semitone up is an A one octave higher again, and the cycle repeats. This holds true starting from any note. \nie, from E\n E F F# G G# A A# B C C# D D# is on octave, with the next D# being one octave higher than the starting one.\nIf you play the thickest (E string), you will get an E note. The first fret will then produce an F, the next fret, an F# and so on, all the way until you reach fret 12 which will then be a higher pitched E. Every string on a guitar starts from a different, higher note than the previous string.\n\nNow that you have that down, scales and chords. These are all the possible notes, starting from \"C\"\nC C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B    The MAJOR SCALE is the basis of most of western music. Instead of fumbling around with these notes trying to play what sounds good, a system was devised to group notes that sound good together. From any starting note (I'm using C because it is the easiest), you can do jumps of whole steps (two semitone) or half steps (one semitone). For the major scale, the pattern is (Whole Whole Half Whole Whole Whole Half) Starting from C, if you jump two semitones, you get  to D, then another two semitones you get to E, then one semitone you get to F, then two semitones to G, then another two to A, then another two to B, then a hald back to A (the octave), and the process repeats.\n\nSo the MAJOR SCALE, starting from C, is C D E F G A B. You can do this starting from any note, but C is the easiest because it includes no sharps or flats. Each note in the scale is numbered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, starting from C(1) going to B(7).\n\nDifferent chords use different notes from the scale to achieve their sound. A MAJOR chord, is made by taking the 1, 3 and 5 starting from any note. For C, the note (1), is C, then note (3) is E and the note (5), is G. Find these three ANYWHERE on the fretboard, and play them together, and you have played the chord C. You can make it sound fuller by not just playing the three notes, but also adding the same note from higher octaves. Eg, Play C E and G, then play another C from a higher octave. It's still C, just fuller sounding.\n\nMinor chords have the formula 1 b3 5. Basically, you play the 1 3 and 5 starting from the first (root), but you lower the pitch of the 3 note. For example, C major is C E G (1 3 5). To play C minor, you would play 1 b3 5, which means you flatten the E by a semitone. So C minor is made up of C Eb G (alternatively written as C D# G, since D# is the same as Eb).\n\nAt first, do all of this starting from C (the key of C), as it is the easiest, then try starting from different notes. First build the major scale, (using W W H W W W H) from any note. Then figure out which note is the 1 3 5, and play the major chord.\n\n\n\n(If I missed anything or you are confused, tell me, and I'll try type it out better)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327191726", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I playfully submit to you the following response. \n\nTo get \"muscle memory\" I'd say about Eight hours. Eight hours and the average person who knows their chords and scales ought to be able to go from 25% accuracy at 50BPM to 85% accuracy on 100BPM for... I dunno a third of the tab on a relatively simple song. Simple being like a four chord, single scale rock/pop song. \n\nI mean if playing the first bar of back in black was the menial task you had to do at work all day. Back in Black isn't the simplist song, just saying if that's what you did for a living. You clock in, you pick up the guitar and you just play E5 D5 D5 D5 A5 A5 A5 mute mute mute G E D B A G all day long. You'd think by lunch time, you'd be sounding okay. Not... by the time you were eligible for health benefits. \n\nAnd I don't know if you like to count, metronome, or use a drum machine. But I would pick one of those methods and make out like I was in a sweat shop. Pick one bar of the song that's giving you particular difficulty. And do that, maybe 10 or 15 times with 100% accuracy at a manageable rate of play. And you can't do anything else until you get that 10. And then the next day you bump it up another 10BPM. \n\nIf you couldn't tell, I like to use as many numbers as possible when I'm trying to get better at something. It's motivating. It makes you feel better if you feel like you had a shitty day, yet the numbers are saying otherwise. It helps you actually get something done in an hour as opposed to just holding the guitar and feigning practice. \n\nSometimes I watch the metronome while I strum, sometimes I just visualize the metronome, and sometimes I count out loud myself. But I try to do that and that alone for a set time, like 15 or 30 minutes. Don't go from this to that just because it's really boring, or you failed too many times. Give it time to blossom. \n\nAnd I like to write out the tab in my own visual language. Like I'll write what the metronome needle angle should be on this note. Or I'll write it based on what part of the count I will be voicing when I play this note. This one comes on \"one\", this one comes on \"and\", this one on \"uh\", etc. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327255062", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As a frequent Swain player I like to think I have some experience. But here's how I usually play him (which in MOST games works out pretty good)...\n\nI like to focus on a Tanky Masteries 0/21/9 then build AP in game (which generally keeps it balanced in both aspects to be both damaging and very sustained) I find that people don't realize how strong he is due to Torment (which at max lvl is basically a single target Vlad ulti for yourself). The extra 20% damage is amazing, combine that with all your skills and you can dish out a lot of damage very quickly and in a way sneaky... Both Decrepify and Torment are DoT and Ravenous Flock deals just the right amount of damage that in short fights doesn't do much but if left unchecked it can really deal some pain.\n\nLets see what Swain's Damage LOOKS like (Ignoring Torments Damage bonus, AP Boosts and MR)...\n\n* lvl 5 Torment - **235 dmg after 4s**\n\n* lvl 5 Decrepify *(assuming leash is not broke)* - **255 dmg after 3s**\n\n* lvl 3 Ravenous Flock - **360 after 4s**\n\n**TOTAL = 850 dmg**. Not too much bad i guess. but lets see the \"hidden damage\"\n\n* lvl 5 Torment - **235 dmg after 4s**\n\n* lvl 5 Decrepify *(assuming leash is not broke)* - 255 dmg after 3s + 20% = **306 dmg**\n\n* lvl 3 Ravenous Flock - 360 after 4s + 20% = **432 dmg**\n\n**TOTAL = 973**. That's **123 free** damage! just  for being Swain WITHOUT AP, not too bad if i say so myself. And this is assuming you miss with Nevermove (works out to 240 vs 288 if you're curious (**free 48 dmg**)).\n\nI find Swain's strength lies with his \"sneaky\" abilities. The 20% dmg is hard to factor in when engaging a fight and his ult can easily turn the tides of a 1v1 and sometimes 1v2's with the dmg/health regen combo.\n\nFor items I usually go Boots, 3hp pots. Then hextech revolver, Tear of the Goddess, Mercury Treads, Will of the Ancients, Archangel Staff. After this is pretty much depends. I like going for Rylai's Crystal Scepter (which makes your ult a great crowd control ability) but other viable options would be Spirit Visage, Zhonya's Hourglass, Rabadons, any other Ap strong items. Just buy what fits what you're fighting.\n\nHere is where Swain falls off...\n\nSlow move speed. If you're out of position then prepare for a world of hurt. Swain operates JUST outside the fight. Close enough for his ult to mess people up but not so close that everyone is dog-piling you. His only real escape is his kiting with Ravenous and the slow from decrepify (and in some rare circumstances Nevermove).\n\nHe is by no means a nuker. His damage comes from how long he can stay in the fight, the general chaos he causes with his Ult and his crowd control. The funny thing is Nevermove, his 'main' crowd control skill, is more of a scare tactic. The cast time is painfully long and against skilled players it almost always misses but the effect it creates in the fight.. Everyone runs. It's as if it's some sort of all powerful Ult or something. Need to clear an area? slap it down and what em fly. OMG OFF TOPIC.\n\nfinally.... **I G N I T E**\nthis.. if this were pokemon Ignite would be a 4x Super Effective Critical EVERY TIME. This makes your ult almost useless. I've escaped from it before but it's VERY RARE. Whenever I see a team with not a single Ignite it makes me SO HAPPY OMG :D :D :D\n\nI did not plan this to go this long... oops. ya that's it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327266228", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; having got to grips with the basics of navigation and stargazing, what should be my next consideration for accessories?\n\nYour next consideration for accessories should be: don't consider them.\n\n&gt; Are the standard lenses generally crappy with telescope around £150?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Obvioulsly, very expensive lense would be a false economy, too.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; What would give me best value for improved viewing?\n\nAh-ha. Now you're coming around.\n\nLook, your scope comes with a 2x barlow (assuming I've identified the make and model correctly). Combined with the 10mm eyepiece, that gives you a 5mm-equivalent ocular. That means 180x magnification. That's plenty for this scope. Stop worrying about spending money. Learn the instrument instead.\n\nMake sure you know how to collimate the scope efficiently. There are various guides online, there are various tools available. Collimation is first and foremost.\n\nAfter you think you've done a reasonable job collimating it, do a star test: plug in a strong eyepiece and check the \"bulls-eye\" figure of diffraction around a big star - it must be **p e r f e c t**. Just make sure to keep the star image dead center, to minimize lens quality issues. More details here:\n\nhttp://legault.perso.sfr.fr/collim.html\n\nSeriously, any effort to improve a scope is null and void unless the instrument is collimated very well.\n\nYour scope is small enough that you probably don't have to worry too much about thermal issues. But still, once it's collimated, take it outside when it's cold and immediately see if it performs well. It probably won't. Now let it sit outside for like 30 minutes and try again. Does it work better? Likely yes.\n\nI'm hesitant to recommend better eyepieces because I don't know the quality of the optics in your instrument. Remember, the best eyepiece in the world only magnifies the real image formed by the primary mirror in the focal plane. If that image is not good, the eyepiece can't do much. See if you can borrow an eyepiece from a more experienced fellow astronomer, but only after you got collimation and thermal issues down pat.\n\nOne reason to get a better eyepiece might be comfort of use. A more expensive eyepiece will give you generous eye relief even at short focal lengths, and will usually provide a wider apparent field of view. But those will usually cost almost as much as the whole scope, so I'm not sure the investment is justified.\n\nEven filters are probably not justified yet. You're observing the Moon and it looks too bright - don't impulse-buy a Moon filter yet. Just don't let your eyes adapt to darkness, observe from a place with the lights turned on; Moon's brightness may turn out to not be an issue. If it still bothers you, then fine, get a cheap filter. Heck, with an eyepiece with large eye relief, you could use neutral-color sunglasses. :) Sounds funny, but it's been done before and it works.\n\nDeep sky requires low levels of light pollution and large aperture. You may be able to avoid some issues with a light pollution filter. But don't expect miracles. As always, see if you can borrow first.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327347008", "subreddit": "Astronomy", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Now whether or not you think that's a good thing is another discussion.\n\nI would argue that it is, for the artist. You're right though, another discussion for another time =D.\n\n&gt; Reddit is overloaded with shitty memes, puns, rage comics... the crap rises to the top, not the quality.\n\nYou're dissecting the genres though, not the content. They may still be memes, puns, and rage comics, but they are the *best* memes, puns and rage comics. But also there are great intelectual discussions and articles that are available if you wish to access those (by subscribing to the correct subreddits of course)\n\nMuch in the same way, the most popular *genres* will always be comedy songs, parodies, primarily because they are accessible to everyone (as are memes, etc.). However that does not discredit the impact of the internet to allow the great musicians to rise to the top.\n\nI'm trying to come up with a better way to make this distinction but I'm having trouble. The best way I can put is that the interent allows the best content within a category to rise to the top. Getting people to like a certain category (whether its music or a reddit submission) is another aspect all together. Enlarging the consumer base of quality music is a long process, as aesthetic appreciation only grows with aesthetic experience. You are describing an issue with accessibility, not with the internet.\n\nLet's use an actual example. [tUnE-yArDs's](http://youtu.be/YQ1LI-NTa2s) *W H O K I L L* was one of my top albums of 2011. I played this song for a friend of mine (who primarilly listened to hip hop, but played Uke so I thought he'd like Meryll) and his reaction was \"Man, you listen to some weird music\". I never even considered this to be weird, but I had previous experiences with other bands that he hadn't. [MIA](http://youtu.be/XmbuF6hjOo0) is the most blatant connection, though [LCD Soundsystem](http://youtu.be/OoA0cTC228M) and even [Holy Fuck](http://youtu.be/DhaRkWfaq10) to some extent play an impact. \n\nIf you expand to that to a global scale, accessability really becomes an issue. However the internet makes it easier and easier to find things that are gradually less accessable that what we've listened to before (Maybe someone likes the noise pop of [Cults](http://youtu.be/eAM9diyVRiM), and therefore [Wavves](http://youtu.be/pdbrQYER1fI) becomes a bit more accessibile).\n\nTo tie this back into marketing, the consumerism (because of the internet) is becoming a consumer first and not product first business. The four Ps are being exchanged for the [4 Cs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix#Four_.27C.27s) and the impact of consumer Convienence is incredibly important. Convenience = Accessibility.\n\nI guess that's kinda my overall point. That traditional marketing is dying, along with the music industry, but a new form of marketing is arising as well as a new music business (with a brand new business model). \n\nEdit: That got kinda long winded. Thanks for commenting on this though.

Try this:\n&gt;F A C E G B D F.\n\nThis is a weird phenomenon, because the top F should be the most consonant (it's doubling the root), but sounds bad again because of the minor 9th with the E below.\n\n&gt; C E G B D F# A C# E G# B D# F# A# C# F Ab C Eb...\n\nThis stack of notes corresponds more or less to the choice of extensions jazz players typically choose (imagine that the first B is a Bb to make it a dominant seventh). The most common extensions are the 9, #11, and 13...the first three. The next unique ones after that are the b9 (if you spell C# as Db), #5 (G#), and #9 (D#).\n\nSo I think the answer is that yes, most jazz musicians think of chords in this way, and the George Russell book that CrownStarr cites goes way in depth on this topic and way more.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327365736", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

Hugely underappreciated weapon, 20 str requirement amd has 487 ar at +5, plus whatever you get from the two D's. The main reason i like this weapon though it its attack patyern. At only 8 weight, it has the staggering power of a claymore (52 poise to not flinch) attacks very fast, has a long reach and a very good 1H swing also. The only drawback is of course how you get it, but there are many situations you can get it and have it be very good. One of my favorite pvp weapons.\n\nGreatshield of Artorias. At 4 less str requirement and 10 less weight then Havels its an obvious choice, although if you CAN use Havels and have the weightload for it, havels is certainly a little better because of its special. \n\nGreatsword of Artorias. Simply because it has C C B B scaling, the highest in the game, and produces very high ar at high levels (its not really practical until 200+) as well as doing more damage to darkwraiths.\n\nGolem axe. Dont overlook it at first. At a glance it has underwhelming stats and too much weight, but a +5 golem axe is extremely good for pvp on the right build. The power attack is the ultimate counter to casters, and will knock anyone you hit on their ass, with one of the highest poise damages in the game. Its never good to use alone though, you need to have another weapon, so you cant really use it on fast rolling builds. \n\nQueelags furysword. Decent, but not a favorite of mine, its easy to get and a decent weapon, there are much better weapons but it's a respectable weapon at the least. \n\nNow for the ones that are utter trash and a complete waste to get.\n\nFucking chaos blade. Even with 40 dex and 10 humanity, a simple +10 fire uchi or washing pole does more damage, and doesnt damage yourself when you hit people with it. Its a shame how bad it is, it has one of my favorite attack patterns in the game.\n\nSmoughs Hammer. I see way too many people with this. With 275 attack at +0, poor scaling, an absurd str requirement and not being able to be enchanted its embarassing to use. A +15 demon greataxe scales with an S in str, giving it at the least 390 bonus damage to its 275 base damage with only the 34 str requirement to 2H it AND being able to be enchanted, its better in every way and is the hardest hitting weapon in the game until very high SL with greatsword of Artorias.\n\nDragonslayer spear. I dont even need an explination, take one look at the stats and you can see why.

I believe playing the same thing in sync and octaves are still considered \"harmonizing,\" and you can harmonize in thirds, fourths, and fifths as well (most likely more...)\n\nTo harmonize you have to know your scales and key signatures.. A lot of Avenged songs are in D minor, which has the F Major Scale as it's relative major scale. Get to know this scale if you aren't familiar with it already. Notes are:\n\nD E F G A Bb C\n\nFrom what I understand, you just move up the scale by 3 notes to make the harmony. Example: \n\nCreate a harmony for D E F\n\nD goes to F;\nE goes to G;\nF goes to A\n\nThen your harmony would be F G A \n\n[Here's](http://www.blackbeltguitar.com/ChordScaleGenerator.php) a good source, click on the F Major scale to see it all laid out.\n\nBest way to learn exactly what you want to do though is by studying what Syn writes for him and Zacky.

The very meaninglessness of life forces man to create his own meaning. Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre, their idealism-and their assumption of immortality. As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if he's reasonably strong-and lucky-he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life's élan. Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining. The most terrifying fact about the universe ls not that it ls hostile but that it ls indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death-however mutable man may be able to make them-our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment.

{"body": "&gt;I have a Swatch Irony which is just about the cheapest legitimate (-ish) skeleton out there\n\nI'm sorry to say this, but the Swatch Irony is the least legitimate skeleton in existence, and is the most disgusting watch I have ever seen in my life.\n\nLet me explain. A friend of mine bought one, and so I got to take a closer look at it.\n\nA skeleton watch should be \"[airy](http://www.farlang.com/profiles/nisarg_sutaria/coreblog/patek-philippe-ref-5180-1-skeleton-watch)\", having most of the material removed to grant the observer an unobstructed view of the mechanism. This doesn't even try to do that, leaving large swaths of crudely finished surfaces obstructing the view of the internal mechanisms. The rotor is huge and fat, which further hides a clean view of the movement. They even had to compensate for this by glueing a big non-functional gear to the face of the watch to make it seem \"more mechanical\". Ugh.\n\nIt wasn't until later that I realized that they chose to skeletonize the watch so poorly out of deceit, and not laziness.\n\nI didn't realize why at first, but they've gone to some length to hide the escapement under the top plate, so this isn't too apparent until you inspect it closely. This is kind of silly, because the escapement is the most interesting component of a mechanical watch and the purpose of a skeletonized watch is to expose and display the mechanical workings of the movement.\n\nThe escapement pallets are made of plastic, instead of sapphire. Let me repeat this. The escapement pallets are made of PLASTIC. P L A S T I C. I have never seen anything so cheap in my life. Even Chinese knockoffs don't go to such great lengths to save a few pennies. It fills me with disgust just to think of it.\n\nIf you're not familiar with mechanical watches, high friction surfaces are usually capped with a sapphire/ruby jewel. This provides a smooth surface, and sapphire is incredibly resistant to abrasion. The escapement pallets are a particularly high friction surface, and their precision greatly affects the watch's ability to keep time. (The escapement is thought of as the 'heart' of a watch - it's what makes that tick-tick-tick sound). I can't imagine how using plastic pallets affects the accuracy and longevity of the movement.\n\nIn the old days, more jewels generally implied that it was a higher quality movement, because the jewels were hard to set. (Some harder than others) This lead to \"jewel inflation\" with manufacturers putting in more jewels where it was easy for no good reason other than to claim they had more jewels.\n\nIf you look on the back of your movement, it says \"21 jewels\" on it somewhere. That's a pretty good number for an automatic movement. I can't imagine where they stuck two barely-functional jewels on it to bump up their jewel count back to 21.\n\nThe worst movement I have seen in my life. This watch is designed to appeal to people who like mechanical watches but don't know enough to differentiate quality from garbage, and is priced to fleece them.\n\nHonestly the most disgusting watch I have ever seen in my life.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327649289", "subreddit": "Watches", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's not a question of \"why not geological elements\" as much as it is \"why organic elements\".\n\nThe organic elements (C H O N P S in a kind of weighted order of combined abundance/importance) make up life because they tend to form bonds that are \"just right\" and are strong enough to be labile (wiggle around and form new bonds) but not so strong that they form crystals.\n\nInorganic elements \"make copies\" of themselves all the time in the form of crystals. This is how you can promote crystal growth: by adding a \"seed\" crystal to a solution. The only problem is that the bonds are so tight and constrained, they can only form in a limited geometry, and are difficult to break apart.\n\nFor example, Silicon is far more common on Earth than carbon, but silicon-silicon bonds are somewhat weak, so they can only form crystals (if you twist the bond too much it just breaks), while silicon-oxygen bonds are strong enough that it's energetically unfavorable to base an energy cycle on breaking it apart (i.e. imagine plants that \"breath\" sand, rather than carbon dioxide).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1327798066", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yup. It baffles me how many MMO players ignore binding stuff to:\n\n\n***Q E R F Z X C V***\n\n\nThese are the easiest keys to reach for most every human while holding down W to run. A+D should be bound to strafe left/right. Note that E is the single easiest key to spam for most humans while moving with W. Your most used attack is optimally bound to this key. C and V are both very easily triggered by your left hand thumb and should be considered for high traffic abilities as well.\n\n*The goal should be the ability to fight and move without interruption to either. The best way to test your keybinds for efficiency is to hold down W and see what keys you can depress without letting go of it.*\n\nAuto-run is not advised as a replacement for moving with W in combat. It can be used in some situations, but the act of toggling on and off running is subpar to being able to control movement more effectively. Clicking both mouse buttons down to run also introduces fatigue and limits your ability to use mouse for click targeting when tab doesn't suffice; therefore it is not advised.\n\nAdditional easy to reach keys can also be bound appropriately:\n\n***T G B 3 4***\n\nFor people with small hands T and G may be more difficult to reach, but B is easily activated by your thumb which typically idles on space bar. In order to press 1 or 2 most people will have to move their left hand middle finger off of W for a moment. This is sub-optimal. Ideally 1 2 are used for abilities on a longer CD that won't need to be pressed often in combat, but 3 4 make great binds that are only slightly more difficult to reach than QERFZXCV. If you haven't already intuited by now, the default game UI bindings for these keys should be reassigned. How often do you need to open your character window quickly or reply to a chat in combat? You can reply with /r almost as quickly without sacrificing prime key real estate.\n\nBinding most of your attacks and important defensive cooldowns to QERFZXCV or some shift/ctrl/alt modifier of those simply *will* enable you to be more effective.\n\n*Source: Multiseason + multiclass gladiator in WoW &amp; US top 20 progression raiding with many world top 5 parses.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328044535", "subreddit": "swtor", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
