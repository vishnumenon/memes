{"body": "For remembering numbers, I suggest starting with the **Dominic System**. It's a number to letter cypher replacing the numbers 0-9 with common letters of the alphabet.\n\n(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 )\n\n(A B C D E S G H N O )\n\nThe premise is to connect pairs of numbers to pairs of letters to define the letter pair as a character and action you can remember. Using the system, you would need to define numbers 00-99 to cover all possible numbers.\n\n*Let's take the number 80. Replacing the digit with the corresponding letter, 80 would become HO using the cypher. We could remember HO as santa claus belting out \"HO HO HO!\"*\n*Similarly, 15 is AE, which can be remembered as Albert Einstein sticking out his tongue. So if we were to see the numbers 8015, we could picture santa laughing \"HO HO HO\" and Albert Einstein sticking out his tongue.* \n\nThe reason for connecting numbers &lt; letters &lt; pictures is to improve your recall. Numbers are hard to remember, while relate able pictures that stand for numbers is easier to remember. Ultimately, you could combine characters and actions if you had longer strings of numbers, *8015 could become santa sticking out his tongue (Santa = 80, sticking out the tongue refers to albert einstein = 15) or vise versa.*\n\nRemembering single digits typically require associating the digit with a similarly shaped object. 0 might be a donut. So 800 would be santa laughing \"HO HO HO\" while holding a donut. \n\nHere are a few resources on the Dominic Method.\n\n[Possible characters for the method](http://www.minezone.org/wiki/MVance/DominicSystem)\n\n[Learn to Remember - Dominic O'Brien](http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Remember-Dominic-OBrien/dp/0811827151)\n\n[Another site on the Dominic System](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/DominicSystem)\n\nAs for remembering non-numerical things, most memory systems rely on the **method of loci (also called a memory palace)**. It relies on memorizing places to establish, order, and recollect whatever you're trying to remember. \n\nFor example, you might use a small memory palace such as your house to remember a short lists. You would mentally walk through your house, let's use this progression: bedroom &gt; bathroom &gt; living room &gt; kitchen.\n\nNow to remember a list such as eggs, butter, sugar, ketchup, you would connect this list with the progression through your house. You might remember the list like this:\n\n*As you lay snug in your BED, a chicken sits on your chest and lays an egg on you which then hatches and proceeds to lay another egg... Within a few seconds, your BEDROOM has become a massive chicken coop filled with squawks, fighting cocks, and fallen feathers.*\n\n*Unfortunately you are soaked in egg yokes and escape to the BATHROOM to wash off. After stripping off your clothes, you turn on the shower faucet and a massive sludge of butter runs out of the spigot. You can't believe it's not butter as you slip and slide in the yellow mess.  After shining yourself off with a towel you wade into your LIVING ROOM filled with a thicket of sugarcane trees. You manage to push your way into the middle and notice several migrant workers hacking at the plants with machetes. You also notice a still evaporating the water and leaving the sugary residue. You snatch a sample of the grainy goodness before slipping on a mess of ketchup in the KITCHEN. Your feet can't seem to hold firmly to the ground and you search for something to grasp. Unfortunately, everything is covered in Heinz 57 and you end up staining yourself red while struggling to escape.*\n\nIt seems long, but the more ridiculous and vivid your list is, the stronger connection you'll have with the object and the more likely you are to recall it. \n\nHere are some additional resources:\n\n[More on memory palaces](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/MemoryPalace)\n\n[Method of loci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)\n\n[Even more on memory palaces](http://litemind.com/memory-palace/)\n\n**TL;DR** All in all, strengthening your memory requires an initial deposit of time and practice, but you will inherit an amazing memory that will benefit you for a lifetime.

{"body": "&gt;\"Place item such that it is in 5th position\" seems pretty clear to me\n\nI'd interpret that as \"a b c d e\" -&gt; \"a b c d f e\", which is differnet to putting it at the end.  And if you do interpret it the other way (ie. put it in position 5, and move the one already there **back**), you still can't identify all positions with just n terms, because you have the same problem with the beginning.  You could say \"put it where the sixth item is\", but there **is** no sixth item, so the ordinal notation is already breaking down somewhat - you're no longer just identifying items.  Either way, you've n+1 positions to deal with.  Once you've got this in mind, it's very natural for the *beginning* to be position 0, because you end up with this notion:\n\n    Index:    0 1 2 3 4 5\n              | | | | | |\n              |a|b|c|d|e|\n    Ordinal:   1 2 3 4 5\n\nNot only does this give you the very useful notion of unambiguous *positions*, so there's no question what \"Insert at positon 3\" should result in, but it has lots of useful properties when dealing with ranges.  Ie. the slice [2:4] is all the elements between lines 2 and 4.  To do that with ordinals, you need to specify whether it's inclusive or exclusive of the last element.  Exclusive would be best (see the Dijkstra link for why half-open intervals are desirable), but this is unnatural with ordinal notaitons, which are generally used inclusive in both directions.  \n\n&gt;Especially when you consider methods like next() and pop().\n\nBut not when you consider *ranges*.  If we never dealt with slices, for loops or similar, using indices like this wouldn't bring as much benefit.

{"body": "From the front and with the low res picture....  I am pretty sure that that is the wrong headlight bucket, but I can't tell as the correct one is hard to distinguish in pictures.  It should have a \"dent\" in the underside.\n\nThe Hella bar ends while available in the later 50's were not items on a stock '55.\n\nThe front fender looks like a re-pop, but the picture is taken from an angle which makes it hard to tell.\n\nThe front cover should be painted silver not black.\n\nYou have late /2 levers on the handle bars.  They should be the blade style, not the ones with balls on the end.\n\nThe pin stripping is not correct at all.. WAY WAY WAY to thick and it looks like it is backwards.  The second inside line should be rather narrow. And both should be hand stripped.  \n\nMIRRORS MIRRORS MIRRORS... lose those hideous monstrosities that reek of Taiwan.  Factory correct would be no mirrors or period correct would be an Albert headlight mirror.\n\nEmblem is wrong.  I can't tell but yours looks like a pre war replica from an R5 or R75 that are available from Poland.\n\nNo color on the tool compartment.\n\nAir cleaner is wrong...\n\nThe Battery should be a 6v Bosch that is square.  I cant tell if yours is correct from the angle.\n\nSeat looks incorrect.. again, it is a weird angle so it may be right.\n\nRear seat should be a Pagusa even if the front was Denfeld was stock from factory.\n\nI don't think fold up rear pegs were stock.  The stock pegs are solid.  Those look like aftermarket Denfelds maybe...\n\nThe tailight is incorrect and should be the small eber light.  Yours is a light from an r26 or R27\n\nThe rear wheel looks correct, but the front looks like a later wheel.  They should be laced in a \"one cross\" pattern not the \"two cross\"  Again, this is something that I can't 100% tell by the photo.\n\nThose are just the few things I noticed from looking if you wanted it to be \"correct\".  It is a very nice ride so don't think I am knocking it in the slightest, though.  I am sure it is a great rider even if it is S L O W  :)\n\nOh.. there should be NO 13 mm bolts on the bike.  Those only began being used after '63ish.\n\nHave you contacted the mothership about where and when it the bike was assembled and where it was delivered?  Contact Mr. Hartz or Mrs Hartung at info.grouparchiv@bmwgroup.com with a nice email with your VIN and they will tell you.  For a few bucks they will send you a certificate showing you as the owner with all of this info.  Useless, but cool.\n\nGetting everything concourse correct is difficult at best.  Hell, I have the #16 R60 produced and was told... \"your front shock bolts are from late '57 not from '56.  They are wrong.\"  Now do you know how hard it is to find the correct M10 bolts with the correct markings from 1956.... UGGGGGG!!!!!  4 bolts cost me way over $200 and that was just for the  4 bolts.  That didn't include the cost of blasting and plating....   UGGGGGG.\n\nAll said and done though...  **be proud of your bike :)** Old Beemers are an addiction.  Soon you'll be lusting after R68s and R5s and dreaming of possessing  an International Six Days Trials VDO Clock, (3-5k for a handlebar clock that needs winding daily.. really????  )  Hella spotlight mirror, and Rauche headlight buckets. \n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328142653", "subreddit": "vintagemotorcycles", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The root note would come from the chord you are playing the scale over. Playing a G chord? G minor Pentatonic. (This is not the only scale that can be played over that chord, but for starters it's probably best to think of it that way. When you get a bit more in depth you'll learn about modes and other scales that will sort of reinvent this idea).\n\n&gt;When you're talking about transitioning from D minor to G minor, you don't have to start playing on the root note right? You can play any note in the scale?\n\nThat's right, but you'll want to make sure that the notes sounds right. I like to analyse the scales, find common notes, and transition between the scales using that note. \n\nMusical example. \n\nG minor has the notes G A# C D E\n\nD minor has the notes D F G A C\n\nCommon notes are D G and C. So from this I would transition from one scale to another using one of those three notes. You can do this without knowing the names of the notes, and by looking at what scales use the same frets, but actually knowing the notes will make this easier for you. \n\n&gt;Is there any minor pentatonic scalework outside of the 5 scale shapes?\n\nThe 5 scale shapes are more guidelines than anything else. They're guidelines on the best approach if you're in a position. Don't feel restricted by the 'boxes'. Take time to learn how to effectively get from position 1 to position 2 via a slide or something else to really open up the fretboard. \n\nMusical example (E minor pentatonic):\n\n    |----------------------------------------10-12-|\n    |----------------------------------10-12-------|\n    |---------------------------7-9/12-------------|\n    |---------------------5-7/9--------------------|\n    |---------5-7-5---5-7--------------------------|\n    |-0-3/5-7-------7------------------------------|\n\nHopefully you can see here how you're able to move between the positions to create a full pentatonic run. \n\n&gt;Like what if I wanted to play G minor on the 18+ fret? Is there any way to move those scales down, or is all the G minor pentatonic work above fret 18?\n\nThe patterns are repeating. [I'll link back to the G minor pentatonic shapes again](http://www.guitarlickers.com/images2/G_minor_pent.gif). Notice how Position 1 starts the same way position 5 ends. After you've got to position 5, you can play position 1 again, but this time 12 frets (1 octave) higher than you originally played. So 1st position would then be starting on the 15th fret E string, (another G note). [Here is a diagram of every note in the G minor Pentatonic on a 22 fret guitar](http://jguitar.com/scale.gif?scale=Minor+Pentatonic&amp;root=G). But learning that would make you go mad, that's why we use the repeating 5 shapes to make it a bit easier on ourselves. \n\n&gt;can I memorize the 5 pentatonic shapes, practice them all with notes A-G, and I will have a full technical understanding of the pentatonic scales?\n\nSort of. Knowing these 5 shapes will give you enough musical ability to play over 90% of popular music, and 95% percent of blue and rock music. There are exceptions, variations etc as with everything in life. If I was you, I'd get these down. Pick a scalar root, say G as I've liked this example in these comments. Go to Youtube, or something similar and search for blues jam in G. Practice your G minor Pentatonic shapes over the top to give you a context to each note. Repeat with a different root. It'll give you a much more clear view of what you're doing rather than mindlessly playing scale after scale after scale. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328177011", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You instead define a type synonym (or newtype):\n\n    type PipeG a b m r = Pipe (Maybe a) b m r\n\nThen you define a \"guarded composition\" in terms of lazy composition:\n\n    -- haven't settled on the composition symbol yet\n    f &lt;|&lt; g = f &lt;+&lt; (yieldMap Just g &gt;&gt; yield Nothing)\n\n... where yieldMap is just a helper function that applies the \"Just\" to every yielded value of \"g\".\n\nAnd the identity pipe in the category of PipeG is just:\n\n    id :: PipeG a a m ()\n    id = do\n        x &lt;- await\n        case x of\n            Just a -&gt; yield a &gt;&gt; id\n            Nothing -&gt; return ()\n\nThe reason I like this approach is that it is much easier to reason about and prove that it satisfies the category laws.  I was talking to Paolo about it and the final approach will probably still bake this behavior in for performance, but you can still reason about it as above.\n\nUsing this guarded pipe composition, you can trivially implement lazy behavior with resource management.

{"body": "Ok, here's another idea I haven't yet fully vetted.  So, I basically agree with your overall premise that `await` has to be modified in order to be able to gracefully intercept shutdowns.  What do you think of changing the `Await` constructor to:\n\n    data Pipe a b m r =\n        ...\n        Await (a -&gt; Pipe a b m r, Pipe a b m r)\n\nThe first value is the normal continuation and the second value is the continuation if the upstream pipe terminates before yielding a value.  Note that it need not be a finalization routine.  It's just a fall-back set of behaviors.  Then you can define a few primitives:\n\n    tryAwait alternative = Await (return, alternative)\n    \n    done = forever $ return () -- utility function\n    \n    await = tryAwait done -- give up if there is no value\n\nFrom those two primitives you can then implement any kind of finalization behavior you like and you preserve return types.  So, for folds you would just do:\n\n    toList :: (Monad m) =&gt; Consumer a m [a]\n    toList = do\n        x &lt;- tryAwait (return [])\n        (x :) &lt;$&gt; toList\n\nFor resource management you would do:\n\n    read1 = do\n        x &lt;- tryAwait (finalize h)\n        finalize h\n\nOf course, I still need to think of a better way to automatically tag the finalizer to every await statement within a block so you can simulate \"finally\" behavior.\n\nI'm still not sure if I can modify the Await constructor as above and still have composition satisfy the Category laws, but what do you think so far?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328301213", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, I got it.  My thoughts on this have finally crystallized.  So I can show you how to improve on your Pipe type and composition instance and use the type system to verify statically that a Pipe will never await twice from a terminated Pipe.\n\nLet's first start from your composition instance.  You tag each Pipe with a boolean to indicate whether or not it has awaited once from a terminated pipe.  Algebraically, this means that you multiply each Pipe by a boolean:\n\n2 * P\n\nSo the first thing I thought was \"Why not carry the boolean around with the Pipe in the first place?\" (i.e. build it into the Pipe type), since there could in theory be a need to create a Pipe that was already in a finalization state.  So in other words, the base PipeF functor becomes:\n\n    PipeF = 2 * (A + Y + M)\n\n... where 2 is the boolean tag that tracks whether it has awaited once, `A` stands for the `Await` constructors, `Y` stands for the `Yield` constructor, and `M` stands for the `M` constructor.\n\nSo you can represent a product with a boolean as a sum instead:\n\n    2 * x = x + x\n\nSo we can rewrite our PipeF type as:\n\n    PipeF = (A + Y + M) + (A' + Y' + M')\n\nWhere the first three constructors correspond to the normal Pipe constructors pre-finalization and the second set of three constructors correspond to the Pipe constructors during finalization.\n\nHowever, we can statically disallow the Pipe from awaiting a second time by removing the await constructor from the second set:\n\n    PipeF = (A + Y + M) + (Y' + M')\n\nAnd we can also statically enforce that the transition to the finalization states is irreversible at the type-level:\n\n    data PipeF1 a b m r=\n        Await (a -&gt; r)\n      | Yield (b, r)\n      | M (m r)\n    \n    data PipeF2 b m r =\n        Yield' (b, r)\n        M' (m r)\n    \n    data Pipe a b m r =\n        Await (a -&gt; Pipe a b m r, Pipe' a b m r)\n      | Yield (b, Pipe a b m r)\n      | M (m (Pipe a b m r))\n      | Pure r\n    \n    data Pipe' b m r =\n        Yield' (b, Pipe' b m r)\n      | M' (m (Pipe' b m r))\n      | Pure' r\n      | Done -- defer to upstream for the return value\n    -- You can implement Pipe' as a free monad\n\nNote that this means that our initial Pipe (pre-finalization) is no longer a free monad.  This is the insight I was missing because I kept trying to figure out how it was possible to reconcile a free monad with intercepting shutdown.  This was also the objection I initially had with your composition instance: It doesn't enforce the irreversibility of the transition at the type level.\n\nAlso note that the above definitions are incompatible with your original `Await` constructor.  I distinguish the two continuations at the type level in order to enforce irreversibility so you can't unify them with a `Maybe` argument any longer.\n\nThis leads to the type-safe and (in my opinion) much more elegant composition that represents the nub of finalization:\n\n    p1 &gt;+&gt; (Yield y2) = Yield $ fmap (p1 &gt;+&gt;) y2\n    p1 &gt;+&gt; (M m2) = M $ liftM (p1 &gt;+&gt;) m2\n    _ &gt;+&gt; (Pure r) = Pure r\n    (Yield (x1, p1)) &gt;+&gt; (Await f2, _) = p1 &gt;+&gt; f2 x1\n    (Pure r1) &gt;+&gt; (Await _, p2) = r1 +&gt; p2 -- not a typo, (+&gt;) is defined below\n    Await f1 &gt;+&gt; p2 = Await $ fmap (&gt;+&gt; p2) f1\n    M m1 &gt;+&gt; p2 = M $ liftM (&gt;+&gt; p2) m1\n    (Pure r1) &gt;+&gt; _ = Pure r1\n\n    (+&gt;) :: r -&gt; Pipe' a b m r -&gt; Pipe a b m r\n    r +&gt; Yield' y = Yield $ fmap (r +&gt;) y\n    r +&gt; M' m = M $ liftM (r +&gt;) m\n    _ +&gt; Pure' r = Pure r\n    r +&gt; Done = Pure r\n\nNow that we typefully distinguish between pre-finalization and finalization we can now define the correct `await` function:\n\n    await = Await (Pure, Done)\n\nAnd our identity pipe is still the same as ever:\n\n    id = forever $ await &gt;&gt;= yield\n\nSince we introduced a new type for the finalization phase, we have to introduce two new primitive for the constructors during finalization:\n\n    yield' x = Yield' (x, Pure ())\n    done = Done -- just so we don't have to expose the constructor, and also because I like lower-case\n    -- Pure' is covered by the Monad instance for Pipe'\n    -- M' is covered by the MonadTrans instances for Pipe'\n\nAlso, would you be interested in coauthoring a paper on this?  I think now that Pipes has type-safe, yet lazy, resource management it is publication-worthy (and ready for production code, too).

{"body": "Ok, it turns out that I was sort of on the right track and I actually implemented and fixed my idea.\n\nLong story short, the finalization routine must be in the base monad and not a Pipe and you can't use the return value.

Composition becomes:\n\n\n    instance (Monad m) =&gt; Category (Lazy m r) where\n        id = Lazy $ pipe id\n        Lazy p1' . Lazy p2' = Lazy $ case (p1', p2') of\n            (Yield (y1, m) , p2                 ) -&gt; Yield (fmap (&lt;+&lt; p2) y1, m)\n            (M m1          , p2                 ) -&gt; M $ liftM (&lt;+&lt; p2) m1\n            (Pure r1       , Yield (_, m2)      ) -&gt; lift m2 &gt;&gt; Pure r1\n            (Pure r1       , _                  ) -&gt; Pure r1\n            (Await (f1, _) , Yield ((x2, p2), _)) -&gt; f1 x2 &lt;+&lt; p2\n            (p1            , Await (f2, p2')    ) -&gt; Await (fmap (p1 &lt;+&lt;) f2, p2')\n            (p1            , M m2               ) -&gt; M $ liftM (p1 &lt;+&lt;) m2\n            (Await (_, m1) , Pure r             ) -&gt; lift m1 &gt;&gt; Pure r\n\nI haven't vetted the case statement ordering yet, but you get the idea.  The `yield` and `await` primitives just use `return ()` as the fallback and you can implement `tryYield` and `tryAwait` primitives this way.\n\nIn fact, this makes obvious something we both hadn't considered in your initial approach, namely that yields can fail and we were never intercepting them.  That would have been a problem for a Producer that had to finalize a resource when its downstream Pipes terminated.\n\nThe nice thing about this approach is that you still keep the free monad, which is nice.\n\nYou can check out this implementation from the \"try\" branch of my github repository.  I like to use the following pipe for testing finalization:\n\n    pass = forever $ tryAwait (putStrLn \"Await failed\") &gt;&gt;= tryYield (putStrLn \"Yield failed\")\n\nA couple of examples to show it in action:\n\n    &gt; runPipe $ printer &lt;+&lt; take 3 &lt;+&lt; pass &lt;+&lt; fromList [1..]\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    Yield failed\n\n    &gt; runPipe $ printer &lt;+&lt; pass &lt;+&lt; take 3 &lt;+&lt; fromList [1..]\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    Await failed\n\nI'll need to go over it and check the Category laws.  `id` is still `forever $ await &gt;&gt;= yield` and `discard` is still `forever await`.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328336943", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A lot of material here. I'll try to cover all the points.\n\nFirst of all, the composition of pipes with monadic finalizers, as written, is\nnot associative. If you have a pipe of the form `P &gt;+&gt; A1 &gt;+&gt; A2`, the\nfinalizer of `A2` is only going to be called if you associate on the left.\n\nAnyway, I don't think this actually solves the problem. For example, take a\nlook at the `lines` conduit\n[here](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit/blob/master/conduit/Data/Conduit/Binary.hs).\nHow would you implement this in pipes? If you write something like:\n\n    lines :: Monad m =&gt; Pipe B.ByteString B.ByteString m r\n    lines = go B.empty\n      where\n        go leftover = do\n          chunk &lt;- await\n          let chunk' = leftover `mappend` chunk\n          let ls = BC.lines chunk'\n          mapM_ yield $ init ls\n          go $ last ls\n\nthen you lose the last line of the last chunk, which is going to be bound to\n`leftover`, but never yielded, because the pipe immediately terminates when\n`await` fails. Adding only monadic finalizers doesn't help here.\n\nI think it's important not to conflate two distinct notions of finalization.\nThere is *finalization of the pipe's internal state*, and *finalization of\nexternal resources*. The first has a semantic connotation: it is needed so that\nthe pipe can complete its job before terminating. The second is merely to\nprevent leaks and avoid tying up resources unnecessarily.\n\nI believe that those two types of finalizations are orthogonal. There are\ntechniques to deal with the second type of finalization, like monadic regions\nand `ResourceT`, which can be used together with pipes (see\n[here](https://github.com/pcapriotti/pipes-extra/blob/master/Control/Pipe/Binary.hs)\nfor examples with `ResourceT`).\n\nYour monadic finalizer approach can be thought of as another solution to the\nexternal finalization problem, but it's incomplete, since it's not\nexception-safe. I suppose that using some type-level trickery you could bake\nexception-handling logic in the definition of composition, but I don't see the\npoint of doing that when we already have valid alternatives that work\nindependently of pipes.\n\nThat leads to the second point: handling a failed `Yield`. As far as an\nindividual pipe is concerned, `yield` can never fail. If the downstream pipe\nterminates before it receives a certain yielded value, then no more values are\ngoing to be consumed, and there's no reason to keep the pipeline running. The\nonly reason would be freeing up allocated resources, but again, this can be\nhandled outside. The asymmetry is there because the pipeline data flow is\nunidirectional.\n\nAs for the other approach (using a separate monad for finalizer pipes), I think\nit's very interesting, but I don't like that we have two completely independent\npipe types, because that hinders composability. Also, again, the composition as\nyou wrote it is not associative, for similar reasons (you need to handle the\n`Await` + `Await` case differently).\n\nThere is a way to have the best of both worlds (composability and better\nstatical guarantees): add a type parameter representing whether the pipe is a\nfinalizer or not, and define `Pipe` as a GADT:\n\n    data Main\n    data Fin\n\n    data Pipe f a b m r where\n      Done :: Pipe Fin a b m r\n      Pure :: f -&gt; r -&gt; Pipe f a b m r\n      M :: m r -&gt; Pipe f a b m r\n      Await :: (a -&gt; Pipe Main a b m r)\n            -&gt; Pipe Fin a b m r\n            -&gt; Pipe Main a b m r\n      Yield :: b -&gt; Pipe f a b m r\n\nSo now you can define pipes which are polymorphic in the pipe finalization\nstate:\n\n    readFile:: MonadIO m =&gt; FilePath -&gt; Pipe f a B.ByteString m ()\n    readFile fp = ...\n\nThis is completely untested, but I see no reason why it shouldn't work. It also\nmakes the distinction between internal and external finalization very apparent:\n`readFile` allocates external resources, but there's nothing wrong in using it\nin a finalizer.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to the usual debate of whether a little extra static\nguarantee is worth forcing an additional parameter in all type declarations. I\ndon't think you can fairly say that my original variation is not type-safe,\nsince composition is always well defined, no matter what constructors you use.\nIt is true that `Await` has two different semantics according to the context\n(it doubles up as `Done`, basically) and that is not encoded in the types, but\nI really think we could live with that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328367763", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd like it if there was a game-time area. What I mean is, in every guide, the guide writer has to type out a wall of text explaining strats and item-goals for that specific area of the game. So why not divide certain times of the game to make it easier to divide the guide into how you should play at specific time-zones in the game like this:\n\n________________________________________________\n\nPre-minion spawn:\n-\nStarter items : x x x x x\n\nIf you gain any gold before you get back to lane: Buy x x x x \nLaning phase\n- \nItems:  x x x x x\n\nSkill order: qwer\n\nTips: bla bla\n\nIf you're zoned/countered: bla bla\n\nIf you can zone: bla bla\n\nTrades: bla bla\n\nEarly Mid-Game:\n-\n\nItems: x x x x \n\nSkill order: qwer\n\nPositioning/Focus: bla bla\n\nUsing your abilities: bla bla\n\nAvoiding focus/cc: blaaaaa\n\nOverall Strategies: bla bla\n\nMid-Game: \n-\nSame ^\n\nLate Mid-Game:\n-\n\nSame ^\n\nLate-Game:\n-\n\nSame^\n\nSummary of Appropriate Playstyle: (awkward wording here)\n-\n(Room for excessive amounts of blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)\n\n________________________________________________\n\n(Each time-zone has areas designated for the specific tip outlined in the guide, but an additional area is provided at the end for things that don't fall under the designated areas. These are just the headings I suggest because they are key components I would want in a guide, and what I often see in a guide. The basic idea is that I would like time-zones and headings under each time-zone, the headings I suggest are mainly just fillers and would preferably be unique to the guide-maker. But they would be set up as default headings to remind the guide maker of these main topics. Guide makers already make headings of their own in the body text, however making different areas for time-zones built into the UI of the guide-maker would make it a more consistent layout and make it a lot easier for the guide-reader, as consistency is always good when dealing with a bunch of different guide layouts that the guide-maker has to figure out on their own (and often end up with colour coding or bolding of headings).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328389824", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

The very meaninglessness of life forces man to create his own meaning. Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre, their idealism-and their assumption of immortality. As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if he's reasonably strong-and lucky-he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life's élan. Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining. The most terrifying fact about the universe ls not that it ls hostile but that it ls indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death-however mutable man may be able to make them-our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.\n\nRelevant Epicurus quote: \n\n\"Death is nothing to us, since when we are, death has not come, and when death has come, we are not.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328495835", "subreddit": "philosophy", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah.  I'm still not sure this will be the final implementation, so take all of this with a grain of salt, but I'll describe it anyway.  Let's start with the `Await` constructor from the `Pipe` type extended with failure handling:\n\n    data Pipe a b m r =\n        ...\n        Await (a -&gt; Pipe a b m r, Producer b m ())\n        ...\n\n... where `Producer` is a `Pipe` without an `Await` constructor that represents the failure continuation where further awaits are prohibited.  If you were to set the return type to:\n\n    Await (a -&gt; Pipe a b m r, Producer b m r)\n\n... then in order to satisfy the Monad instance you'd need to be able to bind downstream Pipe code to both the successful continuation and the failure continuation.  Binding a return value within the Pipe monad requires reversing the downgrade to a Producer in order to restore control back to the original Pipe monad.  For example, let's say that you had the following code:\n\n    do\n        awaitOr (lift $ putStrLn \"Await failed\")\n        await\n\nAccording to Paolo's proposal, a failed Pipe should not be allowed to await again after it has already failed once.  If that's true, we shouldn't be able to allow the second await call continue where the failure continuation left off, which would break our invariant.\n\nI still have a lot of thinking to do about this because, like Paolo, I'd actually like values to be returnable from failure continuations and I'm trying to reconcile his proposed behavior in a type-safe way.\n\nIt may take time, but I'll know when we have the right solution because when we get it right it should be elegant.  Right now the current implementation does NOT satisfy the category laws (and I will never release an implementation that doesn't satisfy them), which leads me to suspect that there is some more elegant approach that I'm missing.\n\nI entertain lots and lots of ideas and the Pipes package I released was the result of a lot of failed approaches that I rejected, so don't take too seriously anything I mention until it is officially released on Hackage.  I have a tendency to try a lot of crazy things until I get the right solution.

{"body": "My longest is 64 hours, 64 very long grinding hours. Enter the year 2003 I'm a fresh 18 year old punk. I've been playing for about 2 years online under my father and uncles watchful eye. I head down to Canterbury Park located in Shakopee, MN for the Fall classic. \n\nMy bank roll was at roughly 2400, earned most of that grinding out pots at 6/12 hold em and 4/8 7 card stud. The 6/12 game played like a 2/4 game. Most of the college kids came there and this was during the big TV poker boom. I bought in for a few of the tournaments, like the 200+30 Omaha hi/lo turney only to bust on the bubble. Then I bought into another 100+20 NLHE with 156 entrants. Bubble bust a g a i n..\n\nDuring the Fall Classic Canterbury is electric, so many people with poker hopes that that place really never sleeps. Huge cash pots were being made at the tables from people being busted out. After several bubble pops on the turneys I decided to go grind out some table work. By this time it had been almost 16 hours. I went and sat TAG on 8/16 limit holdem. \n\nWith all the tilting from the loss of the tournaments this game became super juicy.

It's what's missing the most into my\nlife, it's the reward I have been looking for, it's the engine that\nwill keep me alive. I cannot and will not go any further without those:\nL O V E     &amp;     B E A U T Y, or\nsimply name it \"LOVE\". I am talking here about ROMANTIC love, because\nI also do know that there are many kinds and levels of LOVE.  \n\n\nI have worked\nmany years on becoming a better individual, a knight in\n(no) shinning armor, that a beautiful fairy will fall in love with...\nCall me STUPID, call me a DREAMER, call me BOTH, or whatever you may\nfind appropriate, but I think it is extremely unfair to have to go\nALONE\nthrough LIFE.  \n\n\nAre you a Prince Charming, yet ?\nyou may ask...  \nYes, I could\nbe, but every one defines \"prince charming\" differently.  \n\n\nI am smart, but\nsometimes slow.  \nI know 4 \nlanguages.\n\nI scored 91 at\nASVAB, from 99 possible, although English is not my\nnative language.  \nI love to\ntravel and finally, I made it to a job where traveling is\nthe way one makes money.  \nI am into\nspirituality, martial arts, have an artsy soul.  \nI try to\nsurround myself with high quality individuals, kind people I\ncan learn a lot from.  \nI believe that\nin order to reach happiness or at least go forward in\nlife, one has to think and act UNCONVENTIONAL.  \nBlack humor and\nirony are two of my closest friends.  \nI love nature\nand animals.\n\nSelf\nimprovement, something I always work on.  \nI am brown\nhaired, blue eyes, slim, medium height.  \n\n\n\n\nLife is like a\ngame of strategy. Everything we do, or don't do, affects\nour existence. And imagination, perseverance, unconventional thinking\nand integrity are powerful tools.  \n\n\nAre you the\nfairy tale girl I have been looking for ? Are you that\nhigh quality individual that will click with me ?  \nBelow are the\nfeatures I am looking for. The more you have, the better:  \n\n\n-she does not\nsmoke\n\n-she is slim  \n-she would love\nto travel\n\n-she is\ninterested in:  \n  \n -foreign languages  \n  \n -world's art and culture  \n  \n -soccer, sports  \n  \n -martial arts  \n  \n -spirituality and philosophy  \n  \n -reading and writing  \n  \n -music, museums, arts  \n  \n -science fiction and UFOs  \n-she has blue,\ngreen or hazel eyes  \n-she has long\nhair\n\n-she is asian\nor caucasian (exceptions welcome)  \n-she is\nbeautiful\n\n-she is\nsensitive, honest, romantic and into commitment  \n-she is not\nhigh maintenance  \n-she is a hard\nworker\n\n-she is a\nperfectionist  \n\n\n\n\nThe list could\ngo on... No wonder I don't have a girl friend, right ?!\nWell, I found out that making rebates on quality does not work either,\nthey dump as easily as an A lady would. I was hoping that being with\nan average, or even below average, looking girl will provide me with\nthe emotional security I have been craving for, but life slapped me on\nmore time, it showed me I was wrong...  \n\n\n\n\nI could make\nthis message even longer, but I am going to stop here.\nThis is a science fiction endeavor. Really... It is a guy with an\nidea... Thinking to himself, there are millions and millions of\nbeautiful girls/women out there.... How can I find one and make her\nmine ??? Hmm... You could reach thousands of people on the Internet....\nand the more ladies you reach, the more likely it is to actually find\none who will resonate with your ideas, one that will like you a lot,\none that will fall in love with you and stay that way... Of course,\nthere are many \"IFs\" and TRICKS involved, many things that could and\nwill go wrong, like in a game of chess, but if you carefully prepare\neach step, you have got a real chance here.  \n\n\nIf you read\nthis message now, it means I got pretty far. I have this\nweb site, with pictures of me, with more on what I look for in a\nrelationship, I even had put there some reflections that one day I may\nhave enough to publish in a book. If you are interested in finding out\nmore about me, please write me back more about you, about what do you\ndo in real life, how old are you, how do you look like (yeah, your\nphone number too) and I will either send you the link to the web site\nor send you the files zipped to your email account. If you do want to\ntalk to me, if you FEEL that I may be the \"prince charming\" you have\ndreamed for (yes, he does exist), write me back at ****@vl.ro and put\nyour email address in the subject line, so I know it is not just\nanother promotion on some sort of product or service.  \n\n\nThis is NOT\njust another bulk email.  \n\n\nThis message is\nSPECIAL. It can change your life into better. For REAL.\nTry it and you shall SEE. Do your part and I will do mine. I always do\nmy part.\n\n\n\nOk, you know\nyou are not interested in me, romantically. Maybe you got\nmarried, maybe you think I am too naive, too lame, cheesy, or\nwhatever. But, think about this:  \n\n\nHELP ME OUT and I WILL\nDO THE SAME.  \n\n\nYou already\nknow what is my number one wish. To find a fairy tale girl\nto love and be loved by. Maybe you have single cute friends that may be\ninterested in me... sisters, cousins, relatives... co-workers... people\nthat you will meet in the near future. Hook me up with one of them and\nI will help you out with your wish, whatever it will be. And to see I\nam not kidding, I will throw this in. I know a verified way for you to\nbe making an average of 1000$ a week. It requires some sacrifice, but\nto me it is well worth it. I will even tell you what it is. It is\ninterstate \"truck driving\". It is not easiest job in the world, but for\nme, it is perfect. I cannot explore the universe in a space ship, but I\ncan explore USA in a truck. And that's what I am doing. If you want to\nget into a good company, where the average 1000$/week is not a lie,\nemail me your phone number and we will take it from there. You do not\nneed experience. The training is paid for by the company.  \n\n\nHave a great\nlife.\n\n\n\nA wolf.  \n\n\n\n\n**** Just some\nthoughts that one day may turn into a book.

So, if you label the particles, 1, 2, ..., n and the boxes 1, 2, ..., M, your permutation where you have particle 1 in box 1, particle 2 in box 2... and n-M particles is the exact same permutation of particle 2 in box 1, particle 1 in box 2, and the rest of it being the same. So, think about this with a real world scenario.\n\nLet's say you have 7 particles and 3 boxes. Lay your particles out in a line.\n\nx x x x x x x\n\nSo, instead of counting permutations exactly, let's count the number of ways you can place the boxes around the particles. Because the walls are indistinguishable, you can treat the 3 boxes as **2** dividers. So, for example, we have one permutation:\n\nx x x | x x | x x\n\nAnd another permutation:\n\nx x | x x x | x x\n\nEt cetera. Thus, you can, instead of thinking of particles into boxes, think of this as box dividers into particle gaps (And there are, in this problem 6 gaps between the particles, and in general n-1)\n\nThus, how many ways are there to put M-1 dividers into n-1 gaps?

Also look at his TF2 statistics, in total it says hes played about 104 hours, but if you look at his class statistics he has less than 2 hours spread over 4 classes with very few kills and achievements. After 104 hours of gameplay you'd think someone would have at least played all the classes right? ( Idling for items most likely ) \n\n3. Also check out his his steam rating, I'm not sure if it dropped down to 1.3 recently, but if you look through the FOUR people who gave him +rep they all have a steam rating of less than 5.. Not good. That and 3 of his +rep comments were all fairly recent and on the same day.\n\nSo after a quick scan of his profile I have come to the conclusion that Hot liMit is in fact one of many alternate accounts of [C r o s b y [HAVE 5 buds+keys]](http://steamcommunity.com/id/icrosbyi) \nIts just an assumption, but if you cross reference their friends lists you'll see that both [uBuF](http://steamcommunity.com/id/uBuF) and Crossby (who gave +rep to Hot liMit) Both are on each others friends list.

There is a nice (read: consistent) alternation between whole and half step intervals. F# G A A# (C) C# [D] Eb (E) [F] {where the notes in (parentheses) are notes in the whole half octatonic scale are added in and the notes in [brackets] are notes in your scale}.

Ie, if you play D F A C for your Dm7 voicing, just move the C down to B for the G7 chord: you have your voicing right there, without having to jump up to a root-position G7 chord. Then, you can start working with tensions on the dominant 7 chords, like using the b9, #9, b13, #11, etc. Which tension you choose depends on multiple factors, like what the chord you're resolving to is (major or minor), or what the melody is doing at that time (over G7, the melody hits an Eb [the b13]; you'll want to reflect that in the chord you choose). This is one of the most fun/rewarding parts of playing jazz, the vast array of sounds/colors you can achieve through applying various tensions to dominant chords. With practice and immersion, you'll have a deeper understanding of the many ways to navigate the harmony of standards.\n\nAn important note is that the most \"important\" or \"characteristic\" notes in a jazz chord are (other than the root) the **3rd** and **7th**, also known as the **guide tones**. Take the common dominant chord progression D7 - G7 - C7 - F7 (the bridge progression of the standard I've Got Rhythm). You'll notice that the guide tones of the first chord, (F# and C), when moved down a halfstep to F and B, form the 3rd and b7 of the next chord, G7. And if you move them down again a halfstep, you get C7... and so on. That is a neat trick for navigating dominant progressions. \nAnother important trick is the **tritone substitution.** Take these chords: Em7 - A7 - Dm7 - G7 - C maj 7 (the common 3-6-2-5-1 progression, basically a 2-5 into a 2-5). One could approach the A7 as a simple dominant chord, maybe with a b9 because it's going to a minor chord. However, one can increase intrest by using the Tritone Substitution: You play to the dom. 7th chord a tritone away, Eb7. The reason you can do this is that the guide tones (the characteristic notes) actually remain the same between A7 and Eb7, they just switch around (3 goes to b7, and b7 to 3). You can also do this to the G7 chord, substituting Db7 for G7. A great benefit of this is you get a nice chromatically descending bassline - E, Eb, D, Db, C - while still maintaining the sound of the different 5-1 resolutions. Important note: the chord scale of a tritone subbed b7 chord is most commonly mixolydian #11 - for example, on that Eb7 from above, the scale would be Eb F G **A** Bb C Db Eb.\nThis stuff can be very complicated at first, but just give your mind time and space to work through the concepts, and it will become clearer.  \n\nI recommend getting [the Real Book](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Book-Hal-Leonard-Corporation/dp/0634060384), a great collection of lead sheets of some of the most important jazz standards. Play through these tunes - melody with the right hand, and chords with the left, start ing with the simpler standards. Listen to the different ways master jazz pianists approached these standard songs. There are many to check out but some of the best are [Art Tatum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apkgYw7QMhU), [Bud Powell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t5gbhk4l7k&amp;feature=related), [Bill Evans](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMHsz5VqLhM), [Herbie Hancock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmRQ0PBtXU), [Chick Corea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYiZnO0vflI), [Brad Mehldau](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPJYjVOH4GM).\nListening to the greats opens your ears up in your own playing, expanding your possibilities and knowledge.\nHope this helped give some information to start you off, wherever your musical path may take you", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329030738", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; it'll group speckles with desired objects\n\nI'm assuming for this post that you mean that the bitmap trace produces paths containing many distinct subpaths, where some subpaths are good objects and some are speckles.  (You can check if this is the case by running Path &gt; Break Apart on the path, which will separate out all the subpaths into separate objects.)  If that's not the case, and the speckles are actually connected to the good objects, the advice in this post doesn't apply at all.\n\nSo, what you probably want to do is examine each subpath in the document separately, compute its area, and remove it from the containing path if the area is too small.  Each [`M` command](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataMovetoCommands) in the path data begins a new subpath, so you want to break the path data just before each `M` (so `M C C M C C M C C` becomes `M C C`, `M C C`, `M C C`).  Each subpath can be passed individually to `cubicsuperpath.CubicSuperPath` and then to `measure.csparea` to compute its area.  Once you've filtered out the subpaths whose areas are too small, you can concatenate and `formatPath` the rest back into the original `&lt;path&gt;`'s `d` attribute (or delete the `&lt;path&gt;` node entirely, if all its subpaths are now gone).\n\nI hope this was helpful.

{"body": "I understand and agree with what you're saying here. But, let me offer another perspective.\n\nWhile Square has indeed lost their luster with the FF series (13 was abysmal no matter how you slice it), they are still doing well financially with the series. Why? Because they are catering to the current trends of the market. \n\nToday, RPG games are all about graphics, MMO-like concepts (open world, following camera, real-time interaction with enemies instead of random battles) and easy fluid combat. FF13 has all of these things - that's why it is appealing to younger gamers who have no idea what FF7 or FF9 were like. Hell, they don't even know that FF6 exists and it's still considered by many to be the best in the series. They just know the FF brand name so they buy the game. However, older fans of the series (like myself) are suckered in to buying the game on release (FF13), playing it a ton (42 hours) and not even finishing it because we completely lose interest in the bland characters, story and repetitive / easy combat. \n\nAgain I completely agree with your point. But my counter-point of sorts is that the old way of storytelling through creative use of camera angles and cut-scenes is gone and lost. The masses of gamers do not want that now. They want to be able to explore (which you can a little towards the end of FF13), embark on quests like in MMOs and button-mash X X X X to win every battle. If you challenge people these days or make them look around for things they lose interest. It's the cold hard truth. \n\nOn a personal note, I  am never buying another FF game on release again. Period. There's no substance left in these games and SE just continues to put them out to make money.

{"body": "I think you're still missing it - it's totally arbitrary that Aeolian is the \"natural\" minor. In an alternate universe where Phrygian is the natural minor scale, then there would be no accidentals either - the relative \"minor\" of C major would be E \"minor\", i.e. E phrygian. A \"minor\" would now have a key signature of one flat, because the phrygian mode is what we call the \"minor\" scale.\n\nThe reason this seems more reasonable is that if you look at the major scale, i.e. Ionian mode, these are the intervals:\n\n&gt; M2, M3, P4, P5, M6, M7\n\nBesides the two perfect intervals, all the intervals are major. In what we consider the minor scale, it's these intervals:\n\n&gt; M2, m3, P4, P5, m6, m7\n\nBut what, the OP asks, is that major second doing in a minor scale? Why not use this scale:\n\n&gt; m2, m3, P4, P5, m6, m7\n\ni.e. the Phrygian mode, which more closely mirrors the major scale? Obviously there are problems with it (e.g. the diminished v° chord), and there are reasons that Aeolian became \"minor\" instead of Phrygian, but from this POV, Aeolian seems less natural than Phrygian.\n\nEDIT: it can also be argued from the view of scales as two tetrachords. The steps in a major scale are (W W H) W (W W H), so we call W W H a major tetrachord. In Phrygian, you have (H W W) W (H W W), and even Dorian is symmetric, with the one usually called the minor tetrachord: (W H W) W (W H W). Aeolian, however, is asymmetric: (W H W) W (H W W), and so it seems like Aeolian is less of a natural counterpart to Ionian than either Dorian or Phrygian would be.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329247347", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, so I've gotten a few comments regarding explaining intervals and how the system works, so I'll try my best to do it in a way that'll cover everything.\n\nSo, what's an interval? An interval is really just the distance between two notes. To explain, lets have a go at the C Major Scale. The C Major Scale has no sharps or flats, so it goes:\n\nC to D to E to F to G to A to B, then back to C\n\n    C is the 1st note\n    D is the 2nd note from C\n    E is the 3rd note from C\n    F is the 4th note from C... etc.\n\nBut it would be far easier if you just shorten it and say\n\nC is the 1st, D the 2nd, and E the 3rd\n\nKeep in mind, though, these are what you call generic intervals. \n\nThis is a kind of complicated thing to explain without sheet music, but as long as the notes are within the same scale, then the same rules apply when counting difference. Eg: F to G would be a 2nd. D to F would be 3rd.\n\nThis is useful when you're making chords. Major and Minor chords and composed of the 1st, 3rd, and the 5th note. So, for C, we would get C (1), E(3), and G(5), and for D, D(1), F(3), and A(5).\n\nWhether it's a major or a minor chord, that depends on whether the 3rd is a Major Third, or Minor Third.\n\nNow if you want to know the exact distance between notes, especially when it's a note out of a scale, you'll want to use specific intervals. Again, this is really hard to explain without sheet music. But look at the major scale again:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nAssuming the major scale is, for want of a better word, perfect, then we can say, that from C, we have \n\n    C - 1, or Prime \n    D - Major 2nd\n    E - Major 3rd\n    F - Perfect 4th\n    G - Perfect 5th\n    A - Major 6th\n    B - Major 7th\n    C - Prime/8/1\n\nThe Major scale was very revered back in the era of earlier music. Good sounded things were thought to be good and heavenly, and 'bad' sounding things were thought to be the devil's work. The 5th and 4th were so loved that they were though to be 'perfect'. Hence the name.\n\nSo, in the example of Cmaj, we have C, E, and G; or 1, M3, and P5.\nBut in the case of D, it's quite different. The Dmajor scale is:\n\n    D - 1\n    E - M2\n    F# - M3\n    G - P5\n    A - P5\n    B - M6\n    C# - M7\n\nSo the Dmajor Triad/Chord, should be: D F# A. In the case of C, there is no F#, so the distance between the 1 and the 3rd is lowered by a semitone.\n\nF# --&gt; F\n\nThis new interval is called a Minor 3rd. A minor interval is a major 2nd lowered by a half step. This means that the 2nd or D chord in Cmajor is D minor. You can actually work this out in any major scale, and you'll find it follows a specific pattern. Cmajor, Dminor, Eminor., Fmaj, Gmaj, Amin, Bdiminished. The diminished I cannot explain without going into chords. Or in short, with capital letters being major, and lowercase letters being minor: I ii iii IV V vi vii°. \n\nFor the note, when you lower a Perfect 5th or 4, you get a diminished 5 or 4th, and when you raise any major or Perfect interval, it becomes augmented.\n\nThere's a lot more to say, but it far too wordy from here on.

Half life 1 to me is still miles in advance of these games and HL2 also does a fairly decent job of delivering dialogue although it can often still feel forced. \n\nIn some ways when games go in completely the opposite direction and separate the story from the game play like in Max Payne 1 and 2 you can end up with a far more immersive and rounded product. \n\nI also think games that are more fantasy based , not first person and not set in reality like far cry can get away with more abstract story telling , to me if the game is first person then as a player I want to maintain my established agency and not have it taken away for the sake of pushing me in a certain direction  ( unless I am pushed though level design or subtle methods that are less transparent to the player.  \"PUSH A\" is just not acceptable)   \n\nI like silly arcade and over the top games , I just hope we also see games that offer sophistication and more original , advance ways of story telling that better work with the FPS genera.\n\nGames like shadow of the colossus (ignoring the ending) also demonstrate how story can be conveyed largely through the intrinsic game play and as a result the game is far more immersive and sophisticated giving the story more impact.

So you couldnt go seige seige seige, etc. You go seige, caster, melee, seige, melee, caster. It could provide that non-spam of seige without making the ability a dead spell in teamfights.

If they try to do that you need to Q auto attack them in the face.  For example, if ahri runs at you to W auto attack then auto(attack) q her back since you do more damage at lvl 1 if you play the trade correctly as not all of her W's will hit you.  You now have lane control and can auto Q her and have hp advantage on her.  \n\nonce you hit level 4-5-6 start to stun W whoever you're laning against.  Once they get low enough to kill then stun w ult them for easy money.  Good players will back or ask for ganks so be careful of baits.  \n\nThe point of veigar isnt to passive farm and then rape everyone late game.  The point is to make the lane impossible for the other person.  Stun W R and they are 10% hp.  They now have to base or risk being killed.  W the wave and push to their tower, afterward go w farm wraiths or the jungle.  You will out cs them HARD if you play like this, and get more ap from items that just using your q to get ap.  The ap that last hits on Q gives is a trap that only people who are naive fall for.  Sure you can daintily last hit 50 ap by around 20 minutes, IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT RIGHT!?! no. you could have farmed your/their wraiths roughly 10-15 times netting you nearly 800 gold (aka a blasting wand aka 40 ap) all the while shutting down their laner making them useless.  So, hopefully you understand why the passive farm method blows major cock compared to this one.\n\nFor items,\n\nIf you are scared of being killed and not confident in your abilities whatsoever, build a RoA. Why? because you become hard as fuck to kill, you can still do all the things I mentioned before, and you have infinite mana.

So all you need blue for is CDR, and even then it's not always worth it to take it for yourself when you have RoA.\n\nIf you think you can live without RoA, then build DFG ASAP!@!

{"body": "I wrote this about a year ago on the blizzard forums (omg repost!) when I was doing the WSG rep grind.  I think it's still pretty accurate.\n\n\nWhat I've learned from WSG:\n\n\n* There exists an inverse rogue rule for the Horde: the more rogues on your team, the less likely you are to win. Once it gets over 2, you're probably going to lose.\n* Mages hate making tables. Warlocks love making soulwells.\n* Falling through the world with the flag will automatically return it to the base.\n* LoH is completely ridiculous.\n* Blood DKs are completely ridiculous.\n* Resto druids are completely ridiculous.\n* There are just too many stuns.  Stuns aren't funs.\n* Fire mages are just as annoying as frost mages. Maybe moreso. Maybe I've become so desensitized to being constantly frozen that when I see a fire mage it's a breath of fresh air. But the end of the game usually sounds something along the lines of \"FUCK THAT FUCKING MAGE\"\n* Jumping is mandatory when casting ice lance.  Or when being a Night Elf hunter.\n* Emoting before the killing blow is a good way to not get said killing blow. /eggface\n* Stampeding roar at the start is so far the best use I've seen for that ability. Sorry druids :-/\n* Turning on crusader aura is really, really hard. The other paladin should totally do it.\n* People still think t y p i n g  l i k e  t h i s  is how you yell messages cross-faction. It isn't. You just look silly.\n* BG chat is used the most when you're losing. Mostly to lay blame on the \"noobs\" and \"baddies\" and certainly not because your team has 0 healers while the other has 2 plus a group of 5 from the same server with their own pocket healer. Certainly not. \n* Majority of losses wouldn't be so bad if more people would take Kenny Roger's advice. \n* Majority of losses wouldn't happen if more people played like Kenny Powers.\n* When you get feared into a wall, turn a few cirlces, and then get stuck, you got outplayed. Sometimes a friendly member of the other team will come along and kill you to set you free. /begging helps.\n* At any given time, there are maybe 20 Horde healers queued up. Total. For all battlegrounds.  However, getting 5 in one game isn't necessarily a good thing.\n* I don't know why hand of protection is an auto flag drop but deterrence isn't. Don't they both basically do the same thing?\n* At level 85, people still mount with the flag. There should be a loading screen tip when WSG starts so the noobs can blend in easier.\n* There isn't a big enough face to palm when a tank spec requests I give him the flag and then proceeds to try and mount with it. See previous point.\n* When you really want rocket boosts to work, they'll probably just kill you instead. Because that makes engineering fun. Or something. /eyeroll\n* If something like the LFD tool was setup for the BG queue where it matched 1 healer for every 4 nonhealers, I wouldn't complain.\n* I have about a 3:1 win/loss ratio. When it's Warsong weekend, that's easily reversed. Or worse.\n* Grabbing the first flag is always a crapshoot. Where's that stupid prot pally that didn't turn on crusader aura when you need him?\n* If your name has a bunch of alt-code characters in it, it means that name was taken and you should have picked a new one. Now you just have a stupid, unoriginal name.  Good job.\n* I'm a baddie. And a noob.  And I should learn to play when I get a chance.\n* Trying to kill a healer that has another healer healing him is an exercise in frustration. Even worse when one of them has the flag. And they're both druids.  \n* There is such a thing as too many Starburst jelly beans. \n* Undergeared frost mages love grabbing the flag. It seldom ends well.\n* Having 85k health is like walking around with a giant \"FREE KILL\" sign over your head.  I'm usually not a gear snob, but you might want to do a few quests and replace those ilvl 200 pieces.\n* Horde is absolutely terrible on Sundays.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329522465", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(A/N: Not an expert! If I've made any mistakes, anyone's welcome to correct me!) \n\nAlphabets are modified based on need. We borrowed our alphabet from Latin, which during the Classical Latin period was:\n\nA B C D E G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z \n\nThis was all Latin needed, at the time, to write the sounds of their language. When it was borrowed into Old English, letters were created for sounds that existed in English, but not in Latin: rune-derived letters þ (thorn), ȝ (yogh), and ƿ (wynn) were added, along with D-inspired ð (eth) and a/e inspired æ (ash). Thorn and eth were used for the \"th\" sounds (\"this\" and \"through\"), yogh for a \"y\" sound (the letter \"y\" was reserved for the [/y/](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel) sound, or \"ü\" in modern German), wynn for our modern \"w\" sound, and ash for the \"a\" sound in \"cat.\" K, Q, and Z were trashed, because Old English didn't use those sounds (the letter \"c\" took care of any \"k\" sounds that came up, as well as our modern \"ch\" sound), and U was used instead of V (U and V were variations of the same letter in Latin at the time).\n\nAs English went through its various changes - adding, dropping, changing sounds - the alphabet also changed. Thorn and eth were dropped and replaced with \"th\" (not because of sound change actually, but because of scribes that favored Latin-origin characters), yogh was dropped and replaced with \"y\" (the earlier \"ü\" sound written by the letter \"y\" had split into \"ee\" and \"ih\" sounds by Middle English, which were then written with \"i\"), wynn was dropped and replaced with \"uu\" and eventually \"w\" (hence its name), ash was dropped and simply \"a\" was used, and some letters were re-added (like K, Q, Z, and a new J, which came from an elongated I and eventually became a letter in its own right). The most recent addition to the English alphabet was the official recognition of W (rather than \"uu\"), becoming the 26th letter of the English alphabet in the 16th century.\n\nIn the 1400s the printing press was invented, and literacy was beginning to spread. It was becoming necessary to establish an official spelling system, so that everyone could understand what they were reading, so a standard spelling was developed based off the popular English accent of the time (based in southeast England and London, called the \"Chancery Standard\"). It more or less solidified by the time Modern English came about in the 16th century, and even more so by the 17th century, when mass printing of dictionaries really started to take off. This is generally why our alphabet and spelling has remained the same for so many centuries, and why it's so difficult to make any changes or reforms.\n\nAs to the next new letter of English - who's to say? I'm sure after awhile our alphabet will need another overhaul to reflect the English actually being spoken. At the moment it seems to be working, though some words are starting to make a lot less sense (\"knight,\" \"through,\" and words with the \"silent E\" come to mind). It may be that our spelling system now will continue to be used in academic settings, while the new spelling system being developed online and via text (u no - dis 1?) will be how English is written in colloquial settings. Only time will tell! It will be a battle between Grammar Nazis, who are trying their best to maintain the \"purity\" and \"quality\" of the English language (but who may also be holding it back in some respects), and the actual users of the English language, who will continue to make changes as they see fit - language change is always rather political, so whoever ends up being most influential will determine where English will go.\n\nI hope that answers your questions!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329590946", "subreddit": "linguistics", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

I wouldn't even think about building revolver until you have your tear, catalyst, Neg cloak, and your glacial shroud.  Getting shroud is a huge part of your damage, not only because of the 425 mana, but because the CDR it gives you will get you to 40% with blue which means you have almost no delay while you combo your spells.  I find that while laning, his using his ult to heal off of creeps is enough sustain so there isn't a need to grab it then.  \n\nW has such a low cooldown, and is a ranged, non skillshot, non combo cc that does good damage.  Flash + W with a jungler that has CC can net you easy kills early game, and will allow you to punish that carry who is out of position late game. Toplane, W makes Ryze a beast as well. You can Q W Q E Q while kiting most melee, taking out a huge portion of their health if they harass or move in too far for last hits.\n\nLastly, I feel that ryze is a champion that doesn't NEED to be fed to be effective, however if you happen to be fed midgame you can do absolutely insane damage.\n\nTLDR play some Ryze.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329592318", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry to rain on your parade but the site, while great visually and seemingly very informative, paints a picture that is not entirely accurate. I feel like there should be a disclaimer that goes along with some of the charts, because while they may be correct they give people the wrong impression and are only a small snippet of the whole picture.\n\nFor instance, champion popularity, why don't we see many Top lane or Mid lane heroes in that chart? Why so many supports and ADs? Because of the selection. There are only 3~ overly viable(read hard to deal with, op, or otherwise best selection) ADs and Supports at a time, and needing one of each every game those 3 of each become seemingly overly popular. Mid and Top choices are so diverse and plentiful that the choices are spread out over many champions, garnering only one selection that is normally top (GP, due to how versatile he is as a champion in general(top,jungle, support, even mid)) and none for mid. This list, being very very current(last 7days), is also influenced heavily by what champions were just adjusted in the last patch notes, champions that people are wanting to try(Ashe). Though I will agree that this sort of representation is much more appropriate, as it is what's \"most popular\"(but in this case with Ashe it's what's FotWeek).\n\nAnother example of a bit misleading information are the toplane charts, or midlane charts. When people see W W W W W W next to Garen's name they react with \"GAREN OP! 2 STRONK!\" when they really should be taking it with a grain of salt(because there are W's next to his name in matchups he's actually known to lose). What's not explicitly stated and often overlooked is that these are *game* wins with a Garen in it vs *game* wins with another champion in it. Garen could have lost his lane horrible, but that Sona Graves bot stomped and they ended it at 22minutes. Alternatively Garen could have been getting outfarmed and slightly losing his lane, but his stronger more gank oriented jungler visited top more, allowing his team to gain a slight advantage overall from that lane. And this could have gone on to be either a very close game or a one sided game, no thanks to Garen's lack of prowess vs said champion top. This same comparison issue is relivant in mid, bottom lane, as well as the jungle as well, because there are more people in a game that determines a W than just the one you're looking at. \n\nIn my opinion the only truely accurate chart that doesn't have too many overly impactful factors is the Summoner Spells chart. All that being said I think it's interesting to look at for fun and that even though there are a *lot* of factors that impact a Win, and that the percentages are so close(almost to a state of Draw), for some champions there is a bit of a trend. One instance of this is Ezreal, who is pretty sterotypically \"weak\" by ad standards for our meta and it shows in the bot lane compisition comparison(and by a landslide no less).\n\nTLDR: People please take this with a grain of salt, no Garen is not OP.\n\nEdit: Just a bit of constructive criticism, you could also do better to include a bit more champions in the comparisons.

Here is an example of what I find missing and in my experience is one of those things that lead the layman to conclude that it's all magical formulas and strokes of genius.\n\nThose divergence like operators that most equations apply to fields are similar to the velocity of a particle you'll learn about in highschool, in the following sense, they attempt to express the infinitesimal \"change\" and then tie it with the equation to the state of the system, then solve it and find its evolution (this is like a computational description of what's going on). However the layman reading through theoretical physics (if that sounds like a joke or an oxymoron remember than unlike other fields even the advanced results in physics will to a certain extent be of interest for everyone since they sort of attempt to answer the philosophical question of \"how the world works\") has in his mind a computational model of particles having an a F v m etc. and when he sees all the differential operators he doesn't realize they attempt to do a similar thing. He also sees complex numbers or tensors and other stuff that he \"can't even multiply\" and just assumes that they are something incomprehensible or even more misleadingly that they are just there to get some calculations right and what goes on is still something that follows the a=F/m rules. Similarly people find it hard to understand what virtual work or D'alambert's principle or how the use of the inertia tensor can be justified, and that's because they don't have a \"let's find a set of computations whose results can agree with what we observe\" approach, they think in terms of physical things moving around but in a weird way only geniuses can understand. You can definitely not explain everything in a forum post, but even in \"tutorial\" like descriptions, you get all the mental experiments the pictures, diagrams and what is qualitatively physical, but you don't get it in a form that says \"so we're going to do this computation after transforming our observations in this data format and after it finishes we can transform the results back to observations\". \n\nI'm not sure if I am getting myself across but essential somebody with an engineering background that reads through these tutorials has no way to apply any of the techniques he already knows to slowly get a clearer understanding, and this is a waste.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329626453", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Throwaway time. \n\nI was at a gig with some buddies and my then girlfriend and everything was kind've cool. I don't usually have an illness and if I do get them I usually don't let them get in the way. God just wanted to fuck with me that day. \n\nSo, we're there and all transport that got us there has left, taking the 30 minute drive home and expecting to pick us up 4 - 5 hours later. Not 10 minutes into the gig did I feel a little weird. My stomach was lurching and I knew I would do well to get to the toilet before something crazy happened in the middle off the crowd. I tell the guys I need to go (we were fairly close to the front, so they moaned but I assured I'd be back.) to the toilet and do so. I get in and my face is sweating - I know it's going to be bad. The only thing that went right that day is that there is one cubicle left in that damn toilet.\n\nI throw my head into the basin and come nose to nose with the hugest shit I have ever seen in my life and projectile vomited absolutely everywhere. I reared back a few feet from the sight of that monstrous turd but needed to stay in the toilet because my body had decided every bodily fluid that was able to come out of my mouth would. \n\nI'm no stranger to vomiting but f u c k i n g hell. Not only did I feel like shit, but the sight, thought and smell of the turd in the basin - that was  now covered with the rainbow orgy of slushy phlegm, chunky bits and fuck knows what else (some of it was black, what the fuck?) was keeping my retching going. My (not so great) friend came and found me in the toilets and had me let him in, only so he could laugh at me standing in a growing puddle of my own sick \"because it's hilarious\". The guy actually chose to stand behind me and laugh than watch the gig, patting me on the back like \"yep, you're so screwed\" at regular intervals. \n\nSo, the throwing up didn't end for a long while, and my guts were in the basin, floor and walls after my little fiasco. I actually was so fucked up I couldn't leave the toilet for a longer than 10 minutes before I'd have to go back in. Fun times. I remember counting my blessings when the lift had arrived. I shouldn't have though, because everything just got more fucked up. We were literally walking towards the car we were getting a lift from (my then girlfriend's dad's car) and my stomach lurches - I groan, thinking I'm going to be sick, but instead a long mushy shite slides slowly out of my asshole as cool as you like. I stop and stand for a moment, this shit still streaming out of my asshole as I just stand. \n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\nMy friends are standing, staring at me. I look at them all \"I'm going to be sick\" I lied, and they're all like \"Cool, it's okay\" because I've been spewing my guts all night - they don't care. The only problem is I haven't been sick, I've fucking shit myself. Now, I can't get my already shitty ass out in public and take let my ass blast all over the pavement next to a main road, so I jump a fence to my right and run down a hill into an ally which you could see if you stood on the pavement - but it looked quite dark so I took the chance. \n\nI took off my trousers and boxers, and took a huuuuge shit infront of 30 - 50 moving people who were walking out the gig. My friends were looking directly into the ally so did some people who were walking past. I couldn't see their faces so well so I just carried on shitting and wiped my ass with my boxers - which are still somewhere in town. My friends retreated into the car after a little while (I hope it was because they were bored) and after my boxers were super shitstained I left it and climbed back up the hill, jumped the fence and got into the car. \n\nFirst words \"Sorry it took so long, and sorry I smell. Some tramp shat in the ally. I couldn't stop throwing up\". \n\nI hope they bought it. \n\nTL;DR : Went to a gig, come face to face with the biggest shit I've ever seen in my life, threw up for around 3 hours and probably took a shit in view of everybody who went to the gig.

{"body": "So, I have a few arguments about how this 'should' be handled:\n\n1) The larger group has better coordination (in theory) and thus will have a more coherent plan than the random people.  Thus giving them access to bans and first picks benefits the whole team.  This is an argument for 3-4 person pre-mades being top picks.\n\n2) Setting up groups so they pick together is beneficial so they can effectively coordinate their picks to work well together (ie: complementary support/AD-carry, mid/jungler, mid/top or top/jungler)  In my experience, picking a champion at the same time as the person I'm queuing with feels kind of nice, even if it doesn't add much to the game.  This argument is strongest for 2 person pre-made groups.  It could also be an argument for having a 3 person group having members placed before and after 2 person groups.\n\n3) It's not fair to people who solo-queue draft to very rarely get a chance to ban or first/second pick.  This is an appeal to fairness and emotion and less providing the highest probability of victory.  Honestly, I could see Riot using this as a means of helping increase the balance between otherwise less balanced teams, as it means the least coordinated member of the team gets the position that requires the most coordination.\n\nPersonal preferences:  The above are arguments that I feel have merit.  Once a group is found I would want teams to be formed as follows:\n\nFor team with first pick/ban:^1 ^2\n\nA-&gt;A,A-&gt;A,B: kinda shafts the solo, but gives the best chance for the team to leverage any additional communication.\n\nA-&gt;B,B-&gt;B,B: sub-optimal, used to hamper this team and weaken them slightly vs an otherwise slightly weaker opponent.  Risks having group B rage at and flame person A.\n\nA-&gt;A,A-&gt;B,B: provides the 3 players coordination over bans and picks.\n\nA-&gt;B,B-&gt;A,A: slightly sub-optimal, it gives group A the ability to strategically ban but might not be able to get desired composition.\n\nA-&gt;B,B-&gt;C,C: Gives maximum coordination in picks and balances out the solo's lack of coordination by giving them first pick.  Would only be mildly detrimental to bans due to the need for communication anyway.\n\nA-&gt;B,B-&gt;C,D: slightly worse banning, but improved coordination for group B.\n\nFor team with second pick/ban:\n\nA,A-&gt;A,A-&gt;B: totally optimal for group A, not really a good reason to move person B.\n\nA,A-&gt;B,B-&gt;A: allows maximum coordination for A and also gives them the chance to fill in any gaps left by B.\n\nA,A-&gt;B,B-&gt;B: slightly sub-optimal, otherwise the same as directly above.\n\nA,A-&gt;B,B-&gt;C: Sadly, the solo gets screwed, but the 2 groups get the highest probability of success.\n\nA,A-&gt;B,C-&gt;D: as optimal as this situation gets.\n\n^1: pre-mades are be referred to by letters.  A A A B B would be a 3 person pre-made and a 2 person pre-made.\n\n^2: in the case of a group composed of A, A, A, B, C, the B and C should be considered 1 group, but never placed first.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329758443", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The names of notes you add to chords are not always so clear.\n\nSo in the #9 case, you take a major chord, say, C E G, and you add a minor third above that, an Eb.  For some reason, this is called a #9 as if it were a D#.  Same note, though.  In the b11 case, you take a minor chord, say, C Eb G, and you add a major third above that, an E.  For some reason, this is called a b11 as if it were an Fb.  Again, same note.\n\nWhat happens is that the lower chord kind of dominates, so the upper note is heard as an addition to the chord.  So if you have the chord C E G Bb Eb, for instance, that's a C7#9 chord, because the C E G Bb are important and the Eb is an addition.  If you have C Eb G Bb E, then that's a Cm7b11 chord.  They both have the same notes, you see, but in the #9 case, the major third is voiced below the minor third, and vice-versa in the b11 case.\n\nThe #9 chord has some very interesting uses, mostly as a dominant.  For example, in C (major or minor), G7#9 is G B D F Bb, and the B wants to resolve *up* to the C and the Bb wants to resolve *down* to Ab then G.  That Bb sounds a bit alien to the chord, so it's a nifty sound.  It's useful for when you want a \"crunchy\" sound that doesn't sound too sour.  The b11 chord, on the other hand, sounds REALLY creepy; I used it to represent a vampire in one of my compositions (not the sparkly kind, obviously).\n\nWhy?  The \"last liberated interval\" or something like that is the b9; using it in a chord is almost always a really weird-sounding idea.  It's OK when it's a b9 with the root, like a G7b9 (G B D F Ab, the opening notes of I Will Survive), but it's pretty much not OK any other time.  If you ever have two notes a half step apart in a chord, you almost always want to avoid making a b9 interval with them.  For example, a G13 chord might be spelled G F B E.  You should *not* spell it G E B F.  If a chord has an E and an F, you should have the F below the E!  The principal exception is if you actually *want* ugly dissonance, especially if you're going to resolve it.  In that case, you should probably write the E and F right next to each other rather than an octave and a half step apart, because the b9 is still ugly.\n\nLIKE YOUR MOM.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329782664", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It looks like I've not been clear on what I think the method should be for figuring out intervals.\n\nIf people understand what I'm proposing and still disagree with my method, then I'm cool with that.\n\nxiipaoc outlines well what I would consider to a very similar method to the method I use. xiipaoc writes:\n&gt;The interval is from B to G (the key signature is irrelevant). Count them:\nB C D E F G\nThat's 6 notes, so it's a 6th of some sort. What kind of 6th? \n\nxiipaoc answers the question by raising the 5th above B (i.e. the F#) one semitone to get the G which is the minor 6th.\n\nI'm suggesting that, as a simpler and viable alternative, one counts the semitones for a given interval. In this instance, the first step is to realize that the distance of a minor 6th is 8 semitones.Then one counts the chromatic pitches up 8 semitones, from B to G; knowing in advance, that the answer will be some sort of G (i.e. Gb, G, G#, etc.) since G is the six letter above when starting on B.\n\nAs a prerequisite for using this method, one must memorize the number of semitones for each interval. For e.g.: that a minor second is 1 semitone, a major second is 2 semitones, a minor third is 3 semitones and so on.  Equally important for this method is the memorization of the chromatic scale, i.e.: \n\nC, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, B.\n\nIt can be useful to write out the chromatic scale and then simply move up or down the scale, realizing that each shift from one pitch to its nearest neighbour is the distance of one semitone.\n\nShort cuts, as xiipaoc writes, occur when you can use a known intervalic relationship and count up or down from there. These short cuts may come from the visualization of an instrument or simply from memory.\n\nCompare the above method, to a method that requires that one must remember at the very least, 12 differing major scales, then compare how the given pitch differs from the pitch in appropriate major scale and finally, *count* the number of semitones there is in difference (if that difference should exist), in order to finally determine an interval.  To be sure, we all need to know our major scales and once we do, this method does work. \n\nBut it certainly requires the initial memorization of a lot more information than simply remembering the chromatic scale and then the number of semitones associated for each interval. \n\nI'd argue that the knowledge of an interval is more basic than that of a scale, since scales themselves consist of interval relationships between the various degrees and the root. Therefore, I believe it's better to teach this method first before one brings in a discussion of the major scale method. \n\nMoreover, even though the major scale method works, as demonstrated as above, knowledge of the major scales is not required to determine an interval.\n\nLastly, let me say that I'm a pragmatist when it comes to music; so if using the major scale method works for you, then great. I'd argue that the more ways in which we can think of music, the better we can understand it.\n\n**TL:DR I believe counting semitones to be the most parsimonious and (relatively) fool-proof way of determining intervals. Short cuts exist that can make it very quick. Disagree with me if you'd like and perhaps I am wrong in my belief, but so far, I've not been persuaded by the arguments given here in favour of the major scale as a primary method for determining intervals.**\n\nedit: for grammar and clarity.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329895662", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think it's totally fine to bring a particularly Reddit perspective to GEB in this Reddit read-through of GEB. (I'll be waiting for the right time to say **I N D U C T I O N**.)\n\nIt seems that people are now much more familiar with this notion of pushing and popping the stack than they might have been when GEB was first released, particularly when it's a major plot device in a big-budget movie like Inception.\n\nI was thinking at first that there wasn't anything more to it than that -- after all, the \"dream within a dream\" is an old trope (see cocushio's Ducktales link). But then I noticed an interesting connection:\n\nIn Inception, they have a magical technology where multiple people join the same dream, which they can't just wake up from without a specially-triggered event. Dying in such a dream is a threat: they can't just wake up as usual, so instead (handwavey movie logic) they go to a state called Limbo and get stuck there for a long time.\n\nLet's apply that to GEB. Limbo is Tumbolia! There's a contradiction between the fact that dying in a dream forces you to wake up, and that the mechanism prevents you from waking up. The risk of dying or being caught by the dream agents is that the dream state becomes inconsistent. And just like all inconsistent systems are fundamentally the same, and all Escher prints are (according to the dialogue) fundamentally the same, the Limbo you end up in is always the same.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329950217", "subreddit": "GEB", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Some developers will tell you that when given the option 2/3rd's of their users will choose Facebook rather than try to remember yet another login and password. This has a huge value to web-apps at large. Couple that with the simple \"agree\" pages which display what information that App is looking to utilize and you're light years ahead of the competition in the ease of use and visibility areas. \n\nFacebook still has captured most people's social networks extremely well. If you don't like Facebook, chances are you hate your friend's online habits more than you hate the actual application. If you happen to like your friends, and their habits, Facebook is great for a ton of reasons.\n\nFacebook's architecture is what is really selling their IPO stock. They have a web-friendly platform that supports multiple languages, and renders differently for billions of users. Reddit has learned the hard way of what happens when you never really prepared for that kind of traffic. They've re-engineered their system a whole bunch of times and still it does only about a tenth of what Facebook can do, with less traffic to boot. \n\nIf they get out and ahead with HTML-5 app store that work on iPads, Androids, Windows and Macs using a new Facebook App Creator they could actually beat out Google, Microsoft, and Apple in the next wave of apps. The fact that a ton of these apps can access **your** social network is nothing to scoff at. Imagine buying Call of Duty via a Facebook app store. Play on any platform AND get all of your friends from Facebook right away? That's really far down the road, but not out of the question given Facebook's ability to handle a multitude of compiling languages and serve tons of people at the same time. \n\nThese are the * * P O T E N T I A L S  * * that the IPO represents.

Unfortunately you lose.  Knowing that you should win half the time you try again. And again you lose.  OK, you have lost twice at 50% odds so you should definitely win the next blink.

Because the odds of winning any individual game are always 50% it is always as likely for you to lose as it is to win.\n\nPeople like to assume that statistical percentages equate to average results. **This is absolutely wrong.** No matter how many events are in a series the odds of success will never change if it is a random system.  Statistically, never winning is as likely as winning 50% of the time because the odds of success are only based on the event that is currently happening with no regards to results of the previous events.\n\nTake that back to OP with his Blink results of one win in 37 games.  If we assume that the odds dictate average success then he has lost more than he should but I just explained why this is a false assumption.  Statistically his 1/37 success is just as likely as 5/37 or 37/37 because each event is separate.  His odds are always 1/8 no matter how many times he plays.  **No matter how many times he plays he is always far more likely to lose than win.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330122765", "subreddit": "Eve", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "While I'm not at all versed with TG voice training, I am a trained opera singer and think I might be able to offer you a little help. (I saw a post of yours in /r/makeupaddiction and that led me here. Lol)\n\nWhile I am out of practice operetically, I still enjoy singing to a lot modern female voices. Adele presently atop my list, Amy Winehouse, Alice Russell, Lily Allen, all have incredible voices (all British girls, too) and I find that (even as a born female with a fairly lower than feminine speaking voice) it is great vocal exercise. \n\nAnother thought might be to actually take singing lessons. When I first started singing, my untrained voice was ranging close to two octaves (an octave is a span of eight notes, A B C D E F G A). Now, having been training for six years, I sing a full four octaves, both very low alto and very high soprano. If you are terribly uncomfortable with having a vocal tutor, invest in a piano keyboard and a few beginner scale books, some vocal exercise recordings and teach yourself by matching the pitch of your voice to the pitch of the note you are playing on the keyboard. :)\n\nAlso, it is my understanding that hormone therapy actually does raise the tone of your voice, so if perhaps that is part of your transition, these two things in tandem will be very helpful. :)\n\nI hope my advise is useful to you!

The less rosin that's built up on your strings, the less rosin that will be produced in dust.\n\nIn order to get up to par of your playing status in the past, I can't really say. It depends on how long you've let the cello go. Psychological studies say if it's within 2 years, it'll be like you never quit. Anything over will take some relearning, but eventually yes you will remember. \n\nFor getting back into cello shape, for your right hand, I would recommend doing some creepy crawlies up your bow. Simply start with your hand at the frog in your normal playing position, then creep your position up the bow. It's a great way to get your finger strength up again.\n\nI would also recommend doing scales and slightly changing the rhythm of them. Yes, it will be boring, but it will pay off. Etudes are also excellent, and I would recommend doing the types of scale where you do turnarounds on every note. For example, for a C scale the notes would go something like C E D F E G F etc.\n\nHopefully this helps, and definitely don't get discouraged!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330229673", "subreddit": "Cello", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Comments as requested: you seem to think kass counters wayyy more than he actually does. The first thing with kass, is that you can stop him from farming pre 6, especially with a lot of the champs that he \"counters\" Cassiopia for example, kass is listed as a counter. But in reality, cass can just stay in the middle of a minion wave, if kass gets close, you just W Q E E E E, if he isn't dead he is forced back. In general kass is listed as a counter really frequently, when in reality I feel like kassadin is only a true counter to champs when he can get farm early. \n\nAlso, in my opinion neither xerath or vlad counter galio mid. Galio mid just builds like crazy MR, he is a counterpick to most mid lanes, just because they do magic damage... its a way to run a weaker damage champ, while ensuring your mid lane will win.\n\nKass definitly doesn't counter karthus... Karths E is the main reason, but the fact that karth has such long range means that when kass tries to do a RQE combo, Karth will throw up the defile, then wall + Q spam when silence is off. Also pre 6, karth has more range on his Q than kassadin has on his. This means karth can zone kass out of CS.\n\nAnd again, Kass counters leblanc? Leblanc has a longer ranged silence, she has a double silence (with ulty) she has a snare, and a teleport... Leblanc CRUSHES kass... not kass as a counter to leblanc...\n\nthose were just some random comments I had as I was browsing thru the list.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330320650", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's difficult to know how it would be in elder futhark, given how little exists of text written in that alphabet. I can therefore only comment on younger futhark (I don't know anglo-saxon or medieval. This is just a hobby for me).\n\nLike Germanarchaeologist says, I don't think there is an example of Mjölnir being mentioned in runic texts. Therefore I'm going to try to use other words. \n\n[This](http://i.imgur.com/aB53d.jpg) is a transcription i took of a runestone quite close to where I live (South-Stockholm). It says \"Sibi auk Tiarui litu raisa stain þinsa iftiR þorkil fathur sin\". In Modern Icelandic (my native language, and a convenient language to use for this on account of its similarity to old norse) this would read \"Sibbi og Tjörvi létu reisa stein þennan eftir Þorkel föður sinn\" (Sibbi and Tjörvi had this stone raised in memory of Thorkel, their father). The Icelandic (and norse) name for Thor's hammer is Mjölnir. Now, the use of \"i a\" in Tiarui where now we have \"j ö\" in Modern Icelandic, and the common use of \"i R\" in iftiR and other words that end in \"ir\" (it's not unheard of to use the [other \"r\"](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Runic_letter_raido.png) in the end of a word, but it's far more common, especially after i that the final \"r\" becomes [this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Runic_letter_yr.png/90px-Runic_letter_yr.png) makes me think that the spelling of Mjölnir would be m i a l n i R, or exactly like the first picture in your post. That's the correct one in my mind. The exact style can vary, the lines can for instance be curved rather than straight in m and R. It's common to see curved lines on stones, but straight ones were easier to make in wood.\n\nThe aesthetics are a matter of taste I suppose, but I prefer the younger futhark to the second picture in your post. I don't know exactly, but it looks like Anglo-saxon futhark, and I don't know much about that.

{"body": "&gt; While she initiated the \"break\", I completely agreed it was necessary. We both need some time to spend on improving our separate lives, without relying on one another so much.\n\n&gt; But here's the problem. About 1.5-2 months before this happened, she had been expressing doubts about our relationship. She said that she is worried because we're both really inexperienced and she thinks that it will cause us to fuck up down the road as we get more serious.\n\nJust so you know, a break means you broke up. She's now free to sleep with any guy she pleases, and reserves the right to keep you in her back pocket to go back to if things don't work out as planned. Her saying she doesn't have any experience outside your relationship tells me she's got \"grass is greener syndrome\" and is looking for a little *strange* to see what she's missing out on.\n\n&gt; When she said that she wanted us to \"go out and have fun\" during our break, I freaked out a little, assuming that she was just using it as a way to party or get with other guys. But when I expressed that concern the day after we broke up, she said \"I know you think it's so I can go and party and shit. But it's not, and I want to get that across.\"\n\nI'm raising the bullshit flag right now as this is grade A classic posturing. My advice, **judge her by her actions, not her words.** The odds of her messing around with other guys is almost certain. \n\n&gt; I trust her entirely, and she even expressed that she would be upset if I was with someone else during this, but this seemed kind of contradictory to what she said about having doubts earlier. I'm worried that if I call her out on it she will see it as me not trusting her (I had a serious trust issue in the past that we worked through, after a very rough few days of fighting/crying).\n\nYou should NOT trust her entirely. She's on a break and free to do whoever the hell she pleases, and since you two are on a break it doesn't count as cheating so there won't be any guilt on her part (if she's hot for another guy anyway, which may have been what promoted this situation). That's the reality of the situation you need to face. Mark my words, she wants you to not move on in case her little plans don't pan out. This is why you should N E V E R agree to a \"break\". It's breaking up on her terms, pure and simple. \n\nThere are times that all this isn't so, but those instances are so rare it's just not worth betting your emotional well-being on IMO.\n\n----\n\nNow for the good news: there's lots other women out there and you're bound to find someone that's a good match for you. Plus you really shouldn't waste your youth with one relationship. Get out there and experience the world, find out what you want (and don't want) in a relationship, and sample the cuisine, so to speak.

{"body": "Hey thanks for so much thought. In the interest of getting the most clear and accurate information up here, I'm going to hash out a few of these points with you:\n\n&gt; For one, it just gives you a better understanding of how the modes fit into each other.\n\nIn general, I feel that this idea is what most confuses people. Yes, you can **derive** all the modes (1) by playing the diatonic major scale for one octave starting on the 1, then again starting on the 2, etc. and (2) by playing the diatonic major scale, and then flattening the 7th (Mixolydian), then the 3rd (Dorian), then the 6th (Aeolian), etc. However, this tends to make it more difficult for someone to **understand** and **use** these modes, and they won't develop their ear as well.\n\nWhat I mean is, at any given moment in a song, there is (usually) one mode that qualifies. If you are jamming along to Pachabel's Canon in D major, the only mode you are playing is D Ionian. Even when it goes to the F# minor chord, if you take a run like F# G A B C# D E F#, you DID NOT switch to F# Phyrgian; you just played an octave of D Ionian starting on the 3rd.\n\n&gt; Some little facts: Note that the two numbers next to any mode make up that mode's tritone. If you remove the tritone from any mode, you will get that mode's pentatonic scale. Lydian and Locrian have no pentatonics as they both have the root as part of their tritone.\n\nSome discrepancy here. Pentatonic means 5 note/octave scale, and there are many, many ways of producing a 5 note scale. Most commonly, we would use the anhemitonic scale, which is simply a scale without semitones. You can take any of the diatonic modes and cut out the semitones to produce this. For a C Lydian anhemitonic scale, you would cut out the #4 and 7 and have C D E G A (which is enharmonic to the C Ionian and C Mixolydian). For C Locrian anhemitonic, you can cut out the b2 and b5 to get C Eb F Ab Bb.\n\n&gt; Take a common jazz trope of this: When playing in Ionian, the 9 in the iii9 chord is a flat ninth (two) (aka Ionians fourth). It sounds correct, but somewhat dissonant. So often times, people will borrow the sharp fourth of Lydian (Ionian's fourth mode) to smooth it out. You can always just straight up switch modes too.\n\nYes, this is definitely more the right idea. If we are in C Ionian, playing an E-9 chord would be a modal change to C Lydian (and not E Locrian). Although the notes may be the same, the modal idea is that something has changed to our key center, C. \n\nExceptions to this example would be:\n(1) if the key center changed from C to something else. In these cases, it's most often x-Ionian changing to y-Ionian (or y-Aeolian).\n(2) if the natural 9 alteration (on the iii-9 chord) was used as a passing tone, in a melodic phrasing. This kind of idea would have more of a bebop/chromatic feel than some type of modal shift.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330556670", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Your comment is spot on, so I'll just add the fancy names to some random thought:\n\nThe ~~kerning~~ tracking* is so loose the words are falling apart.\n\nThe intervals are all equal, between letters, between words, between the lines, all that evenness makes for a floating design.\n\nThe hierarchy is screwed up. I read Cali then \"EAM\", completely missing the D due to a lack of background contrast. And *then* I go back and read \"fornia\".\n\nThe page weight is off, with the type feeling like it sits below the horizon instead of on it (hint, you typically want the visual weight slightly above the horizon in an image so centered, with a little more white space at the bottom than top).\n\nThey've completely bastardized the typeface, stretching out the C and twisting the bar of the L upward oddly. They didn't even put the bar on the same angle/width as the crossbar in the A. It looks wrong because they changed some of the details that hold the face together as a unit.\n\nThe F is so far out of the line elements it looks like it went skiing down a hill.\n\n*I have thought about which word to use here and changed my mind.
