Let's describe the recursive types built from polynomial components.\n\n    data U : Set where\n      rec' zero' one' : U\n      _+'_ _*'_ : U -&gt; U -&gt; U\n      mu' : U -&gt; U\n\nThis is a *syntax* for defining a recursive datatype, with rec' being a placeholder for recursive stuff and mu' allowing us to mention another recursive datatype.

But what do these descriptions mean? Agda lets us interpret each description in U as a strictly positive functor (i.e., the parameter X is never used left of -&gt;), and then we can tie the recursive knot once, for all.\n\n    El : U -&gt; Set -&gt; Set\n    data Mu (F : U) : Set where\n      [_] : El F (Mu F) -&gt; Mu F\n    El rec'      X = X\n    El zero'     X = Zero\n    El one'      X = One\n    El (S +' T)  X = El S X + El T X\n    El (S *' T)  X = El S X * El T X\n    El (mu' F)   X = Mu F\n\nWith this interpretation in place, we can actually define the constructors for our encoded datatypes.\n\n    zero : Mu nat'\n    zero = [ inl &lt;&gt; ]\n    suc : Mu nat' -&gt; Mu nat'\n    suc n = [ inr n ]\n    leaf : Mu nat' -&gt; Mu natTree'\n    leaf n = [ inl n ]\n    node : Mu natTree' -&gt; Mu natTree' -&gt; Mu natTree'\n    node s t = [ inr (s , t) ]\n\nYou can use the defined constructors in expressions, but sadly you're currently obliged to use the raw polynomial constructors in patterns.\n\nLet's show that they all have decidable equality.

{"body": "I totally disagree with this article, I frequently play Karma and if she's played right can be a formidable champ. It's true that taking 6 levels to get to the equivalent of a normal champs lvl 5 ability is a slight disadvantage, however the fact that you don't have to spend 3 levels on an ulti makes it work out roughly the same, you've got one more point to spend on every move. Built correctly she's surprisingly tanky, as when on low health her passive means her shield blocks more and when combined with her Mantra also does more aoe damage, so when on low health using a quick R E R Q combo can deal significant damage while sheilding you from damage and then healing, if followed by a W on the chasing champ it not only slows them but speeds you effectively doubling the boost. Not to mention you can shield then heal then speed boost allies, and also shield and heal minions which is awesome for taking turrets. The aoe damage from her sheild also makes her a viable mid, as you can keep enemies off the minions/stop champs getting last hits, and farm entire groups in one move. If you build her as an AP tank (only using items that grant both AP and either Armour or MR) she becomes an extremely tough champion, not to mention that many people underrate her and don't know what she's really capable of. \ntl;dr If you play her right Karma's really good, and the fact that many people don't know what she can do only helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330855691", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

And when you die u LOSE EVERYTHING. You figure out that if you make it back to where u died you can get your stuff back but you prolly wont make it. You frantically race back to that place and die b4 you get it and there is only one chance. if you die b4 you get to where you died b4 and you had 20000 souls racked up, THEY R GONE. TUFF T I T T Y.

I played for 4 hours. still on the first board. and back to final fantasy 13 for me. CHeckpoints!!! thats it. I can deal with it being hard but its unrealistic \n\nEven in life when you fail u start over and then when u succeed you r past that thing and dont have to worry about it anymore.

My (incomplete) understanding is that it has to do with the fact that if you were to play triads (so chords that are made up of thirds) diatonically throughout a scale, you're going to get mostly major and minor chords. So it stands to reason that if the majority of chords from a key are either major or minor, then the two most common keys used are going to be major and minor. \n\n\nSo, for example.. if you take the key of C major and you work through the triads you get:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nC E G = C major\n\n\nD F A = D minor\n\nE G B = E minor\n\nF A C = F major\n\nG B D = G major\n\nA C E = A minor\n\nB D F = B diminished\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330971120", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Using a WASD setup, this leaves Q E R F Z X C as the prime 'real estate' for the remaining binds, maybe expanding to T G V as necessary.  My concern is whether or not we can have class or character specific bind setups.  On an elementalist, I would have 1-4 bound as the attunements, with 5 / 6 / F1 / F2 / F3 as the remaining heal/utility/elite skills, which is different from how I would set up say a warrior, who only has one alternate skill to bind.\n\nTo each their own, but I disagree with anyone binding large numbers of keys on their mouse, there is no way you can activate those buttons as quickly as you could keystroke on a keyboard.  Having 1-2 mouse binds for something like auto-run / voice comms is fine, but trying to bind large numbers of keys will not be optimal for pvp.  Additionally people using shift modifiers, shift+1 is much much slower than simply hitting Q or another bind esp if you are trying to combo, which looks to be how a lot of the GW2 pvp is going to be.  Only use modifiers if you run out of nearby-keys and really need additional bindings.\n\nOn a side note, when I played Pac-tri Healer in DAoC and literally had the majority of the keyboard bound, I used an ESDF setup instead of WASD, as it gave me easy access to more keys.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1330979772", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It baffles me how many MMO players ignore binding stuff to:\n\n\n***Q E R F Z X C V***\n\n\nThese are the easiest keys to reach for most every human while holding down W to run. A+D should be bound to strafe left/right. Note that E is the single easiest key to spam for most humans while moving with W. Your most used attack is optimally bound to this key. C and V are both very easily triggered by your left hand thumb and should be considered for high traffic abilities as well.\n\n*The goal should be the ability to fight and move without interruption to either. The best way to test your keybinds for efficiency is to hold down W and see what keys you can depress without letting go of it.*\n\nAuto-run is not advised as a replacement for moving with W in combat. It can be used in some situations, but the act of toggling on and off running is subpar to being able to control movement more effectively. Clicking both mouse buttons down to run introduces fatigue and limits your ability to use mouse for click targeting when tab doesn't suffice; therefore it is not advised.\n\nAdditional easy to reach keys can also be bound appropriately:\n\n***T G B 3 4***\n\nFor people with small hands T and G may be more difficult to reach, but B is easily activated by your thumb which typically idles on space bar. In order to press 1 or 2 most people will have to move their left hand middle finger off of W for a moment. This is sub-optimal. Ideally 1 2 are used for abilities on a longer CD that won't need to be pressed often in combat, but 3 4 make great binds that are only slightly more difficult to reach than QERFZXCV. If you haven't already intuited by now, the default game UI bindings for these keys should be reassigned. How often do you need to open your character window quickly or reply to a chat in combat? You can reply with /r almost as quickly without sacrificing prime key real estate.\n\nBinding most of your attacks and important defensive cooldowns to QERFZXCV or some shift/ctrl/alt modifier of those simply *will* enable you to be more effective.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331051640", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I hate to say this, but the actual gameplay of a lot of most adventure games just wasn't that good in many cases. It largely consisted of taking things out of your inventory and attempting to put them on other things in the order the game designer had in mind. If you had a pole and a broom, you absolutely have to use the pole in one area and the broom in the other, event though they can pretty much do the exact same thing. It feel like I'm trying to answer a riddle from the Sphinx - what if I come up with an answer that's entirely consistent with the question, but just happens to not be the \"clever\" one he had in mind? Does he still eat me? Yes, my friend. Yes he does.\n\nNow, the story, atmosphere, etc... in adventure games could often be quite good. And there would be some decent puzzles every now and again - puzzle puzzles, rather than the inventory stacking exercises. The problem was, they used these inventory stacking excercises far far too much. It's just a bad puzzle. It's like when I first started Skyrim, and I first solved the puzzle in the first dungeon where you have to rotate three obelisks to match up with three pictures that are inevitably sitting right next to the obelisk that's supposed to be turned to it. It's like a quiz where there are six letters, A A B B C C, and you are told that you have to match the pairs.\n\nI was like, gee, that's a horrible puzzle. Probably won't see that again.

{"body": "Here's a quick explanation. Many people change keys using the circle of fifths/fourths. You can also change parallel modes using the circle of fifths/fourths. The guitar is tuned to the circle of fifths/fourths (except the B string), therefore it's very easy to change modes by moving a pattern down/up a string (accommodating the B string of course). Maybe I should make a lesson where all the strings are tuned to the circle of fifths? It might make people understand.\n\nParallel modes are basically when you change keys but emphasis the same note. For example, you're playing in the key of C. Change to the key of Bb (via circle of fourths if you want). And emphasize the C note. Since C is the 2nd note of Bb you are playing C Dorian. i.e. C major to C Dorian\n\nThere is another type of mode called \"Relative.\" It's when you stay in the same key. The key of C is C D E F G A B. If you played those notes and emphasized the D you would be playing D Dorian. i.e. C major to D Dorian\n\nI think if you study Chart 1 it should become clear. BUY A NOTEBOOK. Think of it as a puzzle. I've got 30 or more notebooks filled with this stuff.

{"body": "I was in your situation not to long ago. I had the cords down for the most part.  I could play some songs. But once I got to that point I started to flounder.  My friends kept telling me to look at the Blues.  I finally did and I found out that the most common song progression is the the blues progression 1&gt;&gt;4&gt;&gt;5 pattern. Here is a fast whats up. The first thing to do is to assign the whole notes A B C D E F G a number value 1=A 2=B 3=C 4=D 5=E 6=F 7=G.  So taking the example 1&gt;&gt; 4&gt;&gt; 5 = A &gt;&gt; D &gt;&gt; E. Transposing would be shifting the numbers. So to play the blues in \"E\" the whole note would become 1.  SOOooo 1&gt;&gt; 4&gt;&gt; 5 is now E &gt;&gt; A &gt;&gt; B.  If you play an open E and then slide down the heavy strings to a barred A and then back to open E and then to Barred B to Barred A and back to open E you have got the progression.  A more extreme example can be found [here.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM) I recommend getting some high level Blues instructional DVD's like Learn &amp; Master Blues Guitar with Steve Krenz.

{"body": "I'm not sure what you mean by \"this technique\". Turning the guitar face up  in your lap? \n\nFirst, for reference, the guitar strings are numbered 1 (thinnest) through 6 (thickest). Starting with 6, you usually tune E A D G B E.\n\nThis kid is tuned D A D F# A D (start with normal guitar tuning, tune 6,2,1 down a [whole step](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/understanding-half-steps-and-whole-steps.html) and 3 down a half step).\n\nIf you get it right, just strumming the strings without fretting anything should sound great.\n\nNow, assuming you're holding the guitar like this kid: lay your left finger behind the 3rd fret and press down until the strings are touching the metal. Press hard enough to make the notes clear, but no harder (or you'll detune the notes and it'll sound shitty).\n\nTo get the sound this kid has, you can ignore strings 1 and 2. Fret strings 3 through 6, leaving 1 and 2 open. Now try this same \"chord\" on the 5th fret and 7th frets. You'll recognize the sounds from the video. \n\nOnce you get the hang of it, try this: push down at the 3rd fret, strum, then slide up to the 5th fret without lifting your finger. Cool!\n\nNow try this: using your right finger as drum stick, hammer the side of your finger onto the strings directly *on top of* 12 fret (not behind it, as when fretting a chord) and let it bounce off so the strings can ring freely. If you do this right, you'll bring out [harmonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_harmonics), which are higher pitched bell like tones (they are normally there, you're just making them \"pop out\" more). You can get harmonics from other frets, but it's harder. Try the 5th and 7th frets next.\n\nPractice every day. It's better to put in 10 minutes every day than 1 hour every 6th day. Part of learning is processing that happens while you sleep. You lose this when you skip days. Give it a few weeks and you'll be surprised when you pull off using just these tools.\n\nNow, the finger picking that this kid does at the start and end of the video will probably take you longer to learn. Start with [Travis Picking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fqvEbkjBNQ), which is one of the first patterns most guitarist learn, and is similar to what the kid is doing in the video.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331494526", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Just for fun, I'ma gonna give you the whole enchilada, just because.\n\n\n1) key *signature* refers to the number of sharps/flats.\n\n2) Take a song. Notice what notes it uses. Notice what note feels like \"home.\n\nNow line the notes up, low to high, starting and ending with home.\n\nThere is nothing special about this thing, it's just a nice simple way to look at what notes we're dealing with, what *set* of notes the tune draws from. We call it a scale.\n\nNotice the third note of the scale -- how far is it from home?  \nIf it's two whole steps away, it probably has a clear, bright sound to you.  \nIf it's a whole and a half, it probably sounds dark, sober.  \n  \nYou have been trained to react this way by your culture. We call those two choices \"major\" and \"minor\" thirds, and we feel that they color the entire scale, define the whole song. We call this \"tonality\".  \n\nNow look at the rest. Notice which notes sound stable, which sound wobbly or unfinished or yearning? Notice how some notes are \"just passing through\" and which feel like they've \"arrived\"?  Notice where each of those notes are. \n\nLook at the whole scale and stop thinking of it as a unique bunch of letters. \nInstead, assign each note a number -- like we're doing algebra, using x's and y's, except with music.  \nLOOK WHERE THE HALF STEPS ARE. These are usually the places where notes seem to lean against each other, lead to each other. ANY TIME YOU HAVE A HALF STEP, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THERE'S A FEELING OF INSTABILITY IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE NOTES.  \n\nTake a LOT of classical, folk, and pop music and chart it out and you will find this pattern:\n(we all know that 8=1, right?)\n\n1  2  **+3**4  5  **+6  +7**8   .\n\n3 has the major feel, and 7 yearns strongly up to 8. 6 does a little, too.\n\nThis is the Ionian mode. It gets used so much we simply call it \"THE major scale\" (although jazz and trad players sorta laugh at us).\n\n\nHere's the other common pattern:\n\n1  2**-3**  4  5**-6  -7**  8\n\n\nIt's called Aolian. 3 has the dark feel, and 6 leads pretty strongly down to 5. 7 leads down too, especially when you start on 8 and come right down through both of them.  \n\nWe cheat and call this \"the\" minor scale.\n\nOh, and by the way? You know that feeling of  +6  and +7 leading up to 8 that we use in major tunes?  \nWe like it so much that we tend to stick it into minor tunes a lot too. Whenever the *melody* is yearning upward we use the + versions, and whenever the *melody* is moving downward we use the - versions. So we get something like this:\n\n1   2 **-3**   4   5   **+6   +7** 8   **-7   -6** 5   4  **-3**2  1\n\n..and we call it the **melodic minor** scale.\n\n\nThose two modes are so common that we've gotten sloppy and now call them \"the major and minor scales\" and everything else \"modes\". \n\n \nPfeh.   \n\n\nHere's the other two, they're LOTS of fun, and trad/jazz/blues players use them ALL THE TIME.\n\n1   2  **+3** 4    5   **+6 -7**  8\n\n3 is major, +6 yearns up, -7 yearns down, and the two sorta tent against each other, creating a neat little balance point. You can hear it if you play C D E F G A Bb,  A Bb, A Bb... \n\nIt's called Mixolydian. \n\n\nNow, take Mixolydian, and change just one note: swap out +3 and put in -3, the minor third.\nNow you've got that dark minor sound AND that cool little tented effect with 6 and 7.\n\n1  2  **-3**  4  5  **+6-7**  8\n\nC D Eb F G A Bb, A Bb....\n\nThat's Dorian. Anytime you hear a ballad that sounds super-moody, or a fiddle tune that reminds you of lonely moors? You're probably listening to Dorian.\n\n\nSo there you go.\n\n\nScales are just convenient layouts.\n\nModes are the different arrangements of \"leaning\" notes, half steps and whole steps. \n\nKeys are these modes *assigned to actual notes.* Not just a theoretical pattern, but the real letter that sounds like \"home\".\n\nThe key signature is the bunch of sharps or flats at the beginning of the staff.\n\nThe four most popular modes (unless you play Bernstein or Prokofieff, who liked Lydian, or Arabic/Persian/Klezmer/Indian, in which case all bets are off) are: \n\nIonian Aeolian Mixolydian and Dorian.\n\nMost classical players cheat and say \"Major and Minor\" for the first two, and avoid discussing the others whenever possible.

{"body": "There are three key assumptions in your question that are arbitrary and skew the discussion:\n\n&gt; **elements** of the theistic models\n\nThe problem here is that you cannot compare just elements of a model with elements of a different model, then postulate that just looking at / exchanging those parts the complexity of the remaining part of the model remains unaffected.\n\nExample:\n\nModel 1: a b c d a b c d e f g h\n\nModel 2: x x x x b c d e f g h i\n\nCompare the first 4 letters of each model as an \"element\" of the model. Now which element is simpler? Obviously it is the first 4 letters of model 2 (xxxx) compared to the first 4 letters of model 1 (abcd). However, does that mean the simpler element has to be preferred, after we evaluated it *on its own*?\n\nWell, let's try it, let's exchange the more complex element of model 1 with the simpler element of model 2, and we get this:\n\nModel 3: x x x x a b c d e f g h\n\nSimpler, right? No, actually it is *not*, because by encoding the more complex element in conjunction with the rest, the overall complexity is lower (in this example) than if we encoded the more simple element in conjunction with the rest.\n\nI'm not saying that accounting for some god necessarily has explanatory power over different parts of the model, this is just to show how the \"let's compare elements\" is fallacious.\n\n&gt; which are more simple than their **equivalents** in non-theistic models\n\nNow how would we go about finding the equivalent part in different models? That presupposes way too much about the structure of the models.\n\nTo measure the complexity of a model, you'd try to get the maximally compressed representation of that model, some (at first glance) unintelligible representation of it. Now you take a model that may or may not share certain characteristics, and do the same. What is the equivalent? How would you even go about finding those? We're trying to be thorough here, not have some kind of ad hoc rule of thumb heuristic that sounds good, but that we just made up.\n\n&gt; to the extent that they justify the assumption that god(s) exist?\n\nIt's reasonable to be purely agnostic, using Occam's Razor for metaphysics is *one* approach, but certainly not a mandatory one. You can choose different approaches, or interprete the arguments differently, but still if you do interprete them differently you'll hold a belief (in the Bayesian sense) either way as soon as you say basically anything on the matter:\n\n\"Probably, A is the case\" -&gt; Belief in (Probability of A) = high\n\n\"The probabilities of both A and ~A are equal\" -&gt; Belief in A = 50%\n\n\"Probably, A is not the case\" -&gt; Belief in ~A = high -&gt; Belief in A = low\n\nWhether you define A to be \"dark matter exists\", \"god(s) exists\", \"god(s) do not exist\" doesn't change that.\n\nTherefore, saying \"to the extent that they justify the assumption that god(s) exist\" uses an unscientific notion of what a claim you make about reality is, if it is meant to imply \"... and therefore I'll stay with the assumption that god(s) do not exist\".\n\n\nThis is not intended as nitpicking at all, it's just that there is no easy way to discuss this, it is *such* a small step to a \"begging the question\" fallacy.\n\nIf you clarify what you mean by your questions, I'll do my best to answer.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331813471", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When you say \"we\", so you mean \"the west\"? I happen to have studied quite a lot of music through different means and ethnomusicology shows the way culture informs the values you assign to these recognisable patterns like 'major' or 'minor'. \n\nThere's most certainly nothing natural about it although your ideology naturalises your experience of the world, otherwise you wouldn't be able to find any comfort in the repetition. Repetition is the key to music. Repetition is the key to music. All music, no matter what key it's in relies on repetition. For example, IIRC in South Korea, what we know as the diminished 7th chord (a chord with 3 minor third intervals which the west hears as horrific and dissonant) this chord sound is linked with elation and happiness. \n\nAnother example to help uproot your analysis of the major and minor scale, C major consists of the following notes... C D E F G A B C. \nA minor consists of the following notes A B C D E F G. Notice anything? They both have the same intervals, they only begin at different points in the scales. You could make a piece using all chords in those scales without using C Major or A minor and the piece could be considered to be in either key.\n\nThe things you've heard in the past act as a sort of filter for your hermeneutic process. For many years, our western culture has informed us of things like talent and virtuosity but these are not measurable or quantifiable things. The truth is that there is no objectivity and in fact music is the process by which interpret sounds that are known to be intended as music, through whichever process each individual seems to have set up for themselves. \n\nYou may use genre as a type of filter, you may enjoy the sound of electric or acoustic guitars. You may prefer certain time signatures or timbres but all of these things (and believe me, many more) work together to help your brain analyse whatever it is you're listening to with the purpose of 'musicing' (Musicing is a neologism that I'm using for the process itself which your brain uses to interpret music).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331882158", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Therefore, we \ncan assume, no gun was initially drawn/shown to the victim.\n2 - Zimmerman approached the youth (we have no idea what was said), but a scuffle did ensue (evidence of bloody nose and back of head), \ntherefore, Zimmerman pulled his gun and shot the kid.\nUnless Zimmerman actually ATTACKED THE KID FIRST, he was within his rights to sh00t the kid.\n\nRacist? Who, me?!\n&gt;Does anyone else think this teen could have been a thug canvasing homes in a money community to decide on which one to rob?\n\nIf only more people were as courageous as young Mr. Zimmerman:\n&gt;Sounds like he really watched his neighborhood and kept the police informed on what was going on.  That is what good citizens do.  Sounds like he was the only one brave enough to stick his head out the door.\n\nClearly, all part of the Obama conspiracy to take your guns!\n&gt;When is a Hispanic man White?

In fact, to even suggest that the war exists is to be discredited. So let's start suggesting, immediately.\nNo matter how crime figures are massaged by those who want to acknowledge or dispute the existence of a Dirty War, there is nothing ambiguous about what the official statistics portray: for the past 45 years a large segment of bIack America has waged a war of v i o l e n t retribution against white America.\nAnd the problem is getting worse, not better. In the past 30 years, violent crime has increased more than six times faster than the population. Young bIacks (under 18) are more v i o l e n t than previous generations and are 19 times more likely to be arrested for m u r d e r than young whites\n\nBelieve it or not, these comments are nothing compared to what's being posted on Glenn Beck's site, the Blaze.

It lets me be more fancy.\n\nHere's a fun couple of batch files, put them in your path somewhere and follow [this guide](http://www.intelliadmin.com/index.php/2007/09/autorun-for-the-command-prompt/) to get it to autorun whenever a command prompt is opened.

Forces text color to red on black or gray on black, depending on whether your command prompt is elevated or not.  I find it very useful.  Just don't try to change the text color in the Command Prompt Properties and wonder why it doesn't stick!\n2. Puts \"User:\" in the title bar like elevated ones have \"Administrator: \".\n3. Emulates various Linux terminal GUIs in changing the title to the current folder.  Uses doskey macros for this... IIRC the commented out line (REM) is because it takes way too long to make all 26 aliases for all drive change commands so there might be a noticeable delay when opening a command prompt, so I cut it down to drive letters I use or often use.\n\n**autoexec.cmd**\n\n    @echo off\n    copy nul \"%systemroot%\\system32\\delete.me\" &gt; nul 2&gt; nul\n    if errorlevel 1 goto user\n    if exist \"%systemroot%\\system32\\delete.me\" goto admin\n    \n    :user\n    color 07\n    doskey cd=echo off$Tcd $*$Ttitlepathhelper /user$Techo on\n    doskey chdir=echo off$Tchdir $*$Ttitlepathhelper /user$Techo on\n    doskey pushd=echo off$Tpushd $*$Ttitlepathhelper /user$Techo on\n    doskey popd=echo off$Tpopd $*$Ttitlepathhelper /user$Techo on\n    rem for %%x in (a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z) do doskey %%x:=echo off$T%%x: $*$Ttitlepathhelper /user$Techo on\n    for %%x in (c d e f g h i j k l u w x y z) do doskey %%x:=echo off$T%%x: $*$Ttitlepathhelper /user$Techo on\n    call titlepathhelper /user\n    exit /b\n    \n    :admin\n    del \"%systemroot%\\system32\\delete.me\"\n    color 0C\n    doskey cd=echo off$Tcd $*$Ttitlepathhelper$Techo on\n    doskey chdir=echo off$Tchdir $*$Ttitlepathhelper$Techo on\n    doskey pushd=echo off$Tpushd $*$Ttitlepathhelper$Techo on\n    doskey popd=echo off$Tpopd $*$Ttitlepathhelper$Techo on\n    rem for %%x in (a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z) do doskey %%x:=echo off$T%%x: $*$Ttitlepathhelper$Techo on\n    for %%x in (c d e f g h i j k l u w x y z) do doskey %%x:=echo off$T%%x: $*$Ttitlepathhelper$Techo on\n    call titlepathhelper\n    exit /b\n\n**titlepathhelper.cmd**\n\n    @echo off\n    if !%1==!/user goto user\n    \n    title %cd%\n    exit /b\n    \n    :user\n    title User: %cd%\n    exit /b\n\nHmm what else do I have in here...\n\n**AddToPath.cmd**\n\n    @path=%PATH%;%CD%\n\nAhh nice and simple.\n\n**exec.cmd**\n\n    @start \"\" %*\n\nGot tired of start's behavior of opening a command prompt with a custom title if the first parameter is quoted.\n\n**createbatches.cmd**\n\n    @echo off\n    for %%x in (%1) do echo @exec \"%%~fx\" %%* &gt; \"D:\\User\\Path\\%%~nx.cmd\"\n\nRight, this one creates a batch file for a file or wildcard you pass in (usually a .exe file).

In the \nMSDOS days my dad actually had a large batch file system that leveraged PKUNZIP/PKZIP... he kept all our games compressed in ZIPs.  We'd run the batch file with the zip name and it would decompress the game, run it, and then compress any changed files into a separate ZIP.  So if you wanted a fresh game install you just wiped the second ZIP to remove all saved data etc.  Saved a bit on disk space too back when all you had was 80MB.\n\nHe also had a variant that would do the same with games on CDs (those large 500+ shareware game CDs) so you wouldn't even need to install any, just the saved games would be local and it'd extract the game from the CD to play.\n\nSadly we do not have these masterpieces anymore.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332378405", "subreddit": "linux", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

After the show I met up with my father and he said he didn't see or hear anything really and that they put them all in a catered room or something?  But he never made it inside with me...\n\nWe all single-filed inside and I remember they were giving out t-shirts to people that came wearing a white shirt I believe because of the tv cameras...so we walked onto the set and you could see the stage and the seats and the flowers and the instruments and the lightening...the people filing in, everyone there that was working to organize it...it was just like BAM - in your face 10 second walk to soak in all in real fast as you got to your seat...fortunately for me I got hooked up with a great spot with an incredible view...I was beside myself for sure.  I remember having the biggest friggin' grin on that you could imagine...I was just looking around the whole studio and smiling in amazement...it was truly an incredible sight to take in, especially at 15 and actually being there, inspired by the music and of course wanting to pursue music myself. It was just incredible...\n\nThey came out...everyone went crazy...they got settled in. Tuned up.  Messed around for a little...and the rest is history that you've all probably seen countless times...\n\nWorst and best part for me...after the show was over, they were trying to single-file everyone out again and move them out in a hurry...I totally remember that...they tried to keep it as orderly as possible...but people were trying to surround Kurt, which they did...but I saw that I was closest to Novoselic...so I went right down to him and he was talking to someone as tall as him I remember...I smiled up at him and waited for him to finish, cause it seemed like he knew that person and I wanted to give him the respect he deserved - I was 15, it was beyond comprehension for me at that point what I just witnessed...they were Rock Gods to me... so he looked down at me and I said something to the effect of \"Incredible show, that was amazing...can you please sign my ticket?\" as I pulled out my stub and a pen I had in my pocket just in case...  And lol, you know what he told me... \"Sorry, my hand/wrist hurts\"... I was destroyed needless to say...I was 15...lol   Then I walked away from him with my ticket in my hand and saw the line that they were trying to get everyone into like sheep to file out...so I figured that was it...that it was over and that was how the most amazing musical experience of my life was going to end...\n\nThen came the best part...\n\nI got in line with my head down completely wrecked and took about 5 to 10 steps, and somehow, felt the need to pick my head up and turn around...and all I saw was Kurt coming down off the platform behind me a few feet away... and a bunch of people trying to surround him... Only, I was right in his direct path, right in front of him, with nowhere really for him to go...\n\nIt was incredible...he came right up to me and I gave him a big hug and told him that was amazing...  I remember girls trying to take his sweater off of him and asking him for it.  There was so much commotion going on that I knew this was my one and only true moment and that I had to seize it right then and there...I asked him to please sign my ticket stub... and without hesitation, he flipped it over and wrote K U R T or he may have even wrote K I R T (haha) in like big simple handwriting...it was SICK!!!!!  I was in shock and didn't know what to say...so of all things, while he was signing it, I asked him \"how the baby was\"...lol...unreal to think back on that now...he said \"She's good. Thanks.\" We smiled, he handed me back the ticket and we went on our separate paths...\n\nI walked outside the studio with the best feeling ever...that absolute true fulfillment was finally reached.  It was an epic moment in time that could never be replaced.  My father met up with me and we left and talked the whole ride home...there were no words to describe that level of energy and excitement at that point.  It really was a storybook ending for me of the most incredible musical experience of my life.  \n\nWe definitely all miss you Kurt and thank you and Nirvana for one of the most amazing contributions to music...and definitely an inspiration to me...\n\nI was there.  I still have the letter from the Fan Club.  I still have the signed ticket stub...\n\nHope you enjoyed my memories of recalling this as much as I have...\n\nPeace and love always...\n\nTones", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332400985", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Writing in dorian is really as straightforward as writing in minor.  Just make all your 6's one half step higher!  In D minor, the 6th is Bb, so use B natural instead.  So the notes are:\n\nD E F G A B C D\n\nMake your chords using those notes.  You can always \"borrow\", meaning that you can use chords that use other notes as well *sometimes*, but most of your chords should have these notes.  The chords you get to use are:\n\nDm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, C (i, ii, bIII, IV, v, vi0, bVII)\n\nNote that the vi0 chord is diminished, so you have to be careful using it.  Just to compare, the chords you get to use in *normal* minor are:\n\nDm, Edim, F, Gm, A (Am), Bb, C (i, ii0, bIII, iv, V (v), bVI, bVII)\n\nNotice that I listed both the A and the Am.  In minor, it's customary to raise the leading tone in a V chord, in this case, raise the C to a C#, when it's going to the tonic.  It's also customary to raise the 6th and 7th degrees when going up a scale and lower them back when you go down.  Minor's weird.  Dorian has none of these issues, so it's simpler, but I wanted to show you both for comparison.\n\nThe upshot of this is that chord progressions don't translate from major to dorian so easily, since you basically lose the vi0.  bVII-i is a great cadence to use.  On the other hand, the bIII chord (also in minor) is great.  The most popular song in dorian that I can think of is Simon and Garfunkel's Scarborough Fair (because a lot of English folk music is in dorian and mixolydian).  If you play it in D, the chords are:\n\n    Dm               C           Dm7   F\n    Are you goin' to Scarborough Fair?\n        C    Dm        F G       Dm9\n    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.\n      Dm     F     F   Em  Dm    C     Am\n    Remember me to one who lives there,\n    Dm       C     Am           Dm\n    She once was a true love of mine.\n\nThese may not be the actual chords; I just figured this out in my head without actually listening to it.  That's pretty much all the useful chords in D dorian except the Bdim and the Em (there's one in there but it's just a passing chord).  If you want to learn dorian, you should study this and other pieces written in dorian to get a feel for what chord progressions are good and which are bad, as well as, obviously, experimenting around!  Dorian has a very specific sound -- minor with a raised 6th -- so you should be able to tell when something \"sounds dorian\" or not.\n\nFinally, don't confuse dorian with durian.  One is a very beautiful scale and the other is a very foul-smelling fruit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332446986", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

At least, they did a generation ago.\n\nWhat I've heard (can't remember the source at the moment, but it's apparent in katakana words) is that Japanese is adding phonemic contrast to things like [ si ] vs. [ ʃi ] and [ di ] vs. [ dʒi ], but only in words adopted from foreign languages. Influences like learning English from a young age give the younger generation of Japanese speakers an advantage because they don't lose these phonemic contrasts.\n\nI mean, things like this happen to anybody who learns a language from a young age vs. as an adult, but the interesting part about this is that a whole generation of native Japanese speakers (and probably not nearly fluent English speakers) is producing these sounds that people couldn't even hear or say a generation ago.\n\nI've never been to Japan and I'm not doing research on this, but I'm sure all of this is verifiable if anyone wants to go out and research it.\n\n_______________\n\nFinally, the pain in the ass part about these new sounds in Japanese is that the writing system doesn't really have good ways of handling foreign sounds.

{"body": "&gt; Best practises would really help my work - thanks!\n\nHere are a few ideas you might find useful. They are certainly common practices, but I won’t call them best practices, because there is always some element of subjectivity in what looks good; the human eye beats dogmatic rules any day.\n\n1. If in doubt, don’t. Good quality fonts will have carefully chosen default spacing, and you shouldn’t need to override it very often. That goes double if we’re talking about web pages, because the letter-spacing adjustments in today’s CSS are relatively crude instruments and you have different rendering across browsers and operating systems to worry about.\n\n2. For large text such as major headings and pull quotes, you may wish to tighten the tracking up a touch. Most fonts are designed for use at body sizes and spaced accordingly by default, but this can look too open if it’s mechanically scaled up for large sizes. If you’re using a specialised titling font that was designed for use at those larger sizes, this rule probably won’t apply.\n\n3. For body text, negative tracking is a mistake approximately 100% of the time, particularly on the web, where even slight negative spacing can easily cause adjacent characters to touch at body sizes. If space is at a premium, consider dropping the text size a notch or using a more condensed font instead.\n\n4. For small text such as captions, a slight loosening of the tracking can help for similar but opposite reasons to #2. However, for now this is mainly relevant to print work. There is rarely enough precision available to make such fine adjustments at small text sizes on today’s screens, unless perhaps everyone reads your site on a new iPad or medical-grade screen...\n\n5. ALL CAPS (or small caps) text can benefit from slightly looser tracking. The default spacing for capitals is usually designed to fit with lowercase text, and therefore looks too tight if a run of capitals is set together.\n\n6. E X T R A W I D E spacing for capitals can give a pleasant effect if used very sparingly, but recognise that you are prioritising visual interest and aesthetics over readability if you make this choice. Even then, if the spaces between letters are getting as wide as, or wider than, the letters themselves, you probably won’t like the results.\n\n7. If you’re setting reversed out text on screen — that is, light text against a dark background — then slightly increasing the tracking can improve the results. The reversing effect tends to add a little weight to the characters, so adding a little extra space as well can give a more balanced look. This is one of the few situations where I would routinely consider adjusting the default spacing even on extended runs of text at body sizes, though that doesn’t mean I would always end up doing so.\n\n8. Be aware that using ligatures and adjusting tracking rarely mix well. Usually if the circumstances call for adjusting tracking, they will also call for disabling ligatures.\n\n9. Some fonts simply don’t work if you adjust the spacing. Calligraphic fonts that simulate cursive handwriting are common examples. Some non-Western scripts rely on continuity as well.\n\n10. Did I mention “if in doubt, don’t”?\n\nHope that helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332565040", "subreddit": "web_design", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

This is a normal part of the process.  This is also the point where a lot of beginners will grow tired of the piece and want to move on to something new.  I challenge you to keep playing this piece after you and your teacher feel you've \"mastered it\" to some degree and really explore what you can do with it musically.\n\n* I'm worried about a few parts of your technique.  The pinky on your right hand that's sticking straight out most of the performance is a source of unneeded tension.  You really want to make sure that the non-playing fingers are as relaxed as possible.  Try this exercise: rest your hand comfortably on C D E F G.  Now play a trill between C and D while keeping the rest of your fingers relaxed and resting on the keys.  Then trill between D and E... E and F.... F and G.  You're trying to develop your individual finger control.  Only use the effort required to play the note.\n\n* Your wrists seem to be bobbing up and down a little more than needed, particularly the left one.  Think about lifting your arm up from an invisible string attached to your wrist and dropping into the keys.  Use gravity and controlled drops as much as possible.  This helps keep you relaxed and also helps with phrasing.\n\n* It looks like you're pressing the keys a little hard.  Maybe driving them all the way to the bottom?  This is harder for me to comment on because I'm not sure the condition of your keyboard.  Again, just try to use only the amount of effort needed to produce the tone that you desire.

{"body": "&gt; What happens with BufferedSource?\n\nIf I understand correctly, `BufferedSource` is sort of analogous to `ChunkPipe`, which Paolo defined in `pipes-extra` as basically\n\n    newtype ChunkPipe a b m r = ChunkPipe (Pipe a b m (a,r))\n\n`ChunkedPipe` has a different `Monad` instance, which threads leftovers.  It has no category instance, meaning that basically you have to explicitly decide what to do with leftovers before composing categorically.  I suppose you could provide composition operators that discard leftovers like `conduit` does, but they would not behave as a category.\n\n(I say that in a very tentative way because I don't really understand `BufferedSource` all that well, despite giving it a few tries.  And from reading the documentation again, I get the idea that there are some other limitations of `Source` that `BufferedSource` works around, and that are just automatic for `Pipe`s.  For example, *any* pipe can be reused multiple times.  Or maybe I'm seeing things completely wrong here.)\n\n&gt; Do we need to lose the Monoid instance of Source here?\n\nIf `Source` were defined as `Pipe () b m ()` as they are in Twan's article, then sources would form a monoid inherited from `Pipe`'s `Monad` instance, where `mappend = (&gt;&gt;)`.  That said, you could also have the `Monad` instance on `Pipe` directly, which is strictly more powerful.\n\n&gt; The resource cleanup semantics of conduit are very specially designed. Do we lose any of that with such a change?\n\nGiven that pipes still doesn't have a solid answer to that problem, you probably do lose pretty much all of that, yes.  This is still an idea in the early stages.  But it is starting to look hopeful.\n\n&gt; In other words, talk is cheap.\n\nAt some point, the answer to that has to be that if you don't want to talk to people, you are not required to pay attention.  This is an interesting idea to some of us.  So we're talking about it.  As I said in a different response, it's far premature to abandon one approach in favor of the other... but Twan's point was that the types initially appear to have converged on something that is not too far off from each other, and that's interesting because it gives a context for comparison.

The latter would be written as `a $$ b = runPipe (a &gt;&gt;&gt; b)`.\n\nHere is some evidence, just based on the types.

This might be a bit longer then you were wanting :/\n\nThis'll do it: \n\n    stringZ = \"\".join(sorted(stringX+stringY))\n\nWhat the heck's going on here? \n\nFirst, take the empty string \"\". Then, use its join method. Join takes an list (or any other iterator), and concatenates its members together using the original string as the 'glue'. This is what I mean:\n\n    \"+\".join([\"Hello\",\"world!\",\"with\",\"plus\",\"signs\"])\n\ncreates the string:\n\n    'Hello+world!+with+plus+signs'\n\nYou've already seen that you can iterate through the characters of a string, so does this work?\n\n    \" \".join(\"Double space this sentence.\")    \n\ncreates:\n\n    'D o u b l e   s p a c e   t h i s   s e n t e n c e .'\n\nCool! This is what I mean by iterator: lists and strings (and other objects) have a 'next' method, which will return the next item in the list or the next character in the string. \n\nAlright, so what's `sorted`? \n\n`sorted` is a builtin method (like `print`) which takes an iterator with objects that have comparison methods, and sorts them using those comparison methods. \n\nTry this:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; dir(\"a\")\n    ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__',\n     '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__', '__getslice__', '__gt__', \n     '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__',\n     '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__','__setattr__','__sizeof__',\n     '__str__','__subclasshook__',_formatter_field_name_split',_formatter_parser', 'capitalize', \n     'center', 'count', 'decode', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'index', \n     'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isdigit', 'islower', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper','join', 'ljust', 'lower',\n     'lstrip', 'partition', 'replace', 'rfind', rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split',\n     'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']\n\nThe `dir` method prints out the available attributes of an object. See the `eq`, `lt`, `gt`, and other similar methods? Those methods let python compare objects of this type with other objects of this type. \n\nAnyway, long digression to say that `sorted` returns a sorted iterator (a list or a string) of things that it can compare. `int` and `string` objects already have these comparisons built in, so you can use `sorted` to sort them. This might be important later, if you want to make a new class (like a complex number, or something similar) that can be put into a list and sorted. \n\nThe `stringX+stringY` means exactly that: return a string with the contents of `stringY` added to the end of `stringX` \n\nSo, step by step:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; stringX+stringY\n    'acegikmoqsuwy+bdfhjlnprtvxz'\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(stringX+stringY)\n    ['+', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o',\n     'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; \"\".join(sorted(stringX+stringY))\n    '+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nNotice that `sorted` returned a list. \n\nHope that helped!\n\nAlso, just a tip: if you're looking at a weird bit of code, and you have no idea what's going on (happens to me all the time :D), work from the inside out. So, in this case, start with `stringX+stringY`, then `sorted`, then `join`. \n\nBONUS TIP: If you ever need the alphabet, use this:\n\n    import string\n    alphabet = string.lowercase\n\nThe best thing is to always check the standard lib to see if you're duplicating something that's already written. For example, if I want to Title Case my text, you can write your own method, or you can use the builtin `title` method. \n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; \"my document title by anonymous\".title()\n    'My Document Title By Anonymous'", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332624990", "subreddit": "learnpython", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; There were other points of evidence that indicated Equestria's cosmology isn't like Earth's. Stars moved around in the pilot episode, for example (I used similar speed-of-light constraints to peg their maximum possible distance at about 3AU, assuming the Moon has a similar angular diameter in Equestria's sky as Earth's moon does in ours).\n\nThat brings to mind something else I've been wondering about.\n\nThe book said the stars \"aided\" in Luna's escape, which means they presumably interacted with the moon somehow. And when we saw them move, they looked like they were heading straight towards the moon.\n\nNow, it could be just some Great Conjunction thing, where the four stars all lined up in a row behind the moon, and shot a beam of focused light to break the binding spell... and that would make sense, given that stars would presumably look much bigger and brighter if they were traveling close enough to interact with the moon some other way.\n\nBut I'm wondering if the stars we saw moving were *shooting* stars, IE, meteors or comets or whatever, that got diverted from their course somehow.\n\n&gt; And if you're going to start disregarding on-screen events as not really happening because they violate the laws of physics, a whole lot of other stuff comes crashing down too. Cloudsdale, for example. I don't think Equestria is compatible with real-world physics. :)\n\nI'm not saying they didn't happen because they're impossible (it is magic, after all).

{"body": "Actually, `pipes` itself has an incorrect `MonadTrans` instance!  I just had a great discussion with Paolo about it only two days ago.  Even more interesting, the `free` package by Edward has a wrong `MonadTrans` instance (the same wrong instance pipes has).\n\nI already know how to fix it, and it basically involves making the monad obligatory with each step, i.e.:\n\n    Pipe a b m r = Pipe { m (Either r (PipeF a b (Pipe a b m r))) }\n\n    PipeF a b r = Await (a -&gt; r) | Yield (b, r)\n\nSo the solution I discussed with Edward for the `free` package is to define a \"Free monad transformer\".  For more on this, check out:\n\nhttps://github.com/ekmett/free/issues/3\n\nBased on that proposed solution, pipes simply becomes:\n\n    type Pipe a b m r = FreeT (PipeF a b) m r\n\nAnd that has the correct MonadTrans instance.  I also know how to translate the other pipes code, like the category instance, to that type and there is a good chance that this fixed MonadTrans instance will be included in the next release.\n\nHowever, in the discussion I had with Paolo, he argued that for efficiency's sake, you could still keep it as Pipe's current type (in order to reduce the number of binds in cases where calls to the monad are sparse) and define a denotational semantics for pipes where you view equality modulo the result you would get from applying `runPipe`.  I'm still not sure about that approach mainly because then you can't safely expose the constructors without warning users of the constructors about the fact that the monad transformer laws are not true in the traditional sense.  Also, for any new pipe catamorphism you add to the library, you'd have to check that the invariant was not broken.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332809311", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "He says the following (forgive the formatting, it's his, not mine.):\n\n\"*Even if all of these components were present, it still would not guarantee life. All of these parts would have to come together in just the right way, in just the right proportions, at just the right time, in just the right climate [not too hot, not too cold, and not too many ultraviolet rays from the sun]. And, of course, without food the cell would die.—“Oops. Go back to square one. Better luck next time.”\nWith all of these obstacles, there is yet another major problem atheistic evolutionists face, and that is the Law Of Entropy. This scientific law states that all objects, if left to themselves, tend to move from a state of order to a state of disorder and decay [e.g., dead bodies decompose, cars rust, mountains wear down, clocks run down, stars burn out, the m o n k e y s’ t y p e w r i t e r s w e a r o u t , a n d o f c o u r s e c o m p l e x m o l e c u l e s s u c h a s R N A o r D N A b r e a k d o w n ] . F o r a t h e i s t i c e v o - lution to work, not only would our first cell have to overcome odds approaching infinity, but it would also have to reverse the Law Of Entropy.*\"\n\nThere are two things wrong with this argument, let's tackle the obvious one first. One, it's not called the Law Of Entropy, it's called the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and it refers to energy, not all things. Things can become ordered if they are better ordered. That's why hydrogen bonds occur in water molecules. Two, he fails probability again. Given an infinite number of chances, with favoritism towards favorable outcomes, anything can happen, and anything can be a possibility. Most abiogenesis theories show evidence that life came about multiple times - that the organisms only strived when it was good for them to strive. It only happened the way it did because it was the best way for things to work, given the environment and circumstances.\n\nHe then states his basic premise - I simply don’t have enough faith to be an atheist. This is where he completely stops having an open mind. I'm totally open to Christianity, it just needs to be met with the same scrutiny as he's putting towards atheism, and he's just not giving it that chance. (And that isn't an argument against agnostic atheism - the belief that we don't know, therefore we are assuming the God hypothesis is false.)\n\n\"*“When you look at Cindy Crawford, the supermodel, or an Arabian stallion, a rose, a New England Fall, or a butterfly, do they look like something the universe belched out by accident, or does it look like there’s design?” He said, “Design.”—I said, “Then there must be a Designer, and that is God.” He said, “##**#, you got me!”*\" Oh no, I'm totally gotten. My argument is completely invalid. No, it's not. A painting has a *desired final product*. The universe doesn't have such standards. The universe does what it can given the things it starts with - given the physical and chemical and biological restraints that it has. For example, the world will not spontaneously combust without warning because it's destined to occur - because that violates basic principles. We are simply the end product of billions and trillions of years of amazing interactions. And the fantasy within that is due to colliding planets, supernova stars and evolutionarily-clashing dinosaurs, struggling to survive.\n\nHe then states that the proof of God is that God encapsulates everything, therefore God can exist. That's not proof, that's a hypothetical definition. Then, to further the proof he claims that understanding God is impossible, because it's beyond our nature of understanding. That's exactly my argument with some of the things that occur within our universe, and it still doesn't prove God, it's still stating the hypothesis. Finally, he says \"We exist, therefore God.\" Right after, he states that he believes in logic. Where's the logic? That's not a logical statement, it's an assumption.\n\nI agree with his premise that if God makes you happy, then you should believe. I wouldn't call that faith under his logic, I'd call that willful ignorance. To stop asking the questions and putting God as the bookmark is ignorant - and I don't mind people doing that (to an extent). It may be good for an answer for you, but it isn't for me. I see no logical reason to believe. And maybe that's the thing, maybe God exists above logic. Maybe God is illogical. But under the same pretenses, maybe God is insane and irrational. But that's assuming God exists... which gets me to my next point.\n\nAfter Page 9, he simply assumes that God exists. I'm glad he's aware that this assumption exists, because it's still something that he hasn't proven. He doesn't prove the next paragraph either, because the universe coming from nothing is not a scientific law, nor is intelligence coming from non-intelligence. These aren't laws, and they certainly aren't impossibilities. After reading this, I am completely aware that everything he states after this point are hypotheticals and hypotheses about the nature of God. They don't prove whether or not he does or does not exist, and that's very sad, because his argument for the existence of God is less than three short paragraphs in a document that's 24 pages long.\n\n(To be continued...)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332914748", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It is somewhat incorrect to say that you're working in a certain \"scale\". What you're referring to is typically referred to as a \"key\". Within any given key, there are multiple scales you can use that will sound good. More importantly, within any given key there are multiple chords that you can use, and if you're good enough with building chord progressions, you can use almost any chord in existence as long as you justify it harmonically within your chosen key. For more info on chord progressions you can check out my tutorial in the sidebar (10 tips for chord progressions...)\n\nAs far as choosing a key to work in, typically I work in keys that I'm most comfortable in, i.e. keys with not too many sharps or flats. For major keys, I like C, F, G, and Bb. For minor keys, I like Cm, Fm, Gm, Dm, and Am.\n\nChanging key halfway through a song can certainly make it more interesting, but for most edm purposes it's not necessary. Also if you expect your track to be played out by a dj and mixed with other tracks, a key change might complicate things.\n\nEDIT: thought I should clarify the difference between scales and keys.\n\nSay you're working in the key of C major. The Cmaj scale is an obvious place to start. However, what if you're going for a more bluesy sound? In that case the chord you're likely to be using is C7 (C E G Bb). If you use the Cmaj scale over it, the natural B will clash with the Bb in the chord, so the scale you should be using is the C mixolydian (C D E F G A Bb) which is essentially the F major scale starting on C. If you're using the regular C major chord (C E G), you can also use the C lydian scale (C D E F# G A B) instead of Cmaj. The sharp 4 helps to prevent a clash between the 3rd (the most important note of any chord) and the 4th. But it's really all about the sound you like. Moreover, the scale you choose for your melodies should go with the chord you're sitting on rather than the key you're in. If you're in C major, you're likely to have a G major chord at some point in your progression. The melody over the G major should accommodate the G major chord rather than C major (although luckily those scales have most of their notes in common)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332951540", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah, Though I only dated mine for about a week after realizing she was actually crazy. Remember that thing \"Don't stick your dick in crazy\", I chose to ignore that. Don't do it, it's not worth it.\n\nIt's a long story so I'll just tell a shortened version. This started when I was in Uni, my first year I met this Latino girl, really hot, but we didn't have much in common so we were only just friends. She had this little sister (not related) who was asian, first time I met her I knew she was a bit weird, but took no notice of it because she was nice. She started talking to me a lot more and looking for me at all times. It was awkward, but like I said, she was always nice so I didn't care so much. Then things started freaking me out, she started making little bands, like friendship bands except with out names in them or saying things like I love you. So I did the normal thing and tried to distance my self. Though it didn't help, and I think now that I look back that it might have made her even more attracted to me as the strange gifts kept getting progressively bigger and bigger. She started writing me poems, and drawing pictures of us together as a family (in the future). Now remember this was a girl not 12, but 21... Anyway, soon my friends and her sister got wind of it, my friends just laughed at me and teased me, constantly inciting those childing songs \"(my name) and (her name) sitting in a tree, K I S S I N G!\" trying to get me to go out with her. And her sister did nothing but apologize. Anyway, skip forward a month and I finally agree to going out with her, but tell her no more poems and bracelets and shit, she agrees and we go on this awkward to where she doesn't talk once yet has a smile that never vanishes the whole time. To this day I swear she was planning on murdering me, stuffing me and keeping me forever. Skip forward another week and she is already talking to me about having kids. One day later, she disapears. I didn't see her for a whole month, though not once did I forget, thinking that at any moment she would inject me with some sort of knock out toxin, and keep me in her basement. Again, skip forward a month to where she re-appears, drags me to her place, and we do it, the whole time she is crying. I really wanted to leave. At the end she tells me she is moving and when I finally left, I never see her again. Creepiest moment in my whole life.\n\ntl;dr: sorry it's so long it was meant to be short, asian girl stalks me, gives me creepy gifts, disapears, i'm scared of her, rapes me, disapears and haven;t seen her since.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332989297", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Usually the ones protesting Planned Parenthood are also handing out religious pamphlets.\" Also not understanding the full intent of the post while talking down to me like I am a child just makes you look like a condescending prick. If I were making a sweeping assumption I would have had to have said something like \"wow all atheists must be against pro-life choices\". I simply posted this for the atheists that are pro-choice. Let me ask you a few questions. Does EVERY atheist on here have to agree with everything posted to make it a valid post? Are you the judge and jury for why things are posted? I found this ad to be interesting in that most atheists ( NOT ALL) tend to sway towards a more liberal stance. I post things for an intelligent debate, not for the intent of pigeon-holing anyone. I am an atheist who sways in the liberal direction. I found it interesting that a pro-life ad was on a fellow atheists blog. I never said it was wrong or that ALL atheists were pro-choice... just that it is interesting. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333149063", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}
