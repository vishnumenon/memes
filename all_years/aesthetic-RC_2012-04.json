{"body": "This shouldn't even work at all; grep is line-oriented, which means it checks the RE against each individual line in succession, not against the whole file. I can't reproduce the behavior you're seeing:\n\n    $ echo -e 'var w = 1;\\nvar x = 2;\\nvar y = 3;\\nvar z = 4;' | grep -P 'var .+\\nvar .+' || echo \"not found\"\n    not found\n\n    $ grep -V | head -n1\n    grep (GNU grep) 2.9\n\nSo whatever you're seeing, it must be by sheer accident, which explains why the line numbers are wrong.  Moreover, even if somehow grep was modified to be whole-file oriented instead of line-oriented, it still wouldn't support overlapping matches, which is the behavior that you seem to expect.  There's no RE engine in existence, as far as I know, that supports overlapping matches; once `var x = 2;` has been consumed as part of the first match, it cannot also be part of any future matches.  This only matches 3 times, not 5:\n\n    $ echo 'a b c d e f' | perl -nE 'say $&amp; while /\\w \\w/g'\n    a b\n    c d\n    e f\n\nIf you want something that supports whole-file matching, you can use perl with the `-0777` argument which means set the line delimiter to nothing (octal 777 is not a valid character), so the whole file will be slurped.  However, you'll lose the ability to refer to the current line with `$.`, because perl thinks there is only one long line.  You can use a zero-width look-ahead assertion to overcome the overlapping match problem, but as the name implies it is a zero-width assertion which means the text it matches is not consumed, and therefore isn't part of what's printed.  But this fact is exactly why it works.\n\n    $ echo -e 'var w = 1;\\nvar x = 2;\\nvar y = 3;\\nvar z = 4;' |\n       perl -0777 -nE 'say $&amp; while /var .+(?=\\nvar .+)/g'\n    var w = 1;\n    var x = 2;\n    var y = 3;\n\nThe character position of each match is available with `pos()` so in theory if you built up a mapping of the character offset where each line begins you could work out the line numbers, but I think that would be too much for a one-liner and would require an actual script.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333282228", "subreddit": "commandline", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In the standard Richter tuning of Diatonic harmonicas (the one he is playing) you only get 6 notes out of the 8 in the major scale. For instance, a C harmonica would allow you to normally play G B C D E G G B on the first octave.  Which means in order to get all the other notes inbetween you have to bend the note down. For instance, if you tilt the harmonica and increase the area inside your mouth and tilt your tongue the right way you can take a B and bend it down to an A and a Bb. Bending this way requires a pitch to know when to stop, and it requires a bit of practice to know how to adjust your mouth to get the appropriate tone. The fact is he can get the correct note almost flawlessly by bending is astounding.  Keep in mind that the 3 hole on a harmonica can be bent to play G Gb F E Eb and the blow can be bent up E F Gb. So out of one hole in the harmonica you can get 8 different notes. Each require breathing a certain amount of pressure with a certain area in your mouth with a certain tilt of the harmonica and a certain tongue placement. \n\nThe technique to bend a note is the same reason you hear blues harmonicas gradually change notes instead of being so static (like sliding on a guitar, instead of just putting another finger down and fretting it).  Effectively bending is just the mouth/harmonica form of sliding. \n\nWhat Buddy Greene in the video is doing is taking a C harmonica and using the right bends to take the notes to specific semi tones in order for his C harmonica to also be played in G F and D.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333299824", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 197, "controversiality": 0}

I can't remember the stats off the top of my head, but we have a far better win record when Carroll starts and IIRC all of Suárez's goals this year have come when Carroll has been on the pitch.\n\nThe question really shouldn't be why he gets so much playing time, he doesn't. The question should be why does he constantly get benched and dropped even when it looks like he could put together a good run of games. Carroll is a young, developing talent but he never gets a run of more than 1 or 2 games before he is dropped, no matter how well he plays.\n\nEDIT: All right, found the stats. Our record in our last 6 games in which Carroll didn't start: D L L L L L. Our last 6 in which he did start: D W D W W L. And the last time Suárez got a goal or an assist while Carroll wasn't playing was 10th December.\n\nFor whatever reason, the team plays better with Carroll in the side, and yet he is constantly dropped, often after a good performance. Remember his good performance and goal at Everton away earlier in the season? Dropped the next game. His great run of form in January when Suárez was suspended? Dropped as soon as Suárez was ready to start. Put in another good shift in the derby at Anfield. Dropped for the next two league games.

{"body": "Sorry if this explanation is really convoluted or if I spend time on things you already know. I'm just starting from the bottom up, and also having a little trouble putting it into words. Now that I'm looking back on it, it's kind of rambly. Sorry about that.\n\nThe modes all have very different sounds from each other, despite sharing the same notes. Let's look at the some of the modes relative (meaning they share the same notes) to C major, also called C Ionian, as an example:\n\nC Ionian: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C\n\nA Aeolian (also called A minor): A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A\n\nYou'll notice that C major and A minor comprise all the same notes. If you know the difference between major and minor, then you know that, despite sharing those notes, the two scales will sound very different from each other; C major sounds happy and A minor sounds sad, basically.\n\nThe reason for this is that when you change the order of the notes, e.g. starting the scale on A, the sixth degree, instead of on C, you end up with different intervals in the scale. Intervals are the distances between two notes. The minor scale differs from the major scale on three notes, also called degrees: the third degree, the sixth degree, and the seventh degree.\n\nLet's look at those degrees. You'll notice that, in C major, the difference between the root, C, and the third degree, E, is four semitones (each fret on a guitar is one semitone, so this interval is four frets). Count it out--you start at C, then go to C# (up 1), D (2), D# (3), then land on E (4). This four-semitone interval is known as the major third; the \"major\" part refers to its appearance in major scale, and the \"third\" part because it goes from the root to the third degree.\n\nThe third degree of a scale is very important because it's part of the root chord's triad, which will determine the scale's tonality (I think that's the right word, but I've also heard it called quality), i.e. whether it's major or minor. If the root chord has a major third and a perfect fifth and is therefore a major chord, then the scale is major. If the root chord has a minor third and a perfect fifth, then the scale is minor. There are other types, but they're not important right now.\n\nNow we'll go to A minor, which, as stated above, shares the same notes as C major. In A minor, the difference between the root and the third is only *three* semitones--from A you go to A# (1), then B (2), then C (3). There is no sharp note between B and C. This three-note interval is called the minor third because, like I said above, it makes the root chord minor, which, in turn, makes the scale minor.\n\nThis pattern of flattening the degree occurs again at the sixth and seventh degrees. So, in terms of intervals, here are the constructions of major and minor scales:\n\nMajor: Root, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, root.\n\nMinor: Root, 2, 3b, 4, 5, 6b, 7b, root.\n\nSo basically, C major (C D E F G A B C) has the major scale construction shown above. However, when you play the same notes but start on A, you end up with the minor scale pattern, which has a very different sound from the major scale. So when you said\n\n&gt;a \"mode\" means nothing - I'm just playing the same notes as the Ionian\n\nyou seemed to be under the impression that it would sound the same, which is incorrect. They sound completely different. You can also do the same thing starting on every degree of the scale, not just the sixth. Here's a list:\n\n1st degree: Ionian. Basic major scale.\n\n2nd degree: Dorian. Has a flat third and seventh. A minor scale, but not as dark as the Aeolian, or natural minor.\n\n3rd degree: Phrygian. Another minor scale. Has a flat 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, so it's very similar to the Aeolian, but the 2b gives it a slightly darker sound. It's my favorite mode.\n\n4th degree: Lydian. Major scale. Has a sharp 4th. It's nearly the same as the Ionian, but the 4# gives it a little more color. I like this one a lot.\n\n5th degree: Mixolydian. Major scale. Has a flat 7th. Not the most distinctive-sounding scale, but it sounds pretty good. I think it's fairly popular in jazz? I mainly play metal, so I don't run into it a lot.\n\n6th degree: Aeolian. Basic minor scale. Has a flat 3rd, 6th, and 7th, like I said above.\n\n7th degree: Locrian. Has a flat 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th. Since it has a 3b *and* a 5b, the Locrian mode's root chord is a diminished chord. That kind of chord doesn't really resolve that well, so the Locrian mode isn't used very often at all.\n\nThis is a lot of information and probably pretty confusing. I don't know how well I explained that, so feel free to ask any questions. To summarize, modes share the same notes, but when you play those notes in a different order, they take on a different sound and character, which is why we look at them as separate and distinct scales instead of just permutations of one scale.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333477880", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

If the bass guitarist drones the D note and you play that same C major scale, it'll sound like D dorian. If he drones the E note it'll sound like E frygian, et cetera.

{"body": "I'm studying modes right now in my uni music theory class, so I'll start from the beginning and explain it simply, in a way most people don't teach it anymore. It's longer because I go step by step but it should click better.  \n\nThere are actually two ways to think about modes, and most people only tell you one of them. i'll try to explain the second, because I find it a lot more practical. It might be faster to explain it like petelyons did, but he's not really showing you anything you haven't seen before. It might be a good idea to have a guitar or piano on you while you read this.\n\nI assume you already know that between E and F, as well as B and C, there's only a half step (one fret), as opposed to the full step (two frets) between all the other notes.\n\nSo take the C major scale:\n\nC D E F G A B C  \n\nIf you write out the pattern of half steps and whole steps between each note, you'd get:\n\n**W W H W W W H **\n\nA mode just refers to the pattern of whole and half steps that make up a scale. The Major scale is also known as the Ionian mode, but no one really calls it that. Similarly, the minor scale is called the Aeolian mode.  \n\nThis is the pattern of whole and half steps to make a minor scale:    \n\n**W H W W H W W** \n\nSo in the key of C, a C minor scale would be:  \n\nC D Eb F G Ab Bb C  \n\nNow let's compare it to the C major scale (brackets are for emphasis only).  \nC D [E] F G [A] [B] C  \nC D [Eb] F G [Ab] [Bb] C  \n  \n\nThe difference between a major and a minor scale is that in a minor scale, the *third*, *sixth*, and *seventh* scale degrees are flatted (in this case, E, A, and B). To change any major scale into its **parallel minor**, you just have to flat the third, the sixth, and the seventh scale degrees.\n\n  \nNow, you might be thinking, \"okay, but what does this have to do with modes? I know all this! You're not making sense, Porygon!\"  \n\nIf you have major and minor down, you already know the two hardest modes. Now there's only four easy ones to go.  \n\nLydian and Mixolydian are both very similar to the major scale. Here are their scale patterns:\n\nLydian:      W W W H W W H\nMixolydian: W W H W W H W  \n  \nIn the key of C, their notes would be:  \n  \nLydian:      C D E [F#] G A B C  \nMixolydian: C D E F G A [Bb] C  \nmajor:       C D E F G A B C  \n\nNow you can see the similarities between these two modes and the major scale. Lydian is just the major scale with a *raised fourth* scale degree, while Mixolydian is the major scale with a *flattened seventh*. If you know the major scale on the fretboard, then you already know the Lydian and Mixolydian modes. You just have to raise the fourth scale degree up one fret to get Lydian, and lower the seventh a fret to get Mixolydian.  \n  \nLikewise, Dorian and Phrygian are very similar to the minor scale. their scale patterns: \n\nDorian:   W H W W W H W  \nPhrygian: H W W W H W W  \n\nIn the key of C, their notes would be:  \n\nDorian:      C D Eb F G [A] Bb C  \nPhrygian:   C [Db] Eb F G Ab Bb C  \nminor:       C D Eb F G Ab Bb C  \n  \nSo the only difference between the Dorian mode and the minor scale is that Dorian has a *raised sixth* scale degree. And the only difference between the Phrygian mode and the minor scale is that phrygian has a *flatted second* scale degree. If you know the minor scale on the fretboard, then it won't take long to get used to the Dorian and Phrygian modes because they're only one note off.  \n\n~~~  \nHere's the most important bits so far, condensed:  \n\nMajor scale = I II III IV V VI VII I = WWHWWWH  \nMinor scale = I II iii IV V vi vii I = WHWWHWW  \n  \nLydian = major scale with a raised IV = I II III IV# V VI VII I  \nMixolydian = major scale with a flatted VII = I II III IV V VI vii I  \n  \nDorian = minor scale with a raised VI = I II iii IV V VI vii I  \nPhrygian = minor scale with a flattened II = I ii iii IV V vi vii I   \n~~~  \n\nNow I'll connect this method to what everyone else is also saying. You already know this, but suppose we start the minor scale on A instead, using the pattern WHWWHWW, and continued it for a while:  \n\n**A**w**B**h**C**w**D**w**E**h**F**w**G**w**A**w**B**h**C**w**D**w**E**h**F**w**G**w**A**  \n\nIf we go from A to A, we get the pattern the minor scale pattern, WHWWHWW \nIf we go from C to C, though, we get the major scale pattern, WWHWWWH    \nIf we go from D to D, we get the Dorian pattern, WHWWWHW  \nIf we go from E to E, we get the Phrygian pattern, HWWWHWW  \nIf we go from F to F, we get the Lydian pattern, WWWHWWH  \nIf we go from G to G, we get the Mixolydian pattern, WWHWWHW  \n  \nThis means that A minor, C major, D Dorian, E phrygian, F lydian, and G mixolydian all contain the same notes. Now this is useful as a reference because it's easy to understand, but it can't really help you all that much.  \n\nIf you wanted to play in D Dorian, for example, your mind will likely associate it with C major shapes and your solo will sound like C major rather than D Dorian. This second method also kind of fails if you're trying to play in any other key than C major. If I asked you to tell me the notes in C Mixolydian, you could either:\n\na. transpose every note from G Mixolydian up a fourth to C, which takes forever, or  \n\nb. know that the Mixolydian mode is just a major scale with a flattened VII so C Mixolydian would be C D E F G A Bb C.  \n\nI feel like b. is much more practical in terms of actually creating music. But of course, it's good to know both.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333497427", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

You can't just pick a scale to play the melody in, it has to match the scale of the chords and bassline in the song. If the song was in the key of E (I'm assuming he meant major?) then the notes would be E F# G# A B C# D#, which is entirely different from E Phrygian, which is not even a scale in the first place. It's a mode of the C major scale, but instead of starting on C it starts on E. so the notes would be E F G A B C D...which would sound terrible in a chord progression that's in the key of E major. \n\nGiving the benefit of the doubt, I could assume that the song was actually in E minor (E F# G A B C D), in which case E Phrygian would be *almost* the same notes (E **F** G A B C D).

{"body": "If your what the future of Runescape is then it will be a game that i no longer take a part of. I understand that business must change in order to turn a profit and continue surviving. I understand that Jagex uses the outdated method of P2P and that in order to survive in the new growing business they will most likely have to change their marketing strategy. But you are completely missing the point of why everyone is mad.\n\nEveryone is mad because this goes completely against the integrity of the game itself. Runescape was made as a game for people to play for fun while having a competitive stand point if players wanted to compete against one another XP wise. They even stated in their rules (before they just recently changed them to make the SoF update work in their favor) that:\n           \"We don’t want players to be able to buy their way to success in Runescape. If we let players start doing this, it devalues Runescape for others. We feel your status in real-life shouldn’t affect your ability to be successful in Runescape. \"\n\nThey understood how the players felt. They knew that because we took the time ourselves to gain the XP that we have that we felt a sense of pride and accomplishment for that. When the ability for people to come in and buy the exp that we worked so hard for comes into play we will be outraged (which if you couldn't tell by the massive amounts of people protesting, signing petitions, and ranting on the forums i think its safe to assume the majority are). It does devalue the game in the sense that S U O M I has worked harder than anyone to gain the levels and exp he has and now if someone wanted to (and had the money too) they could create a new account and beat him to 200m exp in all skills. How is that far to any of us? \n\nThe ability to purchase exp (and potentially high valued in-game items) completely eliminates the competitive spirit of the game and that is why most Runescape players play. If Jagex continues down this road (selling XP and high level in-game items) then the community will shift from a competitive social one to one filled with people who pay their way to the top and have little respect for the game. I have been playing for 7 years now and with the introduction of \"buy more spins\" i am personally appalled. They have completely disrespected me and every other player that has earned their levels and their XP. All of the time we have put into the game that we have loved is worth nothing now. Yes its technically worth nothing in the first place considering its pixels and has no real monetary value. However, it's personally worth a lot to me and im sure everyone else. And to know that it means nothing to the people who brought us this game is a disguest. \n\nTHAT is why everyone is upset \nTHAT is why everyone is in an uproar\nTHAT is why so many people have left. \n\nNot because of selling out, not because of making the game to easy, but because Jagex has personally disrespected every single one of it's true players.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333668375", "subreddit": "runescape", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, what I was computing in the second part was essentially a permutation of 5 musics. 2 of them happened to be a music of your band and 3 not, but I was permutating them. You know the number of permutations for 5 elements is 5!, then I essentially computed 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120\n\nObviously we aren't talking about 5 musics; but about 55. And, obviously, we won't choose from 55 musics; our first choice for \"musics not in your band\" (the K) will be picking from 1117-20=1097 musics, the second from 1096 musics, and so on.\n\nLet me try another approach. From the first 55 musics, we have to choose 5 from your band, and 50 that might or might not be on your band. Let's first choose the 50 that isn't on your band, then \"insert\" the 5 remaining at any place.\n\nThe 50 is easy. It is 1097 x 1096 x ... x 1047 = 1097! / 1046!\n\nTo insert musics from your band, we shall consider to be in a situation similar to the one we had before: we have 50 \"K\"s, like\n\nK K K K K K K K ... K\n\nAnd we want to insert 20 Ms.\n\nNow a better way to systematize it (otherwise we would have to consider each case individually like I did above..) is to consider that the first M you insert will be at any of 51 positions: it can be before than each element (and this is 50 positions) or after the last.\n\nThe second M can be at 51 positions, the third at 52 positions, etc.\n\nthe number of ways the Ms can be inserted is 51 x 52 x 53 x 54 x 55 = 55! / 50!, this is a mere 417451320\n\nThe first M can be any of 20 musics. The second can be any of 19, etc. So the number of possible ways those Ms can be filled are 20 x 19 x 18 x 17 x 16 = 20! / 15!. This is a really small number, 1860480\n\nNow, I am not trusting my math skills, but if we for some reason believe I'm solving this correctly, we can get E by multiplying those numbers together. So\n\nE = (20!/15!) x (55! / 50!) x (1097! / 1046!)\n\nAnd now I'm very distrustful. I didn't expect this probability to be THAT low!\n\nI couldn't even get bc to calculate this directly (basically it gives Fatal error: Out of memory for malloc), so I'm writing out an expression for it:\n\nP = E / S = (20!/15!) x (55! / 50!) x (1097! / 1046!) / 1117! = (20! x 50! x 1097!) / (1117! x 1046!)\n\nHmm..

If I play Ab7#11 to G7, it's the same exact notes as D7alt to G7, except with a different root.

{"body": "Draw the circle of fifths *and* the key signatures for each key, and have that as a visual reference that you try to visualize whenever you're trying to figure out what key some key signature belongs to.  If you're a visual learner, this way should work great.  It also helps to understand that when you go up a fifth, you sharp the new key's 7th, and when you go down a fifth, you flat the new key's 4th.\n\nAlso, play lots of music in different keys.  If you're a pianist, the Bach Inventions are good; they're pretty easy, and they're labeled by key.  This only has some of the keys, but you can just calculate the others.\n\nThere are some tricks, too.  You obviously know the keys of C minor and C major, right?  (If not, disregard everything and just go learn how to play an instrument first!)  C minor is Bb Eb Ab.  3 flats.  So when you go from major to minor, you add 3 flats.  If you know that D minor is one flat, then to get to D major, you add three sharps and have two sharps.  (Flats and sharps are negatives of each other, naturally.)\n\nWhat about C# major?  To get to C# from C, you just sharp everything, right?  7 notes in the scale, so 7 sharps.  Cb is 7 flats, same way.  So you know A is 3 sharps; what's Ab?  3 sharps + 7 flats = 4 flats.  What's A#?  3 sharps + 7 sharps = 10 sharps.  (Obviously nobody would ever write in A#, with 10 sharps, when they can just write in Bb.  How would you do 10 sharps?  Fx Cx Gx D# A# E# B#.)  Also, you know that Ab minor and G# minor are the same key, but one's in sharps and the other flats.  G# minor is the relative minor of B minor, so that has 5 sharps.  What's the key signature for Ab minor?  Enharmonic notes are 12 steps away on the Circle of Fifths, so just add 12 flats.  5 sharps + 12 flats = 7 flats.\n\nOh, yeah, some people actually write in C# major (Bach, for instance) when they could be writing in Db, with 5 flats instead of 7 sharps.  It does make sense to do that when you're coming from another key (like C# minor, 4 sharps) and don't want to respell everything.\n\nFinally, the order of the flats and sharps.  This comes from knowing the Circle of Fifths.  They just follow the pattern of white notes.  Sharps go from F to B (F C G D A E B) and flats go the other way, from B to F (B E A D G C F).  If you're confused, just remember that G major is F# and F major is Bb, and for flats, just go up in fourths, and for sharps, just go up in fifths.\n\nOK!  There we go.  Draw (like, physically) the Circle of Fifths, play more music in different keys, and generally pay attention!

{"body": "The answer by Daniel Wagner on Stack Overflow is correct, but I'll elaborate on it here since this won't fit in a Stack Overflow comment.\n\nFirst off, you should read [Monad Transformers - Step by Step](www.grabmueller.de/martin/www/pub/Transformers.pdf) if you haven't already.\n\nNow, you would expect the type of your combined monad to be (using Haskell notation):\n\n    type Combined r = ListT (Either e) r\n\nIf you don't understand why `ListT` is on the outside, then go over the Monad Transformers paper I linked above before proceeding.  Remember that if I were to `runListT` a value of type `Combined r`, I would get something like:\n\n    -- Actually, this is WRONG, but see below for the warning about ListT\n    runListT (x :: ListT (Either e) r) :: Either e [r]\n\nBased on the type of `Combined r`, we can infer that the correct type of `(&gt;&gt;=)` in the `Combined` monad would be:\n\n    (&gt;&gt;=) :: ListT (Either e) a -&gt; (a -&gt; ListT (Either e) b) -&gt; ListT (Either e) b\n\nSo now I will pretend that I'm the `GHC` compiler endowed with the ability to compile Python code and try to go through your `bind function and infer everything's type.  I would infer from the above type for `(&gt;&gt;=)`, that the type of the arguments would be:\n\n    mval :: ListT (Either e) a\n    mf :: a -&gt; ListT (Either e b)\n\nThen I look at `seq_bind`, which I infer must have the type:\n\n    seq_bind :: ListT (Either e) a -&gt; (a -&gt; ListT (Either e) b) -&gt; c\n\n... where `c` has yet to be determined.  Already your code doesn't type-check (assuming Python had such a thing as types), since the type of seq_bind is supposed to be:\n\n   seq_bind :: [a] -&gt; (a -&gt; [b]) -&gt; [b]\n\nYou can't use a `ListT` where a function expects a list, so that's your first problem.  In fact, you can't derive `ListT`'s bind from the `List` bind, at all.  This is true for (almost) all monad transformers.\n\nHowever, you **can** derive the `ListT (Either e)` bind from the bind for `Either e`, and more generally, you can derive the bind for `(Monad m) =&gt; ListT m` without knowing anything about what base monad you are wrapping other than it having a `(&gt;&gt;=)` and `return` operation that obey the monad laws.\n\nHowever, it's **not** trivial to write a correct `ListT` implementation and many brave souls have gotten it wrong.  In fact the `ListT` that comes with Haskell's standard monad transformer packages is **wrong** and is neither a monad nor a monad transformer.  The correct implementation, which I strongly endorse, is the one given here:\n\n[ListT done right](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/ListT_done_right)\n\nYou should crib from that code (which is a bit ugly, but 100% correct) to write a proper `ListT` monad transformer.  Do not be tempted to write a monad transformer that returns the list all at once: I guarantee you it will not and cannot work.\n\nFor other people reading this thread who program in Haskell, I want to take a moment to advertise that there's actually a library up on Hackage that will soon provide the correct `ListT` implementation for you, namely my own `pipes` library.  You have to wait until v1.1 (coming this month), which basically rewrite the pipe type to fix the `MonadTrans` instance.  The new `Pipe` type is going to be:\n\n    data PipeF a b r = Await (a -&gt; r) | Yield (b, r)\n\n    instance Functor (PipeF a b) where\n        fmap f (Await a) = Await $ fmap f a\n        fmap f (Yield y) = Yield $ fmap f y\n\n    type Pipe a b m r = FreeT (PipeF a b) m r\n\n    data FreeT f m r = FreeT { runFreeT :: m (Either r (f (FreeT f m r))) }\n\n    instance (Functor f, Monad m) =&gt; Monad (FreeT f m) where\n        return = FreeT . return . Left\n        m &gt;&gt;= f = FreeT $ runFreeT m &gt;&gt;= \\x -&gt; case x of\n            Left  r -&gt; runFreeT $ f r\n            Right a -&gt; return $ Right $ fmap (&gt;&gt;= f) a\n\nBasically, `FreeT` is a \"free monad transformer\" and I'm already arranging with Ross to include it in the `transformers` package (he got the idea for the exact same type at the same time).  Pipe composition has already been updated to work with the above type and pass the category laws, so it's official for v1.1.  At this point I'm only waiting for Ross to include `FreeT` in the `transformers` package.  Then `Producer b m` is basically going to be `ListT m` done right, except more featureful because you can consume the values produced in a structured way using pipe composition.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333853148", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Understand that I'm coming from a jazz background, so all my advice about what's \"acceptable\" and \"not acceptable\" comes from that. Bottom line is that if you like it, write it. Rules are all meant to be broken, if that is the effect you are after. Things to AVOID generally, though would be:\n\n* Any sort of minor 9th (b9) between any two chord tones in a voicing. Your example, an 11th placed a b9 above the major third, would be one. Others would be (starting with the lower note) 9th to minor 3rd, major 13th to flatted 7th, 11th (4th) to flatted 5th, sharp 11th to fifth. The obvious exception is from the root to a flat 9th, which is quite ok.\n* placing an interval of a half-step, and sometimes a whole-step, against the \"lead\" note. (The melody note, or the note on top if it's a harmonic pad)\n* placing too many/too close intervals too low in the tessitura, so that the wash of overtones creates a \"muddy\" sound. There are rules (look up *lower interval limit*), but it varies based on instruments, duration, and dynamics, so it's best to just use your ear.\n* substituting extensions in a way that obscures the function of the chord. More on that shortly.\n\nThe way that I think of extensions is that they are a way to *substitute* for chord tones, usually the root or the 5th, to add \"color\" to a chord. **You can't alter the 3rd or the 7th of a dominant 7th chord, or you lose the function of the chord.** The root can be swapped for a b9, 9, or #9. The fifth can be swapped for a #11, b13 (same as #5), or 13. Using a natural 11 obscures the third, so never voice it in a dominant 7th. This gives you five \"categories\" of dominant chords, with the extensions derived from what I call the \"parent\" scale:\n\n* C7 (pure mixolydian dominant): use 9 and 13. Parent scale C D E F G A Bb C\n* C7 #11 (lydian dominant): use 9 with #11. You can also add 13. Parent scale C D E F# G A Bb C\n* C7 #5 (augmented dominant, whole-tone): use 9 and #5. You can also add #11. Parent scale C D E F# G# Bb C\n* C7 #9 or C7 b9 (diminished dominant): use b9 or #9, and #11, 5, or 13. Parent scale C Db D# E F# G A Bb C (9-note diminished scale)\n* C7alt, can be spelled C7 b9 b13, C7 #9 b13, C7 b9 #11, C7 #9 #11, all of these are \"altered\" dominant. Parent scale C Db D# E F# Ab Bb C (diminished whole-tone, sometimes called super-lociran)\n\nAll of these can be used in a number of different voicings, but good ones for hearing them on piano are (R) 7 9 3 5, or (R) 3 5 7 9.\n\n&gt; Could you explain it in terms of tonics, dominants and pre-dominants?\n\nFor these type of chords in a jazz setting, any one of them can function as a dominant, pre-dominant, in a chain of dominants, as the tonic, or even completely non-functionally. It all depends what kind of \"pull\" you want, and how much dissonance you're after. The thing I worry more about is the *color pallate*, or making sure that the different harmonies work together in terms of tone (bright vs. dark).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333979110", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

The real difference for me between \"modal\" and \"functional\" is that a modal piece would be fairly static, with very slow harmonic rhythm, if any. This doesn't prevent you from using notes outside of D dorian, it just prevents you from using functional progressions as the basis of your harmony.\n\nEDIT: example for clarification. Miles Davis' \"So What\" is a modal tune in D dorian because that's the only chord that occurs on the A sections. There's no movement like there would be in a bebop tune.

{"body": "The circle of fifths is a terrrrrrrible way to learn key signatures unless you play an instrument with a nonsensical note arrangement like most brass and woodwind instruments.  The reason why is that note titles (A, A#, C, etc) are meaningless in terms of key signatures.  Sure, you CAN learn to build key signatures from notes like they teach you in intro music classes, but I didn't understand a fucking thing and couldn't apply it until I learned Jazz interval notation.\n\nJazz interval notation is BY FAR the best way to understand key signatures, especially the difference between slightly different key signatures.  It also makes it much easier to understand why A minor and C major sound incredibly different despite being enharmonic (just one example of enharmonic yet dissimilar-sounding keys, obviously).  This is how it works:\n\nFirst, you start with the Tonic, aka the root note.  That's the only time you're going to use the label of any note.  For instance, in C major, the tonic is C.  In A minor, the tonic is A.  Following the tonic, you have the scale type.  This tells you the INTERVALS IN THE SCALE.  That's all it means.  Different scales use a different pattern of intervals leading from the tonic to the octave.  All scales can generally be expressed as a modification of the Natural Major or Natural Minor scales.\n\nGiven that, the easiest and most useful way to remember every scale for every tonic is to understand the intervals involved.  The first thing is to memorize the intervals for the Natural Major.  These are expressed as \"W\" for a whole tone or \"H\" for a half-tone or semitone.  Presumably, \"Q\" is used for quarter-tones on the rare occasion you might need them, but I've never seen it myself.  \n\nNatural Major: W W H W W W H\n\nYou \"count up\" these tones from the tonic.  So for E major it'd be E F# G# A B C# D# E.  I just puzzled that one out as I wrote it; I don't have the notes of any key signature memorized (except the super obvious ones like Cmaj).  There's really no point because the note labels are designations of frequency, not interval.  The brain works on intervals, not frequencies.  That's why you can transpose songs and they sound mostly the same to listeners if you don't play them back to back.\n\nThe other good one to know is the Natural Minor.  Personally I just remember it as an extension of the Natural Major, having a flat 3rd, 6th and 7th, but that would be notated properly as:\n\nNatural Minor: W H W W H W W\n\nWhether you care to remember both or just figure one from the other as I do, you now have the tools to create ANY scale at ANY tonic without memorizing a single one of them note-for-note.  Watch:\n\nPhrygian Mode: Natural Minor with substituted flat 2nd.\n\nPhrygian Dominant: Natural Minor with substituted flat 2nd and major 3rd.\n\nHarmonic Minor: Natural Minor with substituted major 7th.\n\nMinor Pentatonic: Natural Minor with omitted 2nd and 6th (and yes, this does mean the Natural Minor Pentatonic and Phrygian Pentatonic are enharmonic which is a neat trick you can use when playing improvosationally)\n\nMinor Pentatonic Blues: Natural Minor with omitted 2nd and 6th with an additional augmented 4th/diminished 5th known as the \"blue note\"\n\nAnd so on and so forth.  Same holds true for chords.  It makes it much easier to understand how chords and scales relate once you learn this style of notation, and also makes it easier to see why jazz uses such bizarre chords that don't sound so great if you try to play them in a vacuum (figuratively, of course).\n\nReally I wish someone would have told me about this stuff when I started playing long ago, so enjoy the info.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333990685", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Examples:\n\nDb Eb F Ab\nC Eb F G\nB D# E# F#\nBb Eb F (F)\n\nAll of these are chords with an Eb and F, and a perfect fifth around it.  Play around with that on the piano!\n\nAnother of my favorite chords is the IV/V slash chord.  Best example is F/G, which you'd voice G C F A.  It's both dominant and subdominant, which is cool.\n\nI like adding #11's to major chords.  Adding 9ths is good for any chord as well.  Just be careful because the 9th is not always helpful.\n\nI *love* V13 and Vb13 chords.  In C major, this would be G F B E; in C minor, G F B Eb.  You might think that you need a lot of notes in a 13th chord, because in textbooks you see them stacked in 3rds -- C E G B D F A.  Don't do that.  1, 3, (b)6, and b7 is all that's necessary in a dominant (b)13 (b the 6 in a b13, natural 6 in a natural 13).\n\nm6 chords are great, too, since the 6 isn't in the minor scale, so it gives either a dorian feel or a complex melodic minor feel.  Gershwin's Summertime, from Porgy and Bess, starts with an Am6 that alternates with an E7.  Am6 would be voiced A C E F#, and the E7 would be E B D G# (actually, no clue about the middle two voices in each chord; I only care about the bottom and top), so the F# to G# melody in the upper voice is nice and compelling.\n\nBy the way, add a b9 to V7 chords to make V7b9.  In C minor, this would be G B D F Ab.

Start with the easy letters (such as E T S I O) and like another poster here has said, learn by *sound* and not by counting the dits and dahs.\n\nCW is like a foreign language - in a good way. In fact, it is indeed a foreign language, with all the abbreviations, etiquette, 'grammatical sequence' that QSO's normally follow. Look at it this way... Imagine that you speak Dutch, or Norwegian, or some other language that not many people speak... and you meet a person at random who also speaks that language. What happens? Well, you would happily launch into speaking and sharing stories, etc. You instantly have a bond, a special connection between you. I have friend who is from Switzerland and occasionally he meets another Swiss person who speaks Swiss-German, and wow, what a fantastic time they have together, like old friends getting together. That is what it is like when you can fluently speak CW!! Not only that, but your CW signal really cuts through to the DX and you can have a fantastic time chasing DX with simple wire antennas and low power.\n\nDid you know that there are two international CW clubs with thousands of members ready to help you? I belong to SKCC (Straight Key Century Club) and what a great group!! I had a wonderful time yesterday participating in the Weekend Sprint. FISTS is the other big club (not free like SKCC though). There are other CW groups - just google them.\nBoth SKCC and FISTS have sked pages where you can arrange a contact with another member - this is great for getting awards but also for beginners who want someone who will send slowly, etc.\n\nGood luck with your CW.

{"body": "Mehhhh...\n\nI don't think that explanation is applicable.  First of all, most people are familiar with the circle of fifths but have never really looked at it as a spiral.  Pedagogically, that should probably be first.  But more importantly, we pretty much *all* use 12-tone equal temperament, and anything *other* than 12TET is pretty specialized knowledge and it's generally not necessary for understanding.  This means that the explanation is technically correct -- yes, if you fiddle with the tuning, you'll get a pitch distinction between F# and Gb -- but not at all *useful*, because most people *don't* fiddle with the tuning.  The difference between F# and Gb simply does not matter to most people making most music because they're not going for alternative tunings.\n\nIn our 12-tone reality, F# and Gb are just two different ways of writing the exact same note, and they're useful at different times.  In G major, you want to write an F#, while in Db major, you want to write a Gb.  That much of the video was right on.  But the better example would be to write a G major scale G A B C D E Gb G versus G A B C D E F# G -- the former is nearly unreadable!  (Did you guys see that Happy Birthday To You arrangement going around on r/musictheory last month?)  The Gb breaks the logic of the G major scale, and similarly, the F# would break the logic of the Db major scale.  Of course there are times when it's ambiguous which to choose -- the soprano part to one of the songs my group is singing has a terrible E# to D natural that is un-sightreadable, but the E# resolves to F# in the alto so it technically makes sense -- but that just shows that the only difference here is spelling.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334028072", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

It is usually caused by respiratory\nviruses for which antibiotics are useless. Other potential treatment options are of substantial public health interest.\nSince vitamin C was isolated in the 1930s it has been proposed for respiratory infections. It became particularly popular in the 1970s\nwhen Nobel laureate Linus Pauling concluded from earlier placebo-controlled trials that vitamin C would prevent and alleviate the\ncommon cold. Over two dozen new trials were undertaken thereafter. Vitamin C has been widely sold and used as both a preventive\nand therapeutic agent.\nThis review is restricted to placebo-controlled trials testing 0.2 g per day or more of vitamin C. Regular ingestion of vitamin C had no\neffect on common cold incidence in the ordinary population. However, it had a modest but consistent effect in reducing the duration\nand severity of common cold symptoms. In five trials with participants exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress (including\nmarathon runners and skiers) vitamin C halved the common cold risk.\nTrials of high doses of vitamin C administered therapeutically, starting after the onset of symptoms, showed no consistent effect on\neither duration or severity of common cold symptoms. However, only a few therapeutic trials have been carried out, and none have\nexamined children, although the effect of prophylactic vitamin C has been greater in children. One large trial with adults reported\nequivocal benefit froman 8 g therapeutic dose at the onset of symptoms, and two trials using five-day supplementation reported benefit.\nMore trials are necessary to settle the possible role of therapeutic vitamin C, meaning administration immediately after the onset of\nsymptoms.\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub3/pdf/standard  for full review.\n\nAlthough this actually shows more of an effect than I have previously been led to believe- it is still a very weak effect.  The common cold is a viral infection. If you have already developed symptoms the virus has infected your cells and it WILL make you sick.

This is the thing that is going to kill this spec and it's republic mirror.  \n\nA 33% increase in the CD is not made up for by a 5% damage increase, also think about the fact that this lessens the amount of DoT uptime from Acid blade.  If you can't see how this is a massive Fuck you from BW to Op/Scoun well, I have a bridge to sell you.\n\nHidden Strike now has a 7.5-second cooldown.  \n\n- All this does is prevent the double open, something only used situationally to drop High Priority targets, with HS's previous nerfs, all this does is slow down our playstyle and pigeon hole HS Vanish into a defensive CD, some people think this is good, I disagree and think it limits our playstyle.\n\nSleep Dart now gives an appropriate error message if used on Droids.\n\n\nTactical Advantage no longer triggers a \"grunt\" sound effect when it occurs.\n\n-This is a blatent nerf to the \"fun\" of playing an Conceal Operative.  Nerfing the \"giggle\" when proc'ing Collateral Strike is what made me L O V E CONCEALMENT.  Nothing was more gratifying than hitting that final Lacerate/CStrike for a kill and procing the giggle.  This reeks of Forum crying about someone that died to an Operative when they were herping their derp in a WZ and got jumped.\n\n**Concealment**\n\n* Culling has been redesigned and is now a 2-point skill. It no longer increases damage dealt to poisoned targets, but increases the Energy gained by Stim Boost and the damage dealt by Laceration and Collateral Strike.  \n\n Nerf, all damage increased by 3% to energy regen we already had and a minor buff to our finisher, IIRC people on the PTS reported that the talen gave a 1-2 or 2-4% increase to Lac.\n\n* Inclement Conditioning is now a 2-point skill.  \n- Nerfs extra endurance, the values were not changed.\n\n* Flanking is a new 1-point skill located in Tier 3 of the skill tree. It reduces the Energy cost of Backstab by 5.  \n\nThis is a nerf, Backstab's lack of energy cost is what made it so appealing, and will make rotation clunky and more energy hungry.  5 energy BS+ 15 energy AB = 20 energy, making BS/AB one of the highest energy consuming moves we have, basically after using this, you have to Rifle Sot, wheras before you could Shiv+Lacerate right away.  More rifle shots = less damage as they are mitigated by armor/shields, and we rock low accuracy in favor of Power/Crit/Surge.\n\n\n* Laceration now costs 10 Energy (down from 15) and deals approximately 10% less damage.  \n\n- Energy change is nice, but we still have to juggle 2 resources, and nerfs our \"Finishing move\" below what it was, not compensated by the Culling change, -10% damage and iirc it's a 4% increase from the talents. Another Nerf, this time to our \"sustain\".\n \n\n* Meticulously Kept Blades no longer increases Energy gained by Stim Boost. This effect is now part of Culling.\n\n* Waylay now increases the damage dealt by Backstab. It is now located in Tier 5 of the skill tree and requires Flanking.\n\nNeed to see the trees compared, but all in al these changes reek of more forum tears, uneeded, and unnessesarily applied damage nerfs that ARE NOT compensated for in \"sustained\" (how do you sustain when all your damaging moves have a 6-12 second CD).  Our 30m attacks all either have low damage/no synergy, or long CDs, our gap closing ability remains unchanged, and we are still the lowest of the inital parses for MDPS.\n\nAdaptation is one thing, but when developers nerf a spec 4 times in a 2 month period, you begin to lose faith when you see the hardest classes for you to handle Sin/Shadow Mara/Sent either left in a brokenly OP state (Sin/Shadow) or buffed even further into rediculand, (Mara/Sent) you just kinda stop caring.\n\nThe only adapting Operative Scoundrels have to do is learning to heal, because MDPS is off the table completely in any competative form.

{"body": "I don't mind seeing naked women in the locker room. It's quite normal. We need to shower, sauna, change clothes, whatever..\n\nBut one day, in between workouts, I went back into the locker room to drop something off in my locker. There were two very, uh.. how shall I put this.. bulbous women that had gone into the room earlier, but I never saw them left. Going back in, they were completely butt naked. One was sitting on the low table-thing in front of the lockers, talking on her cell phone. I don't think she was sitting on a towel. The other one was padding around, barefoot, ALSO talking on her cell phone. After I went back to finish another workout, I returned and they were STILL wandering around in the nude, yakking on their phones. I don't remember seeing them going out into the actual gym at ALL. Maybe they were using the sauna, but I think they spent the majority of their time wandering around, showing everything off where the sun don't shine, using the area as a conference room for their phone calls.\n\nWhen I left, I got stuck in the parking lot (one way exits) behind a taxi cab, whose clients were taking F O R E V E R to get out of the fucking car. I realized, based on overhearing some of the conversation, that one of the women was talking to these people, because she was instructing them how to get to the gym. A really old man and two other people finally got out, and they definitely looked related to one of the women. \n\nIt just really, really confused me. Why hang out naked at a gym, and have people be dropped off in a taxi? Were they picking them up? Were they going to have a sauna party? What was going on??\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I'm not making fun of them because they were large women. I found it really odd that they would just strut around with no shame. I wouldn't be comfortable with *anyone* waltzing around the locker room, naked, for extended periods of time. I was just mentally excited for them, 'cause it's like, \"Awright, girl. You're proud of your body. You're at the gym. You're working hard!\" But no. No. They didn't do anything. They sat there. Naked. On their phones.

Just to give you an idea of my setup, I use 1-6, ctrl 1-6, F V Q E R T, and the +ctrl variants of those. I haven't played my BH in awhile, so sorry about not remembering the names of a lot of the attacks.\n\nI put my basic no energy attack (hammer shot?) in slot 1, tracer missile in slot 2, the timed AoE missile in 3, heat seeking missiles in 4, the channeled blaster shots in 5, the explosive fire dot AoE in ctrl 1, upper cut in ctrl 2, the weak AoE blaster shots in ctrl 3, death from above in ctrl 4, flame thrower in ctrl 5, and rail shot in R. All the other \"non-attack\" abilities such as heals, stuns, and knock backs I put in the other letter keys that I described above.\n\nPvE is pretty straight forward. Start with Death from Above if you're fighting a group and it's off cooldown (which will pretty much kill all fodder npcs out right), and depending on how many are left or the amount of HP they have, finish them off with tracer missiles + railshot, upper cuts, or the channeled blaster shots. \n\nHonestly, I probably shouldn't be giving advice since it's been awhile since I played the character, and I remember everything being a cake walk PvE wise. Might help if you tell us your level, and what sort of issues you're having exactly.

One need only to see his recent comment history, where he has made making meaningful contributions to the reddit community. For instance, there's this one he posted in [/r/atheism](/r/atheism), where he says logically, [\"What if the front page looking like r/circlejerk   \nIs because /r/circlejerk gets its ideas from the front page? keanu.jpg\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rl2bg/seth_mcfarlane_is_producing_a_13_episode_sequel/c46tc54?context=3). That was a pretty good joke. Or was it a profound statement? It is sometimes hard to tell the difference when one is as enlightened as my friend Dave. In the future, however, I'd recommend you spruce it up with a **K E A N U C E P T I O N**. \"Whoa\" indeed, my budding satirist.\n\nOr another one where he says, [\"If only more parents and guardians could be as loving as you, Child-Gentleman-Bear.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/rl3vo/why_are_your_parents_lucky_to_have_you/c46u8bz?context=3) This was also funny, as well as smart, because you commented on the previous poster's name. When you commented on his that user's name, do you know what you did? I'll tell you what you didn't do. You definitely did not half-ass your interaction with a stale, desperate, backhanded brown-nosing attempt at receiving exactly one upvote. No intellectual slouch are you! You instead made a hilarious, thought-provoking analysis, and greatly enhanced the overall quality of discourse on reddit.\n\nThere's also this gem you left shining for all to see, [\"Came here for bulbs; saw nothing bulbous\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/rrj2v/bulbafett/c4860nh). Although you might not have been trying to be funny or smart in that one--but you could have been! Sometimes it's hard for the common denominator layman to understand your truisms. But it's possible you you were just trying to attention whore because the word \"bulb\" is in your username. However, giving you the benefit of the doubt, it is indeed interesting and noteworthy that \"bulb\" is in your name and how it was ALSO in the submission title! One can see how you might have been let down to not have found anything \"bulbous\" about the submission! I mean, what are the odds! Only science can tell us. Sometimes life is really funny and we just need to stop and listen for the laughter.\n\nNone the less, keep fighting the good fight, my fellow crusader in logic! I recently saw you helped your fellow atheist with your [logical thinking](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rxzd4/easter_weekend_on_facebook/c49n0d4?context=3), and it warms my godless heart to see this level of community support in these oppressive times.

It only becomes easy once you're familiar enough with your scales and whatever you're improvising over for neither of them to require laboured, conscious thought. \n\nSome backing tracks: http://www.jazzpracticeloops.com/loops/251.htm (more jazzy) and\nhttp://www.freejamtracks.com/ (more general).\n\nThere are some great books + CD sets around which will give you a tune with a backing followed by some sketched out improv sections, with full chord notation for each change (I used some by a guy called Jamey Aebersold for sax: http://www.jazzbooks.com/)\n\nIf you're looking for a quick solution to become more confident (and we're still talking musically) then learn your basic major/minor pentatonics (these are the building blocks for \"which notes sound good\" over a given chord and generally come to make up most well-known and catchy melodies). For example:\n\nA Minor Pentatonic is A C D E G A (ie. root, minor third, fourth, fifth, and minor seventh)\nC Major pentatonic is C D E G A C (ie. root, second, major third, fifth, and major sixth scale degrees)\n\nBeyond that, just play over tunes you know really well, and more than anything have confidence in your abilities. Notes won't quite fit and will sound weird before you become comfortable but, particularly in Jazz, you can justify anything (Oh yeah I totally meant to play the minor 9th there,it added tension right?)\n\nSorry this advice isn't more general, good luck\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334236783", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Are you crazy\n\nsigh.  just look at the scandinavian countries.  they have a very high rate of taxation that hit the richest hardest.  this has the effect of paying for socialized services that provide the less well off with those services they desperately need.\n\nwhat you call \"crazy\" is already in effect in the world.\n\n&gt; I'm not saying you shouldn't help those in need, that's what charity is for, but the difference is one allows people to help by choice while what you're suggesting is just stealing money.\n\nyou guys are soooooo tired with your citation of charity.  listen, if charity WORKED... if it actually provided for the tremendous need, even in this country, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\nyou don't fight WW2 with the boy scouts.\n\nthe health and needs of the poor is NOT met with charity alone.\n\nsome problems REQUIRE the scale of government to address.\n\n&gt; Believe it or not the majority of the rich in America are did not inherit their fortunes\n\nmany did.  \n\nand you miss the point... which i made crystal clear - the ability to work hard and achieve success in and of itself is a GIFT that one did not earn. \n\n- soundness of mind and body\n- born to good parents vs. drug addled molesters\n- born in america\n- etc.\n\nnobody achieves success with NOTHING going for them... and the underlying things going for them, they had nothing to do with and did not in any sense EARN THEM.  get it?\n\n&gt; Bottom line the rich aren't an evil entity that seek to destroy you, why do you group them all together as soulless monsters that shouldn't be able to decide what to do with the money they, in many cases but not all, earned.\n\ni will not speak with you if you do not read what i write.  **NOBODY EARNS ANYTHING FAIR AND SQUARE.**\n\nTHE **ABILITY** TO WORK HARD AND SUCCEED IS A GIFT.\n\n&gt; Next major point, you still don't seem to understand the government regulation doesn't always help keep businesses in check\n\nyou still don't seem to understand that this is a gigantic assumption on your behalf.\n\nupton sinclair's the jungle spurred the creation of the FDA that ended the practices that he wrote about.\n\nwe do not have child labor in america because of revised labor laws.\n\nyou cannot discriminate against race when hiring because of laws.\n\nanti monopoly laws were not invented because we had no problems with monopolies in this country...\n\ni can go on and on and on in which govt DOES keep corporations in check.\n\n**WE DIDN'T CREATE THOSE LAWS BECAUSE THERE WAS N O T A PROBLEM**\n\nyou enjoy the good and safe life you do now on the back of laws that make those corporations run through the hoops to make their products and services as good and fair as they are.\n\n&gt;  When you have a system of lobbying that allows corporations to direct policy making you are not working by \"free market\" standards, in a more natural market the companies would have no reason to send lobbyists since the government would have a policy of non-intervention for most matters of business.\n\nyou assume that corporations have anything in mind other than increasing shareholder value... if the govt were hands off, then they would do all kinds of shit that would harm society just to make a buck.\n\nyou are **NAIVE**.  you distrust government.  but your true flaw is that you TRUST commerce.\n\nwhich is insane.\n\nyou somehow trust that the market will self regulate and through competition, end up creating wonderful behavior that is to the benefit of all.\n\nsrsly, do you go through life with your eyes closed?\n\nall of the corporate regulations we have were put into place because CORPORATIONS WERE CAUGHT DOING BAD SHIT.\n\nthey would NOT have changed without government regulation.\n\nand corporations can exert power and influence in non political means to squash opposition.\n\n- gigantic ad campaigns to cover up lies\n- gigantic legions of lawyers to sue opponents into oblivion\n- continuing to sell harmful products or exercise harmful business practices and covering up with an ad campaign\n- exploiting the poor and vulnerable who are unseen in order to make a bigger buck (erin brokovich and latin american countries today where villages are being poisoned but no one cares because it's out in the boonies).\n\nadditionally you fundamentally misunderstand economics.\n\nif i make widgets, i will do everything in my power to sell more widgets.\n\nwhat if my widgets cause harm and makes society worse?\n\nwhat if i can fool people into thinking that it does not make anything worse by buying scientists and ad campaigns and just drowning out the truth?\n\nat least with govt, there are priorities greater than just making a buck.  at least with govt, i have a say with my vote.\n\n&gt;

{"body": "More on bases:\n\nOur regular number system is base 10, also known as decimal. We have symbols 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (ten symbols), and \"10\" means ten, \"100\" means one hundred, \"200\" means two hundred, etc.\n\nYou can have other bases. Binary is another name for base 2, and it only has symbols 0 and 1 (two symbols). 10 means 1*2 = 2, 100 means 1*2*2 = 4, etc.\n\nAs a demonstration of a more general case, let's take base-8. That means we have eight symbols, 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Suppose I have a number xyz (where x, y, z are digits, not variables multiplied together). Then the z position represents 8^0 = 1 unit each, the y position represents 8^1 = 8 units each, and the x position represents 8^2 = 64 units each. And so on if you had more digits on the left.\n\nSo if you have 1 in base-8, that means 1 in decimal;\n\n10 (base 8) = 8 (base 10);\n\n100 (base 8) = 64 (base 10).\n\nWhat if you had 400? Well, in that case, you have _four units_ in the 8^2 = 64s position, so you have 4*64 = 256.\n\nWhat about 231? Well, you have 2 units in the 64s position (= 128 decimal), 3 units in the 8s position (= 24 decimal) and 1 unit in the 1s position (= 1 decimal). That's 128+24+1 = 154 in decimal.\n\n___\n\nWhy does anyone care about this?\n\nDifferent bases are just a _different way of writing_ numbers. For an example of applications, binary's the most useful to computers and digital electronics, because we can just represent numbers as either \"on\" or \"off\", or a high voltage and a low voltage. Transistors are inherently on/off devices that output either a high or low voltage, so making hardware that does binary is pretty much natural. (Transistors also have a weird transition state that doesn't really give you a definite \"level\"—that transition state is useful for analogue stuff like audio amplifiers/radio transmitters and receivers, but when you want the precision of a digital system you can't make it into a \"state\" to get base-3 or anything like that).\n\nIt's also been said that base-12 is the base that would make the most sense for day-to-day use, because 12 is evenly divisible by the most small prime factors, so you end up minimising the number of repeated non-zero decimal expansions for rational numbers.\n\nBase-16 (a.k.a. hexadecimal) has sixteen symbols—since we only have ten digits, we usually use letters: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F. It's an interesting base for programmers, because one digit of base-16 is exactly 4 digits of binary, so it's a compact way of representing binary information as used by a computer.

Before I started this, I was easily eating over 3,000 calories a day - and I put on a lot of weight over the years post-college due to eating junk food, food in excess and lots of soft drinks. Nowadays, I am a big guy (but wasn't about 5 years ago - I weighed about 185 then).\n\nFirst thing I did was cut out all pop (ALL!) and fast food. I've pretty much only drank water for the past month. Rarely do I drink tea/juice/milk/etc. --- Just water, water, water!\n\nAnd when you start counting calories, if you simply EAT fewer times during the day and eat smaller portions, you will start losing tons of weight. 1lb. of fat = approx. 3,500 calories. So if you create a calorie deficit of 700 calories a day, you will lose 1 lb. of fat every 5 days. \n\nYou know that Jared guy from Subway? Before that diet, he consumed 10,000 CALORIES A DAY. He went from that down to 2,000 a day.\n\nHe lost over 200lbs. in ONE YEAR. O_O\n\nIf you really want to lose weight, screw all those diet fads, fancy exercising, etc. - just EAT LESS. It does work.

Alan Watts had a lot to say on the subject of Jesus in Buddhism, and I would say he's worth a listen (with a grain of salt, as always) if you want a more in depth view from someone who was raised Anglican and then not only converted to Zen but served as one of the most critical figures in bringing the philosophy to the attention of the West.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334806865", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you're going in for the kill, you want to proc the two 2-second silences from the first two abilities to prevent the target from escaping (and to keep you safe from counter attack). It doesn't matter so much which ability you follow up [](/leblanc_r \"Mimic\") with, but you'll usually be far enough away from the target at that point that [](/leblanc_w \"Distortion\") is necessary to close the distance.

{"body": "Like Vlad? Seriously?  Vlad was all chest and arms, he had chicken legs his whole career, look at Hammy, hes all legs.  Kinda important in staying in the field.  Besides you honestly believe Hambone cant play 1st base? Hes stated he'd be willing to do that, and did so in HS when he was a pitcher throwing 95.  There is no comparison between Vlad and Hamilton, one can field, and all the other had in the field was a strong arm.  Vlad and Cruz are almost identical.  Now Vlad and Hammy's approach at the plate are similar (swing at anything) but other than that they are worlds apart. \n\nFurther a guy who says he is 31 (prob 34) just signed a 10 year deal for way more money that Hambone is asking for and is at best 85% as good as hamilton.  When Hamilton is healthy and not listening to shitty hitting coaches he hits 400+.  He hit 400+ for 3 months in 2010 and he just may do it for 6 months this year.  If you wanna compete with the angels for years to come you cant play Oakland style farm system for the yankees baseball.  We have the 3rd most lucrative T.V. contract in the game (behind Yanks and Sox).  We draw over 3M fans a year in 100 degree weather half the time.  We will sell millions upon millions of Darvish, Kinsler etc jerseys in Japan this year and for years to come (we should change Darvish's # every year just for this). The money is there, spend it and make more.  To think that Leonis Martin is gonna come up next year and hit 300 is crazy, if you look at our top fielding prospects for the last 10 years we haven't had many who popped.  Yes Elvis and Cruz did, did Chris Davis? Did Salty? Did Teagarden? Did Smoak? Did Borbon?  So to think you can replace the best player in the game with a AAA guy and be competitive the next year is crazy.  Not only that but without Hamilton where in the lineup is a lefty?  Murphy would pretty much be it with the way Moreland finished last season and has started this one.  So in the late innings the heart of the lineup would be Beltre, Young, Cruz, Napoli or R R R R and the 1 + 2 guys are R R giving you 6 right handers in a row, in other words, an opposing managers wildest wet dream. \n\nThe guy is asking for 22-25 million a year and not asking for 10 years, unlike a pretty much DH only who plays for some team in detroit who we were reportedly offering a deal (Duh cuz we need more LH power!!).  And I believe he'll still be in the outfield at 40 but even if he's not, like I say 1st base is an option.  Not to mention, our DH only (who OP mentions is our worst fielder) who is not close to Hamilton in talent, is making 16M this year.  Not to mention you can always trade him if needed (kinda did that with some 3rd baseman who plays for some team in NY and has the worst contract in the history of baseball, and who got more money in 2002 than Hamilton is even asking for).  \n\nThis is a big market team with deep pockets.  We don't and shouldn't act like this is Oakland.  Sign the core, and Hamilton DEFINES the core.  We can make a guy who hit 255 last year the richest 2nd baseman in the history of the game for 15M a year, but we can't give an MVP who hit 359 in 2010 22M? And anyone who thinks drugs are an issue, if he fails one more test he's banned from the game so his contract in that situation would be null and void so there is 0 risk there.  If that happens, ya it sucks for us, but would suck even more is if he signed with the Angels or Yankees or Tigers or Sox...

{"body": "This is a seriously long story... so hope you can wade through it...\n\nI give my Stepdad major props for his involvement in my life.\n\nA little backstory: My mother and father were quite happy. My father was liked by everyone in my family. He was a music teacher in northern Baltimore County here in MD, and loved by all of his students. He passed away 20 years ago from Melanoma. I was 2 years old, so I never really got to know him, but everyone who did agrees he was a standup guy who wanted nothing more than to teach music and love his family.\n\nIn 94, I was just about 5 years old and my mother re-married. My stepfather was 24, she was 30, almost 31. I loved the crap outta this man. He'd come over while they were dating and play with me. At one point, my mom said that he and I could only play after I finished cleaning my room. I started sobbing and exclaimed, \"BUT THAT'S HARD WORK!\" much to their delight... I finished cleaning and we went about playing.\n\nHe always wanted to spoil me rotten. Always claiming I didn't have enough to open on Christmas. \"Oh, these 15 presents aren't enough. We should get him a new bike to go with his new bike.\" It takes a serious kind of person to come into another family, raise someone else's kids as his own, and generally be an awesome guy.\n\nNow the challenges started when I hit about 7 years old. I started slacking off in school. I wasn't challenged, so I knew all of the material, but I never wanted to do homework or projects. I just wanted to coast by learning by classwork and participation. All my teachers loved me, but agreed that I just REFUSED to do homework. When I was 8, I got a little better because my 3rd grade teacher was AWESOME, but once I hit 4th grade, everything went back to the way it was. This trend continued into High School, only in High School I got clever and became a bit of a brat. \n\nIt got to the point where my parents would want a written list of everything I had for homework, and would sit me at the table until I finished each assignment and showed it to them. Well, me thinking I was clever, would just write down \"No Homework!\" in the list. Of course, I'm pretty sure they knew the whole time that I actually had homework. Sure enough when progress report time came around, I had a 90% in classwork, 100% in participation, and like 10% in homework, and 40% in projects. This averaged to about C's, sometimes even D's. Now, this would've been tolerated if I had tried my best, but I clearly just didn't care about the assignments or my grades.\n\nIn all of this, I caused a bit of a rift in my family. I pitted one parent against the other, relying on the fact that my mother's good nature would give me the benefit of the doubt 90% of the time. Of course, at the time I didn't realize I was doing this, I just knew \"Hey, mom will believe me. Let's try mom.\" I didn't realize I was making my parents pretty miserable. Most of all, my stepdad. We got into it pretty bad about school stuff.\n\nI'd bring home progress reports, he'd yell at me for not doing well, and I'd play the victim and divert the situation onto him, claiming he was handling it terribly, and he'd be painted as the bad guy. Man, looking back, I was a manipulative little brat, wasn't I?\n\nSure, I got away with a few things, but most of my crap was caught and thrown back in my face. There certainly were a lot of good times, mostly outweighing the bad, but around report card week, my parents knew what they were in for, and the house got noticeably darker in mood. \"Listn2moremetal, it's almost report card time. Any surprises we're in for?\" \"No way! I'm doing great!\" C C D B A B. \"What the heck is this?\" \"Uhh.....\"\n\nThis went on for 3 years of High School. My senior year I sort of wised up and did better, but there were still bad moments. Not nearly as many as before, though.\n\nNow the fun part. I got into a state university here, and decided this was MY time to just have a whole lot of fun and go to no classes. My first semester, I had a total GPA of 0.64. My parents were furious. This was the worst I'd ever done in school. I was ALWAYS a smart kid, but I never just... didn't try at any facet of school. In college, I just forgot that there was a school part of university...\n\nAnyway, to avoid ranting more, in all this my stepdad never stopped loving me. My mom, too... but it was her job to love me. She gave birth to me...\n\nHere's this guy who just walked into our family, put up with my sister who did a lot more than I ever did, then put up with me who put him through a different type of Hell and pit he and his wife against each other on more than one occasion. And in the end, after all of it, he STILL loves me. A kid he had no obligation to ever love. A kid he never HAD to take care of. A kid who, by all rights, didn't deserve it.\n\nHere's to you, Listn2moremetal's stepdad. For putting up with all the crap I put you through and waiting patiently for me to come back and say \"Hey, I'm a little brat. Thanks for putting up with me.\"\n\nThanks for putting up with me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334867392", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, Janna can be both offensive and defensive. The best thing about Janna, though, is her ability to completley turn a losing fight into your favor. Janna is more of a ... booster? I guess.. She makes your AD shine. You can trade hits with the SUPPORT only, as you'll regen it, and just play back, but she does have shorter range, so..going up to their AD and hitting them isn't the best idea. I do trade hits with the AD sometimes, though, when my AD is hitting them, as they'll probably be too busy hitting my AD back. Try to predict and shield incoming damage. Shield isn't a last OH SHIT save spell, the more you use the entire shield, the better. She comes in super handy when it comes to ganks. Keep everything (tri, lane bush, river/dragon) warded, and anytime someone comes, you can Q them to stop them from coming in too far. Slow people when your AD is low, and you have more health, so they'll probably switch to hitting you (short range and all, so be careful. :) make sure you have enough to survive). \n\nSo basically I'm not sure there is too much you can do as janna to \"turn' the tides of he lane besides trying to highlight what your AD does.

{"body": "The creationist stance is that species(or baramins) have variation from generation to generation, but those variations cancel each other out. The species stays the same.\n\nI can demonstrate how that is not very likely.  \n\nWe'll use a simple earthworm as an example. One of the only ways its offspring can vary is in their length. A child of one worm would(and probably is) a little big longer or a little bit shorter, so 50/50 and like a coin toss, it averages out, correct?  \n\nNope. You can test this with a coin toss.  \n\nLet us say the worm is 3 inches long, and each succeeding generation is either 1/128th inch longer or shorter(we are effectively ignoring generations where a child remains the same length as their parent). We are also pretending the changes happen very very fast. 1/128 inch variation per generation would be enormous.  \n\nWe can toss coins and use them as additions and subtractions from the current length.  \n\nThis is 20 coin tosses.  \nT T T T H T T T H T H T T H H T T T H H  \n\nseven of them are \"H\", and 13 are \"T\", so that is 3.0+(7x0.0078125)-(13x0.0078125) which works out to a worm of the 21st generation being 2.953125 inches long.  \n\nI'll do it again with 200. We'll start with the 3 inch worm again.  \n\nI get 109 heads, 91 tails. That results in a worm of the 201st generation with a length of 3.140625. Its not really trending back to average is it?  \n\nIn fact my examples show that the worm could change in either direction... evolution doesn't have a preferential goal. I admit my example is a bit short sighted because you could get a worm with zero or negative length, given enough generations.   \n\nI wrote a program so that you can test out my idea. It runs in python version 2.6 or greater.  \n\nYou can view the script here, it is 18 lines: http://pastebin.com/hYc1jACS  \n\nChange these lines in the script to experiment.\n\n    wormlength = 3.0\n    generations = 2000\n    length_variation = 1.0/128\n\nIf you run it a few times, you will see it clusters around 3.0, but very rarely is it right close. \n\nOnce you apply this idea independently to different traits of an animal, you can see how its almost impossible to maintain a master type appearance. Over enough generations, every species changes. Of course there are other selective pressures, such as the ability to gather food and evade predators.\n\nDid you know there are incredibly huge earth worms on earth? http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/03/south-african-earthworms-can-grow-as-large-as-22-feet-long/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335081139", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let's start by examining the correlation between balls and hell.  Though both from different units of measurement, they convert at a rate of 1=1.  So for every measurement of balls, it is paralleled by an equal measurement of hells.\n\n1. Jimmy went outside and realized it was hot as balls\n1. a) Jimmy went outside and realized it was hot as hell.\n\nWell, the amount of fucks used for any one thing is displayed by the equation (b x c)/2=F.  So we can say that the product of all the  balls (b) and hells (c), divided by two, must have a value of at least one for there to be any possibility of a fuck (F) given.\n\n2. If Jimmy goes outside and states \"It's cold as hell, this sucks balls.  Big, big balls.\" \nHe has a product of 1 because two sets of balls and one set of hell were used.  This can be converted into one whole fuck.  So he would have also been accurate with his temperature measurement by saying \"It is cold as fuck!\"\n\nApplying the same rule we can see what Jimmy would do in a different scenario.\n\n3.  \"Breaking my arm hurt like hell, it really sucked balls.  The cast made me sweaty as hell and made my arm itch like balls.\"\nJimmy uses 2 sets of hells and 2 sets of balls to convey his dismay at having a cast on.  When put through the equation we find that his message is only two fucks strong.  Therefore Jimmy could have conveyed the same feeling by saying, \"It was painful as fuck to break my arm.  The cast made me sweat and itch like a motherfucker.\"\n\n\nWhen we add an exponential variable into the equation things get a little more tricky.  The exponent \"shitload\" can be added into any equation with ease but can not directly be converted into neither balls or hell.  It however can be converted into a fuck by using the formula: F= (cL) x (sL)/(.5 x sL)  Where a fuck (F) equals a crap load (cL) times the result of a shit load (sL) divided by 1/2 a shit load (sL).  Often when shit loads are converted into fuck a subsequent multiplier is added to the fuck (fuck ton, mega fuck ton, fuck watt, fuck joule, etc...)  When adding sL to a b x c = F equation, sL may be added as an exponent to either balls or hell, depending on the subject of the sentence.  \n\n4.  \"That bitch put me through a hell of a shitload of nonsense.  I was always tired as balls running around for her and she was needy as hell.  Even though the relationship was total balls she was a hell of a ball-sucker\"\nNow in this example we see little Jimmy used hell three times with one variation of hell^shitload power, balls was only used two times as the last variation was not being used descriptively.  So we can convert this sentence as follows:\n\n\"That fuck put me through a fuck-tastrophe of nonsense.  I was always tired cause she's needy as fuck.

It may have been reuploaded and the previous copies deleted from the server, or live-streamed or something. However, there are two copies of three on the soundcloud, one () slightly longer than the other.\n    These locations are thought to be the drop locations mentioned in Transmission 1. It was suggested that the list was of places with cult activity, but this has been rejected.   The more ominous explanation is that they are targets.\n    The \"western wind\" could be a Foehn Wind, which are associated with illnesses ranging from migraines to psychosis and have been suggested to cause increased suicide rates. It may also reference the  movement of air streams across the pacific ocean toward the US West coast. The escalating tension between N/S Korea may have interplay here. Another possibility is Stellar Wind, codename for NSA domestic communications data mining operations.\n    Wind is also mentioned in Transmission 10 (“meaningless as wind in dry grass”), and in the Ezekiel 37 verses pointed to by Transmission 8.\n    Kanangu is the site where The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God killed 530 of its followers.\n    Mary is possibly the Virgin Mary as many of the cults were Marians and involved visions of Mary. The Wind Cries Mary is a song by Jimi Hendrix.\n    In Western Tradition, the West Winds are considered to be mild and agreeable, bringing the spring with them; although this would be in stark contrast to the outright warning of \"FIND THE TRUTH OR WE WILL ALL PERISH\". The intent could be to symbolize that for the time being things are calm or that spring will be the time when the “drops” occur.\n    The transmission was released on March 22nd. On March 22nd a post from Umbra appeared on his Spreaker wall reading: ‘Time is running out’.\n    The Occupy May 1st General Strike page (http://www.occupymay1st.org/) seems to point to a possible connection, as they connect the 4 parts of their movement in LA to the 4 winds.  Specifically the West Wind is the only one currently mapped out on the site (as of 4-12-2012)\n\n\n\n\f\nTransmission 4:\nDate: 22 Mar - Length: 4:45  \nTranscribed:\n\nCHARLIE ONE UMBRA\n\nCHARLIE ONE UMBRA\n\nPASSTYPE ALPHA MINUS ONE\n\nI SAY AGAIN PASSTYPE ALPHA MINUS ONE\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09\n\n12 00 24 01 2012\n\n12 00 24 01 2012\n\n12 00 24 01 2012\n\n22 07 00 19 10 08 13 03 14 05 18 19 00 17 03 08 03 19 07 04 24 05 08 13 03 19 07 04 06 17 04 00 19 21 14 24 00 06 04 14 02 02 20 17 17 04 03 14 13 19 07 04 04 21 04 14 05 19 7 4 18 14 11 18 19 8 2 4 5 17 0 13 2 4 18 22 8 19 25 4 17 11 0 13 3 16 20 4 1 4 2 5 17 0 13 2 4 9 4 18 20 18 10 8 11 11 4 3 19 7 4 8 13 5 0 13 19 0 13 19 8 2 7 17 8 18 19 22 8 19 7 0 22 14 14 3 4 13 18 19 0 10 4 8 13 21 4 18 19 8 6 0 19 4 8 13 21 4 18 19 8 6 0 19 4 8 13 21 4 18 19 8 6 0 19 4 18 7 0 17 4 10 13 14 22 11 4 3 6 4 0 12 0 18 18 10 13 14 22 11 4 3 6 4 18 19 14 15 19 7 4 12 12 0 24 1 2012 12 0 24 1 2012 12 0 24 1 2012\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nDecoded:\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nPASSTYPE ALPHA MINUS ONE\n\nI SAY AGAIN PASSTYPE ALPHA MINUS ONE\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nMAY 1 2012\n\nMAY 1 2012\n\nMAY 1 2012\n\nWHAT KIND OF STAR DID THEY FIND\n\nTHE GREAT VOYAGE OCCURRED ON THE EVE OF THE SOLSTICE\n\nFRANCE\n\nSWITZERLAND\n\nQUEBEC\n\nFRANCE\n\nJESUS KILLED THE INFANT ANTICHRIST WITH A WOODEN STAKE\n\nINVESTIGATE INVESTIGATE INVESTIGATE\n\nSHARE KNOWLEDGE\n\nAMASS KNOWLEDGE\n\nSTOP THEM\n\nMAY 1 2012\n\nMAY 1 2012\n\nMAY 1 2012\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nCHARLIE ONE umbra\n\nNotes:\n\n    This message concerns the deaths/ murders of the Order of the Solar Temple, which occurred in France, Switzerland, and Quebec (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Solar_Temple#Mass_murders_and_suicides ).

The suicides took place around solstice events. Joseph DiMambro was a co-founder of OTS. He was born in Pon Saint Esprit. In 1951 MKDELTA/MKULTRA poisoned the town’s bread with LSD.

The FBI report likely takes its report from this fact. Megiddo may also be a reference to Project Megiddo, the FBI report on possibility of millennial cult violence in the run-up to the new millenium.\n    \"95\" was the year that Sarin gas was released into the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo cult, see transmissions 2 and 10). \"97\" was the date of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide, and of the last Order of the Solar Temple suicides/murders.\n    Some have heard “Hello Margaret, Hello Margaret” , The piano tune in the intro seems similar to  this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335383690", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

He’ll destroy us all: tp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhairavhta  (I find it interesting that he used Bhairava instead of Kali. Though debatable, Kali is considered to be the strongest deity; she can be defeated by nothing. However, she isn’t all destruction and death. Unbelievably, she has a soft side, and she will protect her followers. Also, she has a close association with time.)  “Bhairava has a dog (Shvan) as his divine vahana (vehicle).” - dog in Transmission 13? This is also interesting: The origin of Bhairava can be traced to the conversation between Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu recounted in \"Shiv Maha-Puran\" where Lord Vishnu asks Lord Brahma who is the supreme creator of the Universe. Arrogantly, Brahma tells Vishnu to worship him because he (Brahma) is the supreme creator. This angered Shiva who in reality is the creator of all. Shiva then incarnated in the form of Bhairava to punish Brahma. Bhairava beheaded one of Brahma's five heads and since then Brahma has only four heads. When depicted as Kala Bhairava, Bhairava is shown carrying the decapitated head of Brahma. Cutting off Brahma's fifth head made him guilty of the crime of killing a Brahmin, and as a result, he was forced to carry around the head for years and roam as Bhikshatana, a mendicant, until he had been absolved of the sin. (Destroying creation; decapitating the supposed creator, etc.). Shiva was the chief deity of Aum Shinrikyo.\n    Bhairava is a Puranic deity, who originated during the medieval period. Bhairava in his host of forms, is primarily a guardian deity.. He is worshipped at lonely intersections, outside towns and villages, near cemetaries, for protection from all things occult. One of the most popular rituals of worship to Bhairava was observed before a war, wherein a black dog would be fed, among many things, blood. The dog would then be set loose in the direction of the enemy, and believed to bring destruction on the enemy. (Also important to note, several Indian soldiers who have wrote memoirs of fighting China and Pakistan in the 60s and 70s, recount that “Bhairava” was one of the most commonly used terms to describe the contingent that would storm a weapons bunker, effectively neutralizing them. I am currently trying to find a link to the source of this. If not, will return shortly with scans of said memoirs)\n    In reference to this transmission, Bhairava leading the way could mean something/someone might bring destruction on the enemy, by luring them with Shambhala.\n    “the way” fits with the “great voyage” theme.\n    Shambhala is a Buddhist mythical kingdom.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala). It’s also the name of “Shambhala International” and their “Shambhala training”(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala_Buddhism), the text of which is called “The Great Eastern Sun.”\n    The Earth’s oscillating has a scientific suggestion. This paired with the mention of Milgram and his experiments could be seen as tie to Hikari No Wa’s efforts to blend science and religion. Aum had a lot of interest in Tesla’s patents and ‘frequency resonance’. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335384193", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The inference of the sentence structure is that this process inverts  as “the walls of man fall”. This seems related to the statement in transmission 2 of “force the world to higher consciousness”.\n    Poa is a Tibetan idea, a ritual performed to help passage of the soul but borrowed by Aum. Poa became redemptive murder, used by Aum Shinrikyo founder Shoko Asahara, to essentially allow for the killing of those who would otherwise go to Hell. It was used in a chant of sorts, the last line of the transmission coming directly from the chant:\n\nI will poa all wrongdoers\n\nI will do whatever is required for the salvation of the world\n\nI will not stop this practice before I die from it\n\nNow as the bible explains, Armageddon is finally approachingI will join the holy army to poa all wrongdoers\n\nPoa is world salvation\n\n    The first example of this belief in action: \"Aum also developed a dark secret: a follower died accidentally during ascetic practice. This death was covered up to prevent the news harming Aum’s reputation, but when another follower who had been present decided to go public with the news, he was killed by Aum devotees in order to silence him. The killing was legitimated doctrinally on the grounds that it was necessary to kill him in order to save him from accruing the bad karma that would have come through jeopardizing Aum’s mission, and to save him from falling into the hells as a result. (Encyclopedia of Millenarian and Millennialist Movements)\n\nSource: Captain America And The Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma Of Zealous Nationalism Robert Jewett, John Shelton Lawrence\n\n    Re: Image, this could be electroconvulsive therapy or electro-encephalogram. Shoko Asahara believed he had abnormally low brain waves on EEG(http://casgroup.fiu.edu/pages/docs/862/1309449293_2003.pdf), and it’s thought Aum used ECT.  If it is ECT, that fits with the Milgram reference in Transmission 14. ECT has also been used in conjunction with meditation.\n\n    Image of Asahara in blue HappyHat the same as in image foundThe track on the last transmission is very similar to the file http://bodhisattva.x0\n    .to/music/shambarachyren.wma which is “recomended” on that page. It was tagged in Shazaam as Matt Farrell “Unashamed” It must be a Shazaam error as I did it again and it had Marc Cotterell “Tiz” as the tag. Matt Farrell is Principal Cellist at Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra\n    \"Statements by Russian converts in Aum publications indicate that a Russian orchestra organized by Aum, \"Chyren\" (Sanskrit for \"divine offering\"), drew a lot of favorable attention from Russians.\" (http://casgroup.fiu.edu/pages/docs/862/1309449293_2003.pdf) This could be Aum’s own Shambala song.\n    Little Sarii may be a reference to the magical genre anime Sally the Witch or Sarii Yumeno. Aum Shinrikyo used a song called “Sarin the Magician” modeled after the theme of Sally the Witch. The cult was known to use pet names for sarin such as Sally, Witch, and Magic.

{"body": "The Ryze changes are staying it seems, personally I think it's a big buff to his mid and early game power, with a negligible nerf to his late game.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Assuming 3000 mana late game he loses 30 damage on his Q, that's about 150 damage lost in his full combo, he gains 150 of that back from his E anyway given that each bounce deals 1%, 5 bounces means he gains all the damage back in his combo that was lost from his Q, assuming all bounces hit enemy targets.\n\n* Reducing Q damage from 7.5% to 6.5% reduces his damage by 10 for each 1000 mana he has, but the base damage on his Q is increased by 20 at all levels, which means before Ryze gains 2000 mana, he deals more damage on his Q than before and at a lower mana cost than before. Not to mention the doubling of his AP ratio on his Q, he gets his Q off about 4 times during his whole combo:\n\n* Q W Q E Q R Q,\nThat means from his Q alone he will deal about 1.6 AP to the enemy, this makes building a lategame Archangel much more potent on him and greatly outweighs the 30-40 lategame nerf to his Q damage.\n\n* The W CC reduction is a straight up nerf, but it's not very heavy and won't affect his overall balance very much.\n\nThe ult changes are absolutely fantastic on him, he loses about 2 damage per Q lategame from losing 225 mana, but the 75 movement speed boost is fantastic on him, even without multiplying that by MS quints and masteries. One of Ryze's biggest problems is getting his whole combo off on a target while staying in range, 2 seconds (now 1.8) of snare is usually enough if you stay in close/mid range but on any targets with mobility or tenacity he usually loses a lot of damage due to Ryze's lack of mobility steroid.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335451395", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

The best I could find is from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy), which claims that caloric estimates on food labels are based on an 85% efficiency, but there is no source or citation for that number.\n\nI can do real numbers for the heat loss. For a range of comfortable temperatures the amount of heat your body loses to the environment can be approximated by:\n\nQ = e x sigma x A x t x ( T1^4 - T0^4 )\n\nWhere Q is the amount of heat your body radiates, e is your emissivity (about 1), sigma is the Stephan-Boltzman constant (5.67e-8 W/m^2 /K^4 ), A is your surface area (about 1.8m^2), t is the amount of time in question (seconds), T1 is average temperature of the surface of your clothes (averaged over t, about 85F for light clothing), T0 is the average external temperature (avged over t).\n\nFirst for a climate where the average daily temperature your body comes into contact with is about 70F:\n\nQ = 1 x 5.67e-8 W/m^2 /K^4 x 1.8 m^2 x 86,400 seconds x (303K^4 - 294K^4 ) = 8.4 megajoules of energy\n\n8.4 megajoules of energy is about 2,000 Calories\n\nIn plain English this means that, if the average temperature your body sees is 70F, and the average surface temperature of your clothing is 85F, your body will radiate about 2000 Calories of energy to the environment (equivalent of about 100 Watts).\n\nNow lets take that person out of the 70F environment, and put them in a  68F environment.\n\nQ = 1 x 5.67e-8 W/m^2 /K^4 x 1.8 m^2 x 86,400 seconds x (303K^4 - 293K^4 ) = 9.3 megajoules of energy\n\n9.3 megajoules of energy is about 2,230 Calories\n\nWithin a narrow window of temperatures (about 65F to 75F) your body will radiate an extra 115 calories for every 1F drop in temperature. Below 65F and you'll probably wind up wearing heavier clothes (lowers T1) or holding your arms and legs closer to your body (lowers A).

{"body": "What you're looking for is something a little more up Machiavelli's alley. I like Robert Greene's \"33 Strategies of War\" and \"46 Laws of Power\".\n\nYou have to be very tricky with this. If you wish (or if this is important to you; it may not be) imagine that this is a sit-down and you two are mob bosses in front of your colleagues, or you are nobles at court. You must pick and choose your words obscenely carefully because you know that everyone's watching this go down and you don't want to appear weak in any way, shape, or form. This is going to get very melodramatic, very fast, but I'll try to keep it blunt.\n\nDo not lose control of your emotions. Ever. That will be your undoing. Don't get mad, don't get upset, don't get jealous, don't get ANYTHING. Stay calm. Shooting back a snide email full of barbs might make you FEEL like you've won the day, but you won't score any points across the board and you'll look like a reactionary hothead to anyone observing.\n\nIf you strike too early, you risk being labelled paranoid; if you strike too late you risk being ineffective. Strike too lightly and you're meek, too heavily and you're insane. Moderation in all things.\n\nFor now, it may be prudent to ignore it, and depending on how your superiors and the heavyweights in your workplace respond to it, she may be forced to withdraw if they defend you. This is the optimal outcome - least legwork, biggest message - but it is largely out of your hands (unless you're in good with the heavyweights and superiors, that is - hint). This is, at best, a child's attempt to shoot across your bow, and it will only hinder you as much as you let it. Threat assessment - is it a threat? How much of a threat is it? What, if anything, do I need to do to deal with it?\n\nIf nothing else, she's shown her hand - this may be the beginning of a run against your position. Try to look at it from her perspective - where are your workplace weaknesses, and what would she be likely to attempt to turn against you? This is where you come in - if you are a model employee (and I mean that) then you will be secure. Could not hurt to put in some extra hours now and again during heavy workloads or taking some initiative where others won't to look the part - but don't look reactionary. Approach with the attitude that you are doing this on your terms and not because you've been fingered, and find motivations that support the same. It could not hurt for idle chatter to help you as well - suggest to a trusted one that she may be jealous of something you have or stand to gain, and they will do the talking for you. It is one thing to have you blow your own horn and quite another to have someone else fanfare you - but ensure that this idea appears to have come from someone else (**I N C E P T I O N**) Check her motives.\n\nIf we say, however, that this were brought up in a face to face meeting of multiple people, then immediate response would be required. Give her the rope to hang herself with - ask her to lay out precisely how you are not being a team player, and then gently but undeniably prove her wrong. If she escalates rhetoric, don't bite, and if she gets hot under the collar, don't provoke and don't counter-fire, just sit back and watch her pull the lever on the gallows. You are not looking to win the argument, because if you've been securing your flanks by working hard, her very premise will appear shaky due to your reputation and evidence of your sweat in the workplace. You may either spring that at your leisure to catch her unawares or when your hand is forced by a more serious challenge (such as in a meeting).\n\nOr perhaps I've simply been reading too much George R.R.

{"body": "&gt;When has dynamic typing helped you?\n\nEvery time I didn't have to type out the name of the type of something.\n\nAlso, every time I realized that I don't actually care what something **is**, but what it **can do**. Which is constantly. When you have learned to program properly in Python, it will be constantly for you, too.\n\n&gt;What's the use case?\n\nHere's a trivial example:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; ' '.join(['foo', 'bar'])\n    'foobar'\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; ' '.join('foobar')\n    'f o o b a r'\n\nInternally, the implementation of `join` doesn't need to do any type checking to detect whether it's getting a list or a string. In fact, that would be very broken, since the way Python works, it automatically handles properly-created user-defined types for free, and trying to check types would break that. Instead, it simply attempts to use the object as if it implemented the iterator protocol (converting the `AttributeError` to a `TypeError` if the necessary methods aren't found).\n\nConceptually, anyway. The actual implementation may be optimized. But you, too, can write things that work this way.\n\n&gt;If you transitioned from a statically typed language to a dynamically typed language, how did your perspective change?\n\nIt takes a while to really \"get it\". There are certainly advantages to both ways. But programming is programming. Whatever type system you're given, don't fight it.\n\n&gt;How do big projects handle\n\nWith tests, which big projects in statically-typed languages need anyway. Type-checking only catches a fairly small class of errors.\n\n&gt;the fact that a mistake can change the type of an object\n\nThis is in fact wrong. You can bind a variable that referred to one type of object to another object of a different type, but the **objects** stay the same. Python's variables do not have type, but its values (objects) certainly do. You can, under very limited circumstances and with dark magic that really should never actually be used, change this type, but there is no plausible way that it could result from \"a mistake\".\n\nRegardless, you generally **don't care**. If you have a variable that holds a list of strings, and you replace it with a string (which is also iterable, producing 1-character strings - Python does not have a separate type for characters), chances are good that you know what you're doing, and it will work. If you replace it with an int, chances are good that it will be immediately obvious that you've done something wrong, because of context. You don't need to encode type names into variables (**please do not try**) to make it obvious what a variable \"should\" contain.

Thus each row i of A will have an entry for each point on the lattice, and each column j of A will have an entry for each point on the lattice.  The value at A[i, j] tells you the number of times each the process moves from point i to point j.  Self-transitions are allowed.\n\n3) Normalize the matrix by dividing each row i by the sum of the cells in the row.  Now, each elements A[i, j] gives you the probability of transitioning from i to j on the current step.  The sume of the row of the elements of row i will add to 1.0 since you have a 100% chance of either staying in state i or moving to another sate.\n\nYou can either analyze the transitions using the Markov Model or compute your equilibrium distribution P(x, y).\n\nTo compute your equilibrium distribution, you'll want to:\nCompute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the normalized matrix A.  The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 is your equilibrium distribution.

Not to mention the doubling of his AP ratio on his Q, he gets his Q off about 4 times during his whole combo:\n\n* Q W Q E Q R Q, That means from his Q alone he will deal about 1.6 AP to the enemy, this makes building a lategame Archangel much more potent on him and greatly outweighs the 30-40 lategame nerf to his Q damage.\n\n* The W CC reduction is a straight up nerf, but it's not very heavy and won't affect his overall balance very much.\n\nThe ult changes are absolutely fantastic on him, he loses about 2 damage per Q lategame from losing 225 mana, but the 55 movement speed boost is fantastic on him, even without multiplying that by MS quints and masteries. One of Ryze's biggest problems is getting his whole combo off on a target while staying in range, 2 seconds (now 1.8) of snare is usually enough if you stay in close/mid range but on any targets with mobility or tenacity he usually loses a lot of damage due to Ryze's lack of mobility steroid.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335623091", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Actually, I've submitted a different free monad module for the `transformers` package and I'm waiting for Ross to include it there before I release my next `pipes` version.  You can find the first draft of it [here](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library/blob/master/Control/Monad/Trans/Free.hs), although I'm about to update it to a second draft and split it into its own repository later today.\n\nThe new definition of the `Pipe` type based on that can be found [here](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library/blob/master/Control/Pipe/Common.hs).  Note that I actually use `FreeT` (a \"free monad transformer\") and not `Free` in order to obtain a correct `MonadTrans` instance.  If you want to learn more about this type, just read issue 19 of The Monad Reader which has a concurrency article by Mario Blazevic using this type to great effect, except he calls it `Coroutine`.  This changes the new `Pipe` type to run it through the base monad at each step instead of making the monad optional.\n\nI don't use the `free` package for two reasons:\n\n1.  It has an incorrect `MonadTrans` instance.  See [this ticket](https://github.com/ekmett/free/issues/3) for details.\n2.  The `mtl`-style works really really terrible with sum functors.  See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/sarkz/four_tips_for_new_haskell_programmers/c4cltmy) of mine where I mention this issue.  Actually, this is a pretty game-breaking issue not just for my library but for all free monad implementations since the overwhelming use case is sum functors like mine, which the `free` package crashes and burns on.\n\nBy `Cont`, I assume you mean something like:\n\n    newtype Pipe a b m r = Pipe { forall x. runPipe ::\n        (m (a -&gt; x) -&gt; x) -&gt; (m (b, x) -&gt; x) -&gt; (m r -&gt; x) -&gt; x }\n\n... which is just the Church encoding (i.e. continuation-passing style) of the new Pipe type.  I've heard people talk about the time complexity problems of free monads when not using continuation-passing style, but I don't actually observe this problem.  GHCi interprets the code with linear time complexity and when I compile my pipe programs they run within a few percentage points of their hand-rolled C counterparts, quite amazingly.  I think this is one of those cases where other implementations are prematurely optimizing without benchmarks to justify the optimization.\n\n`operational` and `Prompt` are basically the same thing (with `Prompt` being worse and providing some unnecessary extra complexity) and I don't use them as a matter of simplicity and taste.  I always like to ground my code in terms of category theory design patterns.  The free monad approach leads to much simpler and elegant code and doesn't require GADTs or universal quantification.  My general experience is that code written using category theory design patterns is always the \"best\" approach, for a very vague definition of \"best\".\n\nAlso, both of those libraries have broken `MonadTrans` instances that don't satisfy the monad transformer laws.  I place a strong premium on correctness and law-based type-classes.  Again, see my implementation for the correct way to define a monad transformer.  The only other library on Hackage that has this correct implementation is [`monad-coroutine`](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/monad-coroutine/0.7.1/doc/html/Control-Monad-Coroutine.html), which basically implements Mario Blazevic's article.  I didn't use that one because the library's scope is much narrower than the actual usefulness of the data type and I would like to standardize on a free monad transformer package that doesn't presume such a narrow use for it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335721196", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; As Ia B L A C K A M E R I C A N I find that insulting, disrespectful and asinine.\n\nYou also find my statements confusing since I never implied anything you said was racist. \n\nI was pretty explicitly clear. Systemic discrimination is systemic. You cannot escape systemic discrimination without changing the system that produces it. \n\n&gt; if you aren't aware of the salary for that position for men and women something is wrong.\n\nYou can be aware of what the average salary is for a position like yours, for men and for women, but not be aware of what employees for a specific company are being offered. If the women are offered toward the bottom and men toward the top and this schism is applied to across promotions, raises, and bonuses...it adds up. \n\nThis is _exactly_ what Lilly Ledbetter experienced. \n\nFurther, knowing your being offered subpar pay does not prevent anything. Demanding equal pay in a system with pervasive and ingrained discrimination results in *not being hired*.\n\nYou presume a level of rationality. But discrimination and racism are *inherently irrational*. \n\nIt's true that if enough people demand higher pay or refuse to give up their seats that over time they can change the system. Perhaps after a very long time. Perhaps 100's of years. Perhaps after great violence. Certainly after much unnecessary suffering. \n\nA law changes things immediate. Alleviates suffering today. It legitimizes the effort through social and legal recognition. It changes the system immediately.\n\n&gt; I enjoined your Progressive method of ignoring the fact that White House female staff are paid less than men, a fact that has been exposed in the MSM during the past 2 weeks.\n\nI'm not sure how I'm \"ignoring\" this. I'm _supporting_ a law that would empower women to address that inequality directly.\n\n\nI'll restate: your simplification of the issue and blaming of the victim shows a deep ignorance of these facts. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335723476", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As an example, let's look at Archie's [Magic is Timeless](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XioG98vFgs), since it's both a good demonstration and what I'm listening to at the moment.  Here's the section breakdown that I came up with:\n\nIntro: 0:00 to 0:45  \nBuildup: 0:45 to 1:15  \nVerse: 1:15 to 1:30  \nChorus: 1:30 to 2:15  \nVerse: 2:15 to 2:45  \nBridge: 2:45 to 3:15  \nVerse: 3:15 to 3:30  \nChorus: 3:30 to 4:10ish  \nOutro: 4:15 to 5:16  \n\nThe verses and choruses share a melody line, so they sound similar, but the choruses are punchier and more exciting, so I made the distinction.  The Buildup is a new phase, but it can be considered to be part of the Intro.\n\nThe first thing that jumps out at us is that all the sections are multiples of 15 seconds long.  The song is roughly 128 bpm, so 15 seconds of music equals 32 beats equals 8 bars of 4/4 time.  8 bars is exactly twice the length of the melody line we hear at 1:15.  We can think of every fifteen seconds as one 'chunk' of song.  \n  \nSo we see the structure of the song is based around that melody chunk.  The verses loop it once or twice, then they pass it off to a chorus to loop it three times.  That's a lot of looping.  We can see that the melody is repeated no less than 13 times (including one in the buildup).  The song stops this from being boring by making sure that each section does something different to it.  The verses are pretty straightforward, they just accompany the melody with a good beat.  The choruses add more instruments, occasional breaks and glitching, and a bigger sound.  The verses do mostly the same thing as each other, as do the choruses, but by intermixing the verses and the choruses, you can keep the listener engaged.  The song is mostly this same melody repeated over and over, but by switching up the context surrounding it, it stays interesting.  It's like viewing the same object at different angles, or under different light.\n\nNow let's look at the melody itself.  It follows a pretty classic pattern.  It's four bars long, but it really consists of a one bar idea that is modified slightly throughout the melody.  We have variation A, which starts it, then we hear variation B which ends on a high note.  B leads into another iteration of A, which finally ends in variation C.  C ends on the root note of the song's key, which provides closure to the melody line.  This A B A C pattern is used everywhere in music, and is a great, easy way to make melodies.\n\nAnd that's pretty much all there is to this song.  Try to do this to songs you listen to.  Break them down into their different parts and see what makes them tick.  Then you'll be able to use that information in your own stuff.  Listening, really listening, is the single most important thing you can do as a composer.  You can't make great music until you understand how great music works.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335758926", "subreddit": "MLPtunes", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes this is true but each chord in a major key has a different quality denoted by uppercase (Major) and lowercase (Minor) roman numerals. For C major the example above you would get I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi (This is also your relative minor key), vii (This one is a diminished triad) and back to, I. There are 12 notes in the musical alphabet.  The major scale is creating by utilizing a pattern comprised of whole steps and half steps that is applied over the musical alphabet. This pattern is (Root-Whole-W-Half-W-W-W-H. In the case of C major (C D E F G A B C). You triads are then comprised as was stated above. C major= 1,3,5 D minor=2,4,6 Em= 3,5,7 etc, in relation to the notes in the major scale. \n\nAlso a mentioned above the distance between the Root note of the chord and the 3rd of the chord determines the quality of the triad.  2 wholes steps=Major 1 and a half steps=Minor AKA a \"flat\" third. If you have a flat third and a flat 5th as the B chord is in scale of C major the quality becomes diminished. B-D=1 and 1/2 steps, D-F=1 and 1/2 steps.\nGod this is so much easier to explain in person...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335808415", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
