{"body": "I see. I think that makes sense now. So let's say Tok'ra home world address is : A B C D E F with G as Earth symbol (sun over pyramid). Then what you're saying is G is not found on any other DHD but you'll find A B C D E F symbols on every DHD (upto 39 symbols). \n\nTo dial Tok'ra from Earth, G is used. To dial Earth from Tok'ra some other unique symbol (say Z) is used for Tok'ra and which is only present on the Tok'ra DHD. So, in effect, you cannot just move a DHD from one planet to the other then as it would then not work since it presumably has been calibrated and built just for that planet alone. \n\nSo it really is 39 combination C(39,6) i.e. 6 non-repeating symbols from 39 symbols which is now 39!/33!*6! = 3,262,623  potential 6-symbol addresses. The 7th is fixed as only one symbol always attached at the end of this 6-symbol combo for every planet. So every planet can only visit about 3.2 million stargates in the same galaxy. \n\nWith 7-symbol addresses it would be C(39,7) which is 15,380,937 stargates which is when you add the extra power with a ZPM to traverse to a different galaxy. \n\nSince now we don't know the pool of the 7th symbol addresses which are unique to every planet and is the 40th symbol on the DHD, how do we calculate the actual number of stargates? \n\nI am curious as to how you arrived at the 1.9 billion number?\n\n\n----------\n-- All Combination math courtesy of Wolfram Alpha for those speedy calculations", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335833934", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

P., comp. et dediee a son Altesse Monseign. le Prince de Lichnowsky, par Louis van Beethoven. Oeuv. 13. a Vienne chez Hofmeister. (1 Thl. 8 gr.)\n&gt;\n&gt;Not without justification, this well-written sonata is called 'pathetique', since it certainly has a passionate character.  In the A-flat Major Adagio that should never be played in a dragging style and that is filled with beautifully-flowing melodiousness but also with modulation and good movement, the soul is wrapped in calm and comfort, out of which, however, it is re-awakened, and that in the dual meaning of the word, by the Rondo's first Allegro note, so that the main feeling on which the sonata is based is carried through, which gives it (the sonata) unity and inner life, thus, real aesthetic value.  If one can say something like this of a sonata--provided, as is the case here, that every other requirement of musical art has not remained un-fulfilled--is, obviously, a proof of its beauty.  The only thing that the reviewer would remark of a B e e t h o v e n  who can certainly be inventive, himself and bring something new if he wants, is, although it is not meant as a criticism, but rather only as a wish for more perfection, would be that the theme of the Rondo has too much of a reminiscence in it.  Of what?  The reviewer can not determine that, himself, but the idea is at least not new.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Viennese public that, as is known, shows much enthusiasm for music and that also warmly supports it, must, indeed, be pleased with the fact that it can call many  excellent artists their own, to which, undoubtedly, Herr van Beethoven belongs of whom we hope that he will enrich us with many more products of his genius and diligence.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Since this sonata had already been well-received in Leipzig in 1800, Thayer's quote of the report by Ignaz Moscheles is also not surprising:  \n&gt;\n&gt;\" .  .   .  I had been placed under the guidance and tuition of Dionysius Weber, the founder and present director of the Prague Musical Conservatory; and he, fearing that, in my eagerness to read new music, I might injure the systematic development of my pianoforte playing, prohibited the library; and, in a plan for my musical education which he laid before my parents, made it an express condition, that for three years I should study no other authors but Mozart, Clementi, and S. Bach.  I must confess, however, that, in spite of such prohibitions, I visited the library, gaining access to it through my pocket-money.  It was about this time that I learnt from some school-fellows that a young composer had appeared in Vienna, who wrote the oddest stuff possible--such as no one could either play or understand; crazy music, in opposition to all rule; and that this composer's name was Beethoven.  On repairing to the library to satisfy my curiosity as to this so-called eccentric genius, I found there Beethoven's Sonata pathetique.  This was in the year 1804.  My pocket-money would not suffice for the purchase of it, so I secretly copied it.  The novelty of its style was so attractive to me, and I became so enthusiastic in my admiration of it, that I forgot myself so far as to mention my new acquisition to my master, who reminded me of his injunction, and warned me not to play or study any eccentric productions until I had based y style upon more solid models.  Without, however, minding his injunctions, I seized upon the pianoforte works of Beethoven as they successively appeared, and in them found a solace and a delight such as no other composer afforded me\" (Thayer: 242-243). \n&gt;", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336305781", "subreddit": "classicalmusic", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I'm a poor college student\n\nTake a theory course.  Go to your school's library, especially if it has a music library, and check out theory books.  But seriously, next semester, sign up for a theory course and you'll get much more out of it than you would a book or website.  The nice thing about being in college is that there are college classes to take. ;p\n\nOn to your questions!\n\n1. Look up the Circle of Fifths.  By the way, traditional music theory won't do anything for you with most of these questions; they come from experience.  So if you learn traditional theory, you'll know where the holes are and have a much better understanding of how to fill them, but you'll have to fill them yourself.  Anyway: the circle of fifths arranges all 12 keys in a circle, going up in fourths or fifths.  When you have chords following that pattern, a few things happen.  First, whatever the pattern is, it becomes recognizable, so it sounds good just because it's a pattern.  This is known as a sequence.  In this case, you're going up a fifth, down a fourth, up a fifth, down a fourth, or something similar (because if you're just going up a fifth, up a fifth, up a fifth, up a fifth, it won't sound as good).  Just a sequence.  Second, if the roots of the chords are close in the Circle of Fifths, they sound related.  Third, the IV-I -- root motion down a fourth/up a fifth -- is known as the plagal cadence, aka the \"amen\" cadence, and feels kind of... relaxing.  You basically have three of them in a row, though the middle one is more of a breaking point between the other two.  Fourth, and most importantly, each note has a tendency in a chord, a direction in which it wants to go to resolve.  When you set up major 7th chords like that, you satisfy some of these tendencies and frustrate others, and it's this *melodic* activity that makes the chord progression sound smooth and nice.  Honestly, whether the notes are in a particular scale almost doesn't matter.  Yeah, you get a little disoriented if you put in too much stuff not in the scale, but it still sounds pretty, and it sounds good again when you get back to the original key.\n\n2. Whenever the fuck you want.  Each note has a function -- a tendency, or several -- within a key.  They usually have names, but whatever.  The #4 usually wants to resolve to 5, and the b5 usually wants to resolve to 4, for example.  Neither the #4 nor the b5 are in the major scale.  In fact, they're the same note.  Confused yet? (:  When you're in a key, say C major, your song gets a certain feeling from being in major, but there's no reason you can't alter that feeling by using notes and chords from other keys.  The minor iv is a nice chord to use in major; if you're in C major, this would be the F minor.  Adding a #11 (same as #4) to a major chord is usually really, really pretty.  Adding a 6 to a minor chord is also nice.  There are some out-of-the-key chords that are traditionally used, too; one of them is the augmented 6th chord.  Without getting into the details (look this up if you want), in C major or minor, the augmented 6th chord is Ab7 or Ab7(b5), and it usually resolves to the G major or G7.  In minor, by the way, it's *customary* to \"break the rule\" and use major V chords instead of minor v chords.  A secondary dominant is the V chord of some other chord, so if you're in C major, the V is the G major, so its secondary dominant is D or D7.  Not in the key, but it still plays nice, so long as it's resolving to the G or G7.  Basically, just because you're in one key doesn't mean you can't use whatever you want from any other key.\n\n3. A key is a convenient way to specify which notes get played and which note is the \"home note\", the tonic.  That's it.  C major means that you're going to use mostly C D E F G A B, and you're going to focus on the C.  G phrygian means that you're going to use mostly G Ab Bb C D Eb F, and you're going to focus on the G.  The scale refers to the actual notes.  So a C major scale is the notes C D E F G A B C, and when you're in the key of C major, you're mostly using the notes from the C major scale *and focusing on the C*.  It's possible to write music that uses only the C major scale and doesn't focus on any particular note, and that wouldn't be in the key of C.  This is known as pandiatonic music (look it up).  Now, there are a LOT of different types of scales and modes.  The biggest ones are major and minor (in minor, you flat the 7, 3, and 6 of the scale, though you usually raise the 7 back in chords -- the harmonic minor scale -- and raise the 6 and 7 when going *up* in the melody -- the melodic minor scale), but there are a bunch of others.  If you take a scale and use those same notes but focus on a different note, that's called a mode of that scale.  For example, C major is C D E F G A B.  If you decide to focus on D, you have D E F G A B C, but instead of C major, you have D dorian.  The dorian scale is therefore the second mode of the major scale, since it's the major scale but starting on the second note.  If you can figure out the important chords in each mode, you can make good music in it; for D dorian, the main chords are D minor, obviously, and G *major* and A minor, the IV and v.  When you're writing in a scale other than major or minor, you should try to stay in the mode most of the time and not use other notes, because other notes might ruin your mode's feeling if you use them too much.  A song written in dorian mode, for instance, is Scarborough Fair.\n\n4. I don't listen to those groups, sorry, but the way they do it is by throwing out traditional harmony and forging their own rules. (:  Of course, to do that, you need to know the rules in the first place.  The Radiohead guys at least are geniuses, and they come up with really creative harmonies and patterns.  The more traditional theory you know, the more you can extrapolate it and figure out how to make new things.  If you want to write like Radiohead, what you *need* to do is listen to their music and transcribe the important bits, like the chords and melody.  Figure out what chords they use, and then analyze them to figure out what makes those chords sound good together.\n\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336332174", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're right a picture would be nice.  Maybe it'll happen.  There are a couple of different pictures online, google image search it, it'll give you the gist but not necessarily the 'trick' I'm using.\n\nWell, since a more dorfy picture may be a long time coming, here's a ghetto side view of the 'trick'.\n\n             X\n             X           ______7777_\n    _ ___ ___X__ ___ ___/      ████\n     V   V      V   V          ████\n\n    Eventual spaces for       Piston\n    Magma shops here        (just dropped)\n\n\nThe piston has just been dropped, raising magma to 7's just above the piston.  It flows down to the magma shop floor and fills in the channels.  Since I've got 4 channels there - I don't think the 4 tiles of 7 will be enough.  You'll have to imagine with a bit of dorfy imagination.\n\nAs to why so many shops?  Well, a little bit science.  I wanted to try to figure out how much magma for how many shops.  And well, [I've been known to do a bit of farming on occasion](www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/ohgyp/adventures_in_metal_farming_part_3d_the_d_stands/) and moar shops = moar farming.\n\nSo your question/perpective is actually quite instructive.  'Coco wants 30 shops?  Bleh.  I need maybe 10, what use is all that crap?'\n\nHere's the takeaway - let's say you run with 10 shops.  How big of a piston will you need?\n\nUsing my numbers and guessing a bit... let's assume the goal is 10 shops, reasonably well spaced with a transit of 25ish tiles.  \n\nOk, let's try it.  Will a 2x2x2z piston be enough?  Clicky clicky.. carry the one... a 2x2x2z piston with 25 tile transit is enough for...\n\n(25 + 2 x 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3.5S) * 1.6 + 7S = 2 x 2 x 2 x 7\n\n=&gt; (37 + 3.5S) * 1.6 + 7S = 56\n\nTotal shops supported by a 2x2x2Z piston with transit is... -0.25.  Well, that doesn't work.  \n\n(What does this mean?  This config loses too much magma due to transit flow and the footprint of the piston, not leaving enough for even a single shop.  Footprint loses about 17ish (12 x 1.6) units, transit loses another 40ish (25 x 1.6)... and that's all the magma available. None left for any shops.)\n\nLet's try a flip.  Presume equal width and height for the piston, let's keep it simple for now.  And presume a 2z drop, cuz, random pick.  What size should the piston be?\n\nLet D = the horizontal size of the piston.  So piston is D x D x 2z.\n\nTransit cost + shop cost = total magma displaced.\n\n=&gt; (25 + D x D + 4D + 3.5(10)) * 1.6 + 7(10) = D x D x 2 x 7\n\n=&gt; 1.6D^2 + 6.4D + 166 = 14D^2\n\n=&gt; 12.4D^2 - 6.4D - 166 = 0\n\nAnd something something quadratic... D = 4.\n\nIf you want 10 shops and your piston is about 25 tiles from your shops and it's a 2z drop... you need a 4x4 piston.\n\nIf not a 4x4x2z, 3x3x3z will probably also work.  About the same yield of magma pistoned, 3x3 has a smaller footprint so less loss there.  A 2x2 would need...  7zs to work.\n\nOf course, I make no guarantees.  I am a dorfy engineer but I am not your dorfy engineer.  It's a bit imprecise.  That 1.6 is a fudge.\n\nBut hey, dorf maff gave an answer.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI've gone all nerd.  I'm entertained by the fact I've reduced pistons to a quadratic equation.  It's actually quite hilarious.\n\nLet's bring it back to normality (and check my results while we're at it)\n\nOk, you want 10 shops.  \n\nI'm going to switch units to something I'll call 'blocks' of magma, it's probably easier to think in this unit, it's the way I initially approached it.  \n\nAnyways, a block is a single tile of 7/7 magma.  Think of it as a nice 'box' of magma or whatever. \n\nConsider the 3x3x3z piston.  When pistoned - this yields 27 blocks of magma.  Ok, that's straight forward.\n\nSince you want 10 shops that eats up 10 blocks of magma right there.  Ok.\n\nAlso remember that the footprint of the piston (and the catchment bridges) will end up eating some magma.  It'll be about 3 blocks.  Ok.  \n\nAlso remember that I used 'transit' - the tiles from the piston to your shops.  25.  So let's say that eats up 5ish blocks.  Lastly, remember that between each shop is a bit of tileage... so maybe 0.7 blocks per shop.\n\nOk, so that's 10 (shops) + 3 (piston footprint) + 5 (transit loses from piston to shop) + 10 x 0.7 (transit loses between shops)... that adds up to... 25 blocks.  Which is just a bit less than 27 - which is the piston yield.\n\nCool.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336443889", "subreddit": "dwarffortress", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This will be a bit redundant with what others have replied with, but I'm sure it will be helpful to see recurring ideas in responses to be sure of your info.\n\n1) For farming jungle, you just have to grab the biggest creep from a medium or hard camp, but for ganking, you want to stick to Ursa, Satyr, and the two you mentioned. Wildkin and Wolf can help push, but really can't lock anyone down. (Also, if you ever get the chance to have 3 Wildkins at once, three tornadoes stacked on top of one another can catch your opponents hilariously off guard)\n\n2) It really depends on the pace of the game. To be honest, you should be trying to push base much sooner than what most would classify as \"late game\", but there are compositions where turtle strategies would be more beneficial. If you find you're up against that annoying aoe teamfight hero or two that keep on melting your creeps before they get a chance to do anything, it might be a better idea to keep them out on the sidelines of the fight until that hero is disabled/neutralized, so they can be used to push/cast cleanup disables after-the-fact (also consider picking up a Necronomicon to further punish this aoe hero's behavior). Pick up replacement creeps when you can, often I only have time to grab one creep before running back into the fight, and if it's a 'teleport in or lose your carry' situation, sometimes you have to go without even one. It's a judgement call, but we've all been in that situation where it feels like there's no point to picking up creeps only to have them all killed over and over again, you just have to be careful how you use them.\n\n3) Centaur stun and Ursa stomp are the more difficult neutral abilities to master, but can be the most rewarding. One simpler technique is when you're ganking behind trees (as you don't stand a chance of initiating with these 2 without a positioning advantage), right click all units you control onto the target, slow them if you can, and then individually control the centaur or ursa in the direction you expect the enemy wants to escape to. Instead of moving in diagonally, the vector of this micro is generally perpendicular to their escape route. This forces them to try to tp out of outpost or attempt to slip past your creep. This is a technique called area denial. The other option is a bit more complex, in that you have to micro completely different movements. This alternative involves you (and any extra creeps you have) ganking from one direction, while your centaur/ursa moves in from behind them. Your presence right next to them in lane, forces them back right into the open arms of your neutral, alowing you to land all of your creep abilities and hopefully net a kill. This is particularly fun to do against blink heroes if they panic back before they notice your surprise. Again, it's more complicated, but can yield effective results.\n\n4) As thefarkinator noted, the most common option involves getting 2 points in Test of Faith by level 3 and 3 points in Holy Persuasion by level 5, by going E W W E E R. There are some cases where Penitence is preferable, but at low ranks, it's hardly worth the mana and the pure damage provides a lot of potential. As for creep combos, you're going to want something that sets up the gank (like a troll or kobold taskmaster aura) to get your ursas and centaurs in position to reek havoc. For pushing, ideally you're looking at Wildkin and Satyr for creep clearing and powerful auras and perhaps a Troll for the tower-tanking summons.\n\n5) The choices you mentioned are definitely effective, but there are a couple others I would keep in mind. Ring of Basillius for pushing power and some mana, Smoke of Deceit for ganks past warded areas, and of course making sure your team has flying courier and wards/sentries as needed (seeing as chen is probably the least item reliant hero in the game. Also, Necronomicon is fun for the aura and the anti-aoe pure damage on death.) In addition, Sheepstick is luxuriously potent for shutting down carries, or you can opt for ghost scepter or eul's if that route is too expensive. \n\n6) Really, the key to Chen is aggressive early game play and selflessness. I'd trade my Chen's life to feed a carry a kill any day of the week (assuming I'm not feeding first blood and my carry isn't a moronic pub) Ganking at level 1 after killing a single camp is standard practice for me, and I don't let up. Buy smoke if they ward against you and try to find creeps that can transition into a fast tier 1 tower kill when you do push someone off of the lane, through kill or otherwise. Last thing I'll mention is the significance of hotkeys. You have to have a hotkey for your group as a whole, as well as each creep individually. For blocking, for casting, for playing Chen, it's just an essential.\n\nHopefully this info provided you some help in learning one of the most overpowered heroes in the game :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336444932", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1.) Well for ganking Trolls (if enemy has blink), Centaur/Ursa is better when the enemy has no blink. The hellscaller guy with his shockwave is great in numbers, if you have 3 of them you can spam 18 of this schockwaves out and wipe creepwaves out very fast. Wildkin is best to push the tower(highest armor) and gives a lot of lane control in early game, since the tornado does a lot of damage and can be controlled. It is really annoying to deal with a wildkin on the other side of the tree thats just channeling the tornado right in your lane. So now you might think that were all creeps, but you forget the Wolf and the other Satyr. The wolf is very important late game, it is the fasted mob and provides a +15% damage aura. Since your creeps normally die fast in late game you can use the wolf and just place it outside of the fight and it will still push your teams damage insanely.The Satyr on the other hand can be used early game to burn about 400 Mana with his manabur. Which is really annoying for some heros, just imagine if you burn all the mana from windrunner on a solo suicide lane. She basically has to hug the tower all the time, while not being able to spam the Arrow for some Creepkills. \nEdit: Almost forgot the Ogre Magi, he gives a 8 Frostarmor, which is also very good in late game or early game, since lichs frostarmor has 10/12 (on level 3/4). \n\n2.) Depends on the situation generally speaking they are worth shit in late game, but as I pointed out a wolf helps a great deal and since sometimes the creeps are getting ignored you should try to get your 3 Creeps up unless a Teamfight or Gank is possible. If the enemy team just melts your creeps you could use them to push other lanes while you push with your team. You just need to Attack move in lane direction and it should be fine.\n\n3.) Generally speaking you always want the creep in front of you and you want to initiate from behind. Normally your lane will slow/stun the enemy hero while you walk up from behind and they basically run right into you. Getting a stun off then is so easy, after that you should bodyblock with your creep as good as you can. Coordinating as a team is essential, also try to wait for a possible gank in areas where you are just out of vision.\n\n4.) Pros go E W W E E R E W W Q R Q Q Q...\nIt depends on the situation for Chen beginners Penance is most of the time better, but it kinda depends on the situation and your playstyle. I personally never liked it. Many guides point out that the pros go Test of Faith, because they know that they can relay on their teammates to get the slow/stuns for a gank so they rather have an additional burst. Just go to playdota.com and read that chen guide (there is only one) it is time worth spending.\n\n5.) That's also my standard build, sometimes Drums or Vlad are a nice addition if you dont think you can get your scepter up or need more pushing power.\n\n6.) Read the Chen Guide on Playdota.com also LuminousInverse released a video today how to play a jungling enchantress in Pro Matches and it is really good. Since the pros really show how far you can go and Ench isn't all that diffrent from Chen. \n\nIll provide the link to youtube when I am home...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336464206", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Disclaimer: Let me start this post by noting that the probabilities I am about to discuss are negligible with regards to your standard Texas holdem poker hand.\n\n&gt;The fact that someone on your right folds crap doesn't affect the probability that someone on your left has AA.\n\nNot completely true I'm afraid.  If each person were rolling a die to decide their hand strength that would be true, but that's not the same with a pack of cards.  The deck does have memory with regards to the person to your right's hand.\n\nTo illustrate this further, let us assume there is a seven card deck, with the following cards: A K Q J T 9 8\n\nLet us assume people follow a certain pattern when it comes to opening a hand: if I have an ace, I will open, if not I will fold.\n\nYou are in the middle of three people dealt two cards each, and you are dealt QJ.  The first person to act folds.\n\nNow hopefully this becomes clear: Before the person to your right folded, you did not have any information on what order the other 5 cards were (two in each of their hands, one left in the deck).  That meant the person to your left had a 2/5 (40%) chance of having the ace.  But now you know that the first person did not have the ace.  The person to your left's chance of having the ace just improved to 2/3 (67%).\n\nThe same logic applies to a much lesser extent in a poker hand.  Let's assume we have a really fishy table where anyone opens any Ax hand from any position.  You are in the SB with QJ in a 10 player hand.  It folds around to you.  So now, the odds of the BB having an ace are not 15.5% but actually 22.5%.\n\nThose percentages were calculated as follows:\n\nP(Player to act has an ace | my two cards are not ace) = 1 - [P(Random card is not an ace) * P(Next random card is not an ace)] = 1 - (46/50 * 45/49) = 15.5%\n\nP(Player to act has an ace | my two cards and eight other players' cards are not an ace) = 1 - [P(Random card is not an ace) * P(Next random card is not an ace)] = 1 - (30/34 * 29/33) = 22.5%\n\nObviously when you consider that players in early position are likely to fold weak aces the effect on the probabilities is a lot smaller, probably insignificant, but as long as you accept that in general higher cards are more likely to be played from early position, I'm afraid you cannot deny that at some level, lots of players having folded does increase the odds of players still to act having strong hands (hands with higher cards).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336572275", "subreddit": "poker", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Perhaps this will clear things up. Here an explanation of existentialism in regard to this issue.\n\nSuppose we begin by endorsing or at any rate not contesting the view that\nobjects have individual essences. An individual essence E of an object x is a\nproperty that meets two conditions: (1) E is essential to x, so that it is n o t\npossible that x exist but lack E, and (2) E is essentially unique to x, so that\nit is not possible that there should have been an object distinct from x that\nhad E. I believe it is obvious that there are individual essences. Consider,\nfor example, the property of being William F. Buckley or being identical\nwith William F. Buckley. Surely that property is essential to Buckley; he\ncouldn't have existed but lacked it. (Of course he could have lacked the\nname William F. Buckley'; no doubt his parents could have named him Pico\ndella Mirandoia' if they'd wished.) But the property in question is also\nessentially unique to him; it is not possible that someone distinct from Buck-\nley should have had the property of being identical with William F. Buckley.\nOne kind of essence, then, is the property of being identical with some\nobject - i.e. the property, for some object x, of being identical with x.\nFollowing Robert Adams and Duns Scotus, suppose we call such a property\na thisness; the thisness of an individual is the property of being that individual.\nIt is not necessary that we use proper names to specify or refer to thisnesses;\nwhen I use the words \"the property of being I\" or \"the property of being\nidentical with me\", the property they denote is a thisness. And consider the\nmeanest man in North Dakota: the property of being identical with h i m is\nalso a thisness.\n\n\nSo objects have thisnesses and thisnesses are essences. One existentialist\nthesis - a thesis endorsed by Arthur Prior, Robert Adams, Kit Fine and\nothers - canbe stated as follows: thisnesses are ontologically dependent\nupon their exemplifications. Take any thisness t and the object x of which t\nis the thisness; t could not have existed if x had not. If Buckley had not\nexisted, then his thisness would not have existed. Every thisness has essential-\nly the property of being exemplified by the object that does in fact exemplify\nit. More exactly, the thesis in question is that it is necessary that every this-\nness has that property; it is not as if there could have been thisnesses that\ncould have lacked th e property in question.\nThis existentialist thesis can be extended. Let's say that a property is\nquidditative if it is either a thisness or involves a thisness in a certain way. Wecould try to spell out the way in question in formal and recusive detail; but\ninstead let me just give some examples. Being identical with Nero or being\nNero is a quidditative property; but so are being more blood-thirsty than\n\nNero, being either Nero or Cicero, being either Nero or wise, being possibly\nwiser than Nero, being believed by Nero to be treacherous, and being such\nthat there is someone more bloodthirsty than Nero. We may contrast the\nnotion of a quidditative property with that of a qualitative property. Again, I\nshall not try to give a definition of this notion;but examples would be being\nwise, being 14 years old, being angry, being learned, being six feet from a\ndesk, and the like. If P and Q are qualitative properties, then so is their con-\njunction, their disjunction, the complement of each, being such that there is\nsomething that hasP, and possibly having P. And the more general existentialist\nthesis is that while qualitative properties may be necessary beings and exist in\nevery possible world, quidditative properties are ontologically dependent\nupon the objects whose thisnesses they involve. Of course the thisness of a\nnecessary being - God, perhaps, or to use a theologically less dramatic\nexample, the number s e v e n - exists necessarily, just as does the object of\nwhich it is a thisness; and the same goes for any quidditative property that\ninvolves only thisnesses of necessary beings. But such a quidditative property\nas being wiser than Buckley could not have existed if he had not.\nThe first existentialist thesis, therefore, is that quidditative properties are\nontologically dependent upon,the individuals whose thisnesses they involve.\nAnd a second existentialist thesis is like unto the first. Consider the proposi-\ntions\n\n\n(1) William F. Buckley is wise\n\n\n(2) The Lion of Conservativism is wise.\n\nThe first, we might think, involves Buckley in a more direct and intimate way\nthan does the second. The second refers to him, so to say, only accidentally -\nonly by virtue of the fact that he happens to be the Lion of Conservativism.\n(1), on the other hand, makes a direct reference to him, or to use Arthur\nPrior's term, is \"directly about ' ' I him. Now it is not easy to say just what\ndirect aboutness is or when a proposition is directly about an object; and for\nour purposes it isn't crucially important. Instead of trying to explain that\nnotion, I shall say that a proposition directly about some object is a singular\nproposition and give some examples: Buckley is wise, either Buckley is wise\nor 2 + 1 = 3, possibly Buckley is wise, it's not the case that Buckley is wise,\nsomeone is wiser than Buckley, Sam believes that Buckley is wise and possibly\nBuckley does not exist are all singular propositions. If we think of proposi-\ntions as having constituents, we may think of a singular proposition as one\nthat has either at least one individual or at least one quidditative property as\na constituent. And the second existentialist thesis - accepted again by\nAdams, Fine, Prior and others - is this: a singular proposition is ontologicaUy\ndependent upon the individuals it is directly about. So if Buckley had not\nexisted, then, on this view, none of the above propositions would have so\nmuch as seen the light of day.\n\nExistentialism, therefore, is the claim that quidditative properties and\nsingular propositions are ontologically dependent upon the individuals they involve. - On Existentialism by Alvin Plantinga\n\nWould you agree with the characterization given?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336614912", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Why wouldn't they use the flag? If there was a game made about Nikolai Orelev, the Russian Assassin who was embroiled in the Bolshevik Revolution, killing a bunch of imperial soldiers and prominently featuring the Soviet flag would you have assumed the game would be Leninist propaganda?\n\nAnd the trailer never claimed that Americans were \"truly\" free. Where'd you get that from? I think it's quite obvious he's talking about the Assassin's Creed. \"Nothing is true, everything is permitted.\" Freedom.\n\nAnd as I said, perhaps it featured him killing a bunch of redcoats because they're were well-trained career soldiers. If you want your character to feel like a badass you don't show him killing militiamen.\n\nIf you're going to complain about this then complain about how the first Assassin's Creed could be perceived as by far the most biased.

{"body": "Next we have our second GADT, `Context`.  It doesn't use any language features we haven't already seen, but one still might be confused as to its purpose.  Why have a whole separate type for incomplete trees?\n\n    -- one-hole context for red-black trees\n    data Context :: Nat -&gt; RedBlack -&gt; Nat -&gt; * -&gt; *  where \n      -- if we're at the root, the hole is a black node\n      Root :: Context n Black n a\n      -- we can go left or right from a red node hole, creating a hole for a black node\n      BC   :: Bool -&gt; a -&gt; Node Black n a -&gt; Context m Red n a          -&gt; Context m Black n a\n      -- we can go left or right from a black node hole, creating a hole for either\n      EC   :: Bool -&gt; a -&gt; Node cY n a    -&gt; Context m Black (Succ n) a -&gt; Context m cX n a\n    deriving instance Show a =&gt; Show (Context m c n a)\n\n(Some example values, for playing around in ghci)\n\n    a =  B Leaf 'a' Leaf\n    b = B a 'b' a\n    c = EC True 'c' a Root\n    z :: Zipper ('Succ ('Succ One)) Char\n    z = Zipper a c\n\nThe key use of a `Context` is as part of a `Zipper`.  If you're unfamiliar with [zippers](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Zipper), they're a technique for efficiently editing functional data structures.  By keeping track of the path we used to traverse down a `RedBlackTree` to get to a particular `Node` (using a `Context`) we can view and modify the value at that `Node`, and then rebuild a new `RedBlackTree` using the `Context`.\n\nThink of a `Context m c n a` as a `RedBlackTree a` (rooted at a `Node Black m a`) with a hole in it where a `Node c n a` should go.  The `Zipper`, then stores the tree-with-a-hole and a proposed value to fill that hole.  So the constructors for `Context` are designed to maintain the same constraints as for `Node`.  The `BC` constructor creates a partial `Red` node to fill a `Context m Red n a` giving a value and one of the child - all that is missing is another `Black` node for the other child (`BC` for \"black color\").  Similarly, the `EC` constructor creates a partial `Black` node to fill a `Context m Black (Succ n) a` - all that's missing is the other child, which may be of either color (`EC` for \"either color\").  This counts as one of the `Black` nodes between the root and the leaves, so any value that fills that hole must have one less `Black` node on each of its paths to the leaves.\n\n    data Zipper m a = forall c n. Zipper (Node c n a) (Context m c n a)\n    deriving instance Show a =&gt; Show (Zipper m a)\n\nNote how `Zipper` uses existential quantification to eliminate the color `c` and the black node count `n`. They're bound to be the same for the `Node` and the `Context`, but this allows a value of `Zipper m a` can be any point under a tree rooted at a `Node Black m a` - we don't want to limit it to being for a particular hole type.\n\nCreating a `Zipper n a` from a `Node Black n a` is easy - we just use the given node as the proposed fill and record that we're at the root of the tree.\n\n    -- create a zipper\n    unZip :: Node Black n a -&gt; Zipper n a\n    unZip = flip Zipper Root\n\nRestoring a `Zipper m a` to a `Node Black m a` just requires replaying our history, fitting in the given `Node` into the `Context`\nto get a new `Node` and `Context` until we get to the root of the tree.\n\n    -- destroy a zipper\n    zipUp :: Zipper m a -&gt; Node Black m a\n    zipUp (Zipper x Root) = x\n    zipUp (Zipper x (BC goLeft a y c)) = zipUp $ Zipper (if goLeft then R x a y else R y a x) c\n    zipUp (Zipper x (EC goLeft a y c)) = zipUp $ Zipper (if goLeft then B x a y else B y a x) c\n\nNow we finally get to some code that uses our `RedBlackTree` as a [binary search tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree).\nFor each value `a`, there's exactly one position in a tree that will hold `a`.  If `a` is currently in the tree, this will be an interior `Node` (using the `R` or `B` constructor).  If not, this will be a `Leaf` node.\n\nSince this has us traverse through the tree, we use a `Zipper`, so that once we find this location, we can modify the tree to either insert or delete the given value.  It's `zipTo`'s job to create the `Context` chains `zipUp` consumes.\n\n    -- locate the node that should contain a in the red-black tree\n    zipTo :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; Zipper n a -&gt; Zipper n a\n    zipTo _ z@(Zipper Leaf _) = z\n    zipTo a z@(Zipper (R l a' r) c) = case compare a a' of\n      EQ -&gt; z\n      LT -&gt; zipTo a $ Zipper l (BC True a' r c)\n      GT -&gt; zipTo a $ Zipper r (BC False a' l c)\n    zipTo a z@(Zipper (B l a' r) c) = case compare a a' of\n      EQ -&gt; z\n      LT -&gt; zipTo a $ Zipper l (EC True a' r c)\n      GT -&gt; zipTo a $ Zipper r (EC False a' l c)\n\nWhen this becomes a full library, it probably won't export the `Node` type, since that's an implementation detail, and too involved to expect library users to deal with.  So we'll need functions to create `RedBlackTree`s, since the library users won't have access to the constructors.\n\n    -- create a red-black tree\n    empty :: RedBlackTree a\n    empty =  T Leaf\n\n    -- insert a node into a red-black tree \n    -- (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree#Insertion)\n    insert :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; RedBlackTree a -&gt; RedBlackTree a\n    insert a t@(T root) = case zipTo a (unZip root) of\n        -- find matching leaf and replace with red node (pointing to two leaves)\n        Zipper Leaf c -&gt; insertAt (R Leaf a Leaf) c\n        -- if it's already in the tree, there's no need to modify it\n        _ -&gt; t\n\nThe classic description of the red-black tree insertion algorithm uses eventual consistency.  You insert a red node\nat the proper point in the tree, then recolor and rebalance the tree until the it fits the constraints of a red-black tree.\nThat option's not available to us, however, because as we've defined it, any `RedBlackTree a` *must* fit the constraints.  So we'll need a different approach.  \n\nRather than actually construct an inconsistent tree (for which we'd need a whole *other* data type), we can use the current `Context`.  If all we wanted was to represent a hole in the tree, we could have defined the `Context m c n a` as just an alias for `Node c n a -&gt; Node Black m a`.  But by defining it the way we did, we can inspect the values of the parent, uncle, and grandparent nodes for the various cases that need to be handled.\n\n\n    insertAt :: Node Red n a -&gt; Context m c n a -&gt; RedBlackTree a\n    -- 1) new node is root =&gt; paint it black and done\n    insertAt (R l a r) Root = T $ B l a r\n    -- 2) new node's parent is black =&gt; done\n    insertAt x (EC b a y c) = T . zipUp $ Zipper x (EC b a y c)\n\nNote that `insertAt` returns a `RedBlackTree a`, rather than a `Zipper`.  The reason for this can be seen in the first two cases.\nIn case 1, we add a new black node at the root, incrementing the number of black nodes on all paths from the root to the leaves, so it would have to return a `Zipper (Succ m) a`.  But in case 2, we just insert a red node, leaving the black node count as it was, so that would return an `Zipper m a`.  We use the existential quantification provided by the `RedBlackTree a` here to mask that changing type.\n\n    -- 3) uncle is red =&gt; paint parent/uncle black, g'parent red.  recurse on g'parent\n    insertAt x (BC pb pa py (EC gb ga (R ul ua ur) gc)) = insertAt g gc\n      where p = if pb then B x pa py else B py pa x\n            u = B ul ua ur\n            g = if gb then R p ga u else R u ga p\n    -- 4) node is between parent and g'parent =&gt; inner rotation\n    insertAt (R l a r) (BC False pa py pc@(EC True _ _ _)) = insertAt (R py pa l) (BC True a r pc)\n    insertAt (R l a r) (BC True pa py pc@(EC False _ _ _)) = insertAt (R r pa py) (BC False a l pc)\n    -- 5) otherwise =&gt; outer rotation\n    -- XXX: GHC seems unable to infer that gy is Black so I have to do both cases\n    --      explicitly, rather than\n    -- insertAt x (BC True pa py (EC True ga gy gc)) = \n    --   T . zipUp $ Zipper (B x pa $ R py ga gy) gc\n    -- insertAt x (BC False pa py (EC False ga gy gc)) = \n    --   T . zipUp $ Zipper (B (R gy ga py) pa x) gc\n    insertAt x (BC True pa py (EC True ga gy@Leaf gc)) = \n      T . zipUp $ Zipper (B x pa $ R py ga gy) gc\n    insertAt x (BC True pa py (EC True ga gy@(B _ _ _) gc)) = \n      T . zipUp $ Zipper (B x pa $ R py ga gy) gc\n    insertAt x (BC False pa py (EC False ga gy@Leaf gc)) = \n      T . zipUp $ Zipper (B (R gy ga py) pa x) gc\n    insertAt x (BC False pa py (EC False ga gy@(B _ _ _) gc)) = \n      T . zipUp $ Zipper (B (R gy ga py) pa x) gc\n\nLastly, we define equality for `RedBlackTree`s and `Node`s.  We can't just derive `Eq` for these\ntypes since they use existential quantification to mask some types, so we manually define\nequality as structural equality with the same values at each location.\n\nThis may not be the best definition of equality for `RedBlackTree`s, as two trees\ncan hold the same values, but have different structure.  For example, both `T $ Node Leaf 3 (Node Leaf 4 Leaf)`\nand `T $ Node (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) 4 Leaf` are valid `RedBlackTree Int`s holding just the values `3` and `4`, but\nsince they have different structure, they would be marked as non-equal.\n\n\n    -- can't derive, since we abstract over n, so we have to manually\n    -- check for identical structure\n    instance Eq a =&gt; Eq (RedBlackTree a) where\n      T Leaf == T Leaf = True\n      T (B l@(B _ _ _) a r@(B _ _ _)) == T (B l'@(B _ _ _) a' r'@(B _ _ _)) = \n          a == a' &amp;&amp; T l == T l' &amp;&amp; T r == T r'\n\n(ran out of room, so I'll just trim the definitions)\n\n      _ == _ = False\n\n    -- can't derive, since B abstracts over child node colors, so\n    -- manually check for identical structure\n    instance (Eq a) =&gt; Eq (Node c n a)  where\n      Leaf == Leaf                = True\n      R l a r == R l' a' r'       = a == a' &amp;&amp; l == l' &amp;&amp; r == r'\n      b@(B _ _ _) == b'@(B _ _ _) = T b == T b'\n      _ == _                      = False \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336838459", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You will be wanting to jungle 90% of the time, so I'll go off what I generally do in the jungle.\n\nIn the beginning: buy one sage's mask, two mana potions, and either save the rest of your gold OR buy a courier (your team might need one).  Go to the mid lane at the base tower, and when the creeps spawn at 0:00 deny one of the creeps with your W.  Go back to the fountain with Enigma to heal up this lost mana, and send the Eidelons middle to harass and help your mid deny until they run out.  Doing this, you won't waste time in the jungle because you will be in the jungle with full mana at ~0:30 sec, when the first spawns appear.\n\nIn the jungle, focus on the easy and medium camps until you get level 2 W, although it is possible to do the hard camps at level 1 if you control your units well (move them away before they die to spread out the damage and maximize yours).  Rush a soul ring, with which you will pretty much never run out of mana.  If you feel you are able to, gank the lane near where you are jungling (preferably when you have Eidelons, they do a lot of damage in the beginning), with your Q, but try to have it at level 2 before you gank, or else you'll just get one small stun (not really worth it).  \n\nSkills: W Q W Q W R W Q Q E R E E E.  \n\nSome people will suggest maxing your Q before your W, but I've found that W generally helps more especially for its pushing power.  \n\nItems: Soul Ring, Treads, Blink, Mek, BKB.  \n\nIf you have somebody else on your team getting Mek, you should try to get an early blink to set up some sick ganks with your ultimate.  Otherwise, the choice of getting Mek or blink first is up to your playstyle and the matchup.\n\nAfter the laning phase you should be getting some great kills set up with your ultimate.  If you use it in the early game to even get one hero, you're doing it right because chances are you're not going to be catching more than 2 without a blink, and a single target 4 second disable will usually end up in a kill.  When your ultimate isn't up, either farm the jungle with your W or set up ganks around the map with your Q, but make sure that you are getting farm during this time to get the items that Enigma truly needs.  Also, you should be trying to set up some pushes with Eidelons maxed out, Enigma can easily take down towers with this skill.\n\nLate game you are a walking death machine.  People often call Enigma an initiator, but you don't necessarily have to be the first one in fights, and often it is better that you aren't.  The reason for this is that when a team fight starts positioning goes awry, which can lead to 4-5 heroes clumping up, you blinking in, pressing R, and getting the best black hole of your life.  Make sure that you are playing behind your team, as YOU are the team fight, and if they jump any one of your teammates then you can easily save him, whereas they might not have the same power to do that if you get caught out.  Continue pushing with your W and setting up kills with your Q and E, and make sure you stick with your team.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336948185", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, it is picky, no doubt... but here's where it comes from. Warning, incoming pedantry:\n\nThere are two things that people do with fonts... kerning and tracking/letterspaving. Tracking doesn't fix problems, it's just a neat visual effect... you can apply it to an entire word and the whole word looks tighter or looser... like the \"W E D N E S D A Y\". Lots of air between all the letters looks stylish. \n\nKerning is the tweaking of certain pairs of letters that don't go together nicely because\nof the way their shapes match up. WA is the classic example... if the A begins where the W ends, it looks like there's a big gap between those parallel lines... the right leg of the W and the left leg of the A. So the font creator will make a rule that basically says whenever \"WA\" are side by side, tuck them a bit closer together. Here's \"WAR\" in a well-made font with this rule applied, vs. the same font with no kerning applied: http://i.imgur.com/2SloE.jpg\n\nOnce you see that gap it's hard to unsee it and you end up being \"that guy\" who makes nitpicky posts about kerning :P Most of the well-made fonts you see are doing this automatically, there are dozens of 'kerning pairs' like WA or LT or Ro.\n\nUnfortunately there are also lots of not-so-well-made fonts where the designer doesn't know about the subject or doesn't bother because he's making a free font. \n\nSo basically, you shouldn't have to hassle with this if the font maker is doing his job correctly, but if you got a free font made by an amateur, you might look over the page for obvious spacing issues.

This is something the GADT form permits; that I'm not certain about and went back and forth on in different versions.\n\nBy the 'category laws' you basically mean the associativity of `&lt;+&lt;` (and the existence of an identity pipe). But the associativity of that particular combinator isn't the only thing one would like to grasp, especially if one contemplates rewrite rules, not that I ever got close to contemplating any in my feeble atkeyizing effort.  I'm not sure, but the `effectfulFold` principle seems much stronger than anything you are considering and the `FreeF` detour sort of occludes it though it may make a proof of associativity of one particular function easier to see.  I suppose something like it could be recovered in your present version, which is closer to Atkey's approach in putting the monad on the outside, `FreeT { runFreeT :: m (FreeF f r (FreeT f m r)) }` as the original `Pipes` didn't.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337044496", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This pattern can be repeated to generate some obscenely large numbers.\n\nSo, to reiterate: multiplication, exponentiation, etc. don't have any meaning in themselves. They're significant because they're defined *in terms of* more elementary arithmetic operations. \n\nSo a x b + c is meaningless; we can only solve because we can simplify multiplication into addition.\n\nAlso, these sorts of advanced notation are good because they save a lot of space :)\n\n_____________________\n\nAlso, a lot of people are trying to tell you that \"PEMDAS are just the rules, bro\"... this actually isn't the case. Brackets and parentheses are for forced precedence and they're largely arbitrary -- in other words, there's no mathematical reason that we give these symbols special significance. We could just as easily represent our expressions in Reverse Polish Notation or something similar, with similar precision. \n\nThe arithmetical functions, on the other hand -- by which I mean addition, multiplication, and exponentiation -- don't have arbitrary precedence. As I explained above, in order to arrive at a solution we must use the definitions of the arithmetical functions to simplify our expressions into something in terms of a single function. We *need* to do these things first or else it's impossible to simplify. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337148886", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Obviously this isn't realistic, but replace his Q with any other regular skill in the game.  Nothing works except maybe Nautilus' Anchor thing and that is a very, very, similar but worse skill.\n\nI think Lee Sin and Leblanc are based on comboes and it makes them really fun.  Both require you to land a bunch of skills in certain sequences for special outcomes, like Q + R + Q on Lee Sin being the highest burst he can deal or W + R + Q being the absolute longest range that Leblanc can deal damage at.  This type of thing is fun and unique.  \n\nI land this skill and now I get to beat the shit out of you isn't really much of a combo unless you're playing a fighting game, and that's basically Blitzcrank.  You either pull them and lay the beat down or you knock them up and then pull them.\n\nI think a lot of the problems I have with Blitzcrank could be fixed with a model rework.  It is almost kind of fun to die to a Q R Q from Lee Sin because it looks really cool.  Blitzcranks animations are incredibly outdated and ugly so him killing you is like \"Gee look at this really stupid looking yellow robot killing me with his ugly skils.\"\n\nI still stand by his kit being random and not synergistic at all.  I get it, I get it, his Speed Boost helps you land all his other abilities because of their short ranges, his Ult stops people from flashing away from escaping for just that much longer, and his knock up is something you get to land after using other skills, almost like a finishing move but not really.  This is minor synergy at best that I had to absolutely cherry pick the crap out of to make it work.  There are plenty of other champions with kits like Blitzcrank, like Tristana and Sion, that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  \n\nThe best way I can outline what I mean by their kits being horribly lacking in synergy is to show off some examples of really well designed kits.\n\n**Alistar**.  The perfect tower diver.  He Headbutts in, hitting you against a Wall, activates his ultimate before taking a tower shot, and then immediately pulverizes you.  Headbutt and pulverize have great synergy because they chain together really well, in any order for a lot of possible outcomes.  Alistar's ult and heal are also greatly synergistic because his Ult makes him love HP more than any other stat and his heal grants that HP, making him a really fantastic tank.  His passive is admittedly lame within his kit, but it enables him to jungle and it helps him land his headbutt and pulverize.\n\n**Karthus**.  Karthus has 3 greatly synergistic normal skills.  Lay Waste and Defile combine to allow you to last hit solely with Lay Waste because of Lay Waste's low cooldown and Defile's mana gain on kill passive.  Karthus has two main restrictions when hitting someone with his regular skills, one has a range his issue and the other is a skill shot.  Wall of Pain makes both much easier to hit because it is a strong slow, and increases your damage as well.  Karthus' ultimate has its strongest synergy with his passive because it allows you to kill people who just barely kill you with very high reliability.  Defile and Karthus' passive have great synergy as well because one gives you infinite mana and the other can use a seemingly amount of infinite mana.\n\n**TL;DR**:  You might find Blitzcrank fun, but most people don't unless they're landing hooks.

{"body": "A great approach would be working with movies and verbatim memorization of texts.\n\nTry focusing on one movie that you really like: you learn more by working on one text deeply than working on many texts superficially.\n\nWatch the movie one first time without subtitles and try to get a global understanding. Imagine having someone in front of you (or actually HAVE someone in front of you!) and tell him what the movie was about (in the target language, of course).\n\nNext, try transcrbing parts of the movie (or all of it, if you're really serious). The effort of understanding word by word will be a good foundation for the rest of the work.\n\nNext, try translating the movie in your own language. Then compare your translation with a professional translation (i.e. find the English subtitles of the movie). Analyze and compare your version and the professional version.\n\nAnalyze the movie in the original language: note down new vocabulary, and especially new expressions that you might find useful. Make flashcards or any kind of your preferred self-test method.\n\nBy now, you'll have watched, analyzed and manipulated the language of the movie so much that you'llprobably already know parts of it by heart.\nNow on to the actual phase of memorization:\n\nTake parts that you like a lot and simply repeat the lines you want to learn (you might want to play only one character) afer the actor. Try to focus on intonation, pronunciation and especially try to MEAN what you're saying.\n\nIf you're really serious, you might want to use an audio editing software, mute the lines of the actor you're playing and dub it yourself!\n\nUse verbatim learning software like:\n[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23420016/Verbatim2.html](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23420016/Verbatim2.html)\n\nor [http://memorizenow.com/](http://memorizenow.com/)\n\nThe basic principles these softwares use is to progressively blank out portions of the text you have to memorize until you only have the first letter of each word, or the first word of each sentence or only the word length indicated by x's, e.g.: \n\n* \nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\" --&gt; \n* \n\"Two ____ diverged in _ _______ road\" --&gt;\n* \nT r d i a y r \n\nor \n\n* \nXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXX XX X XXXXXX XXXX\n\netc.\n\nI think learning by heart meaningful, conextualized language that you enjoy and have some emotional response to (since you like the movie) is the best way to attain fluency. Those lines will become deeply ingrained in your head and - provided you have a thorough understanding of them (hence all the preliminary work of analysis and translation), will provide a model for your own spontaneous production. \n\nSources:\n\n[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/cd/actors_memory.pdf](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/cd/actors_memory.pdf)\n\n[http://scottthornbury.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/m-is-for-memorization/](http://scottthornbury.wordpress.com/2011/04/08/m-is-for-memorization/)\n\n[http://www.productivity501.com/how-to-memorize-verbatim-text/294/](http://www.productivity501.com/how-to-memorize-verbatim-text/294/)\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2YDkfgLtPA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2YDkfgLtPA)\n\n[http://www.amazon.com/Activities-Language-Learning-Cambridge-Handbooks/dp/052113241X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337252254&amp;sr=8-1](http://www.amazon.com/Activities-Language-Learning-Cambridge-Handbooks/dp/052113241X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337252254&amp;sr=8-1)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337252335", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

I disagree with this because w can only be used when you are going all in on your opponents, whereas e is much less commital and can just be used for harrassment.  Also the fact that it doesn't miss is huge.  I think having e's passive exploding effect do more damage is also helpful.  As long as you have one point in e, you will push your lane if your opponents want you to, so you might as well put more points into it and clear the wave really fast and make the enemy lose last hits to their turret.(wards are necessary if you are using this strategy.)\n\nI think the bug you mentioned is what happens when you misclick the ground when trying to click on an enemy champion.

I've got my Syn-Aud-Con paperwork. But in the instances we're talking about, you're still mixing up terms.\n\nRT-60 simply means \"amount of time for reverberation to drop 60dB.\"  That's a measurable parameter in any size space.  Whether you can apply that measurement to any given instance is subject to debate; whether it can be used to measure the absorption of a surface material is not.  Your own quote says that control of the early reflections is important because there is no meaningful reverberant sound field in a control room.  It does not say \"there is no meaningful reverberant sound field in a small space.\"  Early reverbs were just that - small concrete chambers with a source and a receiver in them.  \n\nYour whole point seems to be \"you can't use these numbers because there's no reverberant sound field in small spaces.\"  This point is in error.  If I take a small tiled room and hang dead cats all over it, the frequency response of the room will experience attenuation in line with the NRC of dead cats.  Further, if I have NRC numbers for dead cats and NRC numbers for live cats, and I have measurements from dead cats, my live cats numbers will be a reasonable approximation of the math.  That's a Noise Reflection Coefficient, not a Noise Reverberation Coefficient and while you can't get perfect numbers in a small space, you can't get perfect numbers in a large space, either.  \n\nPretending that small spaces don't reverberate is academic hair-splitting.  Presuming we're out of close-coupled territory, anything beyond a 2nd reflection is essentially reverberant.  RT60 is *entirely* applicable in \"SAS\" because you can measure it.  You are, in fact, *required* to measure it for most ASTM testing.  \n\nThis is actually a pretty simple discussion that you're throwing all sorts of marginally-applicable terms at.  Somebody posted a bunch of NRCs.  You said they aren't applicable because there's no such thing as close-field reverberation.  Considering how much the first surface hit contributes to reverberation, the fact that there's no \"diffuse sound field\" by your definition is moot - if 100dB of 125Hz hits a surface with an NRC of .2 at 125Hz, 80dB are going to bounce back - \"diffuse sound field\" or no.\n\nNow.  \"Acoustics.\"  A C O U S T I C S.

{"body": "Hi, these are fascinating questions and I couldn't help but feel compelled to try and answer them. As a hearing person I relish the opportunity to see my own world from a different perspective and this post becomes a wonderful challenge for me. I hope I might be of help, and if not at least I get to try and flex these translation muscles of mine :).\n\n1) The emotions associated with crying create certain sounds and rhythms. Sadness, for instance, creates a 'wet' sound and almost as if it's falling. To describe it in a different way, it might be like a ball on a bungee cord. You drop the ball and it hits a lowest point and then comes back up a little less high and then goes back down until it achieves a stillness. When it achieves stillness they bring the ball all the way back up to the top and drop it again. That could be how crying in sadness 'sounds'. \n\n Crying out in anger is not really like crying though. It's more like doing something physically arduous. You lift a weight and as you push it towards the maximum you feel the amount of force you're expending. Marry that act of expending some force to a sense of anger and 'Crying out in anger' comes into focus, I think. To put it another way, it's not so much about the actual sound but rather the 'shape' of that sound. Think of a long wide line with pointy edges being extended with speed. That is crying out in anger.\n\n2) A Shriek is a kind of sound. High pitched, quick and painful, meaning 'blinding' for ears. So just think of a bright light at night and being blinded, it's pretty much the same for a shriek. So it can be used as a description as well, since both blinding and shrieking are mostly unpleasant to experience. \n\n Ream, as I use it, is like a one-sided discussion with a certain tone of anger. If you ever try to 'tell a person off' you might be 'reaming them out'. So it includes both an angry content (think of a time you were angry at someone, and how you formed your words against them) as well as an angry tone (think of a color in the front of your vision that almost entirely blocks your view, and it's bright enough that it makes you squint). Both Shriek and Ream are unpleasant, but Ream (in my opinion) comes with a bit of that connotation.\n\n3) Piercing has an element of speed to it. Thunder might pierce if it's very close (so close that it could easily be called lightning), but further away thunder rumbles slower and at a lower (less bright) level. Piercing is loud and annoying, as you say, but it's also high and fast. Think, again, of a blinding flash. Or a laser might be 'piercing' in a similar way to how a siren is 'piercing'.\n\n4) No, ejaculation doesn't have a sounded connotation. It's just a sudden (and probably messy or unexpected) action. I see it mostly as a derogatory term but there may be exceptions i'm not aware of. But no sounded connotation.\n\n5) This one is a fun question, because it has to do with convenience in sounding words and cultural norms. When a person says something there are distinct sounds between the letters to denote when one ends and another begins. Think of a rainbow, each color on the rainbow is R O Y G B I V. When you read that, those colors seemed very distinct and separate, yes? But a real visual rainbow is more like a smear, the colors all blend between one another because it abides by the rules of light. So its closer to rroooyygggbbbiiivvrr. Written words are kind of like the first rainbow, but when you speak them they have to abide by the rules of sound, which is kind of like the second rainbow.\n\n Next consider that the mouth is a tool that can only makes certain sounds at certain times and moving your mouth to a different sounding position takes time. Therefore, to save time some people use tricks to get from one sound to another. Think of it like a hand gesture, moving from one gesture to another might take X amount of time if you do it letter by letter, or Y amount of time if you use a singular gesture. Ebonics, slang, jive, AAVE(?) probably all use certain tricks to sound words like using a singular gesture.\n\n The problem for me comes in determining the vocabulary of sounded gestures. I must admit I don't have good answers for this, it would probably be best to try and read transcripts of black people talking, rather than reading how they type. How a person types and how they speak are not the same, especially when it comes to dialogue.\n\n Jive is from the 1960's/70's, AAVE is an academic term for more contemporary jive, and Ebonics is the layman's term for AAVE (also carries a somewhat derogatory connotation). So time period is important to determine between Jive and AAVE/Ebonics. As for writing in that language, I really do recommend transcripts or closed captioning of period pieces.\n\n6) Stutter is being caught in a word or letter. Like when you go to do a hand gesture and you can't get your fingers to move like they should and they get stuck in a position.\n\n Stammer is being caught in a thought. Like when you don't know how to end a sentence or communicate an idea and so you just keep adding filler words until you get it.\n\n The difference, as you may see, is between a physical block and a mental block.\n\n7) Chat has no real sounded connotation; you can use it as a dialogue tag because it describes a level of commitment to a subject (that is, a low level). Chatting is mostly light discussion, so when they say 'speak informally' they really mean 'carry on a conversation informally'. No sounded connotation worth mentioning.\n\n8) Mumbling is incomprehensible by sound, meaning you can't make sense of what you're hearing no matter how close you are. Whispering can be made sense of, presumably, if you get close enough. Consider a changing color painted onto a very small canvas. From a distance, and up close, there is no real way to distinguish what the color 'is' because it is in flux. Whispering, on the other hand, is like a distinct color on the same small canvas. From a distance, unknown, but up close it can be recognized.\n\n As for the emotional content, one can mumble with pretty much any emotion. The usual's are, as you say, apathy and hostility. But the thing to remember is that it's incomprehensible. A hostile mumbler does it so the other person won't know what he's saying but he'll still get the pleasure of feeling like he's confronting them. An apathetic mumbler does it because he doesn't care that the other person won't know what he's saying.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337405592", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "9) This is another fun one, because these sound words describe characteristics of the animal. In the same way a dog has a certain shape and carries itself in a certain way, a dog also has a certain sound and rhythm. It's good to remember that words have have both sound (color) and rhythm (movement).  So these words directly refer to the sound and rhythm the animals make. I'm at a loss for describing what, exactly, they are; but if I were you I'd get some sound files of the actual noises and play them loud enough that I could feel them on my palm or some other body part. That, to me, would adequately explain the content so that I could use it in other contexts.\n\n10) A howl is primarily an animalistic noise, yes. But it can be used by humans if you want to evoke a sense of animalism or primal feeling. So howling in pain evokes a sense of primal reaction and is similar to crying in that it is a longer, extended sound. The actual sound of a howl is like the trajectory of an arrow, long (perhaps a small ascent) with a slow descent until it hits a floor and stops. Take a certain hand gesture and follow a mock arrow trajectory, as you head towards the floor slowly convert your hand back to a resting gesture. That's a howl.\n\n Dogs do sound different, just like people look different. Each voice is unique and even the same size and breed will have differences. Perhaps not as striking as those of other breeds, but that can be likened to visual differences between races.\n\n Again, if you're looking to use sound words in proper context you'll need to have a way to feel the actual sound they're making. And sound words used outside the original animal sometimes evoke qualities FROM the original animal. For instance, I wouldn't say mice squawk, a squawk is a larger sound than a mouse's size would indicate. I might try looking for wav files of those words (squawk, chirp, roar, and howl) and turn them up real loud so I could feel them. Get maybe 10 of each word and form a comparison for them. Only realize that by making them so loud you might be losing the emotional content, so use it only to build a sense of the shape rather than the feeling.\n\n11) All doors do not creak. Creaking comes from friction between joints; maybe you've felt it in your bones. A time where a joint created friction as you moved it around, the way you feel it is similar to the way it sounds. Creaks in doors happen due to disrepair or age (older is more likely to creak). \n\n Slamming is an action. Therefore, pretty much all doors can be slammed if you can physically slam it.  Slamming is exceptional force. Some door and window types are built to stop them from being slammed (think of doors at stores, or restaurants) so make sure it's physically possible before you try and slam it in your book. 'slamming' the beer usually refers to how they slam the beer down on the table once finished. It's a figure of speech that uses the sound the beer can/mug makes when it hits the table to describe how quick and forceful the drinking was. In other words it just means you finished it fast.\n\n12) I would describe the difference between Gurgle and Gargle by using the letters that change between them. The U starts up, goes down, then back up again. That's the sound a gurgle makes, you just roll out the U motion in your mouth a number of times. The A starts down, goes up, and comes down again. Done quickly these are the sounds that they make\n\n To think of it another way, consider a gurgle a lower sound and a gargle a higher sound. So gurgle's come from further in the 'hole' and gargle's are closer to the mouth of the 'hole'.\n\n13) Until very recently phones rang, nowadays phones just make whatever noise you want them to make. They use the word 'ringtone' and people call it 'ringing' only because of habit and familiarity. They describe them as chirping most likely because their sound is now closer to a chirp.\n  \n Phone ringing itself is like a small high sound that isn't painful to hear, really. Almost like snow falling; light, airy, and after a time you might get uncomfortable but a little bit here and there is no big deal. Basically it's just meant to get your attention. If you've ever watched how a small bell physically resonates then you are watching a 'ringing' sound.\n\n14) The important point of clicking is the lack of strong resonance. That is, the sound does not continue very long. It's a short sound, like if you were to hit two hollow things together quickly and without much force. However, clicking sounds now have a more specific connotation. \n\n Consider an on off switch, it has two positions and every position in between that is not likely to keep the switch still. Therefore, when the switch is pushed it continues, hits against the furthest position, and 'clicks' with the mechanism that houses it.\n\n15) Tender relates to harshness or toughness. A tender man is not physically harsh or tough, so a tender voice is not sounded harsh or tough.\n\n16) A person can attach any emotion to any sound they want, context determines if it fits or not. Most moans are reactions to nerve data, pain or pleasure are common and simple things people react to. It too is an expelling, kind of like 'crying out'. In fact 'crying out in pleasure' is similar to moaning in pleasure. Sometimes the word might change to a 'groan' for disgust which is similar.\n\n17) Cooing is an animal sound again, comes from birds i think. As such it isn't a reaction so much as an action. Moaning sexy is a reaction to something, cooing sexy is acting sexy.\n\n18) Something to remember is that sound is not like R O Y G B I V, it's like rroooyyygggbbbiiivv. Whispering exists somewhere near the left of that gradient but doesn't have a distinct end so much as a tapering off. Same with shouting. So if a person intends to whisper, they might be whispering too loudly, making their whispering useless. Or if a person intends to shout they might be shouting too softly, making their shouting useless. That is mostly a contextual thing, something determined by the event taking place and by comparison.\n\nThanks for asking these questions, I hope these are slightly helpful and I appreciate the opportunity to try and explain them.

{"body": "Well, an *s* followed by an *i* or an *e* (slender vowels) is pronounced like the English *sh*, which is also why \"Seán\" is pronounced like \"shawn\". Note the accent on the *a*. It's called a fada, and the word \"sean\" (without the fada) is pronounced like \"shan\" (and means \"old\"). \n\nThe letter *h* is not a consonant in Irish, but is used to *aspirate* consonants (it used to be signified by a dot over the consonant in question rather than a *h* following it). *bh* can be pronounced like the English *w* or, as in the case of Siobhán, *v*. Neither *w* nor *v* exist in the Irish alphabet, which is: a á b c d e é f g h i í l m n o ó p r s t u ú\n\nAn aspirated *s* (*sh*) is actually pronounced like the English letter *h*.\n\nEdit: And a note about the *io* in Siobhán. It's not necessarily pronounced \"shiv-awn\", it can also be \"shuv-awn\" - really it's half-way between the two but it's probably difficult for most English speakers to get the sound exactly right. \n\nAlso, it has to be spelled *io* because in Irish the length of the vowels on either side of a consonant have to agree. *o* and *a* are both broad vowels. Compare to Sinéad: *i* and *e* are both slender vowels. (Sinéad's another name that demonstrates the pronunciation of *s* before a slender vowel.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337415453", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I needed the games, the dust covers, and the Zapper to fill some collection holes.  The Genesis, however, is exciting:\n\nYou guys might shrug and say \"I see hundreds of Genesis 1s, that's boring!\" but I'm pretty excited.  Not only is this Genesis 1 S-Video modded (I think it's the one you see in action [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/th7tj/video_comparison_of_my_genesis_svideo_mod_vs/)) but it's also a non-TMSS model.  That means I can finally play three of the games I have without having to use a Game Genie!  TMSS was copy protection that requires a game to rapidly write S E G A to a specific memory register.  There's a small handful of early titles that were unlicensed and don't work with any model of Genesis after this (except with a Game Genie).  Plus, games start up faster because they don't have the licensing screen before the SEGA logo.  Now I just need to see if I can combat the rainbow banding somehow...\n\nFrom two garage sales, I spent $6.  At the first, I got the NES Advantage, Dreamcast keyboard, and Genesis 6-button controller for $5.  Everything needs a bit of a cleaning, but it all works great.  The DS case was $1 at a different sale.\n\nThe last item came from reverserain.  Vagrant Story is my favorite PS1 game (with Robo-Pit being a close second for drunk fun) and I saw he got this out of the second round of his awesome PS1 purchase.  Asked him about it, and he sent it to me for only cost-of-shipping.

{"body": "This is a slightly more advanced supplement to GooseSlayer's answer.\n\nI'll quickly address some of the concepts that make encryption algorithms secure, and what exploits there are.\n\n\n\n**What makes encryption algorithms secure?** Your original message is called *plaintext* and the encrypted message is called a *ciphertext*. Encryption is a mathematical function which uses the password to turn the plaintext into the cipher, and decryption uses the password to transform the cipher into the plaintext. The function is a mathematical algorithm and how it exactly works depends on the encryption used. But what they all have in common is that without the password, it should not be possible to get the plaintext from the cipher, except to try every possible combination of passwords (guessing). And the guessing method should take a really long time, so the function should be very computationally expensive.\n\nSo how is that done? The expensive computation all encryption algorithms have in common is [*integer factorization*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_Factorization). Any integer can be written as an expression of prime factors. For example, 12 = 2\\*2\\*3. 36 = 2\\*2\\*3\\*3. 23 is a prime, so it has no prime factors but itself. To figure out if a really big number is prime or not is really expensive. It is an open mathematical problem to find an effective algorithm to compute prime factors, as well as computing the n'th prime.\n\n**What are possible weaknesses  that applies to encryption algorithms?**\n\nAs stated above, if someone found a *really* fast way to compute the prime factors of an arbitrary big number, or found a way to compute the n'th prime, it would probably render all known cryptography algorithms useless. But we could probably make up new ones that were equally secure by choosing another unsolved mathematical problem which is equally computationally expensive. As said, the nature of prime numbers is an open problem that has been unsolved for centuries. This is a highly unlikely attack vector.\n\nA more valid concern is flaws with the actual *implementations* of encryption algorithms. That is, there is no inherent flaw with the mathematics behind it, but someone who implements the algorithm with computer code might get parts of it wrong, or forget to take something into account.\n\nOne of the most common implementation flaws is *leaking information*. That can happen in at least two ways. The first one is a leaking information by how much time the algorithm use to run. For example, if an implementation uses 1 ms to run on a correct input but 10 ms to run on incorrect input, then you can utilize a timing attack. Simply try random passwords and letters and keep the ones that uses less time than the others. There exists methods that can detect differences on the nanosecond scale here. So it is  **very important** that implementations use the same time to process invalid input and valid input.\n\nThe second common implementation flaw is to leak information by frequencies of sequences in the cipher. This can also be a problem with the algorithm itself, but it is mostly an implementation flaw. Take the old Caesar cipher for example, or ROT-13. It works by just offsetting two alphabets like this:\n\n* A B C D E F G H I J ...\n* N O P Q R S T U V W...\n\nThe plaintext \"To be or not to be\" becomes \"Gb or be abg gb or\". Caesars runner messengers carried messages encrypted similar to this in old Rome. But unlike ROT-13 which is kind of a joke and always uses a fixed offset, the runners carried messages with different offsets at different times. (I'm going somewhere with this example, I promise.) This is a good example of an encryption algorithm which is susceptible to a frequency attack.\n\nSo what is it? Well, in all languages some letters or symbols occur more often than others, like the vocals 'e' and 'i' in the English language. Some are rarely used, like 'x' and 'z'. The concept can be extended further by eliminating groups of letters that occur frequently together or almost never together, like 'ch' and 'gk'. Words and meaningful data has structure, and the *frequency of occurrence* can be found by analysis. Think of it as a Mastermind game where you have red and white pegs as hints, and you're guessing the hidden combination.\n\nSo how do you prevent this from happening in modern algorithms? You simply make sure that the final ciphertext looks *completely random*. That means no obvious order or structure, and that frequencies of nearby symbols (or nearby bits or bytes) is meaningless.\n\nThe last weakness is to use a weak password or a short key. But this is neither an issue with the implementation nor is it an issue with the algorithm. It is the sole responsibility of the user to pick a strong password and use a strong enough key.\n\nHope this is useful.

{"body": "Yes, there is evidence of the Big Bang. I understand and accept that evidence. In other words, I *believe* in the Big Bang. I don't have to believe it, though, because it's backed up by empirical fact. Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant because it definitely occurred. But for the record, yes, I do believe in the Big Bang.\n\nYou keep saying that I'm claiming you said we know *why* it happened. I have never once stated or argued with you about *why* the Big Bang occurred. The why is, largely, irrelevant; even moreso because it is currently unknowable. \n\nWhat I have argued is that you claim we know *how* the Big Bang happened. We don't know how it happened. We know what happened as a result of the Big Bang, but we do not know how it started. No legitimate scientist will claim that we do. (I never mentioned anything about an explosion, either. All we can say is that it was a rapid expansion.)\n\nOnce again, there are three questions involved here. I'll lay them out for you one more time:\n\n1. **Why did the Big Bang occur?** A good question, but this should be left to philosophers to discuss, because in our case the \"why\" isn't relevant.\n2. **How did the Big Bang occur?** What laws of physics, known or unknown, that were at play in \"sparking\" the Big Bang? This is a question that we do not have an answer for.\n3. **What happened because of the Big Bang?** Science has great answers and piles of empirical evidence of this. There really is no question that we know exactly what happened after the big bang. \n\nDo you understand the difference between those questions? Between why, how, and what?\n\nThink of it like this: \n\nImagine you have never seen a car before. After observing another person work the controls for a bit, you come to some understanding of what happens when various controls are manipulated:\n\n1. Turning the round object causes the wheels to turn in the same direction the wheel is being turned. \n3. There's a stick on the floor that has the markings P R N D 1 2.\n2. Depressing the far-right pedal causes a loud noise and vibrations in the car. Depressing the pedal next to it doesn't seem to do anything.\n4. If you move the stick on the floor to D, 1, or 2, depressing the far right pedal will cause the car to move forward. Moving the stick to R and depressing the right pedal causes the car to go backwards.\n5. Once the car is in motion, the left pedal is found to actually have a purpose-- it slows the car down whether it is moving forward or backwards. \n\nThere's certainly a lot more to a car than that, but that's sufficient for my purpose. \n\nNow after a bit of observation, we know a good deal about what the car does. We know how to move it forward and backward, we know how to make it turn to either direction, and we know how to stop it. \n\nAll of that being said, we still have very little, if any, idea of *how* the car works. We know *what* the car does, but we have not yet opened the hood and learned what an engine is or how it works. We don't know what the transmission is or how the gears are shifted inside it. We don't know how the turning of the steering wheel is translated into the turning of the front wheels of the car. We know that the brakes cause it to slow once in motion, but we've not removed the wheels in order to see the braking mechanism and therefore come to understand it.\n\nIn short, we know what the car does, but not how it does it.\n\nI'm almost done discussing this with you, as I've explained the above several times yet and you still, apparently, don't understand the differences between *why, how, and what*.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337856587", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll start with the C major, first in the left column, because it's easiest. The notes of the scale in C major are C D E F G A B, so we write the chords built on those notes in that order. In a major key the chords starting with the base note of the key, called the **tonic**, always go major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminished, and by convention are numbered with roman number I through VII, with lower case meaning minor/diminished. If you don't quite know what a diminished chord is, don't worry too much, it's just neither major nor minor.\n\nSo in the key of C major the chords in number order are:\n\n * I - C major\n * ii - D minor\n * iii - E minor\n * IV - F major\n * V - G major\n * vi - A minor\n * viiº - B diminished\n\nFrom C major you can move stepwise up the scale to different keys. Skipping G major for the moment and going to D major, you see the chords are in the same order as in C major, except starting from D, and that the major-minor-minor-major-major-minor-diminished pattern applies. Note that in the key of D there are two sharped chords, because the distance from note to note in a major scales stays the same, and it's always whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole like so:\n\nC-w-D-w-E-h-F-w-G-w-A-w-B\nD-w-E-w-F#-h-G-w-A-w-B-w-C#\n\nSo the chords in D major are D major, E minor, F# minor, G major, A major, B minor, C# diminished.\n\nMinor keys are like major keys but starting from the vi of a related major called, appropriately enough, the relative major. A minor is the the vi of C major, so A minor is the relative minor of C major. Why this is true is kind of complicated, but in the chard you can see the relative major and minor keys are side-by-side in the two columns. You'll notice the chords of relative major/minor pairs are identical, except the minor starts with the vi of the major.\n\nThe order of the keys (C-G-D-A-E etc) in the circle and in the chart is kind of subtle, but it has to do with how many sharps/flats are the key. Notice that C major has no sharps or flats, G major has one, D major has two, and so on up to 6 sharps when it switches to flats to avoid messy notation. Technically, you *could* think of D flat major as being C# major, but we don't do it that way traditionally.\n\nI hope all that helps, ask away if you have any other questions or need clarification.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337889926", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I agree with njchava and I thought I would add to his critique:\n\n**CF Logo:** Like nj said, the imagery is very familiar. As just a jumping off point for a new design, but still using the aperture, consider that you can make a C by taking out two or three \"blades\" of the aperture. \n\n**CD Logo:** apart from improving the flow of the C to the D, consider overall typeface weight throughout the logo. \"Design\" has a decent boldness to it, and is kerned tightly (mind that N drifting off on the business card). However, the \n\n**C** e n t e r s\n\nlooks like it doesn't belong because of how light the stroke weight is. As such, the eye is drawn to DESIGN first, then up to centers which is kind of floating above it. This is always a bad thing, but in this case the \"enters\" looks anorexic. \n\n**Leadfoot Logo:** I disagree a little here with nj that the typeface doesn't add a little context. Overall, it's a pretty heavy font so it definitely echoes the \"LEAD\" aspect of it. Could a better typeface be used? Yeah probably, but I think I'm getting the overall feeling of strength and boldness through it.\n\nOne bit of advice though on distressed type: avoid using typefaces with pre-distressed elements to them. Two big reasons:\n\n1. You're a designer, you have tools at your disposal to add these effects to typefaces and learning to do so will open \"distressed type\" to any and all fonts, so you won't have to find some kind of perfect balance between type and distress; Find a good typeface, and add the amount of distress you want with brushes and such. As a bonus, the entire type treatment will have a much more continuous and believable effect as, for example, an acid drop will splash across the L, E, and maybe part of the A. \n\n2. Repeated characters have the same exact distress on them which ruins the entire point of a distressed look in the first place. Ideally, the typeface is supposed to look worn or corroded by time or the elements, and having identical wear on the two O's, for example, makes it painfully obvious and takes the viewer out of the illusion. Yes yes, it's all digital and it's all smoke and mirrors, but particularly when created a logo, you have very precise imagery to communicate with and authenticity is very important. If you *must* use a distressed type font, try and make it less obvious. For example, you can flip/mirror that second O. \n\nI think you have the right idea for this logo, just consider a different execution and again, try to be less obvious. I know the expression \"lead foot\" refers to driving and pushing down on a pedal... and while I do like your idea of transferring that to the type, it doesn't seem to be communicating very well. Here are some considerations:\n\nInstead of having one letter acting as the foot, and the other the pedal, consider maybe each letter just being the pedal, and the foot is implied. For example, the L has a vertical stem that we can imagine as a pedal. Now imagine that pedal being pushed down, making the L more like a V but on its side. That would give both the impression of speed and possible a visual connection with a pedal being pushed down. \n\nAnother idea is this concept of weight, and you have these big bold fonts and this word \"LEAD\" that is giving that feeling. Try separating LEAD and FOOT, putting LEAD on top of FOOT and giving FOOT a lighter look, with a smaller X-height, giving the appearance of being squashed (without looking distorted and ugly).  You could even combine the two suggestions but I'm not sure how all of that would communicate in one big logo. \n\nEither way, good luck. Post revisions!

{"body": "Long story...better spark one up and be in the mood to read since I'm typing this damned thing out. :-)\n\nSo, it's the summer of 1980, and I'm in a tourist town in Colorado. I'm driving through the middle of town on a fine Saturday mid-morning with my then-soon-to-be wife. I'm in my Ford Mustang, which I had fixed up with headers and side exhausts and which was louder than hell. We're on a morning booze cruise, just wasting time with a 12-pack.\n\nSo we're in the middle of town and I'm smoking a blunt. I've got three more joints in my shirt pocket but that's all the weed I have on me. And, of course, we each have a beer between our legs out of the half-killed 12-pack in the back seat.\n\nWe're in the middle of town, and since we have no place to go, we're only doing about 20mph.\n\nThen -- cue ominous music -- I see the blue lights behind me. Oh shit! So I've got the half-finished joint in my hand and I make the quick decision to eat all of the weed.\n\nFortunately there's a lot of parked cars and no place to park, so I can't pull over immediately. That's good, because that joint is burning red hot and I've got to work up some spit before I put it into my mouth.\n\nSo I eat the hot joint, and without showing my movements to the cop immediately behind us, I take out the three joints out of my shirt pocket and cram them into my mouth. My girlfriend/wife has put her beer down somewhere but I'm focused on my dry mouth and swallowing the weed, the cop behind us and what he might be seeing, and also finding a spot to pull over because I don't want him to get impatient and think we're trying to outrun him at 25mph in the middle of town.\n\nFine. I finally pull over.\n\nNow, before I go on, a little more about my Mustang. I had lived in Colorado for a while, and my registration had expired. I would have gotten a new registration/plates, but my out-of-state plates were vanity plates and I loved them. The plates said \"Get Hi\" -- so you can understand my attachment to them, right?\n\nSo what's a guy to do?! Well, what I did was to take a razor blade knife and to cut out the \"6\" -- the month they expired -- out of the sticker on the license plates. Cool, you couldn't really notice it, but the year was still valid. Hey -- I was young and I never claimed to be the brightest bulb in the box.\n\nSo back to the cop. He walks up to the car and asks for my license and registration. I give him my license and fumble through the glove compartment. Obviously I can't give him an expired registration, right?!\n\nSo I tell him I can't find the registration.\n\nBut since I've got a cottonmouth full of weed that I'm trying to swallow, the cop can't understand me. So I repeat myself, and he still doesn't understand me.\n\nThen a light flashes in my mind! \"Hey, I've got a beer between my legs!\"\n\nSo I grab the beer, take a swig, and with a clear mouth I then tell the cop that I can't find my registration.\n\nThe cop then asks for my beer. I give it to him and he pours it out. \"No problem,\" I think, \"I understand.\"\n\nThen the cop asks for the 12-pack and takes each beer out (even the unopened ones!) and pours them out onto the ground.\n\nNow, with the cop content that we won't be doing any more drinking, he walks around to the back of the car to look at my license plate.\n\nIn the rear view mirror I see him smile -- a good sign! Obviously he saw the letters F O R D on the Mustang that I reworked to now read \"DORF\". But I see him look closely at the license plate -- a bad sign!\n\nThen the cop walks to the front of the car and looks at the license plate. He then kneels down.\n\nAt this point, I'm shitting bricks. Yup, not only will we get tickets for drinking in the car, but he's going to impound my car and I'm not only going to have to find a way home, but I'm going to have to pay impound fees and all sorts of fines for driving an unregistered vehicle. Fuck!\n\nAfter what seems like 20 minutes of staring at the front license plate, the cop walks back to his cruiser.\n\nAfter what seem like *another* 20 minutes he comes back.\n\nHe tells me and my girlfriend/wife that he's not going to give us a ticket for having an open container and drinking in the car. Instead, he tells us he's going to give us a ticket for drinking in public -- the same thing as if you were drinking a beer in a park, a pathetically trivial fine.\n\nI was absolutely shocked!\n\nAnd the license plates/registration? Clearly the cop knew the car was not registered because he had seen the registration sticker's month cut out on the license plate. But the cop never said a word.\n\nWith our empty bottles and a ticket in each of our hands, we were then free to go.\n\nAbsolutely amazing. I'm guessing there's at least one cop in Colorado who remembers what it was like to be young and stupid, or else he didn't want to deal with the paperwork that two fools like us would have him doing on a sunny, Saturday morning.\n\nPS -- Remember, that was 1980, before the US became a police state and before our prison population skyrocketed as people believed the law-and-order bullshit coming from the politicians of our two ruling political parties. I wouldn't advise anyone to try this today.\n\nOh! And the reason the cop pulled us over? Because he saw my then-girlfriend-now-wife taking a drink of her beer. Believe me, I've reminder her of that once or twice... :-)\n\nEdit: Typos.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337999495", "subreddit": "trees", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You'd be really great in a hospital waiting room (trust me, I volunteered as a lobby pianist and this kind of music is the most relaxing for the waiting families) or hotel lobby (although that's probably more jazzy by nature). \n\nBut if we move into more technical, formal composition critique, I echo others in saying more \"changes\" in general. One aspect of what makes music interesting is harmonic tension, and this loosely refers to the suspension you give listeners when you deviate from tonic, or, your home chord, in this case E major. (I hope you know some music theory!!) What made classical composers starting from Bach so radical as that they went for long stretches of time without returning to tonic (and allow me some editorial, what makes pop music so boring is that it returns you to tonic with zero drama). Your entire piece, from what I tell, decomposes down to a simple—simple is not per se bad!—I-IV-I-IV-I-IV pattern, E A E A E chords back and forth. \n\nSo what the others are saying in \"more chord changes\", I say go longer without returning to tonic. Here are some concrete suggestions.\n\n* Try adding  V, Bmaj after IV. I-IV-V. V-I is the strongest cadence, known as \"authentic\". Properly it is saved for a decisive finish to a phrase, but use it whenever your musical sentence is complete. \n\n* After that, try adding (sub)mediants. Mediant, iii, (G#min), is a good transition to IV. Try I-iii-IV. Submediant, vi (C#min), is a great landing site, and it happens to be your relative minor key, so without any key signature changes you can \"stay in this chord\" for a while and nothing will sound that bad. I can give you a whole 8 measure riff for free now, based on these two bullets: I-iii-IV-V-vi-iii-IV-V7-I. A whole 8 measures between tonics, rather than just 1! Look at that, doesn't it just *look* better than I-IV-I-IV-I-IV-I-IV? Try it out!\n  \n* Finally, don't be afraid to experiment with neighboring tones. At this point I wouldn't recommend much rhythmic experimentation (stay in a basic 4/4 like you are), but try to incorporate more 2nds and 7ths in your melody and harmony. And purposefully! Don't just throw them in for no reason, they have to go somewhere.\n\nAnyways, I got carried away. If something doesn't make sense I'll be happy to clarify, otherwise, best of luck!\n\nedit: submediant typo", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338020347", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "C E G A spells out a C6 chord.  That's normally used as a tonic chord, meaning the chord built on the main note of the scale, so in C major, you might use C6 instead of just plain C to make it sound more interesting.  The chord has a little bit of bite from the G A interval, but the A plays nicely with the other notes so it all sounds good together.  Plus, the A is melodically active against the rest of the chord, meaning that it wants to move somewhere.  The tonic 6 chord is very popular in big-band music and mid-century Broadway.  Later jazz prefers the Cmaj7, C E G B, because it's more complex, but I don't need to get into that now.\n\nA C E G spells out an Am7 chord.  That's normally *also* used as a tonic chord for A minor (the b7 in minor is added for the same reason as the 6 in major, except it's more neutral), but you find it very frequently as the ii7.  ii goes to V goes to I, so a progression you might see is Am7 D7 Gmaj7, or just plain Am D G: ii - V - I.  If you reorder the notes, the chord doesn't change, so C E G A is still an Am7, but with C as the bass; you'd write it Am7/C.\n\nSo wait, C E G A is both C6 and Am7/C?  But didn't I just describe them in completely different terms?  Yeah, I did.  The way you hear the chord depends completely on context.  Since you're in G major, though, it's much more likely to be the second one.  C is the IV of G, and Am is the ii of G.  When you add the 6th to a IV chord, it starts sounding like a ii chord.  It's really only when you add the 6 to the I chord that you get a new thing.\n\nBy the way, you could try adding the 6th to minor chords, too.  That'll make them sound very interesting, because the 6 isn't in the key of the minor chord!  Cm6 would be C Eb G A, and A isn't in C minor.  You get the extra dissonance between the b3 and the 6 as well, which is a tritone.  It's a nice chord.  However, just like C Eb G A is Cm6, A C Eb G is Aø7 (ø means half-diminished).  A C Eb is a diminished triad, and you add the G, the minor 7th, to make a half-diminished chord.  A fully diminished 7th, Ao7 or Adim7, would be A C Eb Gb, where you add a diminished 7th to the A instead of a minor 7th.  Anyway, A C Eb G is Aø7, and that's the iiø7 chord of G *minor*.  (It's also the viiø7 of Bb major, which is like an F9 without the F, or a V9 without the root.)  So if you're in G minor and you see C Eb G A, it's probably a half-diminished chord, but if you're in C minor, it's a Cm6.  There are other places where you might see a minor 6th chord too.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338100807", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Another similarity between marriage and possession of a slave woman is that just as the wife becomes a dependant of the husband and he has to provide a home, food and clothing for her, a slave woman also becomes a dependant of her owner and he has to provide a home, food and clothing for her. Yet another similarity is this that just as marriage makes the close relatives of the wife Haraam upon the husband; i.e. he cannot get married to his wife's mother, grandmother, sister, etc., similarly if a man has copulated with a slave woman the slave woman's close relatives also become Haraam upon the owner. With all these similarities it does not make sense to regard copulation with a slave woman distasteful whilst copulation with one's wife is not regarded as distasteful.\n\nA question that may still arise is that why does the owner of a slave woman not marry her before having relations with her? Well, this is impracticable because of a few intricate technicalities. Firstly, we know that a man has to give \"Mahr\" (dower-money) to his bride. The Holy Quran says:-\n\n[ A r a b i c ]\n\nTrans: \"And allowed unto you is whatsoever is beyond that, so that ye may seek them with your substance (i.e. with your dower-money). \" - (4:24).\n\nThus, \"Mahr\" is a conditional prerequisite of Nikah. If a man has to marry his slave woman, it would not be possible for him to abide by this condition of 'Mahr' because by Islamic law, a slave does not have rights over any property, i.e. she cannot own anything. In fact, whatever she has with her too, i.e. her clothing, etc., is all regarded as the property of her owner. Therefore, If he gets married to his slave girl and gives her the 'Mahr' she cannot become the owner of it because she has no right of ownership. The 'Mahr' would bounce back to the owner of the slave girl and it would tantamount to giving the 'mahr' to himself. Hence, the owner would become the payer as well as the PAYEE of the 'mahr' which would only result in the mockery of the whole system of 'mahr'. It would be absolutely superflous to have such a marriage ceremony performed that makes a mockery of the 'mahr' system. Hence, the owner cannot get married to her while she remains a slave girl. However, if he sets her free, then he can get married to her on the basis of her having become a liberated woman.\n\nAlthough the owner himself cannot get married to his slave woman, without giving her freedom, he can get her married to someone else. If he gets her married to someone else, then only her husband can now have intercourse with her and the owner's right of having intercourse with her comes to an end. All these facts prove that the slave girl does not become an instrument of sex; on the contrary, her honour is upheld, in that only one man is allowed to have intercourse with her JUST AS only one man (the husband) is allowed to have intercourse with his lawfully wedded wife.\n\nIslam ensured that the slave girl's duties were not restricted merely to domestic chores but also gave her master permission to copulate with her. This concession created an atmosphere of love and harmony between the slave girl and her master. Islam thereby raised the status of the war captive-maidens close to that of wives. It was a psychological cure to her grief-stricken heart, being deprived of her family and thrown into the hands of a strange society.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338135427", "subreddit": "islam", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wrong?  How, exactly?  Also, Schoenberg has a really messed up idea of why things sound good, which is why I had to put down his composition book halfway through when I picked it up in college.  The unordered set of notes C, E, G, A can represent (at least) two different chords with different functions, including C6 and Am7, and as an ordered set, it can specifically be C6 or Am7/C depending on context.  Which part of that is incorrect?  I assumed that this was not enough information for the OP, since the fact that C E G A spells a C6 wasn't obvious to him/her, and furthermore, the OP was asking for why it sounds good, which is a very complicated and subjective question.\n\nyepyep27 wrote:\n\n&gt; It would be a ii65 in fancy theory roman numerals. Aka \"am7/C.\" Aka C6 or C13, depending on if you're a jazz or pop music reader.\n\nYou replied:\n\n&gt; Good GOD why is this not the top comment?!\n\nLet me paste in the OP again:\n\n&gt; Hey guys, how are you doing today? Quick question, I was learning a new piano piece in the key of G major and came across this chord. C major with an A added in the soprano. So.. C in the left hand..and e g and a in the right hand. I know c is a 4chord in the key of g...and a would be a second/9th in they key of g. But I am not sure what to call this chord. I liked the added dissonance and would like to apply it to other keys. Can anyone elaborate on the concept behind why this combination sounds so good? Thanks for your help.\n\nThing is, yepyep27 identified the chord but did not elaborate like the OP asked.  In fact, there's not much that the OP can do with that knowledge, and he/she specifically wants to apply it to other keys.  ii65?  Great, what the hell does that mean?  If the OP didn't know before, he/she still doesn't now.  And in a situation where root position is prevalent, this could really be a C with an added 6th rather than an inverted Am7.  You don't have the context, so you can't tell which note is heard as the root.  I don't want to criticize yepyep27's comment, since it's technically accurate, but I'm trying to address your indignation at it not being the top comment.\n\nSo perhaps instead of referring people to mostly outdated classical sources (there is MUCH 20th century music that ol' Arnold didn't get to hear), you might try to explain why *you* think that chord sounds so good.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338158729", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; but that is not the international scholarly standard for understanding music!\n\nSo?  Schenkerian analysis has its place, but sometimes you want to call C B E A D G a Cmaj7 chord because that's what it is, even if traditional theory would call it a C13.  (I like that voicing, by the way; a stack of 4ths with the root below, and it's surprisingly clear for a six-note chord.)  It's much clearer to refer to it as Cmaj7, or even just C major, when you really don't care about the specific notes involved.\n\nAlso, functional analysis can get a bit confusing when people use different notations for different things.  Is the III of C major an E major chord or an Eb major chord?  I'd call E major III and Eb major bIII.  It's often easier to drop into a key and just be unambiguous, with the relationships implied, for illustrative examples.  In popular music, C6 is C E G A, while in classical analysis, I6 in C major is a C major triad with an E in the bass.  The notation may be standard for scholarly study, but it's unnecessarily confusing.  I won't say that my own notation for understanding music isn't idiosyncratic, but when I'm aiming for communication, I go for the clearer notation rather than the scholarly one.\n\nHonestly, I feel like insisting on the international *scholarly* standard is like insisting that academic publications be written in Latin.

{"body": "Well, it makes downstream filters or transformers easy to implement.  You just use:\n\n    pipe foo = forever $ yield . foo =&lt;&lt; await\n\n    filterP foo = forever $ do\n        x &lt;- await\n        when (foo x) $ yield x\n\nor more generally:\n\n    concatMapP foo = forever $ do\n        x &lt;- await\n        mapM_ yield (foo x)\n\nThis is a generalization of the \"it makes a category\" reason, since the category identity is just `idP = pipe id`.  But it's not just about identities; it's about the fact that there's a natural way to add downstream processing without interfering with the termination.  If you require the upstream pipe has a result of `()`, then doing that requires something ugly like changing the upstream output type to an `Either r b` so it can update you on return values, and making the downstream part keep track of the most recent return value.\n\nIncidentally, the problem with the code above is that you're using `Pipe` primitives that are designed to handle upstreams that terminate with meaningful values.  If you know the upstream does not terminate, you should just compose.  Consume is a little weird, because it depends on the upstream terminating, but ignores the return value... in that case, you could do this (which should maybe be added to pipes-core):\n\n    consumePipe p = (p &gt;&gt; return undefined) &gt;+&gt; consume\n\nThis would give an error if `consume` ever let the upstream pipe terminate, but that's precisely the condition you're depending on anyway to avoid the `Maybe` type.\n\n*Edit:* Incidentally, it would be possible to achieve all of this with a category in a way that might be more agreeable to you, but it would make the types even more complex.  The trick would be to separate \"termination type\" from \"result type\", giving the types:\n\n    data Pipe2 a b m t r\n    await :: Pipe2 a b m t (Either t a)\n    yield :: b -&gt; Pipe2 a b m t ()\n    (&gt;+&gt;) :: Pipe2 a b m r r -&gt; Pipe2 b c m r r -&gt; Pipe2 a c m r r\n    runPipe :: Pipe2 () Void m r r -&gt; m r\n\nAt that point, most low-level combinators would be polymorphic in `t`, leaving the final composition or `runPipe` to unify it with the result types.  But you could still implement `concatMapP` and its variants and use them downstream.\n\n    concatMapP foo = await &gt;&gt;= case of -- I wish this extension had gotten merged\n        Left  t -&gt; return t\n        Right x -&gt; mapM_ yield (foo x) &gt;&gt; concatMapP foo\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338390576", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This seems to be the fullest explanation, but I would add that I find OP's guitar teacher's version more practical and easier for me to understand since I relate everything back to key signatures.  If you learn scales more easily using the tone/semitone formula then the piano teacher's will be easier to understand.\n\nThe way I view it is that a given mode is the X mode of a key, so I can simply use the natural major scale constructed from that key, just starting on a different note.  So, for example:\n\nA Dorian is a scale based on the major scale whose 2nd note is A, or G Major.  Since G Major has one sharp (F#), the A Dorian scale is A B C D E F# G.  Compared to the A Major scale it has a flatted 3rd and 7th.  The Dorian mode has a very similar sound to the natural minor scale, just slightly more exotic and contains chords of different qualities due to the raised 6th when compared to the minor scale.  Dorian is very common in Jazz, notably So What by Miles Davis is played using the Dorian mode.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Ionian mode is the exact same as the major scale for a given key.  So the relative minor key for the major key is the same as the Aeolian mode.  (E.G.  C Major is C Ionian and A Minor is A Aeolian)\n\nIn short: The modes are scales using the same set of notes as other scales, just thinking of a different degree as tonic.  Or, they are diatonic scales constructed by starting in a different place while maintaining order of the traditional TTSTTTS pattern.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338419850", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Your piano teacher is right.  Your guitar teacher is kind of right but only in the context of guitar positions.\n\nIt's like this.  A mode is when you take a scale and put the tonic on a different note.  For example, the second mode of the major scale is called the dorian scale (it's usually called the dorian mode, but dorian scale is fine), because if you take the notes of the major scale but start on the second note, you get the dorian scale.\n\nSo far it sounds like what your guitar teacher said, right?  Well, let's consider C major.  The notes are C D E F G A B C.  The second mode -- aka dorian -- would be D E F G A B C D, but you *transpose back* to C, and you get C D Eb F G A Bb C.  C dorian is C D Eb F G A Bb C.  Knowing how the modes are derived is interesting to the right sort of person, but generally, what you need to know are the notes of C dorian.  From sharp to flats, here are the modes of the C major scale, in C:\n\nC lydian: C D E F# G A B C (fourth mode of major)\n\nC ionian: C D E F G A B C (major)\n\nC mixolydian: C D E F G A Bb C (fifth mode of major)\n\nC dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb C (second mode of major)\n\nC aeolian: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C (sixth mode of major, also known as natural minor)\n\nC phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C (third mode of major)\n\nC locrian: C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C (seventh mode of major)\n\nNotice that the number of flats increases by 1 each time from lydian (at -1 flat, or 1 sharp) to locrian (at 5 flats).  THIS is what the modes are.  What you need to know are which notes are in which modes relative to the major and minor scales:\n\nlydian: major #4\n\nionian: major\n\nmixolydian: major b7\n\ndorian: minor nat6\n\naeolian: (natural) minor\n\nphrygian: minor b2\n\nlocrian: minor b2 b5 (this scale is almost never used because the b5 makes it hard to make a tonic triad)\n\nHOWEVER, when playing guitar, it's probably useful to not have to memorize additional positions, so it's perhaps good to know that C dorian has the same notes as Bb major, or that G lydian has the same notes as D major.  However, while D dorian has the same *notes* as C major but starts on D, they're *different scales*.  In C major, A is the 6th, but in D dorian, A is the 5th.  In C major, F is the 4th, but in D dorian, F is the b3rd.  The notes mean very different things in relation to D than in relation to C.  If you derive some benefit in terms of guitar *technique* from your guitar teacher's mode of thinking about scales, good for you, but you shouldn't think about them that way.

{"body": "The best order for the modes is going from most sharps to most flats (or the other way around).  It's way too confusing to think of them with regards to their relative major.  For example, dorian mode has b7 and b3.  C major is C D E F G A B C, so to make dorian you flat the 7th and 3rd, and C dorian would be C D Eb F G A Bb C.  You could think of it as minor with natural 6, too.\n\nBut let's say you wanted to think of dorian mode the way other people (the OP's guitar teacher) think of it.  Then you'd have to figure out what is C dorian's relative major -- what major scale, starting on C, would yield C dorian.  Turns out I know enough music theory to figure out that it's Bb very quickly, but anyone who doesn't is stuck memorizing the relative majors of 6 modes for each of the 12 keys.  And really, that's not very useful information!  (I mean, you *could* make it useful, but it's much better to figure it out when you need it, which is rarely!)  Consider this: \"D dorian is C major starting on D\".  That tells you information only about the D dorian scale.  You'd need to say it this way: \"the dorian scale is the major scale a whole step below, starting on the second degree\".  Now we know how to make a dorian scale, but we need to figure out which note is a whole step below first, and we need to somehow internalize its notes with a different tonic.  It's extremely difficult to think in one key and play in another, so it's only practical if you're not thinking at all, and just playing, like a computer.  A *much* better way would be to say it this way: \"the dorian scale is the major scale with the 7th and 3rd lowered\".  We already know the major scale, presumably, so we lower the 7th and 3rd and we're good to go!
