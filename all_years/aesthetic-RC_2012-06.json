{"body": "I agree that the time of day when a particular piece of music is performed is not music theory, but I would argue that what you feel when listening to a particular piece of music *is* music theory, without regard for the culture that particular piece of music originates from.  Whether a major mode is happy or mournful is an issue for ethnomusicology (in music from Western it tends to be happy, while in Ashkenazi Judaism, the Slichot nusach is major and very much painful), but as it also answers a critical \"why\" of music, it's difficult to remove it from music theory altogether.  To take a rather mundane example, Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata deliberately tugs at the listener's heartstrings; is the emotional content of his work as valid for study as the emotional content of whatever raga was mentioned before?  One might consider it \"ethnomusicology\", since this is simply the music of 19th century Viennese society, but it's still music theory.\n\nYou say that\n\n&gt; studying the systems at work in non-Western musics is music theory, but it is generally contained within the field of ethnomusicology or relegated to a niche interest within the field of music theory\n\nA niche interest, however, is still part of music theory.  That's the crux of the argument.  Perhaps only a handful of theorists take it seriously, or perhaps *no* theorists take it seriously (for some definition of \"theorists\"), but so long as it's about the relationships between notes, it's music theory.  \"This is not what theorists like to talk about\" is an invalid criticism of a subject!\n\n&gt; not all of those musics have tonality and harmony. Theories of those musics necessarily need to approach them on their own terms, which is why traditional Western music theory isn't really equipped to work with them\n\n...and which is why traditional Western music theory is not necessarily the best approach to everything.  That's a larger point, which is not about the weaknesses of music theory but about the weaknesses of traditional Western music theory.  There are some things that traditional Western music theory is unsuitable for, and for those things, we need approaches outside of this Western tradition.  The OP of this thread pretty much asserted the superiority of traditional Western music theory (in a thread that he linked to) when I analyzed a C E G A chord as either a C6 or Am7/C, depending on context.  As the key was G major, the OP's preferred response was a poster who stated simply that it was a ii65 without much additional information.  Traditional Common Practice theory would indeed describe it as ii65, but without knowing any additional details other than the notes of that one chord, it would be difficult to know how it should be heard.  Even a standard dominant 7th can be an augmented 6th in a different key.  I don't even think this is outside of traditional theory, but using the classical figured bass notation was, in my opinion, unproductive in the given context.\n\nTo conclude, because I'm really going on too long, music theory should be about the theory of music, not simply the ethnomusicology of Western culture.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338514120", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The word \"modes\" is just that... there are many modes of the Major Scale. The first one is just what you are thinking of... Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do, C D E F G A B C, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, or whatever pitch system you are using. The relationships between the notes here in whole and half steps are as follows: Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Whole-Half. It's also known as Ionian. But there are other ways to play with this scale. You don't have to start on the 1. When you start on a differnet note, that note becomes more prominent, more and more like the \"home\" or the main note (aka root or tonic). Like if you played, D E F G A B C D, then \"D\" would start to sound like the main note. But if you really look closely at the whole steps and half step relationships between the notes in this scale, you would see that they have changed significantly from the first mode (Ionian aka the Major Scale). It is now Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Whole-Half-Whole. Why is this important? Because it sounds totally different from Ionian. This mode is known as the second mode, or Dorian.\n\n* **Ionian\n* Dorian\n* Phrygian\n* Lydian\n* Mixolydian\n* Aeolian\n* Locrian**\n\nAbove are the seven different modes you get from the Major Scale. All of the same notes, just with a different \"main\" note or \"tonic,\" which re-organizes the order of the relationships with all the notes that proceed forth up the rest of the scale.\n\nWhat's most awesome about this is that they begin sounding like their *own scale*. That's incredible. The same notes, different moods and feelings! Different soundscapes! So much inspiration. But if you keep calling it the second mode, or the sixth mode... the casual way of saying it is, it's just doesn't show enough \"respect\" to the way the mode stands on its own. So instead of calling it the fourth mode, we try to look at it as its own scale with its own set of relationships. It just helps us get away from the idea that the Major Scale is somehow superior to the other scales in terms of primacy.\n\nNow they can be compared and contrasted and A TON of great insight can be gleaned from doing so. But there is a most effective way I've come across via my old Kodály teacher, Dr. Anne Laskey (who is is now a Master Kodály teacher of teachers), something called the Bronson Star:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/SCZ0M\n\nIt lt looks weird, but essentially all it's saying is that a very simple way to learn modes is to approach each new mode from the previous mode with as few differences as possible.\n\n    So you start with Ionian (which you already know),\n    then learn to hear Mixolydian (same as Ionian but with a flatted seventh), \n    then learn to hear Dorian (same as Mixolydian but with a flatted third),\n    then learn to hear Aeolian (same as Dorian but with a flatted sixth),\n    then learn to hear Phrygian (same as Aeolian but with a flatted second),\n    then learn to hear Locrian (same as Phrygian but with a flatted fifth),\n    then finally, learn to hear Lydian (same as Locrian but with a \"flatted\" tonic).\n    \nI MIGHT BE WRONG....

{"body": "See a gallon is a measure of volume.  In SI, the standard measure of volume is the liter.  The OP is suggesting that Americans should not use the word **liter**ally because it contains the letters l i t e and r.  He then goes on to substitute gallon for the letters l i t e and r in the word illiterate (while ignoring the double l).\n\nWhat the OP does not realize is that users of imperial units must use the word literally because the substitute word *Gallonally* is already in use as a noun, and thus unavailable to be used in place of this particular adverb.  A Gallonalley is theoretical hybrid ship, somewhere between a [Galleon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleon) and a [Galley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley).  None were ever built, because the idea is kind of stupid.  But the word exists and, by imperial law, may never be repurposed.  Thus, we are forced to use the word literally to describe the act of measuring things by volume even if we are using imperial units of volume rather than SI.  \n\nThe only way to be free of the imperial restriction on the use of the word gallonally would be to switch to using SI units for all our measurements.

And as I said, I have a proof that `x &gt;+&gt; idP = x`.\n\nBut the other identity law doesn't hold, `idP &gt;+&gt; x /= x`, because the state monad has full access to the upstream pipe. You can define functions like\n\n    unawait :: Monad m =&gt; i -&gt; Pipe i t o m ()\n    unawait x = lift $ TStateT $ \\s -&gt; return ((), yield x &gt;&gt; s)\n    dupUp :: Monad m =&gt; Pipe i t o m ()\n    dupUp = lift $ TStateT $ \\s -&gt; return ((), s &gt;&gt; s)\n\nWhich clearly cannot be propagated upward.

If you can get a ranged minion low enough, you can jump to it and use E to stun the enemy. Then you can still Q after him when he makes distance, resulting in the highest combo damage. Also, if you have sheen: Active Hiten Style, then Bladesurge to ranged minion to one-shot them, then Q on to the enemy for a very large gapcloser.

{"body": "I can try, but there's math involved...\n\nA note is just air vibrating at a certain rate.  For example, the A above middle C (also known as A4) is air vibrating 440 times every second.  We say that the frequency of A4 is 440 Hz (Hz means hertz, which means cycles per second).  This happens because someone randomly decided that A4 was going to be 440 Hz; in Baroque times, it was lower, and some orchestras will tune it a bit higher.\n\nEach frequency is a note.  If you double the frequency, the note goes up by an octave, and those two notes sound so much alike that we say that they're the same note.  If you go up an octave from A4 at 440 Hz, you get A5 at 880 Hz; if you go down an octave from A4 at 440 Hz, you get A3 at 220 Hz.  They're still A's.\n\nNow, what happens when you multiply the frequency by 3?  Let's say you're at A3, 220 Hz, and you do that.  Your frequency is now 660 Hz.  A4 is 440 Hz, so 660 Hz is over an octave above A3.  Let's bring the note down by an octave, and we get 330 Hz.  This forms a perfect fifth with 220 Hz, and if you play the two notes together, the sound waves line up and you get a pure sound.  This is E4.  Since we multiplied the frequency by 3 then divided by 2, that's the same as multiplying by 3/2.  An octave means you multiply by 2; a perfect fifth means you multiply by 3/2.  What else can we do?\n\nMultiplying by 4 is just two octaves.  Multiplying by 5 is new, though.  If you multiply by 5 you get a note, and if you divide that by 4, you get a note in the same octave.  That note is C#4, a major third above A3.  The frequency is 275 Hz.\n\nSo now we have the octave, with a ratio of 2; we have the perfect fifth, with a ratio of 3/2, and we have the major third, with a ratio of 5/4.  With this, we can build some scales!\n\nLet's start at C instead of A to make things simpler.  The interval from C to the same C is 1 (it's the same note, so the frequency is just multiplied by 1); from C to the C above, it's 2.  Let's keep all the notes in this interval, OK?  Go up a fifth, and you have G at 3/2.  Another fifth, and you have D at 9/4, but we want it in the same octave, so divide by 2 to get 9/8.  Go down a fifth from C instead, and you have F at 2/3, but you want it between 1 and 2, so go up an octave and you have 4/3.  Go down another fifth and you have Bb at 8/9, but again, you want it between 1 and 2, so it's 16/9.\n\nFrom C, go up a major third to get E at 5/4.  From G, go up a major third to get B at 15/8 (from now on, I'm going to multiply or divide by 2 as necessary without telling you).  From D, go up a major third to get F# at 45/32.  From F, go up a major third to get A at 5/3.  From Bb, go up a major third to get D at 10/9.  From...\n\n...wait.  Wait wait wait.  Didn't I get 9/8 for D before?  And now I have 10/9?  What's going on?  Well, to get the 9/8 D, I went up two fifths from C.  To get the 10/9, I went *down* two fifths from C then up a major third.  THESE ARE DIFFERENT!  The interval between them is 81/80, also called a *syntonic comma* (small intervals between notes with the same name are usually called commas).\n\n**Just Intonation** (or **JI** for short) is when you use these frequency ratios to form your scale.  They're mostly fractions involving small whole numbers, and they're all multiples of the first three primes, 2, 3, and 5.  This is also called 5-limit just intonation, since the biggest prime used is 5; you could have 11-limit by also using 7 and 11, or 29-limit by also throwing in 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29, or any other p-limit for some prime p (2-limit is really boring, though, since it's just one note and its octaves).  But JI has a big flaw, and it's that there are sometimes many different ways to get the same note.  When you build your keyboard using just intonation, you have to make a decision about what notes you'll want to play in tune.  If you want your G major chord to sound in tune, you'll need to pick your D to be 9/8, but if you want your Bb major chord to sound in tune, you'll want to pick your D to be 10/9.  As a result, some keys sound different from other keys.\n\nFor centuries, musicians were trying to figure out ways of making the *bad* keys less bad.  The JI system I described is 5-limit, meaning that fifths and thirds are both in tune, but if you switch to 3-limit, then only fifths will be in tune.  This is called Pythagorean tuning, and it's actually really simple.  You start with C as 1, and you go up and down in fifths.  G is 3/2, D is 9/8, A is 27/16, E is 81/64, etc.  Notice that the major third from C to E was 5/4 in 5-limit JI, but in Pythagorean tuning, it's 81/64.  It sounds much higher, so the C major chord of C E G isn't as in tune.  Anyway, you generate your notes up to G#, and go down from C to F, Bb, and Eb.  The entire chromatic scale is therefore Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G#, going around the Circle of Fifths... except that they don't line up.  You *could* go on and include Ab on the left side, but the Ab and G# are very close to each other, so you stop at 12 notes.  The Ab and G# are not so close that they don't sound horrible together, though, and as a result, you do *not* want to play a G# major chord!  That would be G# C Eb, and the G# and Eb clash horribly.  This is known as the wolf fifth, because it's the only fifth that's out of tune.  The interval between the Ab and G# is also a comma, known as the *Pythagorean comma*, and its value is 3^12 /2^19 (I don't have my powers of 3 memorized that high, but the denominator is 524288).\n\nEnter **equal temperament** (**ET**).  In the 1700's, they took that wolf fifth and tuned it, while detuning everything else.  They made the fifth a tiny bit out of tune, and *tempered out* that Pythagorean comma by spreading it over the entire scale.  They made it so that those 12 notes were in an actual circle, 12 equally-spaced notes.  JI musicians weren't happy about this compromise, because while in JI, some things were in tune and some weren't, in ET, *nothing* is in tune (except octaves).  But the advantages of being able to sound reasonably good in any key outweighed the disadvantages, and **12TET** -- 12-tone equal temperament -- became the dominant tuning in the Western world.  Now you could play Bb major and D major chords in the same piece, and you could even play Ab chords!  The cost of this is that thirds are much higher than in JI.  The octave is a factor of 2, so a half step is 1/12 of that, or 2^(1/12) .  The major third is four half steps, or 2^(4/12) = 2^(1/3) = 1.260... while the JI major third is 5/4 = 1.25.  The Pythagorean major third is 81/64 = 1.266..., which is even higher.  So you lose that really great feeling of the in-tune third.  (If you go to [my synth](http://offtonic.com/synth), the Quarter-Comma Meantone tuning has the in-tune third, and 19-TET comes close to it too; you can also just add a 5/4 interval to any note to hear it).\n\nSo that's JI.

{"body": "&gt;Will simply print whatever the string representation of the penultimate curried function is\n\nYes, but not as you might expect. For Haskell to print anything it must first have a string representation of it. In the standard libraries, this is the job of the show function.

What if I were to type this?\n\n    &gt; putStrLn (show (addFourNumbers 1 2 3))\n    \n    &lt;interactive&gt;:1:11:\n        No instance for (Show (a0 -&gt; a0))\n          arising from a use of `show'\n        Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (a0 -&gt; a0))\n        In the first argument of `putStrLn', namely\n          `(show (addFourNumbers 1 2 3))'\n        In the expression: putStrLn (show (addFourNumbers 1 2 3))\n        In an equation for `it':\n            it = putStrLn (show (addFourNumbers 1 2 3))\n    \nAhhhh! GHCi screams at us! It's telling us that there is no instance of the class Show for the function (a0 -&gt; a0), due to our use of the function show. In simpler terms, it is telling us that it does not know how to convert a function into a string.

{"body": "While I agree that everyone should be their own person blah blah blah blah.. lets look at this for the long game shall we. \n\n1.) You are from two completely different backgrounds. You were from an upper middle class background and she was from a lower background. Whenever you have a fight, she will call you a rich spoiled brat and you will think (hopefully not say) that she is so low class. Especially when she wants to fight you on the front lawn. \n\n2.) What about getting married? I know you're just dating, but dating usually needs to lead somewhere, otherwise it's just fucking.. and generally speaking, people get tired of just doing that. So you get married, your family hates her and dispises her family.. that's going to make every single interaction awkward to say the least. \n\n3.) What about kids? She may be used to running through the trees like a hillbilly but you sir, you have class and style, you're children shalnt get their toddler sized tuxes dirty, afterall your Opair will see to it that they are inside for their latin class. But your wife will wonder why her children can't learn the family trade of bootlegging moonshine and tell you about it. \n\n4.) Money situations.. what is she really bringing to the relationship? I mean.. her family is dirt poor compared to yours, what do they have to trade in terms of a dowery for your family taking their daughter. A few chickens and a rear fender to a 1957 Chevy? Not a fair trade you know? \n\n5.) What happens if you're not bad boy enough. I know it can hardly seem possible that you, biggest baddest mofo in a cardigan sweater and tennis shorts, could not be the best badass in the world to her, but what happens when Smasher \"The Basher\" Motherless and his biker buddies want to take her out for a ride on the Ol' hog? Sure she'll be shocked when it is really a motorcycle and not, in fact, a barnyard animal, but that'll only make your case worse. You can't really compete with that... \n\n6.) So what happens when you realize that your entire family hates her for no better reason than her family? It'll happen, I know.. I've seen it countless times and not just on episodes of The Gilmore Girls (They really do talk so fast.. yet so true...). Your Girlfriend (soon to be your wife, baby mama, FWB) is going to have to win over E V E R Y O N E!... And that won't be easy.. Sure she is street smart... she had to be growing up in the back country, or the mean streets (just pick one it really doesn't matter). But her ability to find the queen of hearts out of 4 other cards everytime/hogtie a young bucking bronco/find you all the mushrooms money can't or won't buy, really won't impress your family. \n\n\n7.) But what about you, can you deal with her family? Do you like squirell for breakfast, Oppossum for Lunch and Racoon Surprise for dinner (or supper/mouth feedin' as they call it)? Can you deal with knowing that these people will be forever linked to you and your family. Knowing that 3 out of 2 of them have warrents out for their arrest (see.. grandma don't count.. she's an illegal.. so the household occupancy is only 2..)? What about the fact that you don't enjoy tractor pulls, or living the trailer life?\n\nThese are all things you need to look at.. Sure this entire post has been filled with Hyperbole.. but they are still somewhat valid concerns that perhaps you really haven't looked into. The fact is, you do have completely different backgrounds and you are possibly getting into a situation where you will be mixing these two worlds, when the only ones who really might want it is you and her.

Buffalo repeated any number of times (with only the first one capitalized) is a valid sentence.\n\nI'll only be using buffalo the verb (intimidate) and buffalo the noun (animals), as that's all that is needed.\n\nFirst, some base cases:\n\n1) \"Buffalo.\" (verb) is a valid imperative sentence. It only uses the verb, and it is a command ordering the listener(s) to intimidate.\n\n2) \"Buffalo buffalo.\" (noun verb) is a valid sentence. It states that the animals intimidates.\n\n3) \"Buffalo buffalo buffalo.\" (noun verb noun) is a valid sentence. It states that the animals intimidate animals.\n\nAny valid sentence with **n** instances of the word buffalo, at least 1 of which is a noun, can be used to make a valid sentence with **n + 2** instances. This is because the noun can be modified with the phrase \"buffalo buffalo\" (noun verb), like in Franks2000inchTV's example. Where the noun \"buffalo\" was in the sentence is now \"buffalo buffalo buffalo\" (noun noun verb), meaning animals that animals intimidate. You can use this and the length 2 and 3 cases to make a sentence of arbitrary length where the only word is buffalo.\n\nA couple of examples:\n\n5) \"Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.\" (n n v v n) - Animals, that animals intimidate, intimidate animals.\n\n7) \"Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.\" (n n n v v v n) - Animals, that animals, that animals intimidate, intimidate, intimidate animals.\n\n23) \"Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.\" (n n n n n n v v v v v v n n n n n n v v v v v) - Animals, that animals, that animals, that animals, that animals, that animals intimidate, intimidate, intimidate, intimidate, intimidate, intimidate animals, that animals, that animals, that animals, that animals, that animals intimidate, intimidate, intimidate, intimidate, intimidate.\n\nIt's tough to make sense of, but it's valid!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339011950", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This is what lets `conduit` avoid the need for all of the `Maybe` wrapping in `pipes`.\n\nAnyway, it's easy to construct a helper function to create infinite consumers in this new approach, e.g.:\n\n    awaitForever :: Monad m =&gt; (i -&gt; Pipe l i o r m r') -&gt; Pipe l i o r m r\n    awaitForever f =\n        self\n      where\n        self = awaitE &gt;&gt;= either return (\\i -&gt; f i &gt;&gt; self)\n\nUsing this, it's easy to implement something like `mapM_`:\n\n    mapM_ :: Monad m =&gt; (i -&gt; m ()) -&gt; Pipe l i o r m r\n    mapM_ f = awaitForever (lift . f)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339171406", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

In other words, I'm looking for something with the type:\n\n    Pipe l i o u m i\n\nHowever, you are right that this does make folds easier to write.  Perhaps these should be considered two separate categories with separate purposes (i.e. the `pipes` one is not biased towards any pipe in the chain returning, whereas yours is a fold-like category that biases towards the downstream pipe).

What this means is that every combination of numbers (say things like \"28591049\" or \"1938\" etc.) can be found in that order, somewhere in the digits of Pi.  Information, in this sense, is akin to computer information, which is stored as a finite string of 0s and 1s (binary which can be used to represent numerical strings).  All information and software that will ever exist (until the computational paradigm changes from what we know now) will exist in a finite sequence of 0s and 1s.

{"body": "Okay, so you've heard things like C major, F minor, B minor and E major before.\n\nThe letter designates what note is the root of the song.\n\nWhat's a root?\n\n'DO' is the root in its key and in its major scale that we've all heard and sung: Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do. You'll notice it sounds good to end a melody on the Do, which again, is the root. It's not a rule that you have to end on the root, but being the root means that it tends to sound good/right to end it there and often to start it there too... it's like the anchor of the song.\n\nThe word that comes after the letter (i.e., minor or major) largely dictates the tone of the piece. If you grew up on western music (as opposed to the stuff that's rooted in traditional music from Asia or exotic locations), minor tends to sound more serious/somber/dark/gloomy whereas major tends to sound more upbeat/fun/cute/bright).\n\nWhat's actually creating the difference in tone is usually the various patterns in the scales upon which the keys are based (but explaining that is another thing entirely).\n\nSuffice to say, the C major scale is C D E F G A B C and so that means for the most part, most of the notes played in a song that's in the key of C major are likely to be those same notes as opposed to notes like Db (d flat) or F# (f sharp). Or basically, songs in C major are usually all played on the white keys on a piano and often start and end on the white key just to left of the pair of black keys.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339211536", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The idea of a black hole has been around since the late 1700’s. A geologist by the name of John Michell wrote a letter about an object so massive that even light could not escape it. Since that, the mysteries of science have revealed to the public that black holes do in fact exist and no, light cannot escape it. \n\nNow how does this effect humans and the meaning of life? Well, most people try to constitute their existence by what they leave behind. Their legacy, if you will. How many European countries can trace back there history and heritage over a period of a thousand years? That basic security of knowing that somehow, some way us as an individual will do something that will be remember long after we are is what drives the majority of actions.  \n\nI present to you social networking sites. Why have they become so popular? Why do sites like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter…etc. have such a large user base? Parallel to that, why is the internet as successful as it is, or any other form of communication for that matter? The easy answer is because it is a means to share your life with someone, to laugh about good times, to feel important.  Let’s dig a little deeper than that. Why are having those feelings so important? Because it cements our lives together with someone else, so that ten, twenty, or even fifty years down the line we have a story to remember and tell. The act of sharing is our way of leaving behind a legacy, thus fulfilling the previously stated meaning of life.\n\nWith the discovery of the black hole however, this idea is being slowly but surely disintegrated. As previously stated the meaning of life is the legacy you leave behind. However, with a black hole in the picture you can leave nothing behind. The gravitational pull consumes everything in its path without remorse, without thought. Your entire life and all its legacy will be erased the instant a black hole decides to consume the earth.  It is simply a matter of time. \n\nSo what then becomes the new meaning to life? A legacy is nothing without people to remember it, and a black hole will destroy all the people, places, and things you might have ever interacted with. History has proven that anytime a society feels threated enough they will do whatever it takes to remove what threatens them. How does one fight a black hole? Every theoretical or actual interaction with a black hole simply shows the proof over again, that its gravitational pull consumes all caught in its path. How do you fight an enemy that cannot be beat? The base psychological response is you do not, you run. Fight or Flight. However, a black hole does not care if you run. It will simply bide it’s time and eventually all matter in the universe will be consumed by it. \n\nIf a person cannot fight or flee verses an enemy, what happens? They are beaten. Therefore, the grim truth to this world is that there is no meaning to life other than to eventually be consumed by a black hole. It sounds hopeless, but humans have always known they were finite since birth. We know that eventually our life will end, so we tried to make our life worthwhile by leaving a legacy. Black holes are just the death of all things. Does this really change then how we go about our thought process? I leave that to you to decide dear reader. Instead of looking for the answers to the meaning of life in a paper, go out, experience your life, and make your own meaning. \n\nTLDR: Black holes have absolutely no effect on the meaning of life, or absolutely every effect on the meaning of life.\nI need 1000 words for this essay so now im just going to type a bunch of I’s until I hit 1k.

Challenge: Make it through the entire album without skipping any tracks and more importantly without losing your mind. To those beginners out there, it is irrelevant how many hits/tabs/doses you ingest, please remember that LSD is a sacrament, a catalyst to promote discovery. After you realize where you've been taken on your trip is much different place you knew before you left, you can understand that this drug is and can be more magic than anyone person can process. What I'm saying is simply be careful because it can open doors you may not want open. My Brother and I grew up in the nineties, we ate so much acid we have become awakened, enlightened and gifted. It can be a burden to see through someone to a point where first impressions seem like watching a flash movie of the person's entire life and what can be disturbing even more is seeing a person's true motive. It can make relationships challenging. These earned abilities can come and do come at a price. Once you go on this trip, you can never go back. You can look in a book of pictures with your family, when you're 30 and in one picture you're smiling, the picture next to it there is a picture of you looking through the camera. You can tell that there is innocence lost and to someone who has never tripped may still have that cheesy smile. Ignorance is bliss. If you are reading this and you are curious about acid or other hallucinogens, go read some books. Break away from influences, read about Timothy Leary, the League of Spiritual Development, The acid test, ask family members or others you may trust. If you decide to go on a trip just do yourself a favor and don't make any big decisions while tripping. Tell the person, \"I'm a bit overwhelmed right now, so I'd like to respond later\" and if you see someone having a bad trip, don't ever ask them,\"What's wrong\"?, instead embrace the situation softly and tell that person to stop fighting the trip, let it run it's course. It will be the single most intense moment in your life. Well I'm surprised I wrote so much, I'm only writing this as experience and information learned from the perspective of a 34 year old. In a nutshell, LSD is an awakening of the senses inside a human. The first are the 5 known senses, touch, taste, smell, sight &amp; sound and second are combinations of the known 5, then the experience is broken down into very fundamental actions &amp; reactions. Vibration, shapes, colors, speech then throw in extremely complicated formulas, calculation and reasoning abilities. Interaction between two individual realities become distorted at best and if you're ever sitting around a campfire and girl starts looking at you, don't do something like pick up a funny looking rock...... it will be hot and burn the fuck out of your hand, ultimately ruining your entire night and almost will definitely send you in t o.

{"body": "ONLINE INFORMATION WARFARE\n\nThis is my area of expertise and what I spend a great deal of my personal time doing.\n\nWhy should I choose Online Information Warfare?\nBecause the growth of Satanism is very important and it's a very rewarding type of warfare as you'll be able to see some direct results of what you're doing. When I was spamming Godlikeproductions.com for months on end, the groups were growing at 2x to 3x their normal rate. I've seen two newbies post in the groups who I know got here through me.\n\nWhat makes a good Spiritual Warrior?\nCleverness isn't necessary but it can really help in certain places and situations. Knowing infiltrator/troll tactics, and being able to spot them in the groups, is important and as you can use these tactics against them.\n\nTargets:\n\n1. Jewtube\n\nWhy:\nIf you only fight in one place, I would make it Youtube. It's super easy, effective, and I've not been banned even once. This is where I do 90% of my fighting now. It is without a doubt the easiest target.\n\nHow:\nSign up for an account, then on the left side of your profile screen you will see several tabs labeled 'Popular', 'Trending', etc.. Click on these tabs then proceed to click on any number of videos in those tabs and spam the comment boxed or those videos. If you wanna go crazy spam the related vidoes, executing combos for massive damage. You can go like this for hours and sometimes I do.\n\nStrategy:\nYou will have to disguide the link as Youtube doesn't allow posting links. See me example spam below for an example of how to do this. Generally you want your spam to target the audience of the specicific video. My example spam below which is not copywrited in any way will work for anything.\n\nJoyofSatan(dot)com CHRISTIANITY EXPOSED AS FALSE AT THIS LINK. SATAN PROVEN TO BE OUR REAL CREATOR GOD THROUGH GENETIC ENGINEERING. LEARN HOW TO CONTACT SATAN.\n \n2. Godlikeproductions.com\n\nWhy:\nIt was a goldmine and probably still is. When I was fighting here most of the time our membership growth accelerated more than double. It is that good. This place is a massive conspiracy forum with over a million unique visitors a day, and you don't even need to sign up to post. A lot of the people there are already familiar with Sumerian 'mythology' through Sitchen etc. so make sure you mention Enki with whatever strategy you use. This place is also a hotbed of xtians AND enemy agents. This is generally where the lower level enemy agents go to create trouble and if you see their threads make to post in them and laugh at them also tell them they'll be tortured forever.\n\nHow:\nEasy, you don't even need an account to post.\n\nStrategy:\nYou almost NEED to know how to change/hide your IP for this because you are going to get banned. Even if you can't change your IP this is still a great place to get in one solid hit.\n\nThere used to be two viable strategies but now there's probably just one as the admin hates us and will ban you. What I used to do was put info in my sig and just post normally letting my sig do the work, generally just making fun of xtians and enemy agents. This tactic may still be viable if you keep a low profile. Avoid threads the admin (Trinity) and mods are in.\n\nImportant Note:\nLinking the site will get you an autoban so HIDE THE LINK. J o y o f S a t a n . c o m will work. Remember if you can't change your IP then once you're banned you're done at this place, so make your first and possibly only strike count.\n\n3. Yahoo Answers (http://answers.yahoo.com/)\n\nWhy:\nThis is HP Don's preferred spot I think and it's proven effective. I don't have any personal experience with it though but I will share what I think are viable strategies.\n\nHow:\nI'm not sure if you can post anonymously, if not sign up for an account. You may want to make dummy accounts as well.\n\nStrategy:\nI have no personal experience here but apparently the place is moderated and sometimes it can be difficult to get your posts through. Try to figure out what the mods don't like and work around it any way you can. Either answer people's questions with quotes and links and whatever or use dummy accounts to ask your own fake questions and answer them with other dummy accounts.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339368272", "subreddit": "spiritualsatanism", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I really like ChoGath jungle, I find it pretty fun and his Q and Ult are very satisfying.\n\nRunes I use Movespeed Quints Aspd Marks. Usually go 0/21/9 for Masteries. I usually start with boots/3Pots and get your E at level 1, I usually go E Q E W for first 4 levels. Then work on R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q.\n\nI usually start at Wolves/Blue and do a standard clear and gank at level 4. Though you can also gank earlier since you take your Q anyway. You can also start at Red since Cho really is not blue dependent at all. If you do start red you probably do want to do a level 2 gank.\n\nGanking with Cho can be a bit tricky. Even hotshot said that nobody should ever get hit by a Rupture, but there are ways to ensure it can land easier. Gank for someone who has some kind of CC, even if it is a slow, it will make for a much easier time. If you dont land your Q then your ganks are pretty lack luster :(. Wait for them to CC and then Rupture, make sure to lead with so they don't just walk out of it, or it forces them to make a decision, sometimes they can dodge it but the only way for them to dodge it is to walk the opposite direction they want to be. \n\nAnyway in terms of items I usually will build Philo/Hog &gt; Wits. From there I decide what I need. If i need more MR, Abyssal is a great item on him, if I need armor, Randiuns and Frozen heart are great. Eventually you want to upgrade Philo into Shurelya's most likely (or into Eleisa's if you didnt take Merc's). Your main job is to be a disruptive tank, Silence those APs, Knockup people, finish people off with your Ult.\n\nAlso sometime to note about playing Cho Jungle, he is a pretty damn good counter jungler. While he cant usually fight the jungle 1 one 1, he can steal camps with ease. I usually just try to steal their Red/Blue whenever I know they are up. Just keep an eye on lanes and you can give their Jungler a hard time. Make sure you have at Smite/Feast up and and it is impossible for you to be Out-Smited (if you time it properly). Tip for stealing stuff, Start ulting, there is a bit of delay before the damage goes through so during this delay you want to smite. If timed well you do 1700 damage instantly. You can also use this for stealing or securing Dragon/Baron. You can also silence the enemy jungle/knock them up to make it difficult for them to try to smite it as well. Using smite and feast to steal objectives is mostly just about patience, it is better to do it too late then too early.\n\nGL, hope you enjoy Cho Jungle. Hotshot has recently streamed some where he does Cho jungle so if you want to pick up some ideas go ahead and watch him (he is probably the best Cho you'll ever watch IMO :p) ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339393948", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

F E T S O I L C T T S.\n\nIt may be possible to translate Gordon's code to an alphabet of some sort, or even (as suggested) Pitman shorthand for certain syllables, but if you get the right answer somehow, you may not even know and skip right over it.  Are there any similar pieces of correspondence or literature from his contemporary lodge members or his personal friends that use a similar cipher?  Was Gordon himself known to have used a variant of shorthand?  Knowing that he was a revolutionary-era preacher, I make the assumption that he understood some Latin and Greek and possibly Hebrew, which explains some of the Greek letters that show up (though as a Hebrew speaker myself, I recognized no Hebrew characters in any of its alphabets with the exception of the letter yud which is a tiny mark that may just have been another small symbol.  The yud does, however, feature prominently in (I think) the fourteenth degree of what is today's Scottish Rite, with which Gordon was probably well acquainted).\n\nLet me know if I can be of any assistance.

The White Paper was extremely contentious with the Zionist leadership because it mentioned nothing of partition, that there would be democratic institution with an Arab majority ultimately setting future Jewish immigration figures but with Jewish rights as Palestinian citizens constitutionally protected. **FACT**.\n\nI even spelled it out for you that Britain abstained in the General Assembly vote and that you needed to provide a *Security Council* vote on the resolution.  Even that didn't sink in.\n\nI've only responded because I did say if you could find the relevant Security Council resolution, which I know not to exist, then I'd buy you a racehorse.  I owed it to you to check what you'd linked, already knowing exactly how you'd failed.  Reading comprehension again - looking for SECURITY COUNCIL not General Assembly.  \n\nI'll even go one further, I quote you the actual GENERAL ASSEMBLY resolution:\n\n             \"Takes note of the declaration by the mandatory Power that it plans to \n              complete its evacuation of Palestine by 1 August 1948;  RECOMMENDS \n              to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to \n              all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, \n              with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition \n              with Economic Union set out below;\"\n\nSee that, only a recommendation.

Not one Security Council resolution relating to the crisis in Palestine endorses GA resolution 181.  The General Assembly has no power or authority on its own other than to make recommendations.  They, the Security Council, postponed discussion on it and it never came back.\n\nIpso facto: there was no Security Council resolution for the partition of Palestine and the UN did not create Israel.  Israel was created when Zionists living in Palestine declared independence and fought a War of Independence.  Whether morally right or wrong is irrelevant to this.  It is what happened.

{"body": "That's right; this scale is identical to the Aeolian scale that we're all (hopefully) familiar with! Keep in mind, if you look back at the Ionian and Dorian scales trying to find a similarity to their modern modal counterpoints, you won't find a direct correlation, (every modern mode has the same intervals as the Greek Aeolian scale). The Greek Aeolian scale is made up of the same two tetrachords, and the tonics of these tetrachords would be E and A in the above example, but since E leads up to A by virtue that A is always above E in a tetrachord, A was heard as the tonic to the Greeks. Additionally, because of octave equivalence, and the fact that the scale repeats every octave, it was also acceptable for the bottom note in the top tetrachord to resolve down a fifth, rather than up a fourth. In the history of academic music, this is the first time that the concept of a tonic was introduced. The Greek idea of the tonics relating to tetrachords is very different from our modern idea of a tonic, however. \n\nInstead of a tonic, the Greeks had a similar concept that is best referred to a different term: the *mese*. The note that was at the top of a tetrachord and a whole step below the bottom of another tetrachord is the mese. A major difference between Greek music and modern music is that, through all of this, Greek music was not harmonized in the modern sense of the word; therefore, when the mese was missing, the melody would lack direction to the Greeks.\n\nNow, ancient Greek modes are a little difficult to understand, but only because mode has come to mean something different. Let's consider the modern Ionian mode in C, which consists of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C. To the modern listener, a melody will imply that C is the most important note. However, if the Greeks were to consider a mode made up of the same notes, they would find the notion of C being the most important note to be ridiculous, as A is CLEARLY the mese. But, if this was the case, then why didn't they just only use the Aeolian mode?\n\nBy the time that the Aeolian scale was commonplace, the enharmonic and chromatic genera were becoming less and less used. As such, the Aeolian scale came to represent THE scale in Greek music. This is completely different to us, as we're familiar with different scales, different modes, different sets of notes, and in short, many ways that pitch classes can be organized into discrete collections. The Greeks, by contrast, had one. And in that scale, the same note was always the mese. And since they had no harmony, the only way to return to a feel of tonic would be to have the melody repeat the mese. So, therefore, in a Greek mode, the scale C D E F G A B C would be an actual set of 8 notes of which the entire song would contain only those 8 notes, and not any notes higher than the top C or lower than the bottom C. Throughout all of this, A would be the mese, and sang the most. In short, Greek modes don't specify a collection of pitch classes; they specify a collection of pitches. Hopefully that distinguishment is clear. In the ancient Greek tradition, the mode that would have the same intervals as modern Ionian is actually referred to as Lydian.\n\nNow, consider the effects of singing a Greek mode that spans about an octave. Because the mese is not in the same position in different modes, it can be relatively lower or higher in the human vocal range. As such, one of the Greek philosophers (I believe Aristotle) speculated that, when the mese is in the center of the singing voice, this represents temperence and moderation. A mese of higher pitch would represent songs that were higher energy, and thought to be more emotional; a mese of lower pitch would correspondingly be associated with self-indulgence.\n\nSomeone eventually realized that, if a two-octave Aeolian scale was used, then every mode would be a subset of that scale, and this scale was adopted, being called the Greater Perfect System. This was made by joining four tetrachords in the Aeolian fashion. Since there is an A now at the bottom, middle, and top of the Greater Perfect System, it's easier to keep the mese in mind, which led to some greater melodic freedom. Because of this, the notes started to become less important due to their position in a tetrachord, and instead began relating to the mese. Naturally, this represents a merging of the original idea of \"mese\" with the modern idea of tonic, and as such, the word \"tonic\" became more applicable from that point onward. When Ptolemy came onto the scene in Alexandria, he did some work with modes that reflected this change in the musical academic attitude of the time. His new modes allowed the tonic to not necessarily be the mese, and therefore, a new realm of melodic possibilities was possible, and the Christian Church adopted this use of tonic when it began propagating its own music, which led to a new era that I feel quite uneasy trying to say anything about and hoping to maintain any sort of academic stability.\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nI was going to add more about some Greek instruments, and a more detailed explanation of some of the poetic meters in early Greek music, but I've been at this for about five hours on and off, so I'm ready to give it a rest and listen to what you have to say.

{"body": "The key of c major is always the key of c major (c major is c d e f g a b) The notes that make up c manor are also the notes that make up A minor. But A minor starts on A. You probably know this. Certain instruments are more or less designed to be played in certain keys, but it's more true to say that it's just easier to play them in those keys. Not an expert on specifics here but I know woodwind and brass can be pickier than strings (I think? Lol) \n\nSo here's a shortcut to figuring shit out on your own. Pentatonic scales. Essentily there are two. Major and minor. For major pentatonic you take the standard manor scale - root M2 M3 P4 P5 M6 M7 and take away the P4 and M7. So it's just 5 notes, hence PENTAtonic. For the minor scale you take away the m2 and m6. These instantaneously revolutionized my ability to jam along to music with a bass. Just last night too actually. Not sure how to implement it into guitar regarding chords and whatnot but for soloing and lead playing, pentatonic are bread and butter. \n\nThe other skill you're gonna wanna develop is figuring out the key of a song that is currently playing. This is an awful lot like finding the lightswitch in a dark room you've never been in before. Feel around. Listen for notes that sound \"right\" and then as you discover more of those notes look to see what kind of scale pattern they're fitting into (learn what the scale patterns look like first. Not very hard, just grueling. Like learning the alphabet was) once you have a good guess as to what key a song is in just go up and down the scale in sync with the rhythm of the song. It's pretty hard to make this sound bad. I may have missed some things or something so if something doesn't make sense please do inquire further. I Love teaching.

As you may know, the formula for the major scale is simply 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, which means starting with the root (1) you just go through the alphabet until you get back to your root (which would be the octave). It also means that you don't sharpen or flatten any of the notes. As an example lets look at C major, which has no sharps or flats in its key. The C major scale is simply C D E F G A B. Now that is going to be the basis for our modes. So like it says up there, the second mode is Dorian, and since in the key of C major D is the second note, it will be D Dorian in this case. So now just start from D and go through the rest of the scale and you will get D E F G A B C. You can do the same now with the rest of the modes. However, that's not the only way to look at them. Each mode also has its own \"formula\" like the major scale does (meaning the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7). This is another way to figure out any mode in any key, and a quick google search should turn up all of those for you. Hope that helps, if anything needs clarification or expansion just let me know, I like explaining theory haha.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339654513", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a kind of complicated subject, because history has done weird stuff to minor scales.\n\nFirst of all, you're familiar with the major scale, yes?  C major is C D E F G A B C.  Now, to get the minor scale, you lower the 7th, the 3rd, and the 6th: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C.  You're pretty much done.\n\nExcept that composers in the 17th century (well, and before, and after) felt that Bb going to C was not OK.  Western music is based around a V7-I progression, which in C major would be G7 - C, and the power of the G7 comes from the devil in music, the tritone, the interval B - F, where the B wants to resolve to C and the F wants to resolve to E.  The B is called the leading tone because it wants to resolve to C, the tonic, so badly.  Well, the minor scale doesn't have a leading tone, which means that the equivalent, Gm - Cm, doesn't have that power.  The solution is therefore to raise the lowered 7th in those chords, so the progression becomes G7 - Cm, with the B natural in the G chords.  This is called the harmonic minor scale, but it is never played as a scale.  Also, the bVII and bIII chords have the b7 in them, and they're perfectly fine chords to use in minor music, so it isn't true that all chords in minor come from the harmonic minor scale; really, it's just the V chords.\n\nAside from this harmonic issue, there's a melodic issue: when you're playing a minor scale, say, ...G Ab Bb C, the Bb is going up to the C, but that used to be heard as weak, so instead, they'd raise the Bb to B natural: ...G Ab B C.  That fixes the Bb - C problem, but now there's a huge augmented second between the Ab and the B, so the Ab is raised to A natural as well: ...G A B C.  Going down from C to Bb is not a problem, though, so these alterations are only done when the melody is rising, not when it's falling.  As a result, if you were to actually play a complete minor scale up and down, you'd play C D Eb F G A B C Bb Ab G F Eb D C.  This is known as melodic minor.  It has interesting effects on harmony as well, because if you need to harmonize the A natural, you'd probably use either a Dm or an F major chord, neither of which is usually in the minor scale.\n\nIn real life, the 17th- and 18th-century composers weren't all that strict about melodic minor, especially since you can always harmonize things differently: while B - C might be harmonized G7 - Cm, Bb - C might be harmonized Eb - Ab, or even Gm - Fm: the minor v is not disallowed; it's just not allowed to resolve to i.  Also, there are often occasions for borrowing from major or modulating -- changing keys.  At the end of a minor piece, the common practice was to end it with a major chord, the third of which is known as the Picardy third.  (This was done almost all of the time, but not actually all of the time; Bach's G#m fugue from Book I of the Well-Tempered Clavier actually ends in a G#m chord, surprisingly!)\n\nIn *modern* music, though, this rule about the Bb to C being bad is completely ignored.  I happen to like Britney Spears's Baby One More Time (I think it's a well-written song, OK?  Oh, shut up), and that features the b7 1 1 melody all the time.  v - i is a common cadential progression (a cadence, very loosely speaking, is a point of arrival in the music), as is bVII - i.  (In C minor, these would be Gm - Cm and Bb - Cm, respectively.)  Basically, it's gotten to where you can use the b7 - 1 thing without issues if you want, and you can also use the natural 7 - 1 thing without issues either.  There's no rule; just do what you think sounds the best.  b7 - 1 sometimes sounds a bit exotic and 7 - 1 sometimes sounds pretty natural.  The only thing you need to watch out for is trying to use both at once -- that will lead to trouble unless you know what you're doing!\n\nActually, G B F Bb is an amazing chord.  The B resolves up to the C and the Bb resolves down, first to the Ab then to the G.

{"body": "Since you don't know much about MUDs I'll explain a little bit. Typically you started out and picked some (usually lengthy) options to make your character. You'd start out in some area and eventually go and fight stuff and do quests. You used n e s w and sometimes up and down to move around, and there were lots of different commands for various actions.\n\nThe combat in MUDs was sequential due to the way the messages were handled. So when something attacked you in an area, it would say \"A large bat bites you for **3** damage!\" and you would write attack into the text box and send it (usually you would spam it and just watch the scroll), until the bat was dead.\n\nEverquest's design goal was basically to make a 3D MUD, and it did that pretty dang well for the time. However, because of that, the combat ended up being basically MUD combat in 3D, which amounts to standing in front of a mob and using your rotation of hotbar abilities (what used to be text commands in MUDs) until the mob dies. The MMO industry has blindly copy pasted this design across almost every MMORPG of thel ast decade, with minor modifications. And that's a really sad thing. Luckily developers are finally breaking out of that mindset because of the dissatisfaction of players in such copypasta MMOs.\n\nThe appeal of MMOs back in the days of their conception was always to take *fun gameplay* and make it massively multiplayer. To illustrate how backwards things have become, I'll point to (now defunct) Ensemble Studio's never-released Halo MMO. Regardless of whether or not you like Halo, you would imagine a Halo MMO to have some sort of FPS combat, right? Because Halo's gameplay shines at being an FPS obviously. Well, nope, that's not what they were doing. Instead it was going to be a hotbar combat MMO like WoW, complete with psychic \"casters\" of spells. \n\nThe shoe-horning of the 3D MUD combat into every setting imaginable over the past decade is a plague on the MMO industry that I'm happy to see die.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339784470", "subreddit": "MMORPG", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Hexadecimal (hex means 6, dec means 10, 10+6 = 16, \"hexadecimal\" means 16 symbol numbers).

What do you notice?  Each fret is a semi-tone; you should notice the notes in the minor and major chords have the same spacing between each other.  In other words, C to E and F to A and G to B are the same distance apart.  Similarly, E to G, A to C and B to D are the same space apart.

The weirdest part was that when he was trying to convince people to kill me I was in the living room and they were all in the kitchen.  He kept trying to get me to play more and I just wasn't feeling it.  The game of the night was called murder and after he said the name and everyone understood, he kept saying TO_ _ _ with the blanks being my name but nobody was getting what he said.  I heard them spelling it from the kitchen after a few minutes and yelled out what he was saying.  He laughed and said YES.

I remember clear as day my surgeon saying to me \"when you have the band you will be able to eat a White Castle slider and feel like you've just eaten a porterhouse steak\" - this is NOT TRUE. If your issues with food go deeper than the quantity of the meals you are eating (and my guess is that they do, seeing as you are seeking surgical help) you WILL NOT lose the weight.\n\nI was Banded in March of 2010 at 389lbs. After the surgery I was on a strict liquid to solids progression diet (you will be too) and you will drop weight like crazy. When I made the transition back into solid foods, it was like a child being released into a candy store. I started out on solid foods at 336lbs. Within a year I had gained back all the weight I originally lost. \n\nI spent a year after that blaming the band for my failure. It is *miserable* (I can not emphasize this enough) to not succeed at weight loss after surgical intervention. Everyone in your family and circle of friends knows you had *surgery* to help you lose weight - and you're still fat. It's a horrific level of embarrassment I hope I never have to encounter again.\n\nWhen I finally returned to the Lap Band doctor in November 2011, I was weighing in at 379lbs. Only 10lbs less than my original start weight. I was mortified. The level of denial I was living in was obscene. I started back up on the program suggested - I cut out all fast food, I stopped drinking diet soda. By March of 2012 I was down to 347lbs - I did this by myself. My surgery did not play a role in this weight loss. The only thing I can credit to my surgery is that I have not yet regained what I have managed to lose this year.\n\nIn March I started working out 6x a week - 60 minutes of cardio. Today I weigh 333lbs. I started keto last Monday. My willingness to work this lifestyle is no different than that of my band. My issues are still here. I still struggle to let go of the carbs. It's an addiction I am trying desperately to control and I never fully realized the severity of it until I stepped on that scale at my doctors office in November.\n\nThe point of all this rambling is that you need to make absolutely 100% sure that you are ready to change your life after this surgery. I will be the first to tell you that I did all of the research and read all of the message boards and made several contacts both pre and post surgery. I knew  e v e r y t h i n g  there was to know about the surgery, the Lap Band, and the followup. \n\nKnowing everything, I could not comprehend it not working for me. I did not go into this lightly. I spent a year researching this surgery before I even started broaching the subject with my physician. It was another year before I had gotten the process rolling. The pre-surgical procedures (as you are aware) are not simple. However prepared I was for the surgery, I had no clue how much work it was going to take to actually make this surgery work for me. It took me 2 years to finally kick it into gear, and even now, I attribute 98% of my weight loss to my own will power and drive, and 2% to the band. This is how much of a disappointment this was for me.\n\nI suppose what I am trying to explain is that no matter how \"prepared\" you feel or how \"ready\" you are to make this change, you will not make any progress unless you attack the root of the issue head on, guns blazing. You can not give only a little bit of effort into this. The sleeve WILL stretch if you eat too much. You WILL NOT lose weight if you eat a small amount of high calorie meals (aka sliders). You WILL be emotionally devastated if you have to face family members in the eye and explain why you have not lost any weight, even with surgical intervention.\n\nI try to tell everyone I can about this experience. If you were to ask me the day before my surgery, I would have told you I would be at goal weight within a year. The surgery was my golden ticket. I would finally get the help that I needed to get healthy. This is the biggest mistake I have ever made; thinking you are going to change your addictive mindset with surgery is a terrible, terrible mistake. \n\nYou seem to be very positive about this, and I am glad to hear it. However, I want you to be *very* aware that there are cases where surgery just does not fix the issues that are causing your obesity. I don't know how much you weigh or how severe your weight problem is. I know if I had a chance to do it all over again, I would opt for a malabsorptive option in addition to portion control (ie. DS or GB). I wish I had read something like this before I got my surgery. I was completely under the \"pre-surgical\" veil - I was thrilled to be getting it done, and no one would have been able to tell me it wouldn't work *for me*.\n\nI am not saying GS will not work for you - on the contrary. I think if you are educated and made aware of the chances of failure, you have a shot at being more prepared than many others before you who have gone under the knife with the hopes of a new life on the other side of the anesthesia. I hope that you do not take what I've shared with you as a knock on WLS in general - it's not. And I take full responsibility for my failure to lose weight with the band. I just wanted to share with you the other side of the story. Not all WLS have happy endings with extra skin, size 8, and Onderland. \n\nIf you only take one thing away from my ramblings, please let it be this: prepare yourself as best you can for the *possibility* that the GS will not work for you. If I had been prepared for the fact that my weight loss would not be a sure thing after surgery, I feel that I would have had a much easier journey to a healthier life.\n\nAll of that being said, my obesity has led me to every weight loss related link of the internet, finally landing me here at r/keto. The comradery and support this group offers fellow members is outstanding. I have never encountered a group of people with a singular goal (healthier living) that have been so encouraging to others. It's not a *race* here, it's a long, winding hike up a mountain. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. I've learned so much about myself and the science behind why my body continuously betrays my mind, even with the strictest of intentions. I am slowly but surely beginning to understand the reasons why I am as heavy as I am (and was). It's a beautiful thing, and one thing I know for sure is that the WLS community level of support couldn't touch r/keto's with a 100 foot pole.\n\nI wish you nothing but the best on your journey into WLS and I hope you have taken everything I said as it was intended, and not in a malicious way. I hope you take the time to update us when you are post surgery.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340132082", "subreddit": "keto", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

On the contrary, results of research suggest that lesbian\n&gt;and gay parents are as likely as heterosexual parents to provide supportive and healthy environments for their children. . . . Overall, results of research suggest that the development, adjustment, and well-being of children with lesbian and gay parents do not differ\n&gt;markedly from that of children with heterosexual parents.\n\nAPA resolution.\n\n&gt;“No differences in adolescents’ psychosocial adjustment,” including depressive symptoms, anxiety, and self-esteem; no differences in grade-point averages or problems in school.\n&gt;Adolescents with same-sex parents reported feeling more connected to school. The authors found\n&gt;that “it was the qualities of adolescent-parent relationships rather than the structural features of\n&gt;families (for example, same- versus opposite-sex parents) that were significantly associated with\n&gt;adolescent adjustment. . . . Across a diverse array of assessments, we found that the personal,\n&gt;family, and school adjustment of adolescents living with same-sex parents did not differ from that\n&gt;of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents.”\nWainwright, Russell, and Patterson (2004)\n\n: “Children reared by lesbian mothers appear to be functioning well and do not experience\nnegative psychological consequences arising from the nature of their family environment.” After\nthe authors controlled for initial differences between groups (age of children, number of siblings)\nand the number of statistical comparisons made, “the only finding that remained significant . . .\nwas greater smacking of children by fathers than by co-mothers.”\nGolombok and others (2003)\n\nChildren’s emotional and behavior adjustment “did not differ” between lesbian and opposite-sex families, and “boys and girls born in lesbian mother families showed similar gender-role\nbehaviour compared to boys and girls born in heterosexual families.” The quality of parents’ relationship with each other did not differ across the two family types, nor did the quality of interaction between children and biological parents. “However, one striking difference was found between lesbian and heterosexual families: social mothers [that is, nonbiological lesbian parents]\nshowed greater interaction with their children than did fathers.”\nBrewaeys and others (1997)\n\nThe scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has been generally consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents,[3][4][5] despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families.[wiki]\n\n^ a b c Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association\n^ a b c d \"Elizabeth Short, Damien W.

{"body": "It's very simple.\n\nScale of C:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nDorian mode of C:\n\nD E F G A B C D\n\nSo it's just the scale of C being played from the 2nd note to the 2nd note.\n\nSame goed for aeolian mode (natural minor)\n\nA B C D E F G A\n\nSo it's the same as the major scale being played from the 6th note to the 6th note.\n\nThe rest of the modes follow the same principle.\n\n\nDo you understand how chords are built? Start with a third, then add another third from there. (So the last note is basically a fifth from the root note, possibly with an alteration btw).\n\nChords in the key of C:\n\nC E G (major)\n\nD F A (minor)\n\nE G B (minor)\n\nF A C (major, sub dominant)\n\nG B D (major, dominant)\n\nA C E (minor, aeolian)\n\nB D F (minor half diminished, G with a B as bass note (G/B is used a lot here)\n\n\n\n\nWhen just playing in the key of C or A minor, all of these chords will sound good. You can randomly throw a few of them together and make chord changes). If you want to solo over them and really know what you're doing, you can use the modes. Or... you can play the scale of C major, or for example A minor pentatonic (!) over *all* the chords in your \"song\". Just keep in mind that certain notes have different functions (sound / feel) depending on what chord you're playing them over.\n\nI hope this helps.

{"body": "Well, you've come to the right place…\n\nI started in 1991 with a standard [10-string](http://stick.com/instruments/stick/) in the [original tuning](http://www.stick.com/interviews/chapman_06_06/). That was a lot of fun, and really split my brain a bit, having my left hand playing bass in 5ths and my right hand doing melodies in 4ths. But it wasn't too bad. I never got great at it though. I did attend a couple of workshops early on, and met other players both in person and via an email list (this was, for all intents and purposes, pre-web).\n\nIn 1998 I moved to Los Angeles and got a little tighter with the Stick community. I helped out at the Stick booth at NAMM for a few years and got to make friends with some really amazing players. I knew I'd never be that good, but it was still fun.\n\nThen Emmett Chapman and Ned Steinberger collaborated on the [NS/Stick](http://stick.com/instruments/ns/), and I ended up borrowing the 2nd prototype for about a year before buying one of the first production run. It had a straight tuning, low to high, instead of the split tuning of the original and Grand Sticks, and could be played either by plucking, strumming or tapping.\n\nFor me, this string arrangement made more sense, because I was still primarily a bass player and didn't really do too much melody stuff. I traded between straight 4ths (low to high: B E A D G C F Bb) and one that I came up with on my own as \"guitar in the middle\" (B E A D G B E A) (though really, that was still an octave lower than guitar range…)\n\nBut ultimately I decided that the body/neck put it more easily in position for traditional bass playing, but the neck was so wide that I wasn't comfortable playing it too much. I liked the straight tuning and role as bass, but thought, if I want to play it like a tapping instrument, I'd be happier with the more vertical arrangement that had been the default mode of the Stick for 30 years.\n\nSo a few years back I saved up and sprung for the SB-8 (trading in the NS/Stick). I kinda envisioned it as \"the last Stick I'd ever need to buy\", so I got a [graphite body](http://stick.com/instruments/xg/), so it would be practically indestructible; the Roland [MIDI pickup](http://stick.com/instruments/midi/gk3/) in case I ever wanted to go that route; and the [PASV4](http://stick.com/instruments/pickups/pasv4/) pickup for regular playing.\n\nThe tone is bright, the range is huge, and it ends up on about 1/3 to 1/2 of my songs on stage with [my band](http://beansbarton.com/bipeds.htm). I really treat it as both hands to play the bass lines, and don't sweat harmonies or leads—I've got an amazing guitarist in my band, so I just keep the bottom line going.\n\nI've just ordered a [preamp pedal](http://stick.com/accessories/stepabout/) that will help me dial in my tone a bit more, and make it easier to A/B switch with my Ibanez (since that has active pickups).

{"body": "I was diagnosed with endometriosis when I was 19. I actually believe right from my first period at age 12 that I had it which I've discussed with my gynecologist who agrees with me. I had really heavy periods from the start, I used to use night-time towels all the time and I'd go through those in a couple of hours. I had so much pain, where you would expect period pain to be but also round my arse, especially going for a poop and in various other abdominal locations.\n\nI went to the drs when I was 14 and got given ibuprofen (thanks, that really helped...?!) and that was the start of continual drs visits about the exact same thing. This was like 15 years ago and even as recently as that there wasn't as much understanding of endo as there is now, it was considered and referrred to as the 'careerwoman's disease', which essentially comes about because it was most commonly diagnosed in older women who were having problems getting pregnant and other gyne symptoms- the longer it goes undiagnosed the more problems it causes because the endo deposits and associated adhesions become more extensive, so I can kind of see why it asn't diagnosed for some time, although the average time from first symptoms to diagnosis is still around 7 years.\n\nSo I continued to half-manage it without any gynae help or diagnosis until I got to about 19, when, having been painfully sexually active for a couple of years, it got too much and I pleaded for a referral to a gynecologist who diagnosed me without so much as an ultrasound, although he did formally diagnose me via the first of (I think, I lose track) 13 laparoscopies. I was diagnosed at stage 2-3, mild being 1, severe being4. He removed all that he could by laser and put me on my first of 3 courses of Zoladex, which is a synthetic hormone designed to turn off the ovaries therefore removing the oestrogen endo needs at source and causing anything remaining to shrink away.\n\nI was OK with it at this point- he advised me to get pregnant sooner rather than later, which is advice I wish I'd heeded more. I felt a lot of anxiety; I felt different to my friends, I saw them go virtually hassle-free through periods and sexual maturity and all that stuff while I was already pretty screwed up about sex, I'd only ever experienced it with pain and found it difficult to enjoy or even just participate in without tensing up. I was living with my now-husband at the time, but prior to this I was living with my parents. I was in the grip of a pretty epic eating disorder too, and felt so uncomfortable about my body I couldn't easily discuss m pain and symptoms with my mother, and she never asked. I'm actually pretty angry with her, tbh, because if my teenage daughter was going through towels and experiencing pAin and symptoms like I was I'd've insisted she saw a gyne but maybe that's my fault for being embarrassed talking about it but I kind of think, I was the kid, shouldn't she have been more... I don't know, involved or something, anyway I digress.\n\nMy twenties, as far as endo goes, was a slow but steady stream of laparoscopies, removal, continual pill taking, return of symptoms then back for another lap. I was already depressed, I never really got treatment for my ED which didn't help, but being in pain a lot of the time, continual anxiety about sex and a feeling of not really understanding or controlling my own body contributed to that to leave me really quite bad at times. I self-harmed, I felt suicidal, I felt inadequate, I gave up working as a chef because it was too physically demanding and settled for office work. I recognise now that training as a chef had a lot to do with my ED and in retrospect maybe endo did me a favour because it kept me from being around food all the time but I still miss it. I also suffered horrendous PMT, again not helped by my depression- it's difficult to separate the endo,  ED, pmt and depression if I'm honest, it's broken mind/broken body, I'm not sure which came first. In addition, I had almost constant UTIs which frequently became kidney infections, sometimes pyelonephritis and I was hospitalised with them several times. I was referred to urologists who all drew blanks and blamed them on my endo.\n\nBy the time I was 30 I hadn't moved on with urology at all but hadn't been experiencing the same endo symptoms,aside from painful sex and IBS-type symptoms and hadn't seen a gyne in a while. My UTIs became unbearable and my urologist had done all the tests he could think of so I went back to gynaecology. An MRI revealed my endo was horrific, for brevity here essentially everything was stuck together in a mass of calcified tissue, all twisted to the left. My periods had become so light there was almost nothing there at all and the MRI showed a single huge mass of endo basically obstructing my cervix from behind, so I guess everything I should have lost had been going out the other way, through my tubes, which is a popular theory of the cause of endo known as retrograde menstruation. I also had a load of adhesions obstructing my left ureter which made me furious with my urologist because that was exactly, e x a c t l y, what I'd suggested could have been the cause of my UTIs. My gynae referred me to another urologist who immediately diagnosed kidney reflux, gave me a procedure to correct it and put me on permanent antibiotics. My left kidney is pretty fucked though, it's got less than half the function of the right, hurts a lot, a lot of the time and will probably end up coming out. I'm pretty pissed off tbh.\n\nAnyway what followed was 3 years of one surgery after another. The plan was that my gyne would remove what was there and reconstruct as best he could what was there, with the aim of avoiding hysterectomy and then assisted conception if necessary. It didn't happen, it was a mess, just ridiculously so. I had problems with scarring twisting to the left too so the surgery was repeated and to cut a long story short, although my gynae did everything he could and I had/have complete faith in him I ended up withs hysterectomy at 31, and no children. This sucks for evryone in this position- personally I find it incredibly hard to deal with because I'm adopted. It spurred me on to finding my birth mother but it turns out she's mentally ill, alcoholic, heroin dependant, estranged from her family and homeless and has no inclination, or, to be fair, means or ability to meet me so I find myself 'unjoined' genetically at both ends of my life.\n\n I feel incredibly insecure, mentally and physically, about myself now. My adoptive family are great but my mum has let me down in a big way, which I haven't gone into here, and I have never really been allowed to discuss my adoption with them because they prefer to pretend it didn't happen, which is beyond fucked up if you want my opinion and caused me to feel ashamed of myself for much of my adult life. My life has not turned out how, before all the broken stuff happened when I still had some vague idea, I envisaged- I'm married to someone I love and I had carved out some sort of furrow for myself, and have been seeing a therapist for around 3 years who has really, really helped but I have a long way to go. I retained an ovary in the end but my symptoms continue so that will most likely come out soon. I have also had other surgery to deal with some issues all this surgery has caused. I haven't really written this down before and there ar onions in here somewhere now, I feel angry with endo because it has cost me so much, I feel angry with myself because I don't think I was as proactive about it as I could have been but I know at the same time that mentally I couldn't have been, I feel with some sort of fate or something- I try to understand why this has happened to me but there's no point because I'll never know that. I'm angry at why I've felt so alone and unable to discuss so much of this with people who love me, my husband could not be more supportive but other people have left me entirely; I have also pushed people away though so maybe that's my fault. I hope things will be normal, whatever that is, at some point in the future. \n\nWAY TL;DR Having endometriosis, depression, and eating disorder and kidney reflux at the same time sucks in the biggest way possible. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340564893", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When you talk about modern chord analysis (jazz and pop) upper case letters  are used for all chords regardless of quality. I can't remember the last time I saw lower case letters used for minor chords. \n\n If the chord is a minor chord you add a lower case 'm'. Or a - symbol.  In The key of C major, for example, an E minor chord is notated as Em or E-. If its a minor 7th chord: Em7. If the chord is a major 7 (or 9 etc) you notate it as Cmaj7 or CM7, Cmaj9\nIf its just a major triad, you only use the letter of that chord (F major is simply notated as F). \nYou might also see something like CmMaj7 or C- Maj 7. This is a minor triad (C Eb G) with a major 7th (B). \n\nAugmented chords get a + or the letters aug\nD aug or D+. \n\nDiminished chords get a 'dim', a ° or -7(b5) or m7(b5) &lt;- also known as (minor seventh, flat five):  Bdim, B°, or B-7(b5). \n\nAny extensions (6,9,11,13) are added after the quality of the chord. Sometimes in parenthesis or in smaller writing just above the chord symbol.  Cmaj13. Or Bbm9. \n\nThe classical way of notation does the upper and lower case to signify chord quality like you mentioned. C d e F G a b°  for example in the key of C maj. \n\nIn classical, however, the numbers after the chord symbol signify the inversion of the chord (unless it's a 7 then just add the 7 of the chord). So a chord listed as vi6  means its a minor 6th chord in 1st inversion (i.e. the 3rd of the chord is in the bass rather than the root). \n\nAnyway, I hope this helps. I know it's long. \n\nTL;DR. Contemporary chord analysis uses all upper case letters. If chords are minor, add a lower case m or a -.

So, consider a list (parentheses are only there for grouping):\n\n(s ....) t ....\n\nyou swap everything in the first sub-list, to move s into the 'correct' position; the advantage is this only takes on operation.\n \n(.... s) t ....\n\nso then you have to consider edge cases: \n\nCase 1) the elements at the start are already in forward order, such as:\n\n((r s t) .... )u ....\n\nfor this, r is already in the correct location relative to the next element 's'. So we have to do something, our algorithm relies on having a new element in position 1 every time.  So we'd like to preserve the order of this sub-list (which may be 1000+ elements long), so instead of putting the FIRST element in the correct location, we put the last element in the list at the correct location.  In the example, that is element 'u'.  To do that, first we reverse the inner sub-list to get:\n\n(t s r .... ) u ....\n\nand then reverse the remaining sub-list to get:\n\n.... r s t u ....\n\nCase 2) If the elements in the beginning are in reverse order, than it's just like the 2nd step of case 1.  One reverse is required to put the entire sub-list into the right place (you don't even need to know how big the sub-list is)\n\nCase 3) The elements at the destination are in forward order:\n\n(r .... ) s t u\n\nfor this, the ordering after the 's' doesn't hurt our algorithm, and we can put 'r' into the right place with a single reverse of sub-list 1.\n\nCase 4) The elements at the destination are in reverse order:\n\nr .... u t s\n\nThis one threw me off for a bit, and is a pain to fix.  My original solution was to fix [u t s] with 3 reverse operations, then place r as in Case 3:\n\ns t u .... r\n\nu t s .... r\n\nr .... s t u\n\n.... r s t u\n\n\nbut I realized there was a better algorithm using 3 operations:\n\n.... r u t s\n\ns t u r ....\n\nu t s r ....\n\nnow they are in reverse order order at the beginning, which is case 2 above, and only requires a single operation to put the entire list into the correct location relative to the next character, 'v':\n\nu t s r .... v ....\n\n.... r s t u v ....\n\n\nNote that it's possible to have both case 1 and 4 at the same time, which is something of a worst case scenario, and requires 4 operations to put the sub-list at the beginning into the correct location.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340648437", "subreddit": "dailyprogrammer", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As someone else said, it's all in the voice leading.  And then that person was downvoted, so let me explain.\n\nChords have direction within a key, and so do individual notes.  Those are usually related -- for example, the leading tone generally likes to resolve up to the tonic, so the V chord, which contains the leading tone, generally likes to resolve to the I chord.  This is a rough idea of what is meant by \"chord function\".  When you stick other notes on a chord -- for example, when you stick a 7 and a 9 on a C major chord, calling it a Cmaj9 -- the chord's function doesn't change, since it's mostly implied by the root, if you can hear it well enough.  So does a C chord tend to Dm?  It could, in a deceptive cadence in F lydian, for example.\n\nBut the voice leading is very important.  Cmaj9 contains the notes C E G B D, and Dm6 contains D F A B.  Going from C E G B D to D F A B is actually not terrible, but it has parallel fifths and doesn't sound particularly good, either.  If you sit at the piano for a while you might be able to find a voicing that works better.  Keep in mind that context is very important as well.\n\nThe real answer to your question is that you know by trying and doing, not by a rulesheet.  You might be able to discover a few nice things, but in general, if you stick to harmonies you know and add notes to them, you'll probably be able to find things that sound good, and if you experiment around with harmonies you don't know, you might find either that there's a reason people don't use it or that there's a treasure trove of undiscovered material.

Scroll down a bit until he starts to talk about SCRAM and SAME.\n\nHonestly, I prefer the SCRAM method and would suggest for you to try using the SCRAM method. I've used it to calculate my dps and I was only off by 100 or less, most likely the decimal value of my attack per sec is off. The SCRAM method deals with this as well.\n\nIts initial method just tells you to take the APS value in the details for word but you can always calculate the APS by hand.\n\n&gt; In short though, if your weapon has a range of 10-22 and you have a 5-10 dmg ring, your calculations would end up being:\n\n&gt;A = (15+32)/2 = 23.5\n\n&gt;You then multiply all your variables S x C x R x A x M.\n\n&gt;If you're dual wielding with a 10-22 weapon and a 15-20 weapon and 5-10 ring, you apply the ring +dmg to both weapon and average it:\n\n&gt;10-22 becomes 15-32\n\n&gt;15-20 becomes 20-30\n\n&gt;A = [ [15+20] + [32+30] ] / 4\n\nHope that solves your calculation error.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340787072", "subreddit": "Diablo3Strategy", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Bb and A# are the same note.  The exact same note.  Don't let anyone fool you into thinking otherwise.  They are two names for the same note, and you play them on the same fret.  Bb and A# are two just different ways of spelling the note name, so we call them **enharmonic**.\n\nWhat you might have heard is that there are tuning differences between them.  That, however, is a gross oversimplification!  In *some* contexts, with *some* instruments, *some* musicians make a difference, and that difference isn't well-defined because it depends on context.  But why?\n\nWell, say you have a scale, like C major: C D E F G A B C.  Notice how each note has a different letter?  That makes it easy to know the *function* of each note.  The Western music system has evolved to have 12 notes but only 7 letters because scales like this one, with 7 tones, are so prevalent.  Well, what if you're in B major?  The notes are B C# D# E F# G# A# B.  That second to last note has to be A# rather than Bb because it needs to play nicely with the B.  If you wrote Ab Bb B, you'd confuse musicians who expect that a scale has different letters for each note, so you'd write either G# A# B or Ab Bb Cb.  If your music has a lot of flats, you'd probably go for the Cb because you don't want to stop everything and switch from flats to sharps (which people do sometimes when they're writing music that goes all the way around the Circle of Fifths, because at some point writing double and triple sharps becomes a huge pain).  Anyway, it's conceivable to have an A# that's the 7th in B major have to be reinterpreted as a Bb, the minor 3rd in G minor, and you're the kind of musician that varies tuning of notes, you would not want to change it when the chord changes because that would sound weird.\n\nThe 12-tone system we have can be thought of as an approximation to a different system that isn't so symmetrical.  However, the symmetry makes a lot of things possible that wouldn't be possible in that other system.  So while some musicians might try to escape the 12-tone system by varying their tunings ever so slightly on some notes depending on how they're spelled, that means they can't do the magical things 12-tone equal temperament allows you to do.  Within this 12-tone system, how you spell notes does not matter *at all* to their sound; it just matters to how easy it is to play them correctly.  An experienced musician would be seriously confused at seeing a Bb when you meant A#, just like intelligent people are confused when someone says \"your an idiot and i hate you alot\".\n\nCan you picture the sad alot? :(", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341082856", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}
