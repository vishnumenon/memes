Things that do wake a sleeping newborn: sitting down to eat dinner.\n\nThis is so incredibly true. Also, sitting down to pee. It's okay to let them cry, though. But it will probably break your heart to hear (it's kind of supposed to)\n\n&gt;You will discover that there must have been something very, very tricky about composing a melody for \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,\" The ABC's,\" and \"Baa Baa Black Sheep.\"\n\nI have taken to singing the three songs mixed up. \"A B C D E F G... How I wonder what you are...\"\n\n&gt;Make sure you learn all the noises that farm animals make. Even though most people no longer live on farms, the sounds that sheep, pigs and cows make are priority number one when teaching your little one to talk.\n\nMy 21 month old doesn't know many though we're trying so hard. However, she does know that a cat says \"MAO\" a lion says \"ROAR\" and a pirate says \"*holds one hand over eye* YARRR\" (does this surprise anyone?)\n\n&gt;If she is wearing a nice outfit, it is likely that your baby will poop. If you are wearing a nice outfit, it is likely that your baby will poop.\n\nBut not *just* poop. Explosive poop. Explosive, escaping poop. That stinks and gets everywhere. Most poops aren't like this, but when you *don't* want it to be, it *will* be.\n\n&gt;One of the surprise perks of having a baby? When you're with one, you can talk to yourself out loud and people don't look at you like you're crazy.\n\n\"We\" talk about supper, what \"we\" are buying, what \"we\" should buy special for daddy and the big kids. From the day they are born \"we\" have many conversations. This does not make you crazy... it's great for your baby to talk to them like an adult... it helps them learn!\n\n&gt;Everyone tells you to \"sleep when the baby's sleeping.\" It's good advice. But, remember, it's \"sleep when the baby's sleeping... unless the baby fell asleep in the car and you're driving.\"\n\nOMG I have never heard this but I am so using it from now on.\n\n&gt;Don't beat yourself up over every little thing. Babies have really low expectations.\n\nAs long as they are fed and comfortable, they really don't care for the first few months. After that, it's fed, comfortable and entertained.\n\n&gt;No matter how much you love your child, naptime is never long enough.\n\nWhen you feel it's too long and you're freaking out about why baby is sleeping so long, you stupidly peek in on them. Instantly ending nap time. Then you realize it wasn't long enough.\n\n&gt;The secret to being a good parent? There isn't one. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.\n\nThere really are no secrets.

This is actually how my guitar teacher taught it to me. \n\nThe three are going to be A natural minor, A harmonic minor, and A melodic minor. \n\nThe reason I group these three together is that the descending portion of both the A harmonic minor and A melodic minor are the A natural minor. The A natural minor is the same up and down. A harmonic minor is the A natural minor but with the seventh degree moved up a half step on the way up and then an A natural minor back down. The A melodic minor has both the 6th and 7th degrees both moved up a half step each and then the A natural minor back down.\n\nThe basic layout for a natural minor scale is WHWWHWW.\n\nA natural minor is: A B C D E F G A G F E D C B A\n\nA harmonic minor is: A B C D E F G# A G F E D C B A\n\nA melodic minor is: A B C D E F# G# A G F E D C B A\n\nHope my explanations aren't too confusing.

{"body": "Hmm... I am a fairly classic gamer, in the sense that I tend to stay away from new titles to avoid the hype and get a clearer picture of what I'm playing. I like to understand historical context as well, to have a better idea of how a game impacts the industry.\n\nIn my opinion, the games are as follows:\n\n- Super Mario Brothers 1/2/3 (NES) - Side-scrolling 101\n- Any NES Megaman game - The upgrades/weapons systems made these games very enjoyable\n- Final Fantasy 1/4/5/6 (NES and SNES) - Party mechanics in RPGs (including MMOs) started here, as did many other elements.\n- Super Mario Brothers (several for the SNES) - IMO the pinnacle of side-scrolling entertainment.\n- Pathways into Darkness (Mac) - A loose prequel to the Marathon games, great early FPS.\n- Quake 1/2/3 (PC) - John Carmack has driven innovation in graphics for over a decade. IMO he is the father of realistic 3D.\n- Descent 2 (PC) - FPS with 3D movement. While the MIDI soundtrack is historically accurate, the Redbook CD audio is IMO brilliant.\n- Imperialism (PC) - The most educational experience I have ever had while calling myself entertained. A great turn-based strategy game, and easily one of my top favorites on this list. Oh, and it's abandonware and easily found on the internet.\n- Sim City 2000 (PC) - Back when computers couldn't manage to hold 25GB worth of game files, complexity was tricky to implement. This is a mind-blowing game that made macro-management a genre of its own. Abandonware but also on GoG.com.\n- Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 or 2 (PC) - One of those games that just did it right. \n- Falcon 2.0 (PC) - I'm not a big fan of flight sims, but for it's time F2 was proof that the fighter sim genre was around to stay. \n- Flight Unlimited (Mac/PC?) - Again flight sims aren't my thing, but this game ate way too much of my life to not make the list. Brilliant yet simple game.\n- Ultima Online (PC) - This game is the MMO genre. It is online multiplayer gaming. It is the father and mother of what we know and love about RPGs. There is a reason it is still paid for 16 years after launching - and that's with EA involved too.\n- Lords of the Realm II (PC/Mac) - Turn-based medieval management with RTS combat. A great gem for both RTS and fantasy management genres.\n- Zelda 1 (NES) - The game that started it all.\n- Zelda: Link to the Past (SNES) - One of the great top-down adventure games, IMO hasn't been improved upon yet.\n- Super Smash Brothers (N64) - Shouldn't surprise anyone.\n- Tekken 2 (??) - An arcade game that laid the frame for what we now understand as juggling in arcade fighters. \n- Marathon series (Mac) - After Pathways into Darkness, the company called Bungie created one of the most enjoyable and unforgettable FPS franchises ever.... And that was before Halo.\n- Halo series (Xbox/PC) - If Michael Bay made video games, he would wish they were this good.\n- Elder Scrolls 3/4 (PC/consoles) - Morrowind and Oblivion are two great achievements in the land of RPGs, because they are worlds created so beautifully on so many levels that you don't need to spend 90% of your time killing shit to enjoy yourself.\n- Half Life series (PC) - I am not smart enough to understand how and why these games are so influential. I just know they are. Seriously, entirely worth reading up on if you like that kind of thing. \n- Starcraft (PC/Mac/Most-definitely-NOT-N64) - I don't think there is a game that has aged better. Except perhaps...\n- D I A B L O  2 (PC/Mac) - I've lost jobs, grades, girlfriends, and almost ten-thousand hours to this game (unfortunately I'm not kidding). I could write pages on how awesome and addictive it is. Looks, sounds, and plays beautiful. \n- Warcraft series (PC/Mac) - The first two games are fantastic, and the reason we have Starcraft. Warcraft 3 is IMO still the best RTS to make the jump to 3D. Not to mention WC3 gives you the ability to play....\n- Defense of the Ancients (WC3) - Iconic in video game history, it delicately balances gameplay in a way we have only really seen in the original Starcraft. The second-best community mod ever, behind...\n- Counter-Strike (PC) - Used to play it competitively. Love this game, what it did for an FPS world that was stuck in deathmatch mode.\n- Unreal (PC) - Groundbreaking at the time.\n- Unreal Tournament (PC) - This game did weapons right. Unbelievably entertaining for a FPS shooter.\n- UT2k4 (PC) - Excellent design and engines, this is one of the most modded games in history.\n- Baldur's Gate/NWN/Icewind Dale/Planescape Torment series (PC) - D&amp;D has been in a league of it's own for decades; these games are no exception.\n- Fallout 1/2 (PC) - These games took post-apoc from campy arcade game to fully-capable setting.\n- Master of Orion 2 (PC/Mac) - This game is to me proof that we should all mourn the loss of the 4x genre. So brilliant on so many levels.\n- Caveman Games (NES) - Because games are supposed to be about having fun.\n- Lucasarts Games made before 1998 - Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, the Monkey Island series, Grim Fandango, Full Throttle, the Sam &amp; Max series, Loom, The Dig, and all of the Starwars games up to Jedi Knight. Lucasarts used to be a fantastic development house, and these games all show it.\n- MDK (Everything) - Inexplicably one of the best games on this list. Find it, play it, and be thoroughly entertained. \n\nAlright I'm done for now.

{"body": "Let's look really quick at what a file consists of.  In the end, it comes down to a bunch of 0s and 1s arranged in a specific pattern, right?  A zip file is a form of lossless compression so that you can package data up tight, send it somewhere, and then unpack it so that it will be the exact same as the original.  Lossless means that you can take data, compress it, then uncompress it, and get the orignal data back.  There are things called lossy compression (MP3 files specifically) that compress by averaging out sections of numbers.  I can go into this more if you'd like\n\nSo, let's say that you have a bunch of M&amp;Ms all in a line.  They're either Red or Blue, and you have millions all going along.  You want to send this pattern to a friend so he can make the same sequence and you guys can talk and stuff while you look at your M&amp;M sequences (just roll with me here).\n\nLet's start by looking for patterns.  For the sake of simplicity of the scenario, you find 100 different patterns that repeat.  Sometimes your patterns overlap, and it's up to you to decide if the pattern [ R B B B R R B ] is really just one pattern or if it's a mixup of the [ R B B B ] and [ R R B ] patterns*****.  Either way, you have a bunch of patterns all numbered 1 - 100.\n\nSo, now you tell him all of the patterns (you have to say each candy in the pattern so, 100 patterns and we'll say each pattern on average has 20 candies and the number of the pattern so that's about 2100 things) then you tell him the order of the patterns in your sequence (maybe 10,000 things, which would make 12,100 things to tell him total).  You were able to tell your friend how to set up your million long pattern by just using 12,100 things!  That's awesome and saves a ton of time.  You can also write down the patterns, and the order and save a lot of paper because you're not writing a list of millions of things.\n\n***** Just to elaborate on this real quick.  There are different algorithms to define what a pattern is.  Basically, you want each pattern to be as long as possible while still not being too unique (so that it repeats somewhere else).  You can't just say look for the smallest patterns because it would boil down to saying pattern 1 is [ R ] and pattern 2 is [ B ] and here's the million long list of the order.  You also can't just say look for the largest because you could say pattern 1 is [ The first half of the sequence ] and pattern 2 is [ The second half of the sequence ] and then the list is just {1, 2}.  But both of these would actually make things take longer because you end up telling all of the specifics of the entire sequence (millions long) *and* you're telling them how you broke it into patterns (more stuff to say).\n\nAnyway, I can elaborate on any of this further if you'd like.

The value `empty0` has type `List 0 Bool`, but is silently coerced into `List 1 Bool` in `bla`: this is correct because `List` is covariant in the universe level, and `Bool : Set 0` is also in `Set 1` by cumulativity.\n\nNote that the formal metatheory of the paper linked above is in the context of higher-order but non-dependent types, à la Fω. There are formal soundness proofs of various variants of Fω with polarization, or dependent systems with subtyping without polarizations (only variance on built-in type operators such as the dependent product), but I'm not sure there are full formal developments of both at the same time: it's quite painful to do because of the inter-relation between the different judgments in a dependent setting. What we have is formal developments of dependent type systems with irrelevant arrows, which may be quite close (in some presentations, irrelevance is also the strongest variance annotation).\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341303758", "subreddit": "dependent_types", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

And that's just an easy example.\n\nI just can't see an argument for NOT learning the modes. \n\nEdit: Another way I could put this is if you know your Major scale notes for C Major (C D E F G A B C) and you want to switch to a Mixolydian sound (because the modes DO have different sounds), rather than working out what degree of what scale relates to C Mixolydian, you know that that mode has a flat 7th, and therefore only need to make one note change in your head. I personally find that a lot easier than working out that it's in fact F major and then making the change accordingly.

Read about it in my book and then continue worshiping me. kthnxbai.\"\n\nAnd then, in his majestically mysterious way, he was gone. \n\nI put the super glue, bath salts and turpentine away, and then announced this major discovery to the world (I am the lead scienceperson at CERN, so it was my job to inform the plebeians like you). \n\nOk, feel free to AMA about ***S C I E N C E***!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341410028", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 36, "controversiality": 0}

The necessity of a wriggles slows down the standard gp5 spam, and his ult is good but it's certainly not Naut/Noct/Mumu ult good.\n\nThe other problem with building him full tank is that unlike other tanky champs, he can honestly be ignored because after your initial e q r w you honestly don't do much. 8% hp doesn't really bother a squishy carry all they want and once you start playing more experienced carries, they'll just ignore you (relatively speaking of course).  Naut for example does a ton of damage with his W and his cc combo is better for initiating because it gets them closer and stalls them longer.\n\nNocturne is more similar to J4 in that he needs to build a split of damage and tank but his ult is incredible and all the free stats he gets certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nI also forgot to mention that the most played AD carries are Corki, Graves, and Urgot.

I'd hesitate to call them the same as from F major or D minor, since at least D minor tends to use C#.  It's far more convenient to think of them as their own thing.  So the I chord is C, the ii chord is Dm, the iii0 chord is Edim, the IV chord is F, the v chord is Gm, the vi chord is Am, and the bVII chord is Bb.  Mixolydian music often uses the v as a dominant, but more likely, especially in popular music, the bVII is used instead.  Otherwise, you can use the same C as the I, the F as the IV, the Am as the vi, and so on.  Not much changes.  And of course, while it breaks away from mixolydian, nobody will stop you from using a B natural in a G major chord or a G7 if you want to.

{"body": "Hail fellow Strength training enthusist! :D\nI have 99 Strength and only got it last summer after playing for 7 years as well, and I did it with only 80 attack, so you should be just fine with 81 attack.  I really didn't take strength training seriously until i hit about 90 strength, but I didn't use just one method to train it all I used several.  However, I never ever used anything but D Scim or SS because they are the best weapons to use for strength training, and getting a C Rapier would just take more time out of training to get than its worth it, and not to mention it takes cash to upkeep.  The first I did was slayer training, while this is slower than any other method its one of the most profitable sheerly because of the drops, I did this when I was getting bored of training with different methods or just felt like making money.  The second method I used was armoured zombies, which requires I think Defender of Varrock to access,  which were the best xp of any method I used, but if you use this I suggest getting full Melee Void and/or Salve Amulet (e).  The last method I used was Pest Control, Soul Wars is slightly better experience, but Pest Control games are much faster, even in the Veteran Boat which I used.  I used this method because I often will get bored training, and you cant really quit in the middle of Soul Wars because the games are so long, but during a Pest Control game you can just wait 2 minutes at the most and just log off for a while then return when you feel like it. I used this method from 94-99 and I don't regret it at all.\nOther notable methods are killing monkey guards in Ape Atoll, Monkey Madness required to access but not completion, using Dharok's, or just any melee setup.  Killing Living Rock Creatures, no quest required to access, which are useful because they have lots of hitpoints, but extremely low defense, most of their drops are noted and if you have 73 mining you can mine their bodies for living rock minerals.  I hope this was at least slightly helpful or influential.  My RS username is D E C K E R, if you wanted to make sure I actually have 99 strength.  \n\nP.S. Stats aren't everything, and just because you have a low total level for the playing time you have doesn't mean anything, stats aren't everything and lots of people just play the game for fun and thats what it should be meant to be :)\n\nEdit: For a short answer stick with D scimi, or use an SS because its stats are better.  And I realize you didn't ask for a str training guide or anything I'm just giving suggestions for getting 99 strength, but slayer is still a fun way to get 99 :P", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341561629", "subreddit": "runescape", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I M W A D I, I know this to be true.  But telling me \"Oh, he's the server owner\" as an admin doesn't strike me as particularly fair.\n\nAnd this isn't the only instance I've seen man.\n\nI was on a team who had the enemy spawn trapped in Seine Crossing, but because one guy chose to snipe from the spawn that opened the floodgates to people *crossing the spawn boundry* to kill him.  But then, it evolved (devolved) into killing *everybody* in the spawn.  Simply because *one* person had the nerve to try to kill someone from the only point they had available to them.  We had our tank pushed up to the bus behind 'C' and none of them could escape.  What were they supposed to do?  They couldn't leave the spawn!\n\nLuckily I was on the friendly team.  Even then, I knew the rules so I fell back to 'D' to guard it, lest I be kicked by an opposing admin.  But no one got kicked, and I wasted my time guarding for a nonexistent rush for 'D'. \n\nI know that no one is perfect, but there are many who parrot that server as a bastion of fairness when it isn't.  While there is a difference between \"spawn camping\" (Which I quantify as waiting for things/people to spawn) and \"spawn trapping\" (Which I quantify as holding someone to their spawn and not letting them out.)  That line is blurry and can be blurred by the direction of the admins.  In this case it was a 100 Col. admin giving the go-ahead.\n\nTo be perceived as fair, you actually need to be *fair*.  And if you're touting your record on /r/battlefield and directing people to your server then you need to keep your standards as high as possible.  We have a saying in the Army:  \"We don't lower our standards, you rise to meet ours.\" \n\nTo be fair, most of my games *have* been fair, to an extent.  But if you are to tout your server as one of the best on Xbox, which I thought you were prior to all this, then you need to evaluate how and when rules are applied and by whom.  If there is an admin breaking rules then the others should speak up at the moment it happens, not in a log or pm hours later.\n\nI appreciate the effort those of you have put into making it one of the best servers around.  Because it is.  But jesus christ, the spawn trapping.  It's just not fair.\n\n*Edit:  I'll add that I don't think spawn trapping is unfair, but it is exclusive to this server.  ONLY because of the higher caliber of players that are there.  It is routinely a rapefest and if you are striving for fair, then nobly switch teams and help a team recover.  You know you are miles above everyone else on the enemy team, so why not help them?  Switch teams and give them tips.  Make it fun.

{"body": "My knowledge is limited so you may want to wait around for more info, but I can provide you with what I know.\n\nSo let's start with the major scales.\n\nYou start on C. Why? I'm not really sure. Probably some kind of cultural thing somewhere in history. Maybe there's a theory reason. I'm unsure of it.\n\nBut start on C. C has no sharps or flats. Now we have two choices. Do you want to find scales with sharps or scales with flats? If we want sharps, we could 5 up, including C. So that would be C D E F **G**. G has one sharp. If you want to find scales with flats, count up 4 including C. So that would be C D E **F**. F has one flat. \n\nSo you keep doing this, starting at the previous scale to find scales with 2 sharps or 2 flats, etc. So G A B C **D**. D has 2 sharps. F G A **B** has 2 flats.  Etc. Etc.\n\nSo now you're probably wondering, how do we know what notes are sharp and which are flat? For this, I just memorized BEADGCF. Bead Greatest Common Factor (this is just a pneumonic I use). This is the order of flats. A scale with one flat? The flat note is Bb. Scale with two flats? Flat notes are Bb and Eb. Etc.\n\nFor sharps, just reverse the order of flats to get the order of sharps. FCGDAEB. Scale with one sharp? The sharp note is F#. Scale with two sharps? The sharp notes are F# and C#.\n\nNow, we can also use the circle of fifths/fourths to get natural minor scales.\n\nAll we do for this is change that starting point C, which has no sharps and flats, with A, which also has no sharps and flats. \n\nEverything from then on out is the same. Natural minor scale with one sharp? A B C D **E**. E natural minor has one sharp. The sharp note is still F#.\n\nNatural minor scale with one flat? A B C **D**. And the flat note is Bb.\n\nNow one last thing. Let's say you're doing a major scale with 2 flats. We start at C. C D E **F** has one flat. The flat note is Bb. Now we go again. F G A **B**. Ok, now. We landed on B. BUT, the B is flat. So the scale is NOT B C D Eb F G A B. Those Bs have to be flat. It's a Bb major scale that has 2 flats. NOT the B major scale (this scale actually has 5 sharps. You can prove this to yourself if you want).\n\nSo now you might be wondering how to count up from the Bb. It's pretty simple. Just ignore the flat sign ONLY for counting purposes. So the scale with 3 flats is just B C D **E** (again, this will end up being the Eb scale because of how the order of flats works out. But basically, when you're counting up 4/5, you ignore signs and just count letters). The order would be Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb. \n\nHopefully this helps. Feel free to ask any questions. My theory knowledge comes mostly from high school saxophone playing so I'm not the best with more guitar-y stuff like chords, but I have some theory background to go off of.

Open boots + pot + ward.\n\nIt's true that his ganks aren't the greatest by modern standards, but if you can put the enemy jungler behind with counterjungling, he won't be doing much ganking, either.

Have you tried dating online, including the speech impediment prominently in the profile? I would literally be unfazed by such a thing, knowing it in advance. Lots of dudes who don't have a stutter have *actual* flaws that *actually* suck.     \n3. I once came up with some tips for a friend with a very severe stutter that really seemed to help her. After years and years of speech therapy, she credits me (decades later) to a major life change, even though I had no training at all. Like, this was a total crap shoot random guess of mine, but I'll share it in case it works for a second person. This might get long, so feel free to stop reading at any point!: my friend had a name like \"Alicia.\" One of her strongest triggers was having to introduce herself. She would get flustered and say \"I am A A A A A...\" and it progressed from there. Once that happened, she was in a rut. But I noticed, us both being musicians professionally, that when she sang she never hesitated at all. I started observing what was working and what wasn't, and I asked her if she had ever used what was working with singing that might apply to speaking. In singing English, things are far more connected than in speaking English.

{"body": "R&amp;B and funk uses a lot of variations on 7th chords. A basic chord is made up of the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of its related scale, for example C major is made up of C, E and G. On a guitar, you'd usually play it x32010 which is x C E G C E. Throwing in the 7th note (which in this case is a B) and flattening it to a Bb, adds colour and interest to the chord. You would play it x32310. We call this a C7. If the basic chord was a minor (1 b3 5, or C Eb G), adding the b7 would give us a Cm7 (or a C minor 7th). \n\nThe minor 7th chord is used a lot in funk. Try playing the Cm7 like so: \n\n    x 3 5 3 4 3. \n\nTo change it up, try adding an additional b7 by playing it: \n\n    x 3 5 3 4 6 \n\nIt's the same chord but with a different set of notes (a different 'voicing', to give it the proper term). You can move both of these shapes up and down the fretboard to give you different chords. Funk chords tend to be played quite high up to give them that characteristically jangly sound. Move it up to to the tenth fret:\n\n    x 10 12 10 11 13\n\n... and you have a Gm7. Move it up to the twelfth and you have an Am7. And so on. \n\nYou can play the same chord so that the root note (the 1 of the 1 3 5 b7) is on the 6th string or 4th string too. Try playing the Cm7 like so: \n\n    8 10 10 8 11 8  \n\nIt's the same chord as the other Cm7 but it has a fuller sound. However, if you're playing funk, you might not actually want that fuller sound, so you might prefer to play it as:  \n\n    x x 10 8 11 8 \n\nAnd just as before, you can change things up a little by changing which notes of the chord you play where. Easy variations of this chord include:\n\n    x x 8 8 11 8 \n    x x 10 8 11 11\n    x x 10 12 11 11 \n\n... but there are lots more. This chord can be easily moved up and down the fretboard as well. Move it down to the 5th fret for an Am7 and up to the 12th for an Em7 and so on. \n\nOnce you've got these down, you can change from m7 chord to a 7 (based around the major scale rather than minor but not called a major 7th for reasons I won't go into), add notes additional to the 7th (or sometimes instead of the 7th). Here are some commonly used funk chords, which I'll give you in the key of E. You can move them up/down the fretboard to change the chord just as before. \n\n    E7: 12 14 12 13 15 12 \n    or 12 14 12 13 15 x\n    or x 7 6 7 5 x\n    or x 7 9 7 9 7\n    or x 7 9 7 9 10\n    \n    E7#9: x 7 6 7 8 x (very Jimi Hendrix-y)\n    or x x 14 13 15 15\n    or x x 2 1 3 3\n    \n    Em(add 9): x x 14 12 12 14\n    \n    Em9: x 7 5 7 7 7 \n    or x x 14 12 15 14\n    or x x 12 12 12 14\n        \n    Em13: x 7 9 7 8 9\n    or: x x 12 12 14 14\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, by any means. Experiment with the upper notes - move the notes on the 2nd or 1st string up or down a fret to change the tonality. Sometimes it'll sound good and sometimes it won't - see what you like. Something else you might like is moving the whole shape down one fret and then sliding the chord back up one fret just before the first beat of the bar. You can do this in reverse too - start from one fret higher and slide down one fret instead of up. \n\nThe next thing that you need to consider for funk is the rhythm in which you play these chords, which is typically based on a 16th-note pattern (*1-and-2-and-2-and-2-and-3-and-2-and-4-and-2-and* in the space of four beats). This might seem like a lot of times to strum, but you wouldn't usually hit every beat. You might hit 1-and-2-and-2-and-2 in a rapid strum and then catch the 3 and 4 like so: **1-and-2-and-2-and-2**-and-**3**-and-2-and-**4**-and-2-and\n\nThere are loads and loads of variations on this and it's probably best to actually listen to lots of funk guitar yourself to figure it out. What's important to remember is that funk guitar (like funk everything) typically involves playing a lot less than you'd think (leaving lots and lots of space) and playing *around* the other instruments in the band. Keep this in mind as you practice. (Also, practice playing funk in the key of Eb and keyboardists will be admire and respect you.)\n\nAnyways, I hope this helps. Have fun with it.

{"body": "Hmmm. As I say below this idea was totally new to me. I don't know what I think, but let's imagine being devil's advocate.\n\n1) I don't have time to analyse this, but suppose we do the same exercise but WITHOUT THE NAMES. Call them instead just 1,2,3 and 4 - how often is it 1 v 3 and 2 v 4 and how often is it 1 v 4 and 2 v 3? If that comes out pretty even, then arguably it's just as easily accident as fixing. When I see football hand-draws taking place, the balls have numbers (how else would you do it?); a famous person draws a ball and says the number, then they read out what team it is.\n\nI guess it is also more of an issue because the same 4 have been at the top of the rankings for ages.\n\n2) In the days when Federer and Nadal were expected to beat anyone, I guess people did not make more of these draws (it certainly never occurred to me) because they thought- doesn't matter who they play- they'll be in the final anyway....\n\nBut it seems to me the transition from Djoko always being less good than Fed and Nadal to being as good if not better came quite quickly. So in the last few tournaments, Djoko beat everyone anyway (except on clay and maybe now his winning streak has run out a bit).\n\nIn other words- the article says that the main reason for fixing is keeping Fed and Nadal apart- this is not an issue (apart from US Open 2009) until 2011, since they are ranked 1 and 2) \n\n3) If you read the article, I think it's a bit misleading to say they were keeping Fed away from Murray, since Fed's record in Grand Slams is much better, whatever the H2H overall, maybe Djoko would have ascended sooner if he had played Nadal more often than he played Federer, or Nadal would have had one or two fewer and Federer and Djoko one or two more ?? Likewise, when the article quotes the enormous disparity in facebook fan numbers, surely that's exactly because F and N had so many GS wins; presumably D has more fans than he did when the article was written....\n\nOnce Djoko became so good, would it carry on being true that people would rather see a N v D final than a D v F final? A lot of fans have surely said that the problem with a final without Fed is that similarity of the styles of N and D.....\n\nIf you win one GS tournament, it can be kind of an anomaly, as with Ivanisevic at Wimbledon, but you can't win a lot, as F N and D all have, without being the best.... in which case you are going to win no matter whether you have the 'easier' or the 'harder' draw. \n\nConspiracy theories are ALWAYS very attractive, but I do wonder whether it is not just some statistical quirk......\n\nI can certainly imagine there might be a bit of fixing going on with the US Open draws for top seeds, but again, the TV report suggested there was no essential difference in how the top seeds did as a result, compared to other GSs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341848753", "subreddit": "tennis", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

This will help you with your understanding and fast communication of blues structures.\n\nThe way to understand that is easy, you take your key (which is the scale) and you apply numbers to the notes as you ascend.\nIf you're playing with a C harmonica, you should know your C scale of: C D E F G A B C. (you can wiki and youtube to understand how scales are derived, it's quite simple after an explanation or two). For example, C is I D is II E is III etc. B is VII. repeat C is I, etc. etc.\n\nMinor chords are expressed as lower case roman numerals, like D minor in the key of C is ii, since D is the second (2 in romans= II) and D minor is minor (lower case letters= ii)\n\nUse that bit of knowledge to understand and practice with the concepts of keys and scales and chord structures. I can answer a few questions on the topic, so ask away. Generally, for people wanting to play blues, knowing roman numerals and stuff is more important than sheet music (since blues is mostly improv stuff)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341850776", "subreddit": "harmonica", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, it's not a major 7th, it's a dominant 7th, or flat 7th. Here's how you figure out what kind of 7th your chord or scale has. \n\nA major scale has the following notes: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Thus, if a chord has the notes 1 3 5 7, it's a major 7th chord. Example: Cmaj7 is C E G B.\n\nA natural minor scale (Aeolian mode, or mode 6 of the major scale) has the following notes: 1 2 3b 4 5 6b 7b. Thus, if a chord has the notes 1 3b 5 b7, it's a minor 7th chord. Example: Cmin7 is C Eb G Bb.\n\nA mixolydian scale (or mode 5 of the major scale) has the following notes: 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7. Note that is has a major 3rd, but a flat 7, making it somewhat ambiguous as to its key signature (i.e., major scales have a major 3rd, but minor scales have a flat 7). It's mostly a major scale, but many scales (the blues scale and the bebop scale) that are just iterations of Mixolydian use both the b3 and maj3 to further make the key signature ambiguous. At any rate, if a chord has a 1 3 5 b7, it's called a dominant chord.  Example: C7 (also called C dom7) is C E G Bb.\n\nAll chords have a root, and the 5th is implicit once the root is defined. Therefore, the two notes that define whether or not a chord is a maj7, min7, or dom7 is the 3rd and the 7th:\n\n3+7 = major 7th\n\nb3+b7 = min7\n\n3+b7 = dom7\n\nAll other notes in the chord are extension notes that give added color or flavor to the chord. For instance, F/G is a dominant chord because the root is G, it has the b7 (F in the key of G), it has the 9th (A in the key of G, which in this case is a color note), and it has the 4th (C in the key of G, which is also a color note). The major 3rd (in this case B) is omitted in sus4 chords because the 4th clashes with the 3rd. It is therefore called a G9sus4. The 7 in the name is omitted because with the 9, the b7 is implicit. You can also call it an 11 chord because the 4th is the same as the 11th, just one octave higher (4+7=11). You would name C E G B D as Cmaj9 (with the maj7 being implicit in the name), and you would name C E G D as Csus2 (because it's just a C major triad, C E G, with an added note. In this case, 2=7+2=9). In some notations, triads are named, for instance, C5 with the \"5\" indicating that there are no 7th degree in the voicing (this is the so-called \"power chord\"). Usually, this kind of chord also omits the 3rd, which makes the key signature ambiguous (which is why power chords work in any key). \n\nTypical dominant chords are 7b5, 7b9, 7#5 (also called augmented), and 7b5. In the key of C, the notes would be:\n\nC7b5: C E Gb Bb\n\nC7#5: C E G# Bb\n\nC7b9: C E G Bb Db\n\nC7#9: C E G Bb D#\n\nIn theory, you can use any of these chords to substitute for any dominant chord. In chord progressions that use all dominant chords (such as the blues) this is very useful because you can add a lot of flavor. In practice, some dominant chords such as a dominant sus4 chord are usually used as a substitution for a V chord, for instance in a I-VI-V progression or a II-V-I progression. Other dominant chords (such as a 7b5, which is also a raised 4th, #4=b5) are used as substitutions for IV chords in a progression.\n\n&lt;tl;dr&gt;\n\nA non-dominant example: diminished chords are closely related to a min7b5 chord. Cmin7b5 would be C Eb Gb Bb. It's a minor 7th chord because is has a b3 (Eb) and a b7 (Bb). It's related to diminished because the intervals between the first three notes are minor 3rds (i.e. a whole step and a half step). Because it's related to diminished, min7b5 cannot substitute for a regular min7 chord.  I believe a min7b5 chord can also be called a dim7 chord.\n\nAnother non-dominant example: a maj7#5 chord, despite the \"maj\" in the chord name, is actually more of a minor sounding chord. Cmaj7#5 would be C E G# B. This is because Cmaj7#5 is the upper extension of the chord Aminmaj7 (which is A C E G#). Aminmaj7 is a chord built from the melodic minor scale, and Cmaj7#5 is the III chord in the harmonized melodic minor scale. maj7#5 chords cannot substitute for a regular maj7 chord.\n\ntl;dr, generally speaking, altered dominant chords can be used as substitutes for any other dominant chord (most of the time). Altered maj7 and min7 chords cannot always act as substitutes for regular maj7 and min7 chords.\n\n&lt;/tl;dr&gt;", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341869068", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are some good answers here already. Basically, you take whatever scale you're using and build diatonic triads off of each note. That sounds more complicated than it is. Let's take your example of D minor. A D  natural minor scale (aka D Aeolian) is spelled like this:\n\nD E F G A Bb C D\n\nIf you're confused already, look up the circle of fifths. That's how I arrived here; I know the key of D minor has one flat: B flat.\n\nTo find the chords diatonic to this key (diatonic just means consisting of only the notes in this scale), for each note, you add a diatonic third, and a diatonic fifth. Together, these three notes form a triad. So it goes like this:\n\nD F A = D minor\n\nE G Bb = E diminished\n\nF A C = F major\n\nG Bb D = G minor\n\nA C E = A minor\n\nBb D F = Bb major\n\nC E G = C major\n\nThe names of these chords (major, minor, or diminished) are based on the intervals between the notes. Major chords have a major 3rd and a perfect 5th. Minor chords have a minor 3rd and a perfect 5th. Diminished chords have a minor 3rd and a diminished 5th. For more about this, I'm sure you can read about intervals... but to attempt to explain it here would be somewhat time consuming and not very concise, so I won't elaborate.\n\nThis method will work for any key or mode, major or minor; just spell the scale correctly. For major and natural minor, that's as simple as looking at the circle of fifths. Spend some time picking a key and figuring out the diatonic chords, and get comfortable with this.\n\nNow, this is enough to get you started, but here's one other thing. You will notice as you are doing this that the chord built off of the first note of a minor scale is always going to be minor, the second is always diminished, the third is always major, and so on (for all NATURAL MINOR/AEOLIAN scales). Knowing this saves you some time; let's say now you want to know the chords diatonic to E minor. From the circle of fifths, we know E minor is spelled:\n\nE F# G A B C D E\n\nInstead of spelling each chord out to figure out what type of chord it is, we can just name them: E minor, F# diminished, G major, A minor, etc. because we know that for natural minor scales, the diatonic chords will always be\"\n\ni (1 minor)\n\nii° (2 diminished)\n\nIII (3 major)\n\niv (4 minor)\n\nv (5 minor)\n\nVI (6 major)\n\nVII (7 major)\n\nAlright!

{"body": "I feel like the other answers here are a little too complicated for a beginner. Here's my shot at a simple explanation.\n\nThe \"*key* of A-minor\" really just means \"let's only use the notes from the A-minor *scale* in this song.\"\n\nTo build simple chords, you pick three notes from your scale--with the one rule that the three notes need to spaced apart by one note each.\n\nIf your scale is A-minor, these are the notes in the scale (I've repeated the scale so we have more room to work):\n\n&gt; A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A\n\nLet's say you want to make a chord that starts with D. You pick the notes as such:\n\n&gt; A B C **D** E **F** G **A** B ...\n\nThe three notes you grabbed are D, F, A -- all natural notes (white keys) because all the notes in the A-minor scale are naturals (no sharps or flats). \n\nIt just so happens that D, F, A together is a D-Minor chord. \n\nIf you do the same thing but start with C instead of D, you'll find the that the three alternating notes you have to pick to make the chord are C, E, G. That just happens to be C-Major.\n\nIf you switch the scale--let's say you're using the G-Major scale instead of the A-Minor one:\n\n&gt; G A B C D E F# G A B C D E F# G\n\nAnd you were to pick the three alternating notes starting with D, you'd get D, F#, A. Note that the F in this case is sharp, not natural! And D, F#, A just happens to be D-Major, unlike D-Minor in the last example.\n\nSo in the simplest case, the key--or *scale*--you use determines which chords will be forced to be major or minor. The D chord in the key of A-Minor turns out to be D-Major, because the notes in the scale force the D to be minor. But if you're in the key of G-Major, that D chord ends up being Major simply because the notes you have to use force the D chord to be Major.\n\nHope that helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341920499", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd like to point out that you're talking about conscious stuff, attitudes and beliefs. The guy is talking about instinctive behavior, how girls are likely to respond, not how they think they would respond or what attitudes they would show if asked about these matters. Those two aren't the same. If you actually think that it's worth pointing out that you know a lot of girls who are interested in long time relationships, you are *completely* missing the point. Seriously, COM-FUCKING-PLETELY. Girls in general are interested in serious relationships, they know that and the guy who wrote this knows that. Sex too! They think about it and want it. Just like guys do. Some people are consciously *just* looking to get laid, no doubt, but this is not about them.\n\nThe point that he's making is not that girls consciously want to cheat, but that it's really easy to make them do it anyway. So it's not like the girls who want a relationship (i.e. most girls) are excluded or irrelevant, as this is not about sluts, seduction has never been, it works with girls in general, including the married ones.\n\nWhen describing a hypothetical \"PUA situation\", *of course* they're not going to assume they'll cheat, they'll probably \"know\" that they won't. But emotions change all that. They don't understand what works for them, and being caught by surprise will change a girl's mental state like that. If the guy knows what he's doing, whether or not the girl is single is not the determining factor for if there will be sex or not. It's not irrelevant though. \n\nI'm not saying this guy's completely right about everything, but please understand that talking about the stuff you do is not really getting you anywhere, because you're still in the land of what girls consciously think they want when they're not being seduced.. in other words, you're way off. Girls don't think like they think they would think when emotionally excited, and their sexual morality tend to change, being rationalized away. \"The heat of the moment\" is an extremely strong thing when it comes to women, because they are so emotionally driven, and some guys knows how to take advantage of that. Girls will rationalize anything, they want their \"harmless fun, teehee\", they want their attention from males, self realization, feeling special, etc. Being emotionally driven means you're much more likely to act according to your feelings than your thoughts, and your thoughts will also tend to \"bend\" so they're not incompatible with your feelings.\n\nThe nutjobs he describes are not actual nutjobs, they're women. They seem like nutjobs because of a social taboo. Women generally don't understand this and think PUAs are looking for sluts and that's why we're reading about all these awful female sexual morals. But women will talk about how bad it is to cheat with the guy their cheating with, not even consciously relating to what they're doing as cheating. They'll see rubbing their asses on a erect penis as harmless non-sexual fun in the right emotional state and then never be able to look back at it as anything else. They'll cheat, and they'll lie without an emotion, they'll *feel* they had the right, it's sexual self realization or something like that.. I'm not saying girls don't feel bad about cheating, I'm saying it's easy for them to not even think of what they're doing *as* cheating. Seriously, it's *everywhere*. Which makes it so much easier to do, and to lie about. And I'm still not talking about the sluts. Being emotionally driven also means that you relate to the situations you've been through with your emotions, so that the memory of the feeling you had is the thing that actually sticks, not the memory of what you did. This is key. Women can look back at a situation where they behaved like complete sluts (and everyone around them could tell), and only relate to the feeling the guy gave them, which was the feeling that made them behave that way in the first place, i.e. a good one. So they'll probably never even feel bad about it because the actual events seem so insignificant compared to the feelings.\n\nQuite frankly, I'm tired of the bullshit. Stop fucking denying everything, girls. At this point I'm actually getting a little annoyed when girls claim they \"just want a guy that has [some typical good guy property]\", when it's clear that they do not actually *respond* to this quality the slightest bit when they're presented with it. I used to take it seriously and then \"wonder\" why the fuck I got nothing. That is, I always had the _feeling_ these things were just bullshit, because it was fucking clear since puberty what girls actually respond to. But I couldn't accept it. So I rationalized too. I didn't REALLY wonder, I felt I knew, but accepting that is really really hard for some people. Girls don't act like they think they do when it comes to these things at all.\n\nIf girls actually wanted what they said they did, nobody would every bother learning picking them up, because they would strive for the things they were told girls liked - by girls. Which is fucking clueless.. Some girls even pretend like the things that actually do work don't! Seriously, get over yourselves.\n\nBelieve me, when a guy changes from almost not being able to get to have sex with girls to being to able to have sex with hot girls almost as much as he wants, he'll * * * F U C K I N G   K N O W * * * what he used to do wrong and is doing right now, and that change is happening for MILLIONS of guys because of all this PUA shit. Fucking believe it. Not because of women's statements about what they want, but because of guys finding out what women *actually* respond to, what will *actually* make them excited and interested, what will actually make them want to have sex. And it's NOT the sweet innocent stuff girls like to think they like. Girls respond to signs of social status and will cheat like nothing if played right.

Max Q, then E, with atleast 1 point in your W by lvl 3 or 4 (depending if your jungler wants to gank). You should practice your lay waste positioning. Remember, if it only hits ONE target it does double damage. Last hitting his his auto attack is brutal but can be done. I usually auto attack more often until my lay waste is lvl 3, then I spam that shit. As long as you're last hitting, you will not run out of mana due to your Defile's passive. \n\nI stay in lane until 1325 gold to get my Catalyst. You should not be dieing before this. You should not make risky plays to get a kill. You're karthus. You will get kills/farm no matter what. You don't need to take any risks. This is one of the reason karthus is so strong. Literally your ONE weakness is you don't really have any way to escape a gank. How do you fix this? Don't put yourself in a position to get ganked. If you get pushed too hard to your tower, just throw defile on and clear every minion in 3 seconds. Karthus has amazing pushing power and farming tools. You also shouldn't need an early blue buff so your jungler will love you for that. If your running out of mana, you need to wait longer to Lay Waste. Need to be last hitting with it.\n\nWhen you're trying to kill someone, turn on Defile, throw a wall ON top of them. Immediatly start Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q them. You have to make sure the wall lands. Otherwise they can just dodge your Q. If you die, try to land 1-2 Q's then ULT.\n\nSince you are playing safe, you have time to check the mini map. If your jungler is about to gank bot, throw your ult on as he starts ganking. If everything goes well you may get a kill or even assists are worth it. Once out of the laning phase, stop wasting your ult. Karthus is a team fight machine. When you begin a 5v5 fight, flash in and defile/wall their whole team. They will disperse from your defile and your team will kill someone instantly that is out of position. They will most likely focus you down which is good! You get to keep doing damage when you die and they wasted their time focusing you and not your ADC. Hit that ult and if you win a teamfight that's at least 5 assists. So easy.

I've ridden public transportation as my main source of transportation for 9 years in 4 different cities, and I find that some people just think the bus is awful, period, no matter where you live. The bus in Pittsburgh is overpriced and most of the time, it's late. Once you can come to terms with that (I don't have a car or another option), then I think you'll find it to be like any other bus system. \n\n- However, Yellowcab is the worst I've ever encountered. Sometimes you wait 10 minutes, other times you wait 2 or 3 hours. It's incredibly frustrating to have to rely on them if you need a ride somewhere (especially after the bus stops running).\n\n- The trolley is fine, but runs in very limited areas and is mostly a way to get in and out of downtown. \n\n- The people of Pittsburgh rarely travel and typically don't even like to travel. I travel a lot and have found this baffling. \n\n- What I call an ATMs, people here call MAC  machines (it took me a while to connect the dot on that one).\n\n- Not being able to buy beer at the local convenient store or grocery store really took a long time to come to terms with. Since I don't have a car, I really have to plan and stock up when getting beer. I usually go to Sav Mor as it works for me. Some Giant Eagles sell beer (like the one at the Waterfront). \n\n- Pittsburgh is fairly s p a c e d out. I live in Squirrel Hill and feel lucky I ended up here considering I didn't know much about the city. \n\n- What I love about the city is that there seems to be a lot of things popping up, new places to check out, events to go to, etc. The people here have a lot of pride and spirit. \n\n- livingpittsburgh.com has been a great resource as a newcomer.\n\n- I also subscribe to groupon, livingsocial, burgh bargains, amazon local, etc as a way to learn about places around town. \n\nHope this helps! \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342053998", "subreddit": "pittsburgh", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "* Learning chords; start with basic grips, as high up the neck as possible. Barré chords (dunno if that's the english terms, but you use one finger to cover multiple strings) are mostly usable all over the neck, but they're harder to play because of the required strength in that one finger.\n* Making chords; learn some scales! From that scale, you then take the first, third and fifth note to make a basic chord. The C (major) scale, C D E F G A B C, gives you C E G - a basic C major chord. Further chord making is as complicated as you make it. You could, for example, use C E G B, a Cmaj7 because B is the 7th note.\nChords that go well with eachother depend on the scales as well; you can make chords within the scale to match. For C, you can use the G chord too, because the first, third and fifth notes from G are G B E - a basic G major chord. \n* Jamming with those scales isn't a bad thing. I got 'better' at that myself by listening to other guitarists, and just goofing around for hours (literally hours) and finding fun riffs while doing that\n* Song writing is something I got to when trying to combine chords, a basic song made from chords isn't complicated but can sound pretty catchy with the right strumming!\n* Yep, simply practise a lot.\n\nGood luck!

{"body": "Generally speaking, if you just write \"C\", it refers to a major triad. This means that you will play the root (in this case, C), the major 3rd above it (two whole steps above; in this case, an E), and the 5th (in this case, a G).\n\nIf you write Cmin, generally this refers to a C minor triad. This means you play the root C, the minor third above root (a whole step and a half step, in this case an Eb), and the 5th (a G).\n\nIf you write Cmaj7, this means you play the 1 3 5 7 notes of the major scale starting from the root of the chord. Since the C major scale is C D E F G A B, this means that a Cmaj7 chord is C E G B.\n\nIf you write Cmin7, this means you play the 1 b3 5 b7 notes of the major scale starting from the root. Another way to look at it is that you play the 1 3 5 7 notes of the natural minor scale (Aeolian mode) from the root. Since the formula for the natural minor scale (relative to the major scale) is 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7, thats where you get the notes from for this chord. For Cmin7, the notes are C Eb G Bb. \n\nIf you write C7, this implies a dominant chord. You play 1 3 5 b7 starting from the root. For C7 this would be C E G Bb. \n\nIf you write C6, this usually implies a C major triad with an added 6th (in the key of C, C6 would be C E G A). C6/9 is C E G A D. Cmin6 is a C minor triad with an added 6th, but because this is in the minor key, it is actually a b6 relative to C major. For Cmin6 the notes are C Eb G A6. \n\nWhen other extensions are mentioned (e.g., C9, C11) without specifically indicating a 7 in the chord, usually this is just a C7 chord with higher extensions. For instance, C9 is C E G Bb D. \n\nWhen a 7 is explicitly mentioned, you simply play that 7th together with the added notes. e.g., Cmin7b5 is C Eb Gb Bb. Another example: C7#9 would be C E G Bb D# (this is the \"Hendrix\" chord).\n\nWhen \"5\" is indicated, it generally indicates playing the 1 and 5 without the 3rd degree. For C5, this would be C and G in any combination. This is the so-called power chord. Since it lacks a 3rd degree, it can act as a major chord or minor chord.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342204286", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I run 21/0/9 with Mpen Reds, Mana regen yellows, MR blues, and probably Health Quints or AP Quints. \n\nMy build is usually Boots+3 and 2-3 Dorans for survivability and then go straight Wota. Finish shoes and then go Rylais starting with the Giants belt. After that it just depends on the team comp. If you can get away with Rabs, go for it. Abyssal is safer. \n\nAthene's is OK, but only as a 5th or 6th item or if you're playing with a jungler who refuses you blue then maybe get it earlier. \n\nNever tried Tear/AA. You usually need to get Tear/AA early enough for you to fill it's passive and that really cuts down on your survivability that the Dorans/Wota/Rylais provide. That is really Cassio's only weakness.\n\nI would start my leveling with Q E Q W Q R then Max R &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; W. \nUse your W to help with ganks or to help land your Q. You don't need W's zoning power that early so 1 point is more than enough.\n\nObviously you probably know how to play her. Spam your Q's and keep your stacks up. Most champions you can all in at lvl 2 if you're feeling aggressive enough. Just try to keep your passive stacks up all the time. You will actually save more mana than if you let the passive stacks drop after every minion wave. If you're jungler offers blue, you have to take it. Cassie with blue is way more threatening than without. Some junglers want it like Skarner/Olaf/Amumu, but you should get it. \n\nIf you get ganked, turn it around on them. Ult the tanky one and then Q and E spam the other. Cassie one of the better AP mids at fighting a 1v2 gank. \n\nOverall, just play aggressive. Land your Q's and use the movement speed to run up and hit them with an E. You have one of (If not the best) pushing power in the game. You should be able to force any AP mid to farm under tower.

Your ring finger and pointer finger always hit those, and you just get faster and faster and faster at sliding into these notes.

{"body": "5 - Other scales/modes\n\nThe reason the major scale is so important is because the commonly used modes are derived from it.  Modes are scales that are derived\nfrom starting at a different scale degree.\n\nThe modes of the major scale are formed by starting on these scale degrees, each of the modes of the major scale has a specific 'mood' that it evokes.\nPlaying the mode starting from the III note (the mode is called phrygian) evokes a somber, disjointed vibe.   The mode starting from the sixth degree (aeolian)\nis the minor scale and is also somber but a little less moody.  The mode starting on the II note (dorian) is kind of sad, but less so than the aeolian or\nphrygian modes.\n\nThe modes of the major scale are in order:\nI - Ionian (major scale)\n\nII - Dorian (a minor scale with a sharp 6th, gives it a bit of a jazzy/upbeat vibe)\n\nIII - Phrygian (very common in metal or spanish classical.  Really brooding, depressing mode)\n\nIV - Lydian (Kind of spacey and dreamy, like a major scale that is tripping)\n\nV - Mixolydian (bluesy)\n\nVI - Aeolian (minor scale, omnipresent in music)\n\nVII - Locrian (rarely used)\n\nThese all relate to the major scale because they are literally the SAME scale except starting on a different note.  It comprises all the same notes\nexcept you start at the degree of the scale of the mode you are playing (for ex if you are playing phrygian you start on the third note in the scale).\n\nSo for our D major scale:\nD E F# G A B C# \n\nIf we start on the third degree, we are playing F# phrygian: F# G A B C# D E\n\nIf we start on the sixth degree, we are playing B Aeolian (aka b-minor): B C# D E F# G A\n\nBoth of these modes are comprised of the same notes as the D major scale, they just start on a different scale degree.\n\nEach of these modes has a formula to create it as well based on half and whole steps.\nThe aeolian mode:\n\nWhole-half-Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole\n\nIf we compare this to our MAJOR scale, we see that we can turn a major scale into a minor scale with the following changes:\n\nFlat third, flat sixth, flat seventh.\n\nSo we will say the formula for a minor scale is: I II III-b IV V VI-b VII-b\n\nSo to turn our D-major scale ( D E F# G A B C# ) into a D-minor scale, we will apply this scale formula, resulting in:\n\nD E F G A Bb C\n\nNote that the F# and C# have been 'flatted' into a regular F and C, and the sixth degree B is flatted into Bb.\n\nThis is fairly standard nomenclature for defining scales, for example lydian is typically represented as:\n\nI II III IV-# V VI VII\n\nor phrygian is:\n\nI IIb IIIb IV V VIb VIIb\n\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for music theory, there are countless more chords and scales to explore and infinite ways to combine them in your music.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342273781", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 27, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some of what Syllabic has answered is a little bit wrong \n\n&gt;When it comes to the names of degrees in a scale (i.e. tonic, leading note, etc), i understand why the root note of a scale is called tonic (it's the basic tone of the scale), but why is the fifth called \"dominant\"?\n\nThe fifth is called the dominant because it is the next most important note in the scale, and the reason for this is because it is the next note in the harmonic series\n\n\n&gt;What is the purpose of inverting intervals and chords?\n\nThe purpose of inverting chords is voice leading, you can google around for some more about that because I don't know enough about it to try and explain\n\n&gt;Related to inversions: with the examples i've seen, it appears that steps in the original interval and the inverted interval add up to nine. (e.g. Inverting a perfect 5th results in a perfect 4th. 5 + 4 = 9. Or, when inverting a major third, the result is a minor 6th 3 + 6 = 9). Is this always the case (like a perfect third would make a perfect sixth)?\n\nIt's cool that you're trying to find patterns, but the number of interest is actually 12 (because there are 12 notes), so if you're playing and interval of 0 to +7 semitones (Perfect Fifth) and you drop it by 12 (invert it) you'll get -5 to 0 which is 5 semitones (Perfect Fourth).\n\nMajor Third (+4)\nMinor 6th (+8)\n\nThe Adding up to 9 only works if you're comparing certain types of intervals with one another (e.g. Perfect/Perfect, Major/Minor or Augmented/Diminished)\n\nDiminished 4th (+4)\nMinor 6th (+8)\n\n&gt;Is there an easy way to understand the circle of fifths? (even a link to a website would be fine).\n\nA really simple way to remember BEADGCF (Which is also called the order of flats) Which moves up in 4th, so the reverse FCGDAED (order of sharps) is the sequence of 5ths starting from F (I find BEADGCF easier to remember because it's BEAD G C F)\n\nIf you memorise this then you'll find lots more patterns, and you can make the whole circle with it if you double it and add a flat for the order of flats and a sharp for the order of sharps.\n\nFor example F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E# B#\n\nWe're back to the start at E# because E#=F, so you can easily draw the circle that way (you might want to convert some of those sharps to flats though to avoid unnecessary ball ache)\n\nIt's also really usefull to remember this because you'll really quickly be able to write down the notes in any major scale, for example if you wanted to know what notes are in A Major. You start at C (because it has no flats or sharps) and move left or right around the circle until you're at A.\n\nA is 3 steps to the right of C which means it has +3 sharps (going right adds sharps and going left adds a flat) and these 3 sharps are the first 3 sharps from the order of the sharps (FCG)\n\nSo you write out all the letters from A to G and then add the sharps and you'll see A major has the notes A B C# D E F# G#\n\n*edit* clarity", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342303213", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not sure if you are trolling, but to answer:\n\n1. Not exactly. There are several factors into determining what *type* of scale you are playing. Major, natural minor, harmonic minor, chromatic, whole tone... these are all different types of scales. But the root note (or tonic) is usually what names that particular scale.   \n\n2. Again, not exactly.  Yes in E major you would play an *E Major* scale... this would be E F# G# A B C# D# E.  But if you start on E and merely only play the white notes on the piano (no accidentals, meaning sharps or flats, meaning the black keys), then you are actually playing a modal scale (in this case Phrygian mode, which will sound somewhat like a natural minor scale).\n\n3. For a major scale, the steps (spaces between the notes) are as follows: whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.  Once again, referring to the piano: if you started on the note C and played only the white notes, you'd be playing the C Major scale: C D E F G A B C. You would notice that there are black keys between C and D, D and E, F and G, G and A, and A and B.  On a piano, each key is separated by a half step, which is widely considered the smallest increment in most Western music. So if you skip one of these keys, for instance, the black key between the notes C and D on the piano, you are moving two half steps, or one whole step, up the scale.\n\n4. Sort of? The key of the song usually refers to the general tonic area of the piece.  A majority of the harmonic structures (chords, melodies, etc.) will be built around the notes found in the scale of that particular key. Again, an example: To play a C Major chord, you need three notes, C E and G. All three notes are in the C major scale. If I were to make that chord c minor, i would have to lower the middle note (the E) down a half step, to an e-flat. So now we have C Eb G, a c minor chord.  And notice that Eb is NOT in our original C Major scale. We call that added tone an accidental when it's outside the particular key a piece of music is in, but these are wonderful things.  As music gets more complex, it can visit different tonal areas (different keys) while maintaining an overall structure of the original key. \n\n5. Different keys will all have the same basic structure for their scales.  See note 3.\n\n\nHope this helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342328343", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

When a piece is in lets say Am, when you're going along and everythings fine using natural minor\nA B C D E F G, but then a G# note rears it's ugly head, well then it's time for an E major chord, or chords that utilize G#, such as AmM7 or G#m7b5b9 . So when the harmony changes either by a melodic line or a chord , then you alter accordingly. There are some Key features to look for.\n 1.  minor  i with a major V is harmonic minor.( ex A minor to E maj)\n2. minor i with a major IV and major V is melodic minor ( ex A min Dmaj E maj)\n3. When something doesn't fit in major or it fits in major with a quality shift. ex G C B7 -the B7 here is V in E harmonic minor relative to G major. OR C maj D major E major -this is oftentimes found in A melodic minor where the C aug chord (C E G#) is just played as C major.\n4. The harmonic and melodic minor scales descend in NATURAL MINOR , oftentimes this fact is forgotten and there are BIG arguments over it. Ex Am E major then Am7 then 2 people argue over a G note...so both the G natural and G# are present but at different times, you can keep both of them happy with E7 #9.\n\nLook for the additional alterations as they come and remember there are LOTS and LOTS of minors, with b2's and b 6's and everytime someone blinks there's a new kind of minor, last time I checked, Harmonic, Melodic, Hungarian,Egyptian,Algerian, and probably a few more.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342375817", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok... I am not going to say I'm the best riven in the world... but I am 1400 elo and Riven is my main jungler. \nThat being said. At the start of the game you are underleveled. by the time the 2nd blue spawns you should be at least level 5. which means that you spent too much time not doing anything. There was one instance where you went bot lane to gank through the river and both of the enemies were at relatively high hps and you had only a support blitz with about half of his hp to help you with this gank. \nAlso, when you gank you should autoattack in between your broken wings to maximize DPS. \n\nPlease try to reconsider your build also. I would advise you to either take a wriggles, or 2 dorans blades not both. I used to play riven with a wriggles but have lately been building double dorans instead. The double dorans is there to give some early damage and hp and honestly wriggles is a hefty investment for what it does for your late game. \n\nI didn't actually check... but as a jungle riven you might want to consider maxing w first over q. (You might have done this) This is because as a jungler you will be using your q to close the gap between yourself and the enemy in lane and will not be getting the damage boost from the upgraded q. Personally my skill order (in most situations) is q w e q then max w.

{"body": "Look up intervals, intervals is the math of moving from note to note or how two notes interact. \n\nWhen a note is played it's a wave, each note has a different wave length and notes that sound nice together have nodes within the wave that line up at certain places, the more nodes that line up the more clear they sound (perfect 5th, +7 half-steps), or the less nodes that line up (tritone, +6 half-steps), or notes that half some nodes but not a lot (major 3rd, +4 half-steps). \n\nSo for each note there are basically 12 intervals, [technically there are infinite, but they basically repeat.] So let's start with C as the root. The root note is the lowest and most important because it's the biggest wave therefore everything goes based off of that wave.\n\nSo here are all the notes and intervals based on C. Consonance is the amount of clarity or strength in the relationship &amp; dissonance is the amount of uneasy-ness or unmatched-ness in an interval.\n\n    C  +0  - Tonic (Perfect Consonance)\n    C# +1  - Minor 2nd (Strong Dissonance)\n    D  +2  - Major 2nd (\n    D# +3  - Minor 3rd \n    E  +4  - Major 3rd\n    F  +5  - Perfect 4th\n    F# +6  - Tritone\n    G  +7  - Perfect 5th\n    G# +8  - Minor 6th\n    A  +9  - Major 6th\n    A# +10 - Minor 7th\n    B  +11 - Major 7th\n    C  +12 - Octave\n\nSo basically all the notes are broken down into only a few parts. Tonics (C), 2nds (C#/D), 3rds (D#/E), the 4th (F), the tritone (F#), the 5th (G), 6ths (G#/A), and 7ths (A#/B).\n\nYou use a certain choice of these notes to create scales, for example the Major scale (Which is also the Ionion Mode) for C would be, C D E F G A B C. \n\nSo Tonic, Major 2nd, Major 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th, Major 6th, &amp; Major 7th, Octave. \n\nThe Minor scale (Aeolian) would be: Tonic, Major 2nd, Minor 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th, Minor 6th, Minor 7th, Octave.\n\nNotice that for the minor you lowered the 3rd, 6th, 7th. You might be wondering why the 2nd, 4th, or 5th wasn't lowered. Well, although the minor scale is just slightly dissonant, the 4th and 5th appear in it because they fit with the tonic note usually always almost perfectly. This is the theory of the circle of fifths. Since the 4th &amp; 5th usually sounds so good with the root, you can actually switch to make the 4th or 5th become the new key of the song. This is called modulating.\n\nThat's all for now I'm tired of writing. \n\nRead [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/w9c9/the_science_of_rhythm_guitar/c5bh7di) for more information on three intervals at a time.

{"body": "OK.\n\nA few points: \n\nYou shouldn't have read Zarathustra; I think it's rather advanced Nietzsche. He compacts a lot into the metaphors and what not. Much better to read *The Gay Science*, say. But read it just for *style*, but think on your own. Do not \"follow\" Nietzsche. The point here is to broaden your thinking base, not get caught up in his particular battles and grandiosity, etc.\n\nI was an idiot in my attribution of the band to the revolution. I saw this association somewhere and rattled it off irresponsibly! The Velvet Revolution is still worth looking at and thinking about.\n\nDare I ask what country you are from?\n\nI would strongly recommend spending some real time with Gandhi. Real time. He's got a lot going on.\n\nYou might need a bit of a break. Yes, prioritizing is important, I would agree....but *what* to prioritize still has to be questioned. What's in the things you prioritize? Might they need some reexamination? Might you need some time to *think*?\n\nOK, now a last point. You can read a lot of Nietzsche and come away with the idea that he's broaching EVARYTHING! He's not. Don't think he is. In fact, it is an almost sure fire way to shut down a whole range of being. And that range is extremely important. So I'm going to point out this \"range\", for want of a better term. In fact, political and \"identity\" issues will also shut down this range. What is this range, you ask?\n\nI call it \"midrange psychology\". It is completely ignored by most philosophy. It can be brutalized by politics and geopolitical identity issues. It is the stuff of:\n\n* friendship\n\n* basic intimacy\n\n* closeness of the heart\n\n* feelings, like anger, worry, expressing feelings\n\n* communication, listening to another, understanding another\n\n* love, relationship issues, etc.\n\nNot cast in terms of Nietzsche, nor in terms of Havel nor Zizek nor Spivak nor Foucault nor Marx. NO NO NO NO none of those EDIT: deleted \"assholes\", let me say, \"writers, thinkers and actors\" do this stuff any good (in their major work). I am serious. No, this is to be found in a much more humble literature, books, both professional and nonprofessional, about things like intimacy, emotions, anger, feelings, relationships, family dynamics, etc. \n\nAnd not even *p s y c h o a n a l y s i s* which any fhilosophuck will reference and have done with this other kind of \"not really important\" psychology. This \"other psychology\", really, is the woman to the dominant man of so many discourses, disciplines. \n\nThis is about priority indeed. Another kind of priority. And I will bet that this humble collection of nothing less than what really is the major part of our most important things in our lives will not be on most \"priority lists\" as regards Important Doings, Plans, Actions, Politics, and Philosophy. \n\nAnd yet that fragile, humble truth, which again I will just call \"midrange psychology\" is so important it can not even be measured.\n\nThat this calls for a *philosophical* critique, and a socio-political, sociological, etc., critique of: philosophy, politics, sociology, etc., may all be true and something that should be done. I am not suggesting that here. I am suggesting, however, that on your list you put this humble thing: \"midrange psychology\".\n\nWhere on the list? Do the math. *Somewhere near the top*. Do the math. What is more important than those things? And by what insanity is it that these basic things are so strangely omitted by so many thinkers, activists and what not? I don't know. I am getting very angry just thinking about it. \n\nOK, anyhow, so I have at least made this point from my end, and whether you agree with it or not, I am guessing that you see what it is I am talking about. \n\nEDIT: I've reviews this a little and am afraid you'll take my angry invectives more seriously than I mean them. The truth is, I don't mean them so seriously, as regard this strange ignoring of \"midrange psychology\", while...at the same time, I also think I might mean them more seriously than an invective or epithet can convey...But I do think this stuff, this \"other stuff\",  this most astoundingly Other to so many Major Discourses, is somehow there in the hearts of some, perhaps Gandhi at times, maybe Havel, some others. But it is, I will say, something that is trampled. It is, at the same time, your heart, I refer to.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342481400", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It seems weird to start playing in the middle of the scale and not call it the first notes of one scale or the last notes of another scale. Within a given scale such as Cmaj, there is such a variety of color to be found, but I have difficulty organizing it and understanding how all the modes and chords of a single scale relate. Then again I'm assuming there is some larger order to be understood through logic.\n\nThe logical step for me seems to assign a scale to a chord. But even on top of one chord, there are colors to be extracted against the chord. EGB is a minor triad and is contained within C major. CEG is a major triad. So not only is there 7 chords within the 7 notes, there are many different colors to be extracted ontop of each chord.

{"body": "Since everyone liked this story I will tell more.\n\nAs some background, I am a third year architecture student who started working with this guy last summer. I was referred to him by my mom who was working for him at the time as well. She was working on his website specifically. He told her he needed someone to do some basic CAD work and said I could do it. I remember though her saying how much of a pain in the ass he was but never really knew until working with him for a while. And by a while I mean 2 hours.\n\nEssentially he had some hand drafts of an idea he wanted to patent. It was a really boring esoteric mechanical engineering solution for the air force. Very simple too. Just said he wanted to transfer it to the computer to add to the professionalism. To start he bitched at me a few hours in because it was taking a long time. I thought eh whatever I'll be done today and make some easy cash who cares. How wrong I was... in both good ways and bad.\n\nThe good: he let me charge by the hour at $20. We would work together throughout the day and lose track of time. One time I worked for 10 hours straight and made a nice $200. That was the only good thing.\n\nThe bad: he was very incompetent and really had no idea about engineering. He went to school in the 50's and then went straight to the air force and so never really worked an engineering job.  He would constantly overlook restrictions/requirements/constraints and then I would have to redesign everything. I mean I made a lot of money because he extended the project inadvertently with his stupidity but man it was frustrating. \n\nHe constantly would blame me for problems he created and get so offensive. Asking if I really learned anything in school. Wtf. \n\nHe thought he owned a big business but in reality it was just a big toy to keep him entertained. He knew nothing about business. We worked at his house in his living room. On his website he listed his address with \"Suite 101\" preceding it. He would get mad if I didn't cash his check within a week. Then would claim it would \"ruin his books\" if I didn't. Then he told me to use a certain bank. WTF? I told him I would not. He was mad but he got over it. \n\nHe constantly scolded me when I wasn't 110% professional. One time I referred to a guy who was on the manufacturing company we used by his first name and the engineer said to say Mr.!!! Of course he was quite professional himself. He would seriously abbreviate/email like a 6th grader. For example \"Hello. R we going 2 work at 0900 hours still?\" Yes he used military time... He seriously would always type like that when he could. Then to top it off he would finish every email with \"Tanx!\" or \"Cheers!\" He was a 68 year old American man. Not a British guy with a lisp. Nothing against those with either of those characteristics but it really confused me. \n\nEssentially we worked in his living room. I worked at the drafting table and he would sit at his computer desk and check emails or whatever. The way were situated was that our backs were always facing each other. Well one day I turn around to ask him a question. Before I get all the way over there I see him browsing a catholic dating website... So fucking awkward. I just turned around and pretend like I never saw it.\n\nHe was also a racist, right wing tea party member. One day when we had to drive up to the local patent office together (ugh fuck everything about that day) we listened to O'Reilly and Hannity and other Fox bullshit. I remember they were joking about putting alligators in the Rio Grande (to kill illegal immigrants crossing over) and he said \"Yes! We need that. Make sure to kill them all. Right filmescapist??\" I just hesitantly pretended to agree. Wtf WTf WTFF. \n\nAlso he would tell me super tmi things. One time he apparently had a surgery. It was to remove a sebaceous cyst. He then proceeded to tell me how they grow in dark moist places. His grew near his groin. I wanted to throw up.\n\nNow finally, why I quit. The last project he had me working on was a housing shed structure for his generator for when hurricane season comes along. So I designed it and had some drawings ready. He told me to draw some elevations (basically just a flat side view of something with no perspective and limited depth) on specific sides. Well in architecture we specify an elevation based on the direction it faces. For example, a south elevation or south east elevation etc. Keep in mind it was simply a box. The project was not parallel with the cardinal directions the way it was placed. Naturally all views would be a mix of directions like south east, northeast, etc. not east or west or whatever. Well I said him the views. He gets pissed and says that's not what he wanted. Said they should only be N E S W views. A) He even agreed to it last time we met with and discussed the specific views B) That goes against basic architectural drawings.... if I drew the south elevation or whatever it would show two different sides which is useless unless you are trying to be artsy or something. I just replied to his email saying how this arrangement is over because I am tired of taking blame for his error and incorrect assumptions.\n\n**tldr: General idiocy, catholic dating, lack of common sense and typing skill of a 6th grader and groin cysts.**\n\nFuck you frank.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342582753", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Mathematician here.  The golden ratio is noting special; or at least, there is nothing \"mysterious\" about it.  It shows up\n in nature frequently because it is a particularly \"inefficient\" number.  \n\nTo clarify this a little bit, consider the example of sunflower seeds.  They grow in very in nice spiral patterns.  They do this by starting with a single seed, and then placing each new seed at a certain angle to the previous seed.  What angle should they choose to get the most compact seed structure?  If they choose, for example, 180^o (1/2 way around the circle), they \nwill have a seeds that are just in a long line like this:\n\n o o o o o o o o o o o o o  o *  o o o o o o o o o o o o o  o\n\nwhere \"\\*\" is the initial seed.  If they chose 90^o  (1/4 way around the circle), they will have seeds that line up in an arrangement that looks like a \"+\".  Neither of these is very compact.  If you choose 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, ... way around the circle, you will end up with not very compact star shapes, since if you choose, for example, an angle corresponding to 1/7 around the circle, the 8th seed will line up with the first one.  The idea is, if you want an efficient arrangement, you want an angle that will *never* line up your seeds.  That is, you want an *irrational* number.  However, not just any irrational number will do.  Suppose you choose pi =3.14159... times around the circle for the position of your next seed.  It turns out that pi &amp;cong; 22/7.  That is, pi is \"really close\" to a fraction.  The \"next best\" approximation to pi is 333/106, which is a *very* good approximation to pi.  \n\nIf you are a sunflower and you choose pi, your seeds will like up pretty closely every 7 seeds, with more line-ups appearing every 106 seeds.  This problem is caused by pi being well-approximated by its continued fraction approximations.\n\nNow, **here is the main point**.  By the preceding discussion, we now see that sunflowers should use the \"worst\" irrational number, in the sense that they need a number who's continued fraction expansion converges the slowest.  It is not surprising that there is such a number.  Indeed, you can form it by just choosing every number in the continued fraction expansion to be 1.  The resulting number is known as \"phi\", the golden ratio.  \n\nFinally, there need be no magic invoked for sunflowers to \"choose\" phi for there angle.  A sunflower many eons ago may have started out with just a fairly random angle.  If any of its descendants had a mutation which moved the angle closer to phi, they would be able to produce more seeds than other sunflowers, and the gene would proliferate.  If a sunflower chose an angle further from phi, it would create fewer seeds, and would be less likely to pass on its genes.  Therefore, as the generations pass, sunflowers should produce seeds at angles that are very close tot he golden ratio, which is what we see in modern sunflowers.  \n\nIf you want to learn more about these beautiful non-miracles, these videos ([part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0&amp;feature=youtu.be), [part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIP_Z_-0Hs&amp;feature=youtu.be), [part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14-NdQwKz9w&amp;feature=youtu.be)) are a good, and fairly entertaining, place to start.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342642964", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok well like Justin said, scales are just notes that sound nice together. There's probably some complicated science behind this dealing with vibrations of strings per second and how melody occurs in the ear with changing vibrations. Not sure if that's necessary for this, however.\n\nSo now even though scales are notes that sound good together, certain groups of these good sounding notes, or scales, have different feels to them. It makes sense considering what sounds good differs from person to person, right? So while a major scale has been around for ages and generally people think it sounds nice, you might hate it for some reason. There's also traditionally scales that purposely sound \"consonant\" or...not sure how best to describe consonant. It kind of means something that doesn't sound good together. But sometimes you want that effect to occur, and in that way, it ends up sounding good for what you needed.\n\nSo we name these different groups. And that becomes scales.\n\nSo now look at your guitar. Pick any fret (except the highest) on any string. Now move one fret up on that same string. You've just moved what's called a \"half step\" or \"Semitone\". Both mean the same thing. If you move two frets on the same string in the same direction that's called a \"whole step\" or \"whole tone\". \n\nSo now we can build scales with combinations of half and whole steps. For now, let H=Half Step, W= Whole step, and R= Root note (which is just the note a scale starts on...it's gotta have a beginning right?)\n\nThe major scale is built this way:\n\nRWWHWWWH\n\nSo you start in a spot. Movie up a whole step. Move up another whole step. Then a half step. Then a whole step. Then a whole step. Then a whole step. Then a Half step. You've now done one octave. This just means that if you started on a C, you're back on a C, it's just higher pitched. You'll notice that the beginning and ending notes have a very similar sound... and you're right cause that's what octaves are. (Basically a note is a string vibrating at a certain frequency. This is measured in Hz, pronounced \"hurts\". This is vibrations per second. So what an octave is, is when a note vibrates at twice the Hz as another note. So if it was originally 400hz and now it's 800hz, those notes would be octaves.)\n\nSO now you've gone an octave up. You can either repeat the pattern again to go another octave up, or you can turn around and do the pattern backwards and come back down to your root note. You should notice there's a nice feeling of resolve at the end.\n\nNow remember, that pattern is just for major scales.\n\nIf you look at this [link](http://bandnotes.info/tidbits/scales/half-whl.htm) and scroll down to \"Scale formulas\" you'll see more...scale formulas!\n\nYou'll eventually want to have scales not only on one string. It makes it easier to play and you can reach more octaves. To do this, you just play notes on adifferent string. If you've ever tuned your guitar by using the 5th fret of the previous string, you'll know that plenty of notes over lap on the guitar. So just use your ear (or look up scale charts) to find out how to play across all the strings.\n\nI hope this helped. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask. I'm not the best with theory applied to guitar as most of my theory was taught to me when I played saxophone. But I know some basic stuff.\n\nBut I highly recommend justinguitar.com again. He's really got some great stuff on there.\n\nOh and as for \"1 b3 4 5 b7 1. In A, that’s A C D E G A.\". Those numbers refer to notes in a major scale. the \"b\" means flat/minor (or a half step down... same thing). So 1 would be the first note of the A major scale. So an A major scale is A B C# D E F# G# A. Those #s just mean sharp (the black keys on a piano. The white keys are called naturals which are just letters without symbols. A sharp is the black key to the right of the A white key and Ab is the black key to the left of the white A key)\n\nSo back to 1 b3 4 5 b7 1. So we have the first note of the A major scale. A. Then the minor/flat/halfstepdown 3rd note of that same scale. Originally that's a C# but we flatten it into C. Then the 4th and 5th are just D and E. 7 is G# in A major so here it becomes just G.\n\nSO you're left with A C D E G A (that last 1 is just an octave higher).\n\nAs for those boxes, those are just ways and shapes to play the same scale in different ways so you have more ways to move around the guitar. They can be confusing to read but basically you can use them as a map of all the notes you'd need in your scale. Just play them alphabetically and it should work out.\n\nOk now this is really getting lengthy. Hope I didn't lose you. Feel free to ask more stuff.

{"body": "You're right that playing a C major scale starting and ending on D would be a mode of the scale - specifically, the Dorian mode. But it might help not to think of modes as just rearrangements of major, but as different scales with a character all to themselves, which just so happen to contain the same notes as some other major scale.\n\nYou already understand modes if you understand major and minor. C major and A (natural) minor are made of the same notes, yet those same notes work differently and the scales clearly sound different. You can see this by comparing the distance between notes as you go up the scale. Writing W for a whole step and h for a half step, we have:\n\nMajor: WWhWWWh\n\nMinor: WhWWhWW\n\nOf course one of those sequences is just the other shifted a few places, but they sound totally different because of where the leading tones lead, what quality of chord acts as I, II, V, etc. Since they do share the same notes, we say that they are relative: A minor is the relative minor of C major. You could say it's \"just C major played from A to A\", but that just describes its construction - it doesn't *sound* like C major. \n\nThe other modes are the same deal. Take the sequence of WhWWWhW, for example D E F G A B C D, or C D E♭ F G A B♭ C, and you have a Dorian scale. Those two happen to have the same notes as C major and B♭ major respectively, but they definitely don't sound major. Indeed, the ♭3 makes them distinctly minor. And if you compare, say, D minor and D Dorian, you'll see that the only difference is that the 6th in D minor is a minor sixth above D, but the 6th in D Dorian is a major sixth. It's this note that gives Dorian its flavor. It's why pieces composed entirely in the Dorian mode tend to emphasize the progression i-IV, a distinctly Dorian sound. \n\nIt *can* be helpful to think of modes in terms of their relative majors. Say I'm playing a song in C major and the song comes to a Dm7 chord held for a long time. What scale should I play over this chord? You might try a D minor scale, but then you'll be playing a B♭, which is foreign to the key of C. To keep things sounding natural, the D dorian mode would fit the chord effectively. Yes, you're \"still playing C major\" in that you're using the same notes, but it comes to sound Dorian instead of major if/when the ear starts to hear D as tonic. The distinction becomes more relevant when you're playing on borrowed m7 chords - you can use Dorian so that they're heard as a ii borrowed from a major key (or as i borrowed from Dorian! Or as iv from minor! Etc, etc).\n\n...I'm not sure that actually answers your questions.

{"body": "Well this is what I've learned of modes...\n\nOkay so for the rest of this comment I will speak in the key of C just to make everything simpler.\n\nSo there are several different kinds of modes, 7 to be exact there are\n\n* **The Ionian Mode** (A.K.A Major)\n\n* **The Dorian Mode**\n\n* **The Phrygian Mode**\n\n* **The Lydian Mode**\n\n* **The Mixolydian Mode**\n\n* **The Aeolian** (A.K.A Minor)\n\n* **The Locrian Mode** \n\n\nThe 7 different modes are basically seven different scales in one key, in this case the key of C major so because we are in the key of C major we can \"label\" these scales as such:\n\n*C Ionian \n\n*D Dorian\n\n*E Phrygian\n\n*F Lydian\n\n*G Mixolydian\n\n*A Aeolian\n\n*B Locrian\n\n\n\nThe modes are basically the major scale, but with different starting notes and ending notes, if you think of the scale as a circle (C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C....) Things will make more sense. \n\nSo here is the **C Ionian Scale** this is your major scale and goes C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C in the key of C which contains no sharps or flats. The title Ionian just basically means major. If you see something written as a D Ionian, E Ionian, F# Ionian, Bb Ionian, etc. this just means said major scale (D Major, E Major, F# Major, Bb Major etc.)\n\nYou probably know this but here it is tabbed\n\nE-------------------------------------------------\n\nB-------------------------------------------------\n\nG-----------------2--4--5------------------------\n\nD--------2--3--5---------------------------------\n\nA--3--5------------------------------------------\n\nE-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHere is the **D Dorian Scale** this is just called the Dorian Mode, there are no special other names for this mode. The D Dorian Scale is in the same *key* as the C Ionian and contains the *same* notes, just in a different order. Don't worry its not confusing. \n\n\nSo if the C Ionian scale in two octaves looks like this:\n\n\nC D E F G A B C D E F G A B C\n\n\nThe D Dorian scale is already there! Just start with the 2nd degree of the C scale. (The 2nd degree is the note that comes second in the major (A.K.A) Ionian scale because we are speaking in the Key of C The second note in the C scale is D)\n\n\nC **D** **E** **F** **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** E F G A B C\n For guitarists if you don't use open notes, it goes something like this (tabbed)\n\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\nB------------------------------------------------------\n\nG--------------------5--7--------------------------------\n\nD-----------5--7--9--------------------------------------\n\nA--5--7--8-----------------------------------------------\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you don't like the stretched fingering...\n\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\nB------------------------------------------------------\n\nG-----------------4--5--7--------------------------------\n\nD-----------5--7---------------------------------------\n\nA--5--7--8-----------------------------------------------\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHere is **The Phryigian Scale**, specifically the E Phrygian. Basically the same thing as the Dorian scale but because this is Phrygian, the starting note is the 3rd scale degree, (So if you count up to the 3rd note from C you go C, D, **E**)\n\n\nAgain if we use the C major scale (A.K.A the Ionian) in two octaves, the Phrygian is already there!\n\n\nC D **E** **F** **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** F G A B C \n\n\nHere it is tabbed out for you guitarists\n\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\nB------------------------------------------------------\n\nG------------------------7--9-------------------------\n\nD-------------7--9--10--------------------------------\n\nA--7--8--10-------------------------------------------\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHere is **The Lydian Scale**, specifically the F Lydian. The F Lydian scale like all the previous modes is in the same key as C major and can be found in the C major scale but starts at the 4th scale degree (So counting up would be C, D, E, **F**) Here are the notes of this scale\n\n\nC D E **F** **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** G A B C \n\n\nHere is the tabbed version\n\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\nB------------------------------------------------------\n\nG----------------------7--9--10-----------------------\n\nD-----------7--9--10----------------------------------\n\nA---8--10---------------------------------------------\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNext comes **The Mixolydian Scale** in this case G Mixolydian. The mixolydian scale is based off of the 5th scale degree in the Ionian scale (A.K.A Major) Again we go C, D, E, F, **G** to get to the 5th scale degree. This scale as all the other modes can be found in the Ionian scale.\n\n\nC D E F **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** **G** A B C \n\n\nHere is the tabbed version\n\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\nB------------------------------------------------------\n\nG-----------------------9--10--12---------------------\n\nD-----------9--10--12---------------------------------\n\nA--10--12---------------------------------------------\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThen there is **The Aeolian Scale** which is also referred to as the natural minor scale. Because this is the key of C it is called the A Aeolian scale, also the A minor scale. This Mode is based off of the 6th scale degree (C, D, E, F, G, **A**) of the Ionian scale.\n\n\nHere are the notes within the C Ionian Scale\n\n\nC D E F G **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** **G** **A** B C \n\n\nHere it is tabbed:\n\n\nE------------------------------------------------------\n\nB------------------------------------------------------\n\nG----------------------------12--14------------------\n\nD---------------12--14--15--------------------------\n\nA--12--14--15---------------------------------------\n\nE-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnd the lower octave if its too difficult up there (For acoustic players pretty much)\n\nE-------------------------------------------\n\nB-------------------------------------------\n\nG-------------------------------------------\n\nD---------------------5--7------------------\n\nA------------5--7--8------------------------\n\nE---5--7--8---------------------------------\n\n\nFinally there is **The Locrian Scale** in the key of C, this is the B Locrian scale. The B Locrian is based off of the 7th scale degree of the  C Ionian scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, **B**) This is a very odd and \"uncomfortable\" mode to solo in for most, but some people use this mode well. This mode isn't usually used extensively in soloing because some people find it hard to create melodic lines...(Or so i hear)\n\n\nC D E F G A **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** **G** **A** **B** C \n\n\nTabbed in the upper octave:\nE-------------------------------------------------\n\nB-------------------------------------------------\n\nG----------------------------14--16-------------\n\nD---------------14--15--17----------------------\n\nA--14--15--17------------------------------------\n\nE-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnd the lower octave\n\n\nE-------------------------------------------\n\nB-------------------------------------------\n\nG-------------------------------------------\n\nD--------------------7--9-------------------\n\nA-----------7--8--10-------------------------\n\nE--7--8--10----------------------------------\n\n\nAnd thats the 7 modes! It's not difficult at all, but may seem daunting, you just have to be able to get one concept and you pretty much know them all! This is not all I know about the modes, I know some more if you would like to know more I will reply in a separate comment or message you directly. I feel like everything I know is too much for one comment. If the above explanation seems too daunting then you can view all the different modes within C Major below\n\n\n**C Ionian**\n**C** **D** **E** **F** **G** **A** **B** **C** D E F G A B C\n\n\n**D Dorian**\nC **D** **E** **F** **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** E F G A B C\n\n\n**E Phrygian**\nC D **E** **F** **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** F G A B C \n\n\n**F Lydian**\nC D E **F** **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** G A B C \n\n\n**G Mixolydian**\nC D E F **G** **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** **G** A B C \n\n\n**A Aeolian**\nC D E F G **A** **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** **G** **A** B C \n\n\n**B Locrian**\nC D E F G A **B** **C** **D** **E** **F** **G** **A** **B** C \n\nEdit: Spacing, Bold, Word Choice\n\nEdit 2: **PLEASE REEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD**\n\nAs Sedawkgrep pointed out the scales I have explained are actually just scales, and not particular modes. A Mode is basically the key of the whole song, where as I explained the positional playing. For example a mode would be an entire song written in Am or something like that not just playing the Am scale. Sorry for the confusion!

If we transpose it back to C, it's C D Eb F G A Bb C.  We call this scale the dorian scale (also known as the dorian mode).  Dorian is minor except with a raised 6th.  Similarly, the fourth mode, the lydian scale, is major except with a raised 4th.  Phrygian (the third mode) is minor with a lowered 2nd.

In this situation, Hernandez lines up close to the left tackle, while Solder and Gronk line up near the right tackle, with Gronk to the outside.\n\n                 T G C G T                X\n\n             H       Q        S G\n\n                      RB\n\nThat's sort of a crummy diagram but you get the idea. In that situation X is Welker, and the RB would have been BenJarvus.\n\nFive wide out sets are very uncommon. The reason is that your best tight end is almost certainly a better receiver than your 5th best wide receiver. The 2007 Patriots made good use of 4 wide, but you need the right personnel to do that. However, these days two of the top four targets on the Pats are tight ends, so they more likely will have two WRs, two TEs and 1 RB, with all of them split wide in a full passing situation.\n\nIn this example we have skill players Woodhead, Hernandez, Gronk, Welker and Branch.\n\n    Wo     B     H       T G C G T      G  We\n\nWoodhead is out there to draw off a linebacker and because he was probably already on the field during the hurry up offense. This is a type of set they use frequently.\n\nTeams will usually carry 5-6 wideouts and 4-5 running backs on the 53 man roster. The 5th/6th WR and 3rd-5th RB are usually responsible for special teams duties as well as their skill positions. Matthew Slater is the Patriots' 6th WR, but he's a lock to make the team because he's a special teams captain. Danny Woodhead is a good RB and also returns kicks and plays kick coverage. Edelman (probably 5th on the WR depth chart) does the same. In New England, those players far down the WR depth chart are sometimes called upon for emergency secondary duty, but that doesn't really factor into their value much because it's not supposed to happen.\n\nEdit: sorry if the diagrams are a little off.

{"body": "Throw scales out the window for a while and get chordal.  I did and it helped me really open up my fretboard vision and improvisational possibilities.  Solos don't happen in a vacuum.  They are played in the context of and need to relate to their underlying chord progression.  Interesting sounding solos don't just stay in one scale or mode the whole time.  They modulate as the chord progression progresses.  You can accomplish this in one of two ways: (1) learn dozens of different scales and modes in different fingerings all over the neck and be able to switch automatically between them (something that truly advanced players can do but that takes more rote memorization and practice than I have the time or inclination to do), or (2) learn to arpeggiate chords that you probably already know.\n\nLittle wing is a good example of a song where one scale (e minor pentatonic) is enough to get you by for soloing but starts to sound stale if that's all you do the whole time.  Sure you can add some nice flavor with modes - E Dorian would fit - but if you don't account for the modulating tonality of the chord progression it's still going to sound like you're just practicing scales over a chord progression.  Learn to do some chordal stuff during the a minor and b minor parts of the chord progression, plus G F D C part at the end of the chord progression.  Then do all of the widdly widdly pentatonic stuff you want over the e minor parts, and you'll be well on your way to building more interesting sounding solos that move beyond repetitive scalar runs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342772840", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Cross post from another thread.\n\nAs some background, I am a third year architecture student who started working with this guy last summer. I was referred to him by my mom who was working for him at the time as well. She was working on his website specifically. He told her he needed someone to do some basic CAD work and said I could do it. I remember though her saying how much of a pain in the ass he was but never really knew until working with him for a while. And by a while I mean 2 hours.\n\nEssentially he had some hand drafts of an idea he wanted to patent. It was a really boring esoteric mechanical engineering solution for the air force. Very simple too. Just said he wanted to transfer it to the computer to add to the professionalism. To start he bitched at me a few hours in because it was taking a long time. I thought eh whatever I'll be done today and make some easy cash who cares. How wrong I was... in both good ways and bad.\n\nThe good: he let me charge by the hour at $20. We would work together throughout the day and lose track of time. One time I worked for 10 hours straight and made a nice $200. That was the only good thing.\n\nThe bad: he was very incompetent and really had no idea about engineering. He went to school in the 50's and then went straight to the air force and so never really worked an engineering job.  He would constantly overlook restrictions/requirements/constraints and then I would have to redesign everything. I mean I made a lot of money because he extended the project inadvertently with his stupidity but man it was frustrating. \n\nHe constantly would blame me for problems he created and get so offensive. Asking if I really learned anything in school. Wtf. \n\nHe knew nothing about computers. One time after struggling a bit with the program he knows nothing about that I used I suggested a solution. He barked \"I don't pay you to think!! I pay you to do what I say!!\" \n\nSo the next day a similar problem arised. This time I didn't say anything for a couple of hours while we struggled. Finally I suggested a solution. He asked why I didn't say so earlier. I retorted \"oh I remember how you didn't pay me to think.\"\n\nThis made him shut up for a bit then mumble something. \n\nHe thought he owned a big business but in reality it was just a big toy to keep him entertained. He knew nothing about business. We worked at his house in his living room. On his website he listed his address with \"Suite 101\" preceding it. He would get mad if I didn't cash his check within a week. Then would claim it would \"ruin his books\" if I didn't. Then he told me to use a certain bank. WTF? I told him I would not. He was mad but he got over it. \n\nHe constantly scolded me when I wasn't 110% professional. One time I referred to a guy who was on the manufacturing company we used by his first name and the engineer said to say Mr.!!! Of course he was quite professional himself. He would seriously abbreviate/email like a 6th grader. For example \"Hello. R we going 2 work at 0900 hours still?\" Yes he used military time... He seriously would always type like that when he could. Then to top it off he would finish every email with \"Tanx!\" or \"Cheers!\" He was a 68 year old American man. Not a British guy with a lisp. Nothing against those with either of those characteristics but it really confused me. \n\nEssentially we worked in his living room. I worked at the drafting table and he would sit at his computer desk and check emails or whatever. The way were situated was that our backs were always facing each other. Well one day I turn around to ask him a question. Before I get all the way over there I see him browsing a catholic dating website... So fucking awkward. I just turned around and pretend like I never saw it.\n\nHe was also a racist, right wing tea party member. One day when we had to drive up to the local patent office together (ugh fuck everything about that day) we listened to O'Reilly and Hannity and other Fox bullshit. I remember they were joking about putting alligators in the Rio Grande (to kill illegal immigrants crossing over) and he said \"Yes! We need that. Make sure to kill them all. Right filmescapist??\" I just hesitantly pretended to agree. Wtf WTf WTFF. \n\nAlso he would tell me super tmi things. One time he apparently had a surgery. It was to remove a sebaceous cyst. He then proceeded to tell me how they grow in dark moist places. His grew near his groin. I wanted to throw up.\n\nNow finally, why I quit. The last project he had me working on was a housing shed structure for his generator for when hurricane season comes along. So I designed it and had some drawings ready. He told me to draw some elevations (basically just a flat side view of something with no perspective and limited depth) on specific sides. Well in architecture we specify an elevation based on the direction it faces. For example, a south elevation or south east elevation etc. Keep in mind it was simply a box. The project was not parallel with the cardinal directions the way it was placed. Naturally all views would be a mix of directions like south east, northeast, etc. not east or west or whatever. Well I said him the views. He gets pissed and says that's not what he wanted. Said they should only be N E S W views. A) He even agreed to it last time we met with and discussed the specific views B) That goes against basic architectural drawings.... if I drew the south elevation or whatever it would show two different sides which is useless unless you are trying to be artsy or something. I just replied to his email saying how this arrangement is over because I am tired of taking blame for his error and incorrect assumptions.\n\n**tldr: General idiocy, catholic dating, lack of common sense and typing skill of a 6th grader and groin cysts.**\n\nFuck you frank.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342790433", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What you are using there with the roman numerals is done by taking the major scale and \"harmonising\" it, i.e. making chords from the scale / chords that match the scale. \n\nSo you can make chords from scales.  You can create these chords by stacking thirds (or simpler put, just picking every other note from a major scale)\n\n(I hope this isnt going into to much detail, I'll try and keep it simple but I like this as for me it connects scales and chords in a nice way)\n\nThe third I am talking about here is an interval, and thirds are important in creating pleasant chords.  (about thirds / intervals, I've attached some extra info at the bottom but its not too relevant here)\n\n**Stacking Thirds / Harmonising the major scale**\n\nTake the C major scale with your WWHWWWH fomula you get the notes of C major:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nTo create a basic triad (i.e. a major or minor chord) we want to have 3 notes, i.e. picking a root note and stacking 2 thirds one after each other.\n\nTo stack a third, start on a note, i.e. C, skip the next note in the scale (i.e. D) and pick the next one, E.  Thats 1 third up.  So hop to the next one, i.e. the note we select is E, skipping over F and picking G -thats the second one.\n\nSo for C, I have highlighted the notes below:\n\n***C*** D ***E*** F ***G*** A B\n\nWe get *C E G* and that is **C major.**\n\nNow we can do the same thing but start on D.  I.e. this is still C major scale, we are just starting on the D note and picking the next third up and the one after that:\n\nC ***D*** E ***F*** G ***A*** B\n\nWe get *D F A* and that turns out to be **D minor**\n\nSo hopefully you can see how just picking some notes from the scale to harmonise it, we have already created the C major and D minor you have talked about.\n\nSo doing this for all of the notes from C major, you get:\n\n* C E G = C major\n* D F A = D minor\n* E G B = E minor\n* F A C = F major\n* G B D = G major\n* A C E = A minor\n* B D F = B minor b5 (we derive something that is not a straight major or minor chord... -- but its right :P)\n\n**Extending harmonisation, 7ths etc**\n\nYou can take this futher, i.e. we only took the next 2 thirds, what would happen if we add the next third / stack 3 thirds? \n\n***C*** D ***E*** F ***G*** A ***B***\n\n= C E G B = Cmaj7\n\nYou can do that with all the chords we did above, i.e. start on the D and you will discover Dmin7, start on the G and you'll find G7. I.e. stacking that extra third gives you all the 7th's.  \n\nYou can then continue stacking, and you will dicover 2nds/9ths, 4ths/11ths,  6th/13th's (2nd and 9th are the same thing, just depends what context the note is being used in to what name you use, same with 4th/11ths etc).\n\n**Summary**\n\nEssentially all we are doing is taking a scale containing a series of notes that work together and finding a simple way of harmonising them.  \n\nNotes outside of this will sound odd, but it is a cool thing to start bringing in notes outside of the major scale.  It can create odd sounds but with the right use they sound awesome.  Depending on the way you look at it, you can derive scales like Harmonic Minor etc or chords like Augmented chords.  I wouldn't worry about that for now.\n\nThen we can then use these chords in different combinations to create different sounding progressions, which is what you are doing with the roman numerals.\n\nPerspective / context is everything.  When using the scale to play over these chords you need to play to the chord at the time (i.e. if id was the D minor, focus on the D F and A in the scale more than the C E G) and you will create some great music.\n\nIt also shows how the D minor and A minor although are the same type of chord, they come from different places and consequently have a different sound / feel implied by the context of the scale.  \n\nAbout those thirds I've been using.  What I am referring to here are note intervals, i.e. take 2 notes x semitones apart and there is a name for it.\n\nThe thirds here will actually be a \"minor third\" (3 semitones) or a \"major third\" (4 semi tones), I imagine you can see how major and minor chords may get their names from this.\n\nIf you are interested, look in to chord chemistry / naming chords for more info as there are ways of naming chords, its fun stuff.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342792005", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Man, I hate teachers. Really. The teachers I like aren't considered teachers, they are Educators.\n\n\n**TL;DR I spelled gross words at the beginning of sentences in good essays among other unnamed things while getting back at a teacher that was only capable of teaching her opinion.**\n\nI had one teacher--she taught Civics, a required senior year class that was supposed to be about the way government works from local to state to federal levels. She actually did an *awesome* job teaching, but she could not teach without blatantly inserting her personal and very Liberal political opinion into every lesson. I have liberal tendencies myself, but inserting opinion as fact is one of those things that stokes the Irish fire and makes me want to write satirical essays. She could get away with it b/c the town and class was extremely liberal, and she always, *always* gave slack especially to the wealthy, left-leaning good ol' boys (only guys) on just about everything. All they had to do was regurgitate her opinion and it was an easy A+. Instead of taking the easy way, I said \"fuck this, fucking with a teacher, getting my point across, and demonstrating how smart I am while still learning will be more fun than getting As.\"\n\nSo I pulled out all the stops for this bitch, especially in essay form where I was allowed to get creative. Spelling vulgar things down the left margin while astutely making a point was one of my favorites, as I got to subliminally write: A N A L F U C K S (on one paper detailing what 6 amendments I'd change and why) and my favorite, C H E E S V A G (about which branch of the fed'ral gov't had the most power, which I argued for the judicial branch because it was the most unlikely to be chosen and argued for, just to make more work for her while grading).\n\nShe eventually changed her ways when she slipped up and gave credit to one of the Good Ol' Boys for homework that he sweetly pleaded guilty to leaving at home, while the principal was in the room. I think what *actually* changed the policy was when one of the other GOBs stood up and yelled \"What the hell?! He clearly doesn't have his homework.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342837265", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are tons my friend. I can't even think of them all. Here's as many as I can remember/think of from the entire trilogy: \n\n1. In Batman Begins, Mr. Zsasz (AKA Victor Zsasz) appears several times. Once in the courtroom with Crane and another in the climax when Rachel stuns that guy when she's protecting that kid.\n1. In TDK there's that character known as Mr. Rees. He works at Wayne Enterprise (in a scene with Fox, threatened by Joker). His name is Mr. Rees = Mister Rees = Mysteries = Riddler's alias? Or at least a reference to Riddlers methods. \n\n1. In TDKR you have the Killer Croc reference which you know.\n1. In TDKR, Selina Kyle's room mate is Holly Robinson. In some of the Catwoman comics she's Selina's 'sidekick'. She also goes on to be Catwoman for a short time while Selina has a child. \n1. In TDK Joker sends Batman and the GCPD to two different locations. At one place is Rachel Dawes, at the other Harvey Dent. Harvey Dent is at 250 52 Street. Spoken as two-hundred-and-fifty-fifty-second street. The 'fifty-fifty' part can be taken as a homage to Harvey Dent's split personality (Two-Face). \n1. The score track names (for Batman Begins) are a reference to names of bat species in Latin. Also notice the first letters of tracks 4-9 spell B A T M A N.\n1. Henry Ducard's line in Batman BEgins where he says \"But is Ra's Al Ghul immortal?\" is again a reference to the fact that his true character (Ra's) is immortal in the comics with the help of the Lazurus pit. Although his true age is 600 years or so. In the party seen he also says \"The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years. We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague rats, burned London to the ground.\" - Which again is a reference to his old age in my opinion. The last sacking of Rome was roughly 500 years ago. The fire of London was in the 1660s. \n1. Some believe (and I agree with them) that there's a reference to a 1990's Spawn film. I can't remember the exact ongoings but a clown I think, pisses off Spawn who then slams down on the table and says \"Enough! From the clown!\". We have this same line in TDK where Gambol gets pissed off at Joker for saying \"soon little, uh, Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.\". \n1. This is the first Batman film to not feature the Wayne Mansion a part from it being mentioned. In the comics from about 1970's to 1980's, Bruce Wayne does move out of his Mansion and lives in the penthouse at the top of Wayne tower. \n1. In TDK, the fingerprints that Batman lifts off of the bullet or of a man named Melvin White. This could be a reference to one of two things (or both even). Mel Blanc is some voice actor for WB I think? (correct me on that one). In the comics, Joker uses an alias named 'Mr. White' (because his face is painted mostly white). \n1. Joker, in TDK, uses an RPG/bazooka. This is a trademark weapon for his sidekick Harley Quinn.\n1. In the first ever comic which introduces the Joker (1940's - Batman #1), the Joker falls from a building and is caught by Batman from some scaffolding. This small segment of the comic is used in TDK towards the end (last few scenes of the Joker as well). Another reference to this comic is when Joker takes off his make-up and disguises himself as a police officer, uses a bomb to escape from jail and he announces his crimes before committing them.\n1. In TDKR, when Selina Kyle does the 'disappearing-bat' trick while Batman's talking to her, Batman turns around and says \"So..that's what it feels like\". This is a reference to a comic titled 'Kingdom Come' where Superman and Batman are in conversation, Batman turns away, Superman flies off, Batman turns to find Superman gone and then he says \"So that's what it feels like\". \n1. Gordon is reading from a book at the end of TDKR at Bruce Wayne's funeral. He's actually reading from a comic called 'A Tale of Two Cities'. \n1. Also the bat sign that the child draws with chalk in TDKR is a reference to the Nightwing symbol. Or at least very similar.\n\nAll the references I can think of/remember/could find. If you know of any more then let me know and I'll add them in. \n\nEDIT: Added another reference.

{"body": "Another screamscape update:  \n\n&gt;A reader visiting Cedar Point to get a last ride on Disaster Transport noticed a new farewell banner was placed on the ride the detailed part of the ride’s long history in the park. However at the end of the timeline, this interesting looking blue wing looking design was placed. The wording is interesting too… as it says, “What will live at Disaster Transport’s home in the future?”  The keyword there is LIVE… which seems to imply that the new coaster will be themed to some kind of animal, being or creature. As for the blog posting yesterday… countless e-mails have come my way from people claiming that the code translated into an announcement date or some other kind of monkey fart clue, but these are all false.

{"body": "It's interesting to look at this from a mathematical perspective.\n\nFirst, check out this [microtonal synthesizer](http://offtonic.com/synth) I made and play around with some different temperaments.  I've only coded a few in, but those include 7-tone equal temperament (7-TET) and 13-TET, and you can hear the difference.  Of course, if you play around in 12-TET, the \"normal\" system (for Western music, anyway), it probably won't sound so pretty either unless you know what you're doing, and you're much more likely to know what you're doing in the familiar 12-TET than 7-TET or 13-TET.  What is it that you're doing?  You're not actually using the 12-tone system.  You're using a 7-tone system, the 7 tones of which happen to be *in* the 12-tone system.  For example, you might be playing in C major, so you get 7 different notes, C D E F G A B.  In terms of 12ths of the octave, those notes are 0 2 4 5 7 9 11.  The major triad is 0 4 7.  You might alternatively decide to use minor instead.  You still get 7 notes, 0 2 3 5 7 8 10.\n\nSo why are there 12 notes rather than 7?  First of all, there are infinitely many notes per octave, not 12.  Say you start out with some 7-note scale that you think sounds good.  Now, you want to take any note of that scale and start its *own* scale from it.  Who says that the new notes will overlap the old ones, ever?  Maybe they'll just make some pattern; who knows?  It depends on whether the log base 2 of the frequency ratios are rational or not; in 12-TET, log base 2 of the half step is 1/12 and all intervals are composed of this half step, so they're all rational and they line up.  But the problem with infinitely many notes is that you can't really put them all on a keyboard, so you choose some number and fudge the rest.  For example, 12 is a nice, comfortable number, and when you get two notes that are very close but different, you just fudge it and make them the same note.  I'll give examples of this later.\n\nReturning to the 12-rather-than-7 question, at some point there *were* only 7 notes.  Look up musica ficta.  Music would be written in the church modes, which were similar in a way to the modes of today but also had some melodic properties -- music in this mode has to end with these two notes, etc.  Over time, some intervals, especially the tritone, became \"bad\", so they would be avoided by raising or lowering other notes.  For example, if you were approaching the tonic from below, it was important to do so with a half step rather than a whole step, so if the music was in G (modern-day mixolydian) and you saw \"E F G\" written, you would raise the F to F#.  Similarly, the whole step between the A and B in the key of D (modern-day dorian) was felt to clash with the F, so the B would be lowered to Bb.  These changes would be made by the player and not written into the music.  Today, when playing early music of this sort, publishers write the accidentals above the note rather than next to it to indicate that it's a performance practice rather than in the original notation, and some interpreters (like a choir director I had once) will opt to alter those accidentals to his own tastes.\n\nIf you could raise the F to F# in the key of G, why not just play in G major, which is just like C major but centered on G instead, rather than the church mode?  The next step was to play in different keys.  Voices can do this naturally.  So if you have a pattern for a major scale, you simply make sure that it can be played centered on any note.  At the same time, composers writing for more than one voice at a time had long realized that some notes sound good together -- the interval of the fifth -- and some don't -- the interval of the augmented fourth, the tritone.  Why?  If you take a string and divide in two, you get an octave, which is the same note but higher.  (By the way, the octave should not necessarily be assumed, but we'll do it here.)  If you divide it in three, you get an octave and a fifth, and since the vibrations line up, they sound very much in tune together.  If you divide it in four, you get two octaves; in five, an octave and a major third.  Again, that sonority sounds good because of how the waves line up.  If you reduce the octaves, you can use the frequency ratio of the fifth -- 3/2 -- and of the third -- 5/4 -- to create notes that sound good, rather than haphazardly choosing notes in the continuum of the octave (which is what the Indonesians do for their gamelan tunings, pretty much).  Start with a C and you can get a G with a fifth, a D with another, an F by going a fifth down from C.  You can go up a third from the F to get an A, a third from the C to get an E, a third from the G to get a B, a third from the D to get an F#.  You can go a third down from the F to get a Db, from the C to get Ab, from the G to get Eb, from the D to get Bb.  That's 12 different notes.  What happens when you try to extend this?\n\nGo up a fifth from the D and you get A, but we already have an A.  The problem is that this A is at a frequency of 3^3 up from C (27/16) and the other A is a fifth down and a third up from C, so 5/3.  Those are different notes!  But they're very close together; their ratio is actually 81/80, very close to 1.  This is known as a [syntonic comma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_comma).  What if we want to go up another third from E?  We get G#, 25/16, but there's already an Ab at 8/5.  That ratio is 128/125, a [diesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesis), also close to 1 (though a bit less so).  Since these notes are so close together, it makes sense to treat them as one.  In fact, if you add a third or fifth in either direction to any of the 12 notes we already have, we get something close to, but not quite the same as, a note we already have.  So, as an approximation of *this* particular system, 12 notes is a good compromise, because if you add more notes, you stay close enough to the 12 you already have.  It doesn't sound that great when you do so -- if you try to play a D major chord, you'll have issues because the D and A won't make a perfect fifth -- but it's better than having infinite keys on your keyboard!\n\nNow, who says the music system needs to be based on the third?  Why don't we get rid of that and use just the fifth?  If we do this, we get [Pythagorean tuning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning).  Starting with Eb and going up in fifths, we get Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G# D#...  We can go more in either direction, but isn't Eb the same as D#?  Well, a fifth is an interval of 3/2, so if we go up 12 fifths and return to the same octave we were in, that's an interval of 3^12 /2^19 ≈ 1.0136.  That's a [Pythagorean comma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_comma)!  D# is close to the same note as Eb but isn't exactly.  The common way of doing Pythagorean tuning is to go from Eb to G#.  This means that the perfect fifth between G# and Eb isn't so perfect -- it's called the wolf fifth, because it's out of tune, while all the other fifths are in tune (because that's how we constructed the scale).  Note that the major third we were using, 5/4, has a particularly pleasant sound because of the way the vibrations line up, but the Pythagorean major third, 81/64, is not as pretty and sounds rather sharp.\n\nWhat do we do about that comma?  Tempering!  Tempering an interval involves fudging everything in the scale so that the interval is no longer problematic.  For example, it's fairly easy to temper out that Pythagorean comma.  Instead of using a fifth of 3/2, or 1.5, use 1.498..., 2^(7/12) .  Basically, make every fifth a tiny bit narrower so that each fifth absorbs a bit of that Pythagorean comma.  The fifth is no longer perfectly in tune, but at least that wolf fifth now sounds the same as all the other fifths.  If you do that, and you make D# and Eb the same note, we get our 12-tone scale!  Since every fifth is equal, this is an equal temperament.  It also means that every half step is equal, so some call it 12-EDO, 12 equal divisions of the octave.  This is the 12-tone scale we know and love (well, some of us love it).  And it's good because everything sounds relatively consonant, and there's plenty of room for harmonic invention and for changing keys.  Since B# is the same as C, for instance, if you go up four major thirds from C, you get back to C.  If you go up five minor thirds from C, you get back to C too, and this is cool because it lets you use the symmetry of diminished chords.  You can reinterpret the interval F B, an augmented fourth, as F Cb, a diminished fifth, and resolve it to Gb Bb instead of E C.  You can do a lot of things involving enharmonic notes that you couldn't do if you used the infinite set of notes from the other system (called Just Intonation).  In fact, sometimes singers of old music try to use the old tuning system, and their pitch ends up drifting around because of all the ambiguities in it.  12-TET takes away the prettiness of the major third (and also the perfect fifth, but it's so close to the original that nobody can really tell), but it's so wonderfully versatile.\n\nEDIT: Fuck, I made this too long.

{"body": "However, is it the only solution?  If you narrowed the fifth a tiny bit more, what then?  If you made it 2^(11/19) = 1.494... instead of 1.498..., what then?  Well, that's interesting.  Starting with Fb, you get Fb Cb Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E# B#.  The E# and Fb are the same note, and the B# and Cb are the same note, but otherwise, you get 19 different notes!  They're still equally spaced, and in order, they are:\n\nC C# Db D D# Eb E E#/Fb F F# Gb G G# Ab A A# Bb B B#/Cb\n\nThis could have ended up as our system, but we were already used to 12 notes, and honestly, 19 notes in an octave is a lot harder to play!  You can hear what 19-TET sounds like on my synth.  The white and black lines going up and down the screen indicate the 12-TET position of the notes, so you can compare the 19-TET notes to the 12-TET notes.  You'll notice that the major third is a bit flatter, for instance.  This is actually nice, because it's closer to that 5/4.  19-TET is a very pretty temperament, even though the fifth is a bit flat.  The downsides are that there are more notes, yes, and you also lose the magic of shifting around enharmonics.  You can't reinterpret an Eb as a D#, because they're different notes.  Diminished seventh chords are no longer symmetric.  Augmented sixth chords are no longer the same as dominant seventh chords.\n\nIn the end, it's no historical accident that we have a 12-tone equal temperament system.  It is the system that can best support the West's harmonic complexity.  It's obviously possible to create beautiful music without it -- it's a relatively recent invention, after all -- but for our general purposes, for the way we use it, there's nothing better-suited.  However, there's a wonderful world of other temperaments out there.  Check out http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/ for more on microtonality, and obviously play around with my synth!

I recently showed a rental house to a couple.  they wanted to buy it, and contacted me based on a zilllow make me move listing.  I am the definition of an un motivated seller since this rental is cash flowing very nicely.  their real estate agent showed up first and was very put out when I told her that her commission would need to be added to the top of the sales price.\n&gt;I am curious how you saved thousands. Could be something I keep tucked away for the future. \n\n I bought my home for 150,000 dollars f s b o. That would be 9,000 dollars at 6 percent commission. had they listed that house they could have maybe sold it for 155,000 dollars.  when I sold the house I sold it for 185,000 dollars or 11,000 dollars commission.  the buyer in that case ran comp's based on other marketed houses and it could have perhaps sold for 195,000.  in both cases the buyer and seller there saved a few 1000 dollars.  6% adds up incredibly fast if you consider the hours spent.   but this post is exactly the reason why buyers and sellers should be extremely careful when working with a f s b o.

{"body": "A few weeks ago, I typed out a long explanation of how to work out songs by ear that also included information on how chords and keys work, so the first thing I'm going to do is copy and paste that here. The explanation pertains to working out the chords in an existing song, but it can easily be adapted to working out chords for a song that you're writing yourself.\n\n\"When you're trying to learn a new song, the first thing you need to do is to establish is the key. You can do this by finding the root chord (that is, the I chord of the key, to which all the other chords are related, and after which the key is named). How do you find the root chord? It will most likely be the first chord in the progression, or it will be the chord to which everything resolves. Let's say we have a progression such as:\n    \n    C - Am - Dm - G\n\nC is the root. It is the I chord. Once you have this, finding the other chords is relatively simple. The easiest way to identify the root chord is via the lowest note in the chord (the bass note). Pick up your guitar, start the song playing, and try playing different notes on the 6th and 5rh strings until you've found the note that sounds most fitting. As long as the key doesn't change midway through the progression, the chances are that this single bass note will also fit quite well under all the other chords too. When you find the note that fits both the root chord and all the other chords (but less so), the chances are you've got your key. (You can cheat a bit when starting out at this by looking up the key online, but you'll soon have it down so well that you probably won't need to.)\n\nAs I say, once you have the root chord, everything else gets easier. If it's rock / pop we're dealing with, things are unlikely to be too harmonically complex and we can pretty much trust that the whole progression will stay in the same key.\n\nA chord progression usually journeys from its root chord to its most distant chord (the dominant chord, V in roman numerals), from where it resolves back to the I chord. It will likely go there via the subdominant (the IV chord). The relative minor chords of each chord might also be involved. The relative minor is the minor chord that is three semitones down from each major chord.\n\nKnowing this gives us a range of chords that are highly likely to make an appearance in any given progression. For example, in the key of C major, the I, IV and V are C, F, and G, and their relative minors are Am, Dm and Em respectively. These six chords, in varying combinations, form the basis of countless pop and rock classics. For instance, you might have the progression that I cited above: C Am Dm G. This is I chord, the relative minor of the I chord (which is effectively the vi chord), the relative minor of the IV chord (the ii chord) and the V chord. Play it and it will sound instantly familiar.\n\nForearmed with this knowledge, learning songs by ear instantly gets a whole lot easier. In many cases, working out a new song simply involves finding the key and then figuring out which of the six related chords have been used, and where. It might just be three chords (say, C F G) and some chords might repeat in their journey back to the root (e.g. C F G F), but knowing the key makes things whatever changes occur a lot easier to find.\n\nFamiliarity with the I, ii, iii, IV, V and vi chords in every key will make things easier too. This stuff will become second nature soon enough, no matter how complex it might seem now. To help, here are the basic chords for the most common guitar keys.\n\n    I ii iii IV V vi\n    C Dm Em F G Am \n    D Em F#m G A Bm\n    E F#m G#m A B C#m\n    F Gm Am Bb C Dm\n    G Am Bm C D Em\n    A Bm C#m D E F#m\n\nIt's a slightly different story if the song is in a minor key, but I'm sure you've got plenty to work with here without adding that to the mix.\nPractice this by starting simple. Work out some simple songs, write down the chords and figure out what is going on harmonically.\"\n\nOnce you've taken that information on board, you can adapt it yourself to the practice of writing chord progressions rather than working out existing chord progressions. Use the chart above to work out what chords belong in what key and start experimenting. Try patterns like I - IV - V, I IV V IV, I - V - I - IV, I - vi - IV - V, I - ii - iii - IV - V, etc. \n\nNow, once you have a basic chord progression whose chords are all in the same key, writing a lead line is relatively simple. For a chord progression that is in the key of C major - let's say C Am Dm G - you could write a lead line using the notes from the *scale* of C major. All of the chords in the key of C major are made from the notes from the scale of C major. The notes of C major are C D E F G A B C (that is, no sharps and no flats). You can find them on a guitar by starting at the 3rd fret on the 5th string and playing like so: \n\n     (5th string) 3 - 5 (4th) 2 - 3 - 5 (3rd) 2 - 4 - 5. \n\nYou could write a lead line using these notes and it will fit over your chord progression. It might not necessarily sound cool, but it will fit. The pattern of the scale repeats itself after it gets back to C, so start out from the 5th fret on the 3rd string and play the same notes again an octave higher. And then again. And again. And so on. All of the notes will fit over a C major chord progression. \n\nThat's fine for writing a lead line (ie a melody line), but if you're soloing, you probably won't want to use all the notes in the C major scale, as certain notes (particularly the 4th and 7th notes) suggest certain tensions and resolutions that don't necessarily sound good when overused whilst soloing. Take the 4th and the 7th notes out of your scale and you have the major pentatonic scale. It's very useful for soloing over a major progression and is particularly useful in country music (if that's your thing). \n\nIf you want to write something that doesn't sound too 'major', you could use chords that don't use the notes of the scale that suggest majorness (particularly the 3rd and the 7th). The easiest way to do this is to use what are called power chords. These are chords that are made up only of the 1st and 5th notes of their related scale (and sometimes the 4th). Let's take, for example, the I, IV and V chords in C:\n\n    C: x355xx\n    F: 133xxx\n    G: 355xxx\n\nMake a progression with these three chords, let's say I - IV - V - IV (C F G F). \n\nNow you have a progression which is neither major nor minor, which gives you more freedom when choosing a scale to solo over the progression with. You could use the major pentatonic (1 2 3 5 6, or C D E G A in C), or, as countless rockers have done before you, you could use the minor pentatonic (1 b3 4 5 b7, or C Eb F G Bb). Work these notes out on your guitar fretboard. Search online for 'minor pentatonic scale'. Learn the patterns. Memorize them, for you will be using them a very great deal. The minor pentatonic is the foundation stone upon which rock guitar soloing is built. Play it - it will sound instantly familiar. Work out some simple solos and observe how rock has used this sound and scale in countless similar ways. \n\nAlright, I'll stop there as that's plenty to take on board. Hope this helps.

{"body": "Usually chords are created by stacking thirds on top of each other.  Take Dmin7.  D F A C.  We have a minor third, major third, minor third.\n\nNow, let's try to create a Dmin7 by stacking fourths instead of thirds.  D G C F.  The color of this chord has changed slightly because we are adding the 11th (G), but it still functionally remains a Dmin7.\n\nThe point is to learn how to voice chords in different ways to get a different sound out of the piano.  Most people start with block chords in root position, but there's so much more you can do.\n\nThe easiest way to think about modes is to think of a major scale.  You can start on any note of that major scale and build a new scale using only the notes from your original major scale.  For example, take C major: C D E F G A B C.  Let's start on D, but use the same notes.  So now we have D E F G A B C D.  This is called the Dorian mode.  [MusicTheory.net has an exercise that talks about building diatonic chords from each step of a scale](http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/43) but they don't necessarily go into the names and uses of the modes.  I just did a quick Google search and [this page](http://brebru.com/musicroom/theory/introduction/modes.html) provides some good information.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343311925", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I do think it's better to type on. I type much faster, and quite a bit more accurately. First, however, a bit of History for you:\n\nBack in the days of Typewriters (I'm not the only one here who remembers them, am I?), the initial, more alphabetical layout would often cause the typewriter to jam when typists started going faster than the machine could handle. The QWERTY layout was created to reduce jamming. (Read: Slow the typist down). This layout started becoming the norm for all typwriters in a very short amount of time.\n\nIn the 1930's, Dr. August Dvorak created and patented the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard in an attempt to maximize speed and efficiency when typing. The original differs slightly from the current layout in terms of a few marks of punctuation, but has otherwise been unchanged for 80-ish years.\n\nNow, to explain the Keyboard itself:\n\nLook at the \"home row\" ( A O E U I D H T N S - ), and compare it to QWERTY's ( A S D F G H J K L ; ). You see in Dvorak's there are ALL af the vowels, and then the most common consonants in the English language. You can make many more words using just the home row on Dvorak than you can on QWERTY (A Sad Lad? A Dad Salad? WTF is this bullshit? There's a reason I hated keyboarding Classes.) \n\nThe motions you use to type are probably glaringly inefficent. Many words require you to type them with one hand, which is actually a bit slower. Also, many words require the typist to skip over the home row entirely, which is really stressful on your hands. The word 'Minimum' is a good example of this. It's quite a bit easier on you fingers to reach up for a key, rather than down, so the Top row ( \" , . P Y F G C R L / ) [compare ( Q W E R T Y U I O P )] contain most of your punctuation, and the next most often used letters after home row. A great many of Dvorak's words are typed ignoring the bottom row, which consists mostly of the least commonly used letters in the alphabet ( ; Q J K X B M W V Z ) [compare ( Z X C V B N M . , / )]. \n\nTpying on a Dvorak can also reduce the errors of the typist. Most typing errors are made when typing off of home row, and when using the same finger consecutively. By keeping the common letters on the home row, and placing common two-letter pairs ( NT, TH, CR, LY, etc.) in a manner where each letter isn't typed by the same finger, your accuracy is increased.\n\nPlus, it's always funny when someone borrows your computer, and goes to type on it, only to get a bunch of gibberish in the address bar when they get on Facebook.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343508149", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let me preface this by saying I'm breaking this down to a pretty bare minimum. There is much more to what I'm about to write, but I'm going to keep it super simple since we're on the internet and you have a limited understanding.\n\nScales are collections of notes. Western music (what we play) is written with 12 different notes. C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, and B. Each of these notes is a fret on your bass, and if you go up one string fret-by-fret, you'll be playing each of these notes in this succession. Note that B-C and E-F are next to each other, while all the other notes have a sharp(#)/flat(b) between them. When you play all 12 notes, it's a \"chromatic\" scale.\n\n\nFrom this, we can begin to understand intervals. When two notes are next to each other (B to C, or F# to G), we call that a half step (it's technically called a semitone, and its interval is a minor second). When two notes are two half steps apart (Bb to C or F to G) it's called a whole step, and its interval is a major second. The other important intervals for this lesson: A minor third is three half steps apart (C to Eb), a major third is four half steps (C to E), and a perfect fifth is 7 half steps (C to G). You can figure these out just by looking at the series of notes all in order. \n\n\nA major scale is a collection of 7 pitches. I'm going to use C for this example because it requires no sharps or flats. Starting on C, a major scale consists of the following steps: Whole Whole Half Whole Whole Hole Half. If you start on C, and take a whole step, you wind up on D. You take another whole step, and you wind up on E (which is the major third, which makes the scale \"major\"). Then you take a half step, and end up on F, and so on and so forth. The sixth note of a major scale (if you follow the WWHWWWH road map in C major, you'll see that it's A) is the relative minor scale, meaning the two scales can be constructed from the same notes.\n\nA minor scale consists of 7 notes as well. There are lots of types of minor scales, but I'm going to stick with the Diatonic or Natural minor scale so that we keep it simple. Starting on A (which is the relative minor or sixth scale degree of C major), a diatonic minor scale consists of Whole Half Whole Whole Half Whole Whole. Following the road map, you'll see it's A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. You'll also see that this is just the C major scale starting on a different note.\n\n\nI hope that this kind of clarifies the simplest constructs of major and minor scales. It's hard to type this all in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. I can try to help more if you need it.\n\n\nAs far as what you can play over an A minor chord in the key of G, the best option for you would be to keep it with a fairly simple arpeggio (which is the root, third, and fifth of the chord). The key of G is G A B C D E F# G. Starting on A, which is our root, we'll find that the (minor) third is C, and our (perfect) fifth is E.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343583325", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I'm not advocating for the established socialist parties. I'm saying that over the next few decades, as the internet generation come to power, new parties will arise whose platform is direct democracy. We can see this beginning now with the German Pirate Party.\n\nThe German Pirate Party is by no means a good example as it is not only powerless but has no socialist platform to help your case. So basically you're just rejecting and refusing any and all revolutions or proletarian initiatives in favor of a meager HOPE of a legitimate socialist party in the future that MAY or may not come to power? Talk about self-destruction. Again, direct democracy is completely undesirable if you do not meet the conditions I listed above (out of many), especially if that society is dominated by reactionary and backwards elements. Go present a vote for women's' and LGBT rights in Iran or Saudi Arabia, for instance, let's see how that shit will turn out for you. Oh, but no, you're just speaking of \"Western European\" countries, eh? What about the other countries? Do we leave them to fuck themselves up and kill off any revolution that may take place there? Pathetic. Heck even in the most industrialized countries of Western Europe, you had the likes of the Nazi Party and Fascism taking place, you had racism, the holocaust, anti-Semitism, mass murders, etc. etc. Taking place WITH POPULAR CONSENT AND VOTE.\n\n&gt;Again, I'm not talking about places like Chile, I'm talking about the most advanced societies of western Europe. The conditions are completely different. Look at the situation in Greece, walling apart at the seems and yet democracy is still working and no military coup has taken place. Democracy is that ingrained on western society. The idea of a military coup in the UK is just utterly preposterous, as is the idea that they would wage war against the people on the command of some bourgeoisie.\n\nThe example of Chile works completely as in any other case. A socialist party rose to power through democracy, it got ousted by a military coup and a bourgeois dictatorship installed in its place. HOW in the holy name of fuck are you going to argue here and tell me that this cannot happen in ANY Western European country, no matter how advanced? That is a very likely scenario that has already happened in the past. Before the Fascists rose to power, the Italian Socialist Party had a very damning rise to power itself. It was then crushed by the Fascists and its supporters killed off, as in the case of the Italian Communist Party. Same applies to Germany. You can find shit loads of such examples, even in Western Europe but I can't be assed to look them up atm and one example is enough. Oh but certainly the conditions are different, but does that by ANY MEANS mean that no bourgeois coup d'etat can take place? Fuck no, if anything, there is much more of a threat that such a bourgeois counter-revolution can and will take place as bourgeois reaction is deeply ingrained in the populace. See the example of the United States which, need I not remind you, I just LOVE how you just ripped it out and replaced it with Western \"European\" countries. Is that United States not an industrialized and democratic country? Oh but it is. Why did you exclude it? Because it proves you completely wrong on every level. What about Greece? Just exactly take a look at Greece. The country has turned into a revolutionary scenario with people taking to the streets. Why has it not achieved a revolution as of yet? Because Greece alone is powerless. It is not Russia with its vast population, land, etc., but it is a minor small country that is millions if not billions in deficit and debt. Do you really think it would help the case of the Communists if they took power in such a disastrous country? Lolno, it would not by any means, in fact it would prove to be detrimental. So democracy is \"ingrained\" and that is why no revolution is taking place in Western Europe? Are you seriously fucking with me here or what? Please tell me you're just actually trolling. Bro, the only reason why no such revolution is taking place is because these countries are giving their people almost all what they need (even failing at that, but that's another subject) at the expense of the super-exploitation of cheap labor in Third World countries. The only reason why these people are not revolting in Western Europe is because they can import cheap products through the super-exploitation of that cheap labor from abroad and selling it for cheap in the European market. The increased amounts of extracted surplus value from that super-exploitation bring forth immense profits for the bourgeoisie of those countries. With those immense profits and lower cost of production, those bourgeoisie would be able to offer cheap products to their fellow countrymen. Those cheap products can increase the purchasing power of the people in those European countries, give them the illusion of a comfortable life when in reality they are raping the other countries, and even attempting to suit their needs. We'll have to thus only wait for those Third World countries to either advance or revolt in order for the First World countries to taste disaster. Heck, they're already tasting disaster without the Third World countries changing! Take a look at the Western European countries, at Spain, at Ireland, at Greece! Take a look at the United States ffs! They're already fucking themselves over. The only reason why they're lasting is because of imperialism, neo-colonialism, super-exploitation of Third World cheap labor, and the creation and profiting off of making super-profitable hellholes in countries abroad where the minimum wage is either low or non-existent, where standards of living are disastrous, where education is rare, where people move mountains for a dollar, or even where sweatshop and child labor is enforced. Case in point, it has N O T H I N G to do with democracy but actually super-exploitation, imperialism, neo-colonialism, and the like. Oh and what is so \"preposterous\" about a military coup taking place in the UK? Are you that daft? Do you honestly think that if the interests of the ruling class, i.e., the bourgeoisie are being contested with the threat of taking power, taking away their power, taking away their status, the hold on capital, their means of income through exploitation, etc. etc. That they won't simply defend their privileges and interests? If anyone resists then they'd slap the typical \"terrorist\" label, the US would jump in and Europe would as well. If it would not be reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries who would resist and be funded by the US (remember what happened during the Cold War), it would be a planned military or political coup by the bourgeois parties and their supporters. The Tories themselves would sooner die than have an actual Socialist party in power. \n\n&gt; Yes it is, we simply disagree what a proletarian state is. I say it's direct democracy and quote Marx, you say it's the Revolutionary Vanguard and quote Lenin.\n\nIf you had even bothered to read Lenin's \"The State and Revolution\", you would have seen that he quoted Marx extensively. By doing so, he quoted the passages about smashing the bourgeois state and replacing it with a proletarian state, even Marx said “... If you look at the last chapter of my Eighteenth Brumaire, you will find that I declare: the next French Revolution will no longer attempt to transfer the bureaucratic-military apparatus from one hand to another, but to smash it, and this is the precondition for every real people’s revolution on the Continent.”\nIf anything, the quote you used had nothing to do with direct democracy as self-government of a commune need not only be direct democratic, nor does Marx even refer to direct democracy anywhere in that quote. Seriously though, what part of \"smashing of the bourgeois state\" do you simply just don't understand? I mean really. Marx had also said, \"... One thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that 'the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes'....\"\nJust read this for starters: http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/\n\n&gt;The Soviet Union collapsed and is now capitalist, but you're still going to insist that Lenin's theory is the way forward for everyone, even though it ended in failure?\n\nAt least it existed and brought for jaw-dropping advancements, changes, and development. In only 30 years it stood head to head with the world's superpower, the United States and even surpassed it. That is so when even the USSR was extremely flawed and started out with unfavorable conditions with not a single Western European or industrialized country having a successful revolution or move from capitalism, be it those influenced by opportunist and reformist Kautskyist shit or otherwise. At least the Soviet Union existed, achieved wonders, and then succumbed to internal and external decomposition. Gorbachev himself worked to end the USSR and said \"my ambition was to liquidate communism\" and I will gladly give you a source: http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv6n1/gorbach.htm\n\nSo what if it ended? That was due to many issues which can be averted today thanks to technology in the economic sphere. The fall of the USSR was not due to Lenin or any of his theories failing, but due to individuals like Gorbachev here actually wanting to \"liquidate communism\" and intentionally fucking it up. If anything, Lenin's theories are much more valid than ever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343600482", "subreddit": "communism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If they step forward and cross the line it's a run, if they don't it is a pass block.\n\nOkay now we know if it is a run or a pass from the lineman's first step.   If the lineman let certain blockers go past them there is a good chance it's a screen.  Especially if the QB is rolling a particular direction.\n\nNow if it is a running play watch which direction the line blocks after that first step.   You can see which gap they are going to go by the way the lineman push to open a hole.  If a tackle goes inside he's sealing the edge for someone coming behind him.  If he pushes out he is trying to create a hole.\n\nAlso look at the Guards. If they pull than the runningback is definitely going to go behind them on the opposite side. \n\nNow on pass plays the key is the QB to watch what his steps.  \n\nIf the QB drops for 3 steps it's a quick route.  If it's 5 steps it's a longer route.\n\nNow out of the gun formation / spread stuff is all about reading the defense.\n\nOregon's offense pretty much is based off of reading the DE.  If the DE commits to stopping the outside run than the QB reads that and gives it to the running back going inside.  \n\nWhile most QBs read the Mike (Middle linebacker) Oregon pretty much reads the Defensive End on what side the play is designed to go.\n\nIf the DE goes inside to protect the gap. Bounce to the outside.  It's hard to stop because they use their speed as the advantage and put all the pressure on the DE to make a play.   They are counting on their speed and decision making to be faster and better than his athleticism. \n\nWhere they are vulnerable is on the interior if a DT can get penetration straight up the center and essentially \"break\" the offensive line it will disrupt the timing they use.  \n\nNow WRs can tell you what kind of play is going to happen by what they do as well.  If they go up to block then its either a run or a bubble screen like option.  (look for motion or trips basically three wr all together).  If they motion a player over and then you see the wr run right at the CB while the other WR goes to run a route it for sure is a bubble screen.\n\nIf the WRs all look to be blocking then it probably is a run.\n\nIf they move off the line and run back it is a reverse/decoy.\n\n\nAnyway I hope all this helps a little bit.\n\nI would recommend first trying to figure out strength.\n\nThen figure out run / pass\n\nThen figure out which side it is going to based on formations and the above.\n\nThen start studying the little nuances that give things away.  For example.  In strong right when Z wr goes in motion it is a hot route to Z or whatever.  You can do it it just requires A LOT of watching film. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343670276", "subreddit": "CFB", "score": 40, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Say you have the alphabet:\n\nA B C D E F ....\n\nand lets give each letter a number:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 .....\n\nSo now if the data you send 'DAD', it actually gets encoded as '313'.  OK, thats fine, but anyone could undo that!  Instead of that simple encoding, lets add a random number (say, 5) to each letter, that only you know:\n\n1 + 5 = 6\n\n2 + 5 = 7\n\n3 + 5 = 8\n\n4 + 5 = 9\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n6 + 5 = 11\n\nSo now when we encode the word 'DAD', it comes out at 868 (because we added that random 5 to everything).  Now anyone who doesn't know the random number you added thinks that you *meant* to write 868 (which would normally decode to HFH) and thinks 'Gee, thats some random stuff, I have no idea what that means.  I'm going to go get a soda instead'.  But because *you* know that you added 5 to everything, you can get back to 'DAD'.\n\nThat '5' is your password and thats a basic way to do scrambling.

{"body": "[Good paper here.](http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~sayan/DiscussionPapers/DP97-08/slavery.pdf)  Many others are good but behind paywalls.\n\nKey paragraph:\n\n&gt;Turning back to the static comparisons in expression (19), a good question to ask\nconcerns the reason why the slave owners did not abolish slavery, even though they had a\nchance to improve their profits in the short run by adopting a free labor market.19 The\nanswer to this question is twofold. Firstly, in the system of slavery, the surplus of slave\nowners is not made up of only the operational profits but also includes the (imputed) rental\nof the slaves already owned. Thus, the abolishment of slavery would impose a burden on\nthe slave owners amounting to r per slave per period.20 Note that for all free labor\neconomies under consideration p p f S &lt; + ρ , implying that the profits alone would not\naccount for total gains of the slave owners from the maintenance of slavery. In other words,\nthe slave owners would be made worse off by a transition to a free labor economy despite\nthe inequality pS &lt; pf\nO &lt; pf\nM . The second reason is the risk of ending up with a smaller\nlabor force and hence, lower profits21 after the abolishment of slavery, due to the migration\nof freed slaves to other parts of the country (Mandle, 1992; Graves, et.al., 1983).\n\nNote this can also be applied to labor markets in command economies like China.\n\nAlso, here is [a book chapter](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c0606.pdf) analyzing the rate of return on slave labor and concluding it represented a better rate of return than investing in the stock market.\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343759160", "subreddit": "Anarcho_Capitalism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
