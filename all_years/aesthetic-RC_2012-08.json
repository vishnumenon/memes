{"body": "ZILEAN! I love this guy even though I haven't played him in so long.\nBack in S1 I went either support bot lane or mid. As quick a guide as I can manage -    \n\nRunes: 9x Mpen reds, 9x Armor OR 9x Mana Regen OR 9x Mana Regen/lvl yellows, 9x MR/lvl glyphs, 3x AP quints are suggested, but you can usually do whatever so long as you keep 9x Mpen reds.    \n\nMasteries: 21-0-9 standard AP carry or 9-9-12 OR 9-0-12 support.    \n\nSkill order: R&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E, QWQE first four levels.    \n\nItems: Since this is most likely your first time with Zilean, you might want to grab a tear as support, but otherwise philo&gt; hog&gt; boots&gt; lucidity&gt; shurelias since you to eventually max out on CDR.    \nAs AP mid, I suggest want to starts boots+3pots&gt; catalyst&gt; roa&gt; sorc boots&gt; kages&gt; deathcap&gt; dfg.    \n\nHow to play: As support, try to harass the opposing carry with your bombs, but don't use up too much mana since you may want your slow down/speed up* for ganks. Zilean is fairly strong at getting kills in bot lane as well. Out of lane, you want to keep an eye on your mana, but try to do something similar to Q E W Q E, so as to use your W (reset) AFTER you've used your Q and E. At all times, try to ult your carry just as he dies (although you can be more cautious and ult when your carry is ~10-20% hp probably).    \nAs AP, you can harass your opponent by bombing them and stepping back (if you are vs karthus you can probably even zone him provided you last hit with just autos).    \nOnce your CDR is high enough, you can keep 2 people sped up/slowed down at the SAME time.\n\n*Generally if you can, try to pick a person off with a slow down if they are out of position or trying to kite you. The only times I recommend using speed up is if you have someone on your team that really wants to dive the opposing carry (i.e. Olaf) or when you're trying to get away (self-evident).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343782724", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, philistines, let's listen to some new music.\n\n[](/scootie) [tUnE-yArDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tune-Yards) is a solo project by multi-instrumentalist Merril Garbus. Her first album, [Bird-Brains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird-Brains), was done entirely on her own and entirely without a bass. That wasn't an artistic choice, unfortunately, she just didn't have access to a bass. From that album, she was able to get enough publicity to sign on [4AD Records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD_Records). That signing built excitement for her next album, [w h o k i l l](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whokill), released in 2011. With the increased technology she has access to comes cleaner production, more experimentation and some truly experimental songs. There's so many different instruments that you never know what you're going to run into from track to track. They all play so brightly and with such personality that, if it had been any other singer, they might've drowned out the vocals. Merril has a very strong and memorable voice that rises above any instrumentation behind her. It also has an intense androgyny to it which keeps the listener really interested throughout the album.\n\n[](/scratch) I think the most important part of *w h o k i l l* is the variation in musical styles. Merril seems intent on packing in as many different styles of music as she can onto one album. This would usually sound chaotic and discordant but because the styles all share common roots, Meril manages to bring everything together in a cohesive package. *Powa* is a slower funk beat, [Bizness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ1LI-NTa2s) grooves with a modernized Afro beat drive, [You Yes You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_5vG0-bvP0) evokes memories of R&amp;B songs and [My Country](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2uW2PmVSe8) is the least folkiest folk song I've ever heard. This music from this album draws heavily from music that originated from black culture and keeps that flavor without bastardizing it. The extra instrumentation and all the eccentricities are there to add to the song. They aren't the focus. The song, and actually the entire album, are incredibly consistent in their focus and tone. It never loses itself in its experimentation or its personality. \n\n[](/z33) *tUnE-yArDs* seems to be doing its best to break down that preconception of experimental music being heady and dull. It's proving that these kinds of songs can be fun and exciting. Experimental music doesn't have to limit itself to discovering the serious parts of music. What do you think of experimental music?

{"body": "The major scale is also used in training based on the Western Art tradition because any minor scales require a different scale going up (A B C D E F# G# A) and down (A G F E D C B A).

{"body": "This is going to be a long read, so if you don't have time just go to the tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI've been lucky to have some *great* teachers so far, but I've got a pretty horrendous story from the administration level. I used to go to a school district for Elementery and Junior High, and in the last years at that district, the superintendent decided to retire and his successor had this pet project that she had worked on since University. Anyways this project was to convert the current grading system into a grossly generalized lettered grading score. This isn't like the A B C D F system you find in the States though, the original system was a three lettered  grading for the younger kids, it was O(verachieving) M(eeting Expectations) L(acking), while Junior High got a percentile grading system. The percentile is important, because the school I went to was closer to High Schools outside the district, which is a lot more convenient for most of the students, and to transfer to those high schools you had to have a certain percentage/decent grades to get in. What the superintendent wanted to do was replace the Junior High and Elementary grading system to a rehash of the Elementry grading system.\n\nEssentially she made it so that Junior High grades were very generalized and effectively gave students and parents no idea how well they were doing. You could have two people with the same grade letterwise, yet percentage wise, they could be more than a couple dozen percentage points apart. With alot of these kids at my school transferring out of the district, it was going to be very difficult to know for sure if they would be accepted. The teachers and school administration wern't happy as well, and openly objected to it. The superintendent held meetings where parents and teachers could voice their concerns. My mother researched for dozens of hours proving how flawed the system was but it soon became apparent that the meetings were basically the superintendent saying \"Fuck your opinions, mine are better.\"\n\nWhen this became clear, my school seriously considered applying to the provincial government to become a charter school. This failed and the new grading system was put in place with little opposition. I was lucky to not be affected by this, as I graduated from Junior High the year before, but my siblings were and still are affected.\n\nIt gets worse. As a petty act of revenge for attempting to leave the district, the superintendent 'relocated' the Principal to a new school the year after and the Vice Principal as well just this last winter. They were both loved by students and parents, but the new school administration isn't getting that same love. Why? Because the new Principal taught at a school where the teacher was making sexual advances on her (male) students. He never knew about it, nor did he do anything about it. The replacement for the Vice Principal... She just sucks.\n___________________________________\n\n**tl;dr Dolores Fucking Umbridge in real life Kindergartenizes Junior High Grading.

{"body": "&gt; From the vehemence of your comment, can we safely assume that you have done all of these things and come to the rational conclusion that your belief system is superior to all others\n\nWrong, I'm not the one relying on science to provide answers.  Science fails at the very first step: abiogensis.  There is no scientific proof of abiogenesis.  Period.  There's about eight or nine different hypotheses that explain how it \"might\" have happened.  They bombard a tank of H O N C with heat and light, find some simple molecules and go \"Tada!\"  Yet no experiment can manage to combine these incredibly simplistic building blocks into actual organisms, not even a simple virus.  Proposing that life is just \"simply\" a matter of having enough time and energy is pure delusion, a mind desperate to avoid the moral implications of a creator that they will literally believe anything.\n\nThere's the Fermi hypothesis, but even more simply than that, our planet exists in a solar system of other planets, all of which have received, on a grand scale ofdegrees, exposure to time and energy.  Why not silicon based life?  Why not complex molecules?  Those with faith are able to say the reason we are alone and unique is because it was intentional.  Those of science have to explain how a frail and brittle form of life like ours is the only one that shows up despite any number of models showing the superiority of, say, crystalline life forms.\n\nI have a reasonable faith based on evidence that persuades me.  I believe there was **some** unique spark that caused life, whether or not it was intentional, by design, part of some master plan, or simply because some alien passing through farted in our water... it doesn't matter.  Whatever the source, it was beyond our understanding of nature and science.\n\nThe same people who loudly proclaim \"There is no proof God exists!\" turn around and fund SETI despite the fact there is also no evidence aliens exist.  If it turns out God is really just an alien lifeform, well then what?  Magic/miracles/the supernatural could all just be natural laws that mankind doesn't yet understand.  \"God\" equals \"the unknown factor\".  An atheist is deluding himself because in proclaiming \"there is no God\" he must claim a total and complete knowledge of science in order to be able to distinguish the natural from the supernatural.  And any atheist who can claim that is either lying or delusional.\n\nI'd rather be an honest person of faith than a delusional hypocrite.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343910409", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The dorian or II mode is D E F G A B C D, the phrygian or III mode is E F G A B C D E and so on and so on. Start on a different note in the same key signature. Modes are useful because they lend a different sound to key signatures than the typical major and minor keys (the I and vi modes respectively). \n\nTo get a little more detailed, once you learn a little music theory (triads and chord progressions) you understand that the common chords progressions in the ionian mode can be transposed to a different mode to give that particular chord progression a different feel. ( I IV V I ) for example.\n\nHope I didn't lose you.

{"body": "Sure. If you're not familiar with hexadecimal/binary do a search for an explanation, it'll make it easier. \n\nBasically, everyone uses a base 10 number system (decimal) to represent numbers.  True/false answers can be represented in a single base 2 (binary) value (0 or 1).  The number of binary values (*n*) that can be stored in a base *x* number system is *x*= 2^*n* . For decimal (base 10) this is 10=2^*n* giving *n* = 3.32.  This is rounded down to 3 since we can't represent a fraction of data.  Storing true/false answers in decimal would mean we could store 3 answers in every decimal number.  For 50 answers we would need to memorize 17 numbers.  Not bad but we can do better.\n\nHexadecimal is a base 16 number system that uses A-F to represent 10-15 (0123456789ABCDEF).  The significance of base 16 is that a single number can store 4 binary numbers.  We can go one further and do a base 32 number system that can store 5 binary numbers (32=2^5 using the formula from before). That means for 50 t/f answers we only need to memorize 10 number/characters.\n\nThe key part is being able to convert t/f answers to a base 32 number and then back to t/f answers.  This is where understanding binary/hexadecimal is important.  Say you have 5 t/f answers that are T F T T F and we say that T=1 and F=0.  This would translate to 10110 in binary.  Converting binary to a base 32 system is done by multiplying each digit by it's factor.  The factor is determined by the digit number (0-4) and is 2^*n* . 10110 would be converted as 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22.  That means 10110 is the 22nd number in our base 32 system (0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV) or the letter M.  Do the opposite to convert back to t/f answers.\n\nIt's not too bad once you understand binary/decimal/hexadecimal number systems.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343965333", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

The charts you get in less developed areas will likely be based on 200 year old hydrography, and will get you wrecked if you trust them completely. Nothing beats local knowledge from fellow cruisers, or very recent guidebooks.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt.\n\nLocal fishermen will not know where the water is too shallow for your boat, or will know, lead you onto it, and try to charge you to pull you off of it, breaking things in the process. Or not.\n\nUsually the \"local fisherman\" that -comes out- to help you is not....he is the guy that makes a living off of cruisers coming into the harbor. \n\nBuyer beware.\n\nHow can you tell if someone is actually a local fisherman? (they will be fishing, and ignoring you.)\n\nGO S L O W INTO NEW HARBORS. Bare steerageway. the \"fisherman\" that goes fast is trying to get you good and stuck...better to feel your way in on your own bottom.\n\nDo not make an entrance at night unless you must (almost never). \n\nIn less developed ports, marker color is meaningful only about 50% of the time. Usually the marker marks something, just hard to say what.\n\n\nWhen possible go in with your dinghy and a portable depth sounder to understand the marks first. \n\nContact local cruisers on VHF find someone who knows the entrance from -recent- experience, and ask them how to enter.\n\nYou are almost always safer at sea than making an entrance under unforgiving conditions, despite how miserable you feel.\n\nLearn how to SAIL your boat\n\nLearn how to sail YOUR boat\n\nLEARN how to sail your boat.\n\nhave different types of anchors. The only anchor that -almost- always works is a double oversized bruce on 50' plus of double oversized (for you, 3/4\") chain. \n\nBut that is a monster on a '51, so have a couple plows, a couple danforths, and double anchor whenever possible.\n\nTrain and drill your crew. Do not let the first time you reef under difficult conditions be when it really counts. \n\nWatch for opportunities to perform tasks under non critical, but difficult conditions, and practice them.\n\nwhen possible, practice sailing your boat up to anchor or a mooring, or a dock. Keep your engine at idle, just in case. There will come a day when this is not an option. Practice these things a a familiar harbor, not one where you don't know the hazards.\n\nWatch for the 3 strikes....One thing stacked against you, well thats normal. 2 things....hmmmm 3 things...now you have no margin. Avoid if possible.\n\nGet a hookah system (a $99 oiless compressor (assuming you have a genset that will run it), a carbon house type water filter (not one of the puny ones, use one with a 10\" replacable cartridge) to clean the air, some air hose, and a used scuba regulator) It will be worth its weight in gold, and loads of fun too. Trying to hold your breath while you unfoul things below sucks.\n\n....I could go on and on, but I think this is maybe these are the most imprtant unobvious things.\n\nEdit: Almost forgot!\n\nHave a reliable way to get weather info!!! learn to use it before you go.\nAt a bare minimum, NAVTEX works most places, most of the time... SSB with weatherfax software will work 70% of the time if properly set up, A simple sattelite system, if properly installed, is worth it, whether Iridium, Skymate, or other. Skymate and iridium are cheap, as long as you dont use them too much....but they will work when nothing else does. \n\nKnow your weather, or use a weather routing service, one or the other - preferrably the first, or both.\n\nGPS has opened cruising to the masses, but knowing where you are and what the weather might be does not make one Poseidon....the Sea remains unchanged, -and untamed-. 500 foot freighters still go down due to bad weather. They probably knew exactly where they were, and what the weather was most likely to do. \n\nInformation cannot replace sound judgement, and in fact, often hinders it.\n\nFor example, with A GPS and \"good\" charting, one might try a difficult entrance at night to escape uncomfortable conditions....or \"knowing\" that the weather will be good, one might try to make a passage for which one is not fully prepared should things go south...These are the modern equivalent of the siren's song...beware.\n\nEdit: Oh Yeah, and THIS: wind against tide, just about died.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344017106", "subreddit": "sailing", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "O.K here we go: A Pentatonic scale has several problems associated with it. Think of it like a Highway, it takes you  up and down the road, but you don't see anything. A really good way to study this is to make a chart.\n  On the column of the chart on the left write A7 ( AC#EG) then D7 ( DF#AC) then E7 ( EG# BD) these are the I7 IV7 V7 chords for A major now across the top of the chart write the A blues scale ( we leave out the flat 5 when analyzing like this) so A C D E G -A pentatonic -also called A blues scale( technically A blues scale= A C D Eb E G) now compare each note to each chord filling in the chart and it looks like this\n A7 rel to A blues A=1 C=b3 D=4 E=5 G=b7. D7 rel to A blues A=5 C=b7 D=1 E=2 G= 4. E7 rel to A blues A =4, C=#5 , D=b7 E=1 G=b3\n Now there are other chords you could do this with as well but here is the point. THERE ARE NO MAJOR 3RDS HERE!!! So you have to add them in or you will never \" prove \"any of the major chords you play over, Now if you analyze F# minor pentatonic with the same chords A7 D7 E7, you will find a C# note for the third of the A, an F# note for the 3rd of the D7 still no G# note for the 3rd of the E7. \n So we need to add in the correct 3rds ( the flat 3rd sounds good, it's called a \" blue note\" but at a certain point you will want the major third of the chord.) \n At this point you will notice that instead of having a \" blanket scale\" that fixes/covers everything, we now have a situation where the walls and doors are moving, in that C# is the correct 3rd of A7 but the wrong 7 for D7( which would have a C note not a C#) G# is the correct 3rd of E7 but the wrong 7 for A7( which would have a G note not a G#) \n So now that we are attempting to add to the scale at the appropriate time, it becomes important to know what chord we are playing over and when.\n A great exercise is to make a fretboard map of your guitar, show the pentatonic scale in dots, the I7 chord in x's the IV7 chord in triangles and the V7 chord in open circles ( so some frets will have 2 markings) , by superimposing one fretboard chart over the other, you can see a little about what is happening. Also make a chart of the Major and Minor pentatonic together so make a map of A pentatonic and F# pentatonic, and try switching back and forth.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344100982", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

When you're looking to infect as many PC's as possible, you'll look at the stats, realise that 9/10 home computers are windows, and dedicate time scripting an exploit for that platform. If Macs were in the majority, there'd be an increase of exploit research and therefore more virii.

First, C - E - F - C. Strum each chord 4 times then switch to the next one. So, you'll have C C C C E E E E F F F F C C C C. Sing along with it and this will match with \"Puff the magic dragon, lived by the sea.\"\n\nAfter you get that down, move on to the second part - F - C - A - D - G. Strum the first F and the C 4 times each, the A and D 2 times each, and finally the G 4 times. So, you'll have F F F F C C C C A A D D G G G G. Singing along will match with \"And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee.\"\n\nPut those peices together and you'll have C - E - F - C - F - C - A - D - G (or written out completely CCCCEEEEFFFFCCCCFFFFCCCCAADDGGGG). This is called a chord progression. It simply repeats throughout the song and forms the basic structure of the song. Hit those chords a steady rhythm and you'll hear it start to sound like puff the magic dragon.\n\nNext step is building your rhythm to match how you hear the song in your head. Take the pattern and instead of playing C four times, play one long and two short, one really long, 8 really short, anything really as long as the time you spend on C remains the same. It's really hard to explain, but once you get the steady 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 ... C C C C F F F F ... down, this part will most likely just happen.\n\nTL;DR: No tab. No need. Learn it by ear.

{"body": "Well diatonically, the chords in a major scale go M m m M M m dim (M). In a minor scale it's m dim M m m M M (m). Now that's just the most basic way of going about chords by building in diatonic thirds, of course you can turn those chords into more complex ones such as 7ths and so on. Now as far as your specific question, using a chord that's in another key is called a modal interchange chord. In the case of an Emaj being used in a song in Em, it would be borrowing from the parallel major, meaning the one with the same tonic. There are really no rules as far as when this is applicable, so just use it when it sounds right or good to you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344223976", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Here is an answer I wrote for a question that just scrolled off of this page , if you scroll down you can see the other students question. Here is my answer.\nO.K here we go: A Pentatonic scale has several problems associated with it. Think of it like a Highway, it takes you up and down the road, but you don't see anything. A really good way to study this is to make a chart. On the column of the chart on the left write A7 ( AC#EG) then D7 ( DF#AC) then E7 ( EG# BD) these are the I7 IV7 V7 chords for A major now across the top of the chart write the A blues scale ( we leave out the flat 5 when analyzing like this) so A C D E G -A pentatonic -also called A blues scale( technically A blues scale= A C D Eb E G) now compare each note to each chord filling in the chart and it looks like this A7 rel to A blues A=1 C=b3 D=4 E=5 G=b7. D7 rel to A blues A=5 C=b7 D=1 E=2 G= 4. E7 rel to A blues A =4, C=#5 , D=b7 E=1 G=b3 Now there are other chords you could do this with as well but here is the point. THERE ARE NO MAJOR 3RDS HERE!!! So you have to add them in or you will never \" prove \"any of the major chords you play over, Now if you analyze F# minor pentatonic with the same chords A7 D7 E7, you will find a C# note for the third of the A, an F# note for the 3rd of the D7 still no G# note for the 3rd of the E7. So we need to add in the correct 3rds ( the flat 3rd sounds good, it's called a \" blue note\" but at a certain point you will want the major third of the chord.) At this point you will notice that instead of having a \" blanket scale\" that fixes/covers everything, we now have a situation where the walls and doors are moving, in that C# is the correct 3rd of A7 but the wrong 7 for D7( which would have a C note not a C#) G# is the correct 3rd of E7 but the wrong 7 for A7( which would have a G note not a G#) So now that we are attempting to add to the scale at the appropriate time, it becomes important to know what chord we are playing over and when. A great exercise is to make a fretboard map of your guitar, show the pentatonic scale in dots, the I7 chord in x's the IV7 chord in triangles and the V7 chord in open circles ( so some frets will have 2 markings) , by superimposing one fretboard chart over the other, you can see a little about what is happening. Also make a chart of the Major and Minor pentatonic together so make a map of A pentatonic and F# pentatonic, and try switching back and forth.\n\n   ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344224528", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Anyways.\n\nI was at a Church Camp started by a bunch of Churches I had never been to, my cousin invited me to go with him to his Church's Church Camp. It was pretty fun really, there was (I was 14 at the time) hot teenage girls, go karts, and this big ass water slide made out of a plane advertisement sign with water running down it. The whole program lasted about 5 days, and on the last day there was a big competition in the main building. All the Church groups gathered in the room and sat down in chairs (this place was massive). Our group had gotten into the 2nd row. The Lead Preacher started picking out kids while he was explaining the objective, I didn't really hear the objective, all I heard was Who likes soup? So I raised my hand. Then as I got closer to the stage he repeated himself and I heard exactly what the objective was. It wasn't any normal soup, it was cold ABC vegetable soup, the worst soup known to God. We had to take the soup, pour it on a tray, grab a handful, shove it in our mouths (that's what she said), and fumble it through our mouths (that's what she said)  to get letters and spit them out. Whoever spelled the biggest word wins. The race began with me stuffing my mouth as much as possible(that's what she said), about 15 minutes later I spit my letters out and began to make words. The letters I got were O T L I T E S, so for the win I spelled T-O-I-L-E-T-S, after I won my group was going crazy, the shirt I had just gotten a week ago was covered in nasty disgusting soup.

Hopefully I'll go back for a master's degree someday, but for now I'm ecstatic to be heading off to university for the first time.

So far I get that you like school.**\n&gt;\n&gt;One of my favorite places to be is in the kitchen, baking or cooking up something delicious. I'm always ready to try out a new recipe or fall back on one of my favorites and I love spending time with people, whether cooking with or for them.\n&gt;\n&gt;When I think about what I like most about meeting people online, it's the first dates I get to have. There's something really fun about that transition between being strangers and becoming friends that I like compressing into a few hours.\n&gt;\n&gt;I love playgrounds. Mostly the swings.\n&gt;\n&gt;I love having my hand held, or any kind of affection. Cuddling might be my favorite.\n\n&gt;What I’m doing with my life\n\n&gt;I'm getting ready to go to Michigan Tech! It's a university way up in the UP, and I am beyond excited to get there. I'll be majoring electrical engineering with no idea of what I'll be when I grow up. Engineering degrees can take you in so many different directions, and I'm actually pretty excited about all that uncertainty.\n&gt;\n&gt;I'm also a housekeeper for a vacation rental company in Saugatuck for the summer. It's pretty important to me to have a job as often as I can, and I'll definitely be looking for one on campus come the fall. Ideally, I'll find a job at the tutoring center. I was a math tutor all through CC, and I really enjoyed it.\n\n&gt;I’m really good at\n\n&gt;Math, Art, Being happy\n\n&gt;~~Learning, Working~~, Traveling\n\n&gt;Being content, ~~Reading~~, Teaching\n\n&gt;Playing**??**, Making others happy\n\n&gt;~~Taking tests~~, Giving hugs, Babysitting\n\n&gt;The first things people usually notice about me\n\n&gt;My smile, so I hear. Also possibly my hair, or my height. ~~:)~~\n\n&gt;Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food\n\n&gt;Books: I love reading. My favorite author is John Green, and I already like you if you're excited about nerdfighteria. Check out his youtube channel, Vlogbrothers. I love Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 1984, Looking for Alaska, The Handmaid's Tale, The Time Traveler's Wife, The Fault in our Stars, Feed, The Giver, Gathering Blue, and The Messenger. I love a lot of other books too, I just can't remember them right now.\n&gt;\n&gt;Movies: There aren't many movies I don't like. I love watching movies with people (though not if it's all I do with them), whether we're cuddling, laughing and talking, or just sitting back and watching.\n&gt;\n&gt;Shows: I watch Adventure Time, The League, Bones, House, a few sitcoms, a lot of Food Network, Psych, How I met your Mother, and a few others occasionally.\n&gt;\n&gt;Music: I like Death Cab for Cutie, Mika, Kimya Dawson, Train, sometimes Maroon Five, a lot of things on the radio, but not all of it. I really don't listen to music much outside of the car and when I'm with my music loving friends. But I probably like your music, so don't hate on my lack of passion.\n&gt;\n&gt;Food: I love most food. I love cooking, and trying new things, and getting other people to try new things. We eat a lot of Mexican food (yeah, the Americanized version) in my house. I'll eat anything that's put in front of me, and I'll be impressed if you like cooking, even if you suck at it.\n\n&gt;The six things I could never do without\n\n&gt;Learning new things\n\n&gt;Catching up with friends\n\n&gt;Meeting new people\n\n&gt;Spending time with my little sister\n\n&gt;Visiting big cities\n\n&gt;Dresses\n\n&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking about\n\n&gt;Math takes up a lot of space in my head. I calculate really random things when I get bored. I'm the person you want to go to if you need the volume of an octogonal prism, because I'm the kind of girl who will try to teach herself how to find the area of an octogon right then and there.\n&gt;\n&gt;Besides that, I love admiring things. Sometimes that means checking beautiful people out from across the room, but it's more likely to mean that I notice how well a dress fits or how nicely those shoes compliment a person's style.\n\n&gt;On a typical Friday night I am\n\n&gt;Hanging with my friends. We have picnics a lot, or go to steak and\n&gt;shake. Sometimes we hit up the hookah lounge nearby. Sometimes we just chill at someone's house and watch movies or bake cookies.\n&gt;\n&gt;I love the beach. It's my favorite place to be, during the summer.\n&gt;\n&gt;If I'm staying home for the night, I'm probably cooking dinner for\n&gt;or with my family, sewing up some new project, or hanging with my younger sister watching TV.\n&gt;\n&gt;I also like camping, museums (especially art or science), and aquariums.\n\n&gt;The most private thing I’m willing to admit\n\n&gt;I feel like this is the point in answering all the questions on this site. Just so you know, I probably won't message you back if you've answered almost no questions unless you're profile is somehow outstanding.\n\n&gt;I’m looking for\n\n&gt;Guys and girls who like bi girls\n\n&gt;Ages 18–22\n\n&gt;Near me\n\n&gt;For new friends, short-term dating, activity partners\n\n&gt;You should message me if\n\n&gt;I don't bite, and I love meeting new people.

{"body": "The A minor scale is A B C D E F G, and the triads you can make out of those notes are Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G.  Note that just because these are the only triads you can make out of those notes doesn't mean they're the only ones you're allowed to use!  You can use literally anything you want.  Whether it'll sound good or not, well, that's a different question, but you *can* use anything.\n\nNow, Western music is based on the V-I progression, and it really depends on that V being a major chord (actually, V7 being a dominant 7th chord).  The minor mode doesn't have that.  So, people use V instead of v, and now the chords are Am, Bdim, C, Dm, E, F, G.  Only thing that changes is that you use V instead of v, nothing else.  In fact, the v is a very rare chord to use in traditional Western music.  You'll mostly see it when the composer wants to change keys; he's most likely to head to the v for a key change.  Other than that, though, it's not used.  If you play an Em7-Am progression, you'll see that the Em7 sounds awesome.  For some reason, 18th and 19th century Western composers didn't like it.  They were obviously high on hashish because it's a great chord.  Anyway.\n\nWhat we call the harmonic scale is actually not a scale at all.  It's just the collection of pitches from which the chords are taken, but it's only used for the V chord -- the bIII and bVII aren't considered important enough.  This actually makes sense, as, when you use those chords, you're basically modulating to the key of the bIII.  You'll also notice that if you actually play the scale, you'll hit upon a very awkward augmented second between the b6 and the 7, the F and the G#.  You have to use the G# when going up to A, since it's the leading tone (again, this is 18th and 19th century \"wisdom\" and should not be taken as true just because Bach did it), but if you're going down from the A, you're not using this leading tone so you can use the G natural.  As a result, when playing a scale upwards, the 6 is also raised to #6 in order to avoid that augmented second, and it's lowered back down on the way down.  So you might play A B C D E F# G# A G F E D C B A.  This is called the melodic minor scale.  Some people will use that F# in chords when it's being used to go up to G# then A.  I just use it all the time, and keep the 7th lowered, because I love the dorian mode.\n\nThe harmonic and melodic scales are kind of silly phenomenological constructs to explain how the minor mode is actually handled by Western composers.  In that context, they're not real modes like the minor mode; they're just scales that represent certain aspects of playing in minor.  It's all because they really like their leading tones.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that *you* shouldn't use the harmonic and melodic minor scales in other ways.  The melodic minor scale, where the 6th and 7th are permanently raised, *is* used in jazz to make chords, and the bIII does become bIII+.  The harmonic minor scale is used all the time in the slightly less Western music of Judaism and Eastern Europe, augmented second and all, but the harmonies don't always stick to that scale because it is kind of awkward.  So you can go ahead and make music with those scales however you want, because There Are No Rules In Music or something like that.\n\nBy the way, I was reading through the comments and you mentioned that you want your progression to be Am F C G.  Where have you heard that before?  (Answer: EVERY SINGLE ROCK SONG EVER.)  It's a very, very common progression.  And it's also in C major, not A minor.  Actually, that's not really true -- in reality, it's ambiguous.  The main chords of a key are the I/i, V, and IV/iv, and F, C, and G are the IV, I, and V of C major.  They are much more a part of C major than of A minor.  G-Am in particular is the deceptive cadence in C major.  So you could say it's in A minor, but you'd have to justify it somehow.  However, music theory is *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*, and this means that you can do whatever you want.  Music theory doesn't have rules for your composition; it only has rules for what sounds the \"best\", and you're free to ignore them.  If your music still sounds good anyway, then it's your music theory that needs to be revised, not your music!

{"body": "Self Summary\n\nAlthough tricks like playing with text can be fun and amusing, it's an advertising trick that makes people speed up their reading to get to the bottom quicker. I basically skipped your entire self summary the first time I ran across your profile and had to go back to read it.\n\n&gt;I use \"big\" words such as conflate, eschew and antepenultimate.\n\nIf you use big words just use them. Just like with all things in profiles, saying things seems very pretentious instead of just acting them out ie using big words.\n\n&gt;Some of it gets a little hokey.\n&gt;\n&gt;I refuse to believe that nice guys finish last.\n&gt;\n&gt;I support a woman's right to choose.\n&gt;\n&gt;I say \"please\" and \"thank you\" to servers.\n&gt;\n&gt;I am educated and nerdy.\n\nThese are either overused or so typical of DC that it's not really needed to point out. Especially for someone that is LGBT. I don't meet a lot of people that can't at least say thanks to servers.\n\nWhat I’m doing with my life\n\nNothing too far out of the ordinary. Talking about cats will likely land you in the cat people department.\n\n&gt;If you're too busy climbing mountains and kayaking and being photographed rappelling down cliffs to catch the latest Bob's Burgers, you need to reassess your priorities. I think it's great that your abs are visible and that you can hang from a rock by one hand, I really do. In fact, I would applaud if I weren't holding two remotes. :) Just kidding.\n\nRegardless of jokes, people usually don't like being insulted before you actually meet them. As someone who doesn't mountain climb or hack a six pack, I'm pretty close. I ride about 50-60 miles a week through the city when not taking classes locally. All that made me feel is that you don't like working out and wish people were more accepting of bad eating habbits and being comfortable as they are. Sadly I think that's why our country is so unhealthy. Acceptance of our lazy habbits. Does it bother me that you are not someone who works out all the time? Nah to each his own, but the kidney punch isn't a great way to reach out in a profile. Especially in the LGBT community. Hell if I see another guy with arms as big as my legs I might cry before I go to bed.\n\n&gt;FOOD:\n&gt;\n&gt;• Fruits • Vegetables • Lean Meats\n&gt;\n&gt;• Sushi • Thai • Indian • French • Italian • Mexican\n&gt;\n&gt;• Pasties • Cherries • Bailey's\n\nLittle touches like these are a nice addition for a writer. The self summary just reminds me of myspace profiles in high school. Often riddled with a hard case of the I's. I I I I I I. For a writer I would hope for a little more creative writing instead of starting every other sentence with I and continuing the sentence half way though with another I.\n\n&gt;I love food but I'm not a \"foodie.\" I didn't realize we needed a special term for people who take more than a cursory interest in cuisine. You know seven ways to use cilantro. Congrats. I can appreciate your enthusiasm, but for me, it's simple: good food is good food. It doesn't really matter how big my food vocabulary is, I'm still just a hungry, hungry hippo. If it tastes good and isn't too high in the bad stuff, I'm happy. And you know what? That tomato was dehydrated in a factory. Sun dried, my ass. :)\n\nMore strange insults that have nothing to do with you or your profile. I really see no gain in adding a paragraph like this. If you aren't a foodie don't put it. It would be like putting \"Hey I'm not one of those black guys, you know with the A-Typical big johnson...\" so on and so forth. Just doesn't belong.\n\n&gt;• How exhausting online \"dating\" can be\n\nAnother indirect insult.\n\n&gt;Ages 21–35\n\nIt seems like you need to be on adult finder if this is your acceptable age range.\n\n&gt;• You are not racist, sexist, fundamentalist, homophobic, biphobic, xenophobic, etc. You can be photophobic...that's a different kind of phobic...but not podophobic, because I do have feet.\n\nVery redundant and does not give the impression of being well thought out, especially since you have been with OKC so long you have fatigue. Most of those things are answered in people's questions and are easy to mark as mandatory answers. And I don't know many people that are going to want to date an LGBT that are most of those either. So you are preaching to the choir, and as a tenor you know how pointless that is.\n\nOK! Well that's just what I get out of it from a negative nancy standpoint. Please understand that anything you disagree with is great, but instead of responding to me with better detail, look at how your profile can say the things you want to say to me. Because in the end, if you message someone and they don't respond you don't really have this opportunity to explain in better detail.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344378504", "subreddit": "OkCupid", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In cryptography, there's something called a \"Polybius square\" which is a way of encoding a message using an alphabet with fewer characters. It works like this: lets say you wanted to send a message that uses an alphabet with 25 characters (i.e. a standard alphabet, minus J, which is replaced by I), with an alphabet that just uses five characters, say the numbers 1 through 5. Then you put it in a table, sort-of like this:\n\n      | 1 2 3 4 5\n    --+---------\n    1 | A B C D E\n    2 | F G H I K \n    3 | L M N O P\n    4 | Q R S T U\n    5 | V W X Y Z\n\nThe message \"ATTACK\" then becomes \"11 45 45 11 13 31\". This way of putting letters in a square is an important intermediate step in many ciphers, including [The Playfair Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher) and [ADFGVX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX) (the ADFGVX use of this technique is particularly clever). \n\nAnyway, the point is that this system cannot only be used for cryptography, it can also greatly simplify communication over long distance. Polybius invented so that you could communicate efficiently with torches. Instead of needing 25 different torches, each torch representing a letter of the alphabet, you now only need 5 torches, or even less if you're clever. \n\nIt is said (though I can't find a reference, so take it for what you will) that Polybius squares have been used for all sorts of \"simple\" long distance communications, including smoke signals, drums, torches, lamps, whatever. It is at least feasible that you can use smoke signals using a system like this to transmit complex messages (i.e. for more advanced messages than \"Hey guys, dudes are attacking, you should probably do something about that\"), since you would only need five separate \"symbols\" for the smoke. \n\n(of course, this system for long-distance communication was replaced by Morse code, and later binary code that computers use, but Polybius squares have the advantage of being much simpler than either of those).

Irrelevant, but still important: 405 MS makes her movement animation badass, it's half the reason I make her go so fast.\n\nAiming her Q takes some finesse, as the timing on it is dependent on how far away you've sent the target. Also, you don't need to necessarily aim it so it lands square on the target - sometimes it's better to overshoot to the left of Diana so they can't dodge it so easily.

{"body": "Religions (as far as my experience goes) do not promise that their adherents will be the most happy, on average, on the space of A x B x ... x N attributes. They promise you will be blessed, and that their method of living is a good one for achieving a good outcome on observable and/or unobservable attributes. For Mormonism in particular, blessings may be both temporal and spiritual. In other words, the promised blessings are often unobservable. Or they will only be observed in a different world, after death. It is impossible to test claims that are unobservable, and any attempt to test observable claims are easily explained away (if they come up negative) by believers. Often, this happens by saying that there are confounding forces at work: God is testing you to make you stronger. It rains on the just and the unjust. That type of thing.\n\nIn any case, empirical studies are *not* proof, per se. They are simply evidence, which may allow a person to make a better, more informed, more accurate judgment. So you've read 10 studies, 7 of which say to you Mormonism's claims are wrong, 1 of which says they are true, 2 of which are indeterminate. You adjust your priors accordingly. From a scientific standpoint, you can say the claims of Mormonism (or any other religion) are extremely unlikely to be true. But you cannot say with certainty that they are false.\n\n**tl;dr** - Empirical evidence is *not* proof. In fact, that was 'proven' in the 18th century, by David Hume, if I am not mistaken.\n\nEdit: Personally, I think the probability of the existence of any given god is completely negligible. For all intents and purposes, I am an atheist. I just took exception to your statement that unless a person fully embraces atheism, he or she is doing it wrong.

What - do you want to jump in a vacuum? Enough of excuses, please. Just admit that your personal best, your preparations, and your actual performance were not enough against the world's best.

Now another 'Olympian' kuno is blaming the host country's weather for her dismal performance..  How pathetic have our athletes (and sports officials) have become that they can find any rubbish reason just to justify their poor perfomance in the Olympics? You're blaming the cold weather??  WTF!! You're competing in Europe so what do you expect??  Ginawin ka pala, di sana dito ka na lang sa Cebu tumalon, tutal, personal best lang naman ang target mo.. Yung pinangbayad sa ticket mo, di sana itinulong na lang sa relief goods para sa mga nasalanta ng baha..

No wonder her poor performance went alongside her mental set.  An athlete is not only physically able to perform  but also emotionally and mentallyconditioned to aim to win.\n\nNotice how Victoria pendleton carried the pressure of defending her title in Beijing for four years. She said it was the worst four years of her life since Beijing. Chris Hoy, another British who is retiring after his sixth Olympic gold cried while receiving his gold. I can only imagine how mentally  drained and exhausted these athletes were because they were aiming to win with all their heart , mind and soul.\n\n    Like\n    Reply\n\n    22 hours ago\n    1 Like\n    F\n\nBoyong\n\nI notice the way our athletes played in the Olympics.

What about those Kenyans, Ethiopians, Grenadines, Qataris, Singaporeans, etc. whose climates are similar to ours and even much inhospitable (the likes of Qatar, Kenya and Ethiopia)? Kenyans and Ethiopians for sure didn't have the means to fly to other countries to train in world-class venues as Torres would like to suggest. Torres would have been forgiven for her failure but when she blamed the weather for her fate, is ridiculous. She also did the same in Beijing when she failed to advance. Where does she think an Olympic be held? Should it be like an open university where each contestant performs in his home country and deliver the result to the Olympic officials wherever they are? Or decided by voting! This set up would surely make Torres a virtual champion as most Filipinos are known to be subjective voters!\n\n    Like\n    Reply\n\n    23 hours ago\n    1 Like\n    F\n\nlionhearted726\n\nI was saddened to look at the medal table that countries, whose land area (Belarus, Qatar, Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark, Cuba, Jamaica, Slovenia, Croatia, Estonia, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Serbia, Taiwan, Cyprus and Kuwait) and population (most of the above countries plus most of the bemedaled countries) are far smaller than ours, and some of them have economy are much smaller and even poorer than we are, still managed to salvage at least a single bronze. Grenada, barely half the size of Metro Manila, and a population smaller than San Juan, was able to produce gold courtesy of its trackster.\n\nMongolia, Dominican Republic, Kenya, Ethiopia and North Korea are more economically challenged than Philippines but all of them produced medals.\n\n    Like\n    Reply\n\n    1 day ago\n    1 Like\n    F\n\nGarth Dax\n\nwe should aim olympic standard and not personal best, ang layo kaya!! nagpadala pa kau ng atleta and u still dream of getting a medal of any color... dream on PSC\n\n    Like\n    Reply\n\n    1 day ago\n    3 Likes\n    F\n\nlionhearted726\n\nI don't believe our country could only produce 11 athletes for the London Olympics. I don't believe either that they are the best our country could get. You see, the steeplechase runner is only aiming to improve his personal best, by getting a 14:10:00 on 5000 meters long distance run. He even fell short by 4 seconds! So was Torres herself who was also gunning to improve her personal record. Same with our swimmers and others. It is clear that our athletes were sent out to London for another thing in mind. They were sent there NOT TO WIN any medal at all but to improve their personal best record. Based on the result, only swimmer Lacuna hit his own goal by improving his personal record in the 200M freestyle by a negligible tenth of a second which was good only for the 32nd place out of 36!\n\nOur sports officials were fooling us to believe that the 11 athletes they sent out to London were hoping to give the country a medal of any color. Contrary to what they claimed however, these athletes were actually there only to improve their respective personal records! They were there NOT TO WIN MEDALS AT ALL!\n\n(Edited by author 1 day ago)\n\n    Like\n    Reply\n\n    1 day ago\n    3 Likes\n    F\n\ndoncleo\n\ngusto lang ng ating mga sports officials at athletes na mamasyal...basta lang masabi na naka-participate...ang laban nga ay baka makatsamba...pagbalik sa pinas ay may parada pa....kung ang personal best ay di rin lang naman aabot sa qualifying standard ng olympic record ay huwag na sana ipadala at dagdag lng sa gastos..ipunin na lng yan sa training at sana wala ng palakasan at pulitika sa sports.. mahiya naman kayong mga sports officials at mga pulitiko!!\n\n    Like\n    Reply\n\n    16 hours ago\n    in reply to lionhearted726\n    F\n\nDennis\n\nExcuses, excuses.

I would need a 30GG in a lot of Freya's bras, but I can fit into a Freya Deco 30G because it is a little bit roomier. \n\nThe U.K. sizing system goes A B C D DD E F FF G GG H HH J JJ K KK.\nThe U.S. sizing system goes A B C D DD DDD/E DDDD/F DDDDD/G DDDDDD/H. (Although the U.S. system is far from standardized. Those people are nuts.) \n\nBut if you look at it, a U.S. 34G is 8 inches larger than its band. A U.K. 34FF is 8 inches larger than its band. So there is a possibility that the sales girl sold you some U.K. styles and some U.S. styles. \n\nThe important thing to remember is that you'll need to try each new bra on in more than one cup size. Then you pick the one that fits best and send the others back. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344603904", "subreddit": "ABraThatFits", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not quite... it's easy to get confused trying to map modes into keys.\n\nThink about two things: the root note and the intervals included in the scale.\n\nC Major (Ionian) has C as a root note, and includes C (the root), D (the major 2nd), E (major 3rd), F (perfect 4th), G(perfect 5th), A(major 6th), and B (major 7th).  All major/ionian scales share the same set of intervals (R 2 3 4 5 6 7), but have different root notes (and so, different notes in each spot).\n\nC Dorian, in contrast, has C as a root, but includes C (the root), D (major 2nd), Eb (minor 3rd), F (perfect 4th), G (perfect 5th), A (major 6th), and Bb (minor 7th).  All Dorian scales share the same set of intervals: R 2 b3 4 5 6 b7.\n\nYou're observing that C Ionian contains the same notes as D Dorian, which is true, but they're not the same scale.  C Ionian contains C D E F G A B and D Dorian contains D E F G A B C, but these get their \"sound\" from the intervals they implement.  C Ionian is R 2 3 4 5 6 7 and D Dorian is R 2 b3 4 5 6 b7.\n\nWhen you say things like \"if I play a lick in the key of G major, I'm actually just playing C Mixolydian, yes?\" you kind of miss the point... modal sounds come from hearing particular intervals against a root note.  Playing in G Major means playing notes from this set G A B C D E F# in a context where the harmony suggests G as the root; playing in C Lydian means playing notes from this same set, but in a context where the harmony suggests C as the root.\n\nThe \"sound\" obtained is about the relationship between the notes in your scale (mode) and the harmonic context... not about whether you're playing any particular note.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344624119", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That's not how dota works, you do not counter pick a single certain hero. There are the few cases like Riki for AM is popular right? But there's really only a few that would work for. If only dota was this simple... right? Like apparently you only count it 1v1 wise. Hero X is picked, then heroes Y Z S F H are suggested or claimed to be good against hero X. That's just not how it works, therefore the site is useless. I know I will get down votes for this but I don't really care, I try to be honest with you. It would work if you would change it to picking one hero only. Like pick AM and then the page shows what is good and bad against that SINGLE hero. That way the site would serve a purpose, it's advice to maybe beginner or even advanced players.\n\nLet me be more clear. Only way you can do it is that you limit the user to one pick. Then you can show him what heroes are good against his choice, what heroes are \"ok\" whatever that means, and what heroes are bad, but for a 5 hero composition? No one will EVER be able to create an automated website just for this, not even pro s could accomplish that. In short words, countering one hero? Fine. But a 5 man hero squad? No way in hell this will never ever work out. Maybe with a little luck your algorythm shows something that MIGHT actually work, but usually it just will not. \n\nExample: http://i.imgur.com/gKlco.jpg\n\nThe choices you provide could work, like a mixture of these heroes and stuff, but they will not grant you an advantage. Where is the requested Windrunner, since my safe farming lane of Naga and Tide is dual melee? The page is not to blame, the community is not to blame, all I'm saying is that this site as it is right now will never ever work out. As I also said it can be useful for beginners if it was \" 1 pick will give  many options as to what is good against that pick or bad \" but like that, like a full 5 composition, never ever in hell will this be of ANY use at all.

{"body": "Phonology? I'm glad you asked!\n\nFirst of all, the particles are clitics, so they just behave as part of the preceding phonological word. It's like possessive 's in English, except I decided to spell them as separate words for clarity.\n\nUnderlyingly, there are seven consonants and three vowels:\n\n    /p/ /t/ /k/ /n/ /s/ /r/ /ʔ/\n    /a/ /i/ /u/\n\nFor convenience, these will be written with an alphabet called PA: &lt;a i k n p r s t u&gt; Glottal stops are not written, as they can be unambiguously omitted\n\nAs for syllables structure (again, underlyingly), only light CV syllables are permitted. In the PA alphabet, glottal stops are not written, because &lt;V&gt; is automatically /ʔV/. Morphemes may be polysyllabic, and words may be polymorphemic (but that's another topic).\n\nStress is trochaic, similar to English, but more pronounced and much more regular.\n\nBefore going on to the rules, I'm going to specify a second alphabet called AA to transcribe the surface form of the language more easily than using IPA. Unless otherwise specified, the AA letter corresponds to the IPA. All PA letters have the same value in AA such that PA is a subset of AA. Also, all voiceless stops are aspirated:\n\n&lt;a ä=/ɛ/ b d e=/ə/ g h i j=/dʒ/ k m n o p r s t u ü=/y/ v w y=/j/ z sh=/ʃ/ zh=/ʒ/ ch=/tʃ/ ng=/ŋ/ gh=/ɣ/&gt;\n\nThe phonological rules are as follows, and execute from top to bottom. Their explanations will be given below:\n\n    ASPIR,\n    STRESS,\n    SCHWADEL,\n    PAL,\n    PLACE,\n    DEBUCC,\n    DEGLOT,\n    VOICE,\n    ROUND,\n    RAISE,\n    DIPHTH,\n    SUBS,\n\nThe rules (given as sets rather than features in most cases because I'm lazy). You can figure out what natural classes are represented by the sets on your own. Transcriptions are AA (PA is a subset of AA, so it all works)\n\nASPIR - {p,t,k} -&gt; {p,t,k}[+extended VOT]\n   All voiceless stops are aspirated\n\nSTRESS - a -&gt; e/ in unstressed syllable\n   a becomes e if it is unstressed.\n\nSCHWADEL - e -&gt; null/{_#, C1_C1}\n   e is deleted if it occurs word finally, or between two identical consonants.\n\nPAL - {s,t} -&gt; {sh, ch}/_i\n   before i, s and t are palatized to sh and ch respectively\n\nPLACE - r and n change their place of articulation if the preceeding syllable contains a stop. Here is a a table. Columns are the preceeding stop.\n\n       p  t  k  /ʔ/\n\n    r  v  r  gh r\n\n    n  m  n  ng n\n\nDEBUCC - s -&gt; h /_u\n   the syllable su becomes hu\n\nDEGLOT - /ʔ/ -&gt; null/V_V\n   glottal stops are lost between vowels\n\nVOICE - [-voice] -&gt; [+voice]/V_V\n   intervocallic consontants are voiced\n\nROUND - a -&gt; o/[LAB]_\n   pa, ba, ma, and va become po, bo, mo, and vo.\n\nRAISE - a -&gt; ä/{k,g,gh}_\n   after k, g, and gh, a becomes ä\n\nDIPHTH vowels in hiatus become diphthongs. Outcomes specified below. If more that two vowels are in hiatus, the rule starts with the second vowel.\n\nSUBS - y -&gt; null/{sh,zh,ch,j}\n  y is lost in certain environments. The y is always the onset of a diphthong.\n\nVowel Outcomes- Rows are first vowel in series, columns are the second. The left column for each pair is for stress on the first vowel, the second column for each pair is for stress on the second vowel.\n\n    Word initial, isolated\n    2nd-&gt;aaiiuu__\n    1st\n    aaa\taa\tay\tey\taw\tew\ta\te\n    iye\tya\tyi\tiy\tiw\tyü\ti\ti\n    uwe\twa\tüy\twi\twu\tuw\tu\tu\n\n\n    after labial\n    2nd-&gt;\ta\ta\ti\ti\tu\tu\t_\t_\n    1st\n    a\toa\taa\toy\tey\tow\tew\to\te\n    i\tye\tya\tyi\tiy\tiw\tyü\ti\ti\n    u\twe\twa\tüy\twi\twu\tuw\tu\tu\n\n    after velar\n    2nd-&gt;\ta\ta\ti\ti\tu\tu\t_\t_\n    1st\n    a\t äa\taa\täy\tey\täw\tew\tü\te\n    i\tye\tyä\tyi\tiy\tiw\tyü\ti\ti\n    u\twe\twa\tüy\twi\twu\tuw\tu\tu\n\n    after non-back oral\n    2nd-&gt;\ta\ta\ti\ti\tu\tu\t_\t_\n    1st\n    a\taa\taa\tay\tey\taw\tew\ta\te\n    i\te\tä\ti\ti\tü\tü\ti\ti\n    u\twe\twa\tüy\twi\twu\tuw\tu\tu\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344767100", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

To be clear, this has not been proven or assured in the same way that that much of science has, and they are more how to make the best of our evolving and changing alphabet, which I hope was evident in my post. \n\nTypographic Design: Form and Communication has a wonderful section on legibility. Meggs cites many things that contribute to legibility: \n\n* Distinguishing characteristics of letters (do the gs look like qs? does the n and the h have a similar height? Does a D look too much like O?)\n\n* Capital and lowercase letters (is this easier to read OR IS THIS EASIER TO READ? Capitals make a wider word shape and take up more space, while looking overall rectangular and similar. This effect of all caps keeps our eye from distinguishing letters as quickly)\n\n* Interletter spacing and interword spacing (we see a word as a unit and shape thisisratherhardtoreadbecausetherearenospaces w h i l e t h i s i s t o o m u c h s p a c a n d w e c a n ' t s e e t h e u n i t s, this too slows down our legibility)\n\n* Other points include: weight (bold letters tend to close up the counterform), color contrast (red on neon green takes longer to read off of than black on white) and how the paragraph is formatted (if a paragraph is too wide or justified on the right side then we lose our anchor point of where the next line begins)\n\nAll of these effects have been tested on readers by timing their ability to finish a passage. You can find more on the topic [here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability).\n\nBut, at the end of it all, as I stated in the previous comment, this may be/most likely is because of how our alphabet and language evolved. I don't think that these are natural truths that root down into the very source of our biological being. It's probably just what we're used to.

{"body": "Glad to help... not sure I can explain the harmony part very well, though.\n\nThe simplest case is that a rhythm instrument is playing a simple harmony of a single chord.  Imagine a piano playing harmony, with a horn playing lead.\n\nWhen the piano sits on a Cmaj chord and the horn plays C D E F G A B, then all those scale tones are heard in relation to C and so the lead line sounds Ionian (major): C D E F G A B = R 2 3 4 5 6 7.\n\nIf the piano instead rides Dmin7 while the horn plays the same notes (C D E F G A B), those scale tones are heard in relation to D and so the lead line sounds Dorian: C D E F G A B = b7 R 2 b3 4 5 6.\n\nIt gets more complicated if you have a progression of chords, of course, but the basic idea is the same.  The harmony has a \"home chord\" that it emphasizes or resolves back to consistently, and so melodies over that progression are heard in relation to the root of the \"home chord\".  It seems subtle, but the larger harmonic context matters...\n\nPlaying C D E F G A B against a Gmaj chord could sound mixolydian if Gmaj is the only chord in the harmony.  But... imagine the harmony is Cmaj - Cmaj - Gmaj - Cmaj.  Now Gmaj is functioning as a non-root chord in the key of Cmaj. Even while playing C D E F G A B over the Gmaj, if the whole progression says \"C\", then you'll hear an Ionian (major) sound rather than a Mixolydian sound.  That's what's crazy to me: the same melody notes over the same harmony chord can sound Ionian or Mixolydian (or whatever) depending on how that harmony chord fits in with the larger chord progression or harmonic context.\n\nI'm not formally trained, so I'm probably not explaining this well, but I hope you see what I'm getting at...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344921661", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My problem with this is that if you're going to get raped, there's nothing you can say that's going to deter said rapist. Putting emphasis on the 'right' thing to say still keeps the onus on the attacked, not the attacker.\n\nA good article that touches on this is: 'Just say no? The use of conversation analysis in developing a feminist perspective on sexual refusal' by Celia Kitzinger and Hannah Frith. Posting the abstract here:\n\nA B S T R A C T. This article aims to show the value of conversation analysis for feminist theory and practice around refusal skills training and date rape prevention. Conversation analysis shows that refusals are complex conversational interactions, incorporating delays, prefaces, palliatives, and accounts. Refusal skills training often ignores and overrides these with its simplistic prescription to ‘just say no’. It should not in fact be necessary for a woman to say ‘no’ in order for her to be understood as refusing sex. We draw on our own data to suggest that young women are able explicitly to articulate a sophisticated awareness of these culturally normative ways of indicating refusal, and we suggest that insistence upon ‘just say no’ may be counterproductive insofar as it implies that other ways of doing refusals (e.g. with silences, compliments, or even weak acceptances) are open to reasonable doubt. Finally we discuss the implications of our use of conversation analysis for feminist psychology, both in relation to date rape and more generally.\n\nThat's not to say that communication ISN'T important - especially deliberate, verbal communication - (and fuck non-verbal communication, non-verbal communication is frequently involuntary) but we frequently turn rape/assault into a misunderstanding issue when it's not.

They almost ALL are talking about women's bodies or choices. Tabloids rip apart women's' bodies. Movies are made for men. The female star is A L W A Y S sexy but there are tons of unattractive male stars and when there is the co star sure is fuck is going to be a sexy woman as well as the female extras. Hell, in Magic Mike, there was no dick but there were bare breasts. A movie about male strippers had no penis but had bare breasts. There are television news stations in other countries that feature half naked women but there is no equivalent for women. Look at how the olympics were filmed, how the women's genitals and breasts and ass were zoomed in on and whatnot. I barely saw anything close to this while watching mens swimming. YES OF COURSE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, but our media is dominated by the male gaze. Legislation is also an issue. How many bills are passed each year that threaten a mans right to bodily autonomy? Im not talking about parental rights or child support, I am talking about our potential future vice president trying to pass a bill that outlaws abortion. There are bills passed that you have to get a rod put inside of you in order to get an abortion, even if you were raped (this is meant to discourage abortion). I had one done and it was VERY thick and invasive, I cant imagine what someone who went through trauma feels. One of our most valuable assets, planned parenthood is under attack constantly. People on reddit are clamoring over themselves to tell women that if they want to be sluts they can go ahead and pay for birth control themselves, yet no one cares that viagra is paid for by insurance with no controversy. Look at religion. It EXPLICITLY states that women should be subservient. The vatican, a bunch of men, are now trying to excommunicate nuns who push for birth control, calling them \"radical feminists\". These are just some thoughts that I have on the issue.

It's enough to be able to get me very close to public orgasm when positioned right, nowhere near as fast as my magic wand of course, but still.\n\nNoise wise, you honestly can't hear it if it's worn under clothing.

He never heard it until we got home and I asked if he wanted to turn it off now or...\n\nThe range varies depending on how strong the (annoyingly unusual size) batteries in the transmitter are, and they run down fast - much faster than the receiver/vibe tbh. 6-10 feet is reasonably consistant, but it'll work up to 30 feet while naked and the wind is blowing the right direction.\n\nIt was only a cheap vibe - about £15 - so it's possible more expensive vibes may have better range or better performance (battery or vibe strength), but it does for what we use it for.

{"body": "&gt; Would C - E - G# ; E - G# - C ; G# - C - E be considered root position ; first inversion ; second inversion?\n\nConsidered by whom?  To whom exactly are you trying to communicate this concept, and does it matter?  This is all a matter of terminology, so you need to decide for yourself whether it's an important distinction to make.  (Hint: in a tonal context, it is.)\n\nWhen we talk about inversions, the only thing that changes is the bass note of the chord.  You can, in theory, invert any chord by placing its various chord members in the bass, but given the gravity of the bass note, you might lose the root feel.  For example, a C6 chord might be spelled C E G A, and it's very clearly a C major chord with an added sixth.  Put the G on the bottom, and it's G A C E, which is ambiguous.  Put the A on the bottom, and A C E G is very clearly an Am7 chord.  A little progression that uses the first and second forms I just mentioned is this:\n\nG A C E (second form), F# A C E, G B D E (first form) (don't mind the similar motion to the fifth, from the F# C to the G D)\n\nYou could analyze that in G major as ii42, viiø7, I(add 6).  Conversely, if you invert a minor 7th chord to first inversion, you'll end up with a major triad with an added 6th.  (Not that this stopped Bach from using ii65 chords as ii's rather than IV's!)\n\nIn *general*, when you invert a chord, you get a *different* chord, since the bass note is so important.  That different chord is just usually similar to the original!  A first inversion major triad is a different chord from a root position major triad, but they're similar enough to be somewhat interchangeable in many contexts.  A second inversion major triad is sufficiently different from the root position chord that it shouldn't be used outside of a few select contexts, since a second inversion triad is unstable due to the fourth with the bass.\n\nTo sum up, if it's useful to you to consider chords as inversions of other chords, do it, but it's not always useful to do so.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345153290", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Paladin is also not a bad choice:  no ranged DPS option, but very survivable, good abilities and cooldowns in almost any spec and you get healing gear for free, being the only plate-healing/casting class there's very little competition.\n\nAs far as tips:  Keybind your abilities and use the key bindings instead of clicking so you can use your mouse to turn and look around.  \"1 2 3 4 5 q e r f g c v\" is a pretty good keybinding that lets your left hand stay WASD-bound most of the time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345156175", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I try really hard to respect whatever belief system people follow, but I'm finding it difficult to stomach this. I can't pass a mosque without briefly scowling in resent. I've come to conclusions that even if there is a god, and allah is as real as he can seem to be to some, I don't want him. I don't. I am okay with burning in a mythical hell. I don't know about any of you but I've never found more Good than in a setting perceived as sinful. What you do isn't wrong, it's who you are. Science doesn't make you any more human than the spark of the divine. We are sentient beings, we are aware of out existence, and are the only animals which make our own existence a problem for themselves. Can you consider that? I'm alive, and it's a problem. I'm living, and it's a crisis. My hormones are wrong, my menstrual blood makes me dirty. I don't love my dog any less when she is in heat. Reproduction is natural, it's a process, and it's universal right down to cells and stars.\n\nThe most fundamental flaw in Islam, I've found,  among many, is the sheer lack of humility. The logic is just beyond flawed. If the sight of anther person, who by nature can bare children, is so arousing- don't look. I'm not a feminist by any means, but I find the men of this religion to be the most revolting. It's not my fault that I was born to be fuckable, to be desired. That's why I'm a woman, speaking in the most primitive means. Without society, my function is to give birth to babies. How dare anyone shun me. If there is a god which made me this way, biological functions and all, then why in the name of holy fuck is it wrong to pray with my uterine lining is shedding and leaking? If I'm the product of this immaculate design, there is no justification for hiding me.\n\nThis whole book was \"revealed\" during such a simple minded and primitive stage of humanity.

{"body": "Here is one tip not many people will give you but helps immensely. Do not get 9/0/21 masteries. Instead, use 0/21/9 getting reduced minion damage, reduced damage, magic resist, cooldown reduction, and movement speed in defense. Get max mana and movement speed in utility (not mana regen). It is way safer than 9/0/21 and you miss out on way less damage than you'd think. It's basically mandatory against mids like cassio and ahri, where you really need the 21 in defense (no, ryze is not a hard counter to ahri!!). Also, smartcast is a must. \nAs for builds, get tear, but get catalyst first if you are having troubles in lane. Then get glacial shroud especially if you're not getting blue buffs, since ryze's damage scales exponentially with cdr. finish roa, get mercs or sorc shoes, and get a negatron if you need the mr. Otherwise, finish archangel's, since the last remake to him, it gives so much damage. I recommend magic pen / health per level / flat mr / movement speed for runes. In teamfights, always try to use your e after your r has been used. A typical 'burst aoe combo' that works well with, say, a friendly malphite, is: q r e q w q (use r before q lands, it will still make it aoe). If you need sustained damage, use your q in between each other ability, but only if you have at least 35% cdr though else it will take too long. Lastly, tell your AP top to finish that wota instead of sticking with the revolver, if they're kennen vlad or rumble.\n\nEdit: oh, one more thing. Only last hit with your auto attacks before you've got tear. You need the mana to trade, since his mana pool early on is very limited.

{"body": "Did you read the article I linked?\n\n&gt; In South Carolina, 940 physicians responding to a survey reported 478 brown recluse spider bites in their state in 1990; in stark contrast, the definitive scientific study on the distribution of all recluse spiders in the U.S. lists only 1 brown recluse from South Carolina. \n\nAlso, [check this article.](http://urban.cmsdev.ucr.edu/docs/Spiders/%20Vetter%20Military%20MRSA.pdf) (sorry for the formatting of the quote, it doesn't like copying from a PDF)\n\n&gt; Recent outbreaks of  mysterious skin lesions on multiple per- \nsonnel at several military facilities were initially  blamed  on \nspiders. Requests were made for pest inspection and control \nto remedy the situation. Greater scrutiny of the situation led to \na hypothesis that instead of spiders, an infectious outbreak of \ncommunity-acquired  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus \naureus (CA-MRSA) should be investigated as the etiology. Sub- \nsequent culturing of  the lesions on personnel at one facility \nconfirmed this bacterial  etiology. Barracks,  as well  as other \nclose quarter military living conditions, are ripe environments \nfor the establishment, persistence,  and spread of CA-MRSA.\n\nAn example that's actually slightly within the recluse range, not far outside like Fort Bragg: \n\n&gt;.  For example, in a medical surveillance report \nfrom Fort B e n n i n g ,   Georgia in 1997 (when MRSA  was rela- \ntively unknown), alleged brown recluse spider bites were blamed \nfor a military outbreak of dermal injuries with minimal evidence \nof spider involvement. At  the basic training facility, \"brown re- \ncluse spider bitesn were reported in 36 of 980 military personnel. \nThe  diagnosis  was  based  on  clinical  presentation  of  lesions \n\"consistent with brown recluse spider envenomation.\" Despite \nno corroborative evidence of  actual recluse spiders, the  au- \nthors  describe  \"attack rates\" for  individual  companies  and \nrefer to this as the \"largest outbreak of brown recluse spider \nenvenomation  in a defined population  over a short period.\" \nFort Benning  is on  the southeasternmost  margin  of  brown \nrecluse spider territ~ry,~  so populations  of  this spider, al- \nthough possibly present, would  be sporadically  distributed. \nInspection  of  the facility  by  entomologists  from  Preventive \nMedicine Services resulted in only one shed spider skin which \nwas reported to be from a brown recluse. Considering what we \nnow know about MRSA and CA-MRSA, bacterial infections by \nStaphylococcus  aureus are far more  likely  explanations for \nthis episode than spider bite.\n\n[From the US military (PDF).](http://www.afhsc.mil/viewMSMR?file=2007/v14_n08.pdf)\n\n&gt; At locations throughout the U.S., concerns about the \nmisdiagnosis of CA-MRSA skin infections as “spider bites” \nhave emerged.^4-9 In most reports of such cases, dermonecrotic \nlesions caused by CA-MRSA have been incorrectly \nattributed to envenomations by Loxosceles reclusa, the brown \nrecluse spider.^4-9  In some cases, brown recluse spiders bites \nwere diagnosed outside the known range or in much higher \nnumbers than could reasonably be attributed to L. reclusa or \nother indigenous fauna.^6-8 In the U.S. military, several investigations of reported \noutbreaks of “spider bites” have found no evidence of \nvenomous spiders in barracks, sleeping bags, equipment, living \nenvironments, or training sites of aﬀ ected units.^9  In at least \none such case, cultures of skin lesions revealed methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA).^10\n\nTrue, none of these deal directly with Fort Bragg, but they establish a long history of recluse over-diagnosis outside its range and a prevalence of MRSA in military living conditions.  In all of that searching, I've found not one confirmed recluse bite from Fort Bragg, and no arachnologist has ever documented a confirmed recluse bite outside of their established range.  I would be open to evidence of bites or even specimens outside of their range if you're willing to provide any, but all scientific data points to misdiagnoses of MRSA and other infections.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345274210", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is actually a fairly interesting maths problem if we assume that when someone comes in while someone else is using a urinal, they're gonna sit as far away from that person as possible. so let's say someone comes in and takes the far left urinal. we have\n\nX O O O O O O O O O O\n\nThen the next person will take the far right urinal:\n\nX O O O O O O O O O X\n\nThen the third person will pee at the middle one:\n\nX O O O O X O O O O X\n\nThen the next person will pee at one of\n\nX O **O O** O X O **O O** O X\n\nthese four urinals. Say they pee at one of the left pair, then the next person will pee at one of the right pair, and vice versa. But then we have a situation something similar to this:\n\nX O X O O X O O X O X\n\nand the next person will have to go next to someone. ewwwww\n\n\nSo we need to find a way of making it so that we fit in as many people as possible without having someone next to someone else. Let's consider the fact that when you take a space, then there is a gap between you and your two nearest people. The bold X's are the two most recent people to arrive\n\nX O **X** O X O **X** O X\n\nThis is ultimately what we are aiming for, a situation where there are gaps between everyone, but each gap is only one. No matter which person you are, there is one urinal between you and both your nearest people. Let's consider the situation before the two recent people arrived:\n\nX O O O X O O O X\n\nwe see two gaps of three here, which is great, cause someone can slot in in the middle without being next to anyone. Now let's look at the situation before the middle person arrived:\n\nX O O O O O O O X\n\nThis time the gap is seven. Now, if we slot in the middle of a gap (if that gap is an odd number of stalls wide), we see that that one gap with n stalls goes to two gaps, each with ( n - 1 ) / 2 stalls, cause you take one of the stalls, then split the remainder in two. In the case of a 7-gap, this is nice because taking away one from 7 will give you 6, and dividing by 6 will give you 3. Applying again to 3 will give you 1, and this is our goal.\n\n\nSo to eventually get a gap of one, we apply the inverse of (( n - 1 ) / 2 ) to one a few times to see what gaps are \"good\". The inverse of (( n - 1 ) / 2 ) is ( 2n + 1 ), so let's apply this to one.\n\n1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 15\n\nYou might have noticed these numbers are the numbers one less than powers of two, and you can prove this fairly easily. Basically the onus is on the first person that comes in to ensure that we get gaps of length 2^n - 1. If they don't take an end stall, then the next person will sit on the furthest end stall to them, and so long as they don't sit next to an end stall, someone will eventually take the other end stall. If the first person does take an end stall, then the next guy will take the other end stall. So we can assume that both end stalls will eventually be taken. Thus, the gaps you leave between you and the end stalls should be of length 2^n - 1.\n\n\nIn the case of 11 stalls, you wanna take the 3rd stall, so that you have\n\nO O X O O O O O O O O\n\nas the first gap is of length one (remember this is the gap that there will be once the end stall is taken) and the second gap of length 7.

A vocoid is a *kind* of vowel, a vowel that can mark a syllable break.\n\nVowels are kinds of sounds, not kinds of letters, although letters can be called vowels when they represent vowel sounds. One letter can represent multiple vowels (such as the o in *go* which represents a diphthong), and one vowel can be represented by multiple letters (as in *feet*)\n\n\nIt is not true that all English words contain a vowel. There is no vowel in *bird*, for example. The i is not pronounced. \n\nAnd if w is a consonant, then it is not true that any vowel-consonant pair of letters can be pronounced.

{"body": "I'm gonna try to articulate one of the things I really hate about LoL as a competitive sport.\n\nIn SC2, you can learn most of what there is to learn about the game through just seeing a couple of videos. Marines shoot, zerglings attack in melee, there is cloak, detection, a few upgrades, and the economy aspect of the game is simple to explain. Most units can be explained very quickly.\n\nHowever, there is immense *emergent complexity* from the bits and pieces. Splits, stacking, building positioning, scouting, cheese, harass, micro and macro techniques, timings. There is an amazing depth of things to be learned about the game that the designers would never have thought of.\n\nIn contrast, in League of Legends you can spend an eternity just learning what all the champions do. I'm at level 28 in the game (my friends can't run SC2) and I still can't tell you, for instance, what Renekton does. This is despite that I played him once for kicks. There's over 100 champions, each with 4 abilities, some of them with several effects, and with many potential roles and builds.\n\nBasically, the complexity in LoL is not from people learning things about the game - it's from Riot putting more complexity into the game. This means that being and thinking player is not enough. You have to just know a fuckton of stuff. There is no depth to this knowledge, or analytical skill behind it. You just have to read and remember.\n\nThere is no depth to this. SC2 has lots of depth because the a pro has to understand why things work the way they work. In LoL, much of the game is just \"X does Y\". In SC2, most of the game is \"X can do X Y Z, which implies A B C D E F\".\n\nThat isn't to say that LoL doesn't have lots of depth too, but I feel like that your skill isn't the deciding factor until you have gotten past this initial hurdle. Also, this probably isn't applicable at all to the pro level. It's simply a game design gripe of mine, and the main reason why I have little faith in LoL as an eSport. People who don't play a lot will have to watch endless amounts of games to properly learn the rules.\n\ntl;dr, I really hate how LoL has tons of complexity that masquerades as strategic depth.\n\nEDIT: Typing this out has made me question a few of the statements I've made, but I'll leave it as it is anyway.

A bII(#4) is a melodic construct similar to the augmented 6th, but one thing it doesn't have is the tritone internal to the V7.  If it were an augmented 6th, in C major it would be Db F (something) B, and that F B tritone would be the same as in the G B D F dominant, but it isn't.  The tritone it *does* have is Db G, and that resolves to C G.  The G is not a color tone like the #11; it's more like a pedal.  That's why it would make more sense to consider Db F G (Bb) an inversion of a Gø7 than a tritone substitution of a G7.\n\nIf the chord (in C major still) were C E F#, then the F# would be a #11, since this is a tonic chord.  It's used in one of the early James Bond themes, actually, and it resolves to the V, which resolves right back.  This is somewhat different from the way the Db F G resolves to C E G; in this case, we have Db G expanding to C G, while in the other case, we have C F# expanding to C G (actually, it doesn't go there, but that's the melodic tendency).\n\nThere are many ways to have a tritone resolve to a consonant interval, and tritone substitution is a means of replacing one such resolution with another.  Db7's tritone, F Cb/B, would normally resolve to Gb Bb, but when it's substituting for G7, it resolves to E C.  Resolving bII to I relies on a completely different mechanism, the tendency of the b2 leading tone to resolve downward to 1.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345613919", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Like \"when I introduced him to another friend of mine (also named Kevin) Kevin thought Kevin was a rug and proceeded to lie down on top of him\" hairy.  Like \"his coarse black-haired chest is so dark no light can escape it\" hairy.\n\nAnywhey we (me and three other guys named Kevin) once attempted to shear his body clean while Kevin was asleep.  After working our way through an entire box of razor blades and a scythe Kevin kept in the bathroom for some reason (he said it was \"to ward off death\"), we had made very little progress in removing the dense, jungle-like growth on Kevin's exceedingly masculine chest.\n\n\"I have an idea\" said Kevin.\n\n\"Wait aren't you asleep?\"  I asked.\n\n\"No that's the other Kevin, Kevin,\" said Kevin.  \"So my idea is to light Kevin on fire.\"  We all looked at each other with grave faces and nodded.  It had to be done.\n\nKevin woke up while we were lighting the wrong Kevin on fire (it was confusing even for us and we were there).  Fortunately Kevin made a bee-line straight for Kevin and managed to pass the fire onto him.  I called the fire department, but they were all extremely busy.\n\nUnfortunately for us, Death soon arrived and came towards us to take Kevin.  \"Hey dude,\" said Kevin, \"I'm not even on fire.  You probably want one of those two.\"  He pointed to the two dying men, writhing in pain on the ground and spreading the fire to my new drapes (don't worry the fire department arrived in time to save the drapes).\n\nDeath, who, as most people know, is a mute, held up a skeletal index finger.  He rifled around in my desk for a while and came up with a pad of paper.  After pricking my finger (he wanted to write in blood because he's such a drama queen), he scrawled out a message with my hand on the paper.\n\nThen Death (after giving me a bandaid for my finger) held up the paper so Kevin could see it.  He immediately dropped dead and Death merrily bagged him up and dragged him down the stairs, letting his head smack down on each and every stair.  Death is kinda a dick.\n\nThe other Kevins stopped being on fire and came over to look at the note with me.  We all gasped in horror.  It read \"P R O S T A T E C A N C E R\".

{"body": "Answering that requires explaining what my plan is for the next release.\n\nSo basically, I've managed to decompose the conduit features (and several other features not in conduit) into composable extensions which I call pipe transformers (or in the more general case, pipe morphisms).  You can see an example of this in [this hpaste](http://hpaste.org/73647) where I implement a parsing just by layering two extensions, one which provides pipe-local state and the other which provides error handling.  These extensions automatically derive a correct category instance, making it much easier for me to prove the laws for each one individually and just layer them to get whatever features I desire without having to reprove the laws from scratch.\n\nBesides making my proofs easier, the other important advantage of this approach is performance, for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason it performs faster is that you only pay for the extensions you actually use.  Using the monad transformer analogy, conduit would be like one giant hard-coded monad transformer stack with every monad transformer baked in.  Pipes will be like monad transformers proper, where you pick and choose which ones to incorporate into your stack.  So, for example, if all you need is parsing, you only pay for parsing.  However, I still plan on duplicating the entire conduit stack and seeing how that compares performance-wise to see if it can be used as a drop-in replacement for conduit-based libraries or not.  Right now I'm still writing up the most demanding extension which is finalization, so I can't say for sure how that will pan out.  I can tell you write now that pipes with the simple extensions still out-perform conduit by a decent margin, however my guess is that once I add finalization that lead will vanish and might even be slower, so I can't really say yet.\n\nThe second optimization opportunity is far more important, though, which is that each extension is defined as a functor from the lower pipe to the higher extended pipe and the functor laws are correct by construction for each extension.  I'll use the same example of a parsing-enriched pipe.  There are four categories at play, which in order of fastest (least features) to slowest (most features) are:\n\n* Haskell functions\n* Kleisli arrows\n* Pipes\n* Parsing-enriched pipes\n\nI can define a functor from each of those categories to the next one:\n\n    (return .) :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; m b)\n    mapMP :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; Pipe m a b r\n    liftP :: Pipe m a b r -&gt; ParseP (Pipe m) a b r\n\nOr you can skip the Kleisli step and jump straight from Haskell functions to Pipes using `pipe`:\n\n    pipe :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Pipe m a b r\n\nThe importance of this is that for any pipe-line, you can use the functor laws to fuse operations in the faster categories together to get optimal performance.  Again, using the monad transformer analogy, this would be exactly analogous to using the monad transformer laws to join steps in the base monad together to avoid binds in the higher monad:\n\n    do x &lt;- lift m1\n        lift $ f x\n\n    =&gt; lift $ do x &lt;- m1\n                 f x\n\nThe user can do this by hand or using rewrite rules (and I plan on writing up all these rewrite rules, but not in the next release).  In some cases, you can even fuse away the entire pipe-line machinery and rewrite it into the hand-written loop.\n\nThe latter trick is where I expect to make the biggest speed gains against conduits.\n\nAnyway, I will do a thorough benchmarking when I'm ready to go on the offensive against conduit, but right now my primary concern is releasing these extensions and merging with `pipes-core` to provide a full standard-library of pipes utilities.\n\nEdit: Oh, and it will all be implemented using ordinary monads now and not indexed monads, so that will be a huge speed win, too.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345852628", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I use a strum pattern which goes UDU D UDU D UDU D (U means up, obviously). You can also do it DUD U DUD U as well, but it's harder on the wrist and other muscles in your arm. \n\nThe advantage of the UDU D UDU technique is that it creates a huge increase in endurance than, say, DUD D DUD D DUD, and more of one than DUD U DUD U DUD. The reason why is because I'm simply using my index finger to push up on the strum bar rhythmically, while my thumb is applying weight to the top of the strum bar. This points all of the energy to the thumb and the finger naturally, without having to use your muscles in your wrist and arm predominately, therefore killing your arm before you even get to the chords section. I'm simply letting the weight of my thumb do all of the work.\n\nAs far as that chord section goes (you know, the [YO] [YO] RRR R [YB] [YB] RRR R RRR R [RB] RRR R [RY] [RY] part), it's too difficult and awkward for me to use the UDU D UDU strategy because not all of the chords are down-strummed, and it fluctuates because of the pattern being used. That throws off my timing. I just go for a simple [D] [D] DUD D [D] [D] DUD D DUD D [D] DUD D [D] [D] strum pattern, just so that my timing doesn't get thrown off.\n\nYou've noticed that the patterns change in the song--the beauty of doing the UDU D UDU D is that the upstrums are ALWAYS on the first and third strums of the triplets (with two exceptions). In the second verse, this translates to UDU D U D UDU D U D UDU D U D etc., and in the fourth verse and post-solo verse it's UDU D U D U D UDU D U D U D UDU D U D UDU D UDU D U D UDU D U D U D UDU D U D U D etc. (for easier reading, the number of single notes in between triplets go 5-5-3-1-3-5-5-3-1-3-5.

{"body": "again I'm probably just talking semantics, but by ear, I think \"musical ear\" which is of course brain.  My hearing has declined, though I try to take good care of them.. nonetheless I can \"hear\" things better than ever, as my brain as developed. \n\nI don't personally use the \"soundstage\" approach when mixing, the instruments don't really exist in a room together, and if you've been in a room with instruments playing together, it doesn't usually sound all that great.  So, I'm going for hyper-real approaches.. I don't use reverb to sound like a real acoustic space usually.\n\nI rely on metering seldom, if at all.  Its nice to check your waveform (especially final mix) for DC offset (waveform existing a lot more on the positive or negative of center) just to make sure you aren't accidentally compromising your headroom.  I've noticed this in other people's mixes and I point it out to them when that is the case. \n\nI developed my ear from just years of experimenting, I guess.  there are a number of facets to it, of course (musical ear, and engineering-ears). I developed perfect pitch by having to tune walls of acoustic guitars when I worked at a music store, E A D G B E just burned into my memory, and I can recall any of those pitches at will.  I learned to play music by ear at a very young age which made learning intervals easy - I practiced interval training which helps me transcribe parts very quickly.  You can practice yourself online with pages such as [this](http://www.musictheory.net/exercises/ear-interval).  I would recommend getting yourself to at least 95% accuracy (not to gloat, but I'll only miss one in a thousand, because it is just second nature now).\n\nEngineering ears takes more time, but for your own music you don't need to be a master of all things technical - you really just have to trust your ears and be sensitive to when things are not right.  my blanket statement would be select the right sounds and don't worry about EQ.\n\nStereo separation is just having a different signal in the left and right channel.  The less they have in common, the more separation you have.  Too much separation makes things sound like they are behind you, or inside your head.  Real sounds don't have incredible separation (mono source, bouncing off a couple walls/floor/shoulders and wrapping around your skull to the other ear).   If you have too much separation you'll also have mono-compatibility problems (an L/R signal out of phase will become silence when summed to mono).  \n\nPersonally I would worry about stereo separation very little.  You're better off with a good mix which is mostly mono.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345913595", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Edit:** See zojbo's comment. 1 and 2 are totally invalid :( However, the explanation after that still stands.\n\nI think you are using collection in a vague way. Let me give you a few theorems that might help with understanding the problem.\n\n1\\. Given a countable set S, the countable product S X S X S X S  X ... is countable.\n\nPf. S is countable so choose a bijection with N and then use the proof that N^N is countable. (You zig-zag through a grid, just like the rationals.)\n\n2\\. Given a countable collection of countable sets A={S_n : n in N}, the countable product S_1 X S_2 X S_3 X ... is countable.\n\nPf. For each n, choose a bijection f_n with the natural numbers. Now use that to run the zig-zag proof.\n\n3\\. Given a countable collection of countable sets A={S_n : n in N}, the union of A (that is the union of the sets S_n) is countable.\n\nPf. Worst case scenario, all elements of all S_n are distinct. Even then we can use the same proof as (2).\n\n\nMy guess is that (3) is what you are asking about.  But lets focus on (1) and (2).  Since S or S_n is countable, there is a bijection. Ok, but that doesn't just give you one. That mean there is at least one but possibly infinitely many. So, in (1) we have to **choose** a bijection for S. But, we only have to do it once, then we can use the same choice for all of the repetitions of S. In (2), for each n, there is a possibly infinite collection of bijections from S_n to N. So, since each of the S_n may be different, we have a possibly infinite number of choices to make each from a possibly infinite set.\n\nNow, when working in ZF, we basically can't get of the ground if we're not allowed to choose once from an infinite set. However the idea of making an infinite number of choices from different infinite sets is much different.

{"body": "*A bit beyond the beginners:* Scales and chord families go together like water and something that goes together with water.  Let's talk about the C scale and chord construction briefly.  Since we are a little beyond the beginning stages here, I'll assume you can play all your major, minor, and seventh chords, or at least can look them up easily.\n\nSo, the notes in the C scale are: C D E F G A B.  No flats or sharps, just the white keys on the piano.  To make a C family triad chord, pick any note, skip a note, pick the next, skip one more, and pick one more (remember, the scale \"wraps around\").  For example, a C major triad has the notes **C** D **E** F **G** A B (selected notes are **bold**).  Creating C family chords in the same way for all the notes in the scale gives:\n\nC, E, G (C major, or C)\n\nD, F, A (D minor, or Dm -- the triad you would get by performing this same procedure for a D minor scale)\n\nE, G, B (Em)\n\nF, A, C (F)\n\nG, B, D (G)\n\nA, C, E (Am)\n\nB, D, F (B diminished, or B^o )\n\nThe second, third, and sixth notes of a major scale will always give you minor chords when you do this, the first, fourth and fifth will give major chords, and the seventh will give a diminished chord.  If we throw one extra note in with B^o , the diminished chord - specifically, the fifth note G - we get the chord G7.  So the full C family should be C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, and B^o which we usually expand to G7.\n\nWhat's the point of knowing any of that?  If you are playing a song in the key of C, you can usually improv some fill by playing notes in the C scale, or you can improv little runs of chords.  For example, if I am playing a two chord folk song with C and G7, I might choose to transition from G7 to C at some point by playing, in quick succession, G7 F Dm C (so you kind of fall out of G7 into F and then into the C from above).  Using a D major chord in your transition sounds a little more dissonant, because the D major chord contains a note, F#, not in the C major scale.  You also want to know this stuff if you are harmonizing a melody line (more on that in future posts).\n\nThese ideas translate to any major scale.  For example, move to the fifth of the C scale, G.  Form the G major scale: G A B C D E F#.  Then start forming the chords for the G major family: G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, D7.  Remember, the diminished F# will be extended to a D7.  Playing in G can be tremendously important if you want to accompany someone playing Irish music; many songs are in the key of G or D.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345998073", "subreddit": "ukulele", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "nm, Accord.\n\nSo last night/morning I was valeting and pulled up a customers  08' Honda Accord. It was a typical busy Saturday night and I had been running non stop for the last 3-4 hours save the brief moment of rest you got pulling up or parking a car. I maneuvered my way through a few groups of pedestrians, slipped my way past two taxis dropping people off, and slowly pulled up the car to the best pick up spot available. \n\nHaving performed this routine thousands of times I will admit that, yeah, at 1:00 A.M. sometimes my brain drifts into autopilot.\n\nI depress the brake with my right foot, quickly shift the automatic transmission from drive to park (feeling the clicks for the three notches N, R, P) shift my weight forward to allow my right leg to come out first then shift back and pull the left up with me to stand. \n\nExcept the car isn't in park, it's actually in reverse. \n\nKeep in mind, I've pulled the car up in a pretty tight space. I have three people waiting for a different car next to me on the left side of the car, a taxi on my immediate right with another one behind it, and what has pulled/walked up behind me in the last three seconds is unknown. \n\nBy the time my left foot hit the pavement I'd realized what was happening. I turned back to the car with my left hand on the open door, shuffled to the right very quickly, pivoted my left foot and spun my right one into the car and down hard on the brake. I don't remember shifting the car back into park. \n\nNice save right? Nah, the young lady decides that since something almost happened it justified her into replying with, \"so now we're even, I don't have any money to tip you.\" \n\nYawnnnnn\n\nAnyways, I began going over what happened in my head and realized where I made my mistake. On the newer Honda Accords the auto trans shifter is in a straight top to bottom alignment of P, R, N, D, D3, 2, 1. Most car's auto shifters will have P R N D in a straight line and and then have the 3, 2, 1 gear notches to the right of D and down again. \n\nWith the Accord the auto shifter doesn't have any sort of different feel between D and D3 and so you shift to D3 without noticing, take off, pull the car up, and click,click,click you're in park right? Butnahhhh, cars in reverse yo. \n\nThis morning for some crazy reason I searched the interweb for talk of different valet stories about shifters and found this.\n\n[story](http://m.jacksonville.com/news/crime/2011-07-31/story/49-million-award-st-augustine-casa-monica-hotel-car-injury)\n\n[pic of car orig](http://www.pajcic.com/2012/06/25/2-1-million-from-valet-company-for-crash-into-hotel-lobby/)\n\nCoincidence? Feel bad for that valet and the guy who was hit. I can see how lucky I was to quickly jump on the brake and not a few inches over on the gas. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346009893", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Any girl with that many sex questions answered gives off a certain vibe. Do I really need to know your biting preference during sex through OKCupid? Not really. Pillow talk? Sure.

Now, I'm first generation (that means my parents were immigrants for those of you in Texas that don't habla inglais) and I believe the melting pot concept is what makes this country great. It's why I joined the Army. But hell, if they can LEGALLY become citizens and pay taxes, why the hell am I paying for other countries' kids to go to the schools here? If you find the American education system so great, then become an American and do your part. My parents and I did.

{"body": "Practicing scales will increase your knowledge of theory, fluidity between the left and right hands, and overall speed. Knowing the scales are very necessary for mastery of any instrument. First off, start with the major scale. Learn that, and practice it with different fingerings and rhythms to increase the mental and muscle memory. (ex, learn the E major scale and different fingerings on the neck) Once you have that down, practice the minor scales. Now in any theory book and theory class you will learn that there are 3 different minor scales. Which is kinda bullshit kinda not. Taking the time to learn all three is the way to go. They are simply just small alterations of the minor scale. I say it is kind of bullshit because composers do not think in terms of \"melodic and harmonic minor\". The different minor scales are simply efficient tools to play in any minor key. So after you have learned the E major scale, learn the e natural minor scale (along with different fingerings). Then the e melodic and harmonic minor scales (with different fingerings).\n\nNow I will give you the notes for the E major, natural, melodic, and harmonic minor scales cause I'm a nice guy (or something of the sort).

According to science, :P, when you finally play the entire C Major scale with the drone and every note sounds good, five times, you are ready to be done with this scale.  You can go for two octaves if you wish but i wouldn't recommend it this early on.  \n\nThis works for any scale.

With her smart cast you can pull off her full level 6 combo in 1-2 seconds and effectively burst an enemy from 100-0 before they have time to react to you.\n\nInstead of \"aiming\" the skill shot, you point your mouse in the correct direction, hit the key, and the skill just fires instantly instead of the normal \"click, aim, click again, shoot\" method. It's all up to your personal preference, but for instance if you are playing a Ryze vs. Ryze match-up and the players are **equal skilled**, the one using smart casting will beat the other Ryze 100% of the time due to his ability to get off combos faster.\n\nAnd you don't HAVE to smart cast all the abilities, either.

As of the issues you mentioned:\n\n- Strumming will almost always feel awkward in the beginning. It's all about getting used to it. \n\n- If you tune to an online tuner, you should not be too far of. However, in order to be as accurate as possible, you might want to get a tuner. In fact, you can actually get a guitar tuner app, if you have a smart phone. The standard guitar tuning is E A D G B e from the thickest to the thinnest string.\n\n- In time, your hands will get used to doing the awkward stretches that come with learning to play the guitar. Even if your hands are actually small you will learn to get by. I mean, there are amazing players with missing fingers for god's sake! ;-)\n\n- Speed is all about starting slow. If you cannot play something up to speed it means you are not ready to do so. Start slow and gradually built up speed. \"Speed is a bi-product of accuracy\" - Some guitar genius.\n\n- This might be because you are fretting (holding down strings) in the wrong places. Even though the space in which you hold the string is correct you won't get the best sound or feel unless you fret the string relatively close to the actual fret (The small metal bar).

{"body": "Experience gets levels. The actual numbers don't matter, just whatever level you are.\n\nYour hero has three basic attributes - strength, agility, intelligence. You start off with a certain amount of each, and gain some every level. Strength gives health, agility gives armor and attack speed, intelligence gives mana. Your primary attribute also gives you damage, and different heroes vary on which is their primary.\n\nSo, for instance, if I'm Chaos Knight, a str hero, I might start off with 28 STR, 23 AGI, 20 INT at level 1. Once I level up, I might gain something like 3 str, 2 agi, and 1 int. This will give me +3 damage, +57 hp from the strength, +2% attack speed from the agi, and +13 mana from the int. Every level, I'll gain that amount. \n\nSkill points are selectable. You've got three ordinary skills, each can be level 1 through 4, and an ultimate, which can be level 1 through 3. Each level, you'll gain a skill point, to allocate wherever you want. You can only learn level 1/2/3/4 of your regular skills at level 1/3/5/7, and you can only learn level 1/2/3 of your ultimate at level 6/11/16. You've also got a stat attribute, which gives +2 to all stats, and can go up to level 10. So, in total, at level 25, the max level, you've got three level 4 regular skills and one level 3 ultimate and a level 10 stat bonus. The order you choose to get there is called your \"skill build\" - if your skills are A, B, C, Ultimate, and Stat, you might level like this:\n\nA B A B A U A B B C U C C C S U S S S S S S S S\n\nSo at level 7, for instance, you've got level 4 of Skill A, level 2 of skill B, and a level 1 Ultimate. How you build it is part of the strategy, because your skills get stronger with each level. If you've got one that is good, but costs a huge amount of mana, you may postpone learning it until later, because you don't have the mana reserves to make good use of it. Different skills scale differently, as well. For instance, there might be a skill that is 2 seconds of stun, 75/150/225/300 damage, 140 mana. That means that no matter what level it is, it costs the same mana and stuns for the same length. So, if your other skills are more useful, it's probably only worth getting level 1 of that skill, to have the stun, since you won't really benefit as much from the damage right away. On the other hand, if you've got a skill that is 1/2/3/4 seconds of stun, that you would want to get to level 4 right away.

{"body": "The problem with this is multifold.\n\nFirstly, if an unregulated corporation were to produce, by accident or design, a product that harmed the health of or killed its customers, those customers would be limited in their reprisal simply due to their physical inability to put up with a lengthy trial.\n\nAnd it would be a lengthy trial, if it even got to that point. You can bet it would - the well-paid lawyers of the big corporation would see to that. Meanwhile, even if the wronged individuals could wait out the trial process, they'd be at a huge disadvantage, since they wouldn't have anywhere near the same funds to put together a legal team to represent them.\n\nOf course, to some extent this happens even with regulations. However, regulations set at least a baseline, a bare minimum, to ensure that the average citizen, who is otherwise limited in his recourse, is less likely to be exposed to this sort of abuse.\n\nWithout regulations, *every* business decision regarding the safety and well-being of the public would come down to Fight Club's A x B x C = X equation, where a company would only enforce product safety if it would be less costly to do than to simply have the lawyers deal with the lawsuits that safety issue causes.\n\nAnd in an age where a presidential candidate can claim to be a CEO of a company and simultaneously have nothing to do with it, I have little doubt that those well-paid lawyers would find all sorts of loopholes to shelter top executives from any nasty punitive laws we enacted.

Especially the table under the heading General Algorithm.\n\nHere's a brief summary.\n\nNote that the bit positions I'm using below are the positions of the bits in the data that's being sent, and not the original message.\n\nThe parity bits are at positions of powers of two:\n\n    p0 p1 x p2 x x x p3 x x x x x x x p4 x x x ...\n\n    2^0 = 1\n    2^1 = 2\n    2^2 = 4\n    2^3 = 8\n    2^4 = 16\n\nThe parity bit at position *n* covers itself and the next *n - 1* bits, skips *n* bits, covers the next *n* and so on. So, parity bit at position 2 covers positions **2**, **3** skips 4, 5, covers **6**, **7** skips 8, 9 covers **10**, **11**.\n\nTo calculate even parity, you take those bits at those positions (for bit 2, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11...) and set it so that there are an even number of 1s (for odd parity, set it so that it's an odd number of ones --- we always use even parity at my university).\n\nFor example, if you want to send a byte of data: 0001 0101\n\n1.) work out the position of the data bits to send (we need to send 12 bits total as that gives us enough parity bits to play with --- I think wikipedia has a method to work out how many bits you need).\n\n    p0 p1 0 p2 0 0 1 p3 0 1 0 1\n\n2.) work out the parity positions:\n\n    p0 = 1,3,5,7,9,11\n    p1 = 2,3,6,7,10,11\n    p2 = 4,5,6,7,12\n    p3 = 8,9,10,11,12\n\n3.) work out the even parity\n\n    p0 = x0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0\n    p1 = x1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0\n    p2 = x2, 0, 0, 1, 1\n    p3 = x3, 0, 1, 0, 1\n\n    x0 =&gt; 1\n    x1 =&gt; 0\n    x2 =&gt; 0\n    x3 =&gt; 0\n\n4.) put the parity back into the data to send:\n\n    1 0 0 0   0 0 1 0   0 1 0 1\n\nTo see if you got the message correctly, just see if the parity you got matches the parity you calculated.\n\nHTH\n\nedit: formatting", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346308138", "subreddit": "AskComputerScience", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Use your fingers if you have to, but start on the root as the first finger (in this case, E) as I, and count up whole steps ... so then F# for II, G# for III, half-step up for IV, so in this case, A, then another whole step for IV, in this case, B.\n\nBlues in A is easy ... A(1), next two fingers are B and C, then D(4) and E(5).  So, blues in A is A for the root, D and E for the fourth and fifth.\n\nA typical blues arrangement is just I for four bars, IV for two bars, I for two bars, V for two bars, IV for two bars, then I for a bar, then any transition on the last bar ... that could be as staid as another bar of I, or a bar of V, or a blues walk.  \n\nA few examples blues walks:  \n\n* in E (up): E(twice), G#(twice), A(twice), Bb(twice), B ...
