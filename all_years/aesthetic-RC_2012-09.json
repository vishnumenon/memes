{"body": "**A Little Technique**\n\nLast time, we heard four example strums from Ukulele Mike (excellent YouTube channel to subscribe to, btw).  This time let's put a little more structure on our strums.  For lack of a better phrase, let's call these *mechanical 4/4 strums*.  All will be in 4/4 time (four beats to a measure, quarter notes get one beat each in standard notation).  All will be built around eighth notes (each eighth note gets half a beat, so we have eight eighth notes in a measure).  We usually count, for eighth notes in 4/4 time, using\n\n1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and\n\nEach word we say is an eighth note.  When we play, we let our strumming hand move up and down *very* mechanically, like a metronome.  Each down stroke is a number, each upstroke an \"and\".  To make a strum pattern, just pick some of the numbers and \"and\"s and play on those and not the others.  (That is, think of it like eight little switches; the on switches are played, and the off switches are not.)  We might write such a strum pattern with d's for down and u's for up, and dashes - for beats that are skipped.  For example, playing everything but the last \"and\" in a 4/4/ measure could be written\n\nd u d u d u d -\n\nIt takes practice to get good at playing these patterns from their diagrams, and to play them smoothly.  But, it is an invaluable skill to learn; if you plan to sing and strum, you need your strumming hand action to be as automatic and mechanical as possible, and if you plan to play rhythm with a group, you need to be able to serve as a tempo keeper.\n\nLet's look at a couple of rhythm patterns.  For each of these, play one rhythm pattern for C, one for F, one for G, and then C again, then start the whole mess over!  C F G C | C F G C | etc.\n\nRhythm Pattern 1: **1** and **2 and 3 and 4 and** == d - d u d u d u.  A simple pattern, but very driving.\n\nRhythm Pattern 2: **1** and 2 **and 3 and 4** and == d - - u d u d - .  Played slowly, sounds very peaceful.\n\nRhythm Pattern 3: **1** and **2 and** 3 **and 4** and == d - d u - u d -.  Al Wood from [Ukulele Hunt](http://ukulelehunt.com/) calls this the Swiss Army pattern.  In fact, if you have not investigated it yet, Al's site [has a great section for beginners](http://ukulelehunt.com/2010/02/24/beginner-ukulele-lessons/).  One link leads to 13 useful strumming patterns.  Looks like you have some work to do!  Also, I highly recommend [Al's book](http://www.amazon.com/Ukulele-Dummies-Alistair-Wood/dp/047097799X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346525541&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ukulele+for+dummies).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346530322", "subreddit": "ukulele", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh God yes. I have a real problem with sushi/maki. If I'm eating multiple rolls, I always need to come up with a sequence to eat them in that's as well-distributed as possible.\n\nOf course, this is easy if all my rolls have the same number of pieces. For example, if I get a Spicy Tuna (S) roll and a Philadelphia (P) roll, and they each have 6 pieces, my order will be:\n\n    P S P S P S P S P S P S\n\nEasy. (and to note: I eat the Philadelphia before the Spicy Tuna because I like Spicy Tuna more and I want it to be the last taste in my mouth).\n\nNow, let's say I order a Spider (I, cuz S and P are taken) roll and a Caterpillar (C) roll. A Spider roll usually has 4 pieces, and a Caterpillar roll usually has 8. So, I'll do this:\n\n    C C S C C S C C S C C S\n\nStill easy.\n\nNow, let's say I pair the Spicy Tuna roll (S, 6 pieces) with the Caterpillar roll (C, 8 pieces). I do this:\n\n    C S C S C S C -- C S C S C S C\n\nThat `--` in there is meaningless; it's just to help your eye break it up better. In short, I'm dividing up my eating experience into two halves, each of which start and end with a Caterpillar roll piece, and then alternate between that and the Spicy Tuna.\n\nTrickier.\n\nEnter the chaos-inducing Spicy Scallop roll (Jesus Christ why does all sushi start with the same letters? This is `A` I guess). At my favorite sushi restaurant, it has *5 pieces*. Fuck.\n\nIf I'm eating it with a Spicy Tuna (S, 6) roll, it's not so bad:\n\n    S A S A S A S A S A S\n\nIf I'm eating it with a Caterpillar (C, 8) roll...\n\n    C A C A C -- C A C -- C A C A C\n\nNow my meal has eating experience has two halves and a short halftime show in the middle. Maybe I'll eat some ginger during that time as well. Fuck that, plain ginger is nasty.\n\nSo yeah, this adds a lot of stress to my sushi-eating experience. But it doesn't end there. What if I'm extra hungry, and get *three* rolls; Spicy Tuna (S, 6), Caterpillar (C, 8), *and* Spicy Scallop (A, 5)? Once I stop hyperventilating, I'll do it like this:\n\n    S C A C S -- C A C S A S C A C -- S C A C S\n\nYeah, I have problems, I know. This brilliant three-course-meal-within-a-one-course-meal means I never eat the same piece twice in a row, and I get the satisfaction of eating a palindrome.\n\nIt can get worse than this. Sometimes, I want to get 4 or 5 rolls and split them with my girlfriend. Sometimes I know I'm with someone who will want to trade a piece, so I have to factor in a group of 1.\n\nI'll spare you these horrors, since I think you get the idea.

Bad intro to Linux!!!!!!!\n\nAnyway, the way you want to go is to:\n1-Start windows  \n2-Download the wubi to your desktop (if that is what you want, and not duel booting)  http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\n3-Double-click the wubi icon and follow the prompts.  \n4-When asked to restart, do so, at which time you will choose which OS to run.  \n \nOne caution I have is that restarting a non-responding Linux computer the wrong way will mess up your system.  It is a little complicated, so make a sticky note (and stick it on your computer) until you learn it by heart.  Holding down the ALT key along with the PrintScrn/SysRq key and hitting one key at a time, allowing about 10 seconds between them, r e i s u b, will restart the computer safely. (reference: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-use-magic-system-request-keys-in-ubuntu-linux.html)  \n\nThat warning was because when restarting and choosing Ubuntu, you could still have some problems (needing more drivers).  These are easily solved.\n\nIf you have a graphics card problem, (black screen), restart (as explained above because you will not have a restart button to use) in Ubuntu safe mode (I think it might be worded 'recovery mode, or single user mode' and choose Safe Graphics mode from recovery menu. Then you will see your desktop in low resolution. Install graphics drivers (there is a menu item for installing drivers you might need) and restart the computer.  \n\nIf after following all this and it is not working for you, we will need your machine info to help with any special issues you have.  By the way, be careful what logs you post, they contain a lot of information.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346611381", "subreddit": "linux4noobs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I cannot imagine why you would want to set this up as a raid array.  \n\nAll you need to have are the two main partitions (one for windows and one for ubuntu), with grub installed into the master boot record (grub reads file systems, not partitions).\n\nThe master boot record always (must) resides on the first sector of the hard drive (no matter how you set up the hard drive)  (unless you have a gpt scheme) but because you don't mention the hardware, I am guessing that with only a 1tb hard drive this is the case.\n\nJust make it a dual boot system.\n\nJust change (in bios) from raid to ahci, and try again.  \n\nThe reason grub install is failing is because it cannot install to the master boot record (as it is on the windows partition of the raid array which you are telling it not to touch). \n\nThere is a way to do almost anything you want, but unless you are running a server, why do you want to get that complicated and boxed into something you don't need.\n\nSo the fix is :\n\n1-go into bios and change from raid to ahci\n2-reinstall windows (if it got wiped out, because windows insists on being first).******edit\n3-install ubuntu again, choosing to install along side windows. It will do all the partitioning automatically for you after you select the partition to use (use the ubuntu partition if it is there****edit  it will be gone if you had to reinstall windows so during install you will be given the chance to make a partition for ubuntu, select 500 gb at END of the partition) and selecting automatic install.  It will then install grub (at the end of the install) in the master boot record sucessfully.\n\nWhen you reboot, you will have the choice of which operating system to run.  You may need special driver files for ubuntu, but it has a menu tool to help you.  \n\nIf ubuntu gets stuck loading (after install), hold down the ALT key and the PrintScrn/SysRq key while pressing each of these keys in sequence r e i s u b.  This will reboot the computer, select ubuntu, select the second option with an arrow down (which is single user or recovery mode) then when that comes up select Safe Graphics mode to get you to the desktop and use the menu to install any graphics drivers you might need.\n\nGood Luck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346616425", "subreddit": "Ubuntu", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This is like deciding between two identical flavors of kool-aid based on their color. There is no difference between a white person and a black person besides their skin color. I grew up with a black kid raised by a super-white suburbanite family for a friend. He acted \"whiter\" than I did. Black people and white people are people with cosmetic differences. P E O P L E. Not two different \"brands\" of people. There is no difference except what is imparted by different cultural groups, and that is usually because of the kind of racism you're talking about than anything. It's been scientifically proven that black people are not different from white people. They have the same IQ scale, when corrected for privilege, they have the same hopes, dreams, likes, dislikes, loves, hates. What makes them different from you to the point where you don't like them?

When you say \"black people\" and \"white people\" you're really talking about two massive, hugely diverse groups that share not a single characteristic among the group that the other group does not have somewhere within it except for the sole factor of skin color.

{"body": "Yes.  And no.  There are standard chord symbols you can look up, and they're usually pretty simple.  For example, C E G B D F# is Cmaj7#11, G B D F A C Eb is G7b13.  This is the \"yes\" part.  The \"no\" part is that when you see these chord symbols, you'll never actually play them this way.  For example, my favorite way to play a G7b13 is G F B Eb, which leaves out the D, the A, and the C.  This might resolve to a Cm9, which I'll play C G Bb D, leaving out the Eb.  And there are no formulas for how to play these chords such that they sound *good*.  You'll need to rely on your ears and your experience to figure that out.\n\nIf you see a 7, 9, 11, or 13 next to a note name, that's a dominant chord.  The notes are 1, 3, 5, b7, 9, 11, 13, stopping at the appropriate note for the chord (don't go up to 11 on a dominant 9th chord).  YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT PLAY A GOOD CHUNK OF THESE NOTES.  You'll never want to actually voice the chord this way, probably.\n\nIf you see an m, that's minor.  The notes are 1, b3, 5, b7, 9, 11, 13.  Same thing.  If you see an M or a maj, that's major; the notes are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13.  By the way, I'm not sure on the 13 for an m13 chord.  I never see them.  What will often happen is that you'll get an alteration to the chord.  If you see something like G7b9, you play a G7 -- G B D F -- and add a b9 to it -- Ab.  Again, you don't need to play all the notes.  It's generally implied that if you have a 13, you can play the 9 and 11 as well, so a G7b13 would include A and C as well.  Same with the 9th on a #11 chord, for instance.  Common alterations are b9, #11, b13, b5, #5, #9.  If you see /6, that means add the 6th, so G7/6 is a G7 with an E.  I'd say that's exactly the same as a G13.\n\nIf you see a 6, that's a major chord with an added 6th, so 1 3 5 6.  m6 is a minor chord with an added *major* 6th, so 1 b3 5 6.  You'll often see 6/9, which is a 6th chord with an added 9th.\n\nIf you see a 5, that's usually a chord with no third -- just 1 5.  C5 is C G.  If you see a 3, same thing but no 5th -- 1 3.  C3 is C E.\n\nIf you see a 2 or 4, change the 3rd to that note.  A 4 chord is 1 4 5 and a 2 chord is 1 2 5.  These are usually written sus4 or sus2, but not necessarily.  G4/7 is a dominant 7th where the 3rd is a 4th, so G *C* D F.  You'll usually see that, again, as G7sus4.\n\nA few other chords: a diminished chord, usually dim or o, is 1 b3 b5, and a diminished 7th chord, usually dim7 or o7, is 1 b3 b5 bb7 = 1 b3 b5 6.  Cdim7, for instance, is C Eb Gb A.  The *half-diminished* 7th chord is written ø and is 1 b3 b5 b7, so Cø7 is C Eb Gb Bb.  This is often written as Cm7b5, since it's like a Cm7 except with a b5.  Logical, huh?  Augmented chords are 1 3 #5; they're usually written aug or +.  The augmented 7th chord is usually a *dominant* 7th with a #5, so you'll see G7#5 or G7+ meaning G B D# F.  Be careful, though, because some people use the + to mean major, and it can get confusing.\n\nFinally, the m/M7 chord is weird, but it's 1 b3 5 7.  Cm/M7 is C Eb G B.  It sounds strange.  It's a minor/major 7th, since it's a minor triad with a major 7th.  It's pretty rare.\n\nThese are the ones I know!  You can describe pretty much any chord this way, though possibly not very well!\n\nOh, I forgot slash chords!  If you see a slash and a note, that means play the chord with that note in the bass.  For example, D/E means play a D major chord with an E in the bass.  These are used often for inversions -- D/F# is a first inversion D major chord -- but also for some interesting sonorities.  The best voicing for a slash chord where it's a triad over a note a whole step higher (according to a book I read) is to put the triad in second inversion; F/G, for example, would be G C F A.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346790463", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

Margins in nonluxury retail can be razor thin, and there's not much room for innovation in the concept:  it's a box that contains goods that people come in, pick out, and buy.  So they have to compete on convenience, like travel time for customers.

It justifies the double-length sixth row, since there are two sixes in \"3967152486\".\n\nThis lines up with the initial decryption steps of the [ADFGVX cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher) (but in our case, we'd use an ADFGX cipher—or, technically, an ABCDE cipher).  I performed the first couple of steps (write the rows as columns; rearrange the columns from EIMORSSTUY to MYSTERIOUS (ie. 1234566789 to 3967152486)), which yields\n\n    BCAAAACADC\n    AEACACBABB\n    CAAACEACBA\n    AEACAAADBD\n    AABEAABCAC\n    BADAACACEA\n    AEADAACBAC\n    EBABABBCEC\n    BACABCBEAC\n    BAEAAECABD\n\nFrom here, if it were a standard ADFGX cipher, each pair of letters would correspond to another letter.  The fact that only A-E are used gives further evidence that this is the correct method (there are 25 possible pairs of letters; I/J are typically the same in these ciphers).\n\nThe problem is that we don't know the mapping from pairs of A-E letters to the actual alphabet.  It's likely that there's another major step involved.  I replaced each pair of A-E letters with one normal letter, converting it into a typical cryptogram.  I used this grid:\n\n      A B C D E\n    A A B C D E\n    B F G H I J\n    C K L M N O\n    D P Q R S T\n    E U V W X Y\n\nUsing that grid (eg. BC -&gt; H), we get\n\n    HAAKRECCFGKAOCFECADIAJAHCFPCCUEDALCVBBHWFKHJCFUEKI\n\nI used [this cryptogram solver](http://www.blisstonia.com/software/WebDecrypto/index.php) to try to solve it, but it didn't yield anything intelligible.\n\nI also tried transposing the letter matrix (ie. reading the letters top-to-bottom instead of left-to-right):\n\n    FKBEGOEAVAAAIAOCCUQAAKAAFCUCBOLAFLHANMHUQGEEBLDKMN\n\nThis doesn't yield anything either, so it's not a straight-up ADFGX cipher, but it's quite possible that it's a step away.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347065196", "subreddit": "puzzles", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Maybe I can help with some of them, I'm slightly new to this but, some of this is under my understanding.\n\n1. An octave bears no relation to the number 8 - I don't know how to explain this but, the best I can do is that, there are 7 natural notes, not 8. In the key of C this would be C D E F G A B. Going an Octave up this starts again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Thus an octave is just the same scale.\n\n2. The 12 notes - 7 were given the note name C D E F G A B the other 5 were given C#(Db) D#(Eb) F#(Gb) G#(Ab) A#(Bb). Why, I have no idea probably cause they seem to transition well.\n\n3. Note sounding same - Yes, notes sound the same! If you play a C and a C an octave up they will produce the exact same tone, you think they sound the same because the pitch has increased producing a brighter sounding note. \n\nNow I have never looked into a music theory book, solely used the internet, and I'm only 15 years old and love learning about music theory.

{"body": "Yes, and the big focus of the next release is the use of functors to promote compatibility between code written to varying feature specs.\n\nI'm going to write a lot more about it in an upcoming post, but the basic idea is that I formulate all pipe extensions as functors from a one pipe type to another.  This means that code written to a simpler feature set can be automatically be promoted to be compatible with code written to a more complex feature set.  The advantage of this is that you don't have to standardize on a particular monolithic type and you can write code targeted to just the features you need and rest assured that it's future-proof.\n\nUsing the specific example you mentioned, you can write a function `liftPipe` with the type:\n\n    -- The old Pipe type in Control.Pipe, not the Proxy type synonym\n    liftPipe :: Pipe a b m r -&gt; Proxy () a () b m r\n\n... and you can prove that this function satisfies the following laws:\n\n    liftPipe idP = idT\n    liftPipe (p1 &lt;+&lt; p2) = liftPipe p1 &lt;-&lt; liftPipe p2\n\n... i.e. the functor laws.\n\nThe main contributions of the next release are going to be:\n\n* A standard interface for pipe morphisms and pipe transformers (i.e. functors between pipe types)\n\n* A suite of extensions that use this interface, most notably ones that extend pipes with error handling and parsing\n\n* (If time permits): Tools for optimizing away the overhead of these transformations at compile time\n\nNow, the really interesting thing is that this interface is not limited to the pipe type.  Any other iteratee library can conceivably implement it and then automatically take advantage of the extensions I write.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347068019", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They're different, not because I say so but because they represent different frequencies, which excite different resonating receptors inside your ear.\n\n&gt; but you are refusing to acknowledge that C D E F G A B C is 8 notes. \n\nFalse. This is a strawman -- I have never made that claim.  CDEFGABC is indeed 8 notes, but it's including seven notes from one octave, and one note from another. List the octave starting at middle C, and you get C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, and B4. If you say that C5 belongs to that octave, **then it can't belong to the next one**. You would have to say that the next octave starts at D5, and presumably ends at D6. I suppose you could do this, but you would violate the universal rule about octaves (in all musical systems, not just Western) that they are organized on periods of doubling frequencies. \n\nPut another way, saying that an octave contains 2 \"C\" notes implies, again by definition, that 4 consecutive octaves contain 8 \"C\" notes. This we know not to be the case. If that didn't sink in right away, dwell on it for a moment. I think this, in a nutshell, conveys the mathematical error that an 8-note octave implies.\n\n&gt; What you are saying is that by your reasoning an octave is somehow C - B, which is simply not true in a sense of music theory. \n\nI'm sorry, you're just mistaken. I've discussed this with musicians and music theory instructors; it's not even what I'm here to debate and I'm quite honestly shocked that people have picked out this issue to argue about. My frustration is that knowledgeable people understand the octave is based on 6 steps, 12 half-steps, and 7 named notes, but so far no one has been able to help me understand why. The number 13 is also not relevant to Western music; it is also an error in reasoning.\n\n&gt; Not to mention you are contradicting yourself.\n\nAs I explained above, the only contradiction has been with your own strawman argument.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347129379", "subreddit": "Learnmusic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**A Little Theory**\n\nWe are going to get into the blues this week, and to do that we need to learn a chord form and a song form.\n\nFirst, the chord form.  7th chords are very typical in blues pieces (especially on the uke).  7th chords sound *great* on the ukulele.\n\nLook back to how we formed the C (major triad) chord.  We wrote down the notes in the C major scale and numbered them:\n\nC D E F G A B C D E  F  ...\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...\n\nWhen we formed the C major chord triad, we started with C, then skipped a note, picked the next, skipped a note and picked the next, giving us the 1, 3, and 5 notes in the scale, or C, E, and G.  To form other triads in the C family, we followed the same pattern.  For example, we formed a triad from D by choosing the 2, 4, and 6 notes.  This gave us Dm.  If we want to form a D major chord, we write down the D major scale\n\nD E F# G A B C# D E F# G  ...\n\n1 2 3  4 5 6 7  8 9 10 11 ...\n\nChoosing the 1, 3, and 5 notes D, F#, and A gives us our D major chord.  The same pattern holds for the construction of all major chord triads.  You *do* need to figure out what the major scale is for the 1 note you want to build.  [Major scales have a basic pattern which is useful to know](http://www.zentao.com/guitar/theory/major-scale.html)(ignore the guitar part down at the bottom if you like).\n\nOkay, what happens if we extend the pattern and play the 1, 3, 5, and 7 notes of the major scale?  For the C major scale, we would have C, E, G, and B.  If you want to play this chord on your uke to see how it sounds, you can play (gCEA) = (0 0 0 2) (that is, just fret the second position on the A string, almost like playing a C chord, just one fret lower).  Try it... it doesn't sound exactly... chord-ish.  The problem is that the B and C notes together in the same chord cause a lot of dissonance; they are just too close together.  The chord we just constructed is called \"C major 7\", and often written Cmaj7.\n\nA somewhat more harmonic sounding chord can be formed from the Cmaj7 by flatting the 7th note.  For the C major scale, we would then have C, E, G, and Bb (Bb replacing the B).  To play this on your ukulele play (gCEA) = (0 0 0 1).  To me, it sounds more harmonic, and just a little twangy or jangly.  We write this chord C7.  When I speak of \"a 7th chord\", I will always mean the chord constructed in this way, with the flatted 7th note replacing the 7 note.  *Side note for the anal-retentive among you: using the flatted 7th note sounds good, but it is not a note in the C scale.  This is true for all 7th chords; they are all constructed with a note outside of the major scale.  The flatted 7th note is in the natural minor scale, though.  So the C7 chord is sort of a major/minor blend.  [Here is another way to think about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/zfadm/difference_between_a_7th_chord_and_a_major_7th/) for the music theory inclined.*\n\nYou can find the chord diagrams for 7th chords in [nearly any uke chord chart](http://www.alligatorboogaloo.com/uke/chords/).\n\nOkay, now for the blues.  A \"bar\" or \"measure\" is a specified number of beats in the song, with an emphasis placed on certain beats.  We will be working with 4 beat measures (4/4 time in particular).  A strum pattern is any strum pattern that just takes up the 4 beats.  For example, \n\nd - d u d - d -\n\nworks great (the downstrums are the 4 beats and any ups are the \"and\"s).  In the chord diagrams I am about to write, any time you see a chord written, that means \"play one strum pattern with this chord\".\n\nThe most basic blues form to learn is the [12 bar blues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues).  The 12 bar pattern in C is\n\nC  F  C  C\n\nF  F  C  C\n\nG7 F  C  ?\n\nIn the question mark slot, we use a C chord (or a finishing pattern) when we are finishing the song, and we use a G7 (or a turnaround pattern) when we are going into another verse.  Try playing the 12 bar blues in C right now.  Even with simple downstrums, this sounds like a song!  Blues forms are some of the most pervasive in modern music; even if you are not a blues fan, you've almost certainly heard something influenced by the blues.\n\nIf we name the notes in the C scale with roman numerals - [a common practice](http://musictheoryblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/roman-numeral-chord-notation.html) - then C == I, F == IV, and G7 == V7.  The pattern for the 12 bar blues is then, *in abstracto*, \n\nI  IV I  I\n\nIV IV I  I\n\nV7 IV I  ?\n\nSometimes we play IV7 instead of IV (depends on how it sounds).  It is up to us to know the I - IV - V7 groups.  Here are the most common:\n\nI  IV V7\n\nC  F  G7\n\nD  G  A7\n\nE  A  B7  (less common for uke blues, but guitarists often play the blues in E)\n\nG  C  D7\n\nA  D  E7  (a personal favorite of mine for the uke)\n\nIt's worth playing through the 12 bar form for each of these chord groups; it's good practice in switching chords!  If you want to sing over your strums, one easy pattern is to sing a line over measures 1 and 2, repeat the line over measures 5 and 6, and then sing a resolving line over measures 9 and 10.\n\n*I been lookin' for my baby, I gotta just have me one more drink*\n\n*I been lookin' for my baby, I gotta just have me one more drink*\n\n*Cause my baby done gone and left me, and I'm juiced up and right at the brink*\n\n(you'll have to play at a slower tempo with long lyric lines like these)\n\nStudying the blues is worth your time, but you will soon discover that there are lots of details.  Introductions, turnarounds, vamps... all sorts of bits and pieces to learn.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347171023", "subreddit": "ukulele", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "**A Little Technique**\n\nIt is very helpful in many styles to play scales over chords.  This can help you play harmony and melody parts at the same time.  At the very least, it can help you create more interesting chords and progressions.  A good understanding of scales and chords together is important in playing blues shuffle patterns.\n\nIt turns out that the ukulele is almost custom built for one particular scale/chord pairing: the C major scale played over the C major chord.\n\nFirst, identify the frets on the A string corresponding to notes in the C major scale, and make sure you know which note of the scale each fret plays.  Here is a list:\n\nFret on A    = 0 2 3 5 7 8 10 12\n\nNote         = A B C D E F G  A\n\nScale number = 6 7 1 2 3 4 5  6\n\nSo, try playing scale notes 1 2 3 2 1 7 1.  That is, you play the frets 3 5 7 5 3 2 3 on the A string (just pluck the string).  Now try to do the same thing by strumming all the strings (you are still fretting only notes on the A string, the G, C, and E strings are open).  Doesn't sound half bad, does it?  What's going on?  Well, the open G, C, and E string make a C major triad chord, and the C major scale notes sound \"right\" when played with that.\n\nSo why is this in the technique section?  In the blues, one common pattern is the shuffle.  It is played with a swing rhythm strum, and uses a scale played over the chord.  Playing the scale over the chord takes dexterity in some cases (your fingers will be playing a game of twister on the fretboard).  Here are four common examples.  In each, the note that is changing is the 5 note of the scale.  We play 5th, 6th, 7th flatted, 6th.  So these shuffles are sometimes called 5-6-7 shuffles.\n\nThe C shuffle, in tab (chord vertically, chord, chord, chord read left to right):\n\n3  3  3  3\n\n0  0  0  0\n\n0  0  0  0\n\n0  2  3  2\n\ndu du du du  (play in swing rhythm, down up, down up,...)\n\nThe F shuffle:\n\n0  0  0  0\n\n1  1  1  1\n\n0  2  3  2\n\n2  2  2  2\n\ndu du du du\n\nThe A shuffle:\n\n0  0  0  0\n\n0  2  3  2\n\n1  1  1  1\n\n2  2  2  2\n\ndu du du du\n\nThe D shuffle: (I usually play this as a D7 shuffle so that is what I am writing here)\n\n0  2  3  2\n\n2  2  2  2\n\n0  0  0  0\n\n2  2  2  2\n\ndu du du du\n\nSo now try playing a 12 bar blues in C, playing the 5-6-7 shuffle for C and F wherever it feels right.  Then, play a 12 bar blues in A, using D7 instead of D and playing the 5-6-7 shuffle for A and D7 wherever it sounds good.  Practice for a while until you can play the shuffles smoothly, and without losing good tone.\n\nHaving a good knowledge of different voicings of chords and playing scales over chords is a good start on jazz stylings.

His main character, Ephoenix, can sometimes (very very rarely) still be seen online on the Norgannon server when his father logs on. \n\nCaylee Dak and her pet Dusky in Shattrath City (on Aldor Rise and belonging to the Darnassus faction) was the character of Dak Krause, who passed away from leukemia on August 22, 2007. She ends the quest Alicia's Poem. \n\nKoiter is a slightly more complicated memorial. While NPC Koiter uses the Spirit Healer model, behind him is a memorial in a small subzone called the Shrine of the Fallen Warrior in the northern Barrens. Atop the structure is an orc that is a copy of Michel Koiter's character from the WoW beta. He died in 2004 of unknown causes.\n\nCaptain Armando O s s e x is a member of the Stormpike Guard in Alterac Mountains. He is apparently a memorial to a deceased player who loved playing AV, but information other than this is scarce. I was unable to find a date of death or whether the patrolling character was a clone of his or not.\n\nCrusader Bridenbrad the Argent Crusader dying of the plague in Icecrown appears to be based off of a real person, Bradford C. Bridenbecker, who died of cancer in 2007. He is involved in a medium-long questline starting with A Tale of Valor, given to you by Tirion Fordring after you've unlocked the Crusaders' Pinnacle. It is speculated that he may be related to a Blizzard programmer.\n\nAgain in Hillsbrad is a Decorated Headstone dedicated to Jesse Morales, a Blizzard employee who passed away while WoW was still under development.

{"body": "This is actually incorrect.\n\nTake for example the Moonlight Greatsword. It has S scaling, so by your statements we should expect that scaling from 40-50 would still be fairly decent.\n\nAt [40 Int](http://tinyurl.com/8q3pwha) the Moonlight Greatsword has 472 AR. At [50 Int](http://tinyurl.com/99butna) the Moonlight Greatsword has 480 Int, an increase of only 8 AR for 10 stat points.\n\nAlso, if there are different diminishing return breakpoints for different scaling ratings then we should be able to test this as well.\n\nLets take the Shotel and the Falchion as example weapons. At +15, both weapons have the same base AR of 220 (and maintain the same AR at any upgrade level as shown [Here](http://darksoulswiki.wikispaces.com/Curved+Swords)) however the Falchion goes up to A scaling in DEX while the Scimitar only goes up to B scaling in DEX when they are upgraded to +15.\n\nNow, if the above post is true, and Scaling Rank didn't affect bonus damage only diminishing return points, then at 30 Dex both weapons should be equal. At 30 Dex the Shotel has 325 AR where as the Falchion has 344 AR as shown [here](http://tinyurl.com/9lmcofz) Because we know the base AR of both weapons, we can determine exactly how much AR is granted from its scaling. The Shotel's B scaling grants it 105 additional AR at 30 Dex where as the Falchion's A scaling grants it 124 additional AR at 30 Dex.\n\n---\n\nThe way the mechanic actually works is that a higher scaling rating gives more AR per stat point spent, up until the universal break-point for weapons which is at 40.\n\nAlso, scaling ratings are ranges, meaning - for instance - that not every A scaling weapon has the same gains per stat point. The ranges are as follows in order from greatest gains per point to lowest gains per point: S A B C D E\n\nAgain, the Moonlight Greatsword is a good example of this. If you look at the AR gains based on its scaling modifer at a specific Int value, that number will increase as you upgrade the weapon even though ranks 1 through 5 all have an S for Int scaling. I unfortunately don't have quick access to this weapon so I can't quite show you what I mean by this, but maybe I will do a video some other time if you don't quite understand the concept.\n\nWhat you can take away from this though is that investing stat points into a weapon with a high scaling modifier will yield large gains to it's AR value. What this also means is that weapons with low scaling modifiers will not gain much benefit from stat increases, and may change how you optimize your character.\n\nFor instance, if I wanted to use a +15 Uchigatana, I would be inclined to bring my Dex up to the scaling breakpoint to make the best use of my weapon as it has an A in Dex scaling. However, if I were to look at a weapon like the Gravelord Sword, which has E scaling in both STR and DEX, then I would be significantly less inclined to raise my stats much higher than the minimum requirements as the gains may not be worth it if I were to use this weapon.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347341055", "subreddit": "darksouls", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;  for example dragons, we can imagine them but we have never experienced them.\n\nBut we imagine experiencing them. We imagine them existing, and observing, seeing and hearing them.\n\nCan you imagine being unconscious? No. You can only imagine what it looks like for someone else to be unconscious, or what you'd look like from the viewpoint of someone else.\n\n&gt; You do not need to have a third party to understand a metaphysical thought experiment. \n\nTrue, but in this case you wouldn't know what it'd be like to lack experiencing anything, and that is what needs to be understood in this thought experiment.\n\n&gt; I am saying time would not stop in these freezes. \n\nIf time is an existing thing, like a real physical fourth dimension, then time either exists or it doesn't. \"Stop\" infers to cease motion. So, I agree also, that in that version of time, stop/start doesn't really have a meaning to time, but rather the subjective experiences within time.\n\nLets say you have A B C D E F G, and A through G are like frames of a movie. C through E can be identical. Yet imagining this flashlight like in the video you linked, it still has to move from C to E, and though the contents of C, D and E are identical, they are different existing things, or in different locations you could say. Like having a copy of the same file on a hard drive.\n\n&gt; I can imagine a duration-less moment in time. \n\nThat's what I was originally going to say, but changed it to \"least duration possible\" just in case it wouldn't have made sense.\n\n&gt; I would disagree, future time travel is quite possible, if not needed for our universe to work. Backwards time travel imo is not. \n\nI would have thought that sort of time travel would require an eternalist view of time, especially a real, existing fourth dimension, and the future to be equally as real as the present.\n\nAs for the time travel I was talking about, I'll use an extremely bad analogy (and I'll poke holes in it in a moment).\n\nImagine something like a ruler that is 1 light-second in length, and another person standing at the end of it with a stopwatch. When a photon travels from one end to the other, a clock on the ruler measures 1 second.\n\nHold this ruler out, so it is pointing forwards. Start this ruler-clock and the stopwatch at the other end simultaneously (however you'd do that). Then travel forwards (person with stopwatch stays still) at 150,000km/s (half light-speed), for a distance of 1 light-second, and stop.\n\nAt this point, the end of the ruler naturally will be at the 2 light-second distance because of its length, but let's just say that it records the time on the clock, and sends that information back to your end.\n\nTheoretically, though you've traveled for 2 seconds to reach that distance, the ruler-clock will have only registered 1 second, and the stopwatch 2 seconds. This is because light cannot travel faster than light, and the photon took twice as long to reach the end as it would if you were standing still.\n\nAlso, light is always traveling at its maximum speed, so you can't push on light and make it go faster. So, any speed should do, and you can do the math to see what differences there would be between the two clocks.\n\nAnything that operates with things moving at near light speeds (is that everything on a micro scale?), like electricity, will *slow down* when you speed up (taking longer to get from point A to point B), making it appear from the viewpoint of that thing, like everything else is speeding up in relation to it. Think of zero-gravity simulations.\n\nBut, of course, there's a big flaw in this analogy. Light and electricity can travel in all directions, including the reverse of the direction you're moving. So, that screws up my analogy somewhat. But still, there'd be some effect. Also, I'm sure the analogy fails when it comes to other things.\n\nI don't know if this has any relation to the theory of relativity, but I can see why any clock tests where one stays motionless in relation to another, will exhibit some effect like this, and other physical properties of the universe could exhibit the same behaviour. I do need to read up on time dilation. I don't really know much about the process, except for what the results would look like, and however sci-fi shows like to show it (no doubt very inaccurate).\n\n&gt; I am going to attempt to help you with this. I may fail but I tried! '#2 one event merges into another' So basically they remain seperate events but happen at the same time, one then discontinues and the other continues. There remains a permanent partial overlap, this is why it is not change.\n\nOK. I think I understand.\n\nCouldn't the same arguments in that video be used to conclude that motion is unreal? The video is all about *change*, and what he seems to be inferring, is actual motion.\n\n&gt; As for\n\n(big fat unprovable hypothesis)\n\n&gt; That is just hardcore skepticism.\n\nI know I know, and I don't believe a word of it :)\n\n&gt; I really enjoyed what you wrote btw it is helping a lot.\n\nReally? To be honest, time is something I've barely looked into. I've just thought about it in the past, coming to my own conclusions, but never actually did any study into the various theories.\n\nBy the way, your post could do with a bit of editing. Some of your response has been included as part of my quote by accident (i.e *'That is just hardcore skepticism'*). That paragraph of green-text requires scrolling left and right too, but I'm just nitpicking there. Don't bother responding to this paragraph. I'll delete this paragraph if I notice you've fixed it.\n\nEdit (Sep '14): Now that I understand time dilation a lot better, it probably best to ignore this post.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347526385", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Towards the end of 2007, I was chilling in my car listening to Kiss100 FM radio, listening to Carl Cox's show. \n\nCarl Cox then says here's a new track by Deadmau-five (he pronounced the 5) called arguru, and when he played arguru, i was going nuts. I had never heard anything like it before. \n\nDeadmau5 is about what's not there as much as it is about what is there. I'm sure real fans understand when I say I felt an affinity with Arguru instantly, and i spent the next 24 hours googling deadmaufive only to realise its deadmau5. To appreciate deadmau5 fully, you need to have a certain attitude/mentality, it's not for everyone, even househeads. Joel conjures his twisted awareness, pain and confusion, happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety and creates tracks around them. You have to bring your baggage to listen to deadmau5, its not objective music. I know you can say that about a good proportion of house music/EDM, but it really rings true in this case. \n\nAlso, Joel is an audiophile, and if you like his style of music, you will love him for being so anal about his music and the quality. I doubt there is 1 second of music he has released which he is not proud of or happy with. \n\nAfter Arguru, I found this torrent file on Mininova, and BOY, my life changed at that point. The torrent file had EVERYTHING he had released up until that point. It was a constant eargasm. I would say that the torrent file made me the fan I am. I have booked pretty much every show in the UK since then. And I have bought shitloads of digital tracks, physical albums, merchandise and got a few friends seriously into him. So yeh whoever said pirating music is detrimental to the artist is stupid, but thats another argument. \n\nAs for his personality, which he has decided to show us so much of, I can only applaud him for being who he is. He gives us so much, he tells us what he thinks, he says things and takes half of it back, he is REAL man. He interacts with the crowd he loves in ways other artists don't even think of. You can be an Ass-hat and think hes an asshole based on other peoples opinions of him, or you can use your brain and understand his motives and intentions behind what he says and does.  \n\nIn Glastonbury 2009, after his set at the Dance arena, I was backstage and he came out, I offered him to share my cannabis joint (I am pothead). He declined, and sat down on the chair pretty much next to me. I sparked my joint, and smoked it, and he didnt say SHIT. He didnt run to bouncers and bitch about me, he was just doing his own thing. This whole Rusko thing is stupid, and theres obviously more to it because the two accounts vary. \n\nThe Madonna thing, he is RIGHT. Someone with such a wide audience as Madonna should not be encouraging the use of any substance. \n\nThe DJ's push play thing, he is RIGHT. I sit in by bedroom and ''mix'', I dont think that deserves the merit of playing to a crowd, when all I am doing is beat matching and fading. There needs to be something more, and Im glad Mau5 has the balls to say it without caring about upsetting anyone. \n\nThat Turbo skull article was stupid, oh so he ordered his girlfriend about on livestream so hes an asshole. Dude i do that all the fucking time, and she orders me about when she feels like it. And Mau5 was probably doing that for the livestream anyway, as a j o k e. \n\nBut yeh, Mau5 is the man! Sad-happy, self-aware, conflicted dude, just being who he is while everything around him changes. I think he's a super-cool guy, and he creates some of the best music in the world. \n\n&lt;3", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347535023", "subreddit": "deadmau5", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The pressure needed to push a fluid through a pipe (with a few assumptions about the flow) scales as (L/r^4 ), where L is the length of the pipe and r is its radius. So, this will be difficult to do, even if you could manage to make a flawless nanotube that long. But I'll humor the question anyway.\n\nSpecifically, using the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, we see that:\n\nP = 128 x u x L x Q / pi * d^4 \n\nWhere P is pressure, u is viscosity, L is length, Q is flow rate, and d is diameter.\n\nWe'll assume you do this at 20C, where the dynamic viscosity of water is around 10^-3 Ns/m^2 . If we start plugging numbers in, we see that the pressure drop across the nanotube would be:\n\nP = 128 x 10^-3 Ns/m^2 x 10^3 m x Q m^3/s / (3.14159 x 10^-36 m^4)\n\nP = 4.0743 x Q x 10^37 N / m^2\n\nI have no idea what the ultimate or yield strength is of a single walled, 1nm diameter carbon nanotube. To be generous, I will say it's something like 100 GPa. So, that means the pressure in the tube can't exceed 100 GPa, which means the pressure we exert to push the fluid can't exceed this amount. \n\n10^11 Pa = 4 x Q x 10^37 Pa\n\nQ = 2.5 x 10^-27 m^3 /s = 2.5 nm^3 /s\n\nMy estimate for the strength could be way too high though, so this result may be wrong by a few orders or magnitude.\n\nI also don't know if this equation is valid for such small diameter tubes, as I am no expert in fluid mechanics; perhaps someone else who knows more on that can elaborate.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347803810", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Slightly annoying, but, let's see what else we have in store.  The acronym phonetically sounds silly as fuck.  YolO?  Sounds like YoYo.  Alright, what else?  Oh, pseudo intellectual music artists such as Drake (do not get me started on Flake), use it constantly in their music, and as if YOLO wasn't pseudo intellectual enough AS IT IS, he simply REPEATS the acronym over and over and over again, almost as misplaced as Britney Spears' \"If You Seek Amy\". (The lyric is \"All of the girls and boys want to If You Seek Amy\".  The sentence doesn't make sense.  If you say it quickly it sounds like \"All the girls/boys want to F U C K Me\".  It was written that way just to get away with saying \"F U C K me\" but using words in the English language that would sound it out.  So the lyrics as a sentence does not make any cohesive sense.

{"body": "There's so much misinformation about how Youtube works.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS and MONETIZATION are two features, even though the terms are encompassed in eachother. Furthermore advertisements in general and the 'flagging' of content works off of Google's algorithm to detect IP breaches if the content in question were to be monetized.\n\n\n-------------------------------\nCLASSIC PARTNERSHIP:\n\nGoogle works directly with you to place ads on your channel so long as your videos retain certain views. In effect, they 'monetize' your video, BUT this is NOT the same as the 'monetization' feature that this shit storm is about.\nA partner includes people like the TGS *channel*, Machinima *channel*, Totalbiscuit, Dodger, Jesse Cox, Tobuscus, Communitychannel, Nigahiga, etc.\n\n1. Individual partners: like TB and such are the easiest examples of partnership. They get approached by Google for a partnership, earn ad revenue for their videos and Google assists in the legal side of things. It is easier to 'monetize' content this way (you don't need to individually submit evidence of your ability to monetize a video, a problem only arises in the most serious cases of a copyright or NDA breach), but it is extremely hard to obtain a partnership. You need a constant stream of viewers and if you fail your quota consistently Google has the right to remove partnership status *permanently* pending a full review.\n\n2. Network channels: These include channels like TGS and Machinima - these channels are partnered channels and are considered 'networks'. The channel is partnered kind of like how an individual partner is, HOWEVER it employs subsidiaries underneath it. For example, the TGS channel itself is a youtube partner of sorts, however it has sub-contractors/partners it selects and deals with advertisements for (e.g. WP on the TGS network). So even if you yourself are not an individual partner, you can still earn a network partnership through these network ttype channels. Just look at how Machinima and Machinima respawn operate. You have the overarching channel, then you have the subsidiary content producers who are delegated ads via the employing network who deal with Google directly. A network is beneficial in that the network channel company deals with Google and legal issues directly and the content producer is relatively free in that regards. However the downside is that the content producers themselves earn less money overall because the network takes a cut from the ad revenue. Furthermore, creativity may be stifled because of pressure from the network itself (though I don't see this happening with TGS).\n\n\nSo if you're not a partner and apply to Youtube to get ads on your video what system are you under?\n\n---------------------------------------\n'NEW' MONETIZATION.\n\nThis is a relatively new feature to youtube. It allows ANYONE to request their video to be monetized. I do it and I earn peanuts. But I don't care because I'm still learning about production and speaking more confidently (in other words, my shit isn't good enough to be partner level, not by a long shot). This MONETIZATION feature is NOT the same as the monetization that occurs for partnerships. It is less reliable, less stable and you don't have the legal benefits from being partnered with Google. You're like a freelancer - not even contracted properly.\n\nEvery time I submit a video I have to request it to be 'monetized'. Two things might occur:\n\n1. The request is accepted (usually happens) and I get those little ads on my video (the annoying pop-up ones that you can close while you watch the video).\n\n2. The request becomes 'under review' and I am prompted by Google to submit evidence that I am able to monetize this content. I've had to submit the exact pinpoint quote (with hyperlink reference to boot) of BandaiNamco's policies regarding Dark Souls and redistribution as well as a copy of the manual (at page 18 of its PDF form on Steam, if I remember correctly) where it states I'm able to freely redistribute its content. I've had a video under review for a month before it became accepted and it was too late to make the money from the few thousand people that viewed it because the traffic decayed.\n\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nI'm highlighting how much of a ballbreaker it is for me to monetize a video when it randomly gets flagged for monetization review (it's NOT copyright review - I can still keep the video up - I just cannot monetize it!). Contrast this with how much easier it is for partners to upload and monetize a video - the difference is astounding. They don't have to prove with every video that gets randomly flagged the exact line where they are able to use the content, the chances of that happening are slim because they are legit partners and that's part of the benefit! Hell, they don't even have to ask and have every video reviewed for monetization like I do.\n\nIt's also to highlight the stark difference between what the man who started the 'Are you serious' thread experienced (a 'new' monetization flag) versus what happens to Youtubers who 'make it' (so to speak). EVERY company I've come across stipulates something about not being allowed to make money of their content. Go to NCSoft, Activision, EA, Valve, etc. and you'll find similar clauses in their agreements. Youtube uses a flagging algorithm that can automatically detect content that might infringe on certain IP rights. NCSoft doesn't flag it, it's the algorithm. The system for us monetizors casts a wide net to stop people from making money off of other people's IP. It doesn't care about the relations between youtubers and developers/publishers (i.e. I post a video I worked hard on of your content, you get exposure and more customers and I get money), it's to stop blatant abuses. This doesn't affect proper partners because they have had the advantage of working their way up to becoming a partner and acquiring the protection afforded by Google's partnership program. What this douchebag on the forums should have done is file evidence that he is able to make money off the content (i.e. link to other Youtubers making money off it where Google requests more information).\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy are you people acting like spoiled brats?\n\nIn the old days of Youtube the ONLY way to make money was to be a partner. And that's how the youtubers we love today made their money: they did good shit and became partners. There was no 'new' monetization - you were either a partner and made money, or you just made videos FOR FREE. This new feature allows EVERYONE to earn a small, tiny, minuscule, insignificant (do you get it, YOU WON'T MAKE A LOT UNLESS YOU'RE A PARTNER) piece of ad revenue BUT the clauses of publishers are enforced more harshly on those people because they aren't afforded the protections of partners.\n\nAnyone can still become a PARTNER if they are good enough. BUT, even if you aren't a partner you can earn a tiiiiiiny tiiiiiny bit of money using the MONETIZATION feature. Fuck mate, if you became popular enough you're guaranteed to become a partner and you won't even need to use the 'new' monetization feature (though your videos are monetized, but via partnership).\n\nJust remember that 3 years back, the people you know and love today worked for NOTHING every day of their lives to make a name for themselves on Youtube. They earned the right to be called a partner, no matter who the fuck they are. They deserve to be protected from publisher clauses that guard IP because they EARNT IT. Joe Blow just starting out on Youtube shouldn't complain because one video wasn't allowed to be monetized. That problem wouldn't even arise if you worked hard on your content, became a great contributor and earned partnership. This is all because people want easy money.\n\n---------------------------------------\nWhat are the complaints for? Nothing, NOTHING, N O T H I N G has changed. If you want to make Youtube money, you need to be a partner. That's how it always is. It's not some elite club: it's for people who become popular enough and get an offer from Google! People who are partners have it easier in the way of flags against their content because they have the protection of Google's lawyers. 'New' monetizors DON'T.\n\nThe ability to make some money has been made a bit easier by Google with the Monetization feature, but PARTNERSHIPS have and always will be the way to make a career out of it. 'New' monetization didn't even exist when my favourites became partners: Jesse Cox and TB were broke and struggling until they became partners. So why the fuck are people wanting a free ride? In fact, why are people complaining when monetization will earn you peanuts unless you become a YOUTUBE PARTNER.\n\nIt's like all the Youtubers say: make stuff people want to watch, make stuff people will enjoy watching and have a personality that the people can engage with.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCONCLUSION: 'but what can I do now?'\n\nSUCK IT THE FUCK UP LIKE THE REST OF US. If a video gets flagged submit your evidence and continue creating content. Upload more content. Request that it be monetized. If not, keep making content. Focus on YOUR CONTENT. NOT GETTING IT MONETIZED. If you don't focus on your content, then you're no better than the corporate assholes you call greedy. In fact, I'd hazard a guess that if all you focus on is the monetization of a couple of videos in the grand scheme of things, you'd make a great greedy corporate asshole. People worked for free a few years back to get to where they are today, and you're complaining about 1 or 2 videos that didn't get monetized?

{"body": "I could point you to an argument I had last night to a guy that is in absolute love with Romney.  It all started when I posted about the 47% video.  His reasoning (Which I actually agreed with somewhat) was this: (copy/pasted and LOOOOONG winded)\n\n&gt;I deal in facts.\n\n&gt;FACT: Romney has not been President, so any statements about what he \"might\" do as President is pure speculation.\n\n&gt;FACT: Obama IS President and is doing a SHITTY job at it. I KNOW what I have with him using the past four years as a \"measuring tool\".\n\n&gt;I'll take Romney and the \"unknown\" over a known moron any day. Then, if Romney screws up, we'll just have to tear him a new one also! ﻿\n\n&gt;Face it. Obama has FAILED..... F A I L E D !\nIt's not racist, it's not partisan, it's a fact. The country is far worse since he took office...and it is deteriorating rapidly with each moment he sits in office. Romney may not be perfect, but ANY solution is better than that JOKE who occupies the White House currently.﻿\n\nNow bear in mind, this is one person's view, but it is a shared mentality.\nBTW this was my response:\n\n&gt;I never said he didn't fail.  I deal in Facts as well. But the difference between you and I is that I sited specifics.  You are generalizing.\n\n&gt;Fact: This nations economy was in freefall just before November 2008.  NOTHING Obama could do would have prevented what happened.  What could have helped would have been Congress being bi-partisan and working together instead of the republicans chanting about making sure he was a \"One Term President\".\n\n&gt;Fact: Obama expanded the \"Patriot Act\"  By adding more provisions for wiretapping.  He also signed up on the domestic spying crap.  He also allowed the RIAA/MPAA to run rampant and unchecked, Suing grandmothers and young kids for millions of dollars over a few MP3 downloads. (Bush gets the \"here's your sign\" award for a PRINTER getting a cease and desist order)\n\n&gt;Fact:  Mitt Romney required 10 years of tax returns from his running mates, while he won't reciprocate for the public.  Although allegedly a hacker group are about to release them.\n\n&gt;Also according to Romney's OWN LOGIC.  His father wouldn't even vote for him, because George Romney Lived on Welfare.  Thus being a part of the 47% he insulted back in May.\n\n&gt;I won't argue that Obama failed in some ways.  But he hasn't completely failed as you claim.  Romney however, can't even manage to tell the truth.  So, how could he be a trusted leader?﻿\n\n\nAfter this he stopped the argument saying \"My grandmother has a saying about people like you\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348140839", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Network channels: These include channels like TGS and Machinima - these channels are partnered channels and are considered 'networks'. The channel is partnered kind of like how an individual partner is, HOWEVER it employs subsidiaries underneath it. For example, the TGS channel itself is a youtube partner of sorts, however it has sub-contractors/partners it selects and deals with advertisements for (e.g. WP on the TGS network). So even if you yourself are not an individual partner, you can still earn a network partnership through these network ttype channels. Just look at how Machinima and Machinima respawn operate. You have the overarching channel, then you have the subsidiary content producers who are delegated ads via the employing network who deal with Google directly. A network is beneficial in that the network channel company deals with Google and legal issues directly and the content producer is relatively free in that regards. However the downside is that the content producers themselves earn less money overall because the network takes a cut from the ad revenue. Furthermore, creativity may be stifled because of pressure from the network itself (though I don't see this happening with TGS).\n\n\nSo if you're not a partner and apply to Youtube to get ads on your video what system are you under?\n\n---------------------------------------\n'NEW' MONETIZATION.\n\nThis is a relatively new feature to youtube. It allows ANYONE to request their video to be monetized. I do it and I earn peanuts. But I don't care because I'm still learning about production and speaking more confidently (in other words, my shit isn't good enough to be partner level, not by a long shot). This MONETIZATION feature is NOT the same as the monetization that occurs for partnerships. It is less reliable, less stable and you don't have the legal benefits from being partnered with Google. You're like a freelancer - not even contracted properly.\n\nEvery time I submit a video I have to request it to be 'monetized'. Two things might occur:\n\n1. The request is accepted (usually happens) and I get those little ads on my video (the annoying pop-up ones that you can close while you watch the video).\n\n2. The request becomes 'under review' and I am prompted by Google to submit evidence that I am able to monetize this content. I've had to submit the exact pinpoint quote (with hyperlink reference to boot) of BandaiNamco's policies regarding Dark Souls and redistribution as well as a copy of the manual (at page 18 of its PDF form on Steam, if I remember correctly) where it states I'm able to freely redistribute its content. I've had a video under review for a month before it became accepted and it was too late to make the money from the few thousand people that viewed it because the traffic decayed.\n\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nI'm highlighting how much of a ballbreaker it is for me to monetize a video when it randomly gets flagged for monetization review (it's NOT copyright review - I can still keep the video up - I just cannot monetize it!). Contrast this with how much easier it is for partners to upload and monetize a video - the difference is astounding. They don't have to prove with every video that gets randomly flagged the exact line where they are able to use the content, the chances of that happening are slim because they are legit partners and that's part of the benefit! Hell, they don't even have to ask and have every video reviewed for monetization like I do.\n\nIt's also to highlight the stark difference between what the man who started the 'Are you serious' thread experienced (a 'new' monetization flag) versus what happens to Youtubers who 'make it' (so to speak). EVERY company I've come across stipulates something about not being allowed to make money of their content. Go to NCSoft, Activision, EA, Valve, etc. and you'll find similar clauses in their agreements. Youtube uses a flagging algorithm that can automatically detect content that might infringe on certain IP rights. NCSoft doesn't flag it, it's the algorithm. The system for us monetizors casts a wide net to stop people from making money off of other people's IP. It doesn't care about the relations between youtubers and developers/publishers (i.e. I post a video I worked hard on of your content, you get exposure and more customers and I get money), it's to stop blatant abuses. This doesn't affect proper partners because they have had the advantage of working their way up to becoming a partner and acquiring the protection afforded by Google's partnership program. What this douchebag on the forums should have done is file evidence that he is able to make money off the content (i.e. link to other Youtubers making money off it where Google requests more information).\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy are you people acting like spoiled brats?\n\nIn the old days of Youtube the ONLY way to make money was to be a partner. And that's how the youtubers we love today made their money: they did good shit and became partners. There was no 'new' monetization - you were either a partner and made money, or you just made videos FOR FREE. This new feature allows EVERYONE to earn a small, tiny, minuscule, insignificant (do you get it, YOU WON'T MAKE A LOT UNLESS YOU'RE A PARTNER) piece of ad revenue BUT the clauses of publishers are enforced more harshly on those people because they aren't afforded the protections of partners.\n\nAnyone can still become a PARTNER if they are good enough. BUT, even if you aren't a partner you can earn a tiiiiiiny tiiiiiny bit of money using the MONETIZATION feature. Fuck mate, if you became popular enough you're guaranteed to become a partner and you won't even need to use the 'new' monetization feature (though your videos are monetized, but via partnership).\n\nJust remember that 3 years back, the people you know and love today worked for NOTHING every day of their lives to make a name for themselves on Youtube. They earned the right to be called a partner, no matter who the fuck they are. They deserve to be protected from publisher clauses that guard IP because they EARNT IT. Joe Blow just starting out on Youtube shouldn't complain because one video wasn't allowed to be monetized. That problem wouldn't even arise if you worked hard on your content, became a great contributor and earned partnership. This is all because people want easy money.\n\n---------------------------------------\nWhat are the complaints for? Nothing, NOTHING, N O T H I N G has changed. If you want to make Youtube money, you need to be a partner. That's how it always is. It's not some elite club: it's for people who become popular enough and get an offer from Google! People who are partners have it easier in the way of flags against their content because they have the protection of Google's lawyers. 'New' monetizors DON'T.\n\nThe ability to make some money has been made a bit easier by Google with the Monetization feature, but PARTNERSHIPS have and always will be the way to make a career out of it. 'New' monetization didn't even exist when my favourites became partners: Jesse Cox and TB were broke and struggling until they became partners. So why the fuck are people wanting a free ride? In fact, why are people complaining when monetization will earn you peanuts unless you become a YOUTUBE PARTNER.\n\nIt's like all the Youtubers say: make stuff people want to watch, make stuff people will enjoy watching and have a personality that the people can engage with.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nCONCLUSION: 'but what can I do now?'\n\nSUCK IT THE FUCK UP LIKE THE REST OF US. If a video gets flagged submit your evidence and continue creating content. Upload more content. Request that it be monetized. If not, keep making content. **Focus on YOUR CONTENT. NOT GETTING IT MONETIZED.** If you don't focus on your content, then you're no better than the corporate assholes you call greedy. In fact, I'd hazard a guess that if all you focus on is the monetization of a couple of videos in the grand scheme of things, you'd make a great greedy corporate asshole. People worked for free a few years back to get to where they are today, and you're complaining about 1 or 2 videos that didn't get monetized? Where's your work ethic?\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348150666", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "---\n\n\n**Weapon Scaling**\n\n---\n\nThe way the mechanic actually works is that a higher scaling rating gives more AR per stat point spent, up until the universal break-point for weapons which is at 40. After 40, Attack rating gains per point spent drop off to a fairly insignificant amount. We're talking like &lt;1 to 1 points of Attack Rating per Stat point.\n\nThe ranges are as follows in order from greatest gains per point to lowest gains per point: S A B C D E\n\nAlso, Scaling Ratings are ranges, meaning - for instance - that not every A scaling weapon has the same gains per stat point. Often times you'll see this any time you try to upgrade your weapon, as the additional AR from scaling will increase in the upgrade window, while your weapons Scaling Type will remain the same. \n\nThe Moonlight Greatsword is a good example of this. If you look at the AR gains based on its scaling modifer at a specific Int value, that number will increase as you upgrade the weapon even though ranks 1 through 5 all have an S for Int scaling. *I unfortunately don't have quick access to this weapon so I can't quite show you what I mean by this, but I will be adding in pictures to illustrate this once I finish this post*\n\nWhat you can take away from this though is that investing stat points into a weapon with a high scaling modifier will yield large gains to it's AR value. What this also means is that weapons with low scaling modifiers will not gain much benefit from stat increases, and may change how you optimize your character.\n\nFor instance, if I wanted to use a +15 Uchigatana, I would be inclined to bring my Dex up to the scaling breakpoint to make the best use of my weapon as it has an A in Dex scaling. However, if I were to look at a weapon like the Gravelord Sword, which has E scaling in both STR and DEX, then I would be significantly less inclined to raise my stats much higher than the minimum requirements as the gains may not be worth it if I were to use this weapon.\n\n---\n\n**Attack Rating Reductions from Enemy Defenses**\n\n---\n\nReductions from AR are exponential, meaning the more AR you have relative to defense values, the less of an effect defense has.\n\nFor instance, let's take a hypothetical magic defense value of 300 vs a Moonlight Greatsword which has only magic AR. The following is a simplified calculation not taking into account all variables such as which swing of a given move-set is being used etc, but this is just to illustrate the relation of defense and AR.\n\n\nUsing [Mud-Chan's mini-calc tab](https://public.sheet.zoho.com/publish/mudsama/defense-mini-calc-1), we get the following approximations for damage output. \n\n* At 100 AR, damage = ~11\n\n* At 200 AR, damage = ~44 (33 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 300 AR, damage = ~119 (75 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 400 AR, damage = ~206 (87 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 500 AR, damage = ~298 (92 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 600 AR, damage = ~393 (95 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 700 AR, damage = ~489 (96 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 800 AR, damage = ~586 (97 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 900 AR, damage = ~683 (97 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\n* At 1000 AR, damage = ~781 (98 damage for 100 additional AR)\n\nSo as you can see, as the AR increases relative to defense, the reductions from defense on any additional AR values is exponentially less.\n\nSo, for the super high AR weapons, its not as bad (eg: Demon Great Machete). Alternatively, something with really low AR (Bandit's Knife) get hit *very* hard by defense values.\n\nSo, for those of you considering using Elemental type weapons, you may want to rethink your approach.\n\nElemental types like Lightning, Fire, and Chaos are actually quite poor options once you have a reasonable amount of stat points invested into a scaling stat. +15 weapons tend to match or begin to outperform their Elemental counter parts by about 30 in it's scaling stats. Another interesting thing to notice about this, is how other scaling types (Magic, Enchanted, Divine etc) stack up against their elemental counter parts.\n\nWhen someone looks at an Enchanted Uchigatana at 40 Int and compares it to a Lightning Uchigatana they see the following:\n\n* Enchanted - 452 AR (168/284/0/0) \n\n* Lightning - 450 AR (225/0/0/225) - *Post PTD nerfs*\n\n\nMost people will discount the Enchanted Uchigatana right away. It's got a Split damage type, it has basically the exact same AR as its Lightning Counterpart, *and* it requires a huge stat point investment. What most people fail to notice however is how skewed the AR is for the Enchanted Weapon. \n\nIf we broke it down into percentages it'd be this: \n\n* Enchanted - 452 AR (37%/63%/-/-) \n\n* Lightning - 450 AR (50%/-/-/50%)\n\nWith what we know about how reductions work from enemy defense, we'd find that the Enchanted Uchi will actually do a fair bit more damage vs an enemy with decent defense values. \n\nLets assume 350 to all physical resist, and 300 to all elemental resists. Damage breaks down as follows:\n\n* Enchanted - 142 Damage (25/117/0/0)\n\n* Lightning - 113 Damage (47/0/0/66)\n\nSo all those people currently using a Lightning weapon as their backup on their Int build for instance, may want to reconsider and change to a different upgrade path.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348167588", "subreddit": "darksouls", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Learn classical guitar. You may like to join us in [r/classicalguitar](http://reddit.com/r/classicalguitar).\n\nClassical curricula use the PIMA system to denote the fingers on the right hand. Because classical guitar is all fingerpicking you can learn some very basic, very simple classical pieces and exercises to rapidly improve your skill.\n\nLet's start with PIMA. On the right hand P = thumb, I = Index finger, M = Middle finger, A = Ring finger. The pinky is unused.\n\nKnowing this you can learn Home Position. Skipping all information about classical posture and positioning of the instrument, Home Position is as follows.\n\nPlace P on either the sixth or fifth string. Place I on the third string. Place M on the second string. Place A on the first string. Remember, the first string (string one) is the one closest to the floor (high e) and string six is the one closest to your face (low E.) Do not brace any part of your hand against any part of the guitar (no, not even your unused pinky.)\n\nRest your fingers in home position and allow your hand to relax, arching your fingers slightly.\n\nNow begin with the following exercise.\n\nPluck the string you are resting P on, then place P back on that string, silencing it. Practice this a few times. Then pluck the string I is on, and then rest I back on that string (string 3, the G string,) silencing it. Practice this a few times. Do this for each finger. Try to keep the fingers that are not plucking resting on the strings in Home Position.\n\nNow try to do P, then I. Remember to rest your fingers back on the strings between each pluck. Then try to add M. PIM. Then add A. PIMA.\n\nNow try P I M A M I... P I M A M I... P I M A M I. As you become comfortable with this pattern you will be able to speed up. As you speed up it becomes less important to rest your fingers back on the string. This is only to train your hand to automatically seek home position, which you will become comfortable with very quickly.\n\nOnce you are comfortable with that you must learn to alternate fingers. Learn to alternate IM, MA, and IA. This is called picado in classical guitar terminology. Try not to double strike with the same finger. You don't want to end up playing IIIII MMM AAA or patterns like that except in certain circumstances, in which case the thumb usually breaks up the double strikes; for example, PMPMPM is fairly common in pieces that are preparing you for tremolo technique. A good way to practice picado picking is by using scales.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348180121", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here is a quick guide from one guitarist to another. ( most likely there are 25 comments besides this one that explain the difference between a Mode, and a modality, so when we use modes on the guitar we are really using scale pieces and not properly playing in a Mode ( because the progression has to do certain things for it to be in a mode, namely resolve modally, but that's a different story) O.K so with that disclaimer, here is the breakdown.\n The 7 modes of the major scale are already found in the major scale you are playing so Do RE MI FA SOL LA TO DO, when you start this at another point besides Do ( which would be an Ionian mode) it get's a new name ( that the strict theorists don't like for the aforementioned reasons) . For example RE MI FA SOL LA TO DO RE would be a Dorian mode and so on and so forth. The sixth mode -Aeolian LA TI DO RE MI FA SOL LA = an Aeolian mode which is a Natural minor scale. From here, there are 2 basic alterations, the Harmonic and melodic minor scales, both are said to \" descend in natural minor so you alter the pitch accordingly when you ascend and change it back on the way down.\n An easy way to consider the three basic minor scales of Natural , Harmonic and Melodic minor is to consider 3 basic chord progressions.\n1.Am Dm Em = A natural minor ( a b c d e f g a = 6 to 6 in C major) \n2.Am Dm EMajor, now we need a G# note for the E major so we use A harmonic minor ( a b c d e f g # a) \n3. Am D major E major now we need an F# for the D major and a G# for the E major so we use melodic minor (a b c d e f # g# a ) \nSo getting back to modes for a minute, if we number a major scale DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1, them modes look like this\nIonian major = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, Dorian 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 , Phrygian =3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 ,Lydian = 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4, Mixolydian = 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5, Aeolian (natural minor) 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 Locrian 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Piano players love to talk about modes as alterations of major scales, guitarists do much better as considering modes INSIDE of major scales, it makes all of the patterns and positions easier, for example the one major scale pattern you most likely know, now covers all of the modes for that key ( and the strict theory guys are pulling their hair out now because that's not the way modes really work, but you're trying to Rock not play something from the 1500's).\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348332307", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let's say you have an LVM volume with the lowercase alphabet on it. Nothing more.\nYou take a snapshot of the LVM volume.\n\nYour snapshot has nothing in it, because the original volume has not changed. If you were to open your snapshot right now, since there's nothing in it, then LVM would just give you the lowercase alphabet. When you go to open the letter `a`, then the snapshot would realize that the location on the origin has not changed, and it would go fetch a from the original volume.\n\nNow let's take `xyz` on the original volume and replace them with `FFF`. The first thing that happens is `xyz` is written to the snapshot, with the locations of the `xyz` characters. Then `FFF` is written over `xyz` on the source volume.\n\nSo if you mount the snapshot right now, it still has the lowercase alphabet on it. When you go to read the letters `a` through `w`, it sees that it does not have any changes for those letters, so it just pulls them from their homes original volume. When you go to read the last three letters, it realizes that it has the original copy of them in the snapshot, so it gives you `xyz` from the snapshot.\n\nThis happens on any scale. First, the original content is sent to the snapshot, and then the modification is made to the original volume.\n\nNow, let's make changes to the snapshot itself. Snapshots can be written to as well! Let's replace `abcd` with `REDD` in the snapshot. We don't have to copy the original volume this time, we just write `REDD` to the snapshot. If you go look at the snapshot now, it knows that positions 1-4 have `REDD`, that positions 4-23 are unmodified, and it has a copy of the original `xyz` that was modified in the original volume.\n\nI'll play this out graphically with the letters `abcdef`. LVM knows on the disk where the records are, so we'll number the positions.\n\n    LVM Volume\n    # 1 2 3 4 5 6\n      a b c d e f\n\nNow let's take a snapshot. We have to specify how \"big\" we want the snapshot to be. It uses this space to keep track of the changes. So our original volume is 6 wide, we'll make the snapshot 4 wide.\n\n    LVM Volume\n    # 1 2 3 4 5 6\n     a b c d e f\n\n    LVM Snapshot, size 4\n    (empty)\n\nIf you open the snapshot, it sees that nothing is there, so it just presents the slots from the original volume.\n\nNow let's change the `a` in slot 1 on the original volume to an `x`\n\n    LVM Volume\n    # 1 2 3 4 5 6\n      x b c d e f\n\n    LVM Snapshot\n    # 1\n      a\n\nSo if we read the snapshot, it reads slot 1 from the snapshot, then reads back slots 2-6 from the original volume, since they haven't changed.\n\nLet's change `d` on the original volume to a `p`:\n\n    LVM Volume\n    # 1 2 3 4 5 6\n      x b c p e f\n\n    LVM Snapshot\n    # 1 4\n      a d\n\nSo now if we open the snapshot and read it back, it reads slot 1 from the snapshot, then it reads 2,3 from the origin, then 4 from the snapshot, then 5 and 6 from the origin. So we can reconstruct `abcdef` from what we have. Remember that we allocated 4 slots to the snapshot! So we've also used 50% of our snapshot space to keep track of these changes.\n\nMount the snapshot and change the snapshot itself! Let's change `c` on the snapshot to `u`\n\n    LVM Volume\n    # 1 2 3 4 5 6\n      x b c p e f\n\n    LVM Snapshot - size 4\n    # 1 4 3\n      a d u\n\nNow when we go read back the snapshot, we get `abudef` . Slots 2, 5 and 6 are pulled from the original volume. We are now at 75% of our snapshot space in use.\n\nThe process of mapping the changes actually happens a little bit backwards to what you would think.

It's generally the first and/or last chord of a song in simpler music.\n\nThere's a system for finding the chords in a key, it works like this:\n\nYou have Roman numerals for each position in a scale. For example, in the G major scale (1 sharp), you have:\n\nG A B C D E F#, which corresponds to.    \nI II III IV V VI VII (1-7)\n\nBut what about minors, 7s, diminished, etc.?\nThese are denoted like so:\n\nMinor chords are lowercase Roman numerals, like vi (which is Em in your G major example)\n\nDiminished chords look like this: vii• (a degree symbol, I don't have one on my iDevice. That was F#dim, by the way)\n\nAugmented: ii+ (Am aug)\n\nExtended chords: ii7, V9, vii6 (Am7, D9, F#m6) etc.\n\n\nThen, you have \"formulas\" to determine the chords in a key. They go like this:\n\nMajor: I ii iii IV V vi vii•\n(Which is G Am Bm C D Em F#dim in the key of G major, or C Dm Em F G Am Bdim in the key of C major)\n\nMinor: i ii• III iv v VI VII (Gm Adim B Cm Dm E F# in the key of G minor)\n\nThere are others too, and it's fairly easy to look them up if you need them, but this should get you started.\n\nSo, basically, you learned about Roman numeral notation, what a \"key\" is, and how to apply your newfound knowledge of keys to produce good sounding chords of of thin air.\n\nIf any of this doesn't make sense, check out www.teoria.com for some basic music theory information.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348453858", "subreddit": "ukulele", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

The thing most people don't get is: often when bands get big it's because they've distinguished themselves from others and are able to carve out a little niche for themselves. Their sound eventually becomes generic and overplayed when a whole shitload of other bands come after them and leach off (are \"influenced\") by their success and copy their sound.

{"body": "Well, I think the cheapest way (as in most cheaty), is to just use white keys and know all the modes.\n\nIIRC, you can play all the modes just using the white keys, but starting from a different note. Sorry if this is too much explanation, but I tend to explain like I'm explaining the most basic stuff.\n\nSay your song is in C Minor, and you want to write a melody. Well, find the A key (it helps if you have your keys labelled), and then write a melody in the key of A. Then, using your DAW or whatever software you're using, transcribe each note down by 1.5 steps (three white/black keys). Or, to whatever key you want, by just moving your 'A' note to whatever root note you have, and then moving all of your notes by that same interval.\n\nFor example. Your major key melody is C B F E G B D C\nYour song is in the key of E. C is 4 half steps down from E. \nC - C# - D - D# - E\n\nSo E D# A G# B D# F# E\n\nEventually you'll learn more modes in different positions, and you'll be able to just memorize them. It's a lot different than guitar I know, because on guitar you just memorize the shape, and you can move it up or down.\n\nI know this doesn't help you learn to play, but it at least gives you a basis to write from the piano roll (which is difficult, yeah). If you've got questions, or you don't know what I'm saying, feel free to message me or reply, and I'll see if I can address your question.\n\nSource: Lots of writing, transcribing, and recording.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348603354", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Irelia - early leap and harass with constant sustain. As per you're early game not explaining this because it's obvious.\n\nMid - you assumed you are fed and therefor would have trinity and wits at that point. Irelia excels in farming and given the first few kills with her consistent damage and high sustain You are a beast and hit like a truck while still having a high amount of survivablity.\n\nLate - Same as mid only more beefy. If you've been winning the whole game as irelia You can carry very hard and give your team a huge advantage. \n\nOk She was obivous less practical top laner.\n\nPantheon \n\nEarly - Amazing Q poke with ability to trade with range auto atks (jayce Ken etc) with passive. Weak vs a gank so either need jungler to help or ealry ward/awareness to avoid getting stompped 2v1 (as most tops have this problem). But according to your logic W (leap from brush only with a stun) then flash out will get you out everytime (It doesn't).  \n\nMid - Assuming the same thing you get first 1- 2 kill which is much more likely on pantheon as his lvl 1-5 is soo much stronger then rengars you make it to mid game. You can control other lanes very effectivly stomping out either ADC or AP carry with ults for gank (exposes your lane but normally DK or shut down mid is worth it ) Also Should also be able to push a lane faster than their top laner after a DK or killing mid. Your Q W E Q combo does huge burst with hard CC so you litterly take 0 damage 1v1 until after your combo is off (pending no silence or stun gets off on you before your W lands). Even if they do turn to face you your passive which will ignore a lot of AA damage plus with brutilizer and BT you should have the sustain and damage to beat anyone that didn't stack armour. \n\nLate - Pantheon doesn't make it to late most games but assuming he does he begins to build his bruizer/ tanky items. However if you build him assasin as your rengar you can total any ADC you land your ult near. However this never happeneds (as it wouldn't with your AP Carry rengar) because their team would CC/burst you down. Typically you wait for an engage getting as much of their team as you can and then stick on the ADC with flash and W effectively taking him out of the fight. Your Mercs, Hexdrinker and GA/Atmas will keep you alive long enough to out box most adc's due to your passive. It's very fight to fight dependent but according to your argument, you are much more fed then them and will have no problem with this. \n\nThis type of mind set can't be put towards any champion. Most people that make it very high (1700-1800+) by abusing one champion and get really really good with that 1 champion. Obviously you need the general skills; awareness warding potential etc etc to reach these levels but you've clearly just abused a champion and learned ways to punish your opponent effectively with him.

This was causing a bit of a stir for many subjects, as no TA's meant the Prof's would have to grade the exams themselves.\n\nI was taking a 3rd year Atmospheric Science course at the time, the final was worth 60% of your grade, and this professor in particular had a reputation for horrifically hard exams. \n\nIn the examination room he told us the final had become 12 multiple choice questions because of the strike. Upon this announcement, a few people actually cheered (Before being reminded that speaking would be a failure. Exams are serious business). And then the exams were passed out.\n\nIt was 12 pages long, printed on legal size paper. Scrap paper was provided. This was necessary because each question had 26 possible answers, and required a fair amount of math to work out. Hopes were dashed, explicit words were muttered, but what can you do.\n\nThe answer key was as follows:\n\nY O U W I N Y O U W I N\n\nFucking douchebag.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348711282", "subreddit": "MLPLounge", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As a huge blanket statement, the chord tones and the notes a whole step above them are kosher for soloing over most chords (dominants being the exception, but that's beyond the purview of this reply).\n\nSo over Am, chord tones are A C E, and the notes a whole step up from those are B D F#. Whether you use G or G# is up to you. So you can either play A Dorian (A B C D E F# G) or A melodic minor (A B C D E F# G#).\n\nOver F major, chord tones are F A C, and the notes a whole step up are G B D. And again, if the chord has no 7, whether you use the natural 7 or flat 7 is up to you (Eb or E). So you'd have F Lydian dominant (F G A B C D Eb) or F Lydian (F G A B C D E).\n\nAnother interesting approach is to apply pentatonic scales. While all seven notes of a scale may sound nice, sometimes avoiding notes gives a neat impression as well. Over A minor, A minor pentatonic (A C D E G) is an obvious choice. However, B minor pentatonic (B D E F# A) and E minor pentatonic (E G A B D) add some different tensions.\n\nOver F major, you can use F major/D minor pentatonic (F G A C D), and similarly, G major/E minor pentatonic (G A B D E) and C major/A minor pentatonic (C D E G A) add new sounds. I particularly like the sound of G major pentatonic over F major, as it adds the 9, #11, 13, and 7 to an otherwise bland chord. Something to notice is that the tonic isn't in the scale, though (no F in G major pentatonic), so you'll either resolve to the F anyway or resolve to another note (most likely A).\n\nReally, just use whatever sounds good. I'm sure that most would agree that experimentation is far superior to theory crafting, even in a theory forum. One neat idea (at least in my opinion) over that progression is the descending half-step line G-F# (over Am) F-E (over F). You'd be playing fitting tones over both chords while still getting a neat chromatic sound.\n\ntl;dr: Play really fast and sloppy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348712092", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "You can try [r/french](http://www.reddit.com/r/french).\n\nThe translation is very hard, because of the wordplay \"hug/tug\". In french, the tug o' war is called \"tir à la corde\" (\"rope-pulling\") or \"lutte à la corde\" (\"rope-fighting\"). \n\nWe have to find a word that can be used to describe the war (tirer could mean \"to fire\", but I believe \"*lutte*\" is better (mean fight, struggle, wrest...)). \n\nThen, we have to find the wordplay with tug and hug. And that's the most difficult part, because we have \"corde\". I can't find any word to made the wordplay. The best I can find is \"câlin\" (yeah, only the first letter is the same), which means \"cuddle\". It doesn't sound perfect, and doesn't rhyme. And it has to be a feminine noun (with a masculine, it'll become \"lutte au\" instead of \"lutte à\"). \n\nAnd when you try to use the same rhyme (i'm not really good with pronunciation, so maybe I've made a mistake : A A B B C B ? D C D)\n\nThe best is maybe to change the tug of war, but keep the rhyme?\n\nSo, I can't do it (and I'm sleepy), but maybe you can use something like that :\n\n\n\"Guerre des câlins\" (war of hugs)\n\nJe ne jouerais pas à la guerre entre humains.

Common ideological and economic bonds existed between the antagonists inside South Africa. An outdated racial hierarchy eventually clashed with economic imperatives when the costs exceeded the benefits of racial minority rule in a global pariah state. In the Israeli case, outside support sustains intransigence. Only when the colonial policies of occupation embarrass and threaten their stronger patrons abroad or can no longer be so easily contained inside (as apartheid racial capitalism did in the Cold War competition) can outside pressure on Israel be expected. This turning of the tables will impact the Israeli public as much as outside perception is affected by visionary local leaders and events. Despite gains in global empathy, Palestinians are still at the mercy of a superior adversary in every respect, which even a Mandela would not have been able to overcome. In this impasse, hope is offered by Israeli progressive moral dissent on the Left as well as opportunistic calculations on the Right that the occupation harms the occupier. Israel has the capacity to reach a meaningful compromise, but has yet to prove its willingness. The Palestinian mainstream has the willingness, but lacks the capacity, to initiate a fair settlement.\"\n^ Adam, Heribert &amp; Moodley, Kogila. op. cit. p. xvi.\n^ Adam, Heribert &amp; Moodley, Kogila. op. cit. p. x.\n^ a b Ronald Bruce St John (1 February 2007). \"Apartheid By Any Other Name\".

{"body": "IIRC the wrong shortcut was `dw`, not `cw`. I guess they have changed it [in the mean time](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4251448).\n\n    lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\n      ^\n    dw\n    loipsum dolor sit amet &lt;-- deletes until next word, including any amount of whitespace\n      ^\n    de\n    lo dolor sit amet &lt;-- deletes to the end of the word\n      ^\n\n`dw` deletes everything until the next word, *including* the end of the current word. That it deletes the end of the current word is almost a side effect, while `de` literraly deletes to the end of the current word.\n\nVimtutor explains the grammar (combining \"action\" and \"motion\") and gives you the basic elements to play with (`d`, `c`, `w`, `e`…) because that's all you need. After a while, you are supposed to learn new actions and new motions and use that very simple grammar to tie it all together and become more efficient. That's how it's supposed to work.\n\nThe whole point of Vim's amazing basic commands and motions + grammar is precisely that you don't have to learn how to \"delete until the second single quote\" or \"cut this line and put it 10 lines above\" or whatever. You shouldn't learn `dw`, `ce`, `d2t'` or `:m-10`. Here is the whole range of delete+motion command I could think of ATM:\n\n    dw dW de dE db dB d/foo d?bar dtx dTx dfy dFy d^ d$ dd d) d} dit dat dib dab diB daB …\n\nand the whole range of change commands:\n\n    cw cW cb cB ce cE c/foo d?bar ctx cTx cfy cFy c^ c$ cc c) c} cit cat cib cab ciB caB …\n\nNoone is supposed to learn all these 46 commands and their `y` friends and their dozens of variations. That would make no sense at all. Learning `cw` means nothing. What you learn, instead is…\n\nActions:\n\n    d y c p i a s r\n\nMotions:\n\n    w e b (once you know what W does it's trivial to generalize to B and E)\n    t f (same deal for T and F)\n    i a\n    ) }\n    ^ $\n    / ?\n\nThat's only 20 or so small chunks, that can be combined to express anything you would want to do in the most freakingly precise way possible. Let's say I forgot a handful of basic commands and we have what? 25 or so discrete chunks of information to commit to memory. Chunks that happen to map quite easily with their corresponding \"word\": `a` for around, `r` for replace… I don't think it's hard or difficult at all.\n\nI'm also a kid of the 80's and I didn't play videogames. I don't care at all about beating scores. I'm curious, though, and that's probably what drove me while I was learning Vim. Yes, I think that repetitive tasks are hard work. That's one of the reasons why I love Vim: it provides so much power and so many mechanisms to make boring and repetitive activities almost fun. Going through such a boring and repetitive tutorial to be better at streamlining other boring and repetitive tasks sounds like a paradoxical waste of time to me.\n\nThe repetition happens when you use Vim: after 3 or 4 first times, composing `dat` becomes so natural it is even faster than actually verbalizing \"delete this tag\". That's my point: learn the basics and exercise. By using Vim. No third party tool needed.\n\nBut, as I already wrote, it looks like you have put quite a lot of pressure on yourself and I can understand, given that context, that you may need a tool like shortcutfoo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348773968", "subreddit": "vim", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Caveat lector: I don’t transcript runes all that often, nor have I done transcription generally in a long time, nor am I very familiar with the Scandinavian languages that I suggest below. And the guesses that I take here were off the top of my head and would not probably stand up to academic rigor, at least without more explanation. Having said all that…\n\nI used Danish long-branch and Swedish/Norwegian short-branch variants of the Younger Futhark to transcribe our restroom writing:\n\n    iak:hari:takar:\n    mina:kuþar:au:\n    lukan:at:fąþa:\n    i:nąr:uars:\n    fins:tiþ:fąr:\n    fnmili:ąf:uanar:\n\nIt looks like the text uses four characters that represent vowels:\n\n&lt;u&gt; ur\n&lt;ą&gt; as\n&lt;i&gt; is\n&lt;a&gt; ar\n\nThis could suggest a typologically balanced vowel system of i, u, a, and ɔ. I suggest /ɔ/ for &lt;ą&gt; because the name of the character varied from as to oss, suggesting a back rounded vowel. If so, native users of English at least could think of &lt;ą&gt; as &lt;o&gt;, which might become useful later.\n\nThe text contains characters for the following consonants:\n\nk h r t m n þ l f s t\n\n(&lt;þ&gt; is thorn, probably representing /θ/, an unvoiced interdental fricative like the first sound in the English word think.)\n\nWe could also guess that, initially, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;u&gt; represent approximants /j/ and /w/ like the first sounds in the English words year and wind, respectively.\n\niak and mina\n*iak* and *mina* look like nominative and possessive forms, respectively, of the first-person pronoun (\"I\" and \"my\" in English). Modern forms in Scandinavian languages look something like \"jeg\" or \"min.”\n\nCan someone familiar with ScandinavianNorth Germanic languages comment?\n\nfnmili\nThe first string of characters in line 6, *fnmili*, is odd. Nowhere else does the text suggest that nasal characters serve as syllabic nuclei. It also doesn’t look like anything sensible for a European language.\n\nBut what if we assume that the scribe made an error?\n\nThe characters for A and N are similar except in the angle of the crossbar. If this is a scribal error, and the scribe intended A instead of N, then the transcription would represent something much more familiar (pun intended): *famili*.\n\ntakar\ntakar looks like some form of tak, “take,” in some Scandinavian languages. I’m not sure if any of them use -r as an ending, but /n/ varies with rhotics in several languages, so it’s not out of the question to think that -r here is doing something similar to -n.\n\nlukan\nlukan looks similar to Old Norse and Faroesa lúk, meaning “close.” Some Germanic languages form their infinitive with an -n ending, and lukan thereby appears in Old Saxon, etc. See lūkanan.\n\nuars\nIf we assume an approximant value for initial &lt;u&gt;, then we get a word that looks like the plural English wars. If this is some kind of hodge-podge of Germanic languages, then maybe the text is talking about wars.\n\nWritten out as in modern sentence form, the text looks like:\n\niak hari takar mina kuþar au lukan ah fąþa i nąr uars fins tiþ fąr famili ąf uanar.\n\nIf we substitute &lt;o&gt; for &lt;ą&gt;, as discussed above, we get:\n\niak hari takar mina kuþar au lukan ah foþa i nor uars fins tiþ for famili of uanar.\n\nThat’s all the time I have to spend on this right now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348843905", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1600 elo irelia main here I know 1600 isn't high, but I play on a machine that gives me 15 fps in teamfights.  Playing nothing but Irelia helped me climb nearly 500 elo.  \n\nIrelia's laning phase is really, really bad at early levels.  I usually go Q E W W W by level 5.  I get Q first because she loses pretty much every level 1 trade against everyone and it's a great escape spell against ganks.  If you are purple side and you get level 2 ganked from someone coming behind you from the tribush, just Q onto them.  At lower elos, they won't recognize that by coming behind you, they just gave you a free escape.  I get E at level 2 because it's a stun that helps you survive.\n\nAt level 4, you should have 2 points in your W and you should be able to start trading.  The way I play irelia, I usually, end up pushed near my turret, and I free farm under turret all day.  I usually run flat armor seals,flat ad quints and marks, and flat/per level(up to you) glyphs.  With ad quints and marks, you should be able to take every last hit under the tower.  2 tower shots + auto for melee, 1 tower shot + auto for ranged.  Cannon minions are trickier, so just use your Q if you aren't sure you'll get it.\n\nSo basically, until you're level 4, farm, farm, farm, farm.  Use the bushes, use your Q, use your stun, etc... but just try to stay alive and farm as much as you can until levels 4-5.  \n\nWhen you're level 4-5, you should be able to start trading but you need to be able to recognize when you can win trades.  This is mostly something that you need to learn yourself because everything is situational.  Obviously don't trade against minions because minions hurt, and you need to know that your Q gives you a free auto attack immediately after cast.  So if you turn on W, auto someone, Q them immediately afterward, you'll get 3 autos worth of damage + Q damage in less than 2 seconds.\n\nIrelia cannot trade without her W on, so when hiten style is about to run out, just back off.  In addition, her W scales with attack speed(because it's true damage) so if you're laning against a malphite or lee sin, they will lower your attack speed so you're better off doing very short auto Q auto trades against them.  Because this will eat up your mana, I recommend getting mana regen masteries, or buying philostone and mana pots.  Personally I buy mana pots and I find that it gives me unlimited harass if I chug those things like health pots.\n\nAt level 9, you are an absolute monster, and very few people can outrade you.  Level 5 hiten style does 75 true damage per hit, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Ward up your lane, and force trades.  Remember that your Q refreshes on cooldown, so if you Q onto a low hp minion that's standing next to the enemy laner, you can instantly pop your E on him and start hiting him with your Ws.  When he runs away, because your Q is refreshed, you can Q onto him for additional damage.  I recommend getting phage with her because if you get phage procs by doing this, you will chunk half or over half of their HP.  \n\nSo Irelias laning phase in a nutshell is:\n\n1.  Farm Farm Farm\n2.  Trade with W.  Buy phage\n3.  Use Q and E as escape tools.\n4.  Turn on W, Q onto low hp minion standing next to enemy laner.  E enemy laner, auto him, Q when he's about to get away.\n\nFor the rest of the game, Irelia is a monster in mid game.  Because top lane is so removed from the rest of the game, if you leave your lane and try to force an objective like baron, and your enemy laner doesn't follow you, you are essentially making the game a 5v4 in your favor.  Mid game irelia is scary as hell, and you should be trying to get your team to force objectives.  Don't be afraid to leave top lane and let the enemy laner take your top turret if you think it means you can net a dragon and some kills in the process.  Around level 11, ask your support/jungler to clear bottom lane wards, and gank bot.  Unless bottom is already fed to oblivion, you should be able to force them to recall or get kills, and take dragon asap afterwards.\n\nA lot of people like to trinity/witts end  frozen mallet/witts end build on her, personally I prefer just getting the trinity, then getting GA asap.  Witts end is nice because she scales so nicely with attack speed, but her damage is already so high at mid game I find that the witts end isn't necessary.  I've done the frozen mallet/witts end build on her and to be honest, I hate it.  It doesn't provide as much utility as a trinity and it costs more-but that could be just because of my play style with her.  I have seen irelias build witts end/frozen mallet and dominate with it\n\nSo basically for mid game is\n\n1.  If you can take the tower early, do it, if you can't, shove and roam.\n2.  Join rest of team, create 5v4, gank bot lane and take objectives.\n3.  You want to have your main items by around 20 mins.  20 minute trinity is good.  Anything before 20 is great.  If you can get trinity before 20 minutes, leave your lane asap and gank wherever and whoever you can.  This is when irelia really, really shines.\n\nWhen it comes to late game teamfights, you're a good initiator, but not the best.  However, if you don't have a strong initiator such as a amu or galio, it's probably your job to initiate.  When you start a teamfight, don't go balls deep on their adc unless they lack strong peel, start off focusing someone else first (doesn't really matter who although I recommend not a tank).  REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR Q.  Two or three seconds into the teamfight is when you Q onto their carry.  Pop W, pop your ult, use everything and try to gib their carry.  The reason you don't want to immediately jump their carry is because chances are youll be out of position for your team to fully help you.  But, as irelia, you don't have that much peel, so it's your job to zone their carries.  However, you need to remember not to chase their carries too far.  If an EZ arcane shifts over a wall, do you wanna flash over or run around to chase him, or would you be better off trying to kill the bruiser on your carry?  I find that 90% of the time, you're better off not chasing.  Having said all that, if you're fed,  just jump their carry to initiate.\n\nHaving trinity and popping your W and Q onto caster minion will instantly gib it and refresh your cooldown.  It's great for initiation.\n\nBut like all bruisers, irelia falls off late game.  The way I think about playing irelia is that she is the mid game unstoppable force that paves the way for your adc to carry late game.\n\nTL:DR\n\nFarm farm farm, trade with W.  Leave lane, take objectives(if your team is doing fine without you, just stay top and farm, farm, farm unless their top laner leaves)  Zone carries in teamfights, dominate mid game, cross fingers and hope you have a good adc late game.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348990585", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "that link wont work unless you're regitered so here is some of the text:\n\n\n\"All artists, masters or journeymen, had to proceed through a period of apprenticeship where they learned both the skills of their trade and to work in a specific style, while working at the lowest rungs of the organizational ladder in a specific workshop. The apprentice started with the most menial tasks such as the grinding of pigments.... The system of education also provided a means of appropriability; aworkshop ’owned ’its style which could hardly be satisfactorily  imitated by those who were not willing to be trained in that\nparticular workshop and assist the workshop in profiting from its style. Every workshop had a model-book with drawings by the master and by\nthose masters of a particular stylistic lineage with which the workshop identified, from which the apprentices could copy (upon reusable surfaces), and this provided both a means of training and achieving stylistic consistency in large-scale collaborative works........\nA customer was interested above all in the style of a workshop, not in the work of a particular painter. Even if 14th century contracts specify that the painting should be from the master’s own hand, this does not mean what present-day collectors and connoisseurs would m e a n by that phrase. Harrison (1995: 79) writes:\nIt could be said that the concern to secure the master’s personal touch ... was not so much a condition under which Giotto himself worked ... as a long-term consequence of the skills demonstrated in such work as his and of the esteem accorded to those skills. ... Iftheconceptofastylisticpersonalityistomakeanysenseunderthoseconditions, w e will need to acknowledge that the skills m organization, instruction, and delegation must have been among the identifying qualities of the individual concerned.\n\n\n\nValue was increasingly seen as being created by individuals. The\nemphasis shifted from the master as the hub of a workshop to the workshop as an extension, an instrument in the hands of the master. Artists began to\ncreate works without previous commissions, expecting to find buyers who would desire their particular paintings. The crucial case is the often-cited\none of Michelangelo, and especially of Michelangelo according to Vasari,\nwhopaintedtheceilingoftheSistinechapelallbyhimself,or withonlyme-\nnial assistance, because his overpowering individuality did not allow him to delegate work to apprentices. Michelangelo also consistently denigrated the value of his o w n apprenticeship under Ghirlandaio. Even Vasari, in Michelangelo’s opinion, gave too much weight to this and Vasari felt it necessary to provide direct quotes from the contract of apprenticeship to substantiate this section of his text in the second edition of the Vite. In 1519,Francis I asked Michelangelo for a paintingbyhisown hand,even ifitwas\na very small one. In 1523 the Venetian cardinal Grimani wrote to him to re-\nmind him of his promise to produce something for him, leaving Michelangelo complete freedom to choose the subject, dimensions, and also whether it would be a statue or a painting.\"\n\nThe Accademia Del Disegno and the Art Industry\nCultural Dynamics March 1997 9: 5-16,", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349020461", "subreddit": "ArtHistory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "everything you've said is correct, in terms of pitch. However, B# major as a key would be quite awkward as it is a convention for all musical scales to have a note that is described with each letter A-G. A major scale has the stepwise pattern W W H W W W H, where W = whole step and H = half step. So the notes of the B# major scale would be B# C## D## E# F## G## A##. These denote the same class of frequencies as C D E F G A B, but notice how you have to use double sharps? It's an awkward way of expressing the C major scale. Musicians would hate you for transcribing a song in B# Major. It's just making it intentionally harder to read. It's something like making a powerpoint with a white background and highlighter yellow font color. Just do it in C Major instead.\n\nHowever, my beef with this graphic is with the element at 5 o'clock on the major circle, which says B#/Cb. It should say B/Cb. As a point of reference, notice the inner minor circle of fifths is just (well, it's supposed to be) a rotation of the outer major circle. B major and Cb major both might be used in transcribing music, with B major having 5 sharps and Cb having 7 flats, but B is more common in my experience.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349049247", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
