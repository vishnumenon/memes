In the key of C, this means the notes are C D E F G A B. When you transfer the same scale for into G, you get G A B C D E F#. Building chords on top you use the musical law that the first, fourth, and fifth steps are major chords. In my above diagram I had I ii iii IV V vi vii. The chords this translates into are G major, A minor, B minor, C major, D major, E minor, F# minor (diminished). So from here you already have the tools to tell a key. If a song has you play B major, A major, F# minor, and E major, the key is E major, because B is the fifth of E and it is a major chord, and A is the fourth of E and is also a major chord. If you want to know what that sounds like, the I IV V chord progression is VERY common. Think Louie Louie, Wild Thing, most punk songs.\n\nIn the progression you have, you have a G major, and a D major chord with an F# in the bass. This means it could either be in the key of G or D. If it were the key of D however, you would need to have an A major chord instead of a minor because A is the fifth of D. This means you are in G major. If you want a harmonica that is deeper than G, you would need to change the key of your song down.

{"body": "From the way you asked, I'm going to assume you know at least some of the very basics of music notation. I'm trying not to go into a very technical explanation (though I can try that if you prefer), but here goes.\n\nFundamentally, it's a matter of the function the note plays. \n\nFirst, you have to understand why you have sharps and flats in your key signature (that's the bit you have at the very beginning, right with the G clef). Imagine the typical C D E F G A B scale. That's a C Major scale. What characterises a scale (major, minor, etc) is how the notes line up. In a major key, the second degree is two semitones above the root (so in C major D is two semitones above C), and the fourth degree is five semitones above the root (F is five semitones above C), etc etc.\n\nIf you were in, say, F major you'd start writing at F, and you still want to use F G A B C D E F, but you need to make the intervals line up the same way. You want the second degree to be the same two semitones above, but G is already 2 semitones above F so that's ok. You want the fourth degree to be 5 semitones above, but that's an issue -- B is six semitones above, so you need to flatten (lower) it. Turns out everything else lines up nicely, so F Major is F G A B♭ C D E F. That's why you have one flat in the [F major key signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:F-major_d-minor.svg).\n\nNow that single flats in the key signature are out of the way, let's talk about incidental single flats in the middle of the score. A major chord is when you play something like root, major third, fifth together. A minor chord is when  you play root, minor third, fifth. Then there's other chords, like diminished minors, etc. But those don't matter right now.\n\nIf you look at how the scales are structured, some chords occur naturally in the scales: C E G is the C major chord, and E G B is the E minor chord. If you wanted to to write a C minor chord, you'd write C Eb G -- notice how C D# G would be the exact same notes, but instead of saying \"lower the third degree\" (which is consistent with going from major to minor third), D# would  say \"raise the second degree\". That's not at all what we meant!\n\nSo, double sharps/flats. Hopefully, you're now starting to see why they might happen. Let's go back to F major. F, G, A, B♭, C, D, E, F. Our F major chord is F A C. The G Major chord is G B♭ D. But in the context of F Major, if we want to write G Minor, like we said before, we don't want to say G A D. A is the second step starting from G. We want the third step, and we want it flattened. G B♭♭ D is born.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n**EDIT**: I just realised that I borked the example, and that G B♭ D is actually the G minor chord (B♭ being three semitones away from G), so that's *not* a place where you'd find a double flat. An example that does work is A♭ minor (A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭). C♭ E♭ G♭ is the C♭ Major chord, whereas C♭ E♭♭ G♭ is C♭ minor.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349127005", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

Ok here they are, you found them.  Know them like the back of your hand.  Now how to start?  I always loved this video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_qw03-3gFg&amp;feature=related\nYou need to know what key your in so you know what scale to use.  So make sure you're paying attention to that.\n\nok note:  the major scale consists of 7 notes.  Let's keep it simple, in order we'll call them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (and then the scale repeats the notes in the next octave).  In the key of C this would be C D E F G A B (all the white keys on a piano).\n\n  Now, the pentatonic major scale has the following same notes 1 2 3 5 6 (C D E G A in the key of C Major respectively).  It only have 5 total notes hence the name PENTatontic.  Essentially it is the same scale but the 4th, 6th, 7th notes in the major scale are skipped.  Why is this?  Those notes are used more as passing tones as they aren't generally part of the chord being played so they don't harmonize as well and have a somewhat dissonant sound (if that's what your going for good).  In a nutshell the notes in the major scale that are left out are more to be considered what they call 'passing tones'.  You don't hang on these notes.  They're more for moving to other notes, usually in the pentatonic scale which harmonize a little better.  \n\nFinal note, the notes in the major chord that harmonize well with a major chord are 1 3 and 5.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349131668", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

A semitone lower and you have an A which fits in the scale, and a semitone higher you have a B. Those kind of *accident*als add a flavour and colour to your solos even if they were made by *accident*.\n\nThat is basically the least theoretical approach and the best way for dealing with mistakes. Other than that, try and play whatever you hear in your head. Is the pattern ascending? Then play the notes upwards in the scale as to how each interval sounds.\n\nI'm pretty new to improv myself, and I can by no means hear something and immediately know what to play but that will come by practice. Just play your scales, then play them in different intervals so you know how every note sounds and practice.\n\nAfter you've done all that practice some more and then have a practice.

{"body": "Ugh, my mother. This all happened over an 8 year period.\n\nShe'd gotten out of prison (which is a whole other story by itself) &amp; moved into the spare bedroom in the house where I lived with my grandma. So she moves into the spare room and my grandma (who is not well off, we were basically able to comfortably get by and sometimes get a little something more, like a new outfit or go eat out somewhere, never anything big) pays for all the food &amp; utilities &amp; gives her some spending money so she can buy her own clothes, pay for her cigarettes, ect. for awhile thinking she'd get a job soon and then help out. \n\nNot exactly. \n\nShe not only doesn't get a job, but now having everything paid for, FOR her (including a car, which we told her not to buy because it wasn't in the best condition &amp; keeping it running would be more expensive than it was worth) wasn't enough, she wanted her own spending money, like $50 dollars every week. So she was basically eating use out of house and home because she paid for nothing and on top of that she was a b r a t. Stay out all day &amp; then come home at like 2 in the morning &amp; not even trying to be quiet and then staying up and additional 2 or 3 more hours in her room (which was right next to mine) listening to music AND playing a movie AND talking on the phone like she was a teenager and basically being the most inconsiderate and entitled brat she could. When living with her became so unbearable, my grandma literally bought a house for her to live in (where all the bills were paid for and it was furnished with the necessities and everything) and it still didn't help because she had a key to out house, so when she was done trashing her house and eating all her food with her meth addicted boyfriend and his burnout kids that she let move in, she'd come back over to our house and act the same as she did when she lived with us. \n\nWe put pressure on her a lot over the time before she ever even got her house to get a job and she would throw fits about how hard it is for an ex- con to find a job. She would scream at my grandma and get in her face and sometimes raise her hand to my grandma and then storm out and not come back over for a few days until she needed more money. Never apologized. Ever. At this point my grandma tried to avoid her at any point and switched between trying to stay away for the house as long as possible to never leaving the house. We'd been living off my grandma's retirement and savings and my grandma was in debt because my mom had bled her bank account dry so we had to cut her off. My grandma had been avoiding cutting her off because she was afraid of her, so when we had no choice but to cut her off, we knew she'd explode. We were right. There was a huge fight where I had to get in between my mom and my grandma &amp; my mom tried to strangle me &amp; the cops were called and it was a big huge mess. We changed the locks and the doors were only unlocked long enough to get through the doorway and going outside was only out of necessity. I stayed home a lot because grandma was afraid to be home alone and I sometimes had to walk her to and from her car because my mom would try to ambush her whenever she got home or was going to leave. My grandma was basically run out because a few short months later, she moved away to live closer to her son and I moved in with my boyfriend. \n\nThe kicker? After we kicked her out to her own house and started muscling her out of our lives, she liked to scream and throw fits and rage about how bad we treated her.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349230943", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

For example \"our financial growth doubled, I increased revenue by 25%, I increased productivity and with my skills in x y z I expanded our partnerships with the following companies\" you need to tailor this to your skills, accomplishments and expertise.

I will let you know if I think of anything else.\n\nEdit: I also wanted to add the following. It is better to describe your job role in the cv and explain your accomplishments in the letter. If you carefully examine your letter you will realise that you are describing your role (almost like in your cv) and you are giving no further details of who you are. Write your specialties in analysis, multi-tasking, organisation or whatever you deem is good for your job and give examples of accomplishments (not job description). \n\nAlso I would advertise you as a professional financial analyst with x years of experience in the sector instead of saying \"I have x years of experience with this company.

Chances are, a large enough air bullble isn't going to case the demise of you rpiece.\n\nI'd bet cash money though, that the broken pieces are made of \"soft glass\" - aka soda lime glass. And, not to give soda lime glass a bad name, I would also venture to guess that those exploded pieces were not handmade by an artisan, but purchased though a shop or on line company. I would also postulate that what killed them were in internal weaknesses found in all glass, because they were very likely not properly annealed. \n\nI say this because, from what I've seen, these \"thick wall\" soda lime pieces seem to break easily and quickly. This is due to the internal streses created in the glass when the unit was in the flame being made. Glass heats &amp; cools during this process, sometimes a little too much (shattering the piece before it is complete) and sometimes the heat distributes enough to keep the immediate shattering down. \n\nAnnealing, in the case of glass, is a process whereby the finished item is placed in a heated kiln. An artist may place multiple items in the kiln, then, once it is full. set the kiln temp to a certain setting, allow the glass to \"soak\" or to sit at the high temp just below melting, then the kiln is s l o w l y \"ramped down\" meaning the temperature is reduced over many hours. Next morning, glass artist look in the kiln and removes cool new STURDY pieces. \n\nDoes that help?

She started watching it, and it was called \"Lost Girl.\"\n\nWell, when that show started going into it's story, the lead character (who is incredibly smoking HOT by the way) was a damn Succubus!  When I heard that, I about shit my pants, and the biggest damn grin I've ever had, hit my face. I was expecting to just dream of one, or see a picture through something silly on the internet, but this was even better.  It turned out to be one of her favorite shows, and she watched about every episode.\n\nThe other sigils I had created were for Magic Mushrooms and LSD, two things that I had wanted to partake of again for many years in the running, but never could really find them.\n\nWeeks later, at a family gathering, one of my wife's distant cousins started up a chat and we were talking about Burning Man, and psychedelics came up, naturally.

I'll probably use that instead, if I ever decide I want to play Maplestory again.\n\nEDIT: \nFun fact: You can rebind ctrl/alt in most games, who woulda thunk it?

Such g a r b a g e.\n\nEighth, there were considerably more stunts in TDKR (than TDK) which were utterly implausible/rendered stupid dog shit consequently.\n\nNinth, \"Talia\" is in like 20 total minutes (tops) of a 150 minute movie.  She's the mastermind-villain.  wat.  Also, she's a woman and therefore not a viable super-villain.  Sorry ladies, you suck cock well but you suck at being villains.\n\nTenth, there are so many scenes where villains have automatic weapons versus unarmed people and the automatic weapons achieve an accuracy ratio of ~0.05%.  I've never shot a gun in my life and I'm damn near certain I'd shoot at least 10%.\n\nEleventh, Batman's rehab/PT should've been documented MUCH better.  His reinauguration/break from retirement should've featured training of some sort.  We go from one scene where he's walking with a cane and pissing in bottles to him scaling stories of a building, wat?  Then in prison, his push-ups and sit-ups (which it looked like he did maybe 10 of each) were enough to realign his vertebrae (with the help of some random prison inmate who can reset vertebrae by punching them [LOL..]).\n\nTwelfth, the whole \"people's court\" concept was utterly fucking stupid.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Honestly, that's not carnage at all.  It's stupid.  Bane is such a shitty fucking fanboy wannabe villain.\n\nThirteenth, Catwoman is a pointless character.  She appears in scenes where she utters a one-liner or looks like a seductress (which she is).  Where's the depth?  Where's the character building?  She disappears for long periods of time throughout the movie, as does Batman.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, Nolan should've started TDKR with some sort of follow-up from TDK.  The shitty Dent Act conference did very little to establish the state of the Joker, Batman, and everything else.\n\nAnd Bane/Batman never bruise despite throwing haymakers at each other.  Nolan took a page out of Michael Bay's book.\n\nLOVED TDK/BB.  So let down by TDKR.  Fanboy of Batman, \"son i am disappoint @ TDKR\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349550633", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Each set of numbers is 8 bytes, or 64 bits (a hex digit is 4 bits and there are 16 of them).\n\nSo, you know how you have 10 fingers?  So when you count, you go 0 fingers, 1 finger, 2 fingers, ..., 9 fingers, and then you add another digit and go to 10?  So there are 10 different digits?  Well, in base 16, there are 16 different digits!  Instead of making up new symbols, they use A B C D E F.  So when you count in base 16, you go:\n\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11, 12, ..., 1D, 1E, 1F, 20, 21, ..., 2F, 30, 31, ..., 3F, 40...\n\nSo A is what we know as 10, 20 is what we know as 32, and 100 is what we know as 256.  A bit confusing.  Now, computers can only understand whether something is on or off.  A switch can be on or off, and when we use numbers to represent that, they're 0's and 1's.  That switch is called a bit.  A hex digit is like putting four switches next to each other.  There are 16 ways to have those four switches: 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111.  Each of those gets its own hex digit, from 0 to F.  So if you put 16 hex digits together, that's like putting 64 little switches together.\n\nNow, I have NO IDEA what they *mean*.  Modern computers are usually 64-bit, meaning that you name a spot in memory using 64 bits (older computers used fewer bits).  So each of those could be a number, and that number could be a spot in memory.  I really don't know.

Here's how.\n\n    o o o o o o o o o\n    o o o o o o o o o\n    o o o o o o o o o\n    o o o o o o o o o\n\nImagine those are the steel molecules, arranged in a pattern to form the steel bar. Obviously there are a lot more of them, but we're looking at the microscopic scale now. Now, you apply your push from the left side, and the following happens:\n\n      ooo o o o o o o\n      ooo o o o o o o\n      ooo o o o o o o\n      ooo o o o o o o\n\nThe molecules bunch up, temporarily getting closer together. They don't want that, though, that's not a stable system, they just want to go back to their original state. So a wave starts propagating through the system.\n\n      o o o ooo o o o\n      o o o ooo o o o\n      o o o ooo o o o\n      o o o ooo o o o\n\nAfter a very short while, your bar looks like this. Note that , yes, it is smaller than before! That's because the molecules are bunched up more than they would otherwise be!\n\n      o o o o o o ooo\n      o o o o o o ooo\n      o o o o o o ooo\n      o o o o o o ooo\n\nThe wave reaches the end of the steel bar...\n\n      o o o o o o o o o\n      o o o o o o o o o\n      o o o o o o o o o\n      o o o o o o o o o\n\nAnd the normal pattern is resumed, just shifted a little bit from the original position. All substances do this. It is the easiest to see in, for example, jelly, because the wave propagates VERY slowly. But the more rigid an object is, the faster these kinds of waves move. Compression waves in steel, being very rigid, move extremely fast.\n\nSo yes, it shrinks, but very temporarily. That's just due to the force you apply bunching up the molecules.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349694501", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I can relate to a lot of it.  My anxiety isn't constant for years, but I have very debilitating periods that last for three months at a time and let up for a few weeks, then get intense again.   Its frustrating because I am bright and creative but my memory is poor too, and I can't speak to defend much of my work.  (I'm a design student).  \n\nI've found the most important thing for me is maintaining contact with people even if I feel stupid or ill.  I am part of a student group that meets once a week at the same time and I often feel it is the only thing that keeps me holding on or feeling normal.  I actually run the group, so I can't easily make an excuse not to go.  Having that level of responsibility is also good for my social anxiety, if I feel I can't connect with people well there are some stock questions I can ask people and busy work I can do to keep my distance.\n\nI also have a lot of anxiety regarding holding a job. It stems from feeling I will be a waste of a human if I can't work, and I won't be able to pay my bills x y z I might as well die etc.  I have since learned that my anxiety is severe enough that it is worth it to pursue disability status and get some support for when I am too sick to work.  It is very, very hard to start down that path, but it has helped me immensely, and helped me find and accept work that accommodates my anxiety .... mainly because I enjoy and care about my job, and I am needed by my employer as much as I need them.  I can say I need a moment or get someone to fill in for me without worry of judgement or feeling like I'm a piece of trash.  \n\nIn the meantime i am pursuing cognitive behavioural therapy.  I operate as if I believe i will be anxious with increasing severity for the rest of my life (my physical symptoms get worse as the years go on), but since getting help and working hard to take care of myself and identify my needs and not being afraid to say \"I need this kind of help\", I have gotten significantly better and been able to achieve more success than I ever thought I could.\n\nI do not take medication except for the occasional ativan.  I am willing to take medication (and sometimes I have had to) temporarily, to get me through an especially bad time.  Usually it is for six months at  time.\n\nIt is a long, hard journey.  I am on my phone on a bus so it is hard to sum up this post.  I know if I am anxious and my memory is especially bad it is easy to feel as if my life had been one endless nightmare, but I know it is just my perception.  I try to accept constant terror as a fact of life, you are not alone.  But I have small hope that with more hard work on this journey I am on, it will not always be that way.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1349745880", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Therefore, he knows that his hat is white and calls it.  4) #3 knows that #2-#10 should have an even number of white hats out of nine.  He sees four white hats in front of him, and #2 behind him has called white; therefore he must wear a white hat to even it out.  He calls white.  5) #4 is also keeping track.  He too sees four white hats in front of him, but knows there are two white hats behind him.  Since his being white would make the count odd, he must be wearing a black hat, and calls it.

I love cheap thrills and overcoming obstacles that may hurt for a little while but then emerging supreme.\nIt has got absolutely zero to do with me personally, it is just the inevitable evolution of transhumanism. Just like we'll cure cancer because it's not optimal for us, we'll get rid of emotions that affect us negatively. \n\nAs for your idiotic \"appeal to authority\", it was not an appeal to authority at all. A simple fact check to see if you are worth spending time on discussing these matters as it seems the deepest you've gone into the books is Michio Kaku. Which is like reading Lil Wayne on your way to understanding Goethe's in poetry. You got a way to go, that's all. \n\nAnd no, far from a geek. I was actually never a geek, I was the popular \"I don't care about school\" guy who just happened to realize that \"hey, learning is fucking awesome when you are not forced to by teachers\". \nI have no problems connecting with people, infact I am in a polymoric relationship with 2 girls. This is obviously ego-soothing aswell as deeper emotions, so no I have no problem with my \"primitive emotions\", but I manage to stay objective and see that while fucking 2 hot girls at the same time is awesome, it'll be NOTHING compared to the distant future. Sex will probably be something completley else, something we cannot even begin to phatom. \n\nIt's like the problem of safe AGI, how do we know it'll be friendly? It'll have an IQ of 10 000 within just a few generations (days). How can we possibly predict what a super genius intelligence is going to do? We can't. So skynet etc. is actually a very real possibility, because we cannot even imagine the problem we are trying to solve...\n\nAnd to your last point, which I've already replied to twice without you grasping what I am conveying, so pay close attention this time:\nThere is a huge difference between watching a fake movie, book or whatever without a happy ending and experiencing an ACTUAL reality.\nJust because the reality takes place in a simulation does not make it less real.\nIf the emotions and loss is 100% identical in the simulation as it would be in a \"natural universe\", then it is philosophically indistinguishable.\nNoone would be watching horror movies if they felt the ACTUAL horror and thought it was 100% real. \nWe are animals living in a \"civillized society\", we have these urges and instincts that make us want these things because driving around in a SUV, living the 9 to 5 lifestyle is B O R I N G compared to hunting animals with cheetas on the savanna in Africa while fearing that a flock of lions will kill you. \nIt's all stimulation... It's the same reason ADHD'ers seek thrill, their brain is way less active than a \"normal person\" brain, so they constantly seek interesting things to keep their brain active (google brain scans of ADHD vs normal people).\nOnce there is a permanent solution to this, they will no longer do this.\n\nSo now, imaging far into the future, say year 2500. We have colonized the solar system, we have transcended biology and are now living as immortals. We can simulate ANY environment we want with ANY sort of cosmological constant. Different gravities. Faster than light signalling etc. If we were still seeking cheap thrills, we'd be doing it in AWESOME virtual themeparks on Mars.\nBut it's way more likely that their means of entertaining themselves will be way more noble and interesting than what we do today.\n\nYou can already see this trend. The more educated and advanced people get, the more they like to participate in REAL stuff. Think deep and meaningful thoughts. \n\nIs it possible that you are living in a simulation and I am only a projection from some futuristic computer?

{"body": "I'm going to expand on the excellent reply that spredoj posted, as there is a lot of depth to hip-hop and rap that's not always displayed in the popular songs.\n\nThis will be a long one, so buckle up.\n****\n\nRap, and really all music in general, can summed up with a sole purpose. An artist will produce something to try to convey ideas and information in hopes that it will trigger a response from a listener. The ultimate goal is for that response (be it emotional or otherwise) to be strong enough that it makes like the listener persue an action. The response could be as simple as feeling sad when listening to a love song. On the other end, the response could be so strong that it changes your political views, which would ultimately effect your entire life from that point on. \n\nThe degree of the response is totally unique to each person, but the artist intentionally does certain things to try to guide the listener to that certain response.\n\nThe message is ultimately defined by:\n\n\n* What the artist says (Lyrics and Message)\n* Why the artist is saying it (Emotion and Passion)\n* How the artist says it (Flow, Delivery, and Rhyme Structure)\n* The background music (The Beat)\n\n****\n\n**1. What the artist says**\n\nThe lyrical content and message of the song is where popular music and what a lot would consider \"real\" hip-hop and rap differ greatly. Popular hip-hop and rap songs less frequently have good lyrics that convey a certain message. They are mostly written for the intent to sell records and get plays in the club. \"Good\" lyrics usually convey a strong message or paint an excellent story. \n\nA blatantly obvious comparison:\n\n&gt;J Kwon - Hood Hop\n\n&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYyNxm_vNKA\n\n&gt;Now I wish a nigga would run up like that\n\n&gt;Man I put that on the hood I'mma strike back\n\n&gt;And niggas talk shit but I don't like that\n\n&gt;Sayin all like Gee but I ain't write that\n\n&gt;And maybe mamma's man ain't about shit\n\n&gt;Basically what I'm sayin dude fuck a bitch\n\nvs\n\n&gt;Lupe Fiasco - Words I Never Said\n\n&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22l1sf5JZD0\n\n&gt;I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit\n\n&gt;Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets\n\n&gt;How much money does it take to really make a full clip\n\n&gt;9/11 building 7 did they really pull it\n\n&gt;Uhh, And a bunch of other cover ups\n\n&gt;Your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts\n\n&gt;If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut\n\n&gt;The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up\n\nThe funny part is Hood Hop probably sold MANY more records simply because it has a good beat (covered later) and a catchy hook. The whole song doesn't \"say\" anything aside from promoting J Kwon as a gangster. Nothing wrong with going that route, it's just a completely different approach to Lupe Fiasco, who uses his song to educate his fans about various different global issues and \"conspiracies\". \n\nA lot of people take lyrics at a very low level, which is why popular songs are popular. Few actually take the time to understand the depth of certain lines that make cultural references or include wordplay and metaphors.\n\nUnderground hip-hop and rap usually has extremely well crafted lyrics, but don't have the mass market appeal because people don't understand the references. \n\nPrime example:\n&gt;Childish Gambino - Bonfire\n\n&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1B_r9nC9k\n\n&gt;Okay, it’s Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ\n\n&gt;Move white girls like there’s coke up my asscrack\n\n&gt;Move black girls cause, man, fuck it, I’ll do either\n\n&gt;I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA\n\n&gt;In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me\n\n&gt;My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery\n\n&gt;This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef\n\n&gt;My dick is like an accent mark, it’s all about the over E's\n\nThere is almost a metaphor, double entendre, and/or cultural reference PER bar in that song. I counted 8+ in just the lines I quoted above.\n\nAn excellent resource to find out WHAT the lyrics really mean if you didn't catch a reference is **http://rapgenius.com/**\n\nIt's an awesome community driven lyric site that allows users to add notes to the lyrics to help explain them. Super useful.\n\n****\n**2. Why the artist is saying it (Emotion and Passion)**\n\nThis plays a big role how much response if generated from the listener. Simply put, if the artist makes the song with raw passion and emotion, it translates extremely well to the listener. If the artist simply makes a \"club banger\" for money and profit, it might sell well, but won't evoke the same feeling that a trained hip-hop fan gets when they listen to a good song.\n\nExample:\n\n&gt;Eminem - Not Afraid\n\n&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5-yKhDd64s\n\n&gt;Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap\n\n&gt;I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap\n\n&gt;You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that\n\n&gt;Fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped\n\n&gt;And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back\n\n&gt;I promise to never go back on that promise\n\n&gt;In fact, Let's be honest\n\n&gt;That last \"Relapse\" CD was ehhh\n\n&gt;Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground\n\nYou can just feel Eminem's emotion in that song, and in the part I quoted, he's talking to himself in the first half debating with his conscience, and then apologizes to his fans for putting out a previous album he now regrets. Not only is he delivering something he has a strong emotional connection to, he does so with an incredible rhyme scheme and flow. THAT's what makes a good artist.\n\n****\n**3. How the artist says it (Flow, Delivery, and Rhyme Structure)**\n\nThis is one the things that experienced hip-hop fans appreciate most, but one of the hardest things to pick up on when first starting out. Don't get discouraged if you can't hear or experience what other's are when first starting out.\n\nYou need to train your ear to actively recognize and pick out the patterns, and it takes a couple years to really get it tuned correctly. If you took one of us and made us listen to Broadway, we wouldn't really be able to pick out what's \"good\" or \"bad\", or the specific parts that may generate a strong response when you listen to it.\n\nFlow is a very vague term, as it's commonly used to describe the overall style and/or skill level of a rapper or certain verse. Essentially \"Flow\" is how well the rapper's verse \"fits\" into the beat. It's not really definable, but it has to do with the Rappers rhyme cadence and how that sounds integrated with the beat. You can notice it on songs with multiple artists rapping about the same topic. They are mostly saying the same thing, but have unique and different flows. I like to think Flow is a combination of how the rapper DELIVERS his LYRICS and RHYME STRUCTURE on a certain BEAT. You grade flow by just how good it naturally sounds, and if the rhyme structure, pattern, cadence and delivery all fit together nicely.\n\nDelivery is HOW the Rapper actually says the words. Slow or fast paced? High or low pitched? Strong or weak emphasis? Focus on the rhymes or the message? You can say the word \"Hat\" a million different ways in a million different tones, and why, what, and how you choose to say it is all part of the delivery.\n\nRhyme Structure is a very important part of rap and hip-hop, and it defines when and what you rhyme per \"bar\". It's the rhythm of the rhymes given the amount of syllables you say per \"line\".\n\nExamples:\n\n&gt;Went on Reddit to look at some pictures of cats\n\n&gt;Ended up seeing bunnies with pancakes as hats\n\nVery simple rhyme structure, being a 12 syllable line with the last syllable being the word rhymed.\n\nYou could type it out like so:\n\n&gt;x x x x x x x x x x x A\n\n&gt;x x x x x x x x x x x A\n\nNow if we want to increase the number of syllables we rhyme per line, or start using multi-syllable rhyming (multis) that would change the rhyme structure, and also change our delivery to fit as well.\n\n&gt;Went on Reddit to look at some pictures of cats\n\n&gt;Sent a reply, hoped it took a lot quicker than that\n\nThis is much more complex scheme, although not perfect (I just pulled it off the top of my head as I wrote it), but we are rhyming many more syllables in this rhyme structure.\n\n&gt; WENT on reddit to LOOK at some PICTURES-OF-CATS\n\n&gt; SENT a reply, hoped it TOOK a lot QUICKER-THAN-THAT\n\nThis could be represented like so:\n\n&gt;A x x x x B x x CC-x-D\n\n&gt;A x x x x B x x CC-x-D\n\nWe changed from rhyming only the last end syllable, to 5 syllables through each line. If you tried to \"rap\" it, you'll notice the later rhyme structure sounds better phonetically and gives you that \"Flow\". \n\nTo really understand a rapper's flow, you almost have to attempt to write a rap yourself.

{"body": "It took a L O T of games, I've played well over 300 games as support, I can give some tips though.\n\nFirst, if you choose to main support, you need a backup role. Specialize in something else, you won't always get support so you do need a second role. I personally went with mid, as it allowed me to still play Janna. Specializing in one or two champions also helps you out a ton. Don't worry so much about counter picks, if you are an extremely skilled Janna player and you go up against a mediocre \"counter\" leona player, you can very easily dominate her.\n\nSecond, you have to keep the map warded. All of it. Ward the SHIT out of the map, place them constantly in key points. I've gone 35 minute games with just shurelya's, HOG, and mobo boots because I spent tons on wards. \n\nThird, encourage your team. Keep everyone positive, you can win even if it seems impossible. I can assure you that you'll see the enemy team throw the game easily. Just yesterday the enemy ezreal, after our team was aced twice in team fights, decided to stay alone at our base trying to break it. As soon as we spawned, I shurelya -&gt; flash slowed him and that allowed the rest of my team to catch up to him, finish him off, a quick baron and then push for the finish.\n\nFourth, you need to keep your carry alive. As bad as they may seem, even if they're horrible at the game, keep them alive, encourage them, give them tips. I've had a 0/8 tristana come back and actually destroy their team and finish with a positive score. All it takes is encouragement.\n\nFifth, acknowledge your OWN mistakes. Yes, other people will make mistakes, but your own mistakes are more important. When you die, ask yourself \"What could I have done differently that would have changed the outcome of that fight?\", when you manage a kill, re-evaluate it to see if you could have done it better. Improve your skill, and your elo will improve with it.\n\nI hope that's enough for you, and good luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350056095", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok dude im here to get serious! The link you posted it \"simple, self replicating molecules\" is full of MAY HAVES, MIGHT HAVES, COULD HAVES and hypothesis' \n\nLet me post what I have researched that corrects that mis-information.\n\nFrom journals I have read about DNA it is very complex. But before I get into that, I would like to preface my thought with DNA coding being a form of higher information. As DNA controls all the processes in the living organism. The fact information is present shows there has to be a higher from of life that \"wrote\" or \"programmed\" the coding. More on that later.\n\nBeside the experiment in 1953' by Dr. Stanley Miller trying to spark a bunch of gasses to produce some basic amino acids that could have lead to life. The fact of the matter is he only produce a few amino acids. They have never in any experiment found that nucleotides where ever present in their findings. Nucleotides are different then amino acids and is also just as important for life, they are smaller and more complex then RNA molecules.  Scientists have never ever found evidence of a self replicating RNA molecule randomly assembling in some pool of chemical building blocks. The consensus is minuscule, for that to actually take place, in the wild would take \"luck\". Luck is not what science is built on.\n\nNext protein molecules they are made up of as few as 50 or several hundred amino acids bound together not randomly but in a specific order, some say highly specific order. The average functional protein in a simple cell contains 200 amino acids bound in a specific order.  The chance of having some protein with only 100 amino acids in the right sequences, form on earth has been calculated as one in millions-billion.\n\nYet you need protein to create RNA Hubert P Yockey a scientist says its is impossible to think that proteins came before the RNA, because you need RNA to create the proteins.\n\n**Now on to DNA**\n\nFor a cell to survive you need RNA, DNA and proteins. How can life come about when you cannot lack even one of those they all need to be present? Like I said about DNA is a high form of information, instruction. This high form of information just happens to have its own alphabet A T G C ,\"words\"(condons) that form \"sentence structures\"(stories). The average gene has 27,000 letters that happen to complied themselves logically in \"chapters\" of sorts (chromosomes) and it takes 23 chromosomes to make a book. Would a \"book\" this complex really have no author?\n\nThis is all on top of the fact only certain letters of the genetic \"alphabet\" will go together G-C, A-T that's it! Where did the instruction for how DNA behaves come from? Trial and error hopefully over a few billion of years? Again you need DNA, RNA and proteins to make a basic cell for life.\n\nLook at how DNA is packed in the most efficient way possible mankind with our science cannot even touch the efficiency of DNA for even something as simple as computer storage. DNA can hold more information then a trillion cd's in the space smaller then the human eye can see. Look at how it is packed each chromosome is actually a long strings of DNA spun in loops the loops also are packed on coils are the right intervals for efficiency. The packing is a marvel of engineering efficiency itself. Again this takes instruction obviously of an higher order seeing we cannot duplicate this even close.\n\nWhat about the organic \"machines\" for a lack of a better word. These specialized organic \"machines\" unpack the DNA with out damaging it, \"unzip\" the two sides, replicate BOTH sides with the exact opposite of the relevant letter G-C, A-T, with no error!! Another specialized organic \"machine\" is the transcription machine. It unwinds the DNA reads it passes the information on to the RNA. The DNA tells the RNA where to start and where to stop the reading for the information depending on what protein needs to be made. Do you really think this could have come about by chance?\n\nOk let me finish off by saying this is like but beside all this complexity within the organisms, life, or the human body. Look at all the things that needed to come together from the universe, to our solar system. The earth is in the right solar system for life. Our universe is not close to the center of the galaxy where there is a massive black hole. We are in what some have called the galactic habitable zone.\n\nOur sun is the right kind for life it isn't to massive, or too small. It isn't a red or dying star, it puts out the right kind of light for life. \n\n**THE EARTH**\n\nThe earth is the right size not to large to affect life, not to small that it doesn't have enough gravity. The earth is not to close to the sun or too far but in the right zone for life. The tilt is just right 23.5 degrees\nthat results in annual cycle of seasons, moderates temperatures, and enables a wide range of climate zones. The rotation is not to fast or too slow\n\nWhat about the moon it is the right size, and distance. Could these thing come about by chance? Without the moon the earth spin would be a wobble, that could leave the earth tipped over on its side. How could this all just happen by chance?\n\n**ATOMIC LEVELS**\n\nLets go down to the atomic level. The laws underlying these forces appear to have been fine-tuned in such a way as to produce a universe capable of supporting life. “Changing the existing laws by even a scintilla could have lethal consequences,” according to Paul Davies. For example, if protons were slightly heavier than neutrons, rather than slightly lighter as they are, all protons would have turned into neutrons. Would that have been so bad? “Without protons and their crucial electric charge,” explains Davies, “atoms could not exist.”\n\nThe electromagnetic force attracts electrons to protons, allowing molecules to form. If this force were significantly weaker, electrons would not be held in orbit around the nucleus of an atom, and no molecules could form. If, on the other hand, this force were much stronger, electrons would be stuck to the nucleus of an atom. In that case, chemical reactions and life would simply be impossible.\nA slight difference in the electromagnetic force would affect the sun and the solar energy that reaches our earth. Such a difference could easily make photosynthesis in plants difficult or impossible. So the precise strength of the electromagnetic force determines whether life on earth is possible or not.\n\nPicture this illustration visualize an explorer’s visit to an imaginary “control room for the whole universe.” There, the explorer observes rows and rows of dials that can be set to any value, and he learns that each has to be calibrated to a precise setting in order for life to be possible. One dial sets the strength of the force of gravity, one the strength of electromagnetic attraction, another the ratio between the mass of the neutron and the proton, and so on. As the explorer examines these numerous dials, he sees that they could have been set to different values. It also becomes clear to him, after meticulous calculation, that even a small change in any one of the dial settings would modify the architecture of the cosmos in such a way that life in it would cease to exist. Yet, each dial is set to precisely the right value needed to keep the universe running and habitable. What should the visitor deduce about how the dials came to be set the way they are?\n\nWith all this evidence for a fine tuned, precise intricately designed things that make up life, I cannot with reason think that all this just came about. What the evolutionist, atheist understanding or focus on one thing evolution, but even that isn't follow all considered as I pointed out information and instruction of a higher order comes into play in to many parts of life to be dismissed. And that is just on life it self when you add in all the rest about the solar system, earth, and atomic level things that play a large part life coming about by evolution in zero.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350073518", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"Let me see, who lost the debate\"?\n(Posted 10-12-2012) – Article on VP Debate Win or Loss?\nHere is my take on the evening that I have not heard talked about yet, I believe! There are a ton of different types of strategies out there for one thing or another and debates are no different. Since the senior dems of the \"O\" campaign had to step in and get the rust out of Biden (as it took apparently six weeks to do so), then I am of the belief that more than likely they \"COULD NOT\" get Joe to stick to a message during any of their prep time and consequently they threw up their hands and said, just \"LET JOE BE JOE\", because lets face it, 1). We can't tell him anything, because he would not or could not do it anyway's, or 2). Even know how to stick to a message that is always changing , or 3). Their strategy all along \"WAS\" to marginalize the office of VP itself, thus to disrupt, create baffonery and keep focus always on Joe no matter what, especially when talking about admin. record. In taking this type of strategy, it allowed this so called current sitting VP (a heartbeat away from the top job) to act like this total baffoon I speak of, because they already knew how it would play out in the publics eye - \"DISTRACTION\". In taking this tact, take a look at what it accomplished. Because \"ALL\" know full well that Joe Biden is more of a coctail joke rather than a VP, by his being \"JOE\", they stole the complete limelight away from what was supposed to be a substative issue evening, on points from the administrations handling of the economy and jobs to Libya etc. By taking this strategy tact, take a look at what many are only talking about, \"joe being joe\", instead of what the evening was supposed to be about, which was to be a lot more serious than this clown \"allowed\" it to be. This meant in essance, that Joe played to his kook minions because they (meaning the looney leftists) seem to love making mockery of the Presidential and VP offices, plus they knew full well that if Ryan was able to take any form of control or gain ground using the real facts, it would be all over for Joe and for the \"O\" as well.\nInstead, what really happened is folks are talking about Joe being an idiot, accepting it like \"OH WELL IT'S JUST JOE\", which somehow is supposed to excuse the baffoonery Joe (I believe) was purposely perpetuating, as if it was no big deal. Just take a look at how Jay Carney has walked back much of what Joe has said, plus Jay's justification and spin for such action as \"Joe being Joe\", again as if we are supposed to accept this type of behavior for any debate let alone for the office of President or VP. And the Dems knew this going into this so called debate. I believed they set it up to be this way or close to it, and unfortunately Uncle Joe plays this role all too well, and what's worse, is glad to do it too! Go figure that one out! \"Yes I want to look like a baffon in front of millions of people\". \"Yes I can take one for the \"O\" Team, since my boss could not handle it\"!\nObviously common sense would dictate for the evening (that is if any \"O\" and Biden supporters actually had any), then they too would be questioning why this baffoon was smiling and laughing during discussions such as Libya and the loss of four Americans, and lying in front of millions of viewers about the attack itself, or his condescending tone and head shaking, talking over Ryan, and total disrespect while discussing the seriousness of things such as Medicare, and many other subjects Americans wanted to hear about for the evening not to mention the complete lack of respect for his office, Congressman Ryan, or all the people viewing. In this strategy, Joe did not care, nor did the Dems, nor the minions watching this very embarrassing performance, after all to them \"JOE DID FANTASTIC\" - \"REALLY\"!!!!. After all in their minds, what's the big deal about VP debates anyway's. Why can't we all just have fun for the evening, and allow for a total distraction away from the true highly important issues facing this nation right now. What's the big deal, I can hear these idlots say.\nInstead virtually all of America should be asking themselves, \"how can they even think about trusting this Biden character who is just one job away from the most important position in the land, to take issues like Iran, or N.Korea etc seriously. How can \"any\" American say this person would \"EVER\" be able to work across the isle with Republicans or other Democrats, when he needs to compromise, which lets face it, is a \"MUST\" for anyone in that office. Most certainly \"O\" stopped trying after one year, so what makes anyone think that \"UNCLE JOE\" and his demeanor and attitudes towards serious subjects this evening would ever get anywhere, and if not, then why would you want to waste your vote for the next four years on these two \"BAFFOONS\" currently in office. Why in blue-blazes would anyone want to give these guys another four years of this crap.\n\n They (meaning Dem. leadership, Joe himself and more than likely the \"O\" himself) used the evenings event to promote the continued lies, disception and overall change the face of the event itself, and put all talking points on Joe's baffonery rather than on the real issues or \"DEAD AMERICANS\", or how about current terrorists today and still growing.\nLets face it, what will American's remember about the 2012 election and related debates other than the complete and utter negativity unparralled in our nations history to date. \nWill they remember \"O\"s performance in his first debate with Romney, no! Will they remember the \"LIBYA LIE\", no! Will they remember the true facts about Obamacare, Medicare, Solyndra, or the Fast &amp; Furious fiasco and US Border Agent killed, or zero jobs, high unemployment rates and homeowner losses, bailouts, American anger and frustration, probably not! And will they remember the four American's killed in Libya because of this administrations stupidity, hopefully maybe!\nBut what they will most certainly remember is the constant TV and radio pundits actions on the VP debate. Over and over will we see Joe's laughing, eye rolling and condescending tone. The main media will spin it as if it is no big deal, it's Joe being Joe (as if this is somehow ok to be this way) and yes I hate to say it, but the Republicans will cry foul over it, constantly, rather than fighting back, \"HARD\", but what is the worse possible thing that could have happened overall has to be that the American public witnessed the two most powerfull offices in the land, for which has always been held in the highest esteem, now being hijacked by \"baffonery\" and irresponsible people. The two highest offices in the land from which produced the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abe Lincoln to FDR, Eisenhower and many, many others, and yes I include Ronald Reagan into this group as well. \nSingle handedly, these two so called American leaders - \"The Great O and now America's laughable Uncle Joe\" will go down in history, not as the great American leaders and heroes that our nation holds in the highest esteem (because they earned it), thus the office of the Presidency itself, but rather, these two by far, and hopefully never again, but because of this type of strategy and their respective performances, they have reduced the offices of President and VP itself, to something between being and SNL comic stand-in and coctail joke and a late night talk show host with terrible monologs. All of which to every American no matter who you are, should be totally \"U N A C C E P T A B L E\". It is time to take these two offices back with a change in 2012. To restore these two offices back to having integrity and dignity, and more important to further \"HONOR\" those Presidents and VP's who were the true leaders and visionaries that we all still hold in high esteem, with honor and with well earned praise!\nSo again I ask, who lost the debate? \"WE DID\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350131676", "subreddit": "Conservative", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you watch the video again, the first example where he goes from G maj 7 ( the I chord in Gmaj) then he goes to Ebmaj7 ( From G minor) Ok so instead of this, try playing G maj, then G minor, now play a B natural note, to a Bb note ( the B is the third of the Gmaj the Bb is the third of the Gminor ( its also the 5th of the Eb maj7 ) When he describes \" the color shifting back\" he means when the tonality goes back to G major again, So you could actually jam on G maj 7 to Eb maj 7 back and forth and see how the B natural the E natural and the F# function well there .Then on the Eb major 7 We need the E b the Bb and the F natural notes. if you prefer to think of the G major as G ionian and the Eb maj7 as Eb ionian( 1 to 1 in Eb maj)  instead of G aeolian ( 6 to 6 in Eb major) -it doesn't really change the underlying notes, it's just a question of if you want to have a holistic view of the piece modulating or  prefer to play it  chord change by  chord change.\n So let's look at the first case. I want to describe what is happening in the second chord ( Ebmaj7) in terms of what happened in the first chord. so a simple example would be G maj 7 with a melody line G A B C D E D then Eb maj7 with a melody line G A Bb C D  Eb D , notice how each line describes the chord it is over but the lines relate to each other in terms of the chord change.( notice in his example he begins his line over Eb maj 7 with  a G note G Ab G F etc). 2nd way, chord by chord, G maj 7 , melody line G A B C D E D  Eb maj7 melody line  Eb F G Ab  Bb C D, so here each line works for each chord but more independently of each other . One isn't necessarily better than the other, but the holistic approach with the idea of a continuing thread through the piece , thus the \" interchange\" -the intersection of the sets of notes.\n It's also important to note that the assignations of the chords are the most concise explanation of what happened. G maj 7 that is a I or a IV chord ( because a V chord is a dominant 7) So we choose I  ( it wouldn't be a IV unless what came after it proved t to be a IV in the key of D , so maybe an A7 would prove that or a D maj but we don't have those so Maj7 simplest is I major  Then Eb maj 7 what is the concise explanation here?, well from G major7 where we were last measure, to Eb maj 7 doesn't work in G major where an E is natural, so the next logical place relative to what happened last measure is G minor where we have an Eb maj7 chord, and we can think of this all in terms of scales that start from G as in, G ionian,( I in G major)  then G aeolian ( 6  in Gm )= modal interchange. It can continue with other keys that have a G note , it could go to C7 then F maj7 where you would continue with G dorian, and as before if you want the interchange you keep track of the salient thru note G and if not just worry about the chord you are on.

Instead I click the RMB once and it stays that way until I click again. Essentially this gives you a mouselook that should have been there from the start in GW2 itself.\n\nNow here comes the crucial part: **Don't** activate fast-ground targetting, keep the AoE circle and when you use mouselook (whether you keep the RMB pressed or use 3rd party software) make sure your mouse cursor is horizontally centered on your screen and vertcially somewhat half-way between the middle and the top border of your screen. \nIf you hit your respective grenade skill key now, the AoE targetting field will appear a few metres in front of your character. By moving the camera (remember we have RMB pressed the whole time) you can move that targetting circle much like you would expect in a 3rd Person Shooter. Now just click the same skill's button again and the grenades will be thrown. \n\nLater you can become faster and will learn to quickly double-tap that skill button but you will see the AoE targetting circle just for a brief moment and thus be able to tell if you're still aiming at the right spot.

I live in WV near the Va line and trust me \" that ain't bluegrass\" is a common phrase along with \"we already got someone who plays that\" It isn't just as simple as playing a blues scale over a polka back beat, you can drift into blues or country very easily, so you'll need to immerse yourself in the music and hear some of the evolution from Maybelle Carter first strumming a guitar because her main instrument was an autoharp and that's the only way she could play it. To the idea of English and Scots waltzes being more prevalent in Appalachia while French dances were more popular in the deep south, so the fiddle tunes change accordingly until you get to cajun music in Louisiana.

Onto to your questions.\n\nQuestion 1: ***is the XL \"too big\" to just lug around? It seems like I wouldn't fit it in my jean pocket while the regular 3ds might fit the size.***\n\nIt's not too much bigger than the original DS. Here are my imperial measurements from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/ykgs9/a_bit_of_a_size_comparison_3ds_xl_vs_other/):\n\n&gt;*(imperial measurements only as I do not own metric measuring devices)*\n\n&gt;L x W x H measurements for both systems *(measurements may have ~1/16th\"~1/8th\" margin of error)*: \n\n&gt;**DS model NTR-001 (collapsed): 5 3/4\" x 3 5/16\" x 1 1/4\"**\n\n&gt;**3DSXL model SPR-001 (collapsed): 6 1/8\" x 3 5/8\" x 13/16\"**\n\n&gt;As you can tell by the measurements alone, the 3DS XL is only slightly longer and wider than the DS phat. At the same time, the 3DS XL is thinner. Basically, the 3DS XL has a slightly bigger footprint and is a bit thinner. \n\n&gt;Also, weight measurements using my kitchen food scale in oz.*(measurements may have ~1oz. margin of error)*:\n\n&gt;**DS phat: 10 oz.**\n\n&gt;**3DS XL: 12 oz.**\n\n&gt;While the 3DSXL is 2 oz. heavier, that 2oz. isn't noticeable. They feel like they weigh about the same and feel about as sturdy, I might add. I've always felt that the \"lite style\" models felt so fragile by comparison...\n\nQuestion 2: ***are there any SIGNIFICANT advantages of XL over regular?***\n\nThese are the notable improvements on my gripes about the OG 3ds taken from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/yiucm/a_bit_of_a_size_comparison_3ds_xl_vs_other/):\n\n&gt;***The boot time on the 3DS XL is considerably faster.*** - Sometimes, on my OG 3ds, I would have to wait for almost half a minute to get it to start. Not sure why that was...\n\n&gt;***Improved battery life.*** - So far, I've managed to get about 6 hours of play time with the sound all the way up, 3d effect at medium and Wi-Fi turned on sometimes. *It should also be noted that my brightness was at level 3 and power saver mode was on.*\n^*Yourindividualbatterylifemayvary.*^*Consultyourphysicianifyouexperienceseizures*^*Batterylifemaynotbevalidinsomeareas*^*SuperspecialEXninjaBearFinalmodeonlyavailableinSeptembuary*\n\n&gt;***The select, start and home buttons are now actual buttons.*** - I really disliked the membrane style buttons on the OG system.\n\n&gt;***The stylus is now something I can grip with ease and doesn't try to slip out of my hand.*** - I never really liked the metallic telescopic thing on the OG system.\n\n&gt;***The 3D slider now has a \"clicky\" feel to it.*** - And I'm not just talking about the click when shutting the 3d off, there is some resistance/maybe tiny notches?/maybe I just got sensitive fingers? to adjusting the 3d effect now.\n\n&gt;***The size of the unit is great.*** - The buttons, circle pad and d-pad are all now far enough away from the bottom edge of the unit that my long slender fingers don't feel as cramped.\n\n&gt;***Matte finish instead of glossy finish.*** - Won't pick up fingerprints and look like it was massaged by a hotdog vendor.\n\n&gt;***The new screen size is very nice. To say the phrase, \"It's like butter!\" only begins to describe it.*** - Some may complain about blown up resolution, jaggy edges, etc. but I like it. The 3d effect is now more noticeable and it's easier to get to that, \"sweet spot.\"  Downloaded titles are now a dream to play and don't feel like I have to strain my eyes to see the pixels. This is especially true for Virtual console titles that were originally meant for 25\" CRT screens.\n\n&gt;***While it feels lighter that the OG system, it feels really solid now.*** - The OG 3ds always felt kinda fragile to me...\n\nQuestion 3: ***as far as the screen size goes, I've heard that 3ds games are one exact resolution so the games don't look as crisp on XL, is this true?***\n\nSee the part about the new screen size in my last answer. I like it for 3DS games and after owning it now for a month, the only problem I have is when it, \"blows up\" original DS games to fit the big screen. However, that can be solved by putting it in the, \"DS resolution mode\", so to speak, by holding start as the game boots up. That is if you don't mind the extra black borders.\n\nQuestion 4: ***when will the 3ds be obsolete to the point where I'll have to buy a new DS?***\n\nIn short, probably not for a long time. Nintendo has a long history of supporting all the multiple versions of a current generation of platform all the way until that generation is done. While I cannot predict the future, I'm confident enough to say that the OG 3ds will be supported throughout the 3ds lifespan. \n\nQuestion 5: ***are there any games coming up that take advantage of 3ds XL's screen?***\n\nNot as of yet. That doesn't mean Nintendo or other game developers won't do so in the future and even then, it'll be an optional thing. The most recent example of this is Pokemon Black 2 and White 2. It can be played on every model of DS all the way back to the OG DS launch model. The games will take advantage of newer tech on newer DS's/3DS's if it's available but not having the DSi/3DS features won't detract from the experience on an older DS models.\n\nQuestion 6: ***what's your battery life? (ie. not what's written online but your own experience)***\n\nSee my comment on Question 2 about battery life. I'm still getting about 6-6 1/2 hours total using the very same settings mentioned above. On my OG 3ds, I averaged about 3 hours using the OEM battery. I say that because I bought a [Nyko Power PAk +](http://www.amazon.com/Nyko-Power-Pak-3DS-Nintendo/dp/B004SJA7L6) for my OG 3ds and got an average of 5 1/2 hours on this extended battery using similar settings.\n\nI hope this comment helps.

Everything you have said thus far makes perfect sense to me, and I would have to agree that pedophilia is a deviation from the norm. It is a bit more shocking and appalling to the general public than other sexual preference deviations, but it is generally the same things going on in a pedophile's brain. It is a deviation as is bestiality, homosexuality, and every other paraphilia. Sorry that you have to deal with all this ignorance.

IT IS A   P R E F E R E N C E. Child MOLESTERS have sexual interactions with children.

Let's say I have a song like Manha de Carnival (a bossa nova tune) and let's assume it's played in the key of C. The tonic in this song is the relative minor though which is Am. Now if you play completely diatonically on the Am, then you would use the mode A aeolian (sometimes called \"natural minor\"), but there's a harmonic device which just works, which is to use Am6 instead of Am or Am7 on the tonic chord. And what works nicely with that is A dorian (the only difference between A aeolian and A dorian is a natural sixth instead of a flat 6). So the notes are A B C D E F# G instead of A B C D E F G..\n\nSo modes are a nice way to communicate the \"note reservoir\" on a certain chord. One could have just as easily said: \"Hey, try the G major scale on the Am instead of C major\", but saying: \"Let's use A dorian\" is a bit quicker and transports a little more of the intent..", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350469576", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

You want to remove high frequency noise, so you use an inductor instead of a resistor.\n\nHaving said that ... you can use a resistor for low current applications, this is not unusual and it's cheaper and smaller for the same low pass cut off frequency. e.g. small sensors or op-amps will often have a resistor in line with their power line to remove noise.\n\n\nRC filters do have their advantages Look at the equations for an RC and LC low pass:\n\nFc = 1 / ( 2 x PI x sqrt( L x C ) )\n\nFc = 1 / ( 2 x PI x R x C )\n\nIn both cases the L or R gets multiplied by the C. The thing is that most inductors are rated around the milli or micro Henry range, but resistors generally start in the single digital Ohms - this is because of their physical size. It's easy to get a big resistor, it's hard/expensive to get a big inductor!\n\nSo using a resistor, you can already drop your cut-off frequency by a large order by using a single ohm resistor versus a 1 milli-Henry inductor.

To notate that you could write:\n\nRewrite 4/4 as 30/30 (yes, a weird denomiator, but it's the same barlength, 30/30 ==4/4 == 1/1).\n\nYour first A would be 3 thirtieth notes, your B would be five of them, then three, then five, then five, then three, then three, then three.\n\nIf you add those up you get 30/3o so it checks out.\n\nNow, say if you'd had A B A B B A A, what you originally wrote.  It'd be the same thing but with a time signature of 27/30.\n\nA thirthieth note you'd write with three beams, because it's closest in duration to 32nd notes.  The same way the number of beams in tuplets are chosen.  The 11-tuplets at the very end of the Black Page (the hard version) are forty-fourth notes, so they're about halfway between 32nds and 64ths in speed, so they're written with that number of beams (three I think).\n\nAlso anywhere you've got a non-binary denomiator time signature, you could rewrite that as a normal time signature, the top number would be 27 or whatever you've got, but the 30 would change to 32, but you'd write that one bar at a different tempo (slowed down slightly in the case) so that the barlength is the same as 4/4.  You could write it as an absolute-number tempo change (d.s.quaver = X) or you could write it as a metric modulation, which is a tempo change written as a ratio of tempi.\n\nIn the case of your example, you'd probably write it as a metric modulation, since you derived it from a tuplet, and tuplets are essentially little localised MMs if you think about it.  They're tempo changes localised to within the tuplet bracket.  Other people might count tuplets more strenuously than me (see the other thread), but that's how I think of a tuplet:  speeding up or slowing down by a certain amount so that the notes fit.\n\nIn the case of the example where you've got five A's and three B's, you could just write that as a 30-tuplet in the space of the 4/4 bar, instead of 30/30.\n\nBut in the case the 27/30 example, you couldn't, not without adjusting the tempo anyway.\n\nNote that I can't actually play the above example, I just know how to notate it is all.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350566893", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I hadn't heard of this before, so I googled it and found this [post](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/68818-maybe-rlj-is-not-true/page__st__380) containing the following theory:\n\n&gt;Brandon impregnantes Ashara, Rhaegar impregnates Lyanna.  Lyanna makes Ned promise to save the baby before dying from childbirth, Ned sees a little purple eyed clearly Targ baby and knows he couldn't hide it in Westeros so when he goes to return her brother's sword he BABY SWAPS with Ashara, who goes along with it because she knows the baby will be given a good life by his Uncle Ned, and because, uh, she belives in the PTWP prophesy?  We know Rhaegar was pretty obsessed with it and talked to Elia about it, so as Elia's comapnon at KL she could have heard about it.  She leaves for Essos and hooks up with Jon Connington who she would have known from her time at KL when he was Hand, and creates the identity of Septa Lemore.\n\n&gt;The sigil of House Dayne is a meteor flying over a sword, and Dawn was said to have been forged from a meteor.  Ashara Dayne supposedly leapt off a cliff to kill herself.\n\n&gt;S E P T A  L E M O R E = METEOR  LEAPS\n\n&gt;She supposedly jumped from a tower called Palestone Sword.  S E P T A  L E M O R E = PALE METEORS\n\nNow, I think the anagram is a major stretch. But, given the speculation proceeding it, I think we have an interesting theory, regardless of the anagram. It would mean that Jon Snow is really the child of Ashara Dayne and Brandon Stark, which would make his Stark appearance and Ned's willingness to raise him not surprising. It's also possible that in this theory, Jon actually is Ned's son with Ashara. All of this is very plausible and not very exciting. The interesting part is the idea that Ashara has been raising the child of Rhaegar and Lyanna as Rhaegar's firstborn, Aegon. \n\nI think that there is a possibility that this is what Ashara has been up to. There are a few major flaws though. First being that I actually think Ashara being friends with Elia makes it less likely that she would want to raise Rhaeger's bastard, even if it means she would be familiar with the PtwP prophecy. But perhaps since she presumably fell in love with one Stark, she'd be willing to help out another and the fact that the bastard had a Stark for a mother might make the bastard part less of an issue. It's also sort of questionable why Ned would have been willing to ship Lyanna's son away. Perhaps it was the promise she requested? Or even if her request was to personally care for her son, perhaps that is why Ned thinks so often about Lyanna asking him to make the promise.\n\nI think I remember GRRM saying in an interview that it isn't likely that Benjen had any children, but that it is possible that Brandon fathered bastards. \n\nIgnoring the silly anagram claim, is there any more evidence for or against this theory?

In addition, there are 12 notes in an octave (7 white keys and 5 black keys), and the space between two adjacent notes is always the same, so if you play a song starting on E, you can play the exact same song starting on Gb and it'll sound the same except a bit higher (or lower if you picked a low Gb).  So what's the difference?\n\nThe home note, called the **tonic**, is the anchor of the scale.  Every pitch you hear, you hear relative to that tonic.  Do you have a piano?  (If not, [I have one](http://offtonic.com/synth) you can use; make sure it's set to Chromatic and play away!)  Play a C major chord on the left hand (using low notes on the synth), and then play the following notes: C C D B  CD E E F E  DC D C B C.  Now, play an A minor chord on the left hand and play the exact same sequence of notes.\n\nWhen you're in C major, everything you play seems to want to gravitate back to the C major chord.  If you play a G major, which is called the **dominant**, it wants to *resolve* to C major!  In A minor, on the other hand, everything wants to gravitate to the A minor chord.  The way you can tell what key you're in is to listen to the music and figure out which note (and chord) feels most like \"home\".  If you play C D E F G A B...  you'll want to hear that C, right?  If you sang that in your head just now, you certainly do!  Same thing if you play A B C D E F G...; you'll want to hear that A.  There are a lot of subtle ways of making the listener want to hear certain notes, and a lot of music lies in *not* playing that note until you have the listener's attention!\n\nFinally, just because a piece uses A, B, C, D, E, F, G doesn't mean it's in C major or A minor.  As I mentioned, there are seven scales using those notes.  It might be in D dorian (my favorite mode) instead, if the home note is D.  Dorian is just like minor except with a raised 6th, so C dorian would be C D Eb F G A Bb C (C minor is C D Eb F G Ab Bb C).  I love the sound of that sixth.  The idea is each note's relationship to the *tonic* makes the scale work the way it does.  How do you identify that tonic?  ...Well, it's not easy.  You do it by listening.  It can always change, too; it can change momentarily, or it can change for the rest of the piece, or it can (gasp!) not be there at all!  This is what atonal means.  It can be very difficult to write music that specifically avoids anything that might give you a clue about key (and it can be very difficult to listen to it, too).\n\nHope that answers your questions!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1350908080", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This is really apparent if you look at a paragraph of the same word repeated over and over again.

Most people don't read s e c then t i o followed by n and ending with s.  They read sect THEN ions.  Or sec then tions.  Or even just sections all at once.  Maybe they read section and then see the S and tack it on.\n\nBut after reading sections over and over again, and the brain filtering it out as noise and not a word, they aren't reading section with an S or sec followed by tions.

{"body": "Geographically challenged? *Cute* Last time I checked, Kansas City was in Missouri, Not Kansas. Of the whole KC area, only about 125,000 of the people actually in the state of Kansas. Which is why Kansas is only the 33rd biggest state based on population.\n\nThe whole point of your little thread/rant was that the nation doesn't care about K State. I have no problem with K State in an NCG, and could certainly tell you more about K State than the average \"T shirt\" college football fan, as you would say. What I've been trying to get across to you is *Why* the BCS has passed you over in the past. Story has nothing to do with it. Fair has nothing to do with it.\n\nAs a side note, I love how it is still October and your already bitching about how the BCS is screwing you. Win all of your games and you are probably in the NCG, and **AUTOMATICALLY** in the BCS. Even a one-loss K State team is probably in the BCS this year. Don't you think you should focus more on what your team has left to do than how you already think your going to get screwed in the end?\n\nI've seen fanbases like yours before. They get so caught up in how their getting the shaft, and not getting enough respect nationally, that they forget to play the rest of their games. When you lose and game or two this season, yes you will indeed fade from the national spotlight some. That is, if your team starts focusing on rankings with nearly two months to go as you are.\n\n\nI love how it's always that \"Big School\" fans have no idea about college football. I can tell by how non-well developed your ideas are, that I've been watching college football since before you were born. And not just Ohio State football either. I know, in your head, big schools have just always been big schools, and earn little of what they get. How do you think they became \"Big schools\" in the first place? They have been playing football at a high level for G E N E R A T I O N S. Big stadiums and extensive bowl records don't just happen overnight. It takes a long time for those things to come about. There are plenty of schools that produce a lot of alumni without being a football power. Simply having a bunch of students and alums does not equal football success.\n\n**Here's the other problem with your Rodney Dangerfield routine:\nIn the last 8 years, you've only been to 3 bowl games. Don't complain about nobody knowing/caring about K State when you aren't giving the \"Average fan\" a chance to see you.**\n\nThe respect that the \"Big schools\" get is EARNED. The fact of the matter is, K State football was nothing before Bill Snyder got there, became nothing as soon as he left, and is just now becoming important again because he came back. That isn't exactly a history of tradition and success. You want people to know/care about K State football? Try mattering to college football more than once in a while.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351179899", "subreddit": "CFB", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Do I even have an option for a donate-version to get rid of this?~~\n\nEDIT #3: Substance time:\n\nFirst, the good stuff, since I don't want to be totally negative. This is a really polished app. I love the little animations, highlighting, and callouts (like on the messages screen). Everything seems really accessible once I get used to the menus. Account integration is EZPZ.\n\nStuff I noticed:\n\n- When I added my account, the \"banner\" of active subreddits doesn't update, like it does on Reddit.com.\n- I'm still used to a pulldown, so the toggle for New/Hot/Top seems unintuitive to me.\n- I know it might be a technical challenge, but I really feel like I should be able to drag columns around.\n- I don't think that \"Remove and Unsubscribe\" should appear on the popup for removing a column. I will probably add/remove columns all the time, and never once unsubscribe via that route. Any time I click it, it will be an accident.\n- The first time I clicked on an imgur link, it took me f o r e v e r to figure out how to get back to the columns screen. Maybe a more intuitive \"X\" or back arrow at the top right of the image?\n- It's really easy to accidentally hover over something or click on something, since there is nearly no \"dead\" space on the screen. I'm not sure what the solution to this is; maybe make the text of each post link to the content, so hovering over/clicking the background does nothing?\n- The \"Close\" button on the \"Messages\" popup window does nothing for me. I have to restart the program to get back to the columns view.\n- On the Columns screen, there is an arrow on the right side of the window to move through the columns, but once I move over, there isn't one on the left to come back. I have to use the numbers at the top.\n- Reading a message does not mark it as read unless I reply.\n\n\nAll my bitching aside, I'm going to use Reditr for navigating Reddit for a few days.

Ruby Nell's two children and a friend witnessed Marion Lindsey take his wife's life from the passengers seats on September 18, 2002. Marion Lindsey had a history of domestic abuse.*\n\n*The stakes for shooting his 27-year-old wife were raised because of where Lindsey committed the crime — a police station parking lot. The shooting was deemed a capital crime because the shots were fired in a public place where the lives of other people — specifically the driver and three others in the car were put in jeopardy. The defense, however, argued that Marion Lindsey suffered from mental illness, which was even manifested in an imaginary friend he called Jimmy. But prosecutors contended his mental condition was a hoax devised to garner sympathy as he faced the death penalty.*\n\n**KEVIN COSGROVE 911 Call ON 9/11:** Here is the video of the audio: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CYZqQWfGIJg&amp;feature=related\n\nThat's all from the forum.

{"body": "Side effects are going to be \"quite awful\" by 16 weeks on only 500mg a week? Are you kidding me? Exactly WHAT sides are going to be \"quite awful\"?\nGranted, if he's one of those poor unfortunate souls who is super sensitive to estrogen, he may notice a little discomfort around his nipples and maybe a TINY bit of extra water retention, but a couple days of arimidex or nolvadex here and there will put that to rest.\n\nAnd that's ridiculous advice that those side effects are going to be 'quite awful' at 16 weeks, but you say going up to 12 will be fine? Those big bad side effects are suddenly gonna rear up in those last 4 weeks? Are you serious? \n500mk/wk of test???? OK dude. After reading that I couldnt possibly take anything else you ever say seriously.\n\nMaybe you dont make extra gains in an additional month of gear use, but just about everybody Ive ever known in my 20+ years of gear use didnt seem to have a problem adding some more gains in the last month on top of their first 3 months or so\nHis body will \"get used to the increased test\" by 16 weeks? Really? Dude, you just make yourself sound more and more like you are just spewing out bullshit from EliteFitness circs 1997. Dude, just stop. Please.\nMost of this \"receptor saturation\" bullshit is a myth and nobody ever seems to be able to back it up with real accredited documented studies.\n\nHCG may be a 'fad' in the diet world, but it has been a staple in bodybuidling for as long as it has because it just plain works for PCT. \nFar far better than clomid.\n\nMany times Ive stayed on gear year round and with a short run of HCG, my natural test levels were back into the midrange of normal. And yes, this was confirmed by a doctor.\n\nTaking small amounts of hcg throughout your cycle can -prevent- the suppression of test output by your testes. My endocrinologist suggested I use 200-300iu every 2-3 days throughout my long term gear runs to keep those testes cranking away.\n\nIve followed his advice and my regular bloodwork shows his advice was good. \n\nI agree, finasteride is a waste of time and money and wont do any good here.\n\nAs far as workouts go? I used to train each bodypart to failure once a week. And while that worked to some degree, my gains increased exponentially once I started hitting each bodypart twice a week.\n\nWhen on gear, you tend to recover that much faster and \nif you are going to use gear, you should try to take advantage of that fact. Almost every gear user I know who works each bodypart to failure twice a week (some of the high dose guys hit some parts 3 times a week...2 heavy days with 1 lighter day in between. Too much for me, but seemed to work for them) seem to make gains far better and faster than once a week.\nOf course, everyone is different, so maybe, like iplunderbooty, you will only be able to handle working each part out once a week. You wont know until you try.\nI stuck with once a week for years until I started working out once in a while with an old pro I grew up with (Mike Matarazzo...pretty massive dude from the 90's ProBB days) and persuaded me to just try twice a week for a couple months to see how I liked it.\n\nBy following his advice, instead of being stuck benching maybe 405lbs for a few reps I bounced to bench pressing over 535lbs, raw, no dumb ass bench shirt or wraps, straps, no liftoff, just a bar and a bench for 3 reps and it was still going up in weight until an injury outside the gym put a temporary end to it. And I am no powerlifter. I have nothing against the strong bastards who chase those numbers every week, that's some impressive shit, but my goal was to lift over 500lbs while having a single digit bf%. And I reached that goal. If I didnt push things like trying to work out each bodypart to failure at least 2 times a week, Id have never made it there.\n\nOf course, my dosages are higher than 500mg per week, but that's not the point. The point is that you should always strive to workout harder and smarter (within reason, no point hurting yourself and taking yourself out of commission for 3 months.) It's possible you may feel you are overtraining at twice a week, and 500mg/wk is a very small dose, but it's enough that I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how much faster you might grow hitting everything twice a week.\n\nHell, the least you can do is try it for a couple months and if you feel too run down and arent making gains in proportion to the effort expended, back down....you lose nothing by trying, but you might gain a lot.\n\n500mg test a week is not exactly a massive dose, even for a total novice. I know total novices that take 750mg/wk with eq and tren or some other androgen at moderate dosages. \nI dont recommend it, but what Im saying is, it never hurt anyone that I personally have known, and Ive come across scores and scores of gear users in my fucked up circle of steroid buddies.\nIm not saying it CANT hurt somebody if a novice went higher, but ive just never seen it. The worst sides ive seen to date, even with the high dose fuckers like me, is some possible extra acne (usually to guys prone to it, but I only get occasional breakouts no worse than anything I had as a kid. A little salicylic acid/neutrogena body wash and my skin clears right up.\n\nGyno? If anyone gets gyno its their own damn fault. You do not go to bed one night and wake up with a pair of tits. As fun as they may be to play with for a few hours at first, it's just not gonna happen. Gyno takes MONTHS of abuse and totally ignoring the growing discomfort, itching and swelling in the breast tissue without lowering your androgen dosages and/or taking anti-estrogens to combat it.\n\nHere's another point Ive made many times but I see too many people wasting their money and totally killing your gains by taking anti-estrogens every day because some self proclaimed 'guru' says \"you have to take them with test\".\nB U L L S H I T !\n\nFirst off, if you want to make your best gains in size and strength, you NEED estrogen. Totally suppressing estrogen will KILL YOUR GAINS PEOPLE!!! STOP LISTENING TO THE FUCKING SELF PROCLAIMED \"EXPERTS\".\nMost of these clowns havent even used more than a few cycles of test or dbol or maybe they were super reckless and brave and used a whole anadrol tablet once in the same week they took 1cc of cyp.\nUgh.\nI dont have a problem with novices one bit. It's the guys with no extensive experience themselves who say shit like \"NEVER use steroids if your under 25\" or \"never use test alone\" or \"You'll need TRT for the rest of your life if you stay on a long time\" and dumb, unsubstantiated shit like that.\nIm the first to admit that I dont know everything. And I learn something new every day, even here at this subreddit, which quite honestly is about as basic/novice/newbie level Ive ever seen, but that's cool, everyone needs a place like this to learn. The point is to learn and not spread misinformation by regurgitating the same old bullshit scare stories and myths written by morons who, most of the time, have never even used steroids and just claim to know it all because they read some shit written by another 17yo twat on some other site.\n\nI dont know it all, but what info I post is based on actual personal experience, that of close friends where i actually witnessed the use/results/issues, and that info which I get from my docs during my full blood workups every 3-4 months.\n\nToothpickarms, you will be fine at 16 weeks and Id bet safe money you could go even quite a bit longer. If side effects like gyno started up, youd notice it a mile away and could put a stop to it. You'll feel slight itching and or tenderness around your nipples...sometimes the feeling of your tshirt rubbing against your nipples will become painful.\nIf this starts to happen, simply take 1mg of arimidex a day until those feelings subside. Usually, this will only take 1-3 days at most. Once the feeling is gone, STOP the anti estrogens until either the end of your cycle, or until you feel the need to take a few days worth again.\n\nOtherwise you will significantly limit your gains. Estrogen is necessary for solid muscle/strength gains.\nTaking arimidex every day will not only fuck up your gains, but it will be wasting the money you spent on the arimidex and you wont be getting your moneys worth out of your gear, either.\n\nBesides, some guys just arent very sensitive to estrogen.\nIm on a gram of test, gram of tren, 600-700mg EQ, and rotate in either 100mg dbol or 150mg+ anadrol along with 8-10iu of GH.\n\nI use NO anti -estrogens except for the occasional day like I stated above where I may notice slight discomfort/itching in my nipples. I take armidix usually 2 days, maybe 3, then it goes away and I stop taking the arimidex until needed.\nThis happens only once every 2 to 3 weeks at most.\nIve never had gyno. I admit, I happen to be lucky in that respect (and unlucky with fucking calves that will never grow no matter how bad I pound away at them!)\n\nTake it all with a grain of salt, including what I say. I dont recommend anyone do what I do unless youve worked your way up to it safely and do it under a docs supervision as I do. Just be smart and safe and remember to sift through the bullshit, including mine, and try  to find the middle ground and you will do fine.\n\nI seem to remember you were a hard gainer, correct? IF so, longer term cycles and higher dosages might very well be something you will need to accept if you want to reach a certain goal.\n\nI too, was a hard gainer. I was 6'2\" 160lbs or so in high school. Im now 6'3\" and 275-280lbs at even lower bodyfat than I was then and still growing. It may take you a while, but I assure you that you will love the results of all your hard work as you plug away and make those gains.\n\nAnd yes, because you are a hard gainer, I believe you will probably need to eat as much as you stated. If you start to notice excess fat gain, simply back off the calories. Easy.\n\nEither way, I wish you luck with your gains and hope you reach your goals!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351296817", "subreddit": "steroids", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

So row, column and subgris). `cmap` creates a map of all those contention entries. `avl` then simply gives a vector of available numbers by using the contention map and removing all already used digits from 1 ... n. \n\n`at` places the left operand at the position given by inner-left operand in the sudoku puzzle of the right operand.\n\n`pvec` creates a vector containing all available  (`avl`) placements at a certain position. `pvex` then combines several of those entries (this is a bit magic so far).\n\n`emt` creates a vector with indices to empty cells in the sudoku.\n\n`svec` creates the solution by using `pvex` for all empty cells.\n\nThe optimization is simply that he calls `cmap rcp` only once and passes it as an inner-left operand to `avl`.\n\n*edit*: oh http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/126d70/a_sudoku_solver_in_apl/c6sk7a0 is a better explanation", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351361652", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Really?  It isn't quite the hot topic it was around the time of the reformation, but it's certainly a question that directly leads from the idea of an omniscient being.  Calvin and Luther both taught about Predestination and Lack of Free Will, and it's a question that got raised with the Enlightenment of the 18th century as well.  Part of Newton's (an intensely religious man) interest in developing classical physics was in investigating the ideas of determinism scientifically (remember this was still when the concept of \"science\" didn't exist and was rather classified as \"natural philosopher).  Deism sought to give free will back through the idea of the clock-maker god, who sets the rules, presses go, and gives us free will to fuck around from there.\n\nSkeptical, Scientific, Secular views struggled with some of these ideas until Quantum physics started to get popular, which was really the first scientific evidence for free will.  Science actually starts to suggest that what is done ISN'T done.  If we were back on the island, quantum physics suggests we could rewind and try the same experiment again, and it would only have a probability of ending up the same way, not a certainty.

Q for extra damage and E for slowing an enemy champion. \n\nDuring a 3 vs 1 (or 2) gank E is generally the better option as the slow will allow your teammates more opportunity to attack or use abilities then the damage from your Q. \n\n\nDuring 2 v 2 trades using her Q powercord is more effective wince burst trumps sustain in equal fights. \n\nMy Sona Core is Boots + HoG + PhiloStone + Chalice\n\nThis allows you to spam your abilities all day long and rarely run low on mana. The increased regen rate ensure during any slow downs your mana regen is massive. \n\nSona's W powercord is really only effective vs a sustained AP damage mage like Cassiopeia, Vlad or Amumu. Although the damage reduction is huge the other powercords are better in most situations. \n\nSona's R is a more effective secondary initation then primary one. It is best used to follow up a group AoE like an amumu or malphite ult or cho'gath rupture. Although it can be used as a primary initation it does put you at risk of being focused by a cc before you can cast it effectively. \n\nGenerally speaking I suggest leveling Q W Q E Q R Then R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E\n\nA single poit in E at level 4 allows for slow powercords which make ganks from the jungle more effective. While learning the basics of Sona you may want to hold off on pointing E early to gain additional healing.

{"body": "I'm going to have to disagree with you on this one. Lee Sin, Hecarim, and Renekton are all snowball-y champions in top lane. What I mean by this is that they can pretty much play against anyone top, play smart, and with a gank from their jungle they can dominate top lane and go full aggression. \n\nI'm currently playing around 1550 ELO which isn't the best but it's still where the majority of people are playing. Anyway, lets look at the utility of each of the champions compared to that of the two you mentioned, which are Irelia and Jayce.\n\n**Irelia:**\n\nIrelia's early game is pretty \"meh,\" in all honestly. You don't have much control until you get to level 6 and you can't really do a whole lot until you get either brutalizer or phage. Her Q offers her an easy way of farming granted she hits them correctly; W giving her good sustain and harass; E giving her a somewhat of an escape; R giving her the control she needs in lane. What I mean by this is up until you hit lvl 6 you don't have a lot of potential to bully someone who has more burst than her or someone who simply out-sustains her. She does have some killing potential at lvl 4 if she plays the match up correctly though.\n\n**Jayce:**\n\nJayce is a poke champion, simply put. He can't do much early levels either other than push and maybe poke you out of lane. However, a smart player will just stand behind creeps and avoid his EQ combo in cannon form and will choose a fighter to force Jayce to go into hammer form for the QE combo and just kill him straight up. Jayce is meant to be played as a shove, gank/counter jungle, shove champion. Unless you're extremely squishy or don't build wriggles/tabi or just a chain vest for a later GA or Frozen heart then he has a lot of potential to just dive you and straight up kill you. \n\nSummary for both, is that they have potential to kill only if they can either poke you well, or are just better than you. The reason you see top tier people play these champions is because they have a pretty high skill cap, and a lot of abilities that let you outplay someone.\n\nNow lets look at the three that I mentioned and how they compare in lane to the previous two.\n\n**Lee Sin:** \n\nLee is a super high skill cap champion, he has a lot of mobility and is an excellent duelist with kill potential at lvl 3 without help from a jungle. His Q gives him mobility, chase potential, and a good amount of damage; W probably the thing that turns duels and ganks around the most; E biggest dueling and anti-gank utility; R combo potential, escape potential, counter initiate potential. Maxing W in top lane is completely necessary in my opinion, it will let you outplay and out sustain even Irelia. The thing is, if either Irelia or Jayce try to fight Lee Sin, and the player is competent, Lee wins hands down. Lee is what both Irelia and Jayce fear, a gap closer with Attack Speed Debuff. In team fights Lee works just like Irelia, an assassin meant to take out targets quickly; on the other hand, Lee offers something Irelia doesn't which is an AoE slow. You could argue that Irelia offers AoE damage with her Ulti, but its not as significant if the enemy team has double AD comp like AD bot and Jayce top, or a bruiser top and AD bot who both rely on AA'ing. Lee also offers split pushing potential as he doesn't need Ignite to kill someone in lane he can substitute it with Teleport.\n\n**Hecarim:**\n\nHecarim is probably the most fun champion I've played other than Lee Sin. Hecarim has been said to have some of the worst scaling in the game, and said to be useless late game. This is because most people underestimate his damage output. Multiple Q's plus his W give off a whole lot of damage if neglected. You also don't build Hecarim to win top lane, you build him to snowball it. Going fast Philo stone and Heart of Gold into Sheen / Frozen heart means you have some damage but mostly you can dive people and just run at them as Hecarim was meant to be played. Your damage should be coming from Trinity alone, and should be finished last, you really only need Sheen and then build tank after that. Hecarim is meant to shove, and gank and that's it. Hecarim is also one of the best initiates in the game with a huge AoE fear. \n\n**Renekton:** \n\nRenekton works like Irelia, not a lot of kill potential early, but once you hit lvl 6 you have probably the most kill potential of any of the champions mentioned. His E W Q E Combo is really strong, and his ultimate turns fights around. He works kind of like Hecarim where you just want to build him with some damage and mostly tank and just run at people. He's one of the champions that people say scales really badly into late game, but again, building brutalizer and last whisper then going full tank after that ensures you do damage and still be useful as an initiate for your team. His initiate isn't as strong as Hecarim, but going in  with E E W Q to zone the carry and then pop ulti to escape semi-safely is huge.\n\n**Summary**\n\nWhile Jayce and Irelia are the most used in top lane by many pros, its mainly for the reason of having a high skill cap and being able to do so much with so little. There are other champions who can be just as useful to a team as them (like the ones I mentioned). \n\nIn response to OP more directly, you don't see many other tops used because Irelia and Jayce fit into almost any team comp, whereas the three I mentioned are more niche oriented.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351535754", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

It's not just about scaling sizes, but also about multiple capabilities (screen resolutions, brightness, cpu performance, memory, version, NFC, bluetooth, cameras, etc...).

{"body": "I'm not sure this explanation was warranted, as he was just saying he generally solos using the pentatonic scale. For instance, in D minor, he's using D F G A C. This is the basis for his solos, but he also finds that if he does add anything to this set, the added notes tend to be E and B, thus giving you D E F G A B C, or D dorian. If he were adding Bb instead of B natural, then he would be using a D minor scale. See how that works? \n\nThat being said, his explanation of how he solos makes sense. You didn't actually give him any reasoning as to why you \"very much doubt [he was] playing either pentatonic or dorian\", though that's for the best because he probably was using those scales. \n\nAs for this:\n&gt;I think you were adding one of the 2 extra notes from the diatonic scale to the pentatonic and calling that dorian, which you now know, it isn't.\n\n-adding notes to the pentatonic scale absolutely gives you other scales, one of which is the dorian mode (add major 2nd and major 6th). To accentuate that, you'd want to make sure the harmony that you're playing over uses the same scale, thus giving you an available chord base of i-ii-III-IV-v-vi°-VII, though v is rarely used and would most likely be changed to V. I also agree with EveToWither that without harmonic context, none of it makes sense.\n\nFor the most part, your general idea was right, but practical usage wasn't there. I would encourage anyone who wants to learn about modes and scales to use any available online resources, because your explanation muddies the waters. I can appreciate that you're trying to help someone, but make sure you fully understand something before you barge in as an \"expert\" on the subject.\n\nSource: undergrad and masters degrees in music theory and composition", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351662323", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sona is still one of the strongest supports out there.  Yes, she is unfathomably squishy at the moment but it's easy to remedy that with a proper playstyle and good runes and masteries.  \n\n**Runes**\n\n* Reds (Marks) - Flat armour.  Magic penetration are the typical marks people go for in most circumstances, but I prefer armour.  The reason for this is once Sona reaches level 9, her damage will not improve again, at all.  The 9 penetration just doesn't make enough of a difference for a champion that doesn't care about damage after the laning phase.  Also Sona has crazy low base armour so every instance helps.  \n\n* Yellows (Seals) - Flat armour.  I previously used 5 armour yellows and 4 gp/10 but changed to 9 armours after the recent nerfs.  Best source of armour, the number one stat for early game Sona.  \n\n* Blues (Glyphs) - Either armour blues or MR blues.  depending on your lane opponents.  Someone like Leona warrants flat MR blues as her damage is quite impressive (and she's a typical counter pick to Sona) but against Soraka I wouldn't bother.  \n\n* Quintessences - This catagory is the most diverse, and a lot of the options here are down to personal preference.  Good choices are GP/10, HP, movement speed.  After the nerf I go for 1 HP quint and 2 GP/10, typically.  \n\n**Masteries**\n\nIn the past I used to run 0/9/21 a lot, as well as using cooldown reduction glyphs to have 10% CDR at level 1.  I've since devalued CDR as a stat Sona seeks with defencive stats taking a higher priority.  As such, I pretty much exclusively run 1/14/15 now, although there is room for personal preference here.  \n\nHere is a link to [Solomid.net](http://www.solomid.net/masteries.php#0000000000000000001304321000000001031030400200000) of the masteries I use.  There are two points left over which can be spent wherever.  You can choose between improved exhaust, extra experience for kills/assists or more MR.  \n\n**Playstyle** \n\nSkill order - Q W Q W Q R is my favourite.  You typically wont have the mana pool to sustain the third spell and the movement speed is quite lackluster at rank one anyway.  Getting the heal to rank two makes it much more mana efficient and gives your lane much more staying power.  I usually pick up E at level 8.  \n\n*EDIT:  Take E at level 4 if your lane and jungler combined have no crowd control or very little.  Power chord with E is a very strong slow which could make or break a gank.*  \n\nAt the start of the game, put your skill point into Q and immediately ready 2-3 charges of your power chord.  You will recoup the mana way before the laning starts.  Guard the jungle and do golems if blue side (Sona is brilliant at golems).  If on purple side, help your jungler do blue or guard it if he starts red.  You can use power chord to damage blue if you're going for a smiteless clear or save it if not, as at level 1 it's damage is significant.  \n\nFrom the very beginning, always look for opportunities to Q the enemy.  If you can get both of them in one, brilliant, but your focus as a duo should always be to whittle one target down, preferably their ADC (Attack Damage Carry).  Communicate with your lane partner how aggressive you are planning on playing (hopefully and ideally, very aggressive) but know the limitations.  Even with all these defencive runes and masteries, you are still made of glass.  This is a skill that cannot easily be written, and is much easier learned through practice.  \n\nI'll leave the playstyle part at that, since you were only enquiring about runes and masteries.  I hope this brief summary helps you out with Sona, and feel free to ask any questions if I haven't made myself very clear.
