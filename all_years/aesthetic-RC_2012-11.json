{"body": "&gt; I'm not sure this explanation was warranted, as he was just saying he generally solos using the pentatonic scale. For instance, in D minor, he's using D F G A C. This is the basis for his solos, but he also finds that if he does add anything to this set, the added notes tend to be E and B, thus giving you D E F G A B C, or D dorian. If he were adding Bb instead of B natural, then he would be using a D minor scale. See how that works?\n \nOf course I understand how that works, no need to be condescending (although I've been called condescending in this thread, so perhaps I shouldn't be allowed to make that judgement). Clearly you can be in the minor pentatonic then add the two pitches 2 and 9 semitones, i.e. a major 2nd and 6th, above the tonic, and, without switching tonics, you'd be in the Dorian mode, but it's highly unlikely that's what the OP's doing. Almost all pop music that uses the pentatonic scale is minor pentatonic over minor diatonic framework. I'd bet that he's not going modal (in his solos, while the backing track is almost certainly minor), and that he's actually just going to the corresponding minor scale or something close to it. (Edit: Even if he was by some strange chance playing only the Dorian mode, that in itself is a huge red flag that he doesn't understand modes.) \n\n&gt; -adding notes to the pentatonic scale absolutely gives you other scales, one of which is the dorian mode (add major 2nd and major 6th). To accentuate that, you'd want to make sure the harmony that you're playing over uses the same scale, thus giving you an available chord base of i-ii-III-IV-v-viÂ°-VII, though v is rarely used and would most likely be changed to V.\n \nIn the Dorian mode, obviously the triads available are i- ii - III - IV - v - vi(dim) - VII. This is trivial. It's the same triads that are available in all modes, just with the numbers rotated so that the Dorian tonic triad is the first degree.  \n\nThen you say the v is rarely used, and it's best to substitute a major chord there. This is just terrible advice. It shows very little actual reflection into when and why musical rules were developed, if those rules are still worthwhile, and what the Dorian mode is. \n\nThink about why you believe a major chord should be substituted on the fifth scale degree. By doing that you've essentially just changed the Dorian structure to that of the melodic minor, so a better, more-general question to ask yourself would be, why did western composers of the not so distant past almost always alter the minor scale to the harmonic and melodic minor, and how much does this \"why\", even if foolish, still affect our current understanding of music theory? \n\nIn my opinion, your insistence on a major chord rooted on the pitch a perfect fourth down from the tonic, the altered minor scales, and unfortunately many commonly held harmonic and melodic beliefs still held in the music world today are all relics of painfully simplistic, obsolete music theory from the 17th century. \n\nOnce the modern western musical system had been fully adopted, and diatonicism, the most stable 7 note spread, came to dominate all music, the major and minor modes stuck out as the most exploitable (and I mean that in a good way). They both are centred around the identically stable and most stable triads, i.e, the major and minor chords, and have at the most consonant interval from the tonic triads, both ascending and descending, the same triads, i.e. major chords for the major mode and minor chords for the minor mode. This creates a very simple way to define tonality in these two modes: begin and end on the tonic triad (simple repetition of the tonic is maybe the easiest way to imply tonality, one that works equally for all scales and modes, and is used constantly), after playing the initial tonic triad move in some fashion (initially the requirement would have been:move immediately) to one of the other two triads of the same type, then resolve back to the tonic.  \n\nFurther, it seems that early ears insisted on the most obvious melodic resolution, which was, once you leave the tonic, the only way to build momentum back towards it was with a leading tone, preferably preceded by a run up of tones (as in 2 semitones) from either the fourth or fifth scale degree (our triads that pivot to the resolution after all) to create a sort of tone-gallup up to the leading tone, which only then do we arrive at the small interval of the semitone. Run as fast as you can to the tonic, slowing down only at the last second! \n\nSince compositions seemed to require this leading tone melodic resolution, and the harmonic resolution of a like triad either 5 semitones up or down from the tonic, followed by the tonic triad itself, the minor mode can no longer fulfill all the resolution requirements. The major mode still does, but only one of the two resolutions includes a leading tone, the V-I resolution.  IV-I no longer is viable. \n\nBut composers also saw that the minor mode had exploitability similar to the major mode (but different). The solution, instead of learning new ways to imply tonality for this distinct mode, was to instead alter the minor mode to be closer to the familiar, safe major mode, so they could more or less operate in the minor mode just as they did with the major. Hence the melodic and harmonic minor scale. \n\n(Now I'm not saying the melodic and harmonic minor scales are bad, although they do create imbalances in the scale that have to be acknowledged and addressed when composing in them, but they are hugely overstressed even today. We still haven't thrown off those initial tonality defining requirements.)\n\nHow long was music almost exclusively composed in the major and altered minor modes? A comically long time. \n\nOf course, these rules have been softened or totally abandoned over time. We no longer insist on a leading tone for resolution, allowing for the natural minor mode, and four - one cadences. We no longer insist that resolution must come from a like chord, so leading tone resolutions can come from VII(dim)-I, iii-I, etc (though these all have strengths and weaknesses of their own, e.g., in the iii-I resolution only one note moves, the other 2 remain the same, making it feel very still, and not very pronounced). We don't have to start and end on the tonic. etc, etc.  Pop music doesn't really care about cadences at all most the time, choosing instead to create tonality through repetition. There have been some attempts to exploit the other modes, particularly in jazz and exotic (Non German!) music. Atonality took hold for a while, most popularly with Schoenberg's 12 tone system, but the parameters there, while they produced some novel, interesting music, were comically restrictive. \n\nBut even as we abandon our initial restraints and open up to more musical possibilities, we are still affected by these early rules, be it consciously or subconsciously.  Sometimes when we're not careful we show a heavy unjustified bias in favour of them. \n\nWhen you told the OP to use the Dorian mode with a major chord on the fifth scale degree, you were essentially telling the OP, \"here's the Dorian mode, and how you use it is you alter it to be a mode you already know how to use, namely the raised 7th degree makes Dorian the melodic minor, which really, if we're going to be honest, is a scale that was created early in western music's history, in an attempt to make the minor scale work more like the very safe, familiar major scale. So just play Dorian like the major scale. Play safe, don't get hurt.\" \n\nLet's actually play in Dorian. No cheating. Let's find new strengths in the mode that are unique to it, and exploit that. This is actually something that nobody does. Even many of the so called great composers weren't willing to really dig into and analyze the unknown. So what are some unique features of the Dorian mode? One that jumps out to me, is that it is the only perfectly symmetric mode in diatonicism (a feature you're destroying with the V chord), i.e., ascending from the tonic is intervalically identical to descending from the tonic. This symmetry can be exploited easily. In Dorian any set of notes played melodically or harmonically, has an analogous set of notes that are intervalically identical and directionally opposite, which you find by reflecting the notes through the tonic. This could create a strong sense of Dorian. Combine that with the tried, tested, and true tonality creating technique that works for any scale or mode of just playing the tonic a lot, preferably also starting and ending on it, and boom, you're playing in Dorian for real.\n\nQED\n\nJK \n\nLOL", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351729559", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Pretty much already elaborated here, but I thought I would take it further to explain the logic behind it.\n\nThe Lydian mode is a much more \"stable\" mode to derive all of the other modes. If you look at the [circle of fifths](http://blog.sokay.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/circle-of-fifths-notes.jpg), to derive all of the other modes in the key of C, it would make more sense to start in the key of G and move counterclockwise. Essentially what happens as you progress between each key signature, you change one note, thus the \"chromatic\" part of the lydian chromatic concept. Let me elaborate further.\n\nIf you play C to C in the key of G, you would have C Lydian; the notes are as follows: C D E F# G A B C\n\nMove up a fourth\n\nIf you play C to C in the key of C you would have C Ionian; the notes are as follows: C D E F G A B C\n\nMove up a fourth\n\nIf you play C to C in the key of F you would have C Mixolydian; the notes are as follows: C D E F G A Bb C\n\nContinue on til you get to Db...\n\nThis works in all keys. If you want to derive all of the modes for the key of Eb, you would move up a fifth (Bb) and work counterclockwise til you're a tritone away from Bb (Fb).\n\nEssentially what is happening is that every fourth you move up in the circle of fifths you altering the scale by one note.

For example, if you're playing in G major, your tones are  G A B C D E F#, G is 1, C is 4, and D is 5.  Each tone has a triad (3 note) chord associated with it.  Going back to the G example, a 5 chord would be a D (D F# A).  The advantage of this system is that it allows easy transposition, allowing you to play in other keys, and gets you thinking in music theory.  The cool thing is that if you just use the 1, 4 and 5 chords from any key, you have chords that cover all tones in the scale, so if you have a melody it's easy to come up with an accompaniment.\n\nIt takes practice to think like this, but it will help you play with other people too!

{"body": "Time signatures exist to tell you how long a bar of music is, in terms of beats. This helps structure the phrase that the bar is a part of. The top number in the signature tells you how many beats are in a bar. The bottom number tells you how the music defines a single beat.\n\nImagine I asked if you were hungry enough to eat two slices of pizza. Think of that as the top number in the signature. In order to know exactly how much food that is, you'd probably ask, \"Well, it depends. How big is each slice?\" The bigness of each slice is the bottom number. The top number, therefore, means nothing without the bottom.\n\nBeats are named as fractions over powers of two: half-notes, quarter-notes, eighth notes, and so on. This came about historically. If a bar is in 4/4, it has four quarter-beats in it. A bar in 4/2 has four half-beats in it. A bar never has to add up to 1 (four quarters makes 1, for example, but four halves makes 2)âthe names just are what they are.\n\nThe last basic concept is how speed fits in here. Say you're snapping your fingers once per second, and you call those quarter notes. A half note, which is worth two quarters, would take as long as two finger snaps. Now let's say you decide to rechristen the snaps as half notes. Quarter notes would go by at two per snap, while the halves would happen on every snap. You can set the speed of the music however you want; the notes are always relative to each other, but they have nothing to do with the absolute speed of the piece.\n\nThat makes it all ambiguous, right? Imagine a basic tune like \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star.\" You might write its first line as Q Q Q Q Q Q H, where the Qs are quarter notes and the H is a half. But going by my above paragraph, you could also write it as H H H H H H W (halves and a whole), or E E E E E E Q (eighths and a quarter). All those ratios work for the song's relative note lengths, so why does it matter?\n\nThe answer is that historically, the system has become based roughly around quarter notes, which happen at a moderate speedâfor example, one click per second. The symbols we use for these notes make this easy to read: the longer notes look quite different from the shorter ones. If you based all your music around sixty-fourth notes as the basic beat, with thirty-seconds being twice as long and one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth notes being half as long as the basic beat, the music would look impossible to read, because of how those notes are drawn. [This picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Metric_levels.svg&amp;page=1) shows eighth and sixteenth notes; imagine adding more and more black bars to them, and trying to read that page. It would be tough.\n\nBut ultimately, you decide the speed and how the piece is played so that it's expressive. The time signature just tells you how to put its meters and rhythms together.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1351869020", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The Land of opportunity gives people MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY the chance to be wealthy.  Whether through lottery, one really great idea, or anything else you can think of the Poor in the united states are CLOSER to being millionaires than any other place in the world because of the vast array of opportunities here to not only make money with a god given talent or idea but also WIN money just by playing the thousands of different lotteries available to the Poor in the United States.\n\n\nThe Poor don't look at themselves as embarrassed Millionaires this idea is not only REALLY insulting but preposterous!  I see 9 or 10 bums walking on the street in San Fran I don't see them with the attitude of \"Oh damn it I'm just a future millionaire down on my luck... \"I'll bounce back\"  I see a guy or girl who's completely been pummeled by this world and is ready to move on.  They're over the US and earth.  \n\nAs far as the extremely poor go such as those that live in \"Project Housing\" and \"Trailer parks\" yes I think a lot of those people see people in their same situation who have rose up and changed themselves from poor to extremely rich and that's what they strive for because of the MEDIA but not even CLOSE to a large enough percentage for someone to say \"That All Poor SEE Themselves as Down on their luck Millionaires\"!  That's C R A Z Y.  What about the mothers and fathers who work 3 jobs so they can support their families whatever their situation may be Kids, the elderly, aging parents, sick children, a sick spouse, or just trying to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and get their families out of the financial bottom of society.

{"body": "Short note on **Nautilus**: Try to avoid using Q as an initiate while ganking. It is much better to simply run up to them and use Q AFTER they've blown their escape mechanism (a dash, Flash, etc). Plus it's much easier to land on a target that is moving directly away from you rather than perpendicular to your movement. As a tank, your main role in teamfights is to ult the enemy ADC/APC and peel for your own ADC.  Aegis, Shurelyas, and Randuins are all very nice on Naut, and I usually cap off my build with an Abyssal Scepter if my APC hasn't gotten it. AP Naut is actually pretty damn good, so while he's probably best in the jungle, don't be discouraged from trying him in lane.\n\n&gt; RIYL (Recommended If You Like): Maokai, Nunu, Amumu, Blitz - AP based support junglers and excellent initiators.\n\nFor **Taric** I have GP10 yellows and MS Quints over armor yellows and GP10 Quints. I also typically start Boots/Ward/2pot; with this combination I have an huge advantage by playing aggressively and feeding my ADC an early kill. However, this only works if I succeed in getting assists - so if I ever get too far behind (their ADC has a two kills up on us, etc) it's extremely difficult to come back from it. Again, this is for an aggressive support playstyle which doesn't always work... so it pays to ask your lane partner if they're aggressive or passive in lane.\n\n&gt; RIYL: Leona, Alistar, Blitz. Aggressive supports that rely on dominating the lane instead of passive farming.\n\n**Renekton:**\n\nSummoners: Ghost/Ignite. Renekton already has a dash (his E) that can cut through walls at nearly the same distance as Flash. His main issue is keeping up with his targets, which is why Ghost is such a good pick on him. \n\nSkill order: Q E Q W Q R, then R &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; W.\n\nBuild order: \n\n* Boots/3pot or Cloth/5pot.\n* Rushing an early Brutilizer and Tabi's is usually my first step. Follow that up with a Phage, BF Sword, and Chainmail. If you can't afford a Brutalizer, double Doran's isn't bad.\n* Finish up your items into Frozen Mallet, Guardian Angel/Randuins Omen, Bloodthirster, and Last Whisper. I typically complete FroMa and GA before completing the others. Consider swapping out the Tabi's for Merc Treads or Ionians (if they have little CC).\n\nMasteries: 21/9/0, with points into the offensive CDR mastery. CDR is huge on Renekton, as he is entirely cooldown based.\n\nRunes: Flat AD reds and Quints, armor yellows, and MR/lvl blues. Also consider ArPen over the flat AD, especially since Season 3 is changing the way flat and % armor penetration is working. \n\nEssentially, the goal of Renekton is to get at least 1 kill at or before level 6. He is one of the strongest earlygame laners, and easily crushes most toplane matchups. However, his scaling isn't nearly as good, so as lategame approaches his damage begins to fall off *unless* you've managed to get that early game advantage.\n\nPay attention to your Fury bar, as it adds a TON of extra damage on your skills, especially Q. Getting a 50 Fury Q off on a lane opponent level 3 can mean an easy 225 health swing in your favor (~150 damage to your opponent, ~75 health to you). Usually you want to harass by getting 50 Fury, E into them, Q, then E out before your lane opponent can respond. If you can get them to below 50% health, with Ignite and an empowered E/Q/W/E combo it is an almost certain kill.\n\nIf you've managed to get that kill =&lt; 6, then keep up the pressure by going heavy offense. Again, I have to stress how important it is to get that early kill, or at least a heavy CS advantage on your lane opponent. Renekton relies heavily on snowballing, which is why he is such a high risk/reward champ that is rarely played. In teamfights his main goal will be to jump in after the initiation CC has cleared and attempt to assassinate the enemy ADC. His double dash and ult allow him to jump a surprising amount of distance and soak up a decent amount of damage.\n\n&gt; RIYL: Riven, Lee Sin, Pantheon, Rengar. Great early game aggression and damage that rely on snowballing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352160926", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "You're right that the ingoing/outgoing thing is never really explained.

Sometimes it's as easy as kiting an enemy to a bush and popping in and out, constantly procing your passive. If they follow you in, they're isolated for your Q. \n\n\nUse your jumps to harass and push the enemy out of lane only if you see their jungler elsewhere on the map, or you have sufficient wards. Khazix will die in almost every co-ordinated 2v1. (Though sometimes cutting off the jungler gank when he's 50% health and bursting him down with E Q W Q combo is fun.)\n\nGank mid or invade jungle whenever your lane is pushed to their tower. Your jump initiate/escape in jungle, or engage in mid lade+passive slow is a huge benefit to ganks and counterjungling. Make use of it. Don't get carried away and get back to lane before you miss too much CS or get further behind. \n\nONLY TOWERDIVE WHEN YOU ARE SURE YOU CAN SECURE THE KILL AND JUMP BACK OUT. Towers hurt, bro, and Kha isn't too tanky.  \n\n**Team Fighting**\n\nIn team fights, if things are swinging in your teams favor and you can drop champions in a combo, jump the isolated targets immediately. Squishy targets preferably. Ones you can melt and then jump on to the next one. \n\nIf your team is on the receiving end of the business, then peel for your ADC. Use your passive to slow whomever is jumping him, and (hopefully they're isolated) burst them down. Once your ADC is safe from any divers, jump onto their squishies/low health temporary survivors. \n \n\nAny further inquires, just ask. \n\nEDIT: You do not need to stomp your lane. Getting 80+% of the CS in your lane will farm you sufficiently to cause huge damage in mid to late game.Also, added a Runes section. \n\nEDIT2: Clarified skill order and evolve order.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352219954", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 79, "controversiality": 0}

You told me that you \"don't fit into G's\".  You must not have read the article, and you clearly don't understand how bras work (no offense, really, just, I want to teach you!).\n\nEvery time you go down a band size (to the next even number), you have to go up a cup size (in US it's just ABCDEFGHIJ, in UK it's A B C D DD E F FF G GG) to reach the same cup volume.  So, if you are using US sizes, when you adjust for going down the band size, the 36 C is a 30 F (US).  Exact same cup size, yours is just one size bigger to get to G.  And, since tighter bands hold in more tissue than looser bands do, the cup size often needs to increase when you go down.  So that makes a 30 G sound exactly right.\n\nYou really need to get yourself into a shop and try on those bras!  Or if you can't find them, just order online.  But remember the difference between  US and UK cup sizes.  Honestly UK sizes make MUCH more sense because the US sizes mean practically nothing past D, they are all wonky all over the place.  So you may have to look for UK, which would be UK 30F. Unless the size you cited was a UK G.  Which would mean it's the equivalent of a US I, and just a couple sizes bigger.

What I thought was a 1600 calorie day turned out to be 2600!

This means you won't be having things sitting around that are easy to lose track of how much you are eating like pringles, wheat thins, pre made drinks that have 2.5 servings in them etc etc.  Everything you have for food should be things that require you to prepare them from the most basic forms possible, and yes this mean you will learn how to become very good at cooking which will also mean the food you eat will be less calories because things made from scratch tend to have less calories as long as you keep it simple.\n\nSo you are going to have things like potatoes, carrots, celery, pasta, rice, make sure you find some lower calorie bread that you enjoy eating, you will have chicken breast, steaks, shrimp, and you will learn how to cook them all and season them all with simple things like pepper and salt and maybe if you want to get crazy and this is my personal favorite I use balsamic vinegar to add a ton of flavor to rice with chicken breast.  You will also learn to measure your food and figure out how much a serving is of whatever meal you just made, then divide it up into containers and then you know exactly what you can eat because the hardwork is done for you.\n\nOh and the most important thing over all the stuff I just said is that if you will not make the commitment to record everything you are eating 100% honestly every single day then don't even waste your time doing everything else I just said because you will be wasting your time.  Even if you are correctly recording yourself going over your limit you must MUST M U S T have the habit of recording what is going on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352359856", "subreddit": "loseit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Invoker is my most played hero.  (High/Very High MM)\n\nI play it as a semi-carry/utility hero instead of trying to get cute with Exort builds.\n\nMy go-to skill build is basically to max Quas &gt; Wex &gt; Exort, but I take 1 point in Exort at level 11 or prior.  I pick the second point in invoke at level 7, but wait on 3 until around 14, and of course maxing it at 17.\n\nThe reason I max quas over Wex is because of how unbelievably amazing Cold Snap is.  This skill is basically a 300+ damage 6 second stun with max Quas on only a 20 second cooldown.  \n\nBecause of my lower points in Wex, EMP isn't going to hit much early/mid game, but it does it's job as a spell that dictates positioning in fights. \n\nBy taking a point in Exort around level 11, and having max Quas, your Ice Wall is A M A Z I N G.  It's a full TWELVE seconds of immobility in a very large area if your positioning is good.  \n\n\n\nItem build:\n\nI normally random, but if I get a hero that I really don't want to play, I'll repick into Invoker.  So I usually start with blades of attack and a branch.  No regen is needed, but grab a set of tangoes if you have the extra 100g.\n\nI generally have phase boots by 3-4 mins, and probably get first blood or an early kill in my lane roughly 80% of the time.  After phase boots I will build drums, then Euls, then Scepter (Scepter is done by level 17 probably 95% of the time).  This does NOT require a ton of farm. \n\nForce Staff is a good item.  I get it.  You can do cute things with it and get one if you want, but I do just fine without it.  The stats it provides are useless.  Getting a sheep stick is also fine, but significantly more expensive than a Euls, and doesn't have as good of mana regen, nor does it provide the mobility of a Euls.  Tossing someone up in the air and dropping an ice wall underneath them is a guaranteed kill most of the time.\n\nIn nearly all of my games as Invoker, the only time I ever have to go back to the fountain is if I die.  Max Quas and the Euls scepter provide all the health/mana regen you'll ever need.  Wex/Drums/Euls give you INCREDIBLE mobility and allow you to be an asset to the team anywhere on the map very quickly.  Every time I see people play Exort invoker with a force staff and midas and other cute shit, they are always slow, half dead, and have no mana to actually use any of their skills.\n\nI consider myself to be a well above average Invoker.  I've tried Exort.  I've done the max Wex first for long tornadoes and quick EMPs.  I've tried it all.  Sometimes you'll have a team that bitches about your lack of sunstrike, and I understand that.  But even in my Invoker losses, I'm usually the most useful member of my team.  \n\nNot only that, but max Quas/Wex is a BITCH to push against.  My build doesn't allow me to straight up carry the team with damage, but between max QW Deafening Blast, max Q Ice Walls, SIX second Cold Snap stuns, and tornado, I am a giant pain in the ass to the other team.\n\nI realize that lots of the pro teams play Exort.  Do you know why that is?  They set up stuns/sunstrikes over voice chat and they've practiced the hell out of it.  You're not going to have that luxury in pubs.  So while you might get some DotaCinema sunstrikes 1 game in 10, my Quas build is useful in 10/10 games and I never EVER feed the other team easy kills like a squishy Exort invoker will.\n\nMeatballs are easy to dodge.

Basically science completely discredits this (look at the links below), so that's off the table. If you're going by religious grounds, then you should go with the Catholic position and Catholic agencies. So I really hate statements like :\n\n&gt;I am not saying the Courage is bad, but this organization is more about a scientific phychological perspective. They actually show reason to believe that same sex attraction is not something people are born with and could even recover from.\n\nBecause that tries to mixes up the two.\n\nAnyways:\n\n&gt; 1.) you state that repartive therapy has been discredited several times. I have to ask you where and for what reasons? This is what I mean when I say prove it. Show me where his therapy methods are harmful. I do not mean a simply statement by a person in authority, I mean an actual scientific study of people that have been through it. I am open to rejecting the methodology they use but the only things i have found the refute thier method are appeals to auhtority, not scientific study.\n\n* en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy\n* ^ Jason Cianciotto and Sean Cahill (2006).

Just go on the wikipedia page for more info.\n\n&gt; 2.) Where is he praying on parents and children? I have tried to research thier organization extensively and have not found any report of him luring anyone away from Courage or anything like that.\n\nBy going against the scientific community, and giving his firm a religious \"flavour\", he is enticing gullible parents who don't know much about the topic to use his services, which they assume are the Church's response to the \"gay culture\". He also continuously during this podcast criticizes Courage and the priests who administer it.\n\n&gt; 3.) I do not see how seeing Jesus as a male role model is nonsense. He was a man, and a role model. Why not a male role model? Is He not what we aspire to be as men?\n\nIt is because it reduces our entire Faith to us looking for a male role model. By his logic, I am only a Christian for lack of male role models in my life, or because I view Jesus as a male friend. I can't speak for anyone else, but this is far from the case for me, especially since I started my faith journey praying to \"God\" before learning to say \"In the name of Jesus\" or \"through Mary\" etc.\n\n&gt; 4.) I also do not see why his causes of homosexuality cannot be right. When people diagnose depression or bulumia it is due to the environment they are in or a tramatic even that happened to them. Why could homosexuality not be the same? There is no evidence that people are born homosexual. The best evidence out there has to do with twin studies which have ultimately proved inconclusive.\n\nAgain they could be right, and if you ask a psychologist they will just say : It is a combination of both genetic and environmental factors acting together, or you are predisposed to a trait, and environmental factors will determine whether or not to get it. This is the modern psychological thinking for, well, everything in that field almost.\nEDIT: for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model\n \nI could offer some counterexamples, however:\n\nThen again I'm sure that he could dig deep enough and find anything to go on with what he's saying. on this very podcast he goes from \"no male influence\" to \"bad male influence\" and \"bad sexual experience with males\" to \"not enough exposure to male sexuality, which makes him crave it\" and \"too much affection from mother\" to \"mother too controlling\". This clearly shows a lack of a coherent theory, much less any evidence for it.\n\n&gt; 5.) No where does he say that his practice or practive methods are a part of Catholic teaching. But niether are people practicing to help people get over depression or bulimia but we do not say they cannot associate with the Church.\n\nWell when these people will discredit the church alternatives as \"not scientific\" and are themselves at odds with the scientific community then we have to draw the line. Again I ask is he going with the scientific community against the church, or with the church against a social-political movement : It seems like he is trying to keep the impression that he is part of both, while being in opposition to both.\n\n&gt; 6.) There is no \"current science\" as you say about the causes of homosexuality. There is not even a genetic tendency toward becoming a homosexual. Like I stated in another post, anyone who even tries to do any kind of research on the topic is immediately called a bigot. They are denied funding from outside sources. I will admit that reparative therapy may not be the best methodology when dealing with this disorder, that does not mean it is not a mental disorder. However, any research into the topic in the academic circles is stopped immediately because of political reasons.\n\nagain above I mentioned the [current psychological stance] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model) on not only homosexuality, but other predespostions. For example we know of an Alcoholism \"gene\" as you call it. While not everyone who has it is an alcoholic, it increases your predisposition to becoming an alcoholic. I'm not affirming or denying the existence of a \"gay gene\" in the sense of a genetic predisposition to homosexuality. This doesn't matter. \n\nHowever psychologists almost universally agree that whatever the cause, you can't change it at the core level. You can repress it, and attempt to embrace heterosexual desires. But you can't get rid of it.\n\nAs for your second point, I agree that sometimes political correctness goes too far. Studies have shown that people are more okay with homosexuality if it was inherent rather than if it was a choice. As a scientist this shouldn't change the way one goes about conducting research.\n\n----\n\nAll this doesn't really matter in my opinion, as I view life and my religion as a personal thing, not a large scale one. Jesus called his disciples by name and went into individual sinners' houses, even though He didn't have to. Basically I don't think you will deny that people who live with homosexual desires have a very hard burden. As I mentioned in my reply to this post it is a hard cross to bear. You cannot begin to imagine how hard it is to be told at 20 years old that you MUST be alone your whole life, and that you are inherently disordered, so what you do is more wrong that what your friends and family do. In this troubled and difficult time we shouldn't be driving them to try crazy non-scientific \"therapies\" which will traumatize them. We should lead them to Christ by showing them the love that God showed us. When we have built that \"solid foundation\" of Christ everything else comes afterward. Take [this guy](http://thesheepfold.typepad.com/the_sheepcat/2009/03/a-changed-heart-part-1.html) who got married. \n\n&gt; They actually show reason to believe that same sex attraction is not something people are born with and could even recover from.\n\nSo yeah after all that I hope I showed you that we can't recover in the way you think, but we can make a bigger recovery.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352406751", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

However Sol Mi Sol is one of the most natural sounds to humans from a young age. So much so that it is what we teach children first in music. (I love You, You Love Me - Sol mi Sol, Sol mi Sol) Then you have the interval from Do to Sol which is called a perfect 5th.

We're reaching out here to bridge the gap and finish the 10%. Let us know if you find anything.\n\nOk in the Day 9 AFRAM folder is a video with a QR code in it. The QR leads to a string of numbers which decoded leads [here](http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/pac/IB/00/sc0/truth/kureze1.html) which might seem like the end of the puzzle, but it isn't. If you look in the source of that web page you'll find something odd. There are about 8000 lines of nothing and around like 4000 you get this string \"tamounbfsgekiztvhtusbksbzknztvhopngkxbefiuyvmtusbfxbeknztamopngksgefnzyahtungksgzknuyahtpsgfxgekizyvmtunbkxbzkiutamopnbksgekiztvhtunbfsgzknztvmtpsgksgzfizyvmtusbkxgzfnutamopnbksgefizyahtunbksgzfnuyamopsgfsgekizyvmtusbkxbeknztamopsgksgefnztvhtunbksgzknutvhtpsgksbzfizyvmopsbkxgzfnztvmousgfsgefiuyahtungkxgzknuyahtpngfxgekizyahopnbkxbzfiztamopngksbefnzyahtpngfsgzkiutvmopngfxgekiuyahopnbfxgzfiutvmousgksgekiuyahtunbfxgzfnztvhopngfxgekizyahtpnbkxgzfnutamtpsbksgekiztvhtungfsbzfnuyamtpsgfxbekizyahtpsbkxgzfnutamopsbksgeknuyvhtunbksgzfnztvhtpngfxgefizyvmopnbkxgzkiutamousbksgefnztv\" which might seem like one has just place their head on keyboard and went full fledged epileptic; but this is not the case friends. After a long about of trial and error we agree that [this](http://imgur.com/iDHls,yKjQK#1) is the correct way the string should be organized. If you look closely the COLUMNS of text there are only a few differences. each column has 1-2 letter and the letter are ALWAYS 5 letters apart from each other(EXAMPLE: V w x y z A). Now first we took a look at the columns and separated all 56 columns letters. [This](http://imgur.com/3Xixh) Is a list of the columns letter and how many of each of them there are. A while looking at this we determined that the 5 letter difference and the 56 columns was significant to we separated the the columns in to 0s(0 letter difference) and 5s(5 letter difference) and put it in a 7 bit format. and we got something that looks like this.\n\n05055555 05055555 00555555 05555555 05055555 05055555 05055555\n\nI look forward to what you guys come up with and sorry if I sounded a little long winded it's a lot to put into words. BTW we used a lot of binary and believe this is not a binary puzzle.

{"body": "well your question is a bit open ended. Its like asking \"what kind of nails do you use to build a house?\". Start by identifying what chord you're playing over and ask yourself a few questions about it. Is it major or minor? Is there a seventh? If so what kind? Is the fifth altered at all? Are there other extensions like a 9th, 11th or 13th? Are those altered at all?  Once you've figured that out you're much closer to identifying a good scale to use over that particular chord. For example let's look at C7. It's built using a C major triad with a minor seventh on top. So I'd start with C mixolydian, or an F major scale that starts and ends on C. Spelled out this scale is C D E F G A Bb C. To add more interesting colors to your improvisation throw in some chromatic passing tones, particularly Eb and F# or Gb. That's a decent starting point. I hope I helped and that I wasn't too confusing. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352650048", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Here's another way to think of it if you have trouble remembering a lot of shapes. Take a look at the chart for A minor Aeolian and C Major Ionian. These two scales have the same notes (C D E F G A B), and as a result the same shapes across the entire neck, the only difference is the tonal center, or root (the white dots on the OP's charts). So, if you learn C Major across the neck you've also effectively learned all of it's modes: D dorian, E phrygian, F lydian, G mixolydian, A aeolian, and B locrian.\n\nHere's a simplified example: You've learned the key of C Major (C D E F G A B C), and you're using it to jam over an A minor chord since all of the notes in the chord (A C E) are in the scale. Your ear will naturally want to focus around the chord tones (A C E), and all the other notes in the C Major scale will sound like they're leading you back to the chord tones. You are playing in A aeolian at that moment.\n\nOk, so lets say whatever you're jamming over changes to a G Major chord (G B D), you wouldn't need to change the scale shape you're playing since all of the chord tones are still in the C Major scale. What will change is the way your ear will want to focus on the new chord tones (G B D) and the way the other notes in the scale will lead you to them. You are now playing in G mixolydian.\n\nRecord some loops of different chords and practice soloing over it and you'll hear what I mean. This works with any scale that has the same notes as the chord. So if you were playing an A minor chord (A C E) you could use the keys of C, F, or G major to solo since those keys all have the notes A, C, and E in them.\n\nMuch respect to the OP for making these charts, I made them too back in the day and just the act of making them is a great way of pulling it all together. The Grimiore is great for learning scale formulas (I own most of the series), but after a while you'll notice that it's page after page of the same shapes, just moved around the neck. Truth be told the book could probably be about 500 pages shorter if you took out all of the redundancy. B Major is the same shape on guitar as C Major, just one fret lower.\n\nHope this is helpful, I'd be more than happy to clarify if it's still confusing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352652548", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

We do a lot of exercises where there's a line of b b b b q b b d p b q b d d d p etc and they have to pick out all the \"b\"s (or other letters). There are many variations on this, and having the child practice writing the letters and making the sound at the same time helps. \n\nThere's a lot of going through the alphabet with sounds rather than letter names, practising short vowel sounds with images (like a a a apple, e e e elf, i i i ink, o o o office, u u u upside down!). Having a sheet for reference with the letter and the image right beside you for these is really helpful when you're trying to get them to sound out words. \n\nFiguring out rhyming patterns can be really helpful too - if they understand that when they see -en it's going to have that certain sound, it will be easier to sight read ten, hen, pen, etc. \n\nWe also look at beginning and ending sounds - having a bunch of pictures and finding all the ones that start with \"s\" or \"l\" or \"k\", and then exercises where they find all the ones that *end* with those sounds. \n\nI think this is one thing that really depends on the parents - picking up reading and writing isn't like picking up language in general, you can't really do it unless someone's teaching you.

{"body": "With the C F G, its all to do with playing to the chords, and within the key.\n\nWhen playing over a chord, playing the root of the chord will sound at home, playing the 3rd will express the major/minor quality of the chord etc.\n\nSo when anything is played over chord the harmonies + feeling created with the note are related to the underlying chord.  The chord in this instance is setting the context.\n\nTaking that on board, when playing over a C F G progression, the scales I would use would be C something, F something and G something.\n\nThat way I know I my scale will match the chord at the time, the roots are the same, the 3rd's, 7ths etc have the same function. i.e. I can take my knowledge of the scale and apply it to the chord.\n\nWorking out what those somethings are is more interesting.\n\nIf C F G is the whole information we are to use, the simplest way / scale choice to perhaps solo over that would be the C major, F major, G major scales.\n\nThat would work, each scale will nail the sound of the chord and nothing will sound wrong.\n\nHowever, on the whole as a progression basis it may sound \"out there\", to explain why the scales can be compared:\n\n    C major : C D E F G A B  C D E F  G A B  C...\n    F major :       F G A Bb C D E F  G A Bb C D E F...\n    G major :         G A B  C D E F# G...\n\nThis shows two inconsistencies:\n\n* F major has a Bb whereas C + G major have a B\n* G major has an F# whereas C and G have an F.\n\nThese notes chopping and changing will create a more inconsistent feel across the progression if we choose these scale to improvise.\n\nConsistency is good, its easy on the listener and safe, which means a better approach to improvising over this is needed.  \n\nThis approach would be would be to introduce / pay attention to the key.  \n\nThe key will bring in a common palette of sounds / notes.  It standardises everything and through convention we can quickly work out what can sound good given the functional roles of the chords.\n\nIts safe to say that this song is in the key of C, I have specified that already to begin with and also, looking at the notes of the chord, apparent structure of the progression it all shouts for the key of C.\n\nThis key provides a palette of standard notes which happen to be the same as C major: (I have given them numbers)\n\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    C D E F G A B\n\nFrom here we know all these chords are in key and C major contains a complete palette of notes.\n\nNow, what scales to improvise over these chords with.\n\nA simple way which alot of people first see is the key of C and therefore C major over the whole progression.\n\nTechnically this works, none of the notes clash however, we are forgetting about the playing to the chords.  \n\nC major scale has a root / home note of C, the 3rd E makes a major / happy sound over the C, but over the F the C now makes a fairly meaningless ambivalent sound, and the E gives us a dissonant clashy sound.\n\nConsequently, if C major is used over the F and G chords it will sound lost, the melody wont quite know what its doing.\n\nThe solution is to play C major, but rearrange the notes / root per chord.  \n\nSo over the C, C major can be played.  Over the F the C major from the F can be played (i.e. F G A B C D E F) and Likewise for the G, C major can be played but from G (i.e. G A B C D E F G)\n\nNow that works, sounds consistent and really nails the chord. \n\nHowever... Saying C major from G is a little long in the tooth.  Also, its a little confusing, answering a question like what role does the 3rd note of C major from G have in relation to the chord is difficult.\n\nWhats going wrong here is we are still referring to C major but half translating it on the fly something different.  Given we will do this all the time on almost every progression, its wasted effort.\n\nBring in modes to save the day *swoosh*.\n\nRather than say, C major from F, we can say. The forth mode of C major (given F is the 4th note).  Still a bit long... fortunately they all have names, so the 4th mode of C major is Lydian.  \n\nThe G is the 5th note of C major, so the 5th mode is G mixolydian.\n\nNow we can say over C F G, we will use C major, F Lydian and G mixolydian.\n\nThis may seem like an over complicated solution, however...\n\nIt becomes powerful because it suites our original way of thinking, i.e. C something, F something, G something.\n\nJust having an idea with those modes, we know the root chords etc and we can start applying our knowledge of the scale properly to the chord.  \n\nWe can then abstract this futher.\n\nComparing F major to F lydian:\n\n    F Major : F G A Bb C D E F\n    F Lydian: F G A B  C D E F\n\nThe F lydian has the natural B (like C major) however, F major has a Bb.  The forth note of Lydian has this B raised by one, or to put it in numbers F Lydian has a #4.\n\nThis difference is what separates the sound of F major and F Lydian.  \n\nSo if we are playing F lydian, this is an important note to convey what F lydian is all about as its a defining part of its character.\n\nLikewise, G major and G mixolydian:\n\n    G major      : G A B C D E F# G\n    G mixolydian : G A B C D E F  G\n\nThis time G major has an F# whereas G mixolydian has this lowered by 1 / an F, i.e. we can say G mixolydian has a b7. This is a major defining characteristic of G mixolydian.\n\nSo this is powerful because when it comes to the C F G progression,  over the F if I play F Lydian and play the 4th note, i.e. the special #4 that defines lydian, it will sound cool.\n\nOver the G when playing G mixolydian if I play the 7th note, i.e. the special b7 that defines mixolydian, it will sound cool.\n\nTheres only 7 modes here, so we know per mode which notes sound good and which sound washy.\n\nAnd thats whats so powerful, over the C F G saying C major, F Lydian, G mixolydian we refer to the underlying scale/notes in such a way that we all the root notes, we know which notes per mode sound cool and which sound boring/ambivalent and it really helps up to express the flow of the progression.\n\nReally starting to go off on one now... \n\nWhere it becomes extremely powerful is when notes outside the key are included.\n\nFor example, what happens if the G was a G augmented chord.\n\nThe aug tells us the chord's fifth is raised by 1 step.  I.e. the D in G major is now a D#.\n\nThat D# conflicts with the D in C major / G mixolydian.  It conflicts with the key, however, the music specifies it so we need to adapt.\n\nWhat we can do is say we'd usually play G mixolydian over the D chord there, so change it to match the chord.\n\nSo we can play G mixolydian with a #5.\n\nThis is a compromise between the consistency of the key/the palette it defines and the chord at the time.\n\nIt sounds complicated, but we know G mixolydian already, its just sharpening 1 note.  Or even just playing an arpeggio and play a D# will sound good.\n\nSo we have a complex messed up chord in a progression making it all very odd, but given the standard knowledge of the Key, the major scale and mixolydian, to handle it well all that needs to be done is change 1 note up a fret, which is quite easy.\n\nModes mean alot of things to alot of people.  For me they provide a simple way to hide away known chunks of standard theory under a name.  It allows me to free you mind up to focus on the odd things going on that need attention.\n\nPractically, learning C major then Focusing on the G and the F, arpeggios etc is a good start.   Given time / practice and some of the things I talked about in my first post you can et an understanding about all the notes that are different between say G major, minor, lydian, harmonic minor etc, #4's etc, b7s and whatnotes, everything can become much more fluidic.\n\nOne thing to remember theory is great, but it does not translate into playing.  Playing with the major scale and trying to nail chord tones with your ear will get you far.  Where this theory becomes handy is either trying to understand or communicate things in front of you or discovering new sounds which you / your ear may not realise but you can absorb into your playing.\n\n**EDIT** Jeez, sorry for the essay...  I think I may have got carried away a bit there, but I wanted to try and explain things simply / why certain things work\n\n**TL;DR** Play to the chords\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1352985985", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let me try to answer it this way \"  Is there a simple explanation for using the scales over simple rock chord progressions. Say for example we're just jamming\" . I would say that a scale would just be a linear version of a chord, which is not a bad thing. An important motif of the style is to look at the upper structure of a chord, so for your example Dm -imagine 10 fingers on the piano D F A C E G B D , try playing the notes of one of the other triads, C or Em for example, this will broaden the sound of Dm to Dm 9 or 11 or 13. Then when you apply the scale to travel to and from these places, you have a destination other than tonic, say Dm  notes EGB A G F E D -something like that. \n For the G chord, if we stack thirds it looks like this  GBDFACEGB  -so we could play a dm an f maj or an am triad over the top and arrive at a dominant 9, dom 11 or dom 13 chord and then use the scale to travel back down -or vice versa -you know, just for an example. So G7 -dfacbagfg -something like that.

{"body": "For flight...very unlikely.  The Earth's magnetic field is something like 30 to 60 microteslas at the surface of the Earth (depending on your latitude), which is minuscule.  For reference, the superconducting electromagnets used to control the proton beam at the LHC are on the order of 10 Teslas...so about a million times stronger.  And those take CRAZY amounts of power and resources to operate, plus they're pretty massive.\n\nBut sure, just for kicks, let's work this out to see what it would take, in as simple a way as possible (everyone, please let me know when I make assumptions or mistakes that are inaccurate!).  First, let's start with the general principle here.  Magnetic fields exert forces when there are charged objects moving through them (there is of course a lot of nuance to that statement, but for simplicity let's just take it at face value), and the force is always perpendicular to both the field, and the motion of the object.  So, in the case of a flying object, we need the force to point AWAY from the Earth, to counter gravity.\n\nProblem is, this force would just keep it in the air, it wouldn't propel it forward.  In fact, the object would already HAVE to be moving forward for it to work in the first place.  So an object will still need some form of propulsion, like a propellor or jet engine.  All the magnetic field would do is keep it up...which is what wings on planes already manage to do quite well.  So why would we try to do this?  Well, one reason I can think of is to reduce the aerodynamic profile of the object, and thus reduce drag.  But I'll get to why that also is unlikely to really matter.\n\nSo back to this force idea.  Let's say we're travelling east along the equator (a simple case, since now the Earth's magnetic field is pointing more or less due north, though the field is weaker), and we want our object stay in the air due to this magnetic force (we'll give it the more accepted term and call it the Lorentz force).  Basically, it is a product of the charge, the velocity it is moving at, and the strength of the magnetic field it is moving through.  And the direction of the force comes from applying a cross-product (I'm not sure what your math/physics background is, but google the 'right hand rule' for a visual).  So q x v x B.  For an object moving as fast as a Boeing 747 (roughly 900 km/h, or 250 m/s), our force is q x 250 x 0.00003.  So q is going to have to be big, but how big?\n\nLet's stick with the 747 idea, and basically say our object has the same mass.  The new 747-8 has a maximum takeoff mass of about 440,000 kg, but we'll assume we're not at the maximum, and we'll just round it to 400,000 (again, for simplicity).  This is important because we need to know the gravitational force that our Lorentz force has to counter.  So 400,000 x 9.81 (acceleration due to gravity, where Newton's second law is applied), is 3,924,000 Newtons.  Which is a hell of a lot of Newtons.  So, equating this to our Lorentz force equation about to solve for q (the charge), q has to be 0.5232 gigacoulombs.  That is...immense.  I mean, that is so unbelievably big it's ridiculous.  There are probably BIG ramifications to this.\n\nSo first, to apply this charge to our object (no idea how we would...), let's say we had a metal frame, with the charge evenly distributed.  Also, it has to hold a lot of people, like a 747 (let's say 300 people), so it has to be fairly big.  In fact, let's make it simple and say it's a sphere (which is REALLY bad for aerodynamic drag).  Working this out on paper with the idea of packing these people like cattle, I'd say at minimum we'd need a 10 m radius sphere.  The biggest problem here, I'm going to guess, is that we've exceeded breakdown voltage of the surrounding air.  Look at take-off for example.  Let's say this big sphere is about 3 meters above the ground (landing gear).  Assuming the ground is...well...grounded, that means we have a voltage difference between the sphere and the ground of about 1 x 10^17 volts.  Yikes.  The breakdown voltage in dry air is 33 kV/cm, or 9.9 MV over the distance between the sphere and the ground.  We've exceeded that...by a lot.  So we are going to get one HELL of a spark, that will completely ionize the air under the sphere, probably heating it up to a plasma and in turn melting the sphere and everyone inside it.  So that sucks.\n\nWhat if we somehow get it up to altitude?  So at 30,000 feet (9000 meters), the voltage difference (I'm skipping a lot of details here, but I think the main idea still holds) could only be as high as 27 gigavolts.  We still exceed that by a TON.  So...this is not a very good idea, basically.  It would look pretty spectacular, but the result would not be altogether pleasant.\n\nOn a happier note, we are starting to use the earth's magnetic field for propulsion in space.  It's called a [tether](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_tether), and at the moment it's mostly experimental.  But it relies on the idea of using a current (and the surrounding plasma in Earth's orbit) to interact with the magnetic field and drive the tether forward.  It's a very small force, and very limited in where it can be applied, but still cool.  I think it's one of the most promising ideas for how to effectively deorbit satellites when their lifetimes are up.\n\nDamn that was long, and sorry for all the wild simplifications.  But basically, this is why we still use planes with wings.\n\nEDIT:  I didn't address the electromagnet idea because I don't think even the concept would work; the earth's magnetic field would just align the magnet to its direction (slowly...), but not actually cause it to lift or move.  And applying a current would also be implausible, as any setup would necessarily involve a current LOOP, which would have zero net force exerted upon it by the Earth's magnetic field, no matter the size of the loop or current.  Unless it's a GIGANTIC loop that is anchored say in the middle of the US, and spins in the Earth's field such that it could deliver people from one coast to the other...but that's just being silly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353063551", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Note : just read the first lines of this post ;)\n\nI just read the wikipedia article and a part of the PDF, and there is no such stupidity in it that can be resumed as you did : \"Even though a fetus's brain activity does not begin until after birth\". They are talking about foetal pain and asking themselves if it exists and if you read what you pretend to have read : \"Much public concern has arisen because of the possibility that a fetus may âfeelâ pain; such a possibility is founded on the existence of reflex movements and neural activity produced by sensory stimulation. Despite the usefulness of such reflexes in understanding spinal cord and brain stem pain processing, it would be a mistake to equate them with true pain experience which must involve the cortex and develop postnatally\nalong with memory, anxiety and other cognitive brain functions.\" \n\nSooooooooooo (moron) it means that even if they think \"it\" (the existence of reflex movements and neural activity produced by sensory stimulation) cannot be equate with pain, well \"it\" exists and thus cerebral activity before birth too so you are fucking wrong saying : \"fetus's brain activity does not begin until after birth\". Poor engineer's daughter unable to read, let your mummy think for the family.\n\nAs I said, thinking the brain activity begins right after birth is a magical thought and is as scientific as the idea of a God snapping its fingers to create the light before the sun.\n\nOh, god I finally have the time to see that you are fuuull of shit. Your article state (about psychiatrists) : \"The current law, which dates from 1985, allows abortion in the first 12 weeks in case of rape, 22 weeks in case of fetal malformation, and at any time if a psychiatrist certifies that the mother's physical or mental health is endangered.\" So no nothing about what you said : \"the law in spain required the permission of a psychiatrist before an abortion could take place.\" You don't understand the meaning of sourcing. So the psy is required for late-term abortion and not for all of them. Anyway According to your disgusting way of thinking I don't even know why you care for a psychiatrist to be here, the woman wants it, she gets it and nobody is hurt after all the foetus has no cerebral activity :) and apparently the ex-future mother either.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353182402", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Terminal velocity really only makes sense for falling objects, because it is the velocity at which the air drag and gravity cancel each other such that no further acceleration can be achieved by the system. \n\n\nWith that cleared, let's answer your question and first consider a ball falling in mid air. The KEY point here is that air drag increases as velocity increases. We can see it from the equation:\n\nFdrag = 0.5 x d x V x V x C x A (We desperately need better equation formatting. This is ASK SCIENCE for crying out loud.)\n\nwhere Fdrag is the force of drag, d is the fluid (air) density, v is velocity of the ball, C is the coefficient of drag of (which also happens to increase with speed but we wont get into that. check Wikipedia if you're interested), and A is, in simplistic terms, the surface area that is being 'hit' with air (i.e the back of the falling ball isn't really being hit with air as much as the front). Don't worry about the details though. The point is: \n\nYou can see that if velocity of the ball increases, the air drag (Fdrag) of the ball increases exponentially, so it gets harder and harder to move through the air even with slight velocity increases. Thus we have force of gravity and drag force competing against each other, but eventually drag force catches up with the force as gravity as it approaches a certain velocity, terminal velocity.\n\nNow we consider a rolling ball. With a rolling ball, what we are looking at now is the kinetic friction of the ball we need to overcome and the ball's momentum. Which brings us to the second KEY: friction does NOT increase as velocity or momentum increases. It is essentially this little barrier that must be overcome. We can see it from the equation:\n\nFfriction = C*Fg\n\nwhere Ffriction is the force of friction acting on the rolling ball, C is the coefficeint of friction which depends on the materials involved, and Fg is the force of gravity exerted on the ball perpendicular to the surface (mass*9.8m/s^2). As momentum or velocity increases, there is NO factor in this equation that says the force of friction should increase. They are independent. So once the ball is rolling, we know that it's momentum/force in the rolling direction is greater than the frictional force, and can now theoretically speed up without bound. So there is no 'terminal velocity' with friction.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353259231", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a ridiculously complicated topic &amp; the subject of numerous textbooks. But I'll try to give a quick overview.\n\nModern popular music typically consists of a series of chords with a melody placed \"on top\" of the series. The notes of the melody sound best to us when they are identical to one of the notes in the underlying chord. But only a boring melody would be made up *only* of notes from the underlying chord (\"Taps\" or \"Day Is Done,\" is one such melody). Melodies generally also have \"passing tones\" and \"suspensions\" in them, notes that *aren't* part of the underlying chord but are used as a stepping stone to get from or to a note that is. For instance, the first phrase of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" in the key of C is played over a C major chord and goes: E D C D E E E. In that phrase the E notes and the C note are part of the C major triad. The two D notes are passing tones used to get from E to C and back again. \n\nSo what does this have to do with harmony? Well, the simplest of harmonies is just to repeatedly sing one of the other notes from the underlying chord alongside the melody. For instance, in \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" a possible harmony might be just to sing G G G G G G G, since the note G is the third note, along with C and E, in the C major triad. \n\nAnother more interesting technique is for the harmony to follow along with the melody at a given interval. The most common interval to use for this is the interval of a third. (It used to be considered bad form in Western Classical music for a harmony to follow along at a distance of a fourth or a fifth, but this rule is rarely observed strictly any longer.) So in the \"Mary\" example, another harmony might go: C B A B C C C. All those notes are a third below the notes of the main melody. \n\nBut notice that not only are the B notes of this harmony line not part of the underlying C major triad, and are therefore passing tones, but also the A note is not part of the C major triad either. So a more traditional move might be to have the harmony line go C B **G** B C C C. The interval between the G note here and the note it harmonizes, C, is a fourth. But it sounds a bit better &amp; more traditional because those two notes, C &amp; G, establish the C triad and are the most important notes of the C major scale.\n\nThe most interesting harmonies, though, may do something very different from the main melody. For instance, C G G B C B C. In this case, while the melody moves down a whole step, E to D, the harmony jumps down a fourth, C to G. Then when the melody moves down another whole step, D to C, the harmony instead chooses to stay on the same note, G G. When at the end of the phrase, \"little lamb,\" the melody repeats the E note three times, the harmony instead refuses to repeat, moving C B C. So the harmony is deliberately trying to counter the melody.\n\nTL; DR. Harmony is complicated. When in doubt, though, choose a tone from the underlying chord.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353412254", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Two ways: \n\n- One is to learn the sequence of whole steps and half steps of your major and minor scales.  A half step is one note to the next possible note, like C to D-flat (minor 2nd).  A whole step is when there's one note in the middle, like C to D (major 2nd).  I'll say W for whole and H for half.  The sequence of whole steps and half steps in a major scale is W W H W W W H.  The sequence of whole steps and half steps in a natural minor scale is  W H W W H W W.\n\n- The other thing you should learn is your circle of 5ths.  Play a C major scale.  No sharps or flats.  Now, move up to the 5th note of the C major scale, G.  Now play a G major scale: G A B C D E **F#** G.  You added a sharp.  Each time you move up a 5th, you raise a note.  The note that you raise is always the 7th note of the scale.  From G, the 5th note up is D.  In a D major scale, we're going to keep the sharp that we added in the previous scale (F#) and raise a new note.  Remember, the new note that we're raising is always the 7th note of the scale.  A D major scale is like this: D E F# G A B **C#** D.  Lets go up one more 5th, from D to A.  We'll keep the F# and C# that we added in the previous scales, and we'll add a new one.  As always, the new raised note will be the 7th note of the scale.  A B C# E F# **G#** A.  This pattern repeats over and over.  You can also do the circle of 5ths backwards.  What happens if you go from G down a 5th to C?  instead of raising a note, you'll lower a note.  The note that's lowered is always the 4th note of the scale.  So G major has G A B C D E F# G.  From G, we move down a 5th to C.  Now we'll lower the 4th note: C D E **F** G A B C.  What happens if we move down another 5th from C to F?  We lower the 4th note.  F G A **B-flat** C D E F.  Lets move down one more 5th from F to B-flat.  Remember, we're going to lower the 4th note.  B-flat major is B-flat C D **E-flat** F G A B-flat.\n\nSo there's the circle of 5ths.\n\nYou can learn your minor scales by comparing them to major scales.  There's parallel minor and relative minor.  There are a few types of minor scales, but for now lets just stick with natural minor.  If you want to learn harmonic minor and melodic minor let me know and I'll explain.\n\n-Parallel minor: Take a major scale and turning that major scale into a minor scale.  Do this by lowering the 3rd, 6th, and 7th scale degrees.  C major: C D E F G A B C.  C minor: C D **E-flat** F G **A-flat** **B-flat** C.\n\n-Relative minor.  For each major scale, there is a natural minor scale that shares the same notes.  Play a major scale, but start and end on the 6th scale degrees instead of the 1st.  So the relative minor of C major (C D E F G A B C) is A minor (A B C D E F G A).  One more.  The relative minor of G major (G A B C D E F# G) is E minor (E F# G A B C D E).\n\nHope this helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353449145", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, if you're just playing those scales as an isolated thing, harmonic minor is like a natural minor with a raised 7th (C D E-flat F G A-flat **B** C).  The augmented 2nd between the 6th and 7th scale degrees are what makes it sound \"ethnic.\"  The reason harmonic minor exists is because in a natural minor scale, the dominant chord is a minor chord (lower case v).  Except, we don't typically use the dominant like that.  We typically make it major because the major third of the dominant (7th scale degree) gives you a strong leading tone to the tonic.  So lets take C minor for example.  C natural minor is C D E-flat F G A-flat B-flat C.  If we build a chord from the 5th scale degree, we'd have our dominant (G B-flat D).  That's a minor chord, but we typically will raise the third of that chord (B-flat) up half a step (B).  So instead of G B-flat D (v) we have G B D (V).  It just gives you a stronger pull to the tonic.  Make sense?  I hope I'm explaining it alright.\n\nMelodic minor is a natural minor scale with a raised 6th and 7th scale degree on the way up but a lowered 6th and 7th scale degree on the way down.  C D E-flat F G A B C B-flat A-flat G F E-flat D C.  Think of the bass line to Hit the Road Jack: C - B-flat - A-flat - G - AB - C.  I tried to kind of show the rhythm there.  Also, I'm not sure what key that tune is in, but that's basically how the bassline goes.  On your way up, melodic minor gives you a strong pull to the tonic and on the way down it gives you a strong pull to the dominant.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353463307", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not an expert on this, but I'll try:\nThere is a very easy way of making a group (set + operation), which is a 2-group. A 2-group is a group in which for every g in the group, there is an n such that g^(2^n) = e. Imagine e as the 'basic' element, that every group must contain. We know that every g eventually arrives at e, if you just keep going g o g o g ..., it's just that in a 2-group it always happens in 2^n steps.\n\nWe can show that if the order (size) of a group is 2^n, then it is a 2-group. This means all groups of size 1024 are 2-groups. \n\nTry to imagine why there are so many (I'm not sure if this is correct, so correct me if I'm wrong).\nAn easy 2-group is where for every element: g^2 = e. A little more complex is to have a single element g^4 = e, this forces 2 more to have g^4 = e, but oh well. then you can take one of those to g^8 = e, or you can take another to g^4 = e.  In the first case, you can take another to g^4 = e, or g^8 = e, or g^16 = e, etc... This quickly blows up, as I hope you can see.\n\nFor other groups this isn't as easy, because they aren't such nice prime divisors. 1920 = 2^7 * 3 * 5 has a lot of groups that are almost 2-groups, because of the many factors of 2, but not nearly the same about as 1024 = 2^10.\nKeep in mind this blows up VERY FAST. For example, for 3^10 we would expect to see a similar result as 2^10, if not more. For example look at 729 = 3^6. That actually has more groups than 64 = 2^6. The only reason 2 has such an advantage it's because the powers of two are much lower than other powers. 3^10 is already 59049, and by that time we've arrived at 2^15, which, as you might imagine, has LOADS more groups than 3^10.

{"body": "Well this might seem like it works, it really doesn't.  Cookies have nothing to do with airline prices.  Airline prices are not set via the web.\n\nIndividual sites like Expedia, Travelocity, and Cheap Tickets do not set their own prices.  Each airline sets its own ticket prices, and each airlines prices are generally in line with every other airlines prices for any particular routing.\n\nHere is a simplified explanation of how it works.  Let's say the routing is Atlanta to Chicago.  Within the routing you will have several classes of service, Y B M H Q T V E or something like that.  There will be so many seats available under each of those classes, and they are priced in reverse order.  So E would be the cheapest, and let's say that was $210, once all the E seats were sold out, it would move to the next class V, and that might be $250.  Once those were gone it would move to the next class T, $290, and so on, until it got to Y, and that ticket might be $1200, Y is also referred to as full fare. The price difference between the classes of service is not always the same amount.\n\nNow if the person wanted a refundable ticket, those are generally the Y B and M classes.  Once you get up to these classes the fares increase dramatically.\n\nSo when you book a ticket online, it is going out to the airline reservation system, looking at the availability on the flight you picked, and then looking at the fare rules for that flight,  and then displaying the results to you.  There is no criteria for, this person looked at a flight, then looked at a picture of a cat, let's charge him more for doing that.\n\nWhat you are most likely seeing, is when you did you initial search a lower priced fare was available, but maybe only 1 seat at that fare.  When you went back that seat was no longer available and then you saw the next higher class of service that was available at that time.\n\n99.9% of the time the fares will be the same for the same flight, same day, same routing, if booked at the same time, whether you purchased directly from the airlines website, through a global distribution system (GDS) (airline reservation computers), through a 3rd party (Expedia, Travelocity), using Chrome, Firefox, etc...(normal or incognito mode).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353600525", "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

I know I've definitely come close with some Naniwa MLG games or HerO's Dreamhack win.....\n\nBut I think this one takes it. Since the first few days Grubby began streaming ~1.5 years ago (already a good 3 or 4 months into sc2 maybe a little more) I remember checking out his stream because of the higher than usual stream numbers for a protoss other than White-Ra. And even tho he was clearly not playing nearly on the highest level, there was still so much to watch. He played very much in his own way even back then. He would lose a lot of games but he would do it in a way that you knew he had near infinite potential. He would then go on to entertain for countless hours on his stream, doing battle with his internet cup rival Stephano and even defeating him once or twice in epic bo7's. Now after all this time, to see him here today realizing that potential is really something special. Just wanna say thankyou to you Grubby and goodluck.\n\nBut as I finish writing this it seems it may be a bit premature. Although defeating MC like that in an ace match with both your tournament lives on the line did in fact feel like a finals, there's still 2 matches to go. I have absolute faith that this is more than just possible to accomplish. I actually feel very similar to how I did as Grubby was going into the first game just now against MC. Its a strong optimistic feeling, I know he can do this, and yet incredibly nervous at the same time. Luckily tho Grubby not only appears to be at the peak of his sc2 career in terms of skill, but also at the top of his mental game. Incredibly balls deep strats that you rarely ever see in a high level PvP, especially one so deep into a major tournament. If he can continue the path he's been on then there is no doubt in my mind Grubby will be the next IEM champion.

{"body": "We use symbols to represent quantities. Try to remember that, what we usually call numbers are just symbols someone made up that reflect certain amounts or quantities. It's not practical to have a different symbol for every single quantity. Imagine having to learn all of those! Sort of like using a new letter for every idea in a language. Instead, we use a certain number of symbols and combine them in new ways. Our usual numbering system, called \"decimal,\" uses ten symbols, 0123456789. When we reach a quantity greater than nine, we start  combining symbols. 10 represents one ten and zero ones. 48 represents four tens and eight ones. Two symbols used this way can represent quantities up to 99, then we have to add another. 100 represents one hundred, zero tens, and zero ones. 649 represents six hundreds, four tens, and nine ones. And so on. The rightmost digit will always be how many ones (for whole numbers with no decimal point). The next digit to the left will always be how many tens there are, and so on.\n\nYou can represent the same quantities using a different amount of symbols. What if instead of stopping at 9 we made up a new number symbol that represented the amount that is one more than 9? And we could do it again to represent the amount one greater than that? Let's say we use new symbols to represent quantities all the way up to six more than nine, the quantity that we call in decimal \"15\". Let's make these symbols be ABCDEF. So we'll count like this: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F. So with one symbol we can represent quantities up to what we usually think of as fifteen. Then we run out of symbols so we start combining. 10 will be the symbols we use to represent the next amount. In this case, the one indicates we have one \"sixteen\" and the zero means zero ones. 11 would be one \"sixteen\" and one one. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19. 19 represents one \"sixteen\" and nine ones. The next one will be 1A. Remember A represents one more than nine, what we call in decimal \"ten\". So 1A would equal a decimal 26 (one \"sixteen\" and ten ones). Counting further: 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F 30 31 32... And on and on. The rightmost digit represents how many ones, the next to the left represents how many \"sixteens\". We can count up to FF (decimal fifteen sixteens and fifteen ones or 255). Then we reuse symbols and call the quantity 100, which represents one \"256\", zero \"16's\" and zero ones. The basic concept is that you make up symbols to represent quantities, then combine those symbols to represent greater and greater quantities. The example above is called hexadecimal and is used in real life in MAC addresses and the new IP addresses in computer networking.\n\nBinary works exactly the same, but instead of ten or sixteen symbols there are only two: 0 and 1. With two symbols we can represent two quantities without repeating, zero and one. Above that we start combining. Counting up: 0 1 10. In this case 10 means you have one \"two\" and zero ones. Next is 11 or one \"two\" and one one, which in decimal is called \"3\". Out of symbols again. 100 is next and represents one \"four\", zero \"twos\", and zero ones. Counting up: 101 110 111. 111 represents one \"four\", one \"two\" and one one, or a decimal \"seven\". Out of symbols again. 1000 represents one \"eight\", zero \"fours\", zero \"twos\", and zero ones. Counting up:  1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111. The last represents one \"eight\", one \"four\", one \"two\" and one one, or a decimal \"fifteen\".  Out of symbols again. Next is 10000 which represents one \"sixteen\", zero \"eights\", zero \"fours\", zero \"twos\", and zero ones. And so on.\n\nIn any numbering system, the numbers being reused to the left represent the square of the number of symbols being used. In decimal 1 10 100 100 each time we add a symbol, the leftmost (most significant) digit is multiplied by ten. In hexadecimal, it multiplies by \"sixteen\". 1=1 10= 16 100=256 1000=4096. In binary it multiplies by \"two\". 1=1 10=2 100=4 1000= 8.\n\nNow, if I have been successful in explaining it, you can understand the nerdiest joke ever: There are 10 kinds of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.\n\nHope this helps; it sounded better in my head.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353779344", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't like the current answers, so I'm hopping in.\n\nFirst off, `words` is not a string.  The first line (`words = 'ant baboon ` . . .) is assigning a **list of strings** to a variable called `words`.  It does this by using the `split()` function of the string type, which breaks up the string on whitespace and returns the resulting separate strings as a list.  You can see this in action on your interactive interpreter by doing something like this:\n\n    'a b c d e f g'.split()\n\nwhich will yield this output\n\n    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']\n\nSo after that line in the code, you have this list of words stored in the `words` variable.\n\nThe next part is a function definition.  The function is called `getRandomWord` and it takes an argument, which is referred to *within the function* as `wordList`.  Since python is a dynamically typed language, it doesn't state that the parameter passed in should be a list of strings, however the function is written in such a way that it assumes the passed in value is a list of strings, hence the comment on the first line.\n\nNow your `wordList` argument on the function is whatever was passed in when the function is called.  So you can call the function like this:\n\n    getRandomWord(words)\n\nbecause `words` is a list of strings, or you can call it like this:\n\n    getRandomWord(['these', 'are', 'some', 'words'])\n\nWhich just passes a **literal** list of strings.  Then the code inside the function uses that `wordList` variable to refer to whatever was passed to it.  In the first example, `wordList` is the same list of words as `words`, in the second example `wordList` is the list I created right there in the function call.\n\n`words` and `wordList` aren't really related, save for the fact that `words` is a list of strings, and `wordList` is supposed to take a list of strings as a parameter.\n\nEDIT: By the way, I highly recommend getting familiar with the interactive python console, and testing cases like this in it to see what's happening in real time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353789663", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Hawaii was considering a bill to recognize marriage equality and DOMA and the politicization of marriage were the result.\n\nPerhaps ironically - the gay community that is fighting for marriage equality and our allies that are fighting with us are doing so because Karl Rove and the republicant's thought they they could (and they did) win an election by using it as a wedge issue.\n\nI'm 45.  When I was growing up I explicitly remember - for years and years - bemoaning the, what was then, fact that I would never have a family and a husband.  Today it's within reach - and whatever other issues the community has - marriage equality is undeniably an excellent step forward.\n\nAs for dividing the country?  Not really.  There's only one argument against marriage equality.  It's spelled R E L I G I O N.  We'll get that straightened out straight away and the religionists will hopefully crawl back into their holes.\n\nWhat's in it for minorities?  Well, insurance for one.  It only takes one person in the relationship that has a job that has insurance to cover both if marriage equality is passed federally and DOMA is struck down.  A minority partner with AIDS that has a partner with insurance is undoubtedly in a better position than one with a partner w/out insurance.\n\nI'm sure I could think of other benefits.  But exclusive of that - there's no reason that we can't work for marriage equality and other goals at the same time.

Good examples of exceptional cadence imo would be method man/redman/GZA. Speaking of flow and that natural live spirited feel. I think what you ought to work on is to create more excitement throughout the song, and dat would happen if ya switched up the rhythm of your flow more exceptionally or alternate it instead of dragging out a bar that has one less syllable. I assume you do this a bit, but in fast rap its more impressive to change the flow or alternate the flow in your bars exceptionally. You can do this writing wise by alternating the amount of syllables in the bars. Like hypothetically First two bars have 8 syllables (Bar A) then next couple bars has 12 (Bar B) then alternate A B A B or you can throw in more variety. Like ABCBBAACCABC. I'm not sure why this is directed at you but just kinda something the first few bars made me want to say. The more you can naturally change the flow, and get really into the beat the more it will show your dominance over the beat and really every rapper will get the most gain from working on these two things.

{"body": "Lyric writing is pretty straight forward.  You just want to be specific: name name's, paint a picture with your words.  Think about your favorite songs, likely they are very specific and descriptive: Eleanor Rigby, My Father's Gun, Lush Life, etc...\n\nAs far as song writing, by far the most important thing is the chord progression.  As the melody comes directly from the chords, if your chords are shit, so will be your melody.  Even the dumbest lyrics will work over a good chord progression.\n\nIf you want to make a chord progression more interesting, I recommend to start by substituting boring chords for chords with a bit more color and character.  Look up \"Modal Interchange\" for more detail on that.  You can then substitute things like a ii-7 chord for a ii-7b5 or a bII Maj7 or the like.  You could also look into adding additional passing chords in your progression through voice leading.  Passing chords work just like normal dissonance, except they form their own chords.  For instance: if you played a D-7 chord D F A C and then played it's inversion F A C D; you could put a passing chord between the two chords like E G B D (E-7).\n\nThose are my quickest ideas for improving your writing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353943531", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Translated by Pawster (Not done yet. I will do the Q&amp;A some other time, if no one else does it first)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStanley's Nidalee guide\n\nWhen I was at Mainland a few days ago, people asked me a lot about how to play Nidalee. I want to share my knowledge with the passionate Nidalee players. Maybe someday I will write a detailed guide with pictures. But here is the rough draft for now.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy best lane: solo top.\n\nSignature champion: Nidalee, Vlad, Jarvan.\n\nFavorite item: Trinity.\n\nCommenting on Nidalee: I think there is no limit on Nidaleeâs power. The more skilled you are with her, the stronger she gets. Even I have not reached her limit yet.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 2 Complementary Champions\n\nI donât know which champion complements well with a solo top, but if I have to choose, Trundle or Mundo jungling would be a good choice.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 3 Items\n\nThere are two kinds of item builds for solo top Nidalee. The first one is the common, AD build then rush Trinity.\n\nThe other kind is to use CDR, since W skill now could benefit from it.\n\nYou have to evaluate the situation to see which build is better.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first high AD build, is useful against AD enemies, especially the melee ones.\n\nStart with boots + 3 pots. Nidalee is very susceptible to ganks before level 6, so boots is a must. Also if Nidalee has boots then she can utilize the upper bush since she runs faster.\n\nMid game core item includes Doranâs Blade X 2 -&gt; Ninja Tabi or Mercury Tread - &gt; Lantern -&gt; Phage. Lanternâs defence, AD, and ward ability provide very big help to top laners, especially against AD melee enemies. Once you get Lantern + Ninja Tabi, you will always come up on top in exchanges. When facing melee champions, just use human formâs normal attacks, donât always try to pounce with cat form.\n\nLate game get Trinity -&gt; Guardian Angel -&gt; (Omen / Infinity Edge / Force of Nature) or (Warmog -&gt; Atma -&gt; Force of Nature)\n\nTrinity and GA are crucial to Nidaleeâs build. Depending on the situation and enemieâs team composition, these are some of the most common items. If you think the game wonât end quickly, then go with the Warmog build, it is a very strong super late game build.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second build, CDR and high magic resist build, is useful against AP champions, such as casters like Vlad. However this is not useful against champions with high burst potential early game.\n\nStart with boots + 3 pots. Nidalee is very susceptible to ganks before level 6, so boots is a must. Also if Nidalee has boots then she can utilize the upper bush since she runs faster. (same as above)\n\nMid game core item includes Chalice -&gt; Spirit Visage -&gt; CDR boot -&gt; ??? (Translator: Iâm not sure. Abyssal Scepter maybe.) If most of the enemy's top middle and jungle are using magic damage, then consider adding another Negatron. &lt;&lt; This is very common, ex. Top Vlad, mid Morgana, Jungle Nautilus, then this means most of their damage are magical.\n\nThis build specifically counters the enemies, it is also the best way to play against manaless casters such as Vlad. Using cat formâs high CDR pounce to get close to them, combined with Mana regen runes, Chalicee, and Spirit Visageâs +healing. Most of the damage comes from high CDR+Nidaleeâs base damage. You will become very strong once you reach level 11.\n\nLate game you can transition into a standard late game or AP late game.\n\nStandard late game -&gt; Trinity, GA\n\nWith high MR and CDR, transitioning into the standard Trinity GA build helps your team putting pressure on enemies back line.\n\nAP late game -&gt; Atheneâe Unholy Grail -&gt; Deathcap -&gt; Lich Bane.\n\nThis is for when the team needs a AP Nidaleeâs javelin to poke. Since the rune and Chalice effect is still here, combined with exactly 40% CDR, you could become very good at poking even without blue buff.\n\nI feel like this is the only viable build for AP Nidalee. Because Nidaleeâs early game is so important, if you try to do the standard AP build, doesnât matter if you get Rod of Ages or rush Deathcap, your early game will be too weak.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 4 Skills\n\nAlways go with W E E Q E R. Then itâs R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W\n\nSummoner spell is usually Flash + Ignite or Flash + Exhaust.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 5 Q&amp;A\n\n(to be continued... )", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353947398", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "You have asked and you shall receive. \n\nAll I ask as a Leaguepedia admin is go and edit something TODAY, make a contribution, be a grammar nazi, add some trivia. If you don't have an account make one. \n\nHere is the translation:\n\n--------\n* **PART 1: Intro**\nIn Game ID Stanley0506 â US sever TPA_Stanley\n\nBest Position: Solo Top\n\nSignature Champions: Nidalee, Vlad, Jarvan IV\n\nFavorite Item: Trinity Force\n\nThoughts on Nidalee: Nidalee is a champion without limitations, the more practice you put into her, the more powerful she becomes, even for me.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n* **Part 2 Champion Synergies**\n\nI donât know who Solo top should pair with, but if you have to have an answer than Iâd say Trundle or Mundo from the Jungle.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n* **Part 3 Itemization**\n\nSolo top Nidalee usually itemizes in 2 ways. The most common path is to enhance your physical damage and then rush trinity force.\n\nThe CDR build is also viable. This path has existed since Nidaleeâs W started to be affected by CDR.\n\nYou should choose your build based on you lane match-ups and the situation.\n\nFirst Path: High AD damage with Wriggles and Trinity Force, good for going against melee AD characters\n\nTake Boots+3 pots. Nid is very susceptible to ganks pre 6, so boots is a must on her. Nidâs lane advantages usually comes from running faster than your opponents and going in and out of bushes.\n\nMid game core items should be dorans x 2, dodge boots or merc treads, into wriggles and then phage. Wriggles helps with your AD , your physical resists and your warding. Especially against AD based laners, after you get Wriggles and Nijaâs they will not win trades with you. Keep on poking melee characters and resist the urge to transform and bite them close range.\n\nLate game build Triforce &gt; GA &gt; (Randuins/IE/Force of Nature) or (Warmogs&gt;Atmaâs&gt;Force of Nature)\n\nTriforce and GA is mandatory on Nidalee, late game try to judge your teamcomp as well the opponents. If you donât think the game is going to end soon than you might consider the Warmogs combination, this build is more suitable for the super late game.\n\n\nThe Second Path: CDR+Magic Resist build. Use this against AP champs, especially mages like Vlad. This build is not suitable against champions with strong early games.\n\nTake Boots+3 pots. Nid is very susceptible to ganks pre 6, so boots is a must on her. Same as before.\n\nMidgame core items grail&gt; spirit visage &gt; Yomuâs (optional) (if their jungler and mid are also AP characters you can also buy a negatron. This is actually a common occurrence, for example Vlad top, Morg Mid, Naut Jungle would be a trio of magic damage dealers.)\n\nThis is very counter-heavy build, and is also the best build against non-resource mages like Vlad. High CDR makes Nidâs cougar engage very fast, with mana regen runes and infinite mana from grail, and the healing bonus from SV. Your main damage comes from CDR and Cougar forms base damage. You are the most dangerous after lvl 11.\n\nLate game you can transition into the first build or opt to go AP.\n\nWith high MR and CDR, you can transition back to the Triforce GA build. This is especially potent when your team needs someone who can cut into the back lines.\n\nAP Late Game-&gt; Atheneâs Unholy Wish-&gt; Dcap- &gt; Lichbane\n\nThis is the build when your team needs a source of AP poke. You can poke forver with your 40%CDR and your mana regen without having to acquire buffs.\n\nThis is what I consider the only viable build for AP Nid as of now. Early game for Nid is very important. Taking the normal AP route of rushing Dcap or RoA makes you too weak early game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n* **PART 4: Skill Order**\n\nYou should always take W E E Q E R and after that always R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W\n\nFor summoners take the most common Flash + Ignite or Flash with Exhaust.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353947831", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 120, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "here's my translation of it:\n\nthis is from an interview from China, asking a lot of questions about Nidalee~ Players with a passion for Nidalee can come and see my opinion of her\n\nWhen I have time in the future I'll organize the Nidalee guide like my Warwick guide into pictures\n\nThe following is my rough draft but I'll just post it here now~~there might be mistyped words here and there XDD\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGame ID: Stanley0506 - US server: TPA_Stanley\n\nMost comfortable position: Top lane\n\nKnown for playing: Nidalee, Vladimir, Jarvan IV\n\nOpinion on Nidalee: I think Nidalee is a champion with limitless potential, when you have more experience with her, she gets stronger and stronger, even I feel that way when I play her\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Part 2:** Champions to go with Nidalee\n\nAs a top laner, I don't know who goes well with her, but if I had to pick a jungler that synergizes with her I would have to say Trundle or Dr. Mundo would be better\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Part 3:** Items\n\nNidalee top actually has two builds to choose her items from, one is the more commonly seen increase in AD then rush for Triforce. The other build is based off of CDR scaling W when in cougar form- the CDR build.\n\nWhen facing different laning opponents we can choose the build that fits the current situation \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe first build: High AD+Wriggles+Triforce Build - Used when facing AD laning opponents, especially melee champions\n\nStarting items: Boots+3 pots  \n\nPre-6 Nidalee is actually very scared of ganks, so she has to buy boots as the first item. Also, the advantage of taking boots with Nidalee is based on her movement speed is faster than her opponent's, thus utilizing the brushes to poke at the enemy\n\nMid game items: Doran's Blade x2 -&gt; Ninja Tabi or Mercury Treads -&gt; Wriggles Lantern -&gt; Phage\n\nWhether its the armor, the AD, or the free ward it grants, Wriggles helps a lot when playing at top lane. Since the enemy is usually an AD melee, when you have wriggles+ninja tabi, he cannot out-trade damage with you, Nidalee should just keep autoattacking in human form as harass, no need to change into cougar form and pounce on the enemy champion. \n\nLate Game items: Triforce -&gt; GA -&gt; (Randuin's/IE/Force of Nature) or (Warmog's/Atma's/Force of Nature)\n\nTriforce and GA are the essential core items to Nidalee, in late game we need to analyze how the game is going and the other team's team comp, these are all commonly used item combinations. If the game seems to not be ending anytime soon, then you can think about using the Warmog's item build, as this is the stronger build for late late game.\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n2nd Build: High Magic Resist+CDR\n\nUse this build when facing AP top laners, especially when it's Vladimir. PS. this build is not suited for champions that are strong early game\n\nStarting items: Boots+3 pots\n(Explanation is the same as the above build)\n\nMid game core items: Chalice of Harmony-&gt; Spirit Visage -&gt;Ionian Boots-&gt; Guinsoo's Rageblade (Optional) (If the other team's top, mid, and jungle  are AP-based then you can consider adding Negatron Cloak)\n\nThis is a commonly seen scenario, ex. Top-Vladimir Mid-Morgana Jungle-Nautilus make up an AP-based team\n\nThis build to counter the opponent, also is the best way for Nidalee to go against a energyless champion such as Vlad. Using high CDR to pounce onto the enemy quickly, the endless amount of mana from his mana regen runes and Chalice, the increased sustain from her heal+Spirit Visage, the main source of damage is the high CDR and the damage from cougar form, which makes her most threatening at level 11.\n\nLate game items: Go for Triforce+GA or go for the AP build\n\nTriforce+GA: With high MR and CDR, get Triforce+GA when your team needs an initiator+someone who can dive at the squishies in the back\n\nAP build: Athene's Unholy Grail -&gt; Rabadon's Deathcap -&gt; Lich Bane\n\nThis build is used when the team needs an AP Nidalee to constantly poke at the opponents. Since we have max CDR and infinite mana from our mana regen runes + Chalice, we don't need blue buff to continue to poke at the other team. \n\nThis is the only way I think AP top Nidalee can go for her items, since Nidalee's early game is still very important, but if we go standard AP mid items such as Rod of Ages or rushing Rabadon's, our early game would be too weak.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 4:** Skill points\n\nSkill order is always W E E Q E R then prioritizing R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W\n\nSummoner spells I normally take Flash+Ignite, but you can also take Flash+Exhaust\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1353949187", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

A G major scale is G A B C D E F# G.  If you were to start and end on the 4th scale degree but play all of those same notes, you'd get C D E F# G A B C.  That's a C lydian scale.

{"body": "[](/udyr) Guide : \n\n[Champion Discussion of the Day - Udyr](/http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qft9i/champion_discussion_of_the_day_udyr_2nd_march_2012/)\n\n[Runepage to most junglers](/http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/x8oto/general_rune_pages_for_most_junglers/)\n\nUdyr is a very strong early game champion making him formidable to be faced in the jungle. He also has a powerful stun which is basically on 0 second cooldown and can make his teamfight presence very powerful.\n\nUdyr is also a very unique champion as he is one of the few champions that have no ultimate.He can level up any of 4 spells at level 1.\n\n**Spells**\n\n**Summoner Spells** : Smite Flash\n\n**Masteries** : Here is a [screenshot](/http://imgur.com/E4z7i) of the masteries used while jungling udyr with phoenix stance\n\n**Runes** :\n\nâ¢ 3x *Greater Quintessence of Swiftness*\n\nâ¢ 9x *Greater Mark of Alacrity*\n\nâ¢ 9x *Greater Seal of Resillience*\n\nâ¢ 9x *Greater Glyph of Warding*\n\nThis Runes and masteries setup gives Udyr a lot of movement speed thus allowing him to roam around the map very quickly, while\ngiving him the tankyness he needs in the team fights. Movespeed also helps him slightly overcome one of his major weaknesses that is the ability of being kited quite a lot as he doesn't have any gap closer.\n\n**Skill Order**\n\nR W E R W R W R W R W E E E E Q Q Q\n\nYou can also take an early point in Q, this will help you gank better, help take down towers faster and kill Dragon/Baron quicker due to increased AS.\n\nNote : All of Udyr's spells cannot be made level 5 as number of point allowed make it such that you can max 3 of your spells to level 5, and one to level 3.\n\n**Item Build** :\n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStart with [](/bootsofspeed) 3x[](/healthpotion)\n\n[](/philosophersstone)  --&gt; [](/shurelyasreverie)\n\n[](/heartofgold) --&gt; [](/randuinsomen)\n\n[](/mercurystreads) or [](/ninjatabi)\n\n[](/aegisofthelegion)\n\n[](/forceofnature) \n\n[](/frozenheart)\n\n[](/trinityforce) If you need Tons of Damage\n\nUse the above build if your team has plenty of damage on their own and don't need damage in ganks, Upgrade your GP10 items\nonce you start the team fight stage(~20 minutes into the game).\n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStart with [](/bootsofspeed) 3x[](/healthpotion)\n\n[](/heartofgold) --&gt; [](/randuinsomen)\n\n[](/phage) --&gt; [](/frozenmallet)\n\n[](/mercurystreads) or [](/ninjatabi)\n\n[](/witsend)\n\n[](/forceofnature) \n\n[](/frozenheart)\n\n[](/trinityforce) If you need Tons of Damage\n\nUse the above build if your team lacks damage in ganks, and you will provide damage. Upgrade your GP10 items once you start\nthe team fight stage(~20 minutes into the game).\n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Early Game** :\n\n[](/udyr) is a formidable force to be dealt with early game , and his level 2 - level 3 ganks are pretty insane and people\nwill be forced to blow a summoner if they get caught by his stun. Make use of his early game presence by ganking as often as\npossible pre level 6, as every champion will get significantly get stronger than udyr post 6(lack of ultimate).\n\nJungle Route to stay at near full health thus allowing you to gank : \n\nWolves --&gt; Blue --&gt; Wraiths --&gt; Wolves --&gt; Red\n\nDoing double golems takes you down to really low health pre-level 5 hence you should not attempt it if you are planning to gank .At this point you can either gank top/bot lane depending on which side is closer to you. After this you can finish clearing the jungle and base to get your first set of items.\n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mid Game** : At this point try to counter jungle, also ward the objectives around the map or jungle exits, this will help you and your teammates from getting ganked by a roaming mid lane or the enemy jungler. Securing objectives like dragon really helps your team gap the bridge if your lanes are losing out in CS. As each dragon is worth about 1000g. Keeping tabs on the enemy jungler will allow you to counter jungle efficiently, and if you see them in a lane when the buffs will repsawn you can immediately capitalize on that by stealing the buff(but be wary of missing enemy laners).\n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Late Game** : Your job basically becomes to be a damage soak, and a strong CC to lock up key enemy champions, or help in \ncatching people who are out of position thus giving your team a numbers advantage. Keeping an eye on the objectives is very\nimportant at this phase of the game, more towards Baron than Dragon. If you build frozen heart and shurelya's Udyr will have\nMax CDR at this point, which means that you can have bear stance up all the time(almost continuous movespeed increase) and\nthe same goes for turtle stance(continuos shield that gets refreshed every ~4s) this will make Udyr that much more tanky.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354026491", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(Thanks for responding! I got three paragraphs into my response and came back up here to say this, I really appreciate it.)\n\nIf I understand correctly (I had to read it a few times) you're basically saying to more or less fake it by staggering the independent slideshows, so that they all hold the same images (let's say 4 target areas A B C D and 12 images but start at different counters?\n\nThe only issue I have is that the problem is a little more complex than I let on initially, with the number of target areas (4) staying constant no matter what, but the image pool size changing. It could be as few as 5 or even 4, theoretically, meaning the net effect of the slideshow would just look like they're changing positions. That would be a rare outcome, but I think I really do need to draw from a single pool of objects and iterate through both the next-in-line image and next-in-line display target.\n\nWhen I was trying to figure out how to do it I was envisioning a complex and cumbersome (and like you suggested, client-dependent-and-not-friendly) system of arrays to track what is where and when what was done to whom and how long it's been since that guy showed his face, etc, and while I could do that, what I'm having a hard time with is mating it with the slideshow aspect, because I'm having to use a transition/fade plugin that is cross-browser friendly and it's a little above my pay grade.\n\nWhat I already have:\n\n1. Server-side, based on an arbitrary variable related to the user's preferences, a different pool of images is chosen and loaded into an array. (using php, scan the directory, using regex, strip out anything that isn't a jpg jpeg png etc etc, as well as the path, just get the filenames of all images)\n2. Initially I just randomly displayed images in the target areas, splicing the array to make sure no duplication occurred, but the person I'm trying to help with this really wants the slideshow effect.\n\nI may just give up and push for two target areas with independent slideshows (since there would almost always be enough images to accomplish this, just divide them in half basically) but now I'm really interested in how to do this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354030317", "subreddit": "web_design", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's a quick rundown, You can tell what a champion's abilities scale off of based on the color of the number on the skill tooltip when you mouse over your Q W E R skills. If it is green, it scales off of ability power. If the number is a reddish orange, it scales off of attack damage, typically this is a good indicator of how to build the champion for early players. although builds get a lot more complicated for champions that are junglers/top laners. The build routes for ADC's and MIDs or AP carries is very stale and repetitive. This is why i say stick to adc and mid as you learn the game more.  Typically ability power champions are Squishy and ranged. \nADC's are ranged people with strong auto attacks, typically what are considered the best are ones like ezreal and corki who can kite with an ability (meaning move back from danger). The power of these champs is a built in flash with a much lower cooldown. you can probably already see how this can be massively helpful when being focused. \n\nADCs: Corki, Ezreal, Tristana, Ashe, Sivir, Graves. (these are the most popular and commonly used, higher level games typically have a corki and ez ~80% of the time.)\n\nAP MID CARRIES: Orianna, Veigar, Ahri, Zyra, Twisted Fate, Diana, Gragas, Champions like that with long ranged spells that do alot of damage. \n\n\nSomething else to be knowledgeable about is that AP's are reliant on spells, and ADC's typically are based on auto attacks (simply right clicking) and their abilities are used to poke (ez, ashe) or burst (graves, corki)\n\nA big part to learning the game if you want to be at a moderately high level of skill is to watch streams, simply look at what the pro's do and learn. These are only ways to accelerate the learning, as it does happen eventually simply by playing, just typically it's a lot slower. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354114514", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Is it switched only to differentiate itself from the G major scale, which would also have a value of 1?\n\nNo. It is Bb because it has to be Bb, if you put A# in there then there would be two A's, and this is against the rules. The letter names are used like numbers to count the scale degrees, the fact that we use letter names is a bit of a quirk of history and you could easily use numbers. \n\nEvery scale has the letters A B C D E F G in it. This is called the 'spelling' of the scale. Scales have specific patterns of tones and semitones (for C major this is why we have the pattern of two, then three black keys on the piano). Accidentals are used to adjust the basic C major scale such that the pattern is consistent when starting from a different letter. Every letter must still appear once.\n\nIn your case F major is: F G A Bb C D E. If we used A# we would have: F G A A# C D E. Two A's and no B, incorrect spelling! A more extreme example would be the use of double flats or double sharps, say for example the key of G#, we raise every letter from the key of G by a semitone and thus achieve an F##, not a G!\n\nThat website has a fairly convoluted method for figuring out key signatures in my opinion. The 'standard' method (or the way I was taught anyway) is in terms of the pattern: tone, tone, semitone. Does the website you are using teach you this? I can explain quickly if you want me to.\n\nEdit: If you want to know the basics of the usual method you simply count up in fifths from C, each time you add a sharp. For the flats you count *down* in fifths, each time adding a flat. So C has no accidentals, count up a fifth: G. G has one sharp. Count up a fifth again: D, D has two sharps. I can explain how to figure out the order of the sharps too, but this is again counting in fifths.

{"body": "So everything starts with the C major scale and is built from there. The notes of the C major scale are the white keys on the piano: C D E F G A B C. I'll just assume that you know a little about piano and reference that.\n\nThe space between each consecutive key on the piano is called a *semitone*. This is also equivalent to the space between consecutive frets on a guitar, and also the same as the movement of a single sharp or flat (if you go down). Two semitones are called a *tone*. So thats the basic building blocks. I'll call a tone T and a semitone S.\n\nThe major scale has the following pattern *between* consecutive notes: T - T - S - T - T - T - S. The two groupings of tone-tone-semitone are called tetrachords, each major scale has two tetrachords separated by a tone. This terminology is a little bit less relevant, the idea is just to split it into two groupings. If we think of semitones as equal spacings on a grid, then we can see this pattern more clearly:\n\n    C - D - E F - G - A - B C\n\nYou'll notice that the letters which are close together are the white keys on the piano which are adjacent. The ones with a dash between them are the ones separated by black keys. In other words the dashes are exactly the black keys. \n\nSo the two important basic points you really need to hammer home: The plain letter names refer to the notes of the C major scale. The major scale has a specific pattern of 'gaps' between the notes.\n\nWhen we go to construct new scales we just pick up the letter names starting from the letter we want, but this will make a new pattern. In order to maintain the major scale pattern we have to adjust the letter names by using sharps or flats to achieve the T-T-S... pattern I described earlier. You can just sit down and figure it out, but this is tedious. A much nicer and cleaner method is to build up from the C major scale by splitting it in half and stacking a new tetrachord on top of the upper half of the C scale. We already know by definition that the upper half of C (starting from G) fits our T - T - S tetrachord pattern, so we're half way there already. The same argument can be made for heading *downwards*. So lets do it.\n\nC major is: C D E F G A B C.\n\nThe tetrachords are (in brackets): (C D E F) (G A B C)\n\nSo we start from G, which is the fifth degree of C, and go up:\n\nG A B C D E F G\n\nNow we know G A B C fits the pattern, so lets examine each space from C upwards. C -&gt; D, looking back at C major this is a tone, ok. D -&gt; E, again a tone. E -&gt; F now this is a semitone (adjacent white keys on the piano) but we still need a tone. Result: F must be raised to keep the pattern. This is an accidental F#. Lets do the last one: F# -&gt; G, this is a semitone, so we're good. F# is the only accidental we needed. So rather than use the *accidental* F#, we say that the key of G has the *key signature* F#. \n\nWe can go through this whole process again, starting from our newly constructed G major scale, remembering that F# is an intrinsic part of that. So we take the upper tetrachord of G: D E F# G, and start again with the key of D. It would be a good idea for you to sit down with pen and paper, and perhaps a piano keyboard, and figure this one out for yourself. The answer is that again we add one extra sharp, perhaps suprisingly in the same place as before, this time giving us F# and C#, and hence the key signature of D is F# C#.\n\nA meta-pattern is emerging here. If we start from C and go up a fifth we only need to add one accidental to get back to the correct pattern. Again starting from G we do this and add one more accidental. Same thing for the next key, A, then E, then B, etc. Soon you start to hit sharp scales and things get hairy, but you can realise that flat scales are sometimes easier. \n\nThe interesting thing here is that if we think of F as the first sharp, you might notice that the next sharp, C, is also a fifth away. This pattern hold just the same. The order of sharps is then: F C G D... etc. So what we're really saying here is you don't need to memorize key signatures OR crazy calculations to figure them out, you just have to remember an ordering of the letters, which is called the circle of fifths. This, together with some knowledge of how things all fit together, will allow you to quickly figure out any key signature, just because you know its position on the circle.\n\n[Heres a nice picture for you](http://www.circle-of-fifths.net/images/circle-of-fifths.gif).\n\nWe can repeat the whole process counting downwards from C. Lets quickly do that. Get the lower tetrachord of C: C D E F, and lets add a tetrachord below it: F G A B C D E F. And again lets check the spaces, this time on the *lower* tetrachord: F-G is a tone, good. G-A is a tone, good. Now A-B is a tone but we want semitone, so B has to come *down* since raising A would ruin the previously ok space, thus we get Bb. Further checking reveals everything else is in order, and hence the key signature of F includes a Bb.\n\nAgain you can keep going down to get the flat scales.\n\nSo you don't really need to become proficient at knowing all these patterns, although it does help a lot. The point here is to convince yourself that everything fits together in very specific layers of patterns. Once you understand how all these patterns fit together and become comfortable with it, you see that all that ultimately matters is knowing the circle.\n\nSo I hope that wasn't too confusing. Music theory is a little bit arcane, with a lot of strange things that have sort of evolved over time rather than been deliberately constructed in the most sensible manner. As for why these specific patterns are used, well, I could probably write 2000-3000 words on that topic alone, so for now just take it at face value.

How to lit the kick-out hole I have not though it up yet but I think it would be by hitting all rows of KARMA targets to lit one hole then rehit all targets to second hole and so on. It would be very challenging to lit all 4 holes. During muiltball all switches scores X points per ball in play. E.G. if you have 4 balls in play then all switch scores 4X points or if you have 2 balls in play then all switches score 2X points. This will force you to try to keep all balls in play for maximum points! If it is not actived then it will just kick that ball out. Also if there are already a ball in kick out hole then kick out hole will automatically kick out the ball to receive the ball that is coming through the rollover lane. \n\nlocated between two groups of rollover is 5 \"comment karma\" pop bumpers and will collect normal points when they are lit. there are 2 groups of pop bumper. one higher point pop bumper in the middle and 4 smaller points pop bumper. only one group will be lit at a time and will turn off and on between two groups when ball hit a pop bumper just like on old EM games.

{"body": "\"what note the chord is\" isn't exactly right.  It's \"what chord is being played.\" When you hit two or more notes at once, they form a chord.  In this chord, there is what is known as a root note.  That root note is what names the chord.  \n\nThe lowest note (in terms of pitch) is usually the root note, but not always.  So if you're playing a G chord, you're playing the notes G B D.  You may be playing each of those notes more than once.  For instance, playing a G chord on a guitar gives you the notes (6 strings) G B D G B G (from lowest pitch to highest).  \n\nAs to what notes form which chords, that's a much more in depth discussion.  You'd need to know a bit about music theory to explain that one.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354312800", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
