{"body": "It's exactly the same as intervals inside the octave but the number is 7 higher for each octave (octave is a somewhat silly name since it spans 7 notes rather than 8, but whatever).  A perfect 11th is a perfect fourth above an octave.  An augmented 13th is an augmented 6th above an octave.  Exactly the same.\n\nIn chords, though, it doesn't exactly work this way.  You can imagine an extended chord as a tall stack of thirds: the 1, the 3, the 5, the 7, the 9, the 11, the 13.  This is all of the notes in the scale, since the 15th is two octaves, but you can theoretically keep going as far as you want.  In our system of music theory, we like to think of all chords as stacks of thirds, just rearranged or with notes missing.  So a C7 might be C G Bb E, and C9 could be C Bb D E.  Technically a chord like G13 would be G B D F A C E, but you're more likely to find it voiced G F B E instead, in a different order with stuff missing.  They're still *named* with the 9's, 11's, and 13's, but for all intents and purposes, you can consider them actually 2's, 4's, and 6's, respectively.  So if you see Cadd9, that's a C major chord with an added D, the 9th (also known as the 2nd; it doesn't matter what octave you put it in).  Why not just C9?  Because that would include the *minor* 7th (because that's the convention; if you want the major 7th, it's CM9 or Cmaj9 or C∆9), and the composer clearly wants no notes other than C, D, E, G.\n\nSo, to summarize: when you're talking about notes, a minor 9th is an octave plus a minor second.  When you're talking about chords, a minor 9th is exactly the same as a minor 2nd.

{"body": "* **Learn some corner carry combos.** \n\nSomeone posted a very helpful link last week or so with pretty much all the corner carry combos Zero has solo. Personally I think you should learn three of them.\n\nThe one at the very beginning for your standard one if you have no buster fully charged\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDTMd1zmi8\n\nThis one you fall back on if you fuck up the spacing in the air and can't jump loop. You don't have to do dive down to be able to do this relaunch, you can just do M M H S in the air.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDTMd1zmi8&amp;t=49s\n\nThis is the most consistent charged buster corner carry combo, not enough people use it. You have to do heavy lightning and immediately cancel by letting go of buster.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDTMd1zmi8&amp;t=1m16s\n\n* **Learn to combo off of Vajra**.\n\nIf you're mid screen you need to do the second relaunch variation that I linked above. If you're in the corner you can just do the standard lightning relaunch. Oh, and about lightning relaunch:\n\n* **Lightning Relaunch** *\n\n1. If they're tall and thin (magneto, nova, storm, strange, etc.), then they tend to fall faster than other characters, so it's harder to do lightning relaunch. You have to release buster later after dive.\n\n2. It doesn't work at all against Shuma and Ammy, do Dive, Buster cancel, light dash down.\n\n* **Vajra Combo extension**. \n\nIt's actually pretty shit damage and hardly ever worth doing unless you want to do Rekkoha and you don't have your Sentinel assist. \n\nAfter hard knock down -&gt; Jump -&gt; Heavy Dive -&gt; cancel into buster -&gt; light lightning -&gt; call strider as soon as possible -&gt; delay as much as possible -&gt; Heavy Ryuejin (DP) -&gt; Rekkoha.\n\n* **Sentinel Combo Extension** \n\nIt's pretty easy to go into lightning loop with Sentinel. At the end of your combo you lighting relaunch (or just buster, dash down), call Sentinel and launch at about same time, hit air S as soon as possible and you'll hit the opponent to the ground. As soon as you can, do air dive (D, DR, R + medium or heavy) and this will cause them to get hit by drones right after you OTG. When you land, you jump up and do level 3 buster and then light lightning, cancel into Sougenmu and do lightning loops.\n\nIf you want to do a Sentinel combo extension into hard knock down so that you can Rekkoha (despite what people say, it's still good to know Rekkoha combos, if you have a ton of meter, no xfc, and they're on their anchor, why go for lightning loops when you can go for easy DHCs?):\n\nAfter a hard knock down, you call Sentinel as soon as you can -&gt; jump up and do Heavy Dive -&gt; Cancel into Buster -&gt; L command dash down -&gt; S -&gt; jump -&gt; light lightning -&gt; tiger knee Medium dive.\n\nWhen you do the S, your opponent should be in launch state but stuck getting hit drones so they don't fly up. They need to be in launch state so that you can hard knock down them again. \n\n* **Lightning Loops** \n\nYou really really should learn lightning loop. It's pretty much the most broken super in the game for damage and can makes it so Zero can kill any character and usually go meter *positive*.\n\nHere's the basic outline on what the Lightning Loop is:\n\nLight Lightning (Be charging buster the whole time after this) -&gt; Cancel into Sougenmu -&gt; \n\n(jump -&gt; level 3 buster -&gt; L lightning -&gt; TK L lightning -&gt; TK L Lightning) x 2 \n\njump -&gt; level 3 buster -&gt; L Lightning -&gt; do one of these:\n\n1. Cancel into another Sougenmu and do it again.\n\n2. Heavy DP.\n\n3. Do a TK Medium dive if they are in launch state (you never launched them down after launching them up) and Rekkoha. Do this if you know they'll die from a Rekkoha so you don't have a chance to mess up another loop.\n\n4. Maybe do a reset if you're feeling ballsy. Usually just jump jab and then light lightning. Explore a bit.\n\nI'm pretty sure everyone in the world does the TK lightning motion differently. I personally do a really sloppy one that I'm surprised even works. I go R, DR, D, DL, D, DR, R, UR, (slight delay) press light. Just sit down and try to do a TK lightning for a while without doing lightning loops and see what you're most comfortable with.\n\n**some people do an unoptimised form of lightning loop. In the West Coast, Killerkai is so known for his Zero that some in West coast think he's doing the optimal version and get surprised when people do the real optimal version I described above. Don't copy Killerkai's lightning loop**\n\n* **Learn some incoming character mix ups with Vajra**\n\nBasically you just fricken call Vajra and do some bull shit under them while the come in. You can lightning, command dash behind, choose not to go behind, whatever. It's all extremely ambiguous and I don't think they can do shit about it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354378191", "subreddit": "MvC3", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've already posted in this thread, but I wanted to add another.\n\nHalo 2 - Skulls.\nThere was rumored to be a secret to do with the skulls, something nobody had figured out. More than just collecting them all....but that they would reveal a great secret. \n\nThe following excerpt is from [this old forum post](http://jumprs.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-1706.html?s=4646f3a89da695cfe39f07a9fe3cf025)\n\n\n\n&gt;EGATFIBGBCSIMAW is a string of letters found in the graphics on the 'Halo 2 Soundtrack Volume 1' CD box art. \n\n&gt;Bungie have a reputation for their use of anagrams and it is believed that this is one. And the letters seem to be the initials of the 15 skulls found in Halo 2:\n\n&gt;E - Envy\n\n&gt;G - Grunt Birthday Party\n\n&gt;A - Assassins\n\n&gt;T - Thunderstorm\n\n&gt;F - Famine\n\n&gt;I - I Would Have Been Your Daddy\n\n&gt;B - Blind\n\n&gt;G - Ghost\n\n&gt;B - Blackeye\n\n&gt;C - Catch\n\n&gt;S - Sputnik\n\n&gt;I - Iron\n\n&gt;M - Mythic\n\n&gt;A - Angry\n\n&gt;W - Whuppopotamus (Hex data suggests this is the correct name for 'Nameless' Skull)\n\n&gt;So we could hope that if you collect the 15 skulls in a particular order something, other than a great Halo 2 experience, may be awarded to the player (an undocumented skull?!).\n\n&gt;This has been discussed and claimed 'Disproved' at various places but if you want a job doing right...\n\n&gt;So it seems to me there are 16 possible permutations for the list. What now? \n\n&gt;4 of the letters in the anagram are duplicates - G, A, I and B. So in our anagram the list of skulls could be shown in 16 different ways (see below). When one duplicated name is exchanged the other goes to the next location - e.g. position 2 can be either Ghost OR Grunt Birthday Party and position 8 MUST be the remainder.\n\n&gt;E 1 3 T F 5 7 G B C S I M A W\n\n&gt;1 = Grunt Birthday Party \n\n&gt;2 = Ghost\n\n&gt;3 = Assassins\t \n\n&gt;4 = Angry\n\n&gt;5 = IWHBYD\t \n\n&gt;6 = Iron\n\n&gt;7 = Blind\t \n\n&gt;8 = Blackeye\n\n&gt;1357\n&gt;2468\n&gt;2357\n&gt;1457\n&gt;1367\n&gt;1358\n&gt;2457\n&gt;2367\n&gt;2358\n&gt;1467\n&gt;1458\n&gt;1368\n&gt;2467\n&gt;2458\n&gt;2368\n&gt;1468\n\n&gt;So, to see if this does anything we will need to try all 16 permutations. We should also assume they must be done live, in one session rather than from saved profiles but let's try the easy way first.\n\n&gt;Anyone got some time to kill?\n\n\nI for one tried many different things in order to unlock these secrets, but like everyone else came up with nothing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354448385", "subreddit": "truegaming", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1. I've only used it when I had to send serial data and had to go from binary to decimal and when using op code for an old microcontroller .\n\n2. You don't, the computer does and you need to work with the computer. \n\n3. There is math to it. My favorite explanation:\n\n    Count to 10 using base 10: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8  9  10  \n    Count to 10 using base  9: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8  10 11  \n    Count to 10 using base  8: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  10 11 12  \n    Count to 10 using base  7: 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 13  \n\nYou see there is a pattern. A base 10 system is the one we usually use. In base 10 we can use 10 different characters to count to 10 (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). After we use character \"9\" we run out so we start repeating.  \nSame in base 9. We can only use 9 characters (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) so when we get to 8 we start repeating.\n\nSo going on:\n\n    Count to 10 using base 4: 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 20 21\n\nnotice: after 13 we go to 20, just like going from 19 to 20.\n\n    Count to 10 using base 3: 1 2 10 11 12 20 21 22 100 101\n\nLike before once we get to 22 we go to 100 since we can not use 3. Just like going from 99 to 100.\n\n   Count to 10 using base 2: 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010\n\nBase 2 is also called binary. Again since we can not use 2 after 11 we go to 100, and after 111 we go to 1000. Like going from 999 to 1000. Notice 111 in binary is 7 in base 10. In octal (base 8) we can not use 8 so 111 in binary is like 7 in octal. It's convenient to use octal to represent binary that only goes up to 7.\n\nOk so now going the other way\n\n    Count using base 16: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 10 11 12 13.......\n\nSince we can use 16 different characters we start using letters. Base 16 is also called hexadecimal (hex). So our F in hex is the same as 15 in decimal. FF is 255 in decimal and 11111111 in binary. It's convenient to use hex to represent binary numbers that go up to 15 in hex. \n\nIf you were to count all the way up to 10000 in decimal you would find it is the same as 65536 in hex.

{"body": "O.K before the really heavy theory cats show up and do dissertations on the difference between a mode and a modality and a modal resolution as a prerequisite. Let me see if I can be of some assistance. We can take a piece of a scale and play it over the appropriate chord at the appropriate time like this ex Key of G Bm chord B C D E F# G A B , the song will later resolve back to the G chord via D major and the whole thing will have been in G ionian ( Major scale ) for the whole time including the Bm chord where I played BCDEF#GAB which was B to B in  G major and as a \" shorthand\" -we call it B phrygian mode, but it isn't really B phrygian mode because the underlying chords aren't resolving that way( to the Bm), see what I mean? so as a shorthand we say we are playing a mode, but we aren't  actually playing IN a mode, or modally or in that modality. So the short answer to your question is that each diatonic mode fits over the appropriate chord ie  Key of G major  G ionian A dorian B phrygian, C lydian, D mixolydian, E Aeolian ( natural minor) F# Locrian,G ionian. When you have a dominant 7th chord then the mixolydian will give you the correct 3rd and the correct 7th. If we start a blues in D with D7 and you play DEF#GABCD -D mixolydian, you are covering the D7 but you aren't in the key of G ionian or D mixolydian either, it's just dominant harmony based on a D 7 chord in the Key of D with G7 and A7 to follow.\n ex of modes -as pieces of scales- used in country music, Aoelian -to many to list, Dorian -Green Grass and High Tides -the Outlaws, Ionian -\"If I said you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me.\"  Mixolydian -Country Boy -Alvin Lee.

Pretty sure I said as you so handily quoted \n\"It's an Alpha, they are getting the basic mechanics and gameplay down BEFORE chucking 200 people at it.\"\n\nStress testing is one of the last things you ever do on a game, it's one of the very last thing you do in beta, no point in stress testing a load of systems that are not final.\n\nYou polish everything to how you want it in release and then you stress test.\n\n\"Everything you said is untrue. First of all when you as the lead developer publicly claim that your game will be 99% hack proof, you are making a big claim. One that you better be able to back up. When this game went public hackers said that the game was easy to hack because it had no anti-hack what so ever.\"\n\nDid you even read what I said, Why in the world would you deploy anti cheat software in an Alpha? They have made claims about a full release of a game. Honestly I am starting to wonder if you know what ALPHA means. Because it seems no matter how much it is explained to you you still don't have a clue.\n\nTo put it very simply You have development/test phases the most popularly known ones are ALPHA and BETA. Ok are you following ? Then we have a RELEASE this is the one where we judge whether their claims were true or not. Are we still following? I know it's difficult all them letters and everything but do try and keep up.\n\nVery, very few developers release their anti cheat software in alpha's and beta's. In fact I challenge you to find me just one who has.\n\n\"Hardly any game got big from straight up copying another game. They got big from using past concepts to come out with a unique game of their own.\"\n\nOh really now, let me give you a couple of notable examples of copy cat games that are or were immensely popular. \nThe unreal franchise, Pretty much a straight rip of Quake. It's was incredibly successful and includes some of the highest rated games of all time. \n\nCall of Duty, Made it's name by being a WW2 first person shooter very, very similar to the original Medal of honour games. Don't think I need to tell you how popular this one is but just in case you didn't know, It's one of the most profitable entertainment franchise in the world.\n\nAlso the War Z is looking to implement a few things of it's own whether they do or not we will see at RELEASE. Lets be clear on this one again Not in the ALPHA but in the RELEASE is when we judge the game and the developers claims.\n\nJust like when the Day Z standalone is fully released (not in ALPHA) we will judge whether Rocket's claims about it were true.\n\n\"I have made no assumption there. I stated an actuality. You are the one assuming it will live up to their ridiculous claims.\"\nIf you don't see your assumption then you my friend are dumber than I initially thought, I mean I pointed it right out for you I can't do much more.\n\nI don't assume they will live up to their to be honest not very ridiculous claims, the hacking one probably not but that old chestnut has been thrown around by pretty much every multiplayer developer ever \"oh are game won't be infested with hackers this year, promise\" they always are, not really their fault it's much easier to hack than it is to develop an anti-hack.\n\nWhat I do assume is that I will see whether or not they met their claims on the day they RELEASE the game instead of acting they can't do or change anything now because the game is in ALPHA and then judging my opinions of it on that, like you are doing.\n\nI mean if you think everything Rocket wants to put in Day Z is going to be in the Alpha and you think it's going to be running anti hack software before release (Rocket has claimed he's going to be putting a stop to hackers too) then you are going to have a bad day when it comes out.\n\nJust for reference a similar amount of players has been done on the PS3 which is 7 year old hardware. Way more than 250 players per server has already been done on PC on Planetside 2.\n\nAnd just one last time. We judge a game and  a developers claims about it at RELEASE, say it with me now R E L E A S E, not in big bad ALPHA!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354658798", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;**Plot Outline**\n\n&gt;An incredibly ambitious project to make the most scientifically accurate big budget space film ever made to revive and accelerate the advancement of space exploration. The film will be conceived, developed and made by world-renowned scientists, A-list film personalities and the public.\n\n&gt;So here's how we do it:\n\n&gt;Step 1.\n\n&gt;Collect concepts, storylines and technological ideas from the public.\n\n&gt;Step 2.\n\n&gt;Have those ideas voted on Facebook, to filter out the obviously idiotic ones before passing them on to a panel of scientists who will screen those ideas as per what's theoretically or practically possible and what's not.\n\n&gt;Step 3.\n\n&gt;With the scientifically approved concepts and storylines in hand. we'll take it to our film writers. They will re-arrange and add to the raw material and form a gripping and cathartic screenplay out of it.\n\n&gt;Step 4.\n\n&gt;The screenplay will be re-assessed by the scientists in order to find ways to logically account for any changes made due to storytelling needs.\n\n&gt;Step 5.\n\n&gt;Once the script is ready, a costing will take place to ascertain the budget of the film.\n\n&gt;Step 6.\n\n&gt;If by then, we have created enough buzz around this project (and gotten influential people on board) for film studios to be willing to invest in the film, well and good. If not, we will take our collective power to a crowdfunding website to raise funds to shoot a pitch short film/ trailer to convince film studios to jump in.\nBy motivating a big enough crowd, it is possible to gain enough influential mass to gravitationally pull international personalities towards our cause. Also, if it can be demonstrated to film funding agencies that there is already a demand for this film, only the crazily stupid ones would abstain.\n\n&gt;Step 7.\n\n&gt;We make the greatest scifi film ever made. We get the best people to do it. I am not excluding the possibility of including seemingly unthinkable collaborators as Peter Jackson or Christopher Nolan, or both. Nothing is impossible.\n\nYOU GUYS this will literally be the best movie ever! Here's the plan: we get the general public to come up with our plot since we have done literally no preparation of treatments, or story ideas of any kind actually, as well as throw out SCIENCE to be featured in the movie. Obviously the general public is more qualified to pitch ideas than actual Hollywood professionals.\n\nNext, we get SCIENTISTS to ~~explain how basically all of the ideas contributed by laymen are not science but definitely fiction~~ pick out the most realistic elements, which are then turned into our ~~unnamed and undetermined~~ writers, who will of course be able to use the SCIENCE ideas because as Hollywood well knows 100% realistic SCIENCE is literally exactly the same as entertainment that will sell.\n\nWe bring the screenplay back to the SCIENTISTS to smooth out plot points because writing Hollywood screenplays is literally what they are trained to do, and our ~~nonexistent~~ producers will determine the budget. How do we get the money, you ask? It's simple; we, uh, launch the kickstarter. \n\nNaturally we will need ~~popular~~ the best directors in Hollywood like Jackson and Nolan (how in the world did they ever think to suggest those two underground le gems?) to collaborate and they will literally be able to completely clear their individual schedules for this partnership. Not to mention the SCIENTISTS we are going to get onboard, like NDT, Dawkins (two totally original and creative choices; Dawkins is especially useful since his field of study has literally everything to do with astrophysics and aerospace engineering), Hawking, Seth MacFarlane, Simon Pegg (but apparently not Nick Frost), Bill Nye, and of course Kevin Smith.\n\nCurrently, we are in Phase 1 of our plan, which means we have ~~done nothing except create a Facebook page and post memes~~ made some inspirational marketing imagery featuring QUOTES ON SPACE BACKGROUNDS. But this is literally definitely going to happen!\n\n###We can do this, Reddit!\n\n[I actually like Jackson and Nolan very much, but the only reason they were mentioned by the creators behind this project is because they are among the first names to pop into the heads of average action/adventure audiences. Jackson's only sci-fi work, as far as I know, has been the *Halo* movie that never was and producing *District 9*, which I enjoyed but was certainly not some kind of *2001*-esque depiction of space exploration. And just because Nolan made *The Dark Knight* trilogy and **I N C E P T I O N** {rofl see what I did there}, both of which were grounded enough to pass most audiences' suspension of disbelief but would hardly qualify as ultra-realism, doesn't mean he would be the best choice or even want to be involved in a big-budget sci-fi epic/documentary/whatever this thing is supposed to be.](/ooc)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354730933", "subreddit": "magicskyfairy", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "They only go in that order because that's how it goes in pitch terms.\n\nMusic is arranged into Octaves, which are 12 semitones apart.  They're also numbered.  So C1 is a particular note (it's very low) and D1 is slightly higher, E1 slightly higher, and so on, F1, G1, A1, B1, then C2, D2, etc etc, with all the sharps and flats between them, if that makes sense.\n\nKeys are determined with certain rules.  A major scale, going up from the first note to the last, when it reaches that same note but an octave higher, follows this order:\n\nTone, Tone, Semitone, Tone, Tone, Tone, Semitone.\n\nSo I'll write out all the notes in an octave and show you how that works.\n\nC  &lt;----- we start here, because it's C major.  So we go up a tone, which is two keys on a piano (including blacks)\n\nC# (aka Db) ....which means we skip C# cause that's just a semitone\n\nD ...and end up on D, the second note of the scale.  We then go up a tone again....\n\nD# (AKA Eb)\n\nE ...and end up on E, the third note.  Next up is a semitone, which takes us to...\n\nF ...F.  We then go up a tone again, as specified\n\nF# (AKA Gb)\n\nG ...to G, then another\n\nG# (AKA Ab)\n\nA ...to A, and then one more\n\nA# (AKA Bb)\n\nB ....to B. Then, to finish off, we go up one more semitone...\n\nC ...which takes us back to C.\n\nEvery major scale works like this.  G major is the same, T T S T T T S, but starting on G instead.\n\nHarmonic Minor scales take the form T S T T S, then one and a half tones, then finally a semitone.\n\nEDIT: other keys are determined in other ways. \n\nGonna have to introduce you to another concept, degrees of the scale.\n\nA major scale/key has eight notes in it that a composer has to work with and they have particular names and a roman numeral.\n\nC is the tonic, I\nD is the supertonic, II, because it is above the tonic\nE is the mediant, III, mid way between the tonic and the dominant\nF is the subdominant, IV\nG is the dominant, V\nA is the submediant, VI, because god knows why\nB is the leading note, VII,\nAnd then we're back to I again with C.\n\nThe same applies for any other major key/scale.\n\nIn blues music, the 'blues scale' is used, which means that the 3rd, and 7th degrees of the scale, the mediant, dominant and leading note, are flattened.  In blues music in the key of C, composers can also work with Eb and Bb, which gives the music a distinctive 'bluesy' sound.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354743268", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is called [learned helplessness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness). Basically it can happen when you believe you've tried \"everything\" to make things better and nothing works, so you feel helpless and stop trying. \n\nI believe it's Tony Robbins that says you should not buy into this idea that you've already tried e v e r y t h i n g  possible to achieve your goal. It's a fallacy. Not to diminish your effort,  and there is no doubt you did your best and studied hard, but you tried *one way* of studying for a couple of tests, and they didn't work out like you wanted. You just have to find a better way, keep going, be persistent, and try as many different things as many times as it takes until you get what you want. Other people have done and will do well in that and every class, so you have to believe that there *is* a way for you to get a good grade in any class, you just have to find it. If you have to retake every class 100 times or more to get the grades you want, so be it. That's how committed you have to be if you really want it.\n\nSo instead of this self-pity and depression, you should pick yourself up and start looking for more solutions. Figure out the secrets; find out what it takes. Read books about getting good grades in college. Ask people who are getting better grades what their secrets are. Go to your school's academic center to ask for advice. You get the idea.

He's playing triplets but instead of accenting every third (the downbeat previously established) he accents every fourth. \n\ntriplets on the downbeat      = l o o l o o l o o l o o \nhis modulation (still triplets) = l o o o l o o o l o o o\n l . . l . . l . . l . .    \n l . . . l . . . l . . . \n\nHe takes this freshly modulated downbeat and improvises over it.

However, the siren song of a well modulated meter is difficult to resist and that proves to be true here. They do well enough holding it together and the drummer gives them a fill that lets everyone know where the downbeat is when it all comes back.\n\nIf you follow the triplet accent pattern and replace it as a new down beat he'll bring you right back to one around 1:48.

{"body": "* Answer 1: there are actually 2 blues scales to use, the major and minor.  The major blues scales is a minor blues scale from the 6th.  So over a G major or G7 chord, play E minor blues: E G A A# B D.  The second mode of this scale is G A A# B D E, or 1 2 #2 3 5 6.  On a G blues, use this scale (G major blues) over bars 1-4(G7).  Use G minor blues (G Bb C C# D F) over bars 5-6 (C7) for a funky sound. Go back to G major blues for bars 7-8(G7 again).  Over bars 9-10 (Am7-D7), play from relevant modes of the G major diatonic (G A B C D E F# G).  Over bars 11-12 (G7-E7-Am7-D7), play bebop turnaround licks, which usually are based more on chord tones and chromaticism than scales.\n\n* Answer 2:  The blues is all about feel.  You have to be able to just \"play the blues\".  It's not always about the hippest scales and substitutions.  Sometimes it's about NOT playing all the hippest substitutions and just playing something simply, with good time, dynamics, and timbre.

{"body": "My absolute favorite Fox News article just came out:\n\n&gt; President Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel are lifetime members of the same gay bath house in uptown Chicago, according to informed sources in Chicago’s gay community, as well as veteran political sources in the city.\n\n&gt; The bath house, Man’s Country, caters to older white men and it has been in business for some 30 years and is known as one of uptown Chicago’s “grand old bathhouses.” WMR was told by sources who are familiar with the bath house that it provides one-year “lifetime” memberships to paying customers and that the club’s computerized files and pre-computer paper files, include membership information for both Obama and Emanuel. The data is as anonymized as possible for confidentiality purposes. However, sources close to “Man’s Country” believe the U.S. Secret Service has purged the computer and filing cabinet files of the membership data on Obama and Emanuel.\n\n&gt; Members of Man’s Country are also issued club identification cards. WMR learned that Obama and Emanuel possessed the ID cards, which were required for entry.\n\n&gt; Obama began frequenting Man’s Country in the mid-1990s, during the time he transitioned from a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School to his election as an Illinois State Senator in 1996.\nEmanuel, reportedly joined Man’s Country after he left the Clinton White House and moved back to Chicago in 1998, joining the investment firm of Wasserstein Perella and maintaining his membership during his\n2002 campaign for the U.S. 5th District House seat vacated by Rod Blagojevich, who was elected governor.\n\n&gt; Man’s Country appears to be a “one stop shopping” center for gay men. The club’s website advertises steam rooms, “fantasy rooms,” bed rooms, male strippers, adult movies, and lockers.\n\n&gt; However, Man’s Country was not the only location for Obama’s predatory gay activities. The Chicago gay community is aware that Obama often made contacts with younger men at his famous “pick-up basketball” games. It was at these “pick up” matches where Obama first met Emanuel and a young Democratic campaign worker and senior bank vice president named Alexi Giannoulias. Currently running for Obama’s old U.S. Senate seat now occupied by Roland Burris, Giannoulias successfully ran for Illinois Treasurer in 2006 after being drafted for the run by Chicago’s Democratic machine.”\n\n&gt; “Man’s Country, one of Chicago’s “grand old bathhouses” and located at 5015 North Clark Street in Chicago’s “Boystown,” was a frequent hangout for State Senator Obama and Rahm Emanuel.\nSources in Chicago’s gay community report that Obama was attracted to Man’s Country’s older white clientele because he generally enjoys being f e l l a t e d by older white men. Obama would regularly be seen at Man’s Country on Wednesdays.\n\n&gt; Obama reportedly has never engaged in reciprocal activity. The sources also confirm the allegations made during the 2008 campaign by Larry Sinclair, a Chicago visitor who revealed that in 1999 he engaged in such oral s e x\nactivity and crack cocaine use with then-State senator Obama on two occasions, once in the back of a Chicago limousine operated by Five Star Limousine Service, and the other at a Chicago area motel, the Comfort Suites in Gurnee, Illinois.”\n\n&gt; “Chicago’s “DLC” — not the Democratic Leadership Council but the “Down Low Club” — a gay matchmaking service. WMR spoke to several well-placed sources in Chicago who reported that Jeremiah Wright, the pastor of Obama’s former church of 20 years, Trinity United Church of Christ (TUCC) on Chicago’s south side, ran what was essentially a matchmaking service for gay married b l a c k professional members of the church, including lawyers and\nbusinessmen, particularly those with children. The matchmaking club was called the “Down Low Club” but references to it over the phone and email simply referred to the group with the code phrase “DLC.” The ruse, according to our sources, was to make anyone who was eavesdropping on the communications believe that the references were to the Democratic Leadership Council, also known as the DLC.\n\n&gt; The gay DLC’s services were intended to keep ensure TUCC’s gay members avoided posting solicitations on web services like Craig’s List and refrain from cruising gay bars. The strategy was to protect them from getting busted\nand being “outed.”\n\n&gt; Among the members of the gay “DLC” were Obama and TUCC’s choir director, Donald Young, an openly gay man who reportedly had a sexual relationship with Obama.\n\n&gt; Two other gay members of the church were Larry Bland and Nate Spencer. Young and Bland were brutally murdered, execution style, in late 2007. Bland was murdered on November 17, 2007 and Young on December 24, 2007. The latter was killed by multiple gunshot wounds. Spencer reportedly died on December 26, 2007, official cause of death: “septicemia, pneumonia, and HIV.”\n\n&gt; “DLC” members often went on camping trips arranged by TUCC. Wright reportedly was the head of the “DLC” matchmaking services and ensured that its members protected each other.\n\n&gt; The “DLC’s” clientele included Obama and other gay members of TUCC, including, reportedly Young, Bland, and Spencer. Fox 32 Chicago reported that Bland’s mother, Josephine Bland, was so upset at her son inviting men\ninto their home as a result of contacting them through gay web sites like “Adam4Adam,” she moved out.\n\n&gt; The gay community in Chicago knows to keep away from the TUCC and “DLC” stories because of the “creepiness” of the operation and the suspicious deaths of the three TUCC gay b l a c k men.”\n\nRead more: http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/supreme-court-to-hear-gay-marriage-cases-84774.html#ixzz2EPrxpYVK\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354927012", "subreddit": "politics", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;when looking at pictures of our Milky Way or other galaxies, are the brighter stars closer?\n\nNot necessarily. There are two main things you need to consider, the true luminosity of the star and the distance. Luminosity is how much light the star produces and is connected with temperature. Stars appear Blue, yellow and red, blue being the hottest and red the coolest.  Therefore blue stars are the most luminous (with the exception of giants and super giants, but that's another story).  Anyway, the second thing to consider is the distance. Star luminosity is classified by \"O B A F G K M\" with O being the most luminous (blue) and M being the least luminous. There are some stars in the sky, for example star 1, that **seem** very bright (apparent luminosity) compared to star 2. Now star 1 might be only a \"K star\" in terms of luminosity, but if its a lot closer to us than star 2, which is a \"F star\" (a higher true luminosity), we would think that star 1 is more luminous. But if star 2 was indeed closer to us than star 1, we would obviously see star 2 as the brighter star. \n\nSo to answer your question, stars that appear brightest could be farther away and just super luminous. Or the stars that seem brightest really aren't that luminous, but are just really close. Brightness is pretty unreliable in telling which star is closer, so we calculate its distance using the stars parallax angle. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1354998071", "subreddit": "Astronomy", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let's walk through the construction of a van Laarhoven lens from the basic idea of a lens as a getter and a setter.\n\nStart with a lens a a 'getter' `(s -&gt; a)`  and a 'setter' `(s -&gt; a -&gt; s)`\n\nYou could then tuple them up into a data type for lenses:\n\n    data Lens s a = Lens (s -&gt; a) (s -&gt; a -&gt; s)\n\nor maybe even fuse the fact that they both start with (s -&gt;) to get\n\n    data Lens s a = Lens (s -&gt; (a -&gt; s, a))\n\nThe former is the version I used in my stackoverflow response on lenses, the latter is what I used in data-lens.\n\nBut this required us to make up a data type.\n\nTwan van Laarhoven came up with a way to CPS this form of a lens in a blog post a few years back.\n\nWhat he did was use\n\n    type Lens s a = forall f. Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; s -&gt; f s\n\nwhich looks complicated, but lets implement one\n\n    _2 f (a,b) = (,) a &lt;$&gt; f b\n\nthe fact that we retrieved the 'b' out of (a,b)  is playing the role of the getter.\n\nthe fact that we put back the parts we didn't use after fmapping is playing the role of the setter.\n\nThis is just the `data-lens` lens in disguise!\n\nThe tricky part is figuring out how to read from or write to it.\n\nWe can read from or write to the lens by choosing the Functor. \n\nIf we choose `Const`\n\n    view l s = getConst $ l Const s\n\nthen\n\n    view _2 (x,y) = getConst $ (\\ f (a,b) = (,) a &lt;$&gt; f b) Const (x,y)\n                   = getConst $ (,) x &lt;$&gt; Const y\n                   = getConst $ Const y\n                   = y\n\nif we choose `Identity`:\n\n    over l g s = runIdentity $ l (Identity . g) s\n\nthen\n    \n    over _2 (+1) (x,y) = runIdentity $ (\\ f (a,b) = (,) a &lt;$&gt; f b) (Identity .

If you just type in those definitions without any signatures the type system will tell you what has to stay the same and what can vary.\n\nSimilarly for the signature of `_2`.\n\nThis lets us generalize the notion of a lens, by saying that the type of the contents you put back may not be the same as the type of the part you took out.\n\n    type Lens s t a b = forall f. Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; s -&gt; f t\n\nThat may look scary but in 'getter/setter' form:\n\n* You have a getter: `(s -&gt; a)` that says you can get an `a` out of an `s`.\n\n* You have a setter: `(s -&gt; b -&gt; t)` that says if you replace that `a` with a `b` you get a `t`.\n\nWhenever you are in doubt in the four value form you can always instantiate a = b, s = t, or otherwise it isn't a legal lens. ;)\n\nFinally, we can see how the notion of lens starts to generalize:\n\nIf you restrict the signature of `Lens` to only allow `view` by limiting the Functor to stuff that works like `Const` you get a `Getter`\n\nIf you restrict it to only allow `over` by limiting the Functor to stuff that works like `Identity`, you have a `Setter.\n\nIf you use &lt;*&gt; in the \"lens\" construction, you get a traversal, and the definition looks a lot like you were writing an appropriate instance of `Traversable`!\n\n    both f (a,b) = (,) &lt;$&gt; f a &lt;*&gt; f b\n\ngives you the traversal of both halves of a pair.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355121205", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**This is going to seem like a very tall order. Just read it. Trust me. If you can learn even a FRACTION of this, you've already got a HUGE leg up on the competition for your skill bracket.**\n\n1) Until you memorize every note on every string always keep a handy chart around for whatever tuning you are in that shows every note on every string.\n\n2) Get a cheap musical keyboard if you don't already own one. It doesn't have to be fancy, because you're not using it to gig, you're using it to learn how chords are constructed, what certain intervals sound like, how the modes of the major scale are derived, and to formulate rough scratch melodies before transposing them to guitar. This part is I feel pretty important. While you do eventually need to understand how music theory relates to the guitar, learning music theory ON the guitar, is IMO, a sub par medium. The guitar just isn't built in a way that is conducive to learning theory. It's so much easier to visualize things, as a beginner, on a piano/keyboard.\n\n3) Okay, now the next step is to learn the following things.\n\nWhat are the intervals? Start with, for example, C. C to C# is a m2 (minor second). C to D is a M2 (major second). Learn and memorize the intervals up to an Octave (C1 to C2).\n\n* C1 to C1 is called a Unison. Pointless and redundant, IMO.\n\n* C to C# is a minor second. Represented m2.\n\n* C to D is a major second. Represented M2.\n\n* C to D# is a minor third. Represented m3.\n\n* C to E is a major third. Represented M3.\n\n* C to F is a perfect fourth. Represented P4, or sometimes just 4.\n\n* C to F# is a tritone. Represented TT. The tritone is a special interval. It falls precisely halfway between your fundamental (C1) and the octave of your fundamental (C2). It's the most disonnant interval you can play. It tends to break up tonality and destroy melodiousness (which isn't necessarily bad, if that's what you're going for). It can sound painful to listen to.\n\n* C to G is a perfect fifth. Represented P5 or sometimes just 5. It's interesting to note that powerchords are merely a fundamental followed by a perfect 5th, and then followed by an octave of the fundamental. In this way, powerchords aren't *actually* chords, but rather just harmonies. (ex. C-G-C, D-A-D, ect.)\n\n* C to G# is a minor sixth. Represented m6.\n\n* C to A is a major sixth. Represented M6.\n\n* C to A# is a minor seventh. Represented m7.\n\n* C to B is a major seventh. Represented M7.\n\n* C1 to C2 is an octave.\n\nHow are chords constructed? Particularly triads, seventh chords, and sus2/4 chords.\n\nYou need to know the minor triad, the diminished triad, the augmented triad, and obviously the major triad, how each relates to the Major scale (Ionian mode), how you would say, arrive at a C minor (aug, sus, dim) triad from a C major triad (lowering the 3rd by a semitone), ect.\n\nNext you want to learn the following basic scales.\n\n* Major/Relative Natural Minor\n* Harmonic Minor\n* Melodic Minor\n* Blues Scale\n* Pentatonic Major/Minor\n\nPlease please PLEASE do not learn the box shapes for these scales on guitar. I made that mistake when I learned to play guitar and carried that mistake for years. That sort of thinking in music can only be a weakness and it will make anything you write or play sound stale and contrived.\n\nInstead you need to learn how these scales are constructed, what order of whole/half steps are used to construct the scales. What intervals are found in the scales. Later down the line what basic chords you can play over the scales.\n\nOkay, now that you've learned all that, you're ready to get to the crust of how you'll compose music from here on out. It's time to learn about the modes. Modal playing is an excellent way to approach metal~~core~~, or really any genre of music outside of pop/classic rock.\n\nModes are scales built from the same notes (enharmonic) of base scales, such as Major, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Pentatonic, ect. While it's good to know that there are modes to Harmonic Minor/Melodic Minor, the only modes I want you to focus on actually learning for right now the modes of the Major Scale and the Pentatonic Major scale. It's worth noting that two of the scales you learned earlier (relative natural minor and pentatonic minor) are just modes of other scales (Major and Pentatonic Major).\n\nOkay so the modes work like this.\n\n* You have C Major (Ionian Mode) which would be C D E F G A B C.\n\nThat's in the key of C. C is your root note precisely because, and only because, you intentionally fall back on that note and use that note as a resolution to your scale. It should (almost) always be the last note you play in a phrase, and preferably (but not necessarily) the first note you play as well.\n\n* Now if you take that same grouping of notes and instead us D as your root you have Dorian mode. So now your scale is D E F G A B C D. Dorian is a minor mode and has a very dark and almost evil sound to it. Sometimes referred to as the gypsy mode, it can be used to make some very sad and tense music.\n\n* Phrygian (minor) Mode is E F G A B C D E. Phrygian has an almost exotic feel. Some people describe it as feeling \"egyptian\" or \"arabic\". I hear it a lot in metalcore, as well as the harmonic minor scale on occasion, which has a similar quality to it, but sounds quite a bit more tense.\n\n* Lydian (major) Mode is F G A B C D E F. Lydian has a pretty interesting flavour and is one of my favorites. It has a very ethereal, ghostly quality to it, especially if you accent the 4th degree of the scale. Really good one to play over slow, melodic chord progressions.\n\n* Mixolydian (major) Mode is G A B C D E F G. The absolute best way to describe this one is midieval. It has a folksy knights and dragons, damsels in distress, fucking vikings mother fucker, feel to it. I don't hear this a whole hell of a lot in metalcore, but that does not mean that it doesn't have a place. What you can use is limited only by your imagination and skill.\n\n* Aeolian (natural minor) A B C D E F G A. This is the most basic minor scale used in music. It has a \"softly sad\" feel to it, but when played right can also convey contentment or bittersweetness.\n\n* Locrian (diminished) Mode B C D E F G A B. Diminished is pretty hard mode to work with. It's 5th degree is a tritone to it's root (tritone being the most disonnant interval you can possibly play in the western 12 tone system of music), which has the effect of breaking up its tonal quality. It doesn't like to resolve much and it has an offbeat, almost slapstick sound, but if you can learn to use it well it's good for slower and more plodding heavy metal.\n\nNow you can also do this with the pentatonic scales, harmonic minor scales, melodic minor scales, ect. Really any basic scale with the exception of symetrical scales (see whole tone, half-whole step diminished). The basic idea is the same across the board. Take the notes of that scale in a given key, and use a different note in that scale as your root and you'll have a whole new flavor from the same set of notes. A good way to really bring out the qualities of the modes is to drone your root note. This is where I would recommend getting a good strong relationship with your bassist.\n\nThat said, even though I want you to learn the modes in that manner, sometimes you might not want to change keys every time you change modes. So I would recommend learning what degrees of the Major scale to raise or lower to get the mode of that scale *in the same key*.\n\nSo instead of accenting D as your root note when switching from C Major to Dorian Mode, you might want to instead take the C major scale and flatten the 3rd and 7th degrees of the scale (E and B) by a semitone (half-step). So now instead of Dorian in the key of D you have Dorian in the key of C.\n\nHere's how you would arrive at the different modes within the same key.\n\n* Ionian-Au Natural. In C it would be C D E F G A B C.\n\n* Dorian minor-flat the 3rd and 7th. In C it would be C D Eb F G A Bb C.\n\n* Phrygian minor-flat the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th. In C it would be C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C.\n\n* Lydian major-sharp the 4th. In C it would be C D E F# G A B C.\n\n* Mixolydian major-flat the 7th. In C it would be C D E F G A Bb C.\n\n* Aeolian minor-flat the 3rd, 6th, and 7th. In C it would be C D Eb F G Ab Bb C.\n\n* Locrian diminished-flat the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th. In C it would be C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C.\n\nNow where this becomes useful is, lets say that your rhythm guitarist is playing the chords C major (C-E-G), E minor (E-G-B), and A minor (A-C-E). Now the notes C, E, G, B, and A are all locked in. You can't flat or sharp any of those notes without sounding out of key. But you know that if you take the C major scale and change only one or two notes, you can switch modes very easily on the fly while still remaining in key. In this case you could play in Ionian mode or Lydian mode. If you started in Ionian mode all you would have to do is change one note (F to F#) in your playing to switch to a different scale and still be in key.\n\n**Modal playing is very easy in metal~~core~~. Because so much of metal~~core~~ is chugging the open top string in a dropped tuning, it's very easy to drone that root note and go off into modal riffing based on that.**\n\n4) Another concept you'll want to learn if you want to play (good) metalcore is syncopation. This requires you to learn how to count rhythms in various time signatures such as 4/4 (1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;). Basically if you wanted to syncopate a rhythm you might chug out (1) &amp; 2 (&amp;) 3 (&amp;) (4) (&amp;) wherein the beats in parenthases are the notes you'll play and the beats outside of parenthases will be rests.\n\nThere's all kinds of things you can do with this, limited only to your imagination.\n\n5) Try to get a good feel for triplets, which is playing three beats over a rhythm of two beats. Basically if you played 1 &amp; 2 &amp; (3-trip-let) 4 &amp; the part in parenthases would be your triplet. 3-trip-let should be equal in time to 3 &amp;.\n\n* 3 &amp; equals two notes played.\n\n* 3-trip-let equals three notes played.\n\n* But they should be completely equal in the amount of time taken to play them.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the chugging that metalcore bands tend to do (which is still a technique I'd learn, btw) which is actually three quarter notes and a quarter rest rather than three equal value notes spread out over two beats.\n\n6) I'd learn to play in a few other time signatures, specifically 6/8ths time. This is a great metal~~core~~ rhythm and can add a more interesting dynamic to a piece.\n\n7) I'm not going to say that you absolutely must learn to read sheet music, but it's not as hard as you think (especially if you don't plan on learning to sight read and just want to learn the basics) and it can only help with learning theory.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355158652", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "the laziness of so many supports is what has lead me to play a lot of support zyra. I run her 9/0/21 with AP masteries (mpen reds, armor yellow, MR blues, AP quints). I only take 1 point in the bonus starting gold and start every match with flask, 2 wards, 1 pink ward. First buy is a sightstone, then kages, core is Ruby sightstone, Mpen boots, kages, Rylai's. The Rylais not only lets you be tanky enough to be attacked a little but it makes your Q and E slow (in addition to E's root) making you a peeling machine. Skill order is E W E Q then R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q. \n\nYou can get almost for sure kills at level 6 with root, X2 lashers, Ult, Q. By mid game you will actually be able to solo low health enemies rather than just be more food for them (i am talking 25% low not 5%). Team fight damage is great, and if you are killed you get a 500 true damage skill shot to wreck with. \n\nLaning is easy, a lot like playing a poke orientated lulu. Once you learn to combo with the seeds you can do a lot of damage and force most lower range carries out of lane quickly. Zyra Caitlyn is super strong because you can root X2 lashers + trap behind them, easy kills at any level. \n\nThere is one big problem with support zyra though...you WILL get kills. This is not really avoidable as your plants hit really hard and you can't control them. A lot of ADC's will bitch that you are \"stealing their kills\" even when you burst 75%+ off of the person you killed. Learning how to use your E without really messing with your ADC's CS can be rough too. \n\nThere are some neat things though. You can use seeds and your E to check brush. You can use your plants to tank dragon, they die in 2 hits but it enables a fairly safe adc+support dragon early (like right after you murder your lane at 6).

Maybe with thread colors and weave patterns of different sizes, guarantee the output shows at least one repetition of each so nothing gets cut off.\n\n    W  B\n\n    O U O U O O O U U O O O O O O\n    O U O O U O O O O U U O O O O\n    O O U O O U O O O O O U U O O\n    O O U O O O U O O O O O O U U\n\n      W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W|W\n    B B W B W B B B W W B B B B B B\n    B B W B B W B B B B W W B B B B\n    B B B W B B W B B B B B W W B B\n    B B B W B B B W B B B B B B W W\n\nFinally, maybe for [Hard], allow for additional parameters such as \"rotate\", \"mirror\", \"underside\" (shows what the underside of the fabric would look like, i.e. the reverse of the over/under) and produce the proper output.  Remember, operations like rotate will require a modification of the thread patterns so that everything comes out with the right color.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355242140", "subreddit": "dailyprogrammer_ideas", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not many people realize what it is like to be a jets fan. Let me preface the rest of this post with the fact that I have been a Jets fan since I was 5 years old. \n\nSunday Morning 9:30, you wake up and get out of bed, it feels good to be awake and it's an absolutely gorgeous day out. Then you look down at your phone and realize what day of the week it is. Oh no it's Sunday. All the positive energy you had for the week up until that day flows out of you faster than air from a balloon. Walk over the the closet and grab your favorite Jets jersey hoping maybe this week it will be lucky. \n\nAt this point in the season your past the point of hoping that your team will win. No you want a loss. You want something that will make Woody Johnson fire Rex and Mark Sanchez (who I don't think is a terrible QB but that's a subject for a different post just know I'm not saying he is a good QB either). Maybe they will go on a downward spiral these last 5 games and you will end up with a top 5 draft pick, a new coach, and a new quarterback. The jersey feels particularly heavy this Sunday I believe because the fabric absorbs all the broken dreams suffered by Jets fans over the years. At this point you wander off to the local watering hole, because lets be honest who really wants to watch the Jets alone. You arrive and are greeted by some of the other long sufferers like John the thrice divorced attorney who knows every possible scenario the Jets could make the playoffs this year, Mike who well only comes to watch the Jets game so he can escape from the drudgery of being an accountant but is honestly one of the most pessimistic people you will ever meet, then there is Andrea who might know more about football than any guy you have ever met. All 4 of you assume the familiar position at the bar and settle in to watch the game.\n\nAs the game starts some rowdier, and more naivete fans try to rally the crowd with J E T S Jets Jets Jets, and yeah you sing along because well this comes with the territory. You watch as your mediocre team, with mediocre talent play an incredibly boring game of football.  \n\nThe whole time the game is on there is a pall of despair over the crowd, because as a Jets fan there is just enough hope given to the fans for dreams to be dashed. Nobody knows at what point the dreams will be dashed, but every year it happens there is a particular sound that is hard to describe it's similar to the sound of a heart breaking. At the end of the game whether they win or lose you know that your team will never improve until some serious upper level changes are made. \n\n[Then again it could be worse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCHZFwDCNyA)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355271283", "subreddit": "nfl", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here are my steps for getting two objects docked.\n\n* Get first object into a circular orbit doesnt have to be perfect.\n* When putting second object into orbit try for an orbit that is at least 50km above the first(makes things easier later).\n* Once everything is in orbit go to your second ship (the higher one).\n* Open your map view \"M\" and click on the first ship and set it as target.\n* You should get two points on your orbit \"AN\" and \"DN\" these are the points where your two crafts orbits intersect, and displays the degree of inclination. Make a adjustment node at whichever is closest in your orbit.\n* If its the \"AN\" node slowly drag down the bottom handle (I think the top and bottom ones are purple, my memory is failing me and I'm at work so cant look\" while hovering your cursor over the node until the degree of inclination is 0.\n* Point your ship at the new marker on your nave ball (blue i think) and then warp out to about 30 seconds from the node.\n* depending on how much thrust your ship has, and how far your off in degrees your need to start your burn at different times. I usually make a quick save and make a 100% burn and look at the time to see how long i will need to burn for then quick load and do it for real. \n* Start your burn at half the time needed for the adjustment. So if the estimated burn time is 30 seconds then start your burn at 15s.\n* Now that both of your ships are in a matching orbit you need to rendezvous. Make a quick save now because this will take some practice.\n* Fast forward till the lower obit ship is just a little ways behind the higher ship. (this is part of the reason for having a different altitude, they travel at different speeds so you can wait to have them at different positions)\n* Make another orbital adjustment node a little ways ahead of your ship (your still flying the higher ship right now) and use it to drop your volosity (green node?) so that your orbit drops to come in contact with the lower ship. ( Make sure you still have the lower ship selected as your target, when you quick load it will deselect)\n* At some point you should get one or two different markers on yours and the other ships orbit, looks like arrows pointing up and down with a line in the middle. Once those first show start moving the whole node back and forward in your orbit ( clock the main circle of the node and just drag it around)  \n* This may take some time to get to work and some saving and loading to change how close the ships are when you start, but eventually you should get the arrow on your and the other ships orbit right next to each other. I usually try for 1-2 km separation on this first node. \n* Once you got that quick save again.\n* Make another node about half way between your ship and the meeting point and just play with its position and changes till you can get the separation down to about .2km.\n* Keep quicksaving when you have make a successful adjustment burn.\n* Ok now time warp to about a min before the ships meet.\n* Your speed meeter should say \"target\" above it, if ti doesn't make sure you still have the ship selected and just click it till it does. \n * When it says target your prograde and retrograde markers on the nav ball now are no longer your ships directions. They now indicate relitive volosity of the two ships. Burning prograde will increase relative velocity and retrograde decrease it. \n* Point your ship at the retrograde marker and once they are very close to each other burn it full blast until your relative velocity is 0.\n* now you should be able to see your other ship in view somewhere (pressing F4 I think brings up ship markers)\n* Point your ship at the other (purple marker??) and burn so they start to move together. Don't go to fast or you wont be able to flip around and stop again.\n* Once your getting pretty close flip around and kill the speed to 0 again.\n* Now you should be very close to each other.

{"body": "I'm assuming this is C.\n\nFirst, \"rows\" and \"columns\" aren't really relevant concepts since the elements are not laid out spatially in the computer. The only ordering that matters is wheter the elements end up in memory as\n\n    A A A A B B B B\n\nor as\n\n    A B A B A B A B\n\nIn C, it's easy to figure that out by reasoning about it, because if you have an array, consecutive elements of that array are ordered consecutively in memory:\n\n  array[0] array[1] array[2] array[3] ...\n\nThen just imagine that `array` in the example in turn happens to be a member of a bigger array. Replace `array` with, say, `two_dimensional_array[7]` and you will see that it has to be the *last* index in the expression that indexes the innermost array, since each member of `two_dimensional_array[7]` are consecutive in memory, with `two_dimensional_array[7]` in turn being consecutive with `two_dimensional_array[6]`. Example:\n\n    int a[5][3];\n\nIn memory, you get:\n\n    a[0][0] a[0][1] a[0][2] a[1][0] a[1][1] a[1][2] a[2][0] a[2][1] a[2][2] ...\n\n&gt;int data[3][5]={1,2,3,4,5}{1,2,3,4,5}{1,2,3,4,5}\n\nJust like you use braces to enclose the members of the inner array, so you also use braces to enclose the members of the outer array. So you have an array of 3 members, with each member being an array of 5 members. Initialisation looks like this:\n\n    int data[3][5]={\n        {1,2,3,4,5},\n        {1,2,3,4,5},\n        {1,2,3,4,5}\n    };\n\nAbout floating point vs integers, floating point is appropriate when you need to be able to represent numbers of a very wide range, including non-integers, but the exact precision isn't important. Essentially, a `float` gives you a very large range of values but a limited number of significant digits. So a `float` might be able to represent 0.00000001 as well as 1000000000, but will not be able to represent 1000000001 because you only get a limited number of significant digits (about 7 for a single-precision standard `float`). So to represent money, don't make the mistake of using a `float` \"because it's not a whole number\". It is a whole number, but it's a whole number of pence, not a whole number of pounds.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355448535", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One simple way to look at modes is as simple major scales that start on different notes.\n\nFor example, C major starts on C and goes C D E F G A B C.  D dorian uses the same notes as C major, but starts on D, so it is D E F G A B C D.  The modes in order are Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian.  So if we take a scale, like F, the F scale starting on F is F Ionian (or just major, no one really says Ionian), the F scale starting on G is G dorian, the F scale starting on A is A Phrygian, etc etc.\n\nOne point that is important to note is that the Aeolian mode is the same thing as the natural minor scale.  \n\nEach mode has different uses in music.

As evidence, a tragedy which occurred yesterday in China, and represents a recurrent scene in that country.  http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-man-slashes-22-children-near-china-school-20121214,0,6383015.story. \n\nYes, the US might have one of the highest firearm-related death rates (9 / 100,000), however 65% (OAS 2011) of these deaths are suicides and firearm-related homicides account for 2.98 / 100,000, which puts the US in a slightly higher but similar firearm-related homicide rate as its European counterparts.\n\nThe highest firearm-related homicide rate can be found in Latin America with ~50 / 100,000 (El Salvador) The  list of the countries with the most firearm-related homicides include Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, Swaziland, Colombia, Brazil, P A N A M A (13 / 100,000), and Mexico (in that order according to OAS 2011).\n\nRegarding the mental health of the perpetrators, 3 – 20% of all Homicides are committed by a Mentally ill individual. One study found that Homicides perpetrated by UNTREATED mentally ill patients accounts for 10% of the homicides. These studies imply that most of the homicides are committed by mentally “Healthy” individuals.\n(“Sane”) People Kill People.\n\nLas cucharas no te engordan.

El Salvador encabeza la lista con 50 / 100,000 y le siguen Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, Swaziland, Colombia, Brasil, P A N A M A (13 / 100,000) y México. (Según OAS, 2011).\n\nCon respecto al estado de salud mental de los perpetradores, 3 a 20% de los homicidios los comete una persona con problemas de salud mental. Un estudio encontró que 10% de los homicidios son perpetrados por personas con problemas de salud mental quienes han dejado sus medicamentos.

They seem to get the number from http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/ but I can't find where they get the numbers.\n\nI found [this German source](http://www.dsb.de/infothek/recht/waffenrecht/aktuelles/meldung/4361-Waffenbesitz-in-Deutschland/) regarding legal weapons and that would bring down Germany to 7000/100k instead of 30000/100k like on page 652.\n\n....\n\nOk i think I found what I was looking for...\n\nhttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2001/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2001-Chapter-02-EN.pdf\n\n&gt; G e r m a n y : Germany explained that ‘accurate figures are not obtainable since registration of \nentitled persons takes place at the lowest administrative level and is not centrally collected.’\nInstead, the German Government offered a ‘realistic guesstimate’ of **10 million licensed firearms\nowners but provided no estimate for actual firearms. The most recent estimates of actual firearms,\nfrom 1972, put the number in the range of 15 to 25 million.** Moreover, the ‘guesstimate’ on gun\nowners and the old range for actual guns covered only the territory of the former West Germany;\nrecords for the former East Germany reportedly ‘were deliberately destroyed’.\n\nSo the person did **not** use the number for  Rate of Gun Ownership, **but** the one for amount of guns. Which in my opinion is a completely worthless statistic. Not to mention that there were a lot of weapons in private possession after all the wars, east Germany etc. I still remember how 15 years ago someone cleaned up some old hand grenades from our attic my grandpa probably had lying around there for some decades (no idea why), it was probably the same with many weapons.   \n\n---\n\n\nAnother thing I found, suicide table page 687 does not match with this. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate\n\nProbably old data as the rate has significantly dropped in Germany\n\nhttp://www.br.de/themen/ratgeber/suizid-selbstmord-deutschland100~_v-image853_-7ce44e292721619ab1c1077f6f262a89f55266d7.jpg?version=1327593695986", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355645279", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

Simplify it if you can, since there is a lot of visual noise going on with the illustration with all the lines. Also, investigate a type only solution where you communicate the different specializations without resorting to a lot of illustration. A good start is just writing out \"L O V I N G\" and seeing what you can make out of any of the letters that deal with your offerings [example 1](http://dribbble.com/shots/347912-Fitpig-logo-study) [example 2](http://dribbble.com/shots/470200-Swoll-Logo)\n\n\nAlso the typeface used does not really pair well with the angular illustration style.

{"body": "First off, colours represent notes - A = blue, B = red, C = yellow, D = navy blue, E = pink, F = sky blue, and G = orange, with sharps/flats being represented with the relevant combination of colours. The \"spokes\" of the chart are ukulele fretboards, with the highlighted notes being those that make up the scales described in the centre.\n\nYou need a little bit of music theory to understand what these scales are. Scales of this type consist of eight notes, going from a root/tonic to the same root the next octave up. For instance, the C major scale is CDEFGABC, and the notes of this are indicated on the top fretboard in the diagram. However, as is clear from the fretboard, the octave consists of 12 notes, so we're going to have to miss out several notes from the octave if we want an 8 note scale. In the case of C major, we skip C#/Db, D#/Eb, F#/Gb, G#/Fb, and A#/Bb (E#/Fb and B#/Cb never exist and so aren't there to skip). So we use the following pattern to build the C major scale, starting from C:\n\nskip, skip, step, skip, skip, skip, step\n\nYou can see this clearly if you go along the third string, either in the diagram or on an actual ukulele.\n\nMore standardly, the distance between two adjacent notes is called a semitone, and two of these is called a tone, so we can write this pattern as:\n\nTTsTTTs\n\n(also WWhWWWh gets used, which is the same thing but with W = whole and h = half)\n\nThis pattern is used to construct any major scale - for instance, if we start with G, as in the 1 o'clock fretboard in the diagram, and do the same pattern of skipping and stepping, we get:\n\nG A B C D E F#/Gb G\n\n(you can see this most clearly on the fourth string in the diagram)\n\nNow, natural minor scales are constructed in a similar way, but using a different formula:\n\nTsTTsTT\n\nIf we do this starting with A, we get A minor:\n\nA B C D E F G A\n\nBut hang on, these are the same notes as C major, but we're just starting in a different place. This gives us a new way of viewing the scale constructing patterns that we've been looking at (apologies for the slightly dodgy diagram):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tl03y.jpg\n\nWe can use this circle to determine the pattern we use - we take an entry point, then go clockwise until we're back where we started, and major and minor are just different entry points in this circle, and so are directly related to one another.\n\nWhat if we use different entry points? These all have fancy Greek names, as follows (like major and minor, they're sometimes associated with different \"feelings\"):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Mpt3l.jpg\n\n(note that Ionian is the same thing as major, and Aeolian is the same thing as minor)\n\nThese are shown on the main chart - for each fretboard pattern, the possible modes are shown, with the colour of the mode being the root note used.\n\nFinally, the fretboards could be arranged in any order, but for mathematical neatness, and to yield more information, I've arranged them in a [circle of fifths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths) - note how as you go round the circle, more flats and sharps appear, up until the 6 o'clock position, when they start to decrease again. This relates to the key signatures used to represent these scales in formal notation.\n\nIncidentally, I've so far noticed one error (the open G on the fourth string is missing from the 2 o'clock position), and would like to flip the fretboards round, so I'll probably make a new and slightly neater version at some point.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1355840770", "subreddit": "ukulele", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

Others in their directionless state will naturally follow a peer who has seemed to have found the path that should be taken, and all will continue on this path even if this path should call for needless sacrifice (leave the luggage on the ground, but empty baggage car) however some will refuse to make the sacrifice or perhaps are wise enough to see that its needless (two sneak their luggage) in this course of life, while each person has the illusion of individuality, in reality youre just the same as everyone else along for the ride (red black white, all an inch thick) people will generally shun the exploration of greater potential in this chosen path, for the sake of security and potential loss of its benefits (dining cart only lit, and cute waitresses) people will attempt to maintain individuality and personal identity, essentially hold on to the idea that their apart from the group, when in reality were all sharing the same experience (same car, seperate tables) there will be those who actively try to maintain a facade, and try to be that which they are not for whatever reason they have, and often convince themselves and others that they have some kind of understanding that they in actuality do not have(the englishman claims he enjoys traveling alone, yet he is the first to speak, he speaks of a schedule, but there is none) some will be fooled in to believing this facade thinking they are the ones misinformed (what schedule?)

{"body": "I don't have a source on me right now, but voiceless plosives (ptk) are very common. Most languages have at least one nasal. There are a couple languages in the Pacific Northwest which don't though. That's kind of interesting. Also, the bilabial/labiodental, dental/alveolar, and velar columns are far more common than the other ones. Languages will usually have either a voiced/voiceless distinction like English, an unaspirated/aspirated distinction like Mandarin, or both, like Ancient Greek. Some have additional more exotic things going on though.\n\nAlmost all languages have at least three vowels. a/i/u would be the most common split. This, of course, doesn't exclude the possibility for different surface forms. This is likely because an a/i/u split is the best way to maximize difference in the vowel space. The standard Latin a/e/i/o/u split is quite common too. Many languages also have a long/short distinction. Estonian has short/long/super-long, which is interesting. Languages are more likely than not to round their back vowels but not their front vowels. This makes Korean with its round/unround back vowel distinction kind of interesting, and it makes Canadian French with its *full* roundness distinction for front vowels a bit unusual too. Central vowels are less common overall.\n\nCV syllables are by far the most common. Many languages have CV but not V, so CV really is the most universal. In general, the more complex the syllable structure, the least likely it is. Also remember that syllables generally have a single sonority peak. So, a word like \"stops,\" for example, which violates that, is fairly uncommon. There are some that completely violate this though. Look up the Salishan languages if you're interested.\n\nSomething that is a lot less common than you may believe as an English speaker is approximant /ɹ/ is not common. Also very uncommon is the /ɜ/ vowel. Put them together along with an epenthetic-s and multiple coda consonants, and you get something like &lt;spurned&gt; /'spɜ˞nd/. Almost everyone on earth will have at least a little trouble with that one. English phonology is rich and complex. \n\nSo, as a general rule, keep things simple. Limit your phonotactics to simple syllables only, don't have many vowels, don't pick exotic places of articulation, and you'll have a language that's \"easy\" to pronounce. The only serious problems using your English intuition as a guide will be when dealing with r and with long vowels, and handling aspiration if you want to do that, I think.\n\n_____\nI'm working on a language with a very simple phonemic inventory, though the phonology makes it more interesting:\n\nIt's underlyingly only /a i u/ and /p t k s r n/\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356060125", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

Would you be \"amazed\" at some preacher saying \"pay your taxes\"?\n\n[Reverend Jeremiah Wright \"God Damn America\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnlRrxXv-v8)\n\nWhat if you were to render unto the United States Government that which is the United States Government's? What would you do?\n\nA dollar is just a piece of paper, no different than any other piece of paper except that it has an image imprinted upon it. Similarly, Jesus would have maintained that a metal coin with Caesar's image was just a piece of metal with an image of Caesar. In both cases, rendering unto would merely be to erase the image. Did Caesar, or did God create the metal? Did the USG, or did God, create the trees from which the paper is made?\n\nYou certainly couldn't render something that wasn't owned by you. Giving implies ownership, and exchange transfer of ownership.\n\nRoman metal coins not only had an image of Caesar but also an inscription, no different than the USD's \"In God We Trust\", except that Caesar's coins claimed \"Long Live the Son of God!\" Jesus doubly insults the Emperor with his reply, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. That's why Jesus asked for a coin to be brought before he gave his answer.\n\nAnd the Pharisees and Herodians were amazed, dumbfounded, stupified, left marveling, because Jesus erased the inscription off the coin whist saying \"render to Caesar\" as he flashed them a blank smooth metal coin. Now that would be magic trick \"amazing\". Ooooh! Ahhhh!\n\nThere's also the story (Matthew 17:24-27) where Jesus told Peter to cast a hook without bait into the sea, catch a fish, take money out of its mouth and pay the temple tax. And that \"money\" would be nothing more than a piece of metal, shaped into a fish hook. A drachma was a silver coin, so it could have easily been used as a fishing lure. And thus Peter the Pirate, fisher of men, paid the tax with his silver hook for answering the tax collectors incorrectly.\n\nSo start \"paying taxes\" in the biblical Jesus way by erasing government graffiti inscriptions on the things god created.\n\n[Maximus!

{"body": "Well, first consider a full scale instead of a pentatonic. In fact, I'll give it to you by intervals.\n\nA major scale follows these intervals between scale degrees: *whole whole Half, whole whole whole Half*.\n\nThese are whole and half steps, by the way. A whole step is a distance of two frets, and a half step is a distance of one fret.\n\nSo, if you were to look at a piano keyboard and start on C, you can see that C major uses all the white keys and none of the black ones (how racist!).\n\nNOW....how does minor work? Well, if you start at the sixth scale degree of a major scale, it spells a minor key. But anyways... a minor scale follows these intervals:\n\n*whole Half whole, whole Half whole whole*\n\nAnd if you start from the third in the minor scale and proceed from there, it spells out a major scale.\n\n*SO WHAT ARE MODES?*\n\nYou got a taste of 'em up above. Take a major scale. Standard issue major. That would be Ionian. If you label the scale degrees in solfege, they are **Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do.**\n\nBasically, you get into modes when you play the same notes but you go from Re to Re, Mi to Mi, and so on. In order, they are:\n\n**I**onian, **D**orian, **P**hrygian, **L**ydian, **M**ixolydian, **A**eolian, **L**ocrian\n\nI remember it like so: I Don't Particularly Like Mahler And Liszt\n\n*WHERE DO YOU USE THESE FANCY SCHMANCY MODES?*\n\nWell.....that's up to you. It's easier to explain if you know about triads. Triads are basically chords made up of the tonic, third, and fifth. So a complete C major triad will have C, E, and G altogether. They can be in whatever order as long as those particular notes and JUST those notes are contained. Oh, and if the lowest note is something other than the tonic, then it's considered inverted. But I digress.\n\nOKAY....so that's what triads are. In a major scale, if you were to build triads from each scale degree, they would make the following chord qualities: **Major, minor, minor, Major, Major, minor, diminished**. \n\nBasically, if the intervals between notes are a major third (4 half-steps) then a minor third (3 half-steps), it's major. If they're reversed (3 then 4), then it's minor. For example, C and E are a major third apart and E and G are a minor third apart. Therefore, a C chord with C, E, and G will be C major. But if you flat that E, it'll invert the intervals and become C minor. *This is why the third is so important!*\n\nAre you still lost on these triads based on scale degrees? Well, the key of C major has these notes: C D E F G A B C. And you make chords by including every other scale degree (tonic, third, and fifth: 1 3 5). So if D is the tonic (or 1), then the third will be F (the 3) and the fifth will be A (the 5).\n\nNow where was I...? Ah yes! So at the very least, you should know where the major and minor chords are in a key, right? In a major scale, the major chords are just the  I  IV  V   chords, and the rest are either minor or diminished. Oh yeah, diminished is when the two intervals between notes are both minor thirds (3 half-steps and 3 half-steps).\n\n*PEANUT BUTTER:* Okay, I said that as a place marker. Do you have all of that so far?\n\nNow.....NOW!!.......what makes a mode and where should it be used?\n\nAHHHHhhhh......the burning question.  Okay, so if we look at a major scale in terms of a mode, we forgo the \"major\" and \"minor\" qualities between modes. Ionian, Dorian, and so on, remember?\n\nRemember when I said in a major key, the chords that are major are the  I  IV  V  chords? Thus, the modes that correspond to those chords/scale degrees (the Ionian, Lydian, and Mixolydian) have a sort of \"major-ish\" quality to them. The modes that follow the  ii  iii  vi  chords/scale degrees have a \"minor-ish\" quality, and the viio (or Locrian) has a weird \"diminished-y\" sound to it. That one is kinda hard to use well, actually.\n\nOkay, that's mostly it, but I'll add a few extra points.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n- You tend to encounter modes in Jazz more than anything. Jazz is characterized by a swing feel in rhythm, funky chords with added sevenths, ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths (like a C major chord with an F thrown in there to make it funky), and modes.\n\n- Because Jazz involves those really dense chords with extra notes added, it becomes more interesting to play modes over them. It's sort of like moving the scale over to accommodate the extra notes in the chords played by the rhythm section.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nI know that's a lot, but I hope it answers a few questions!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356072477", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A few things I suggest.  \n1. if you are point and clicking your mouse on each ability instead of hotkeying your abilities you are probably losing a lot of DPS (damage per second).  Use Q E R F X C, capslock, mouse buttons, scroll wheel up and down, and shift Q, shift E, shift versions of keys for less used abilites. Shift space bar is one I that i found ez to finger but not commonly used.  Some people will say \"clicking\" is fine, and it is... if you dont mind being subpar.  Hotkeys make the game much more immersive imo also.\n\n2. Dont compare yourself to other players who are wearing Heirloom gear.  Also dont compare your damage to tank damage.  Tanks are OP for leveling and do lots of AOE dmg.  Every tank class I level I am doing usually 40-60% of the damage of the whole group.\n\n3. Get info on your classes, get info on the spec you choose.  Possibly change your spec if one spec if one spec is doing more damage at this current point in the game.  It may take you 10 minutes or even a an hour of reading but spend some time finding out about what is a proper rotation for your class.  Also what is the proper AOE rotation.  At lower levels things are gonna be a bit simpler.  Because I like to play every class I often use website to help me when I want to try a new spec or class.  Check out: http://www.noxxic.com/wow  and http://www.icy-veins.com/   Find your class and spec there and see what they say about rotation or talents.  See what they say about proper max DPS rotation.  Look at what abilities you have at this current level and figure out what your level version of the rotations they suggest.\n\n4.  When you want to go a little deeper, look into macros for your class.  There are many abilites that can be macrod together, to make the game  ezer to play, to boost dps, to save space on your hotbars, to just improve the quality of the game.  The game has changed a lot as far as macros go over the years and they seemed to make it harder to macro abilities together now, they want people to press more buttons not less.  But, there are still plenty of options for macros that do work and do help your dps, or just make the game a lot ezer.  Some people frown upon macros, but they can suck an egg imo. If I can hit one button to put hunters mark on an enemy, make my pet attack it, and then shoot arcane shot... I consider that pretty much essential to enjoying the game.   You can learn how to create macros and you can read which macros other are using and copy them and try them in game.\n\nDont worry too much about your DPS, but enjoy the game.  Ignore people who are rude to you.  I been playin this game on and off since it was released - I think I have some say in the matter.  Spend a little time of a lot of time learning about your class, its not important.  Just enjoy yourself and PLEASE dont take things to heart.  The gaming community can be kinda \"harsh\" or rude/obnoxious at times, but you need to have thick skin and understand its often times not personal just the way some people (often times kids) choose to treate each other.

XIII cloaks. The one speaking is Xemnas and the one we can't hear is Roxas, and this is something they should have thought all the way through.\n\nWhen Xemnas says \"I've been to see him\" he's talking about Sora. Where did he see him you ask? In Hollow Bastion of course!\n\nWhat's that? You say you never saw him in Hollow Bastion? Well the reason for that is, he's a secret boss in the Final Mix edition of KH1. Which is **Japan Only**. \n\nOops.\n\nMoving on, Roxas wakes up in his bedroom in Twilight Town. The entire thing we just saw being his dream. He goes to meet his friends Hayner, Pence, and Olette at their usual spot under the train tracks. Apparently, their group has been blamed for everyone's stuff going missing. After some shenanigans, they find that all of their ______ are gone. After they find the real culprit, everything is returned. Including their photos. Also, more Final Fantasy characters make their appearance here. [woohoo.](http://i.imgur.com/YyJGX.gif)\n\n\nI'm just gonna fast forward through the rest of the prologue because it's few hours long.\n\nDuring a Struggle Tournament, Axel invades the virtual Twilight Town that Roxas was put into by DiZ at the end of 358/2 Days. DiZ manages to repel Axel and the Organization and Roxas wins the Struggle tournament while questioning his sanity. \n\nCharacter Development!\n\nOn the last day, Roxas heads to the usual spot as always only to find out his friends are now GHOSTS. Just kidding, they only walk through him and act as if he isn't even in the room with them. Soon nobodies appear and Roxas heads towards the old mansion on the other side of town. Inside the mansion he finds a lab with Sora in it. He recombines with Sora and the Hero Trio is back in action. They awake in the real Twilight Town and meet up with King Mickey (Mouse) after dispatching some Nobodies. He tells them to go to see Yen Sid (Disney spelled backwards) and sends them on their way.\n\nThey go see Yen Sid as well as get rid of the heartless that were summoned by Pete (That one guy whose a dick to everyone). Sora gets new clothes, and the Gummi Ship back. Also Maleficent is still alive. The Organization is fucking shit up in the worlds and the Hero Trio has to undo the stuff they did.\n\n**ADVENTURE START**\n\nThey go to Hollow Bastion first and meet up with the gang from Traverse Town (That town from the first game). After some shenanigans in which they meet the remaining members of the organization, they head off to the next world. \n\nAfter the first two worlds they are called back to Hollow Bastion by Merlin (Level 30 Mage), who shows them the book containing the world of the 100 Acre Wood from the first game. Which I skipped over because it's not important, which this is as well. \n\nAfter that, they head out to more worlds. Disney Castle is invaded by Maleficent and is promptly stopped.\n\n**MEANWHILE WITH SORA'S LOVE INTEREST** \n\nKairi is approached by Axel. She escapes into a portal that conveniently opened up to her right. She then ends up in the real Twilight Town in the Usual Spot of Hayner, Pence and Olette. \n\n**BACK WITH SORA**\n\nCHRISTMAS IS SAVED!\n\n**BACK IN TWILIGHT TOWN**\n\nAxel kidnaps Kairi.\n\n**BACK WITH SORA**\n\n\"Hey, Twilight Town is back on the map!\"\n\n**THEY GO TO TWILIGHT TOWN**\n\n\"What? Kairi's been kidnapped?!\"\n\n**THEY GO TO HOLLOW BASTION**\n\nWhile the Hero Trio has been away, Leon and the gang found a computer that was used by Ansem. Sora, being the computer illiterate protagonist that he is, gets himself, Donald, and Goofy sucked into the virtual world.\n\n**TRON MOTHERFUCKAS**\n\nThey do their usual thing and find Ansem's files. Also King Mickey. They find out that the Ansem they fought wasn't actually Ansem and that Blonde Professor Man is the real Ansem. Meaning that the one they fought was actually a heartless of some other dude who stole Ansem's name.\n\nlol Sephiroth\n\n**INSERT ~~FREE LEVEL UPS~~ BATTLE OF 1000 HEARTLESS HERE**\n\nIt is revealed that Xemnas and Ansem(Seeker of Darkness) are actually the Heartless and Nobody of... XEHANORT! \n\n**[[DRAMATIC SOUND EFFECT]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbusENG6hCE)**\n\nWHO IS ACTUALLY TERRA POSSESSED BY XEHANORT\n\n**[[DRAMATIC SOUND EFFECT]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDxSnQqAYeY)**\n\nAfter fighting off the Organization, all the worlds that you just went to are plunged back into darkness.\n\nPadding!\n\nAfter all of the worlds are back to normal, they head to REAL Twilight Town and go through a back door in the VIRTUAL Twilight Town that leads to the Organizations world. Axel dies after sacrificing himself so the Hero Trio can get past the nobodies blocking their path.\n\nThey scale the castle and along the way, they meet up with Riku (Ansem SoD form) and Kairi. Diz (Bandage Man) turns out to actually be Ansem the Wise (Blonde Professor Man) who then tries to BLOW UP KINGDOM HEARTS WITH A \"LASER\". It explodes, but in doing so, ruins the Organizations plans. Also Riku gets turned back to normal. They then prepare for the final battle against...\n\n~~MANSEX~~ XEMNAS.\n\nThey kick his ass, everyone is happy. \n\nAs everybody is heading home, Sora and Riku are stopped by Xemnas who refuses to give up. They best him yet again and find themselves in the Realm of Darkness.

WHAT!? HOW?! you say? i mean the depth of detail, like many different radio stations in the game you can jam to. GTA soundtracks are award winning, and the simlish songs in sims3 are actually quite good despite being lyrical gibberish (literally, \"podie tie\" is catchy as all fuck, despite not having any real lyrics)\n\nwhy then? all the hate? oh, how about the 984576945876 expansion packs at $30 each? ok, its not that many, but there literally ARE like ~~half a dozen or more~~ FIFTEEN, I COUNTED...and while not everyone may want the katy perry xpansion pack (its really a thing) and people can pick and choose whether they want the pets or the late night stuff, as gamers wouldnt we all just rather have \"all the shit\"? \n\nthis is where the evilness of EA comes in. the programers made a kickass game, the object designers make all kind of cool shit. but EA comes along and nickle and dimes you as much as they can for it. \n\nthe base game is the gateway drug people. \n\nyou can also buy furniture sets right off the EA site. and the shit aint cheap. like $20 for a living and bedroom set! it may be legal in a courtroom, but i think its morally criminal. I'd rather take the $20 and go to ~~walmart~~ Target and buy a real lamp for my real apartment.\n\nthe sims is one of EAs major cash cows. it is money from these sales that EA uses to buy up really good studios, cancel their projects which set a bar higher than EA would like to see on the market, reassign the devs to different projects, stripping them of their passions to make games they want, and then spitting out remains of what was once a promising and innovative studio that would be set to offer GOOD HONEST VALUE for great new games. \n\nif EA were offering a sims3 bundle, with say the current sale for the base game, and included ALL the xpacs for say $3-$5 each, i might have to contend it was a good deal. note that the xpacs ARE also on sale right now, but they are still about $10 EACH on average. thats $150 worth of xpacs which is the current slash sale price. ($400 retail!!!! for all the xpacs??? what the f u c k ! ! !)\n\nEA really really really wants people to just buy sims3 now, and then jack up the price of each xpac to the regular $20 to $40 later and hope people get addicted and buy them later.

{"body": "They don't have to be at all, it's just the simplest and most effective way of working in western harmony. Ragas in Indian classical music are the same idea, a group of notes so that everyone plays stuff that works together - they just use different tones than C, D, E etc.\n\nLoads of songs interchange between scales throughout their structure - try and find what notes are used in Queen's [We Are The Champions'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY) different sections and you'll see they don't all fit into one scale. You'll also notice that quite often in songs like that, modes and scales with the same root note will be used. For example, if a song's in C major, using notes and chords from C minor will add more interesting colours to that song's pallet - C minor is C major's parallel minor. \n\nSomething similar can be done by changing between minors. To explain this, I'll use A minor, because it has the least accidentals.\n\n* **A natural minor**, or *A Aeolian*, consists of A B C D E F G and is a mode of *C Major* or *C Ionian* - when most people refer to minor they mean this scale.\n\n* **A harmonic minor** consists of A B C D E F G#. Notice the seventh degree has been sharpened - this note is the 3rd of E dominant 7, and that chord resolves nicely to an A chord, be it minor or major. This resolution is harmonically stronger than A natural minor's E minor 7, which has the G as its 3rd - hence *harmonic* minor - so people will often dip into this for a chord or two in a natural minor song to return to A minor in a more satisfying way.\n\n* **A melodic minor** consists of A B C D E F# G#. Here both the sixth and seventh degrees have been sharpened. If you compare this to A major, the only difference is that this has a C where the major has C#, meaning melodic minor has more of that melodic sing-songy-ness to it, which is why many jazz soloists use it over minor chords in jazz. The important thing is that, because its third degree is a minor third, it's still distinctly a minor scale, which keeps the mood that minor brings intact. It also has all those useful modes I was talking about earlier like lydian dominant and superlocrian, which are great ways of getting out of being boring in solos or quirky in melodies, especially on dominant chords. \n\nAnyway, this is a huge and interesting subject and I could edit this post forever, but in short, people base songs on scales because they give you so much to work with. It can also be used to create familiaritly - for example, many great blues players base a huge amount of their solos on pentatonics and the blues scale (which is minor pentatonic + flat 5) but explore them well - play that to any music fan, theory-educated or not, and they'll probably think it sounds bluesy (unless the player is doing something else to change up the game a bit)\n\nIt sounds like you see scales as a restriction, when in reality they're a tool - all music theory can be used as just a tool. Things like counterpoint rules and such are really strict but they're very strict styles. You have total freedom, but scales are incredibly useful and fun to use. \n\nI definitely only have to use this account for talking about superlocrian.\n\nEDIT: added a lot more about parallel minors and stuff like that - actually, added a shiteload", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356303085", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Now when you have the high ap from your abilities and an ult that is INCREDIBLY useful for getting around whats the BEST possible stat you can get.

{"body": "I won't write a super long comment, you've already gotten great advice.\n\nThe first thing I'd like to say is that as far as the theory behind chords, you need to learn the stuff leading up to it first. To me this is essential... if you want to MASTER an aspect of music, you have to understand it. You can't just practice and memorize it. So the things that lead up to chords, in order:\n\n1. Steps (half steps and whole steps)\n2. Scales (you can safely start with just major scales, but minor is recommended as well)\n3. Intervals (look at OnaZ's comment. Intervals depend on the scale you're working with so you have to learn them after scales)\n4. Chords (finally!)\n\nThese topics build off of each other in that order. Scales are a succession of halfsteps and whole steps. Intervals are distances between keys in a scale (and outside of it too with modification). And chords are a selection of degrees (notes) of a scale, which we refer to using intervals.\n\nNow, this is all stuff that can get REALLY confusing and complicated. I'm guessing you don't have a private instructor? It's always a HUGE help to have a private teacher or at LEAST take a class. So that's my recommendation, find someone to teach you.\n\nOnaZ's comment is great, but just for the sake of being thorough I'd like to offer a more basic description of chords which you may like.\n\nWhen I first introduce the topic of chords to my students, I describe them by saying that a chord is just a selection or group of notes which work well together. Ignoring all of the theory behind them, that's what they are! C, E, and G sound REALLY good together. Actually they don't even have to sound GOOD, they just have to sound... period. Chords can sound ugly too. We name these chords and suddenly we can refer to a collection of notes with a singular name! The chord I just said, C/E/G, is called the C major chord. Now, anyone in the world can say \"C major!\" and anyone who knows chords can play EXACTLY what they're thinking!\n\nOne cool thing about these collections of notes, is that it doesn't actually matter what order they're played in on the piano. Think of a chord as literally those three letters: C E G. That's all. It's not an instruction on HOW MANY of each letter you use, or where you place them! You could play it with E on the bottom and go E G C **or** E C G. You could put the G on the bottom as well. You could use multiples of a letter and go C E G C **or** C C E G **or** C E G E. Anything you can imagine as long as you use those keys, and ONLY those keys. If you try these on the piano, you'll see that these different **voicings** of the C major chord sound like different flavors of the same thing. They're ALL the C major chord, and will always be as long as you don't remove a letter or add one or modify one with sharps or flats.\n\nI say this to you not because you'll suddenly magically be super flexible with chords, but because I think it really helps mentally. It REALLY helps if you ever look at sheet music and try identifying the chord. Essentially all you have to do is identify EVERY unique key being played at the moment, ignoring duplicates, and then whichever chord matches that selection of keys is your chord (please note that some chords are similar or even identical which can make this SLIGHTLY weird. It's not a 100% rule)!\n\nThis is getting longer than I was expecting hahaha sorry! But I'd like to offer a strategy. Start by practicing basic major and minor triads. Just in case you don't know what that is, that's chords which are just the 1st, 3rd, and 5th degrees of the major and minor scales, respectively. So if you want C major you need the 1st 3rd and 5th keys in the C major scale which is C E G of course. To make it C MINOR, we need C Eb G. When I say practice these, what I really mean is improvise. Have you tried improvising before? You can use it to GREAT educational advantage just so long as you're comfortable with at least the C major scale, and the basic triad chords.\n\nTo practice, just start improvising in the key of C. If you know some basic chord progressions that you can make sound good, go for it. Otherwise, pretty much the most basic one goes C, Am, F, G. So those are the chords you'll play in the left hand. Play them in their root position for one measure each, and improvise a melody on top. Do this until you're comfortable with them. The FUN part comes when you're good with that... then you get to start rearranging the chords! Instead of playing them all in their root position, arrange them so that your hand doesn't have to jump around! If you already know the arrangements to use, great! Otherwise... you'll have to figure it out. Remember... use the SAME EXACT LETTERS, just put them in a different order. Basic rule: each finger should move to the NEAREST key that's in the new chord. Handily, sometimes fingers can stay exactly where they are.\n\nDoing the above will allow you to get comfortable with triads in their root positions, AND start pushing yourself to identify them when they're NOT in their root position. Now of course there's a MILLION different voicings for any particular chord. Just as an example, a common thing for me is playing C G C (if it's C major). This is an octave (C) with G in the middle. The E is left out. What I'll often do is play this as a broken chord and work my way up to the E, or the E will appear in the right hand. It's SLIGHTLY complicated but easy to understand once you see it. Anyway, it's just an example of a voicing of a chord. I like the openness of it.\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the above, I would start throwing in suspensions. I LOVE suspended chords. sus2 and sus4 are just SUCH beautiful sounds, especially considering how simple they are. Quick review, a suspended chord just means you're SUSPENDING (not playing) the 3rd degree (so in C major, don't play the E) and replacing it with the 2nd (D) or 4th (F) degree. Start throwing these into your improvisation! You can't do it with just any old chord in your progression without messing with things too much, but you can do it with the tonic at least so start changing all your C chords into Csus2 or Csus4. Now if the right hand is ever tempted to play an E, make sure it plays the correct suspension instead! this isn't always necessary, but it's good practice for your brain, identifying that you're playing a Csus2 or Csus4 which means you have a different collection of keys to work with. By the way, in the chord progression I gave you (C, Am, F, G) you could play the G as a suspension as well and it'll sound good. Same rule so Gsus2 is G A D and Gsus4 is G C D.\n\nOnce you're happy with suspensions, you can start rearranging them! Yay! New voicings! Do whatever you feel like, start experimenting! Fun note! Gsus4 and Csus2 use the same exact three keys! Gsus4 is G C D and Csus2 is C D G. The only difference is the order you play them in but because we can rearrange chords however we'd like, it doesn't even matter essentially! Anyway, mess around and just have fun!\n\n7ths are great to work with because they sound jazzy so they really help you get an authentic jazzy sound even if you don't know what you're doing so that's cool. They also kinda represent a LOT of chord/interval/scale theory, considering that they're just one type of chord. Well I mean there's three common types of 7ths but whatever.\n\nIn case you haven't heard it laid out, the three 7th chords are as follows (with examples in the key of C):\n\n1. Cmaj7: just follows the major scale. C E G (the C major triad), and then add the 7th note of the C major scale which is B. So your full Cmaj7 chord is C E G B, represented in its root position. Major triad, major 7th.\n\n2. Cm7: just follows the MINOR scale (C natural minor scale is C D Eb F G Ab Bb). So we have C Eb G for our triad, and then the 7th degree of the minor scale is not B, but Bb. In root position the chord is C Eb G Bb. Minor triad, minor 7th.\n\n3. C7 (C dominant 7th): this is sort of a hybrid of the two. It's just a major triad and minor 7th. So the triad is C E G, but the 7th added on top is the MINOR 7th so the full chord is C E G Bb. Major triad, minor 7th.\n\n(Contd. in next comment)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356538361", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Overall, there wasn't much in your comment to disagree with.  A few things I would add/amend:\n\n* Better to think about a Cmin7 chord coming from the Dorian mode rather than a C natural minor scale.  The Ab (from the natural minor scale) will sound like a wrong note if you play it over a Cmin7 chord.  \n\n* You can't just willy-nilly throw a seventh on top of your major or minor triad and keep improvising with the same notes.  You're going to imply a scale by adding that seventh that will make some notes sound \"wrong\" if you don't use the correct scale.\n\n* 11ths don't see as much use as 9ths because you have to pay attention to the chord quality.  You wouldn't add an F natural to a Cmaj7 chord because it's outside of the scale.  You could add a #11 and imply the Lydian mode.  Same goes for a C7 dominant chord.  For a Cmin11, you could use the natural 11th and add an F and this gives a minor chord a lot more color.\n\n* You would never see a chord written as \"Csus2maj7\" unless you were dealing with an inexperienced composer.  You would see it written as Cmaj9 which implies C E G B D.  \"Sus2\" is a thing you see in pop/rock music where you have chords that don't contain the seventh, and you wouldn't suspend the 3rd.  That's a special case where you see a sus4 or sus11 chord.  Sus2 to pop/rock people just means play a triad and the 9th with no 7th, it doesn't do anything to the 3rd.\n\nedit: wrong 7th for Cmaj9\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356555525", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

A Easy Way to rember this is \"Eat At Dennys Get Bad/Beautiful Eggs\" (depending on how much you like Dennys). Notice the thickest string is the capital E this will help orient what each strings name is. \n\nThe next step is buying a electronic tuner guitar [tuner](http://www.get-tuned.com/images/guitar-tuner3.jpg) most of these will work for electric or a acoustic guitars. For Electric plug you cord into your guitar and then into the similar hole in the tuner. If you have a acoustic don't worry! Hold your guitar like you normally would while sitting. Then place the tuner on your [leg](http://content5.videojug.com/4f/4f99a356-ab0e-627a-27a9-ff0008cd2794/how-to-tune-an-acoustic-guitar-2.WidePlayer.jpg). Imagine the tuner is on the leg closet to the body of the guitar. \n\nThe next part is a bit tricky. Make sure your stings have tension so the have a nice long ring to them. If they arnt taught enough they sound floppy. You will know when you hear it. Adjust the tension with the [tuning pegs](http://www.guitar-beginner.com/images/tuning-headstock-nut.jpg) when you have the tuner on you will see the needle move around a bit. It will also display a letter. You want the letter to match the string name. E for e a for a and so on. \n\nWhen you first start the tuning make sure the strings are a bit floppy. Then tighten them as you pluck one string. So for the thickest string (e) start with it a bit floppy. Then tighten it. You will see the tuner needle go from left to right. Keep tightening until you get to e. Now it'd time to fine tune it. Tighten it until the needle is standing up right in the middle. Usually there is a green light that will light up. If you go past the middle loosen the string just a tad. When you finally get it in the green pluck that string again to make sure. Now repeat getting the tuner to display the matching string name. Un till you have tuned your guitar. \n\nP. S its late so if anything doesn't make sense or if you get stuck feel free to ask. Hope I helped. And have fun. The first few times tuning take a little while don't give up. After you learn how to do this. You can learn to tune the guitar to its self \n.

Basically, the way we learn and understand concepts is by scaffolding them onto other concepts and develop associations between them.  It's the underlying the principle of implicit attitudinal tests; I show you an something aversive and then a positive target picture (in this example) and ask you to classify it as either good or bad, it'll take you longer to say it's good, than if I showed you something not-aversive.  \n\nHowever, while priming/associative memory is definitely the underlying mechanism, I think to better understand this phenomenon, you need to understand Recall vs. Recognition memory.  Importantly, they are arguably distinct memory systems (certain patients are unable to recall things, but are fully able to recognize them).\n\nRecognition memory is basically that feeling you get when you've seen something or heard something before but can't place it.

(bring a backpack if you're a shopper).\n\nHave fun mate! So excited for you :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356645645", "subreddit": "Gunners", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry but you are very wrong about a couple of things. \n\nJax and Yi are capable of very high damage, but their abilities are what makes them such strong fighters. Yi has extremely fast attack and has the ability to chase and/or finish fights. His abilities reset after every kill he gets, so even after he's done with his cool downs, he is still lethal. Jax has the ability to engage, and stun multiple people. In addition, once he hits level 6, every third strike does bonus damage, in addition to his W which also adds damage. If played properly, both can do amazing damage, and cause huge issues in team fights. \n\nYou are wrong on the combo for Ryze as well. The proper order is R Q E W Q and anything possible after that is a bonus. \n\nR of course activates the ultimate, doing more damage and giving spell vamp. Q is the basic damage dealing ball of doom, it has an ability that resets cool downs after each spell cast thereafter, so actually your R can help with cool down if you want to play it by cool downs, that'll do. E snares, holds them in place. Q does damage again and it will surely be reset at this point. This is the dream form of damage, but its likely you won't get everything off if you do this combo. \n\nEzreal does not \"always\" build tri force, it's very expensive and its abilities are \"good\" but not amazing. The reason for it is that sheen makes your attacks do bonus damage after using abilities. In addition it adds to your ability damage overall. Your Q and E are also helped by AD bonuses (possibly your R as well). Ez is a high skill champ, he is hard to play and I do not encourage him as your first champ. Ashe and Varus are nothing like Ezreal, they are much more passive and both have ultimates that stop the enemy in their tracks. Sivirs spell shield is not OP, it is a defensive ability where others might have an attack ability, its balanced.

{"body": "I put off learning the scale patterns for many years, as I thought it would just be a load of memorization. A few years ago, I decided to take lessons again, and my teacher showed me a method for learning the patterns a little easier. The first thing you have to know is that all scales are relative to each other. For example, the notes in F Major are\n\nF G A Bb C D E\n\nThe notes in G Dorian:\n\nG A Bb C D E F\n\nA Phrygian:\n\nA Bb C D E F G\n\nThe notes are all the same, the starting point (tonal center) is different. The order of the scales in relation is Major (Ionian), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Minor (Aeolian), Locrian. \n\nTo learn the patterns on the fretboard, I started with F Major. One thing nice about this is that is mostly \"natural\" notes (no sharp or flats), except for the Bb. This is good because it's easier for me to recognize the natural notes on the fretboard. I use 3 notes per string, so the F Major pattern is this\n\n\n    ------------------------------------------3--5--6\n    ----------------------------------3--5--6--------\n    --------------------------2--3--5----------------\n    ------------------2--3--5------------------------\n    ---------1--3--5---------------------------------\n    1--3--5------------------------------------------\n\nRemember all scales are relative, and the next scale in order is the Dorian. So to find the G Dorian pattern, you simply shift up one note. So basically when you are trying to find 3 notes per string, you already know the first two, just find the third one. The fact that this particular scale is always natural notes except for Bb should help you find the third note if you have some knowledge of your fretboard. G Dorian:\n\n    ------------------------------------------5--6--8\n    ----------------------------------5--6--8--------\n    --------------------------3--5--7----------------\n    ------------------3--5--7------------------------\n    ---------3--5--7---------------------------------\n    3--5--6------------------------------------------\n\nOn the E string, you see that the first two notes are the same as the last two notes of the Major scale. You can tell that's G and A, and that the next note is Bb, which is the 6th fret. You just do the same for each string.\n\nWhen you want to find the pattern for the next scale, which is Phrygian, you perfom the same steps. The last two notes of the last scale are the first two notes of the new scale, and you are left to find the third note.\n\nOnce I had a rough idea of the patterns, I would set the metronome and go up the Major scale and come down the Dorian, then up the Dorian and down the Phrygian, all the way through all seven scales. Once you learn these patterns all starting on the E string, it's also easy to relate them to scales that start on the other strings. \n\nI don't know if I explained that well enough or if it helps anyone, but it helped me get over the daunting task and it all seems so easy now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356711752", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Go with Withywindle, if you want a reddit-themed kin.  The Gladden kin is d e a d (I just left it).  Or, just go with whatever server is on top of the list right now, so you start with a lot of other newbies, and find a kin.\n\nYou will have trouble finding groups for early and mid game dungeons unless you find a big (or nice) kin, because most of the population is at level cap.  Starting on the current recommended server will also help alleviate this.  Endgame depends on server pop and kin size, but is much better than early and mid game.\n\nEndgame is currently farming the first boss of Barad Guldur.  New 6 and 12-man instances are coming in February.\n\nYou should pay.  While LOTRO's F2P is one of the nicer implementations in the industry, it is still a giant pain and is gimping your character. \n\nBest plan:\n\n1. Download and install the game.\n2. Play til level 20-30, for free\n3. Decide if you want to continue playing.  If no, uninstall.\n4. If yes, subscribe for 1-3 months to start with (aka VIP)\n5. Create a few alts and log in to them once, even if you don't plan to play them now\n6. Reach level 45-50.  This is where the expansions start.\n7. Buy Moria.  Reach level 60.  Decide whether to buy Mirkwood or not (Enedwaith, which is included in VIP, covers the same level range).  Reach 65.  Buy Isengard.  Reach 75.  Buy Rohan.  \n8. Reach 85. Endgame.  Note: once above level 50 (on all alts?), VIP becomes less attractive.\n\nAlso note:  all expansions are currently half off.  The Triple Pack (Moria, Mirkwood, Isengard) is currently $20. The base Rohan is currently $20.  So if you want to hit cap, VIP ($15 for one month) + $20 + $20 = $55 for all content right now (VIP content access is temporary, see [here](http://forums.lotro.com/showthread.php?377885-What-happens-if...-answers-about-the-account-types&amp;highlight=) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Am5zlH5jy9iGdEpSUk9GQTlnZ3hTNzZuZ3RTSWEyQ1E&amp;output=html)).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356711873", "subreddit": "lotro", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

work, you would have to consider the fact that the alphabet starts counting at 1 instead of 0, and so you would accordingly add 1 to the digit *instead* of just using alphabetic equivalence.

I'm starting to think that insomnia isn't really conducive to codebreaking. Screwed up the Octal table... at least I knew it. Fixed now.\n\nEDIT2: The baseline shifts look REALLY promising. The fourth column resolves almost perfectly with a baseline of 48. Off to get a larger sample. This could be something so simple as an ASCII shift (the digital equivalent of a substitution cipher).\n\nEDIT3: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the sidebar analysis. I am now going to go perform those same operations on the primary dataset, and I gotta warn you that this may be a hot minute (as if this hasn't been a slow *enough* process). \n\nHowever, we DID actually learn something from this exercise, and here's what:\n\n1. These are actually groups of FOUR, not EIGHT.\n2. They are organized into both columns AND rows.\n3. Column four is DECIMAL. It uses an ASCII-wrap around based on distance from a baseline of 48.\n\nOff to get the larger dataset now. Hopefully it follows the same structure as the sidebar. Sorry for your patience here... decryption isn't NEARLY as sexy a process as it looks like on TV. Remember, I have NO IDEA what this data represents and therefore have no way to verify ANYTHING I'm trying out. \n\nThis is like target shooting in the dark...

{"body": "God damn that is an interesting question. First off, the bass does not need to follow the root of a chord. Not doing so can lead to interesting runs. For instance, if you're in C, then Dm C F G C may not sound interesting. But make the bass of that first C into E, then suddently the bass does a walk from D to G, making some interesting tension. By the way, to notate that you would write C/E, read as (C over E). The bass doesn't even have to be in the chord. F/G is an interesting chord (in C) and putting a A in the bass of a C chord makes it a kind of interesting Am7.\n\nThe melody doesn't have to start in the chord as well, but rather make it \"centered around the chord\" where you can tell what chord it's in, but there are other neighboring tones as well.\n\nI might have made it even more confusing.

{"body": "Yeah.  A few activities:\n\n- First, just hold the Violin in shoulder position.  Practice moving each finger independently while the others are on the fingerboard WITHOUT the bow.  So, have 1/2/3/4 down but only move 1.  Then have 1/2/3/4 down and only move 2.  Be mindful to only lift the finger as little as possible to get it off the string.  Your other fingers will be tempted to join in the process (that's why you're keeping them down).  This is natural, you're trying to be mindful of it, not prevent it.  Practice this in as many combinations as you can think of (leave 1 down but move 2, 3, and 4, or leave 2 and 4 down but move 1 and 3.)  Some combinations will be more challenging than others and this will vary person-to-person.\n\n- Next, take the D Major Scale.  We're going to block the scale into 8 sections: E/D, F#/E, G/F#, A/G, B/A, C#/B, D/C# (hopefully you see what I did here).  Play each section 4 times (D E D E D E D E, then the next pattern).  The first time you play the E, lift the finger off as far as possible.  Each time you lift it off, lift less.  By the time you play the final E it should be lifting as little as required to get off the string.  Do this all the way up and then down the scale.  Once this is under control, play each section 3 times, same deal.  Start with a huge lift, by the 3rd one, as little motion as possible.  Once you're down to 1, lift each finger only as much as required.  If you're getting the hang of this, then spend about 3 minutes going up and down the scale, practicing it.  Your mind should be focusing on how it feels.  Do this as a warm-up every day.\n\n- Next, go to a song that's excruciatingly easy for you.  Play it through twice.  First time, lift fingers a lot, second time, lift them almost not at all.  Even though the piece is excruciatingly easy, if you can't play it without lifting your fingers less than a millimeter you haven't mastered the skill and are not ready to go on.\n\n\nThe important thing is to not try and focus on the finger lifting on something that's challenging you in other ways.  First, master having very little lift in the fingers.  This may take a month or more.

{"body": "Well, from a theory perspective, the circle of fifths is only a partial way to explain how chords relate to one another and why some chords sound better going to some chords rather than other chords. For example, in the most general sense, one of the strongest cadences in western tonal music is a chord progression of ii-V-I. Examining this further if we were in lead sheet symbols for example in C major would be Dm - G - C. Also, other than the bass line, the upper voices in a circle of fifths progression can change to the next chord without it sounding abrupt. Especially in a chord progression where its mostly major-minor 7th chords down the circle of fifths, the upper voices only move down chromatically or by wholestep (omitting the fifth every other chord in a four part situation) for example G7 is G B D F then moving down the circle fifths is C7 which is CEGBb (omitting the third would be C C E Bb) then F7 which is F A C Eb. So in a lot of cases it is very pleasing to the ear. Especially in Jazz you will see long strings of 7th chords going down the circle of fifths.\n\nA ii - V - I progression isn't technically more complex than the pop example of a IV - V - I cadence you described. They are both authentic cadences as both ii and IV act as predominants.\n\nNot really sure if I answered your question or if I went into a tangent.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356821218", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

So I will answer that question too: Keys are basically a context for a certain musical piece. They are musical tools that give you an idea about which notes you should play and how you should phrase your melodies while playing that song. For example when someone says \"This song is in the key of A major.\", what s/he means is \"If you are playing this song, you can play A B C# D E F# G# notes, and you can resolve your musical sentences to an A major chord (A C# E notes).\". And the difference between major and minor keys is they have different sets of notes, so they imply different musical structures and convey different emotions(major keys sound generally happier than minor keys). \n\nI did not want to get too technical, but I can explain how you get those notes too, if that is what you are curious about.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356881019", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are 12 different notes between each octave in western music.  This is called the chromatic scale.  A key signature tells us which 7 out of those 12 notes we are allowed to play, the other 5 we ignore.  The simplest key signature is C major, or A minor.  The 7 notes that make up this \"key\" of either C major or A minor are the ones without flats or sharps, namely A B C D E F G.  Similarly the Key of B flat Major is the same as the key of G minor and has two flats.  B flat and E flat... the remaining five notes are natural.  There are 12 different **key signatures** in western music, one for each note of the chromatic scale.  Each of those 12 key signatures consists of 7 notes, and can be either major or minor.\n\nEvery set of 7 notes (the key signature) can be either major or minor, depending on something called the **Tonic**.  Think of this as the most important note, the one that gets played the most.  It's sort of like Home Base for the melody.  In A minor, (no flats or sharps in the key), the melody revolves around \"A\" as the tonic.  The 5th note in the scale is called the \"dominant\" (this is the second most important note in the scale), in this key it would be \"E\".  As the melody floats back and forth between the **dominant** and **tonic**, this gives us a sense of where Home Base (the tonic) is and that sets up the melody in our mind as being A minor.  Using the same set of 7 notes, except this time C is the Tonic, and G is the Dominant, the melody would be in C major.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - A key signature can be either major or minor, it depends on which notes you emphasize.  It depends on which notes you set as the tonic and dominant.\n\ne: Accidentally a word, added an extra sentence.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1356885184", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's important to know about the musical \"distance\" between notes. In scales, we usually use the terms \"whole step\" and \"half step\". A half step is the distance between a white key and an adjacent white key. A whole step is the distance between an white key and an adjacent white key - they have a black key between them, and two half steps add up to a whole step. The exception are the pairs of white keys (E and F, B and C) that *don't* have a black key between them - these are a half step apart. \n\nThe major scale sounds happy or at least neutral. Do you know \"do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do?\" That's what the major scale sounds like. This is partially learned but also due to how we hear sound. (Check [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_0DXxNeaQ0) out later to learn more.) Instead of talking about the 8 notes in the major scale, let's talk about the 7 intervals *between* those notes, using W for whole step and H for half step:\n\ndo- W -re- W -mi- H -fa- W -sol- W -la- W -ti- H -do\n\nW W H W W W H\n\nYou can play this major scale at a higher or lower pitch, but if the distance between the notes stays the same, it'll still sound like a major scale.\n\nA minor scale, on the other hand, can sound sad or angry or upsetting. It has these intervals:\n\nW H W W H W W \n\nSometimes, in order to hit the right intervals, you'll bump into some black notes. For example, if I start on F, my first three notes of the F major scale are F, G, A. I need a half step, so I don't go all the way to B - I go to B♭ (B-flat), the note between A and B. Likewise, sometimes I need the note *above* the white note, which are called sharps, and notated with ♯. A scale may use sharps or flats, but not both.\n\nWhen I talk about the key of a song, I mean that the song will mostly use the notes from that scale. A song in D-major will use the notes in the D major scale - D E F♯ G A B C♯ D. There are two sharps in the D-major scale, F and C, so when I play in the key of D-major, there are two sharps - I'm going to play my Fs and my Cs as F♯s and C♯s. Also, since we're in *D*-major, D is going to sound like my \"home base\". The melody and chords are going to \"want\" to go to D.\n\n**If you got bored and skipped ahead, continue reading here**\n\nSo what's the difference between, say, G major and G minor? Well, songs in those keys will \"want\" to return to G. However, they'll have different sounds, and use different notes:\n\nG major: G A B C D E F♯ G  \nG minor: G A B♭ C D E♭ F G\n\nWhat's the difference between G major and its *relative* minor? A relative key shares the same number of sharps/flats, and its scale is made up of the same notes.

Being told horror stories about being called witches, people with their hands tied behind their backs at school, things like that, all coalesced into a determination to make sure my handwriting was beautiful and didn't fit into some awful stereotype. I looked at attractive lettering and mimicked it as best I could, picked out the types of letters that I liked and that I thought I could repeat quickly and without thinking. I also wrote in journals often, even if it was mundane.\n\nMy advice is to focus. What do you want to change about your a's, or your y's? What do you like in a letter? Do you prefer serifs? Big trunks? Long ends? Don't be afraid to cover a page in \"a a a a a a a\", because repetition is the key. Sign your name over and over on a page like a bored 13 year old.

Just ignore them for now. Your entire focus should be on jad, and you should have your abilities in a layout where you do not have to think about using them. Put your prayers and food on your hotbar so IF you do screw up, you can fix it without taking your eyes off of jad.\n\n(my setup: A W A S A R A C A F A D...) It looks like complete nonsense, but i'm cycling back and forth from Wrack to various basics, then to thresholds. I know exactly what i am doing without paying attention, you want to be able to do that. You shouldn't need a single ultimate here, or defensive ability, but pop anticipation when it's up just for extra adrenaline and defense. Don't rely on resonance and other defensives to survive, it just adds extra distractions from prayer switching.\n\nNext up, you need to prayer switch; This is easier than ever with EoC as prayers activate the INSTANT you click the button rather than waiting for the next game tick. (use hotbar, bind them to keys you can click often). go on youtube and watch a video of a jad fight, as high detail as possible, and practice switching ingame with the fight you see in the video. All you are trying to do is to figure out his cues for each attack, so you don't worry about failed switches. NOTE: any video works, so long as it's latest graphical update. all you care about is watching jad's motions.\n\n\nOnce you feel confident about using abilities without worrying, and then prayer switching, the last issue you will have is dealing with the healers. They really aren't a big deal, make sure you're standing in an open area, and right when you switch a prayer, go and attack a healer, switch a prayer, attack a healer, and repeat four times and then attack jad again.\n\n\nThe hardest part of the fight is over thinking, so you want to train yourself to KNOW that you can do it.
