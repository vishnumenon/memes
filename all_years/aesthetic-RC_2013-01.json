{"body": "I assume you're talking about a circle progression. The circle of fifths only works in 12 tone equal temperament, and doesn't involve any kind of chords.\n\nThere are a few ways you can go about making a circle progression in a given mode or key. The easiest is to just use the notes in the key you're in. Let's say you're in A minor (we'll use melodic minor here), to make a circle progression you just figure out what interval pattern you'll be using. You can do that by counting out scale degrees if you're having trouble figuring out how to adjust your pattern to stay in the same octave. For A minor, you can do this:\n\nA B C D E F G\n\nthen simply start counting off, for example, fours. So let's start on A and count 4 up to D. Then four up from that is G, then to count for up from that we loop back to the beginning to land on C, then F, etc. So mixed up, our circle progression looks like this:\n\nA D G C F B E A\n\nNow to figure out what kinds of chords go on top of those, we just fill them in for the key. Since we're in A minor, that's no sharps or flats to worry about. Since I specified melodic minor, we'll just go ahead and modify E to be major, but not worry about making any other Gs or Fs sharped.\n\n    A C E - minor\n    D F A - minor\n    G B D - Major\n    C E G - Major\n    F A C - Major\n    B D F - diminished \n    E G# B - Major\n    A C E - minor\n\nTo answer your question about using any combination of 7 notes, let's try it with a non-standard key signature. Let's say F# and D# but no others. That gives us:\n\n    A C E - minor\n    D# F# A - diminished\n    G B D# - Augmented\n    C E G - Major\n    F# A C - diminished\n    B D# F# - Major\n    E G B - minor\n    A C E - minor\n\nHope that helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357005955", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Play the C major scale on your keyboard (all of the white keys, C D E F G A B C) starting on a C.  Now play all of the white keys again, but this time starting on the first A below the C you played your previous scale on (A B C D E F G A).

{"body": "Many early classical works are in strophic (verse/chorus/verse) form, ~~it's where pop music developed from~~. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVWhxoIkHtY) and [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM-odS73MvI) are two examples. The first is Greensleeves. The second is an old French love song called Dueil angoisseux. The text to both can be found [Here](http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/love-in-the-arts/renaissance.html). As you can see, Greensleeves has verses and choruses, while Dueil angoisseux has only verses. \n\nSomething that is similar to this form is Rondo form. The two major versions of this are 5-part and 7-part: A B A C A, or A B A C A B A. You can consider A sections choruses, then B and C sections become verses. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c57MY3uRSQ) is an example. (forgive me, I am a horn player haha). The repeated notes at the beginning are the A theme. You can hear quite clearly when they come back. \n\nI think that there are definitely examples of pop music in expo/dev/recap form (sonata form), you can actually consider a lot of jazz to be this way. The head is the exposition, then they develop the material in the solo section, and then play the head again for the recap. Likewise, you can think of jazz in strophic form, too. The solo section is simply a bunch of repeated verses, with the head being the chorus. \n\nIt is not impossible to write something in sonata form in under 3 minutes. The famous first movement of Mozart's [Piano Sonata No. 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r65goW_dzs0) is in Sonata form. However, as time went on composers expanded this form into much longer pieces. The first movement of Beethoven's (also very famous) [5th symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4IRMYuE1hI) can be as long as 8 minutes. (and don't even get me started on [Mahler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UskC4VILUeg) and [Bruckner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K1WbgJnDSk)!)\n\nI believe there are two main reasons that we don't see more pop music in sonata form (or at least influenced by sonata form). The first is simply that the people who write pop music either don't know what it is, or more likely that they don't think of sonata form as something that can be applied to pop music, due to the second reason. The second reason is the same reason Kenny G (as all the sax players cringe) keeps making soprano sax albums. He actually has a nice sound on tenor sax, but the record companies tell him to make soprano sax albums because that is what sells. When people listen to pop music, they want something with a beat, or something that is easy to follow along. Nothing is easier to follow along with than strophic form, as it is essentially 2 sections that are repeated, one having different words each time it appears. Since this is what people buy, it is what is made. \n\nHope this helps!\n\n**EDIT:** Strophic! I knew there was a word for verse/chorus/verse, but I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was.

{"body": "1: **Swans** - *The Seer*\n\nI was pretty disappointed after my first listen. I hadn't paid any attention to post-reformation Swans, really had no desire to, and was surprised to see this album getting attention after their last one hadn't garnered tremendous praise.  So I had low expectations because this was another comeback-after-over-a-decade release.  But then it started getting hyped and people were constantly saying things like \"this album is bullshit it is just a bunch of repetitive noise.\"  Naturally, this sparked my interest. And I got too excited for it.  But it wasn't like what I expected.  The textures were far more generic and accessible than I anticipated.  There were some beautiful chord progressions though...and I could get lost in those repetitive jams.  I listened to it again.  And again, and ended up falling in love with it despite how it threw me off the first time.  They recorded most of it as a full band, together in the studio, and that [energy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0EgxB323J4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1138s) is so clear!  [Michael's entranced and repeated vocals are hypnotizing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyX7vc0k5_k&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=507s), and his normal singing as good as usual.  There are some gorgeous country melodies on here, [Song For A Warrior](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAtkPasef_o) is like a sparkling gem amongst the grittier darker atmosphere found throughout the rest of the record with its slide guitar and guest vocals.  However, [93 Ave. B Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDa7RwU0IFM) takes the title of top track.\n\n2: [**Fire!** with Oren Ambarchi - *In the Mouth -- A Hand*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvY7fE2_Ws0)\n\nThis album floors me every time I listen.  It's free jazz but it sounds like noise rock. The (distorted) bass and drums go back and forth between playing in jazz and rock styles, while noisey, messy sax shrieks over them.  To top it all off is Oren Ambarchi playing huge, noisey, distorted, dissonant guitar along with the core 3 members of Fire! The connected level these guys are playing on is just astounding, I've never heard a more full and intentional sounding improv rock release.  Overall though the texture is what I love most, just the dark, messy, warm atmosphere it creates (I associate it with being warm and safe at night, either in a car or at home, being alone and enjoying that, with dim lighting (like a lamp) and with the color maroon).  The 4th track, a more ambient closer, really brings it together as a full and dynamic album instead of just a bunch of big loud jams.\n\n3: [**Nazoranai** - *Nazoranai*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFeUwAfU6wo)\n\nMore improv noisiness!  This is the trio of Stephen O'Malley, Keiji Haino, and Oren Ambarchi.  This is a much colder, minimal, darker, deeper, blacker, and disjointed improv piece than the above, and I also find it to be a much harder listen because of this (in that its cold and lifeless atmosphere is too well done and hearing doesn't make me happy).  But that is part of the success with this album.  This is a very dynamic piece that ranges from nerve racking  silence to massive, jagged, abrasive, sharp, steely heights.  It is a monster of a listen, it feels like an undertaking each time, but Keijo's vocals at the end just resolve it so well that I feel utterly calm and empty in a blissful way after each listen.\n\n4: **Death Grips** - *The Money Store*/*NO LOVE DEEP WEB*\n\nTie!  I literally can't choose what I like more.  Overall Death Grips excites me with their noisey, cheap, lo fi production, and the hype that surrounds them definitely influences my excitement too.  Plus I'm a sucker for groups that are making music solely for the purpose of making and innovating art (like DG, Ulver, The KLF) even if they aren't making the greatest shit ever (as long as it is really good). TMS is catchy and fun and loud and is just unmatchable in production, nothing sounds like that (don't tell me stuff like [B L A C K I E](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlaTToeWDHA) even comes close).  NLDW, on the other hand, has all its [energy carried by Ride](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2c8Aeq7QTA), and I think that while TMS is the more [fun listen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74NA48f66kk), NLDW pumps me up more.  Plus, most exciting album release I've ever experienced (I still can't believe both NLDW and A!DB!A! both came out of the blue on the same day.  Oct 1st: DOTY)\n\n\nI know from our 2012 thread earlier that a lot of people really liked a lot of metal this year and I did too but honestly nothing blew me away enough to add to this list.  Same with hip hop.  A lot of really great shit, but nothing that makes me say \"that is a noteworthy release.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357271099", "subreddit": "LetsTalkMusic", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

The black dots are the roots, C in this case.\n\nThe strings are labelled from lowest (thickest) to highest (thinnest) E A D G B E. \n\nSo the top string and the bottom string are identical. And unless you tune your guitar differently than standard, they always will be. That means in patterns, the top and bottom string will ALWAYS be identical. \n\nOk. So now you need to find your first C note. Look at the powerpoint, in the first pattern. Thats where they are -- theres two in the pattern. 2nd string first fret, and 5th string third fret. \n\nThats really all ya gotta know right now.

{"body": "Not to be too contrary, but the internal springs pull the tremolo *away* from the neck. The strings--just to avoid confusion, what you tune to E A D G B E--provide the counter-tension.\n\nUsually there's three springs, but you can have up to five springs. Stevie Ray Vaughan did this. He also played the heaviest gauge strings he could find and the thickest neck he could get. But anyways... some people use *fewer* springs because they use abnormally low tunings. Lower string tension = less spring tension is needed (emphasis on \"less\").\n\nNow... some people like to block their tremolo so it doesn't float, essentially providing the stability of a hardtail. And some use a device called the Tremol-no, which acts as a lockable spring so you can go back and forth from these two settings.\n\nHope you found that interesting.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357321399", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not sure what you know theory wise, but I'm bored so I'm going to write some stuff down here. I'll be building as I go along, so skip down to where you think you should if I'm at a spot that seems too basic.\n\n___\n\n**Assumptions**\n___\n\nI'm assuming you know notes have names because you know some chords. \n\nI'm assuming you know how to count bars in music, although I'll touch on that below a little.\n\n___\n\n**Scale Steps**\n\n___\n\nWhen we talk about music theory, and especially about how songs are put together, we often talk about scale steps. In Western music, there are usually 7 unique steps in a scale and they are made up notes from the 12 note chromatic scale. For example, a C major scale:\n\n    C D E F G A B (and end on C again for the full octave*).\n\n    * = An octave is called an octave because it is an 8 step jump\n    (oct = 8); it's when we play a same named note at a higher or lower pitch.\n\nAn easy key for blues on guitar is E, so here is are some E scales:\n\n    E Major: E F# G# A B C# D# E\n    E Minor: E F# G A B C D E\n\nTry playing those real quick – probably they sound just fine but aren't quite what you're looking for. And you're right to think so, but let's cook on these for a minute longer.\n\nIn a scale, there is a \"1\" or \"root\" note, which is where the scale gets its name and is the first note in the scale – hence \"E\" scales start on E. You say you know the open chords, by which I assume you mean you know things like the \"E\" and \"Em\" chords, which are E or Emajor and then Eminor respectively.\n\nThe E major chord is made out of the E Major scale, and uses the 1, 3, and 5 notes. For example, on a guitar, E major is played like this:\n\n    Fret    Note Scale Step\n    e|-0    E    1\n    b|-0    B    5\n    g|-1    G#   3\n    d|-2    E    1\n    a|-2    B    5\n    E|-0    E    1\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Let's move on!\n\n___\n\n**The 12 Bar Blues Pattern**\n___\n\nSo now you know scale steps. We can use scale steps to declare what chords happen in a song if we know the key. For example, if I know a song is in the key of E Major, then when I read that it uses the pattern \"1 1 4 4 3m 2m 1 1\", I know I am playing \"E E A A G#m F#m E E\" (playing one chord per bar of music).\n\nIn musical notation, it is common to use roman numbers to describe the scale step; capital roman numerals for major chords, lower case roman numerals for minor chords. That would make my little pattern \"I I IV IV iii ii I I,\" and it means the same thing.\n\nThat example was a little 8 bar thingy – 8 chords played with equal time, counting repeated chords. The most famous blues pattern is simply called \"the 12 bar Blues,\" and it will be featured *a lot* in most of the blues you will stumble across. The simple version of the 12 bar Blues pattern only uses the I, the IV, and the V chords, which is the key of E (major or minor) are E, A, and B. So what does the 12 bar blues look like? Like this:\n\n    I I I I IV IV I I V IV I I\n\nOr better yet, look at it like this:\n\n    I  I  I  I\n    IV IV I  I\n    V  IV I  I\n\nFor a quick and example, check out [John Lee Hooker in Think Twice Before You Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEgOQHpvVtw), in which (starting just after 12 seconds) we hear the following:\n\n    (* = lyrics enter before pattern starts - this is an 'I' from the intro)\n\n    I*                      [  I        I                         I\n        Think twice before you go,         baby, this will be the end\n    I                          IV       IV                        I\n        Think twice before you go,         baby, this will be the end\n    I                          V        IV(hit and stop)     I\n        You done leave me one time,        baby you'll leave again\n    I                               ]\n        Dig in and suffer with me …\n\nAs you can hear and see, he actually starts singing slightly offset from the actual chord pattern; this is very common in music of all sorts, but it make it easier to follow along, I've added brackets around the chord pattern so you can see where things are falling.\n\n____\nEDIT: As an aside, while roman numerals are used to talk about chords, plain arabic numbers are still used to talk about scale steps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357429036", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay. I've spent about 6 or so hours on this problem over the past couple of days. I decided to do a bit of research, and found many people mentioning algorithms that centered around splitting based on the length and width. I decided to take this approach and build it around a binary tree.\n\nMy solution is written in Scala. Basically my algorithm works like this (note, the code works slightly differently):\n\nThe binary tree is composed of Nodes (containing either another Node, or a Leaf), as per usual. A leaf however, can be one of two types: a Rectangle, or it can be AreaRemaining. This is an example tree after inserting 1 Rectangle of size (125, 75):\n\n    AR(20,20),\n    ├──AR(20,6), \n    │  ├──Rect(12, 6)  \n    │  └──AR(8,6)\n    └──AR(20,14)\n\nWe have an AreaRemaining Node up top with 200 by 200 units remaining in all subtrees. The node directly under the 200x200 is where I start separating containers. All I do is recurse the tree from the left looking for a node with available space. When I find it, I split it by the longest side. So in this example I am drawing a line horizontally and creating two new AreaRemaining nodes (AR(20, 6) and AR(20, 14)). If I was to draw it, it would look like this at this stage:\n\n\n         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\n       ┌─────────────────────────┬──────────────┐\n     1 │ a a a a a a a a a a a a │              │\n     2 │ a a a a a a a a a a a a │              │\n     3 │ a a a a a a a a a a a a │              │\n     4 │ a a a Rect(12, 6) a a a │    AR(8, 6)  │ \n     5 │ a a a a a a a a a a a a │              │\n     6 │ a a a a a a a a a a a a │              │\n     7 ├─────────────────────────┴──────────────│\n     8 │                                        │\n     9 │                                        │\n    10 │                                        │\n    11 │                                        │\n    12 │                                        │\n    13 │               AR(20, 14)               │\n    14 │                                        │\n    15 │                                        │\n    16 │                                        │\n    17 │                                        │\n    18 │                                        │\n    19 │                                        │\n    20 │                                        │\n       └────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nI didn't illustrate the AR(20, 6) node, because it gets split again and contains the AR(8, 6) and the Rect(12, 6). Now we just recurse, and keep splitting into nodes. I have an extra Position object to help with hte drawing, but it's not neccessary. When I add two more rectangles:\n    \n    Rectangle(12, 6), Rectangle(3, 12), Rectangle(5, 10)\n\nI end up with a tree like so:\n\n    AR(20,20)\n    ├──AR(20,6) \n    │  ├──Rect(12, 6)  \n    │  └──AR(8,6)\n    └──AR(20,14)\n       ├──AR(3, 14)\n       │  ├──Rect(3, 12)\n       │  └──AR(3, 2)\n       └──AR(17,14)\n          ├──AR(5, 14) \n          │  ├──Rect(5, 10)\n          │  └──AR(5, 4)\n          └──AR(12,14)\n\nI won't draw the diagram like above because it takes too long, but the program output looks like this:\n    \n    ┌─────────────────────────┐\n    │ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 │\n    │ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 │\n    │ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 │\n    │ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 │\n    │ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 │\n    │ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2         │\n    │ 1 1 1                   │\n    │ 1 1 1                   │\n    └─────────────────────────┘\n      0 0 12 6\n      0 6 3 12\n      3 6 5 10\n\nWhere to go from here?

{"body": "This is a very good question, but it's also a very big one. The transition from DNA to functional organism is a massive, multilayered process with thousands of individual steps. While I'm not a geneticist nor am I going to do justice to the magnitude of the process, I'll do my best to oversimplify it and give you an idea of the way it works.\n\nThe function of DNA is to provide blueprints to a particular cell about what **genes** to produce. The DNA blueprint allows the cell to make a series of protein molecules which then (in most cases) go on to combine and form the *macromolecular machinery* that run the many systems and processes in your body. There are a number of factors that are responsible for the diversity of human life and that make every individual unique:\n\n* The type of protein a gene expresses\n* The amount of that protein the gene expresses\n* The situation in which more of a certain protein should be created\n\nThe control and management of those factors is called 'Gene Regulation,' and is a vital part of complex organisms because it allows the organism's cells to react and adapt to changing circumstances and keep the body alive.\n\nLet's take a look at the transfer from DNA to macromolecule (please remember this is a gross oversimplification):\n\nFirst, I'd like to remind you that DNA strands are made of two strings that run parallel to each other. Each string is just a big chain of repeating units called [Nucleotides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide). The nucleotide can have one of only four different molecules attached to it: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, or Thymine. The opposite strands of the DNA helix pair to each other in only two ways: Adenine touches Thymine, and Guanine touches Cystosine. Adenine will never touch Cytosine or Guanine, nor will Thymine. \n\n\n**Step 1: Transcription**\nThis is the process where the DNA strand is selected, unzipped, read, copied, and closed up again. A [Helicase enzyme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicase) attaches to the DNA strand and seperates into two separate lines (much like unzipping a zipper). This is possible because the two sides of a DNA strand are held together by fairly weak [Hydrogen Bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond). Next, another enzyme called an [RNA Polymerase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase) goes down one of the two strands and 'reads' it; detecting which of the four bases (A,T,G, or C) is there. After it reads a base, it then attaches an RNA nucleotide of the corresponding base to it. RNA is very similar to DNA except that RNA only has one strand (not two, like in DNA) and instead of using Thymine, its fourth base is Uracil. So, to put this a little more clearly:\n\n  \nSay a DNA strand reads like this:\n  \n|GC|  \n|AT|  \n|TA|  \n|TA|  \n|AT|  \n|CA|  \n  \nThe helicase unzips it, and the polymerase reads only one side:\n  \n|G  \n|A  \n|T  \n|T  \n|A  \n|C  \n  \nWhen it reads a base, it builds a corresponding RNA nucleotide on (RNA chain is in bold):\n  \n|G**C|**  \n|A**U|**  \n|T**A|**  \n|T**A|**  \n|A**U|**  \n|C**G|**  \n  \nNow the DNA strand has been nicely transcribed to RNA, and the DNA can be closed up again. The RNA string breaks off, and the DNA is zipped back up and restored in the cell.\n\n**Step 2: Translation**\nThe RNA copy (we'll call it the 'template') is shipped over to the [Cytoplasm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm) of the cell, where it will be converted into a protein chain. The cytoplasm is full of big molecular machines called [Ribosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome) that do most of the translation. The amazing thing about our DNA is that it only has four different bases from which to produce the tremendous amount and variety of molecules that regulate our body. The way it overcomes this obstacle is by sending information in packages of three nucleotides at a time. A big fat ribosome will latch onto the template strand and look at three of the bases at a time. It will use [Transfer RNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA) molecules to check the strand. Transfer RNA (or tRNA) molecules are like little keys. They are T-shaped and have three RNA bases on their heads and one of 21 [Amino acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA) on their tails. The ribosome grabs tRNAs floating in the cytoplasm and checks them against the template RNA strand until it finds one that matches. When it does, it breaks the amino acid tail off the tRNA and moves down the template strand to the next three bases. Let's look at our example:\n\n\nOur RNA Strand passes into the cytoplasm, and is grabbed by a ribosome (The RNA strand is shown horizontally, and the ribosome is not shown):\n\n**C U A A U G**  \n\nThe ribosome compares a tRNA molecule to the RNA temple:\n  \n**C U A A U G**  \nG G U  \n----    \n   |  \n *gly* &lt;- amino acid  \n\nThe tRNA does not match, so it is discarded and another one is brought in:\n\n**C U A A U G**  \nG A U  \n----    \n   | \n *asp*  \n\nThis one DOES match, so the amino acid is kept and the ribosome moves on to the next three bases of the template:\n  \n**C U A A U G**  \nG A U U A C  \n*asp*    *tyr*  \n\nOnce it finds a match, it adds the amino acid onto the first one it found, then continues.\n\nEventually the ribosome will have a big long chain of amino acids trailing off it, and ta-da! A protein!\n\n\n**Step 3: Everything Else**\nThe new protein wil fold and curl up due to mutual attractions between some of its amino acids. The shape and makeup of the protein will determine what function it provides.\n\nSo, to recap: Every three bases (each group of three is called a codon) in our DNA describes one amino acid. Each group of codons describes a chain of amino acids, and each group of amino acid chains (or only one chain, in some cases) describes a protein or other piece of molecular machinery.\n\nOur original strand:\n\n|G  \n|A  \n|T  \n|T  \n|A  \n|C  \n\nWill tell a cell to build the protein chain:\n\nAspartic Acid - Tyrosine  \n\nPhew that was a lot! And that's only the very beginning! Proteins are the foundation of macromolecular structures, and only a tiny building block for the structure of our cells. Consider that in only the first few steps, we've found that DNA holds sequences that encode every protein, every macromolecule, every structure in our body! That's a lot of information and it's incredible that it is stored with only four individual bases.\n\nThis is some truly mind-blowing stuff! I hope this gives you some impression of the way our DNA works. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357630146", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

Do this enough and your brain will turn the space between that tiny sixteenth note triplet into a huge gaping area that seems easier to play in.\n\nNormal singles: for starters, trying playing the \"downbeat\" with your upstroke. This works best when playing it slow, as you'll find it sort of difficult once the speeds get faster. Always play with a metronome, no matter what. After you've gone into that realm of splitting, start relating everything to your feet. Let's say you're marking time at 120 bpm. If you were to play the upbeat sixteenth notes in a 4/4 bar phrase, it would sound like this: \" e a e a e a e a.\" Fortunately, you're marking time! Relate it to your feet, and OH SNAP, you're playing this now: \"1e a2e a3e a4e a.\" That's way more attainable! \n\nDuring both types of splitting, alternate between downbeats and upbeats. Play it with a friend with accurate rhythm on the same pad (still with a metronome) to really give your ear a little training. \n\nOne last thing. The golden rule of bass drumming: never rely on the other members of the bassline to play all of their parts correctly. The metronome is on, and that is your god/allah/prophet/mother-in-law.

{"body": "&gt; I know they show the atom with electrons orbiting much like planets around the sun but I hear this isn't correct? \n\nIt is not. That'd be the Rutherford or [Bohr models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model) of the atom. The key concept of the Bohr model is that electrons can only occupy certain energy states (it's _quantized_). Essentially everything else about it is wrong, though.\n\n&gt; What exactly are \"electron orbitals\" IE S P D F and how are they reflected in the model of the atom?\n\nThey're an (approximate) description of the actual electronic states, which are specified by the shell (which corresponds to the total kinetic energy), sub-shell (which corresponds to the amount of angular momentum) and orbital (which corresponds to the spatial orientation of that angular momentum). You have these because quantum mechanics only allows for certain specific energy states (sort of analogous to 'stable orbits' but in quantum mechanics, particles do not follow well-defined trajectories, and thus it's not an actual orbit).\n\nBesides corresponding to an energy state (and angular momentum etc), the orbital tells you where the electron is likely to be in space (as quantum mechanics only tells you the probability of where things are likely to be; which is why you can't have trajectories). For instance, the 1s orbital is simply the probability drops off as exp(-r) where r is the distance from the nucleus. So in principle the electron could be anywhere since exp(-r) is non-zero everywhere. On the other hand, it's overwhelmingly likely to be somewhere near the nucleus.\n\n&gt; Are the \"orbiting electrons\" actually orbitals \n\nNo, electrons are electrons, and orbitals are the states electrons can occupy when they're bound to an atom. Since you can't tell electrons apart, it doesn't really matter which electron is in which orbital (and for all we know, they're constantly swapping places with eachother), so what really matters is only the orbitals and whether they're occupied or not. \n\n&gt; Other things that confuse me with regard to this are metals (a sea of electrons? Does that mean everything is ionized?) \n\nIt's not ionized. But the defining property of metals is that the orbitals on the atoms are all overlapping, close in energy, and only partly occupied. So the electrons can move about from one atom to another without hindrance - although not leave completely (so no ionization) - they're still bound to the metal, but within the crystal they act more like free particles than like the more strongly-bound electrons in a molecule. \n\n&gt; Also if the orbital atom model is incorrect does that mean the 2-8-8-etc electron pattern is incorrect?\n\nOrbitals is where this pattern comes from. The first shell (K) has only one sub-shell (zero angular momentum - s orbital) with one orbital (each orbital can have two electrons in it with opposite 'spin' states). The second shell has two sub shells (0 and 1 angular momentum, s and p). Again you have only one s orbital plus three p orbitals (px,py,pz) corresponding to the spatial direction of that angular momentum. \n\nSo that makes for 2 electrons in the first shell, 2 + 6 = 8 in the second shell, 18 in the third shell, and so on. They look [like this](http://www.chemcomp.com/journal/molorbs/ao.gif). \n\nTo give the _really_, abbreviated answer: Electrons in an atom behave in a 'wave like' fashion, and can only occupy certain energy states, whose shape happens to correspond to [spherical harmonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics) - which are the three dimensional/spherical analogue of what a standing sine wave is for a 1-dimensional wave. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1357934094", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can find some knock down. drag out discussions on modes in the r music theory page, lengthy treatises that describe the difference between a mode and a modality. Technically for one to be IN a mode, then the chord progression underneath has rules of resolution to follow, otherwise it's just a piece of a scale that we conveniently refer to as a \" mode\" because it's shorter than saying \" B to B in G major\" but if for example you have a progression that starts on G major and it leads to D major and resolves to G major again, that is in G major -the G Ionian mode, if at one point there was a Bm chord and you played B C D E F# G A B , it is NOT technically a B phryian mode, it's G major from B to B in G ionian, see the difference? So we as guitrtists refer to scale pieces as modes, but something is only MODAL, when the underlying chords resolve that way. For ex you may have played a minor song that starts on a minor chord that's the relative 6 of a major, and it goes through a progression and a cadence and resolves back to that same minor chord and maybe you played a natural minor scale over it, that would most likely be an AEOLIAN mode, LA TI DO RE MI FA SO LA.  \n So the difference between what lead cats refer to as \" modal\" or scalar\" vs \" Lead \" -these are more generic than specific.. It's more a distinction between Blues scales and riffs vs a scalar approach where hopefully more chord tones are being addressed. It also becomes a very esoteric point between chords when someone plays a 4 or 5 note passage to say if that passage was in a certain \" mode \" or not, the answer is most often technically \" NO \". \n So some things that you might be interested in at this point are\n 1. How does a blues scale fit inside a mode ex A blues ACDEG, how many major scales can you find that this would fit into?\n2. How do pieces of scales help in diatonic progressions, so something easy like I II III IV V -like a rolling stone By Dylan for ex you could play scale passages from the root of each chord. CDEFG, DEFGA,EFGAB,FGABC,GABCD, these are not 5 different modes these are scale passages from a major scale.\n3. what are some other kinds of modes or scales I can use&gt;\nwell, we have modes of Harmonic and melodic minor ( but as a guitarist I can tell you that looking for things like b5's to appear naturally in a scale is a bit counterproductive for a guitarist because we usually prefer to bend into these kinds of things instead of having them under our fingers like another instrument, because when they are, it can take some of the personality of the guitar out if the equation. \n4 what are some examples of true uses of modal playing\n  there are some to be found, but not nearly as many as we guitarists would like to believe, most things are Ionian major and in 4/.4, but not always. there is also a list of resolutions for modes somewhere, but I don't know where.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358101161", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Flexibility is everything. If your forearm muscles are too tight, you will suck, bottom line. Your wrist can move your hand and fingers up, down, left, right, clockwise, counterclockwise, and every movement in between. That means your forearm muscles circle your forearms. If all you do is grip and pinch, your bottom forearm muscles will be too tight, and vice versa.\n\nWarm up and stretch your hands and fingers in every direction every day.\n\nYou will get more reach, and your fingers won't pull each other as much when you try to move them individually. Sometimes you'll be doing a sweeping pattern where every finger stays above the same string on the same fret but your pinky and index will be alternating from the top and bottom strings. Like the C major chord sweep with the added 5th or G note, which has the pinky finger start on the C on the 5th string and then the G on the 1st string at the end.\n\nIf you stand up straight and let your arms fall down and relax your hands, and your hands form a pretty closed claw shape, your bottom forearm muscles are too tight (aka unevenly stronger than the top ones) and are thus tugging on the upper ones. That means you gotta do more exercises that involve bending your hand upwards, opening your hand from a closed grip, or even flicking the individual fingers will work those individual top forearm muscles. You don't even have to flick, just hold the flicking pose and have your thumb keep each finger from flicking, that makes it an isometric exercises.\n\nAt the end of every exercise, stretch your muscles opposite the way they were contracted. Doing bicep curls is when you contract or shorten your bicep muscles. After a few sets those muscles are torn up and warmed up, and then you stretch them by contracting your tricep as much as you can with or without having your other arm pushing your arm straighter and straighter. Another way to stretch your bicep is to try to contract it while your arm is totally stretch. The muscle will be pulling itself shorter while the arm stays still, which also causes tearing.\n\nThe biceps tear from doing contractions in the first place when they contract faster or farther than the actual arm is bending. Like when you're trying to bicep curl a weight that you can't even fully lift, your bicep will be contracting as hard as it can to bend your arm completely, but it will only bend halfway, so the muscle will tear from trying to contract all the way.\n\nAs long as you're not trying to curl something extremely fucking heavy or someone doesn't suddenly drop a piano on you and your muscles go into super overdrive contraction to survive, then the tearing will be a good thing. The good tears are micro tears. The bad ones are when it hurts a lot and looks like your bicep is fully contracted but your arm is almost straight, which is what happened to this guy I was working with when he was the only one at the bottom of the slope carrying a piano and he was in a hurry to move it.\n\nSo take everything I said about the biceps, and apply that to your forearms. You don't have to work out like an Olympic gymnast going for the gold medal, but at least work out and stretch every muscle a little bit so things stay strong and loose. Not only that but it ALSO increases your muscle awareness, aka the ability to sense the location and feeling of your muscles so you can have more control over them.\n\nThe MOST important thing to learn on guitar is control. In order to move your fingers exactly where they need to be, you need to be able to fully control them. So having them flexible and mentally concentrating on every feeling in your fingers, hands, and forearms is how you master control. Don't try to go any faster until you can get your fingers to land on the strings behind the frets the same way dozens of times in a row, that's precision. Accuracy is how close you are to hitting the mark, precision is the measurement of the difference of each time you do the same thing. If you hit the same exact string the same exact distance from the fret, with your fingertip the same distance behind or in front of the string, you are fucking precise with your movements. \n\nIf you can do a guitar riff but your fingers are always hitting different places of the string behind the fret, your accuracy and precision still suck ass even though you can make the notes ring out, and speeding up will only make you sloppier and you won't be able to learn more advanced techniques and be able to do them up to speed of the advanced players.\n\nSo work on flexibility and control above all else.\n\n\nAs far as music theory goes, learn scale patterns, and then learn arpeggio patterns you can do from each note in those scale patterns.\n\nFor example the C major scale is C D E F G A B C (the octave). The chords you can play are C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, B half diminished (B with a flat 5th and 7th is one kind you can do out of a few others). So when you memorize the scale patterns, learn major and minor arpeggio patterns and practice doing a major or minor arpeggio from each note in that scale. When you start practicing your solos, you'll want to know what notes to play with each chord, which basically means you'll want to land on the chord notes on the downbeats and the other notes in between. That's not the only way to solo but it builds your fundamentals of knowing which notes will \"work.\"\n\nSo on the C chord, do a C major arpeggio ( C E G and even B to make C major 7) from the first note in the C major scale. Then on the D chord do a D MINOR arpeggio ( D F G and possibly C to make D minor 7) from the second note in the C major scale, and so on.\n\nIn Jazz, you'll want to know a shitload of chord shapes, chord sweep picking techniques, arpeggio patterns, basically everything to do with chords. In jazz you'll be thinking more in terms of chords than keys, because in jazz you can have like 4 different keys, which basically means they'll play whatever fucking chord sounds good and jazzy even if it's from a different key, and then they'll move back, and then do a totally different key, so within one measure you could be in 2 or 3 different keys which means doing scales won't do you any good. Instead you'll be playing just notes from chord shapes or notes from arpeggio patterns, and then figuring out which other notes you can use for transition notes, which could be from any key. Like the A major chord is in several keys. It's either the first, fourth, or fifth in most cases, and thus at least 3 A major scales could be used to play slightly different transition notes.\n\nHope this helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358109696", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Stockdale spent seven and half years as a POW and was the leader of the POW underground resistance and endured torture, 4 years solitary confinement, etc.\n\nNotably, he bashed his own face in with a stool and cut himself while in captivity in order to prevent his captors from using him in a propaganda film.  \n\nThis book was very much about philosophy as it was his experiences.

Likewise, the beta session is a null session, also impossible to win. Caliborn's session is a dead session as it only contains one player, making it the third in the line of sessions that cannot come to fruition (unless, of course, he seeks out Yaldabaoth, but let's not get into that at this moment). As of right now, every session that is featured in Homestuck is bound to fail or impossible to win. The beta session's answer to this is to hijack the alpha session. The alpha session has unwittingly activated \"trickster mode\" for two players. I can't comment much on what Caliborn is up to because we've seen so little of his session, but the only hope that the alpha and beta sessions have to win their game is to cheat it. The difference is that the beta team purposefully intends to do this, and the alpha team began cheating unwittingly after receiving the S U C K E R made of Calliope and Caliborn's joined jujus and forcing Jane to activate trickster mode. Every session involved in the story currently is participating in some kind of behavior that the game does not intend and acting as \"game breakers\". I don't believe that the move to include trickster mode outside of in-jokes was entirely unexpected; trickster mode was foreshadowed in Calliope's gift to Roxy, and nefarious cheating and trickery have been a subtle theme underlying the alpha session since early Act 6, and ultimately cheating is the only way that the alpha session can progress. Trickster mode's \"game-breaking\" powers may be what it takes to help the alpha team beat the system.

{"body": "Hey there!  This might sound silly, but I recommend practicing singing in the shower.  I practice singing up and down scales just about every day when I shower and jumping from different notes in the scale.  Here is an example exercise:  Do Re So La Mi Ti Do   or C D G A E B C\nIf you sing leaps like these, it really warms up your voice and enables you to be more flexible when singing melodies.  \n\nAlso, try doing call and response with your guitar where you play something on guitar and then sing it back (basically the opposite of the video suggestion,) this will get your vocals going.  Once your voice is a little more comfortable with the leaps and copying guitar, you will be able to sing ideas that you wouldn't necessarily have thought of on guitar and then the whole process might work better for you.  \nIt only takes about 10 minutes a day to get the singing going.\n\nGood luck and let me know how it goes!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358180244", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Yeah, it's a cheesy song, but it's the one that taught me rock-solid strumming rhythm.\n\nThe key is your hand should be moving up/down at a steady eighth-note pace, no matter what.

{"body": "Take a scale and build a chord in thirds. The quality of the chord will come naturally out of the scale.\n\nI'll use C major to simplify this.\n\nc Major is: C D E F G A B (and repeats to C and starts the whole pattern over again.\n\nNow building simple triads (three note chords built in thirds) we get chords starting on each step of the scale.\n\nC: Built in thirds is C E G and is a major chord because of the relationship of the notes in the chord. C to E is a interval of a major third and thus the chord is a major triad\n\nD: Built in thirds is D F A and thus a minor chord because the relationship from D to F is a minor third.\n\nE : E G B and is a minor chord\n\nF : F A C and thus a major chord\n\nG : G B D and a major chord (triad and chord can be used interchangeably in this context but when you get into chords with more than three different notes, repeating notes an octave higher or lower do not count, the word triad is no longer appropriate)\n \nA: A is minor and built of A C E\n\nB : diminished and built of B D (minor third to B) F (diminished 5th relationship to B)\n\nIn any major scale this relationship will be the same as it is in C.\n\nSo in a different scale you use the same technique to build chords starting on each scale degree, but because the relationship of the intervals of the scale is different from the major scale you will get different qualities of chord for a progression that uses the 1st (C Major in a C major scale and C Minor with the original octatonic scale), 4th (F major in C major scale and F diminshed in the octatonic) and 5th (G major triad in C major scale and Gb dimished in the octatonic scale)\n\nThus you tend to use different chord progressions different moods be using different scales. That's why Major and Minor are so popular, since they both create different sounds while being related to each other (which is why its easy to shift between major and relative minor or vice versa)\n\nI skipped a few things that might confuse you if you don't already know about intervals so let me know if anything needs more clarification.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358196075", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Make sure that guitar is well tuned. Acoustics are more sensitive to tuning. Get a tuning fork (usually an A, 110Hz) and learn how to use it properly.\n\nSome simple scales to learn are the major, minor (natural/harmonic/melodic -- three forms of the minor), and maybe one other \"mode\", such as phrygian or dorian. Modes are just different \"angles\" of the same scale, IE: you start on a different note, but the overall scale is spelled the same. You've probably heard often that C major is \"the same\" as A minor. That means that A minor is a different \"angle\", or mode, of C major, but it has all the same notes. Don't worry too much about modes for now, but be aware that they exist. Learning the major and minor scales will help a lot.\n\nBe aware that certain notes (called **degrees**, and noted formally with Roman numerals) within the scale have **more weight, musically** than other notes. The first note (tonic), the third note (mediant), the fifth note (dominant), and the seventh note (leading tone) *usually* have the most power (like in a major or minor scale), but the other ones are obviously important as well, and different modes will have different general rules.\n\nLet's use **C major** for shits/giggles, and because it is easy to spell (no sharps or flats in the scale):\nC major --&gt; C D E F G A B \n\nOn the guitar, in tab, with three notes per string first string is high E, last string is low E.\n\n    e|---10-12-13---\n    B|---10-12-13---\n    G|---9-10-12---\n    D|---9-10-12---\n    A|---8-10-12---\n    E|---8-10-12---\n\nThis is shape spells out about two and a half repetitions of the scale, going \"C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F\". Practice that tab shape above until you want to kill it. Then do it again. Every day. Do it until it becomes easier than breathing and you can play it slow, fast or whilst talking to a friend. \n\nThe **tonic** (first note) is C.\nThe supertonic (second note) is D.\nThe **mediant** (third note) is E.\nThe subdominant (fourth note) is F.\nThe **dominant** (fifth note) is G.\nThe submediant (sixth note) is A.\nThe **leading tone** (seventh note) is B.\n\nIf writing about the degrees of the scale, you can also write them as Roman numerals, so that the tonic could also be the **I** note, or the submediant could be the **VI** note, etc. (It's important to note that Roman numerals can *also denote chords*. In this case, lower-case Roman numerals mean a minor chord, and upper-case means a major chord. You will usually see something like this in a progression like **I-vi-III-V** so you will know its chords and not individual notes.) \n\nQuickly, the tonic is home base, the first note of the scale, the one that sounds like \"ahhh, I'm home, I'm resolved, everything is good.\"\nThe mediant can be used as a stepping stone to the dominant, so if you have a chord progression that goes, in C major, I-V (Cmaj-Gmaj), you could add in the mediant (E) as an Emin chord, for flavour. Thus, your progression would be I-iii-V or Cmaj-Emin-Gmaj.\nThe dominant is like the \"second home\" or \"second tonic\". You can use it to set up a new temporary home for a section of a song, where everything then resolves to the dominant (Gmaj chord in key of C) instead of the tonic. \nThe leading tone is a note that will gravitate strongly towards the tonic, especially in a major key. This is because it is one fret away from the tonic. See the scale above. The leading tone is a B, whereas the tonic is a C. One fret difference. If you play that scale and hang on the leading tone, you will feel your ear wanting to gravitate up to that C. Your brain knows, it wants that resolution of moving from the B to the C. \n\nChords are made by stacking degrees, according to specific rules, in a scale. The simplest chord is called a **tri**ad, thus it needs three unique notes to be called a legit chord. Thus, in C major, you can stack the C, the E, and the G to make a C major chord. Power chords are not real chords, they are **di**ads, because they only have two unique notes. Chord theory is a bit much for now if you don't even know scales, but be aware that chords and scales are essentially two different faces of the same entity. Learn scales and how to play them mechanically then you can learn the rules for building chords. Note that the ideas for how notes (scale degrees) gravitate towards each other in different manners also applies to chords, but in a more complex manner. Simply, basic triads usually gravitate in the same manner as simple notes would, but four, five and six note chords imply more complex motion and can move in different ways.\n\nRemember this also: Music theory **is not** how you *should* play, it is merely a set of rules that, in general, allows for pleasing music for most people. Rules are made to be bent and broken. So, learn to bend the rules. People who never stray from what music theory dictates usually write dry and boring music and are afraid to experiment. The only rule that you should obey is this: If it sounds good, it's good. That's it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358198254", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Learn the scale shape, that is, the pattern that forms the scale. The patterns are dictated as **W**HOLE or **H**ALF steps. A whole step is two frets, like from fret five to fret seven. A half step is one fret, fret five to fret six.\n\nTherefore, the C major scale (C D E F G A B) has a pattern of:\n\nW W H W W W H\n\nFrom C -&gt; D is a W, from D -&gt; E is a W, from E -&gt; F is a H, etc.\n\nLearn that pattern, then you can start it anywhere and you will have the major scale with the first note as whatever note you started on. In my example above (the large post) I started it on the 8th fret low E string, which is C, so you get a C major scale. Try the same shape/pattern from the 5th fret low E, that's A major. 1st fret low E produces F major scale.\n\nI would recommend learning all 12 major and minor scales eventually.(there are 12 unique notes - C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B) But for starters, learn A major/minor, E major/minor, G major/minor, D major/minor, C major/minor and D major/minor.

{"body": "Tonguing - Open up your Arban's book to page 175 (exercises 77 &amp; 78) and start here, but we are going to modify the exercise a little bit. You're going to play each measure three times at a comfortable tempo. Articulate each way listed below once, and crescendo through to the last note:\n1) TaTaTaTaTa\n2) TaKaTaKaTa\n3) KaTaKaTaKa\nIt will be frustrating at first, but it will get a ton better, I promise. The tempo should be whatever you can comfortably single tongue at.\n\nScales - Yes, you definitely need to learn all of your minor scales! This is essential! Can you play your major scales in thirds? As in, C E D F E G F A etc..? Work on that, too. Same with minors. This will make any music you need to learn infinitely easier.\n\nRange - First off, remember 95% of trumpet players make their money between G below the staff, and G on top of the staff. Anything higher is great, but improve those first. I think your second two bullet points are really the same issue. But a great method for increasing endurance, as well as range, is the Carmine Caruso Musical Calisthenics book. It is really better to have a teacher that is familiar with it, but the first few exercises are something you can definitely work on yourself.\n\nVibrato - Listen listen listen! The best way to learn vibrato is to listen to the players who sound best. This means Phil Smith, Adolph Herseth, Ray Mase, Maurice Andre, Roger Voisin, David Bilger, Reinhold Freiderich just to get you started. This will do more than any technical exercise will.\n\nHorns - Where in Tennessee do you live? I would really try to find a music store where you can play some different horns. Keeping under the $2000 range may be difficult. A Bach Strad is the industry standard for pro horns, but they weigh in at about $2649. The Yamaha Xeno YTR-8335RGS is comparable, but still over $2000. The Jupiter XO line is a fantastic horn, and comes in at just under $2000. Being in Tennessee, though, you have an opportunity I wish I had. There are two AMAZING smaller horn manufacturers. One is Blackburn, which will most certainly be out of your price range, (www.blackburntrumpets.com), and the other is Lawler (www.lawlertrumpets.com). Roy Lawler is one of the nicest and most knowledgeable guys I've ever had the pleasure of speaking to. I purchased one of his horns when I was a senior in college, and it was a fantastic experience.

{"body": "\"As the number of intercepts, now being made at Knockholt in Kent, increased a section was formed in Bletchley Park headed by Major Ralph Tester and known as the Testery. A number of Depths were intercepted but not much headway had been made into breaking the cipher until the Germans made one horrendous mistake. It was on 30 August 1941. A German operator had a long message of nearly 4,000 characters to be sent from one part of the German Army High command to another — probably Athens to Vienna. He correctly set up his Lorenz machine and then sent a twelve letter indicator, using the German names, to the operator at the receiving end. This operator then set his Lorenz machine and asked the operator at the sending end to start sending his message. After nearly 4,000 characters had been keyed in at the sending end, by hand, the operator at the receiving end sent back by radio the equivalent, in German, of \"didn't get that — send it again\".\n\nThey now both put their Lorenz machines back to the same start position. Absolutely forbidden, but they did it. The operator at the sending end then began to key in the message again, by hand. If he had been an automaton and used exactly the same key strokes as the first time then all the interceptors would have got would have been two identical copies of the cipher text. Input the same — machines generating the same obscuring characters — same cipher text. But being only human and being thoroughly disgusted at having to key it all again, the sending operator began to make differences in the second message compared to the first.\n\nThe message began with that well known German phrase SPRUCHNUMMER — \"message number\" in English. The first time the operator keyed in S P R U C H N U M M E R. The second time he keyed in S P R U C H N R and then the rest of the message text. Now NR means the same as NUMMER, so what difference did that make? It meant that immediately following the N the two texts were different. But the machines were generating the same obscuring sequence, therefore the cipher texts were different from that point on.\n\nThe interceptors at Knockholt realised the possible importance of these two messages because the twelve letter indicators were the same. They were sent post-haste to John Tiltman at Bletchley Park. Tiltman applied the same additive technique to this pair as he had to previous Depths. But this time he was able to get much further with working out the actual message texts because when he tried SPRUCHNUMMER at the start he immediately spotted that the second message was nearly identical to the first. Thus the combined errors of having the machines back to the same start position and the text being re-keyed with just slight differences enabled Tiltman to recover completely both texts. The second one was about 500 characters shorter than the first where the German operator had been saving his fingers. This fact also allowed Tiltman to assign the correct message to its original cipher text.\n\nNow Tiltman could add together, character by character, the corresponding cipher and message texts revealing for the first time a long stretch of the obscuring character sequence being generated by this German cipher machine. He did not know how the machine did it, but he knew that this was what it was generating!\"\n\nhttp://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/fish.htm\n\nThere was a BBC documentary on recently which I will try and find for you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358286513", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Music theory is a system to analyze music.  Its most basic use is to identify harmonies, either by name (C major, E minor) or function (I - iii - I).  Analysis by name is the first step in understanding function, for example:\n\n* In the key of C Major, you see a chord containing the notes E, G, and B.  These three notes make up an E minor chord.\n* In the C Major scale (C D E F G A B C), E is the third note of the scale.\n* Knowing this, we can write the chord as \"iii\" which means \"the minor chord based on the third scale degree.\"\n\nThe next step is figuring out the progression of chords and how they relate to one another.  This becomes more complicated, for example:\n\n* In the key of C Major, you see four chords.  The first and fourth chords are C, E, and G, so they will be \"I\".\n* The second chord is D, F#, A.  This is a D Major chord, but what do we call it?  We know it is based on the second note of the C Major scale, so we could call it a \"II\"... however, when seeing a chord that contains an accidental, you should look at the following chord before naming it.  Let's do that.\n* The third chord is G, B, D, which is a G Major chord.  G being the fifth note of the C Major scale, we will call this chord a V.  Our chord progression thus far is: I - ? - V - I.\n\nSo what do we call the second chord?  The answer lies in something called \"Secondary Dominants.\"  You see, every Roman numeral has another name besides its number.  \"I\" is called \"Tonic,\" and \"V\" is called \"Dominant.\"  The Dominant, in basic theory, almost always lead to the Tonic.  V - I is the driving force in releasing musical tension.  So when we talk about \"Secondary Dominants,\" we are talking about a \"five-of-something\" that isn't in the key we're looking at.  The chord we haven't named yet is exactly this.\n\n* If we want to correctly name the D Major chord, we have to look at it in relation to the chord after it, the G Major chord.  In the G Major scale, a D Major chord is the dominant (\"V\").\n* Because we know the G Major chord is V, we can call the D Major chord the \"V of V,\" which is notated \"V/V\".  This makes our progression: I - V/V - V - I.\n\nOnce you have a grasp of secondary dominants, nearly every other concept of chord-naming extends from that.  Creating tension by highlighting a chord in different ways was the goal of composers through the ages.  Things such as Augmented 6th chords and Neapolitan chords are simply the evolution of secondary dominants.\n\nIf you want me to keep going, or have a specific question about any subject in music theory, I'd be happy to help.

{"body": "&gt; The first is where it says \"sort one copy by the first component\", how can you do that if you don't know the order?\n\nYou just compare them lexicographically.  The sort order doesn't have anything to do with the sequence order.  It's being used like an index.  For instance, if the original sequence was:\n\n    E J H W S A B\n\nYou'd have the following cards, in some random order:\n\n    A, B\n    H, W\n    J, H\n    E, J\n    W, S\n    S, A\n\nMake a list with them sorted by the first component:\n\n    A, B\n    E, J\n    H, W\n    J, H\n    S, A\n    W, S\n\nAnd another list with them sorted by the second component\n\n    S, A\n    A, B\n    J, H\n    E, J\n    W, S\n    H, W\n\nIf you put them side to side, you naturally see that they form pairs:\n\n    S, A    A, B\n    A, B    E, J\n    J, H    H, W\n    E, J    J, H\n    W, S    S, A\n    H, W    W, S\n\nYou can walk down both lists from top to bottom.  If the second component of the left list is the same as the first component of the right list, then you've found a (x_i, x_i+2) pair.  For example (S, A) and (A, B) -&gt; (S, B).  If they aren't equal then the pair on the left list must be the (x_N-1, x_N) pair, because it is the only one that has a second component that does not appear anywhere in the list of first components.  (If it did appear, it would have to be in this spot, and then the two would match.)  In this example, the second row with (A, B) and (E, J) tells you that the sequence ends in (A, B), so you write out (6, A) and (7, B) to the output list.\n\nYou've now got this list of (x_i, x_i+2) pairs, and you repeat the process.  You sort one copy of that list by the first component and another by the second component.  In the terminology of the problem:\n\n     F:      G:      H:\n    (x, x') (y, y') (z, z')\n        \n     W, A    6, A    E, H\n     S, B    7, B    H, S\n     E, H            J, W\n     H, S            S, B\n     J, W            W, A\n\n(E, H) on the left with a matching (H, S) on the right means that (E, S) represents a (x_n, x_n+4) pair.  And that is exactly what rule \"i)\" is saying to do: if x' == z, then output (x, z') to the new list, which will represent the t=4 pairs.  This time things won't always line up like they did before, so you have to keep track of where you are in each list, starting at the top.  But the lists are specifically sorted in a way that lets you determine membership efficiently, because you can infer when a letter can't possibly be in a given column, which lets you detect what kind of case you're dealing with.  Example: if the second field of the left column also appears in the second field of the middle column, as with (W, A) and (6, A), that means that you've hit a pair that butts up against the portion that you've already successfully sequenced.  (6, A) in the middle column asserts that A must be at position 6 in the final sequence, and (W, A) in the left column asserts that W is t=2 positions to the left of A, therefore W must be at position 6 - 2, so output (4, W) to the new middle column.  This is what rule \"ii)\" is saying.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358425390", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I used to be a competitive player, albeit when I was much younger. John Chew is right when he says that changing the distribution or point values would cause mayhem. Most good Scrabble is based on resource and risk management, not just vocabulary. \n\nLet's look at the X tile, one of the most important tiles for quick points and very little specialized vocabulary knowledge: There is only one X in the game, worth 8 points. There are five X words that are two letters long, AX, EX, XI, OX, XU. Playing a two-letter X word parallel with another two letters landing the X on a Triple Letter Score (TLS) is typically 52 points, blanks aside. Most experts score 380-500 per game, depending on how open or closed the board is, and this particular play works well on many board environments. The words QI and ZA (new word additions) have a similar effect for 64. Previously, Q, Z, C, and V had no two-letter words, which minimized their desiredness.\n\nIn the early game, since either side could conceivably draw into the X, it's hard to NOT open this play up to your opponent. So the X has a large equity value alone, as it pairs with any vowel. Take the pre-2006 Q and its equity is far worse.\n\nThe point is, there is synergy between tiles. If you lower the value of the X tile, it does not synergize well with the more common bingo-prone tiles, that is, A E I O U L N R S T. The X must retain a high value, as tile distribution and written value of the tile are inversely correlated. Lowering the value would cause an increase in distribution (logistic nightmare from Mattel/Hasbro's side). Bad racks exist now, but with an increase in Xs you would start seeing racks like ACDLRXX, and X wouldn't even be worth that much!\n\nAdd to it that the dictionary continually updates and we still don't have an agreed-upon standard worldwide (NA vs. rest of world) and you have a good idea of why we don't change the game. Letter values were originally chosen to represent value, yes, but Scrabble was never envisioned to be such a deep game. It has nothing to do with keeping the elite in power.\n\nFor a deeper look, I recommend Stefan Fatsis' \"Word Freak\" although outdated. It may have become a documentary at one point as well.\n\nI would actually argue changing the distributions would hinder new players, as the equity value is based on a competitive dictionary, where most casual players will not know words that drive this new valuation.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358524751", "subreddit": "modded", "score": 30, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you want a jumping-off point for further reading, this is called [Upper Structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_structure). The notes in a basic D minor 7 chord are D F A C. So you see, there's already an F major triad in there - F A C. If you take the Dm7 up to the 9th instead, you get a Dm9: D F A C E. Still essentially the same chord, but the 9th makes it more \"colorful\" in a sense. And now there's an entire Fmaj7 chord in there.\n\nThe point of this kind of thinking is that it lightens the mental load of thinking about all these different chords. If you already know an Fmaj7 arpeggio, you can use it over a Dm7 instead, and even though the notes of the arpeggio are the same, it'll feel and sound *different*, because their roles in the chord are different. F is the root of an Fmaj7, but the third of the Dm7, and so on.\n\nYou could take it even farther and extend it to a Dm11, which gives you D F A C E G. Now there's an Fmaj9 chord in there, F A C E G, but also an Am7, A C E G! It takes practice and experimentation to figure out when these upper structures \"work\" and when they don't.

{"body": "Some of my concerns/thoughts after messing with this game:\n\nLogistically, many starters for pinyin are not also enders. If I play \"zhuang\", you can bet there will never be a tile played in front of the z, locking up the entire board. Tone aside, two-character words really do need to be implemented. Not only would this be much better for learning, it unlocks new possibilities for word extensions: now \"zhuang\" could be used in \"qiangzhuang\".\n\nThe idea is there, but just like any other first steps it needs a lot of polish.\n\nIn Scrabble, the S tile is very valuable for adding plurals to common words. Chinese pinyin has no such alternative. This makes the Z C S N G tiles some of the only \"hook\" tiles available, and only in limited cases. (hu into hua into huan into huang into shuang chuang or zhuang, etc.)\n\nThen we have the problem with vowels. Not many pinyin words begin with vowels, and it structurally makes the board really cramped. Almost all my games (Pass and Play with myself since there's no big community yet) end up being very heavy toward the bottom right half of the board.\n\nLastly, there must be a way of introducing new vocabulary instead of me picking the same definition for something every time I play it.\n\nI think this idea is in the back of the mind for every Scrabble player who wants to learn a foreign language. However, pinyin is a very difficult way to pull this off. I kind of feel like radical anagrams would be another way of approaching a game, kind of like the Scrabble variant Clabbers.\n\nEDIT: Sneaking in an edit regarding the \"magic spacer\" tile. It's a decent fix, but geometrically is still not the best solution. Better would probably just be changing the board layout to fit the natural tile geometry.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358543762", "subreddit": "ChineseLanguage", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It just seems too complicated.\n\nFirstly, you would have to conspire before the game. The referees can't just be discussing this stuff out on the floor, and it's a fast paced game environment in which the three of them would need to work together to not only referee the game, which is universally agreed to be difficult job demanding a great deal of concentration, but also to gently rig the matches. So things would have to be pre agreed.\n\nIf that's the case, I don't buy that it wouldn't be far more obvious than it apparently is. There are two big examples often given of this kind of thing. The Sacremento vs Lakers series, and the Heat vs Dallas series. Why, if they are generally so careful to be subtle about what they are doing (so subtle as to have, y'know, no effect) would they suddenly go all out on what were really quite unimportant series? \n\nThe Sacramento team was hardly unmarketable. They had Chris Webber, and were the top seed. In fact, it took a crazy Robert Horry 3 to stop them from going into the game everybody points out as fixed up 3-1 on the Lakers. Why would the refs let that happen if, as Donaghy and so many allege, the NBA had arbitrarily decided that *that* series *had* to go to 7 games, even at the risk of blowing the whole fixing game open.\n\nThen with Dallas vs Heat.. if having the Heat win, or having a series not result in a sweep was really important, why do it in such a poor fashion? it went DALLAS DALLAS MIAMI MIAMI MIAMI MIAMI. So you fixed a series to go 6 games? Why not, you know, D M M D D M M. That would have been dramatic and more believable.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, people put this out there without much supporting evidence. To me, if you want to allege that games are being fixed to support the NBA's finances, then you have to point out a consistent trend where less marketable teams were suspiciously bumped out of the running, and I don't see that. If anything, I think the NBA has had bad luck with having it's star match ups be in the Finals. When they finally get Durant vs Lebron, the series ends 4-1, even though some of the games were close enough to tweek a little into a 4-2 or 4-3. \n\nThe suspicious games that people mention are suspicious, but not in a way that highlights the NBA as likely to be the one's fixing games.

It's not a *division* of the octave in a fractional sense. It refers to scale degrees.

You should be on A#/B(flat) (in theory it is technically b(flat) at the moment but that is semantics). Only going up one key is called a half step.\n\nSo, we started with F, whole step to G, whole step to A, half step to B(flat). Now we do a whole step. This one is kinda tricky. You would go from b(flat) up 1 step to B, and up another step (because it is a whole step, or 2 piano keys) to C. Notice there are no piano keys between B and C. That is because it is only a half step between the two. Same for E and F.\n\nOK so far, for FMaj, we did F G A B(flat). Knowing what a whole and a half step are, you can finish this major scale out by following this pattern, from tonic or the first note:\n\nWhole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half. --- Maj key.\n\nOK so for my example, FMaj. F, G, A, B(flat), C, D, E, F. This is an Fmaj scale. You can use this pattern for any Maj scale. Say the key of GMaj. G A B C D E F# G.

You will most likely find it necessary to go waaaaay back to very early pieces, from the early 1900's because if you play Cherokee, or the other songs that are extrapolated from it, but you have never seen the TV show Cherokee, that the song was taken from, you wont understand the song, but if you take when the saints go marching in, or Little Brown jug, you can hear the original THEN the improv, that's the real deal in my opinion, good luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358612491", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I am quite active in the blues scene, I've been doing it for a long time. Blues progressions really don't analyze quite the same, it's an area I like to call Dominant Harmony. Anyway sometimes a couple of chords together repeated can function as a BIG I chord or I7 , so if you listen to Green Onions for example which later became the blues song \" Help Me\", the beginning is E G A over and over but that's really a BIG section of I then they go to !V by playing the same motif a 4th up A C D, then V would be B D E etc, and it would be considered minor so if  small roman numerals make you happier then by all means use them. Back to your question, It's a big giant I7 chord  and technically the D7 is functioning as a V/V  for those 2 beats you hear it until it gets to the F chord ( and if you want to feel that all is well in theory world at this point allow me to reassure you with  several thirds built on top of an f note to show us the upper structure of the chord F A C E ( G B D ) F A so we could say that a IV will substitute for a V , just so DR Theory won't blow a gasket) bit it's almost easier to think of it as a BIG GIANT section of I7.

{"body": "The concept of triad pairs is definitely not limited to major triads.  Just for those unfamiliar with the concept of triad pairs, it is a method of organizing the essential notes of a particular tonality or modality using familiar structures (triads).  It is especially useful to improvising musicians and evidence of this manner of thinking is often seen in solos by Larry Carlton, Michael Brecker, etc.  \n\nFor example, let's say someone is trying to figure out what to play over the chord **G13(b9)**.  Typically, you would approach using the either the half-whole diminished scale (octatonic starting with a half-step for you classical folks) or the 5th mode of the harmonic major.  This would give you the notes **G Ab A# B C# D E F**   or  **G Ab B C D E F** \nSome people find it beneficial to think of this chord as the pair of triads G and E, since these are familiar structures and they give you the chords tones 1 3 5 and 13 b9 3, respectively.  The result is an effective and unique sounding method of organizing the notes that define the chord.  A pair of triads often has the ability to illustrate an entire mode.  For example, because in a given key there is only one set of two major triads separated by a whole step in a given major key (IV V), these two triads clearly imply a particular major scale or one of its derivative modes, depending on the bass note.  If the triads F and G major are superimposed over the bass note D, then the sound of D dorian will be obvious.  \n\n**In response to the OP's question:** you can use any triads you want as long as you understand the implications each triad has on the underlying harmony.  And just like there is only one set of two major triads separated by a whole step, there is also only one set of two *minor* triads in a given key (ii and iii).  So, theoretically, use of these two triads would work the same as a pair of major triads.  However, in practice, I've found that they tend to be slightly less potent.  Regarding your example of using G minor and A minor over C7: you can definitely do that.  There are techniques, like  placing the third and seventh (E and Bb) on downbeats, that well make use of this triad pair more effective.  So the most important thing is that you just **use your ears**.  Personally, I think that this approach to a dominant chord is rather bland and doesn't accentuate the tension associated with a dominant chord,  but I would never discourage anyone from experimenting with a sound that interests them.

{"body": "Intervals are a way of analyzing the distance between notes. When you write scales out using them, 1 is the root and each number after is a particular scale degree, a specific \"distance\" away. Based on this, each scale has a different set of intervals it can be written as that would represent it in *any* key if you figured out what the corresponding notes are. \n\nThis is what an octave looks like considering C as the root:\n\n* Perfect Unison (1) - C\n* Minor 2nd (b2) - Db\n* Major 2nd (2) - D\n* Minor 3rd (b3) - Eb\n* Major 3rd (3) - E\n* Perfect 4th (4) - F\n* Sharp 4th / Flat 5th (#4/b5) F#/Gb\n* Perfect 5th (5) - G\n* Minor 6th (b6) - Ab\n* Major 6th (6) - A\n* Minor 7th (b7) - Bb\n* Major 7th (7) - B\n* Perfect Octave (8) - C\n\nEach interval is exactly **one** key (black or white) up from the last on a piano. Or one fret on a guitar.\n\n\"The Major Scale\" (AKA Ionian) ends up being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, all perfect/major intervals.\n\"The Minor Scale\" (AKA Aeolian) ends up being 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 8, some major, some minor, and some perfect.\n\n\"Relative\" means that two different scales contain the same exact set of notes, just starting and ending in a different place. \"Modes\" are all relative scales to each other.\n\nEg. C Major - C D E F G A B C and A Minor - A B C D E F G A.\nNeither have any sharps or flats and contain the exact same set of notes, but they sound totally different. They are made up of different intervals.\n\nTo figure out the same thing in, say, the key of G, you'd just consider G to be your 1 and go up chromatically from there, assigning every note as an interval.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358670716", "subreddit": "ableton", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Wow, your arrogance is nauseating.\n\nDon't confuse knowledge for arrogance. I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'm not going to sugar coat my posts to make you feel better when you're incorrect and your knowledge is flawed. I'm always open to discussions or talks about photography or cinematography, but you have to understand what you're talking about. If you're unsure, you can look it up. In return you're asking petty questions such as if I know what a raw file is, which is either insulting or trying to show off knowledge that even my dad as an amateur knows.\n\n&gt;Do you know what a RAW file is? It saves 10 different luminance levels which can be edited later. \n\nDo YOU know what a RAW file is? It saves the data straight from the sensor with no further interpretation. It does *not* save 10 different luminance levels. I don't know where you got that information, but it's flat out incorrect. The JPG most people use is generated from the same data that the RAW file contains, they're not different ways of capturing images, just different ways of storing it. The RAW file generally contains a bit more information in the highlights and shadows, generally between 1-2 stops of information. The main reason you'd shoot RAW in any professional setting however is the lack of lossy compression.\n\nHowever, you **cannot** create 3 different exposures from the same RAW file. Yes, you can change your 'exposure' slider in whatever RAW converter has your esthetic preference, but that does not mean that you can suddenly create an image with an actual different exposure from your original shot. Your RAW photograph still has the exact same exposure as what you shot it on, period. The fact that a RAW file has some extra dynamic range to play with in post does not mean you can change the exposure. It's simply the raw data from the exposure you shot said photograph on. Nothing more. You cannot create more light in post-processing. End of story. What you call not debatable is physically impossible.\n\nA RAW file will contain about 12-14 stops of dynamic range in a prosumer DSLR of this age, but could be a lot less depending on whatever camera you use (Mostly related to the size and age of your sensor, backlit or not).\n\nThis Dynamic range is completely fixed on your exposure. Say this is the shot you took:\n\n[---][---][---][---]&lt;&gt;[---][---][---][---]\n\n[---] is a normal stop of information. &lt;&gt; is your exposure. This is the entire dynamic range of your shot. That means that with post processing, you can do the following:\n\n[111][222][333][444]&lt;&gt;[555][666][777][888]\n\nV V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V\n\n[1][2][3][4]&lt;&gt;[55555][66666][77777][88888]\n\nYou can throw information away in say, your shadows, and expand the information you have in your highlights. This might cause slight banding or the likes, but often is doable without too much issues, especially in highly detailed areas. This gives the illusion of a brighter image, but no extra information is added (Which is physically impossible).\n. However, you *cannot* do this:\n\n[111][222][333][444]&lt;&gt;[555][666][777][888]\n\nV V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V \n\n[000][111][222][333]&lt;&gt;[444][555][666][777]\n\nThis would be changing the exposure. Say you could theoretically do this, then you'd throw out the highest stop ([888]) of exposure and add an extra stop in the shadows [000].\nYou can instantly see where it goes wrong: Your chosen exposure is always in the middle of your dynamic range. You don't *have* an extra stop to throw in, because that data simply doesn't exist in your file.\n\nBy definition HDR is about creating a higher dynamic range then can normally be captured in a single image. That's what the technique means, it's purpose. So by definition, a single image can never be used to create an HDR, as it already has a fixed dynamic range to begin with.\n\n&gt;That's great, but that doesn't make you an authority on all things photographic. Cinematography may be similar but for things like this it can be very far removed. \n\nYou'd be surprised. A skilled cinematographer will have a much much higher knowledge of light, cameras and lenses the a skilled photographer. A good and skilled photographer is more concerned about his subject then his gear, whereas a cinematographer's job is solely related to gear, light and composition. I do not chose the subject. Many a cinematographer started their interest as a photographer, as did I. A great cinematographer can take a (technically) great photograph, but a great photographer will have a lot more issues creating a (technically) well shot film. The knowledge is exchangeable one way only, though there are always differences, albeit most information is universal between film and photography (And most certainly everything we've discussed here).\n If your job is photoshop (which is a tool, not a job. It's okay on the internet since no one cares, but if you're going to say that to anyone in the field they're going to have a laugh.) then I can understand the confusion with all the HDR effect plug-ins that exist nowadays that simulate over the top HDRs, which is often the opposite of HDR (As it increases contrast). However, this has nothing to do with HDR. There is a very definitive difference between HDR and faux-HDR effects, the same way that an exposure slider in photoshop doesn't change the photograph's exposure in any way. It changes the perceived exposure, but the data used is exactly the same. There's always more photoshop techniques to learn, as it's continuously being developed, even I learn more from time to time. Knowledge on how a camera and light work has a fixed roof. \n\n&gt;So you think he should have underexposed the image so that the bulbs weren't slightly brighter than they maybe should have been? You do understand that had he done that the rest of the image would be severely underexposed? \n\nThat's the entire point of an HDR. You take one shot at your normal (desired) exposure and you'd make a few others, including one that would have the rest of the image severly underexposed but the bulbs correctly exposed. You then combine the desired data of each image to create your desired exposure *with* the bulbs of the underexposed image. My point however is that because the lights are blown out, it is *not* an HDR photograph. This photograph shows the dynamic range of an average APS-C DSLR, with the highlights pulled back in post-processing (Mind you, they're still blown, pulling them back creates no further information, thus leaving grey areas without any information, which is a bad way to edit blown out highlights). In a proper HDR you'd have detail in all the lights and have the exact same luminance.\n\n&gt;Wait, I thought it was blown out? Your terminology is inconsistent\n\nMy terminology is very consistent, you're just mixing up two different sentences with two different meanings. The emitted light from the bulbs isn't high, but that doesn't mean the photograph can't be overexposed. Just like it's not very light in the room I'm in right now, but that doesn't mean I can't make an overexposed photograph. They're not mutually exclusive and they have nothing to do with each other. One is an object's illumination in real life, the other is the exposure of a photograph.\n\n&gt;The bulbs are going to be bright because they are the brightest thing in the image and it's a night shot.\n\nIt's not about that they're bright, it's that they were blown out in the photograph. The brightness of the overall photo was pulled down to create the atmosphere, showing the lack of highlight detail, which is a clear sign of this not being an HDR. Bright and overexposed are two different things.\n\n&gt;HDR restores detail through greater dynamic range\n\nThere's two issues with this statement.\n\n1. There's one very basic and important rule to post-production; You cannot restore information that doesn't exist. You cannot 'restore' dynamic range. You either have it in your image, or you do not. You can make it more visible by expanding your highlights and shadows and sacrifice some (less important) information in your mid tones, but the data was always there to begin with. HDR doesn't 'restore' any dynamic range. HDR is a technique that allows you to *show* more dynamic range in a single photograph then you'd normally be able to show. You have all the information, you merely make it more visible. To restore = To bring back. You cannot bring back which was never gone.\n\n2. This has probably caused some miscommunication between us. *Detail* is not an equivalent for *information*. When you use the word detail in regards to any post-production, whether it's photography or film, you're talking about, well, *detail*. The fidelity of the image, pores of the skin, the tiny emblem on a shirt. That's what the word detail means. You do not change the detail by changing the dynamic range. They're two different words with different meanings. You can show more *information* in an HDR then you would in a normal photograph, not detail. \n\nThe whole reason for doing HDR is to allow you to create photographs with a higher dynamic range then a normal photograph would be able to show. It's that simple, that's the meaning of the word HDR, always has.\n\nNow, I've given you the benefit of the doubt that you actually think you're right instead of just wanting to troll on the interwebs for some fun, so I've taken the time to write everything out as clearly as possible.

Too flimsy and it just felt cheap in my hands. Didn't feel unique at all. My iPad one was out performing it at the time since everything was made to run butter smooth on iOS. Not the case anymore with all these Android tablets coming out. Though they are smooth in the UI they still lack that smoothness from certain app who simply ported them over to android and didn't bother to make them unique.

{"body": "Ok, \n\nso a few things. \n\nFirst, good job. You had a nice range throughout, you hit different beats. good. \n\nSecond, if this is for an audition, kill the intro/outro music, and slate yourself. \"Hi, my name is &lt;name&gt;, and I'll be performing &lt;character&gt; from &lt;play&gt;\" this is just a business-y thing.\n\nThird, you had a reader lead you into the monologue, don't play to them. you end up with your face down and mainly in shadow. Play them off camera, but at eye level or a little higher, so your face is always up. It also gives you a weird chest out/bend at the waist thing you do a few times (at :37 for an example). \n\nIn fact, I would recommend trying (not filming this - just an experiment, here) the monologue with feet planted to the ground and no movement whatsoever. Then, only move when you absolutely need to. This doesn't mean you need to stay stiff as a board, but movement can be a nervous habit finding its way out of the body, bleeding intention away from the monologue. Finding when you **need** to move, and responding to it, will sharpen the actions - it may even give you a new insight into that particular beat. And all of this movement talk goes doubly true for film, where the camera picks up **e v e r y t h i n g**.\n\nFourth, no cuts. the monologue needs to be done straight through. Make a mistake? stop and start it over. \n\nFifth, the accent - don't worry so much about it. Do it neutral - better to be 100% following through on your action and intention than 75% committed and 25% worrying about your dialect. try it flat. \n\nI know this seems like a lot - it's not. it's almost all technical advice. Just presentation. The big thing - the heart of the monologue, you have a handle on that. So chin up. :)\n\nKeep working it, find the beat, follow your action - and then just give it to the audience. \n\nCheers.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358875142", "subreddit": "acting", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I just listened to the piece again, without looking at the transcription.  I still don't hear any Em chords, even with the E in the bass.  With so many harmonic and melodic arrivals on C -- and the C repeated on every downbeat in the ostinato -- and none at all on E, I can't identify any point that is clearly in an Em harmony.  The only bit that might be a candidate is the last measure of the phrase where the lower melody goes E C B E.  The first half is the same C major that's been a pedal harmony for most of the piece, but the second half tonicizes the E *briefly*.  I hear that as a kind of fakeout, though; in the measures with that pattern but not the C#, the pattern begins as an embellishment of the tonic C (also in the other melody as the clear tonic) but the very last note casts this idea into doubt.  If it were E C B C, it would not be ambiguous, but E C B E is.\n\nThinking about this more deeply, the part that *most* emphasizes a C major harmony over other interpretations is that repeated C on every downbeat.  If it were a b6 of E, it would need a resolution rather than tonicization.  By the way, note that *nowhere* is there a complete Em chord, but C chords exist aplenty.  The harmony in the second half of each bar is somewhat up for grabs -- I'm more confident with saying that the pedal harmony is a CM7#11 than alternating C and Bm.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358982354", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In my opinion, one really have to do some aural gymnastics to say that the first chord is a C6 chord instead of Em. I think you are prioritizing the ostinato because you are working more from an incorrect transcription than from your ear. I mean really, I would say to *ignore* the ostinato, because the combination of its range (note the 8va in the transcription—we are talking a lot of ledger lines here) and articulation (staccato) makes it really unimportant when investigating the harmony. It's nothing more than a special effect. High ostinati are often used without any impact on the underlying harmony; because they are so high in pitch they do not sound as dissonant as if it were lower.\n\nAfter eliminating the ostinato, what you're left with is two melodic lines that are entirely in E aeolian, with a twist on a *very* standard aeolian progression: i-VII-VI-v becomes i-VII-VI-#VI in the first phrase, and then i-VII-VI-v is restored in the following phrase. \n\n    ||: G   G   | E   E   | G F# E B | C#  C#  | G   G   | F#  F#  | B G F# B | C   C   :||\n\n    ||: E       | D       | C        | E C B E | E       | D       | C        | E C B E :||\n\nThese lower lines, in addition to being in a more easily perceptible range, are also much louder than the ostinato. I think you'll find that without the ostinato, the piece still sounds mostly the same.\n\n&gt;If it were a b6 of E, it would need a resolution rather than tonicization.\n\nYes, the 6 does not truly resolve anywhere, but it's not hard at all for the ear to supply an implied resolution to 5 when going from a V9 chord to a I chord. I don't know what you're talking about when you say that this C is \"tonicized\", as I do not see a G7 anywhere. If only it were—it would lend credence to your lydian reading.\n\n&gt;The first half is the same C major that's been a pedal harmony for most of the piece\n\nThere is no pedal harmony to speak of. There is a chord progression here. You are saying it's I6-II-I-vii, I guess? I am saying it's i-VII-VI-v.\n\n&gt; The harmony in the second half of each bar is somewhat up for grabs\n\nThere is a chord progression with a harmonic rhythm of one chord per bar. So the second halves are the same as the first.\n\n&gt; I still don't hear any Em chords, even with the E in the bass.\n\nThe E minor chords are at the beginning of each 4-bar phrase after the melody comes in. In other words, bar 5, bar 9, bar 13, etc. It's pretty clear. \n\n&gt;The only bit that might be a candidate is the last measure of the phrase where the lower melody goes E C B E.\n\nThe part where the bass goes E C B E would be overall a Bm/B chord (since there is no third, this is ambiguous).\n\n&gt;By the way, note that nowhere is there a complete Em chord, but C chords exist aplenty.\n\nThe fifth of a chord is not very important. A harmony can be very clearly communicated through a third in the proper context.\n\nPart of learning Roman numeral analysis is learning what notes are structural and what notes aren't. Not every note in a texture belongs to the chord. Not every simultaneity is a chord (CM7#11 should throw up a red flag if you are not playing jazz). Again, I think you are giving too much weight harmonically to something that is occurring in the 6th octave, and ignoring stuff that happens in the 4th octave. In general, throughout music analysis of any genre, the lower activity is more important in determining the harmony than upper-range decorations.\n\nedit: also, I'm pretty sure a raised 6 is a more common chromatic alteration in aeolian than a raised 1 is in any mode.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1358986274", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Don't throw ammo/medkits out in the open though, throw them next to cover.\n\nLike a couple other people have said, be proactive with repairs if you're running engineer.

Also, in a cycle of 5ths pattern the 7 of one chord moves down stepwise to the 3rd of the next, which is another strong way to play the 3rd on the downbeat of a chord.

{"body": "It's another way to think of them, and that's how I tend to order them in my head, too, but might not be the most intuitive to someone who hasn't grasped the color palate of each mode yet. I'd add another level of \"dark\" to the end of your scale. It's not strictly modal, but it shows up a lot in jazz theory, and it's the altered dominant, or \"super locrian.\" It's a Locrian scale, with the 4th flatted to become a major 3rd. In C major that gives C, C#, Eb, E, F#, Ab, Bb, C. Voiced as C7 with a b9 or #9 and b13 or #11. So the scale is the C7 chord plus all the possible extensions.\n\nHere's why I put that at the end of the \"darkness\" scale:\n\nThere are 5 possible dominant 7th chords. Lydian, Mixolydian, Augmented, Diminished, Altered. The most interesting part is that only two of them are derived from the same scale--the Altered and Lydian dominant.\n\n* Lydian dominant (G7#11) is the 4th mode of a melodic minor scale. (D E F G A B C# D, then start on G to get G A B C# D E F G) Still sounds bright because of the sharp 11 and natural 13, even though it has a flatted 7th\n\n* Pure Mixolydian dominant (G7) is the 5th mode of a major scale. I think it's brightish, because it usually resolves to major, and the 9th and 13th are still natural\n\n* Augmented Dominant (C7 #5) is derived from the whole-tone scale. (C D E F# G# Bb C) Sounds weird and extremely unstable, but I wouldn't call it dark. The 9th is still natural as well.\n\n* Diminished dominant (C7 #9 or C7 b9) is derived from the diminished scale. (C Db Eb E F# G A Bb C) It can get pretty dark, but when voiced with the natural 13th it's so jarring and dissonant that it gets a certain liveliness from the clash.\n\n* **Altered Dominant** (C7 b9 b13, C7 #9 b13, C7 #9 #11, OR C7 b9 #11. I just write C7 alt usually.) The 7th mode of the melodic minor scale, but it might be easier to think of it as a diminished whole-tone scale, since it starts like a diminished scale (C Db D# E F#) then transitions into a whole-tone scale (F# Ab Bb C). It can also be derived by taking a locrian scale and adding one more flat, specifically to the fourth scale degree, to get a major third. That's why, to me, an altered dominant chord sounds even darker than locrian mode, and belongs on the end of your spectrum up there.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359082469", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I recently completed my undergraduate degree in classical guitar performance, and the issue of \"speed\" was always one that fascinated me. I think I can offer some advice that helped me to get past a few of my own barriers. I'm also a violinist, so we're similar in that respect too. \n\nFirst, some technical notes. Playing scales quickly on the guitar is very different from playing them slowly or at a moderate pace- it's like playing in fifth position rather than first position on the violin, the rules change a bit. Another way to look at it is it's like spiccato vs. sautille bowing- same basic idea, but the speed changes *everything*.\n\n1. Make sure your hand muscles are stretched and warm. Stiff and cold hands make playing quickly very difficult. My hand circulation is very poor, so I would hold hand-warmers between scales. Likewise, ensure that your nails aren't too long to avoid unnecessary resistance. \n\n2. When playing apoyando, consciously try to \"mute\" the strings by returning your right-hand fingers to the string as soon as they leave it. If you play like this slowly, the notes will sound staccato. If you play like this quickly, it just sounds normal. That little extra bit of preparation does wonders for speed.\n\n3. Use as little left-hand pressure as you possibly can without getting any buzzes or squeaks. The less energy your left hand has to expend, the more quickly it can move.\n\n4. Try single-string exercises with basic, repetitive up-and-down left hand patterns. Removing actual scales from the equation makes it easier to focus on speed.\n\n5. Make sure that your action isn't too high. Consider using a lighter-tension string to practice speed with, if only for a while.\n\n6. Make sure you get enough protein. Your hand muscles are muscles too! They grow just like the others.\n\nNow I'm going to be a little sacrilegious. I think classical guitarists are too attached to *I m i m I m i m* and should start exploring *A m i a M i a m I a m i*. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCoho1DQWcs) is Julliard-trained classical guitarist Douglass Niedt using *ami* to play fast scales. He has an entire series of videos about how to do it, along with many example videos. Paco de Lucia also uses *ami* scales, and he's famous for his speed.\n\nI once met a Flamenco guitarist at a Sam Ash who had no \"classical\" technique to speak of, but used *ami* fingering to shred MUCH faster than I had ever seen in person before. He was reaching speed-metal velocity on a $300 Yamaha. No amplification, not even his own guitar! It takes conscious effort to prevent a weird 3 and 4 polyrhythm from occurring, but it eventually becomes natural. I'm not quite that fast yet, but I use *ami* for certain passages and it's worked well so far.\n\nObviously you should have a respectable *im* speed, but there's no shame in using *ami* for extremely fast passages. We don't all need to be Elliot Fisk. Elliot Fisk has a hard enough time being Elliot Fisk.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359153769", "subreddit": "classicalguitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi steakbake! I will give you an answer, since I get a feeling you're going to be downvoted for asking a question by others.\n\nTo start, CCTV is heavily contextual. The areas it is utilized in, the crimes it is meant to prevent, the prevalence of other crime prevention methods in surrounding areas so as to prevent pure displacement of crime, how well police and other stakeholders utilize the information, etc., these all have to be taken into consideration before starting a CCTV program that has any hope of being successful.\n\nThis rarely happens, though. As it stands, CCTV is an easy \"set it and forget it\" measure for politicians or lobby groups to push for to make themselves look like they're helping. \n\nIf you have the stomach to wade through a couple hundred pages (I had to do this in my undergrad, I would appreciate if you did because then it would make me feel less bitter and abused), this is a good resource that lays out a good summary of issues surrounding CCTV usage: https://www.cctvusergroup.com/downloads/file/Martin%20gill.pdf\n\nA quote from this: \n&gt;All the systems had the broad objective of reducing crime. Out of the 13 systems\n1\nevaluated six showed a relatively substantial reduction in crime in the target area\nc o m p a red with the control area, but only two showed a statistically significant\nreduction relative to the control, and in one of these cases the change could be\nexplained by the presence of confounding variables. Crime increased in seven\nareas but this could not be attributed to CCTV. The findings in these seven areas\nwere inconclusive as a range of variables could account for the changes in crime\nlevels, including fluctuations in crime rates caused by seasonal, divisional and\nnational trends and additional initiatives.\n\nVery, *very* rarely will you be able to find evidence that a CCTV program has done anything but be a measure implemented by a politician during a moment of public panic or outrage, and cost money. The amount of effort, time and money put into them in an ignorant manner could be much better spent in other areas of crime prevention, or at *least* if they considered if it would actually help at all. Security theater.\n\nAnother issue many have with CCTV systems is that you need someone watching the cameras to be effective. [These people can act in fairly disgusting ways](http://graduateinstitute.ch/webdav/site/political_science/shared/political_science/8787/ellie%201%2006-NorrisArmstrong-Social%20Structure%20of%20Surveillance.pdf). Having people literally making a game of your day to day life? Mockery, racism and perversion run unchecked.\n\nLast is just the perception of it. It has the possibility of raising fear of crime, yes (almost anything can cause a response in the public like this), but it definitely lends to big-brotherish fears. Combine this with facial recognition software that already exists and can track where you go daily (and unscrupulous companies and governments that are willing to share this information from their cctv networks), it's not unlikely to see a case in the near future where you will get a random text from starbucks with a coupon code because they noticed you go to their competitor a lot, for you to be given a visit by police asking why you're always looking so suspicious when waiting for the train home, or for your daily habits to be fed into a database for advertisers to target you differently than everyone else.\n\nSo, you have a system that is costing money, ineffective for the purpose it was created, discriminatory, and used to enforce petty bylaws to justify its existence. You can't ban people from wearing unflattering clothing, so you start to see people resist and start wearing wide brimmed baseball caps, sunglasses, baggy hoodies and pants to hide their figure to make identification even more difficult. Or, notably, start actually destroying the cameras. A crime prevention measure is a target of crime. It's quite interesting, really.\n\nAnyways. I hope that gives some insight as to some of the background surrounding it and why many hold it in such disdain. This isn't to say it is *completely* wrong, I believe CCTV is a healthy aspect of any crime prevention policy. If you rely on it and have it be so prolific as much as some places in the world, I believe you're going to have problems with resistance which will only grow as other privacy rights are stripped away. It's like wolves being pushed back into a smaller and smaller forest by a growing city, there's going to come a point where there's not enough there for them and the wolves will start roaming the streets.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359182723", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Moravia and spread over what is today the territory from\nCroatia to Bulgaria.\nCyril and Methodius were monks from Thessaloniki, likely with an\n“ethnic” Slavic background.\nThe Glagolitic alphabet was made from scratch, although there are\nconjectures about the graphetic predecessors for some of its glyphs.\n(It may not be obvious at the first glance at the graphetic\nlevel but there is a significant Greek heritage with respect to structure\nand function.)\nIts purpose was from the beginning to provide means for translation of\nChristian texts and liturgy into the local Slavic languages of the\ntime.\nThus it addressed the peculiar features of the target languages like\n[palatalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization).\nAs a phonetic alphabet it had many advantages over adopting, say, one of\nthe Latin alphabets of the time, and the connection to Christian ritual\nensured its widespread use.\nAlso, like in many languages prior to the introduction of Arabic\nfigures, the letters had numeric values assigned to them in order to\nexpress numbers.\nThese respected the alphabetical order, which is not the case with the\nCyrillic alphabet, and had thus a fairly logical arrangement.\nAlso in contrast to the Cyrillic (and Latin, trivially) alphabet, the\nGlagolitsa in history served as script for Slavic languages exclusively.\n\nCyril and Methodius were sent by the Byzantine Emperor as missionaries\nupon the request of Moravian Prince Rostislav, who was betrayed and\nsucceded by Svatopluk in late 9th century.\nWhen Great Moravia collapsed after the death of Svatopluk in 894,\ndisciples of Cyril and Methodius fled south to Bulgaria where some of\nthem joined the schools of Ohrid (today in Macedonia) and Preslav.\nBoth schools developed into major centers of Slavic literacy, so\nimportant that the local dialect gave the reference for the Church\nSlavonic liturgical language, which is with some justification called\n“Old Bulgarian” in modern literature.\nFrom Ohrid and Preslav the Glagolitic script spread into neighboring\ncountries, above all to Croatia.\nHere at the coast of the Adriatic Sea the Glagolithic literacy\nflourished during the Middle Ages and continued to serve as the script\nof the Catholic liturgy in the national language despite the Church\nschism in 1054.\n\nIn Bulgaria, however, the Glagolitsa was very early on superseded by the\n*Cyrillic* script, which originated in the 10th century probably at the\nPreslav school.\nOne of the great misnomers of history, the monk Cyril/Constantine --\ninventor of the Glagolitic script -- had no part in its creation.\nWith above information you’d ask:\nthey already had this special-purpose, elegantly designed alphabet that\npeople had been instructed to write in for decades, why on earth would\nthey invent *another* script?\nNow, the missing piece of information is that the east Slavic peoples\nhad been cultivating deep cultural and economic and political\nconnections to the Byzantine Empire since, well, almost forever.\nAt the time the Glagolitic alphabet was introduced for *liturgical\nreasons*, we can assume that greater parts of the population were\nalready familiar with some variant of the Greek language and the\nrespective alphabet.\nSo the Glagolitsa, despite its functional adequacy, had actually to be\nlearned in addition to Greek and was probably only of secondary value\nto the political and economical relevant classes.\nThus the new creation, the *Cyrilitsa*, came with a big advantage:\ninstead of replacing the common script of the region it extended it.\nIn fact, the early Cyrillic alphabet was so conservatively designed\nthat it introduced a few compromises that make it appear comparatively\nmessy.\nThe best example for this might be the numerical interpretation of the\nletters, which in Glagolitic -- as stated above -- followed their\nalphabetical order.\nNow, in Cyrillic, the numerical values of the letters preserved the\nvalues of their Greek counterparts, irrespective of the different order\nand the interleaving with the set of Slavic extension glyphs.\nAs a result, you could copy numbers from Greek texts into Cyrillic\nwithout recalculating or graphically altering them.\n(The number system was identical to the Greek one which is also true of\nGlagolitic.)\nThe tendency to leave things unchanged went as far as introducing some\nletters that had no function other than representing Greek letters in\nnames (ѳ, Ѵ, ѯ).\nNo wonder the Cyrilitsa caught on -- things were improved for writing\ndialects but remained the same for other purposes.\nSoon it was adopted among most East Slavic peoples as well as Bulgaria\nand Serbia.\nIts geographical distribution was and is roughly congruent with the\nextent of Slavic Orthodox national churches, which no doubt created a\nstrong association between script and rite.\n\nThe predominantly Catholic western parts of the Slavosphere lacked this\nidentification of script and ideology.\nAlthough the Glagolitic Rite enjoyed considerable use in Croatia under\nthe protection of the local Kings, since 885 the Vatican pressed for the\ndiscontinuation of liturgy in local languages in favor of the Latin\nrite on multiple occasions.\nThe Glagolitic rite was preserved as an isolated liturgical tradition\nwithin the Catholic Church.\nIts language, however, remained unchanged and over time diverged\nsignificantly from the Croatian vernacular.\nAs a consequence, Glagolitic alphabet fell into decline and was\nsuperseded by *Latin* scripts in the Catholic Slavic West.\nSince the time of the early Christian missions to the Slavic tribes\nthere evolved a supranational convention for transcription of the\nlanguages that the traveling missionaries encountered into medieval Latin.\nToday Polish resembles this de-facto standard most closely.\nE. g. Slavic consonant\n\n* *s*  (s,    Cyrillic: с) was transcribed s;\n* *š*  (sh,   ш) -&gt; sz;\n* *c*  (ts,   ц) -&gt; tcz;\n* *č*  (ch,   ч) -&gt; cz;\n* *k*  (c,    к) -&gt; c;\n* *ł*  (l,    л) -&gt; l;\n* *ks* (x/ks, ѯ) -&gt; x;\n* *ř*  (rzh/zh, рь) -&gt; r, rz.\n\netc. Similarly the vowels:\n\n* *ě* (ye/ya, ѣ)    -&gt; e, ye;\n* *u* (u,     у)    -&gt; u, v;\n* *y* (i,     ы/ъі) -&gt; y, i.\n\nand so on.\nFor instance, in the\n[Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum](http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost12/Gallus/gal_ch01.html)\nby the anonymous author known as “Gallus”, the name of the Polish duke\nSiemomysł was transcribed with some distortion as *Zemimizl* or\n*Semimisl*;\nhis son Mieszko as *Mesco* or *Mescho*, and\nhis grandson Bolesław’s name as *Bolezlavus*.\nLikewise, the capital city Cracow (Kraków) was and still is latinized\nas *Cracovia*.\n\nThis transcription, however, primarily served for representing proper\nnouns and never developed into a full-fledged alphabet for an\nindividual language.\nNevertheless it provided the foundation for the later development of\nthe Polish, Czech and Croatian alphabets.\nSo the *Latinitsa* actually prevailed in the West for roughly the same\nreasons as the Cyrilica in the East:\nit was very conservative in its design, extended (localized) the existing\nlingua franca via diacritics and had strong backing from the dominant\nreligion.\n\nThe Latin alphabet was so influential that it even contributed to the\nmodern shape of Cyrillic scripts.\nThis is especially true for the Russian variety which is arguably the\nbest known.\n[Emperor Peter the Great](http://www.paratype.ru/e-zine/issue04/peter1/peter1a.htm)\nwas personally responsible for the deletion of\nglyphs that were obsolete by the 17th century (e.g. *ѯ*) and decreed\nthat several others were to resemble Latin letters, not necessarily\nwith similar phonetic value.\n(See\n[this collection of scans](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category%3ARussian_alphabet_%28marks_by_Peter_I%29)\nof Peter’s hand-written corrections.)\nIn another spelling reform during the 1917 revolution the Russian\nalphabet was stripped of four further letters (ѣ, і, ѵ, and ѳ), three\nof which stemmed from the Greek alphabet, and orthography was adjusted\nto other contemporary developments in phonology.\n\nTo address OP’s question more directly, the differences among the\nCyrillic alphabets as used in modern languages can be explained\nanalogous to the development of different Latin alphabets:\nthey adress specific requirements of the local Slavic \nlanguages.\nTheir current state, i. e. the set of letters, is for the most part a\nresult of reducing the original Cyrillic alphabet that was designed to\nrepresent Old Church Slavonic / Old Bulgarian and was burdened by\ncompromises with its Greek predecessor.\nSome Slavic Cyrillic alphabets added diacritics to distinguish sound\nwhere necessary, for instance Ukrainian boasts no less than four\nvarieties of what my ears render as /i/: the letters и, й, і, and ї.\nAlso, the letter ґ is used to differentiate [γ] from [h] (г).\nBelarusian adds the letter ў which has approximately the same phonetic\nvalue as Polish ł ([л]).\nThe most drastic enhancements, however, have been made in the\nindividually tailored\n[alphabets for non-Slavic languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabets#Non-Slavic_languages).\nThe background of their creation is the result of long lasting Russian and\nSoviet influence in Asia and entirely outside the scope of the question\nat hand.\n\n\n------\n\nA comprehensive introductory text by Henrik Birnbaum and Jos Schaeken\n(in German) about the Old Church Slavonic language and its history,\nreally worth reading:\n&lt;http://www.schaeken.nl/lu/research/online/publications/akslstud/index.html&gt;.\nRegarding OP’s question I especially  recommend the chapter on the\n[cultural-historic frame](http://www.schaeken.nl/lu/research/online/publications/akslstud/as2_02_kapitel_b.pdf),\nwhich also contains a brief overview of the early medieval history of\nEastern Europe.\n\n-------\n\nEDIT:\nIf your browser fails to display Glagolitsa you might want to install the\n[BukyVede](http://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/aksl/Schrift/BukyVede.htm)\nfont (beware: non-free license).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359208712", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 134, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I would recommend starting off with casters/ranged of the same class(if they are the same class your spells will be identical and that is best for starting out). It is possible to box melee but it is more difficult if you are just starting out. In my opinion the easiest classes to start out with are all shaman, all hunters or all holy pallys.\n\nHoly pallys are easy because they can take decent damage from melee, hand of freedom, they have bubbles/LoH, spells are instant cast or don't require the target to be in front of you and you can heal yourself well. Holy shock, judgement and harsh word are all instant cast and denounce doesn't require the target to be in front of you(this is HUGE as a multiboxer since people will run though you to avoid spells).\n\nHunters are ranged, have slows and don't need to cast. They can either blow up people or kite them and have their pets do the work.\n\nEle shaman are what most people think of when they hear multiboxer. They are easy and dangerous. While ele are squishy the good news is you can heal, drop a tremor tot if you get fear bombed, stun or root enemies. Elemental shaman are easy to learn to play and once you get more experience they can be very powerful since with on the run lightning bolts and instant cast lava bursts they have very good burst. \n\nDo not use \"Assist Char name\" type macros, use a leaderless system. What that means is all the macros you have will be based off of a focus target and you can choose who is the \"leader\" at any time. The benefit of this is if you are killed you can switch to any other toon and keep going like nothing happened. The easiest way to tell a bad multiboxer from a good one is if they are using a leaderless/focus based setup. Also if your key cloning software doesn't already you should choose to bypass certain keys so they don't go to all the slaves like w a s d q e your auto run key as well as others(you will figure out what to bypass once they start doing crazy things and running all over when you don't want them to).\n\nSome helpful generic macros (from one of my toons I haven't played since Cata so I hope they still work in MoP)\n\n\n\n/target toon name                                         \n/focus                                                      \n\n\n\nthis is how you set who will be your leader, have it be the same keybind on all toons except the leader they will have /clearfocus for that \n\n\n\n/target [target=focustarget]\n/cast insert spell\n\n\nThis will be the macro for almost all simple spells, damage or healing. Remember it takes a fraction of a second for the server to tell the slaves that your focus has changed so if you switch from damaging an enemy to trying to heal someone it will take a second for them to switch targets.\n\n\n/target [target=toon name]\n/cast insert spell\n\n\nHave one of these for each toon just in case they are taking lots of damage and you cant wait that second to get a clutch heal off. I use these a lot in PVP, you can also have it heal yourself instead of one of the toons.\n\n\n/target focus\n/follow\n\n\n\n/cast [target=arena3] spell\n\n\nIf you do arenas you can have them hex/repentance/sheep all 3 people at once by changing the arena frame number\n\n\n\nI also add    #showtooltip spell name                 to the beginning of almost all of my macros, I like being able to see the tooltip instead of the macro name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is all I can think of at the moment if you have any other questions just ask! =)\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359333929", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Portugal here, welcome to bureaucracy hell.\n\nYou have to be 18 or 16 w/ parental consent, basically there are only two types of licenses that a member of the public can apply to and \"probably\" get away with it, sporting and hunting.\n\nWe have quite a few classes of firearms A B C D E F.\n\nA - military firearms - no fucking chance in hell as they are prohibited weapons for civilians, so unless you are active military or law enforcement forget about it. Yes even a 9mm Handgun.\n\nB - Civilian handguns of no higher than 7.65 cal - very hard to get (read unicorn) because you have to provide a valid reason for having them, self defense is not one of them, only if you have a job that requires it and then, maybe.\n\nC - Long guns with threaded barrels aka rifles and short barreled shotguns (less than 51cm barrel) - Be it a .22 or .30-06 you need an hunting or _very_ specific sporting license to buy one, timely and costly but doable.\n\nD - Shotguns with a barrel over 51cm - Hunting or sporting license.\n\nE - Pepper sprays and tasers - Simpler to get no license needed but you still have to register them.\n\nF - Airsoft and pellet guns - Must be 18 or 16 w/ parental consent, no license needed but you need to register all purchases. Biggest bullshit ever IMO.\n\n\nNow for the paper jungle: \n\nHunting permit, 60€ and can only take 2 very difficult and complex written tests per year, fail = pay again, wait for next year aka, you are not hunting this season. If you pass you can only get class C ir D guns. More on that later.\n\nSporting - Join a shooting club (trap skeet or paper), do a written test, take some practical classes, around 70€, if you pass you can only get class D or D1 guns and be a card carrying member of the club. (these are called competition guns, namely .22 handguns and rifles). Again, more on that latter.\n\nSo now you have a card that says you are a hunter or sport shooter, you have to prove to the government you can handle this responsibly, that means getting a firearms permit and this is where the \"fun\" begins. You will need a clean bill of health from your doctor and 2 copies of your criminal record which has to be squeaky clean.\nYou sign up for a two day course given by the Police Force, first day is a 8 hour class on civic behavior and gun safety, second day are practical tests, again, fail any of these, start over and pay again and this is the _really_ expensive part.\nFor one letter, say C (shotguns) you pay around 300€ total including fees for all this shit, if you hunt and want a C+D expect to pay in the vicinity of 600€ for this whole ordeal and that's if you pass all the tests on the first try.\n\nNow you have another card that lasts 5 years that says you can own firearms in the classes you applied to. After five years you have to renew it for about 30€, fail to renew this on time and license is revoked and if you own firearms those will be illegal until you sort it or ask for a domiciliary retention which means you own them but you have to keep them in your house indoors at all time and this is tempting fate because failure to to observe any of these rules = felony and prison time.\n\nSo you go and buy one or two rifles or shotguns, you have to register them, another 35€ on top of the price of the gun, even used, if you own more than 3 guns you are required by law to own a safe and they will randomly check this, again, you don't want to fuck this up. Gun registry is so backed up I'm still waiting for the papers on a shotgun I bought 2 years ago. Till then you carry a piece of paper saying the gun is registered to your name.\n\nNow you are ready to hunt or shoot range all you want, any of these processes will set you back at least 400€ in fees and on top of that you still have to pay for memberships and hunting licenses.\n\nI guess that's it, keep in mind that any of these processes take about a year if you don't fail any of the tests and they are very hard.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359381257", "subreddit": "guns", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This information can be used to compare the efficiency of keyboard layouts:\n\n    QWERTY 84 (32)\n\n    DVORAK 92 (70)\n\n    ABCDEF 95 (48)\n\nThe number in brackets is the approximate sum of all the frequencies of the letters in that layout's home row, where the fingers rest the majority of the time and where letters are most accessible. Because the keyboard tapers outwards, it makes sense to add this figure to the frequencies of the letters on the top row to get an overall performance value. Obviously, this is only rough and does nothing to account for the efficiencies gained through left/righthand alternation throughout common words, which is a design feature of the Dvorak keyboard where it gives the left hand the role of entering all of the vowels which tend to get interleaved between the remainder of the letters: the consonants.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the Dvorak layout is more efficient than Qwerty once it has been learned. Prior knowledge of a layout can impede adoption, but *any* arrangement of keys can be habituated to given a few months of use - the same can be said of icons, interestingly enough, which are remembered more for their position than what they appear to represent as studies have shown that arbitrary imagery is equally usable. What is striking is *how* much more efficient the Dvorak layout is than Qwerty, as its home row is so full of little used letters like J and K that the Qwerty is less than half as efficient within its home row than Dvorak.\n\nHowever, you can't write very much with just these ten keys: A O E U I D H T N S\n\nHence, it makes sense to add in the row above which by dint of being widest can provide access to even more letters. Giving Qwerty another chance it closes the gap quite well with a score of 84 versus 92 for the Dvorak. However, my ABCDEF layout is both stronger in its home row than Qwerty (48 versus 32) partly because the only low scoring letter it includes is Q, but mainly because it has two vowels: L M N O P Q R S T U\n\nWhat is surprising is that it appears to be stronger than the Dvorak, which surely can't be true... with a score when you factor in use of the row above that is 95 versus 92. The other thing in its favour as a *new* keyboard layout is that it appears uncomplicated as every key holds a single glyph and by being ordered alphabetically it is friendlier to those who would find themselves repeatedly 'lost' looking for the next letter in the word that they were struggling to type as they always know if the upcoming letter is before or after the one they have just hit given that they have memorised the alphabet at an early age. Hence, ABCDEF is rather like a piano that has been sliced and stacked:\n\n    0123456789÷x-+\n    abcdefghijk/=\n    lmnopqrstu!?\n    &amp;vwxyz'.,:;\n\nNote, the use of lowercase, making it 'What You See Is What You Get' rather than hitting Q and getting q\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359386784", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's obvious (well, to me anyway) that the file is Unicode. In other words, you're not opening it right.\n\nI'm really sleepy right now, so here's the short version: A string is not always an exact the same as a representation in bytes. In fact, it's only the same in a subset of all the languages, mainly English (and German and a few more).\n\nI'm not making much sense, but here it is: The most common interpretation of a text (a string) is by assigning one letter to exactly one byte. So, \"A\" is 65 (0x41), \"B\" is 66 (0x42) etc. This will only be good for about 256 characters (in reality, a few are reserved for control characters). This will cover English and some of the Western European languages. This will not leave any space for non-Latin alphabets, such as Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew or even Japanese and Chinese. So, instead of using one byte per character, you can use two. So, \"A\" is assigned again to 65, but it's two bytes (0x0041, or, as they are written to memory/disk: 41 00). To cut a long story short, when you open a file, there is an implied encoding when you open it, and it's the \"English\" encoding. This particular file was made in unicode (or UTF-16), so you need to decode the byte data you are really reading into an actual string. To do that, in Python 2 (that you seem to be using), you need the codecs module (Python 3 is much, much more clear than that)\n\nI probably am not making much sense (because sleep deprivation), but if you watch/read the [Pragmatic Unicode](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html) presentation (I hope that's the correct link), it should become clear to you.\n\nTo your problem at hand:\n\n    Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:31:26) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; f = open(\"myfile.txt\")\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; s = f.readline()\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; f.close()\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(s)\n     ■V e r s i o n P e r s i s t :   1\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; s\n    '\\xff\\xfeV\\x00e\\x00r\\x00s\\x00i\\x00o\\x00n\\x00P\\x00e\\x00r\\x00s\\x00i\\x00s\\x00t\\x00:\\x00 \\x001\\x00'\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; import codecs\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; s.decode('utf-16')\n    u'VersionPersist: 1'", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359413496", "subreddit": "learnpython", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Instead of lockpicking you can bash doors with your weapon; blunt weapons are especially good at this, but all will be able to break down all but magical locks--eventually. \n\nThe game is glitchy, and you can fall into the void or get stuck on corners occasionally. Save often in dungeons, and make sure that when you installed the game you got the latest patch ([2.13](http://www.moddb.com/downloads/daggerfall-213-patch) should be the latest, but it's usually included with most Daggerfall downloads). Avoid jumping on staircases. The game is also intentionally designed to kill you. If you fall into a pit it's up to you to get back out, which means either climbing a wall (walk into the wall without moving laterally) or case levitate or anchor. Many areas in dungeons that require levitation will provide a prop that'll cast levitate on you (hanging chains sometimes to that, for example).\n\nPersonally I don't have much of a problem with the controls. I recommend setting it to fullscreen and using a modern W A S D control scheme. Then keep your mouse cursor in the mode where you can use mouselook, and have a hotkey to go back into interaction mode for clicking on levers and things. Space should get you by for most interaction, however.\n\nYou're definitely *not* a badass in Daggerfall, and that's something I personally love about it. I find it hokey that the entire universe revolves around you in *Skyrim*. \"Oh you're the most important person in the world and only you can save us and you're Dragonborn and a king and blah blah blah!\" Nope. You're just a pawn sent by the king to do an errand he didn't want to do himself. You're expendable and everyone treats you as they should: a nobody. But then you get embroiled in a dangerous game between the land's competing powers and end up playing a much bigger role...\n\nYou can improve your jumping and running skills enough to hop from rooftop to rooftop, and you can also make spells and potions that enhance this ability too. Just keep practicing the skills you want to improve. (But only primary skills will contribute to your ability to level up.)\n\nYou can check your journal and dialog notes to see who gave you quests and what you should be doing, but it's not 100% reliable, and every so often a quest doesn't seem to show up there properly. You can click the compass to see what time and day it is to get an idea of how much longer you have, and also try different travel options to give yourself more time to complete quests.\n\nThere are few mods that I know about, but you might be interested in this upcoming remake of Daggerfall, called [XL Engine](http://xlengine.com/). This guy has taken it upon himself to remake the engine that Daggerfall, Dark Forces, and other games run on, and he intends to release a fully playable beta this month (though that may be pushed back now). Players should be able to mod it, and he may release the source code at some point.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359423571", "subreddit": "ElderScrolls", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Nice to see you! :P\nIve played around everywhere, so ill give you some tips of mine!\n\n**TOP:** I play riven as my main, and i can understand why you are having a tough time. For riven, what you have to do is CS, but whenever you see an enemy CS you hit them. This widdles them down and keeps them on their toes. When they try to do the same to you, either Use your E to run and absorb the damage, or rush into them, E A(Auto attack) W A Q A A Q A A Q A. If you have your ult, and you are confident you can kill them, R First, Ignite and continue the combo and add the Ultimate execute for the kill. Try to punish pepole for their mistakes but watch out for making your own.\n\n**JUNGLE:** I can understand why jungle is a big jump for you from ADC, Jungle and ADC are radically different roles. Some tips. For your starting go Wolves Blue Wraiths Wolves Red Wraiths for lvl 4 and blue start, for Red start go Wraiths red wolves wraiths blue wolves. Once you clear your jungle and are a easy ganking jungle, like say Lee sin or Nautilus, go try. sure, you might not kill anyone but half the time i go to gank they pop a flash. This makes it easier for the lane you ganked because of no escape. One thing that helped me get used to jungling is that i focused on ganking one side of the map. So, if i was playing lee sin, i would either gank and farm Top and mid or mid and bot. What I am reffering to for farming sake is the camps that are in between the two lanes, This does include their jungle. If they have no jungler or a weak one in comparison, go in there and steal something, but make sure you have it warded with at least one ward and one for yourself to jump to.\n\n**TL;DR**\nTop: For all melee champs, punish others who try to cs, if you can land a combo because no jungler, go and do it. If you want cs and are loosing lane, try using an ability (like rivens E for example) to get away.\n\nJungle: Memorize your ganking patterns and try tier 1 junglers before you get into other, more complicated junglers. If you are a intense ganker, focus on two lanes and alternate if one is having trouble, only stopping to go back or to farm up more.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I hope this helps!\n\nEDIT: Formatting woe's", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359565603", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hello there, I hope this helps:\n\n1) This type of question has you provide a mask that will be most efficient for implementation. It will typically give you a couple numbers to use. For example:\n    For network 172.16.0.0, provide a subnetting mask to accommodate 1300 users. \n\nIn this case, the focus is on the hosts. You first calculate how many host bits are needed. This takes practice, but you'll be using 2^x to figure this out; x will be the number of host bits needed. You'll make sure that this number is always more than the specified number of users, so in this case, it has to be above 1300. 2^10 = 1024 -- not enough! 2^11 = 2048 --perfect! So, you will start by writing out the network bits, for these won't be used in figuring this all out. 172.16.0.0 is a class B, so 16 network bits. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . x x x x x x x x . x x x x x x x x (we now only need to work on the third and forth octet.\n\nThen, figure out the host bits needed, which is 11 in this case (remember 2^11=2048). Of course, you'll be subtracting 2 from this number, so the available host IPs will be 2046. Anyway, add your zeros for the host bits to our mask. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . x x x x x 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nThe remain x bits are your subnet bits, which is 5 in this case. 2^5 = 32 subnets.\n\n*The same logic would be true if the question asked you to subnet with focus on the amount of subnets (for instance, specifying that you need 50 subnets). You just figure out the network bits first, then subnet bits, then the rest are the host bits.\n\n2) A similar approach can be made as #1. You are usually given the network number, and if you're given the mask as well, you just need to figure out network/subnet/host bits. For example,\n\nnetwork 192.168.30.0 /27 -- network bits = 24 , subnet bits (the ones after the network bits) = 3 , host bits = 5\n\nsubnets = 2^3 = 8 subnets\nhosts = 2^5 = 32-2, so 30 hosts per subnet.\n\nHope this helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359572375", "subreddit": "ccna", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

If you stack hp or arm/mr on her, she'll do tons of dmg still, but it wont be easy as q e w r e r w\nPENTAKILL.  You have to wait for the enemy team to blow all of their load on the tanks and counter the number of CC that has been used and how many more there are left and how many seconds you have to clean up.\n\nMy main concern about Katarina (although I love her to death), is that her mobility is crazy strong, in the way Kennen lanes are basically a waste of time to gank early game.  But then again, that's what makes Kat who she is.\n\nSo really, I think Kat doesn't really need a nerf, because you still have to have the skills to pull off a tanky Katarina vs glass cannon (which can be either an absolute disaster or 30-1-0 Katarina midgame).\n\nNow when you get to higher elos, I guess I can see how she can be a problem, but why not just get a CC team?  CC shuts down Katarina in a way that it didn't completely shut off Ahri's damage.  Her Q is a skillshot that travels fowards and backwards, her w is a pre-cast single-target spell, and her e is basically a close-range ashe arrow, AND she had 3 arcane shifts as an ultimate that she could use as both the initiator and escape in the span of under than ten seconds.\n\nAnyway, I'm just rambling now and I'm going to stop", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359664192", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "AAAAHH, oof, scary complicated-looking things. Okay, I'll try to parse this and explain how to read it. I'm coming from a solid six-year background of theory and playing scales and chords on stringed instruments (bass, guitar, ukulele, etc.) so I'm pretty sure I can take on this challenge. Wish me luck.\n\nSo. Well, a central part of these is that, as OP explained, the major and minor scales are, in a sense, the same. Let me explain:\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n\nThat's the C major scale. No sharps, no flats. Whole step (2 frets), whole step, half (1 fret), whole, whole, whole, half. Rinse, repeat. (If you're lost at this point, try going to musictheory.net, where you can get great explanations of this stuff. Also, learn some theory. It's super useful.) Now, let's look at A minor:\n\n    A B C D E F G A\n\nNo sharps, no flats. WHWWHWW, the minor scale. It's the *same notes* as C major, except it \"starts\" on A rather than C. (The theoretical way to say is that it is a \"mode\" of C major).\n\nWith this in mind, we look at the charts he put up. Notice in the top middle one, there's \"m\", then two frets up, a dot, then another one, \"M\"? that's the same distance between A and C! Check a piano-- A, A#/Bb, B, C. White key, black key, white key, white key. Four frets.\n\nThe chart, then, is a sort of a picture of the neck of the uke. So if you pick a note on one of the strings of your uke and say \"this is the root of the major scale I want to play,\" look on one of the charts for a red \"M\" on the same string as that note. Then what the chart tells you is what notes are part of that major scale. It works the same for minor scales, just start with the grey \"m\" and go from there.\n\nA note—these charts are from the point of view of looking at the uke while playing it. So right on the chart is up the neck, higher notes, and higher lines are strings further away from your face in normal playing position.\n\nI hope this helped?
