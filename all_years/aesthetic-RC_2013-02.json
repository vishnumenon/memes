{"body": "I have been in your same shoes OP.  After about a year of dating, my gf found out she was pregnant.  We got married a few months later, when she was 18, and I was 21.  My daughter was born 1 month after I turned 22.  I quit my job as a manager of a small restaurant, and got a job as an electrician.  I was working about 50 hours a week, Monday through Saturday.  I would leave a couple hours early on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make the hour and a half drive to UCSD.  I had applied from community college and had been accepted in the Bioengineering program, prior to ever finding out my gf was pregnant.  I would arrive home around 11:30 and start doing homework.  There were many nights when I was still doing homework when my alarm clock would go off, telling me to get up for work.  If I didn't have school, I would always accept any overtime that was being offered.  On Sundays, I would work side-jobs whenever I could.  I was barely eeking by.  I started to lose my mind and decided to switch to working only part time.  I switched to a M W F S schedule and went to school all day T TH.  We moved in with my parents, since my younger brothers had recently moved out.\n\nWithin about 6 months, my wife and my mother had a huge falling out and we ended up moving out and going to my wife's parents.  That lasted only a couple months as well.  My wife ended up getting a job at a coffee shop, and would work from 3 to 8AM.  As soon as she walked in the door, I would leave.  As soon as I returned home, she would fall asleep.  By this time, we had our second child.  I think I averaged about 4 hours of sleep, since I was able to function and my wife cannot function on less than 8 hours.  Because I was working part time, we lost our health insurance, and ended up on WIC and Medi-Cal.  \n\nBy this time, I had lost all my friends and my wife and I had drifted apart from never seeing each other except in passing.  We had stopped talking to each other and began resenting each other.  I began going through the motions of life.  The only people I talked to were my co-workers and my kids (but really not much conversation between an infant and a toddler).  My final year of school, I got a job working for a tiny little engineering company as a janitor at night, and a sales rep during the day.  However, the sales was really only answering the random call and mostly emailing with reps from different parts of the US and a few in Europe/Asia.  When I finally graduated, the company started to dissolve and the owner said I could stay, but should focus on finding a new job.  I probably sent out 200 resumes, and even landed a couple of interviews, but the only job offers that I received would have been for $10/hr.  I made more as an electrician or a janitor.  Nobody wanted to give a 26 year old recent graduate a job, and especially since this was right when the economy crashed.  The company I was working for ended up being me and the owner (I was only there because he knew I had a family to support).  We ended up getting a research contract for the Navy, and I switched over to R&amp;D (I suck at sales).  I have stuck with the same company for the last 5 or 6 years, and we are just now on the verge of making our technology to the point where we can manufacture.  \n\nLast month I finished paying off 1 of my student loans.  I have another 5 years of another.  I have 3 credit cards that are maxed out.  I do not have a penny in a savings account, and have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past 9 years.  My wife and I almost divorced because we had stopped respecting each other and had lost our connection.  We hit bottom when she went out with another guy while I was out of town for business.  When I came home, she started crying that she was sorry and she thought they had just been friends, but he tried to kiss her.  We sent our kids away for a weekend to stay with my parents and we finally started talking again.  That was the most emotional time in my entire life.  \n\n*HOWEVER*, things are not all bad.  My wife and I started getting help with our marriage.  We basically had to forgive and forget the neglect that we had shown each other for the past 5 years.  We realized that we were paying the same amount in rent as it would for a mortgage, so we got an FHA loan and bought a house.  Unfortunately, my company lost a contract and my pay had to be cut.  My son became very ill and was hospitalized.  Due to crappy insurance, our bills were thousands.  We fell behind on our mortgage and received horrible advice from BofA.  We almost lost the house and were about a month away from foreclosure.  There have been many times that one or both of us have not eaten for a few days so that we could afford to feed the kids.  Thankfully, my company gained a couple of contracts and my pay was put back to where it had been.  Plus a bonus allowed me to pay off my debt.  My wife was able to go back to school and received her bachelor's a year and a half ago.  Unfortunately, she lost her job in October.  We do not have cable, for a while we were stealing internet from our neighbors.  After years of neglecting ourselves and one another, we were able to find happiness again.  Today, we are still living paycheck to paycheck, we are slowly getting out of debt, but we are happy.  Most importantly, our kids are happy (for the most part).  \n\nDo not stop talking to your gf.  Do not stop giving your daughter the love and attention she *needs and craves.*  Seek help.  Talk to a counselor, a friend, a pastor, anyone.  Do not neglect yourself.  Life will get better.  You are not alone, and it will not be easy.  \n\nSorry about the wall of text, I read your post and did not intend to write as much as I did.

{"body": "This is a separate, though not unrelated, problem, and the answer is that it's a matter of perspective. It is impossible for me to prove that my mind is the same as it was yesterday, in part because in a very real sense it is not. Is there continuity or is there only the illusion of continuity? \n\nIt's comparable to taking the original copy of the Mona Lisa and each day splattering a tiny amount of paint over it. In a sense, the painting is altered (of course it'd be altered by age anyway, but splattering paint represents experience), however it is the Mona Lisa, it's just accumulated more paint. If you were to look at the painting on any given day and compare it to any other day, on some level, it would be difficult for me to say the painting is the same, because it has been changed. \n\nThis is not, however, a good comparison to what happens to the brain during the Moravec Procedure or the ATLUM Scan scenario. The main difference between the two of them is speed, but the comparison there would be taking the Mona Lisa and then destroying it a paint molecule or a canvas fiber at a time, on such a scale that you couldn't see any given fiber or molecule being destroyed and then replacing those paint molecules and canvas fibers made of different elements. \n\nNow in the second scenario, whether or not the curator, the museum patrons or even, indeed, the painting itself, noticed the Mona Lisa was unquestionably destroyed and replaced by a copy. \n\nThere's an over reliance in these scenarios of noticing as a key factor in whether or not you continue to exist or have been replaced/displaced by a copy. I think it stems from a strange conflation of third and first person perspectives. \n\nI think we can all agree that you can kill someone while they are either asleep or sedated or otherwise unconscious, or you can kill a conscious person so quickly that their brain has no time to react, and in either of these events the person who has been killed would not 'notice' that they had died. They would just cease to be. \n\nSo we can't say that a subject not noticing their death is proof that they did not die. \n\nHowever, this isn't the whole picture because in both the Destructive Scan and the Moravec procedure, you have a being that is exactly like you would have been which goes on experiencing the world as you would have experienced the world had you not elected to undergo either procedure. How can I say it's not you?\n\nAnd this is where I think the strange entanglement of 3rd and 1st person perspectives comes into play. If you've decided to get a destructive scan and I've elected to keep you company, than I'm observing you walk into a room and then walk out. We pick up our conversation where we left off and everything is exactly as if you just walked into a room and then walked back out without getting any scan at all. Well, exactly the same at least to me and to the version of you who has exited the room. \n\nEssentially though what has happened was this:\n\n|-------Your Life--------||---------Your Copy's Life----------\n\nThe copy not being aware/not believing itself to be a copy is not relevant to whether or not it is a copy. That it did not notice when your life ended, like with our sleeper, does not mean that its consciousness is literally the same as yours, it just means its a perfect replica of what your consciousness would have been like. \n\nIt's easier to see this distinction if we don't stipulate perfect conditions. Imagine for a moment that something goes wrong. The digital copy is created but the organic copy is not destroyed. That would look like this:\n\n|------Your Life------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                               |------Your Copy's Life--------\n\nJust as if your organic brain had been destroyed, the copy would \"wake up\" from the procedure believing itself to be you. The problem is, so would you. Now we can see that having one life end very quickly while another life, this one a copy, begins equally quickly is just a sleight of hand. \n\nThe trick that obscures our ability to notice where one discrete mind ends and another, which believes itself to the original, begins is even trickier in the Moravec procedure. Let your neurons be represented by l's and the digital replacements be represented by 1's. \n\nYou walk in and your mind could be represented this way:\n\nl l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l\n\nShortly after the procedure begins, it looks like this:\n\nl l l l l l 1 1 l l l l 1 l l l l 1 1 l l l l 1 l l l l l 1 l l l 1 l l\n\nBefore eventually they've all been replaced:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThere's never really a lose of consciousness, neither you nor anyone else can point to a time when you stopped being you and started to be a copy. It's like having 8 ounce of H2O in a glass, and then, molecule by molecule replacing it with 8 different ounce of H2O. What difference does it make if everything else is held constant?\n\nBut again, if something goes wrong the trick becomes readily apparent. Imagine that there is an error and that rather than destroying your neurons one at a time and replacing them with exact copies, the procedure instead destroys your neurons one at a time and replaces them with copies of the last person scanned. Let l's represent your neurons and let X's represent the copies of the last person scanned.\n\nYou'd start out like this:\n\nl l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l\n\nThen you'd progress to something like this:\n\nl l l l X l l X l l l l l l X l l l X X X l l l l X X l l l l l l l l l l X l l l l X \n\nAt this point you probably wouldn't notice anything is amiss. How aware are we of changes to our brain stem? Maybe we'd notice that we're a little faster or slower doing certain tasks, but would we leap to the conclusion the scan is the cause, or maybe we'd think that we need another cup of coffee or are just having a particularly good day.\n\nl l l l X X X X l l X X l X l X l X X l l l X X l l l l X X X l l X X l X X l l X X l X X l X\n\nNow changes in two key areas of our brain have begun and we're aware, consciously of something odd. Our mental map of our bodies seems a little off. Maybe our height seems wrong, maybe our gender identity doesn't really feel like our body anymore, whatever it is, something is happening. Meanwhile, memories are beginning to surface, they're so clear, why do are we thinking about a strange man we've never seen before but remember as our father? Why is he referring to us as his son/daughter when are female/male? Or perhaps we were cis and now seem to be trans* (which is probably somewhat close to what it would be like to have a female body and find yourself suddenly feeling male) or trans* and suddenly cis.\n\nIf the procedure isn't stopped before a critical point, you won't experience the world as you with some inexplicable emotions and memories, panicking that the wrong replacement procedure is being run in your head... instead, the person who is replacing your brain will experience panicking that they're being loaded into the wrong body. \n\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X \n\nSo, with the wrong map implanted in what was once your head, are you experiences the world as another person in your body, or is another person experiencing the world in your body? \n\nThe person never lost consciousness, the change was gradual, nothing was replaced any faster than it was in organic processes. Is it only because we can, as a third party observer tell the difference? Or because the first party observer noticed? Or because the copy in your body is aware that they are a copy in the wrong body? \n\nWhen we, as third party observers, can't tell that there's been a change, then it's almost impossible for us to accept that anything is different. Similarly, when we, observing ourselves, can't perceive a change, then it is almost impossible for us to accept that we have changed. And when we do not exist we can be aware of anything at all.\n\nI mentioned earlier that there is a strange conflation between the third person and first person perspectives. I think that we have a tendency to view ideas like upload like we view extra lives in video games. We're cruising through level 2-1 or Super Mario World with no problems. Everything's cool. Then we effe up. Miss a jump we've made 10,000 times, and we lose a life. No big deal, we still have two more and the game picks up almost where we left off. \n\nWhy wouldn't digital copies of our brains work the same way? We die, our last back up scan is loaded into our body (or one that our insurances has just had rebuilt for us, depending on the cause of death) and continue on our merry way. \n\nBecause we're projecting a third person experience onto a first person perspective. When we play video games, we may say, \"crap, I died,\" but we did not die. We are still sitting in front of our tv/computer. It's the third party prospective that brings continuity to all of our video game avatars, the one who made it through level one and then died in level 2-1, the one who started in level 2-1 and then made it all the way to level 7-2 and the one who started in level 7-2 and defeated Bowser are all given continuity by us. If they had a first person perspective, they would probably, like our back up scans, remember right up until they were \"knocked out\" or \"lost consciousness\" and then they remember waking up and it's like picking up where \"they\" left off. \n\nThe thing is, you aren't the guy who is picking up at 2-1 or 7-2, you're the Mario who eat it at 2-1. The guy who beat Bowser remembers the things you've done and credits himself for doing them, it appears that way to third party observers, but you've stopped experiencing anything at all. \ncont'd.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359709457", "subreddit": "singularity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

She does most of the instrumentation by herself, and it still sounds great. The drums loops are by no means standard, the ukulele is loud and clear, and her stunning and unique voice rises above it all. Holding the rhythm section down is her bassist who was inducted as an actual member of the band recently, playing nice progressions that are far from root notes. When needed, the horn section comes in to great effect and channels that raw energy of the album.\n\nThe songs range from very linear and smooth (\"Powa\"), to erratic and constantly changing (\"Gangsta\"). But both formats work perfectly for Tuneyards, who manage to put everything together in a cohesive fashion. Also worth mentioning is the great sound quality. Everything sounds so alive, which is a huge step up from the first album. The hi-fi recording really allows everything to shine through, and makes it hard to desire the lo-fi recordings of the debut.\n\nThe message, the energy, the passion, and the musicality of this record really cement it's status as a classic in my library. And the listeners agree, with Whokill winning the user-voted Pazz and Jop award for Best album of 2011. While Whokill can initially be disorienting and strange due to it's unorthodox song structures and vocals, it's worth listening to, because once you give it your full attention, this is goddamn sexy rebellion music.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359782990", "subreddit": "LetsTalkMusic", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you're talking about common practice music, there are particular idioms for these intervals.  First, remember that an augmented fifth is also a minor sixth, and an augmented fourth is also a diminished fifth.\n\nDiminished intervals tend to enjoy resolving inwards by semitone, leading to a kind of third.  Tonally, for example, the diminished fifth between the third and seventh degree of a dominant chord will resolve to the root and third of the tonic in that key; this is why you were taught that leading tones resolve upwards and sevenths resolve downwards in your harmony class.  Now, augmented intervals tend to resolve outwards by step, to some kind of sixth (which is some kind of third, but in inversion).  As you can see, they are quite similar, but you should probably expect that since they are actually the same interval.\n\nThe tritone resolves based on context.  For example in C major, if it's functioning tonally as a diminished interval (such as F-natural against B-natural), then it will resolve inwards to C and E.  If it is functioning as an augmented interval (such as the secondary dominant seventh of V, where F-sharp is against C-natural), then it will resolve outwards to G and B (likely the dominant chord).  \n\nAugmented fifths work in a similar way.  I haven't been in Harmony 101 for a while, but as I recall the primary romantic use of an augmented fifth was again in the dominant chord, where the fifth of that chord (D) would either ascend or descend by semitone to Db or D#.  This would create tension with the root and the altered pitch would want to continue chromatically by step to a consonant pitch (C or E, respectively).  Note that this would conceptually occur at the same time as the V - I resolution, so that C and E are both consonant.  I'm sure there's more use of this that I haven't mentioned, that someone who has studied more romantic or jazz music could tell you about.\n\nNote that the ambiguity of the tritone resolution is a major part of the augmented sixth chords (German, Italian, French).  The German x6 chord is exactly a re-spelled dominant seventh, where the minor seventh is re-imagined as an augmented sixth such that it can resolve outwards.  Where C7 would normally resolve inwards to F major, the same notes C E G A# instead resolve outwards to B E G B (a second-inversion I chord or cadential six-four), eventually becoming a B7 chord that leads to E minor.  The x6 chord in this example, C E G A#, would have been understood in context as the iv of E minor (A C E G) in first inversion (C E G A); the root A would be raised to A#, and continue chromatically to the dominant while the C falls chromatically as well.\n\nI hope this is helpful and not too remedial or off-topic!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359844026", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

Feel free to, but don't be offended when I call you out on using personal attacks in a lame attempt to validate your own point.\n\n&gt;Call it a conspiracy if that is comforting to you, but you have no idea what you are talking about. \n\nAnd a conspiracy is indeed what I will call it, because that's all it is.  A conspiracy theory. \n\n&gt;You refuse to even entertain the idea or give what I have shown you a look, the hallmark of an ignorant, complacent mind. Go ahead and mock me and roll your eyes and laugh as you type your response out or whatever you feel you must do in your misplaced sense of superiority. The entire music industry is run completely by three rapidly consolidating corporations (from the big six in 1998 to the big three in 2012), and you think it is an absurd notion that there might be some nefarious tactics being employed to targeted demographics? What a blind fool you are. The nature of money and power is the same no matter where you go.  You CLEARLY have NOT done your research, if you had, you would understand that you sound like an idiot. You arrogantly dismiss what you don't understand. You listen to bad music, designed for dumb people by a group who ABSOLUTELY has an agenda, whether you're willing to see it or not. I can't believe that in the face of the the economic, social and political developments of the past decade, that there are people still as naive as you. \n\nI will however stop you right in your tracks when you go on to babble about me not having done my research, not being willing to entertain your assertions, being ignorant, arrogantly dismissing what I don't understand (hahahah) blah blah blah, all the normal drivel you hear from conspiracy theorist (you forgot to call me a sheep though).  \n\nI **have** done my research.  Do you honestly believe this is the first time I've been confronted with the idea of the Illuminati?  Please, do not overestimate your own enlightenment, child.  I've put numerous hours into research on the theory and I reject it.  Period.  I think it's a joke, complete and utter joke.  I refuse to have the same old tired debate on the subject that I've had countless times before in my 25 years on this Earth.  If you expect me to engage in a discussion with you on it then you are delusional.  Why on Earth should I believe that you have a groundbreaking idea or some sort of game changing evidence that will change the conclusion I've arrived at in regards to the Illuminati. Why would you think that I would, after hours and hours of studying the subject, think that you have some sort of information that will change my rejection of the entire theory?\n\n&gt;Go ahead, squeeze your eyes shut and claim to have done your research, even though you readily contradict yourself and admit to not even entertaining an idea that challenges your perspective. I thought that you may be worth respecting as an individual capable of comprehending something beyond the drivel that you are, in fact, (as I said earlier) being spoon fed by corporate dominated media. This is evidenced by your REFUSAL to even entertain the idea of something that might conflict with your incredibly myopic world view. It turns out that you're just someone who is capable of using some fancy words and spewing out hip hop sub genres. I'm done with you.\n\nThat's not what's happening here.  I have not contradicted myself nor have I admitted to not entertaining the idea of something that challenges my perspective.  I have studied in depth a variety of theories in regards to the Illuminati.  I entered with an open mind and left having decided that it's complete and utter rubbish.  I am always open to entertaining ideas that challenge what I know, what I believe.  What I'm not open to is having a debate (a debate that is always frustrating due to common characteristics that theorist share, ones that you put on full display in this thread) on a subject that I have thoroughly studied and have found to be b u l l s h i t.   Absolute bullshit.  \n\n&gt;You listen to bad music, designed for dumb people\n\nYou have absolutely no idea what kind of music I listen to.  It's very likely that we have a similar taste in music considering what you described earlier as your taste in hip hop.  I'm a very intelligent person, I'm a very likeable person, I'm not a very impressionable person, and I'm very capable of drawing my own conclusions.  You accuse me of a false sense of superiority?  Take a look in the mirror and see what a person deluded into thinking they are the enlightened one truly looks like.\n\nSo what have we learned here?  You dislike her mainly because of your insane conspiracy theory.  You cannot tie that reason into why she should be in /r/crappymusic, and you struggle to have a debate without resorting to personal attacks, probably due to your insecurity.  All in all this has turned out quite funny, I went into this thinking I could have a thought provoking discussion about how we can objectively discuss and determine someone lyrical capabilities but instead I end up on the other end of a conspiracy theorist rants.  \n\nAnd yes, I did take some shots this time around, I felt it appropriate considering what I've put up with until this point.  I really do hope you are done now and will choose to not reply.  I honestly wish you would have made the conspiracy point earlier on so I could have dismissed you before I wasted my time entertaining a brainwashed simpleton.  \n\nReal Hip Hop lover OUT.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359876765", "subreddit": "crappymusic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok the best way to tell the key is by ear and by what chords are in the song. By ear takes practice and ear training. The chord that feels at rest to say is the one chord. Play a G then a D7 and stop. Your ears anticipate the next chord and naturally want to hear the G chord again. If you can pick out a Dominant seventh resolving, it usually resolves to the I chord that defines the key, unless it is a non functioning Dominant chord(the IV chord in blues) or a modulation which are different animals.\nIf you can pick out the chord in the song, learn the harmonized major scale. Go up a scale in skipping one note in the scale starting on C. Go up four notes ei C E G B and then go to the next note in the scale ie C E G B, D F A C, E G B D etc. These are arpeggios for the chords of the harmonized major scale which for C is Cmaj7 Dmin7 Emin7 Fmaj7 G7 Amin7 Bhalf diminished. If you are having trouble finding the key write down all of the chords in the song and see what harmonized major scale that they belong to. It works with triads as well, In certain contexts like punk and simpler music, the major seventh will not sound great with a triad chord IE B in a C chord but usually I find the dominant seventh does Ie F in a G7 chord so you can pick out a key easily by finding the Five dominant7 chord. This works in a similar way for minor key. Take the relative minor chord of C, A. The way to find the relative minor is by finding the sixth scale degree minor chord of a major key. Relative minor is referring to the minor key that has the same notes and chords as a certain major key. Take A minor for example. if you do the same harmonized scale thing it comes with the same chords a C major. Amin7 B half diminished C maj7 Dmin7 Emin7 Fmaj G7. The main difference is the G7 is not the tonal Dom7 of the key but rather a non functioning one that still sound good going back to a minor. (Think of of the tiger Amin, Amin G7 AMin Etc.) The way you use the Tonal Dom7(the five chord of the key) of minor keys is by turning or \"altering\" the five minor chord IE Emin7 into a dominant chord. So you often hear Edom7 to Amin even though it isn't in the natural minor scale. This is where you get harmonic and melodic minor but once again that's a whole different thing and not necessarily keys per say. This is generally the easiest way to find the key in tonal music. Modal music does not work this way but involves playing a major scale from different degrees using those different degrees as key centers. Take Cmaj playing it the C is Ionian which is the major scale and not really a modal scale. D is dorian, E is phrygian, F is Lydian, G is mixolydian, A is Aeolian or natural minor scale which is usually not used modally. B is Locrian which is generally never used as a modal or tonal scale because it never sounds at rest. Even though it is the same same scale, when you use these different notes as the resting point they all have different \"flavors\" IE dorian think \"So What\" by Miles Davis. Phrygian think metal songs that just go up a half step from the root. Lydian think simpsons theme or saria's song from zelda. Mixolydian think like a funk vamp or greatful dead kind of think almost like blues where it rests on dom7 chords but focusing on one chord. These are easier to tell the keys because the are generally more static and have less chord movement relying on the I chord more.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1359931896", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Umm... What? \n\nNot sure what's is confusing about my statements above. If you consult the table you will see that WBA are clearly in 9th place 12 points behind Chelsea. Whether we've dropped points against them or not is somewhat irrelevant, we're still 6 places ahead of them in the table and I doubt they'll be challenging for 3rd or 4th come the end of the season.\n\nAs for everyone else beating them quite easily: \n\nSpurs drew 1-1 with them at home and won 1-0 away to the Hawthorns. (4pts net) \n\nEverton lost 2-0 at the Hawthorns and beat them 2-1 at home. (3pts net)\n\nArsenal beat them at the Emirates 2-0 and have yet to play the away fixture. (3pts net)\n\nNothing is ever a sure thing, but it is not unreasonable to think that we could beat WBA at home in March, esp. without Lukaku available to them and Odemwingie making such a mess of his relationship with Clarkie. Also, their form in general has been abysmal since the turn of the year: L L L D L L. That's 1 pt from a possible 18 and is the worst in the Premier League. They're not playing anywhere near as well as they were at the beginning of the year when we faced them.\n\nIf we do win the return fixture, that would leave us with 3pts net against them on the year, keeping us on pace with the rest of the clubs competing for 3rd and 4th place (Spurs, Everton, Arsenal) assuming WBA can at least squeak out a draw at home to Arsenal. Even if Arsenal wins at the Hawthorns, it won't be a disaster because we have a direct 6pt advantage over them having beaten them twice.\n\nYou're thinking about this the wrong way, it's not as important whether we drop a few freak points at home to QPR, or away to WBA because other 3rd-6th place teams will have freak results of their own like Arsenal losing 1-0 away to Norwich, and Everton dropping all 3 pts at Reading, or Spurs losing 1-0 at home to Wigan. To some extent these results off-set, and it becomes much more important that we take all three points against those teams that are in direct contention with us for the champions league places. \n\nWhat it comes down to is how Spurs, Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea fare against each other. So far, we're bossing it on this front and have won every single match. These poor results against weaker sides are why we're out of the title race, they wont be what decides whether we make a 3rd or 4th place finish.

I would kill to back in the pways cleaning fucking brass with one headphone in, because that was ALL I had to worry about for that hour. OH NO cleaning knee knockers, have you had to track down 3 people to sign for your 13 week report, because they're lazy and you don't want them to get written up, because no one has the time to fill out the damn paperwork because I have too much shit to do anyways. You piss and moan about the little shit but have you seen 68 sitreps getting written up, or had the stress of maybe your 30+ year career end due to idiots you have never met are doing drugs hell a drug ring, or you've had suicides at your command. Some engineers gun decks there logs at the oil lab so you just leaked 900 gallons of fuel into the harbor and you are going to admiral mast for that.

{"body": "This is hard to explain without a picture. But I'm gonna give it a shot.\n\nFilm works with things called *frames,* meaning individual photographs. Take a bunch of them at a regular interval and play them back at the same interval and you get the illusion of motion.\n\nTelevision works completely differently. It's based around a thing called a *scan line.* A scan line is how TV converts light into electricity and back again. Your TV screen is arranged into a stack of scan lines, each going from left to right, stacked from the top of the screen to the bottom.\n\nTo convert something that was shot on film into electricity so you can watch it on a television, you start by converting each frame of film into a set of scan lines. This is done by *literally* scanning the film, by shining a light through it and converting that light into electricity, not unlike how a television camera works.\n\nThen, once you have each frame converted into scan lines, you divide the scan lines into *fields.* The odd scan lines — 1, 3, 5, 7 and so on — from one frame make one field, and the even scan lines — 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. — make another field.\n\nThen you rearrange the fields in this pattern:\n\nAA BB BC CD DD\n\nHere's what that means: You take the top field (odd scan lines) from the first frame (the \"A\" frame) and show those first. Then you show the bottom field (even scan lines) from the first frame.\n\nThen you show the top field from the second frame (the \"B\" frame), followed by the bottom field from the \"B\" frame.\n\nThen you show the top field from the \"B\" frame again, followed by the bottom field from the third, or \"C\" frame.\n\nThen you show the top field from the \"C\" frame, followed by the bottom field from the fourth, or \"D\" frame.\n\nFinally, you show the top field from the \"D\" frame, followed by the bottom field from the \"D\" frame.\n\nThen you start the whole process over again with the next frame, and repeat until the movie's over.\n\n*Why,* you might naturally be asking, do we do it this way? For *no other reason than because it works.* The details of exactly why it works are beyond the scope (and you probably know them anyway, since you asked this question), but suffice to say that this does in fact work, so this is how we do it.\n\nBroken cadence simply means screwing up the \"repeat until the movie's over\" part. Imagine you had eight frames of film like this:\n\nA B C D E F G H\n\nWith pulldown added for television, these become:\n\nAA BB BC CD DD EE FF FG GH HH\n\nThat's *correct* cadence: 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, see? This would be a broken cadence:\n\nAA BB BC CD DD DE EF FF GG HH\n\nThe cadence there is 2, 3, 2, *4,* 2, 3, 2, 2. Which is wrong. It's not a regular repetition of two fields, three fields, two fields, three fields. Your eye picks up on the fact that the cadence is broken, and the picture seems to \"jerk\" or \"stutter.\" That's why we avoid breaking cadence (which is easy to do when you're editing film for later conversion, but quite tricky when you're editing video that's already been pulled down).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360113583", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I gather all the computers in the house and arrange them in 2 concentric circles, the towers on the outside and the monitors on the inside, facing inwards. I open the League of Legends client on each computer and login simultaneously on all of them. While the login is processed I begin chanting:\n\nXypherous ^Morello **Xypherous** ^Phreak Xypherous ^Morello **Xypherous** ^Phreak\n\nAt this point a faded embodiment of Morello begins to hover above the outer circle of towers, moving slowly around the circle, leaving a trail behind him. If you concentrate on the trail it begins to spell out in large lettering **N E R F** and **I R E L I A**. His lips whisper each letter as it appears and after the completion of each word he mouths it. ^N-E-R-F *nerf* and so on.\n\nWhile this embodiment of Morello continues to circle around and the trail continues to spell the impending doom, a faded embodiment of Phreak emerges above the inner circle, moving around it in the opposite direction to that of Morello. He is whispering a familiar phrase. ^^Tons ^^of ^^damage. As each word completes, the air around him glows for a moment, leaving a glowing trail with the letters made of light behind him as he continues to move around the circle.\n\nUpon the completion of 2 cycles by each, a link forms between the outer and inner circles, moving from each tower to the respective monitor and then joining in the centre. In the centre an intense beam of light channels upwards and Xypherous himself appears within the column of luminosity. He reaches out of the column and hands to me a list of each thread and as he looks me in the eye with a focused gaze, he says to me in a booming voice **\"Give these to PhreaksChinstrap, for this is a good thing to do.\"**\n\nXypherous moves back into the column, now no longer able to be seen because of the intense light. The column of light begins to fade and Phreak and Morello's movements become less pronounced, the trails they leave more difficult to make out as they fade into nothingness. The link between the inner and outer circles fade and so does the list of threads given to me by Xypherous. Phreak and Morello each look towards me as they stop circling, with no more trails visible. They speak in unison before disappearing entirely. \"Contact support if you need any further assistance.\"\n\nOn each monitor, a list of the threads is now on the screen in completed reddit formatting, ready for me to give to you.\n\nI trust I have fulfilled my task.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1360125579", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 77, "controversiality": 0}

If you have notes that don't fit into stacking thirds like that, they are either extended tertian harmonies or just non-chord tones, which is hard to explain briefly.\n\nSo say we were in the key of A major. We have an G#, an E, a B, and a D. Stick em on a staff until you've got them stacked in thirds: E G# B D. From the root(E) up I see a major third between E and G# and a minor third from G# to B, making a major triad. There is a minor third between a B and a D. That means we have a major(the triad) minor(7th) 7 chord. Now since we established we are in the key of A, we know that E is the root of the mystery chord. Count up from A.. A B C D E. That's 5 notes up. So that's the fifth scale degree. And since we said upper case is for major chords, that would leave us with a V7 chord in the key of A Major.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360302230", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; It's not \"limited\", if you have SKI combinators (and you do). \n\nNot the friendliest answer, I think.\n\nFriendlier version of this answer: a very common programming pattern is that you want to make a black box that does the following:\n\n1. Take an input `x`.\n2. Feed `x` as input to two other black boxes, call them `f` and `g`.\n3. Feed the outputs of `f` and `g` to a third \"combiner\" black box: call it `c`.\n\nIn Haskell code:\n\n    combine2 :: (b -&gt; c -&gt; d) -- ^ c: combiner function from b*c to d\n             -&gt; (a -&gt; b)      -- ^ f: function from a to b\n             -&gt; (a -&gt; c)      -- ^ g: function from a to c\n             -&gt; (a -&gt; d)      -- ^ result: function from a to d\n    combine2 c f g = \\x -&gt; c (f x) (g x)\n\nSometimes you want to do this with three black boxes:\n\n    combine3 :: (b -&gt; c -&gt; d -&gt; e)\n             -&gt; (a -&gt; b)\n             -&gt; (a -&gt; c)\n             -&gt; (a -&gt; d)\n             -&gt; (a -&gt; e)\n    combine3 c f g h = \\x -&gt; c (f x) (g x) (h x)\n\nSometimes four, sometimes five, etc.\n\nThe S and K combinators are a generalization of this pattern.  Definitions:\n\n    s :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -- ^ f: a function from a and b to c\n      -&gt; (a -&gt; b)      -- ^ g: a function from a to b\n      -&gt; (a -&gt; c)      -- ^ result: a function from a to c\n    s f g = \\x -&gt; f x (g x)\n\n    -- | The function that takes two arguments and returns the first one.\n    k :: a -&gt; b -&gt; a\n    k x y = x\n\nThe definition of `s` may look unintuitive, but it can be derived from a careful analysis of the pattern exhibited by `combine2` and `combine3`.  The second argument `g` is the \"second black box\"; it turns `a`s into `b`s.  The `f` argument combines both the idea of \"first black box\" and \"combine the results of the two black boxes\": it takes two inputs—the global input and and the result of `g`—and produces the final output.\n\nThrough analysis I won't work out, it follows that `combine2`, `combine3` and all other such functions have an easy factoring in terms of `s` and `k`:\n\n    -- The `s` syntax means \"use s as an infix operator.\"  It is\n    -- left associative.\n    combine2 c f g = k c `s` f `s` g\n    combine3 c f g h = k c `s` f `s` g `s` h\n    combine4 c f g h i = k c `s` f `s` g `s` h `s` i\n    combine5 c f g h i j = k c `s` f `s` g `s` h `s` i `s` j\n\nI won't explain how this works any more than the above, but I'll remark that: (a) it relies on partial application for succinctness, (b) it's, arguably, the smallest intuitive set of operators that can do this job.  (Fun, profound fact: `s` and `k` are older than computer programming.  Their types are axiom schemas in mathematical logic, and are sufficient to prove all theorems of sentential logic that do not involve negation.  [See P2 and P3 in this link.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_system#Logical_axioms)  Fun fact #2: if you remove the types and leave just the rules (`s f g x = f x (g x)` and `k x y = x`), [`s` and `k` give you what's arguably the simplest Turing complete language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_calculus).)\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n           s f g :: a -&gt; c\n         +------------------+\n         |          +---+   |\n     &gt;---a--+-------&gt; f &gt;---c---&gt;\n         |  |       +-^-+   |\n         |  |         |     |\n         |  |         b     |\n         |  |  +---+  |     |\n         |  +--&gt; g &gt;--+     |\n         |     +---+        |\n         +------------------+\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360302794", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Ayem threw down her cloak and became the Face-Snaked Queen of the Three in One.

{"body": "To expand a bit on what KoleraHeliko stated, your two most likely scenarios are 1. that in a generation or so on the ship, everyone's kids are multilingual but there's a tendency to use one language over the others (likely English) or 2. there's a creolization process. Let's argue, as KoleraHeliko did, that English would be the lexifier. To date, all English creoles and majorly divergent English dialects that I'm familiar with (Nigerian and Jamaican colloquial English, Singlish, Tok Pisin) have gone on to be less inflecting than English. As Chinese is also isolating, you're almost definitely looking at a less inflected language. Presumably, Russian would still contribute a lot of vocabulary, but little inflection. Look towards Singlish - which is already partially a result of English-Chinese language contact - for some guidance.\n\nI'd tend to go for a six vowel system /a e i o u @/, that being a close approximation of the simplest vowel system among the three (Russian). As in English and possibly Russian, /@/ might be present only in unstressed syllables. Stress may also play out different because of Chinese influence - as with all these things, it's your call. I suggest losing Russian's palatalization completely, no tones as only Chinese had them, and I'd look into shared diphthongs to see what's common across all three. Once the language is fully acquired by subsequent generations, I might turn the diphthongs into long vowels and generate a long/short distinction in the language, but that's just an idea.\n\nConsonants: both Russian and English have a voicing distinction in stops and fricatives, Chinese has an aspiration distinction in stops only. Chinese probably loses here, I expect if either distinction is retained (as opposed to no voicing/aspiration distinctions at all) it would be voicing. One the other hand, English's complex syllable codas might disappear, prompting adoption of other words from Russian and Chinese to make up for words which have become homophones as a result. If we're positing a Cantonese-speaking Chinese group (which is admittedly unlikely) you'd have strong justification for allowing only /p t k/ and nasals as final consonants, which I think could be interesting.\n\nFinally, I'd definitely look into putting a lot of Chinese influence in the grammar. As endings get simplified, English would begin to lose a lot of grammatical suffixes, like plural -s and past tense -ed. A logical place to make up for these gaps would be to adopt from the nearby language with isolating tendencies - Chinese - which could make things interesting.\n\nJust my thoughts.\n\nEDIT: spelling, extra words, general clarity", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360368536", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

You can do this by speaking with professors in various fields that interest you during office hours, or after class, investigating awesome things other students are working on, and banging lots of people.

It most cases, that interval will be stacked on top of the already major or minor chord.  \n\nJust a \"7\" chord, for example a C7 chord, has what's called a dominant 7th.  In the C major scale (C D E F G A B then C again as the octave), the B note is the 7th scale degree.  To make a dominant 7th chord, you take the root (C), the major 3rd (E), and the 5th (G) to make up the standard major chord, then add a flatted 7th, in this case Bb.  So in all we have C E G Bb to make a C7.  This type of chord is mostly used for blues and jazz but is very versatile.  When you play it you should try listening for the difference in just the major chord and the 7th chord, it has a distinct feel to it.\n\nA minor 7th chord is the same thing (a dominant 7th), except with a flatted (minor) 3rd.  So using the same example as above, to make a Cm7 we would have C Eb G Bb.  Slightly less commonly used, it's still important to know and is fairly simple to remember.\n\nA M7 chord is a chord that has a major 7th in it, as opposed to the dominant 7th we encountered in the previous chords.  Basically you're just not flatting the 7th anymore, as in the above chords.

{"body": "The scale degree's and intervals are interconnected, they are one and the same. but you get them both differently. The interval is dependant on which note was played previous to it. The scale degree derives from the key of the song you are listening to. If you try to do everything by scale degrees, it means you will have to be able to imagine the tonic note at all times and you will be trying to relate everything to that. Lets analyze mary had a little lamb for example.\nIf you use scale degrees analysis then (assuming we are in the key of C major) the first note of the song is an E. (meanwhile you are humming a c in your head for a reference note) and so you hear the interval connection and decide its a major 3rd. Next note is a D, So you (still trying to remember what C sounds like) compare the 2 reference points and say its a major 2nd away from C. and so you decide that it is the 2nd degree of the scale... Anyway this goes on for a while but by the time you get half way through the song its going to be hard to remember what that C sounds like unless you have actually been singing that note out loud the whole time. Maybe mary had a little lamb was a bad example. But anyway lets try process number 2 shall we\n\nInterval analysis,\nSo same song, you start with E, all you think about is that note. Next note is D, Now sing E D E D and decide what interval that is, Its a major 2nd descending. Next note C, now the last note you were on is D so sing D C D C and decide what that interval is, again Major 2nd. holy ass i just realized this song is like entirely major seconds. but anyway you can imagine it with any other melody, Simply keeping track of the last note that was played and then referencing it to the next. This way is easier for melodic dictaion.\n\n as far as melodic dictation goes you should just be able to draw a line in your head and just either remember the intervals or write them down quickly on the paper. Like literally just the interval number. Then after the song is done write in the actual notes according to your numbers that you wrote down.\n\nAs far as sight singing goes you have to think of it like any sight reading. If you just take it out and dont even look at the paper and just go for it then you will have to do it by interval the entire time. However if you take a look at the piece your about to sing for the first time and find out what the lowest note and the highest note are and if there are any accidentals or any out-of-key notes, this will give you a better idea. Luckily most melodies have a lot of scale wise motion and it is rare that you will come across a vocal line that has a lot of large intervallic leaps to it. So you really just have to know what a major scale sounds like and im sure you already are aware of that, and if you just follow the notes and the scale and just read the paper as if your face was an instrument everything should come out just fine. however when the crazy intervals show up then yes in order to successfully get to that note in real time you will have to remember your pracice. Its kind of like trying to tell me what the 12th letter of the alphabet is without going A B C D E... and singing you're way all the way to the 12th letter. You just dont have time to think of scale degrees when those intervals show up. But as you can see, the sight singing portion is a great combination of the 2 and i can promise you that a voice teacher will do great wonders for you that i cant possibly provide. \n\nPs, dont.\n&gt;Hum Softly\nSing like you're balls are gonna get bigger from it when you practice.

Anyways, run attack speed runes for your Q CDR and do W Q W E Q R etc etc. Build wise, I usually build phage into FM like you said, or pick up a wriggles since free wards are OP. after that, you could do a sunfire for constant damage. Shyvana isn't the tankiest of junglers, but with her W damage and Q spam she can put out a lot of damage. \n\nWits end is also really good on her just because attack speed reduces the cooldown on her Q while making her tanky versus mages. This season you might look into a zephyr instead of a wit's end, just because it is good for move speed and Q CDR, as well as stacking with her W.

It'd be hard to quiz yourself but try Quizlet, it's a great website and most Genki sections are already posted. Each class introduces one or two of the grammar things and homework on that topic is due the next class. We also memorize one dialogue from each section. The idea is that if you know the grammar and vocab the dialogue will be easy and fluent sounding.\r\rPractice conjugations regularly after learning them. There is an excellent chart at the end of the book.

{"body": "I appreciate your explanation, but I would like to clarify a few things. \n\nFirst of all, **PARALLEL** keys and **RELATIVE** keys **ARE NOT THE SAME.** By **parallel** key change I believe you mean changing from say C major to C minor. Going from C major to A minor is shifting to the **relative** minor. PARALLEL keys have the SAME TONIC. RELATIVE KEYS DO NOT. \n\n\nContinuing with the example C, C major and C minor are parallels because they both start on C (C being what we call the tonic, or the first scale degree.) The relationship between a MAJOR KEY and its RELATIVE MINOR is as follows:\n\nLet's look at a C major scale.\n\n\nC D E F G A B (C)\n\n\nThe relative minor would be the exact same set of notes, but instead STARTING ON THE 6TH SCALE DEGREE. This means you start with C, count up to the 6th pitch in the scale. Where do you end up? The answer is A. This means that the relative minor of C major is A minor, and the A minor scale is as follows:\n\n\nA B C D E F G (A)\n\n\nYou can use the interval relationships to find minor scales, but I find this method to be much, much easier (and this way you only need to memorize the intervals for the major). You can do this with ANY major scale to find its relative minor. Let's look at an E major scale.\n\n\nE F# G# A B C# D# (E)\n\n\nTo find the relative minor, just identify the 6th scale degree (C# in this case), and rewrite the scale starting from it. That means the relative minor of E major is C# minor, which is as follows:\n\n\nC# D# E F# G# A B (C#)\n\n\nVery simple isn't it? You can reverse the process to find the relative major of a minor scale, just rewrite the scale starting from the third scale degree of the minor scale. In the case of C# minor, the third scale degree, as you should be able to see clearly, is E (surprise), so its relative major is E major.\n\nFrom this explanation you can probably see why modulating to relative minor/major is pretty easy. You are not actually changing any of the pitches used in the scale, rather you are changing the way you USE them. Instead of treating C as the first scale degree, the most stable tone in the scale, you shift it and treat A as the first scale degree instead. The best way to understand what I mean by this is play the C major scale, and then play the A minor scale (which will be the exact same keys except this time starting on A and ending on A). Though you are playing the same set of notes, when you play the A minor scale it should feel like the A is the \"first\" note of the scale rather than C. \n\n\nNow for parallel keys. Since I'm running low on time I'll just give a quick example to demonstrate the relationship between the two (without using the interval explanation).\n\nEssentially a major key's parallel minor is the same key except with the 3rd, 6th, and 7th scale degrees lowered by a half step. Once again, using C major as an example\n\nC major:\n\n\nC D E F G A B (C)\n\n\nLower the 3rd, 6th, and 7th scale degrees by a half step (basically flat them)\n\nC minor:\n\nC D **Eb** F G **Ab Bb** (C)\n\n\nAnd there you have it, you just found the parallel minor of C major. This is also relatively easy to modulate to because your tonic remains the same. \n\n\n\n(source: 2nd year music major)\n\n\n\nFinally I would just like to add: try not to force these key changes. The reason many producers don't change keys within a song, regardless of their knowledge in theory, is simply because there's either no need for it or there's no way for them to modulate into smoothly within the context of their song. Key changes don't sound bad, bad transitions make them sound bad. Think of it like making a mix. Good mixes usually have songs flow into one another smoothly and seamlessly, giving the illusion of the songs being one very long song. A bad mix would be one where transitions are done very poorly. You can clearly hear the last song being cut off and the new one just abruptly jumping in. The person making the mix probably didn't even adjust the levels properly and the new song is almost twice as loud as the last one, nor did he try to use a fade in to make the transition less drastic. Unless you were aiming for a sudden, drastic change, your key changes should not sound like so, just like making a mix. \n\n\n(TL;DR: if you can't make it sound good, don't do it at all)\n\n\nHopefully this helps you guys out and I didn't make any major mistakes while writing this. Learn your theory guys, but don't let it limit you.\n\nEDIT: And yes, I forgot to add that modulating to the relative major/minor is technically NOT A KEY CHANGE as your key signature remains the same. Modulating to parallel keys counts though.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360794014", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My impression from your post and your comments is that you once asked somebody, \"Hey man, how do you improvise?\" And they told you, \"Oh, just use the blues scale of whatever key you're in.\"  While the blues scale can get you going, it's not the secret to soloing, it's only a starting point.\n\nRock/Pop Musicians often have less of a vocabulary to work with.  This doesn't diminish the quality or appeal of their music, they just tend to stick with simple things.  The blues scale is derived from the minor pentatonic scale.  A minor pentatonic is composed of 1 b3 4 5 b7.  In C, for example, we would have C Eb F G Bb.  Add the \"blues note\" to that scale and we get the blues scale or 1 b3 4 **#4** 5 b7 (C Eb F F# G Bb in the key of C for example).\n\nWe also have a major pentatonic scale: 1 2 3 5 6 (C D E G A for example).  I'm spending time talking about pentatonic scales because they are quite useful.  They also happen to fall nicely under the fingers on a guitar and it's something most guitar players pick up on.  Pentatonic scales avoid some of the more dissonant notes of other scales, so you sound like you're playing within the correct key.\n\nWhen you start getting into jazz and advanced improvisation, you learn about how there are often a few scales you can use for each individual chord.  For example, the minor chords you mentioned are often improvised over with the Dorian mode.  There are a couple of ways to explain the Dorian mode:\n\nDorian takes the key signature and the notes of the major scale a whole step below.  That sounds confusing, so let's talk about your Am7 chord.  If we start on A, but use notes from the G major scale (one whole step below A) we get the Dorian mode.  G A B C D E F# G becomes A B C D E F# G A.  Same notes, different starting point.  Another way to think of the Dorian mode is to take a major scale and LOWER the 3rd and 7th scale degree.  For example: A major would be A B **C#** D E F# **G#** A.  We lower the third and seventh and get A B **C** D E F# **G** A.\n\nNow, to address your question of \"Why do notes that sound like they are from F#m7 fit with Am7?\" Let's look at the two Dorian scales side by side.  I'm going to put all the tones that are shared by both scales in bold:\n\n* A   Dorian: **A** **B** C D **E** F# G **A** \n* F# Dorian: F# G# **A** **B** C# D# **E** F#\n\nNow let's throw back in your idea of the blues scale:\n\n* Am7 blues note: D#\n* F#m7 blues note: C\n\nSee how your Am7 blues note is present in F# Dorian and your F#m7 blues note is present in A Dorian?  These two particular chords share a lot of notes that will sound consonant with either chord.\n\nIf any of my explanation interests you, then I encourage you to take jazz/improvisation lessons.  Studying jazz isn't about jazz itself, it's about going from high level \"just playing the notes\" to low level \"how do all of these notes work together and where are they coming from?\"\n\nI've tried to condense years of study into a short Reddit post, so I hope I didn't lose you.

{"body": "The first thing you'll want to know is what is happening exactly. There are multiple levels on which freezing is possible, the major ones being: not waking from ACPI sleep, DE/Xorg/video driver freeze, kernel freeze. Distinguishing between them can be difficult. Since the issues have only been around a month, you're dealing with either a regression in the software or a degeneration of your hardware; either the code is not doing what it's supposed to be doing any more, or your hardware is crapping out on you. Towards determining which category your problems belong to, three questions:\n\n1. When you get a black screen, does the computer appear to be suspended before you touch it - i.e., no spinning harddisks / fans, etc.?  Does it wake up with a black screen?  \n\tIf so, your computer suspends / hibernates after you log out. This might be a separate issue.\n2. When the computer freezes while active, can you still ping it and/or ssh into it? Can you switch to VT with Ctrl+Alt+F1?  \n\tIf it stops working / responding to pings, then it's not just the DE/Xorg/video driver that's freezing.\n3. When the computers freezes while active, can you use SysRq keys?  \n\tFirst enable SysRq key combinations, temporarily with sudo sysctl kernel.sysrq=1 or permanently by adding kernel.sysrq=1 to /etc/sysctl.conf.  \n\tBefore doing other SysRq strokes, do Alt+SysRq+R to hand raw control over to the keyboard. The SysRq key is the same as the PrintScreen key.  \n\tTo kill Xorg using SysRq keys: Alt+SysRq+K.  \n\tTo reboot the entire system using SysRq keys: hold Alt+SysRq, then: E I S U B to do a relatively clean reboot ([obscure not-so-explanatory link](http://fosswire.com/post/2007/09/fix-a-frozen-system-with-the-magic-sysrq-keys/)).\n\nIf the computer doesn't want to wake (fully) from its suspended state as in step 1, you have multiple problems (as the live freeze wouldn't be related). A simple workaround would be to turn off suspension in the Power applet. If suspending worked before, then it is likely you would benefit from using an older kernel (coming up). If you're feeling adventurous and want to get to the bottom of it, try [Ubuntu's Kernel Suspend/Hibernate/Resume Debugging Guide](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelSuspendHibernateResume) and perhaps even [Ubuntu's ACPI Debugging Guide](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingACPI). \n\nIf the computer still responds through ssh / ping / ushare after its display freezes (not through suspension) or responds to the SysRq keys, then your beef lies with the desktop environment / Xorg / the video driver / video card / etc. See your /var/log/Xorg.0.log and [Ubuntu's Display Freeze Troubleshooting Guide](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze) for more information. \n\nIf the hardware is awake but the computer completely unresponsive, then the trouble lies a bit deeper; the system has really crashed. The [Ubuntu System Crash Debugging Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSystemCrash) wants you to run a memory test before supplying them information about the crash in a bug-report. Since you report the problem being new, you should first try to see whether it still occurs with older kernels as well. \n\nTo find out which kernel you were running before the trouble began:\n\n    zgrep \"status installed linux-image-[0-9]\" /var/log/dpkg.log*\n\nYou should get a bunch of lines from when a new version of the kernel was installed, with the version number at the end of each line. Pick the one from the most recent date you're sure you weren't affected. Check whether that version is still installed on your system by hyphenating the first three + the fourth of the version numbers, e.g. 3.5.0.17.19 becomes 3.5.0-17, and using that as such:\n\n    dpkg -l \"linux-image-3.5.0-17*\" | grep ii\n\nIf it comes up empty, you'll need to grab it somewhere - you can try apt-get install linux-image-VERSION-generic but if that fails get back to me on that. If it's there, just follow the instructions at the bottom of the [Ubuntu's Display Freeze Troubleshooting Guide](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze) to select it during boot. If this indeed fixes issues, you can get more information about what's happening by following the [Ubuntu System Crash Debugging Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSystemCrash) and of course checking the logfiles kern.log, messages and syslog in /var/log/ right after a reboot.\n\nIf the older kernel doesn't resolve issues, you can go two ways; step 1 of that Crash Debugging Guide, the memory test, or digging into logfiles.\nFor the logfiles, check kern.log, messages and syslog in /var/log/ right after a freezy-reboot and look for the lines before the reboot. Hopefully it provides a clue.\nMemory errors can create the craziest crashes, so install memcheck86 and reboot into it as you would the older kernel. It will take over an hour to loop through once, and then keep going until you stop it. In my experience if it hasn't found anything after the first run, you're good. \n \nThe downside of not finding a problem at this point is that you're more or less out of options; the only one left is to completely downgrade to the system one month ago, as eloquently put on the Freeze guide: \"If you updated your system and it started to freeze, start reverting package updates backwards until the freezes stop occurring.\".

When someone refers to the third, fifth, octave, or 7th, they are referring to it's position in a scale. The major and minor scales have 8 notes, the being the octave, or the same note. If you start at the root note, the 1, and count up as you go up notes in the scale, those are the intervals. So for a C major chord you look through the C major scale for the notes C D E F G A B, and a major/minor chord is 1,3,5, so here C E G makes up the C major chord. If you play a full bar chord, you are only playing the notes C E G. Now, the main difference is the major third or minor third, because the flat third is what makes the scale minor. If you play through a C minor scale, and count the same way, you will have the 3 notes for a C minor chord. It's often called a perfect fifth because the fifth is the same note for major and minor, the third is what makes the difference.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1360870696", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I guess I should elaborate. The biggest thing I learned from Jazz improv theory class was to use your ear and start with the tonic. The tonic is the root note or for example, the note A from an A major chord. Start with that one note, learn what it is and build around it with OTHER tones from the **A major scale**, if it sounds like shit it is probably diminished (down) or augmented (up) (both dissonant though) in relation to the tonic. There *are* still musical applications for these \"evil\" sounds, example: metal or jazz.\n\n**Think left to right**. In say.. a C major scale, (the easiest to practice theory on b/c there are no sharps or flats) C and B make a major 7th chord because C is the root note and B is the 7th scale degree (**C** d e f g a **B**). Two notes played together *still* form a chord! \n\n\nThe Major 7th chord evokes a mix of happy and sad emotions and can be heard in songs such as \"1979\" by the Smashing Pumpkins.\n\n\n\n**Second** lesson I learned is timing. To build structurally coherent music, jazz improv artists use *1 2 3 4* for everything. They also use *1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and*. Also *1 e and a 2 e and a 3 e and a 4 e and a.*\nIt is basically their mental or vocal metronome they can alter to sound \"swingy\" if they need to.\nIt just taught me to listen, listen, listen. Be vocal about it, that's why you hear jazz artists snapping their fingers and going \"Ba da da Ba da\" \n\n**Melody and rhythm.** Make them your own. That's why people say the keyboard is such a great thing to learn theory with because it can be accessed via your brain, will always be in tune, and maps shit out left to right. I was told you **want to think left to right** (b/c that's how scales operate, be it minor or major) and always challenge your ears to pick out that TONIC, if it's a piano, that root note will be to the left, if it's a guitar it will be on the BOTTOM. (Bass note or index finger)\n\n\nThat's what I got from the class, I hope there aren't any inaccuracies.

{"body": "It sounds like you're stuck in the trap of thinking there is one appropriate scale for each of your backing chords. It's important to realize the less notes your backing chord contains, the more freedom you have in implying flavor over that chord. A simple bassline or pedal tone gives you a lot of freedom. A 7th chord gives you less.\n\nAssume your chord is C Major. You can use lots of different scales over that (not an exhaustive list):\nYour chord tones are C E G.\nYou can use:\n\nIonian: C D E F G A B\n\nLydian: C D E F# G A B\n\nMixolydian: C D E F G A Bb\n\n\n\nWhy does that work? Because your core chord tones (C E G) are still there and you're not implying a different chord if you focus on those tones (by liberal use of arpeggios, accents, landing on downbeats, using passing tones, etc).\n\nThe same goes for your other two chords in the progression. Find a scale that doesn't clash and use it.\n\nHere's an example for 1 - 4 - 5 in C Major.\n\nCEG: Start out with a C Major Pentatonic cliche focusing on C E G, and throw in the 7th (B) for good measure. Your curveball could be alternating between B and Bb (implying Mixolydian, or C7). At some point land on E, G, or B, then play a quick Em arpeggio (since CMaj7 [CEGB] contains Em [EGB]). End it on E and use that as a passing tone down to F (the root of your next chord). Then do some cool shit over F and G.\n\nYour job as a soloist and melody-maker is to come up with something that sounds interesting. That's just as valid as boring the audience with what they expect to hear.\n\nSome other advice:\n\n* Listen to vocalists\n\nThe singer's job is to suck you in and entertain you with their voice and the notes they're singing. You can play any sung melody on guitar, so analyze some and find out why they work.\n\n* Listen to sax, trumpet, and flute players\n\nDo you like Kenny G? Neither do I, but give him a listen. He will smack you in the face with melodies.\n\n* Listen to theme songs and commercial jingles\n\nThey are usually very simple yet engaging. That's the job of the jingle; provide a hook that draws you in.\n\n* Listen to \"shredders\"\nThere's a lot of hate on this subreddit for shredders. Some people think they're \"mindless\" and overly flashy. The good ones incorporate melody into what they're doing, and there's a ridiculous amount of theory behind what's played.

Even the radfemhub files were conducted in a PRIVATE forum. I'll take a nice look at all of the hateful shit the people who populate your organization and build my theory from there, thank you very much :)\n\n&gt;So the whole taboo article and his whole presentation to the US Congress (something he worked on and talked about for a minimum of 9 years) is somehow not enough context?\n\nNope, especially coming from a slanderous femicunt like yourself who probably believes \"1 in 4 women are raped\" and the \"wage gap\".

I'm going to take these biased dipshits about as seriously as you.\n\n&gt;Funny that vocabulary is so important to a person with such limited communication skills.\n\nFunny, I seem to \"communicate\" pretty well with non-feminists.

No rights to own property, to sign contracts, to get a education, to receive proper medical care, to have a bank account, to serve in the military, to be autonomous... \n\nVoting rights = Conscription. Feminists fought for the right to vote and send men into war, but not the responsibility to actually get SENT into war. A very common feminist theme.\n\nNo birthcontrol = What? Since when was birth control illegal in the U.S.?\n\nAbortion = Complicated issue involving when a human becomes a human. Not a \"woman's issue\" like feminists claim it is.\n\nThe other issues revolved around the fact that men were STILL the ones forced to be breadwinners and be forcibly drafted into war so THEY were the deciding factors.\n\n&gt;Yeah all feminism has done is milked women for money.\n\nYup, pretty much. Unlike feminism, the MRM is chalk full of government subsidiaries and governmental aid.\n\n&gt;You should invest in a dictionary. You clearly don't know the meaning of context or literally.\n\nNo, I can read Warren Farrell's works just fine, unlike you.

A whole lot like Mr. Farrell's protest in Canada? How does it make you feel that your little friends protest is the reason why femicunts like you aren't being taken seriously anymore? :)\n\n&gt;Of course I'm not pathologizing you over reddit, but if your ever activisming with your posters near a doctors office it wouldn't hurt if you had yourself checked out.\n\nComing from people who support gender eugenics (radfemhub), I think you should just go straight to the mental ward. Doesn't really matter though, most femicunts like you get married to a barrage of feline's and never procreate your bigotry anyways :)\n\n&gt;It would be sad to see you turn out to be another one of those misters in the mental health statistics you like to use as an excuse for harassing women.\n\nOr those femicunts that slander good people like Mr. Warren Farrell because he disagrees with you and ignore gender-eugenics bigots in your movement. I'd rather be a proud \"mister\" anyday, bitch :) Oh, and if you're so focused on \"equality\", why do you focus so much on \"harrassing women\" so much in your posts? Seems like your significantly more interested in \"Violence Against Women\" than against men. I wonder why that is? :)\n\n&gt;Facts you should try them. \n\nComing from people who believe in disproven sociological conspiracy theories like \"patriarchy\" and \"rape culture\".\n\n&gt;I believe your speaking of the radfemspeak forum http://radfemspeak.net/forum/, which was involved with the agentorange files not radfemhub\n\nNope, it's radfemhub, you ignorant cunt.

You are not interested in men's interests and your sole focus is to shoulder the blame of ALL of societal problems on men. You post actively on a subreddit called \"AGAINST men's rights\", yet you claim to give a shit about men's rights.\n\nOh, and for the communication skills...\n\nHere's a big fuck you to you and your hateful ilk. ,,|,, (-_-) ,,|,,\nYour hate-filled rhetoric won't be lasting much longer and I take personal pride in knowing that I am personally contributing in the demise of your hateful, slanderous institution :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361316581", "subreddit": "OneY", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Fearless By Pink Floyd\n\nI use an open G tuning, but tune the 6th string to a G - like this:  G G D G B D - from here, the chords of the song are all attained via fretting across all frets. This also allows you to hit the sweet sounding harmonics that Dave Gilmour does throughout, as well as the ascending line that plays over G -  only 2 notes on the 5th and 3rd string - the rest open - ascending up the scale.  If you know the song - try it, you'll find the song.\n\nThis is the song that got me to realize I could be a musician.  I was at the Grateful Dead Laguna Seca shows in 1987, walking through the market area. There was a circle of about 10 people, most with guitars, playing Fearless - so I stood around them and joined in on the singing. I watched the guitar players and realized that most of them did not know the song, and that they were watching those who did.  This removed a wall that I didn't know existed - I realized how accessible music was, and that it only took knowing some finger positions, and bam - you're on your way. This was after seeing the Dead about 60 times, Floyd 4 times, and all sorts of bands from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to the Dead Milkmen - and at no time in all those years did I ever see or realize this.  It was the fact that they were just like me which allowed me to think, \"if they can do it, I can do it.\"\n\nThe next week, I bought a guitar - changed my life.\n\ncorrection: fixed the details regarding how to play", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361335941", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As others have said, Hebrew is a Semitic language, part of the Afro-Asiatic family.  I'll try to stay away from discussions of dating the bible's authorship (which are more suited for /r/askhistorians) and focus on the development of Hebrew itself in antiquity.\n\nHebrew specifically is a member of the Canaanite family of languages.  These are characterized mostly by having a particular vowel shift called the Canaanite Vowel Shift, wherein proto-Semitic /a:/ is shifted to /o/.  You can see it in cognates like the word for \"no\", which is /la:/ in Aramaic and Arabic but /lo:/ in Hebrew.  Similarly, the feminine plural ending in Arabic is /a:t/ but /ot/ in Hebrew.  [See here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaanite_vowel_shift).  By the timeframe in which most biblical events are framed, this would've occurred.  So it would definitely be in a Canaanite language of some sort.\n\nOver time, the Canaanite languages diverged.  Hebrew is characterized by certain verbs, particuarly the root עשה, roughly meaning \"to do/make\", which is present only in Hebrew.  It also lost the final -t of feminine nouns, shortening the suffix /-at/ to /a/.  Scholars generally thing the biblical Song of the Sea is roughly from this era.  It's got distinctive Hebrew features, but has lots of vocabulary that was eventually replaced.\n\nThen we get to the sort of Hebrew the bible is written in.  The text has been pretty much static.  Except for phonological changes in how the text is to be read, Samaritan Hebrew and Jewish Hebrew are pretty much identical grammatically.  In terms of vocabulary and grammar, they're fairly similar.  What era this is representative of depends largely on your opinion of biblical authorship.\n\nBut the bible is pretty consistently of that era I mentioned above.  Texts authored by the Deuteronomist (Deuteronomy and the compliation of some narrative texts) are a bit later, but generally have pretty much identical grammar.  While, as I said, dating the bible is contraversial, the range for this sort of Hebrew is usually somewhere between 500 and 1000 BCE, with different portions authored at different points.  So that's the sort of Hebrew that would've been used to author and transmit biblical texts at their earliest date.\n\nThe difficulty is that there probably was phonological change ongoing through this era.  But we just don't know a whole lot about it.  We start to know stuff later on, though, after the biblical era.\n\nSo the development of Hebrew continues.  After the biblical text was written, phonological shifts in Hebrew affected the way the words were pronounced, even if the words themselves were already fixed.  Shifts from the Second Temple Era include the 'ayin-'ghayin merger (which occurred roughly concurrently with the Septuagint's authorship) and the beginning of having allophones for the consonants /b g d k p t/.  The vowel system changed too, but there's a lot of doubt about how it did during this era.  Meanwhile, the sort of Hebrew actually in use to discuss religious matters changed, too.  While it underwent the same phonological changes, its grammar changed too.  Word order began to shift from VSO to a mix of VSO and SVO.  The tense system realigned under Aramaic influence, from having perfect and imperfect aspects to past and future tenses, plus a new present tense, along with conditional/habitual aspects formed with auxiliaries, and an extra future tense.  But that didn't affect the Hebrew of the bible so much.\n\nSo the grammatical paradigms of biblical Hebrew are largely reflective of what was the case when it was probably written.  While some stuff is older than others and there are occasionally notable dialect differences, it's pretty consistent.  The system used to pronounce the words has changed.  The system we really can nail down with some certainty is the Tiberian system.  But there were always probably different dialects of liturgical Hebrew, which eventually were used to develop the phonology of Modern Hebrew.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361380183", "subreddit": "linguistics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I can understand these points, and agree with many of them.\nHowever, it's important to remember a few things;\n\ni) /r/MR is made up of many different people, some of whom have clear agendas. Short of becoming SRS and bringing down the Benhammer, I can't see a way of eliminating troublesome posters more than the mods already do. You'll encounter all sorts of opinions, some misogynistic, others self hating. The important thing to remember in my opinion is that MR is meant to be a positive movement. \nIt should always be for men, rather than against women.\n\n The way to deal with opinions you don't agree with is always discourse.\n\nii) You say \"many women feel like we're just hating on them. This is somewhat true, but again, there's more to the story. \nGo to /r/feminism and say some men feel they're just hating on them. You'd rightly get laughed out. MR is about men and for men. There are some great women contributors, but ultimately we shouldn't have to worry about hate when we're seeking equality on specific issues.\n\n On another note, as you're new, are you aware that /r/MR and the men's rights movement as a whole is often the subject of propaganda? On reddit take the c o n s t a n t posting of the lie that /r/MR is listed as a hate group by the SPLC - despite the fact that the institution itself  has since denied it unequivocally? In the greater movement, take girlwriteswhat (again, an online example, but I'm Australian so real life one's don't really work with mostly Yanks) being described as a hatemonger, with false reports leading to her being banned from youtube if I recall correctly? It's not just a black and white issue is what I'm getting at.\n\n It's very hard to gauge what is honest public opinion to be honest. I agree that anti-woman speech and attitudes here can be prevalent at times, and that adds to this issue. For both that and the fact that this should be a movement of positivity not negativity we need to eradicate that issue. But I can empathise with the guys. These are the men who need MR, who have been fucked over in custody or divorce cases. They're raw about it and they have every right to be. But they need to consider how their actions affect the movement as a whole. I don't often feel comfortable telling them, because my interest in MR is fuelled by academic readings rather than personal experiences. I've never experienced serious discrimination/injustice (just a bit of pedo-shaming for hanging out with my much younger sister) so I don't feel it's my place to thought-police them. Maybe a statement by the mods about general tone? I don't know though.\n\niii) This isn't a point you made, but it's in the spirit of your post. I see a lot of posts regarding female offenders receiving light/suspended/no sentences. On the face of it these can often seem to be MR issues. However, there are many factors that can influence sentencing and these are often overlooked here on MR in favour of gender.\nIt derides from the shocking nature of the true unjust sentence when we force these into the same hole. Worse, it makes us look as if we are wearing blinkers of hate to the outside world. Before posting a MR issue, stop and think - what are the mitigating factors of the case other than gender? Age, mental set and intoxication are three that are often involved. Just something that bothers me as a law student.\n\nAnyway, I've been here a while, mostly as a lurker because as I said I agree with most posts and posters on Men's Rights but there are some unsavoury ones as well. It is a positive space once you take the time to examine it however. It is hard to manage this many people remember, especially with agendas/trolls etc in the mix.\n\nWhat actions would you like to see to spread your points to the subreddit at large? ie, criticism should always come with constructive points as my mother would say.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361431616", "subreddit": "MensRightsMeta", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Actually, there is a direct link between your level of intelligence and illicit drug use.\n\nIf I remember rightly...\n\n* People with *very low* intelligence have a **low** chance of drug use.\n\n* People with *below average* intelligence have a **high** chance of drug use.\n\n* People with *average* intelligence have a **low** chance of drug use.\n\n* People with *above average* intelligence have a **high** chance of drug use.\n\n* People with *very high* intelligence have an **extremely low** chance of drug use.\n\nIt seems weird that it would have an A B A B A sort of distribution but if you think about it, it makes sense. \n\nPeople with very low intelligence (people bordering on, or people who have mental disabilities) are unlikely to fully understand the concept of drug use and not be intelligent enough to go and get illegal drugs (let alone evade the authorities). They may simply take as fact that \"drugs r bad\" the way a small child does.\n\nPeople with below average intelligence are more likely to be reckless (especially when young) and not fully comprehend the dangers of drug use - only understanding that it makes them feel good, yet they are intelligent enough to acquire the drugs they desire and generally evade detection, not caring much about the law either way.\n\nPeople of average intelligence are intelligent enough to realise that drug use can be very dangerous and tend to be a little less reckless, but are usually not intelligent enough to challenge the status quo or find out for themselves how to use drugs responsibly (at least not without help). So they have a low rate of drug use.\n\nPeople with above average intelligence are smart enough to realise that drug laws are stupid and that the risks of drug use can be minimized, or arrogant enough to think that they can evade the law. They are more likely to be intellectually curious about drugs and may suffer more from boredom which can lead to drug use as entertainment.\n\nPeople with very high intelligence are more likely to be concerned with academic matters, or decide that drug use is not worth the risk when they can get mental stimulation from studying. Obviously there are exceptions like Carl Sagan or Shulgin or Freud, but as a generally rule these people are just not that interested.\n\nI would like to think that I'm in the \"above average\" category. Last time I took an IQ test it was 127, which is high but not super duper high. Though I suppose IQ isn't really a whole measure of intelligence and has pretty severe limitations so take that with a bucket of salt.\n\nHere is a quick Google. There's been a decent amount of study done on this topic: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=intelligence+and+drug+use\n\nEdit: So it appears I didn't remember exactly rightly, lol. According to a psychology today article, the distribution is **A A B B A** where A is less likely and B is more likely to use drugs; from left to right less intelligent to more intelligent.

{"body": "me and this girl friend of mine (in this case actual *friend*, not lover) were asked to go to another friend's cousin's(?) wedding reception.  she was more of an acquaintance really and we both thought she was kind of a tightly wound selfish bitch, but we tolerated her.  to this day, i'm not entirely sure why we were invited. \n\nbecause it was an open bar, we were all over that like stink on shit!  so an hour or so into the reception, me and my hom-girl are getting pretty shit-faced. we're sitting at a round table next to the dance floor.  we're seated with a variety of people, both older and young, but all were over 18.  they were pretty tight assed too.  you know they type \"*oh yes, of course!  well we used to summer there, but found that we simply didn't have the time after we purchased the yacht*\"\n\ni used to have this trick where I took an ice cube, leaned my head back and would 'spit' it into the air, then catch it in my mouth on the way back down again.  i was pretty good at it and did the party trick a couple of times at the table we were at.  my gfriend loved it and wanted to try it.  she was pretty cool and uninhibited to begin with so she just jumped right in.  at some point she spit an ice cube up in the air and I caught it in my mouth.  so we started spitting ice cubes at each other and trying to catch them in each others mouths, laughing and having fun.  and getting more and more pissed...\n\nwell at some point one of us complains that there was more spit than cube i their last effort, and so we basically did a wet, sloppy cube-spit at the other in retaliation (obviously intentional).  this degrades over the next few minutes to basically us, squared off in our chairs a few feet apart, spitting and squirting water in each others face and trying to catch it in each others mouths.  at some point i recall we were just basically spitting in each others face.  the whole time we're drunk and just laughing hysterically to the point where we're trying to spit and instead, laughing so hard snot is blowing out our nose and the whole thing is just snowballing into a ridiculous laughing fit where we're trying out best to each take our turn next but failing miserably and slopping spit, water, ice cubes, and snot on each others faces, missing our mouths completely...  the hilarity still makes me laugh.   but at some drunken point where our humour ebbs a wee bit we stop and look around us...\n\n...the music was still playing, but everyone at the table, and surrounding tables and about a dozen people on the dance floor had all stopped and were just standing staring at us like the news had just announced a war declaration.  clearly in their faces, *d i s g u s t e d* with our behavior.   bunch of tight-wads all just aghast at us!  i looked over at my gfriend and she was *soaked* with spit, water, snot and whatever.  she looked like she just climbed out of a pool.  apparently i did too.  stained with streaks of colour from the mix of our drink and who knows what else.\n\ni remember, foggily, looking at each other and with subdued humour realizing what we had been doing - AND WHERE!  we both decided - screw it, let's get another drink.  and got up and walked over to the bar.  at that point people turned away from our spectacle and went back to their night (clearly thinking 'who the fuck brought those two idiots and i hope they never breed!').  we ordered a couple more drinks, finished them, then walked out of the place, caught a cab and went back to her place and just passed out.\n\nmy stomach ached the next day from laughing so hard that night.\n\nthe girl that invited us.  NEVER spoke to us again.  although we heard through the grapevine that in her opinion we had 'ruined' that tight-assed BORING wedding reception.  i doubt it was that dramatic - but it was a great night!\n\ni do recall that the bride was one of the stunned faces staring at us in disgust which likely left an awful impression on her wedding night.\n\nnot so bad, but it is/was a cherished night of hilarity with a good friend who, strangely always seemed to understand my warped sense of humour and went along with it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361450930", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Against AD: MS quint, red mpen, yellow armor, mana/lvl blue. Against AP: MS quint, red mpen, mana/lvl yellow, MR blue\n\n**Summoners:** Teleport &amp; Flash\n\n**Starting:** Faerie Charm, 4 hp pots, 2 mana pots, 1 sight ward (you can also start flask w/ 2 hp, 1 mana pots or 1 hp pot and a ward)\n\n**Item Build:** \n\nGet your tear asap, or at least before the jungler gives you the blue buff. You can start to spam abilities once you have them. After that you can ignore boots and rush a catalyst (I recommend to buy a ruby crystal first) because you will have 367 MS without boots so it's okay till ~ 10 mins. Get sorcerer's shoes, or mercury treads if the enemy have a lot of CC. Rush ROA and after that if you are superfed, you can buy another one also. If not, and the adc is fed get glacial shroud and buy maramune from your tear, and upgrade the glacial shroud to frozen heart. **(If the enemy have a big burst and they're focusing you always, upgrade the tear to archangel's staff because seraph's embrace will give you a huge shield to survive)**\n\n**You need to get some survivability,** so you can buy banshee's/rylai's/warmog's it all depends on you. (I prefer to buy a banshee then a rylai's)\n\n**If you chose the maramune build,** and you got your muramana from it and you think that the game will extend you can start to stack up another tear, and then buy a banshee's/rylai's/warmog's. Depends on the cc your team got (if you don't have too much get rylai), or how your AP opponent did(get banshee's).\n\n**Tips:**\n\n**So about the teleport:** don't use it to get back to lane. NEVER. It's just a waste of a summoner spell, if you know from yourself that you use teleport like that, take ignite instead. So why I prefer teleport? Against a high potential jungler it's a perfect choice or a roamer midlaner (IE: kha'zix, ahri, tf) you can countergank with it or help lanes, even secure kills. \n\n**How to gank botlane w/ tp:** use pings like hell, otherwise your botlane likely won't react. Try to teleport on a laneward in the bush on the further side. Use teleport whenever the enemy lane is pushing and they're at tower, and if you see that your mid opponent is missing back off after the gank, let it waste its time.\n\n**Other tips:** \n\nUse smartcast. You have to smash your keyboard but pay attention on your combo. Always use Q first (when you want to catch someone, or your jungle ganks W first ofc then Q) and then W E then you can use your Q again. It's a simple combo. However if you have blue buff, you will have enough CDR to use Q W Q E Q R Q combo which can be a kill for you if not, you can follow up easily with the MS bonus that your ulti gives\n\nApologies for grammar mistakes, I hope you like the post, comment or PM me if something is not clear\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/19413781", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361457847", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's been a pet frustration of mine that musical genres completely ignore chord progressions as a descriptor.\n\nAnyways, that radiohead song is too complicated for a clear analysis without using a bunch of music theory. Sorry.\n\nThe unicorn's song uses a bunch of chromatic passing tones.\n\nFor Timber Timbre, it isn't really a chord progression so much as a harmonic-minor bassline. Using harmonic minor well could be an instance of this style you're thinking of. But I suspect it's something larger...\n\nAlright, it seems like what you're looking for is chromaticism. Assuming you know what a minor scale or a major scale is, chromaticism is when you use notes that don't belong in that scale. So in the key of A minor, you might play A B C D E. Now, if you want to add a chromatic note, then you could play A B C D D# E. That D# \"leads\" into the E. The general treatment of that D# in the context of A minor is to in fact have it always eventually lead to the E.\n\nHere's another example: Play A B C B A. Now play A B C B Bb A. That Bb wants to go down to that A. It also sounds dark when it's doing that. The general treatment of chromatic notes is to only play them when they're going to another note next to them. If you play that Bb in isolation during a song in A minor it's going to sound \"wrong\". But if you treat it correctly it will add an extra amount of depth.\n\nIn the context of chords, entire chords can be chromatic. In that radiohead song, for example, the opening 3 chords are A minor, F# major, and E minor. A minor to E minor is very common. But that F# could be interpreted as a chromatic passing chord to the E minor (some people might say this song is in a different mode, but then you'd have to explain later chords like the Fmajor). \n\nSo in other words, you could possibly generate this sound you like by finding two chords that go well together and you understand, and then adding a chromatic chord (that shouldn't belong) between them and seeing if it works for you. There are less experimental ways of generating good chromatic chords, but if you don't know music theory then trial and error would be best.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361481500", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I always thought of it like this: the first interval in the harmonic series other than the octave is the perfect fifth. If you stack perfect fifths (a 2nd harmonic of a 2nd harmonic of a 2nd harmonic type deal) 5 times, you get all the notes you need for the pentatonic scale. 7 times and you get the same for the major scale. \n\nIf you take those notes in order (i'll use FCGDAEB), start on C and count by two, wrapping around the sequence until you've collected 7 notes total, you get C D E F G A B, aka the C major ionian scale. If you start on F, which makes more sense to me, you get the F lydian scale, which is a main point of the [Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_Chromatic_Concept_of_Tonal_Organization).\n\nSo it's a way to derive all common scales using the harmonic series at least.  In my opinion it sheds a little light on chord functions, such as why the fourth and the fifth are some of the most commonly used chords. They are the closest, harmonically, to the tonic. I don't have much of an argument for that part other than my intuition though. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361509443", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Personally Varus is one of my favorite adcs simply because he's great at poking, amazing ultimate.  he can be aggressive or passive in lane and still do well.  His play style is actually extremely similar to Miss Fortunes if you're a fan of her.  There are many guides out there, play styles, advice from everybody will give you something different.  \n\nMy personal preference is to go w e q q q r.  and from there go r &gt; q &gt; e &gt; w.  start with W early because of the extra damage.  combined with a dorans or long sword early you can poke REALLY hard level 1.  makes last hitting easier too of course.  I go E level 2 for defensive reasons.  it helps a ton if you have somebody like Leona, her engage combined with your undodgeable anti heal.  From there you have your presence so you want to focus your poke.  I also like holding off on learning Q too early because of the aoe lane push that is almost guaranteed to happen with it.  People will normally go the standard adc build on him, depending on how well you're doing that might be the best option.  Something i've been trying with him, and has actually been working out pretty well is to do a teemo like build because of his W.  a blood thirster, frozen mallet and ruunans.  3 quick shots aoe shots, and a spell pops your passive on over half their team.  Its an interesting concept i'd like to play more with.\n\nLike I said earlier, he can be aggressive or defensive and do well in either situation where as vayne or ashe typically have to play it safe and graves usually goes balls deep.  he does well with Sorakas infinite mana, he does well with blitzcranks awesome engage.  Team fights you obey standard adc rules, only attack whatever is safe for you to attack.  NEVER put yourself in a position where you might get caught and die.  Save your ult primarily for defensive purposes if somebody on their team tends to be focusing you, ult them, back up, E them, and blap blap kite.  dont ever fully charge your Q in a team fight.  the time spent charging it is not worth the auto attacks you wont be doing in the mean time.  its great for over the wall snipes and for popping your W stacks, but more often than not a full charge once the team fight has started is not worth it.  If you have anything more specific i can try to help you there.  situational moves and what not?\n\nedit: I said blood thirster, I meant blade of the ruined king.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361581038", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ah - in that case, what you're playing is the F# [natural minor scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_minor_scale#Natural_minor_scale), also known as the [aeolian mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_mode). Modes are a very complex subject with lots of interpretations/formulations, but I'll give you the quick rundown of what they are.\n\nSo, every scale is basically a series of half steps and whole steps, right? That's what makes C D E F G A B C sound like the \"same\" scale as A B C# D E F# G# A. The space between the first two notes is a whole step, then another whole step, then a half step, and so on. The \"modes\" are just another bunch of scales, but you get them by taking the major scale sequence of whole and half steps and shifting it over by one. So, the major scale is WWHWWWH. By starting on the sixth note of a major scale, you get WHWWHWW - that's the scale you're playing. You could start on, say, the third note, and then you would get HWWWHWW.\n\nObviously, all these H's and W's are really unwieldy, which is why all the modes have names. Here are the names for the modes of the major scale:\n\n|Start on this note|Name of the mode.\n|:------------------|:------------\n|1|Ionian (aka the major scale)\n|2|Dorian\n|3|Phrygian\n|4|Lydian\n|5|Mixolydian\n|6|Aeolian (aka natural minor, the one you were playing)\n|7|Locrian\n\nNow that's where the modes *come* from, but ultimately the most musically useful way to think about them (imo) is as alterations of the normal major and minor scales. In each case except Locrian, there's only one different note, and that note is what gives each mode its unique flavor. In other words, using that characteristic note a lot in your playing or composing is a good way to get the \"feeling\" of a certain mode. So, from that POV, here are the modes:\n\nLydian: Major with raised 4th\nMixolydian: Major with lowered 7th\nDorian: Minor with raised 6th\nPhrygian: Minor with lowered 2nd\n\n(Locrian: Minor with lowered 2nd and 5th, or Phrygian with lowered 5th)\n\nI hope that was helpful! Modes are an enormous can of worms, hopefully this gives you an idea of what people are talking about when they talk about modes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361585945", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First, you're extremely biased in your argument. I didn't say her ult was for good engage. It is an amazing cleanup ability, and if anyone survives a teamfight and is running for their life, they won't make it far against a Quinn. \n\nSecond, Jayce is a decent ADC, he is played more often than you think.  Quinn, however, is a better one. How about this: go try her on the PBE, then come back with all your blindly stated arguments.\n\nIts not just good engage, gapclosing, insane ms, execution, blah blah blah. She has meh AA range. So does Vayne. So does Graves. So does MF. Big deal.  Her passive is very strong: a free nuke on the enemy when it targets them, followed up by a great AS steroid. Her E is VERY strong, probably the strongest disengage of all ADCs (It slows the target by 70% in addition to flinging you away from them, and is usable on minions/monsters as well).  Her Q is V E R Y strong. AOE blind skillshot. Trading is easy. And her W is also strong, not lacking in the least.\n\nHer ULT, which you seem to disapprove of so highly. Lets see, where to begin.  Let's say your jungler ganks. You have to close the distance on their ADC. You ult. You E. They're slowed. You blind them. You either continue to damage them, then 2nd ult to kill. Or you 2nd ult immediately and continue destroying them from range.\n\nLets say the enemy jungler ganks. If he somehow gets into range of you, you E off of him. If this isn't enough and you're getting caught over extending. You can ULT and enjoy 20%-80% extra movement speed as you dash away.\n\nThere are infinite scenarios to use this skillset.

{"body": "Thank you for your contribution, but I disagree with your modal analysis of several of these songs.  Others are fine, but I'm gonna redo your analysis, and use correct notation too, so that you get a feel for it.\n\nUse the roman numerals over the Arabic (Nashville) because it's way easier to distinguish major and minors by way of capital letters (v versus V).  Plus it leaves your Arabic numerals free to differentiate the difference between VII, vii, VII7, etc.\n\n* Pixies - Where is My Mind? E C#m G# A / I vi III IV - (E Major)  *The G# major is an accidental.  When you have a consistent accidental in the chord progression, it's no longer modal.*\n\n* Libertines - Music When the Lights Go Out / C CMaj7 Am Dm7 G / I I7 vi ii7 V - (C Ionian) *This analysis is correct.*\n\n* Libertines - You're My Waterloo / C E Am F E / III V i VI V (A harmonic minor) *You can actually tell to listen to this that, although yes it starts on C, the actual tonic is Am. Another clue is that the E is major, which is indicative of a minor tonic.*\n\n* Smiths - I Won't Share You / G Am C D7 / I ii IV V7 - (G Ionian) *Yup.*\n\n* Smiths - This Charming Man / G D Am C D / I V ii IV V - (G Ionian) - (Capo 2nd fret for original key of A) *This analysis is correct.*\n\n* Kasabian - Where Did All the Love Go? / G#m B E C#m / i III VI iv - (G# Aeolian) *As is this.  Note the lack of dominant chord (D# or D#m).*\n\n* Libertines - Last Post on the Bugle / Gm F Bb D / i VII III V - (G minor) *Sorry, but this is not in Dorian mode. It's minor.  Dorian would have a major sixth (in this case, E natural) but that doesn't even show up as a chord member.  Also, the dominant chord (D) is major.  This song is in Gm. On a side note, A# is not a member of the Gm scale.  The reason sharps and flats exist is because each key/mode has one note of each letter.  G minor doesn't go \"G, A, A#, C, D, D#, F\" but \"G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F\".*\n\n* White Stripes - Fell in Love With a Girl / B A D E / II I IV V (A Major) - *this song doesn't really obey the standard model of music theory.*\n\n* Libertines - Don't Look Back into the Sun / G D Em D C D / I V vi IV V IV - (G Ionian) *This is correct.*\n\n* Libertines - What a Waster / Am D G Em / i IV VII v - (A Dorian) *Yes, this is Dorian mode.  Major IV, minor v.*\n\n* Oasis - Don't Look Back In Anger / C G Am E F G C / I V vi III IV V I - (C Major) *The III (E) is accidental; one could argue that it's a key change to Am or that the entire piece is Am but this song sounds like it's in C.  But, with the III, it's not Ionian mode anymore.  It's major.*\n\n* Babyshambles - Killamangiro / G B7 C D / I III7 IV V (G major) *Once again with the accidental, it's not modal anymore.  On a side note, I had never heard this band before.  This is awesome.  Thank you for turning me on to Babyshambles!  I'll be listening to more of this group.*\n\n* Kasabian - Thick as Thieves / Em Am G B / i iv III V - (E Minor) *With a major V, it's not Aeolian mode, it's harmonic minor.*\n\n* Coldplay - Viva La Vida / (Intro) C D G Em / VI VII III i - (E Minor/Aeolian) *You can tell to listen to this song that the Em is tonic.*\n\nDon't take this criticism personally; it's only meant for you to grow.  You put forth quite a bit of effort and I don't want your efforts to seem unappreciated - they're not.  You incited a healthy discussion and this is good.  It's just that, if you're gonna know what you're talking about, it helps to know what you're talking about! :)\n\nAlso, if anyone notices any errors in my analysis, please don't hesitate to correct me.\n\nCheers!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361750612", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 37, "controversiality": 0}

Some of the civilians and FSA members feared the strict religious views of al-Nusra and their willingness to impose sharia law. One of FSA commanders reportedly said \"We'll fight them on day two after Assad falls\", while stopping military cooperation with al-Nusra. He also accused jihadist of robbing factories and other state property, and selling scavenged parts to obtain money for themselves. Others reported that al-Nusra members had demanded young girls as brides in exchange of their work as fighters, and also had destroyed graves on local cemeteries because of \"being to pretentious for Islamic \ntraditions\".[197]\n\nAll quotes are from Wikipedia. My concern is that I have a good friend who is an avid pro-Assad Syrian. Now he doesn't necessarily agree with many of Assad's actions but he defends his position by indicating the he would choose, what he believes is the lesser evil. Now, I wouldn't be in agreement with him if he wasn't correct about his previous claims that the rebels are foreign thugs, right at the beginning of the whole situation. He even agreed with the initial protests against Assad, and disagreed with how Assad dealt with them. Although, he makes a valid point about how it is not worth destroying the country to oust Assad.

{"body": "Hey man, was just trolling. Don't take it personally it's the Internet. \n\nAnother thing: Most people do what they're good at and scoff at things they cannot do YET. This is the difference between a musician and a guitar player. \n\nAnd modes my friend are very easy. I tried for so long to understand before It clicked (actually I got a teacher at that point). The most important scale is the MAJOR scale!!!!!\n\nYou see a mode is nothing more then the major scale played on a different root (tonic). \n\nNow before you say \"I don't know any of that humph\" I promise you do. The natural minor scale (and more known, the pentatonic) is the major scale played on the 6th note of the seven in the scale. \n\nSo lets say you know \"A minor\" pentatonic. Ok great. Lets think in the key of C major to keep it easy. The notes in C major are: C d e F G a b (yes they are lower and uppercase for a reason) see how \"a\" is the sixth? That's because it's the same EXACT notes as \"a minor\" natural minor scale. Yes yes I know it sounds simple. It is!\n\nSo the minor scale is also the aeolian mode of the major scale!!!!! \n\nSo in the C major scale you can pull out d Dorian mode, e Phrygian mode, F Lydian, G mixolydian, a aeolian, and b locrian. They are all the same notes as c major(which is aka c Ionian). All those modes come out of the major scale based on which 1 out of 7 notes you are focused on. \n\nSo if you know the 5 shapes of the major scale then you know how to play these cool modes all over the fretboard. \n\nSo.. Not tryin to be redundant but most people pick two modes and become very good at them. This is very very common. Most people pick Ionian (major) and aeolian(minor) because they are so popular. These modes became so popular that people gave them two names!\n\nSorry for being a dick. Trying to make up for it by explaining this. \n\nPeace brother ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361912724", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Button pro tips (reply with any I forget below):\n\n* If you're on a laptop, Page Up and Page Down scroll up and down in the VAB without a mouse if your touchpad's scoll doesn't work Imine doesn't)\n* ALT + L locks the staging so if you accidentally hit Spacebar, you won't decouple or something. You can tell that the staging is locked by the little light in the bottom-left of the staging UI. If it's red (instead of flashing green), it's locked.\n* Holding ALT in the VAB or the SPH and clicking a part of your ship will copy it. Say you want to copy SRBs around your ship: make sure you attach any struts to the SRB *then* to the rest of the ship so that when you copy them, the struts get copied over too.\n* Ctrl + Z = undo, CTRL + Y = redo in the VAB and SPH.\n* Right-clicking the symmetry icon makes it cycle backwards through the options\n* A thing I like to do: bind your mobility ladders to one key using Action Groups so you don't have to right-click every ladder when you EVA from a big ship.\n* More well-known: hit CAPSLOCK for fine tuned controls\n* Holding ALT then pressing . or , lets you do physical time warp in space, meaning reduced burn times at the cost of structural integrity (i.e. wobbliness). Although BE CAREFUL with this. Don't hold ALT while pressing W A S D Q or E. See the next point for why:\n* Holding ALT then pressing (or holding) W A S D Q or E lets you adjust the trim in those directions. Spaceplane's nose keep dipping down? ALT + S a btit to trim it up :)\n*Holding ALT then right-clicking lets you select multiple right-click-able things on your ship. Right click one fuel tank, then ALT and right-click another one to bring up the fuel transfer option. Physical time warp speeds up fuel transfer, although if you switch between time warps while transferring fuel it stops the transfer (this didn't happen in 0.18.2).\n* Hold SHIFT to make your Kerbals run when the gravity is sufficient while on EVA. L for lights, R for jetpack (this is well known, I know)\n* F3 brings up the in-flight screen that you get when you end a flight (it pauses the game, don't worry). Useful for if you were wondering what exploded\n\n__________________\n\nMy own favourite non-button pro tip:\n\nIf you have SRBs on your launch stage radially attached, put fuel tanks on top of them and feed them into your main rocket engines with fuel lines. This works best for larger rockets and is a bit awkward with asparagus staging but is handy for efficiency as you're then carrying an extra few fuel tanks but not their dead weight once they're dry (at least not for long if you set it up right)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361921827", "subreddit": "KerbalSpaceProgram", "score": 33, "controversiality": 0}

This is also referred to as the \"H chord\".\n\n[edit: this is where we get the term \"subdominant\" as well!]\n\n&gt; The theory of supposition was adopted and modified by Roussier, Marpurg, and other theorists. A. F. C. Kollmann, following Kirnberger, adopted a simpler approach and one closer to that prevalent today, in which Rameau's \"supposed\" bass is considered the fundamental and the 9th and 11th are regarded as transient notes inessential to the structure of the chord.[5] Thus F A C E G B is considered a seventh chord on F, F A C E, with G and B being nonchord tones added above triadically.\n\nAnd IIRC the simple Bach prelude in C has some wild harmonies in there as well\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361927493", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

I just can't quite wrap my head around this.\n\nYes, the expected number of heads and tails is 50, if you repeated your experiment millions of times and took the average number of head/tails you'd get something close to 50. You must see, that it's still entirely possible to get 100 heads (or tails). The most likely thing to get though is 50 heads and 50 tails. Slightly less likely is getting 51 heads/tails and 49 tails/heads. And so on. You expect 50 heads/tails because the two are equally likely. This experiment can be described by the binomial distribution. \n\nObviously, the coin doesn't remember the past, so why do you think that it will somehow compensate if it has rolled many heads?\n\nEDIT: Spelling and grammar", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1361995488", "subreddit": "statistics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Looks less random, is less random, or happens less frequently? aaaa can only happen once. Same with bbbb, cccc, or dddd. All other combos can happen much more often.\n\nOne problem here is you're conflating a combination with a sequence (or, more properly in this context, a permutation).\n\nSo while\n\n    a b b b a c c\n\nis the same combination as \n\n    b a c b a c b\n\nthey're different permutations. And when you're talking about random generation, and exams with ordered questions, permutations are what matter.\n\nIn your example, the 10th flip is totally independent of the previous 9. The coin doesn't care that it landed on H nine times in a row. It's just as likely (50/50) to still land H again for the 10th flip. It's memoryless. So looking at the probability of flipping a coin H 10 times in a row on its own starting from no flips is *not* the right way to look at it. You want to look at it as \"what's the probability of flipping a coin on H 10 times in a row *given that I already know the first 9 flips are H*.\" This is a very different question, and the answer is simply 1/2, or even odds, again because the coin doesn't have a memory.\n\nEdit: It's also worth a clarification, now that I'm off work:\n\nYou mention how \"unlikely\" it is to get 10 H in a row. However, the sequence\n\n    H H H H H H H H H T\n\nalso has the *exact same* probability. Any particular sequence of flips you want to write out would have that same probability of appearing (specifically, (1/2)^10 ).\n\nNow, the confusion you have between combinations and permutations is coming up again. Because if you're talking in general about \"sequences with 9 heads and 1 tails\" then you've got 9 other ways to do that, so if you want to know the probability, before you start flipping, of getting a sequence with 9 H and 1 T, then it's 10 x (1/2)^10 (as there are 10 total ways to get that particular combination). But what you're talking about is when you *already know* the first 9 flips.\n\nThink of it like a tree, and each flip is sending you up one branch (either H or T) as the coin lands. Once the first coin lands H, you cut off the entire part of the tree that branched from T.

Let event A be the event that box 1 is empty, B be the event that box 2 is empty, etc. What you're looking for is the probability P(A U B U C U ...) where U is the sign for union. Looking at the page [here](http://statistics.about.com/od/Formulas/a/Probability-Of-The-Union-Of-Three-Or-More-Sets.htm), we find the probability of such a union is \n\nP(union) = (sum of probabilities of each event) - (sum of probabilities of all possible intersections of pairs of events) + (sum of probabilities of all possible intersections of triplets of events) - ...\n\nIn this case each of those is easy to find. The number of permutations for which a single box is never filled is (k-1)^n. The number of permutations for which two boxes never occur is (k-2)^n. The number of possible pairs of k events is (k choose 2), triplets is (k choose 3), etc. Therefore, the final sum is \n\nP(A U B U C ...) = (1/k^(n)) * sum(i = 1 to k-1) (-1)^(1+i) (k choose i)(k-i)^n\n\nAnd the probability of the original event you are looking for is 1 minus that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362085914", "subreddit": "learnmath", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
