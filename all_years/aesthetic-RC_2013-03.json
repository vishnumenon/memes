Don't you think it would be confusing if I'm talking about a cup, and he's talking about a supreme being with divine powers who created the universe?\nIt's the exact same trick you're doing. You're talking about a regular guy who had followers and preached and shit. Everyone else, is talking about a guy who does miracles and suspends the laws of physics at will.\nIn my cup analogy, I'm fine with asserting that 'god'(the cup) exists, but I'm not fine with asserting \"God\" the creator of the unverse type supreme being exists.\nThe same way, I'm fine with asserting that your 'jesus' existed. But once you attach the miraculous attributes to 'jesus', that everybody is really asserting when talking about him, I no longer agree he existed. And if you want to maintain, that you are talking about the non-miraculous jesus, then the discussion is over.

It can be attributed to not paying attention to what you're doing (after becoming confident in what you're playing to the extent that you rely on muscle memory to do your work for you), not practicing enough, or just genuinely not knowing the parts. The third, I think, is the worst. Because it's not like you can fake it or anything. I once filled in for a band that's relatively accomplished 'round these parts, due to me being friends with the current drummer and the guitarist, and me listening to their music on a regular basis. I feel pretty confident in myself after listening to a song a couple of times that I can map out the drum structures in my head. Well, this instance was a bit different, because my drums were packed up and shipped off to a different state, and I had no practice kit, so I had to rely on sheer memory and repetition alone to play this show and it was in two days. For two straight days I practiced the set in my head, even going so far as to \"air drumming\" on an invisible kit by myself listening to the songs on headphones. I thought it'd be enough, but boy was I wrong. Night of the show rolled around, and I was feeling pretty nervous since I convinced myself I would be fine but at the same time knowing I'd never physically practiced the songs. The band I'd be playing for was headlining that night so it wasn't like we'd have a chance to rehearse during sound check. We go on, and things start off okay enough, I'm keeping time and none of the other members are turning around to glance at me and give me dirty looks, so it's all well and good. Halfway through the set my carpel tunnel kicks in, my fingers go numb and I begin to drop sticks. No big deal, I've dropped sticks before, so I'm solid. The second half of the set was the heaviest, and there are lots of rolling fills. Here's where I start to fuck up big time. There are fills where it's just a driving rudiment, where it's a R R L R L L R L L in 5/4 at a relatively fast tempo, that on top of my carpel tunnel was a nightmare. Eventually I gave up with trying to play the fills verbatim, and just started improvising. My inner drummer didn't like that, but I got some noticeable smirks and giggles from the rest of the members, meaning \"Yeah, we heard you change that part,\" and etc. I kicked myself mentally because of it. After the show the guys thanked me and told me I did a pretty good job, and that they actually liked the changes I made to the songs. I laughed and said I changed it because I couldn't play the fills because I suck. Whatever, it was just one show.\n\ntl;dr - Filled in for drummer. Fucked up fills.

{"body": "I played elise jungle for 22 games in ranked going 10-12 then i gave her up.  My other jungle champions are a combined 65% winrate with no other jungler that i play below 50%.  The reason i say this is to give you some background on me as a player and to point out that i am a \"good\" (gold 1) jungler with a high winrate, but a losing record with elise jungle.\n\nI want her to be good, i REALLY do but the truth of the matter is she is so much better in a lane than in the jungle and there are some junglers out there that are a lot better than her.\n\nYou didn't come here asking to be told not to play a champion you enjoy in a certain role so here is what I learned:\n- On ganks you need to keep an eye on your lane versus the enemy lane.  If your lane lacks hard cc or is having trouble getting into position to land the cc before the gank try starting in spider instead of human, rappel to your target and immediately Q, shift to human and then point blank stun which can buy enough time for the lane to catch up and apply their own cc.  Likewise if your lane can land a cc, it is best to gank in human form saving rappel in reserve to deaggro tower during a dive or chase them after they flash.  \n\n-You are weak... junglers have less gold.  I find that when you build tanky, you don't have enough damage to dive the enemy team and kill a squishy but if you build damage you die instantly before you can kill the squishy.  Try fighting around the edges of the battle using your human form to poke and only engage with spider when your team has isolated an enemy and you can do so safely.  Alternately elise's peel is not unreasonable.  You can drop a stun and some good damage on an enemy who is trying to dive YOUR team and get to your adc or ap, but her peel is conditional on the champion making the dive.  You have a stun for peel and after that stun a bunch of spiderlings and a big fat black widow spider can actually creep block whoever is chasing your adc if you position properly.  Your spiderlings also block skillshots so if the enemy team has a lux/blitz, turn into a spider and SIT ON TOP OF YOUR ADC... he might be confused for a bit but when light binding hits 2 lings instead of setting up a full combo instagib your team will thank you later.\n\nAs for builds, i feel like hunters machete is not amazing for elise.  I prefer to start cloth+5pot and build the cloth into the new seeker's armguard for trololololo hourglass+rappel baits.  The spirit stone upgrade with AP is really lackluster and you need that gold for other things, and turning it into a wriggles is just a waste of gold and ap ratios.\n\nLocket of the iron solari is very strong right now (also can be built from that starting cloth armor).  Haunting guise gives you defense with the damage.  I really want to like rylias but i feel like its too gold inefficient.\n\nAegis/Bullwark is super strong if nobody else on the team is going to buy one... \n\nHere is the trick, just build gold efficient items and support your team.  Elise is kind of good at getting fed, but for my personal opinion you are better off getting your lanes fed and not trying to carry super hard out of the jungle.  Remember YOU ARE NOT A SOLO LANE INFINITE DAMAGE UNKILLABLE MONSTER so you need to jungle her a little different from laning her.  That feeling of being useless is real... welcome to jungling.  If you aren't fed, you will be behind the solo lanes and adc, its a little better in S3 than S2 but its still the truth.\n\nFor skill order i generally go W Q E W \nThen you have to decide to max Q for damage or max W for clear speed/farming.  Make that decision based on how the game is progressing.\n\nI hope this post helps, feel free to ask me any questions I'll do my best to try and help out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362232643", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I heard someone describe college essays this way and it applies perfectly to public speaking. A good speech (or essay) is like a dress. It should be long enough to cover everything but short enough to be interesting.\n\nAs a quick rule of thumb, follow this method:\n1. you tell them what you are going say.\n2. You say it\n3. You tell them what you just said\n \n\nImpromptu speeches are difficult due to their lack of prep time. If you think you are going to be in a position to give one in the future, begin practicing. Watch ppl giving speeches and learn from them (I recommend watching old keynotes of Steve Jobs). Have some info or talking points stored in your head just in case.\n\nMost people struggle with two things when speaking publicly. \n1. Their fear turns their brain off. They forget what they are talking about and begin to ramble. This is a self-perpetuating problem as the more they ramble, the more confused they become making them even less confident. Overcome this by constantly reminding yourself of the point you are currently making. Like the punch line for a joke, everything you say leads to that point. If you have time, write it down (even on your phone. I've given many impromptu talks from my iPhone).\nKnowing your points will help you to stay confident and confidence is everything.\n\nThe 2nd thing ppl struggle with is stopping. Every speech giver had to learn this at some time. Ending a speech never feels natural and ppl almost always feel the need to keep talking to 'fill the space'. This is a trick reporters use everyday to get more information. They are slow to speak to make the other person speak more. When you are the only one speaking, the need to fill the space is almost instinctual.\nCombat this problem with the same method as before. Remember your main points. Only this time, your point is how they all fit together. You summarise and wrap it all up and then you say the magic words...THANK YOU VERY MUCH!\n\nSaying Thanks is the universal signal for \"end of speech - please clap\".\n\nThere are a lot of other nuances to speaking and most require time and practice. Overall, just be yourself, speak s l o w l y and remember to breathe.\n\n(Apologies for any errors...iPhone thumbs)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362243847", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Outside, of course, securing your teaching certificate and going the secondary school route. For museum work, most of the big institutions are requiring degrees in curatorship and archiving and breaking into academia is difficult.

Now, I qualify under the relevant degree or 3-5 years experience.

I was on a tier 2, actually -- with a history degree. Booya. You need to figure out what you want to do. I schmoozed so hard during my masters because I couldn't wait to do my phd and I wanted every qualified professor in the W O R L D to know me when I started applying.

For example G A B C D E F F#\n* Playing chromatically around chord tones (1, 3, 5 mostly). To make those smooth bebop lines, approach chord tones chromatically. You can also encircle chord tones where you play the chord tone, and then one step below and one step above. For example over a D7 chord playing D C# D# D, encircling the root. Or F# F G F#, encircling the third, and so on.\n\nStay simple with the initial ideas, but build on it with the chromatic ideas.

{"body": "I think it's also important to note when to and when to *not* play Jungle Nasus, particularly in regards to your team composition. In LCS, when Diamondprox picks Nasus, you should take note of what his teammates pick. You're not going to see Nasus on a team with Varus, Rumble, and Ryze. Why? Because those champions don't make use of Spirit Fire, one of the most important abilities for Nasus jungle. \n\n\nOne of the best parts about Nasus are his devastating ganks in the mid game. Yes, if your opponents ward very carefully you will have trouble getting off a gank, but if Nasus ever gets between an opposing laner and their turret, they are practically dead. For starters, you have the debilitating Wither getting cast on whichever unfortunate soul got caught. Next--and here's the real kicker--you have Spirit Fire come up underneath the barely moving champion. Then you have a burst of both the laner **and** Nasus's Q smashing them into a pulp. Also, with his ultimate Nasus is great at taking Dragon and Baron if your opponents back off and don't want to fight you.\n\n\nSo you really want a champion who can make use of Nasus's Spirit Fire both in lane ganks and later in team fights. All three times Nasus has been picked, Gambit has been running a very high AD composition. Great champions to go with Jungle Nasus are Renekton, Kha'Zix, Miss Fortune, and--even though no one on Gambit plays him as far as I know--Jayce. Jayce, Renekton, and Kha'Zix all become multitudes more dangerous in lane when a level 9 Nasus can easily slow their opponent and reduce their armor by 40. A sped up Shock Blast on a champion standing on Spirit Fire will almost certainly chunk them for over half, depending on the champions' builds. Miss Fortune becomes great late game because Spirit Fire combos fantastically with her ultimate.\n\n\nIn terms of Skill order, I would recommend E Q E W E R E (then Q if you want to farm or W if you want to gank) E then R &gt; Q &gt; W. That's my personal opinion, having the second level of W at level 8-11 can be great if you think you will be able to gank lanes, but if not just get the Q for the improved CD, farm, and start taking objectives with it. I'm not very experienced with Jungle Nasus, but I used to play a lot of Nasus top and have theorycrafted a lot about it with one of my friends.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362447821", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

In the saving example, saving in MGS takes F O R E V E R(and so does loading), especially when put side by side with games with quicksave/load.

Although Mitzi Gaynor was a \npremier singer and dancer, she never was regarded in the \nsame way as Marilyn. Nevertheless, for a few years in \nthe mid-1950's, both ladies stars shown brightly with \nroles in movies such as \"Some Like It Hot\" and \n\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" for Marilyn and \"South \nPacific\" for Mitzi. \n\nThis incident occurred in 1954 on the set of the movie, \n\"There's No Business Like Show Business.\" Twenty-four \nyear old Mitzi played Katy, a dancer, and twenty-eight \nyear old Marilyn was, \"Vicky\" the hat-check girl who \nfell in love with Donald O'Connor. In 1954 while the \nmovie was being filmed, both women got married although \nMarilyn's brief marriage to baseball star Joe DiMaggio \nsadly ended before the picture was released.\n\nConsequently, both actresses were under considerable \nstress in their private lives in addition to the strain \nof appearing in a big budget movie.\n\nAccording to Hollywood insiders, there was friction on \nthe after Marilyn Monroe was brought in to provide a box \noffice \"boost.\" To convince her to accept the role, the \nstudio promised her the lead in \"The Seven Year Itch\" \nthe next year. To further accommodate her, they gave \nseveral songs that had been written for Ethel Merman to \nMs. Monroe. It didn't endear Marilyn to the other women \nin the picture, especially the aging Merman.\n\nUnfortunately, Marilyn's notorious tardiness only served \nto further aggravate matters. Ethel had been angry with \nMarilyn since she arrived on the set, but was too \n\"professional\" to show it. Instead, she befriended young \nMitzi Gaynor and poisoned the young dancer toward \"that \nslutty blonde.\"\n\nOne day Mitzi Gaynor, already a consummate pro at the \ntender age of 24, was seen going into Marilyn's dressing \nroom for a \"private meeting.\" My description of what \nfollowed is based upon information from several sources, \nmuch of it admittedly unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,\nbut still it makes for a fun read so we wrote a short \nstory about it. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as \nwe enjoyed researching and writing it.\n\n- - - - - - - - \n\nEveryone on the set could see the anger on Mitzi's \npretty face. The auburn-tressed actress was an awesome \nsight in her shiny gold mid-thigh, wrap-around skirt, \ndance tights and tight, low-cut, bolero jacket as she \nstormed out of the rehearsal intending to give Marilyn\na piece of her mind. Mitzi was about 5'6\" and her firm \n120-pound body was that of a well-muscled dancer. While \nnot big by the Hollywood standards of that era, her 34C \nbust, tiny waist and flared hips nevertheless gave the \nillusion of a busty figure. Mitzi's legs were her \noutstanding feature and they would play an important \npart in the events to come.\n\nAs was her habit, Marilyn arrived late to the studio \nthat morning and she was sitting in her dressing room \nholding an ice pack on her face to reduce the puffiness \nfrom a late night of drinking with her husband, his \nbrothers and friends. She'd just asked her maid to get \nher costume when Mitzi burst through the door without \npausing to knock.\n\nMitzi was wearing her little gold dance outfit and high \nheels as she pranced into Marilyn's dressing room as the \nblonde was lazily starting to apply her make up. \nMarilyn, in a rose colored silk robe, black bra and \nmatching panties had her back to the door. She saw \nMitzi's reflection in her mirror, but didn't react to \nher rude intrusion. Mitzi slammed the door behind her \nand stood behind the seated Marilyn, tapping her foot \nimpatiently.\n\nShe started to tell the blonde how rude and \nunprofessional her behavior was, forcing the others to \nwait while she slept in. Marilyn calmly continued \nputting on her make up while Mitzi ranted about her \nbeing self-centered and droned on about it being wrong \nof her to arrive late, leave early and not even show up \nstill other times.\n\nMarilyn listened in stony silence (perhaps knowing much \nof Mitzi's criticism is true). Mitzi, realizing that she \nwasn't getting any reaction, next turned her criticism \non Marilyn's lack of acting talent in addition to her \nlack of professionalism. Much or what she said was \nmerely a repetition of what Mitzi had heard Ethel Merman \nsay, but it stung Marilyn nevertheless. When Mitzi \ngrabbed Marilyn's shoulder and pulled her to her feet, \nhowever, the blonde had finally taken enough abuse.\n\nThen Mitzi said, \"Hell, even if you do show up all you \ndo is try and steal all the scenes. I swear, I've got \nhalf a mind to kick your fat ass right out that door \nonto the stage, you fat cow!\"\n\nMarilyn angrily brushed Mitzi's hand from her shoulder \nand walked quickly to the dressing room door, locked it \nand turned to face Mitzi with her hands on her hips. \n\"All right Sweetie,\" she said in her bitchiest tone, \"If \nyou've come here to make a scene, you've accomplished \nwhat you came for. Now, let's see if you're woman enough \nto back up your words with some action. Let's settle \nthis between us girls once and for all.\" \n\nMitzi suddenly looked concerned at the prospect of being \nlocked in a room with the angry blonde and she quickly \nchanged her tune, mumbling, \"Look, I... well, I didn't \nreally mean to make you mad... It's just that, well, I \nwanted to get you moving. Come on, Marilyn, get on the \nset and let's go to work.\"\n\nMitzi started to edge toward the door, but Marilyn \nsnarled, \"Oh no, sweetheart, you're not getting off that \neasy.\" She shoved Mitzi back and the lithe dancer caught \nher heel in the carpet and fell into Marilyn's chair. \nMitzi realized she'd pushed Marilyn too far and to hide \nher fear she started acting cocky and sure of herself in \nspite of her lack of cat fighting experience. The dancer \nhoped that her physical conditioning, athletic skill and \na large dose of bravado would be enough to bluff her way \nout of Marilyn's dressing room without suffering any \ndamage to either her body or her self-esteem.\n\nUsing brave words to hide her fear, \"If it's a fight you \nwant, you fat sow, then come on. I'll kick that fat ass \nof yours into the middle of next week.\" Marilyn had \nheard that language before and she angrily started for \nMitzi, but the dancer lashed out, slapping her face and \nMarilyn stopped in her tracks, surprised by the woman's \ncourage. Mitzi, herself surprised by her bravado, \nquickly followed up with several more slaps to the \nstartled blonde's face. \n\nShocked by Mitzi's attack, Marilyn grabbed Mitzi's short \nreddish hair and began to push her backwards. Mitzi \nretaliated with two handfuls of Marilyn's blonde hair \nand even added a couple of desperation kicks to the \nactress' shins for good measure.\n\nMarilyn was surprised by the speed and viciousness of \nthe inexperienced dancers attack, perhaps even hurt a \nlittle as well. But Marilyn was an experienced cat \nfighter and she knew where the fight would end by the \namateurish, ineffectual and weak way that Mitzi was \nfighting.\n\nMitzi was shaken by Marilyn's thrust and she gasped in \nsurprise and, buoyed by her apparent early success, \nbroke into a smug grin. \"OK, if that's what you want you \nblonde whore, I'm ready.\" Mitzi unbuttoned her bolero \njacket and tossed it on the studio couch the studio \nprovided for their major stars.

K I M B E R L Y A . L O N S W A Y \nEnd Violence Against Women (EVAW) International Director of Research \n\nand\n\nS G T . J O A N N E\nA R C H A M B A U L T ( R E T . \nJoanne Archambault is the Executive Director of End Violence Against Women International (EVAWI) and the President and Training Director of SATI, Inc. (Sexual Assault Training and Investigations)\n\nand\n\nD R . D A V I D L I S A K\n...a man FAMOUS for his anti male attitude, and Courtroom testimony used to shred the Human Rights of men.\n\nIncidentally, here is the abstract to a report written for SAGE, in which Lisak is involved...\n\n--------------------\n\n\nOne of the most controversial disputes affecting the discourse related to violence against\nwomen is the dispute about the frequency of false allegations of sexual assault. In an effort\nto add clarity to the discourse, published research on false allegations is critiqued, and the\nresults of a new study described. All cases (\nN\n=\n136) of sexual assault reported to a major\nNortheastern university over a 10-year period are analyzed to determine the percentage of\nfalse allegations. Of the 136 cases of sexual assault reported over the 10-year period, 8 (5.9%)\nare coded as false allegations. These results, taken in the context of an examination of\nprevious research, indicate that the prevalence of false allegations is between 2% and 10%.\n\n-----------------\n\nWhich is yet another example of Feminist 'scholarship' being nothing more than citing, and re-citing, biased sources...like the Brownmiller quote...\n\nHere, read this to understand:\n\nOne highly respected legal academic, elected by her peers as president of the prestigious Asso iation of American Law Schools, recently reported that “the overwhelming consensus in . . . research relying on government data is that false reports account for only about 2 percent of rape complaints.”\n9\nIt is indisputably true that, largely through the efforts of legal dominance feminists, there now exists a consensus among legal academics that only two percent of rape complaints are false.\n10\nThis purportedly empirical statement is\nubiquitously repeated in legal literature. Dozens of law review articles reiterate that no more than one in fifty rape complaints is\nfalse.\n11\nThis empirical fact, however, is an ideological fabrication.\n12\n\n\nAs far as can be ascertained,\nno study has ever been published\nwhich sets forth an evidentiary basis for the “two percent false rape\ncomplaint” thesis.\n13\n“Measuring false allegations is all the more dif-\nficult since policies on unfounded crim\ninal complaints differ from\none jurisdiction to another, resu\nlting in very different numbers.”\n14\nThe basic problem with accurately\nascertaining the percentage\nof wrongful accusations is that th\ne overwhelming majority of rape\ncases result in plea barg\nains, a “black box” in\nwhich there is neither \nadversarial process, jury fact-fi\nnding, appellate review, nor even a\nrecord for scholarly analysis.\nThere are numerous reasons why both\ninnocent and guilty defendants accept plea bargains, including avoid-\ning the risks of going to trial.\n15\nThere is thus no firm evidence that\nthe plea bargaining process diffe\nrentiates between innocence and\nguilt any more accurately than tr\nials. Whether by trial or by plea-\nbargaining, roughly half of accu\nsed rapists are convicted.\n16\nEven if\nwe assume\narguendo\nthat all those convicted\nare indeed guilty, and\nthat a full two-thirds of those acquitted at trial were also guilty, we\nwould still wind up with a situation\nin which one-sixth of those actu-\nally tried are really innocent. \n\nMoreover, commencing in 1989 in\ncases of rape and rape-\nmurder where there has already been either an arrest or an indict-\nment, the FBI has conducted large numbers of DNA tests\n19\n“to con-\nfirm or exclude the person. In 25 pe\nrcent of the cases where they can\nget a result, they excluded the primary suspect.”\n20\nAs several of the\nweakest cases have already been screened out, either by the police\ndetermining that the claim is unf\nounded or by the prosecution decid-\ning not to go forward,\n21\nthis fraction may indicate the lower bound-\nary of formal misidentifications of the culprit.\nFurthermore, there is no plausibl\ne reason to believe that almost\nall complaints of rape are true. On the contrary, aside from the lim-\nited probative empirical evidence on\nthe issue, there are a number of\ngood reasons to think that\na significant fraction\nof rape complaints,\nfar in excess of two percent, are fa\nlse. By way of comparison, there\nis an elaborate body of literature\nand numerous exam\nples suggesting\nthat a significant number—way beyond the two percent range—of\ncapital murder convictions are of innocent men.\n22\nWhy should\ncriminal trials involving sexual assaults on women be more accu-\nrately discriminating than those involving capital homicide? If an\nassertion that one out of\nfour or five rape\nclaims is false sounds\ncounterintuitive to the legal academ\nic ear, then this further demon-\nstrates that the two\npercent false claim proposition is now embedded in our commonsense notion of reality.\n23\nThis commonsense notion,\nhowever, does not resolve the un\nderlying empirical question of\nwhether a significant minority of women who bring rape charges do\nso erroneously. \n\nTHE TRUTH BEHIND LEGAL DOMINANCE\nFEMINISM’S “TWO PERCENT FALSE\nRAPE CLAIM” FIGURE\nEdward Greer\nhttp://ncfm.org/libraryfiles/Children/rape/greer.pdf\n\n\nYou show no ACTUAL EVIDENCE, you show feminists agreeing with each other.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362517059", "subreddit": "MensRights", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**(1)**\n\nPlay the white keys on a piano from one C up to the next C: \nC D E F G A B C. \nThis is the C major scale. \n\nNotice that the scale is made up of: a Root (C), Major 2nd (D), Major 3rd (E), Perfect 4th (F), Perfect 5th (G), Major 6th (A), Major 7th B), (and then repeats at C an octave higher). Notice that there's a whole step between each note, except between the 3rd and 4th notes and the 7th and the root (an octave higher).\n\nIn other words, from C (the root) to D is a major 2nd. From C to E is a Major 3rd. From C to F is a Perfect 4th, etc. (If you don't understand this, your first step is to back and review intervals before learning about modes. Musictheory.net is good for this).\n\nThis set of intervals is the structure of any major scale-- it's pretty much the definition of a major scale. (e.g. If we build a major scale on D, it will have the same set of intervals: D is the root, E is the Major 2nd, F# is the Major 3rd, etc.)\n\n*****\n\n**(2)**\n\nNow play the white keys again, this time start with G, playing from G up to G:\nG A B C D E F G.\n\nIf we think of G as the root, and look at what intervals are involved, we get: a root (G), Major 2nd (A), Major 3rd (B), Perfect 4th (C), Perfect 5th (D), Major 6th (E), *MINOR* 7th (F), and the root (G, an octave higher). Compare this with the intervals I listed for the C major scale above.\n\nNotice that this is not a G major scale: a major scale has that specific set of intervals I listed above. This scale has a Minor 7th (F) where the major scale would have a Major 7th (F#). In other words, this scale has a whole-step between the 7th and the root, while a major scale has a half-step.\n\nWe call this scale G Mixolydian. It is a mode of the C major scale, that is, it uses the same set of notes as the C major scale (both scales contain just the white keys). However, it is *not* a C scale. G is our root. \n\nThe fact that this scale is the 5th mode of C major (i.e. built from the 5th note of C major) is just not important for most purposes. What matters is how this compares to **G** major.\n*****\n**(3)**\n\nWe now have the interval structures for two different scales:\nMajor Scale (a.k.a. Ionian):\nRoot, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Maj. 7\n\nMixolydian:\nRoot, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Min 7\n\nLet's pick a random note on the keyboard, let's say Bb, and build a major scale. Following the interval structure listed above, we get:\nBb C D Eb F G *A* Bb\n\nIf we build a mixolydian scale on Bb, we get the following:\nBb C D Eb F G *Ab* Bb\n*****\n**(4)**\n\nChords are built by skipping every other note in a scale.\n\nIf we go back to our C major scale, and build a three note chord (triad) off of the root, we would play the root, skip the 2nd note, play the 3rd, skip the 4th, play the 5th. C, E, and G. Therefore this chord, having a root, major 3rd, and perfect 5th, is a major triad.\n\nWe can build chords off of each note in the scale. If we build a three note chord off of the Second note in C major (D), we would play the 2nd, skip the 3rd, play the 4th, skip the 5th, play the 6th. D, F, and A. While D is the second note of the C major scale, it is the root of this particular chord. while F is the 4th note of the key/scale, it's is the third of this particular chord (If D is our \"1\" then, some kind of E would be \"2\" and some kind of F is \"3\", and so on). However, notice that D to F is not a major third: it is a minor third (D to F# is a major third; F# is not in the key). Therefore, the chord built off of the second note of the scale is a minor triad.\n\nThis is important information because it applies to any major scale: The chord built off of the first note in the scale is major. We can call this the \"one\" chord (labelled roman numeral \"I\"). The chord built off of the second note of a major scale is a minor chord. We can call this the \"two\" chord (labelled roman numeral \"ii\"). We can keep going and build chords off of every degree of the major scale. \n\nThis is what it means to be in a \"key\": we are using a scale as a resource for harmony--the chords are built to conform with the set of pitches in the scales.\n*****\n**(5)**\n\nWe can build chords with more than 3 notes, by continuing to skip notes up the scale. If we take our triad built off of the root of a major scale, (root, third, fifth) and skip the 6th, and add the seventh, we will have a four part chord: a seventh chord, because it contains the seventh. This would be a major seventh chord: a major triad with a major seventh. We can do this on each degree of the scale; each note in the scale will produce a specific chord structure.\n\nIf we wanted to continue with 5 part harmony, from the seventh we can skip the root and add the second. But now, because we are in the second octave of the scale, we will call the root the eighth note, and the second the ninth note. Therefore we can call this 5 part chord a ninth chord. The ninth chord built off of the first degree of the major scale is called a major ninth chord. Of course we can also build 5 part chords off of each of the other notes in the scale.\n\nWe can keep going. If the ninth is the second note in the scale an octave up, the 10th would be the third an octave higher. The four becomes and eleventh and so on. So if we have our 5-part ninth chord, and wanted to add a 6th part, we would skip the tenth and add the eleventh.

{"body": "We are interested in finding the probability that 2 or more women will have twins. In order to do this, we would have to take the probability of 2 women having twins, plus the probability of 3 women having twins, plus the probability of 4 women having twins, and on and on. This is obviously a huge pain. But we know that the Probability of something happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of it not happening. So the probability that 2 or more women have twins, P(≥2) = 1- P(&lt;2) , or 1 minus the probability of having less than 2 twins. \n\nThe probability of having less than 2 twins is the probability of having 1 twin, plus the probability of no twins.\n\nP(&lt;2) = P(0) + P(1)\n\nTherefore,\n\nP(≥2) = 1- P(&lt;2)\n\nP(≥2) = 1- (P(0) + P(1)) \n\n\n\nAll we have to do now is find P(0) and P(1)\n\nLet's start with P(0). In order to have no twins, there must be 10 non-twins. Since the probability of getting a twin is 3.3% = 0.033, the probability of NOT having twins is 1-0.033 = 0.967. If we put in T for a woman having twins, and a N for a woman who doesn't have twins, all ten women having twins would be represented by:\n\nN N N N N N N N N N\n\nWe just plug in the probability of not having twins in for each N and multiply across. So the probability of having all ten be non-twins is 0.967 multiplied to itself 10 times, or (0.967)^10 . Since there is only 1 order in which all 10 women have not twins, or only 1 way to arrange N N N N N N N N N N, we multiply by 1 and the total probability is just (0.967)^10\n\nApplying the binomial theorem:\n\nSo the binomial distribution says that the probability of something happening k times is:\n\nP = nCk (P)^k (1-P)^n-k\n\nn= total number of events = total number of births = 10\n\nk= number of desired events = number twins = 0 \n\nP= probability of desired event = probability of twins = 0.033\n\n1-P = probability of not getting desired event = probability of not twins = 0.967\n\nPlugging into the formula gives us:\n\n10C0 (0.033)^0 (0.967)^10\n\n= 1 (1) (0.967)^10\n\n\nRelating the formula to the method I used before to find it logically, (0.967)^10 represents multiplying the ten non-twin probabilities together, and the 10C0 represents the number of ways to arrange the N's which is 1.\n\n\nTo get the probability of 1 twin, let's start by figuring out the probability of the first woman having twins and the next 9 women not having twins. The arrangement would be:\n\nT N N N N N N N N N \n\nPlugging in the probabilities for T and N gives us:\n\n=(0.033)(0.967)(0.967)(0.967)(0.967)(0.967)(0.967)(0.967)(0.967)(0.967)\n\n= (0.033)(0.967)^9\n\n\nHowever, having the first woman have twins isn't the only way that 1 twin could be born. The second woman could have twins, or the third, etc. The number of different ways to arrange the one T and nine N's is 10C1 = 10\n\nYou can see logically that there are 10 different spots where the T could go. \n\nTherefore we multiply (0.033)(0.967)^9 by 10 to get the total probability.\n\nApplying the formula, we get the same results:\n\nnCk (P)^k (1-P)^n-k\n\n= 10C1 (0.033)^1 (0.967)^9\n\n= 10 (0.033)^1 (0.967)^9\n\n\n\nSo overall, P(0)= (0.967)^10 and P(1)= 10(0.033)(0.967)^9\n\nSo P(≥2) = 1- (P(0) + P(1)) = 1- P(0) - P(1)\n\n= 1- (0.967)^10 - 10(0.033)(0.967)^9 \n\n= 0.041089...\n\n\nSee if you can apply the same method to number 2.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362685745", "subreddit": "HomeworkHelp", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**(1)**\n\nPlay the white keys on a piano from one C up to the next C: \nC D E F G A B C. \nThis is the C major scale. \n\nNotice that the scale is made up of: a Root (C), Major 2nd (D), Major 3rd (E), Perfect 4th (F), Perfect 5th (G), Major 6th (A), Major 7th B), (and then repeats at C an octave higher). Notice that there's a whole step between each note, except between the 3rd and 4th notes and the 7th and the root (an octave higher).\n\nIn other words, from C (the root) to D is a major 2nd. From C to E is a Major 3rd. From C to F is a Perfect 4th, etc. (If you don't understand this, your first step is to back and review intervals before learning about modes. Musictheory.net is good for this).\n\nThis set of intervals is the structure of any major scale-- it's pretty much the definition of a major scale. (e.g. If we build a major scale on D, it will have the same set of intervals: D is the root, E is the Major 2nd, F# is the Major 3rd, etc.)\n\n*****\n\n**(2)**\n\nNow play the white keys again, this time start with G, playing from G up to G:\nG A B C D E F G.\n\nIf we think of G as the root, and look at what intervals are involved, we get: a root (G), Major 2nd (A), Major 3rd (B), Perfect 4th (C), Perfect 5th (D), Major 6th (E), *MINOR* 7th (F), and the root (G, an octave higher). Compare this with the intervals I listed for the C major scale above.\n\nNotice that this is not a G major scale: a major scale has that specific set of intervals I listed above. This scale has a Minor 7th (F) where the major scale would have a Major 7th (F#). In other words, this scale has a whole-step between the 7th and the root, while a major scale has a half-step.\n\nWe call this scale G Mixolydian. It is a mode of the C major scale, that is, it uses the same set of notes as the C major scale (both scales contain just the white keys). However, it is *not* a C scale. G is our root. \n\nThe fact that this scale is the 5th mode of C major (i.e. built from the 5th note of C major) is just not important for most purposes. What matters is how this compares to **G** major.\n*****\n**(3)**\n\nWe now have the interval structures for two different scales:\nMajor Scale (a.k.a. Ionian):\nRoot, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Maj. 7\n\nMixolydian:\nRoot, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Min 7\n\nLet's pick a random note on the keyboard, let's say Bb, and build a major scale. Following the interval structure listed above, we get:\nBb C D Eb F G *A* Bb\n\nIf we build a mixolydian scale on Bb, we get the following:\nBb C D Eb F G *Ab* Bb\n*****\n**(4)**\n\nChords are built by skipping every other note in a scale.\n\nIf we go back to our C major scale, and build a three note chord (triad) off of the root, we would play the root, skip the 2nd note, play the 3rd, skip the 4th, play the 5th. C, E, and G. Therefore this chord, having a root, major 3rd, and perfect 5th, is a major triad.\n\nWe can build chords off of each note in the scale. If we build a three note chord off of the Second note in C major (D), we would play the 2nd, skip the 3rd, play the 4th, skip the 5th, play the 6th. D, F, and A. While D is the second note of the C major scale, it is the root of this particular chord. while F is the 4th note of the key/scale, it's is the third of this particular chord (If D is our \"1\" then, some kind of E would be \"2\" and some kind of F is \"3\", and so on). However, notice that D to F is not a major third: it is a minor third (D to F# is a major third; F# is not in the key). Therefore, the chord built off of the second note of the scale is a minor triad.\n\nThis is important information because it applies to any major scale: The chord built off of the first note in the scale is major. We can call this the \"one\" chord (labelled roman numeral \"I\"). The chord built off of the second note of a major scale is a minor chord. We can call this the \"two\" chord (labelled roman numeral \"ii\"). We can keep going and build chords off of every degree of the major scale. \n\nThis is what it means to be in a \"key\": we are using a scale as a resource for harmony--the chords are built to conform with the set of pitches in the scales.\n*****\n**(5)**\n\nWe can build chords with more than 3 notes, by continuing to skip notes up the scale. If we take our triad built off of the root of a major scale, (root, third, fifth) and skip the 6th, and add the seventh, we will have a four part chord: a seventh chord, because it contains the seventh. This would be a major seventh chord: a major triad with a major seventh. We can do this on each degree of the scale; each note in the scale will produce a specific chord structure.\n\nIf we wanted to continue with 5 part harmony, from the seventh we can skip the root and add the second. But now, because we are in the second octave of the scale, we will call the root the eighth note, and the second the ninth note. Therefore we can call this 5 part chord a ninth chord. The ninth chord built off of the first degree of the major scale is called a major ninth chord. Of course we can also build 5 part chords off of each of the other notes in the scale.\n\nWe can keep going. If the ninth is the second note in the scale an octave up, the 10th would be the third an octave higher. The four becomes and eleventh and so on. So if we have our 5-part ninth chord, and wanted to add a 6th part, we would skip the tenth and add the eleventh. Note that the tenth is already present in the chord in the lower octave, as the third). If we add go one one more to a 7-part chord, from the eleventh we would skip the 12th (the fifth) and add the 13th (which is the 6th in the higher octave). We have now added every note in the scale: the scale only has 7 different notes; if we add another note from the 13th by skipping the 14th (the 7th), we end up at the root two octaves higher, right back where we started.\n\n*(Note that in practice, you usually don't hear extended chords with every note included.

It doesn't exist, it physically CANNOT exist, it's nothing but a thought exercise.\n\nEven then, if you really want to take it that way, there's nothing inherently un-free going on here. Lets look at the chain of coercion here.\n\nThe publisher makes products to fill a demand in the Market, in accordance with the demands of that market. This is pure free enterprise - they make whatever they want, and charge whatever they want, and people are free to buy it or not.\n\nNow we come to the next segment: professors who prescribe books. Great, fine. You can say that THEY are imposing coercion on the market. But are they? That depends really. See, the professor is engaging in free market behaviour himself.

{"body": "Very interesting video. I wish I had a sense of the actual pH of those solutions to get a sense if the acidic and basic solutions were out of range from what food would be typically cooked in or if they were practical environments, but it's still a very thought provoking video.\n\nI remember a pH indicator experiment with beet juice. Beet juice is a particularly sensitive pH indicator. I suspect that the various pH of the solutions could be a major contributor to the color of vegetables. There is ample evidence of color of vegetable pigments being significantly affected by pH.\n\nFor your first question, if one was to accept Mohr's statements, one would maintain crispness of green beans by blanching them in water doped with baking soda. They'd be more crunchy and vibrant green. If you wanted to achieve a vibrant green on the outside, but more mushy you're kind of stuck. Only the outsides are accessible to a water bath. Unless you were willing to inject a bit of vinegar you're kind of stuck. All applications of heat, typically used in cooking, start with the outside.\n\nFor your second question, hard to say. If the wavelengths of light that our eye perceives as red are provided by only one compound, I'd agree, but I doubt that is the case. It might turn out that our eyes are crude spectrometers that pick up the presence of lycopene and that lycopene is present in varying concentrations in all red vegetables. If that is the case, then I could see (haha) that low pH media would preserve all \"red\" vegetables. It would probably be a leap to say that our perception of red in all red vegetables is brought by lycopene, but then our genome is all lego'd from A C G T so maybe things are that crudely digitized in the things we eat too. \n\nSame answer for alkali. I do not that in my experience with pretty much all pH indicators, darker colors went towards higher pH (more alkali) and lighter brighter colors always went towards lower pH (more acidic). Except for phenolpthalein (clear in acid, bright pink in basic), all of the broader spectrum pH strips I've used went darker towards basic than acid. I wouldn't be surprised if vegetable dyes were a precursor indicator for the paper strips commonly used today.\n\nI do note that the Mailliard reaction goes faster in a slightly alkali environment. That would be consistent with the more limp celery. Perhaps an alkali environment helps break down cellulose and make more starch available for browning. Some of my most favored stock preparations start with a browning of certain ingredients before simmering. I think leaching is being confused with chemical reactions though. Leaching generally refers to a solvent extraction that involves dissolving rather than conversion. I lightly simmer my stocks for hours which is long enough to osmosis out anything close to soluble. Maybe you can make a rich vegetable stock quicker with some baking soda, but I like my stocks clear of things that might affect my preparations with the stuff. I consider stock to be a versatile basic ingredient. I don't want anything that might narrow my options.\n\nI hope Kenji rings in here with something succinct.

A theorbo will cost you about €7500. This of course depends on the country where you buy it: a lute in Eastern Europe is a lot cheaper than one in Western Europe, but makers are hard to find on the internet.\n\nYou can also make one yourself, from scratch or from a template.

{"body": "**(7)** \n\nRemember that the Mixolydian scale had a structure of Root, major 2, major 3, perfect 4, perfect 5, major 6, and minor 7.\n\nIf our root is G that would be G, A, B, C, D, E, F, (G).\n\nIf we are to arrange this as a chord (by skipping notes) we get:\nRoot, major 3, perfect 5, minor 7, major 9, perfect 11, major 13.\n\n(Remember that a 2nd becomes a 9th in the higher octave, so major 2nd = major 9th. A 4th becomes an 11th in the higher octave, so perfect 4th = perfect 11th. A 6th becomes a 13th in the second octave so major 6th = major 13th).\n\nSo now we can see how and why modes are used. \n\nIf you stack a Mixolydian scale as a chord, you can see how the first three notes spell out a major triad. *Therefore, the Mixolydian scale can be used over a major triad.* e.g. play a G major triad with the left hand, and improvise with the G Mixolydian scale in the right hand.\n\nIf you stack a Mixolydian scale as a chord, you can see how the first *four* notes spell out a major triad with a minor seventh: in other words, a *dominant seventh chord*. i.e. G Mixolydian works over a G7 chord, because the notes in the chord are contained within the scale.\n\nIf you stack a Mixolydian scale as a chord, the fifth note is a major 9th. A dominant seventh chord + a major ninth is a dominant ninth chord (usually just called a ninth chord). i.e. G mixolyidian works over G9. \n\nWe can keep going but you probably get the idea. A scale will work over any chord that contains the notes in the scale.\n*****\n**(8)** \n\nIf you stack a major scale as chord you get:\nRoot, major 3, perfect 5, major 7th, major 9, pefect 11, major 13.\n\nNote that both the major scale and the mixolydian scale contain a major triad as the first three notes. Therefore, both scales will \"work\" over a major triad (i.e. both G major and G mixolydian will work over a G major triad).\n\nHowever, look at the 4th note you get when the major scale is stacked as a chord. It is a major seventh. Major triad + major 7th = Major ninth chord. Here's where the major scale and the mixolydian mode differ. The G Mixolydian scale will not work over a G major 9th chord, and the G major scale will not work over a G dominant ninth chord.\n*****\n**(9)**\n\nHow to know when to use which scale?\n\nRemember that the mixolydian mode was built off of the 5th note of the major scale. e.g. G mixolydian is the fifth mode of C major. So in the key of C the chord built off of the fifth note (the \"V\" chord) will naturally take the Mixolydian scale built off of that note. \n\nHowever, for practical purposes, there's no need to think of modes when playing key-center based music: if you're in the key of C, playing the C major scale over the C major chord (the I chord) and then playing G mixolydian over the G major chord (the V chord) means that you're just playing the same scale over both chords--it will give you a different perspective, but the notes will be the same.\n\nThe real benefit of modes is that it gives you tools to play over songs that aren't necessarily major/minor key based; i.e. songs that use non-functional harmony. Imagine a song with a chord progression of G7 to Bb7 throughout the tune. These two chords don't belong to any one key: this is a situation where you'd want to think modally, i.e. play G mixolydian over the G7 and switch to Bb Mixolydian over Bb7.\n\n*(Note that chord-scale theory is *not* an improvisation *method*. Many students are misguided when they are taught to play x scale over x chord. Chord-scale theory let's you understand harmony, which notes are strongest or most stable against a particular chord how to add extensions. Learning improvisation is more about learning how to target chord tones on the strong beats, and embellishing a melody using mostly chromatic devices.)\n*****\n**(10)**\n\nSo I used the major scale and the Mixolydian mode as examples in this essay. Since there are seven notes in the major scale, each one of those notes can be thought of as the root of a different mode; each one will be distinct, and the fully extended chord will be different for each mode. \n\nThe seven modes of the C major scale are:\n  \nC Major scale (a.k.a. C Ionian): C D E F G A B (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, Maj7)  \nD Dorian: D E F G A B C (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nE Phyrigian: E F G A B C D (Root, min2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nF Lydian: F G A B C D E (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, Maj7)  \nG Mixolydian: G A B C D E F (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nA Aeolian (a.k.a the Natural Minor Scale): A B C D E F G (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nB Locrian: B C D E F G A (Root, min2, min3, P4, diminished 5th, min6, min7)  \n\nWe can say these seven modes are *relative* to each other, because they use the same set of notes. In other words, D dorian is relative to C major.\n\nIf we build each of those 7 scales on C, and look at their structure, we get:  \n\nC Lydian: C D E F# G A B (Root, Maj2, Maj3, Augmented 4th, P5, Maj6, Maj7)  \nC Major/Ionian: C D E F G A B (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, Maj7)   \nC Mixolydian: C D E F G A Bb (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nC Dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nC Aeolian/Natural Minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nC Phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb (Root, min2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nC Locrian: C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb (Root, min2, min3, P4, diminished 5th, min6, min7)   \n \nWe can say that these 7 modes are *parallel* to each other, because they are built on the same *root*. In other words C Dorian is parallel to C major, while C Dorian is relative to Bb major. (Also, try to figure out why I listed them in that order!)\n\nIt's up to you to go through them. Just remember what the important information is: \n\n* What is the interval structure of the mode, and how does it compare with the major scale *built on the same root*? \n* What are the chords produced by the mode when you skip every other note? What is the triad, what is the seventh chord, and what are the extensions? \n* Learn to sing each of the modes from memory; this is how you will learn the individual character of each. \n\n***** \n**(11)**\n\nBeyond the modes of the major scale, (and aside from the chromatic scale) you also have the seven modes of: \n\n* The Melodic Minor scale (a.k.a. the jazz minor scale) \n* The Harmonic Minor scale \n* The Harmonic Major scale \n* The Double Harmonic scale \n\nAnd there are the three symmetrical scales: \n\n* The symmetrical diminished (only two different modes) \n* The symmetrical augmented scale (only two different modes) \n* The whole tone scale (only one mode) \n\nThese scales pretty much cover every possible scale/chord. Some people may include pentatonic scales, but those are really just derivatives, created by leaving out a couple notes from the other scales.\n\n(For a more in-depth resource on the theory/philosophy behind scales, see:\n[TheTonalCentre.org](http://www.tonalcentre.org/), and\n[Slonimsky's Thesaurus Of Scales And Melodic Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Thesaurus-Scales-Melodic-Patterns-Text/dp/082561449X))\n*****\n**(12)**\n\nSo much of what passes for theory and modes education on the forums and YouTube is crap. No wonder students end up confused. \n\nMark Levine is not the Bible it's cracked up to be. It's good as a \"for Dummies\" or crash course type of book, but as a comprehensive jazz theory text it's seriously lacking, and downright misleading or wrong with some information.\n\nThe best general jazz chord-scale theory text I've seen (I've seen them all) is probably the Berklee book,   \n[Chord Scale Theory and Jazz Harmony](http://www.amazon.com/Chord-Scale-Theory-Jazz-Harmony/dp/B000M7B65O);   \nHowever, even better would be the Bert Ligon books, because they go into more detail about how to actually put it into practice:   \n[Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony](http://www.amazon.com/Connecting-Chords-Linear-Harmony-Jazz/dp/0793561930/ref=pd_sim_b_2)   \n[Jazz Theory Resources Volume 1](http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Theory-Resources-Volume-1/dp/0634038613/ref=pd_sim_b_2)   \n[Jazz Theory Resources Volume 2](http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Theory-Resources-Volume-2/dp/0634038621/ref=pd_sim_b_5)   \n[Comprehensive Technique for Jazz Musicians](http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Technique-Jazz-Musicians-Instruments/dp/0634001760/ref=pd_sim_b_10)\n\nI should also add Hal Galper's material to the list; not exactly about modes, but it's truly groundbreaking and has already been changing jazz education for the better:   \n[Forward Motion](http://www.amazon.com/Forward-Motion-Hal-Galper/dp/1883217415)   \n[YouTube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/course?list=EC8229CD8C6B473D91)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362932867", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Pre 30 jungling is hard. Few reasons:\n\n\n\n\n* Your teammates are pre 30, so they are also un-experienced. \n* You don't have enough rune slots and mastery points.\n* Your enemy team doesn't always have jungler.\n\nI will answer to your questions, but try and save jungling for level 30 instead of now. If you want to jungle that much, rush to 30, and play normals (Normal draft preferred if you want to jungle. Lower elo blinds doesnt jungle much, but normal draft, even in lower elos is the 'elite' :D ) till you are sure enough to queue for ranked.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, don't learn Olaf. He is not as strong as he used to be, he got overnerfed, and he is overall, not so easy to play. His Q is really hard to land constantly, his ganks are mediocre, and you need good mana management or you go oom all the time, so you are unable to gank.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Hecarim not needing many items - True and False in the same time. Hecarim is a carry jungler. Lategame Hecarim is almost as scary as late game jax for me. He deals TONS of dmg, but that requires him to be tanky enough, to stand in the middle of the enemy team and constantly Q Q Q Q Q Q Q with his W on. He also got nerfed quite heavily, but he is still decent. Dunno what you building on him, but if you are doing good early game, rush spirit of the elder lizard, and then go full tank. As a jungler try to build cost effective items, that are either actives for your whole team, or auras. Rarely you can build item that your champ need, or it synergies well (Warmog/Sunfire/Spirit Visage). Most of the games you will end up going Locket/Bulwark/Randuins/Shurelia etc. If you fall behind tho, always build defensive first. Don't even go 1 offensive item. I mean think of it this way - You are behind.. because.. well YOU DIED. Now your enemy is stronger.. so you need to NOT DIE.. if you buy offensive, you are squishy, enemy is fed, and you die again.. and again.. and again... so buy defensive when you are behind. Also, PHAGE IS BAD. DON't WASTE MONEY ON PHAGE. I see every lower elo top/jungle player go first item phage. Don't do it.\n\n\n\n\nOkay now that I covered items for being ahead and being behind, what to do when you are behind IN THE JUNGLE, not itemwise. Try to powerfarm. If enemy mid is invading you, ask your mid to help you, and you can kill the person 2 v 1. If he catches you at wraiths, make a circle around the wall, to your red, and take the red. However tho, in ranked games you gonna get invaded, sometimes even lose buffs, etc etc. In situations like this, you cant spend much time ganking. Ask your team nicely to play safe, and not push (and hope they will listen), and powerfarm to 6. Powerfarming is literally.. just farming, no ganks till 6. Then, at 6, gank with ulti, if it's successful, check what you can get out of the gank (can you take down turret? can you do drake?), and back to farming. So don't force yourself to gank when you are behind. Just farm farm farm, use ultimate for best possible gank, and take objectives. Always ward. Wards win games. So ward defensive, and gank with ulti, and FARM.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note, about warding. If you are getting fed, still ward, lol. Just this time, instead of your own wraiths, you can ward enemy wraiths, so you can counter jungle, roam freely and know enemy location. Rule of thumb about warding - if you are ahead, you ward their jungle, and you catch them alone when they try to do what I told YOU to do. When they try to farm the jungle to return in the game. When you are losing, you ward defensive, so you can see them if tehy try to catch you alone in your jungle!\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Since I told you to skip Olaf, easy junglers to go with - Xin Zhao, Nocturne.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1362998243", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You would be better off learning keychanges, my man, or chromaticism. \n\nThe fact is, If you have a non-repeating scale, then it most likely is either falling into a different key between the two octaves. Now I'm sure, what you're looking for are common forms of this, common enough to be made into a scale, But I might offer a different perspective which will prove more effective in the long run.\n\nLets take a look at a couple scale:\n\nC Major Diatonic: \nC D E F G A B C\n\nC Harmonic Major\nC D E F #G A B C\n\nThis is an incredibly common example, however, I'm positive you havent explored these scales the way we are about to. If you look at the difference between the two scales, The only variation is in the Aug5, which turns G into a leading tone (#G). This effectively *can* turn your relative minor into a functioning Major tonic. The opposite is true as well, as one may flatten the 7th of Ionian (relative major), and modulate into Aeolean from the same root. And this can be done anywhere, not just over two octaves, although that is certainly an option. \n\nThe emphasis is on understanding *how* the notes are functioning, and there are truely endless combination with the diatonic scale alone. for example:\n\nLets say you wanted to do some triphonic modulation, lets take A Aeolean, to A Phrygian, If we look at the two scales:\n\nA Aeolean\nA B C D E F G A\n\nA Phrygian\nA bB C D E F G A\n\nThe wonderful thing about triphonics, is that it's a system of dominance that orients yoru major and minor modes, So here we've taken Relative minor, and the dominant, Phrygian mode, it's clear that the scales are quite similar. \n\n\nIf one were so inclined, they could juxtipose the two scales over the course of an octave, and develop some interesting sounds, but moreover, one could utilize this key change at any time, and In fact, a similar effect would occur should you replace any mode with it's dominant.\n\n\nI understand this is a wealth of information you were not necessarily soliciting, however I see a lot of composers fall into the same pit fall of scales, when it becomes much more rewarding to understand the mechanisms themselves, rather than the rule-of-thumb scales which are set in stone.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363021027", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Then you would move up to Db, and keep going up until you can't go up any further.\n\nAlso, when trying to play high, don't use a lot of tension in your face and jam the mouthpiece into your lips. Instead rely on fast air and really focus on the note. I've found that a decent amount of the problem is psychological.

We have a decent CCD camera and the following Filters: L U B V R I H(alpha) H(beta) OIII SII. I just hope a few of those galaxies are observable when we get the chance.

{"body": "This is the kind of topic that people can beat you over the head with for hours, and you won't retain shit.  So to keep it as simple as possible, so that you'll take the very basics away:\n\nThe key is to know that the musical alphabet starts at A, ends at G, then wraps around again:  \n\nA B C D E F G \n\nSharps and flats sit in between most of these letters.  Most, because theres no sharp or flat between B &amp; C, E &amp; F.   Sharps \"sharpen\" the note so that it reaches the next.  Flats \"flatten\" the note so that its more like the one before it.  Therefore, theres no difference between an A sharp and a B flat.  The musical alphabet with sharps/flats then becomes:\n\nA, A sharp/B flat, B, C, C sharp/D flat, D, D sharp/E flat, E, F, F sharp/G flat, G, G sharp/A flat. \n\nThats what you're looking at when you look at the piano.  White keys are the \"standard\" alphabet, black keys are the sharps/flats.  Knowing where the sharps and flats lie in the musical alphabet (or more the point, knowing that they don't exist between B &amp; C, and E &amp; F) will allow you to look at a piano and figure out what key plays what note. \n\nNow, i said I'm going to keep this simple, so the other thing you need to know about reading music. \n\n[Every Good Boy Deserves Fruit. in his F A C E.](http://guitarelements.com/Theory_Quizs/images/4%20staff%20spaces%20lines.jpg)\n\nwhen you look at the stave (the grid you display notes on), those two mnemonics will remind you of what note goes where.

All the seven modes fall into either a major type mode or minor type mode. Mixolydian is a major type mode and that's why it's awesome to use it when playing in a major key. \nIt's the same thing with Dorian which sounds awesome in a minor key, because it's a minor type mode. \n\nThe C Major scale, as we all know, looks like this:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nThis is what the C Mixolydian mode looks like (notice the flat B):\n\nC D E F G A Bb \n\nIn practice this means that: If you're in the key of C major and you want to be cool and play some mixolydian stuff on top of that, you just have to never touch the B, but play the Bb instead. \nIt's a dominant 7th instead of a major 7th and that's what makes it so useful in blues, for example. \n(Because in blues we play all dominant 7th chords, OK?).\n\nSo when you get G Mixolydian from the C Major scale it means that if you're in the key of G Major then it's OK to flatten the 7th note (F# to F) a from time to time :). It's useful to understand the fact that it has the same notes as C Major as a simple observation and a way to remember what the notes are. It's not the same scale.

Each X is a Gaul and each I is an empty  post.\n\nImagine we had no Gauls on the five posts, like this:\n    \n     [ I I I I I ]\n\nWe could call that null, or nothing.\n\nIf we had one Gaul, like this:\n\n    [ I I I I X ]\n\nThen that would be **I**. Yes, it's obvious. By Apollo, I'm not talking down to you. You were wondering what I saw from the Oracle. Gods damn it, now listen.\n\nNow, if we had one Gaul, but on the second post, like this:\n\n    [ I I I X I ]\n\nwhat would we have? What if instead of **I**, we had **II**? What if each dead Gaul, the best kind of Gaul, to the left of the last one held twice the value. So\n\n    [ I I X I I ]\n\nwould be **IV**, \n\n    [ I X I I I ]\n\n would be **VIII**, and so on. Do you see? Basic math, just know how to count. Remember, **I**, **II**, **III**, **IV**, **V**, **VI** all the way up to **M**.\n\n\nAnd to add these together, it works like this:\n\n    [ I I X I X ]\n\nis simply **IV** and **I**, which is **V**.\n\nSo what if by the graces of the gods we could line up every single Gaul on a post? Yes, a very big number. Yes, bigger than **~~MMMDCCCLXXXVIII~~**. But what if we cut it off every eight Gauls? We could make very small numbers refer to things to do with the other Gaul-numbers. And if we could move sets of posts around we could make instructions to move around numbers. \n\nYes, this could do something. Soldier, I have your gladius, if you don't let me explain I will cut your ear off. \n\nIf we had so many different numbers and things to move them, we could solve complicated math problems much quicker. This means our engineers could builds our great Imperial structures faster than ever before.\n\nHow would we move so many Gauls so quickly? Imagine if we all had the great Mercury's talaria so we could all fly swifter than any bird to move the dead Gauls. Then we could do many things very quickly. We could even set an area of Gauls and their associated post-numbers to make our mighty legions stand in a certain way to even spell messages to strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. \n\nThese mighty dead Gaul-on-post computing machines could be used to eventually calculate anything--much like the great Oracle divines the will of the gods. We could start chain reactions to find numbers that would take many months to find on wax tablet in mere days, or even hours.\n\nNow what if we had very, very small Gauls, which would be all the better to crush, but I digress. These many small Gauls could fit onto a tiny surface, such as one side of an assarius. Imagine millions of tiny Gauls, all moving around, calculating numbers on the side of a coin. One could then do much, much with would our Gaul computation machines.\n\nNow what if we could connect these Gaul computation machines to torches and make different patterns of light? We could create images; and if the torches were as small as the Gauls, we could make recreations of the world or a replacement for our wax tablets. \n\nSo, by using our Gaul computational coins connected to a large amount of torches we could make displays for our numbers. And if we interpreted the numbers in certain ways, we could get patterns, like words and numbers, along with many, many calculations. Maybe, even small dead Gaul coins could be fitted onto wax tablets so that everyone could have one. \n\nThey could even make sounds based on how much righteous pain they experience at the hands of our great Empire. We could have them make us images, sounds, and all the mathematics we could ever need! Perhaps we could eventually get these Gauls into small, metal boxes connected to arrays of torches and instruments to act as anything from a more powerful abacus to entertainment devices to marvel at the feline form!\n\nWhat do you mean \"did I inhale too much gas from Vesuvius?\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363154370", "subreddit": "explainlikeIAmA", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; So, I guess I'm confused on how to go about this. I think the input for wilcoxon.test is a nx2 matrix where I would have male/female in one column and numbers in the other. If I just leave A-J, how will it know the order of those (especially considering that A-J are actually strings and not characters as presented)\n\nAh, you see now you're asking about how to do it on a computer, using a program -- and then the details depend on the program. I was speaking notionally, rather than under the constraints of what a program is capable of. What  you're using may not deal with ordered factors specified as letters.\n\nR can do it:\n\n    &gt; res2\n     [1] C C G F D E F D C E G G F F E G E E E H C C A B B C A C E A B B D C C J I H\n    [39] H G J I H H J J G H I H\n    Levels: A &lt; B &lt; C &lt; D &lt; E &lt; F &lt; G &lt; H &lt; I &lt; J\n    \n    &gt; rank(res2)\n     [1] 12.0 12.0 33.5 28.5 18.0 23.0 28.5 18.0 12.0 23.0 33.5 33.5 28.5 28.5 23.0\n    [16] 33.5 23.0 23.0 23.0 40.0 12.0 12.0  2.0  5.5  5.5 12.0  2.0 12.0 23.0  2.0\n    [31]  5.5  5.5 18.0 12.0 12.0 48.5 45.0 40.0 40.0 33.5 48.5 45.0 40.0 40.0 48.5\n    [46] 48.5 33.5 40.0 45.0 40.0\n\n but maybe that doesn't help you much. If what you're using doesn't, then yes, maybe you do have to convert to numbers.\n\nYou seem to get muddled here:\n\n&gt; &gt;   How would you report the one-tailed test?  \n&gt;  \n&gt; As with any other one tailed rank sum test. I am not sure what   you're asking for there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  How would you report the one-tailed test?   \n&gt;  \n&gt; As with any other one tailed rank sum test.

I am not sure what you're asking for there.\n\nDid you mean to ask something there?\n\n&gt; One is a continuous distribution (tumor weight). I would just say median but unfortunately my medians are equal even though there is still a significant difference. My means are different. I saw a few books write the null as mu1 = mu2 and wasn't sure if they were trying to say means\n\nWhen a book specifies a location parameter like that, they almost always mean for a shift alternative - and if you make the necessary assumptions, you can even get a CI for that shift. However, if your sample medians are equal while your means differ, *you must be thinking about a more general kind of alternative* - it's not even a change in scale! I believe Conover (*Practical nonparametric statistics*, IIRC) shows how to write the most general form of alternative but I don't have time to go find that book right now to show you. If you can't locate the book reply back and I'll grab it then.\n\n&gt;  If I tried the Wilcoxon on that I'm going to have an ungodly number of ties.\n\nYes, I made that point; you have to consider the actual distribution under ties. But no matter what you use, you have to order the tables in some way that relates to your alternative. If you only want a general alternative I guess you can do it with a chi-square statistic but that would throw away power unless you partition your chi-square.\n\nUh, if you like odds ratios, there is a way to get successive odds ratios out of ordered tables. I haven't done anything with that in decades though.\n\n&gt;  Is this an appropriate use for the Wilcoxon?\n\nYes, if you deal with the ties properly.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363218735", "subreddit": "statistics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's worth noting that, like most musical intervals, it is ubiquitous in virtually all forms of Western music. It's not some strange, exotic interval that is used occasionally for effect, but a fundamental and indispensable part of the scale.\n\nLet's take C major. The notes in this scale, in ascending order are:\n\n&gt; C D E F G A B (C)\n\nAlternatively, you can order them a different way:\n\n&gt; B E A D G C F\n\nPut in this order, the interval between successive notes is a fifth, which corresponds* to a 3:2 frequency ratio. (Here we're treating notes of the same letter in different octaves as the same note.) If you keep this pattern going, you eventually end up right back where you started:\n\n&gt; B E A D G C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb B\n\nYou can go the other way as well, and you'll end up with the same set of notes. (Sometimes the notes are called different names, such as A# instead of Bb, but this is just a different way of looking at the same pitch.) In most music, though, we just stick mainly to a \"scale\" of seven notes that are consecutive in fifth order, like the C scale. This sort of scale is called a \"diatonic\" scale.\n\nSince there are twelve notes, there are twelve distinct intervals from one note to another. The interval from C to D, for instance is the same as the interval from D to E, but different from the interval from C to F. When you restrict yourself to a seven-note scale, you can still use these notes to form all of the same intervals, but some intervals have more ways to make them than others. For example, the interval called a \"whole tone\" can be formed by the intervals (C,D), (D,E), (F,G), (G,A), (A,B), but a \"semitone\" (the smallest interval) can only be formed by (E, F) and (B, C).\n\nThe interval the OP refers to is called the \"tritone\", and it can be formed only by F and B. (It's exactly half of an octave, so you can \"spell\" it as (F, B) or as (B, F).) Because there's only one of them in the scale, it shows up in fewer chords than most. The most important chord it shows up in is the \"dominant seventh chord\". In C major this is (G, B, D, F). Dominant chords are among the most important in music, and dominant seventh chords are a very common variety. In this case, the \"tension\" of the dissonant interval is usually used to \"resolve\" to the \"tonic\" chord, (C E G) (the \"C Major\" chord).\n\nOne way of looking at it is that the dissonant tritone interval (B, F) shrinks to the \"consonant\" interval (C, E) of the tonic. When the notes are played by different instruments (such as in a chorus or orchestra), the voice/instrument playing B will usually go up to C, and the voice playing F will usually descend to E.\n\nOne final thought in my ramblings: if you take that scale\n\n&gt; B E A D G C F\n\nand remove the \"extreme\" notes at each end, you get:\n\n&gt; E A D G C\n\nPut it into conventional order and you have:\n\n&gt; C D E G A (C)\n\n...which is the \"pentatonic\" scale. The pentatonic scale can't form every interval, and the ones that it can't form, the tritone and semitone, are the most dissonant. For this reason, it's easy to write melodies using these notes, or mainly these notes, and they will rarely sound \"off\". Most folk music uses mainly these notes. Amazing Grace is a well-known example from the top of my head.\n\nOne more interesting property of the pentatonic scale is that it is the \"complement\" of the diatonic; that is, if you take all twelve notes, and remove the seven that form some diatonic scale, the you will be left with five that form a pentatonic. If you remove, specifically, the C major scale (the white keys on a piano), then you are left with the F# pentatonic scale (F#, G#, A#, C#, D#), or the black keys on a piano. If you have one close by, go ahead and play the tune of Amazing Grace using only the black keys.\n\n(This is apparently what happens when I skip breakfast.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363274333", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It depends stylistically on what you're doing but there are a couple of ways.\n\nIt's common to play the #4 on major7 chords, because the 4 clashes with the 7. You cans do this is in scale (C D E F# G A B) or as a chord extension #11 (C E G B D F#)\n\nYou can also \"side slip\" by temporarily slipping out of harmony and back in. The best way to think of this is to think of all the notes that are not in Cmaj (which happens to make the F# pentatonic scale) and then when playing In C, \"side slip\" by playing that F# scale for a few beats and then slipping back to C. This helps build tension. The key though, when side slipping is to play no notes from the original sound (or to specifically just use weak harmonic notes like 4 or 6) because if you do, it just sounds like a mistake. \n\nYou can also use chromatic passing tones between notes. \n\nYou can also \"borrow\" chords from other tonalities. These are really specific but the best way to experiment is to writes some chords in Cmaj and then substitute one from Cmin and see how it Works.

{"body": "So after a quick listen to your two tunes there are a number of things you could work on that jumped out to me.\n\n**Variation and Song Structure**:\n\nYou have too much of what I consider to be the bad kind but none of the good kind. Now this is completely taste based but Warfare seemed to be a string of 6 or 7 different variations on the same idea. Way to many ideas! Find the 2 or three that do it for you, make one the hook (B), one most of the verses (A) and the final one a special variation on the verse (C). ( A A B A A B A C B B ) This seems formulaic but you have to repeat feels for there to be any continuity in your song and for people to remember it. A B C D E F G is not a song form.\n\nI often do this just to try the main idea out in a lot different contexts. But then after do that you have to edit the bad ones away and stick with what works.\n\nAs far as the variation I would want to see more of, there should be little fills here and there, an added snare hit, a doubled up kick, a measure in half time, short soloing of an element. Something to catch the listener and keep them hooked in. This also gives your rapper something to accent in their verse. These things are often added after the rapper does his thing to tailor them to the verse but not always. As these songs are now, they are boring. You have a little of this in Warfare but the little interjected pieces (the beat at :44, the ambience at 1:32) are so far outside of the main idea I don't consider them variations. You have to make them fit in. The beat at :44 sticks out so much. Really, your drums the rest of the track should be that loud. Which leads me to...\n\n**Bad mix**:\n\nFortune is way better than Warfare. The drums are up front but you can still hear the music. Did you make that first drum groove or is it a sample? Warfare's drums are weak and in the background. Look into compressing your drums and/or just bringing them up to volume. One mixing trick I do and have seen others do is to turn the volume down really low. What do you hear the most? Did the drums disappear? Does the mix still sound even? If you only mix at loud volumes fatigue and the adrenaline of having the speakers pumping can mask mix problems. Warfare, in particular, is all over the place.\n\n**Transitions**:\n\nUse them. In warfare you just kind of start each section. There's nothing tying them together. In Fortune, that transition is really rough. The pause in the beat throws you off the beat anyway (through the whole song) and then the weird flip in the beat is really jarring. Transitions don't have to be elaborate but they should guide you into the next section somewhat smoothly.\n\nThis turned into a longish rant.

{"body": "Scales are super easy.\n\nYou just have to understand that every single key going to the right including the black keys is a different sound, so a different pitch.\nC is one sound and C# is another, then D, then D#, etc.\n\nHere is a keyboard. l _- _ - _ l _ - _ - _ - _ l\n\nTwo pitches to the right of C is D. C, C#, then D. You follow?\nOne pitch to the right of C is............ C#.\n\nOne pitch is a half step, two pitches is a whole step. So from C to C# is a half step. From C to D is a whole step.\n\nThis is how scales work. A major scale is: W W H W W W H. This is literally all you need to remember to figure out a major scale of a key (key is the first note played).\n\nStarting from C, go one whole step to the right, another whole step to the right, then a half step, then another whole step, whole step, whole step, then one final half step which lands you at C again but one octave higher. Something that may confuse you is that when you reach E, going to F is a half step, **not** a whole step. There is no black key in between, so it counts as a half step. Same with B to C. No black key.\n\nWe just did the scale of C. This means we **start** on the key of C. If you want to know the scale of G, you do the same thing, just start on G.\n\nW W H W W W H\n\nIt's ALWAYS the same formula for major scales.\n\nSo, if you do the G scale correctly, you'll find that you skip the \"natural\" F key and land at F#. That's all there is to G. All white keys except for F, which is played as F#.\n\n**All you have to do is follow the formula.

E.g. C Db E F G A B C. Does this form a major scale? No, it can't since there are three half steps between Db and E and a major scale only contains whole steps and half steps. Let's try Ab. Same thing. Let's try Bb\n\nC D E F G A Bb\n\nDoes this form a major scale? Yes, it does. F major:\n\nF G A Bb C D E \n\nSo one b in the only place it gives another major scale is producing the F major scale. How far is F away from C? Right, a fifth down. \n\nDo this exercise now with a second b accidental. It'll turn out to be Bb major which is again a fifth down from F. Try the same thing with # accidentals starting from the C major scale. You'll find the ONE scale with a single # is G major. The one with two # is D major. \n\nSo all in all this resuts in a rule: Add a b accidental -&gt; The root of the major scale moves down a fifth. Remove a b accidental or add a # accidental -&gt; The root of the major scale moves up a fifth. Don't trust me though. Take a pen and a pencil and try it out.\n\nIt's super handy. So when you see a pieve of music with a violin staff and it has four #'s it must be C -&gt; G -&gt; D -&gt; A -&gt; E: E major.

{"body": "The last post about jungle Nasus I responded a bit about how he needs to fit into your team composition. Initiation is very important, but you want your team to have more than just initiation. Here's what I wrote in the last jungle Nasus discussion:\n\nI think it's also important to note when to and when to not play Jungle Nasus, particularly in regards to your team composition. In LCS, when Diamondprox picks Nasus, you should take note of what his teammates pick. You're not going to see Nasus on a team with Varus, Rumble, and Ryze. Why? Because those champions don't make use of Spirit Fire, one of the most important abilities for Nasus jungle.\nOne of the best parts about Nasus are his devastating ganks in the mid game. Yes, if your opponents ward very carefully you will have trouble getting off a gank, but if Nasus ever gets between an opposing laner and their turret, they are practically dead. For starters, you have the debilitating Wither getting cast on whichever unfortunate soul got caught. Next--and here's the real kicker--you have Spirit Fire come up underneath the barely moving champion. Then you have a burst of both the laner and Nasus's Q smashing them into a pulp. Also, with his ultimate Nasus is great at taking Dragon and Baron if your opponents back off and don't want to fight you.\nSo you really want a champion who can make use of Nasus's Spirit Fire both in lane ganks and later in team fights. All three times Nasus has been picked, Gambit has been running a very high AD composition. Great champions to go with Jungle Nasus are Renekton, Kha'Zix, Miss Fortune, and--even though no one on Gambit plays him as far as I know--Jayce. Jayce, Renekton, and Kha'Zix all become multitudes more dangerous in lane when a level 9 Nasus can easily slow their opponent and reduce their armor by 40. A sped up Shock Blast on a champion standing on Spirit Fire will almost certainly chunk them for over half, depending on the champions' builds. Miss Fortune becomes great late game because Spirit Fire combos fantastically with her ultimate.\nIn terms of Skill order, I would recommend E Q E W E R E (then Q if you want to farm or W if you want to gank) E then R &gt; Q &gt; W. That's my personal opinion, having the second level of W at level 8-11 can be great if you think you will be able to gank lanes, but if not just get the Q for the improved CD, farm, and start taking objectives with it. I'm not very experienced with Jungle Nasus, but I used to play a lot of Nasus top and have theorycrafted a lot about it with one of my friends.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363394900", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

UB40 - Signing Off: Much more subdued than UB40's poppier albums, Signing Off is a masterpiece of modern reggae mixed with classic dub instrumental tracks.\n[UB40 - 25%](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcXmcSzc3s)\n\n4. Beck - Midnite Vultures: While not the most definitive of Beck's work, this one is certainly the freakiest. Lowdown funk and sexy synths show off Beck's Prince-esque tendencies, and it turns out one of his best LPs.\n[Beck - Nicotine &amp; Gravy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzZ0hfFrQW0)\n\n5. Nicolas Jaar - Space is Only Noise: Nicolas Jaar is a multi-instrumentalist who blends hip hop with jazz, dub and smoky cabaret sounds. Turn this album on and float into a deep, relaxing zone.\n[Nicolas Jaar - Keep Me There](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsbiKHtXuok)\n\n6. tUnE-yArDs - w h o k i l l: Afrobeat rhythms + wild vocal arrangements = pure funky summer bliss. Merrill Garbus' voice is one of the coolest sounding things ever too. \n[tUnE-yArDs - Bizness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ1LI-NTa2s)\n\n\n7. Actress - Splazsh: A journey deep into the roots of electronic music, Actress layers hip hop with 80s electro and acid while applying a final coat of ambient techno. Killer.\n[Actress - Maze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD8VdZ7Xjfo)\n\n8. Mark Farina - Mushroom Jazz Vol. 1: San Francisco DJ Mark Farina mixes up a delicious batch of jazzy, funky beats. \n[Mr. Electric Triangle - Bosha Nova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNCMi-qRxbs)\n\n9. Kuedo - Severant: Highly reminiscent of Vangelis' soundtrack for Bladerunner, this album combines heavenly sci-fi synth melodies with modern drum machine beats.\n[Kuedo - Salt Lake Cuts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en-HmMPpze4)\n\n10. The Upsetters - Super Ape: Lee \"Scratch\" Perry's band throws down *the* definitive dub reggae album. In turns swampy and spacey, it's one of the best works of the genre even now, almost 40 years after its creation.\n[The Upsetters - Dub Along](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqfxOjkwy8M)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363537587", "subreddit": "trees", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

Luthor, CEO\n\nMr. Luthor:\n\nHaving studied the sample of the Kryptonian's DNA our operatives were able to procure, we have reached certain conclusions about the source of his powers.\n\nIt appears that the Kryptonian's body is possessed of particularly capable photoreceptors, on the order of photosynthetic cells in plants, but vastly more efficient. Possibly due to the Kryptonian sun (\"Rao\" or \"El-di-Rao\", as sources have informed us) being of a lower wavelength than Earth's sun, and consequently emitting much less energy.\n\nWe believe that, due to this, Kryptonians evolved to absorb, process, and utilize solar radiation with great efficiency, which, under the higher-energy, higher-wavelength radiation of our own sun, results in his supernormal strength and speed. Results are still inconclusive regarding his gravity-defying capabilities, as well as his invulnerability, but there are those in the department who hypothesize that the latter is in actual fact a 'bio-energetic field' projected around his body at a few nanometers from his skin. This would account for the seeming invulnerability of his clothing as well.\n\nProgress is being made towards the capability to replicate at least his strength and speed, with the aim of infusing these abilities into test subjects.

{"body": "&gt;Nice straw man, but I never said that.\n\nIt's your statement that I had provided no evidence when I had.. It's basically dismissal of the evidence provided as evidence without you substantiating what is and isn't evidence.  Yes you basically did say that.\n\n&gt;Calling an explicitly-stated volcano god (such as Pele) a volcano god because she's a volcano god is a tautology.\n\nFirstly scripture dealing with Pele doesn't explicitly state \"Volcano\" and nor do you find that regarding the Massai or the Indonesians ect. And more importantly, the term volcano did not exist in the Eras in which I am referencing concerning the bible. Using the term for mountain and describing it as a volcano is sufficient. You're denial of that for your appeal to ignorance argument is your problem.\n\n&gt;Calling some other god a volcano god because you think a lot of the myths surrounding him resemble descriptions of volcanic incidences is merely a hypothesis, and requires outside evidence of AT LEAST that the scriptures are describing actual events.\n\nThen you will have to make the same argument regarding all other volcano GOD descriptions in the history of religion.. And sorry, a Hypothesis lacks evidence, and if it were a hypothesis there wouldn't be any description or scripture to go by at all. What I provided can be classified as a evidence supported theory..  \n\n&gt; And pointing at volcanic eruptions and saying \"the scriptures are proven to be describing these eruptions because these eruptions happened and the scriptures are describing them\" is a circular argument.\n\nThus the descriptions in which the Massai people describe their deity is a circular argument because they don't prove the Massai people worship a volcano god.. And thus the descriptions they provide are not descriptions of a volcano, and  they likely don't worship a volcano GOD if we go by your presented logic.  If anthropology went according to your idea of what evidence is, you could not make any conclusions on anything regarding ancient religion at all since 90 percent of that deals with interpreting scripture and written accounts according to what their beliefs were. How do you think Archeologist and Anthropologists determine what is and isn't mountain GOD worship 3d6? You think  they utterly ignore scripture as evidence? Is scripture evidence of what ancient religions believed 3d6?  According to you it's not evidence giving your response claim that I had provided \"No evidence\", or that what I presented is \"not evidence\"..  Since that is your claim about what I presented, I will expect you to now provide a peer review paper proving I have not provided any evidence.\n\n&gt;and requires outside evidence of AT LEAST that the scriptures are describing actual events. \n\nYet I had.. That's the funny part about your statement, I did provide outside sources in which make the same statement regarding the description.. I even cited \"NIV ARCHEOLOGICAL STUDY BIBLE, P. 123\", the Smithsonian Board of Regents, I've cited:\n\n&gt;Mohamed Abdel Maqsoud of Egypt's Supreme Council for Antiquities, found houses, military structures, and tombs encased in ash, along with fragments of pumice, near the ancient Egyptian fortress of Tharo, on the Horus military road. Tharo is located close to El Qantara, where the Nile Delta meets the Sinai peninsula. According to Zahi Hawass, secretary general of the council, the lava and ash hail from Santorini, an eastern Mediterranean volcano that has been linked to the myth of Atlantis. The new find seems to confirm accounts from ancient artwork and documents that recount the destruction of coastal cities in Egypt and Palestine during the 15th dynasty (1650-1550 B.C.)\n\nI've cited outside sources to which included noting that Mt sinai means \"Moon Mountain\" or \"Shining mountain\" via citation in my articles to which can include these citations:\n\n&gt;According to biblical scholars, Sinai most likely derives from the name of Sin, the Semitic lunar deity.[2][3] In the Hasidic tradition, the name Sinai derives from \"sin-ah,\" (meaning hatred), in reference to the other nations hating the Jews out of jealousy, due to the Jews being the ones to receive the divine laws.[4]\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, classical rabbinical literature also mentions the mountain having other names:\n&gt;\n&gt;    Har ha-Elohim, meaning the mountain of God or the mountain of the gods[3]\n    Har Bashan, meaning the mountain of Bashan; however, Bashan is interpreted in rabbinical literature as here being a corruption of beshen, meaning with the teeth, and argued to refer to the sustenance of mankind through the virtue of the mountain[3]\n&gt;\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica.\n↑ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 3.04 3.05 3.06 3.07 3.08 3.09 3.10 Joseph Jacobs, M.

Sinai is. De Vaux believes that the theophany of Sinai was a description of a volcanic eruption in northern Arabia (1978, 432-8). Exodus 19:18 describes the mountain like a furnace of smoke. From a distance it would look like a pillar of cloud in the day, and a pillar of fire at night. Following this cloud of smoke would lead them right to the volcano. There are no volcanoes in Sinai, but there are several in northern Arabia (Lee 1996, 20). The only known large eruption around this time is Santorini on the Greek island of Thera (Simkin et al. 1981, 111).\n\nAnd thus giving the time periods in question, their description most likely comes from the Volcanic activities of their Time to which includes the Thera Eruption. And nobody knows for sure which Mountain, or if it's just a reference to any volcanic mountain from which they are basing the story on, and the description on.. \n\nAnd if you like, I can further cite outside sources:\n\n&gt; naturalistic explanation of the biblical devouring fire is that Sinai could have been an erupting volcano; this has been suggested by Charles Beke,[31] Sigmund Freud,[32] and Immanuel Velikovsky, among others. This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai peninsula and Seir, but would make a number of locations in north western Saudi Arabia reasonable candidates. In 1873, Charles Beke proposed that Sinai was the Jabal al-Nour (meaning mountain of light), a volcanic mountain at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba, and which has great significance in Islam for other reasons;[31]\n&gt;\n&gt;^ a b Charles Beke, Mount Sinai, a Volcano (1873)\n^ Sigmund Freud, Moses and Monotheism (1939)\n^ Charles Beke (deceased), Sinai in Arabia and of Median (1878)\n\nAnd since the source above didn't cite Immanuel's input, here it is:\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=OS9rSQPyvwoC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=If+we+do+not+limit+ourselves+to+the+few+passages+from+the+Book+of+Exodus+cited+in+support+of+the+idea+that+MOUNT+SINAI+WAS+A+VOLCANO,+the+activity+of+which+impressed+the+Israelites,+but+turn+our+attention+to+the+MANY+OTHER+PASSAGES+in+the+various+books+of+the+Scriptures+referring+to+the+Exodus,+we+soon+feel+bound+to+make+the+unusual+admission+that,+if+the+words+MEAN+WHAT+THEY+SAY,+the+scope+of+the+catastrophe+must+have+exceeded+by+far+the+extent+of+the+disturbance+that+could+be+caused+by+ONE+ACTIVE+VOLCANO+[SINAI].+Volcanic+activity+spread+far+and+wide,+and+MOUNT+SINAI+WAS+BUT+ONE+FURNACE+in+a+great+plain+of+smoking+furnaces.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fXfCV8NcNo&amp;sig=T8S-ZnrEJY6P9FwMpf9m8ybjNrU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fIpHUdirF9O24APH6ICoBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20we%20do%20not%20limit%20ourselves%20to%20the%20few%20passages%20from%20the%20Book%20of%20Exodus%20cited%20in%20support%20of%20the%20idea%20that%20MOUNT%20SINAI%20WAS%20A%20VOLCANO%2C%20the%20activity%20of%20which%20impressed%20the%20Israelites%2C%20but%20turn%20our%20attention%20to%20the%20MANY%20OTHER%20PASSAGES%20in%20the%20various%20books%20of%20the%20Scriptures%20referring%20to%20the%20Exodus%2C%20we%20soon%20feel%20bound%20to%20make%20the%20unusual%20admission%20that%2C%20if%20the%20words%20MEAN%20WHAT%20THEY%20SAY%2C%20the%20scope%20of%20the%20catastrophe%20must%20have%20exceeded%20by%20far%20the%20extent%20of%20the%20disturbance%20that%20could%20be%20caused%20by%20ONE%20ACTIVE%20VOLCANO%20[SINAI].%20Volcanic%20activity%20spread%20far%20and%20wide%2C%20and%20MOUNT%20SINAI%20WAS%20BUT%20ONE%20FURNACE%20in%20a%20great%20plain%20of%20smoking%20furnaces.&amp;f=false\n\nAnd note that I agree here with Immanuel that if you really do take into account the rest of the bible, it's quite obvious what they are referencing, and I am not that stupid or woefully ignorant to not know what they are referencing 3d6. You may be so giving your responses, but anyone who has an ounce of logical reasoning will understand what it is that is being described. And I can tell you don't since suggesting a forest fire was a pretty bad attempt.. \n\nI would also like you to explain how these people were supposed to described a volcano in your own words without the existence of the word volcano, or a word for volcano.. What description in ancient hebrew would suffice to describe a volcano and within their limited understanding of what they are.  The fact you can't comprehend they are referencing a mountain and describing it in volcanic terms is either utter stupidity, or utter woeful ignorance at this point in this discussion..\n\nAnd may I ask what evidence would you require to show they are describing a Volcano? Would it require to be in the context of 21 century peer review science to which they had no concept of? What description would suffice as evidence of a description of a volcano according to your standards of evidence?

{"body": "To make things a bit more interesting, I would suggest identifying the scale you're using, and then knowing exactly which notes belong to it. So let's just go ahead and assume you're working with C because it's the standard, right?\n\nThere's an easy method to find the aforementioned notes:[](/sp)\n\nF C G D A E B\n\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 [](/sp)\n\n---\n\nNow, allow me to explain what that means: Any scale to the left of C (this includes flat scales like Bb, Eb, Ab and so on) will have flats, and any scale to the right of C (this includes sharp scales like F#, C#, G#, and so on) will have sharps. The numbers below these notes represent the amount of alterations you can find on each scale, hopefully it's understandable enough. \n\nNow, how does it work?\n\nWell, it's very simple: Each scale has a respective number of either sharps or flats, but these scales over there are not randomly organized. They follow a pattern (please look at the chart for further reference throughout the whole post): \n\nF has one flat: Bb\n\nG has one sharp: F#\n\nD has two sharps: F#, C#\n\nA has three sharps: F#, C#, G#\n\nE has four sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#\n\nI'm sure you already noticed the pattern here: Any scale with X number of sharps will have the first X notes from left to right (F to B) become sharps. Any scale with X number of flats will have the first X notes from right to left (B to F) become flats. \n\nThis same thing applies to minor scales, but the chart values change dramatically: [](/sp)\n\nF   C  G D  A E B\n\n-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 [](/sp)\n\nExplaining exactly *why* this happens would require a lot of time, so just ignore the reasons why and concentrate on how this changes everything. \n\nWhile G (major) had a sharp (F#), Gm will have 2 flats: Bb and Eb, but aside from that, there are no major changes in the process of figuring out alterations to notes.\n\n---\n\nSo now you have a way of knowing which notes belong to your scale. Theoretically every note you play within these eight notes should sound good in your song. Of course, there are also chromatic scales, but for the sake of brevity I'll just ignore them. This should solve every single problem you have with solos and melodies.\n\n---\n\nNow, off to make things a bit more interesting regarding chords and progressions:\n\nFirst thing you need to know is that working with minor progressions (that is, a minor scale) and major progressions is usually very different, but if pulled off correctly, it can sound great regardless.\n\nAs you might know, the common C scale consists of: C D E F G A B C, while the common E scale consists of: E F# G# A B C# D# E. Eight notes. Eight **very important** notes. These notes will help you with progressions later. Just remember that a common E scale begins with E and not with C, and remember the alteration (flats and sharps) finding method.\n\nChord progressions are the core of a song. Everything else is built upon them, so learning how to use them can be quite useful.\n\nWe will focus on major progressions first. It would be really complicated to actually *explain* this, so instead have [this chart](http://endofthegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/major-chords.jpg) which depicts how Major Progressions work. You can combine them however you like and it should sound okay. Of course, as long as you include the First or Main chord. The First or Main chord is the chord corresponding to the first note of the scale you're using.\n\nAs for minor progressions, [here's the equivalent chart](http://endofthegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/minor-chords.jpg). You know how it goes.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** [This](http://endofthegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/major-chords.jpg) and [this](http://endofthegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/minor-chords.jpg) are both charts in which you can see which chords would fit in with whichever scale you're using. Of course, some genres don't follow these rules and use some other chords not depicted there, but I think these will be sufficient. So if you want to make your song interesting, just replace some of your actual chords with some of these, (taking into account the scale you're using, of course) and it should sound less repetitive.\n\n[](/applegasp) Shit, that's a lot of text.

{"body": "The ones below for sure.\n\n\nI'm all about engaging the breath when singing. Lip buzzing from C to G to C(or whatever key you are in) is pretty good for getting air moving. Physical activity also works really well. Only particularly tired days I'll sometimes have people do 15 push ups or jumping jacks(not in a slave driver way haha, just tell em it's to get blood pumping and energy levels kicked up). \n\nAlso doing some light falsetto work is great too. For example, on an ooo [u], just VERY LIGHT but supported, go from F G A G F then up one or two, and then back down until everyone is back in chest register. It's important that they stay in their falsetto as long as possible on the way down, as the goal is to incorporate headvoice into their chest voice. Also when they are singing up a little higher, they DO NOT want to push to make the loudest strongest sound they can. It's about feeling a relaxed free sensation in the throat and larynx, not showing off what a strong falsetto you have. \n\nAlso for raising soft pallet, here's a fun exercise. Say you are starting on C#(I like avoiding C and F in warm ups, they are weird for intonation if you are using a piano). On numbers or solfege, sing up the scale. 1 2 ti(ti is easier to say than three) 4 5 6 7 8. Then without stopping repeat the top note and come down the scale. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Have the tenor ones hold 8, T2s hold 6 baritones hold 4, basses hold 2(you can have a bass drop down to the 5 below the orignal note for fun if you want!). Have them switch to a \"NG\" sound hold that for a second and then have them resolve down (t1 stay on 8, t2 go to 5, baris to 3, bass to 1) and switch to a nice mezzoforte with lots of breath supporting it. Really opens up the tone and gets a nice lift in the soft pallet. Also great for working on intonation and tuning. If you run a mixed group, have sops stop on 8 tenors on 6 altos on 4, basses on 2.\n\nHope these help!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363955095", "subreddit": "acappella", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You are deriving your chords from the wrong key.\n\nC Dorian:\n\n**C D Eb F G A Bb**\n\nSo here we have the dorian mode, which we know is the 2nd mode in a key. So to get our chords we must first \"reverse engineer\" what key these chords will be coming from. Since Dorian is the 2nd mode of a key, then to find out what key we are in we need to count back 1 scale degree to the Ionian (root) of the scale. In doing so we find that C Dorian is the 2nd mode of Bb Major (Ionian). So we have to derive our chords from the key of Bb Major.\n\nBb Major, C Minor, D Minor, Eb Major, F Major, G Minor, A Min7b5\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\nC phrygian:\n\n**C Db Eb F G Ab Bb**\n\nMoving on to C Phrygian we once again have to \"reverse engineer\" the phrygian mode back to the key's root in order to obtain our chords in Key. We know that Phrygian is the 3rd mode of the major scale so we have to go back 2 scale degrees to find our Key root. In doing so we find that C Phrygian is the 3rd mode of the Key of Ab Major.\n\nSo once again we construct our chords from the key of Ab Major;\n\nAb Major, Bb Minor, C Minor, D Major, E Major, F Minor, G Min7b5\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\nC mixolydian:\n\n**C D E F G A Bb**\n\nFor your last example we'll once again determine what key the C Mixolydian scale is derived from. We know that Mixolydian is the 5th mode of a Key, so we have to count back 4 scale degrees from C Mixolydian to get our Key Root. In doing so we find that C Mixolydian is the 5th mode of the Key of F major.\n\nSo we know we have to use the Key of F major to get our chords;\n\nF Major, G Minor, A Minor, Bb Major, C Major, D Minor, E Min7b5\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe above 3 examples is how you would find all the chords in a key that would work against a given mode. But you can also do it in reverse where if given a chord you can determine what mode would work over that chord. To do this we have to analysis why harmonic sound does each mode imply.\n\nTake C Dorian:  **C D Eb F G A Bb** as an example; if we just simply constructed a chord from the C Dorian scale (as opposed to the C Ionian scale) we'll find that;\n\nC Eb G : C minor\n\nSo, just by simply stacking thirds based off the C Dorian scale we'll find that it forms a C Minor chord. So basically what this means is that the C Dorian mode can imply a minor harmony. So if you were given a minor chord, it would be possible to play a dorian scale based off that minor chord's root and have it \"fit\" (this is subjective here because whether or not a dorian scale will actually fit will be determined not just by the background chord but all the other notes that are complementing the sound as well).\n\n\nAnother example: C Mixolydian: **C D E F G A Bb** if we construct a chord by stacking 3rd we find;\n\nC E G: C Major\n\nSo, the Mixolydian mode implies the major sound because of the major 3rd (as opposed to the minor thirds found in the Dorian scale). Therefore if we were given any Major chord, it could be possible to play the Mixolydian mode with the same root as that major chord over it and have it possibly \"fit\". \n\n\nIf you do the same for the remaining modes you'll find that the Major and Minor sounding modes are as follows;\n\nMajor: Ionian (obviously), Lydian, Mixolydian\n\nMinor: Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian\n\nDiminished: Locrian\n\nNote that the Locrian mode will sound a bit diminished and neither major nor minor, this is because the Locrian has a minor 3rd but also a diminished 6th (vs. a perfect 5th found in the other modes).\n\nTherefore, you are able to play these types of modes over chords that share the same major or minor tonality and it should fit (at least in theory).\n\nHopefully that helps you a bit.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1363980885", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This brings up a good point, you don't necessarily need to use the particular perspective that you illustrate in your post. What you are actually using are scale pieces and not modes, the nature of the fretboard and positions makes it easier to think of scale pieces as modes but technically a mode is only a mode if the underlying progression resolves in a certain way ( there are intense knock down drag out arguments over at the r/theory page about this and all of us guitarists are roundly abused there) So for example if you have a progression that goes G Am Bm C D G and then over the bm you play B C D E F# G A B you are not in B phrygian, you are playing G major from B to B in G ionian because the chord progression resolves that way, in fact , the modes were invented first, it's a whole big messy music hostory lesson. That being said, we call scale pieces modes on the guitar because it suits our purposes VERY conveniently, so let's move on from the esoteric r/theory folks and get to what it is you are asking about, A very easy way to look at it is that the \" mode\" ( which is really a scale piece_ basically fits over the degree of the scale so when you want to use C dorian -we're thinking about a I that is Bb major ( and we would be at a II chord that is Cm) so Bb major = Bb C D Eb F G A Bb  so you would be thinking Bb ionian C dorian D phrygian Eb Lydian F mixolydian G Aeolian ( natural minor) A locrian Bb ionian.  A good song to mess around with might be \" like a Rolling Stone by Bob Dylan because the progression literally goes Do Re Mi Fa So   Cmaj Dmin Emin Fmaj G   then try playing G ionian, A dorian B phrygian C lydian D mixolydian and you can hear how each scale piece that starts at the correct degree \" fits\" over the chord. Typical progressions for dorian might include a II , V like the Song\" Spooky\" -Atlanta Rhythm Section does a great version of this.\n Often times a Mixolydian mode is used to cover a V7 chord or a dominant chord , so it's possible for example to have a progressive sort of sound on a 12 bar blues ( which isn't necessarily how the style s played but you could for ex play G7 C7 D7 and play Gmix, Cmix and D mix over each respective chord. \n Another big feature is that it is possible to assign a blues scale as \" fitting inside of a mode\" -for example  G blues G Bb C D F , could be said to resemble G dorian  G A Bb C D E F,. \n these are some applications, I think it's always easiest to think of each scale piece as fitting the degree of the scale it begins on and work from there, especialy for a guitar.

{"body": "The major things I've noticed are:\n\n* **I don't use cursor keys for navigation**; rather, I use the `C-n`, `C-p`, and so forth keys.  This went fairly early on; it was very awkward at first, but it was definitely more comfortable and faster.  This really, in my opinion, requires swapping Caps Lock and Control, or your constant use of the control key with your pinky will drive you nuts.\n\n* **I navigate much more with isearch**.  Want to move the cursor to a particular spit?  Hit `C-s` and type the first few letters of where you want the cursor to be.\n\n* **I use `C-k` much less**.  I used to use `kill-line` all the time; I was writing mostly code with emacs, and killing a line was a common operation.  However, the `C-SPC &lt;something&gt; C-w` combination is much more general-purpose and powerful; it can be used in conjunction with simple cursor movement, isearch, forward-sexp, and so forth.\n\n* **I use [dired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dired)**.  I don't use it as much as I do zsh for file management, but sometimes, it's very handy; browsing a list of movies or deleting files with hard-to-type-names are good examples.\n\n* **I use `forward-sexp` (`M-S-f`) and `backward-sexp` (`M-S-b`)** a lot to bounce around code.  `forward-paragraph` (`M-{`) and `backward-paragraph` (`M-}`) also get a lot of use.\n\n* **I keep many more buffers open**, and fewer emacs instances.  I don't use one emacs instance for everything, but one for *most* things, and then individual emacs instances for particular code projects.\n\n* **I picked up enough elisp** to be able to add most things that I'd like to have happen.\n\n* **I use [vc](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/VersionControl)**; it's a subset of the operations that I need to use, but it's wonderful for diffing two revisions.  I stubbornly hold out against moving to magit, because it's been so convenient to have a generic VCS frontend, which lets me move from VCS to VCS trivially.\n\n* **I use help *much* more**.  All I really knew about for a long time was `C-h a &lt;name of function&gt;`.  If you know help, you can answer many of your own questions: `C-h ?` lists the various help options.  The big ones I use are `C-h a` (shows interactive commands that match), `C-h k &lt;keybinding&gt;` (shows what a particular keybinding does), `C-h b` (shows all the current bindings), `C-h m` (shows brief help on a mode), `C-h w &lt;function-name&gt;` (the opposite of `C-h k`, showing what key runs a given function).  `C-h f` and `C-h v` are handing for looking up elisp functions and variables, respectively.  Also, most lengthy key combinations can take `C-h` to describe the various keys that can be hit at this point; `C-x 4 C-h` will show the miscellaneous \"other window\" operations, for example.\n\nSome things that I never really picked up much, that I thought I would:\n\n* **`zap-to-char`, or `M-z`**.  Seems like it could be useful, but I just very rarely use it, and it's not much faster than using isearch and kill-region.\n\n* **Emacs as a mail client**.  I do use `gnus` as a mail client on a daily basis, but I've never been all that enthralled with it.  Its fancy expiry and marking systems don't seem to unleash amazing functionality that I felt like I was missing out on, and its slow and synchronous fetching is a significant drawback.  It bugs me that adding an attachment (`C-c C-a`) and detaching a file (`K o`) are so different.  I do think that `gnus` makes more sense as an nntp client.\n\n* **Emacs as a PIM**.  I found [BBDB](http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/) to not play nice with my delayed autoloading of gnus, and to have a pretty steep investment for what amounts to a list of email addresses (at least in terms of what I need).  I thought that the idea of calendaring was nice, but have never got around to playing with org-mode's functionality.  Diary seemed a bit limited.\n\n* **I'm glad that TRAMP exists, but I rarely find myself using it**.  [`lftp`](http://lftp.yar.ru/) provides rather better (and asynch) file transfer capabilities.\n\n* **Info-mode in general**.  Web browsers have pretty much killed off info for me.  Info browsers normally have slightly more-efficient bindings, but I know my browser really well.\n\n* **Unicode input**.  I'd like to be able to embed em-dashes and degree signs easily when I'm typing.  X11 lets me do this reasonably well for a small (but helpful!) set of characters, and uses reasonably memorizable combinations: — I just hit Compose Hyphen Hyphen Hyphen and get an em-dash, for example.  I can hit Compose o o and get a degree sign.  Emacs has a bewildering range of ways to do this, some of which are quite powerful, but none of which have really clicked with me.  \n\n    There are input methods (`C-\\` and choose a method), which I find difficult to use.  TeX method is probably the closest to what I want (i.e. can be reasonably memorized), though it's not very concise.  `M-x describe-input-method` will list the various key combinations and what they input.  In TeX method, three hyphens input an em-dash (which is kind of disruptive, because sometimes I *want* to use consecutive hyphens; I'd have to keep toggling in-and-out of TeX method), and there isn't a combination for \"°\".  The UCS input method is comprehensive but of very little value for rapidly-typing characters.\n    \n    Emacs has C-x 8 (characters) for certain convenient European characters, but this is very limited in coverage.  I can't enter either a degree or an em-dash this way.\n    \n    Emacs and `C-x 8 RET &lt;uncode-codepoint-or-name&gt;` permits entering arbitrary Unicode characters (by searchable name, which is a lot more-convenient than codepoint), but this is still awkward enough that I'm generally not going to bother. It's okay if I'm going to enter the oddball interrobang (\"‽\") with `C-x 8 RET INTERR TAB`, but that'd be pretty annoying to do for a degree symbol or em-dash.\n    \n    It's possible to use [abbrevs](http://www.emacswiki.org/AbbrevMode).  I think that abbrev-mode is kinda disruptive, but manually-expanding an abbrev, `C-x '`, isn't half bad.  The problem is that this doesn't work nicely for adding an abbrev that touches another word, so I have to manually indicate where the abbrev begins.  That's `C-SPC C-x 8 RET degree sign RET M-0 C-x a g d e g RET` to define an abbrev.  If I wanted to type \"36°\", I'd like to just type `/deg M-=` or something like that, and have abbrev-mode permit eating a leading slash/word-separator if the abbrev began with a word separator; that wouldn't need to be ambiguous.   However, instead I have to hit `3 6 M-' d e g C-x '` to get my \"36°\", which is quite a handful to be typing on a regular basis.\n    \n    Even if I wanted to do this, there isn't a pre-defined extensive set of  abbrevs for me to use.\n\n    Finally, I use emacs in a terminal, and some Unicode symbols are just plain kind of hard-to-identify on a terminal.  A degree sign is fine, and em-dash could be visually-expanded into three one-character symbols that produce a solid line (I suspect that there's a way to convince emacs to do this), but \"⇒\" is just unavoidably hard to make out in a small terminal font, no two ways about it.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364024781", "subreddit": "emacs", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "when describing scales numerically like that, they are basically relating everything to the major scale.  So the first thing you should learn is what a major scale is.  It has the following intervals: WWHWWWH (W = whole step, H = half step.)  So the C major scale is C D E F G A B C.  In A, it's A B C# D E F# G# A. \n\nSo now that you know that, you can look at something like \"1-2-b3-4-5-b6-b7\" and know that it has a lowered 3rd, 6th and 7th.  This would make it C D Eb F G Ab Bb C in C, or A B C D E F G A in A.  This is called the natural minor scale or the aeolian mode, or simply the minor scale (though there are other minor scales).\n\nSo now that you can figure out the left side of the chart, the right side shows what chords are diatonic to those scales.  Basically, it's saying if you build a chord off of a specific scale degree in a specific scale, using only notes from that scale, this is what you get.  So for example, if you're in C major, and you want to build a chord off of the 5th note of the scale (G) then the chart tells you that the chord would be either major or a dominant 7th (depending on if you make a 3 note chord (triad) or a 4 note chord (seventh chord).\n\nI'd recommend learning all the intervals before you get too in depth with  all the different kinds of chords.  \n\n&gt;And diminished and augmented is when the third note of the triad is a semi tone higher or lower than usual right?\n\nNo, a diminished triad has a lowered 5th and 3rd.  It's the same as if you take a minor chord and move the 5th down a half step.  C Eb Gb\n\nAn augmented chord has a raised 5th.  C E G#\n\nThat said, i'd really recommend reading a theory book since you have lots of questions that aren't super-specific.

On grounds of transcriptional probability it is less likely that the verses were deleted in several different areas of the church by those who felt that the account of Jesus being overwhelmed with human weakness was incompatible with his sharing the divine omnipotence of the Father, than that they were added from an early source, oral or written, of extra-canonical traditions concerning the life and passion of Jesus.

This is pretty hard to land since most monsters move out of the way. Make sure its sunned/knockedover/paralyzed to use it for the first bit.

Good luck having a monster stand still that long but it is possible. Also for taking out tails you do a A+X X X A X X A X X A for several upward jabs at the tail. Last thing is your forward rising slash (Pressing forwards and hitting X) after the lance raises up if you hit A you will start the X+A combo with upward jabs, also good for tail removal.\n\nUnload: The last special ability of the gunlance is unloading. After you finish the downward smash with the lance (The end of the X X X combo) if you hit A you will unload all of your currently available shells into one attack, very strong on gunlances with 5 ammo.

{"body": "Oh heyyyy I've got two of these bad boys. Alright, most recent first: \n\nI have a friend. Let's call her J for anonymity sake. We've been friends since about 8th grade. We're both 20/21 now. About last Summer, I invited a guy I used to see on and off over to hang out and catch up and hey, whatever, maybe mess around a little bit. He was really cute and super funny and blah blah blah I'm dumb and naive. Regardless. I ask J to hang out to make it a little less awkward and she said she'd show herself out half way through the night. Well, J's kind of touchy feely and is all up on the guy for most of the night. Touching, taking his phone, talking about the nude photos on hers. She'd never met him before then and now I see why. \n\nHer exact words of the evening were \"If you don't fuck him, I will.\" And that's when I know shit was about to go downhill. At some point, J had wandered off to her room - as we were roommates at the time -  and the guy follows her in. Which... hurt and irked me. It's like a double back stab! Fuck me, right? Well, they talk and shit and I give up after about 45 minutes of waiting around in the living room. I end up going into my room, locking the door, and changing into my PJs to go to bed. I was his ride to the apartment and he could have walked home for all I cared. He eventually goes home and I find out through J's boyfriend, yes boys and girls you heard right B O Y F R I E N D, that she and guy had been talking and 'sexting' and shit over Facebook after the fact. And that that night he got his hands in her pants and they got hot and heavy and all that fun stuff. \n\nWhat bothered me the most was J kept saying that she didn't do anything wrong and that he came on to her and that she wasn't the enemy [Later on down the road she admitted to initiating everything]. The words \"I didn't sleep with him. I mean, his list of girls he's slept with was way too long.\" Came into play at one point. Cool. Awesome. You decided not to sleep with him, not because I liked him or I was your friend, but because he fucked too many girls. Cool. Fin. \n\n\nSecond story, I'll keep it short and sweet: Best friend in High School had a psychotic mother who pretty much threw her out and spread rumors through her family about us being lesbians. My family took her in. Fed her, clothed her, took care of her, blah blah blah for a few months. She turns around, says her mom wants to talk and then disappears saying that I'm a shitty friend and she never wants to talk to me again. Awesome.\n\nI sure know how to pick 'em.

I'm a counter person and your blatant disregard for others really does anger me.\n\nJUST ASSUME THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT IS 15% MORE. Because if you aren't going to tip us, we don't want you in our store. You can just go away and never come back for all I care. I'd rather have 3 customers that tip well than 26000 who don't tip at all.\n\nWhat is it that you do that makes you so much better than me??? Everywhere I go I tip. If it's better service I tip more, if it's worse I'll tip less. BUT I NEVER TIP NOTHING. I make minimum and I can barely make rent every month but I still A L W A Y S give a tip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364504039", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I, and lots of other players will gladly stand on your ammo box and give you free points in exchange for more high velocity pixels. The same can be said if you're playing assault, throw dem medkits. Don't throw ammo/medkits out in the open though, throw them next to cover.\n\n\n&gt;Like a couple other people have said, be proactive with repairs if you're running engineer. Not many people are, so if you are, you will definitely not go unnoticed.\n\n\n&gt;If you're running assault, don't rambo revive unless you are ABSOLUTELY SURE you can pull it off and not get yourself killed and the person you just revived (again). It's usually better if you stay hidden/behind cover and be a spawn point for the squad rather than risk yourself trying to save someone and die, thus losing the squad a potential spawn point right next to a contested objective.\n\n\n&gt;Slow down, don't run everywhere. Aim down sight as you're going slowly around a corner so you're ready for whoever might be around it.\n\n\n&gt;Spot everything. Q Q Q Q Q Q 24/7/365. That way if you don't end up killing something, your teammates know where it is and can help you out.\n\n\n&gt;Camp if you want to. It's a legitimate strategy. If the other team can't get rid of you, that's their problem. You're defending an objective they're trying to attack.\n\n\n&gt;Learn the maps. This is probably the #1 thing for playing BF3 well. The better you know the maps and the routes you can take, what you can or can't jump over, and the routes that other people commonly take, the better off you'll be.\n\n\n&gt;Watch your minimap. If someone's spotted or firing unsuppressed, they'll show up as a little red arrow. Use your knowledge of the map and their position to figure out a route that will give you the best shot at killing them.\n\n\n&gt;Don't forget about semi-auto mode on the guns. Full auto/burst mode kills people quickly, yeah, but a few quick, well placed single shots can kill just as easily and save you ammo in the long run. This works especially well with higher damage guns such as the G3A3 and SCAR-H.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364526905", "subreddit": "battlefield3", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

[check this](http://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/1b3k52/i_dont_know_if_this_has_been_posted_here_before/).\n\n2. take a simple scale, like C major (no note is altered, meaning they are all natural: C D E F G A B C), a make sure you hear the correct intervals... this is rather difficult if you've no background in music (you may be a beginner in violin, but maybe you've played other instruments before).\n\n3. check intonation with open strings: a third finger note should sound perfectly equal to the following open string at left and a fourth finger note should sound perfectly equal to the following open string at right (a fifth, in both cases). for example, you start with C on G string: C D E F G (3rd finger; you check with G open string) A (4th finger; you check with A open string) B C.\n\n4. you can use a tunner, it will tell you which note you're playing and how accurate it is. anyway, beware of using a tunner for this purpose, you can get addicted to it (you may get used to having the tunner check for intonation, instead of developing your aurial skills) and a you'll get mad to get the perfect pitch (which isn't always perfect as the tunner will be affected by noise, distance, bow stroke, etc).\n\n5. finally, and most easily, use some kind of online resource likes [this](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=violin+c+major+scale&amp;oq=violin+C+major). if you're new to scales, they'll show you how they should sound, like [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Oxrgt1tRo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m55s). It's not I recommend this video in particular, I just picked up the first one to show you an example. look for the one that suits you better.\n\n6. best alternative: don't you have a friend that plays an instrument or sings? that would be, by far, the best way to learn your first scale :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364567488", "subreddit": "violinist", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Mod Nexus changed his level to 1!\n\nJob vacancies are at jagex.***, if he can say it i can too\n\n\n\n\n**MOD NEXUS-Development**\n\nHoping to have more interface and map capabilities soon to offer more features.\nGraphics will NOT be changing.\n\nThere are no plans to make f2p worlds for -free- players, OSRS is a membership benefit.\nHowever, f2p worlds for members will run with the next poll.\n\nEaster event is for 2 weeks, south west of fally.\n\nBot nuke is on the way.\n\nAutotyping is against the rules, but botting is much higher on their priority list right now.\n\nThere are still new players coming to OSRS.\n\nGrand Exchange is a possibility if people wanted it, 'unlikely at the moment'\n\nPre 07scape is not a possibility, this is the only choice they had to work from.\n\nDungeoneering and Summoning are both not possible.\n\nEOC will N E V E R come to 2007...you can quote me on that.\n\n\nMod accounts cannot add people to their friends list.\n\n'Max cape is an interesting idea'All accounts are considered for jmod, only serious offences stop this occurring. \n\nD picks are not an option with their current software.\n\nLiving caverns is not a possiblity, Jag is being investigated.\n\nIf there is another runefest, OSRS will have a presence.\n\nExclusive OSRS content is possible.\n\nZMI is possible, it would need a little work*\n\n** doesn't have a phone.\n\nDragon claws are not a possibility at this time.\n\nNo decision has been made about if OSRS will be free after 6 months, it is possible that OSRS will be offered as it's own membership.\n\nNo Sof.\n\nPrevious holiday events are not in the backups, only rewards.\n\nOSRS WILL be expanded.\n\nCurses are not possible at this time.\n\nGWD equipment could be rebalanced before release.\n\nOld PC won't happen, there was a bug that gave out too much XP.\n\nGame will not be resized, took 120 people 1 year.\n\nNo voicechat or voiceovers for OSRS.\n\nNo gambling, either P2P or NPC based.\n\n'Join friend' not possible.\n\nNo lootshare or coinshare.\n\nNo spec back on death, as this would lead to overpowered training methods.\n\n\n\n**MOD MAT K-Community **\n\nThanks for MNC Paranoia for covering this event for me, the information was taken down both in writing and in video, couldn't have asked for more. \n\nUnfortunately, as I'm sure you could have guessed, a lot of the questions asked were the same as ones covered in Mat Ks first event. \nI don't see the point in repeating myself...so I'm stretching the word count out as much as possible by writing this rather long message.   \n\n\nMore news about recruiting pmods and banning bots is being released with the devblog tomorrow, it'll be great to have a read of that and follow up with any questions in the following Q+A  \n\nThe OSRS mods are VERY committed to stopping gambling in any of it's forms, so if you see someone who is gambling in some way, report them straight away. \n\nThe OSRS team is currently working on the issue of high alching causing epileptic seizures for any sufferers. \n\nPost any poll ideas on the sticky, found here, they are reading them all and your suggestion is probably going to be locked now if you post it elsewhere, not to say you can't DISCUSS it here in general first  \n\nMat K has confirmed Jagex are AWARE of the problems pures have with accessing Ape Atol, no word on if it will be fixed. \n\nJmods are capable of going invisible. \n\nWhile Jmods can teleport themselves, they cannot teleport other players. \n\nThe small, dedicated dev team may be expanded in future if there is demand for it, but there are no plans to do this as of yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n**MOD ASH-Development** \n\nBB Tags added to forums causing a lot of trouble, so they're being taken down a lot lately, like now \n\nAt the moment, graphical glitches are not receiving much attention \n\nBackandforth bug affects other things in navigation and routefinding, which is why it's being polled \n\nEngine team working late into the night to combat bots \n\nReports help fine-tune anti-bot systems \n\nAsh does not choose pmods as he isn't part of that team, Mat K might be involved, but more information will be in the devblog. \n\nLooking into reducing waiting room time for minigames \n\nStealing creation is possible. \n\nClan wars may be done with cape colour instead of cc \n\nAsh will resist any attempt to put SOF in OSRS \n\nAuto-join cc is on the list of potential updates, requires engine work. \n\nPlanning to have specific content in mind before offering up graphic recycling questions, thinks recycling graphics for some things would be OK but not sure people would like doing it for something like a slayer helm. \n\nAbstain is being added to polls. \n\nWeb guys say all questions have to be mandatory, as changing that causes a lot of statistical problems. No 'not answering' instead of abstaining. \n\nJmods would tell us what abstain meant, rather than letting us vote on it. \n\nNo HP near minimap without an interface editor. \n\nBut the engine team who would make the interface editor are the same people that combat botting. \n\nSplitting the community was viewed as a negative attribute of the 07 servers, but we have made our own seperate community now. \n\nNo translation team to support OSRS in other languages. \n\nLooking for an animation to use for 'sitting' or 'resting', suggesting Jade bolt on forum. \n\nOur engine will be expandable, like how eoc's engine expanded. \n\nWeapons that don't work in pvp would be 'sad but understandable' \n\nMods are aware of the want to replace AGS with Armadyl Crossbow and ZGS with a staff. \n\nThere are no tracking numbers in OSRS, so we don't know how many people there are pla", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364759264", "subreddit": "2007scape", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
