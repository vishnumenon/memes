{"body": "'jazz scales'? 'jazz scales' are a group of scales that would be classified as acceptable to use in jazz, not a specific scale.\n\nAnd no, they aren't built like that. The only scale built like that is a pentatonic scale, which typically would go say C D E G A C for a C Major scale (so F and B are left out) so the tritone is left out as well as things with lots of clash like a minor 2nd or major 7th.\n\nBlues Scales aren't built like that; they include two minor 2nds in them.\n\nEdit: If the chord progression is very basic (like it is here) and continually repeating then it's not that hard to pick up as long as you know what chord they're playing (I'm a classical musician so my aural skills are quite awful in comparison), and if you know what chord they're playing you know what notes you can use so there's no clash. With that being said, some famous jazz solos have deliberately gone for clashes against the chord for a certain effect (I know one I've heard about where every note played is a semitone out).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364787309", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

Besides, the earlier you learn and start honing your skills, the quicker and better you'll be able to do it when you're older, when it'll really matter ;P\n\nON TO THE BROWS: My boyfriend has thick messy brows, not as thick as yours, but the stray hairs takes up as much space. He has been **trimming with a small razor blade** ever since high school, maybe even before then. He has quite nice brows ;P I really appreciate the effort he puts into making them look presentable, not to mention it adds like +6900 handsome points to his face. SO, you really don't have to be so self-conscious about your brows, it's totally normal. \n\nThat said, I don't have any specific guides to give you... A quick youtube and google search spouts a lot of eyebrow tutorials, mostly for females, though I found a few male tutorials too. I think the best way to go is to find some google images of the shape of eyebrow you'd like to go for, and then **draw in lines** with eyeshadow (maybe borrow your mom's or something). Then slowly **pluck or trim** towards that, **checking your overall face** now and then to see how it looks, to make sure you don't accidental take off too much. Remember, if there's too much, you can always take away, but if you take away too much, you have to wait for it to grow back, and for some people, that can take a VERY long time. [This](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uz3kaQpin2w/SgEOu2RVkYI/AAAAAAAADZ0/V1O42ldztpo/s400/shaping+eyebrow+tutorial.jpg) is a general guide for where the average brow should hit, but again, I'm fairly sure this is geared more for the female face, and not sure how much you can apply this. It also doesn't show the nose in that image, which is where all the lines are supposed to converge, so you can use the side of your nose as a reference when you do it on your own face. \n\nAnyhow, that's my two cents.

Beecham House is abuzz. The rumor circling the halls is that the home for retired musicians is soon to play host to a new resident. Word is, it's a star. For Reginald Paget (Tom Courtenay), Wilfred Bond (Billy Connolly) and Cecily Robson (Pauline Collins), this sort of talk is par for the course at the gossipy home. But they're in for a special shock when the new arrival turns out to be none other than their former singing partner, Jean Horton (Maggie Smith).\n\n* *Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary* - Before he was convicted of murdering a policeman in 1981 and sentenced to die, Mumia Abu-Jamal was a gifted journalist and brilliant writer. Now, after more than 30 years in prison and despite attempts to silence him, Mumia is America's most famous political prisoner.\n\n* *Live Concert: TAO presents Glen Phillips* - Glen Phillips of Toad the Wet Sprocket will headline the kick-off concert at Naro Expanded Cinema, 1507 Colley Avenue, Norfolk on April 4th.

Tickets can be purchased at TWartsOutreach.org.\n\n* *Don't Stop Believin`: Everyman`s Journey* - This film follows the real life rock ‘n’ roll fairy tale of Filipino Arnel Pineda, who was plucked from YouTube to become the front man for iconic American rock band Journey.\n\n* *Greenwich Village: Music That Defined a Generation* - Between 1961-1973, many musicians in The Village banded together to sing about the radical s o c i a l upheaval of the time. Featuring poignant interviews with Pete Seeger, K r i s Kristofferson, Don McLean, Peter Yarrow, Arlo Guthrie, Lucy and Carly Simon, Tom Chapin, and Judy Collins, among dozens of other music luminaries.

{"body": "I love the little mage! He can certainly be difficult to get rolling because he is squishy and has some hard matchups, but as you learn him he can cope with many of them. \n\nSome tips from my experience with him. I rune him defensively to prevent dying immediately. Mpen reds, armor yellows, flat MR blues, and move speed quirts...21 0 9 masteries. This setup starts me off with only 7 ap but that's what your q is for. Generally in lane, I try to q and auto attack harass as much as possible, farming q on minions when I can't harass. If you can coordinate a gank with your jungler pre 6 I would advise it. My basic skill order is q e q w e r...then prioritize R Q E W. Your longer stun duration will help you ganking other lanes easier. My starting items depend on the lane I'm against. Someone with a lot of skillshots (Lux Karth Cass etc) I will go boots and pots as the movespeed quints + boots allow you to dodge a lot of skillshots. Heavy harass lane I'd go with a mixture of health / mana potions and a ward, trying to play safe if I fear harass. \n\nVeigar has a few routes that he can go for build. Having played a lot of him, I make sure DFG is my first item in just about any circumstance as you rely so heavily on your burst. DFG Rabadons void staff are core...but you may find you need an early chalice against heavy harassment. My typical end game build is sorcs, DFG, rabadons, void staff, zhonyas. I don't typically like Archangels staff because it takes awhile to charge and delays your damage output. \n\nAlways buy wards, because nothing is as tantalizing as a squishy Veigar who is over extended. \n\nAlso, if you haven't already, smartcast your abilities in the key bindings menu. Some people don't like to smartcast his stun, so that you can see the target indicator and know where the walls will go. However, again, with enough games this will become habit and you won't have to worry about it. Getting used to it will let you nail people with the walls of the stun immediately and not have to worry about making them walk into it. I have also smartcast my item slots and will generally put DFG into item slot 2 so I can hit it immediately after dropping w. Smartcast is clutch because those few seconds between spells could ensure you a kill or give them space to escape. \n\nInstagib combo...stun, w, before w drops hit them with DFG (it will amplify the w damage), r and then q + ignite if you need it. This combo should drop just about anyone and with dfg / rab + your high AP will be able to even murder tanks if you have gotten far enough ahead. \n\nHappy hunting!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1364929615", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": ":)\n\n\nUsing a numbering system for scale references is just a way to be able to relate it to any key, otherwise you'd have to write the same thing 12 times.\n\n\nThink of the C major scale, 7 notes plus the octave. C D E F G A B C\n\n\nNow assign numbers to them instead of using their note names.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 (or 8).  If you then extend the scale by another octave you get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 (8) 2 (9) 3 (10) 4 (11) 5 (12) 6 (13) 7 (14)\n\n\nThis is how you can construct chords like an 11th or 13th, by using notes taken from the second octave.\n\n\nSo now you can use the number formulae to build chords, irregardless of what key the chord is in.  The Major chord is 1 3 and 5.  A minor chord is 1 b3 and 5.  A 7th chord is 1, 3, 5, b7 (with the 5th being optional).\n\n\nSee the link shiner_man posted for a table of chord formulae.\n\n\nhttp://www.hakwright.co.uk/music/quick_crd_ref.html", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365035696", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Your son won't care. Learn some basic fingerpicking patterns and make it up. \n\nWe use the terms P I M A, where P is the thumb, I is the index finger, M is the middle finger, and A is the ring finger. Most don't use the pinky, but instead use it to anchor the hand somewhere on the pickguard. \n\nA nice pattern is P I M A I, where you play P on the bass note (so for a G chord, play the E string), and play I M A on the top 3 strings. You can play this pattern over any open chord, switching chords as often as you are capable. A nice progression is to do G C7 D. I used to play that for my kids and they loved it. And I'd make up the words.\n\nOne of their favorite songs was \"Ice cream\", totally made up as I went along:\n\n    [chorus]\n    I like ice cream\n    Lots and Lots of ice cream\n    I like ice cream\n    All summer long\n\n    Childname1 like Flavor1\n    Childname1 likes Flavor1\n    Childname1 likes Flavor1\n    All summer long\n\n    [chorus]\n    [repeat w/ childname2 and Flavor2]\n\nMy kids, now teenagers, still like it when I sing this, even though my voice is terrible.

How did you go about doing them? Which program do you use?\n* Are those meteorite impact craters or giant ass old volcanoes? AFAIK, craters tend to get very hard to notice over time due to erosion.\n* Why is the southern pole more covered in ice than the northern one? Do any of the pole have an actual landmass under their ice sheet?\n* Where's your key story arc located?\n\nYou can make up a naming language for areas outside your main focus. Make up a phonology, a few rules for derivation and create names like that. For instance, let's take the following sparse phonology: /p t k f s l r m n j a a: i i: u u:/. The colon indicates a long vowel. Let's say the suffix **-lu:** means *land, territory of, place* and that **Rjam** is the name of a tribe. **Rjamlu:** then can be used as a region name to mean this tribe's territory.\n\nYou can also do the opposite: maybe **Pa:s** is a region. No need to come up with a meaning, it's just the name. If you want, maybe that's how they call the main river because of their main deity? Whatever. Then you whip up **-(u)lru** meaning *recipient of an action, someone/thing from noun*. This gives you **Pa:sulru** as the name of the people from Pa:s. The name of the people from the islands of **Ki:ka** is **Ki:kalru** though, because above, the brackets meant the **u** is only used if preceded by a consonant (**s** is Pa:s' case).\n\nIf you're a bit confused and/or want to know more, check [this out](http://www.zompist.com/kit.html).

Observe that a sequence of length 6 consists of a sequence of length 5 with a song *other than the last one* inserted into it somewhere it can legally occur (i.e. not next to itself).  You need to be careful not to double count sequences; one way would be to try to only insert the song after its occurrence in your 5 song sequence.\n\nJust as an example, if you have a sequence a b c d e, then a legal sequence of 6, with song a duplicated, would be one of {a b a c d e, a b c a d e, a b c a d e, a b c d a e}.  Figure out how many ways there are to put in an extra b, c, or d.  Now you have a canonical way to represent every 6-song sequence as the 5-song base sequence, plus which song was duplicated and where the duplicate was inserted.\n\n1.4  See if you can generalize the result from 1.3 to let you calculate the expected value.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365116902", "subreddit": "cheatatmathhomework", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

His recipe went with him to his grave but I finally got it just right. Very happy on that front.\n\n&gt; I do plan on using more LEDs in each set. Specifically I want to use two in each white set and four in each color set.\n\nYeah, the micro-controller won't be able to supply enough current per pin for that.  You'll have to use small n-channel mosfets on each line.  Tell me if you'd like recommendations.  Have you also figured how much current you'll be driving each LED at?\n\nOn your controller front I'm also happy because if you don't mind I'll be spending a bit more time on the code because I just got another commissioned project which requires programmable sequences for 10 signals.  I can marry both projects (yours requires 13 signals) and kill two birds with one stone.  Don't worry, you'll still get the chips that you'll just plug in and they'll do your sequence automatically, like in the video.\n\n&gt; Out of curiosity, will you send me 11 if I get them and you an additional 9?\n\nOnce the code is done we'll exchange contact details.

{"body": "It is actually more insightful than just what jpstevens wrote.\n\nIt is also meant to make people think about the concept of \"observation\". In quantum mechanics, \"observation\" causes the wave function to collapse. But it is difficult to determine what is meant by \"observation\". At that point in time, \"observation\" was a very nebulous concept, but was needed in order to explain certain experiments - specifically that the measurement of a property of a confined particle remains the same in repeated measurements.\n\nSo imagine to yourself that you have just discovered that particles are actually waves, and the wave nature of it is really just a description of the probability of the particle to be in a certain state. You are very, very certain that this wave nature is true because you can perform a diffraction experiment with particles and get a diffraction pattern - that means that the particles MUST interfere, which is a property that only waves have. To boot, you can get an interference pattern when you send a single particle through the diffraction grating at a time, indicating that a single particle **must** be a wave, and it can't be explained by group behaviour of particles.\n\nSo if each particle is a wave, and that wave determines the probability that any given particle in a specific setting will have a certain property. So we can set up 100 identical experiments in which we measure, say, the orientation of the spin of a single particle, and compare this to our calculation. In our experiment, we calculate that 20% of the particles should be spin-up, and the rest should be spin-down. In our 100 identical experiments, we find that, sure enough, 20 are spin-up, and 80 are spin-down. Success! The equations match the experiment! More experimental confirmation!\n\nBut now we are confronted with the issue at hand... What happens if we measure the same particles again, after already measuring them? If there is a 20% probability that they are spin-up, dependent only on the system that the particle is in, then a repeat of the experiment with the same particles should find that different particles are in different orientations, even through approximately 20% of them are still spin-up. So while we got u u d d u d d d d d u d d u d d d... the first time, we might get d d u u d d d d u d d d d u d d u d d d... the second.\n\nSo we repeat the experiment some time later, and we find that some of the particles have the same spin orientation but others have changed. Hmm. So we shorten the amount of time between measurements, and as that time shortens we find that the particles remain in the same orientation. In other words, if we immediately repeat the experiment after the first measurement, we will have a ~100% chance of finding the particle in the exact same orientation. The probability is no longer 20% up/80% down, but rather it is 100%-the-same-as-before.\n\nThe only interpretation possible is that the measurement we made \"collapsed\" the wave function. By measuring the particle, we have significantly altered the wave function/probability that is inherent in the environment. Thus, we understand that quantum mechanical systems have an \"observer effect\" - an observed system is necessarily altered.\n\nThis lead people to try to understand what determines an \"observation\". Does it require a human being, a conscious mind to observe? If we perform an experiment blind, do the results actually exist until a conscious mind observes it? Or are the results fixed at the time of the experiment, and they are only *known* once a conscious mind observes them? How can we tell?\n\nIn the view that it requires a conscious mind to collapse the wavefunction, and we assume that a cat does not have a conscious mind, then prior to opening the box the cat must necessarily exist in an uncollapsed wave function form, in which the cat is both alive and dead at the same time. For those who believe in the conscious-mind-observation but object to the alive-and-dead superposition, they will need to reconcile their views.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365177063", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

You could, if you want, transmit a book through it.  It would just take a long time.  Now, of course, the dots and dashes are, in themselves, meaningless.  The only meaning comes from 1. the mind of the sender, and 2. the mind of the receiver.  The former turns his thoughts into the code, and the latter interprets it. \n\nThe human mind is limited, and can't deal with that information, so pretty much all the data that comes across is in basic words and basic numbers.  But, theoretically, think about the challenge of communicating what a *picture* looks like through morse code.  First, you need to determine a way to establish what you're doing, so you type in \"PIC\".  Then, you have to say how *big* it is, so you go \"50\" to indicate its 50 pixels wide.  Then you type \"100\" to indicate it's 100 pixels *high*.  Since the receiver knows this is a \"pic\" message, he already knows what the two numbers following \"PIC\" means.  He will, essentially, get this message:\n\n&gt;PIC 50 100\n\nand translate it as \"An image 50 pixels wide by 100 pixels high\".  The receiver then takes some graph paper and cuts out a 50X100 section, and gets out his markers.\n\nYou then send a second line, indicating color.  You type \"BLUE BLUE RED RED GREEN YELLOW\", but then realize that that takes too long to type, so you do shorthand.  B B R R G Y.  The guy on the other side understands this and starts filling in the chart, one by one.  First one is blue, then another blue, then a red, then a red, then a green, then a yellow.  He keeps going, until he has an actual picture that depicts something.  \n\nWhat I described is a picture format, a very very primitive one.  To make it more complex, you can use hex color codes, which supports over 16,000,000 colors.\n\nYou can do the same with sound, or video, or really *anything* your computer does.  Except you *can't* with a human sender; you have to do it with a computer, because it's *so* much data.  So you set up a computer to send the data, and a computer to read and output the data properly.  And, of course, computers don't use morse code, but use basic binary.  So, instead of waiting for dots and dashes, all the letters and numbers and stuff are according to simply whether there is electricity going through or not.  Binary is a much faster, efficient, and logical method for communication than morse, but it's still the basic idea.  A sender organizes his thoughts in bursts of power/nonpower, and the receiver interprets it.  With computers, it *can* be complex, so it *becomes* complex.

Google \"circle of fifths\" and try to understand why \"power chords\" or triads sound correct when played anywhere on the fretboard. \n\n\n3. count on your fingers to help you become more comfortable with the idea of referring to the notes by name, as opposed to \"ok umm. fourth fret of the fifth string, uh er ummmm...\" A fun game you can play at work, the bus, grocery store etc is the circle of fifths game. You don't need a guitar for this and it really will help. \n\n(Definition: The root note is the pitch upon which a chord is based; the fundamental note on top of which the intervals of a chord are built. A chord is named after its root note (see keynote).\n\nLook at the intervals in a G major chord:\n\n    Root: G\n    Major Third: B\n    Perfect Fifth: D\n\nHowever, even though the root note acts as the tonal foundation of a chord, it’s not always the bottom note (or “bass”):\n\n    G Major Root Position:  G - B - D\n    G Major 1st Inversion:  B - D - G\n    G Major 2nd Inversion:  D - G - B\n\nG remains the root in each chord inversion, despite its location. G major in the 2nd inversion has D as the bass, but this does not make it a D major chord (which would be D - F# - A).\n\nhttp://piano.about.com/od/musicaltermsa1/g/GL_rootnote.htm)\n\nOk back to our circle of fifths game. The goal of this game is to get you to always be able to find the relative fifth of a given root note. Why? Because they just mathematically sound good together. How do you get better at this game? You improve your response time with practice.\n\nHold your hand out in front of you and name your thumb \"A\". Since this is our first note, it is our root note. Now count  down to your pinky to arrive at the \"E\" which is our fifth. If you were to play your fifth string open (a) and the second fret of the fourth string (e) together you have a very common and good sounding little chord there. Now this will work anywhere on the fretboard well. ( fifth fret of the sixth string (a) and seventh fret of the fifth string etc.)\n\nThat one was easy. Seriously look at your hands and count like a little kid. The visualization will help cement this in your memory. Try doing it again, this time name your thumb (root note) E. \n\nWhen you get into triads and figure out more complex chords this is the foundation for understanding that. If you learn a major chord, you can say you know the minor counterpart already because you know how to flat the third to make it a minor. Or you can say you know how to add the seventh to a major chord to make it a major seventh etc.\n\nc d e f g a b c\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n Google 1,4,5 chord progressions. You probably already know a lot of songs that use this structure. A lot of bands have made careers out of three chords. Really. I'm not going to name a bunch, but you probably can. I like to use Green Day and Nirvana as examples here because they made some of the simplest pop rock riffs ever and were extremely successful.\nagain, \n\nc d e f g a b c\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (8)\n\nIn this example, c is 1, f is 4, g is 5. C,f,g might be the catchiest set of chords ever.\n\nagain\n\na b c d e f g a \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nHere a is 1, d is 4 and e is 5.\n\na,d,e might be the catchiest set of chords ever!\n\nOne more time\n\nd e f g a b c d\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n  Learn jazz even if you hate it. Learn classical even if you hate it. Most importantly learn blues even if you hate it. Think of blues as the \"bluesprints\" of most music you hear that involves guitar. Guys like Angus Young, Zakk Wylde and even Yngwie Malmsteen will tell you blues is probably the most important to learn as it will help every part of your guitar playing.\n\nEdit: This will probably confuse you more than help you, I had typed out some cool diagrams that keep formatting weird when I save the comment. I spent way too much time typing this to just delete it. I spend most of my time teaching steering students towards competent teachers.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365249655", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

When done right as Davis and Coltrane have done, the progressions will sound very cohesive as a pop-style progression would using more traditional harmony.\n\nEach mode has it's own characteristic functions; scale degrees, chords, and progressions/cadences.\n\nLet's stay within in the context of a key signature of C Major, no sharps or flats.\n\nWhen we compare scale degrees in other modes, they are in comparison to the MAJOR scale intervals.\n\nC Ionian: C D E F G A B C\nJust major, but the characteristic note of Ionian/major is 4^ (scale degree 4 of C Ionian/major, so in C, this would be F) and ^7 (major 7)\nIt's characteristic chord would be V, Gmajor or even better G7 (dominant 7th)\nA characteristic cadence would be V - I\n\nD Dorian: D E F G A B C D -- very popular in pop music\nCharacteristic scale degrees would be b7 (C) and ^2 (E)\nCharacteristic dorian cadences: IV - i, i - ii\n\nE Phrygian: E F G A B C D E -- this is a pretty intellectual and serious sounding mode, mostly heard in jazz,\nCharacteristic scale degree ^b2 (F)\nCharacteristic cadences: II - i, vdim - i, vii - i\n\nF Lydian: F G A B C D E F ---this one is very popular in film music\nCharacteristic scale degree: ^#4 (B)\nCharacteristic cadences: II - I\n\nG Mixolydian: G A B C D E F G --- heard in a lot of \"medieval\" sounding music from medieval and Renaissance periods\nCharacteristic scale degrees: ^3 (B) ^7 (F)\nCharacteristic cadences: VII - I, v - I\n\nA Aeolian: --- again, heard in a lot of medieval era music and film music as well. This mode is also considered to be natural minor\nCharacteristic scale degrees: ^b3 (C) ^b6 (F)\nCharacteristic cadences: v - i, VI - i, iv - i\n\nB Locrian: B C D E F G A B -- similar to phrygian but there are a lot more complex functions going on here, which is why some theorists consider this not to even be a mode, and with the church modes, this one sounded to \"evil\" and it was hard for musicians back then to make this sound pleasing to the ear.\nCharacteristic scale degrees: ^b2 (C) ^b5 (F)\nCharacteristic cadences: ii - i(dim) V - i(dim)---yeah that one is sort of backwards, more of a retrogression, but like I said this mode has a lot of complex functions going on.\n\nRemember, these are all in the context of C Major's key signature, no sharps or flats. These scale degrees can also apply in any other key signature, but will have different notes.\n\nQuick example, in the key signature of G major (one sharp, F Sharp), dorian will now be A DORIAN:\n\nA Dorian: A B C D E F# G ----&gt; it has the same steps as D Dorian which I showed earlier.\n\nYou can also think of building these by their intervals: (W = whole step, H = Half step)\nDorian is: W H W W W H W, so on and so forth for the other modes.\n\nI hope this might help you understand why modes exist. Most people know of them, and what they are, but not too many of us know what they really are, how they are used and applied, and their importance to tonal harmony.\n\nIf anyone has anything else to add, that would be great, I just wanted to briefly introduce what the modes are.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365268528", "subreddit": "GameMusicComposition", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're right on with 1.1 and 1.2. For E(X), you will definitely need to first find P(X= 6,7,...) like you said. \n\nSo lets start with P(X=6). If you're having a hard time figuring it out, start with a concrete example. In order to get all 5 songs in 6, it means that one of the songs is repeated right? This is because after you account for all 5 songs being played once each, you have 1 extra spot left. So lets say A is played twice, so (without order taken into account) the songs played were A A B C D E. \n\nNow to take order into account, how many ways are there that these songs could be arranged? There are 6 elements with 2 repeated, so it's 6!/2!. However, the arrangement ABCDEA does not count since that would mean that you heard all 5 songs in 5, not in 6. Therefore the total number of ways to hear all 5 songs in 6, with A played twice, would be 6!/2! - 1. \n\nNow, A doesn't have to be the song that was played twice. It could have been B or C or whatever. There are 5 different songs that could have been the repeated song. Therefore you multiply what you got above by 5. All together, the number of ways to have all 5 dogs played in 6 songs is 5(6!/2!) - 1. \n\nTo find the probability of P(X=6) now you just need to find the denominator: the total number of ways to have 6 songs played. That would just be 5(4)^5 . \n\nFor P(7), its the same logic, but this time there are 2 extra spots after accounting for the 5 songs each played once. So either 1 song is played 3 times and the other 4 songs are played once (for example AAABCDE), or 2 songs are each played once (AABBCDE). Take each scenario separately to find the number if ways each of them could happen, then add then at the end.

{"body": "Ah-ha! Finally a story to contribute.\n\nSo, I had to ask my girlfriend to prom. We had been dating for two years and I was into spoiling her (first serious girlfriend-- I eventually learned) so I wanted to really outdo myself, also, it was going to be the last chance I had to do something like this for a high school dance. \n\nWhat has not already been done I thought? What could be romantic? Well, boat rides are romantic. Roses are romantic. Chocolate is romantic. Sparkling cider aka faux champagne is romantic. FIRE is romantic as fuck. Okay so maybe you can start to see where I get off track a bit.\n\nSo! Time to plan. After going through so many ideas I just start combining shit. I decide that the most badass thing to do would be would be if I could somehow get a sign lit up on the beach that says prom after I lure her out on an adventurous, spontaneous, and sexy night time boat ride (I lived across the street from a harbor and had a small row boat there). I think at the time about how epic that would all be.\n\nI make a sign out of cardboard (four pieces of cardboard, one for each letter) and I put it on a large wooden stick. I hide it behind a shed on the way down to the path. I instruct a buddy of mine where it is, along with a lighter and some lighter fluid to douse the sign in so it really goes up in epic fashion. I tell him that I will text him when we are in the boat and he can just come down set it up and light it whenever. Its dark out so he brings a flashlight. \n\nWhen the night finally arrives, I am freaking stoked. My girlfriend however, is not. Even in Spring, in the Pacific Northwest where I am from, it is really not that warm out. It often rains. Luckily, it is not raining which would have messed everything up completely, but it is a bit windy and a bit cold. No problem for me, I am obviously happy to go out and with all the complaining girls do about wanting more adventure in their lives, I did not think it would be an issue if I just seemed excited about it.\n\nBoy was I fucking wrong. SHE FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO NOT GO OUTSIDE. I finally convinced her, and then all of a sudden, she starts to realize we are walking towards the beach where a row boat is and she just straight up says, \"There is no way in hell I am getting into any boat.\" I am now just telling her to keep an open mind, and am thinking to myself... how the hell do I do this if she won't actually GET IN THE FUCKING BOAT?? Okay, so I just decide there is no other option and I beg and plead. We are clearly way past the honeymoon phase, she does not give a shit what I say, she is cold. Finally, she says I have 5 minutes. We paddle over to a log where I left a small cooler with two champagne glasses, martinelli's apple cider (it is high school, STFU), some chocolate, and a rose on top of it. She is still freezing, I try an open the cider and she tells me to can it, it is cold and she doesn't want to hold the glass. Finally, we are now rowing out into this damn body of water, it is windy and kind of rocky, and she is still PISSED. Then comes the fun part. My friend who cannot light a goddamn sign on fire WITH A FUCKING CONTAINER OF LIGHTER FLUID. How can you fuck up lighting cardboard on fire with a lighter AND lighter fluid? Smokey the bear would have been proud of him because this kid could not start a god damn forest fire if his life depended on it (best friend so its chill, we laughed about it later). Anyways, she sees this buffoon with a flashlight on the beach and obviously knows something is going wrong. We wait out there another 5 minutes and I CANNOT BELIEVE this thing has not lit up. Finally, she says she does not care at all about whatever it is supposed to be, we go back to the beach, I try my luck and after about 45 seconds the thing goes up in flames. She sees it, we all laugh about it, take a few bad pictures, the sign does not really spell out P R O M ? in flames like it is supposed to but it was good enough. The three of us walk back up to my house, have the cider and some chocolate, and she definitely had the best story to tell her friends the next day! --- Or at least I felt like I fucking did. She said yes at least!\n\n\nTL;DR Windy night-time boat ride, Non-flaming sign from the beach, total failure but doesn't matter, had sex.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365325313", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I could recommend the sidebar under \"recommended sites,\" but I actually like to explain theory information.  I figure, if I can explain it then I'll understand it better.\n\nSince you've learned Ionian, Dorian, and Locrian, I take it you've been studying diatonic modes.  If you're not quite sure, pentatonic (penta-5) scales have 5 notes between each octave, while diatonic modes have seven notes between each octave.\n\nSimply put, a mode is a scale of a particular key signature with a different root.  Since there are 7 notes between each octave in a diatonic scale, then there are 7 modes, one for each note.  Now understand that each scale doesn't play different notes; they are all the same, but just starting in a different position, on a different root of the key we're in.  Let's say that we decide to play in the key of G major.  That key is spelled G A B C D E F#.  The first mode is Ionian (which is standard major), and is played on the 3rd fret of the low E string (which is G).  The second note (or degree) in the scale is A, and the second mode is Dorian.  If we were in the key of G maj, we could identify the A as A Dorian.  The third mode is B Phrygian, 4th is C Lydian, 5th is D Mixolydian, 6th is E Aeolian (something quick about Aeloian; it is always considered the standard minor scale.  If someone says E minor, it actually means E Aeolian), and the 7th is F# Locrian.  All of these modes contain the same notes, but are just played with a different root, at different locations on the fretboard.  If you learn all of these modes, you'll see that they juxtapose each other on the fretboard.  Now taking this knowledge, if I were to say to you \"let's jam in G maj\" you would think to yourself \"G Ionian.\"  Since you have that mode memorized you know you can lay it over the G note on the 3rd fret and it would go along with whatever I was playing (assuming I was playing in G maj).  If I said let's jam in E minor, you would know to place the Aeolian mode over the E at the 12 fret.  Now here is where we get into relative majors and minors.  As I explained before, the key of G maj has a 6th note of E, and as I said before that 6th note (or degree as it would be called) is referred to as Aeolian (standard minor).  If I said \"let's jam in E minor\" then you could think of E Aeolian's relative major (which is G Ionian) and you would be able to play the Ionian mode with a root of G, even if I was playing an E minor backing rhythm.  The reason why this works is because all modes still share the same notes.\n\nNow, chords are spelled using the 1st, 3rd, and 5th degrees (notes) of the Ionian (major) or Aeolian (minor) modes.  If I said, play me a G maj chord, you would spell it G-B-D, which are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th degrees of the G Ionian mode.  If I said spell me G minor, then you would think G Aeolian, and you would spell it G-Bb-D.  \n\nHere's where knowledge of the circle of 5ths becomes important.  The circle of 5ths (Co5) is a device used to simplify the means of identifying how many accidentals (sharps or flats) that are in a respective key.  We always start on the key of C, which has no accidentals and is spelled C D E F G A B.  How the Co5 works is you take the *5th degree* of the scale, in this case being G, and you then move to that key, so we would move to G Ionian and then spell the mode - G A B C D E F#.  This spells the key of G.  We know that G maj has one accidental, F#.  Then we move to the *5th degree* (you can see why it's called the Co5), which is D.  We move to D Ionian and repeat - D E F# A B C#. Now this time we have another sharp - C#.  You might be able to see a pattern forming.  What you'll find is that as you go around the Co5, you add another accidental each new 5th.  The Co5 basically takes memorization.  You just have to sit down, grind it out, and commit it to memory.  After you go around the Co5, you'll hit C#, which has all sharps.  You might think that you're done, but there's actually a flat side to the Co5 (which is actually progresses not by every 5th degree, but by every 4th degree starting on F.  You'll have to read more about it to understand why).  Why is the Co5 important? Because it gives you knowledge of what notes are in the key you're playing in.  You'll know which notes you can, and which you can't play.  If I said, \"let's jam in G maj\" you'll know that you couldn't play F, and that you should play F# instead.  Knowing the Co5 also helps with a lot of theory later on.\n\nAfter this you would progress to memorizing how to spell all chords (maj, minor, diminished, half-diminished and fully-dimished), use that knowledge to learn inversions, etc, but you can find that at the websites.  If you can, I recommend getting an instructor, as he/she can create individualized lessons for your needs.

I'm trying to save you time by citing the relevant parts of the papers so you don't have to scan them yourself.\n\n&gt; No. Many of the changes in DNA that can be used to trace lineages and build trees are those in sequences that clearly have no function.\n\nAre you talking about the pseudogenes shared between species that have identical stop codons, such as gulo or vitellogenin?  If so, I disagree that these can only happen by common descent.  Rather, they can arise independently through mutational hotspots.  A few interesting studies:\n\n1.  The third row in figure 7 from [Purification and Properties of Wild-type and Exonuclease-deficient DNA Polymerase II from Escherichia coli](http://www.jbc.org/content/270/25/15327.long#F7) JBC, 1995, shows 4 lines of e coli independantly mutating the same 182bp deletion 4 times.  Another 317bp deletion was observed to evolve independently twice.  As the caption reads, \"Numbers in parentheses under 'Bases Lost' indicate the number of times the particular mutation was recovered.\" \n\nIn this study, they saw the same 7bp insertion happen in two unrelated families:\n\n1.  \"Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of a complex germline TP53 mutation in two unrelated families with different cancer phenotypes, neither fulfilling the classic criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The TP53 mutation consists of a duplication of 7 bp in exon 4, resulting in a frame shift and premature stop signal. Haplotype analysis indicated that the mutation arose independently in the two families. \n... \nTP53 sequence analysis of genomic DNA from family HON001 revealed a duplication of 7 bp (GTTTCCG) (c.329_330 ins7) affecting codons 108–110 in exon 4, which generated a frame shift and a premature stop signal at position 150\n...\nThe TP53 mutation observed in our Honduran pediatric ACT and Mexican breast cancer patients comprises a seven nucleotide duplication, affecting codons 108–110, resulting in a frame shift and premature stop codon at position 150. The observation that this complex mutation exists as different TP53 haplotypes in these two families, demonstrates that this mutation arose independently and suggests that this region of exon 4 is susceptible to genetic alterations.\" [An identical, complex TP53 mutation arising independently in two unrelated families with diverse cancer profiles](http://www.nature.com/oncsis/journal/v1/n2/full/oncsis20121a.html), Oncogenesis, 2012\n\nIn this one, humans and sheeps have pseudogenes caused by identical mutations believed to have arisen independantly:\n\n1.  \"Therefore the calculations confidently predict that the two related human and ovine [sheep] P2 pseudogenes of known sequence arose independently of each other from their respective P2 genes. It appears that the occurrence of a stop codon in exactly the same position in the sequences of both the human and ovine pseudogenes is coincidental.\"  [Evolution of the expressed P2 pseudogene and the origin of the P1 and P2 genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1134321/pdf/biochemj00108-0076.pdf), Biochem J., 1993\n\nIn a study of observed evolution in a bacteriophage virus, convergent substitutions were so common that the true phylogenetic tree would have been rejected.  However, unlike the previous studies, this was during adaption and not drift.\n\n1.  \"Replicate lineages of the bacteriophage ϕX 174 adapted to growth at high temperature on either of two hosts exhibited high rates of identical, independent substitutions. Typically, a dozen or more substitutions accumulated in the 5.4-kilobase genome during propagation. Across the entire data set of nine lineages, 119 independent substitutions occurred at 68 nucleotide sites. Over half of these substitutions, accounting for one third of the sites, were identical with substitutions in other lineages. Some convergent substitutions were specific to the host used for phage propagation, but others occurred across both hosts. Continued adaptation of an evolved phage at high temperature, but on the other host, led to additional changes that included reversions of previous substitutions. ... Phylogenetic reconstruction using the complete genome sequence not only failed to recover the correct evolutionary history because of these convergent changes, but the true history was rejected as being a significantly inferior fit to the data.\", [Exceptional Convergent Evolution in a Virus](http://www.genetics.org/content/147/4/1497.abstract?ijkey=e487ccd58dbed107369f16b5d05172c5bffb6657&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha), Genetics, 1997\n\nIn GULO, It looks like the deletions may have happened on a hotspot, since it varies so much in animals without the deletion:\n\n    Human      A C T G G G G A C A C T G * G A G G T C T A T G C C C C G T G G A\n    Chimp      A C T G G G C A C A C T G * G A G G T C T A T G C C C C G C G G A\n    Orangutan  A C C G G G G G C A C C A * G A G G T C T A T G C C C C G C G G A\n    Macaque    A A C G G G G G C A C C A * A G G G T C T A T G C C C C G C G G A\n    Guinea Pig A C C T G G G G C A C C G G G G G G C C T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Mouse      A C C C G A G G C A C C G A G G T G T C T G T G C G C C G A G G A\n    Rat        A C C C A A G G C A C C G A G G C G T T T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Dog        T C C T G A G C C A C C G C G G G G T C T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Cow        A C C C G A G A C A T C G C G G G G C C T G T G C C C C G A C G A\n    Pig        A C C C G A G G C A T C G G G C G G C C T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Chicken    A C C T G A G G T G T C G A G C G G T C G G T G C C C C G C G G A\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365452240", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Suppose that you want to set up a lemonade stand right in front of your house, which is located on a busy street. You decide to purchase a professional looking stand with a nice “Lemonade” sign for $75. To operate, you need to have lemonade, cups and ice.  According to your calculations, the cost of each cup of lemonade is about $0.50 (which includes the cost of the cup filled with store-bought lemonade and a couple of ice cubes). So, you set the price of each cup of lemonade at $1. \n\nBefore you start your business, you decide to enter this information in a well-designed spreadsheet to perform some calculations. You should set up the spreadsheet with the appropriate formulas to change the price, cost and sales volume quickly and answer the following questions:\n(a)\tWhat are your revenues, total expenses and profit if you sell 200 cups of lemonade? Print the results of this scenario. \n(b)\tWhat are your revenues, expenses and profit if you sell 150 cups at $0.75 each? Print the results of this scenario.\n(c)\tHow many cups of lemonade do you need to sell at $1 to make $100 in profits? (Determine the answer by entering different numbers in the appropriate cell until you get the desired result). Print the results of this scenario.\n(d)\tHow many cups do you need to sell at $1 to break even? Enter a formula to calculate the break even point.  Print the results of this scenario and print your formulas. (Hint: to produce a formula printout, you should switch your spreadsheet to formula view by pressing Ctrl ` and then print.

Fluid level is based on where it's at when the transmission pump is running, and the transmission pump is driven by the engine itself via the torque converter)\n\nPut the car in all ranges P R N D 3 2 1 (etc...)  then back into N, put the parking brake on and pop the hood\n\nPull the transmission dipstick, usually located near the firewall, wipe it with a paper towel or a clean rag and seat it full again and then pull it out gently, check the fluid against the mark. \n\nMake sure it's with in the acceptable range and NOT OVER. (you can check online regarding your particular transmission, for example, 4t65e's can be filled 1/8 -1/4  over the mark because acceleration can cause the sump to be uncovered. The real solution is a deeper pan with a deeper sump and a lot more fluid. But generally over filling is a very BAD idea and can cause problems in your transmission, like seal failure.)\n\nCheck it the same way after driving it for about 30-60 minutes depending on how hot it is outside. (you have to check it once the transmission has reached operating temp because the level will change, but it's generally OK to drive on if the level is acceptable when it's cold until you top it off the first time)\n\n\nNewer cars don't even have a transmission dipstick and fill tube they simply have a plug in the trans, for these, you may have to go to the dealer, or if you're feeling a bit DIY, you could retrofit a dipstick tube from an early version of that transmission.

I'm going to assume you're coming at this from a jazz/rock/similar perspective, not as someone trying to make sense of early music; if you're the latter, ignore everything I'm about to say.\n\nSo, a modern way to think of this is as follows:\n\n* A Dorian Scale with a given root note is made by taking the Major Scale with the same root note and lowering the third and seventh notes: 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7.\n* Therefore, if you take the D Major Scale (D E F# G A B C#) and lower the third and seventh notes you get the D Dorian Scale.\n* This gives the notes D E F G A B C (check this!). \n* Dorian scales sound cool! We'd like to learn them! But learning scales is boring and time-consuming.\n* By chance, if you like, those notes we just figured out happen to be the same notes as in the C Major Scale (C D E F G A B). We can, *if we want*, use this as a *shortcut* to learn the way Dorian scales lay out on a specific instrument, assuming we already know our Major scales.\n\nMy point here is to stress that for most purposes C Major is *not related* to D Dorian except via a handy trick to help us find the notes quickly. If you've learned your Dorian scales properly, the chances are you don't think of them as displaced Major scales any more -- you see them as things in their own right.\n\n[NOTE: I'm saying \"root note\" above, not \"tonic\". This is referring to the root of the current harmony, not the tonic. The description above makes sense even in situations where there's [no real functional harmony, and hence no obvious tonic](http://www.guitarcats.com/images/JazzStandardCharts/INNER%20URGE-229.jpg).]\n\n[EDIT: Add link]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365583595", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Nearly every community in America (less so now thanks to them no longer being allowed in schools) had a scouting troop, so chances were high that there's someone in your organization that looks at \"Eagle Scout\" and views it as a huge plus. It's not *incredibly* difficult to attain it, but it *is* quite the challenge and it *has* to be done before you turn 18. That shows that you are capable of completing a monumental task.\n\nI've heard that the military looks favorably upon it as well. The Scouts is a quasi-military organization as is, with ranks, commanders, outdoors skills, marksmanship, etc. Eagle Scout shows you can work within a structured system and excel, and the military loves that kind of shit.\n\nThere's [this survey](http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2012/04/10/new-study-shows-46-ways-eagle-scouts-are-different/) from the Scouting organization itself that compares Eagle Scouts to other people and the ways they are different.\n\nThere's also the the personal matter of being able to stay on a task and follow it through to the end. If you can get your Eagle scout, you will have better chances because you have better determination to handle a monumental task. You can't do a lazy, half-assed job and get your Eagle - you really have to work for it.\n\nAll of this aside, it would be viewed as an extracurricular just like stuff like \"Valedictorian\" or whatnot, and having more of those can never really hurt your résumé.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365610407", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Edit: It seems that Enhanced Music fixed their main post.  Good interview btw! \n\nI've re-formatted this to make it a little easier to read:\n\n#Enhanced Music took 10 minutes to sit down with Terry Da Libra to talk about the inspiration behind his latest release on Enhanced Progressive, 'Don't Give Up / Always Hope EP'. They also discussed future releases and his breakthrough onto the progressive trance scene. Here's what he had to say...\n\n\n\n**Hey Terry Da Libra! How are you? What's up and where are you reading this from?**\n\nHello there! I hope you're very well!\n\nI'm reading &amp; answering this wonderful interview with great pleasure from the balcony of my house, it's got a great view &amp; I have my gorgeous lady next to me! : )\n\n\n**Congratulations on your latest release on Enhanced Progressive, 'Don't Give Up / Always Hope', which is out now at Beatport! Can you tell the Enhanced readers a little bit about the EP and what inspired you to make it?**\n\n\nWell!... It's obvious that I love the ambient / atmospheric melodies in music, whatever the genre, whether it's from a film / movie / soundtrack or an EDM track. The inspiration might come let's say from things like a walk in the park / a story. Sometimes it just happens when tapping some ideas on my Vst(s) / Piano &amp; magic happens. Most of the time it really makes me wonder where that chord / idea came from. Also the whole idea behind my music composition is not supposed to make you feel sad with the atmosphere, it's always about positive emotions. I always want to hear from my audience once they have heard any of my tracks later on to see if they understand the title of the track. I don't know how many times I have achieved this, but if it's happening &amp; when it happens and it's really working for someone, it really makes me very happy!...\n\n\n**Can you explain the meaning behind the motivational track names?**\n\n\nFor sure! We've got the A side track titled as 'Don't Give Up, which is melodic from start to finish, &amp; as it is shaped &amp; wrapped with the adagio strings, I wanted to give the feeling of encouragement to the listener and most of us really need it a lot especially these days with all the crisis etc. It doesn't matter what will give you courage to achieve whatever you want to achieve, but what counts for you is to try your best &amp; don't give up!. Music can be a super combination &amp; a great ally if its coming along with emotion!. I like to express my feelings to someone &amp; feel positive when in a bad mood or situation! Sometimes though, you have to face a situation by yourself, even if you can't 'escape' it. The B side titled, 'Always Hope' is a bit more intense &amp; it's what you'd tell to someone to get them out of a frustrating moment! I don't know if I sound cheesy or not, but those are the titles that came immediately to my mind. You can also forget what I just said &amp; just hear both the tracks for your listening pleasure! : )\n\n\n**The track has had loads of support from some of the biggest names in Trance, including Armin van Buuren, Markus Schulz, Giuseppe Ottaviani and many more. How do you feel?**\n\n\nForgive me for my big excitement, but it's like being woken up from a lovely dream that you don't want to end and then discovering it was real! Getting this massive support from everyone &amp; the huge global names on the EDM scene, among those, the No. 1 DJ in the world, Armin Van Buuren, makes me feel hyped and super excited! I had the honour of him to choose my track, 'Don't Give Up' as his Tune Of The Week on ASOT episode 606! This overall support from everyone gives me the courage to go on! So I'd like to say a BIG thank you &amp; love to E v e r y b o d y for your massive support &amp; keep supporting your favourite artists / producers. YOU keep them alive through time!\n\n\n**What artists are you currently supporting and why?**\n\n\nBesides the big international names, there are a lot of great artists out there &amp; especially some who are a very young age! My props to them cause as I'm now 32 years old was really trying to make music from a young age. But I couldn't make my breakthrough on the scene due to my economic situation &amp; military service from when I was 18 to 20. However I gathered some money &amp; bought a Roland Groovebox 505 &amp; later on a 909 (while working 3 jobs for a summer), but I still couldn't afford a PC / Mac &amp; get myself started! 2009 / 2010 came &amp; it was my time! It's now 2013 and there are some things I have learned; EVERYONE deserves support if you really understand the time &amp; effort they're putting into their tracks! Every beautiful &amp; great composition deserves it!\n\n\n**For all the production nerds out there, what is your favourite piece of software / hardware studio gear and why?**\n\nM-Audio Fast Track Pro 2 soundcard, Altec Lansing speakers &amp; I'm working with Ableton Live 9 right now. Also Vst's such as, Sylenth1 - Predator - Fm8 - Albino - Zebra - Korg legacy - Rapture - Omnisphere, Minimoog - zeta+ &amp; some more Plus Izotope ozone 4 / Fub filters for mastering &amp; a bit of warm sound but not PRO. My label is doing the mastering process which is great! I don't always use the same Vst's cause I want to add a different variation &amp; sound on my synth structures most of the time, so I don't have a favourite atm.\n\n\n**What does Terry Da Libra have in store for 2013? Can we expect more originals and remixes?**\n\nI've got another amazing request from, Jaytech for a Guest mix this April. Once I saw the Email / Request, it was one of those unbelievable things that's happening in 2013. Thanks so much to David &amp; Jaytech (James) for this, much appreciated! Also, I've got some new originals &amp; a few of remixes. From now on I have to be VERY picky &amp; really careful about what I choose. Originals count much more than remix duties. It's really important to get your own music out there. You can still bother with remix requests if you really think it's worth it. I have some great collabs coming very soon, plus I'd really like to get some international gigs. It's my dream to travel around the world and play in front of people. There are so many great talents out there so it is difficult to achieve, but you always have to follow your dreams... Am I right? I hope to see everyone soon : )\n\n\n**What other music that isn't EDM are you listening to at the moment?**\n\n\nOldies Rock (60's, 70's, 80's) plus 90's, 2000's, Alternative Rock, Jazz, Soul, Funky, Ethnic, Ballads, Ambient, Chill out, Movie soundtracks, Electro pop &amp; whatever sounds good in my ears. As I said, no matter what the nationality or where it comes from! : )\n\n\n**Before we let you go, what is your favourite all time Prog-Trance classic?**\nWow!.. Good question.. But!.. I don't wanna disappoint you. I don't have 1, as I don't have only 1 favourite artist / producer. I was born in 1980 and really loved the 90's Trance age &amp; the beginning of 2000's. Mixed Compilations such as : Global Underground, Ministry of Sound, Renaissance etc. I only saw 4 Dj's in my life... John Digweed, Nick Warren, Dubfire (1/2 of Deep Dish) &amp; Chus, &amp; Ceballos... So much amazing &amp; memorable Trance &amp; Prog music at that time! : )\n\n\n**Finally, where can fans go to 'like' / 'follow' you and keep up to date with everything going on in the world of Terry Da Libra?**\n\nEveryone's very welcome &amp; I hope you'll stay &amp; enjoy or 'like' / love my work!

{"body": "I think this still looks disorganised, but I'd rather post it less-than-perfect than make you wait longer.\n\nI think I just wanted to be prodded to see if Freud is still being given credence and on the tip of another's tongue. Thank you. I am sad that it is.\n\nTo explain \"why the ego\" I have to go a little deeper into my belief system:\n\nMainly, I believe gov'ts and the media are just giant egos. Instead of being a collective of people for the advancement of our humanity they are failing so many of us with their worship of their own egos. They have put a system in placethat we're all born into and have no choice but to accept most of the time. \n\nWe have so much potential as human beings to change things, but, instead, we're all playing a game of Calvinball. Except, hey, about 99% of us are not Calvin. Excuse the tired expression. It just gets the job done is all.\n\nI believe the universe is a whole. As beings we are wholes, but we are also parts of this magnificent thing that we take for granted every day. I believe everything we can see and feel (and everything we can't) are parts of a whole we can't even fathom. Our actions have profound consequences on each other but we (humanity) don't care (predominantly). We don't see it but we are slowly destroying ourselves, each other, the planet and even trying to bring our destruction outside the planet because we're numbing ourselves to the connections with other beings (human and non-human animals). \n\nReal connections are scary because - duh - rejection. We fear getting close because it might mean that that interlocking with another person makes a person (the supposed \"I\") feel good; but this other person cannot be controlled like one's own actions and body. When a person we love is facing danger, we feel the danger ourselves. This is scary shit. It means at any time, a part of ourselves is in danger.\n\nThis is the start to feeling compassion. If one can feel a deep love for one's mother, sister, SO, best friend... Then why can't one feel a sense of love for a stranger that faces very similar plights across the ocean? If we know that we are more whole when together (look what humans can do together; good and bad) why do we still insist that we are so different from everyone else for a b c d e f or g? \n\nI think that the start to numbing is death and rejection. If someone close to us rejects us or dies we often fear connections with others because we cling to the idea that another person is part of the self. We often are so influenced by those around us that we become like them in some ways. Where did this completely intact \"self\" go?\n\nWhat I meant to just demonstrate in the previous paragraph is that every person is changed and molded by their environment. A child that is abused by their parents feels less secure about trusting anyone else in their lives. Where is the \"self\" here? Is it justifiable that this person should feel a sense of anger (perhaps their whole lives) towards people she thinks are like her parents because she/he never had the support and knowledge to know her parents were assholes? \n\nIf an environment has a lot of propaganda, well, then, any person may grow to hate a certain race/gender/whatever in their environment because they are constantly being told to. They are often given reasons as to why that group is to be hated; many can be verified. Instead of forgiveness or more peacetalks between the country the war continues with the propaganda that hits the children that weren't even there when x did z to y.\n\nI guess propaganda isn't the worst of it. If a gov't doesn't take care of its people, well, Lots of shit things can happen. Just look at the mental health systems in the US and Canada. they're terrible. People are comitting suicide in higher numbers because there is just no support available. That doesn't seem to matter to the media unless it can be sensationalised. It is not a sensational thing to ponder death over living the pain, though.\n\nThe media tells us there are all these dangers out there. There are no dangers but the lack of compassion and understanding in our world today. Those are our real dangers. Looking at each other comparatively as if one person or choice is better than another. This judgment does no good. We need to start valuing each other.\n\nWe bring new people into new gov'ts of tyranny that are lovingly massaged by the media and big corporations. People have less of a chance to grow into a proper human being because everything is so forceful, short and catchy: Except for school. School, in particular, is forceful. \"sit down\" \"shut up\" \"answer this problem\" \"why didn't you do your homework.\" etc. We are forced to numb ourselves and get the work done or face shunning from the population around us, most likely. For what? To become older citizens that shut up and get their work done because \"they're lucky to have a job.\"\n\nWe are so cruel to each other about each other's plights; for some people it is a game to see who has been hurt more in this life. \n\nA lot of times instead of being compassionate to each other, we numb ourselves and look at another text or emAil. We don't reach out for each other as much, real time, to say \"hey, I noticed over the years that you're always on time when we hang out. That's fucking awesome time management\" or \"I appreciate that when you do the dishes you search the house to make sure you got them all.\" We all need to know that we are making an impact by being respectful and helpful to each other instead of cold and detached.\n\nThe more detached we become to each other, the more the world is like a world of self-hating, other-hating automatons.

{"body": "it really depends on the situation.\n\nfor things like dragon or blue buff/drag/baron I just do qeqwqrqeqwq. I really don't think you'll be given a situation where you can utilize his passive against a champion because of his chasing problems and you have to be fairly close to nuke someone down like that. I do run ms quints and utility masteries for strength of spirit, the added mana, the 6%cdr (plus the 4 from the offensive tree) and the move speed at 21 points. all of that works really well on Ryze.\n\nI mean the thing about Ryze is there are many uses for his spells and especially his ultimate. I generally go qe qw and not qw qe because like the mr shred on his e. Sometimes you just have to cast w first in which case you need to blow your r early so that you can continue your combo later. like w q r q e q w q etc.\n\nAbout his ult, in a team fight if we have a hard engage like Jarvan or Amumu I will do my best to q e q w q r asap so that I can get more spells off during the aoe duration, but by that time the extra damage on muramana is getting lower and lower, so some times it's best to pop r sooner and have to wait a few seconds for cds during the fight, which could be a problem.\n\nThere is a lot to think about which is why I think all the comments about how easy he is to play are a bit misplaced because I feel like there is a lot you can do with him and some people fail to realize that. I really love Ryze tho &lt;3. It took me forever to get good with him so that i could survive his brutal lane, because he really only scales with items while most ap mids scale harder with levels. and since his ult ads no extra dps he is at a disadvantage to typical ap mids.\n\n\nI can talk all day about Ryze but **tldr: q e q w q r q e q w q &lt;wait 2 seconds&gt; q e q w q &lt;wait 2 seconds &gt; q e q w q etc. is my favorite combo if my enemy is realllllly stupid and loves to stand still.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365645265", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I made a [new gimbal just for mech piloting for a Thrustmaster Cougar](http://imgur.com/a/ixi64)(descriptions in album), that is installed in [my current mechpit.](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/111003-mechpit-ii-a-practical-approach/page__p__2198157#entry2198157). My stick works fantastically, and IMO was well worth the effort of constructing it, but short of this level effort the answer is no.\n\nUnfortuntately 99% of what people say about sticks is true, but usually their reasoning behind why is not correct. In short what it breaks down to is not that a *joystick* is poorly suited for MWO, it's that an *airplane* joystick is poorly suited for MWO, which is unfortunately the only kind of joystick one can buy at the moment. The problem has everything to do with the opposing design criteria of a stick that controls something that moves like a mech/tank which was designed around/benefits from *unrestricted absolute inputs* vs flying an aircraft, which is in turn designed around/benefits from *restricted relative inputs*. Short of making a stick with a gimbal suited for this task, no level of support on PGI's end will do anything change what is the larger underlying fundamental problem.\n\nThat problem is not digital, it's mechanical, and much harder to work around. The digital problems are actually super easy (no, really) to work around for anyone using TARGET (Thrustmaster's kick ass kbm emulator for the Cougar, Warthog, or T16000 sticks, which yes I have scripts for if anyone needs...). Anyone that wants to explore this to it's fullest themselves should pick up a Thrustmaster T16000 ($40) since it is the fastest/cheapest ticket for sailing right past all the little technical hurdles that keeps most of this stuff shrouded in mystery and confusion.  \n\nThe stick I built specifically addresses the mechanical shortcomings that all airplane joysticks share plus since it runs TARGET, among many other incredibly useful things, allows me to use absolute inputs and have a very fine degree of control over the exes (including on-the fly sensitivity changes just like any mouse worth it's weight) which since my gimbal was designed to utilize from the very start -works out really well. Again I reiterate -this is not the norm- and much effort was required to do this.  \n\n**-attributes** (effects)  \n\n**Airplane stick:** \n\n**-moves in pitch/rol**l (unnatural range of motion, not reflexively intuitive)  \n**-spring centering, most likely with detents** (fights inputs, negative interactions across the axes center's)  \n**-requires deadzones** (distracting, imprecise, disconnected feeling between inputs and in-game reactions, wasted range of motion)  \n**-uses relative inputs** (mech movements wind up either too slow or uncontrollable, difficult to not to overshoot past target, combined with the first 3 problems adds up to a non-viable control option)   \n\n**Mouse:**  \n\n**-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane** (natural range of movement of the reticule)  \n**-has no spring centering or detents** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted movement)  \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across centers no different than any other point in x/y)   \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)     \n\n**My stick:**  \n\n**-moves in zenith/azimuth** (pitch/twist -natural range of movement of the mech)  \n**-no spring centering/detents, but has tensioned/greased rubs** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted smooth damped movement, holds position when not being moved therefore maintains physical orientation related to on-screen state)   \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across center no different than any other point in x/y)  \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)  \n\nFor anyone that doesn't understand the significance of RELATIVE vs ABSOLUTE, here is an analogy: Picture a 12\" square sheet of glass and a marble sitting on it. Using relative inputs is like trying to move the marble by picking up the sheet of glass with the marble balanced on it and tilting it front/back and side/side, quickly leveling it again when it's where you want it to be in x/y coordinates. Using absolute inputs however would be like placing the same piece glass level on a desk in front of you and using your hand to reach out and directly move the marble wherever you want on the plane, and for this reason are also called direct inputs.  \n\nJust like piloting a mech with relative inputs is ... less than optimal, so is piloting an aircraft using absolute inputs. These are just not interchangeable design criteria, and the peripherals used to operate these vertial craft need to be specifically suited for the input type or the results are, well quite predictably precisely what is being experienced and shared by users that made it through the technical challenges and managed to get their airplane stick to work with MWO with as dialed-in of settings as possible. Some adapt to it, but mostly by piloting s l o w heavies or assaults, since with relative inputs you have to balance reaction speed vs accuracy, achieving neither in the process. You can get away with it in an Atlas, but not a Commando...   \n\nedit: I was asked a very good question in a pm, but it's relevant and I feel added to this comment as an edit is the most appropriate place to put it:  \n\n\n\n &gt;&gt;**Q:** I believe I understand what you are calling \"relative\" and \"absolute\". When controlling an aircraft, you control the rate of change on each axis while for a mech you control the absolute change/displacement, hence the need for the different joystick.  \n\n&gt;&gt;However, the actual input for the joystick is absolute by default and for a mouse it is relative as discussed [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee418779%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) and [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee418270%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). I just think some might benefit from clarification on how devices report their input versus how software interprets the input given.  \n\n&gt;**A:**  Ahh, thank you for the challenging question. It's hard to find siolid information on the subject, so I'm left with what I've already gathered, what I can find, combined with observations of what I've seen. It's also entirely possible that I'm misusing my terminology, but am nevertheless going to continue my process of trying to get to the *actual bottom of this.  \n\n&gt;From what I can tell, what we are talking almost amounts to semantics since these days since input types have grown in complexity and the standards for processing these signals has grown along with it. It's true, that from a electrical perspective a joystick is an absolute device in that it uses absolute positional information to generate it's electrical signals. However, from a mechanical standpoint they are almost all designed to be used to generate relative inputs, so they are engineered accordingly. As such, they have spring centering, deadzones, and likely detentes of sorts at the centers.  \n\n&gt;It's correct to say it's an absolute device, since internally/mechanically it is. It's also correct to say it's a relative device as well however, since by default that is what it does when you plug it in and use it and was designed from the ground up to be optimized around these specific parameters. Yes it's possible to swap how the computer uses it's absolute information, but so long as the stick is mechanically engineered around relative commands as the desired outcome there is little advantage to be gained since at it's very core of design it's a relative device, despite electronically using absolute positional information to derive outputs and technically being an absolute device.  \n\n&gt;This is why I call it a relative device, since by default it generates proportional directional-velocity commands that are relative to the displacement from the center and is perfectly capable if infinite output despite the electrical signals being generated internally by absolute positional data.  \n\n&gt;The mouse is admittedly more of a mystery to me and I find myself learning more about them all the time, but until recently have largely ignored them. To best get into the mouse I suppose I need to start differentiating between relative velocity vs relative positional inputs, and the difference between inputs vs behavior is equally important here. A mouse's sensor inputs are relative, and the output also relative, but relative positional and this delta is continually added globally to the cursor's current position. The resulting *behavior of this process is absolute positioning of the cursor, opposite of how a joystick generates absolute information with it's sensors but it's turned turned into relative (velocity) commands as it's normal behavior.  \n\n&gt;This is why I say it's almost semantics. The behavior of a joystick is relative inputs, the behavior of a mouse is absolute. However the way the information is derived is sort of opposite of the behaviors in thes cases, so depending on which part of the process one is looking at, both are technically correct.  \n\n&gt;tl;dr: in addition to different types of relative inputs, there is a difference between input type and behavior, and depending on which part of the process is being described can make a 180deg difference!

{"body": "The other two comments don't say much, so i'll try to be a bit more clear for you.  runes you can do mostly what you want, mp5/mana in your book however is stupid.  personally i like magic pen reds, hp yellows, magic resist blues, movement spell vamp or spell pen quints.  From there you want to level q w q e q r, with emphasis varying by game.  if their team feels like they're focusing you, or you're fighting a lot of melees, leveing your W over E could be good, but on the other hand your E will put out more damage in a team fight.  going into lane I would suggest you start with the faerie charm, 1 ward, and as many red pots as you can.  depending on how well you're farming (his auto attack animationd kind of sucks to last hit with, you'll get used to it), you might want to back early to finish your tear.  If you're doing really well in your lane, you'll be better off just staying to farm.  Otherwise back right around 6:40, buy tear, another ward or two, some more pots, and go take your blue buff if your jungler is nice enough to allow you.\n\nRyze is great at the poking trading game, his only real weaknesses are enemies who can out range him such as lux, or somebody who can out trade him such as potentially cassie.  If the enemy does NOT have a reliable poke, you should play aggressively dropping your Q on them as often as possible, your full combo if possible is Q W E  and then Q again as it should be off cooldown due to your passive.  But if you can, just spam Q at the enemy as often as possible.  after Tear there are several build paths you can do, i like grabbing level 1 boots, and then a catalyst as fast as possible. Ryze is a fantastic roamer, and you should start doing so.  especially with your passive, you can nuke hard with relative saftey in ganks and team fights.  You can turn your Catalyst into 1 of 2 things.  RoA if you're doing well, Banshees if you're not.  After RoA you should build something tanky.  Look at their team, look whats likely to do the most damage to you.  Usually armor comes first, as bruisers are who will be charging you.  I would suggest Frozenheart, but I have seen spell fist a few times.  From here, build what it looks like you need. seirously, it'll change every game.  Abyssal, Rylais, Rabadons, there are a ton of options for you.\n\nAs for team fights from mid game on.  Once the fight starts you should ONLY attack whats in range, you're a valuable high priority target and dont over extend unless you're confident in yourself and your team to keep yourself alive.  mid game nobody should have enough magic resist yet to be able to stand up against your damage for long.  Start with your R, and then cast your spells as they come off cooldown.  after a certain point in the game i've had the fights last long enough taht i could actually cast my R twice in one fight thanks to passive.\n\nIf you have any thing more specific i'll try to address that", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365709390", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So the font is indexed using a two-byte UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode code points?\n\nThat's a rather bizarre design choice. I suppose it might be more efficient to look up UTF-8 bytes than decode them into UCS-2 or re-encode as UTF-16, so it could make sense in this context. Being unable to go above U+07FF is really rather unfortunate, though. For reference, on [this handy map](http://i.imgur.com/saP9Gbv.png) of the basic multilingual plane – where almost everything lives (with the notable exception of most emoji) – we can get halfway through the first row with this encoding scheme before we run out of space.\n\nA change to UCS-2 would superficially seem fairly trivial and would grant access to the entirety of that, though still lock us out of anything in Unicode outside the BMP (see aforementioned emoji, for instance).\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I looked through your research – and I cannot agree with your conclusion. Your own scripts output a number of characters that are not in the U+0000 – U+07FF range that can be encoded in two bytes of UTF-8. For instance, U+220F N-ARY PRODUCT (∏), which encodes in UTF-8 as the three-byte sequence 0xe2, 0x88, 0x8f. In the Pebble files it's given as the two-byte sequence 0x0f, 0x22 – which is U+220F in a little-endian UCS-2 encoding.

{"body": "&gt;Now, if skill is the prevailing factor, there should be high consistency among the very best players.\n\nThere is, but I think you're now underestimating the amount of luck that factors in and how you measure consistency.  It could be 70% skill and almost a third of the games could still be determined by luck.  \n\nMagic Championships are a bad set of data to draw conclusions from.  There's only ONE winner in the tournament.  A player can be highly consistent, doing well, without winning the entire thing.  What if we looked at the top 8 every year and for four years straight they looked like this:\n\nA B C D E F G H  **winner**: H    \nB D F H J L N P  **winner**: B    \nA B D J N R S **winner**: D  \nB C D J N S T **winner**: T  \n\nLooking at those four years, there have been four different winners.  No repeat winners.  However, look at the top 8 players from year to year.  B has made top 8 every year.  So has D.  A made it twice, as did F and S.  J and N made it there 3 out of 4 years.  Out of a possible 32 different people, there have been 15 unique names present.  \n\nThis is actually amazingly consistent from year to year, only the top place finisher changes dramatically.  About 40% of the top 8 does NOT change from year to year (in *my* example).  \n\nWe've seen Jon Finkel and Luis Scott-Vargas have some amazing years with incredible consistency, even if they don't win most of the tournaments they play in.  \n\nWhen we did have ELOs, many of the top rated players got up there and maintained their ELO - something that only happens if you are very consistent, winning that can't be explained unless skill plays a major component.  \n\nAll of this doesn't matter, though.  At least not to the original post.  His friend isn't a pro player and he's likely inconsistent.  Moreover, he probably doesn't play enough games to draw a statistically meaningful conclusion from and personal observations without hard, raw data are subject to confirmation bias.  You're less likely to attribute wins to luck than you are losses.  You remember that time you got mana screwed more than that time when your opponent drew four spells and 0 creatures.  You could win 5 games and lose one to bad draws and focus on that one loss.  And these 6 games aren't enough to do number crunching.  \n\nThere's a line from a television series I love where someone asks him about a poll that shows him down by 20% (60% to 40%).  He points out that in a poll of (sample size) 10, if you can change one mind, it's a dead heat (5 to 5).  Change two minds and it's a landslide victory 4 to 6).  \n\nIf you look at the pro tour from tournament to tournament to tournament, the same names keep popping up and as someone pointed out in another place, there are people like Jon Finkel who have an amazing number of top 8 finishes at high level events.  It isn't all luck.  Most of that is skill.\n\nBut, sometimes it IS bad luck.  In the long run, though, everyone has some bad luck and you can't change that without changing the game itself or playing something with less luck.  You can only change how you play and if you get better or not.  \n\nThe first step that is trying to figure out what you did wrong and what you can fix to be a better player and then win more.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365815458", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Think of the Chinese workers PETA often condemns. They need the tools, training, and eduction to do their jobs in a way that will prevent unneeded suffering.

{"body": "OK I'm gonna run with the \"like I'm five\" bit.\n\nImagine 4 kids line up to play a game.  (Freddy, Bobby, Suzy, and Ricki).   The teacher whispers something in Freddy's ear, Freddy in Bobby's, Bobby to Suzy, Suzy to Ricki, Ricki picks something new to say back to Suzy in reverse back to the teacher.\n\nSo the order (by first initials) is T F B S R S B F T\n\nWhile playing the game, each kid has a few rules:\n\n* Freddy writes down everything Bobby tells him before telling it back to the teacher.\n* Bobby throws a fit and won't tell Suzy anything that is about vegetables\n* Suzy will add the word \"super\" in front of the words \"fast\" or \"slow\" in messages Ricki gives back to her before telling Bobby.\n* Ricki picks all new messages by selecting a random sentence from the last Harry Potter book.\n\nOK so to map the kids to an application stack, Freddy, Bobby and Suzy can be thought of as middleware:\n\n* Freddy is a logger/auditor (https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/commonlogger.rb)\n* Bobby is a filter (https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack)\n* Suzy is tweaking outbound content (see https://github.com/leehambley/rack-google-analytics for example)\n* Ricki is Rails, the book is the database.\n\nNow I'm gonna do some handwaving...in a Rails setup you *can* give all the middlewares access to the database, but don't think about that for now.  It complicates the core points, plus it's not usually the best use of Rack anyway.\n\nFocus on this part:  Freddy, Bobby, and Suzy all have their own rules.  They don't have to have access to the book or know Ricki's rules for picking random sentences from the book.  They don't even have to know the book Ricki is holding.  In fact, they don't have to know each other's rules either, they just do their own and know how to talk to their neighbors.  This is essentially rack:  all the kids speak a common language and pass messages to their neighbors.  That includes Ricki (Rails).\n\nThe cool part about this is, you can change the rules by adding or removing kids.  Say you don't want \"super\" getting added to messages:  just bench Suzy.  Or, imagine you want to add the rule \"the word 'homework' can only occur 5 times in the whole game\".  So you tell Harry the rule, give him a pencil and pad to keep track, and tell him to stand between Bobby and Suzy.\n\nIf you want more of an idea of what rack middlewares can do, check out https://github.com/rack/rack/wiki/List-of-Middleware for a short list.\n\nAlso checkout [rack-parser](https://github.com/achiu/rack-parser) since I think it's a good example.   It allows you to have a Rack app (think, Sinatra) and make json body params available as params without having to parse them in your Sinatra application.  This keeps the behavior small, reusable, and replaceable.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365869350", "subreddit": "rails", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

Like [this](http://i.imgur.com/kgacuIc.gif). That shows one octave. To play a C major scale, you play each one of those white keys (moving to the right) until you get to the C above it (one octave above). So you play C D E F G A B and then C (the higher one).\n\nOn the keyboard it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/2ixkVuH.gif).\n\nBut you see all those black keys you skipped? Without spending days explaining it (poorly), each note is a certain \"distance\" apart from the next one. It's not an even distance in any scale, and it's not an even distance in a major scale.\n\nA minor scale starts on that same C, but this time we play it differently. This time we play C D E♭ (a black key) F G A♭ (black key) B♭ (black key) and the higher C. We're not playing all the same keys, so the spacing between the notes changes, and this changes the quality of the scale, making it a minor scale. We start and end on the same notes, but we change the pattern somewhat.\n\nOn the keyboard, the minor scale looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/x2NchRi.gif).\n\nYou can change this even further and get variations on minor scales, with different sounds.

Here's a visual of the 2104s:\n\n    fex-1# show platform software redwood sts\n    Board Status Overview:\n     legend:\n            ' '= no-connect\n            X  = Failed\n            -  = Disabled\n            :  = Dn\n            |  = Up\n            ^  = SFP+ present\n            v  = Blade Present\n    ------------------------------\n    \n            +---+----+----+----+\n            |[$]| [$]| [$]| [$]|\n            +---+----+----+----+\n              |    |    |    |\n            +-+----+----+----+-+\n            | 0    1    2    3 |\n            | I    I    I    I |\n            | N    N    N    N |\n            |                  |\n            |      ASIC 0      |\n            |                  |\n            | H H H H H H H H  |\n            | I I I I I I I I  |\n            | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  |\n            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+\n              - | | | | : | |\n             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n             |-|v|v|v|v|v|v|v|\n             +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n    Blade:    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\n\nYou can run these commands on your UCS as well - just do the following:\n\nF340-31-16-UCS-2-B# connect iom x\nfex-1# show platform software redwood sts\n\nWhere X is your chassis number.  In this case since I was logged into FI B I connected to the IOM in chassis 1 on the B side.\n\nThis command is a little cluttered, but the box in the middle (labeled ASIC 0) is the IOM.\n\nAs you can see here there are 2 side on the ASIC - the NI (network interface or upstream to the Fabric Interconnect) and the HI (Host interface or downstream to the blades).   Because the IOM itself only has 1 10gb link down to the blade you cannot ever get more then 10gb/fabric with a 1st generation IOM.\n\nWhen we designed the chassis we knew that the IOM would only have 1 10gb backplane port to each blade, however we also knew that in the future we would try to add more.  Thus the chassis has 4 10gb links between each IOM and blade.  The goal here was to design the chassis such that it wouldn't need to be upgraded anytime soon and it shows.  The chassis is the only piece of original equipment not to have a second generation design out now.\n\nWhen it came time to develop the second generation hardware (6248 and 6296 Fabric Interconnects, 2204 and 2208 IOMs, and the 1240/1280 VIC cards) we worked on increasing the bandwidth to the blades  With the 2208s we added the additional 3 interfaces between each IOM and the blade.

Since each blade now has 4 interfaces/IOM we split these interfaces between these 2 slots - thus 2 HI's are presented to the MLOM and 2 are presented to the Mezz.  \n\nThe reason you cannot use the 2104 with a Mezz card is that there is no connectivity between the mezz card slot and the IOM - the only interface the 2104 has to the blade is presented to the MLOM slot.  Thus the only way to get more then 10gb/fabric and to use the mezz card slot is to use the new hardware.\n\nIf anyone has questions about this please feel free to ask!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366040474", "subreddit": "Cisco", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here is my detailed flight mechanics post:\n\n&gt;**Okay, the following is a detailed description of flight mechanics, I may reiterate some things already posted, for completion sake. . .**\n\n&gt;Once you place a saddle on the gryphon it will be tied to your player, no other player can ride it, and it will go offline when you do (so people don't kill it to grief you). At this point you can do three thing: Right click it with meat to feed it, right click it with anything else to toggle sit/stand (like a wolf, it follows when standing, but it walks slowly), or right click on the saddle to mount it. If you allow it to follow you, it will walk behind you, and fly if if it falls behind.\n\n&gt;So, you right click the saddle, what now? You are sitting on the back of your gryphon, arrow keys will let you walk around slowly, double tap W too jump forward (combine with a flap to get more distance).\n\n&gt;But really, you want to fly. \n\n&gt; * Flapping: When you press down the space bar your gryphon will spread its wings and flap them down, it will continue the downward motion only while the space bar is held, releasing it will allow your gryphons wings to raise up. You must hold it through the whole flap to get maximum thrust.\n\n&gt; * Gliding: If you held the spacebar after a flap, the wings will only raise up half way, and they will stretch out wide. If you have enough speed/altitude this will let you glide, if you are launching from a high place you can simply glide downwards, rather than flapping a bunch to gain speed.\n\n&gt; * Falling: If you are not on the ground, and not holding space, your gryphon will raise its wings high. This allows air to pass by slowly, and you will fall gently towards the ground. Your gryphon is not stupid, so it will not let you crash unless you do something stupid.\n\n&gt; * Thrust: Thrust comes from flapping, but a single flap is not going to get you as much thrust as you need to take off. You will need to keep flapping, and optimize your timing. Since holding space bring the wings down, and then back up to the sides, you must press and hold space until the flap is complete to get the full possible thrust. Then, you need to release space, and allow the wings to raise up into the \"falling\" position, and then flap again. While this is not a requirement, you will get far more thrust if you do full flaps. Half flaps (from flapping from glide position) are a good way to keep up momentum during a glide, but you will need the full flaps to take off from the ground.\n\n&gt; * Wing angle: Space bar controls flapping, the W A S D keys control the angle of the wings. W angles them down/forward, S andgles back, A and D angle them opposite each other (A: left down, right up. D: left up, right down). This causes role/banking, witch lets you turn, basically A and D let you turn. Flapping while holding one of the W A S D keys will cause thrust in that direction. With W flapping will thrust you forward (no keys basically only gives you upwards thrust), accelerating you. S will cause the flap to come forward, giving reverse thrust, to slow you down (or fly slightly in reverse when taking off). Flapping with A or D will tighten the turn.\n\n&gt; * Mouse control: If, and only if, the W key is held you gryphon will fly in the direction you are pointing the mouse. Like a boat, the turning will not be instant, in fact it will be much slower. Pointing up or down will cause you to climb or dive (respectively), left or right turning. Mouse control only works with the W key is held, this is so that you can look around freely (use a bow perhaps) while flying.\n\n&gt; * Turning: I have already mentioned two ways to turn, but here is the in depth part. Holding W and looking will cause a very slow turn, holding A or D (whatever direction you wish to turn) will cause you to bank in that direction, this makes the turn much tighter. Using both turning methods at the same time is even better, and causes you to bank much more. If, once you have banked to the maximum level, then flap the wings you will turn drastically in that direction, though you will lose a lot more speed than you would in a normal turn. \n\n&gt; * Tucking the wings: By holding shift your gryphon will tuck its wings, you will now lose a lot of altitude, while gaining a lot of speed. This can be used to dive at enemies, or simply to increase accelerate quickly. You have very little control when doing this, basically limited to looking up to minimize falling, or down to maximize it. Turning is not very good. Note: When you release shift the wings will return to the \"falling\" position, unless you hit space to flap. Continuing to hold space through the tuck, or simply beginning to held it before releasing shift will let the wings return to \"glide\" position, without performing a flap.\n\n\n&gt;**So, what dose this all mean? Lets look at a few common situation:**\n\n&gt; * Take off: You will press and hold space until your wings have gone down, and raised back part way (you are now a meter or two up), then release it to allow them to raise fully. You now repeat this until you reach the desired height. Now you will press W, and continue flapping to gain speed. If you also want more altitude, you can aim up, and continue to flap. For more speed you can angle down, and gravity will assist you.\n\n&gt; * Diving/Attacking: The only way for your gryphon to attack is with a head on melee at high enough speed. The obvious way to do this is to dive at the opponent. From high in the air, you will hold W and Space, line up your attack, then angle down. Then you will hold shift, causing you to descend rapidly, when you are near the ground/opponent release shift and angle your mouse even to the horizon (still holding space) and your wings will spread wide. This causes a great amount of lift, due to your speed, and with your angle at the horizon you will level out mostly. At this point you will collide with the opponent, and you will be rapidly losing speed, and also lift. You will now begin flapping and angle upward, to regain altitude. You may need to circle around and attack again to kill the opponent.\n\n&gt; * Evasive Maneuvers: For whatever reason, you are about to hit something, and you need to turn now. All you need to do is Hold W + A or D depending on direction, and point the mouse that way. Then, at the optimal moment to turn, you will flap once. \n\n&gt; * Emergency landing: You just realized that you are very close to where you wish to land, but you are going far too fast! Simply hold S, and flap, this will slow you down, and allowing extra delay between flaps will also let you descend. Once you are slow enough, simply allow yourself to fall.\n\n&gt; * Archery: So diving is risky, so why not use your bow? Simply Hold space to glide, but do not hold W. You will not be able to accelerate very much, as flapping without W just gets you more altitude, but you can glide for a good distance like this. A and D can be used to turn left/right. You are now free to look around and shoot arrows, but you can not adjust your pitch, as that can only be done with the mouse (holding W). If you do hold down W, your gryphon will begin to turn wherever you are looking, which could mean that its head would get in the way of your shot (you would shoot your friend!).\n\n&gt; * Air combat: So the enemy is flying too? Well you can do three things:\n *  Charge at them, and inflict melee. This may work, but remember that if you hit each other head on you both take damage. The knock back also has a chance of dismounting the player, possibly resulting in death-by-falling.\n *  Archery\n *  Use your sword! You can fly up next to them, and smack the enemy/their gryphon with your sword. Knockback again may dismount them.\n\n\n\n&gt;This is just some of the things you could do, if you have any specific situations in mind, I can try to describe the method you would use.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366067239", "subreddit": "minecraftsuggestions", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For a slightly more technical response. The fibre itself is pretty passive, it is engineered in such a way that light in a certain frequency range will travel along the fibre rather than try to escape out of the sides. This is pretty much a pure physical phenomenon.\n\nHow you shine a light into the fibre is what changes, and where the speed gains come from. Higher quality equipment is able to send multiple wavelengths of light at the same time, and is then able to split it back out into those different wavelengths at the other end, which allows for multiple signals at the same time.\n\nThe light emitters and receptors can also be improved so that they are able to electrically switch on and off faster, which allows you to send more signals over the same amount of time.\n\nOther techniques revolve around how you distinguish the on off state of each channel. This can be done by altering the amplitude (strength) of the signal, or by slightly altering its wavelength, or by altering the phase of the signal. These can be combined to pack more information into any one signal.\n\nSo, at first you could have a simple light that turns on and off. Then you could increase the sensitivity to have four states, off, dark, medium, bright. Then you could split it into four phases of high rising, high falling, low falling, low rising. These combine to give you 16 states for each signal. Then you could reduce the signal time to be able to send more signals per second. Then you can start using multiple wavelengths at the same time to do all of this over the red and blue, then R G B, then R Y G C B V.\n\nSo instead of say a single on off each second, you could have 10 per second sending any of 16 signals on each of 6 channels. This would send 480 times as much information as just a single on off each second.\n\nOh, another possibility is that if you send the light using a fine laser pointed at a specific angle into the fibre it can then also come out at a particular angle at the other end. This allows you to send multiple streams of each of multiple channels at the same time.\n\nA lot of the theory behind this actually comes from WiFi technology, since they're both based on EM radiation. Fibre has a _huge_ advantage though because it is in a controlled environment with virtually no background noise and negligible signal loss over distance. This allows for very sensitive equipment to be used, and the ability to detect very tiny variations in the signal.\n\nThe numbers I have given are quite small. Actual tech available now will split the light into 80 wavelengths for example, not 7 colours in the visible spectrum (it is actually not visible at all, it's well into infrared).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366096793", "subreddit": "australia", "score": 30, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can never overestimate musical context. If I saw C E G A in a Classical era Mozart piece, I'd say it's a first-inversion 7th chord just because the concept of an added-sixth chord really didn't exist back then, or really for most of the common practice era. Chords were measured strictly in thirds (tertian harmony), so a triad with a sixth on top wouldn't make much sense. Seventh chords in inversion, however, do make sense, so that's how we would analyze it there. On the other hand, in jazz, the idea that a chord can get \"inverted\" without changing the fundamental aspects of it is much less prominent because jazz is very interested in harmonic color and inversion changes color. It's much more common to hear all harmonies coming up from the bass, and in reality a lot of the fake books you'll read are chock full of what you'd recognize as root position chords with extensions. The same is true for a lot of pop music, which again is based mostly on root position harmonies. So in these circumstances I would call a C E G A chord a C6 chord. There are of course exceptions; I know the French Baroque composer Rameau theorized about added-sixth chords, and jazz does think about inversions sometimes (the use of slash chords attests to that, though a lot of the time that notation is just out of convenience), so use your discretion.\n\nIf you're for some reason in an tonal idiom that allows both interpretations though, use the conventions of the idiom to analyze it. Are you in a Romantic piece, and is (what would be) the seventh approached and resolved strictly? Then it's probably an inverted seventh chord. Minor seventh chords are commonly predominants (like ii7), so C E G A right before the dominant seventh chord D F# A C would make me think C E G A is a minor seventh in inversion. Don't forget to use your ear as well: am I in a pop piece at the end of the form and I heard what sounded like dominant G B D F to tonic C E G A? Then I would analyze the second chord as an added-sixth chord because 1) V-I is the canonic dominant-tonic progression so I would analyze it as a G chord to a C chord, and 2) part of the point of a chord in inversion is that it is less stable than it's root position counterpart, so it'd make less sense to end with a sense of finality on a chord in inversion. If I heard a piece that had the bass moving in fifths and alternated between root position seventh chord sonorities and sonorities like C E G A (so like DFAB, GBDF, CEGA, FACE...) my ear would probably make me hear a series of root position chords, and I'd then conclude that C E G A were an added-sixth chord.

In the book, the message is really quite obvious as well. However, the first and last scene of the movie (Tom Hanks sitting around a fire telling a story) are absent from the book. I feel that this scene decreases the effect of stating its message.  In the book, the message is simply there. In the film, the message is also clearly there, but its wrapped in another story layer, which basically says \"this is what Tom Hanks says that the message is\", instead of \"this is what the message is\".\n\nAlso, in the book the stories are listed in order of A B C D E F E D C B A. The editing of the movie is not too confusing to me, and allows for some clever cuts that add small details from the story.

Social media websites like twitter, facebook, reddit and other ones ran by companies should not allow users to witch-hunt or accuse other users or people they don't even know of heinous things.

{"body": "EDIT:  Once again, I made some mistakes in going to broad.  I'd like to clear them up.  I misread the guitar tab as it was late when I posted.  The guy is playing an Em9 chord.  The 3rd and 5th are absent the way he has it voiced on guitar.\n\nAlso, he's using a capo.  This raises the pitch of the guitar and allows you to play in a different key with a potentially easier set of chord positions.  Because he's playing with the capo on the first fret, this raises the guitar's pitch by a half step.  That means when he's telling a guitarist the tab for Em9, it sounds as Fm9.  Every other chord will also be a half step higher.\n\nThis is something you'll have to keep in mind if you're watching guitar videos.\n\nThe fact that I strapped on my capo and played along the with the guy only to mess up and tell you some goofy stuff (after misreading the tab down a set of strings and a few frets to low) speaks to how tired I was trying to type this out.\n\n\n\n~~If you want to skip to the end, the guy in the video is wrong.  He's playing an Fm chord according to his tab.  If you want a crazy theory lesson on how to spell out these large chords, feel free to read and be aware I made a mistake earlier about the Em7(9) because F# is diatonic to E... not F.~~\n\nTo clarify on what Onaz was saying, if you had all of the what keys laid out...\n\nC D E F G A B C D E F G A B C\n\nYou stack in 3rds to build chords.\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A B C D E F G A B C\n\nSo the highlighted notes create a C major triad.\n\nKeep going skipping in thirds.\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A **B** C D E F G A B C\n\nNow you have CEGB, which is a Major 7th chord and would be marked as CM7 or CMaj7 or sometimes with a delta sign. \n\nIf you keep going...\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A **B** C **D** E **F** G **A** B C\n\nSo now you have a full CMaj13.  Notice, like OnaZ said, if you go up another third you just start over with your root.\n\n\nIt gets a little more confusing as we get into the qualities of 7ths.  In a chord marked C7 (not Maj7), you're playing a dominant seventh.  Basically, the 7th is not the leading tone to the root (not a half step away).  It's a whole step lower than the root.\n\nIf it helps, in the key of C, the dominant chord (or V chord) would be G.  A G 7th chord, diatonic to the key of C major be GBDF.  No alterations (in the key of C major).  That's how dominant 7ths are built.  So it would be marked as G7.\n\n\nNow if you had a C7 (meaning C dominant 7) that means you're essentially thinking of what C is the V chord of... which is F and Bb is diatonic in F, but it's probably just easier to remember that it's a whole step below the root.  So a C7 would be CEGB**b**.\n\nSo now we know how to do CMaj7 and C7.  What about Cm7?  Well, minor refers to the triad.  The 7th stays dominant.  So you've still got the Bb, but the third, E, is lowered.  You can think of it either as diatonic to C minor, or diatonic to a key in which C is naturally a minor chord.  Or you could just think about it in the key of C major and think of it as a lowered 3rd which for the purpose of mapping extensions may be easier (and is where I screwed up earlier).\n\nSo you have C Eb G Bb as your Cm7.  Extensions are the same no matter the bottom of the chord.\n\nSo a CMaj13 implies that the 7th is major, everything else is the same.\n\nC E G B (D F A)  \n\nC13 implies dominant 7th.\n\nC E G Bb (D F A)\n\nCm13 implies a minor 3rd and dominant 7th.\n\nC Eb G Bb (D F A)\n\nNotice the extensions stay the same unless otherwise altered.  For example... CMaj13(#11)\n\nC E G B (D **F#** A)\n\n\nSo in your example, basically the keyboard thing you linked is wrong.  It's just an Em7 with the voicing you would see using a guitar.  There is no 9th in there and if it were there, it would be an F# (because F# is in the key of E major).\n\n~~I see what he's doing there and he's not playing an Em7(9) or anything of the sort.  Even looking at what he's got marked in the guitar tab he's playing an F on the bottom, then an Ab and C.  He's playing an Fm triad.  Nothing weird about that.  He just is mislabeling the chord by a longshot.~~\n\nI'm going to bed now.

{"body": "As a programmer, a few things are clear.\n1. We do not type by thinking about letters, then pressing the keys accordingly; at least not those among us who have a half-decent typing speed. We type based on words/segments of words and muscle memory of those things.\n2. A good typist can type at about the same rate at which they think; slower in the case of code, which involves complex concepts and ideas which must be fit together for the code to work.\n\nAs a result of that and previous experience, several things can be stated with a decent assurance:\nFirstly, any key-based input system is more or less interchangeable. I tried Dvorak and found it to be nicer in terms of hand pain, but it greatly slowed me down because I lacked muscle memory in it. And since I can type at about the same speed I can think, there is no speed advantage to any possible change in the system. Likewise, if you plan on ever working at any computer other than your own, it's best to use qwerty simply because the muscle memory will interfere between keyboard setups. For weeks after trying Dvorak, I was occasionally typing some common words using the Dvorak keys, rather than the Qwerty ones. Any hacker who used non-standard keys would be incredibly slow outside of their own system's setup, and so had better be hacking purely from the comfort of their own home.\n[As a side note, qwerty may be better at setting the mood in a cyberpunk setting. It's designed to send your fingers flying back and fourth across the keyboard in a flurry of movement, whereas the dvorak variations aim to keep your hands as still as possible. If you want action-hacking, you want qwerty.]\n\nSimilarly, because our fast typing speed is based in muscle memory, a simple brain-computer-interface scheme just won't work in terms of speeding things up. If you need to spend time thinking explicitly about every letter you're typing, it takes a very long time to type anything. In order for a BCI system to work well, you need it to interpret entire words and/or simple concepts at a time. We don't type c o u t &lt; &lt; \" H e l l o   W o r l d \" &lt; &lt; e n d l ; but instead we type cout&lt;&lt; \" Hello World \" &lt;&lt;endl; which is a very different chunking and operates at a very different speed. When we have a BCI system which can handle that sort of mental chunking, only then will the standard keyboard be replaced.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Dvorak doesn't actually speed up your typing. Studies have found this to be true, and I would speculate it is largely because a good typist is limited by the speed of their thoughts, not the speed of their hands. What it does do very successfully is reduce things like carpel tunnel and hand fatigue, as it is focused on minimizing hand movement.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366617257", "subreddit": "Cyberpunk", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Or maybe it's a little more complex than that. Maybe you can't engage an opponent while you keep your map awareness and while you make sure that you're not losing any money by doing what you do. I look at LoL like an equivalence, where you are on a side and the enemy team is on the other. The team that wins the game is the team that can turn the equation in their favour. The equation at its simple state is: G x M x A x T = G x M x A x T, where G stands for gold, M for the raw mechanical skills (using your champion's abilities, summoners and items in an intelligent and efficient way) and A stands for awareness. The fun part, however, is that G = [T x (L + A + M + E) - T(enemy) x (L + A + M + E)], where E is efficiency and L is luck, aka enemies making mistakes (which is often not based on luck, but for simplicity I will assume it is).

Also please accept my apologies concerning the mistakes I made …*\n\nHe picked up his phone with sweaty hands, and unlocked it. He had 7 unread messages, he opened the first one: \"The cat holds the answer\" it read and Thomas turned around. He could barely make out the outline of the cats body, but he was sure that Sinclair hat buckled. Thomas read through the next message: \"Give the right answer to get your lights turned back on, give the wrong and …\", the third gave him  the instruction to type the answer out onto his now again black screen. Depending on his answer one of the two other messages would open with new instructions the other one would self destruct.\" Message four and five were not openable and Thomas thought that these were the ones the sender was talking about. Number six was from his provider, telling him about some new offer regarding some flat. Hadn't he been so frightened, Thomas would have laughed. The last message read: \"It may not seem so, but I am your friend.\"\n\nThomas took a deep breath. Slowly counted to ten and did every other relaxing exercise that he could remember. Which were actually none, but then again he was kind of stressed by the current situation. \n\n\"Sinclair\" he said, trying to sound soft and comforting. But he failed at both. Miserably.  \"Sinclair come here\", his voice was still shacking. The cat slowly came towards his desk. \"What do you have for me Sinclair, what secrets do you keep\". Thomas stroked the cats wet fur, and went through all the possible meanings of the first message that he could think of. As the cat did not hold anything in its paws and its fur was clean except for the still wet urine, he went through everything he knew about the cat. Every morning he would feed the cat, with whatever he had gotten from the supermarket the day before. So there was no regular food that could be the answer. Afterwards he would open the door and the cat wouldn't be seen till sunset, often even later. Thomas had know idea what Sinclair would do all day, cat things he assumed. Back inside the cat would eat any leftovers from the morning and then go to bed. This routine went back for as long as Thomas could remember. Nothing that held any answer. But then it hit Thomas. The odd circumstance of Sinclair finding to him. A few years back, he was just leaving to go to the supermarket to get some more of the cheap Red Bull ripoff, he always drank, and maybe get another look at the cute cashier, when he tripped over a small basket in it a small kitten and a piece of paper with just one short sentence on it: \"Its name is Sinclair\".\n\nThomas concluded that the name was the answer, or at least that the answer was within the name. \nS I N C L A I R, Sin Clair, NCIS Lair, Liar Inc s, Liars Inc, Rials Inc, French: The Man from Saint Clair, so many possibilities, witch one was it. Thomas concluded that TV Pop-Culture wasn't the right way to go, and that the translation was just to simple. So he was left with Liars Inc and Rials Inc, with no idea which one would be right. Before he could decide his mobile signaled him an incoming message. It was a video. Thomas opened it: 30, 29, 28, … He had to decide fast.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366658594", "subreddit": "LetsMakeAStory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard; chopped white onions; bright green sweet pickle relish; a dill pickle spear; tomato slices or wedges; pickled sport peppers; and a dash of celery salt.[1][5][6][7] The complete assembly of a Chicago hot dog is said to be \"dragged through the garden\" due to the many toppings.[8][9] The method for cooking the hot dog itself varies depending on the respective vendors preference. Most often they are steamed, water-simmered or grilled over charcoal, the latter of which are referred to as \"char-dogs.\"\nThe canonical recipe[1] does not include ketchup, and there is a widely-shared, strong opinion among many Chicagoans and aficionados that ketchup is unacceptable.[10][11][12][13] A number of Chicago hot dog vendors do not offer ketchup as a condiment.[14]\nContents  [hide] \n1 History\n2 Variations\n3 Preparation\n4 Restaurants\n4.1 Popular and historic vendors\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n[edit]History\n\nMany sources attribute the distinctive collection of toppings on a Chicago-style wiener to historic Maxwell Street and the \"Depression Sandwich\" reportedly originated by Fluky's in 1929.[1][8] Both the founders of Vienna Beef frankfurters, the most common brand served today, first sold at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago,[15][16][17] and the proprietors of Fluky's were Jewish, which may account for the wieners' pork-free, kosher-style character.[17]\n[edit]Variations\n\nThe \"dragged through the garden\" style is heavily promoted by Vienna Beef and Red Hot Chicago, the two most prominent Chicago hot dog manufacturers,[18] but exceptions are common, with vendors adding cucumber slices or lettuce,[1] omitting poppyseeds or celery salt, or using plain relish or a skinless hot dog.[19] Several popular hot dog stands serve a simpler version: a steamed natural-casing dog with only mustard, onions, plain relish and sport peppers, wrapped up with hand-cut french fries,[1] while the historic Superdawg drive-ins notably substitute a pickled tomato for fresh. Many vendors, including Portillo's, offer a Chicago-style dog with cheese sauce, known as a cheese-dog.\n[edit]Preparation\n\n\n\nA char-dog with the trademark X-cut on the both ends, as sold at Gold Coast Dogs in Union Station\nChicago-style hot dogs are cooked in hot water or steamed before adding the toppings.[1][7] A less common style is cooked on a charcoal grill and referred to as a \"chardog.\" Chardogs are easily identifiable because very often the ends of the dog are sliced in criss cross fashion before cooking, producing a distinctive \"curled-x\" shape as the dog cooks. Some hot dog stands, such as the Weiners Circle, only serve char-dogs.[20][21]\nThe typical beef hot dog weighs 1/8 of a pound or 2 ounces (57 g) and the most traditional type features a natural casing, providing a distinctive \"snap\" when bitten.[6][22]\nThe buns are a high-gluten variety made to hold up to steam warming, typically the S. Rosen's Mary Ann brand from Alpha Baking Company.[4]\n[edit]Restaurants\n\nThe Chicago area boasts more hot dog restaurants than McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King restaurants combined.[16][17] A \"hot dog stand\" in Chicago may serve many other items, including the Maxwell Street Polish, gyros, pork chop and Italian beef sandwiches, corn dogs and pizza puffs. The restaurants often have unique names, such as The Wiener Circle, Gene &amp; Jude's, Gold Coast Dogs or Mustard's Last Stand;[23] or architectural features, like Superdawg's two giant rooftop hot dogs (Maurie and Flaurie, named for the husband-and-wife team who own the drive-in). One of the most popular vendors of the Chicago-style dog are Chicago's professional sports teams; in fact, those sold at U.S. Cellular Field, (formerly Comiskey Park) are affectionately known as \"Comiskey Dogs.\"\nPortillo's and Scooby's Red Hots are perhaps the top vendors of this variation of hot dog regionally, although a version of it has been available nationally at Sonic Drive-in since 2011, and a variation can also be ordered at Nathan's Famous locations upon request.[24]\n[edit]Popular and historic vendors\nAugustino's Deli\nBuona Beef\nChubby Wieners\nComiskey Dogs (U.S. Cellular Field)\nD's Dog Hut\nFluky's\nGene &amp; Jude's\nGold Coast Dogs\nHot Doug's\nHappy House of West Chicago\nJimmy's Red Hots\nLuichi's Hot Dog's of Rockford\nMurphy's Red Hots\nMustard's Last Stand\nNicky's Gyros\nOak Park Dogs\nPortillo's\nScooby's Red Hots\nSuperdawg\nTony's Steamers of Winfield\nWheaton Smoke House\nThe Wieners Circle\nWrigleyville Dogs\nWolfy's Red Hots\n[edit]See also\n\n\tChicago portal\n\tFood portal\nItalian Beef\nCulture of Chicago\nMaxwell Street Polish\nChicago-style pizza\nHot dog variations\n[edit]References\n\n^ a b c d e f g h Zeldes, Leah A.

{"body": "Alright, here's your crash course. This post should (hopefully) give you everything you need to understand the chords on any chord chart ever, or your money back.\n\nThe normal chords you learn in pop and rock are all **triads** - two thirds stacked together, with three notes total. A **major triad**, like C major (C E G) is a major third (C-E) and a minor third (E-G). A **minor triad**, like Bb minor (Bb-Db-F) is the opposite: a minor third (Bb-Db) and a major third (Db-F). Those are the basic language of pop and rock, but there are also two other kinds of triads - diminished and augmented. A **diminished triad** is two minor thirds together, usually written with a ° sign. So D° = D F Ab. And an **augmented triad** is two major thirds, written either with a + or with an \"aug\". So, e.g. E^+ = E^(aug) = E G# B#.\n\nSo why did I tell you all that? The reason is that the basic harmonic language of jazz comes from taking that same process one step further - jazz uses **seventh chords**, which are one of those four triads *plus another third on top*, for a total of four notes. For the sake of being systematic, I'll list all 7 possible seventh chords^(1), in roughly descending order of importance:\n\n*The Main Players*\n***\n\n* **Dominant seventh** - Often just called a seventh chord. Major triad plus minor third, represented by a 7 with nothing else. Example: F^7 = F A C Eb.\n\n* **Minor seventh** - Minor triad plus a minor third, represented in a couple different ways. Example: F#m^7 = F#^(-7) = F#min^7 = F# A C# E.\n\n* **Major seventh** - Major triad plus a major third, also written a few different ways. Example: Dbmaj^7 = DbM^7 = Db^∆ = Db^∆7 = Db F Ab C\n\n*The Supporting Cast*\n***\n\n* **Half-diminished seventh** - Diminished triad plus a major third. It's usually written in jazz as m7b5 (or any of the other ways of writing \"minor seventh\" + b5), but the classical way is to write a diminished symbol (°) with a slash through it: ø. Example: Am7b5 = A^ø7 = A^7ø = A^ø = A C Eb G\n\n* **Diminished seventh** - Also known as a \"fully diminished seventh\", in contrast to \"half\". Usually written with ° plus a 7, but sometimes composers get lazy and just write the °. Example: Eb°^7 = Eb^(7)° (= Eb°) = Eb Gb Bbb Dbb (they tend to be written with enharmonically \"incorrect\" but easier pitches, so you might see that as Eb Gb A C, or Eb F# A C, etc).\n\n* **Minor-Major seventh** - Minor triad plus a major third. Notated very inconsistently, you could see any number of different things. Example: EmM^7 = Emin^(M7), etc = E G B D#\n\n*The Outcast*\n***\n\n* **\"Augmented major seventh\"** - Augmented triad plus a minor third. This chord isn't very common and doesn't have any standardized name or notation. Example: Abmaj7^(#5) = Ab C E G\n\nThere are just a couple other things you need to know to be able to identify the chords on any chart:\n\n*Extensions*\n***\n\nThese are when you see the numbers 9, 11, and 13 after a chord. It's basically the same principle as 7th chords - you just keep adding thirds! If it's just the number, you assume it's a dominant seventh, but you can also specify major or minor. The reason that we use 9, 11, and 13 instead of 2, 4, and 6 (the same notes, an octave lower) is that they imply that all the notes below them are \"in the chord\".\n\nNow, it starts to get a little fuzzy and vague at this point. 9th chords do almost always have the 7th and down in them, but 13th chords don't always include the 11th. For one thing, most jazz players don't like the sound of the natural 11 in major/dominant harmonies, so they either exclude it or make it a #11. Pretty much the only time you see natural 11 is in m11 chords. The other exception is for 6 - you do see m6 chords fairly often, which is a minor triad plus the *major* sixth. So, Cm6 would be C-Eb-G-A. If it helps, it's actually an Am7b5 in first inversion.\n\n*Alterations*\n***\n\nI've already covered this fairly implicitly, but any of the notes 5 through 13 can be altered. It's fairly intuitive - for example, a G^7(b9) would have the notes G B D F Ab, whereas G^9 would be G B D F A.^2\n\n*Special Cases*\n***\n\nThere are a couple named \"seventh chords\" that don't fall into the systematic list above. Here they are:\n\n* **Sus 7** - Essentially a dominant 13 chord without the third. So a C^7sus would be C G Bb D F A. You can also think of it as a 13 chord that replaces the third with the natural 11.\n\n* **Augmented dominant seventh** - You'll sometimes see a 7(#5) chord labelled as a +7 or 7+. So, D^(7+) = D^(+7) = D^7#5 = D F# A# C.\n\n* **Altered dominant seventh** - The altered dominant basically takes all the common alterations of a dominant seventh chord and throws them together. On an altered chord, you can play any or all of the b9, #9, b5/#11, and #5/b13. The notes available to you on this chord are the root, b9, #9, third, b5, #5, and seventh. This chord is intimately related to the **tritone substitution**, which is a whole other topic that you can find lots of great discussion about here and on /r/jazz (and probably /r/piano too). Example: G^7alt = G^alt7 = G, Ab, Bb, B, Db, Eb, F, G.\n\nHopefully this is useful to you! I tried to be accessible but also thorough, so that you can use this as a reference for any unfamiliar chord. You don't necessarily have to digest or understand all this right away, but it should give you the tools to understand pretty much any chord chart you'll ever read. Let me know if you have questions, or if there's something I didn't cover. I also didn't talk about the function (or purpose) of any of these chords, or how to voice them, so let me know if you have questions about that stuff.\n\n^(1) If you're mathematically inclined, you'll notice that there should be 8 (4*2=8), but the augmented triad plus a major third is redundant - it's actually just an augmented triad with an octave of the root on top, not a full 4-note chord.\n\n^(2) The main number is always the *highest unaltered chord tone*. So you write G^7(b9) instead of G^(b9). But G^13(b9) is fine. This is fairly nitpicky and only really matters if you're writing out your own charts for other people.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366763196", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 60, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From his great new plan /s\n\n**C. \t Eradicate Marijuana Cultivation**\n\nRemote marijuana grow sites on public lands pose a significant threat to public safety and the environ-\nment. The cultivation of marijuana frequently entails the diversion of water resources, the clearing of\nnative brush, and the use of banned pesticides. In a 2012 study, researchers documented poisonous\nchemicals and toxicants at an abandoned marijuana cultivation site situated within territory inhabited\nby fishers, a rare forest carnivore declared a candidate species for listing under the Federal Endangered\nSpecies Act.81\nAt the Federal level, the effort to eliminate marijuana production on our public lands is led by the Public\nLands Drug Control Committee. The committee aligns policies and coordinates programs to support\nfield-level eradication operations, investigations, and intelligence and information sharing. Central to this\nprocess is the work of the public lands agencies, which identify and document the marijuana threat in\nthe areas under their jurisdiction. This information will inform the development of the Domestic Cannabis\nCultivation Assessment, a comprehensive, national-level strategic assessment of cannabis cultivation and\nmarijuana production in the United States.\nRemoving Marijuana from our Public Lands\nIn 2012, Operation Mountain Sweep, an 8-week, multi-agency and multistate marijuana operation target-\ning large-scale illegal marijuana grows on public lands in seven states, eradicated more than 726,000\nmarijuana plants.82,83 The value of the removed plants was estimated to be over $1.45 billion. In addition to\nthe marijuana plants eradicated, huge amounts of trash, miles of irrigation line, and many pounds of fertil-\nizer and pesticides were removed from grow sites on public lands. The coordinated efforts of seven U.S.\nAttorneys, as well as support from ten HIDTAs in seven states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon,\nUtah, and Washington), were integral to the success of this operation.\n\n**D. \t Stop Indoor Marijuana Production**\nBecause of pressure from marijuana eradication efforts, many cultivators have been forced to abandon\nlarge outdoor cannabis plots in favor of easier-to-conceal indoor cultivation. The detection of these\nindoor grows has proven challenging for law enforcement. In 2012, DEA and partner agencies seized\nmore than 2,500 indoor grow operations, with more than 302,000 plants eradicated.\nE. \t Partner with Local Law Enforcement Agencies to Combat Street, Prison, and Motorcycle\nDrug Gangs\nLaw enforcement agencies continue to work to disrupt and dismantle dangerous street gangs. In May of\n2012, the National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) launched NGIC Online, an information system with\nweb-based tools that enables law enforcement agencies to gain access to a variety of resources.84,85 EPIC\nhas created a Gang Initiative to focus on establishing links between criminal gang activity and transna-\ntional/domestic drug trafficking and terrorism-related organizations. In FY 2010, DOJ’s National Gang\nTargeting, Enforcement, and Coordination Center (GangTECC) was partnered with the Special Operations\nDivision (SOD). After supporting only approximately 100 cases in 3 years prior to the SOD merger, under\nthe operational direction of SOD, the GangTECC Section supported over 800 cases in just its first full year\nat SOD. Further, in FY 2012 alone, SOD-supported gang cases accounted for approximately 900 arrests.\n★\n45 ★\nnati o na l d r u g co n t r o l st r at e g y\nIn one example of an effective cross-country gang investigation, in 2012, the Ohio HIDTA’s Northern\nOhio Law Enforcement Task Force and FBI Los Angeles jointly worked to identify and disrupt a large scale\ndrug trafficking organization linked to the LA-based Grape Street Crips. The investigation revealed that\na drug trafficking organization responsible for the transportation of cocaine to Cleveland and other U.S.\ncities was affiliated with the LA street gang. In February 2012, multiple search warrants were initiated in\nOperation Soap Scrambling that resulted in the disruption of the drug trafficking organization.\nIn another example in 2012, the ICE/Homeland Security Invesitgations (HSI) San Diego Gang\nInvestigations Group, in coordination with other HSI components and Federal, state, and local law\nenforcement partners, conducted an investigation that identified more than 40 targets linked to\n13 separate and documented street gangs. The investigation culminated in 31 Federal arrests and\n31 state arrests. In addition, agents seized significant quantities of drugs, cash, vehicles, firearms, and\nammunition.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366831740", "subreddit": "news", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Without maths you'd just have to have a huge pile of bricks and just keep taking them until you'd completed the wall (and have loads left over, or worse not enough). With maths you'd know that the wall would be 40 bricks wide by 5 bricks tall, so you'd need 40 x 5 or 200 bricks. You can then buy that exact amount of bricks.\n\nAs times goes on you can create more complex sums, like working out how much liquid a container will hold, or how fast something will roll down a hill, or even how fast air needs to go over an aeroplane wing to make it fly (that's very hard maths!).\n\nIt's all about being able to work things out in advance.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366908190", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If the enemy team is being aggressive and has a hard engage, putting an extra level or two into E is a good idea.\n\nCore Items:  Shurelya's, Locket, Bulwark, boots, Ruby Sightstone.\n\nBuild Order:  I like to rush Philo stone and Sightstone.  The rest of the build order depends.  If you're doing a lot of harass, pick up a kindlegem.  It's good to have due to the CDR and health.  If you aren't harassing, you can wait a bit on the kindlegem.  If you really need that third ward, go right into Ruby Sightstone.  If the enemy team isn't using the bushes and you aren't harassing, pick up a Kage's pick.  The gold is helpful and it provides a slight boost to your shield and Q poke.  After you have Philo stone and the Ruby Sightstone, finish off Locket.  If you haven't gotten Kage's by this point, don't bother.  On Lulu, you don't really need tier 1 boots until laning phase ends.  Usually, I like to get Merc treads on her.  Ionian boots are good if the enemy team doesn't have AoE CC or AP.  Bulwark is a really important item.  If nobody on your team is willing to buy it, you have to.  After that, finish off Shurelya's and see what else your team needs.\n\nPlaying in lane: Poke.  That's all you really need to do.  Try to get in a position where you can hit both the ADC and support with your Q.  When you do this, make sure you're still in a position where you can protect your ADC.  You're going to need to be able to shield them.  As far as your W is concerned, how to use that depends on the situation.  If there is a duel, always use W on the enemy ADC.  If your ADC is trying to leave the fight, who you cast W on depends.  If a speed boost will keep them out of harms way, use it.  If they're going to continue to take shots until they reach tower, use it on the enemy ADC.\n\nTeam fights: As a support, your job is to protect the carry.  Remember, the carry isn't always the ADC.  The carry is the person that is decimating the enemy team.  If you see someone trying to jump on your carry, Q them to slow them down.  Make sure you pop your locket at the beginning of team fights.  If you have an AP champ that does AoE damage, use the W on them.  It increases their AP and therefore their damage.  Otherwise, cast W on the enemy carry.  Your ult doesn't just give health.  It's an AoE knock-up.  Use it to your team's advantage.  Once your bruiser dives in to the middle of the other team, ult them.  If you notice the enemy team isn't attacking your initiator, you might want to save your ult for saving a teammate.  As for your E, I'm sure you can figure out how to use that properly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366908737", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You might ask him in a nice way if he needs help prioritizing his tasks.  There are lots of sysadmins in the world who dont give a shit about organization, but have a mind as big as the universe.  If you can guide that mind in the right path then you'll see ManChilds true ability.  How is moral between the 3 of you?  Moral is very important when you manage technical people.  If your tech thinks hes getting fired everyday.  He probably wont give a shit or you'll see that in his attitude.  You need to go out of your way to motivate this guy.  Make sure his work isn't so repetitive that it makes him feel like hes working on an assembly line.  Helpdesk techs, sysadmins need to feel like they've accomplished something.  We need to expand our minds and learn new things on a daily basis. We sysadmins lose interest quick sometimes doing the same shit everyday. What kind of system does this guy work from? Talk your boss in to buying him a new fucking system to work from. That would motivate the hell out of any employee. Lots of sysadmins have fucking social problems too thats why were so smart, ha.

{"body": "It's a long story. Here is a repost of my earlier attempt to tell this tale:  \n\n&gt;I made a [new gimbal just for mech piloting for a Thrustmaster Cougar](http://imgur.com/a/ixi64) (descriptions in album), that is installed in my [current mechpit..](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/111003-mechpit-ii-a-practical-approach/page__p__2198157#entry2198157) My stick works fantastically, and IMO was well worth the effort of constructing it, but short of this level effort the answer is no.  \n\n&gt;Unfortuntately 99% of what people say about sticks is true, but usually their reasoning behind why is not correct. In short what it breaks down to is not that a joystick is poorly suited for MWO, it's that an airplane joystick is poorly suited for MWO, which is unfortunately the only kind of joystick one can buy at the moment. The problem has everything to do with the opposing design criteria of a stick that controls something that moves like a mech/tank which was designed around/benefits from unrestricted absolute inputs vs flying an aircraft, which is in turn designed around/benefits from restricted relative inputs. Short of making a stick with a gimbal suited for this task, no level of support on PGI's end will do anything change what is the larger underlying fundamental problem.  \n\n&gt;That problem is not digital, it's mechanical, and much harder to work around. The digital problems are actually super easy (no, really) to work around for anyone using TARGET (Thrustmaster's kick ass kbm emulator for the Cougar, Warthog, or T16000 sticks, which yes I have scripts for if anyone needs...). Anyone that wants to explore this to it's fullest themselves should pick up a Thrustmaster T16000 ($40) since it is the fastest/cheapest ticket for sailing right past all the little technical hurdles that keeps most of this stuff shrouded in mystery and confusion.  \n\n&gt;The stick I built specifically addresses the mechanical shortcomings that all airplane joysticks share plus since it runs TARGET, among many other incredibly useful things, allows me to use absolute inputs and have a very fine degree of control over the exes (including on-the fly sensitivity changes just like any mouse worth it's weight) which since my gimbal was designed to utilize from the very start -works out really well. Again I reiterate -this is not the norm- and much effort was required to do this.  \n\n&gt;-**attributes** (effects)\n\n&gt;**Airplane stick:**    \n\n&gt;**-moves in pitch/roll** (unnatural range of motion, not reflexively intuitive)  \n**-spring centering, most likely with detents** (fights inputs, negative interactions across the axes center's)  \n**-requires deadzones** (distracting, imprecise, disconnected feeling between inputs and in-game reactions, wasted range of motion)  \n**-uses relative inputs** (mech movements wind up either too slow or uncontrollable, difficult to not to overshoot past target, combined with the first 3 problems adds up to a non-viable control option)    \n\n&gt;**Mouse:**   \n\n&gt;**-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane** (natural range of movement of the reticule)  \n**-has no spring centering or detents** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted movement)  \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across centers no different than any other point in x/y)  \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)    \n\n&gt;**My stick:**  \n\n&gt;**-moves in zenith/azimuth** (pitch/twist -natural range of movement of the mech)  \n**-no spring centering/detents, but has tensioned/greased rubs** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted smooth damped movement, holds position when not being moved therefore maintains physical orientation related to on-screen state)  \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across center no different than any other point in x/y)  \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)   \n\n&gt;For anyone that doesn't understand the significance of RELATIVE vs ABSOLUTE, here is an analogy: Picture a 12\" square sheet of glass and a marble sitting on it. Using relative inputs is like trying to move the marble by picking up the sheet of glass with the marble balanced on it and tilting it front/back and side/side, quickly leveling it again when it's where you want it to be in x/y coordinates. Using absolute inputs however would be like placing the same piece glass level on a desk in front of you and using your hand to reach out and directly move the marble wherever you want on the plane, and for this reason are also called direct inputs.  \n\n&gt;Just like piloting a mech with relative inputs is ... less than optimal, so is piloting an aircraft using absolute inputs. These are just not interchangeable design criteria, and the peripherals used to operate these vertial craft need to be specifically suited for the input type or the results are, well quite predictably precisely what is being experienced and shared by users that made it through the technical challenges and managed to get their airplane stick to work with MWO with as dialed-in of settings as possible. Some adapt to it, but mostly by piloting s l o w heavies or assaults, since with relative inputs you have to balance reaction speed vs accuracy, achieving neither in the process. You can get away with it in an Atlas, but not a Commando...   \n\nHere is the [relevant thread it is from](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1c52od/mwo_joystick_controls_worth_it/), as it contained much useful discussion as well. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367016170", "subreddit": "mwo", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "With respect Valleyman if you believe this building collapsed due to fire and a bit of fall damage I would question your professional ability. I of course understand if you value your job you won't oppose the official funded theory.  \n\nYour argument proposes a floor by floor collapse where the acceleration and mass overcome the floors beneath etc.\n\nYou at least acknowledge as concrete smashes into concrete the acceleration will slow. But quite clearly, WTC towers especially, we see this top down concrete mass forcefully ejected outwards. The mass is completely displaced and ended up all over NYC. There was nothing left apart from a pile of steel. \n\nThe recent building collapse in India was a good example and the picture posted recently shows how concrete would break up and pile high after a building collapse. I'm not saying the 2 buildings would have behaved the same but for a top down pile driving theory to work you would expect to see a significant mass left over. \n\nThe pile driving theory you have doesn't stack up when there is no mass left. You would also have to vanish a good few floors to start the acceleration off. Have a few steel beams melt and sag wouldn't provide acceleration rapid enough to initiate a collapse. \n\nI reckon absolute worst case the steel would weaken, possibly sag slightly and distributed load failed due to severed columns so you might loose the side of the building above the impact zone. \n\nI know we aren't talking specifically about wtc here but building 7 is more clear cut. You can actually see the structure loose integrity just before it collapses. The roof drops inwards and the left and right sides look like they are decoupled, just like any other demolition. It would have to be a miracle like no other for all of the core columns to fail at the same time for building 7 to fall neatly down into its footprint. \n\nNo building in history has failed like building 7 or even wtc1/2 for that matter. Yet 3 failed on the same day with pocket fires. \n\nI n s a n e", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367025299", "subreddit": "911truth", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hm, I'm actually going to do the maths on this. Will edit this post when I'm done.\n\nEDIT: I'm done, and I was quite surprised the results. It's long, but well worth a read =)\n\nHere's the scenario I'm using. Xerath is level 13 with a 5/5/1/2 skill point distribution. He has 100 AP (rough estimate of runes + masteries + one cdr/AP item). He has 23 magic penetration from runes and boots, and 8% magic penetration from masteries (45% when combined with W). He is using a W E R Q R R combo on an opponent, and lands every skill. This scenario gives us a base damage of 1225 before resistances, and a 320% ratio on any further AP bought.\n\nAdding a Haunting Guise to this build makes our damage equal to 130500/(62 + 0.55xMR), capped at 1305 damage (since magic pen can't make you do more than true damage). Alternatively, if we use our gold to buy only AP, the damage becomes (122500 + 320xAP)/(77 + 0.55xMR). If we want to find out just how much AP our Haunting Guise is worth, we can simply assume these two numbers are equal (ie, equal damage was dealt with the Haunting Guise and with pure AP). Rearranging the equations gives us AP = (7667 + 13.75xMR)/(62 + 0.55xMR), assuming the enemy has high enough MR that we're not doing true damage.\n\nLet's try some examples of different enemy MR. If your enemy has basically no MR, and is simply relying on runes and masteries, they'll have about 50. At this low, you'll be doing nearly true damage even without a Haunting Guise, so you won't expect it to account for much (note that the above formula assumes less than true damage with a haunting guise factored in, so can't be used). Unsurprisingly, this means that a Haunting Guise is worth a measly 41.5 AP - about a blasting wand.\n\nLet's tone it up a bit. With a Haunting Guise, you do true damage to anyone with less than 69 MR, so let's assume your opponent has a chalice/bulwark aura/some other small MR contribution bringing their MR to 70. Plugging this into the formula gives us a result of about 85 AP. If you compare this to the gold efficiency of a Needlessly Large Rod, Haunting Guise saves about 200 gold. However, since you can recipe with the rod, it wouldn't be absurd to argue the rod is still better for this situation.\n\nWhat about someone who's actually had to build a bit of MR, and has around 100? The formula gives us a result of 77 AP, so as you can see it's starting to drop off a bit. The guise is still keeping up with a pure AP build in terms of a damage/gold ratio though.\n\nOne final test on a tank with 150 MR, and the result is 67 AP. Our Haunting Guise has now fallen off in terms of damage/gold ratio with a pure AP build.\n\n**Summary**\n\nI must say, I was personally surprised by these results. I thought that the Haunting Guise would far outweigh any amount of AP you could build. As it turns out, the margin is fairly small. There are still a few things to consider here though.\n\nThe most important thing to note here is that I have not factored in the health granted by the Haunting Guise into any of these calculations. 200 health is very significant, and could very easily be the difference between life an death.\n\nIn terms of pure damage though, buying Haunting Guise is a slightly larger power spike now, for a slightly smaller power spike later. A Haunting Guise will give you more damage than half of the recipe for a big damage item. However, a big damage item will give you more damage than a haunting guise plus half the recipe for said item.\n\nWhen all's said and done though, when you compare the damage of a full combo of a haunting guise to a needlessly large rod, or a guise + rod to a deathcap, on any opponent with between 70-100 MR, the difference is less than 50 damage either way. The 200 health on the guise easily cancels out this difference.\n\n**TL;DR** The damage difference between a Haunting Guise and pure AP is actually very insignificant. Buy the Guise because it's basically free health.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367077877", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll expand on what CrownStarr said, because there's a bit more to it than D to D using all of C major's pitches with a D Minor chord. \n\nEach mode has a \"tendency pitch\" that differs slightly from either the major or natural minor mode. For example, the D minor scale would be:\n\nD E F G A Bb C D\n\nThe chords for the natural minor scale are:\n\ni ii^o III iv v VI VII\n\nWhen we play D Dorian, we change the Bb to a B, and when we do this, we say we've \"raised the 6th\". This gives us the D Dorian scale:\n\nD E F G A B C D\n\nNow, what we have to keep in mind is that this affects all the chords that this B natural occurs in. These chords would be EGB (ii instead of ii^o , or E,G,Bb), GBD (IV instead of iv, or G,Bb,D), and BDF (vi^o instead of VI, or Bb,D,F). So, any of these chords can evoke the mode of D Dorian, all because of that one altered pitch, B Natural instead of Bb. And this is how modes work. \n\nWhen composers use modes, our progressions treat the chords with tendency tones with more prominence than we might in an average, major or minor progression. For example, in Lydian we have a raised 4th. This is a major mode, so we'd compare that to the chords of a major scale. \n\nHere is C Lydian: C D E F# G A B C\n\nHere are the Lydian chords: I II iii iv^o V vi vii\n\nCompare that to the chords resulting from a major scale: I ii iii IV V vi vii^o\n\nIn Lydian, the most striking sonority to evoke the mode is the I-II progression, which you can hear in Yoda's theme from Star Wars. You can really use any of these. The vii is also a good chord to evoke this because, again, it includes that F#. This is how modes work. \n\nHere is a pretty [concise comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/181fzn/how_i_identify_musical_modes_instantly/c8at07z) to modes.

{"body": "I've just had an afterthought today. The data was actually somewhat skewed when looking at single target damage because of Xerath's E. I was using it as level 1, with only 70 base damage, so magic pen does very little to help it. However, its 0.8 ratio is applied in full to any AP you buy, so factoring in his E to the calculations made AP a lot more favourable than if I had left it out.\n\nBecause of this, I decided to quickly redo the calculations using only a W R Q R R combo - the AoE damage you'd get off in a teamfight. I won't go though all the calculations again, but I'll post some quick numbers here.\n\nAt 50 MR, you're doing nearly true damage without the haunting guise, so it's only worth about about 56 AP. At 60 MR, you're still wasting some of the magic pen, but it's already doing as much damage as 85 AP. However, at 70 enemy MR, when you're doing almost true damage, your Haunting Guise is worth a whopping 172 AP! At 100 MR, it's still worth a massive 162! Even against a 150 MR tank, it's still worth 149 AP.\n\nSo, while AP might help your E become more of a potent single target nuke for a full combo, if you only count your AoE damage in teamfights, a Haunting Guise actually gives you more damage than a completed deathcap if your enemies have more than 70 MR, and is cost efficient for damage/gold if they have anything over 60.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367162596", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Oh boy, you are in for a wild ride. How many years experience do you have with cattle?\n\nBison and cattle have distinctly different personalities but their basic management (feed, shelter etc.) are similar.\n\nIF you haven't started yet PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take a couple years to learn with cattle first. Cattle are much easier to manage, much cheaper if you totally screw up, less dangerous to handle etc. Bison are so darn pricey that total newbies should do the hard knocks with beef whenever possible.\n\nI was new with ranching/farming once and can totally understand that wide eyed enthusiasm that comes with a new project/business. I am a knot head and learned the hard, expensive way. The learning curve is very harsh with livestock, nothing ever goes by the book. Going S L O W and having patience is vital and something I lacked. I wanted my dream NOW.  : )\n\nAre you going to feed hay or have a pasture? That in and of itself is a major learning process. Do you grow hay or buy it? Have you fully budgeted realistic hay needs and storage? Hay is hard to find in winter and even the best pastures need a supplement during bad weather. Do you know your stocking rates for your pasture? How many head do you plan to have, how many acres? Are you going to use small square bales or large round? Not all hay is created equal, what type of hay are your looking at? Do you know it's protein content? Are you going to do traditional or rotational grazing? Managing a pasture is truly an art form, if you have never done it before you have no idea what you are in for...  Bison are larger than cattle, much larger so their feed needs are huge, however they can eat a somewhat lower quality forage.\n\n**I'm asking 20 questions to guage your level of experience because I can shop talk you for days and would hate to tell you things you already know.**\n\nAll that being said, I would be happy to share whatever I know with you.\n\nI have not had bison but at one point I wanted them desperately. So, I can share the most important tidbits I filed away in my thinker, lol.\n\n1.You cannot have just a couple bison. They are herd animals to a much higher degree than cattle. They WILL break down the sturdiest of fences to get to nearby livestock, of almost any kind, just to be in a herd. You cannot split your herd to have seperate bulls/breeding groups. They WILL merge. \n\n2. It is okay to mix them with cattle for the above reasons. Beefalo is yummy but due to size issues I would not use a bison bull on a cow heiffer, she could have calving issues. A (cow) bull on bison cows would be safer.\n\n3. DO NOT tame them unless you have a petting zoo and even that is a bad idea. These are wild animals, even if they act sweet, love a forehead scratch and eat out of hand they are still wild. These animals weigh upward of 1500 lb. and easily over 2000, much more for a full grown bull. That sweet bottle raised bull will go full on split personality during breeding season and can kill you in a split second. Even just a playful adolescent can accidentally maim you. Treat these guys like a loaded gun/trained circus lion every minute of every day. Getting too comfortable can cost you life or limb.\n\n3. When transporting new unhandled bison you need a fully enclosed trailer. If you have a standard livestock trailer you should use plywood on the sides and block out all openings, the darker the better. IF they spook, IF, they will literally kill themselves doing whatever it takes to jump through a hole that a dog couldn't even fit through.\n\n4. You cannot herd bison like cattle, they just don't operate like that. Bucket training is easiest. That's when you feed them grain as a treat but shake the bucket first so they hear it. After awhile they will know the sound and come to you, beware the bison munchies stampede! (seriously)\n\n5. When moving from one pasture to another you can tempt them in. They are naturally very curious creatures. Tie something interesting like a bandana at the end of a fishing line and leave it out for them. Then as they come over to sniff at it reel it in a little bit out of reach. Then keep tempting them forward a little at a time.\n\nBison are kinda cool. They face into a storm when cattle turn their back to it. Bison walk shoulder to shoulder where cattle go in an almost single file row down a worn path.\n\nTheir hides are an added value aside from their meat.\n\nAnyway, I wish you the best of luck, this is a very big endeavor. Please do not overestimate your abilities as that can be your undoing, a very expensive and heartbreaking undoing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367162939", "subreddit": "farming", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Positive**: Youtube and other video hosting websites are severely lacking in quality of content and ease of delivery. They also are very limited in their ability to spread information as the search is cluttered by people spamming bump keywords etc. Your service provides something that seems extremely beneficial to both educators or business management and conferencing. With slide share combined into the package the ease of disseminating information at large is greatly enhanced; and something I, as a student, find very lacking in large video lecture based courses (Or any course that's recorded for that matter). Slides are hard to see etc when not integrated. I also like what the other aspects of the program you are offering. Statistics and analytic's are always good ESPECIALLY for companies. If you can make them money, they wanna make you money. This is a less necessary thing for educators, however. One of the biggest pluses is that you are offering security. A security block with make many people want to use a product in this age of paranoia on the internet. Good work there. Beyond this your web design is clean and sleek and very inviting. But as I get to the bottom I find the biggest con.\n\n\n**Cons**: $67/mo. Ouch. That cost is very, VERY prohibitive when it comes to the market you're trying to reach. In all honesty $30-40 a month would probably turn many of your costumers away, at the start. You  You would need to finagle with the price and find basically the price that allows you to keep a small margin of profit at the beginning (something no one trying to make money wants to hear I'm sure). However, until you have established your startup it is very difficult to have a massive paywall turning people away before they even get the chance to use it. Why would I pay so much when integrating slides with video can be done using a little bit of computer trickery unless you can offer high quality content (which is gonna have to be the selling point with ever increasing content distribution and upkeep). No one likes stagnant equipment! \n\n\n**Overall**: Seems to be an awesome idea for a product. You're offering ease of access to a service that people who are not rather tech savvy usually are unable to accomplish on their own by securing slides with a video. You are offering security and analytic's and statistics. But you have a steep paywall likely to turn many costumers away from your product. Maybe take a look at what you need to turn a small net profit early into the business and increase it as you add more features. This would more likely be done by offering different \"levels\" of service: another recommendation. Not everyone  needs the same service. Educators don't really need the same quality that a business exec needs, and in the same regard won't likely have the same money to pay for your program. People are diverse, make sure your product and prices are too. Don't give up, you have a good idea here, just needs some tweaking.\n\n\n**Ideas: Poll your potential costumers!** Dont just use reddit for this. Get out and ask educators and exec's and everyone who could possibly use your idea what THEY want to see in your product. That is what will make your product great for those who will be using it. \n\n\n**Create separate things for separate purposes!** Allow teachers to see their students. See who logged in and who watched the entire two hour lecture and who didn't etc. Allow them to add quizzes in the form of the integrated slides with a b c d e formatting on the page making sure their students are actually watching it. You get the idea. Just create more niche features for each target.\n\n**Also**: I keep seeing people talk about Prezi. I don't think this is really accurate.

{"body": "Ahh, the stick thing. Well, it's something I rant about often, and you are right to be concerned. The enemy is the airplane stick however, not joysticks as a species. I do not have an airplane stick. Below is a repost of a recent attempt of mine to illustrate this particularly difficult issue to navigate. Also, if you look closely at my third installment of updates on my build log you will see it's natively capable of being driven throttle/pedals/mouse. If someone that were driving it really couldn't make it work with the stick, I got them covered, but it's not the simple story most people conclude, and not all sticks are created equal. \n\n&gt;I made a [new gimbal just for mech piloting for a Thrustmaster Cougar](http://imgur.com/a/ixi64) (descriptions in album), that is installed in my [current mechpit..](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/111003-mechpit-ii-a-practical-approach/page__p__2198157#entry2198157) My stick works fantastically, and IMO was well worth the effort of constructing it, but short of this level effort the answer is no.  \n\n&gt;Unfortuntately 99% of what people say about sticks is true, but usually their reasoning behind why is not correct. In short what it breaks down to is not that a joystick is poorly suited for MWO, it's that an airplane joystick is poorly suited for MWO, which is unfortunately the only kind of joystick one can buy at the moment. The problem has everything to do with the opposing design criteria of a stick that controls something that moves like a mech/tank which was designed around/benefits from unrestricted absolute inputs vs flying an aircraft, which is in turn designed around/benefits from restricted relative inputs. Short of making a stick with a gimbal suited for this task, no level of support on PGI's end will do anything change what is the larger underlying fundamental problem.  \n\n&gt;That problem is not digital, it's mechanical, and much harder to work around. The digital problems are actually super easy (no, really) to work around for anyone using TARGET (Thrustmaster's kick ass kbm emulator for the Cougar, Warthog, or T16000 sticks, which yes I have scripts for if anyone needs...). Anyone that wants to explore this to it's fullest themselves should pick up a Thrustmaster T16000 ($40) since it is the fastest/cheapest ticket for sailing right past all the little technical hurdles that keeps most of this stuff shrouded in mystery and confusion.  \n\n&gt;The stick I built specifically addresses the mechanical shortcomings that all airplane joysticks share plus since it runs TARGET, among many other incredibly useful things, allows me to use absolute inputs and have a very fine degree of control over the exes (including on-the fly sensitivity changes just like any mouse worth it's weight) which since my gimbal was designed to utilize from the very start -works out really well. Again I reiterate -this is not the norm- and much effort was required to do this.  \n\n&gt;-**attributes** (effects)\n\n&gt;**Airplane stick:**    \n\n&gt;**-moves in pitch/roll** (unnatural range of motion, not reflexively intuitive)  \n**-spring centering, most likely with detents** (fights inputs, negative interactions across the axes center's)  \n**-requires deadzones** (distracting, imprecise, disconnected feeling between inputs and in-game reactions, wasted range of motion)  \n**-uses relative inputs** (mech movements wind up either too slow or uncontrollable, difficult to not to overshoot past target, combined with the first 3 problems adds up to a non-viable control option)    \n\n&gt;**Mouse:**   \n\n&gt;**-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane** (natural range of movement of the reticule)  \n**-has no spring centering or detents** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted movement)  \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across centers no different than any other point in x/y)  \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)    \n\n&gt;**My stick:**  \n\n&gt;**-moves in zenith/azimuth** (pitch/twist -natural range of movement of the mech)  \n**-no spring centering/detents, but has tensioned/greased rubs** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted smooth damped movement, holds position when not being moved therefore maintains physical orientation related to on-screen state)  \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across center no different than any other point in x/y)  \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)   \n\n&gt;For anyone that doesn't understand the significance of RELATIVE vs ABSOLUTE, here is an analogy: Picture a 12\" square sheet of glass and a marble sitting on it. Using relative inputs is like trying to move the marble by picking up the sheet of glass with the marble balanced on it and tilting it front/back and side/side, quickly leveling it again when it's where you want it to be in x/y coordinates. Using absolute inputs however would be like placing the same piece glass level on a desk in front of you and using your hand to reach out and directly move the marble wherever you want on the plane, and for this reason are also called direct inputs.  \n\n&gt;Just like piloting a mech with relative inputs is ... less than optimal, so is piloting an aircraft using absolute inputs. These are just not interchangeable design criteria, and the peripherals used to operate these vertial craft need to be specifically suited for the input type or the results are, well quite predictably precisely what is being experienced and shared by users that made it through the technical challenges and managed to get their airplane stick to work with MWO with as dialed-in of settings as possible. Some adapt to it, but mostly by piloting s l o w heavies or assaults, since with relative inputs you have to balance reaction speed vs accuracy, achieving neither in the process. You can get away with it in an Atlas, but not a Commando...   \n\nHere is the [relevant thread it is from](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1c52od/mwo_joystick_controls_worth_it/), as it contained much useful discussion as well.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367203717", "subreddit": "mechwarrior", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've been to Lucern and Zurich in Switzerland, Olympia and Athens in Greece, Cologne, Berlin, and Munich (primarily), Paris, Rome, Istanbul and Izmir in Turkey, Prague, Amsterdam, Sweden (Popped over the border from Copenhagen for lunch just to say I've been there), Copenhagen, and Edinburgh, Glasgow, Scotland. \n\nGermany is kind of lost on me now since that's where I'm studying, but I have to say that Cologne is a pretty cool city. the Dom (cathedral) is one of the most amazing sights I've seen. It's a beautiful example of Gothic Architecture.....I wasn't a big fan of Berlin. I can't tell you what I was expecting when I went there, but it wasn't what I got. \n\nI was only in Munich for Oktoberfest, and although it is one of the most touristy things you could ever do in your life, I'd say DO IT. It's drunk and crazy and fucking wild. But it's one of those things I was happiest doing once. \n\nLet's see. Lucerne is A M A Z I N G. Straight out of movies and paintings guys, just beyond beautiful. Fucking expensive, but all of Switzerland is. Zurich is very metropolitan, doesn't have the same type of beauty as Lucerne but still a cool city. \n\nParis, nothing to say that hasn't already been said. Beautiful, everyone should go if they have the chance, but overrated. It disappointed me. \n\nAmsterdam was cool. I don't do trees, but I liked the feel of the city. Anne Frank's house and museum was REALLY emotional, and one of the most incredible things I've ever seen. And I was almost killed by bikes twice...they don't stop so look out.\n\nIzmir and Istanbul are two really different cities. The actual city of Izmir kinda looks a bit shady, but the country side is BEAUTIFUL. I couldn't believe the hills we drove on! Really amazing. Istanbul is a really unique city, I wouldn't recommend going about on your own, (we had a tour group) but all the mosques and the outdoor markets and everything was just amazing. \n\nPrague, Beautiful. I want to go back so bad. Everything is dirt cheap and the old town is amazing. \n\nAthens and Olympia disappointed me the most. Olympia is really dirty and falling apart, and I felt terrible for the locals whose only way of suriving is the tourists. I mean that can be said for most tourist places, but I've never really seen a town like that. The ruins in Olympia are cool...but they really are big piles of stones. Really cool. I'm happy I saw them, but disappointing over all. \n\nAthens is NOTHING like the pictures of Greece you see advertised. Those places with the blue and white houses and the ocean in the background exist for sure, but mostly on the Greek isles. The ruins in Athens were amazing, the Acropolis was LEGIT and crazy to see, but that's it. Other than that Athens wasn't especially beautiful or anything.\n\nCopenhagen, cool place. Expensive. Kinda reminded me a lot of Amsterdam. Little mermaid statue was cool. \n\nI just went to Sweden for lunch so I can't really comment.  I saw a fucking huge ass Ikea though.\n\nEdinburgh AMAZING. Beautiful. Big city without the feel of a big city at all. It was like walking around in Harry Potter in some parts of the city. Awesome people. SO FRIENDLY. I would move there in two seconds. \n\nGlasgow, smaller than Edinburgh. Still friendly people. The train station is really pretty, I don't think I've ever seen such a nice train station. But not as beautiful architecturally as Edinburgh. \n\nRome was nice. Overrated. Beautiful though. The food was pretty good I got a calzone bigger than my FACE at one of the restaurants.

The digital problems are actually super easy (no, really) to work around for anyone using TARGET (Thrustmaster's kick ass kbm emulator for the Cougar, Warthog, or T16000 sticks, which yes I have scripts for if anyone needs...). Anyone that wants to explore this to it's fullest themselves should pick up a Thrustmaster T16000 ($40) since it is the fastest/cheapest ticket for sailing right past all the little technical hurdles that keeps most of this stuff shrouded in mystery and confusion.  \n\n&gt;The stick I built specifically addresses the mechanical shortcomings that all airplane joysticks share plus since it runs TARGET, among many other incredibly useful things, allows me to use absolute inputs and have a very fine degree of control over the exes (including on-the fly sensitivity changes just like any mouse worth it's weight) which since my gimbal was designed to utilize from the very start -works out really well. Again I reiterate -this is not the norm- and much effort was required to do this.  \n\n&gt;-**attributes** (effects)\n\n&gt;**Airplane stick:**    \n\n&gt;**-moves in pitch/roll** (unnatural range of motion, not reflexively intuitive)  \n**-spring centering, most likely with detents** (fights inputs, negative interactions across the axes center's)  \n**-requires deadzones** (distracting, imprecise, disconnected feeling between inputs and in-game reactions, wasted range of motion)  \n**-uses relative inputs** (mech movements wind up either too slow or uncontrollable, difficult to not to overshoot past target, combined with the first 3 problems adds up to a non-viable control option)    \n\n&gt;**Mouse:**   \n\n&gt;**-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane** (natural range of movement of the reticule)  \n**-has no spring centering or detents** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted movement)  \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across centers no different than any other point in x/y)  \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)    \n\n&gt;**My stick:**  \n\n&gt;**-moves in zenith/azimuth** (pitch/twist -natural range of movement of the mech)  \n**-no spring centering/detents, but has tensioned/greased rubs** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted smooth damped movement, holds position when not being moved therefore maintains physical orientation related to on-screen state)  \n**-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across center no different than any other point in x/y)  \n**-uses absolute inputs** (obvious and easy to control, very precise)   \n\n&gt;For anyone that doesn't understand the significance of RELATIVE vs ABSOLUTE, here is an analogy: Picture a 12\" square sheet of glass and a marble sitting on it. Using relative inputs is like trying to move the marble by picking up the sheet of glass with the marble balanced on it and tilting it front/back and side/side, quickly leveling it again when it's where you want it to be in x/y coordinates. Using absolute inputs however would be like placing the same piece glass level on a desk in front of you and using your hand to reach out and directly move the marble wherever you want on the plane, and for this reason are also called direct inputs.  \n\n&gt;Just like piloting a mech with relative inputs is ... less than optimal, so is piloting an aircraft using absolute inputs. These are just not interchangeable design criteria, and the peripherals used to operate these vertial craft need to be specifically suited for the input type or the results are, well quite predictably precisely what is being experienced and shared by users that made it through the technical challenges and managed to get their airplane stick to work with MWO with as dialed-in of settings as possible. Some adapt to it, but mostly by piloting s l o w heavies or assaults, since with relative inputs you have to balance reaction speed vs accuracy, achieving neither in the process. You can get away with it in an Atlas, but not a Commando...   \n\nHere is the [relevant thread it is from](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1c52od/mwo_joystick_controls_worth_it/), as it contained much useful discussion as well.

I took it all and sat at the 10-20 no limit game. Things went well, I more than doubled my bank roll in a few hours, and I was hovering right around $10,000. Then, the rounders hand happened. I was dealt A Q, I lay out a raise to 80 and get about 4 callers if I remember correctly, and we go to the flop. A Q 2. I lay out a few hundred dollars, and the played to my left raises it up to about 1200, a pretty obvious overbet, so one player folds, the other calls, and so do I. The turn card is another Q, giving me the full boat and second nuts. The only hand that can beat me is A A and no one raised pre flop and the guy that raised to 1200 surely would not do that with top set post flop. I think I am golden, I check. Guy to my left bets out 2000 or so, the person to his left smooth calls, seemingly on some sort of draw with too much money in his pocket. I also smooth call as I wish to draw as much money as possible on the river. River card comes and its a 7, so no worries there. I check, next guy drops the bet to 800, the next guy raises to 2000 and I shove everything in the middle, so theres close to 25k to 30k in the middle now. The aggressor folds, and I had lost track of the other player in the hand. As I reach out for the pot, I hear from my right, \"Call!\" and I immediately know whats happened. He turns over A A, I show my A Q, losing Q Q Q A A to A A A Q Q. I lost around 10k that night, and my stomach hasn't retreated back into its normal spot in my abdomen yet. It hangs loosely just about my waste. I wanted to cry and turn the table over but I simply tapped the felt, said good hand, walked to my car, and drove home in silence. I told no one for a number of years. To this day I have only played poker live twice since then, both times I won handily, but I just can't risk my own money at the table anymore. Craps is a different story, but poker, I'm either being staked or I am not playing. \n\ntl:dr I lost 10k in one hand at 21 years old to either the worst or best poker player in the world.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367362161", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I'd say pentatonic: C D E G A. Throw in low A and high C so you can play minor and major pentatonic; that leaves two notes and gives A C D E G A C. From there you could add F and B and finish the scale, giving you a full octave of major scale and a near-full octave of minor scale; D# for minor blues in A and then either G# for a more interesting blues scale or high D or low G for more range; or do what disaster_Face said and add more bass, probably a low F and G -- bVI bVII i is a common minor key progression in pop music (or at least some; Dismantled uses it in most of his songs) and F G C are IV V I in C major. And if you have that low A, you can play the vi IV V I progression that the vast majority of pop music out there is based on.\n\nI'd probably go F G A C D E G A C, although I'd raise it so the major pentatonic scale is on D because my main instrument is mountain dulcimer.
