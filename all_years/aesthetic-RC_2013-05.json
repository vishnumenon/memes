{"body": "[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1065nd/ive_decided_to_try_to_master_finger_picking_any/c6b48i7) I made a while back describes a right hand exercise that would serve you well in this situation.\n\n&gt;Classical curricula use the PIMA system to denote the fingers on the right hand. Because classical guitar is all fingerpicking you can learn some very basic, very simple classical pieces and exercises to rapidly improve your skill.\n\n&gt;Let's start with PIMA. On the right hand P = thumb, I = Index finger, M = Middle finger, A = Ring finger. The pinky is unused.\n\n&gt;Knowing this you can learn Home Position. Skipping all information about classical posture and positioning of the instrument, Home Position is as follows.\n\n&gt;Place P on either the sixth or fifth string. Place I on the third string. Place M on the second string. Place A on the first string. Remember, the first string (string one) is the one closest to the floor (high e) and string six is the one closest to your face (low E.) Do not brace any part of your hand against any part of the guitar (no, not even your unused pinky.)\n\n&gt;Rest your fingers in home position and allow your hand to relax, arching your fingers slightly.\n\n&gt;Now begin with the following exercise.\n\n&gt;Pluck the string you are resting P on, then place P back on that string, silencing it. Practice this a few times. Then pluck the string I is on, and then rest I back on that string (string 3, the G string,) silencing it. Practice this a few times. Do this for each finger. Try to keep the fingers that are not plucking resting on the strings in Home Position.\n\n&gt;Now try to do P, then I. Remember to rest your fingers back on the strings between each pluck. Then try to add M. PIM. Then add A. PIMA.\n\n&gt;Now try P I M A M I... P I M A M I... P I M A M I. As you become comfortable with this pattern you will be able to speed up. As you speed up it becomes less important to rest your fingers back on the string. This is only to train your hand to automatically seek home position, which you will become comfortable with very quickly.\n\n&gt;Once you are comfortable with that you must learn to alternate fingers. Learn to alternate IM, MA, and IA. This is called picado in classical guitar terminology. Try not to double strike with the same finger. You don't want to end up playing IIIII MMM AAA or patterns like that except in certain circumstances, in which case the thumb usually breaks up the double strikes; for example, PMPMPM is fairly common in pieces that are preparing you for tremolo technique. A good way to practice picado picking is by using scales.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367401458", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Make all laws in laymen's terms. Why the insane legalese?\n\nIt all comes down to the problem of what law is, what language is, and what it means to \"interpret\" a statement.  I'm a programmer, so I'm going to work with that as an analogy. I'm going to come out and say, this is a bit long, but the explanation builds on itself.  Bear with me, this starts out a bit dense, but once we get going I think you'll see what I'm getting at.\n\nEverything starts with language- but first, we have to figure out what language is! \n\nAt the most basic level, a language is a predefined system of relating \"signs\" to \"meanings\".  A \"sign\", in the semiotic sense (semiotics is the study of... well, what we're talking about right now) is anything which can be interpreted as having a \"meaning\" which is something other than itself- it is a 'something' which can act as a medium of information.  As a simple example, the word APPLE is a textual representation (or encoding) of a concept of \"a red fruit which grows on trees\".  Let's represent this relationship like this:  [ A P P L E ] &lt;-&gt; \"red fruit which grows on trees\". This relation is defined as \"is defined as\". The language called \"written English\" is a set of relationships between sequences of glyphs and \"meanings\". When I want to communicate this concept, I encode it into a sign: that particular sequence of glyphs.  You then decode, or *interpret*, that sign back into the concept \"red fruit which grows on trees\".\n\nThe problem, though, is that we both know that [A P P L E] doesn't just represent \"red fruit that grows on trees\".  It carries other meanings along with it.  Due to the way our brains work, [A P P L E] has links of varying strengths to lots of different concepts.  What ends up happening is that over time, signs collect meanings in the form of definitions.  These definitions are often ambiguous- the relationship between signs and meanings is often many-to-many, and one must depend on context to select the correct interpretation.  Miscommunication occurs when two people select different interpretations of the same sign which they are trying to use to communicate.  To further complicate matters, one or both communicators may not be aware that a sign has a meaning.  Thankfully, for the most part, these are generally edge cases, and ambiguity has a lot of value- it's very useful to communication if it's possible to use many different signs whose sets of meanings overlap- communicators can use different signs in concert to narrow down the meaning they're trying to capture.\n\nSo how do we actually USE language?  The use of language we're talking about right now is \"use language to encode desired events in the real world\".  An example is a programming language- a subset of all languages.  The idea behind programming is actually pretty philosophically clever- it relies on the idea that we can actually interact with the \"real world\" using signs!  Without getting too far off topic, if we carefully define the relationships between signs and actions, and design machines which are specifically designed to respond certain ways to certain signs, we can encode desired sequences of actions in the same way we encode meanings in languages- using signs!  The thing is, for these machines to be useful, we must have unambiguous relationships between signs and actions.  In computers, a relatively small set of sign-to-action definitions can be composed to form all sorts of useful actions.  Furthermore, when we create a bunch of machines which all respond the same way, *we've defined a language of meaningful actions*. \n\nWhere else do we see this sort of mapping of signs to desired actions?  Yep, that's right- the legal system.\n\nLaws are essentially, the source code for organized groups of people.  They represent actions that should be taken, given certain circumstances.  However, this language only works if it's unambiguous.  The problem is basically that legalese is the result of a bunch of lawyers hacking functionality into the legal system to get it to do what they want it to.  The people who find loopholes in the law are basically hackers of the legal system, finding ways to exploit edge cases, interactions between different laws, and bugs (misinterpreted laws).  Add to this that the system is *also* pretty glitchy (people don't always obey the legal system) and we can finally conclude that legalese is basically just code which is written specifically to hold up against exploitation of ambiguity in the language our legal system was written in.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367405278", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Goto the dollar tree and get a big poster paper or something. Take a ruler and make a giant guitar fretboard diagram. Let's pretend you wanna see C major all over the fretboard. So you take colored markers or colored pencils and choose one noticeable color for each of the 7 notes. Now you can either choose to do the letters, or numbers, or just straight up color in the boxes with those 7 colors in the pattern of the major scale shapes all across the fretboard. The colors help you see and play patterns. So you can easily spot the patterns to play, C, E, G ,B up and down several octaves, and so on. Now I'll transition to something else and come back to the fretboard.\n\nHere's one simple thing to help you understand a mode. There are 3 major modes (scales starting from the 1st tone, 4th, and 5th, aka C, F, and G), and the 3 minor modes, (2, 3, and 6th tones), and the half diminished (B, or 7th tone). To make your playing sound like it's in a particular mode, you have to center your playing around the chord tones of the chord in that mode, as well as the notes that are different between the same scale types.\n\nFor example: You want to sound like you're in Lydian mode, the 4th mode in the natural major key. The other scales within that major mode type are Ionian and Mixolydian. The unique note that Lydian has is that the 4th note is raised, aka it has an augmented 4th rather than a perfect.  Mixolydian's unique note is its minor 7th, making it extremely easy to hear that a song is in Mixolydian if it revolves around a major chord with a minor 7th. In Lydian mode, you'll hear a spacey, psychedelic, or whatever kinda vibe when you hear someone going up a major arpeggio and hitting that 5th note before dropping down a half step to the 4th. In the other two major keys, the 4th is a whole step away from the 5th, only Lydian has a half step between 4th and 5th (and a whole step between the third, and the change between the 4th to the 5th or 3rd is what gives your hear that sense that it's getting all spacey and stuff, like Steve Vai's songs that sound like he's hitting more whole tones and making bigger leaps).\n\nSo to sound like you're in that mode, look at the unique note intervals that differ from the other scales of that same type (if a minor mode, just look at the other minor mode scales and see their differences), and bring them out in your playing. How can you tell someone is playing A harmonic minor rather than A Aeolian? If it sounds more evil or dark, you're probably hearing that raised 7th, because that's the difference right there between those two scales.\n\nNow that's only half of it. Now you gotta ask, why do those unique notes matter? Because in chord progressions, you want to add those unique notes as extended notes to those chords. So in lydian, you add a raised 4th, or #11 (you want that note to be an octaved 4th away, or it will clash with the other notes, particularly the 5th), and you can get a lydian progression feel by playing the lydian's tonic chord and the major chord right after it, or if you're looking at it from the original major scale that the lydian was derived, you're playing the 4th and 5th chords. There are other lydian progressions, but that's a commonly used one for backing tracks.\n\nSo now back to your fretboard diagram for the visual aid. For each mode, learn the scale up and down, but most importantly, learn to do extended arpeggios. For example, for F lydian (C major), hit the notes F A C E for the major 7th arpeggio, then skip the octave F and hit the G B D. If that's too hard to keep in your head, here's a super easy way to do it: Just hit every other note in that scale shape as you count to 7 . That whole thing is a heptatonic arpeggio, or 7 note arpeggio that goes across 2 octaves. Go ahead and just make it octotonic so you can hit the F so it sounds more in the F chord (if you're playing the F chord or any chord that's after or before the ones next to it). \n\nSo instead of going F G A B to hit that unique raised 4th (B note), you can do an arpeggio from F A C E G B and hit the 4th an octave up, and then either hit the next note up or down to hit the 5th or 3rd to land on a chord tone (unless the chord being played has the B in it, in which case you can prebend from the 5th to the B, or bend up from the 3rd to the B, or whichever way makes it sound the way you like),\n\nSo work on two things, using the fretboard chart to speed you through doing heptatonic arpeggio patterns from each mode (hitting every other note until you've hit the tonic note again basically, or keep going and going til you run out of frets), and working on playing around the unique notes that each mode has, and forming extended chords that include octaves of those unique notes. You can do an Fmaj7 with an octave 4th, the B note, and then do another chord that the B note too, like a Cmaj7 where the B is the 7th this time. So you got two chords that are telling you \"Hey, pay attention to this B note I used in two major chords\".\n\nAnytime you work on developing your own licks, put on the appropriate backing track, or record your own. Don't try to develop a mixolydian, dorian, or aeolian lick without listening to chord progressions that are appropriate for each of those modes, because the most important part is listening to the combination of what you're playing and which chords are being played. Let your brain-to-ear-to-brain action subconsciously work out when you're doing it \"right\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367477587", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

He answers about a debris hut being easy enough to construct.  OP also mentions that his favorite place to go away for \"months\" is the desert.  I've built a hundred debris huts and I've spent days in the desert on my own and I can tell you that those concepts are incompatible.  Deserts don't provide anywhere near enough material to construct a debris hut.  He also says that he'd bring a water bottle (but not a cook container or a filter), then goes on to say that he's only \"dranken\" untreated water two or three times in his life.   It's not conclusive, it's just odd.\n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9ixe53   -  Here we have a long, verbose answer discussing his hallucinations.  One of his longest answers and it's about almost dying of thirst, but when asked about edibles he replies \"sorrels\".\n\nWhich leads me to...\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9iv892\n\nshaneroben - \"what are some plants you like to forage\"    -  GREAT question to ask a survival instructor!!!  What brilliant answer does dirtbag come up with ...\n\"the eatin' kind\".    When asked for specifics he replies \"sorrel\"!   Interestingly enough, like the debris hut, eating sorrel isn't a possibility in the desert.   You'd be hard pressed to stay alive eating only sorrel even if you were in a place where it was abundant.   When I talk about my long cross-country expeditions people always ask me what I eat; it's inevitably one of the first things I'm asked.  I couldn't imagine giving a foolish answer like this and then not backing it up with anything.  I describe how I harvest and prepare cattails and arrowhead tubers, how I season rabbits with wild sage or make tea out of White Pine needles.  I can give the growing seasons, locations, Latin and proper names for each thing I eat in the wild and I can describe how to prepare it so that it'll taste... better.   Wouldn't THAT be the sort of answer that a \"survival expert\" would give to an aspiring cook?  Telling him how to make acorn flour from wild acorns, or how to grill cattail roots like a corn on the cob, or how to roast arrowhead tubers in the coals to get them perfect?  That's what a \"survival and outdoors skill\" instructor would answer.  I'm embarrased for dirtbag for this pathetic answer.  To shaneroben- I suggest obtaining a copy of \"The Foragers Harvest\" (Samuel Thayer) and \"Stalking the Wild Asparagus\" (Euelle Gibbons), in which they discuss the REALITIES of eating food you gather yourself.  I promise they'll give you more reply than our dirtbagteacher here!\n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9iv1qx   -  Now it starts getting deep!  He claims to have \"made bows\", but hasn't used that skill to get meat?  Pffffftt!  B U L L S H I T.  If you haven't used a self-made bow to kill an animal then you don't have that skill.  Same with trapping.   I know many primitive skills guys that make their own bows and it takes a lot of practice to become proficient with them.  Regardless, our intrepid dirtbag here doesn't need a bow, he's a vegetarian.  I can't IMAGINE how he'd survive in the desert by not eating meat, it's incomprehensible.  When I lived in the high deserts of Utah I spent DAYS gathering pine nuts when they were available and I still had to have a snare line with 20 traps to get enough rabbits to keep me full.  I guess he's so gorged on sorrel that he's not wasting his time with something as foolish as eating meat roasted over a fire!  And I wonder how he teaches his \"students\" how to use traps when he's never done it himself?  Hopefully he's not a swimming instructor!\n\nOf course, he's a fan of Christopher McCandles (the stunning failure of survival that modern hippy-outdoorsmen-wannabe's drool over).  Starving to death when surrounded by abundance because you don't have any skills?  Sounds perfect for our dirtbagsurvivalist here!\n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9iu11f   -  When asked \"Where do you get these skills\" it's again, very vague answers surrounded in generic fluff.  \"Travel and do stuff\".  The guy learned how to build traps and bows by being a camp councelor?    No more answers in the thread when asked for specifics.\n\n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9ivhp2   -  Here it is!  His FAVORITE place, the place where the sorrel eating, vegetarian, debris hut building guy lived for THREE MONTHS, was the DESERT!   NO SORREL, NO FOREST DEBRIS... and it's his favorite place!   More fluffy speak and no details about how a vegetarian survived in the sorrel-poor deserts!   His most important skill; \"His outlook\". Perfect answer for mentally weak morons that use the word \"feel\" a lot.  As for the solar still, surely that's been debunked enough by professionals (like Ron Hood, Alan Halcon, Dude McClean) that I dont' even need to do the research.  Of course, the vegetarian OP manages to get enough food in the desert so I'm sure he manages to make the solar still  produce gallons of potable each day.  OP also mentions eating slices of cactus or extracting water from them.  And that's really where I knew he was full of shit, that's the perfect answer for someone that's read a 60 year old Army Survival Manual and the perfect load of horseshit for anyone that's spent time in desert country.  Cactii and other succulents are BITTER and DISGUSTING!   I've never ONCE found a cactii, even the barrel cactus, where this is a possibility.  Maybe you'll grind out a few drops of putrid, bitter water but anyone that knows survival knows this is a joke.  OP also mentions false pineapple WITHOUT mentioning that parts of it are poisonous.  \n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9iwvh8   - OP mentions, in his hipster fashion, how rabbitstick and wintercount just aren't hard core enough for him.  I wonder if he's ever been?  I've attended each of them a few times and have the pictures and the contacts to prove it.  Any pictures?  Can you tell who the teachers were when you were there?  Any famous trackers do any famous coyote tracking? (If you don't know what I mean by that question then you've never been to a rabbitstick).  The forum and internet bullshit comment makes me think he's the kind of douche that never gets invited to the real cool kid parties and ends up circle jerking about how bad they are.  I've learned some of the best skills at these gatherings.   \n\nHis comments about the concentric rings of nature makes me think that he's familiar with Jon Young of the Wilderness Ways School, or TBJ from his school.  Jon Young actually produced a tape/CD series called \"Concentric rings of nature\" where he talks about bird calls.  OP is a lot like the TBJ fan-club, long on stories about \"feeling nature\" and short on hard details.  I'd say he ripped that sentence right out of those CD's, I'm going to listen to them this weekend again and see.   I've also, in my entire life of hunting and living in bear country, never heard birds go \"Crazy\" at night because a BEAR was around.  BEARS ARE NOCTURNAL HUNTERS and frequently move quietly through the woods.  Obviously, OP's much more in touch with nature than anyone else.\n\n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9iy6go   -  He's never been \"far north\" enough to get into bear country.   But he's familiar with debris huts and sheep sorrel.   Nah, bullshit.\n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9iwy5q   -   OP asked about primitive fire skills, he replies that the hand bow is \"a pain\" and \"difficult to learn\".  No shit, brainchild.  All outdoor skills (like his making his own bow for hunting) take time to learn and fail the first few dozen time you do them.  Here's a video of a REAL survival instructor and expert demonstrating how much of a pain the bow drill is.   \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evMGrz_84YQ\n\nWhy is it so easy for Alan?  Because he's REALLY done this skill a thousand times before, he's done it so many times he can't get it wrong.\n\nHe says that mag lenses scratch but \"Are fun\".  I can't imagine this doofus' teaching a survival class.  \"oh gosh, have fun and be openminded!\"   Perfect Chris McCandles way to die in the woods like a fool.\n\nOf course, he knows skills that aren't just from Indians... but from INDIGENOUS INDIANS!   That's the best kind!\n\nhttp://en.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cprfp/iama_21_year_old_male_whos_lived_outside_for_over/c9ix3as  And here's where I know he's full of shit, for sure.  \"Don't let your lack of experience hodl you back\"  &lt;-- Who the FUCK says that?

{"body": "&gt;why is C G E A a C6 chord and not a Cmaj6?\n\nC6 and Cmaj6 are the same chord.  It is simply written as C6 although you may see it written as Cmaj6.  Either way, it's the same chord.  It's a major triad (C E G) with the 6th note added.\n\n&gt;I understand the G11 thing but why is the F note a b7?\n\nThe F note is the b7 (read: flat 7th) of the G major scale.  I think I confused you by not specifying that the b7 note is in relation to the chord's tonic note which in this case is a G note.  Sorry about that.\n\nWhen you're figuring out how to name a chord, you relate it to the notes of the major scale of the tonic (i.e. root note) of the the chord.  So for a G chord we have the following notes of the G major scale:\n\nG A B C D E F#\n\nG = root note\n\nA = major 2nd\n\nB = major 3rd\n\nC = Perfect 4th\n\nD = Perfect 5th\n \nE = Major 6th\n\nF# = Major 7th\n\nSince we need to move that F# to an F in our G chord, we make it a b7 note.  That's just the formula for making a dominant chord:\n\n1, 3, 5, b7\n\nWe're just taking the 7th degree of the scale (F#) and moving it down a half-step (F).\n\nAnd if you add in the 4th degree to a 7th chord, you get an 11 chord (7th+4th = 11).  Add the 2nd degree to a 7th chord, you get a 9th chord (7th+2nd = 9).  Add the 6th degree to a 7th chord, you get a 13th.\n\n&gt;And is there difference between capital letters in music?\n\nSome jazz books use shorthand that notate major and minor by using M or m respectively.

The pattern in terms of Half and Whole steps is...\n\nW W H W W W H\n\nIf you started on G, to achieve the same pattern, when you got to E, you'd need to make a whole step, so you play n F# followed by a half step to G.\n\nThe key is based on the tonic, or I chord.  It's the harmonic focal point of a key.  It's also the note you start on for a give scale.\n\nYour learn scales partially to be adept at playing in given keys with generally decent fingerings for given passages (partially out of muscle memory from scale practice).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367683344", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I have an appointment to get to, but I hope to run into you here again. Take care of yourself and enjoy the party!'\n\nThat is a long winded example of the sort of angle I take in remembering their name. I also remember to take a good look at their face and mannerisms.

{"body": "It really depends on what kind of a star you've got there. You should familiarize yourself with spectral types - stars are rated by temperature, and sorted into categories from hottest to coldest, which are O B A F G K M, and then L, T, and Y for brown dwarfs. Most habitable stars would be from F to M. \n\n* F stars are bright white, and put off more UV and ultraviolet than the sun. Plant life could use any light available, so it would be a variety of colors. Around brighter F stars, you might see plants that are washed-out, clear, or white, as they might need to reflect most of the ambient light. \n* G stars are the category the sun belongs to, and they are yellow-white. Contrary to the situation now, the first photosynthesizers on Earth were purple, not green. Other photosynthesizers used the left-over frequencies instead of the more prevalent yellow-green light, and then outcompeted the purple photosynthesizers. Depending on the pigment used, photosynthetic organisms on Earth are Green, Red, Yellow-brown, or Purple. Any of these are possibilities around a G star. \n* K stars are yellow to orange, and are typically the smallest stars you would find an earth-like planet around. The range of colors would be similar, but might be more muted as there is simply less light around. Plants might be dark green, deep purple, dark red, or even black. \n* M stars range from orange to red, but they are so cool and the habitable zone is so close to the star that anything orbiting them is probably tidally locked. If these worlds do have photosynthesizers, they are almost certainly utilizing all of the light available. They would be so darkly colored that they would appear black. \n\nYou don't need to drop very far to get to a star that has almost no UV compared to the sun. A G star slightly less hot than the sun quickly drops to almost no UV. Conversely, a star a little hotter than the sun creates exponentially more UV.\n\nContrary to what others have said, red light has plenty of energy to drive photosynthesis. This isn't really a concern. You might need different pigments, but pretty much anything in the near IR to UV range is useful for photosynthesis. \n\nI'm going to do some math, and then come back with more detailed info about peak wavelengths and plant color.

{"body": "This is my first time posting in one of these threads, and our group is about 9 sessions into a custom campaign. I'll leave out most of the details of the campaign up until now, BUT I'd be more than happy to fill in more detail if anyone's interested.\n\nThis campaign is my first time playing a tabletop, my first time GMing, and my first time creating a campaign. I'm having a blast, and my players seem to be having fun, too! We're all pretty good friends, and have good chemistry outside the game. There are 4 PCs: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Cleric.\n\nOur fighter, Aata, is the most vanilla of the bunch, reflecting from his IRL personality; however, even he gets sucked into the rogue's antics. Our rogue, \"Sneaky\" Sal is a 210lbs, about 5' tall, pantless, former used horse salesmen. His butthole is damaged from a previous session. There is so much to say about our Rogue... it constitutes its own post. Our wizard, Cyrus, is light, grey-haired, and very flamboyant. His player is very experienced with tabletops, and especially with GMing, so he's been a big help. Our cleric, Sen, came into the game about 3 sessions in. She was introduced to the party at a tavern, and immediately rolled to \"Lead the party,\" successfully stealing away leadership from Sal.\n\nThis session, Sal's player was unavailable for play, so Sal went on a hunger/action strike since, in the previous session, he was unable to get a Ghost's 'phone number' and she was not interested in his advances. An NPC, Etriet, had travelled with them for 2 sessions, and was going to leave, but stayed with them a bit longer to make up for Sal's inaction. Etriet is travelling with the party in hopes of finding his friend who he believes was kidnapped and taken to Drauz, the content the party recently sailed to. The party has been following the trail of an evil priest, Dyanker, who basically invited them to travel to Drauz to find him. \n\nSo, during this session the Party made their way to the Capital. It took 3 days of travel through dead forests and dead forested mountains to reach the former capital, Drauz City. Before reaching the gate, the party encountered a patrolling Flesh Golem. The fighter's killing blow to the Flesh Golem's scrotum sliced its body into two halves. \n\nUpon reaching the city, they found that it was protected by a very tall and thick wall, and the gate into the city was sealed with a powerful magic. The seal had 8 symbols, one of which was already glowing, which they reasoned out to be glowing because of a puzzle they had solved while entering the country through a port. They identified one of the symbols, a forest, as likely having something to do with an eastern forested area of the country. So, they walked.\n\nWhile travelling through the forest, they stumbled upon a clearing that looked a bit more 'green' than the surrounding dead forest. Entering the clearing, the party noticed 3 distinct paths: North, East, and West. A stone tablet with an engraving was embedded in the soil at the center of the clearing. It read \"Konami's Code.\" Everyone smirked. They knew, as players, that they had the knowledge to solve the puzzle. Sen's player started saying the Konami Code out-loud, but Cyrus' player \"corrected\" her, indicating that he believed that the code was up down up down left right, no second left right.\nSo, they entered the pathways through that order. After the first north, they came to a tabletless clearing, and again, and again. When they reached the end of their supposed konami code... Sen yelled \"B A START\" out loud... Nothing. Cyrus yelled \"A B START\" ... nothing. They headed south in desperation, and ended up back at the clearing with the tablet. They went west, they went east. They were convinced I was meta-gaming them. They started trying other codes. Eventually Aata remembered that they had made it very far without seeing the tablet originally, and perhaps they were missing something. Sen remembered that she thought it was left right left right. They tried it, and it worked.\n\nThey came to another clearing with a tablet. They were expecting instructions on how to input \"B A START\" into the game, but... this tablet read \"The path of a clock through the course of a day.\"\n\nSen was confused, but Cyrus and Aata figured it out almost immediately and simultaneously. They went N E S W N E S W N and came upon another clearing, different looking than before, but with no tablet.\nThere were no instructions. The party thought they had messed something up. Aata and Cyrus were confused... \n\nSen decided to search the area, and found an imprint in the grass on the ground. Sen also noticed that this forest was much more verdant than before, and that the paths ahead looked even thicker. The imprint in the grass was one of a snake-like dragon weaving in and out, back and forth. They started walking single file across the imprint from tail to head, and heard chattering of birds, as if the birds were laughing at the party. They decided to try heading down the paths as the dragon's path seemed to indicate.\n\nThey finally reached a clearing with no paths besides the one from which they entered. There, they found a glowing mist at the center of the clearing, with the forest's edges being too thick to move through.  The wizard detected magic from the mist, but was unable to identify what it was. Sen guessed that it was probably some sort of elemental, but Cyrus was not convinced. He casted mage armor on himself, which roused the mist. The mist shifted and swayed, and the sound of a waking old human seemed to come from the mist. The party began to talk to the mist, and it revealed that it had been protecting the forest for many thousands of years, but despite his best efforts, sometimes adventurers of enough intelligence or power made it through. The party indicated that they came seeking a piece of a seal, and the mist revealed that it knew of the seal keeper, and would allow the party to see the seal keeper, warning that the seal keeper was very unhappy. \n\nBefore the mist left, they asked who the mist was, and what his name was. He revealed that his name was lost to his memory, and to time, and that he was once a human, and was tasked with protecting the forest from misuse and harm. He was given his current form in order to better accomplish his task. With that question answered the group bid the mist farewell. The mist began to dissipate and slink into the forest, revealing a Bone Devil standing before them. The party readied themselves, but Sen asked the Bone Devil \"Are you the seal keeper?\" The bone devil responded, \"I was tasked with keeping the seal away from powerful adventurers, and this is all fate can serve me? I'm disappointed.\" The party, with the help of the Good characters Etriet and Sen, were able to defeat the Bone Devil. His body fell into a pile of bones, with his skull, still glowing and alive, landing on top. Party asked him what he was doing here, who put him there, and where the seal was. The Bone Devil revealed that his name was Ky'Detra, and he was tasked with protecting this seal piece about 1000 years ago by the King of Drauz, Aa'Nydat. He revealed a tear in their plane where the seal stone dropped out. Sen asked Ky'Detra what he was going to do next. He responded by asking the group to send him home to his plane, but no one was capable of doing so. Aata asked the group if he could bring the skull along, and despite Sen's protest, he stuffed the skull in a bag and began to carry it. It was then that Aata discovered that Ky'Detra was telepathic--it spoke to his mind after Aata decided to call him \"Ky\" for short. \"Do you even know what that means?\" Aata was surprised, and the group began to discuss whether it was a good idea to carry a telepathic skull around. Some OOC conversations occurred, and we decided on some rules for the skull (that made it less likely that the skull was going to 'give up' the party by just telepathically broadcasting to anyone). After that, Aata asked what \"Ky\" meant. Ky'Detra revealed that it was a detail in their language long lost to time. It meant \"Keen, Keen edged, or Keen bladed.\" When asked what Detra meant, Ky'Detra paused, \"... It means fate, or destiny. Completely, the name means someone with an important fate or destiny.\" Ky'Detra fell silent and the party exited the forest.\n\n\nThere were a lot of jokes and shenanigans throughout the session that are hard to keep track of, but it was a pretty hilarious session despite Sal not being around. Normally he is our comic relief, but we made out okay with a few laughs despite him not being around. \n\nTyping this all out was a lot of fun, and if anyone wants some more backstory/detail/further posts please let me know!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367828760", "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(First, ignore the top and bottom of the grid because those notes are really uncommon.)\n\nDraw triangles.\n\nLook at the picture with the purple ribbon. The dots are individual notes like on a piano, although some dots refer to the same pitches (C# = Db for example, but when it comes to theory it's important to make the distinction).\n\nEvery dot that falls in the purple ribbon is part of a **C major scale** - you'll notice that it's just the notes C D E F G A B. These are simply the white keys on a piano. When a musician writes a song using these notes and emphasizes that C is the \"main\" note or **tonic** (the one that the other notes resolve to), we say the song is written in the \"key of C major\" (or simply \"key of C\"). When musicians write a song with the same notes but emphasizing A as the tonic, we say the song is written in the \"key of A minor\" (and you write the scale A B C D E F G instead). You can emphasize any note and reorder the scale and get all the different modes, but since these two are the most common, we'll just leave it at that to keep things simple.\n\nYou can slide the ribbon to the left or right to change the key. If you slide it one note right, you include F# and exclude F, and it becomes the key of G major/E minor (The G's should be bold instead of the C's in this case).*\n\nNotes and scales are great and all, but music theory gets really interesting when we create **chords**, or groups of notes played simultaneously.\n\nThe diagrams below the grid of black dots show how to derive chords from the grid of notes. Again, ignore most of it and just focus on the first green and the first blue triangles, which are labeled \"major\" and \"minor\". They both have one note that has an orange ring: the triangles show how to construct a chord from it. Since these chords have three notes in them, we call them **triads**. (Just a quick note: the concepts of \"major chord\" / \"minor chord\" and \"major scale\" / \"minor scale\" are related but distinct.)\n\nFor example, pick a note in the purple ribbon, say **F**. Draw an upward-pointing triangle from it just like the green one, and you'll get **A** and **C** as well. These three notes, when played together, define the chord **F major** (which is often abbreviated \"F\" in the context of chords). This triangle lies completely in the ribbon, so it's commonly used in music written in the key of C major.\n\nNow draw a downward-pointing triangle from F. This chord is **F minor** (abbreviated \"Fm\"). It's the same thing except the A becomes **Ab** (\"A-flat\"). However, Ab falls outside the purple ribbon (which makes sense, as Ab refers to the *black* key to the immediate left of A). This means that this chord is used more sparingly in a song written in the key of C major.\n\nYou can see why I wrote Dm F Am C Em G Bo in the purple ribbon now. These are the chords that \"fit\" in the key of C. Indeed, a lot of music will only stay in the ribbon. There are \"four-chord\" songs which go C G Am F or Am C G Dm or the equivalent in a different key (in key of G, for example, these progressions would be G D Em C, or Em G D Am); a pattern called a **chord progression**.\n\nBy experimenting with keys and all kinds of chords and progressions, a musician can be really expressive when it comes to harmony. The graphic aims to visually simplify some of the concepts of music theory that musicians use all the time in their compositions. [Here's an example of a song that demonstrates how the table relates to actual music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48RrXWDYLYU).\n\n\\* *If you read sheet music, you might see the connection between moving the ribbon and key signatures. Sheet music indicates the key signature by writing a number of sharps and flats at the beginning of each staff - one sharp = key of G, two sharps = key of D, one flat = key of F, two flats = key of Bb, and so on. Using a note outside of the scale requires it to be explicitly written (an accidental).*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367893291", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

This ensures that there can be no triple consonant clusters.\n\nThere is a lot of work that I have yet to do with the phonotactics. There are some pretty significant restrictions on onset consonant clusters, but I haven't fleshed out all of the details on that yet. So far I've only been able to list permissible word-initial clusters. They are (for the time being):\n\n&lt;brr br bl by prr pr pl py my vrr vr vl vy frr fr fl fy drr dr trr tr ny zrr zr zy srr sr sy jjrr jjr jjy shrr shr shy jrr jr jy chrr chr chy grr gr gl gy krr kr kl ky ry hy&gt;\n\nThere are a few additional clusters which are exceptions to the general pattern, such as &lt;sv jjd shv&gt;, and a few others. These clusters appear in ancient forms of Salhari words and certain loanwords, but otherwise cannot occur at a syllable onset.\n\n3. I chose these sounds primarily for aesthetic purposes, but also for ease of pronunciation. (I don't see the point in creating a language that I can't even pronounce.) Some may criticize this phoneme inventory as too IE or not \"exotic\" enough; and if that's your opinion, you're welcome to it. But my purpose in choosing these sounds was not to make use of weird phonemes, it was to create something that is phonoaesthetically pleasing to me.\n\n4. Consonants can be geminate (except for /j h rr/) and palatalized, but never both. One of the limitations to palatalization is that the vowels and diphthongs /i i: ɪ ɛ ɛɪ/ can never occur after a palatalized consonant. In terms of sociolinguistics, I do have some notes on things like dialectical variation, but very little of it will make sense until I tell you a bit more about the language. I'll have to cover that in a later post/challenge.\n\n5. Here are some basic pronouns (excluding reverent forms), all undeclined in the absolutive case:\n\n1S - &lt;ja&gt;\n2S - &lt;za&gt;\n3SM - &lt;va&gt;\n3SF - &lt;ra&gt;\n1PI - &lt;jalal&gt;\n1PE - &lt;javara&gt;\n2P - &lt;zalal&gt;\n3P - &lt;halal&gt;\n\nIn addition to these basic pronouns, there is also a reciprocal pronoun &lt;la&gt;, \"each other.\"\n\nHere is some basic vocabulary:\n\naajera – \"island\"\njukave - \"to understand\" \nleratva - \"dream\" \nmetaa - \"woman; female\" \nchala - \"road; path\" \nhaili - \"lake; pond\" \nzora - \"river\" \nbolave - \"to know someone\" \nkituu - \"man; male\" \nnahali - \"language\"\nAnd a few expressions:\nmeraa - \"hey; hi; hello\" \nmeravala - \"hello; greetings; welcome\" \nnalayan honarië - \"nice to meet you\" (lit. let's be respectful) \nnalayanye - \"nice to meet you\" (shortened form of nalayan honarië)\n\n6. I do have a script. I'll upload some pics to imgur tomorrow and put them in this post.\n\n7. If I have time, I'll do some recordings too.\n\n**EDIT:** Please excuse my formatting.

{"body": "Lifting things seems like it takes a lot of energy to us because we are not really built to do it efficiently. That's why a fair bit of being good at weight lifting is learning form so you can do it with as little energy per pound as possible and therefore lift as much as possible. \n\nFor example, I used to do something called AcroYoga which is basically like a combination of partner gymnastics and yoga. Tons of fun. I weigh over 200 pounds and girls half my weight who had never done any strength training in their lives could easily lift me if they did it right. Likewise my un-strong ass could lift others near my weight. \n\nYou can calculate the energy required to lift something, and therefore how much potential energy you can get the other direction, by the simple formula m x g x h. m is your mass in kilograms, g is gravity 9.8 m/s and h is the height in kilograms. \n\nSo 500 pounds is about 225 kg and and 15 feet is about 4.5 meters. Plugging that into the formula gets just under 10,000 joules. A Watt is one joule per second so a 100 Watt lightbulb using 100 joules every second. That would give you about 2 minutes of light. \n\nHere is a real world example \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/dec/14/gravity-light-sand-powered-lamp\nFYI: That is an LED bulb which is substantially more efficient than an incandescent bulb. \n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how much energy you expend walking up a few flights of stairs. That's about the same as the energy required to lift the weight in your example. \n  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367936864", "subreddit": "AskScienceDiscussion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I would like to get your thoughts on some ERV arguments another time though, but not today.\n\n&gt; The odds against which are astronomical.\n\nI think we've discussed some of these before:\n\n1.  According to [SINEs of the perfect character](http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/9979.full), PNAS, 1999, \"Even simple insertions and deletions within coding regions have been considered to be unlikely to be homoplastic, but numerous examples of convergence and parallelism of these events are now known.\"\n2.  The third row in figure 7 from [Purification and Properties of Wild-type and Exonuclease-deficient DNA Polymerase II from Escherichia coli](http://www.jbc.org/content/270/25/15327.long#F7) JBC, 1995, shows 4 lines of e coli independantly mutating the same 182bp deletion 4 times.  Another 317bp deletion was observed to evolve independently twice.\n3.  [Another in e coli](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/1/113.full.pdf), \"Nine independent deletions were observed, but seven of them had breakpoints identical to the previously characterized H1 deletion [see Figure 2A]\".  They conclude, \"This study provides a compelling reason to avoid the assumption that parallel evolution of deletions is rare until the mechanisms underlying insertions and deletions are better understood.\"\n4.  In [this study](http://www.nature.com/oncsis/journal/v1/n2/full/oncsis20121a.html), they saw \"a seven nucleotide duplication, affecting codons 108–110 resulting in a frame shift and premature stop codon at position 150.\" in two unrelated families, demonstrating \"that this mutation arose independently\".\n\nSo I don't think that identical indels arising independently is improbable, even among 7 lineages.  Here's the sequence data surrounding the vitamin C gene deletion, omitting nucleotides with no variation (from a [creationist journal](http://creation.com/images/pdfs/tj/j24_2/j24_2_122-127.pdf), say what you may but I don't think they would fabricate data):\n\n    Human      A C T G G G G A C A C T G * G A G G T C T A T G C C C C G T G G A\n    Chimp      A C T G G G C A C A C T G * G A G G T C T A T G C C C C G C G G A\n    Orangutan  A C C G G G G G C A C C A * G A G G T C T A T G C C C C G C G G A\n    Macaque    A A C G G G G G C A C C A * A G G G T C T A T G C C C C G C G G A\n    Guinea Pig A C C T G G G G C A C C G G G G G G C C T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Mouse      A C C C G A G G C A C C G A G G T G T C T G T G C G C C G A G G A\n    Rat        A C C C A A G G C A C C G A G G C G T T T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Dog        T C C T G A G C C A C C G C G G G G T C T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Cow        A C C C G A G A C A T C G C G G G G C C T G T G C C C C G A C G A\n    Pig        A C C C G A G G C A T C G G G C G G C C T G T G C C C C G A G G A\n    Chicken    A C C T G A G G T G T C G A G C G G T C G G T G C C C C G C G G A\n\nThere's a lot of variability at that position among species without the deletion.  Could this be evidence of a mutational hotspot?\n\n&gt; predicted a different break in fruit bats and guniea pigs\n\nI would think that similar genomes are likely to break in similar ways.\n\n**Edit:** I just found [a debate](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/02/human-gulop-pseugogene.html) between Peter Borger (author of the creation journal paper above) and Larry Moran.

{"body": "Let's start with basic chord theory. The most common chords we use in western music are **triads**, which are made by \"leap frogging\" notes in a music scale. For example, the **C major scale** contains the notes\n\nC D E F G A B\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nSo if we want to make chords out of that, we get:\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A B\n\n**1** 2 **3** 4 **5** 6 7 (1 3 5 chord \"formula\")\n\nthe notes of a C **major chord**. It's a major chord because it consists of a **root** note, a **major third** (two whole steps above the root), and a **perfect fifth** (three and a half steps above the root). The relationship between the root and the third largely defines the sound of a chord. Major chords (with two steps between the root and third) tend to sound happy, while **minor chords** (with a **minor third**, one and a half steps between the root and third instead of two steps) tend to sound sad.\n\nThere are two types of suspended chords, the **sus2** and **sus4**. These involve replacing the third interval (the E note of a C major chord, since it's the third note in the scale) with either the second or fourth.\n\n**C** **D** E F **G** A B  Csus2\n\n**1** **2** 3 4 **5** 6 7 (1 2 5)\n\n**C** D E **F** **G** A B  Csus4\n\n**1** 2 3 **4** **5** 6 7 (1 4 5)\n\nThese are mostly used to build tension in a tune by dancing around the third.\n\nA **seventh chord** is the most basic **extension**, chords that go beyond three notes. It is simply adding the seventh note of the scale, like so:\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A **B**\n\n**1** 2 **3** 4 **5** 6 **7** (1 3 5 7)\n\nThis a C major 7 chord. There are several kinds of seventh chords, such as **minor seventh** (1 b3 5 b7), notated as Xmin7, and **dominant seventh** (1 3 5 b7), notated as X7.\n\nI hope I haven't confused you too much.

The notes in parenthesis are the notes that are being played.\n\nE\n\nB- 5 (E)\n\nG- 5 (C)\n\nD- 5 (G)\n\nA- 3 (C)\n\nE\n\nThe scale for a C chord is played with these notes, in this order:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nA basic chord is made up of the 1st, 3rd and 5th note in the scale. In this case, it would be C, E and G. The only difference between a 7th chord and a basic chord is that a 7th chord adds in the 7th note in the scale, which in this case is B.\n\nA major 7th chord, written like Cmaj7 is the simply adding the 7th note of the major scale in, which is B. The note comes out as C E G B. \n\nThe same is done for minor chords. Cmin7 is no different except it utilizes the C minor scale instead of the C major scale.\n\nWhenever you read C7, it's talking about a dominant 7th chord, which is the flat (or half step lower) of the 7th note. C E G B becomes C E G Bb. This is just assumed when it is written as C7. Not otherwise specified means it's dominant.\n\nI hope this helps with 7th chords. daddytwofoot gave a much better explanation on sus chords than I could. Let me know if you have any questions.

For example, this next parser matches a group of elements bracketed by 'a' tags:\n\n    -- Like 'many', except returns results in reverse\n    -- This is useful for incremental parsing\n    few :: (Alternative f) =&gt; f a -&gt; f [a]\n    few fa = pure [] &lt;|&gt; ((:) &lt;$&gt; fa &lt;*&gt; few fa)\n\n    parseSomething :: (Monad m, Proxy p) =&gt; ParseT p Text m [Text]\n    parseSomething = many $ do\n        match \"&lt;a&gt;\"\n        x &lt;- takeWhile (\\c -&gt; not (c == '&lt;'))\n        match \"&lt;/a&gt;\"\n        return x\n\nAll we're missing is a sample incremental text source (I'd ordinarily use an incremental file reader, but I still haven't released a `Text` library for `pipes` yet):\n\n    -- Pretends to be an impure source of Text values\n    textSource :: (Proxy p) =&gt; () -&gt; Producer p (Maybe Text) IO ()\n    textSource = fromListS\n        [ Just \"&lt;a&gt;\"\n        , Just \"Element1&lt;/a\"\n        , Just \"&gt;&lt;a&gt;Element2\"\n        , Just \"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;\"\n        , Just \"Element3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;Element4&lt;/a&gt;\"\n        , Nothing\n        ]\n\nNow I can run it and it will return all possible matches to my parsing specification.  I will connect the text source to the parser and then print out every solution:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; runProxy $ textSource &gt;-&gt; runParseT parseSomething &gt;-&gt; printD\n    []\n    [\"Element1\"]\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\"]\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\",\"Element3\"]\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\",\"Element3\",\"Element4\"]\n    \nI can even verify that the parsing is incremental just by attaching an intermediate debugging stage that prints out the chunks as they are being fed into the parser:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; -- Note the extra 'printD' stage in between the source and parser\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; runProxy $ textSource &gt;-&gt; printD &gt;-&gt; runParseT parseSomething &gt;-&gt; printD\n    []\n    Just \"&lt;a&gt;\"\n    Just \"Element1&lt;/a\"\n    Just \"&gt;&lt;a&gt;Element2\"\n    [\"Element1\"]\n    Just \"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;\"\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\"]\n    Just \"Element3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;Element4&lt;/a&gt;\"\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\",\"Element3\"]\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\",\"Element3\",\"Element4\"]\n    Nothing\n\nIt immediately produces new solutions as new data becomes available.\n\nThis is a truly backtracking parser, and we can prove this by complicating our parser a bit:\n\n    parseSomething :: (Monad m, Proxy p) =&gt; ParseT p Text m [Text]\n    parseSomething = do\n        xs &lt;- few element\n        x  &lt;- element\n        let n = read $ drop 7 $ T.unpack x\n        if (even n) then return (xs ++ [x]) else empty\n      where\n        element = do\n            match \"&lt;a&gt;\"\n            x &lt;- takeWhile (\\c -&gt; not (c == '&lt;'))\n            match \"&lt;/a&gt;\"\n            return x\n\nThis time our parser insists that the last element has an even number.  Let's try it:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; runProxy $ textSource &gt;-&gt; printD &gt;-&gt; runParseT parseSomething &gt;-&gt; printD\n    Just \"&lt;a&gt;\"\n    Just \"Element1&lt;/a\"\n    Just \"&gt;&lt;a&gt;Element2\"\n    Just \"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;\"\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\"]\n    Just \"Element3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;Element4&lt;/a&gt;\"\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\",\"Element3\",\"Element4\"]\n\nSo the parser is smart.  When it hits `Element2`, it returns that as a possible solution, but it also backtracks and tries the alternative path where `Element2` is not the last element and then discovers a second solution ending in `Element4`.\n\nAlso, even though I've been testing a pure input masquerading as impure input, I can use a real impure input just as easily:\n\n    userInput :: (Proxy p) =&gt; () -&gt; Producer p (Maybe Text) IO ()\n    userInput () = runIdentityP $ do\n        (stdinS &gt;-&gt; takeWhileD (/= \"quit\") &gt;-&gt; mapD (Just . T.pack)) ()\n        respond Nothing\n\nLet's try it:\n\n    runProxy $ userInput &gt;-&gt; runParseT parseSomething &gt;-&gt; printD\n    &lt;a&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    Element1&lt;/a&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    &gt;&lt;a&gt;Element2&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\"]\n    Element3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;Element4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    [\"Element1\",\"Element2\",\"Element3\",\"Element4\"]\n    quit&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nThis time I'm entering the input manually from the command line and the parser is continually outputting new solutions as I supply new data.\n\nAlso, note that the parser is smart.  If it detects that no further solutions are possible, it will simply stop requesting new input from me:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; runProxy $ userInput &gt;-&gt; runParseT parseSomething &gt;-&gt; printD\n    &lt;a&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    Element1&lt;/a&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    &gt; &lt;a&gt;Element2&lt;ENTER&gt;\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nI accidentally added a space between the two elements, and the parser short-circuited because there were no further solutions possible, so it stopped requesting input.  I didn't even program that behavior in.  This behavior just emerged naturally as a consequence of following the elegant theory. \n\nSo functional programming is definitely up to the task of incremental parsing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368080054", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Leaving aside the syntax, those small bits may not be complex on their own, but their complexity ramps up rather quickly once you compose them together, for things like fold or using pattern matching to reduce trees, etc. I think that imperative code, even if using recursion, is much easier to understand.\n\nPersonally, I find folds easier to understand.  Imperative code makes it easy to miss the forest (i.e. the actual idea behind the code) for the trees, particularly if you're trying to do something complex.  Haskell is succinct, which is a blessing and a curse:  You can spend 20 minutes staring at a short bit of code, but you might have spent much longer staring at the equivalent thousand lines of Java.\n\nFor example, inserting into a set implemented as a Red/Black tree:\n\n     data Color = R | B\n     data Tree a = E | T Color (Tree a) a (Tree a)\n\n     insert x t = makeBlack (ins s)\n       where ins E = T R E x E  -- inserting into an empty tree\n             ins (T color a y b) | x &lt;  y = balance color (ins a) y b\n                                 | x == y = T color a y b\n                                 | x &gt;  y = balance color a y (ins b)       \n\n     balance B (T R (T R a x b) y c) z d = T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)\n     balance B (T R a x (T R b y c)) z d = T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)\n     balance B a x (T R (T R b y c) z d) = T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)\n     balance B a x (T R b y (T R c z d)) = T R (T B a x b) y (T B c z d)\n     balance color a x b = T color a x b\n\nThat code is dense, and might take sketching the pattern matching of the trees on paper to grok.  But I challenge you to create something that takes less total time to understand.\n\n&gt; But even in Haskell you aren't entirely free of these concerns. Eventually you'll have to learn about things like ByteString and Vector and worry about evaluation order when writing non-trivial programs. But unlike in other languages, these details are kind of hard to figure out and use in Haskell, because they seem to lie outside of what is considered to be idiomatic.\n\nActually, people use Text rather than ByteString, because Text is unicode whereas ByteString is, well, just arrays of bits.  I'm not entirely sure what complexity you're talking about;  Text and Vector are just different libraries that handle assorted things more efficiently than String or List.\n\nAnd sure, you want to sometimes use strictness to control evaluation order, but it's hardly black magic.

{"body": "I write this with adrenaline still pumping through my veins. Fifteen minutes ago, a week long plan to kill this Titan finally came to fruition. Though there were many points in which I could have just said “fuck it” and left, oh boy, am I glad I didn’t. This is a rare thing: the full story of the death of a Titan, from concept to execution.\n \n \nAN OLD CONTACT EMERGES\n \nThis story starts like many others - a phone call, an email, or in my case a conversation invite from my good friend Snowman1. I’ve known snowman for around 5 years now, ever since we were both in the corporation Merchants Trade Consortium. He told me he was bored with Minmatar Faction Warfare and wanted to come play in 0.0. As a farewell gift, he also wanted to kill his CEO’s Titan. He needed my help.\n \nSo what did I have at hand?\n \nFirst, Snowman told me he had recently been given POS fueling rights. This would also allow him to turn off POS shields and make the Titan within completely vulnerable. That's almost everything we need: it means we can catch the Titan, leaving it pointed and ready to be hammered by any force I decide to bring along. I started looking around for a suitable entity with enough firepower to turn a Leviathan into powder. Luckily for me, my own alliance, TEST, was at this point staging in HED. HED is only two Titan midpoints from Arzad, meaning that I could invite my own alliance along to kill this behemoth. Perfect.\n \nSo, on Friday the 3rd, I get both midpoints manned with cynos, get a Phobos into Arzad, and get snowman ready to drop the shields. Perfect. Only one thing left: how do we get Eperor to log on?\n \nI learned a few things about Eperor. Apparently he liked doing two things with his Titan: logging it on when the Amarrian FW fleet up (to show them he means business) and leaving it logged in while AFK. There was a third avenue for victory: Snowman had been talking with his CEO about “selling” his Leviathan to a buyer and scamming him for the money. If necessary, we could use this angle to get the Titan online; however, we would save it for emergencies only.\n \nWith all these things in place, the worst thing happened.\n \n(10:00:26 PM) pleaseignore.com:\n \nHey guys\n \nJust an update.\n \nAs previously planned between myself and Shadoo, as of midnight eve tonight PL will be reset by the HBC. These guys are still our friends but this is best for both parties.\n \nPlease do not be dumb in low sec with caps pl will kill you.\n \nI love you Shadoo.\n \n#### SENT BY Sort Dragon to All online hbc @ 2013-05-03 21:00:30 EVE Time ####\n \nWelp.\n \nMy two days of planning had been for naught if I couldn’t get this Titan kill in the next few hours. With one hour to go before the reset, I frantically messaged ranger64511, a TEST capital FC, trying to get him to form up anything to kill this Titan. Once again, it slipped through my fingers. Snowman sent me this:\n \n[ 2013.05.03 22:49:36 ] snowman1 &gt; [22:49:12] Torenc &gt; i go to sleep\n \nThe Titan had gone to bed. Plan aborted.\n \nI talked to ranger and he informed me he would look into doing it over the next week if I could give him as much information as possible. I went to bed.\n \nTHE NEXT DAY\n \nSo: I logged back into Targie after work around 22:00 EVE time, and the biggest blow to my plan had just been announced.\n \nDuring TEST’s SotA, BoodaBooda had removed TEST from the HBC, effectively ending any chance of having TEST join in the slaughter of my innocent Titan. It seemed that the plan was going to have to be abandoned again. Thoroughly disappointed, I went to bed once more.\n \nAwaking the next day, I had no work - nothing but bitter dreams of what might have been. Examining GARPA, though, I noticed that Arzad was very close to Amamake. In Amamake, I had friends.\n \nAmamake is home to MirrorGod and the Heretic Nation alliance. I’ve known MG from when I was in B A N E a few years ago, and I knew he would be up for killing a Titan in his back garden. I sent him a message. After hearing my plan, MG was on board 100%, and with uplifted spirits, I messaged Snowman to tell him the plan was back on and to expect a dead Titan soon.\n \nThe plan had been modified slightly, with the final result being as follows:\n \nI would warp to a safespot 1000km from the tower just after downtime and cloak up. The Titan pilot was known to come online between 19:00 and 22:00 EVE time, so around then we would form a fleet and kill the behemoth, if opportunity permitted. For three days, I sat in a safe in the middle of Arzad, waiting for the opportunity to strike.\n \nOn Monday, he didn’t log in.\n \nOn Tuesday, Heretics were not ready to form up, and the Titan pilot went to bed. I also talked to MG about who he was planning to bring to be the hammer. I had heard the day before that PL had recently moved to Amamake and I was worried they might drop anything he brought to kill the Titan. However, after learning that it was in fact PL he had been in contact with to be the hammer, I was content.\n \nThen Wednesday came around. It began like the other days: I logged in after downtime, warped Targie to the safespot and cloaked.\n \nAround 18:30, MG messages me, telling me that Heretics were ready to go; all we needed was the Titan to log in. Our first thought was to try and contact the Amarrians to form a fleet to attract his attention. However, it being mid-week, this would be a hard task. We attempted other methods to get him to log in, but none of them proved fruitful. At this moment, snowman mentioned that he still had the Titan scam going, and if MG could provide an alt, he could get the Titan to log in.\n \nTHE MOMENT OF TRUTH\n \nSitting in the safe spot, we hashed out the details. Snowman would convo Eperor, telling him he had a buyer who wanted to view the Titan. Chat logs would substantiate the idea that viewing the Titan would help the buyer \"feel comfortable.\" While waiting for Eperor to reply, we worked out our tactics.\n \nMG’s main worry was about the Titan e-jumping out. To counter this, Snowman would fleet the Titan the instant he logged in. Why this would work was beyond me, but snowman was confident it would. We also agreed that snowman would not offline the tower until I was on grid, to minimise the time the Titan felt insecure.\n \nSo: while I wait, Heretic and PL form up.  You can tell PL don’t believe that this will happen, with even the great Makalu piping up in fleet:\n \n[ 2013.05.08 20:36:57 ] Makalu Zarya &gt; this fleet is blueballs i think\n \nBut I want to prove him wrong. So I wait, while snowman works.\n \nThen, Snowman posts the most beautiful words I’ve ever heard:\n \n[ 2013.05.08 20:39:26 ] snowman1 &gt; [20:39:20] Aphrodita Engelbreht &gt; ok i log in\n \nWaiting pensively, I see the Titan pilot log in, and warp as fast as possible to the tower. Landing on grid, I am met by the shields, as expected. However, as the seconds tick past, they never go down. As the Titan lands on grid, I warp off. The shields never went down and  I’ve blown it. He’s seen a hostile Phobos sitting next to his tower, so he must know it’s a scam. We’re done.\n \nAs I warp from the tower, Snowman posts this:\n \n[ 2013.05.08 20:41:17 ] snowman1 &gt; 20:40:42    Notify    You cannot perform that action on that object as you do not have the required role in your corporation, Config Starbase Equipment.\n \nHe was never able to offline the shields. He had only been given refuelling roles, not config roles, which meant that the whole idea of killing this Titan was sunk from the very beginning. I was heartbroken. A week of waiting had been for naught. Everything ruined.\n \nSuddenly, Snowman pipes up in mumble.\n \nSnowman1 &gt; He’s in warp to planet 6\n \nWhat the hell?\n \nIf you remember earlier, part of our plan was for snowman to fleet invite him to stop him from e-jumping to any alts. It seems that he had accepted the fleet invite, and then gone AFK, leaving snowman as his squad commander. Snowman had just warped him to planet 6.\n \nHe was toast.\n \nThe rest can be seen in the video at the start of this article, but sitting here, I still don’t know how we got him. The amount of times it seemed that fate was working again us made me want to quit. Screw you, fate, I’ve got a killmail.\n \nThis titan was also a personal victory for MG, showing that choosing your friends has consequences:\n \nWe [Heretics] have for a long time remembered who our friends are, and also who our friends aren't.  When I reclaimed Heretic Nation, and when asked to choose a side, Iron Oxide set a blue standing to my alliance's impostors, which is currently under PL's boot in Amamake (and doing a good job of staying docked while smacking them).  We don't hold grudges, we just get even.  Don't get me wrong, I'd have killed this Titan either way; the fact that they were foolish enough to side with my \"Franchise\" is just icing on the cake.\n \nI would like to thank Snowman1, MirrorGod, The whole of Heretic Nation and Pandemic Legion, for being complete bosses and helping with this.

{"body": "I'd like to second the recommendations of Mark Levine's Jazz Theory book.  It explains all of this very well.  \n\nAs for which modes work over which chords, here's a good way to figure it out:  Think about the tonality of the chord built using the notes of the mode.  In other words, build a chord by using every other note of the scale.  Then, compare that chord to whatever chord you'd like to play over.  \n\nExample:  The E Phrygian mode.  The notes are E F G A B C D.  If you build a chord in thirds, you get the notes E G B D F A C.  That is pretty close to a regular E min7 chord, which is E G B D F# A C#, so you could play E Phrygian over an E min7 chord.  \n\nIt's important to know what notes are important to a chord.  Generally speaking, the root, third, seventh, and fifth are the most important notes in a chord.  Given that bit of knowledge, we can look at the notes in the E Phrygian mode and see that the root, third, and fifth are the same, so playing the E Phrygian mode will sound mostly consonant (or \"in\" as some would say) when played over an E min7 chord.\n\nHope that all makes sense.

{"body": "And another little tidbit:  Often jazz players will refer to chords using mode names, since jazz chords often involve extensions (notes other than root, third, fifth, and seventh).  So, someone may say that they're playing \"a Lydian chord.\"  Again, if you just look at the notes in the chord, it will make much more sense.  Here are the notes in a \"Lydian chord\" (in C)\n\nC E G B D F# A\n\nThat only differs in one note from a \"regular\" (AKA Ionian) maj7 chord, which is:\n\nC E G B D F A\n\nMoreover, the note that differs is the 11th (AKA the 4th), which is not a very important interval.  My whole point in explaining this is to communicate that when someone says they're playing a Lydian chord, the chord they're playing is fundamentally just a maj7 chord.  What most jazz players call a min7 chord is actually a Dorian chord, jazzers typically play minor scales with the raised sixth.

{"body": "IMO, don't buy a workstation keyboard. IMO (again) they aren't for completing tunes. You could buy a computer and some decent software for what you would pay for a modern workstation keyboard. \n\nRead this, it's a fantastic primer on Synthesis: \n\nhttp://documentation.apple.com/en/logicstudio/instruments/#chapter=A%26section=0\n\nMy basic rundown: \n\nNOTE: PLEASE do not give me shit for leaving details out, this is for someone who needs to understand the basics. \n\nMost synths have three main components: Oscillators, Filters, and Amplifiers. \n\nSounds, generally, have 3 different aspects: Pitch, Tone, And Volume. \n\nIn synthesis, Oscillators are responsible for PITCH, Filters for ADJUSTING TONE, and Amplifiers for determining VOLUME OVER TIME. \n\nYour synth begins with Oscillators. They oscillate, or cycle at a given speed. The faster they oscillate, the higher the pitch that is generated. When you play a key, or send a midi note, to your synthesizer, it oscillates the oscillators at whatever speed is required to create the pitch of that key. \n\nIf you play middle A, for example, you would get a pitch of 440hz, because the oscillators would be cycling 440 times a second. \n\nThese cycling objects can also have a shape, this is referred to as it's \"waveform\". Common waveforms are sine waves (circular), triangle waves (shaped like a triangle), Sawtooth waves (you guessed it), etc. Each shape has a slightly different sound, and you will learn their characteristics over time. \n\nDifferent waveform/shape = different levels of harmonics, and thereby a different sound.\n\nSinewaves have no harmonics.\n\nNext section: Filters\n\nSimple concept, filters act as a sort of EQ for your synthesizer. They can FILTER out frequencies/harmonics being created by the oscillators to change their sound and tone. \n\nFilters have 2 main components: \n\nCutoff Frequency\nResonance/Q amount\n\nCutoff is simply a frequency at which the filter begins to FILTER out part of the sound generated by the oscillator. \n\nIf your cutoff frequency is 500hz, that means that the filter begins its work at that frequency. \n\nWhat KIND of work, you ask? Simply attenuating volume. That's it. \n\nThere are three main types of filters, Low Pass (LP), High-Pass (HP) or Band-Pass (BP)\n\nA LP filter filters out frequencies ABOVE it's cutoff frequency, letting the LOW frequencies PASS. \n\nFor example, if we are using our 500hz cutoff from before, when applied to a Low Pass filter, all frequencies ABOVE 500hz will be attenuated somehow. This makes the sound duller. \n\nBy contrast, if you had everything the same, but made the filter HP, every frequency BELOW 500hz would be attenuated, meaning that the HIGH frequencies were allowed to PASS. The sound (Generally) would be much brighter than the LP filter at the same frequency. \n\nBand-Pass filters attenuate frequencies AROUND a given point. So to go back to our 500hz example, if you enabled a BP filter, frequencies would be attenuated both above and below 500hz, resulting in a BAND of frequencies being allowed to PASS. BP filters can have all kinds of tones, both dark and bright. \n\nResonance is simple. The higher the resonance value, the more the frequency OF the CUTOFF is ACCENTUATED. \n \nLots of Q/Res, Lots of 500hz (in our example). \n\nIf you know how to use an EQ, and you have seen what the \"Q\" Value does on a parametric, you already know what resonance does. More Resonance, More spike at the cutoff frequency. \n\nthere are more aspects of filters to discuss, such as SLOPE, AKA dB/Octave. \n\nThe higher the number of dB/Octave, the steeper the filter, meaning it attenuates frequencies more quickly. \n\nHigher Slope value = more extreme and audible filter\nLower Slope value = more transparent, subtle filtering. \n\nUsual ranges go from 48 dB/Oct - 6dB/Oct\n\nFinally, Amplifiers. \n\nAmplifiers determine the VOLUME over TIME of the synth sound you are creating. \n\nGenerally, when you adjust the master volume knob, you are affecting the Amplifier. \n\nNow, wouldn't it be cool if you could have someone control the volume knob FOR you, and exactly in the way you desire? \n\nThat is what an ADSR envelope does. It's like an invisible hand that can control the level of something over time. \n\nHere, we are discussing the most common type of ADSR envelope: the one that controls the master volume of your synth. \n\nAttack \nDecay \nSustain \nRelease\n\nIf you look at any synth, there will almost always me an A D S R section that focuses on the volume. It would be marked with AMP below 4 knobs or faders. \n\nSo, \n\nThese 4 parameters are defined as follows: \n\nAttack - An Amount of time\nDecay - An Amount of time\nSustain - A VALUE (not an amount of time) \nRelease - An Amount of time \n\nAttack adjusts how long it takes for the synth to get to max volume after the key is initially pressed. \nIf the attack time for the AMP ADSR is 1 second, that means that after you press the key, the volume will take exactly one second to ramp up to max from silent. \n\nLong attack, slow ramp in volume after key press\nShort attack, fast ramp in volume after key press\n\nDecay is what happens IMMEDIATELY after the Attack stage is over.\nSince the attack stage ramps up to full volume, that means that the Decay stage STARTS where the attack left off. \nIts purpose is to do the opposite thing, it causes the volume to DECAY/ATTENUATE over an amount of time. \n\nIf you had an Attack time of 1 second, and a decay time of one second, and all other stages set to 0ms, you would get a sound that ramps up to full volume for 1 second, then decays down to silent after another second. \n\nSo far so good? If you want to make a sound that ramps up, then down to silent again, set A and D to whatever you choose, then set the other two to ZERO. \n\nSustain is NOT an amount of time, so how do we determine how it behaves? Sustain is what occurs AFTER the DECAY stage has completed. In our example, this would be after 2 seconds, after both the attack and decay stages have expired, but this varies based upon your settings. \n\nSustain is a value from 0-100 percent. \n\nSo, press key, 1 second of ramping up in volume (A), continue to hold key, (D) stage begins, which attenuates the volume until the decay stage is over. After the decay stage is over, the volume rests at the SUSTAIN VALUE. \nIf that value is 0, that means the sound is silent, if the value is 50, that means the volume will DECAY down to HALF VOLUME and stay there for the duration of time the KEY IS HELD DOWN or THE MIDI NOTE CONTINUES TO SEND. \n\nFinally, Release. Simply, release is the amount of time that it takes for the envelope to go from WHATEVER VALUE IT IS CURRENTLY AT, to nothing, once the MIDI Note ends or the key is released. \n\nI'm tired of typing. If you want more stuff like this, vote it up. Otherwise I will fade away into obscurity (probably not)\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368258997", "subreddit": "synthesizers", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Great start! The problem, as it always seems to be, is in the details. Details are what make a good concept into a great finished piece. Here are a few things that will make it look a lot better.\n\n* Drop the body copy to 8-10pt. It may look tiny when you do it, but it's not. Pick up a magazine and check out the body copy, it's pretty small. It looks like you're rocking 12pt there. If I'm off, and you are at 9 or 10, drop it to 8 and see what it looks like. Leave the leading as it is so that it's a bit more open.\n\n* Orphans everywhere! An orphan can refer to the beginning line of a paragraph separated from the rest of the paragraph by a column break, or to a very short last line of a paragraph that breaks the flow of the column. An easy way to fix \"In 2008\" would be to throw a return before it and knock it to the right page, then adjust that paragraph so that it ends a line lower. You have one at \"In 2008...Viacom's\" and several at the end of the paragraphs on the right hand column (\"26 episodes,\" \"2004\"). A general rule of thumb for the last line of paragraph is to make sure it is at least half the width of the column, although the longer the better. You can fix this with a soft return (shift+return), which will drop words to the next line without the program considering it a new paragraph. Force the text to do what you want it to, make it your bitch. **All that being said, changing the type size will change all of your orphans, so do that first, then fix the orphans.**\n\n* Curved and pointed text boxes are a bitch, and you've done a pretty good job of dealing with them, but you still can see the awkward tracking in a few places (\"that the show,\" \"r e s i d e n t\"). Again, this will change if you change type size, but it's something to keep an eye out if the new type still looks like that. If you're ready for a challenge, it's time to start justifying the text manually. Adjust tracking word by word, and control line breaks with soft returns until you have beautiful, consistent columns with only minimal difference in tracking. It's hard, I'll tell you now. I ragged an entire hundred-page book and it took me a couple of months, and that wasn't even justified, it was left aligned. The results are worth it, though.\n\n* Reexamine the header. Usually, lead articles like this would have an intro spread with the title, author, and maybe a short blurb or paragraph, then the main spread of the article is just body copy. It's not impossible that the header is on the page with the body copy, but I would still look at it again. It just seems awkward as it is. Also, the \"one burning question\" is way too close.\n\n* Finally, consider finding a way to make the text on the left stand out more. Right now, it could be hard to read over the picture. Color fields usually look odd, but there's something there you can do. I believe in you.\n\nWhew! That was more detailed than I intended it to be. I haven't had a chance to flex my design muscles in a while, and it all came out at once. I hope I explained everything well, but feel free to ask questions.

{"body": "I'm not saying this is the best way to play her, but I seem to do okay:\n\n* Runes are typically Armor reds/GP10 yellows/CDR or mana regen blues/GP10 quints. Soraka already has innate MR due to her passive and I find her extremely long cooldowns require a faster investment in CDR. I max out my GP10 runes as well, since W gives armor and most of your CC utility is going to come from your items rather than your skills. Just note: CDR blues are hella expensive (820IP) so if you can only afford the cheaper mana regens, then that's fine too.\n* Skill order is E W W Q W R, then R &gt; W &gt; E &gt; Q. Remember to spam Q when you're engaging, after three consecutive hits you can actually start chunking someone for decent damage. If you have an AP jungler then the MR shred is even better.\n* Soraka's long cooldowns require extensive foresight and knowledge about how trades and engages will turn out. A good opponent will bait your W, wait the 3 seconds for your armor buff to decay, then re-engage while your W still has ~17 seconds of cooldown. Counter this by either forcing a full engage after you've used W or by playing defensively until W is back up.\n* Once you get your ultimate, be sure to keep an eye on the portraits of your allies on the left side of your screen, as well as the minimap. You don't always have to have your screen focused on them, sometimes you can save or help make a gank successful just by casting Wish at the right time.\n* Soraka's AA range is huge compared to most other supports. Abuse her banana slinging skills to poke.\n* While it's nice to keep your ADC's mana and health topped off, remember that every time you cast your spells, they go on CD for a long time. If your ADC has a reasonable level of both, save your skills and see if you can force an engage instead.\n* E is Soraka's only CC. You can use it to: deny an ADC's escape/engage mechanic, deny the opposing support's CC, or give your ADC mana. I find that it's best to use E as CC, unless your ADC just needs a little bit more mana for an escape or killing skill.\n* I tend to rush Shurelyas, Shard of True Ice or Twin Shadows on her (after Sightstone), since her passive and skills can compensate for what an Aegis or Locket provides until lategame.\n\nI think the hardest thing about Soraka is the knowledge that you don't have any hard CC - so all your counterplay revolves around positioning. She is a very passive laner and works best against a poke support. Hard engages early (like pre-level 9) destroy her, so be careful. Honestly, one of the most satisfying feelings for me is playing Leona and just annihilating a Soraka support and her ADC because they can't do much about the CC.\n\nSecond hardest thing is dealing with ADC's who think you exist solely to top off their health/mana. I have little constructive feedback here other than to just ignore them. If they're bothering you about it, then they've probably never played Soraka and wouldn't understand anyway.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368454851", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, it all started with a meeting.\n\nEXCRP was having our weekly/biweekly corp meeting, arguing over whether or not we should change the alliance name again, what nullsec powerbloc max wanted to blue up this week, and whether we should invade Delve and rent out our space in 0.0. Midway through discussing the pros and cons of having both the CFC and N3 blue, a voice rang out over comms - \"TLC just opened into us.\"\n\nMy first question was, \"Pvp?\" I repeated this a few times until the mighty lord of Darkness Himself, Max Leadfoot ascended from his dwelling place in the 7th circle of hell to declare that we would go forth and destroy those that would dare oppose our reign. We swiftly formed up a sizeable fleet of about 15-16, and prepared to ride forth and do battle.\n\nHowever, upon jumping our scout into their hole, we were greeted with not one, no, not TWO, not three....half a dozen? Noap. 10 motherfucking big-ass capitals parking their ass approx 30km off the hole - 4 moros, 5 archons, and 1 thanatos + assorted subcap support.\n\nUs, not wanting to be outdone, swiftly told our guardians to reship and assembled our mighty capital fleet of similar numbers (more dreads, less carriers) on our side of the WH. \n\nTLC then proceeded to smacktalk incessantly in local, starting with questioning our scout's sexual preference.....\n\nDr Who1 &gt; omg faggot alert in our wh boys its GUUUUUU GUNNER\n\nDelaida &gt; fuckin fags\n\nFelony &gt; are you all hard, fair fight..... pussies\n....which quickly devolved into \"ya momma\" jokes:\nTechnotrope &gt; She says: \"not too bright tho\".\nDr Who1 &gt; what his mom\nDr Who1 &gt; lol\n\nCold Cutty &gt; ya mom on a stick\n.....and then started talking about his wife:\nfirebladexsx &gt; I called your wife a whore.I'm sure she'll make me pay for it later.\n\nWith an obvious Mexican standoff, despite all the smack, Max declared that in order to help facilitate glorious honourable internet spaceship violence, we would offer to jump into their hole, or let them come into ours, with an agreed upon NO CAPITALS ALLOWED pact.\n\nTLC's response? Nope you guys gotta jump into all our perfectly setup blap dreads and RR carrier blob LOLOLOLOL.\n\n[img]http://www.shockmansion.com/wp-content/myimages/2013/02/912.gif[/img]\n\nRight....\n\nAfter this continuing mexican standoff, and them repeatedly threatening to roll the hole \"Dr Who1 &gt; jesus tell your boys to hurry else we are rolling\" we were about ready to call it due to their risk-averse faggotry. Suddenly - our resident GM, Max, typed a few commands on his mighty dev console (dontcha know, 3/4 of EXCRP are GMs and Senior Developers) and announced over comms that we were going for it - we just got backup.\n\nWhat had just occurred was, BoS had connected to TLC's hole. A bit of background - BoS are some scary good russians, unlike the want no fights bad russians - U N K N O W N.\n\nAfter some quick backslapping about the latest round of WH pew, a few shots of vodka, and something involving a goat (I only heard it over comms), we got ready to jump in and lay down some old-school justice on this risk-averse capital blobbing assholes.\n\nWe formed up on the hole, and began by just jumping our subcap fleet in. I was flying a guardian on Servant's Lord (my usual shiptype - Logi &gt; all, except for caps tbh). Upon decloaking, their blap dreads immediately lit up Max's Damnation. Despite their overwhelming dps, they had pulled 2 of their dreads off the hole, which meant that we were able to hold reps - barely - on Max's supertanked Damnation. \n\nOur russian brosef's landed at the edge of their caps, and immediately bubbled up, ensuring that none of the risk averse capitals would escape the coming judgement.\n\nWe were able to to hold reps on everything without issue, despite a fair bit of damping and neuting from their legions. Our only casualty was an unfortunate Ashimmu who got instablapped. :(\n\nWe continued applying dps to everything we could, but were unable to break anything. The same goes for TLC - we even had a guardian DC midway through.\n\nIt was about this time that shit got real.\n\nAfter clamoring for days about how awesome my Naglfar was, and how much I wanted to use it, we had agreed to have it on standby in the case of our dps not being able to break their tanks. I was to be the initial bait dread to pull aggro, and apply enough dps to force their dreads out of siege before the other Moros landed.\n\nGame on. I jumped through the hole, immediately sieged upon loading, and realized I was 30km off all their capitals, and didn't have any tracking computers or tracking enhancers fit to my dread due to needing ~dat tank~. Ah shit.\n\nI popped Strong Blue, heated errything, and went to work.\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/BsNmR8o.gif[/img]\n\nDespite them heavily neuting me, and putting ALL the dps onto my Naglfar - my ungodly tank of manliness withstood their withering assault. Despite being capped out, I was still able to force their dreads out of siege by the time my siege ended(and I hit armor) - meaning my no-resist mods armor tank held up against their combined fire with guardian support. Right about this time, our massive batphone came in...russians know russians know russians...and RA brought their ENTIRE CAPFLEET to our aid - 2 Moros! =D\n\nAs they began laying down fire, I received enough cap to resiege, quickly boosting my shields back to near full before being neuted out entirely again....but they didn't primary me. Capless guns ftw baby!\n\nDespite having no cap whatsoever, my Siege module and Guns work perfectly fine, as long as I wasn't shot at, I could continue to put out all of my dps.\n\nWith 2 moros and my Naglfar on field, it was only a matter of time before the remaining capitals fell, one by one. Their subcap fleet, sensing the end was near, fled the field in screaming droves, like rats fleeing a sinking ship. We exchanged GFs in local, and I think this quote from myself sums up my experience:\n\n﻿[ 2013.05.12 19:58:08 ] Lord's Servant &gt; GF\n﻿[ 2013.05.12 19:58:12 ] Lord's Servant &gt; one word - CAPLESS GUNS BABY\n﻿[ 2013.05.12 19:58:15 ] Lord's Servant &gt; NAGLFAR FTW\n﻿[ 2013.05.12 19:58:22 ] Lord's Servant &gt; nice job keeping me neuted most of the fight legions btw :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368456096", "subreddit": "Eve", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

This is also the first time i have realy thought about it (or put it into words) since.\n\nI was 8 years old, at my grandmothers farm in Idaho, visiting for Xmas. She used to have a bunch of animals, some cows, sheep, and a horse amongst other things. Nobody had told us of these things or their dangers before, so my brother, cousins, and I decided we would pull it down from the shelf and mess with it. I was going to play a prank on them and move it myself (because that's how i thought they worked) but when we started asking questions it started moving faster than i could react to push it, so i figured it was somebody else. Eventualy the answers started getting realy weird, for example my cousin asked if our grandpa was going to be ok, (he had cancer at the time) and we got back H E W I L L B U R N. At that point we put the thing away and stopped talking about it. \n\nIt just happened to be my turn to spend the night at the house, and we had more or less forgotten about the events of earlier, what with grandma's cookies and some other wonderful food, so when i went to bed i was completely content and ready to sleep. I woke up to what i can only equate to a growl, but it was rather unearthly. Not alot like a wolf or a dog. and when i looked up there was a large, shadowy figure standing at the foot of my bed. I freaked and started screaming and my grandpa burst into the room with his gun in hand, but nothing was there when he flipped the lights on.\n\nThe next morning when my parents got there they told my grandparents they should check on the animals, cause there was what looked like blood on one of the trees when they were driving in. 3 of the sheep and a cow had been completely disimboweled, and strewen about like some mad party. I never spent the night over there again after that. \n\n**TL;DR**  Family reunion when i was 8 ended with the slaughter of several animals.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368536182", "subreddit": "Thetruthishere", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think you're both missing the greatest advantage of currying, which is that it allows you to recursively generalize over all function types, peeling off one argument at a time.\n\nCurrying has two practical effects:\n\n1. Every function type is an instantiation of the type `a -&gt; b`.\n2. You can deal with a function type of the form `a -&gt; (... -&gt; z)`, with any number of arguments, by recursively descending down the right sides of the function arrows.\n\nOne of the most instructive cases is the `Applicative` type class in Haskell.  The purpose of `Applicative` in Haskell is to \"adapt\" plain functions of any number of arguments to work with complex types.  Suppose we have this function:\n\n    -- Syntax here is &lt;expression&gt; :: &lt;type&gt;\n    -- This declaration says that 'foo' is a function that takes three\n    -- arguments, of types a, b and c, and returns a result of d\n    foo :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d\n\n    -- Currying means that type is the same as:\n    --     a -&gt; (b -&gt; (c -&gt; d))\n\nThen we'd like to have a function `liftA3` such that:\n\n    -- 'f' stands in for some parametric type like list, tree, parser, etc.\n    liftA3 foo :: f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c -&gt; f c\n\nLikewise we want to have functions `liftA2`, `liftA4`, `liftA5`, etc., that do the same thing for functions that take the corresponding number of arguments.  Each of these functions would be easy to write individually, but is there some way we can write them all in one shot?\n\nCurrying solves this problem, because it allows us to factor all of these functions into two operations:\n\n    -- Inject a single value into type 'f'.  E.g., for lists, make a \n    -- one element list; for parsers, make a parser that consumes\n    -- no input and produces that value as its result.\n    pure :: a -&gt; f a\n\n    -- Combine two 'f's.  The first one is parametrized by a function\n    -- type, and the second by its argument type.\n    --\n    -- Syntactic note: this is defining an infix operator '&lt;*&gt;'. \n    (&lt;*&gt;) :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n\n    infixl &lt;*&gt;\n\n    liftA2 f a b = pure f &lt;*&gt; a &lt;*&gt; b\n    liftA3 f a b c = pure f &lt;*&gt; a &lt;*&gt; b &lt;*&gt; c\n    liftA4 f a b c d = pure f &lt;*&gt; a &lt;*&gt; b &lt;*&gt; c &lt;*&gt; d\n    liftA5 f a b c d e = ...\n\n    -- Or alternatively...\n    liftA f a = pure f &lt;*&gt; a\n    liftA2 f a b = liftA f a &lt;*&gt; b\n    liftA3 f a b c = liftA2 f a b&lt;*&gt; c\n    liftA4 f a b c d = liftA3 f a b c &lt;*&gt; d\n    liftA5 f a b c d e = ...\n\nIn practice, the library stops at `listA4`, and everybody uses `&lt;*&gt;`.\n\nAnother example:\n\n    instance Monoid m =&gt; Monoid (a -&gt; m) where\n        mempty = \\_ -&gt; mempty\n        mappend f g = \\a -&gt; mappend (f a) (g a)\n\nIf type `m` is a monoid, then functions that produce `m` are also so.  For example, `String` is a monoid with `mempty = \"\"` and `mappend = (++)` (appending two strings).  What this declaration does, in that case, is this:\n\n1. Given that you have defined what the empty string and string append are, it reuses those definitions to define corresponding operations over functions that produce lists.\n2. The \"empty function\" is the one that ignores its argument and produces the empty string.\n3. You concatenate two string functions by making a third function that takes an argument, calls the two string functions with that argument, and concatenates their results.\n\nNow here's the magical thing: because of currying, that definition above *works for functions of any number of arguments*.  Why?  Because if `m` is a `Monoid`, then `a -&gt; m` is also a `Monoid`; but this means that `b -&gt; (a -&gt; m)` is also a `Monoid`, as is `c -&gt; (b -&gt; (a -&gt; m))`, and any such other type.\n\nIf this sounds esoteric, this is in fact the technique behind the idiom used in Haskell for complex sort criteria (\"sort persons by `lastName`, then by `firstName`, then by `age`\").  The result of an order comparison is an enumeration type:\n\n    data Ordering = EQ | LT | GT\n\nThis type is a `Monoid`:\n\n    instance Monoid Ordering where\n        mempty = EQ\n\n        -- If the first comparison produces EQ, then the second one's\n        -- result wins:\n        mappend EQ y = y\n\n        -- Otherwise, the first comparison wins:\n        mappend x _ = x\n\nBecause of the `Monoid m =&gt; Monoid (a -&gt; m)` definition above, it follows automatically that `a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering` is a `Monoid`.  Thus, if I have functions `byFirstName, byLastName :: Person -&gt; Person -&gt; Ordering`, then `mappend byFirstName byLastName` and `mappend byLastName byFirstName` are the functions that compare two persons by the ordering the subcomparisons accordingly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368547564", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Alright I'll give you something that relates to what you wrote.  \n\nWhen learning modes and chords, this can help a lot; the realization that the scale and the chord are *the same thing*, looked from a different perspective.  \n\nTake a G mixolydian scale - it contatins the notes G A B C D E F, and a G7 chord, with the added tensions of 9, 11 and 13 contains the notes G B D F A C E - different order, but is the same thing. This can help A LOT when you start building your own chordal vocabulary or scale pattern exercises/licks. For example, you can make up a non-common chord from 3 random scale degrees, let's say 126 (GAE in G mixo) and harmonize it up the scale, you get: 126 (GAE), 237 (ABF), 341 (BCG), 452 (CDA), 563 (DEB), 674 (EFC), 715 (FGD). You've now harmonized your own chord up the scale, and now you can learn to play these voicings on all groups of adjacent 3 strings. Then, make inversions of these chords, then find voicings that skip some strings etc. You can see how much you can do with just one scale/chord.

{"body": "/r/learnmusic will give you the straight answer as opposed to what certain modern composers may have done with your question.  I suggest asking basic questions there and more in-depth topics can be discussed here.\n\nThe key signature turns all F's into F#'s by default so long as it's in effect.  Period.  If you want an F natural, put a natural sign in front of it, because by default, it's F#.  If the notes you see are D E F G A, then the actual notes are D E F# G A.  If you want F instead of F#, you have to write D E Fn G A.\n\nThe key signature is a *notational* tool to make your life easier; it doesn't do anything musically.  If you're already going to make most F's into F#'s, which you would do if you're writing in G major, you put that in the key signature and magically you don't have to worry about adding sharps to every F you come across.  However, you could easily decide to write in G major while the key signature is five flats (Db major) and you'll find that you'll just have to put accidentals on nearly everything.\n\nSome composers (me) will write a key signature and not actually mean to use the accidentals in it.  For example, the G mixolydian scale is G A B C D E F G, which is just like major except the 7th is lowered.  For G, that means all naturals (C mixolydian would be C D E F G A Bb C).  Some people will write the key signature as all naturals like C major, but I will use the G major key signature and just natural the F#'s into F's.  This is so that the reader looks at the key signature and sees G major, which carries some information: the tonal center is G and the scale has major characteristics.  In this case, mixolydian is seen as a *kind* of major, and it would be too confusing to use a key signature other than Gm or G for a piece in a kind of G major!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368620169", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Haha! \n\n...NO!\n\n**TL;DR: I disagree - fuck you read my shit.**\n\nI really don't think he'd be caught very easily at all.   In fact I'd be a lot of cash on it.\n\nHere's *some* of my reasons:\n\nTypically, cops, or more truthfully 'the system' is lazy that way.   We *know* there are serials out there operating on a regular basis that simply *don't want* to get caught.  They are mature, meticulous, and calculated.    They spend *years* sometimes between killing.   In those years, staff, files, and entire careers move on to other things and simply don't connect A to B.\n\nIt would surprise, and likely, the living bejezzus out of you as to how *little* actual 'detective work' is done these days.  So much of the 'breaks' or information comes from a couple of things:  A.  Sheer dumb-assed luck, or stupidity on the part of the criminal (there are NO criminal geniuses in prison - trust me on this!).   or B. Someone ratted, spilled, tipped off, or pointed the police to the bust.  Often, an \"investigation\" amounts to *\"...yeah, we got a call from his neighbor and checked it out - damn! Dude was bad!\"*  Media reports it as an \"investigation\" implying cops with magnifying glasses, files, and interviews.    Not anywhere near as much of that as you think.  Interviews typically amount to being labor intensive and more 'conversations' than anything looking for inconsistencies in stories, reactions from those being interviewed (dude was dumb enough to talk to the cops and was sweating in 60 degree weather....hmmm).   Far less of that going on than you think too.\n\nHomicide *is* a somewhat different matter.  Many resources go towards these units.  However, they are also constrained by lack of resources, lack of data access (or the ability to make a case for a court order to do so), and chasing down the percentages, rather than focusing on the 'heavy lifting'.   \n\nNote: This is NOT a commentary on the commitment, nor intelligence of cops or detectives in general.  But like it or not - they *are* humans in a system that steers them in directions too - or restricts them based on budgets, politics, and what someone else sees as 'better bang for the buck'.\n\nLook at the Pickton case in Canada - the one where he killed prostitutes and then fed them to the pigs on his pig farm.   The cops *knew* something was going on, but internally saw it as what they call a 'self-cleaning oven'.   After all, Picton was trash taking out the trash ...right?   Honestly, internally - this culture came to light for a bit during the kerfuffle over the fuck-ups in getting that case rolling.  EVERYONE on the street knew someone was offing women.  Many suspected outright Willie the Pig and his \"parties\".   Cops did shit.\n\nNot until a big push from some of the dead (or more accurately - *missing*) women's parents and some local politicians did the cops suddenly put some resources towards it.\n\nI don't think there's a case in Canada that could be so well known by everyone, including the cops, that had such a lack of inertia.  \n\nYou could treat that as simply a \"one-off\" case of dropping the ball ...right?\n\nNo.  Look at the Green River Killer - *that* took F O R E V E R to solve!  ...and *that* guy wasn't the sharpest pencil in the box either!\n\nThen there's Richard Kuklinski - the contract killer.  Interviewed in depth before they killed him (death penalty) he pretty much outlined some pretty brazen and haphazard kills he undertook that NEVER got investigated.  There was one case he said he was so lazy he stuffed a guy in an old oil drum outside a business near to where he killed him.  He said that oil drum sat there for weeks until if finally disappeared and there was no mention anywhere about what happened to it.  That dude killed a veritable plethora of people who were *noticed* missing.  Frankly, I think he was  a serial killer who just found a job doing what he loves.\n\nJust a couple of examples there, but you can see just how easy it is once you get past the illusions of order we all have and operate under.   It's like once you figure out how to pick locks - suddenly you're literally *laughing* at the stupidity of everyone walking around locking their houses, cars, and shit.   It's an illusion of security.  Much like the world operates.  Much like the group Anonymous has figured out - the internet is just a big illusion.  Once you get past the front end - it's scary how everything is 'right there'!\n\nBut maybe I'm just as full of shit as the next guy.   I'm sure someone thinks so.\n\nDon't let television, or movies (or the media) dictate how the law enforcement world works nor how effective it is.

Patri Friedman, son of David, is on the board of the Seasteading Institute and works in the Future Cities organization. So, ah, HONK HONK. ~You're wrong!~\n\n* However, I do see the criticism of a lot of ancap thought as being overly theoretical and low on practical implementation as reasonable, but not damning.

See Seasteading, any book by Hoppe, Rothbard, etc.\n\n* \"You need everyone believing in this society...\" -- that depends on what you mean by 'everyone.' I agree that you will never get the 330m hodgepodge of Americans to become ardent libertarians. Don't care: 90% of them could fall into the ocean. 500,000 to 1m able people, unified in purpose, would be more than enough.

Effective defense is cheaper than brainwashing that many people. \n\n* \"Culture and history come from the blood and from the earth...\" OK. To some extent. But I don't speak Polish like my ancestors did and am only vaguely aware of their cultural heritage.

A reasonable charge, but only if you actually engage with the reading: https://mises.org/daily/1709 -- criticize this Rothbard essay, for example, and then get back to me, instead of straw manning. Straw manning is easy and effective at rallying people who already agree with you, but is illogical. \n\n* 'I have the perfect solution to end history...' c i t a t i on plz\n\n* Anarcho-capitalists say 'I'm going to force this ideology on people...' citation BRO pleez!\n\n* 'Anarcho-capitalist creepy neckbeards...'

{"body": "I think the place to start is with the issue of metaphysics. Western music theory has a long history of asking questions like, \"Where does the triad come from?\" and expecting cosmic, metaphysical answers as if the triad were a natural law like gravity. A good answer to that question is that the triad is a *human tool* (like Chinese characters or the wheel) that was developed through a historical process, which itself was shaped by issues of acoustics, psychology, culture, mathematics, social structure, and so on. There isn't a simple answer.\n\nBut people wanted a simple answer, and the music theorist Jean-Philippe Rameau thought the answer had been found when the overtone series was discovered in the 1720's. If you pay attention to the first 5-6 overtones (but no less and no more!) you get something that we can analyze as a major triad in open spacing. Therefore the triad *is* a force of nature! It comes from the nature of sound itself! Or so Rameau thought.\n\nThere are lots of problems with this solution, however. It notices that a physical phenomenon (the overtone series) resembles a human tool (the triad) and assumes that there is a sort of magical causal connection between the two. This is one example of what people mean when they talk about \"metaphysical\" explanations for the \"origin\" of the triad. (NB: I do think that the overtone series and the triad are *related* things, but the relationship is much, much more complicated than merely \"X causes Y.\")\n\nFor our purposes, however, the biggest problem with the overtone series is that it only \"explains\" the major triad. The overtone series doesn't produce anything at all like a minor triad, which is a problem for us because minor chords seem just as legitimate as major chords, so shouldn't they have the same origin? Rameau tried and tried to solve this problem, but he never succeeded.\n\nThis is where, a century later, Oettingen &amp; Riemann come into the picture. They, too, are really excited about the overtone series but don't want to discriminate against minor triads. Oettingen came up with an elegantly contorted thought process that seems to \"generate\" both major and minor triads as equals, relying on German philosophy of the 1800's (especially the \"Hegelian dialetic\"). Riemann, a practical music theorist rather than a philosopher, simplified Oettingen's ideas and basically claimed this:\n\nIn addition to the overtone series that every harmonic sound creates, there's an *undertone* series that also gets created, which is identical to the overtones but descends *below* the fundamental pitch. The minor triad is generated by the undertones just like the major triad is generated by the overtones. This is a lovely explanation whose only problem is that it's dead wrong. Undertones simply don't exist like overtones do, so this answer is full of acoustics fail.\n\nBut even if the physics weren't all wrong, the theory itself has some kind of awkward problems. For one, if the C minor triad is generated by undertones, its root isn't actually C... it's generated by the undertones of the note G, so it's root is actually what we want to call the fifth of the chord. In this theory, a minor triad with C as a root is what we would call an F minor triad. \n\nThat gets awkward pretty fast. A simple circle of fifths progression (C F bdim e a d G C) is absurdly complicated from this dualist perspective, because the \"roots\" aren't all related by a descending fifth any more (since from d to G involves the \"root\" A stepping down to the root G, for example). So the theory becomes really bad at explaining harmonic progressions in terms of root relationships. \n\nOne can make many other sorts of arguments against this kind of theory (which is what \"dualism\" usually refers to), but I think that should give you a good sense of the sort of problems that come up.\n\nAs for your question #2, you ask \"Why is dualism itself, not just harmonic dualism, discredited?\" The answer is that, to music theorists, \"dualism\" always refers to Riemann-style harmonic dualism. It doesn't really have another meaning, and what Cohn is doing in this book is *inventing* another meaning. The idea behind his \"melodic dualism\" is that it takes some of the good ideas of Riemann's theory (and there were some good ideas!) but puts them on more solid ground. That's why Cohn wants to say \"This is dualism, but a different kind of dualism.\" Before Cohn, there was no other \"specific type of dualism\" besides the Oettingen/Riemann variety.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368751835", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Minor music historically was written based around the harmonic minor scale which has a raised 7th degree: e.g. in Am- A B C D E F **G#**\n\nThis raised seventh is also the 3rd of the v chord, which makes it a major V. \n\nAlso the sound of a V i or V I cadence is typically thought to be much more powerful and 'resounding' than a v i\n\nIn most orchestrated, non-folk music (as far as I know),  minor songs based around the natural minor scale are particularly uncommon. The leading tone (raised 7th) creates a lot of movement in a melody, and without it, cadences and resolution typically sound less absolute. (Think about it, the last two chords of a lot of 'classical' songs are a V-I or a V-i)\n\nOne issue with that is that the raised 7th creates a jump of a step and a half between the 6th and 7th degree, which is typically unfavorable in a diatonic melodies (especially vocal) mainly comprised of scale-wise passages. Thus, a common variation of the harmonic minor scale is the melodic minor scale, which raises the 6th and 7th degrees *ascending* but not descending.\n\nNotice the naming of *melodic* and *harmonic* minor\n\nMelodic minor is more commonly used solely for the melodies (the horizontal part of the music), while harmonic minor has a strong function in the chords (the vertical part of the music)\n\nAn interesting side effect of the raised 6th in melodic minor is that the 3rd of the iv chord is raised, thus making it major.\n\nBroad generalizations, as is typical with theory.

Here are the IPA transliterations for the non-Scottish ones in a more or less standard American accent, with the syllables marked, and with word boundaries as spaces. Poetically stressed syllables are bold. Some of the lines are really bad limericks for me, prosodically, so I've also indicated in parens a possible fix that I find more acceptable. In brackets I've put the syllables as s's, with stress as caps, and p for what I perceive as noticeable pauses.\n\n&gt; **hɪ**.kə.ɹi: **dɪ**.kə.ɹi: **dɑk** [Sss Sss S]\n\n&gt; ðə **maʊs** ɹæn **ʌp** ðə **klɑk** [s S p s S p s S]\n\n&gt; ðə **klɑk** stʃɹʌk **wʌn** [s S p s S]\n\n&gt; ðə **maʊs** ɹæn **daʊn** [s S p s S]\n\n&gt; **hɪ**.kə.ɹi: **dɪ**.kə.ɹi: **dɑk** [Sss Sss S]\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; ðeɹ **wʌns** wʌz ə jʌŋ **ɹʌs**.tɪk nemd **mæ**.lə.ɹi: [s S s s sS s s Sss] (ðeɹ **wʌns** wʌz ə **ɹʌs**.tɪk nemd **ɹɔ**.ri: [s S s s Ss s Ss])\n\n&gt; hu: **dʒɹu:** bʌt ə **vɛ**.ɹi: smɔl **sæ**.lə.ɹi: [s S s s Ss s Sss] (hu: **dɪ**.dənt meɪk **vɛ**.ɹi: mʌtʃ **mʌ**.ni:) [s Ss s Ss s Ss])\n\n&gt; wɛn hi: **wɛnt** tə ðə **ʃoʊ** [s s S s sS] (hi: **wɛnt** tə ðə **ʃoʊ** [s s S s sS] [s S s s S])\n\n&gt; hɪz **pəɹs** meɪd hɪm **goʊ** [s S s s S]\n\n&gt; tu: ə **si:t** ɪn ðə **ʌ**.pəɹ.moʊst **gæ**.lə.ri: [s s S s s Sss Sss] (ɛnd **sɪt** ɪn ðə **ʌ**.pəɹ.moʊst **gæl**.ɹi: [sSssSssSs])\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; ðeɹ **wʌz** ə jʌŋ **pəɹ**.sən ʌv **sməɹ**.nə [s S s s Ss s Ss]\n\n&gt; hu:z **gɹænd**.mʌ.ðəɹ **θɹɛ**.tənd tə **bəɹn** həɹ [s Sss Ss s Ss]\n\n&gt; bʌt ʃi: **si:zd** ɑn ðə **kæt** [s s S s s S] (ʃi: **si:zd** ɑn ðə **kæt** [s S s s S])\n\n&gt; ɛnd sɛd **græ**.ni: bəɹn **ðæt** [s s Ss s S] (sɛd **græ**.ni: bəɹn **ðæt** [s Ss s S])\n\n &gt;ju: ɪn.**kɑn**.gɹu:.əs oʊld **wʊ**.mən ʌv **sməɹ**.nə [s sSss s Ss s Ss] (ju: **i:**.vəl oʊld  **wʊ**.mən ʌv **sməɹ**.nə [s Ss s Ss s Ss])\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; ə ɹə.**pɔɹt** hæz kʌm **ɪn** fɹʌm ðə **sɑm**.bə [s sS s s S s s Ss] (ɹə.**pɔɹts** hæv kʌm **ɪn** fɹʌm ðə **sɑm**.bə [sS s s S s s Ss])\n\n&gt; ðæt ðeɹ **sæl**.voʊz goʊ **ɔf** laɪk ə **ɹʌm**.bə [s s Ss s S s s Ss] (ðeɹ **sæl**.voʊz goʊ **ɔf** laɪk ə **ɹʌm**.bə [s Ss s S s s Ss])\n\n&gt; tu: **gʌnz** ðeɪ saʊnd **faɪn** [s S s s S]\n\n&gt; bʌt ðə **θəɹd** faɪv poɪnt **naɪn** [s s S s  s S] (ðə **θəɹd** faɪv poɪnt **naɪn** [s S s s S])\n\n&gt; hi: ɛm **bʌst** ɛnd ɹə.**fju:z** tu:  goʊ **bu:m** bə [s s S s sS s s Ss] (ɛm **bʌst** ɛnd ɹə**fju:z** tu: goʊ **bu:m**.bə [s S s sS s s Ss])\n\nFor me, at least, it seems the optimal stress pattern for limerick hood is that the lines are all structured as some repetition of [sSs]. Some of these have clipped patterns, ending in a stressed syllable, anomalously. *Hickory Dickory Dock* provides some insight to what's going on. In the cases where the word's syllabic structure fails to fit into the pattern, we get a slight pause to after the word. More interesting is where the stress is placed. It looked initially to me like the stress went on the first syllable on the word (at least if we ignore the versions I find weird). But then I noticed that in the last one, \"refuse\", breaks this pattern. Looking again, it looks like the limerick prefers that the limerick stress falls on the primary stress of the word's non-limerick form. It seems like the preferred overall structure for the long lines is to have 8 or 9 syllables, start unstressed, and end stressed, and in practice you can squash syllables together, saying them much faster, if they're unstressed and the resulting timing is about one normal syllable: you get limericks like the one about the young girl named Bright, where \"in a\" is used but is said much quicker than one timing unit per syllable, almost as if it's pronounced as \"na\". This is also why my fix for the rustic limerick uses \"gall'ry\" instead of \"gallery\".\n\nSo there you have it: the *true* prosodic structure of a limerick! Or a truer one, at any rate.\n\n*Edit* The ability to use a pause in place of an unstressed syllable might allow you to say that the long lines are indeed 9 syllables, with the final syllable as a pause instead, giving the illusion of only 8 syllables due to there being nothing after the pause to make it detectable. Same for the short lines and 6 syllables. There's probably something going on with moraic time units or something similar that could clarify this issue more.

No other ap carry truly has as much ability to poke and hit the other team at such a range as him.  Nidalee only hits one, and Lux's is more easily dodged with its movement speed.  And catching someone out of position pre team fight and being able to just drop the full combo ensuring that they're dead.\n\nI might just be really biased because he's the only champion I really put huge amounts of work into since he came out.

{"body": "I'm fairly new to music theory, so others will have to correct where I'm wrong:\n\nLet's just assume that there are certain note progressions that we perceive as \"pleasant\", while others we perceive as unpleasant or wrong. There are a couple of theories on why certain note progressions are pleasing to us,from biology to psychology and cultural theory, which I'm not going to go into. The fact is that the western world shares a certain understanding as to which notes sound well together.\n\nWe assign letters to notes of certain frequencies, and we can group these notes together into what we call \"scales\" of eight notes, like C D E F G A B C. Scales are named after their \"key\" note, in this example that would be C. There are many different scales in many different keys.\n\nNow WITHIN a scale, there are certain combinations of notes that sound very nice to us when played together. C, E and G, for example, sound harmonious to our ears. Those are what we call CHORDS: Notes within a certain key that, when played together sound right to us. Depending on the notes, these chords have different names. C E G, for example, we call \"C major\". There are many more, and we don't have to concern ourselves with chord names for this explanation.\n\nNow it gets a bit tricky. We needed a way to name and describe chords regardless of what key they are in, and for that we use roman numerals. For our example of C E G, we used the first, third and fifth note of the scale. Taking the first, third and fifth note of ANY scale will always sound nice, and we use the roman numeral \"I\" to describe that relationship. There are seven of these relationships: I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi and vii. These numerals do not respond to a certain fixed sound or chord, but to a certain note progression within different soundscapes, defined by their KEY note.\n\nOkay, now that we know that we can take a look at Axis of Awesome's \"Four Chord  Song\". The name is somewhat misleading, and they cheat a bit with their execution. Because what the songs used in that track have in common are NOT chords, but a chord progression, namely:\n\nI V vi IV.\n\nthese four numerals describe four ways of playing notes from a scale that, when played in succession, sound nice to us. WHY that is is just as hard to say as to why certain frequencies sound good, why certain notes sound good together, or why certain scales seem right to us. They just are. And this progression, I V vi IV, appears to especially pleasant to our ears and turns up in many contemporary pop and rock songs.\n\nNow the original songs use this progression in many different KEYS. One song might have I V iv IV in a key of C, another in G, yet another in F. In order for the \"Four Chord Song\" to work, axis of awesome sing and play all songs in the same key (they use E or D, depending on the performance). The songs sound familiar to us because our brain recognizes the chord PROGRESSION, but if you played the Four Chord Song next to the original songs, you will notice that they actually sound different and use different chords.\n\nWhat seems like a strange coincidence becomes much less remarkable when you consider that there are only seven \"types of chords\" to chose from (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii). Looking at a large enough number of songs that use a chord progression of four, you are bound to find many with an identical chord progression.\n\nThe question remains why \"Four Chord songs\" appear to be so popular, instead of say three chord songs or ten chord songs. I can only speculate that four is a nice number even for non-musical brains, offering a decent musical palette while being easy to remember or recognize.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your corrections and clarifications. :) I advise everyone to keep on reading below for redditors who actually know what they are talking about. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368877921", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 253, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To add to what /u/ejisfun said, a big reason that particular chord progression shows up in a lot of modern music is because it's a cycle of fifths. In westerb music the 2 chirds that sound thw most \"pleasing\" together are I-V (chord built from the first note in the scale followed by the chord built from the fifth note of the scale) There is a reason for this having to do with frequencies and the way western music tunes instruments that I'm not going to get into. So let's put that chord progression into the key of C and we have \n\nC G a e F C F G\n\nIf you look at each group of 2 chords, with the exception of the last 2, they are each I-V in their respective keys\n\nC-G (I-V in key of C)\n\na-e (i-v in key of a)\n\nF-C (I-V in key of F)\n\n\n\nThe final 3 chords are what we call a cadence, a progression used to give a feeling of concluion at the end of a section of music. IV-V-I is called a perfect authentic cadence again this is an entirely different discussion but one the reasons it sounds so conclusive is because if you look at all the notes in those 3 chords you have all the notes of the key.

{"body": "It is quite easy in a Dota match to focus entirely on the mistakes made by yourself and your team, without noticing the successes of yourself and your team, and the mistakes made by your opponents.  The fact is that if you win the game, then your team has played the game better than your opponents.\n\nYou are going to make mistakes, the best thing to do when you realize a mistake is to take note of what went wrong, and think of ways you could avoid making that mistake again.  If you are having trouble with dying in the laning phase I could suggest buying more stats items early on, specifically items that grant strength, being more careful with your positioning relative to enemy heroes, ensuring wards are up in the jungle next to your lane, and paying more attention to the minimap.\n\nYou should never think of a match as hopeless.  Playing a match where your team is on severe tilt is one of the best ways to improve your play because it provides the greatest opportunity to learn lessons about playing extremely carefully and exploiting incremental advantages.  There is always the chance for a comeback due to opponents becoming overconfident, making mistakes, or plain old disconnects.\n\nPersonally I use alt + Q W E A S D for my item hotkeys.  Other common item hotkeys are extra mouse buttons, space bar, Z X C, or 1 2 3 4 5 6.  Choose whichever setup feels most comfortable to you and be prepared for a transition period as you learn to use them.\n\nThere is no way to reset your stats but if you feel really strongly about getting a new start you can acquire another beta invite and start a new account.  There is a bot on steam that gives them out, or you can send me a message on steam as I have a few extras.\n\nGood luck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368900903", "subreddit": "learndota2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Only the first mission/quest is available at the moment.\n- There are, however, guides that are fully integrated via Steam which you open up in-game to check out recommended item and skill builds.\n- Check out the side panel to the far right of this subreddit for more help.\n- Check out http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_some_basic_tips_when_starting_to_play.3F\n\n- Dota 2 can be a lot more frustrating to pick up due to a bunch of things.\n- You will notice that every hero has a proper turning animation which LoL lacks. This is in part due to balance reasons and in part to add a strategic element to the game making kiting a lot harder.\n- In place of **brush** there **trees** which act as a barrier but can be destroyed by certain items and abilities. They are dynamic compared to brush and block your line of sight too.\n- There are no **runes** nor **masteries**. Everyone starts out on even terms with no gimmicky additions that affect your in-game stats.\n- Most importantly is the fact that **ALL HEROES (champions)** are unlocked from the start. I'd advise you to play in a bot match and set the difficulty to **passive**.\n- Speaking of heroes you will find that many have passives as one of their Q W E R abilities. A lot more heroes rely almost solely on auto-attack damage.\n- The heroes are divided up into **Strength, Agility and Intelligence**. Strength universally grants Health and Health regen. Agility grants Armor and Attack Speed. Intelligence gives Mana and Mana regen. These three are referred to as the **primary attributes/stats** and every hero is one or the other. Your primary attribute also grants you attack damage. In addition there are several secondary stats you might be familiar with like attack speed, lifesteal etc.\n- While heroes may have more passives this is counteracted by the fact that **about 1/3 of all items have an activatable abiity attached**. This means that a hero with just 2 passives and 2 actives like Necrolyte can end up building 3-4 items with active abilities on them.\n- Auto-attacks are much slower at the beginning and deal less damage as a ratio to creeps' (minion) max health. Spam **S and right-click** on a target to time last hits better.\n- You can **deny** (last hit your own) creeps, towers (+ other buildings) and even heroes (under certain effects). This essentially reduces the XP (and gold) enemies gain. \n- Abilities do not scale with a stat like Ability power. Instead they will maintain their values unless you have certain abilities that boost magic damage or items that debuff enemies' magic resistance.\n- Cosmetics (skins) generally come in sets consisting of a few to several individual pieces with the exception of some heroes. (Not all heroes have skins yet).\n- There is a **voice chat** system integrated into the game. Thankfully there's also a mute option for when people become *toxic*.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1368978680", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

Rape it, with your ear. Find songs that fit that C major scale...like \"Sleepwalk\" by Santo and Johnny. Play along with them up and down the neck. Use your ear to move this same pattern up to \"transpose\" to a different key. Once you get it tonally, you can change it to a minor (melancholy) scale instead of a major (happy). Sharps and flats are your friends...half steps and whole steps, with these, you decide what the fuck you will play. Next, find \"progressions\" of chords that you might hear these jazz musicians talking about. Your ear will change your life. If you ever need anything else, we are here.

{"body": "It's about intervals. An interval is the tonal distance between two notes. There are 7 letters in the musical alphabet, and 7 degrees (notes) in most scales and all major scales. Most western music is based off the major scale, but I'm digressing. Anyways, intervals are based on the major scale. The distance between the 1st and 2nd notes of any major scale is called a major 2nd, and the first to the 3rd is a major third. The same thing applies to the 6th and 7th degrees, but the 4ths and 5ths are called perfect intervals because they affect us differently. If you lower an interval by a half step(the distance between c and c#), then it's called a minor interval, for example you could have a minor 3rd or minor 7th as well as major. (A quick note: the minor scale is not built of all minor intervals. There are actually three types of minor scale, but the natural minor scale is just the major scale but starting on the 6th note and ending on the 6th note an octave up. It is also called the 'Aeolian' mode.)  The notes of a C major scale are C D E F G A and B, in that order. the musical alphabet ends with G. So, C up to A in the same octave is a major 6th, and C up to G is a perfect 5th. The reason that we call the third note of C# major E# instead of F is that intervals are identified by the letter note names and accidentals(sharps:#, flats:b, and natural signs for which I have no type-able symbol), and so if we did use F we would be putting a diminished(for perfect intervals like fourths diminished means a half step down) fourth in a major scale. Although it would sound the same, the interval between the first and third notes of a major scale needs to be a major third. I have probably over-explained, but I hope you understand now! (Just in case you don't, another example is that C to Eb is a minor third, but C to D# is an augmented second even though they sound the same.)\n\nTLDR: although C# to F and C# to E# sound the same, they're different intervals ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369040266", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That scale isn't melodic minor, it's a normal minor scale (AKA natural minor or aeolian mode).  Melodic minor has raised 6th and 7th degrees on the way up, and is the same as your scale on the way down.  The scale you describe, while the same as the descending version of melodic minor would never be called melodic minor on its own, as it's the ascending version that differentiates it from other scales.  The ascending version on its own CAN be called melodic minor.\n\nAs to why it's different ascending and descending:  In tonal music, the strongest harmony is from the V or V7 chord (in the key of C, G major - G, B, D, or G7 - G, B, D, F) to the I chord (C major - C, E, G --  also called the tonic).  In a minor key, the tonic chord is minor (C Eb G), but the V chord is still major because it creates a much stronger resolution to the tonic chord.  However, the major V chord uses the raised 7th degree of the scale (B) which isn't in the minor scale!\n\nIt's that raised 7th scale degree that creates the strong resolution.  It is referred to as the \"leading tone\" and wants to resolve to the tonic.  So when playing in a minor key, the 7th scale degree is somewhat flexable...  on some chords it will stay to the normal minor scale (Bb) but on others...  especially those that lead back to the tonic chord it will be raised (B).  \n\nBecause of this, the melodic minor scale was created.  It sort of approximates the way that minor music actually happens.  When leading  down from the tonic, it's just a normal minor scale, but when approaching it from below, it creates a stronger resolution by approaching the tonic from a half step.  In addition to this raised 7th scale degree, the 6th degree is also raised while ascending in order to avoid the awkward interval that would otherwise occur between the 6th and 7th scale degrees.\n\nThis pertains to most music, but not all.  In some rock, pop, and blues the v chord is left minor in a minor key and everything stays within the natural minor scale.  \n\nIn jazz, the melodic minor scale is very important and is used in a plethora of other ways...  other modes are derived from it and it is responsible for much of the sound of modern jazz.  However, in jazz, only the ascending portion of the scale is relevant.\n\nEDIT: just to be clear the ascending portion of the C melodic minor scale would be: C D Eb F G A B C.

I understand that you might be trying to make sure that you hit your shot, but consider the downsides to waiting: First, when you decide to take the shot, he may move suddenly, causing your shot to miss. It's a lot better to take the shot as soon as your crosshair is on him. Secondly, he may hear you, or gain info from teammates on your position, you want to give the enemy less time to react. Another thing I noticed is that you dont use cover to your advantage. When you miss a shot with the AWP, you give away your position and they can easily kill you before you can shoot again with your AWP, what you should do is strafe in and out of cover, only exposing yourself for the shot. Now, the main problem I'm seeing is with your movement in general. I noticed that every time you draw your sidearm in the middle of a gun fight, you turn away from the enemy to try and jump. This is not good because you will not only lose sight of your enemy, but its SO easy for him to shoot you. When you are mid air, its super easy to predict where you will land and your almost definately going to be killed. What you SHOULD do is face the enemy, strafe left and right with A and D (be careful not make your movement predictable, for example, instead of going A D A D A D, try A D D A D A A A D D A A, making it harder for him to predict your movements). When facing multiple enemies, running for cover is the best idea, but do NOT jump, like I said before, it's a lot easier to kill you. Hope I could help man!

{"body": "Sona changes seem to be in line with what I percieve as riot's crackdown on free stats granted. I expected a flat out nerf since sona has been picked so much in competitive play, but was happily surprised when it came as just a shift in power. \n\nIt seems like a buff early game meaning you can harass more safely and one misstep lvl 1-3 won't mean you give up first blood. Since I guess most people level q w q w q anyway, the persistent w aura changes will net more mr and armor at early ranks and the active slightly less. It will be a hit to her free stat in teamfight potential, much like the original nerf to taric's w was supposed to be.\n\nI'll have to relearn a bit how much I can take now that she's more durable, but it will be easier to establish lane dominance now that she is not as squishy. It might be less hellish to play sona lvl 1-3 against an aggressive support if you're purple side with these changes, which I welcome. Though I guess golems spawning at 1.55 helps that anyway.\n\nOverall, I expected a flat out nerf, not a shift in power and am happily surprised.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369204603", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Against all-in lanes, I use hp quints and armor reds. If you're not against a lane that can straight up kill you, I use hybrid pen reds (magic pen works too) and gp10 quints.\n\nThe standard harass combo for sona is auto - q - power chord. For trading, you want to power chord w the opposing ad for the damage reduction. Be careful of your positioning, if you get caught in cc you most likely will die or have to blow flash.\n\nI almost always go q w q w and then max q, get r whenever I can and get a point in e when we start grouping. E is not very useful in the laning phase compared to and extra level in w.\n\nHer ulti can be used either offensively or defensively. Offensive use is as an initiate tool (keep in mind flash r, it's a very powerful initiate) or to lock down their ad/ap carry for your team to clean up. Defensively you can use it to protect your ad carry from divers. Don't be afraid to only hit one person if it's the best choice, for example a fed kha'zix jumping on your fed ad carry.\n\nYou ideally want to get a health crystal on your first back unless you can afford a straight sight stone. Sona is super squishy, and extra hp early really helps. Usually my core is sight stone into ruby sight stone, philo stone and boots 1. This is what I try to leave the laning phase with. If you are way ahead in gold, you might want to consider a chalice. Otherwise, communicate with your jungler and build either an aegis or locket depending on which aura item they are making.

{"body": "Sorry for the wall of text- didn't mean to write that much. Hopefully it helps!\n\n* The others have touched on parts* of the answer to your question, so I'll try to add on a bit. First of all, what you hear as being melodious is completely ingrained in you because you (I'm assuming) grew up in the western world. We are brought up hearing everything in an actual key, with specific rhythms always in a specific meter. However, if you were born in Syria (for example), you wouldn't be concerned with an instrument being in tune, as our idea of \"in-tune\" developed solely due to western ideas. Much of Arabic music uses scales and tunings that would sound absolutely horrid to you, but that's because you aren't used to them. (We have the well-tempered clavier to thank for that- before the new tuning system was invented, you would probably think that much of what Bach wrote was \"out of tune.\")\n\nThis is a recent post by myself that addresses your question about rhythm:\n\nFirst of all, you are correct that this originated as a western thing. If you ever listen to traditional Chinese or Cambodian music, you will feel odd mixes of rhythms or a complete lack of meter. Meters stem from \"rules\" that were set into place that were eventually built on by more and more composers until it got to where it is today. Perhaps an easy way of seeing this progression is to listen to some early and late Gregorian chant.\n\nSecond point, humans really really like patterns. If I were to type out 9 dashes, I I I I I I I I I , I guarantee 99% of readers will break up these dashes up into either 3 groups of 3, 4 groups of 2 with an added dash, or some other compounded grouping. Very very rarely will people look at all of those dashes and immediately say \"9\" without doing some kind of grouping. Why is this important to your question? Because of the way we group up musical phrases. Using 4/4 as an example, it's very easy to equal phrases with a final cadence tagged on (one reason I used \"9\" as an example: two phrases of 4, followed by a downbeat chord). \n\n* Now to answer your original question- Many people have their own definitions of music, but I try to nail it down to its most simplistic form: Use of sound to convey a message (with intent). We (westerners) have the notion that there must be many measures with a chordal structure in a specific key, with all of the notes having specific \"mathematical\" relations to each other. This is inherently *false*. The blue man group proves this wrong daily. You don't need notes to have music. You also don't need rhythm (think ambient music used in yoga studios- they use really long held out chords that aren't in any specific time signature, it's simply used to convey a feeling). So if we don't necessarily need rhythm, and we don't need a key, then what is music? Music is whatever you want it to be. Listen to John Cage- his stuff is kinda out there, but it's still music. If you want to write a song with 2 notes that hold for 5 minutes, that is considered music, so long as it is written with intent. The sound of rain isn't itself music, but if you record it and play it back with the intent to sooth someone, then it becomes music. So on a very basic sense, music **is** a bunch of tones, we (westerners) just happen to have taken those tones and made it impossibly complex by requiring certain rhythms and incredibly difficult to understand harmonic relationships.  \n\nSource: I'm a classical musician and I've studied this kind of thing quite a bit.

{"body": "**[edit]: After reading some of your comments, I realize that I probably covered some things you already knew. Ignore anything that's too obvious.**\n\nA chord progression is simply a sequence of different chords. When you put them together, it helps outline the structure of a song.\n\nFor example, let's say you're in the key of C. That means that all the notes you'll be using aren't flat or sharp. Just plain ol':\n\n**C D E F G A B C**\n\nA very common chord progression for a major key is **I V IV**. These roman numerals are read aloud as \"one, five, four\", and refer to the note that each chord starts on. Let's see what this would look like in the key of C.\n\nWhen I say **\"one\"** I mean the first note of the scale I'm playing in, which in this case is C. So I play a C major chord.\n\nWhen I say **\"five\"**, I mean the fifth note in the scale, which in this case is G. So I play a G major chord.\n\nWhen I say **\"four\"**...You probably get the pattern by now. So, IV means a chord built on F. In this case, an F major chord.\n\nSo, in C: **\"I V IV\" = \"C G F\"**\n\nNow, as a bassist, just beginning to play around with chord progressions, you can probably just play the roots of these chords. The root is just the note the chord starts on, and none of the other notes in that chord. So in our chord progression, you would just have to play the notes C, G, and F. On a bass guitar, one way to play this would be:\n\nThird fret on the A string; third fret on the E string; first fret on the E string.\n\nThe awesome thing about naming chord progressions with roman numerals instead of the names of the notes, is that you can easily switch keys and still have the chords function the same way.\n\nFor example, if you were in G instead of C, we could still play I V IV, and it would sound very similar! However, instead of C G F, since our scale starts on **G** we would play **G D C**, which are the first, fifth, and fourth notes in the scale.\n\nIn addition to major chords, like those that happened to be in my example, there are minor chords. To understand the difference, we have to look at what exactly a chord is.\n\nEvery chord is built upon a **triad**. A triad is a collection of three notes, with a specific distance between each of these three notes. All triads are built upon the **root**, with the **third** and the **fifth** note above that. So let's say we wanted to build a triad starting on C, in the key of C.\n\nOkay, so our **root** is C. Now we need to find the third above that. So we count:\n\n    C D E\n    1 2 3\n\nAlright, so the third will be \"E\". Okay, now we need a fifth.\n\n    C D E F G\n    1 2 3 4 5\n\nSweet, so G will be our fifth. Put it all together, and we have **C E G**, which is a C major triad.\n\nNow let's talk about the difference between minor and major chords. Minor/major only refer to how far away from the root the third is. A third that is far away, and more high up from the root note is called a **major** third, because the distance is larger, or more major. A third that is closer to the root, and lower, is called a **minor** third, because the distance is smaller, or more minor.\n\nSo, take our major triad: **C E G**. It's called a major triad because the distance between the C and the E is a major third.\n\nIf we took the triad, and made the **E** into an **Eb** (lower a note by one half-step, or go down one fret on a bass), we would change that distance from a major third into a minor third. Now, we have **C Eb G**, which is a **minor triad**. Major chords are denoted with a capital roman numeral (like **I**), whereas minor chords are denoted with a lower-case roman numeral (like **i**).\n\nThe way that scales are put together, every note in the scale has its own triad that is either major or minor (or dimished, but we won't get into that). If you're in any major key, regardless of what key, the pattern is always the same.\n\n**I ii iii IV V vi vii°**\n\n*the \"°\" means diminished*\n\nSo, as you get more fancy with chords, you'll probably begin to play **arpeggios** - where, instead of just playing the root of a chord, you might play the different pieces of the chord at different times. So, instead of just **C**, you might play **C G E C**, or something like that.\n\nI apologize for the wall of text, and I know I diverged a bit from what you were asking, but I hope some of it is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions about what I said.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369375207", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are different versions/variations of the minor scale.  By simply referring to *the* minor scale most would think of the natural minor scale, which for A is A B C D E F G (it uses the same notes as C Major and, thus, is it's the relative minor).\n\nThe *melodic* minor raises the sixth and seventh degrees *when going up*.  Going Dow it is the same as the natural.  This is probably the one you saw the showed A minor as using F# and G#.  The reason for this variation is that it's fairly common for composers to use a raised sixth and/or seventh degree in ascending minor key melodies.\n\nThe harmonic minor uses a raised seventh degree going both up and done.  The reason for this variation is that, when building chords, it makes what was the v chord into a V chord, which has a stronger pull back to the i (tonic).  It can also be used to make the III into a III+ chord or the vii into a vii^o chord.\n\nSo, your chord progression is a perfectly acceptable i iv v v progression using notes from the natural A minor scale.

So a natural progression would be Fmaj7 -&gt; Emin7 (this is what you have done so far) -&gt; Dmin7. I think that because you went down a half step to D#min7 instead but didn't like the sound, vanblah saw your lydian chords and probably assumed you meant to be a full step down. The reason it works and sounds good to mine (and a few others) ears is because you are keeping the voicing the same and moving chromatically, which always produces a nice effect. From there you could even move to a G#7 if you wanted and land somewhere in the key of C#, or keep modulating down with the same min7 voice you were using.

I, and lots of other players will gladly stand on your ammo box and give you free points in exchange for more high velocity pixels. The same can be said if you're playing assault, throw dem medkits. Don't throw ammo/medkits out in the open though, throw them next to cover.\n\nBe proactive with repairs if you're running engineer. Not many people are, so if you are, you will definitely not go unnoticed.\n\nIf you're running assault, don't rambo revive unless you are ABSOLUTELY SURE you can pull it off and not get yourself killed and the person you just revived (again). It's usually better if you stay hidden/behind cover and be a spawn point for the squad rather than risk yourself trying to save someone and die, thus losing the squad a potential spawn point right next to a contested objective.\n\nSlow down, don't run everywhere. Aim down sight as you're going slowly around a corner so you're ready for whoever might be around it.\n\nSpot everything. Q Q Q Q Q Q 24/7/365. That way if you don't end up killing something, your teammates know where it is and can help you out.\n\nCamp if you want to. It's a legitimate strategy. If the other team can't get rid of you, that's their problem. You're defending an objective they're trying to attack.\n\nLearn the maps. This is probably the #1 thing for playing BF3 well. The better you know the maps and the routes you can take, what you can or can't jump over, and the routes that other people commonly take, the better off you'll be.\n\nWatch your minimap. If someone's spotted or firing unsuppressed, they'll show up as a little red arrow. Use your knowledge of the map and their position to figure out a route that will give you the best shot at killing them.\n\nDon't forget about semi-auto mode on the guns. Full auto/burst mode kills people quickly, yeah, but a few quick, well placed single shots can kill just as easily and save you ammo in the long run.

{"body": "&gt; Or is the answer just \"try it out, and if it sounds good it is good\".\n\nThat's pretty much it.\n\nIn theory, the melody will be one of those notes in the chord, but in practice, it can be a note in a different chord, or it can be a note not in the chord that *suggests* a note in the chord.\n\nFor example, say you have a C chord, C E G.  The singer will probably be singing a C, E, or G, but the singer could also sing other notes in the way.  The singer could sing the melody C D E F G; the D and F are not in the chord, but they complete the scale.  They're called passing tones, because they're not *important* to the harmony; they're just notes along the way.  These are called nonharmonic tones, and there are a bunch of different kinds.  A neighbor tone would be something like the F and D in E F E D E, which basically just makes the E more interesting.  More interesting still are suspensions and appoggiaturas, which are when the *strong* beat is a nonharmonic tone but then it *resolves* (in a suspension, it's held over from the previous chord, but don't worry about that for now).  For example, the melody could be, slowly, F, E, and the F *really* wants to resolve to the E.  You could even go crazy and have the F *not* resolve to the E, which will leave the listener unsatisfied.  Some composers are that evil on purpose!\n\nWhat about a B?  The chord C E G B is a Cmaj7, so if you sing a B over a C major chord, it could go either way -- the B could be a nonharmonic tone (C B A G melody, for example, has the B as a passing tone) *or* a note in Cmaj7, changing the definition of the chord.  Bb would make it a C7.  A would make it a C6.  D would make it a Cadd9.  F# could make it Cmaj7#11 if there's a B too.  But it has to be *important* to the chord, not just a passing tone!  It's not an exact science to determine which it is.\n\nHope that helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369536720", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I saw the basic design on YouTube (I can't remember who made it. but the basic room design is not mine).  The basic rooms are built as such:\n\n    S S S S S\n    S       S\n    S       S\n    S       S\n    S D S D S\n\nS = Stone (or any other building block)\n\nD = Wooden door\n\nThe rooms can share walls like so:\n\n    S S S S S S S S S\n    S       S       S\n    S       S       S\n    S       S       S\n    S D S D S D S D S\n\nOutside of the doors on the upper levels, I placed a 3 wide walkway with a fence for the perimeter.  Stairs between the levels are placed at one end.\n\nMy particular version of this design is six floors (rooms are 2 blocks high, and ceilings are three blocks thick - the thick ceilings are to ensure the villager code recognizes the difference between levels - I'm not an expert on this - I just saw it in the video I watched, and followed directions).  Each floor has two rows of six rooms, back to back.  This makes for doors on both sides of the building.  The layout for one set of back to back rooms is as such:\n\n    S D S D S\n    S       S\n    S       S\n    S       S\n    S S S S S\n    S       S\n    S       S\n    S       S\n    S D S D S\n\nFinally, every room must be lit.  I find that a single torch in the center of the rear wall of each room is more than enough.  I also added windows in the center stone column between the doors for each room.

As the paper notes, you need to take the left Kan extension along v of the first argument:\n\n    type (:*) (f :: k -&gt; *) g a = (f a, g a)\n    data Lan f g a = forall b. Lan (f b :-&gt; a) :* g b\n    -- I stole Lan from category-extras and adapted it to what I needed,\n    -- the proof that this is the left Kan extension in this category is left as an exercise for the reader\n    \n    type (:=&gt;) (f :: * -&gt; k -&gt; *) g = forall a. f a :-&gt; g a\n    -- morphism in the category of functors between Hask and Hask^k.\n    type (f :. g) a = Lan v f (g a)\n    -- (f :. g) = Compose (Lan v f) g\n\nAnd now you can write `ijoin` as:\n\n    ijoin :: (m :. m) :=&gt; m\n    -- ijoin :: (m :. m) a :-&gt; m a\n    -- ijoin :: Lan v m (m a) :-&gt; m a\n    -- ijoin :: (Compose (Lan v m) m) :-&gt; m a\n    -- ijoin :: (exists b. (v b :-&gt; m a) :* m b) :-&gt; m a\n    ijoin (Lan f m) = ibind f m\n\nAlso, `ireturn` has the type you'd expect, `ireturn :: v :=&gt; m -- v a :-&gt; m a`.\n\nSo `IFree` should be the free relative monad on `v`. That's very cool! It's also the first time I see a pratical application of relative monads outside of category theory.

{"body": "At a certain point, the keys you are putting down really don't control the pitch that comes out—your voicing does. This is especially true on soprano, where C# and above are all dependent on the accuracy of your voicing.\n\nIf you have spent time voicing on alto, you're going to find that the room for movement on soprano is very small. For example, if you can do pitch bends on palm keys on alto down a perfect 5th, and then attempt to do the same bend on soprano starting on the same note, you'll find that the tone drops out almost immediately. The same tongue movement on alto that gets you a P5 will be too much on soprano, so you have to make it smaller. Generally I feel like getting a pitch down the same interval on soprano requires only about 1/2 - 2/3 as much movement as it does on alto. It takes a while to get accustomed to the change in relative space.\n\nTo start with, begin by playing a short major scale, 1 up to 5 down to 1, on G in the second octave (G A B C D C B A G). Instead of playing this cleanly, **voice the crap out of it** and gliss the whole thing as smoothly as you can. Make sure you get all the way up to pitch on the D at the top, because it's easy to be flat on it while doing this. Repeat this over and over, and each time give each note a little bit more definition, a little bit less of a gliss. Once you're comfortable up to D, then go up a half step and start on Ab going to Eb. \n\nYou can continue doing this up as high as you want, really. After doing this for a few months altissimo A and B become part of the standard range.\n\nEDIT: forgot to address the different necks.\n\nThe necks respond differently because of the change in geometry. When a tube is bent, the volume of the tube increases with the radius of the bend. Thus, going from a straight neck to a curved neck makes the volume of the neck greater and as a result acts to increase the size of the instrument's bore. Generally speaking, larger-bore instruments tend to have a \"darker\", \"rounder\" sound with less emphasis on high overtones and more emphasis on the fundamental. This is interpreted by the player as added \"resistance\" because it requires greater effort and focus to make the upper partials present in the sound.\n\nUltimately the choice of neck is up to the player's preference. I prefer a straight neck because I feel it is more free blowing and offers me easier access to the upper range of the instrument, and when you're playing violin transcriptions, you're up there a lot. However you do need to be aware that in order to achieve proper mouthpiece angle relative to the embouchure, you need to have the horn pointed out more with a straight neck than with a curved neck, which can be tiring, and also has the effect of directing the sound more towards the audience... i.e., you will sound louder and more direct.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369636877", "subreddit": "Saxophonics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Open position means you are playing the chords that incorporate open strings in the first fret area.\n\nGenerally in guitar you are playing 1 finger to a fret. Your position is the fret that your first finger is over. So if your first finger is over the fifth fret, second finger sixth etc. you are in fifth position.\n\nOpen position might be a little confusing because your first finger will probably play notes on the first fret. The difference between first position and open position is really based on the fact that you are making use of the open strings in a pretty regular fashion.\n\nOpen position C is:\n\nx32010\n\nThat is from the sixth to the first string. \n\nBarre chords are great because they are movable. If you know the major barre chord, you can move that to play any other major chord.\n\nG Major:\n355433\n\nThat would actually be the first place to start before intervals: Learn the notes. \n\nIf you don't know the names of the notes on the fretboard, you should start. Having a good grasp of at least some notes on the E and A string will make it easy to come up with chord progressions quickly. You don't have to sit down and make a project out of memorizing them all on the guitar (at least right now). A lot of that comes with time and just thinking about it. It is good to learn where C D E F G A B are, and then learn the others in relation to them. If you have no idea what I am talking about, don't worry, you will soon enough.\n\nThat site I linked to you uses the staff at points. I wouldn't worry too much about that. It is very possible to learn theory without looking at sheet music. If you feel so inclined, go for it. It shouldn't be too hard learning theory with just note names though.\n\nAgain, don't let it stress you out. Music theory doesn't just start pulling new concepts out of thin air. It all builds up logically from the basics.\n\nThis is a good start to learning the notes: http://www.justinguitar.com/en/TB-006-NoteCircle.php Frankly, it is the only resource I could find that doesn't use the staff.\n\nAnother resource from the music theory subreddit: http://academic.udayton.edu/tobyrush/theorypages/\n\nJustinguitar.com can teach you quite a bit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369670603", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\nThe problem is the rate spammers create new accounts and compromise existing ones.  \n\nBlocking all references to \"Egpal\" won't block E.g.p.a.l. E G P A L and various iterations etc.  So it's a rather crude instrument.  But it's pretty standard spam filtering.\n\n\n&gt;banning x/100 legit players is worse for player experience than having x complaints about spam.\n\nConsidering the amount of spam one account can send this is probably wrong.  It depends what problem exactly they have, the first, which is just new accounts being generated rapidly spamming a few lines of text and then being blocked is a bit different than compromising an account spamming with it until it gets blocked and hoping they can use that spam to compromise a new account.  They're going to be dealing with both, but each problem is a bit different.  \n\nFrom the sounds of things they're worried about the latter more than the former.  And there you have to be ruthless.  If a guildleader (fleet leader in this case) gets hacked you want to shut that account down ASAP, same with officers or really any account with a decent set of assets.  Restoring even one account is bad enough, restoring a guild leadership account can be a nightmare because you suddenly have the guildbank to deal with as well. \n\nIf spam leads to hacked accounts, or is from hacked accounts, it's very much worth being safe rather than sorry, the damage that could ripple through the game far exceeds an banned account that can be unbanned.  Now admittedly, banning on a single word seems like it's going to produce an unhelpfully large number of false positives but more sophisticated systems might be in place too.

{"body": "Multi-tasking and fast paced enviroments for jobs (batending/waitressing/kitchen) is by far soo much easier than working at a desk. The more things change the easier it is to follow. It's the monotonous repetitive actions that cause the most stress.\n\nI personally think I deal with stress in a different matter. You were given 2 weeks to do  something and Only 2 days left till a big project is done?? Big deal, I already know that I will wait till the last minute and still succeed at it, so I\"m not going to fret and worry for the whole week until I *finally* start to do it.\n\nThe ADHD also lets me not worry about critism as much. Yeah, you are mad at me, I fucked up, still ahven't done what I supposed to and I feel downright horrible but then there's always chipmunks, sprinkles and the wind to distract me, so I can carry on. \n\n(But...sometimes  I also dwell on things because my brain gets stuck in a loop so even though no one else knows that soemthign is wrong I feel guilty about not holding hte door open at the gas station and I'm such a horrible person by not taking the whole world into consideration and I'm so damn concieted)\n\nQuick thinking is natural. If I'm presented with a problem I can come up with a solution (sometimes too many) to remedy the situation and be on it while the rest of whoever is involved is still overcoming the initial shock of it. (Good common sense is also a factor...)\n\nI can grasp most concepts fairly quick by seeing things as a whole instead of just inital concept.

{"body": "I heavily disagree with the later parts of your statement.  Starting skill is all up for grabs on Renekton, Q against range, W for Lv1 fights or Lv2 All-in, E if you haven't leveled your skill yet and you spot the enemy jungle coming to gank with your early ward.  All of Renekton's skills are great to start with and should only be leveled when needed instead of right when the game starts, I usually hold off of levelling a starting skill on Renekton because of possibilities.\n\nMaxing Q is always the best option, it offers sustain and has the best level up increases.  Maxing W is useless, it decreases the CD but you only want to use W when you have fury or when you desparately need it for various reasons.  Renekton is a lane bully and while lower CDs help him, his engagement timing is locked down to Fury meter.  This is not the only reason why maxing W is terrible on Renekton, but because if W's level up increases too, it is absolutely terrible.   Compare 20 dmg per level from W to 30 damage per level on E and Q, not to mention that levelling Q also increases his healing and his healing cap and that levelling E greatly increases his mobility.  \n\nOn Renekton, it should always be R Q E W prioritization because the advantages of levelling up W are just so poor.  As Renekton, you always want all 3 of your spells in your first 3 levels, Q to generate fury and sustain, W to stun and trade, E to (dis) engage.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369733149", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The Ground EFX would probably fall apart in a week or two if I used it?  No way to know for sure.\n\n**Just found a review from Andrew of New England Detectors, it is crap, he sells them hesitantly:**\n\n\"We have had them for a few months now. PIJOE tested it out as well as a few other guys. In the end the Ol saying goes \"you get what you pay for\". You can even use a Minelab Battery pack thats how similar it is. The pack it comes with is a dead ringer for Minelabs. To be honest it does have allot of really nice features but it missed its mark particularly in actually working , . The head tilts it has a super bright back-light, GPS and cam locks. It's way too heavy and the coil attachment looks like a plastic complicated mess. But , if it actually worked and gave true readings it would be desirable. We do offer them but they are for the absolute beginner. I would rate it as a Kids detector someone about the age of 8-10 years of age as the bells and whistles would keep their attention going and interested in the hobby. Heck all the falseing it does will keep the kids busy for hours. \nThe Compadre will smoke this detector in performance and its priced equally . This is a case where they put money in gadgetry and not an actual working detector that and having it made in China. \n\nThe company that is selling them actually makes game camera's for hunting they are out of Texas I believe.\n\nI'm thinking yes, the intuitive design and the highly accurate GPS capabilities (Accurate to 1 mile radius) give this detector and edge over the CTX. Believe it or not this machine is water resistant as well. I think they call it the Swarm for a reason. I think flies flock or \"SWARM\"to it because its a piece of F E C A L matter hence, the name swarm. \n\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369753953", "subreddit": "metaldetecting", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I got a basic one.\n\nTricks for figuring out major scales.\n\nTo be memorized: F C G D A E B - the row of sharps. The row of flats, which is the same thing backwards, is to be memorized as well.\n\n1) Major scales with sharps: semitone below the tonic is the last sharp.\n\nExample: E major. Semitone down is D#. Recite the row of sharps until you reach D#: F C G D - there's your E major key signature.\n\n2) Major scales with flats: tonic + 1 are your flats.\n\nExample: Eb major. Recite the row of flats until you reach Eb, then add one more: B E A - there's your Eb major key signature.\n\nIf you're not sure whether it's a flat or a sharp key, try both ways. Generally, if a semitone down you get a double sharp - it's a flat key. (e.g. G# major, semitone down is F double #, therefore it's Ab major). However, there are keys that can be written both ways (e.g. F# major and Gb major). Choose the one that is more convenient (e.g. Cb major has more flats than B major has sharps)\n\nApply the same method reversed to figure out the key your piece is in.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369769774", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My three year old has speech problems. For example if he hurts his leg he'll say \"Did you hurt your leg?\" Lately I find myself talking to him as if I am him. He repeats back to me what I say.\n\n*want the dog*\n\nI want the dog\n\n*I want the dog*\n\nWill you hand me my dog?\n\n*Will you hand me my dog?*\n\nFunny, he seems to get what I'm doing. I've also been working to teach him how to say things like \"let me go\" if we are wrestling around or something. He only recently started using yes and no before that he would say want the  _____ or don't want the _____. When he was very young he thought that saying \"try it\" meant no because that's what we always said when we wanted him to eat something he didn't want to. \n\nAnother thing relating to scripts is using the pronoun I. Normally when he asks for something he simply says \"want the _____\". If I say \"ask nicely\" or \"what's the magic word?\" he'll say \"I want the ______, please Mommy.\" My husband says people are going to think I beat him. For some reason that prompting sets ofrrf the script with the pronoun. I mean, don't we all think in scripts? I can't remember learning to type but I have issues with spelling and tend read whole words or sight read rather than breaking the down phonetically. My 3rd grade teacher taught me to spell e s p e c i a l l y by doing a chant. And even know I do the chant in my head every time I spell especially.\n\n\nOn the other hand he knows his letters, the sounds they make and he can write his name. I'm pretty sure he's advanced in that area.\n\nSorry this is so long. If anyone has advice on teaching a child on the spectrum speech I'd love to hear it.\n\n\nalso I have no idea why the ask nicely is in bold.... gottago!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369778489", "subreddit": "aspergers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Modes. Just what the heck are they, anyway? (This may be longer than 5 minutes, but still.)\n\nThe major scale, of course, is characterized by the following interval series: W-W-H-W-W-W-H. Modes are simply different interval relationships--the ones we talk about most often, the seven basic modes, are all taking the above series and starting in different places.\n\nIonian mode is our major scale: WWHWWWH.\n\nDorian mode starts on the next tone, so it becomes WHWWWHW.\n\nPhrygian mode is the next: HWWWHWW.\n\nLydian is after that: WWWHWWH.\n\nMixolydian after that: WWHWWHW.\n\nThen Aeolian, or our minor scale: WHWWHWW.\n\nThen Locrian, the least common, as it is \"diminished\": HWWHWWW.\n\nThe troublesome part of modes, where many people run into problems, is that two modes can share the same notes, and also share the same chords constructed. C Ionian and D Dorian (and E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, etc.) have the same notes and the same tertial chords, so what differentiates them?\n\nThe difference is what you tonicize--that is, what you make your \"home\" tone. This means that if you're writing in D Dorian, you might avoid Bdim, as they will move much more naturally to C, unless you're sure of what you're doing. Also, you'd do what you could to, using D E F G A B C D, make D sound like home instead of C.\n\nOne way to tonicize modes is to use the chords that set them apart from \"vanilla\" major and minor (Ionian and Aeolian).\n\nDorian: using ii and IV often works--Dm and F, in C Dorian.\n\nPhrygian: using (b)vii and (b)II (in fact, the sequence of i-II-III-II-i in Phrygian is often employed in--stereotypical--Spanish music) C Phrygian might, therefore, use Bb minor and Db major a lot. \n\nLydian: a lot of people use II and vii to differentiate from major--for C Lydian, this would be B major and D major.\n\nMixolydian: like major, but with a v instead of a V, and a (b)VII instead of a viim7b5. Those two, which for C would be Bb major and G minor, are employed a lot in folk and blues.\n\nLocrian: because the tonic chord is diminished, this mode isn't used a lot for tertial harmony. But if you had do, I'd say emphasize the (b)II, (b)vii, and the (b)V. For C Locrian, this'd be Bb minor, Db major, and Gb major.\n\nHope this helped at least a little bit with some of the difficulties with modes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369801451", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

But even those changes STILL lead to the same outcome.\n\nSecond, there's a bit of a mindfuck in the choice you make. In \"traditional\" symbolism, a bird would signify freedom and a cage the opposite. In this game, however, the bird might as well symbolize Songbird (the opposite of freedom) and the cage stands for the notes C A G E which, in the end, mean FREEDOM for Elizabeth.\n\nThird; in the final scene when the Elizabeths drown you, you will notice that none of them are wearing the pendant.

{"body": "I have a lot of nightmares. Here is one of the most memorable nightmares I've ever had:\n\nMy mother was in the living room standing in front of the couch folding laundry. She had the laundry basket on the couch and was separating different piles of clothes on the cushions. We had a giant mirror above the couch - it was a wedding present to my parents. I walked into the room and we were just chatting about nothing significant. I was watching her fold clothes. Her reflection in the mirror caught my eye and I felt like something was off. Then I realized that her movements in the mirror were delayed slightly. I looked back over to my mother, only to see her staring back at me, even though I could see in my peripheral vision that her reflection continued to fold laundry. I opened my mouth to scream but no sound would come out. I felt panicked. My heart was racing. I felt my body stiffen and I S L O W L Y began to fall backwards, until I was flat on the ground.

The T430 and T430s can be equipped with an Intel i-Core**M** (M for mobile) and a discrete graphics card. The T430u and T431s come with an Intel i-Core**U** (U for Ultra-low-voltage CPU, basically a underclocked Intel i-CoreM) and don't have a discrete graphics card. They use the integrated graphics solution of Intel, the Intel HD4000. Furthermore they offer only a 3 cell battery, but this is compensated with the Intel i-Core**U**, which need less power than the normal mobile Intel i-Core. And the only display resolution for the Ultrabook ThinkPads is 720p, not really a highlight.\n\nHere is a size comparison between the T430 and T430s: [Pic 1](http://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_migrated/pics/IMG_1805.JPG), [Pic 2](http://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_migrated/pics/IMG_1810.JPG), [Pic 3](http://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_migrated/pics/IMG_1812.JPG)\n\nThe T430u/T431s is a little bit slimmer, compared to the T430s.\n\nThe normal 6 cell battery in the T430/T430s should give you about 6-7 hours of battery life (web browsing and office work), with the 9 cell battery you would get about 10 hours.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369859419", "subreddit": "SuggestALaptop", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The locrian mode begins on the seventh degree of the major scale, it is a mode. If someone is in the key of G ( G A B C D E F# G) You start on F# and play through to F# (F# G A B C D E F G) It sounds a little unique, so pay attention to phrasing and phasing (playing in time as sound comes to you.)\n\nInversions: Covered in other posts.\n\nTypically in creating a chord in western music, you make intervals out of major and minor thirds. Lets say you're playing an A minor, which is notes A C E. Let's increase this to two minor thirds, so A C Eb. You are now playing a diminished chord (two minor thirds above the root.) If it was an A Major, A C# E and you moved the E up a half step, that would be two major thirds above root, this is augmented. Essentially it is an issue of a chord being too 'minor' or too 'major.'

{"body": "Riffle shuffling (that cut smash shuffle thing that you are able to do because of card sleeves) is mechanically similar to a standard poker shuffle right because you cut the deck into two, deck A and deck B, then you restack them such that you approximately get a new stack that goes ababababab. This is actually not a random rearrangement because theoretically if you get a 60 card deck into 2 30 card decks, went abababa, then split it again into 2 more 30 card decks, C (ababab) and D (bababa), and restacked those, you would get a new pile that goes cdcdcdcd, or aabbaabbaabb, which you could do again and the stack would become abababa with an off set (so is A was a1a2a3... and B was b1b2b3... originally, the first stackw ould be a1b1a2b2a13b3..., the next would be a1a16b1b16a2a17b2b16..., then the next would be a1b1a16b16a2b2.... Right ok so math an patterns, this is not a \"random\" distribution because we can trace a pattern. The end deck will be mixed up, but predictably so if we knew the original order of the deck. But that's not how you shuffle. You do not cut exactly 30 card decks and you do not perfectly ababab shuffle; you make estimations and errors and are a human being so you do not know how off your cuts are and how many fail riffles you have, adding hysteresis to you shuffle. Given the average ammount of hysteresis added per shuffle and the way previous hysterseses compound with continued shuffling, statistically a deck shuffled 7 times is about something like 97% as random as the deck would be if you had shuffled the deck this way with the same kind of average hysteresis infinity time (yes, statistics + calculus happening here). So realitistically, if you deck was in any order, could be lands and each card next to each other or already random or whatever, if you riffle shuffle 7 times, statistically, your deck should be 97% as random as it would be if you shuffled this way infinity times. If you don't trust this science, there is a kind of work around. Ok so back to the hysteresis of the errors and stuff I mentioned before, those A = 28 card B - 32 cards, or the stack goes abababbababaabab etc., the errors made in the eraly shuffling create more randomness than the errors made in the later shuffles because those errors get shuffled which causes them to spread, creating more randomness faster. With this in mind we can create and already complex starting stack, the intitial complexities of which we can pretty much denote as errors and then start our 7 shuffles from there, so we have many errors before we even start ensuring we maximize our randomness. We does this with the pile shuffle, which is where you make X piles (I go 5, but it really doesnt matter) and you deal out the deck into piles A B C D E... and then stack them in any order, but for the simplicity of illustration will say you stack them ABCDE on top of each other. So your initial deck went 1 2 3 4 5... 60, your new deck goes 1 6 11 16 21 2 7... 60, split these in to A and B, A is 1 6 11 16 21 2 7 B starts somewhere around the 30th card, which from our original stack would be card 10 15 20 25 30 35 40, although ther will be errors just from the cut, then the folloing riffle shuffle, do that 7 times and you have a random stack. REALIZE despite the scientific logical kind of justification for this, you are still dealing with largely random events here and this means land clumps are still possible. Luck is a huge part of magic and that cannot be ignored, but if you want scientific randomness:\n\nTL;DR Pile shuffle once, riffle shuffle 7 times.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369948851", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll give you the blitz version:\n\nFirst, they tuned based on fifths. Start with C, tune G a perfect fifth up from C, D a perfect fifth up from G, and so on. So when you follow this all the way around, you get to B#:\n\nC G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E# B#\n\nIn theory, that note should be the same as C. Unfortunately, the way the math works out, you're left with something called the [pythagorean comma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_comma), which is the tiny gap between B# and C. From there on, the history of tuning is basically a balancing act of where to put the comma. For example, you can just take one fifth and make it shorter than the others, which makes *that* fifth very ugly, but the rest of them much prettier, and it makes B# line back up with C.\n\nThis is not so bad if your music sticks to keys that don't use that fifth, but composers didn't want to do that! They wanted access to all 12 keys to be freely usable, so tuners came up with various ways of spreading out the pythagorean comma while trying to keep the intervals as pure as possible. Equal temperament is basically the most equal (duh) spreading of the comma, where all fifths are equally impure. Not great for beautiful intervals, but it makes the keys totally democratic, so composers can freely modulate wherever they want.\n\n**tl;dr** you can either have perfect intervals or have all your keys be in tune.

{"body": "(Post is directed at solo players who would like to help the overall game/team rather than follow the group and farm HKs/zerg nodes. **Also note this IS FOR RANDOM BGS ONLY, DO NOT CARRY ANY OF THIS OVER (except flag carrier stuff in wsg/twin peaks) TO RATED BGS).** And also this is speaking to OP, who is a mage. So not all of this applies to all classes.\n\nQuick note on gear, get the crafted gladiator set from the auction house for your class, it's usually pretty cheap (100-300g each piece). If not so cheap, fill the blanks in with \"contender's\" gladiator gear and heroic instance blues. Your first honor purchase should be the PVP trinket that removes status effects (medallion of the horde) for 1750 honor.\n\n----\n\nThere isn't a lot you can do now, random battlegrounds are almost entirely random in terms of win/lose. Funny thing is, both sides say \"we always lose\".\n\nFor WSG and Twin Peaks (and to a lesser extent EotS) you can help by assisting the flag carrier in any way possible, don't just damage enemies, root them, stun them, poly them, even if it just keeps them from the flag carrier for just a second, it can sometimes be enough (you'll want to do this mainly when the flag carrier has the flag and your flag has not been taken, or has only just been taken. Once the carrier is in your base and properly reinforced with 1-2 other people, leave (or stay if you're one of the 1-2 people) and help the team in killing the other flag carrier).\n\nFor AB/EotS/Gilneas/Deepwind the main thing to do here is defend. Defend, defend, defend, and do not fight on the roads. Stick by a node so you can either click the flag and cap it, or if you're defending, get the +50% honor buff. These are the ones where your team also needs to not be terrible, unfortunately, and the chances of this are really low. If the resource count gets to a point where it seems unrecoverable and no one is even making an attempt to make it better (it does happen, there are achievements for it) just stay with the group and farm kills, it's not really helping but you might as well have fun while the ship is sinking.\n\nFor AB specifically, lumber mill is the best spot to call out incomings (your team will love you for this, even if they say otherwise. ex: \"inc 3x BS\", \"BIG inc mine\"), blacksmith is the best place to hold due to the graveyard's location in the map (being the center, means less travel time) and the mines no one really pays attention to terribly much, so usually there will only be 1-2 (or 0) people defending it, making it easy for a solo player to come cap.\n\nFor EotS specifically, I try and stay at the blood elf tower and call out incomings. EotS is a weird beast due to how flag caps react with the number of nodes you have captured, so it very much depends on your team.\n\nFor AV, this is a bit of a tricky one for just \"one\" person. Something you can do is cap the mines (specifically the alliance mine far north, just go in the lower entrance and kill the named NPC in the center), they don't help a terrible amount but they do have an effect somewhat on the reinforcement count. Capping bunkers is the obvious one, and you'll need to defend the flag for a few minutes before the bunkers burn, and the NPC buffing the end boss (van) despawn. This is similar to AB, you'll need to D D D D D, and as soon as all (or all save for one) of the towers are capped/about to cap everyone has to rush the boss and kill him ASAP. Given this is a 40 player BG, the results are usually up in the air. Also ***NEVER EVER EVER EVER CAP SNOWFALL GRAVEYARD UNLESS THE ENTIRE MAP IS RED!***\n\nAnother AV strategy is to defend at galv (the big bunker near our northernmost towers) and wipe the alliance. This can be extremely successful, but only if done properly. Most of the raid needs to D galv, while the rest goes to kill balinda and cap the graveyard(and bunker) next to her. What this does is it delays the alliance by quite a bit, they will be sent back alllll the way to their entrance at the stormpike graveyard. When you all rush back out, they will likely try and run past, you can farm them a bit but LET THEM CAP SNOWFALL GRAVEYARD so they res below you not above you causing a turtle. This ensures you have a gain over bunker cap time before they cap towers. Again, with how AV is, this all depends on the group (and to add, old AV was far more complex, but also took a lot longer).\n\nStrand of the ancients is kind of an annoying BG honestly, as a single person the best you can do when attacking is either defending the siege weapons/delaying them and people like the flag carrier situation in WSG or killing the turrets (if anyone is using them) near the gates, either way works semi-alright, once you guys get to the chamber gate, grab bombs from the siege workshops and drop them off at the gate as fast as you can, ignoring any alliance. Once dropped, spam AOE, CC and damage to prevent the bombs from being disarmed. For defending, the only thing you can really do is kill sieges and disarm bombs ASAP.\n\nIsle of conquest is a difficult one. Everyone always says go docks, then the entire team ignores that plea and everyone goes workshop. I've found personally the most you can do as a single person is go for the hangar, if others see you going, usually 3-4 more will follow. Many times the enemy also avoids capping hangar, so it's basically a freebie. Once capped, get on the airship and attack a gate (usually the west alliance gate, near the boat/quarry if you guys don't have docks at this point, or the east one opposite if you do have docks. If you manage to hold workshop somehow (its rare but happens) attack the south gate instead.). Once you are over the base, jump off the airship and you will get a parachute buff (yes really, im not trying to kill you. [You also get an achievement](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=3854)), from there you can get bombs and start bringing the gate down, with minor defense from the alliance. A lot of people ignore hangar (I've been in games where no one capped it either side) but it has a strategic edge to it.\n\nNow, the group itself will be focused on workshop/docks and the siege weapons. While you can help in these spots, it seems like you're not wondering what you can do while following the group, but rather, what you can do without following the group because the group might be terrible, that's what these suggestions are for.\n\nUsually by the time you cap hangar and are working on the gates, your team (if they aren't the apex of absolute bad) should have at the very least capped workshop or docks, preferably both. If both, you will get some defenders in their base stopping your bombs, usually more reinforcements come, but if not and you die get back to the gunship and use the turret instead. If more reinforcements do come, as soon as the gate is down cap their graveyard (the flag on the opposite side) and kill the boss.\n\nAnother thing you can do is try and cap quarry, but there is usually 1-2 rogues/druids/hunters waiting there and defending and the effort it takes to kill them, wait for the cap, and then wait a bit to make sure they don't come back isn't always worth it by that point in the game.\n\n-One last tip that applies to all PVP in general but especially BGs is *kill the healer first!* If your group is on someone and they won't die or look to be getting healed, look for the healer, target them, and unleash hell/interrupts. Eventually your team should see this and change targets as well.\n\n----\n\nA note on AV/Isle bosses: NEVER RUN OUT OF THE ROOM. IF YOU HAVE AGGRO JUST DIE, WHEN YOU RUN OUT HE WILL RESET AND GAIN HEALTH BACK, OR GO BACK TO FULL.\n\nI probably forgot a couple BGs. I didn't mention kotmogu because I personally rather hate it and have it blacklisted from my randoms list. The same goes for silvershard mines, however this one I can give some advice on, protect the minecarts until the very last second--similarly, snag minecarts from the other faction *at* the very last second (this minecart thing also applies to deepwind, though less as much). Other than that it's really just deathmatch, like kotmogu.\n\n----\n\n**edit:** fixed my horrible spelling and replaced a few incorrect BG names.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1369968093", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Look, no one is saying that they are terrible employers. Some might have terrible managers, but as a whole they don't mistreat any worst than a big number of minimum wage or near minimum wage retail jobs. \n\nYou make a reasonable case for how it's an optional service. However they are still the middleman retailer in a world that quickly doesn't need them. Instead of playing nice with the publisher and turning gaming into something renewable, they've supersized the problem and if you enter a Games shop now, they don't even bother with used sections anymore and just put it next to the new copies calling them \"recycled\". \n\nThe fact to me, is that the used market only really saves me money if I become an active participant in it by either waiting and hunting for used games, which they never really offer for much more than 5bucks off the new price... Or if I buy new games but return them fairly quickly so I can get a reasonable amount of money back. Both of which has me hunting in bins which seems absolutely ridiculous since when I enter a game store, I know what I want.\n\nFact is, unless it's directly on my route to work or something, if I have to travel more than twice for a game, it's just not worth whatever saving they offer me. Also, since I like to actually keep my games just in the event in the future I decide to pick them up and play them again, as long as used games are a big thing, publishers will feel the need to price games fairly expensively since they have to make most of their money off the first batch of games that go out.\n\nPoint is, I don't save a damn penny off the used game market, if anything, retail is making it so that games can't come out early or at lower price on many digital services so t o d a y, as in 2013, Gamestop is costing me money especially when it comes to console games. \n\nAn online or partially online console would suck, but for me, Fury, if they came up to me and said... Hey... 30 or 40 buck games instead of 60 on release, but you can't sell them back? Ill take the option that has 20-30 more dollars in my pocket each time.\n\nP.S.: Please note, having this outlook with regards to Used games and Retails games practice, does not reflect my outlook on anything else. Nor do I think that this retail practice is in any way shape or form the fault of the employees if anything, anyone should at least work in retail once in their life so they can understand how people can be dicks.

{"body": "The problem with Phrygian is that is ascending motion is not as goal oriented as its descending line (where flat 2 creates a powerful descending leading tone.) I've done a lot of research on Hindustani Ragas, and Phrygian is a very common pitch set with a unique set of applicable chromatic inflections. Often times, on an ascending line of the scale, the second scale degree can be raised, which will make the ascending scale sound more like minor and ground it in a somewhat more \"familiar\" tonality. This effect can be heightened by raising the seventh scale degree in addition, which will strongly emphasize the arrival to the modal  center. The descending scale should be a natural Phrygian, although it you want to truly emphasize arrival at your modal tonic, raise the third scale degree. This, in a descending line, creates a powerful goal oriented motion toward your tonic pitch (the same effect as 6 - 7 - 1 in harmonic minor)\n\nAnother good technique that works well in modal music is the use of a drone that will highlight your melodic lines arrival at a certain pitch. If you're trying to establish E Phrygian, play a sustained E (or E - B - E') in the background, which will cause your melodic line to gravitate to, as well as find stability in, both E and B as modal centers.\n\nJust noodle on the piano with these ideas, and use your ear!\n\nScales mentioned:\n\nAscending -\nE F# G A B C D E\nE F# G A B C D# E\n\nDescending -\nE D C B A G# F E\n\nAnd again, add the drone and you'll really feel the effect and your mode will have a sense of strong identity", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370001498", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

I figured it was going to be leftovers at this point, so I went back to sleep after lowering the oven temp to 180 (lowest temp it will hold).\n\nI pulled it out at 8:00am...a little dry, but oh well!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370011996", "subreddit": "BBQ", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

In the harmonic series that brass players use it will essentially be C (below the staff) G, C, E, G, Bb (unused).\n\nSo pushing down 2nd valve is the same as barring the first fret on your guitar in concept.  1st valve, 2nd fret.  1&amp;2, 3rd fret.  It's the same series of notes, just a step in the other direction.  For guitar it would be a half-step higher.  On trumpet each valve combination will be a half-step lower.  But the concept is the same.\n\nNow let's say you were looking at the 3rd open note in that series on trumpet (C in the staff) and you added 2nd (B), 1st (Bb), 12 (A), 23 (Ab) and now you should be at 1&amp;3 for G, but that's not the way you do it.  Because that same G is also the 2nd in the open series so you can play it that way and it'll be more in tune and sit better on the horn.\n\nSame concept as on guitar.  You could play an A on the 5th fret of your low E string, but you don't necessarily have to when you can just use the open A (depending on several factors obviously).\n\nI think this idea of thinking about it is brilliant from a knowledge standpoint, but I'm not sure if it will translate to being able to play and read trumpet music much better.  You eventually just need to know the fingering of a note automatically without thinking it when you see it on the page the same way if someone called out a G chord you'd play it in two seconds without thinking at all about hand position, which fingers go on which strings, or which actually notes your playing.  You just know how to play it, and probably in several positions.\n\n\nAs to your second question, honestly it's mostly about history and tradition when the instruments were first being made.  Bb trumpets also tend to play more in tune more easily than C trumpets.  Many instruments were constructed certain ways due to limitations of resources or other factors and then just stuck in the keys they were originally constructed in.\n\nThis does serve a purpose for instrument families though.  You learn one set of fingerings that applicable to every instrument.  Open is a written C on C trumpet, written C on Bb, written C on Eb, etc.  even though they sound different concert pitches.  But you don't have to learn multiple different fingerings that way.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370027511", "subreddit": "trumpet", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
