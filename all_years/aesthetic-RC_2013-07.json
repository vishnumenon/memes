{"body": "Giving this my usual long-winded go, I'll cover more of the modern stuff. I hope someone else can chime in about the historical context of these modes. \n\n**What are modes? How do I mode? HELP! MODES!** A guide by BRNZ42\n\nThe concept of a mode is one that carries a lot of historical baggage, and something that might mean different things, depending on the context. Essentially, a mode is a scale, a lot like the other scales you probably already know (major scale, minor scale). What makes modes unique is their relationship to one another. Nowadays, it's common to take the concept of modes and use it far beyond their original origins. This guide will look at the practical side of modes, something every performer should know. For the historical side, see [here](this is where I would link to someone else's writeup about church modes and greek modes).\n\n**Introduction: Diatonic Modes**\n\nWhen most people talk about \"modes,\" without being any more specific, what they are talking about are the diatonic modes. To understand this, let's look at a concept you should already be familiar with: relative major and minor scales. (If you don't get this concept yet, turn back now!)\n\nC major and A minor are related scales. Though they sound very different, and carry with them completely different connotations, they share all the same notes.\n\nC major: C D E F G A B C\nA minor: A B C D E F G A\nThe notes even appear in the same order. The only difference between these two scales is their starting notes. Because they share the same 7 pitches, these two scales are \"related.\" The concept of a \"Relative Minor\" is a very big part of composition technique throughout the common practice era, and even into popular music. \n\nNow, it might be tempting to say that the minor scale *comes from* the major scale. It's tempting to say that the minor scale is what happens when you play a major scale from 6th to 6th. This is would be only half true. The minor scale isn't just a derivative of the major scale. *It is it's own thing.* The diatonic modes are the same way. Many students learn them as *coming from* the major scale because it is a great way to learn them. That's how we are going to approach them in this guide. But know that these scales aren't derived from the major scale. In fact, most of them predate the use of the major scale as we know it (see church modes). \n\nSo knowing all that, let's take this concept further. We can see that we can make a different scale by taking our major scale and choosing a different starting point. Let's start on note number 2, and see what we get. \n\nC major, start on 2: D E F G A B C D\nNow that's a cool little scale. It's not a major scale, or a minor scale, but it still sounds nice. It sounds like a logical collection of notes, because the intervals are logical. In fact, it's the same set of intervals from our major scale and minor scale, just in a different order once again. Okay, so we got a scale. Now we need a name. \n\nIt turns out this collection of notes already has a name. Way before the major scale became all the rage, church musicians called it \"Dorian,\" and that's the name we'll use. We call this scale \"D Dorian,\" but we also realize that it is the 2nd mode of C major. Now, we can make a major scale start on any pitch, so why can't we make a Dorian scale start on any pitch? We can. \n\nLet's do, say, F Dorian. There are a couple of ways we could think about that. We could examine the intervals from D Dorian, and copy them, only starting on F. Let's try. \n\nD Dorian: D E F G A B C D\n\\W/ \\H/ \\W/ \\W/ \\W/ \\H/ \\W/\nIf we copy those whole and half steps, but start on F, we get:\n\nF Dorian: F G Ab Bb C D Eb F\nWe could, however, remember that Dorian is the \"2nd mode of the major scale,\" and this makes the process even easier. If we know that Dorian is the 2nd mode, or the mode that starts on scale degree 2, all we need to know is what scale degree 1 is. So we ask ourselves: \"If F is 2, what's 1?\" Going down one whole step from 2 to 1 tells us that our \"parent\" major scale, so to speak, is Eb major. Knowing that, we can apply all the accidentals from Eb major (you do have your key signatures memorized, right?) to a scale that starts and ends on F. If we do that, we'll get the same answer as above, F Dorian. \n\n* A common tripping point: At this point, many students simplify things, and say that \"Dorian is the 2nd mode,\" and they move on from there. This can lead to confusion when students *only* think of modes in terms of their \"parent scale.\" If I asked for, say, Bb Dorian, a student might think that Bb refers to the parent key. They would then think, \"dorian is the 2nd mode,\" and gives us a dorian scale that starts and ends on C. *THIS WOULD BE WRONG.* \n* When naming Modes, it's just like any other scale. The note name, is the starting pitch for that mode. The concept of \"parent key\" is an artificial one anyway. It's useful for us to learn these scales, and why they are connected to one another, but they are independent units. D Dorian doesn't *need* C major in order to exist. It's perfectly happy on its own. \n\n**Here are your diatonic modes:**\n\nSo if we extend this concept for every scale degree of the major scale, we get the diatonic modes. Diatonic refers to a specific set of intervals (5 whole steps, 2 half steps, in which the half steps are as far apart as possible when extended over multiple octaves). We know this set of intervals as a major scale, but for something to be diatonic, it doesn't have to start and end on any specific note. We've already seen how the minor scale and the dorian mode both use the same set of pitches as the major scale, just with a different starting point. So if we did this for all 7 notes of the major scale, we would get all 7 scales that could be classified as \"diatonic.\" When we do that, we get the 7 diatonic modes. \n\n* keep in mind, these scales may all be related to a \"parent\" major key, that is an artificial construct we use to categorize them. It happens to be a particularly useful construct, because it helps us breakdown and analyze many kinds of music. But never forget that some of these scales existed long before this line of thinking became popular.\n\nSo without further ado, here are your diatonic modes, their names, and their intervallic relationships.\n\n-------------------------------------\n|Major scale| Ionian | W W H W W W H|\n|2nd Mode | Dorian | W H W W W H W|\n|3rd Mode | Phrygian | H W W W H W W| \n|4th Mode | Lydian | W W W H W W H|\n|5th Mode |Mixolydian| W W H W W H W|\n|6th Mode | Aeolian | W H W W H W W|\n|7th Mode | Locrian | H W W H W W W|\n-------------------------------------\nSo this works. But it's a ridiculous way of memorizing these scales. The most important things to know about these patterns is how they relate to the major scale, and what they actually ARE. Let's dive into that. Let's look at Lydian. \n\nLydian is the \"4th mode of the major scale.\" That is to say, it is all of the notes in the major scale, in the same order, just starting and ending on the 4th degree. So F Lydian should have all the same notes as C major. If we break down the notes, here's what we get:\n\nF lydian: F A B C D E F \nCompare that to F major:\n\nF major: F A Bb C D E F\nNotice that the only difference between these two scales is that the 4th degree is raised in F lydian? That's a much more useful way of memorizing what a lydian scale is. It's exactly like a major scale, but with a raised 4th. Let's do that for all the modes:\n\n* Ionian: Major Scale\n* Dorian: Minor scale, only with a natural 6th (as opposed to a lowered sixth usually found in minor).\n* Phrygian: Minor scale, only with a lowered 2nd. \n* Lydian: Major scale, only with a raised 4th.\n* Mixolydian: Major scale, only with a lowered 7th\n* Aeolian: Natural Minor\n* Locrain: Minor scale with a lowered 2 *and* a lowered 5. \n\nWith the exception of Locrian, all these modes are just one note different from either major or minor. That's much easier to retain, and speaks to the *sound* of each mode. \n\n**Expanding The Concept of Modes**\n\nAs you may have gathered, when we talk about modes in contemporary terms, we are talking about creating a scale by starting an existing scale on a different scale degree, but keeping the same notes in the same order. This is useful because it let's us look at chord progressions and lines in a different light. For example, a common jazz progression would be Dm7-G7-Cmaj7. Now, all of these chords are in C major, but a soloist might look at each chord and break them down by mode. Dm7 is the ii chord in C, so a soloist might play D Dorian over that chord. Similarly one might play G Mixolydian over the G7 chord, because the 5th mode fits over the V chord. In theory, this shouldn't change anything because the actual pitches aren't changing. In practice, however, using a different approach and a different fingering pattern will lead to different lines, and will add variety to your solo. \n\nBecause of how useful this approach can be, this modal concept can be applied to other scales that are common, if not strictly diatonic. The most common application of this idea (in jazz, at least) is using modes of harmonic and melodic minor, especially when a song is in a minor key. Let's look at a common example of this.\n\nWe're in a minor key, and we come across a V7 chord. Now, we know that the leading tone in that V7 chord comes from Harmonic minor. So it might be helpful to think of that chord as implying the 5th mode of harmonic minor. So if we're in F minor, that five chord would be C7. The fifth mode of F harmonic minor would be:\n\nC Db E F G Ab Bb C\nThis scale works particularly well over V chords in a minor key, and is much better than Mixolydian (the normal mode we would associate with a dominant chord, because Mixolydian is the 5th mode of major). We could have just used the 5th mode of Natural minor (Phrygian), but by using Harmonic Minor, we get that leading tone in there. \n\nThere are 4 main scales that come from harmonic and melodic minor that see significant use (in jazz, at least). \n\n* 2nd Mode of Harmonic Minor: This is Locrian with a natural 6. It is useful for iiø7 chords in minor keys.\n* 5th Mode of Harmonic Minor: This is Phrygian with a Major 3rd. It is useful for V7 chords in a minor key (especially V7(b9))\n* 7th mode of Melodic Minor: This is also known as the altered scale or the diminished whole-tone scale. It is useful for altered dominant chords, especially chords like Calt7 or C7(#9). These chords will also tend to be used as V chords in a minor key.\n* 4th mode of Melodic Minor: This is Lydian with a lowered seventh. This is useful for Dominant chords with a #11, like C7(#11). This scale works particularly well over tritone substitutions.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn contemporary use, \"modes\" means a scale that is formed by starting another scale on a degree other than 1. When we create all the diatonic modes, we find they are identical to some traditional church modes the predate the major scale. So we use these names to describe these modes. We name a mode based on what note it starts on, *not* it's parent key. We can apply this concept to non-diatonic scales (especially harmonic and melodic minor) to create useful scales, especially for jazz soloists. \n\nAt the end of the day, this way of describing modes is more of an analytical and pedagogical tool, then it is actually describing the music. A ii-V-I progression doesn't rapidly change from D Dorian to G Mixolydian to C Ionian. The entire progression uses C major, but knowing those modes might help us play interesting lines.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372697747", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**(1)**\n\nPlay the white keys on a piano from one C up to the next C: \nC D E F G A B C. \nThis is the C major scale. \n\nNotice that the scale is made up of: a Root (C), Major 2nd (D), Major 3rd (E), Perfect 4th (F), Perfect 5th (G), Major 6th (A), Major 7th (B), (and then repeats at C an octave higher). Notice that there's a whole step between each note, except between the 3rd and 4th notes and the 7th and the root (an octave higher).\n\nIn other words, from C (the root) to D is a major 2nd. From C to E is a Major 3rd. From C to F is a Perfect 4th, etc. (If you don't understand this, your first step is to back and review intervals before learning about modes. Musictheory.net is good for this).\n\nThis set of intervals is the structure of any major scale-- it's pretty much the definition of a major scale. (e.g. If we build a major scale on D, it will have the same set of intervals: D is the root, E is the Major 2nd, F# is the Major 3rd, etc.)\n\n*****\n\n**(2)**\n\nNow play the white keys again, this time start with G, playing from G up to G:\nG A B C D E F G.\n\nIf we think of G as the root, and look at what intervals are involved, we get: a root (G), Major 2nd (A), Major 3rd (B), Perfect 4th (C), Perfect 5th (D), Major 6th (E), *MINOR* 7th (F), and the root (G, an octave higher). Compare this with the intervals I listed for the C major scale above.\n\nNotice that this is not a G major scale: a major scale has that specific set of intervals I listed above. This scale has a Minor 7th (F) where the major scale would have a Major 7th (F#). In other words, this scale has a whole-step between the 7th and the root, while a major scale has a half-step.\n\nWe call this scale G Mixolydian. It is a mode of the C major scale, that is, it uses the same set of notes as the C major scale (both scales contain just the white keys). However, it is *not* a C scale. G is our root. \n\nThe fact that this scale is the 5th mode of C major (i.e. built from the 5th note of C major) is just not important for most purposes. What matters is how this compares to **G** major.\n*****\n**(3)**\n\nWe now have the interval structures for two different scales:\nMajor Scale (a.k.a. Ionian):\nRoot, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Maj. 7\n\nMixolydian:\nRoot, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Min 7\n\nLet's pick a random note on the keyboard, let's say Bb, and build a major scale. Following the interval structure listed above, we get:\nBb C D Eb F G *A* Bb\n\nIf we build a mixolydian scale on Bb, we get the following:\nBb C D Eb F G *Ab* Bb\n*****\n**(4)**\n\nChords are built by skipping every other note in a scale.\n\nIf we go back to our C major scale, and build a three note chord (triad) off of the root, we would play the root, skip the 2nd note, play the 3rd, skip the 4th, play the 5th. C, E, and G. Therefore this chord, having a root, major 3rd, and perfect 5th, is a major triad.\n\nWe can build chords off of each note in the scale. If we build a three note chord off of the Second note in C major (D), we would play the 2nd, skip the 3rd, play the 4th, skip the 5th, play the 6th. D, F, and A. While D is the second note of the C major scale, it is the root of this particular chord. while F is the 4th note of the key/scale, it's is the third of this particular chord (If D is our \"1\" then, some kind of E would be \"2\" and some kind of F is \"3\", and so on). However, notice that D to F is not a major third: it is a minor third (D to F# is a major third; F# is not in the key). Therefore, the chord built off of the second note of the scale is a minor triad.\n\nThis is important information because it applies to any major scale: The chord built off of the first note in the scale is major. We can call this the \"one\" chord (labelled roman numeral \"I\"). The chord built off of the second note of a major scale is a minor chord. We can call this the \"two\" chord (labelled roman numeral \"ii\"). We can keep going and build chords off of every degree of the major scale. \n\nThis is what it means to be in a \"key\": we are using a scale as a resource for harmony--the chords are built to conform with the set of pitches in the scales.\n*****\n**(5)**\n\nWe can build chords with more than 3 notes, by continuing to skip notes up the scale. If we take our triad built off of the root of a major scale, (root, third, fifth) and skip the 6th, and add the seventh, we will have a four part chord: a seventh chord, because it contains the seventh. This would be a major seventh chord: a major triad with a major seventh. We can do this on each degree of the scale; each note in the scale will produce a specific chord structure.\n\nIf we wanted to continue with 5 part harmony, from the seventh we can skip the root and add the second. But now, because we are in the second octave of the scale, we will call the root the eighth note, and the second the ninth note. Therefore we can call this 5 part chord a ninth chord. The ninth chord built off of the first degree of the major scale is called a major ninth chord. Of course we can also build 5 part chords off of each of the other notes in the scale.\n\nWe can keep going. If the ninth is the second note in the scale an octave up, the 10th would be the third an octave higher. The four becomes and eleventh and so on. So if we have our 5-part ninth chord, and wanted to add a 6th part, we would skip the tenth and add the eleventh. Note that the tenth is already present in the chord in the lower octave, as the third). If we add go one one more to a 7-part chord, from the eleventh we would skip the 12th (the fifth) and add the 13th (which is the 6th in the higher octave). We have now added every note in the scale: the scale only has 7 different notes; if we add another note from the 13th by skipping the 14th (the 7th), we end up at the root two octaves higher, right back where we started.\n\n*(Note that in practice, you usually don't hear extended chords with every note included. Usually you would just grab root, third, seventh, maybe one or two extensions.)\n*****\n**(6)**\n\nWith this side discussion on chord construction we've arrived at an important point. We now have a new way of thinking about a scale:\n\n*A scale is the linear arrangement of the fully extended harmony.*\n\nThis is important to understand, because with this statement we can see that *a scale and a chord are the same thing*. In other words, if arrange the notes step wise (one after the other) within an octave it's called a scale. If you stack them in thirds over the course of two octaves it's called a chord. With this new piece of information we can go back to our Mixolydian scale and return to our discussion of modes.\n*****", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372708284", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "**(7)** \n\nRemember that the Mixolydian scale had a structure of Root, major 2, major 3, perfect 4, perfect 5, major 6, and minor 7.\n\nIf our root is G that would be G, A, B, C, D, E, F, (G).\n\nIf we are to arrange this as a chord (by skipping notes) we get:\nRoot, major 3, perfect 5, minor 7, major 9, perfect 11, major 13.\n\n(Remember that a 2nd becomes a 9th in the higher octave, so major 2nd = major 9th. A 4th becomes an 11th in the higher octave, so perfect 4th = perfect 11th. A 6th becomes a 13th in the second octave so major 6th = major 13th).\n\nSo now we can see how and why modes are used. \n\nIf you stack a Mixolydian scale as a chord, you can see how the first three notes spell out a major triad. *Therefore, the Mixolydian scale can be used over a major triad.* e.g. play a G major triad with the left hand, and improvise with the G Mixolydian scale in the right hand.\n\nIf you stack a Mixolydian scale as a chord, you can see how the first *four* notes spell out a major triad with a minor seventh: in other words, a *dominant seventh chord*. i.e. G Mixolydian works over a G7 chord, because the notes in the chord are contained within the scale.\n\nIf you stack a Mixolydian scale as a chord, the fifth note is a major 9th. A dominant seventh chord + a major ninth is a dominant ninth chord (usually just called a ninth chord). i.e. G mixolyidian works over G9. \n\nWe can keep going but you probably get the idea. A scale will work over any chord that contains the notes in the scale.\n*****\n**(8)** \n\nIf you stack a major scale as chord you get:\nRoot, major 3, perfect 5, major 7th, major 9, pefect 11, major 13.\n\nNote that both the major scale and the mixolydian scale contain a major triad as the first three notes. Therefore, both scales will \"work\" over a major triad (i.e. both G major and G mixolydian will work over a G major triad).\n\nHowever, look at the 4th note you get when the major scale is stacked as a chord. It is a major seventh. Major triad + major 7th = Major ninth chord. Here's where the major scale and the mixolydian mode differ. The G Mixolydian scale will not work over a G major 9th chord, and the G major scale will not work over a G dominant ninth chord.\n*****\n**(9)**\n\nHow to know when to use which scale?\n\nRemember that the mixolydian mode was built off of the 5th note of the major scale. e.g. G mixolydian is the fifth mode of C major. So in the key of C the chord built off of the fifth note (the \"V\" chord) will naturally take the Mixolydian scale built off of that note. \n\nHowever, for practical purposes, there's no need to think of modes when playing key-center based music: if you're in the key of C, playing the C major scale over the C major chord (the I chord) and then playing G mixolydian over the G major chord (the V chord) means that you're just playing the same scale over both chords--it will give you a different perspective, but the notes will be the same.\n\nThe real benefit of modes is that it gives you tools to play over songs that aren't necessarily major/minor key based; i.e. songs that use non-functional harmony. Imagine a song with a chord progression of G7 to Bb7 throughout the tune. These two chords don't belong to any one key: this is a situation where you'd want to think modally, i.e. play G mixolydian over the G7 and switch to Bb Mixolydian over Bb7.\n\n*(Note that chord-scale theory is *not* an improvisation *method*. Many students are misguided when they are taught to play x scale over x chord. Chord-scale theory let's you understand harmony, which notes are strongest or most stable against a particular chord how to add extensions. Learning improvisation is more about learning how to target chord tones on the strong beats, and embellishing a melody using mostly chromatic devices.)\n*****\n**(10)**\n\nSo I used the major scale and the Mixolydian mode as examples in this essay. Since there are seven notes in the major scale, each one of those notes can be thought of as the root of a different mode; each one will be distinct, and the fully extended chord will be different for each mode. \n\nThe seven modes of the C major scale are:\n  \nC Major scale (a.k.a. C Ionian): C D E F G A B (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, Maj7)  \nD Dorian: D E F G A B C (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nE Phyrigian: E F G A B C D (Root, min2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nF Lydian: F G A B C D E (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, Maj7)  \nG Mixolydian: G A B C D E F (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nA Aeolian (a.k.a the Natural Minor Scale): A B C D E F G (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nB Locrian: B C D E F G A (Root, min2, min3, P4, diminished 5th, min6, min7)  \n\nWe can say these seven modes are *relative* to each other, because they use the same set of notes. In other words, D dorian is relative to C major.\n\nIf we build each of those 7 scales on C, and look at their structure, we get:  \n\nC Lydian: C D E F# G A B (Root, Maj2, Maj3, Augmented 4th, P5, Maj6, Maj7)  \nC Major/Ionian: C D E F G A B (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, Maj7)   \nC Mixolydian: C D E F G A Bb (Root, Maj2, Maj3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nC Dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, Maj6, min7)  \nC Aeolian/Natural Minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb (Root, Maj2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nC Phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb (Root, min2, min3, P4, P5, min6, min7)  \nC Locrian: C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb (Root, min2, min3, P4, diminished 5th, min6, min7)   \n \nWe can say that these 7 modes are *parallel* to each other, because they are built on the same *root*. In other words C Dorian is parallel to C major, while C Dorian is relative to Bb major. (Also, try to figure out why I listed them in that order!)\n\nIt's up to you to go through them. Just remember what the important information is: \n\n* What is the interval structure of the mode, and how does it compare with the major scale *built on the same root*? \n* What are the chords produced by the mode when you skip every other note? What is the triad, what is the seventh chord, and what are the extensions? \n* Learn to sing each of the modes from memory; this is how you will learn the individual character of each. \n\n***** \n**(11)**\n\nBeyond the modes of the major scale, (and aside from the chromatic scale) you also have the seven modes of: \n\n* The Melodic Minor scale (a.k.a. the jazz minor scale) \n* The Harmonic Minor scale \n* The Harmonic Major scale \n* The Double Harmonic scale \n\nAnd there are the three symmetrical scales: \n\n* The symmetrical diminished (only two different modes) \n* The symmetrical augmented scale (only two different modes) \n* The whole tone scale (only one mode) \n\nThese scales pretty much cover every possible scale/chord. Some people may include pentatonic scales, but those are really just derivatives, created by leaving out a couple notes from the other scales.\n\n(For a more in-depth resource on the theory/philosophy behind scales, see:\n[TheTonalCentre.org](http://www.tonalcentre.org/), and\n[Slonimsky's Thesaurus Of Scales And Melodic Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Thesaurus-Scales-Melodic-Patterns-Text/dp/082561449X))\n*****\n**(12)**\n\nThe best general jazz chord-scale theory text I've seen (I've seen them all) is probably the Berklee book,   \n[Chord Scale Theory and Jazz Harmony](http://www.amazon.com/Chord-Scale-Theory-Jazz-Harmony/dp/B000M7B65O);   \nHowever, even better would be the Bert Ligon books, because they go into more detail about how to actually put it into practice:   \n[Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony](http://www.amazon.com/Connecting-Chords-Linear-Harmony-Jazz/dp/0793561930/ref=pd_sim_b_2)   \n[Jazz Theory Resources Volume 1](http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Theory-Resources-Volume-1/dp/0634038613/ref=pd_sim_b_2)   \n[Jazz Theory Resources Volume 2](http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Theory-Resources-Volume-2/dp/0634038621/ref=pd_sim_b_5)   \n[Comprehensive Technique for Jazz Musicians](http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Technique-Jazz-Musicians-Instruments/dp/0634001760/ref=pd_sim_b_10)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372708347", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To answer your question of how chord progressions work in different keys. It is cyclic but not in as straightforward a way as you suggest. As the video was about major ii V I progressions I suppose the first thing to look at is what is a major scale. A major scale is a series of notes following a specific configuration of intervals. \nTone tone semitone tone tone tone semitone. \n\nC major scale begins rather unsurprisingly with the note C. The note a tone above is D, a tone above this is E. A semitone above is F followed by G, the note a tone above F. This is followed by A, a tone above G followed by B again a tone. Finally the note a semitone above B is C. All major scales must follow this configuration, if they don't then they are not a major scale. Unfortunately it is only C major which comprises entirely of natural notes. For example beginning on D.\nA tone above D is E. A tone above E is F#. An semitone above this is G. A tone above G is A. A tone above this is B. A tone above this is C# and finally a semitone would take it back to D.\n\nD E F# G A B C# D. \n\nThis is why scales have sharps or flats in them, to maintain the formula tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone.\n\nHere they all are;\nC D E F G A B C\nG A B C D E F# G\nD E F# G A B C# D\nA B C# D E F# G# A\nE F# G# A B C# D# E\nB C# D# E F# G# A# B\nF# G# A# B C# D# E# F#\nC# D# E# F#G#A#B#C#\n\nF G A Bb C D E F\nBb C D Eb F G A Bb\nEb F G Ab Bb C D Eb\nAb Bb C Db Eb F G Ab\nDb Eb F Gb Ab Bb C Db\nGb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb\nCb Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb Cb\n\nChord ii is always minor or minor 7th, chord V is major or dominant 7th and chord I is major or major 7th.\n\nIn Eb for example a ii V I progression would be Fm7 Bb7 and Ebma7.\n\nMinor keys are slightly different but I'll save that one for when the video on minor ii V Is comes out in a couple of weeks.

{"body": "I am already very familiar with the document you provided. \n\nAll of the books containing photographs of nude/partially nude children were taken from a library of OVER 10,000 BOOKS. None of these books were sexual in nature. They are art books, and I will provide you with some information of these texts. (This first book was even in my old highschool's library)\n\nThe first, called “The Boy: A Photographic Essay”, was an art book depicting photos taken in 1963 during the shooting of the movie Lord of the Flies: http://lordoftheflies.org/img/kent.htm\n\nA second book, “Boys Will Be Boys”, contained the inscription: “To Michael: From your fan, Rhonda. Love XXXOOO ♥ Rhonda – 1983, Chicago.” There was no evidence that Michael had ever opened this book.\n\nPhotographs of the books found:\nDoes this look like porno to you?\nhttp://vindicatemj.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/adolescent-extremes.jpg \nhttp://vindicatemj.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/sydney-men.jpg\nhttp://vindicatemj.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/dave-nestler.jpg\nhttp://vindicatemj.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/the-gynoids.jpg\nhttp://vindicatemj.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/wilhelm-von-gloeden-taormina.jpg\n\nMind you, these art books are the best they could come up with out of a library of over 10,000 books. \n\nI know you don't like blogs, but there are summaries compiled from amazon reviews of each of the books found in Michael Jackson's house that were submitted as \"evidence\". They all seem to photography books, studying sexuality in general. Photos of nude men and women of course are contained within the books. The books containing children are not sexual in nature, and if they were, you could bet your last dollar he would have been convicted of possesion. \n\nhttp://vindicatemj.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/porn-found-in-michael-jacksons-home-2/\n\n**It is significant to mention that the mere possession of child pornography is a federal crime. Many states also have criminal statutes for the possession and distribution of child pornography. If the books had been pornographic in nature or substance, prosecution would have been inevitable.**\n\nNow, regarding child pornography. None was found in michael Jackson's home/s, hard drives, or any of his computers. **HAD CHILD PORNOGRAPHY BEEN FOUND IN MICHAEL JACKSON's POSSESION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND PUT IN JAIL FOR POSSESION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.**\n\n**I repeat it is illegal to be in the possesion of child erotica**\n\nWhen did I repeat any lines that the \"Jackson camp\" puts out? I quoted directly from court transcripts. I provided you audio evidence of the taped phone conversation. There are links to FBI files posted on this page. You are either delusional or incredibly stupid.\n\nThere are plenty of people who aren't michael jackson fans who believe and support his innocence. William Wagner, Geraldo Rivera, Aphrodite Jones, even Bill O'reilly.\n\nYou quoted directly from The Mirror, People Magazine and Wikipedia. I've quoted direct testimony.\nYou failed to provide any coherent argument, have not proven a single one of your claims, and haven't responded to all the evidence i provided you. Why? Because you have NOTHING TO ARGUE. I asked you many questions in my posts and you haven't answered any. You avoid questions you don't have an answer to, and move on to another topic. When that gets discredited, you move on to another one. Everyone here can see through your pathetic attempt to pin something, anything, on mj to make him seem even a little guilty. \n\nYou also seem to be ignoring the enormous amount of LEGAL HETEROSEXUAL PORN that was found in Michael Jackson's house, dating back to the early 80's.\n\nMichael’s home was raided in November 2003 after he had been absent from Neverland for 3 weeks. This is the complete list of the pornography found in his possession.\n(Taken from court documents)\n\n\n**1 E X H I B I T S**\n\n\n\n\n2 FOR IN\n\n\n\n\n3 PLAINTIFF’S NO. DESCRIPTION I.D.

{"body": "So, you have some options. You need to figure out what chords are shared between the keys. You usually don't want to use the dominant or tonic of one of the keys as the pivot chord (the chord where the modulation occurs), so your options are as follows - \nChords in G minor (g adim Bb c d/D eb F) and chords in D major (D e f# G A b c# dim). Okay, so the only overlapping chord is D major, which is the tonic of the key we are going to and the dominant of the key we are leaving. So, now you need an approach to this chord, which in g minor would be that a-flat diminished chord. So you could play a cadence in g minor - g D g - then modulate, here I'll use a circle of 5ths progression - g -c - F - Bb - Eb-  ab dim - D - then to solidify the modulation, a cadence in the new key - D - A - D. Other options, and maybe easier, are to use mode mixture - so using the chord from G major (G a b C D e f# dim) we now have some other options, including the major tonic, b minor, and e minor. Using the same procedure above you could go this route as well. So first you have to get out of the g minor tonality, maybe by cadencing g - D - G, and then using a circle of fifths to land on D...maybe something like G - D - e - a - D...then just continue on as if you were in the key of D.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372793331", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Pick one note, e.g. C. Learn that single note everywhere it occurs on the fretboard: you have two low C's 5 middle C's, 4 high C's (on a 22+ fret neck), 1 top C. Run through them on the fretboard for a few minutes each day until you can almost physically see it. When you have that, do the same with the 11 other notes. There's only 12 notes so it's a finite process, and you will be forever thankful that you did it now while starting out... there are hacks who have been playing for 10+ years who are still using positions and fret numbers to get around... but that's just not how it works: when you reach a pro level the fretboard really becomes one big position, and the shapes fade into the subconscious. Just learning the notes gets you there twice as fast.\n\nThe second thing is this: any chord, scale, arpeggio, lick, etc. play through it slowly, first saying the name of each note out loud, then saying the name of the interval/degree in relation to the root. Learning the notes is half of learning the fretboard, learning to see the interval relationship of every note in relation to any root note is the other half. This is very important because these are the *sounds*: the ultimate end goal of studying harmony/theory for an instrumentalist is to learn the sounds and learn how to find them... \n\nSo for an example, play a G barre chord at the third fret. Pick each note from bottom to top, saying the name of each note: G D G B D G. Then back down. Do it again, this time saying the intervals: root, perfect fifth, root, major third, perfect fifth, root. Then back down. Do this with everything you work on, and eventually you will see the logic of the tuning system, and begin to see the fretboard like a piano keyboard: just 12 different notes repeating linearly through 4 octaves.\n\nLastly, get started with relative pitch ear training. There are many methods, but any serious method revolves around singing. It's not about the voice, rather it's an active vs. passive thing: you want to be able to recognize anything you hear, and play it back instantly (passive), but also be able to produce the sound (either in your head or out loud), which means knowing what every note will sound like against every other before you play it (active). To put it another way, if you can't produce the sound, how can you say you really know it. This skill is what enables musicians to look at a page of music and hear it in their head, like you would while reading something written in English, or how a composer can compose directly on paper, or how Beethoven was able to continue writing after he went deaf, or how a master improviser plays phrases they've never played before when listening and interacting on the bandstand: Learn the sounds, learn where to find them. You can start by just singing along with every new thing that you learn: be able to sing any scale, arpeggio, etc. But don't overwhelm yourself at first, take baby steps. As long as you're aware of it now, you don't want 10 years to go by before you start putting the work in. David Lucas Burge has a great course for this.\n\nRemember that you're not learning to be a guitarist, but rather, a musician. The physical, technical part of learning guitar is the easy part, and anyone can give you advice on that aspect. Guitar probably has a higher technical learning curve at first than most instruments, but that becomes progressively easier through the years. Then you're left with fundamental musical skills that all musicians have to go through: understanding harmony and rhythm, developing your inner ear and internal clock (re: rhythm, see Hal Galper's videos and books).\n\n\nP.s. There's is probably more bullshit on the internet about learning music and guitar than anything else. Amateurs outnumber pro's a million to one, and many think they know more than they do... it's like the blind leading the blind in many cases. Of course there are great resources out there but you usually have to dig for it. So always seek second opinions, professional resources, and don't believe everything that you read.

{"body": "They are not the types of consumers as defined per the Feds, see below.\n\n\nhttp://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.pdf\n\nWhose buying habits does the CPI reflect?\n\nThe CPI reflects spending patterns for each of two population groups: All urban consumers and urban wage earners and clerical workers. The all-urban consumer group represents about 87 percent of the total U.S. population. It is based on the expenditures of almost all residents of urban or metropolitan areas, including professionals, the self-employed, the poor, the unemployed, and retired persons, as well as urban wage earners and clerical workers. Not included in the CPI are the spending patterns of persons living in rural nonmetropolitan areas, farm families, persons in the Armed Forces, and those in institutions, such as prisons and mental hospitals. The price-change experience of the all-urban consumer group is measured by two indexes, namely, the traditional Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consum-Q U E ST I O N S &amp; A N S W E R S ers (CPI-U) and the newer Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U). (See answer to Question 4 for an explanation of the differences between the CPI-U and C-CPI-U.)\n\nThe Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is based on the expenditures of households included in the CPI-U definition that also meet two requirements: More than one-half of the household’s income must come from clerical or wage occupations, and at least one of the household’s earners must have been employed for at least 37 weeks during the previous 12 months. The CPI-W’s population represents about 32 percent of the total U.S. population and is a subset, or part, of the CPI-U’s population.\n\nBesides - the lawn mower guy is already represented in the price of housing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372812956", "subreddit": "Economics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In relation to a root of A:  \nBb = Minor second (1 half-step)   \nB = Major second (1 whole step/2 half-steps)  \nB# = Augmented second (1 and a half steps/ or 3 half-steps, enharmonically C, the minor 3rd)    \nBbb = Diminished second (0 half-steps, enharmonically A, unison)\n\nOf course B# is enharmonically a C, which is a minor third from A. The way musical spellings work, is some kind of A to some kind of B is always some kind of second, some kind of A to some kind of C is always some kind of third (i.e. just count it: A is 1, B is 2 C is 3, etc.)\n\nWhat determines the specific interval quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) is the actual distance. To determine this, there's no need to memorize the amount of half-steps between them, rather, you memorize the key signatures, and the interval makeup the major scale and other modes. (p.s. you spelled the A major scale wrong: A major has three sharps: F# C# and G#, so it's: A B C# D E F# G# A). Now, the major scale is a root, major second, major third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, major sixth, major seventh. Because you know the notes in the scale, you know that A to B is a major second (because B is in the key of A, and it falls on the second degree of the scale, which is always a major second). Therefore, A to Bb would be a minor second (one half-step lower), and A to B# would be an Augmented second (in a chord/scale where the major third is already present, the minor third is treated as an augmented second). \n\nYou also know that A to C# is a major third, because you know that some A to some C is always some kind of third, you know that the key of A major has a C#, and you know that the major scale has a major third, therefore A to C# is a major third, and therefore A to C would be a minor third, A to Cb would be a diminished third (theoretically... you would never actually see it that way! Since it's enharmonically just a B, a major second. but that's just how the spelling works... likewise, A to C## would be a theoretical augmented third). \n\nFor the same reasons, you can figure out that A to D is a perfect 4th, therefore A to D# would be an augmented 4th, A to Db would (theoretically, but of course it's enharmonically major third, C#). A to E is a perfect fifth, so A to Eb is a diminished 5th, A to E# is an augmented 5th. A to F# is a major 6th, A to F is a minor 6th, A to F## is an augmented 6th. A to G# is a major 7th, A to G is a minor 7th, A to Gb is a diminished 7th.\n\nSo that's just how intervals work. Now, the Natural Minor scale is a root, major second, minor third, perfect 4th, perfect fifth, minor 6th, minor 7th. So with the above information you can figure out the notes work. Remember that any 7 note scale will have one of each letter name: some kind of A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. That's just how the system works. And by now you've probably figured out that any interval has different names depending on it's function, e.g. against an A root, the note F is called F when it functions as the sixth note in the scale, which is a minor 6th, but it's called E# when it functions as the fifth note in the scale: an augmented fifth (of course, this get's a little messy with scales with more or less than 7 notes, such as the dimininshed or whole tone scales but in those cases you preserve harmonic function... I can cover that later. Pentatonic scales don't count, because they're just subsets of the fuller major or minor scales, e.g. a minor pentatonic scale is just a minor scale that leaves out the 2nd and 6th, so you have root, minor third, perfect 4th, perfect 5th minor 7th). \n\nIt's important to think about any scale or chord in terms of it's intervals, because these are the *sounds*, and you can learn to recognize them. a C note doesn't have any specific musical sound, but a minor third sure does. \n\nSo any scale or chord should be learned in terms of it's interval construction. For example, Dorian is just a minor scale with a major sixth instead of a minor sixth. Phrygian is a minor scale with a minor second instead of a major second. So A natural minor (Aeolian) is A B C D E F G while A Dorian is A B C D E F# G, and A Phrygian is A Bb C D E F G, etc.\n\n*****\n\nAnother thing worth pointing out is that a *scale and a chord are the same thing*. Or in other words, a scale is the linear arrangement of the fully extended harmony. If you take the A minor scale, for example, you have A B C D E F G, i.e., root, major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, minor 6th, minor 7th.  If you stack the those notes in thirds (i.e. every other note), you get A C E... if we stop there, that's just a A minor triad: root, minor third, perfect 5th. If we add one more, going up in thirds we have A C E G: root, minor third, perfect fifth, minor 7th, an A minor 7th chord. \n\nIf we add a 5th note, we would have A C E G, then add another third by skipping the A and adding the B in the second octave: the A would be the eighth note (**oct**-ave), so the B in the next octave is the major 9th. In other words *a 9th and a 2nd are the same thing*, a ninth is just what a 2nd is called an octave higher. A C E G B would be a minor 7th chord with a major 9th: A minor 9th chord. If we add a 6th part to the harmony, from the B we would skip the C (the tenth, already present in the lower octave as the minor 3rd) and add the D: in the first octave it's called the perfect 11th, but here in the second octave it's called the perfect 11th. If we add one more note, we would have F, the minor 13th. One more, and we're back A, back where we started.\n\nSo in other words: an A natural minor scale is linearly A B C D E F G: root, maj 2nd, min 3rd, Perfect 4th, perfect 5th, min 6th, min 7th. Harmonically (stacked in thirds), spanning two octaves, we get A C E G B D F: root, min 3rd, perfect 5th, min 7th, maj 9th, perfect 11th, min 13th. So you can see that a scale and a fully extended chord are the same thing. I'm telling you all this, because often beginners ask questions like \"which scale do I play over xx chord?\", which is nonsensical. By definition of knowing a scale, you know any possible chord it goes with: any chord that contains some combination of those intervals. In most cases, where not all extensions of a chord are given, you look to it's place in the chord progression: e.g. the scale/chord I described above is the \"one\" or tonic chord in A minor, or the \"six\" chord in C major. (I'll stop here because this is a bigger topic than you asked for!)\n\n9ths, 11th, and 13th, are called compound intervals: an octave plus a second equals a 9th, and octave plus a 4th = an 11th, an octave plus a 6th equals a 13th. (specific interval quality obviously remains the same! major = major, minor = minor, etc.) They are basically synonyms for one another.\n\nIt's worth noting that, when speaking of intervals, you can talk about actual, physical distances between notes, or more often, speak of a note's function in a key. For example, C is the minor third of A, and you can call it the minor third no matter where it is, because that's its sound and function. But you can also talk about the exact interval between two notes: grab a C directly above an A note, and that's a space of a minor third, while C an octave higher than that A would be a tenth, while the C an octave higher would be... an octave plus a tenth (note that nobody uses any term for more than two octaves, it's just \"an octave plus\"!)\n\nAlso, you can grab a C note below an A note, and say that C is the minor third of the key or chord, however the actual distance between the two... is a major 6th. This brings me to the last point: *inversion*.\n\nInterval inversion is simple. A up to C is a minor third, while A down to C is a major sixth (remember, if C is \"one\", then D is two, E is three, etc. and A is six... so some C to some A is always some kind of sixth). So again, if A is our root note, C is the minor third, however if you grab those two notes, with C below the A, the distance between the two is a major 6th.\n\nThe simple way to understand inversion, is that 3rd and 6th are inversions of one another, while 2nd and 7ths are inversions of one another, and 4ths and 5ths are inversions of one another. The interval quality actually becomes opposite: major becomes minor, augmented becomes diminished, perfect remains perfect. For example, C up to D is a *major* second, while D up to C  is a *minor* 7th (or of course, you could say C down to D is a minor 7th, same thing). C up to F is a perfect 4th, while C down to F (or F up to C) is a perfect 5th. C up to G# is an augmented 4th, while C down to G# (or G# up to C) is a diminished 4th.\n\nConclusion: go to [musictheory.net](http://www.musictheory.net/), review the lessons, and use the flashcards for a few minutes per day to memorize the keys and key signatures (and the other exercises!). You should start developing a map in your head to be able to visualize the range/scale/overlap of the intervals. You should be practicing singing the different intervals, to learn the sounds: you want to get to the point where you can reach out and grab any random note, and sing any interval against it: this is a fully developed relative pitch.

{"body": "In relation to a root of A:  \nBb = Minor second (1 half-step)   \nB = Major second (1 whole step/2 half-steps)  \nB# = Augmented second (1 and a half steps/ or 3 half-steps, enharmonically C, the minor 3rd)    \nBbb = Diminished second (0 half-steps, enharmonically A, unison)\n\nOf course B# is enharmonically a C, which is a minor third from A. The way musical spellings work, is some kind of A to some kind of B is always some kind of second, some kind of A to some kind of C is always some kind of third (i.e. just count it: A is 1, B is 2 C is 3, etc.)\n\nWhat determines the specific interval quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) is the actual distance. To determine this, there's no need to memorize the amount of half-steps between them, rather, you memorize the key signatures, and the interval makeup the major scale and other modes. For example, A major has three sharps: F# C# and G#, so it's: A B C# D E F# G# A. Now, the major scale is a root, major second, major third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, major sixth, major seventh. Because you know the notes in the scale, you know that A to B is a major second (because B is in the key of A, and it falls on the second degree of the scale, which is always a major second). Therefore, A to Bb would be a minor second (one half-step lower), and A to B# would be an Augmented second (in a chord/scale where the major third is already present, the minor third is treated as an augmented second). \n\nYou also know that A to C# is a major third, because you know that some A to some C is always some kind of third, you know that the key of A major has a C#, and you know that the major scale has a major third, therefore A to C# is a major third, and therefore A to C would be a minor third, A to Cb would be a diminished third (theoretically... you would never actually see it that way! Since it's enharmonically just a B, a major second. but that's just how the spelling works... likewise, A to C## would be a theoretical augmented third). \n\nFor the same reasons, you can figure out that A to D is a perfect 4th, therefore A to D# would be an augmented 4th, A to Db would (theoretically, but of course it's enharmonically major third, C#). A to E is a perfect fifth, so A to Eb is a diminished 5th, A to E# is an augmented 5th. A to F# is a major 6th, A to F is a minor 6th, A to F## is an augmented 6th. A to G# is a major 7th, A to G is a minor 7th, A to Gb is a diminished 7th.\n\nSo that's just how intervals work. Now, the Natural Minor scale is a root, major second, minor third, perfect 4th, perfect fifth, minor 6th, minor 7th. So with the above information you can figure out the notes work. Remember that any 7 note scale will have one of each letter name: some kind of A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. That's just how the system works. And by now you've probably figured out that any interval has different names depending on it's function, e.g. against an A root, the note F is called F when it functions as the sixth note in the scale, which is a minor 6th, but it's called E# when it functions as the fifth note in the scale: an augmented fifth (of course, this get's a little messy with scales with more or less than 7 notes, such as the dimininshed or whole tone scales but in those cases you preserve harmonic function... I can cover that later. Pentatonic scales don't count, because they're just subsets of the fuller major or minor scales, e.g. a minor pentatonic scale is just a minor scale that leaves out the 2nd and 6th, so you have root, minor third, perfect 4th, perfect 5th minor 7th). \n\nIt's important to think about any scale or chord in terms of it's intervals, because these are the *sounds*, and you can learn to recognize them. a C note doesn't have any specific musical sound, but a minor third sure does. \n\nSo any scale or chord should be learned in terms of it's interval construction. For example, Dorian is just a minor scale with a major sixth instead of a minor sixth. Phrygian is a minor scale with a minor second instead of a major second. So A natural minor (Aeolian) is A B C D E F G while A Dorian is A B C D E F# G, and A Phrygian is A Bb C D E F G, etc.\n\n*****\n\nAnother thing worth pointing out is that a *scale and a chord are the same thing*. Or in other words, a scale is the linear arrangement of the fully extended harmony. If you take the A minor scale, for example, you have A B C D E F G, i.e., root, major 2nd, minor 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, minor 6th, minor 7th.  If you stack the those notes in thirds (i.e. every other note), you get A C E... if we stop there, that's just a A minor triad: root, minor third, perfect 5th. If we add one more, going up in thirds we have A C E G: root, minor third, perfect fifth, minor 7th, an A minor 7th chord. \n\nIf we add a 5th note, we would have A C E G, then add another third by skipping the A and adding the B in the second octave: the A would be the eighth note (**oct**-ave), so the B in the next octave is the major 9th. In other words *a 9th and a 2nd are the same thing*, a ninth is just what a 2nd is called an octave higher. A C E G B would be a minor 7th chord with a major 9th: A minor 9th chord. If we add a 6th part to the harmony, from the B we would skip the C (the tenth, already present in the lower octave as the minor 3rd) and add the D: in the first octave it's called the perfect 11th, but here in the second octave it's called the perfect 11th. If we add one more note, we would have F, the minor 13th. One more, and we're back A, back where we started.\n\nSo in other words: an A natural minor scale is linearly A B C D E F G: root, maj 2nd, min 3rd, Perfect 4th, perfect 5th, min 6th, min 7th. Harmonically (stacked in thirds), spanning two octaves, we get A C E G B D F: root, min 3rd, perfect 5th, min 7th, maj 9th, perfect 11th, min 13th. So you can see that a scale and a fully extended chord are the same thing. I'm telling you all this, because often beginners ask questions like \"which scale do I play over xx chord?\", which is nonsensical. By definition of knowing a scale, you know any possible chord it goes with: any chord that contains some combination of those intervals. In most cases, where not all extensions of a chord are given, you look to it's place in the chord progression: e.g. the scale/chord I described above is the \"one\" or tonic chord in A minor, or the \"six\" chord in C major. (I'll stop here because this is a bigger topic than you asked for!)\n\n9ths, 11th, and 13th, are called compound intervals: an octave plus a second equals a 9th, and octave plus a 4th = an 11th, an octave plus a 6th equals a 13th.

{"body": "1) First up, you need to learn all your **triads** (major + minor, and later diminished and augmented too) in all keys and all inversions, and in both hands. You need to get them so familiar that you find them without even having to think more than a few fractions of a second about it. (E.g. C major = C E G, 1st inversion = E G C, 2nd inversion = G C E. C minor = C Eb G, 1st inversion = Eb G C, etc, etc). This first step will take you a while, and it will be quite boring, but it will be worth it. Twenty minutes a day for a few months should get you up to speed. While practicing these chords and inversions with your right hand, play the root note of each chord with your left hand, and then try playing patterns using the root (R), third (3) and fifth (5) (root of C major = C, 3 = E, 5 = G, and these are the three notes of your triad). Play the chords in different rhythms, too. Experiment.\n\n2) Next up, when you're completely familiar with all your triads, and can play them around the circle of fifths (a way of moving from key to key that adds one accidental at a time - the order of sharps moves like so: C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# F C; and the order of flats moves like so: C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb B E A D G C), you can take the next step, which is adding the **seventh**. This means you go from your three note triad (R 3 5) to a four note chord (R 3 5 7). For major chords, the seventh can either be a major seventh (in C = C E G B) or it can be a flattened seventh (C E G Bb). The two chords have very different sounds, but both are very important. The flat 7th (or dominant seventh, as it is called in certain contexts) has a very bluesy / rocky sound, whilst the major seventh sounds much more harmonious. Anyways, you need to learn both, and in all inversions, for major and minor chords (the minor/major seventh combo may well sound very uncomfortable to your ears, but if you want to move into jazz, you'll need to learn it anyway. If you don't want to move into jazz, you can probably miss it out). \n\n3) Once you've got both steps 1 and 2 down, the notes of the keyboard should be pretty familiar to you, and your hands will be used to finding notes and chords without you having to think too hard about it. Good. Now you can move onto learning **scales**. The notes of a major triad  (R, 3, 5) derive from the major scale. Specifically, they are the first, third and fifth note of the scale. In C, the whole scale looks like this: \n\n    R 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    C D E F G A B \n\nIf you play all of these notes in order, you're playing the major scale of C. If you play only certain notes, you're playing a chord. You should learn the scale over two or three octaves (so repeating the whole pattern once you return to the R), using the correct fingering (google 'piano scale fingerings') and in both hands. Learn your major and minor scales (there are different types of minor scale - the melodic, the natural, and harmonic - google it when you come to learn them). \n\nSome scales don't use all of the notes available, or add extra notes, which gives them a very different sound. The most useful are the pentatonic and blues scales. They are as so:\n\n - Major pentatonic (useful for country, early jazz, or playing over any major chord):\n\n    R 2 3 5 6\n\n - Minor pentatonic (very useful for rock, but for jazz also)\n  \n    R 3 4 5 b7\n\n - Blues (useful for blues, rock and jazz, and basically a minor pentatonic with an extra note added)\n\n    R 3 4 5 #5 6 b7\n\nLearn all of these scales, for every key. \n\nAll of the above should probably keep you busy for a couple of years, especially if you let your curiosity lead you where it may whilst you're practicing. Obviously, don't just blindly play through inversions and scales - experiment, improvise, and see what sounds good. Listen very closely to what you play. Listen also to other pianists and keyboards and try to play little snippets of what they play. \n\nHope this helps. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372896562", "subreddit": "WhereDoIStart", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I feel that a lot of the fanbases of \"cult\" shows and movies tend to fall into the trap of feeling superior to people who don't watch or enjoy the show. I'm as guilty of that as the next Community fan, but I will hypocritically admit that that's kind of a terrible thing to do. That said, Community is a \"smart\" show. Community makes a lot of specific references that resonate with everyone in this fanbase and does so in a way that doesn't feel patronizing (arguably up until Season 4 but I won't get into that debate).\n\nThe reason we love the show and the reason it isn't a mainstream success are one and the same: this show is made for us, and there's not that many of us. I don't know who I really mean by \"us.\" I guess it's people who are  obsessed and knowledgeable enough about pop culture that having a bottle episode where a character says \"This is a bottle episode\" is exciting by itself.\n\nCommunity has a pretty amazing density of jokes, and it's totally possible to like it just as a sitcom about a community college the same way you can like Two and a Half Men as a sitcom about Two and a Half Men. But there's another level to it if you can get on the specific wavelength it's giving off. Especially with season two, watching each episode becomes *exciting*. Because it's so funny and so deep and you never have any idea where it's going to go, you're just glad it's there. You've been watching TV and movies all your life and reserving a ridiculous portion of your brain to remembering quotes and motifs and moments, and suddenly here's this show that not only rewards you for watching *it* carefully, but also for remembering things from everything else you've always taken in and loved. And it's Apollo 13 one week and M A S H the next, and even when you don't get a reference you're just excited that there are people like you that are making television and getting away with it. Not to mention wrapping it up in amazing jokes and the occasional heartfelt moment.\n\nYou just... You watch TV your whole life and love it, and then you watch Community and it feels like TV kinda loves you back.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372924089", "subreddit": "community", "score": 32, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Why wouldn't you learn scales? I admit this may not be 100% correct but it's the way that I view it. \n\nThe foundation of western music is a series of 12. The 12th tone is an octave, this means that it's frequency is twice that of the 1st tone. A scale is a pattern of notes derived from the 12 tones. The tones in the pattern are generally selected for their relationships to each other.  There are many many patterns with the most common being the Major and Minor scales. Those two scales are basis of most of the music you have probably heard. The Major and Minor scales patterns also lend themselves to chords which are built by (in general) taking 3 or 4 (in general) of every other note and playing them simultaneously. \n\nFor instance a the C Major scale: C D E F G A B C \nThe C Major chord: C E G\nThe F Major chord: F A C\n\nThe two scales and their derived chords have tons of theory around them about how the chords work in relation to each other. The theory is called diatonic theory. Learning this theory is an excellent way to understand your guitar and \"why\" the music you hear works. However it is not the end, there are lots of other scales and each of them have their own characteristic sound which you can use to flavor the music you create.\n\nOne other hugely important reason to understand this stuff is that it makes communicating with other musicians much easier.\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372947458", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Keep using the online tuner. It's good for you. Yes maybe you'll have trouble getting it in tune, but over time you'll get better at it. There are hacks playing for ten+ years that can't tune by ear.\n\nThis is an important part of developing your ears. Don't tune every string to a pitch on the tuner, tune one string to the tuner and then tune the instrument to itself. Look up the harmonic method of tuning, or you can use the 5th fret method. Eventually you will be able to tune the open strings to themselves just by the sound of a perfect 4th.\n\nThe technical issues are a big hurdle for beginners, but that goes away with time. If you're working chords and the strings aren't cleanly ringing, usually the fingers aren't arched enough, and moving the thumb down to middle of the neck (where it's supposed to be) will help. Yes, most guitarist leave their thumb hanging over top, but only where it's possible; when you're starting out and still have to think about hand position, this just isn't an option.\n\nJust make sure that every chord you work, (1) play each note individually to make sure it's clear, (2) say the names of each note with the correct enharmonic, (3) say the name of each interval in the chord in relation to the root.\n\nFor example, with an open G chord, play each note from bottom to top, making sure they ring clearly, and say out lound the name of each note: G B D G B (open 2nd string, or D 3rd fret) and G. Then do it again saying the intervals: Root, major third, perfect fifth, root, major third (open 2nd string, or perfect fifth 3rd fret) and root\n \nDevelop this habit **now**, So you can start getting your shit together from day one, otherwise you'll regret that you have to go back to ground zero years from now like an moron.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373041349", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Knowing a scale means:   \n\nThe interval construction in relation to the root, i.e. the major scale is a root major 2nd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, major 7th.   \n\nThe harmonic intervals, i.e. stacked in thirds over 2 octaves. This important for understanding modes, because a scale is just linear arrangement of a fully extended chord. E.g. the major scale is root, major 3rd, perfect 5th, major 7th, major 9th, perfect 11 major 13th. This is necessary to know any possible chords that correspond to the scale.  \n\nThe notes of the scale (with correct enharmonics) from all 12 keys. e.g. the C major scale is C D E F G A B. The E major scale is E F# G# A B C# D#.\n\nThe triads and 7th chords built off of each degree. E.g. the major scale is (I) major, (ii) minor, (iii) minor, (IV) major, (V) major, (vi) minor, (vii) diminished. As 7th chords, you have (I) major 7th, (ii) minor 7th, (iii) minor 7th, (IV) major 7th, (V) dominant 7th, (vi) minor 7th, (vii) minor 7 b5\n\nThe inter-relationship of the relative modes of the scale. E.g. the modes rooted on each degree of the major scale are (1) major scale or Ionian, (2) dorian, (3) phrygian, (4) lydian, (5) mixolydian, (6) natural minor or aeolian, (7) locrian. E.g. the relative modes of C major are D Dorian, E phrygian, F lydian, G mixolydian, A aeolian, B locrian. I said \"inter-relationship\" because you should be able to know that  e.g. E phrygian is the second mode of D Dorian. This is just equivalent to understanding what the fully extended chords on each degree are.\n\nBe able to play the scale across each single string, and in each of the 5, 7, or 12 positions (depending on which method you use), and more importantly, playing the triad and 7th chords built off of each degree, in each position. The triad, drop-2, and drop-3 inversions voicings. And of course, know the names of the notes and intervals. The arpeggios and inversions are important for playing chord changes; contrary to what many think, scales are actually derived from the harmony, rather than vice-versa. Melodically, there are always 12 notes available, the chord tones are the resolution points.\n\nBe able to play a random note and sing the scale up or down, and the arpeggio inversions.\n\nHint: if you know the major scale this thoroughly, any other scale is easy, and just an alteration. However, chord-scale theory and modal harmony is a supplement and extension of traditional, functional major and minor key tonal harmony: tonic, subdominant, and dominant areas and subs, cadences, tension and resolution points, etc. You should have this stuff first to avoid confusion: so start with a proper harmony text such as Aldwell's Harmony and Voice Leading, or Piston's Harmony. To learn more about the stuff I'm talking about, the Berklee text Chord-Scale Theory and Jazz Harmony is the best, also Bert Ligon's 4 books.\n\nJust for kicks here are all the possible scales (unless you start getting into mathematically subdividing the octave or whatever):\n\nThe 5 seven note scales, each of which have 7 modes:\n\nMajor/natural minor    \nMelodic \"jazz\" minor   \nHarmonic minor   \nHarmonic major\nDouble harmonic  \n\nThen the three symmetrical, one or two modes each:\n\nSymmetrical Diminished    \nSymmetrical Augmented   \nWhole tone\n\nThen of course there's the chromatic scale, if that counts. There are two pentatonic scales (with technically 5 modes each, but only two usually used in practice), however, these are subsets of and derivative of the full major/minor scales. These two are:\n\nMajor/minor pentatonic    \ndominant 7th/minor 6th pentatonic\n\nFor further reading, pick up Mick Goodrick's The Advancing Guitarist, and Hal Galper's Forward Motion and masterclass videos.

{"body": "Everyone has been commenting on how to play your class, but from my experience this is not the basics. \n\n1. Keybinds:\nIf you are still using the default keybinds for spells you should change them now. I rebind q e r f t y z x c and space. You can also use always keys with the shift modifer so you get double the keybinds. I also use 1-4. This allows you have quick access to many more spells and for me made the biggest difference in my ability to get out of the \"noob\" bracket. \n\n2. your class: \nNoxxic and what not are great for end game but can lack in terms of what to use for leveling. I could help you out more in deital if I knew what class/roll you were. Some basic tips are while waiting for queue pops or just in down time read over your spells. Memorize them and you will start using them more when the appropiate occasion rises. \n\n3. Addons:\nAddons can be great for a new player. Tidyplates will show you threat of mobs on the bar above mobs. Aswell as showing you important buffs that you have on the mob. Buff tracking addons are great aswell but are sometimes difficult to setup. \n\n4. A Guild:\nFind a social guild. Most of the time if you just sit in SW/Org you will get random invites to guilds and they are mostly social guilds. These guys will be more than willing to get you into a skype call and answer questions for hours, bc its social. \n\n5. WoW forums:\nThe WoW forums for your specific class is always filled with people who just leveled the same class as you and are willing to give helpful tips on how they leveled their toons up. \n\n6. Enjoy the game:\nHonestly as long as your having fun in the game, it is all that matters. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373072646", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Most common singing exercises are based on the major scale. There are minor ones but you can learn those later. \n\nWhen you sing scales and almost any exercise based on scales, though, you really need to know all of the scales, because you'll usually sing a scale (or part of one), then go up a half-step, and sing it again. \n\nThe major scale always has the same pattern of intervals in it: W(hole)-W-H(alf)-W-W-W-H, so:\n\nC major scale is C D E F G A B [C]\n\nC# major scale is C# D# E#(=F) F# G# A# B#(=C) [C#]\n\nD major scale is D E F# G A B C# [D]\n\nThere are many basic things about scales and how to find them that you should look into, but hopefully this gives you an idea of how to find them. I am sorry if I've confused you. Definitely check out /r/musictheory especially the FAQ in order to learn this sort of stuff; it's a great and knowledgeable community. Particularly look into the circle of fifths (it sounds unrelated right now but it makes learning scales much easier). After you have somehow begun to understand scales, you'll be able to do a lot of exercises that involve parts of it. If you'd like some suggestions for exercises, message me or post here again and I'll be happy to suggest some.

G7b9#9, without the G.  It's B D F Ab Bb, and it has the same function as the G7#9.

It could be a combination of fairly incompatible sonorities that come together for other reasons -- the melody note need not be part of the chord!  Is the context octatonic?

Next section, try using some really big intervals, like sevenths and ninths, so for example: C up to Bb, back to G, then down a seventh to A, up a sixth to F, down a fourth to C, then back to F, then down a second to Eb... that kind of thing.\n\nExperiment with rhythm - where does the bass line fall in the bar? Even a simple offset like this:\n\nBar 1, bass plays beats 1 &amp; 3.\n\nBar 2, bass lands on beats 1 &amp; 3 again.\n\nBar 3, bass lands on beats 2 &amp; 4 \n\nBar 4, bass lands on beat 3 only.\n\nWith a solid backbeat, that should sound pretty interesting.\n\nIn terms of matching the bassline to the chords, you could try something like this:\n\n\"Pedal\" basslines are where the bass line is static but the chords change, so try finding a four-chord progression that works over a single note bassline.\n\nThere are some classic bassline moves, like a descending bass line, something like:\n|| C   |  G/B  |  Am  |  C/G  |  D/F# |  D   |  Gsus  |  G    ||\n\nNotice in the descending bassline example how some bass notes are roots of the chords, some are thirds (G/B) and some are fifths of the chord (C/G). (If this isn't clear, when I say third, I mean the third measure of the scale related to that chord --- so: G major scale = G A B C D E F# G so third of that is B, hence: Gmajor chord/B bass...

The 2x4 spaces on either side are walls with room for wiring.\n\nSo long as you are certain you don't want to do any complex wiring within the walls themselves, you can certainly manage with 3-block-thick walls (1 space of air).  The problem with only 1 space of air is that you can't cross wires; for example, the following wire configuration (where this 3x3 diagram represents a 3x3 break in the wall for wires) is not possible with only 1 space (but it is possible with 2 spaces):\n\n    LV LV LV\n    LV HV LV\n    LV LV LV\n\nTo further expand on this, any layered configuration like this with `n` layers requires `n` depth (where depth is *space* behind the wall; wall 'thickness' must then be `n` + 2 blocks); this example has 2 layers and as such requires a depth of 2.  Keep in mind that a layer is *any* circuit, regardless of size - even if there's a thousand square meters of space in between your LV outputs, you can't have any HV outputs inside without a depth of 2.\n\nIt's also *much* more difficult to work within the wall if there's only 1 extra space, as you can only use one 2-dimensional view (you can move around a very small amount to try to see the 3rd dimension in question, but it's much more difficult than being able to use two 2-dimensional views).   It's also much more difficult to provide yourself passage through the wall, e.g. to re-route a wire.\n\nFinally, a 2-wide wall helps to better 'future-proof' your design.  For example, adding redstone energy conduits (for transporting MJ) will further restrict your machine layout (see LV/HV graph).  Even worse would be the addition of redstone logic; it's very difficult (sometimes impossible) to set up complicated logic circuits in a 1xNxM space.  Using a 2xNxM will make the task much easier, and allows you to thread EU or MJ transport through that area without having to redo or relocate the logic circuits.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373400833", "subreddit": "feedthebeast", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Embrace the 12-tone scale.\n\nWe like to think of scales as a limited set of pitches to draw from, and to some extent, that's right.  The C major scale, for example, contains the pitches C D E F G A B.  It also contains those pitches *in order*; in a passage, you would generally use those pitches in that order (or the reverse) to get from one pitch to another.  Many other scales exist, also based on C -- C phrygian, for example, is C Db Eb F G Ab Bb.  An interesting scale that is used quite frequently is the melodic minor scale, which is different ascending and descending: C D Eb F G A B C Bb Ab G F Eb D C.  A B C on the way up, C Bb Ab on the way down.\n\nThe melodic minor scale is a great example of chromaticism.  The diatonic scales contain 7 pitches, but the melodic minor scale contains 9, and you use some in some contexts and others in other contexts.  In particular, the b7 is used when a line is descending, but the 7 is used when the line is ascending.  Both b7 and 7 are present, as are both b6 and 6, but they have different functions.  The 12-tone scale has all 12 pitches -- which could be a lot more if you count different spellings -- and they all have different functions.  In the key of C, you'd use C for some things, Db for some, D for some, Eb for some, E for some, etc.  You might even use C# sometimes (as a leading tone to D, for example) and D# (as a leading tone to E).  This is not *atonal* -- we still have C as a pitch center -- but we're considering *all* notes in relation to C and not just a few.\n\nTo compose with these notes, we can free ourselves from the diatonic scale without making our music sound atonal.  We can use secondary scales temporarily -- for example, when there's a G major chord in C major, we can precede it with a D7 even though the F# isn't in C major -- and we can alter tones as necessary, like a Gb blue note resolving to F and Eb and C.  We can mix and match from all of the scales centered on C, or change to a different key center temporarily or permanently.  We can even use two flavors of a note at the same time, with care -- one of my favorite chords, in C minor, would be G B F Bb, where the B resolves up to C and the Bb resolves down to Ab and G.  We can use common tones and the like (or not) to simply use distant chords, like going from C major to E major.  We can even give up having a key center and move from one chord to another without concern for key, or even give up the semblance of harmony.

{"body": "If by \"look closely\" you mean cherry pick your examples than sure it's just the same group of people. There is a laundry list of things wrong with this game and are 100% legit to bitch about. \n\nFor starters I have T H R E E friends who can't stay connected to the game. It's not a net issue, they can log in but 80% of the time if you hit a load screen they're gone. Since this game forever has to load and loads forever, all three of those friends refuse to play anymore no matter how nicely I ask. These issues are most certainly because of the games absolutely disgusting performance. I have a recently built top end gaming machine with a modern video card and the game is installed on an SSD. I notice fast*er* load times but by no means fast. On other more demanding games like Skyrim I can't even read the load screen tips before they're gone. In this game I see issue bla bla bla is the first appearance of X!~ Then I could download that issue to my kindle and read it before that load screen is gone. \n\nItemization is crap. With no sets or legendary items to acquire the only thing most people care about is special item find. Constantly I'm having discussions with my Supergroup about how we toss out anything that doesn't have special item find even if it's a dps upgrade. \n\nI'm not going to bother listing the plethora of other \"never have anything positive to say about anything\" viewpoints but there are plenty. I think if they keep on this track the game can be much better, I still maintain optimism because I won't this game to succeed so badly, I'm just not blind to the writing on the wall. My friends refuse to play and I can't really blame them. The game was far from ready for release and they've done serious damage to their chances for this game to succeed by releasing anyway. I just hope the damage isn't insurmountable. \n\nAnd the MOBA isn't going to do a damn thing to bring this game back if they don't produce some miracles in balancing. Some moves will have to be completely removed or reworked for pvp to function in a way that would attract players instead of push them away.

When we add a ninth to this chord, thereby getting C E G B D, we have three choices: keep all five notes, take out E, or take out C. \n\nIf we keep all five notes, it's Cmaj9. \nIf we take out E, we get C G B D - or Cmaj9.\nIf we take out/exchange C, we get E G B D - or Em7. \n\nIt's through this process that we can build new seventh chords by adding an extension and replacing an existing chord tone. This can help musicians create interesting chord progressions. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373555972", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can call it either but the more common usage is add9. \n\nA chord's name doesn't usually specify the voicing in most cases, just the notes present, but this case is an exception.\n\nThe difference is that calling it add2 would specify that the 2nd is in the same octave as the root, meaning there is a cluster.\n\nAdd2 is rarely used though because it really only applies in a very limited circumstance. E.g., if you play piano and play a Cadd2 chord in your right hand, C-D-E-G that can accurately be described as Cadd2, the 2 is right there next to the C. \n\nNow play a root note an octave below with your left hand, now what chord are you playing? Add2 or add9?\nSo, in this case I'd call it Cadd9 unless you want to specify that the C and D be played right next to eachother.\n\n\n&gt;two other chords in the song are A C D G and F C D G\n\nA-C-D-G I'd call Am11, when you name a chord using a higher extension (9th, 11th, 13th) it's implied that the lower extensions are also present, though they're not always. Probably more strictly accurate to call it Am7(11) since there's no 9th but Am11 is fine. In terms of chord naming the 9th is not as important as the 7th, as long as the 7th is there it's ok to use Am11 and not have a 9th.\n\nF-C-D-G is F6/9 without a 3rd, I'd call it F6/9(omit3) or F6/9(no3rd) F6sus2 works but is not common at all.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373629207", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

But then \"sus\" might suggest adding the fourth, F\n\nsus2 doesn't *imply* there's no 3rd, it clearly *states* it. \n\nIf you just see a Csus symbol without defining a 2 or 4, most times that is shorthand for Csus4, since this is the more common sus chord.

{"body": "**Control VS Control**\n\nOh, my favorite matchup and probably the reason I play MTG. The terror of so many players and the boredom inducer of so many others. How can a match be fun when nobody does anything but play lands for 10 turns, and why is it sometimes wise to concede in response to a drownyard activation? Because it's all about information!\n\n**Reactions**\nIn general, the player to lose a control match is the first player to be forced to action. Each player is playing a deck intended to punish action and react with an unstoppable threat. Tapping low against open mana is giving control over to your opponent. They are allowed to stop your threat, react to it, or Sphinx for a million and then win the game whenever they feel like getting around to it. This isn't actually any different from a Control V Aggro matchup. C v A is simply defined by a flurry of minor threats being answered by a diverse set of answers whereas C v C is about resilient haymakers being answered by niche solutions. Also, augur standoffs, but I can't come up with a good comparison for those.\n\n**Actions**\nSo, if the first person to act gets punished how do you go about winning a C v C matchup? Instant speed card advantage, flash threats, threat dense hands, and never missing land drops.\n\n* ISCA - Think Twice is the king here (Sphinx is a threat). Think Twice lets you hit your land drops, power through your deck, and do something with your mana all without letting down counterspells. I'd rather see a Think Twice in my open or first Augur than a Sphinx unless I'm absolutely flooded in lands, and probably even then. These are also not *quite* important enough to counter, which makes them even better. Desolate Lighthouse is also pretty awesome here.\n\n* Flash - Snappy and Resto are the standard notables here and often win postboard C v C matchups in embarrassing ways. After an opponent has boarded out a bunch of spot removal EoT Resto can give them a heart attack. If they fight over it you get to slam Assemble/Jace/Aetherling on your turn. If they let it resolve you get to peck them low until they are forced to tap low to deal with it, and then you either protect it or do something better. Warleader's Helix makes this less appealing post-DGM, but T2 Ambush Snap or T4 Resto can still go the distance.\n\n* Threat Dense - I'd consider this 3+ must-counter threats and the land to cast them. Sometimes you have Aetherling, Aetherling, Thundermaw and no counter backup. In these situations you jam your threats Lowest impact --&gt; Highest impact and hope one of them sticks. This feels bad and sometimes they have all the answers, but you've got to play the cards that you're given.\n\n* Missing Land Drops - Draw enough land, and then tell your deck when you're good. Easy, right? Seriously though, the moment you draw your card for the turn and pass without putting a land into play you have become the underdog. If you stop at 5 lands and your opponent makes 6 &amp; 7 then they have gained end-game dominance and you are floundering. You can't control your deck, but you can avoid doing silly things. Mainphase your Think Twice // Azorious Charm if you need a land for that turn. Your opponent can't cast any cards that kill you until 5 mana anyway. Cast EoT Sphinx's for X=2 if you have to, because until you are pushing 8-10 mana sources you aren't safe.\n\n**Knowing what matters**\n\nThis is matchup specific, so I'll make it brief. \n\nCards that matter in your deck: AEtherling, Thundermaw Hellkite, Assemble the Legion, Jace (AoT or MA), Tamiyo, Sphinx's Revelation.\n\nCards that matter in their deck: AEtherling, Thragtusk, Sphinx's Revelation, Jace, Garruk, Alchemist's Refuge (not that you can do anything about it)\n\nCards that don't matter: Zegana, Geist of St Traft, their Tamiyos, Progen Mimic.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373854767", "subreddit": "spikes", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Mr. Shikaki said that result was the single highest support for an act of violence in his 15 years of polling here. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nOn negotiations between Ehud Olmert, prime minister of Israel, and Mr. Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, 75 percent said they were without benefit and should be terminated. Regarding the thousands of rockets that have been launched on Israeli towns like Sderot and Ashkelon, 64 percent support it.\"\n\nYeah, but Israel (not the government since you, earlier, stated ALLLLLLLLLL of Israel) that spends SOOO MUCH MONEY on defense really is these war-mongers.

Support for this attack increases in the Gaza Strip (91%) compared to the West Bank (79%).\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaz_HaRav_massacre\n\nFinally, findings show a significant increase in the level of support for armed attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel with 67% supportive and 31% opposed. Average support for such attacks on Israeli civilians stood at 40% in 2005 and 55% in 2006. Findings also show wide-spread support for the suicide attack that took place in the Israeli town Dimona and led to the death of one Israeli woman, with support standing at 77% and opposition at 19%. The armed attack on a religious school in West Jerusalem which led to the death of eight Israeli students is supported by 84% and opposed by 13%\n\n^^Total size of the sample is 1270 adults , 830 in the West Bank and 440 in the Gaza Strip, interviewed face to face in 127 randomly selected locations.

{"body": "I can recommend you a few things, speaking as a CS/EE double major :)\n\n* Hands on skills are quite important. Learn how to solder, use a DMM, strip wires, etc. There's a lot of tutorials on Youtube and such that show you how to solder well,etc. Watch them and practice.  \n\n* If you're still in school, you may want to consider taking a intro EE course as an elective or similar. If you're not in school but have the time and money, you may want to consider taking a few classes at a nearby college (ie. community college). Alternatively, get a few books/online tutorials and such and self study. I believe MIT OCW has a quite a few EE courses available. \n\n* Books wise, i recommend the following: [Beginning Arduino](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Arduino-Michael-McRoberts/dp/1430232404/), [Practical Electronics for Inventors](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Third-Scherz/dp/0071771336/), [Arduino Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Cookbook-Michael-Margolis/dp/1449313876/ref=pd_sim_b_7) (excellent refference book). Website wise, I recommend [t ro n i x s t u f f](http://tronixstuff.wordpress.com/tutorials/). \n\n* Start with the basics. This includes both theory (understanding and applying Ohm's Law) and practice (building actual circuits). Play with the Arduino and LEDs, motors, servo, ultrasonic sensors, etc. Follow tutorials for these BUT know WHY certain things are done in a given way and the reason those things are done. For example, understand why you need a resistor(s) when using LEDs. \n\n* Once you have the basics down (ie. how to hook up and drive a motor), start a small project. I personally recommend something like an obstacle avoiding or line following robot as it's quite cheap, lots of online help available, easy to understand, etc. Read my post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1gpaws/ideas_for_projects/camfojj) for more details. \n\n* Equipment wise, you'll need a few things. Take a look here: http://redd.it/1hoc03 You don't need everything on that list, but get the basics like resistors, capacitors, wires, general purpose PNP/NPN MOSFETs, etc. Then get a few sensors (ie. ultrasonic sensors, photo detectors, temperature sensor, etc) and a few other useful things like shift registers, LCD, piezo buzzer, etc. Also, check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/wiki/parts) from /r/electronics.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373932491", "subreddit": "arduino", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Right OK. So, before I start, I'll make a disclaimer that almost definitely someone is gonna come along with a Ph.D in modal theory and go OH ASNG NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S ONLY WHEN THE MOONS OF JUPITER ARE ON THE EAST HORIZON THAT IT'S CALLED THAT or some shit about flattened 6ths - fuck those guys with their useless degrees, it's all the same stuff.\n\nRight, ok. What is a mode? \n\nWell, I think of modes as just scales. I know the order of the modes. I know that Ionian is \"one\", dorian is \"two\", then phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, and locrian. I remember this by knowing that C ionian, D Dorian, E phrygian, F lydian, G mixolydian, A aeolian, and B locrian [which I learnt from parrot fashion] all have the same notes. I know these \"scales\" in position like I know the major and minor ones and with this knowledge I always know where the notes I'm playing in the scale are without having to learn the whole fretboard and memorize all the scale positions (which I absolutely should have done a long time ago.)\n\nSo, D dorian is exactly the same as C major?\n\nUrr... no. C major is C ionian and A minor is A aeolian, yes, but they're not the same really. They have the same notes in them but they have different starting notes which makes them technically different. So why are they different?\n\nWell, you know C major is like... it's C init? And then \"tone - tone - semitone - tone - tone - tone - semitone.\" So...\n\nC -tone- D -tone- E -semitone- F -tone- G -tone- A -tone- B -semitone- C\n\n.... but D dorian has the same notes starting on D: D E F G A B C. So it's tone semitone tnoe tone tone semitone tone. Do you know what I'm saying? The spaces between notes isn't even so the scale sounds different from just major/minor.\n\nSo, what I want you to do is go away and learn F lydian on the first fret, G mixolydian on the third, A Aeolian on the fifth, B Locrian on the seventh, - I hope you know C major! - D Dorian on the tenth and E Phrygian on the 12th. These are all the \"white note\" positions. So now, when you play a solo in A minor, you know where all the notes are!\n\nBUT ASNG, that's great and everything, but how do I actually use modes? What are modes for? \n\nThey're scales. You know when you're shreddig the shit and you're using harmonic minor, well sometimes you want it to sound \"phrygian\".\n\nWhat do you mean \"sound phrygian\"? Well... You know what the minor scale is like, right? Well, can you see how the phrygian scale is similar to it when you play it in position? Play E minor on the 12th fret, then play E phrygian. The notes that are different are the \"characteristic\" notes. These notes shape the sound. When something sounds \"sad\" it's because of a flattened 3rd. When something sounds \"phrygian\" its probably because of that flattened 2nd. You'll have to look up (or learn by comparing differences) the characteristics of each mode because I don't know the off the top of my head by name.. \n\nI can tell you that the dorian has a raised sixth relative to minor (or flattened third and seventh relative to major if you wanna be a cock). So it's like really... dorian sounding. (I tried to find a better word lol.) Have a play with the scale shape and think about landing and starting phrases on that note.\n\n[Here's a](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK4XTIY_R2s&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=209s) guitar solo in D dorian. Play it by itself ad hear how badly it wants to be resolved to C. When it's played with the backing... it sounds much better. \n\nWhy?\n\nWell, is G mixolydian a chord? No. Can you make chords out of G mixolydian that you couldn't make without knowing it? No. Do certain chords sound good with mixolydian shreds? Yes!!\n\nNow, if you have a mixolydian backing... and you play the C major shape and the A minor shape... it'll probably be kinda lame. Your fingers know A minor and C major and when you start and finish runs, you're doing it on A or C. You can, obviously, slow down your playing and listen to (and feel) the notes your playing and play a kick ass mixolydian solo on the fifth to 8th freth alone but it's way harder than on the 3rd to 7th because you need to learn mixolydian style licks.\n\nWhat are the chords that sound good with the notes?\n\nFuck me. No idea. Youtube it I guess. I know when I write my own stuff what is and isn't good but you'll need some bell end with 4 years of modal study to tel you that:\n\n* Major 7th Chords\n*  Ionian\n*  Lydian\n* \n* Minor 7th Chords\n*  Dorian\n*  Phrygian\n*  Aeolian\n* \n* 7th Chords\n*  Mixolydian\n* \n* Minor 7b5 Chords\n*  Locrian\n\n... or not. See what we're doing here? Major 7th chords can be made with the ionian and lydian scale. So F lydian and Fmaj7 sound pretty good together. It's just like Em and E minor scale sound good together... but the names aren't the same anymore. \n\nHas that help at all in any way?\n\nIf not. Check out David Walliman. He's the fucking bees knees.

From a Playboy interview with Stanley Kubrick.\n\nP L A Y B O Y: If life is so purposeless, do you feel that it’s worth living?\n\nK U B R I C K: Yes, for those of us who manage somehow to cope with our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces man to create his own meaning. Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre, their idealism--and their assumption of immortality. As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if he's reasonably strong--and lucky--he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life's élan. Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining. The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death--however mutable man may be able to make them--our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment.

{"body": "&gt;Yes, they seem to be quote mining the articles I cited (I originally thought they were addressed to someone else...my mistake!). I urge you to read the whole articles rather than nitpicking the parts out of context you don't like.\n\nI did read them, also I didn't dismiss them out of hand, simply because they are apologists websites. Some atheists do just that. Also they are direct quotes, quote mining would mean I quote them with the intent to have them mean something else. They are not convincing arguments, it's full of presupposition, which I cannot really blame them for that, they want to believe in Jesus, it is still intellectually dishonest to go into anything with a presupposition as strong as theirs.\n\n&gt;feel free to do further research.\n\nYou are incredibly lazy.

Still working on it. The Bible also tells us not to lust, hate or be jealous, all things we have to work on. I think you have 'Christians' mixed up with 'sinless beings' here.\n\nSo it'll never happen then? This is how it is read when you say that. Also, NO ONE EVER THINKS ANY HUMAN IS PERFECT. Clear enough, stop with the useless prattle, your persecution complex is showing. [Yes, your response was a result of the [persecution complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_complex) that has been shown to occur in the collective Christian mind. It's easier for this to develop if the person is Christian, and is aware of Christian history, or read the Bible, (which there weren't that many 'martyrs' in the first couple centuries of Christendom, don't get me wrong there were some, but not in the numbers that are typically described, and it was more of a prosecution, than a persecution.)]\n\n&gt;Please read the whole article.\n\nDid, Doesn't mean that that question isn't relevant, (or important for your neighbor).\n\n\n&gt;A good article came up about this recently.\n\nThis is interesting, thanks, seriously.

Relevance?\n\nVery important to you and ever non-Jew that claim to be Christian.\n\n&gt;In both cases, according to the God-given objective morality, murder would be wrong.\n\nRight, so why did they still do it? They, presumably, thought it better to baptize them, then just outright kill them. \n\n(Do you have a better understanding of 'ethics without God' now?)\n\n&gt;Still this seems irrelevant to the actual question that these articles answered. \n\nAm I correct in assuming you are referring to the Israelite comment? It would be pertinent, like I said above, what if you are not of the 'Chosen People'? Does it ever come across you mind that you might be wrong about which God you worship?  \n\n&gt;Same thing.\n\nOnly with the presupposition of a Christian. Most Jews didn't think so, then and now. You'd think that they'd know their own holy book, am I right?\n\n&gt;Not necessarily, but again irrelevant to discussion.\n\nHow so? It is perfectly relevant, look at my other post to you, as to why.\nThe TL:DR of it is, CONTEXT OF CULTURE IS IMPORTANT.\n\n&gt;Still irrelevant to the actual issue of morality...\n\nThey have everything to do with morality. Society dictates the direction of ethics. I will not repeat that again, especially when I gave you multiple peer-reviewed articles on the origins of ethics. You obviously didn't read them, you have, as of yet, to respond to that, admittedly, long block of text.\n \n&gt;The messianic prophecies are laced throughout the Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi. Here's a brief rundown...\n\nAnd redaction and interpolation doesn't come to mind at all. Biblical scholarship (and Study), show multiple authors with different agendas interpolating throughout the OT. Don't take my word for it, look it up. \n\n&gt;Yes. look up the trinity. Again, relevance?\n\nAnd this isn't a conundrum to you? (Why do I even ask...) This is an issue for a lot of people, i t  d o e s n ' t  m a k e  s e n s e!

{"body": "You need to be in absolutely the right frame of mind before and when you smoke. When you get to that certain level of highness where you freak out (I'm sure you know where it is), just let it happen. My trick is very specific but maybe it can help you. I have a very specific method. You could almost say it's a quick meditation of sorts.\n\nFirst, I take a deep breath. I envision myself inhaling the fresh, clean air and exhaling all the negativity, the stress, the bad vibrations in my body. I really try to feel the air entering and exiting my body, putting a lot of stress on the thought of inhaling good, exhaling bad. Then, this might sound weird, but I say little things to encourage myself like \"Aw yeah, I'm feeling it now!\" Or, \"Whoooo, this weed was *totally* worth the money!\" Last, I stretch really wide to loosen up my body, open myself up to the good vibes and really relax.\n\nSome things I try to do when I'm feeling a panic coming on:\n\n**Leave the room for a bit.** This is a tried and true method that people use when they're on psychedelics. An event border I think it's called? When you change scenery, your brain literally changes the scene, like in a movie. That's why when you recall an event, you remember where you were first. At least, I do.\n\n**Laugh.** Force yourself to laugh. If you're high enough to panic, you're high enough to laugh at yourself laughing. Use the power of imagination to conjure up a mental image of the funniest looking animal you can think of; like a pink, green polka dotted dog wearing a clown nose and a santa hat!\n\n**Both!** Change scenery, *in your miiiind, maaannn*. Picture yourself in the best place you could possibly be. In a field, by the lake, on a mountain, in your girlfriend, whatever! You are the king of your mind and it's important for you to remember this. The hierarchy goes soul, mind, body.\n\n**Listen to music** that brings back fond memories. Nostalgia is one of the happiest emotions we have, in my opinion. For me it's Daft Punk's track One More Time. Reminds me of last summer, chilling with my bros. The first time I got to a [10] was to that song.\n\nAnother tip I have is to **smoke S L O W L Y**. Take a small hit, wait 10 minutes. Take another small hit, wait 10 minutes. Repeat until high as fuck. Getting high gradually is a lot more fun than letting it all hit you in the face at once anyways. If you smoke joints, mix the weed with something else that's safe to smoke like dried peppermint or ground up chamomile flowers. Hit the joint less frequently, let it burn a bit in between tokes. It's not a race, it's a dance. \n\nThis probably all sounds like hippie crap but weed is hippie crap!

This is the fight that we find trickets over all, but thats mostly because we dont have alot of ranged (2) and we have no hunter so we use a warrior and shamans totem to slow the turtles. keep the turtles slowed and you should be fine, if you dont slow them it will cause major problems.\n\njikun, we got stuck for a bit longer than we should of because we over complicated this fight.   Have the non active tank soak the pools, they can use cooldowns for this.   Have 4 people go down on the first nest, have one dps drop off the nest after getting feather and let them be returned to top. they can then use the 4 charges to get the food buff. make it your top dps.  1 healer 2 dps with good cleave should handle nests. after about nest 9, just have the nest crew come up top and dps boss. have all 3 of them fly above jikun before feed young and they will get all the food buffs, so no big birds will drop crap on you. lust here and burn it. \n\nmag, we found g r g r b r b to be best, 3 greens gets very rough on the aoe damage. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374092152", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi there! Before I start my essay, please bear in mind that I am a gigantic fan of women's artistic gymmnastics only and while it shares a lot with men's, there are crucial differences but I don't have the knowledge to go into details about men's.\n\nDon't feel like it's abnormal to have things blur together. The first meet I ever saw was the Sydney Olympics (which nobody ever discusses because they were an utter disaster) and I thought the vault was a kind of long jump :/ Really it will just come with the more meets you watch. \n\n\n\n- Scores are calculated using the code of points. The code of points sets out all of the deuctions a judge can take and how much each element is worth. I'll explain this a bit better further on. The code of points changes every 4 years, in the year after the Olympics so we're now using a pretty new code. Scores are now calculated using an open-ended judging system. This means that the gymnast can add as much difficulty as she wants and her total score will go up accordingly. In the past, using the perfect 10 system, gymnasts who had more difficulty often scored lower than much easier vaults/tumbles etc. just because they could not stick the landing and things like that. The scoring system (since 2006) is composed of two scores. It still maintains the perfect 10. This is used for execution- how perfect does a gymnast do a skill. This varies for different events but a major one since it affects all 4 events is leg seperation. Knees wide apart on a tumble, legs wide apart as the gymnast hits the vaulting table etc. Things like going outside of the floor boundary area (stepping out, landing out are different deductions), not hitting the centre line on vault when landing, taking a step forward on a landing or hopping, crossing legs when twisting (The best example of this is in Aliya Mustafina's floor routine, but most gymnasts do it..some more subtle than others) and not hitting exact vertical handstands in a bars routine. This is a small selection only! Essentially, a gymnast must be precise and have pretty much perfect form to score high in execution. It can differ from meet to meet, USA meets tend to be more generous, internal Chinese meets are notoriously harsh.\n\nThe rest of the score is composed of the gymnast's difficulty, connection bonuses and the compositional requirements. Each skill- tumble, pirouette, leap etc. has a rating. These go from A-H. An example of A is a split leap. There are just two H elements at the moment. In a gymnast's routine (except vault, which is different) the top 8 skills are counted towards her difficulty score. A certain amount of these must be dance skills- leaps and turns. The rest are acro. I believe it's 5 acro and 3 dance for beam and floor but I'm not positive on that. Anyway, so the routine's top 8 could be F E D D D C C B etc. Which would be 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.2. So that's 2.8. We'll say this is floor and that the gymnast connected two skills together on two occasions, and got 0.2 for that so 3.0 Now comes the compositional requirements. For each one that the gymnast fulfills, she gets 0.5 and there's 5 so 2.5 They differ between beam, bars and floor a bit. Beam, bars and floor all require a full turn and a dismount rated at D or higher. So this gymnast got all 5 of hers and got 2.5 for that. We lump this together with the other two and call it difficulty or d-score. So her max scoring potential is 10 + 2.8 + 0.2 + 2.5 which is 15.5. \n\nAll deductions will be taken from her 10 and the score will be presented as say 14.1- 5.5 difficulty and therefore an execution score of 8.6. On vault the score is the same but there are no compositional requirements or connection bonus, just the vault difficulty itself. You WILL see messy difficult vaults outscore perfect easier ones every time. The vault that really won it for the US in Olympics team final last year was called the amanar and had a huge 6.5 difficulty (6.3 now). 3 girls performed it for the US and all 3 scores counted. Their top rivals couldn't match up and suffered accordingly. Russia had two, neither were great, and had their third vault out of 5.8 difficulty which means the US had an 0.7 lead straight away as vault was their first event.\n\nVault is the only event where the gymnast's difficulty is known before she begins. This is really to tell the judges what they should be expecting. Sometimes it does happen that a gymnast does not fully rotate her vault and it gets downgraded. In women's gymnastics the most common vaults are called yurchenkos. They are named for a Soviet gymnast, Natalia Yurchenko. The gymnast does a round-off (a bit like a cartwheel, but feet join together mid-air) onto the springboard and then reaches backwards for the vault table. In mid-air she will twist while also somersaulting. The amanar as mentioned is a 2.5 twisting yurchenko. The next vault down, a double, is the one worth 5.8. There are others where the gymnast launches directly onto the vault table or does a half-turn before doing so but they are not as common. If the gymnast falls she gets a 1.0 deduction. This is valid for the other 3 events too. Unfortunately, the downside to the open-ended scoring system means that if a gymnast has enough difficulty, she can still win even if she fell and none of her competitors did. This has occurred 4 times in major competition for women- worlds/Olympics where the gymnast medalled. Two of these were in vault finals, where the gymnast competes two vaults, which must be different. The scores are averaged and because of that, the fall is now worth an 0.5 penalty which is easier to overcome than if you just fall off beam.\n\n- Me personally, I look for great execution as well as exciting skills. Sometimes these are together but not that often! Toes pointed, legs and knees straight and together, gorgeous leaps etc. Gymnasts from places like Ukraine and China focus much more on this than the USA for one, who rely on monster difficulty and have gymnasts like Aly Raisman who has really crap form on basic skills. If you google 'aly raisman beam' you'll notice that her legs are all ovet the place and it just looks ugly. She's far from alone but has become the classic example. I also look for good floor choreography that is at least in time or relates to the theme of the music. It's very hard for the judges to judge the gymnast on dance, but it used to matter more than it does now. Many have to sacrifice beautiful movements etc. that aren't worth anything so that they can squash in more difficulty- as there is a time limit! Beam and floor must not go over 1:30. Bar routines are usually shorter still and of course, vault is the shortest.\n\n- I watch everything. I watch NCAA college gymnastics sometimes (this runs from about January-April) but I am in GMT and they start at 1-2am for me..so not that often. The Olympics and world championships are broadcast. National meets are often broadcast in the host country. Others are livestreamed- like University games recently, and the european championships. If there is no stream or anything then I rely on people who were there to upload routines to youtube. I watch all events..I'm not sure if I have a favourite though.\n\n- College wise, I LOVE Florida and UCLA. Stanford has gorgeous gymnastics also. On the elite scene I have favourites. Simone Biles of the US, Noemi Makra of Hungary, Mai Murakami (or a younger version moreso, she's sadly not as good now) of Japan, and loads more. I also really like a lot of juniors- Eythora Thorsdottir of the Netherlands, Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, Andreea Munteanu of Romania...etc. Juniors right now are girls born in 1998 and later. 2000 is the last year where they will still be elegible for Rio Olympics. I follow them because they have something special, either amazing skills, charisma on floor, exquisite form.\n\n- The college season as I said is Jan-April. They almost all compete every weekend. The top colleges for women are Florida, Alabama, Georgia, UCLA and Oklahoma at the moment. LSU are climbing up. The elite season varies a lot. There is generally a concentration of meets May-October. \n\nPlease feel free to ask me any other questions. I made a blog post directed at fans who love watching gymnastics at the Olympics but don't know what's going on. It's certainly outddated now since it was a year ago but you might find it helpful http://beautifulgymnastics.blogspot.ie/2012/07/are-you-4-year-fan-london-guide.html\n\nThere are SO many old (and recent!) meets on youtube. Not just Worlds and Olympics, but really small meets too. I really, really recommend checking out the old Soviets. They competed in the perfect 10 system and are much, much cleaner than 99% of today's gymnasts as a result. My favourites are Elena Mukhina, Tatiana Groshkova, Olga Mostepanova, Irina Baraksanova, Olga Strazheva, Olessia Dudnik and Oksana Omelianchik.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374101112", "subreddit": "Gymnastics", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "12-tone equal temperament, well temperament, meantone tuning, and pythagorean tuning are systems of tuning which have been dominant in Western music during different eras. Pythagorean tuning was invented earliest, and is based on a \"circle\" (more like a spiral as we'll see) of purely tuned fifths. Meantone tuning was invented later, and it **tempered** those fifths to produce purer thirds. Well temperament was designed to deal with the problem of **wolf fifths** without using more than 12 notes. 12-tone equal temperament can be seen as a further regularization of the well-temperament concept.\n\nBefore we start, let's clarify that tuning, in the sense used here, doesn't refer to physically adjusting the pitches an instrument produces. That is, it's not the process of turning a guitar's tuner to make it play the right notes. In this context tuning is choosing which notes to adjust your instrument to, or which notes to design your instrument to play. Which notes are the right ones? One approach is to tune your strings without any system, just using notes that sound good to you. But historically, Western music has used more systematic methods.\n\n\nPythagorean tuning, which was widely used until the beginning of the 16th century, is based on the idea of a stack of fifths. A stack of fifths is a set of notes where each is a fifth away from the last note added. For example, you can start at C, then go up a fifth to G, then D, then A. Start at Cbb and continue the process for a while and you get:\n\n...Ebb Bb Fb Cb Gb Db Ab Eb B F C G D A E B F# C# G# A# E# B# F##...\n\nWhy is this set of notes so large, when F# and Gb are the \"same\" note? They are only the same in more modern tunings, but not in Pythagorean tuning. In Pythagorean tuning, the well-known circle of fifths is more like a spiral. To visualize this, think of a clock face, with each hour being a semitone. In equal temperament, the fifth is 7 hours. If C is 12 o'clock, then G is 7 o'clock. D is 2 o'clock, and so on until you get back where you started. However, equal temperament's fifth is not tuned purely. A purely tuned fifth isn't 7 hours, a purely tuned fifth corresponds approximately to 7 hours, 1 minute, and 10 seconds.\n\n    | Note |     Time |\n    |------+----------|\n    | Gb   |  5:52:58 |\n    | Db   | 12:54:08 |\n    | Ab   |  7:55:18 |\n    | Eb   |  2:56:29 |\n    | Bb   |  9:57:39 |\n    | F    |  4:58:50 |\n    | C    | 12:00:00 |\n    | G    |  7:01:10 |\n    | D    |  2:02:21 |\n    | A    |  9:03:31 |\n    | E    |  4:04:42 |\n    | B    | 11:05:52 |\n    | F#   |  6:07:02 |\n\nLook, G# and F# are 15 minutes and 4 seconds different. If a semitone is 1 hour, that corresponds to a quarter of a semitone! As you can see, stacking pure fifths results in a scale with far more than 12 possible notes--keep on stacking and you get more notes. If you're mathematically inclined you can see that you'll never get back to an octave this way. An octave is the ratio 2/1, and fifth is 3/2. No matter how many times you multiply 3/2 with itself, it will never come back to 2/1.\n\nIf you're making an instrument, this may be a problem. You can't make an organ with an infinite number of notes per octave, after all. You have to pick a limited set of notes. But which to pick? In practice this isn't as big a problem as it seems; you just include the most common notes. The big problem with Pythagorean tuning is that the major thirds are very sharp of pure, and the minor thirds are very narrow.\n\n\nMeantone was invented to address that issue, and dominated for some 250 years, although it was used up until the 19th century. By stacking fifths in exactly the same way Pythagorean tuning does, but tuning them just a bit flatter than pure, the thirds become narrower and more in tune as well. This still produces an infinite number of notes, but they sound nicer for some styles of music. \"Just a bit flatter\" is vague, so there is more than one flavor of meantone tuning. The fifth can be flatted to taste.\n\nUsing either Pythagorean tuning or Meantone tuning you have to deal with the problem of wolf fifths. Since there's an unbounded number of notes in these tunings, it's possible that two notes can be close to a fifth apart (e.g. B and Gb), but still be too far apart to sound good together. B and F# are a pure perfect fifth apart, but if you were to have Gb and not F# on the keyboard, then a B chord couldn't be played in tune. The B to Gb fifth is a wolf fifth. Keyboard makers addressed this in various ways, such as splitting the black keys to include both notes, or allowing an organist to toggle that key between F# and Gb with a stop. Harpsichords could be retuned more easily depending on the notes needed.\n\n\nWell temperament was designed in turn to decrease the number of notes in the scale. Instead of using fifths of equal size, like meantone and Pythagorean tuning do, it assigns different sizes to the 12 fifths, so that when stacked they *do* equal an octave, they are all fairly playable, and the most common keys sound the nicest. This is a big advantage for the instrument maker, and can also be good for composers of chromatic music. Although they have fewer notes to work with, they don't need to worry about wandering \"off the keyboard\" where the notes which would be in tune don't have keys to play them, and they don't have to worry about distracting microtonal changes to a note.\n\n\nEqual temperament, surprisingly, is meantone tuning. Meantone uses a fifth tuned slightly flat of pure, and the fifth in equal temperament is tuned just flat enough that 12 of them equal an octave. Leaving the clock analogy, a perfect fifth is roughly 7.02 semitones, while an equal-tempered fifth is exactly 7 semitones. Equal temperament has purer thirds than Pythagorean tuning, although not as pure as meantone tuning, or as the white keys in well temperament. Equal temperament allows all keys to sound the same (unlike well temperament), while needing only a small number of notes to do it (unlike pythagorean and meantone tuning). Whether homogeneity is a good thing or a problem is a matter of taste.\n\n\nToday, research into temperaments focuses mostly on finding new harmonic resources. Many people have used an octave divided into more than 12 equal steps, or fewer. Others have put the ancient idea of just intonation into practice, writing music where not only are the fifths purely tuned, but so are the thirds, and so are ratios based on even higher parts of the harmonic series, leading to a combinatorial explosion of possible notes. Some, rather than dividing the octave into parts, divide the octave-and-a-fifth, with no pure octave at all. Some apply the idea behind meantone, of stacking an adjusted fifth, to other intervals, and produce temperaments where the relationships between notes are totally different, producing new chords progressions, and making common meantone progressions unplayable.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374162738", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

People will always argue that they can click and still do equally good to someone with keybindings, but honestly, using keybinds is just superior in every way: you can react faster, you won't have to keyboard-turn ( = you can move around/move from bad stuff faster), your fingers won't get tired from spamming clicks and your awareness will improve significantly!\n\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374179245", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The 12 notes of the modern chromatic scale evolved gradually through a process that's too complicated to explain fully here, but I'll attempt a summary. Other answers have explained the nice mathematical properties that 12-tone equal temperament has; I'll try to put those properties into historical context. [To simplify things, however, I will be using some anachronistic expressions -- sorry if this makes real historians of theory cringe. =/ ]\n\nMany (or most!) musical cultures **aren't** limited to 12 equally-spaced notes. This includes various forms of music practiced in the Middle East and South Asia (Arab maqams and Indian ragas), but also the music of Ancient Greece, which allowed for intervals smaller than our semitone. \n\nBy the time of the later Middle Ages in Europe, although some scholars still talked about the old Greek scales, it seems that the basic scale in use was the **diatonic scale** (i.e. the scale formed by the white keys of the keyboard), which was modeled by something called the \"Gamut\" or \"Guidonian Hand.\" Small differences in tuning were possible, but the following things were true about this scale:\n\n* Steps could come in two basic sizes: major or minor seconds (i.e. whole tones &amp; semitones). [Not all major seconds were tuned *exactly* the same, but they were much closer to each other than to the minor seconds.]\n\n* A complete octave could be filled out by using each letter name once: A B C D E F G A, leading to 7 different letters per octave. [By this point they *did* use the same letter names as us.]\n\n* The pattern of intervals formed by the scale was therefore WHWWHWW or some rotation of that pattern.\n\nOne complication in this system was that the letter B could take two forms: it could be B-natural (allowing you to use, e.g. A Aeolian or D Dorian) or B-flat (allowing A Phrygian or D Aeolian, for example). That is, the distance between A and \"B\" can be either a whole step (if you use \"hard B\" or what we call B natural) or a half step (if you use \"soft B\" or B-flat). This becomes a basis for an important extension to the gamut: the idea that you can alter the intervals around *any* note, not just A.\n\nFor example, normally the note below G is F, a whole step away. But if I want to, I can \"fake\" a note a *half*-step below G... thus inventing F#. Similarly, if I need it, I can fake a note a half-step above F, giving me G-flat. Those notes don't \"really\" exist, but since one of the notes is \"real\" (i.e. within the system) and I have a good definition for a half-step (usually a frequency ratio like 15:16), I know how to find the faked notes when I need them.\n\nSo, from a medieval perspective, there are a lot more than 12 notes. There are 8 real notes (C,D,E,F,G,A,B-flat,B-natural) and a whole bunch of faked notes (C#,D-flat,D#,E-flat,F#,G-flat,&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c). Importantly, notes like F# and G-flat don't sound exactly the same (since 16:15 above F isn't exactly the same pitch as 15:16 below G). But the distance between them is pretty small -- much smaller than the distance of a half-step. So when it comes to designing keyboards (or fretted instruments), the easiest thing to do is to use one key for anything that falls in between the \"real\" versions of F and G. It's not perfect, but it's a lot more convenient than having 17 or more keys per octave. (Incidentally, people did experiment with different keyboard layouts that could give you different tunings for F# and G-flat, but they weren't widely successful in the long run.) \n\nSo, we started with the 7 notes of the diatonic scale, but we've decided that every whole step can be divided in half. [Technically, it can be divided several ways, but we're saying that they're all approximately the same to simplify our keyboards.] That gives us 5 new notes (the black keys of the keyboard), so now we have 12 notes per octave. From this point, we get centuries of fighting about how *exactly* those 12 notes should be tuned (resulting in various forms of meantone, well-temperament, etc.), but the important point is that all of the semitones are *approximately* the same size. Eventually society at large decides to stop fighting about tuning and make those 12 notes *exactly* the same size, resulting in the modern use of 12-tone equal temperament.\n\nSo, from my perspective, the important points are these:\n\n* **Starting from the 7-note diatonic scale.** [Why did this happen? Hard to say exactly, but it's a popular scale across the world. This is probably the most important point of all; it's also the oldest.]\n* Recognizing that the diatonic scale has two different-sized steps, and that you can fit approximately two small steps into one large step.\n* Wanting to have a semitone above &amp; below every note, in case you need it.\n* Using fixed-pitch instruments (like keyboards, lutes, and guitars), where it's important to have a small number of notes per octave.\n\nTogether, those 4 points lead pretty directly to 12 notes per octave.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374352703", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Sorry for the rogue deck but it's been catching a bunch of people off-guard. It's really hard to play around/react to how this deck opens.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/N9oDHMT.jpg\n\nUWR Hexproof. :D\n\nStill working out the kinks but it's performing insanely well. Starting to grind dailies but the variance in the hexproof draw keeps on losing in the finals. Like 10 3-1's in the past week.\n\n                                         EDIT FOR PRIMER/DECKLIST EXPLANATION\n\nI've been meaning to type up a primer and this is a perfect reason to do so. I also shouldn't have posted a 'rogue' deck here in spikes without fully thinking about this first. My apologies to the subreddit. :) So anyways, here we go:\n\n\nPut 100 bant hexproof players in a room (oh god), sit them down and ask them all what is the number one thing that costs them the game. (Outside of the tendency of the deck to make you want to pull out your hair due to such high variance.) Almost 100% of them will say that wipes or pseudo-wipes is their bane. Now of course they can counter that come post-board (with a mediocre, reactive answer IMO, rootborn defenses.) Now this puts the hexproof deck in an awkward position, you can keep your 3 mana up when you expect a wipe next turn and fall behind when they just tempo you out instead or you can just pray they don't have it and put a bunch of auras on your dude. So let's do some thinking, what is a cheaper and overall better answer to wipes that also has 3 major uses and costs 1 less mana?\n\n* **Boros Charm**\n\nThat is the bread and butter, and there are FOUR mainbdeck. The obvious use is the indestructibility, add in the fact you have reach with 4 damage off the top and you replace the whole Silverblade Paladin gimmick with this simple 2 mana instant and you have a card that bant hexproof can only wish they had access to. Since we have that out of the way let's go through the deck card type by card type.\n\n\n\n*CREATURES*\n\n\n* **Judge's Familiar**\n\nAll hexproof decks need access to a one drop, you simply will fall way too far behind if you don't have one in a lot of match-ups, especially on the draw. If worse comes to worst and they have an aggressive opening you simply CANNOT wait to put auras on your turn 2 creature during your turn 3 while they throw their one drop, Burning Tree, and insert card here at you.\n\nThe thing that makes the judge special is that is EATS up removal. When people see you play an untapped shockland and take two to get this dude out they knee-jerk react and put way too much priority on it. I've had so many games where they kill the owl just to have me drop a fencing ace and all the auras I have during the turns after. Also the sac ability is extremely relevant in regards to anti-countermagic and anti-tempo. You will not believe how many people forget about this ability.\n\nAgainst a lot of decks you can get away with even putting your auras on him, not only does he have built in evasion but it's impossible not to be able to cast him on turn one because of the hybrid cost! When you look at all the one drops in standard in these colors this guy is leaps and bounds above the rest, and on top of that he actually fits into a 'hexproof/auras' deck rather well.\n\n\n* **Invisible Stalker/Fencing Ace**\n\nThe brothers-in-arms from hexproof decks past and present are at it again but with some new toys this time around (come the auras section you will see). They need no explanation. You play them as you would any hexproof deck. Play them safely and pay attention to how your opponent is playing. Invisible Stalker is the trusty 2 drop while if you are facing the right deck/don't mind taking risks you can drop the Fencing Ace on turn 2. Try to get a read on your opponent though, because I won't lie... dropping a fencing ace and trying to pants him up on turn 3 only to have him killed in response is always painful and quite hard to come back from. That's the nature of Fencing Ace though, if you can get him to stick he will win the game before turn 4 is over. He is just that good. He helps you learn risk/reward times 30,000.\n\n\n* **Geist of Saint Traft**\n\n[I'm just going to leave this here](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/160)\n\nSeriously, this dude makes me get goosebumps. How thrilling it is to play with him when he is the backbone in a deck and all the new auras he gets in this color shard makes me excited beyond compare. Playing with him is less straight-forward than you may think though. It's always hard to choose whether to sandbag your auras for him or go all in on a stalker/ace. How to use him is completely situational based on your opponent and what his opening is. \n\n\n\n*AURAS* (This is where the fun starts)\n\n\n* **Ethereal Armor/Furor of the Bitten**\n\nThe good old one mana for a HUGE upside cards (even when they are the only auras the cost/effect is insane) \n\nArmor is good on turn 3, armor is good on turn 13. Armor is always good. Whether it's adding +6/+6 and first strike or +1/+1 and first strike it is probably the aura you want to see in your opening hand above any other. The cost is so cheap and it works rather well with the other one drop aura. \n\nFuror of the Bitten? What in the hell is that card you ask. Well Mangus Khan this little gem is efficient and effective on every-single-one of your creatures. It makes Geist big enough where he doesn't give a fuck about anything (obviously don't put it on him if they have defensive smiters.. you get the drill) and it makes everyone else effective beaters. (There have been many games where I've turn one familiar'd and turn 2 Furor'd him and outraced my opponent easily.) The 'drawback' of having to attack every turn is mitigated by the fact that you're going to be either getting in unblockable/with evasion. Or you are going to be on a double striking body/beefy Geist minimum. Furor plays excellently with other auras and multiple furors with an ethereal armor are the biggest bang for your buck you are going to get in any hexproof deck hands down. Double striking 8/8 Fencing Aces swinging in on turn 3 is actually the norm as cool as that sounds. Turn 4 kills are more or less when this deck wins and it's because of the power of Furor a lot of times.\n\n* **Spectral Flight/Madcap Skills**\n\nNot much to say about Spectral, it's in every hexproof deck for a reason. Evasion and +2/+2 for one blue and one colorless is pretty hard to compete with. It lets Geist bust through ground pounders with the greatest of ease. Seriously, as a competitive magic player anyone of you will understand why this card works in this deck. :)\n\nNow, part of me wants to say Boros Charm is the reason I play this deck. That would be wrong though, the only thing more fun than Boros Charm and all of it's massive uses is my little friend that gives 3 power and an EXTREMELY relevant ability for just one red and one colorless.\n\nMadcap Skills my friends, this card is B O N K E R S on any of the creatures in this deck. In your head right now think about how it works with each creature, think about the power it adds and think about the pseudo-evasion it adds. It makes combat a nightmare for the opponents. Turn one Familiar into turn 2 Madcap Skills? Check. Turn 2 Fencing Ace into turn 3 Skills and Armor? Check. Turn 3 Geist into turn 4 double Madcap Skills? Check. Seriously, all of the auras in this deck mix and match soo well and the fact that big boomers are all TWO mana auras makes me giddy like a little girl on giddy little girl day. **We more speed/quickness/explosiveness and the ability to rebuild after something bad happens much easier/cheaper than Bant hexproof:** *advantage USA.*\n\nMadcap skills has won me so many games where they only have one creature. Oh you have a defensive Loxodon that is going to murder Mr. Traft if he attacks? Sorry sir maybe next time.. and bring a friend. :/ Oh you have a defensive Reckoner that would usually end Mr. Trafts day early? Nope, sorry brother. You need two creatures now to stop my one and do you think I'm lollygagging while you set up your defense? Nope. I'm actually putting spectral flight on Sir Geisty and now you need two flying creatures just to slow him down for a turn. Thank you, come again.\n\n* **Gift of Orzhova**\n\nLastly we have this little treat. This is our Unflinching Courage, this helps up clamber back into the game against any nuts draw from aggro. This is Geists BEST FRIEND. This card is relevant late game, early game and during ANY part in the game. If you can connect even once with this aura attached to any of your creatures you have bought yourself a turn at minimum to set up your master plan. The mana is perfect for this deck as well. Double white and a colorless is the easiest to cast life-gaining aura in standard and I will trade flying for trample and +1/+1 any day. This card in itself makes it so your Geist is the most efficient machine. At minimum you are hitting for 7 and gaining 3 back. Trust me your usually not just going to have a creature with this aura only. Most of the time we are looking at Spectral Flight, Armor and Orzhova on St. Traft. Yeah I'll swing for 12 and gain 8 life back, thank you.\n\n\n*LANDS* (Yes there is an extremely important land in this deck.)\n\n* **Slayer's Stronghold**\n\nSomething that hexproof has always had trouble against was matches where their opponents can deal with their threats and make the game drag out a long time (think both players have ten lands) Many decks can do this but whereas with Bant you will topdeck a creature and drop it only to have them deal with it before you can swing this strange little Avacyns 50 cent rare changes EVERYTHING. Now you can actually put use to your late game topdecks with the haste function. I've gotten so many control decks to less than 10 life and they turn the corner and are able to deal with all my threats. This is BAD for hexproof. With bant I feel powerless, every time I drop a creature they smack it down before I can untap. Now I can sandbag a few auras and wait for a creature and BOOM attack with a topdecked Geist with 2 auras on it because of haste. This has caught more decks off-guard than you can shake a stick at, and if I wasn't in the USA colors I couldn't even dream of winning with hexproof when it comes to topdeck wars.\n\n                                                SIDEBOARD/MATCH-UP/SUMMARY\n\nAh the board, where the boys become the men. Against a lot of decks you actually will do NO boarding because you can race just the same, but some decks do cause some trouble post-board. When needed though, the board is where I feel this deck outperforms Bant again.\n\n* **Nearhearth Pilgrim/Boros Reckoner/Gift of Orzhova**\n\nNothing tells the oppositions aggro deck you love them like this suite. Oh hey there Naya Blitz, R/G aggro, Jund aggro or any creature based matchup.. hope you don't mind if I attach my Pilgrim to an unblockable stalker with 3 power boosting auras on him. You got me down to 5 life while you are at 17? Pretty normal occurrence to be honest, don't fret though. Now watch as I gain ten life per turn and you can do **nothing about it.** It's tempting to suit up an Familiar or Fencing ace in this matchup but they ALWAYS have the spear. Keep that in mind. Play smart and tight and even on the draw it's pretty hard to lose if you get even one of your sideboard cards.\n\nWait, you're telling me that my hexproof deck has the mana base to support Reckoner? Oh well let's see how it works. Let me assure you, it works. Once again against any creature based deck I will happily slow my roll a turn or two to play my Reckoner instead of my Geist. Obviously if I am on the play and have an opportunity to slam a Geist and they don't have the 'nuts Blitz draw' I will still do so. \n\nLastly 2 more copies of Gift, I cannot tell you how often I have fallen to sub 5-10 life and this single card has pulled me out of the hole when Bants Unflinching Courage could not. The evasion is absolutely amazing and once again well worth the 1 power and trample.\n\n* **Tajic, Blade of the Legion/Cavern of Souls/Purify the Grave**\n\nOne thing any kind of hexproof has trouble with as mentioned before in the Slayers Stronghold section is when control decks/jund midrange decks turn the corner versus you. Slayers Stronghold can only do so much when they have a grip full of counterspells, board wipes, Revelations, Olivias, and other creature kill. This is where our secret weapon comes in. The 4 mana CMC of Big Daddy Tajic really is negligible when the game goes on long and when he hits the table there are only a few cards in standard that can interact with him the way your opponents want to. Naming human with Cavern always get my opponents scratching their head until they see him come down. He suits up and finishes the game shortly after. A caverned Tajic is a lot of decks worst nightmare and once he puts an aura or two on, the **indestructibility** really shines. I would almost prefer it over hexproof to be honest.\n\nThe Purifies are there to keep Snapcaster Mage/Aristocrats/reanimator decks honest. You don't even really need to side them in that often because we have VERY good match-up versus these decks already but constant flash-backed lingering souls can gunk up the board just enough to slow us down to the point where they can turn the corner themselves.\n\nThe board is fairly self-explanatory, the only thing that throws people off is Tajic at first, but he shores up a lot of weaknesses while also being in our slice of color pie. I see this card seeing a lot of standard play post rotation and I'm just hopping on the train ahead of time. Post board he has single-handedly taken so many games off of control decks by himself (with the help of caverns of course) and will continue to do so.\n\n                                                            QUESTION TIME\n\n**Do you ever have trouble with the mana base?**\n\nNo, I have played over 100 matches with this list and I can honestly say this is a strength over Bant, we can always cast our turn one Familiar and literally every step on the curve is covered from most of our lands. Topping out at three and having Gift of Orzhova be hybrid mana (let alone how easy it is to cast reckoner post board) really help this super strong mana base. The fact that most of power enchantments cost ONE colored mana and maybe one colorless really help this cause. The power level of madcap skills versus the casting cost/how easy it is to cast in this deck really really push it hard.\n\n**How does this deck mulligan?**\n\nVery well for the same reasons as above. The owl being hybrid mana absolutely helps tonnes and having so many cheap CMC enchantments makes even mulligans to 5 extremely doable. I'd say I mulligan 1 out of 7 games, compared to when I played Bant I had to mulligan what seemed like every other game.\n\n**Describe your match ups?**\n\nComing soon.\n\n**Do you choose this over bant because of the inevitability of surviving board wipes?**\n\nComing soon.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374356039", "subreddit": "spikes", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am terribly confused about what you are talking about here. \n\nLet me try to explain how I am understanding your post:\n\nFirst you set out what all the modes are - Using the notes from the C major scale and playing up one octave, starting on each note as the root gives you a different mode. For example, starting on the D note you have D E F G A B D, which is the D dorian mode. You mention that you can play that over the Dm scale. What I'm confused about is the difference between calling something D dorian and calling something C major. \n\nI always thought modes were to bring a different flavour to your playing (like all scales...). If you are just playing the mode that matches up with the scale you got your chord progression from, isn't it just silly to say you are playing in a different mode for every chord you play, though you are drawing from exactly the same pool of notes? \n\nI'm sorry, I'm just really confused... To explain further where I am coming from:\n\nIf you change the scale you are playing from as you move through the chords, does it not make more sense to only call it a \"new\" scale if you are using some DIFFERENT notes? For instance, lets say you are playing a progression of C, Dm, G, G which is a I ii V V progression in the key of C major. If you were to play D Aeolian over the Dm chord (which has some different notes than C major), but switch back to C major over all the other chords you're only switching scales twice, rather than calling it  C ionian, D Aeolian, G mixolydian then back to C ionian when the chord progression repeats.\n\n\nSo, to repeat the words of u/thejuraj: help.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374403743", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1st question: C major can refer to either the overall tonality of C major, or the C major triad (chord). D-dorian refers to the dorian scale that starts on D and not tonality or chord; although you could refer to a chord as one with a dorian sound (because of certain chord tensions or scale choice).  \n\n2nd Q: Well, yes and no. That's why I said C ionian *would work* over the chord progression in the example. However, learning fingerings of different modes makes it easier for the beginning guitarist to see the connections between scales and chord tones on the guitar and thus make the solo sound more like it makes sense with the current chord. Try playing the note C against those 4 chords and listen how it sounds different against each chord.   \nChanging modes is more important in songs that change keys in the solo form, or have chords that don't fit if you try to analyze them from a tonality view point. For example, consecutive 7th chords: F7 Ab7 G7 F#7. If you play the correlating mixolydian scale over each dominant chord you should sound just fine. Playing F-mixo over everything would yield many \"wrong notes.\" I put that in quotes because they would be wrong notes according to theory, but if it sounds good to you, then that's your choice. A good example for this is SRV's song Lenny - there's a bunch of consecutive maj7 chords in the progression, yet he uses one minor pentatonic scale to solo over everything. It sounded good to him so he used it, but is theoretically speaking wrong.  \n\n3rd Q: Try to think of scales and chords as the same thing, but you're looking at the notes from a different perspective. You build chords by stacking thirds on a root. So if you keep going after C E G (C major triad) you get C E G B D F A which are the notes from the C ionian scale, but in different order. So you call it a new scale because it is connected to it's chord. Yes, technically those are the same notes as G-mixo or whichever other C major mode, but what changes are how chord tones function. The note C is the root in a C triad, a 7th in Dm, a b6 in Em a 5th in F, 11th (or sus4) in G, b3 in Am, b9 in Bdim.  \n\n4th Q: Although any music school would probably tell you *not* to play that aeolian on the Dm (as it is 2nd scale degree and should be dorian), it's up to you if it sounds good to you.  \n\nI am explaining the very basics of how chords and scales work. Later when you master this, you go on and learn ways to bend and break these rules, but it's essential to know your basics and understand how everything works.  \n\nI hope this helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374406839", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm going to try and answer your questions in an even simpler and clearer way - if only because it does me a lot of good to try. I'm sorry if this seems long, but try and stay with me.\n\n*To use a scale I have to play notes that follow the pattern of such scale, while also fitting into the song's chord progression( Not getting that part very well either)?*\n\nRight. Let's start simple:\n\nLet's say the chord progression you're playing over is just a C and an F chord.\n\nThe C chord consists of a C, E and G. \nThe F chord consists of an F, A and C.\n(Some of the notes might appear more than once in your chord. That's doesn't change anything, and is completely normal. We just need to know the unique notes in each of those chords.)\n\n(This is where studying comes in - being able to 'take apart' chords quickly and figure out what's in them. When someone plays an F chord, it's not just the F note that matters when figuring out what scale to play... all the other notes that make up that chord are equally as important. I'm guessing from your question that this might be the part that's giving you the trouble, but I may be wrong. Feel free to correct me if that's the case).\n\nOkay, so looking at that C and F chord progression, if we take all those notes in those chords for a moment and put them in a sequence to make a scale, we get:\n\nC E F G A\n\nThese notes are the 'critical' ones for the moment, because when we are playing they will be the ones that sound 'right' over the chords being played in the background.\n\nNow, a scale normally has seven unique notes, so this is a little basic at the moment. All the notes will sound 'right', but what we will want to do from this point is figure out what seven-note scales contain the five notes we've found in the chords.\n\nHere's a couple of examples:\n\nF Major - F G A Bb C D E F\n(Because F major is an option, D minor also works, because it has the same notes with a different starting point - D E F G A Bb C D)\n\nC Major - C D E F G A B C\n(Because C major is an option, A minor also works, because it has the same notes with a different starting point - A B C D E F G A)\n\nNow, if I've managed to get you to read this far, and you've stopped to look at the two options listed above, you might be asking \"*Why does one scale have a B in it, and the other have a Bb (B flat)? Won't one of them sound wrong?*\".\n\nThe answer is that either of those notes will be okay, because neither of the chords in the chord progression tell us which B we have to use. So, we can choose the one we want to use to create the mood we want.\n\nNow we go to the tape. :)\n\nI've recorded a basic loop of a C and F chord progression, and played each of the scales over it so you can hear the difference (and indicated which one I'm playing). From there, I've left the loop running so that you could try and experiment on your own.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/brandon-mcpherson/choosing-scales-for-a-chord\n\nEDIT: Removed unnecessary stuff, and attempted to clarify further.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374427419", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah OS X is so well thought out, that only recently they added way to merge folders. And you still can't set DPI. Plus many many things that OS X lacks, like for example a volume mixer where I can control app sound volumes independently.\n\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=352057\n\nHere are some choice quotes for you\n\n&gt;Guess I'll just have to stick with the windows 7 install on bootcamp until apple decides that people without 20/10 eyesight are worthy customers.\n\n\n\n&gt;Well, this sucks.\n&gt;I made the switch from windows with my first mac this weekend and as someone with poor eyesight, this issue is a killer for me. On the 27\" imac I bought the OS fonts are TINY! It's almost unusable. It's a shame because I really like everything so far. If I can't find a solution I may have to just install windows 7 on this thing. I'm going to keep it either way though because I like the format and the big screen is super sweet. \n\n\n&gt;I just bought 17\" Mac Book Pro and have had to change to to 1600X.... STRETCHED, just to be able to login in.... It is SO SMALL, @ 56 my eyes do not adjust well. NEVER had this problem on Windows 7 as I could adjust size...\nBut this not too bad, little blur, but I got the machine for photo editing, not posting on forums... can always use my Windows machine for typing...\n\n\n&gt;I have just boughted a Mac Mini 2010 2.4 ghz. It is for use with my television which is 1080p. I can watch the videos from it, looks very nice! But font size is impossible! Way to small to read! Even with my glasses on cannot read it from couch or chairs!! Have to walk up to the television and sit there to read any words. Very useless and annoying!!\n\n\n&gt;I \"switched\" about 3 months ago from PC to Mac. About 1 month ago, I loaded Windows 7 in Bootcamp only because of the small fonts. I have been switching back and forth between the operating systems lately. When I'm on the Mac side, I can't stand the small fonts. Windows lets me change the fonts size and the percentage size of everything in the OS.\nNow, I am using Windows 7 exclusively. So, I guess I double-switched. If Apple every allows modification to the system wide font size and theme, I will triple-switch back to Mac...but only after they allow users to set their own viewing experience.\n\n\n&gt;I recently took the plunge and bought a 27\" iMac and I have to say - I'm a little shocked that there is no way to set the font size system wide. Never really noticed this as an issue on my 13\" MacBook which I mostly use for web browsing -- but it's glaringly apparent on the 27\" display that the fonts are too small in a lot of cases. I have trouble believing that Apple hasn't noticed this.\n\n\n&gt;I have had the same experience and I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of system font scaling in OS X. The menu text size on my new 13\" Macbook is way too small and I have no way to increase it without getting fuzzy. On my Toshiba laptop with Vista/Ubuntu dual boot, I can customize the screen layout in both operating systems for sharp readable fonts. I plan to install Ubuntu on the Macbook and use it as my primary operating system until Apple fixes this problem.\n\n\n&gt;I am using parallels with Windows 7 running and can set the resolution etc with no problems including setting the font size for everything running... If I can do it there I should be able to do it in the MacOS..\n\n\n&gt;I may install Windows 7 until the Mac dies and then ditch the entire Mac thing in the future. \n\n\n&gt;I just purchased the 27 inch iMac. I have great eyesight and i find myself going cross eyed on this thing!! I'm blown away that I cant adjust the fonts system wide.\nWE NEED A DPI SETTING LIKE IN WINDOWS!!\n\n\n&gt;I just purchased a new 27\" iMac and this is ridiculous! I have to lean into the H U G E screen just to see the tiny tiny fonts in the address bar and top grey bar! There has to be a fix without control zoom or command +, or changing the resolution because I did not purchase a mac with his res so that I would not be able to use it! This was an easy fix in windows with hi-res screens-why not OSX??? \n\n\n&gt; simply can not believe that setting global fonts and custom DPI settings are not possible in Mac OS. I have been doing that with ease on Windows for over 10 years. I really want to get to know OS X because I have every belief that it's a fantastic OS... but if I can't use the computer for more than 10 minutes without massive eye strain and a headache.. how useful will it be?\n\n\n&gt;So, I spend over 2 grand on this thing and I can't read half the stuff on it and can't increase the font size across the board - only for some things, and individually. As far as I'm concerned, there is no point in having a computer, however good it is, if you can't read the screen. Nought out of ten, Apple. \n\n&gt;I have been increasing the UI font size in Windows for like 10 years. Will i have to wait a year, 2 years or more for apple to make my nearly $2000 investment work for me? annoying!!! \n\n&gt;It's unthinkable to me, that in 2012 the world's \"most advanced os\" does not have some way to customize fonts, ANY way, across apps and make them larger and more legible. \n\n\n&gt;Windows on the other has that for a long time and it works pretty well the user defined dpi settings for fonts, with the exception of itunes where apple hasn't bothered to abide by windows standards in their UI. \n\n&gt;I´m writing from argentina, ´ve been trying to change font size on the menu bar for hours. Mac over here cost twice as much as in the US over here is worth 3 of my full salaries. So I saved $ for 6 months to buy it and now I have a really hard time reading the menu font.\nReally guys, after all this years about Mac this and Mac that, It freaking sucks.\nCool pad, cool keyboard, cool screen. Crap, crap, crap.\n\n\n\n&gt;I would suggest you return your external screen or install windows on your mac if that's a viable option for you. The situation with font customisation in os x is a sordid mess and apple hardly have any excuse for it anymore.\n\n&gt;I was about to make the leap from PC to iMac yesterday but the salesman in the Apple Store did not know how to increase the system font. Luckily I came home to do further research before buying, though I had assumed that some tweak must exist for such large screen options. Do you think it is worth risking buying an iMac on the rumour of 3 size choices to come, ie will this be an upgrade for existing operating systems or would it only be available on future machines with a yet to be released operating system? Is there any way of confirming the rumour? I currently use a Logitech mouse (on PC/XP) with excellent zoom features, but from reading the manufacturer's web page FAQs I'm not sure it will work with iMac. If they come back to me to confirm it does then I will let everyone know of this workaround option. \n\n\n&gt;I am really unhappy with the 13\" 2012 macbook air. Everything is tiny on this screen. It is just impossible to work with the iwork. I would like to know how they feel when they ship this bad quality softwares. I think I'll return this crap as soon as possible and tell everyone I know to stay away from macbook airs. I'll better buy a Samsung series 9 with windows professional. If you did not decide yet what to buy, do yourself a favor and do not buy a macbook air 13\".\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374446151", "subreddit": "windowsphone", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Ok I think I got this.\n\n\nWhen you play piano, playing all the white keys (if you start at c) produces the sounds for \"do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do\".\n\n\nWhen a piano player wants \"do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do\" starting with ANOTHER NOTE (not c) this is totally possible. This would be called the eg:\"G Major\" scale. But there are going to be some black notes this time around!\n\n\nNow things get kind of interesting. It turns out that for each major scale starting on a different letter, there's a unique combination of piano keys that give you that major scale. So by counting the white ones and black ones, the piano player can tell with 100% accuracy WHICH is the \"do\" of the \"do-re-mi\" that is currently being played. This is referred to as \"number of sharps\". I know that G major has \"1 sharp\".\n\n\nThe circle of fifths is actually a pattern that can be used to figure out how many sharps (or flats, but these are all black keys) is in each \"do-re-mi\" scale as you change the starting note.\n\n\nIt works like this: if i take the 5th note of the C scale, i can add \"1 sharp\" to the scale. because G is 5th of C, we can tell for sure its got 1 sharp. lets test this out... G A B C D E F# G. If you play these notes on a guitar there are no \"Black keys\" so you may struggle to see how this all works at first, but in time you will understand which frets are actually exactly the same sound as the black keys on a piano, therefore sharp/flat. Now htere's something that relates to your context of improvisation, imagine seeing invisible information about the frets rather than just the fret itself as you are soloing!\n\n\nIt's important to note that soloing is a process of using notes that \"sound good with\" music. so for example if someone tells you \"the chord im using is Gmajor\" you can safely use all the notes from the G Major scale mentioned above.\n\n\nNow what if they told you its Dmajor instead? shock. Well luckily we know that D is 5 away from G. so therefore using the rules we established you know that Dmajor is a scale with 2 sharps in it! lets test it: D E F# G A B C# D\n\n\nSo again, to how this all applies, it's not 100% necessary to know which notes are which because often using a guitar you can learn a pattern/shape and just reposition it 1 fret forward/backward. For a piano player this is much harder because the gaps between the notes arent all 1 fret! \n\n\nThis is a part of the reason why the Guitar is considered a good improvisation instrument, because of the shapes thing. But as you become more advanced and understand \"oh its time for Amajor now!\" you may recognise its 5 away from D, and therefore we can probably play a c# note in there. C on the other hand would sound a bit off.\n\n\nGood luck, hope this helped!\n\nedit: got some notes wrong cos i cant count.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374446478", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

The idea is based on the relationship between common major chord and major scale shapes. It is also a very useful method for visualising chord tones across the neck of the guitar. If you can easily find the notes on the fifth and sixth strings of the guitar then all it takes is a bit of practice with the CAGED system and you will be able to find any major chord tone very easily anywhere on the neck. There are two main things you need to learn. The first is the order of the chords always remains in the same sequence C A G E D starting from the C or if you were starting from the G then the order would be G E D C A because after the D chord it starts over again from the C.

{"body": "He's actually wrong. A secondary dominant is much more specific than just \"Any chord following the circle!\"\n\nIf you're going counter-clockwise then they MIGHT be secondary dominants. It depends on the key you're in.\n\nDominants are always major. There's a regular (or primary) dominant in every key that resolves counter-clockwise in the line. For instance, G is the dominant of C and C is counter-clockwise from G. \"Awesome! Wait, this song here is in C. What's D major doing here then? It has an F# in it and we're in C! That's not supposed to happen.\" Well, that's a secondary dominant! Even though it's not in the key signature, we're \"borrowing\" the F# sharp from our friendly neighboring key G major and using it spice up our otherwise bland, diatonic (i.e. everything fitting in the key signature) garbage. So, for this D major to resolve \"properly\" it needs to have G major afterward, which coincidentally goes to C! There, now we have a nice cadence with a little flair in it! Basically, in every key there are some chords that aren't major (D minor, E minor, and A minor in the key of C major) that can be made major to give a little oomph to the song. Usually, these secondary dominants are followed by the next chord clock-wise in the circle, but they don't have to be. It sounds great if you do but do whatever sounds cool to you.\n\nAlso, pro-tip: the circle of fifths is actually a line.

{"body": "Well I wasn't necessarily the one having the sex, but I was most definitely a teenager.\n\nI'm 16, studying in my room at around 11:30 pm.  Everything's going great.  Then, I hear my dad, in the guest room which is adjacent to mine, turn on some Corinne Bailey Rae.\n\n\"Okay,\" I think, \"whatever.\"  You see, instead of sleeping in the master bedroom on the other side of the house, my dad usually slept in that room.  My mom had snoring issues, and whenever he need a good sleep, that's where he went.\n\nAround 15 minutes later (the guest room's door is closed), my mother skips down the hallway in what can only be called a negligee, she knocks on his door, and goes in the room.\n\nAt this point, I'm still studying, not really paying them too much attention.  \n\nThen I hear giggling.\n\nAnd then kissing.\n\nAnd then everything else.  \n\nSo I'm sitting at my desk, my bedroom door open, and I hear them really going at it with an expression of which I can only guess was pure horror on my face.  I furiously start texting my best friend that my life is over, because believe me, I heard e v e r y t h i n g.\n\nShe tells me to put headphones on, start blasting music, anything, but I was actually paralyzed.  So I just sat there for 20 minutes, in full traumatization mode.\n\nAfter that, my dad walks out of the room, just wearing a pair of shorts, stretches, sighs, and says \"Your mom gave me a message.\"  Then she walks out, grinning from ear to ear, and goes back to her own room.\n\nWhy didn't they do it in the master bedroom, you ask? I have no fucking clue.

{"body": "I'll try my best.\n\nSo the offence is broken down into eligible players (allowed to catch a pass) and ineligible players (not allowed to catch a pass). Typically the 5 offensive linemen are ineligible and everybody else is eligible.\n\nThe rule for deciding who's eligible is to look at the players on the line of scrimmage. The players who line up on the line of scrimmage at the time the ball is snapped are special. Usually it looks like this:\n\nWR t g c g t WR\n\n(I'm using the notation that CAPITAL LETTERS are eligible and small letters are ineligible)\n\nSo usually you have two receivers eligible on the line eligible and the 5 offensive linemen ineligible. What the rule says is that you need (at least) 7 players on the line of the scrimmage. The two ends (the two players closest to the respective sideline, the two \"bookends\", if you prefer) *must* be eligible and everybody else on the line of scrimmage *must* be ineligible.\n\nSometimes you see tight end formations:\n\nTE t g c g t WR\n\nOr even a double tight end formation:\n\nTE t g c g t TE\n\nBut it's all the same thing. The two ends are eligible and the 5 interior linemen are ineligible.\n\nWhat made Saskatchewan's formation interesting was that it looks like this:\n\nTE t t g c g T\n\nThey're following the rules (which made it a legal formation): 7 players on the line, two ends eligible, 5 interior linemen ineligible. What made it weird was that the tackle on one side was forced to be eligible. He wasn't \"covered\" by an end on his side which meant he *had* to be eligible. On the other side of the line you had 2 tight ends and one of them had to be ineligible, but that's okay.\n\nWhen I officiated minor league, I once saw a formation like this:\n\nC g t t t t WR\n\nThe centre was eligible! It's possible but very very strange. As long they have 7 players on the line and everybody's wearing the right number, it's possible.\n\nA couple extra notes:\n\n- There are eligible numbers and ineligible numbers (the numbers on your jersey) and they have to match your position. If you're starting in an eligible position and you're wearing an ineligible number, that's a penalty (and vice versa). That's why the tackle in this case was wearing #77, a very strange number for an offensive lineman. Because he was an eligible receiver, he had to wear an eligible number (or, alternatively, declare himself to the referee before the play)\n- You are allowed to have more than 7 players on the line of scrimmage but you almost never want to. If more than 7 players are on the line of scrimmage, only the two ends are eligible and everybody else is ineligible (in effect everybody else becomes a lineman). This is why you'll see (you can see it on this Saskatchewan play, too) some players very deliberately lining up a yard back from the line of scrimmage: they don't want to be considered part of the interior line.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374486097", "subreddit": "CanadianFootballRules", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some theories in physics predict mathematically extra dimensions. (Nineteen is the most I've ever heard.) These dimensions, if observed or proven absent, would help scientists determine which of the proposed theories is/are correct. As for the properties of the dimensions, there are two obvious possibilities. Either they will be space dimensions or time dimensions (other things may be possible but are unknown to me and very complicated). A space dimension would let object pass through it to get around. An analogy to illustrate this is a works before aviation. The vertical dimension is not understood because it cannot be accessed by the people. The new dimension let's people travel through it if they can work out how. The extra space dimension would work similarly for us if we could work out its use. It might be even better for travel because some theories (string theory primarily) predict that the extra dimension would be small. That means each point in the extra dimension would connect to many points in the obvious ones. Therefore, we could go from a to ai (point a in extra dimension) to g instead of going a b c d e f g. The extra time dimension would be similar but more difficult to access (we don't control our passage through time) and more difficult for many (including me) to understand. \n\nDoes this make sense?

You are going to be out there for ~ 6 hours so this gets into serious stress on your body.  \n\nIf you are going to go for it, use it as a training day and don't worry about your time.  You will be out there for 6+ hours (if you plan on going less than 6, I am not sure why you are asking the question) do what you can on the swim, easy easy on the bike and slow it down on the run.  Slow and steady wins - with your lack of training, you are going to be entering new territory for your body.\n\nAbove all listen to your body - know the difference between this hurts and sucks compared to 'I'm in distress.'\n\nFor training between now and then, I would swim twice a week (you only have to get through the swim); bike three times a week and run three times a week.  Once of those days I would have a bike/run brick (my favorite posted at the end of this).  Then longer bike rides for the other two, and for the runs, one l o n g run a week with a shorter faster run for the third run.\n\nYou have under four weeks, and you have to give yourself a slow week beforehand to taper.  If you can't punish yourself with the above suggestion, I would drop down to the Olympic.  Not worth the suffering and possible injury.  Come back when you can enjoy the race and your hard work to get there.\n\nBike/run brick\nSet up your bike on a trainer at the track (or in your garage with a 1 mile route mapped out).  Bring along a clock with a second hand and set it in front of the bike.  Set up a transition to the run directly off the bike.  Start with a 10 minute warm-up on the bike with a few pick-ups.  Then transition to running and run 1 mile at 90% effort.  (That's your warm-up.)  Get back on the bike, and do 10 intervals of 30 seconds all out, 30 seconds recover.  Skip the 10th \"off\" and immediately transition to the run.  Run 1 mile at 5K pace.  Repeat the bike / run twice more.  (from Kevin's Killer Duathlon Workout)\n\nThe above is a short - dump of some things to think about.

I don't see how this would be useful, though.\n\nThe pentatonic scale is mostly a melodic scale, meaning that you make melodies out of it.  It has its own unique little sound, since it has those jumps from 3 to 5 and from 6 to 1.  There are many other pentatonic scales which also have their own sounds, some of which are just the modes of the major pentatonic.  From C, those modes are:\n\nC D E G A\nC D F G Bb\nC Eb F Ab Bb\nC D F G A\nC Eb F G Bb\n\nThe first one is the major pentatonic, and the last is the minor pentatonic; of the modes of the pentatonic scale, those are the only ones that have a complete tonic triad.  However, if you emphasize the tonic enough, the other scales can work too.  The second is one of my favorites, and if you don't spend much time on the F, the C and G make a cool third-less sound.\n\nHowever, one of the main features of the pentatonic scale is that it's ambiguous, and except in major or minor modes, it's unstable.  You'll end up doing some weird out-of-key stuff with them, and that makes it *awesome*.

I am an explainer. Now with that out of the way, let me explain some things...\n\n&gt; This political climate- WHEN PEOPLE ARE POLLED, actually supports single payer. HOWEVER, there are thousands perhaps of blogging SOCK PUPPETS who are trying to convince politicians that people don't want it when in fact they do.\n\nAnd the sock pockets are part of our political climate. Next?\n\n&gt; Except MILLIONS of people AREN'T \"paying currently\", they are GOING UNINSURED because they CANNOT AFFORD IT.\n\nAnd Obamacare now extends Medicaid to many of those individuals while giving subsidies to those near-poverty. That means they'll be able to afford it.\n\n&gt; So,presumably the Bronze plans are still cheaper. Are they available to everybody - even those who make more than 4xFPL? \n\nYes. If they make more than 4xFPL, though, they won't receive subsidies and will have to pay the monthly premium in full.\n\n&gt; What I am saying is, suppose somebody is self employed, single and one year they make less than, but the next year they make more than 4xFPL.\nOnce they make over 4 times the poverty line, can they buy this insurance even thoug their income- I would gather, makes it so they cannot use the exchanges, right?\n\nThe IRS receives people's incomes, and they would presumably notice that Joe Schmoe is suddenly making over four times the poverty line. If they were just below it before hand, they likely weren't receiving too big a subsidy in the first place. So it would only mean paying a bit more in taxes the following year (or receiving less of a refund, in some cases). Since Joe Schmoe knows his income and taxes aren't due until April 15th, he'll have time to save up the money. If for some reason that doesn't work, he'll probably be able to sort out a payment plan with the IRS, as they do in similar cases of people not paying taxes. This actually happened to my Dad a few years ago (his income fluctuates year to year, which is how I know all this...I looked up Obamacare info for him).\n\n&gt; So, even though there you just admitted right there that your parents could not have afforded to pay $1500 a month for any length of time \n\nSorry, but where did I say that? I said they are paying a lot more than $1500 a month right now. I said **they are paying it**. So, clearly, they can afford it.\n\n&gt; you say that wasting eight years on THIS UNAFFORDABLE MISTAKE WRITTEN BY HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES TO CONTINUE PADDING THEIR POCKETBOOKS AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY is \"an improvement and a start\"?\n\nIt is an improvement because my parents will be paying yes. So yes, it is an improvement and a start.\n\n&gt; What if I told you \n\nOkay Morpheus...\n\n&gt;  that the game would soon be over, for Americams, that Obamacare was and is a sneaky trap\n\nBecause we are capable of changing laws in this country, I would say you are wrong.\n\n&gt;  thatits being finagled to LOCK AMERICA INTO A FOR PROFIT INSURANCE MODEL FOREVER WHETHER WE COULD AFFORD IT OR NOT BY TRIGGERING THE WTO \"GATS\" (FREE TRADE) AGREEMENT'S \"INVESTOR-STATE\" PROVISIONS?\n\nIf there is a coherent sentence in there, I'm not seeing it.\n\n&gt;  unable to EVER switch to single payer even if we dumped Obama, the Democrats, the Republicans and every other single politician in Washington \n\nLike I said, we can change laws if we decide we don't like them.

OTOH the health insurance market is the largest in the world. **These \"investor-state\" dispute resolution fines are meant to be SO huge that countries will not, can not ever consider withdrawing a market once a multinational (like Serco who will be managing Obamacare) has \"invested in developing\" them. The penalties are based on potential market size, not actual size**\n\n**They are designed to completely bypass \"unpredictable\" local laws, elections, politicians.**\n\nRead this: http://www.citizen.org/documents/PresidentialWTOreport.pdf  On Page 10 it describes a situation much like the present one.

N O T H I N G !!! They are two completely different industries. NAFTA has nothing to do with single payer healthcare.\"*\n\nAfter Ontario was a signatory of NAFTA, (which bans new public services- monopolies - claiming they are trade barriers-) the government of Ontario proposed a single payer auto insurance for Ontario which would have meant that several US multinational firms who had a presence in Ontario would have had to leave, the US threatened to bring suit under investor-state provisions in NAFTA asking for massive compensation based on the size of the potential market. *At that point Ontario realized they were NOW powerless to make their own domestic policy on auto insurance BECAUSE OF NAFTA*- They gave up the idea.\n\nCanada's health insurance was started BEFORE NAFTA and the WTO, thats important, so they were grandfathered in.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374623617", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Italics offset English words and “” quotation marks offset specific words and phrases for discussion.\nVowels are as in Italian, Spanish or Jamaican English.\n&lt;a e i o u y&gt; /a e i~j o u i~j/\n&lt;p t c(a/o/u) cu(a/o/u) qu(e/i) qü(e/i) x&gt; /p t k(a/o/u) kw(a/o/u) k(e/i) ke(e/i) kw(e/i) ks/\n&lt;b d g(a/o/u) g(e/i) gu(e/i) gü(e/i)&gt; /b d g(a/o/u) dZ(e/i) g(e/i) gw(e/i)/\n&lt;m n l r c(e/i) h f v s z(a/o/u) j(a/o/u) ch&gt; /m n l r ts(e/i) Ø f v s ts(a/o/u) dZ(a/o/u) k(e/i) tS&gt;\nStress is on the final closed syllable i.e. the vowel just before the last consonant in a word; otherwise, the stress is marked with an acute accent e.g. citá. Vowels in hiatus do not dipthongize strongly; if possible, sequences of the same vowel occuring across morphemes are distinguished by length, assimilated, or separated by an epenthetic [h] or [ʔ]. Assimilative and even intervocalic voicing may occur with /s/, though this is the exception.\nPronunciation is  flexible to an extent i.e. &lt;e&gt; /e/ [e~E] and (probably) &lt;r&gt; /r/ [r~ɾ]. Using an English &lt;r&gt; [ɹ] will probably sound to alien to most, as it is very rare in Romance, or otherwise, languages (occuring in archaic Genoese Ligurian and rural Brazilian Portugese). A uvular consonant as in French or German will also sound parochial (although this sound has gained traction in several German language varieties.)\nNote: Mondial's orthography maintains several historical patterns but is consistent with a potentially simpler phonemic rendering, i.e. &lt;z&gt; /ts/ &lt;c&gt; /k/ &lt;g&gt; /g/ &lt;j&gt; /dZ/ etc. however, the alternating pattern that is used here allows for greater recognition of vocabulary and is similar to the patterns extant in Romance languages e.g. Italian and Spanish.\n\nChapter 1\nCategory 1\nIt is easy to gain a fast working vocabulary in Mondial. Many words in the language are similar or identical to words in English, French and Spanish. Many scientific words are of Latin derivation which you will recognize. There are several categories by word structure. See if you can guess the meanings of the words listed. Note: 'the' always translates &lt;le&gt; and 'a(n)' always translates &lt;un&gt;. (Generally their usage is almost exactly analogous to that in English, meaning that where one appears in one language it probably appears in the other.)\n*le actor\n\n*le doctor\n\n*un tractor\n\n*interior\n\n*le color\n\n*le eror\n\n*un profesor\n\n*exterior\n\n*le conductor\n\n*le favor\n\n*un inventor\n\n*superior\n\nNote: These words are stressed on the last syllable because of the location of the final consonant.\n\nCategory 2\nAnother category of words ends in &lt;al&gt;. Usually these are the same between the two languages.\n\n*le animal\n\n*central\n\n*local\n\n*personal\n\n*le criminal\n\n*comercial\n\n*musical\n\n*rural\n\n*le canal\n\n*legal\n\n*natural\n\n*social\n\nNote: These words are stressed on the last syllable because of the location of the final consonant.\n\nCategory 3\nThese words end in &lt;ble&gt;. Note the difference in pronunciation from English.\n\n*le cable\n\n*posible\n\n*formidable\n\n*noble\n\n*notable\n\n*flexible\n\n*probable\n\n*horible\n\n*terible\n\n*visible\n\n*honorable\n\n*inevitable\n\nCategory 4\nThe fourth large category is English words that end in &lt;ic&gt; which generally becomes &lt;ique&gt;. Note that occasionally these words function solely as adjectives (a), and have a substantive or noun (n) derived from them e.g. publique&gt;publico, symbolique&gt;symbolica, statistique&gt;statistica, tactique&gt;tactica; in these cases, the adjectivial form may correspond to an English adjective ending in &lt;ical&gt; and the derived form corresponds to an English noun ending in &lt;ic&gt; e.g. tactique ~ tactical(a), tactica ~ tactic(n). Sometimes it goes the other way and there are two English words that are used in almost the same way that both end in &lt;ical&gt; and &lt;ic&gt; but translate to only one word in Mondial e.g. electrical, electric ~ electrique.\n\n*le atlantique\n\n*democtratique\n\n*elastique\n\n*le publico (n)\n\n*publique (a)\n\n*artistique\n\n*electrique\n\n*statistique (a)\n\n*romantique\n\n*aristocratique\n\n*automatique\n\n*statistica (n)\n\n\nCategory 5\nAnother category is made from English words that end in &lt;ent&gt; and &lt;ant&gt;. Often these words only require the addition of &lt;e&gt; to the end. Note certain clusters are simplified further in Mondial than in English e.g. exelente ~ excellent.\n\n*le presidente\n\n*exelente\n\n*conveniente\n\n*le acidente\n\n*importante\n\n*elefante\n\n*le cliente\n\n*diferente\n\n*inteligente\n\n\nIt's simple to make sentences from these words. Practice now with them, remembering that: \n“e” means “is”, “non e” means “is not” or “isn't”, “le” means “the” and “un” means “a” or “an”.\nLe actor e popular.\t\t\t\tLe canal e importante.\nLe tenor e romantique.\t\t\tLe restaurante e exelente.\nLe presidente e diplomatique.\t\tLe criminal e terible.\nLe actor non e un animal. \t\t\tLe cliente e importante.\nLe elefante e un animal. \t\t\tLe elefante e fantastique.\nLe conductor non e insolente.\t\t Le cable e urgente.\nLe doctor e inteligente. \t\t\tLe hotel e exelente.\n\nThese statements can be into questions by inverting the subject and verb as in English and not as in Spanish e.g.:\nE popular le actor? Is the actor popular?\tE le tenor romantique? Is the tenor romantic?\nE le presidente diplomatique? Is the president diplomatic?\nE le canal importante? Is the canal important?\nThere is an additional construction that allows the word oerder of the statement to be maintained in the question: “E que...?” ~ “Is it that...?” e.g. “E que le doctor e terible?” Is it that the doctor is terrible?\nWords to remember\nle, the\t|\t\tle simie, the monkey\t|\t\te, is\nun, a, an\t|\tle studente, the student\t|\tnon e, is not\ncuriose, curious |\tin mi opinion, in my opinion\t|\tsi, yes\npopular, popular\na no, oh no\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374673077", "subreddit": "mondial", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So, is Left: G G, Right: E G C, for G G E G C.  Lots of different voicings for a second inversion C major chord!\n\nIt just so happens that when you're first introduced to chord inversions it's when playing straight triads on one hand so the common definition that most people use, e.g. 1st/root position: 1 3 5, 2nd: 3 5 1, 3rd 5 1 3, matches the actual definition of inversion being determined by the note that's in the bass.\n\nUnderstanding that was one of my (recent) first steps toward understanding what is meant by chord voicings v. inversions, especially in a jazz context.\n\nSo, the question of which inversion to use is really which note of the chord to use in the bass!  Following on that the inversion chosen is often based (heh) on eiter smoothing out, or livening up with jumps, the bass line, i.e. voice leading in the bass.

Yes the optimal situation is to hit your ult and just one shot a squishy but if not your Q+W+Lich Bane is on a 4 second CD with 40% CDR late so just dish out the damage as you see fit.\n\n3) Anyone who can lane mid thats tanky. Consider a lane swap. Akali can also do alright vs him but its kind of a skill matchup.\n\n4) Nautilus or anyone who can hold them down for a free fish land.\n\n5) Start Flash &gt; 2 Dorans Rings &gt; Sorc Boots &gt; Sheen &gt; Needlessly &gt; Lich Bane &gt; Zhonyas &gt; Deathcap &gt; Abyssal &gt; Guardians Angel\n\n6) Correct usage of E. Using it for damage, to get in range for your R, to escape, to dodge abilities like Ashe Arrow or Karthus Requiem.\n\nCurrently 4-0 in ranked with Fizz with about 12 kills a game :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374797833", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So, if you take the C major scale and flat the 3rd, 6th and, 7th you get a C minor scale.\n\nMajor C D E F G A B C   Minor C D Eb F G Ab Bb C\n         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1             1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 1\n\nbut if you compare the two scale step patterns you'll notice that it's actually the same pattern but starting at a different place in the pattern.\n\nMajor       WWHWWWH\nMinor  WHWWHWW\n\nSo, basically the Natural Minor scale is the Major scale starting and stopping on the 6th of the Major scale (ex: A to A in C Major or E to E in G Major). This is the Aeolian Mode. The reason it sounds different than the Major scale while still using the same notes is because of the note you're starting and stopping with, or the Tonic. Doing this with every scale degree in a Major scale will give you other modes, but within all these modes you'll have the same 3 Major chords from the Major Scale. \nFor example, if you're in C Major the 3 Major Chords are C, F, and G or the I, the IV, and V.

{"body": "Maybe it's better to get away from the discussion of this word, \"pure\", and just ask what is useful about the various properties we might be discussing.\n\nFunctional code - code which is just applications of functions to other functions or literal values - allows us to reason about it in pieces. For a complex expression we can always look at each piece of it in isolation - the function and each of its arguments - without losing any essential context.\n\nIf my Haskell code is mostly state transformations in a monad, then I can't perform this kind of reasoning any longer. I have to fall back on imperative reasoning techniques - keeping track of program state through a thread of execution, analyzing preconditions, and so on.\n\nThe fact that the stateful code is \"really just\" functional code doesn't help me reason about it any better. On the other hand, it does mean that I can transform my state-related reasoning into an equally intractable form of functional reasoning. So it really brings into question the supposed equivalence between functional form and easy decomposition or reasoning. Being able to reason independently about a function and its arguments doesn't help so much when the argument can be a very complex object which is the result of a lengthy series of subcomputations, i.e. when your functional decomposition looks like `&gt;&gt;= &gt;&gt;= &gt;&gt;= &gt;&gt;= &gt;&gt;= f g h i j k`.\n\nPersonally I think that the whole idea of functional \"purity\" has been oversold in a highly confusing manner. Real gains in program comprehensibility come from decomposition of a problem into less complicated sub-problems, whether that is done by function application or sequential state manipulation or context-free grammar or some other compositional technique. Being able to separate stateful from stateless code is an advantage, but IMO that advantage comes from explicitness and finer-grained types, not from some sort of purification of the stateful code into a better stateless form.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375052954", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Most pro players use it, most people who try it stick with it! So that says a lot ;) So here is an example: You are dying and your opponent is low too. So you want to ignite you click ignite then you have to left click on the enemy but BOOM you are dead before you could do that! Now with Smart Cast on you will just mouse over enemy and click Ignite key (mine is D) and it's on! You die but enemy dies too :) Or any other champion like Zyra 0 just mouse over the enemy and hit E to root them fast, etc etc. Imagine if when you Flashed you actually had to not just click Flash but also select an area to flash to with mouse left click, you could die because you wouldn't flash fast enough. You have to change to Smart Cast in Options (Escape) and key Bindings. Right now it's ctrl+Q just change it to Q, ctrl+W to W, E, R etc etc.  I also changed items used that are in slot 1,2,3,4,5,6 to smart cast and it's so much faster to use on someone! Now if you just do that the spell will work ones you press in and no range indicators. If you want you can try it like I do - More Options and enable Smart Cast Range Indicator. That way when you press let's say Cait Q it will show the range and the spell will only go off when you let go. If you change you mind you can just right click on the ground to cancel. Without the range indicator on you can't cancel because spell goes off immediately which makes you even faster with spell casting but it's a presonal preference.

{"body": "Yes. \nOk, do not read this if you are thin-skinned or don't hold a serious interest in linguistics.\n\n1: This is not a phonology. This is just the bare-bones example of a phonological inventory. One that isn't uniform for your readers.\n\n* For instance, your vowel system is confusing. Your use of symbols may not come across correctly to people reading it. &lt;ay&gt; for instance may be read as [ai:] or [ei:]. This probably doesn't make sense to you right now, and that's fine. These symbols have uniform meanings that allow me to tell you *exactly* the sound that I'm thinking of.\n\n\n* A phonology will include things like allophones, syllabic stress and allowed syllable structures. \n\n* A better example may be this: &lt;ah&gt; can be interpreted as the long [a] sound like in &lt;father&gt; or a sharper [{] sound like the exclamation &lt;Ah!&gt;\n\n* Currently what I see is (C)VC. What this means is that your language's words typically follow a Vowel+consonant syllable with an initial consonant being optional. Phonologies include things like that, it tells us what sorts of sound combinations are possible in X language. For instance, you have &lt;hl&gt; possible, but is &lt;rl&gt; &lt;nkh&gt; or forbid &lt;lnkhs&gt;? These are things people learning a language need to know.\n\n2: Your language violates what's generally seen to be a language universal: it does not have three \"stops\" (these may also be called plosives, but someone correct me if I'm wrong). Sounds like p, t, k, g, b, and d. There are more (which you'll find in the IPA, but English doesn't make use of them [for nit-pickers, I know it does, but for simplicity's sake, it isn't indicated in orthography so I'm ignoring it]).\n\n* All languages have at least 3 stops (Hawaiian is almost an exception to this rule). It's fine if you're not shooting for a realistic language, you can ignore the [Universals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberg%27s_linguistic_universals); however, if your conculture is more humanoid than alien, I'd take a look at it and keep it in mind.\n\n3: The writing system itself is fine, but could use some fleshing out. It reminds me of Arabic which has three different forms depending on where the letter falls in the word. Your language looks to do the same, so you should look at other languages which follow the same pattern. \n\n* In addition, if you want to go the super-realistic approach and figure out what forms would appear/how they'd be written, you can mimic this by writing your alphabet over and over. You'll naturally simplify it and make the proper forms. Think of it like practicing cursive.\n\n* Likewise, take a look at **other** writing systems for ideas at punctuation and the rhetorical effects. A neat example on how different languages handle things like importance: In English, we generally **BOLD** something deemed important, but I've read that Russian S P A C E S out the word instead. How would your language do it? \n\nWhat I highly suggest is that you take a look at the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA) (international phonetic alphabet).\nThis will greatly increase the realism of a language in that you'll become more familiar with sounds that are non-English sounding, and you get a deeper understanding of how sounds work together. \n\nYou may find [Omniglot](http://www.omniglot.com/) interesting to take a look at, perhaps even useful for ideas. \n\nI hope this helps out, and by no means do I want to come off as a dick. \nIf you have anymore questions, or I can help in any other way, feel free to let me know.

{"body": "I've seen this question answered before on reddit (possibly on /r/askmath, which would be a better place for this question) but can't find it right now.\n\nExcuse the long answer - I've tried to summarise it in a TL;DR below.\n\nEssentially we use PEDMAS because we've found it to be useful in arithmetic and algebra (although there are areas of mathematics where this isn't necessarily the case). There's nothing to stop us from using, say, ~~SAMDEP~~ PSAMDE if we wanted to, but things would get very messy if we did.\n\nLet's just consider the DMAS bit. Why do multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction? Because it makes sense to do it that way. I might send you out to buy me three half-dozen boxes of eggs and two boxes containing a dozen. The total number of eggs is 3 x 6 + 2 x 12. The real-life situation this describes requires us to interpret this as (3 x 6) + (2 x 12), or 42 in total, rather than 3 x (6 + 2) x 12. Multiplication before addition occurs naturally all the time, so it makes sense to do the operations in that order.\n\nFurthermore, PEDMAS allows us to simplify algebra. We can write an expression like:\n\n    c = 4a^2 + 5b + 1\n\nand we know this means we have compute a x a x 4 and 5 x b, add these together and add 1. If the order were SAMDEP, this would have to be written as:\n\n    c = [4(a^2)] + (5b) + 1\n\nwhich is less easy to read.\n\nWhy do things work out this way? Well, multiplication is really repeated addition, and exponentiation is just repeated multiplication. Suppose a = 3 in the above expression, and we expand it out: \n\n    c = 4 x 3^2 + 5b + 1\n\n      = 4 x (3 x 3) + b + b + b + b + b + 1\n\n      = 3 x 3 + 3 x 3 + 3 x 3 + 3 x 3 + b + b + b + b + b + 1\n\n      = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + b + b + b + b + b + 1\n\nNow we have only one operation so we can do the additions in any order, but you can see that if we go backwards to the original expression, each time we collect up addends into a multiplication, we get a single product that needs to be added to another result. So we end up adding together products, meaning multiplication must come before addition. Exponentiation bundles together multiplicands ready for multiplication by other terms, hence the exponentiation needs to be done before the multiplication.\n\nIf we consider integers only, division can be viewed as just repeated subtraction, and subtraction is just addition of negative terms, hence division comes at the same level as multiplication and subtraction at the same level as addition.\n\nParentheses give us a way of overriding the existing order, so P has to come before everything else so we can more easily solve word problems like the following: \"How many ounces of vegetables are there in three bags of mixed vegetables each containing four ounces of carrots and six ounces of peas?\" (Answer: 3 x (4 + 6) oz = 3 x 10 oz = 30 oz.) Without parentheses, we would have to write 3 x 4 + 3 x 6, essentially expanding the parentheses. Imagine if the parentheses contained some much more complicated expression - we would need to write it out in full several times over if parentheses weren't available.\n\nTL;DR: For integers, exponentiation is repeated multiplication and collects up multiplicands ready for multiplication by or addition to other terms, while multiplication is repeated addition and collects up addends for addition to other terms. Hence it is useful to do exponentiation before multiplication (and division), and multiplication before addition (and subtraction). Parentheses give a way of overriding the order.\n\nEDIT 1: removed extraneous word  \nEDIT 2: P must come first, whatever the order, or else parentheses are useless  \nEDIT 3: Gasp!

[Here is my guide to Lead Sheet notation](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1h8tol/faq_question_how_do_i_read_lead_sheet_notation/caryq0w) that I posted to this sub. It's pretty comprehensive, and covers every kind of chord imaginable, and breaks down the notation in a kind of formulaic way. What it reduces to is, knowing the root, what is the quality of the triad? From there, are there added notes? Are those added notes alterations, or \"Standard\" (ie 9 vs #9). \n\nThe problem is if this chord is an inversion. How will the software know what the root is? If I input C E G A, how will the program know if this is a C6 chord, or an Am7/C? Or what if I entered C D E F G A B? This might look like just mashing all the white notes, but every one of those notes is in a G13 chord. Will the computer say it's a G13, or would it give the nonsensical answer of Cmaj13, or something worse, like Cmaj7(add2,4,6)? So just giving the computer what the bass note is, might not be helpful, because it might interpret it as some other kind of chord when it's really just an inversion. \n\nIf you are expecting the user to be able to identify the root, and input the chord tones into the computer in thirds, then it would be pretty easy to come up with a database of chords.

{"body": "I wouldn't think of it as between chords. Instead think of it as playing a chord melodically instead of harmonically (One note vs 2+ notes). I don't have the ear or the time to give you really detailed information of what this artist is doing but I think I can give you and general idea.                          A song is in a certain key, lets say C. Now as with all theory, the major scale (C Major: C D E F G A B C) is very important to know. All of these notes are in the key of C because they are in the C major scale. Now a C triad(chord of three notes stacked in 3rds) is C E G. If you are playing a song with a C chord you can play any C E and G on the guitar neck it doesn't matter which ones or how far apart any combination of these notes is a C chord. However, a song isn't going to be very interesting if you are just playing one chord so you play a chord progression. This is simply a series of chords played one after another; Anything series of chords is a progression but certain patterns tend to sound \"good\". A very common progression in the key of C would be C G Am F this is also known as a I V vi IV (Roman numerals) progression because the C is the 1st note in the scale. The G is the 5th and so on. So if you have a song in C and your playing a G chord you are playing the V chord (Relative to the key (C)). Ok lets take a closer look at the G chord (G B D) if you refer back to the C major scale (2 Octave: CDEFGABCDEFGABC) you will notice the G triad (Chord of thirds) is every other note starting with G and ending with the second D. It may be a G chord but notice every note is in the C major scale. This is because the G chord is the V chord or the dominate chord in the key of C. When we move the vi chord or Am or A minor chord (All the same just different way of writing it) you must have noticed it is in small numerals. This is because a A minor chord fits in the key of C not A. This is because a A triad is ( A C# E). Once again look at the C major scale (CDEFGABC) notice how C# isn't there. That is because C# isn't in the C major scale. So if you look at every other note or the 3rds in the C major scale you get (A C E) which is a A minor chord. ____________________________ TLDR: So in this song or any melody a musician has chosen the meter (time) and picked a certain number of beats to play each chord for. You can play each chord harmonically (Struming all the notes at once) or melodically (playing notes found in that chord to a certain rhythm.) These chords and notes are always relative to the key of the song. So a song like this is a mix of the two. Maybe Strum C for 4 beats. Then play G G D B for once beat each then strum Am and F. So in this the G chords was played but it was built over time. As always with music the rules are here to learn in order for you to break them better and make your own music. I hope this helps its a little long and I'm not sure how easy it will be to follow but I decided to write this up real quick to get better at explaining it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375220858", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm dyslexic and struggled with basic chemistry more than any other subject in grade school. If the periodic table had ever been shown to me this way, it would have changed everything for me. It's so smooth and logical, no arbitrary names to memorize, shows a clear pattern of progression.\n\nI understand that there may be issues with the accuracy of what this represents, but the way this data is represented is so easy to understand it makes me frustrated that I wasn't given a visual aid like this in the past.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nI don't think you guys really understood what I was saying, and that's my fault. Please let me try to explain better.\n\nAs someone with a learning disability-- which is the real problem, not my dyslexia which is actually very mild, I don't know why I even wrote that-- it is very difficult to learn new concepts. I have to 'learn holistically' or 'see the big picture,' as it is frequently phrased. I have to understand *why* something is the way it is on a broad level before understanding details. Otherwise I am lost and become frustrated or angry.\n\nThe way I was taught about the periodic table was first by reading a textbook and receiving a lesson to the tune of 'this is what an atom is and how it works,' and then I was required to learn the periodic table. However, because of my disability, relating 'this is what an atom is' to 'this big chart covered with words and numbers' was nearly impossible. The two just did not correspond to each in my head. Because see, *visually*, the periodic table as it stands doesn't make any sense. There's no *visual* reason for any of the squares to be placed where they are except the atom number, but that's so close to a standard 'first second third' numbering system (like the numbers on a list) that it doesn't help.\n\nThe worst part is the name of the elements, which are completely arbitrary and don't have any pattern to them. Why is the second row Li Be B C N O F Ne? My mind searches everywhere for a pattern, but there fucking isn't one. I become frustrated because I don't understand, but no one else seems to see a problem.\n\nAnd yes, see, I do understand that there are real reasons for the squares to be placed where they are, but I can't see it so I forget and get confused and feel angry and panicked. It's just the nature of my disability. When I see OP's chart, visually it makes sense. Each row and column shows a progression. The placement of everything makes sense. There's no 'okay, that random square is called 'Boron' for no reason, and you have to remember that. Why? Because I said so.' It makes me feel peaceful just looking at it.\n\nDoes that make better sense? I know it's hard for people who don't have a learning disorder to understand the way people like me think, but I did the best I could.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375267092", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 43, "controversiality": 0}

The idea is to sort-of \"church-encode\" (to give a very imprecise analogy) lenses via their `modF` function, which looks like this:\n\n    modF :: Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; s -&gt; Lens' s a -&gt; f s\n\nFor the general case of a lens family, it becomes:\n\n    modF :: Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; s -&gt; Lens s t a b -&gt; f t\n\nIf you partially-apply away the lens parameter, you end up with a perfect representation of the lens you just passed in, in the same way that partially-applying away the list parameter of `foldr` (or `foldl`, or `foldMap`) gives you a perfect representation of the list you just passed in.\n\n---\n\nFor comparison's sake, the following are the representations of lenses/lens families that I'm familiar with:\n\n    -- indexed-store coalgebroid rep., e.g., @data-lens@\n    type Lens s t a b = s -&gt; IxStore b a t\n    data IxStore i o v = IxStore o (i -&gt; v)\n    \n    -- van Laarhoven a.k.a functorial rep., e.g., @lens@\n    type Lens s t a b = forall f.

{"body": "Unless you're changing the tuning or string gauges, you shouldn't really ever need to get into the trem cavity. If neither of these things are relevant to your adjustment and the bridge is somehow not flush after tuning the guitar, you might consider locating the guitar in a less humid environment.\n\nAside from that, what everyone said is true, back the block out in the bridge as far as you can without removing it (you'll feel it \"bite\" if it's getting close to coming out, at least on older Edge bridges), slide the string in (ball end snipped; this seems obvious, but some people do forget to do it), and tighten the block back up. Once it's all the way taut, tug the string a bit to make sure it's secure, then begin threading it through the tuning machine. I usually bend all my strings to the point where there's a slight kink in them, and I bend them on the tuning machine **above** the one I'm threading. So bend it on the A for the E, etc. The high E I bend in the crevice at the top of the headstock. This will give you just a little more than enough string to go around the pegs without having to wind and wind and wind it on.\n\nLastly, to expedite getting the bridge even, tune from outside in while you put each new string on. E E A B D G. By the time you get to the high E, you'll notice that the lower strings require less tuning with each successive pass. Then, with all strings on it - this is important - beat the everliving hell out of the strings. I mean, deep bends, dive bombs, vibrato, all that. Retune. Do this again. Retune. Do this again. After about 3-4 reps of this, your guitar should stay almost perfectly in tune.

My opponent then has some sort of idea of what the card is because I placed it in my hand next to my already existing land, which means it is also likely a land card.\n\n2) There is a lot of combos, synergy, and strategy involved with each play. And by moving the cards in your hand around you may see an interaction you didn't see previously that opens up new plays for you\n\nSo, for most players at that level, its more strategy than it is a nervous tick.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375279995", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No problem I love this stuff. Yes in the I V vi IV or any progression you can mix around what is played as a chord or melodically. You can have a chord progression without any chords if you are playing notes from the chord you are on. So a simple made up melody could be C C G E - G B B B - C C A A - F A C F. (The dashes are the end of measures) This melody would be following the I V vi IV progression because it is outlining the chords in the melody. In contrast you could just play the chords to a rhythm or mix chords and melody for a more developed sound. However if you only play notes that are in the chords or the chords themselves you will find yourself with a kinda boring song. The notes in the chord will sound \"good\" but by no means are or should you be limited to them. My advice for building some simple melodies is to think of the notes in the chord as safe notes.  So while writing the melody make sure to play the notes in the chord but also play notes in the C major scale they will for the most part sound \"good\". Also you're not limited to the C major scale you could in your melody play Ab or Eb even though they are not in the major scale of the key you're in. I don't recommend holding on these notes unless you're intentionally trying to get a certain sound, but definitely feel free to hit them in a lick or run. It's your melody make it sound the way you want. ---------------- As far as playing Am over C. Yes! You may have heard people talking about modes before and that's what this is. If you look at the Am scale (ABCDEFGA) and the C major scale (CDEFGABC) you'll notice they contain the exact same notes but in a different order or pattern.(Am is the relative minor to C major)  A minor scale is also known as Aeolian mode. If you play these two scales you will notice a very different sound between them. That is because you have changed the pattern. If you look at the C major scale you will notice there are 3 notes between the first note and the third (C#, D, D#) but in the Am scale there are only 2 notes between the first and the third (A#, B). If you keep dissecting the scale you will notice that the Am scale has a lowered or flat 3rd 6th and 7th compared to it's relative major C. Modes kinda take a while to figure out. But if you take the pattern of the Am scale and apply it to C major you get a minor pattern in C with the flat 3rd,6th, and 7th (CDEbFGAbBbC). Sorry if this is hard to follow. I wouldn't worry too much about the theory behind modes until you really understand all the major and minor scales. --------- Edit response. You're getting into what is known as modulation... This effectively changes the key of the song so yes you can do it but realize it will change the sound. TLDR: Play notes in the chords to outline them but play other notes around them to embellish them. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375296297", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; No one is going to sacrifice their business for some unproved economic theory of economic improvement.\n\nMore money in more hands = more money being spent? This is an unproven economic theory? Strange, it's right in the first chapter of any economics book I've seen. Would you like to criticize my thesis on the wetness of water too?\n\nStrangely, [science](http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2007/wp2007_23.pdf)^1 seems to agree.\n\n&gt; You can't just makeup an example and expect it to prove some ridiculous idea.\n\nYes, a simplified analogy is simplified, and an analogy. Thank you for pointing that out. I'm not going to write a full lecture just to prove a point to some redditor. \n\nHowever, you can't just point out the fact that I simplified something to make a point and have that act as your entire counterpoint. If my idea is so ridiculous than it should be trivial to come up with counter-examples. \n\n&gt; Your math doesn't even add up in it anyways and it in no way is relevant to the best decision of business owners.\n\nIf my math doesn't add up, show me where. \n\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n\n    A B C D E F G H I  J  K\n\nExample 1: $300 for 11 people. Give 1 person $200, leaving you with $100 for 10 people. Divide $100 by 10 = $10 per person. \n\nExample 2: $300 for 11 people. Give 1 person $100, leaving you with $200 for 10 people. Divide $200 by 10 = $20 per person.\n\nThis is grade school arithmetic there. If you see mistakes I would be very happy if you were to point them out.\n\nAs for relevance to business decisions; clearly a business may have their own priorities, and they will make their own decisions based on those. I am pointing out a perspective that many business owners ignore, and making a case for why they should not ignore it. \n\n&gt; We are talking about fast food. Better morale translate very little in tangible benefits in fast food. No one that buys McDonald's cares how the employees feel.\n\nI don't know about you, but I prefer to be greeted by smiling clerks who look like they're happy do be there, not some dead eyed automaton. Most humans are gifted with a useful ability called empathy. When we see happy people, our mood tends to improve. When our mood improves, we tend to associate that improvement with the current experience. If that experience is buying food from a fast food place, then I have just made a positive association with getting food at that place. That in turn leads to more brand loyalty for the places that make us feel this way.\n\n&gt; They care that they get a cheap burger and with thousands lining up for a single McDonalds job, there is someone in those applicants that will work just as hard for $7 as they will for $14. Especially when you consider that money is low on employees motivation list.\n\nSo your best counter-example to my point is to point out the horrid state of the nation? Surprisingly, I understand that people *will* work for $7 just as they will work for $14. If you are out to prove that the economic crisis hit people hard then you are beating a dead horse. My point, however, is that the economic situation would be better off if more of the people working for $7 an hour right now instead worked for $14 an hour. If all those minimum wage people had some spending money then we would have the space for entirely new markets.\n\nAgain, right now those people working for $7 an hour barely make enough for basic survival. If they could also afford to buy more stuff then we could have a bunch of stores selling the stuff they need. If they could afford to eat out more often then we would have more restaurants catering to these tastes. If they could spend more money on leisure then we could have entire industries to provide this leisure. Each of those places would in turn employ people, who would in turn go out and spend money. Then we wouldn't have thousands waiting in line for McD's jobs, because there would be way more other jobs keeping money in circulation in that region.\n\nThis is a textbook example of how Capitalism is meant to work.\n\nOr instead would you prefer that we move toward [3rd world status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:First_second_third_worlds_map.svg)^2, where only a minute fraction of people have the money to drive the economy? Strangely, that [doesn't work out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gdpercapita.PNG)^3 all that well for them.\n\n&gt; No they won't because 90% of McDonalds employees aren't taking this job as a career to \"make a difference in the world\"\n\nYou don't have to strive to make a difference in the world in order to make a difference where you are. I'm not proposing that a McD's employee will solve world hunger, however they may be more willing to solve a scheduling issue with their friend Joe-Bob, or figure out how to keep the fryer cleaned on schedule. Every workplace has its own challenges. The people working these jobs are people too, and they have their own problems and priorities. Just because these priorities do not align with yours does not mean you can freely dismiss them.\n\n&gt; No they won't. Everyone wears the same uniform in fast food.\n\nSure, I'll give you that.\n\n&gt; Because most companies can't. Wage increases have to mean price increases.\n\nOk, by how much? You keep making these broad statements without offering any sort of numbers. Could these companies redirect some profits to pay employee wages? Are there other optimizations they could make to offload some overhead onto better paid employees? What sort of price increases would the customers be willing to tolerate? Are they able to pay the social cost when these policies eventually overburden entire segments of society, leaving them unable to buy the products they are selling?\n\nYour understanding of economics seems to be very linear, \"this is the only cause, and that is the only effect.\" There are no easy answers. I don't go around imagining that we can \"poof\" and increase the minimum wage. Clearly there are a ton of problems that would have to be resolved; many of them in ways we simply have not come up with. However, we clearly need to go in that direction, otherwise given another 50-100 years kids will be reading about the glorious collapse of the American empire.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375312032", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
