{"body": "Let's look at the actual haddocks for mapAccumLOf. There I provided 3 alternative signatures to help users understand it.\n\n    mapAccumLOf :: Iso s t a b       -&gt; (acc -&gt; a -&gt; (acc, b)) -&gt; acc -&gt; s -&gt; (acc, t)\n    mapAccumLOf :: Lens s t a b      -&gt; (acc -&gt; a -&gt; (acc, b)) -&gt; acc -&gt; s -&gt; (acc, t)\n    mapAccumLOf :: Traversal s t a b -&gt; (acc -&gt; a -&gt; (acc, b)) -&gt; acc -&gt; s -&gt; (acc, t)\n\nThese signatures are written so that to understand them, you need only understand one of two conventions. First:\n\nThe `Traversal s t a b` convention is something you get used to. We start with a whole container of type `s`, can go in and get out some `a`s and replace them with `b`s giving back a container of type `t`. The types `s` and `t` are related. The types `a` and `b` are related. This nomenclature is used consistently across literally a thousand functions in lens, so by the time you get to this one you can be used to it.\n\nSecond, when in doubt if you see a combinator `fooOf`in lens it is usually a generalization of an existing combinator `foo`, but modified so that it takes a `Traversal` if it was a combinator that required a `Traversable` constraint, takes a `Fold` if it was a combinator that required a `Foldable` constraint, etc. So the signature is just a generalization of what you can do with a combinator you probably already know, but generalized so it can work with monomorphic containers.\n\n    mapAccumL :: Traversable t =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; (a, c)) -&gt; a -&gt; t b -&gt; (a, t c)\n\nis the signature this generalizes.\n\nThe signatures in lens are _very_ opaque. It was written unapologetically in a style where its singular purpose was to make sure that every combinator could be used wherever you'd think it should fit in a consistent style.\n\nThis unfortunately means that the type signatures expose lots of gory details most end users won't understand.\n\nYou could replace the signature above with any one of those 3 signatures I gave and it would type check, but then less user code would type check.\n\nI will happily accept documentation patches that increase the legibility of the documentation for lens, but keep in mind there are literally a thousand similar functions, so explaining the convention in the haddocks for each and every one is a somewhat daunting task. The `Lens s t a b` convention is described in the docs for `Lens`. \n\n`Over` and `Conjoined` are not really described in a user-accessible level of detail, though. Conjoined is an implementation trick that makes the overhead of indexed traversals go away when you don't use the index. `Over` allows `mapAccumLOf` to give you access to the index when you use it on an indexed traversal. \n\nI don't claim it is a perfect convention. The types in `lens` have to serve too many masters to make any of them happy. I merely claim that I couldn't have written the library another way.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375351661", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

There are other generic versions, some slightly cheaper, he's had success with this one and we didn't switch.\n\nIt has stopped the thinning of his hair completely and there was a noticeable regrowth of hair on the back of his head (the crown area).

{"body": "Let's think about a few things here...\n\nAssume you have enough memory on your computer that it can store [a couple months worth of worldwide internet traffic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte) (100 exabytes, 10^20 bytes, or interestingly, 1/8 global hard drive space) *for every single particle in the universe* (10^80 of 'em). And yes, you do need to store the number to be able to display it, even partially. But assume you can. Awesome right?\n\nNow if you have that much memory, you probably have a pretty fast processor. I like the exa- prefix, so we'll go with 100 exahertz (or one 10 gigahertz processor running in parallel for every man, woman, and child on Earth, with a couple billion left over). Now, it's a bit more complicated than this, but with 100 quintillion processor cycles per second, let's just say that means it can add 100 quintillion zeroes to the screen every second. So it would take 10^80 seconds to completely load the page. The universe itself is 4 x 10^17 seconds old. So you're going to need 10^63 universe ages to load the page.\n\nBut you've got time, so you sit back and let it load. Now, your display is pretty bad ass, considering the amount of money you spent on your processing power and memory. You were hardly going to scrimp on your display, right? So you bought a display that is a mile high and a mile wide. Rough math gives me a resolution of about 6,336,000 x 6,336,000 (I'm going with a 1:1 aspect ratio because fuck Pythagoras).\n\nIf we show these zeroes in a really small font, we can squeeze them into 4x4 pixels, right?\n\n      1234\n    1  x   x   x   x   x   x\n    2 x x x x x x x x x x x x\n    3  x   x   x   x   x   x\n    4\n       x   x   x   x   x   x\n      x x x x x x x x x x x x\n       x   x   x   x   x   x\n\nThat means we can display 1,584,000 zeroes in each row (and the same number of rows on the screen at a time). So we're going to need 10^94 ish rows, or 10^88 ish screens. So you need the scroll grabby thingy (what's that called - the part of the scroll bar you click and drag up and down) to be 10^-82 ish pixels high.\n\nOops, you're going to need a super-precise mouse, maybe 10^80 dpi. Dots per inch may not be the right unit here. Let's make it 10^46 dots per planck length (dpℓP). Okay, that's impossible, so we have to make the display 10^46 times bigger than it is, just so we can use a planck mouse.\n\nSo, the display is now 10^46 miles high. We might have to fold the display in half (it's flexible OLED) a few times to get it to fit into the universe, but I'm sure we'll get it crammed in there. Let's see, the observable universe is about 100 billion light years across, or 10^23 miles. If I'm correct, that means we have to fold it in half 78 times.\n\nHere's where we get our first bit of good news: It is actually possible to [fold something in half](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Gallivan) that many times if it is 10^46 miles wide. And another bit of good news: at this size (and at 100 pixels per inch), the screen can display about 10^52 rows by 10^52 columns of zeroes, which means we can display googolplex all at once, without having to scroll. (I made a mistake above. When I made the display 10^46 times taller than it was to make the scroll bar clickable, I also made it 10^46 times wider. This inadvertently made the display 10^92 times bigger in area, which is about as big as we need it to be.) Alas, it's going to take a few billion years before you can see the zeroes on the far edges of the display, because they're billions of light years away.\n\nBut really, all this has done is give us a sense of how big googol is (since we're trying to display googol +1 digits). The number we were trying to display, googolplex, is actually way, way bigger in its own right.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375621582", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's how this works: you can use any combination of notes at any time, period.  You can use bVII's in major, or bV's or #i's if it suits your fancy.  Or random quartal combinations.  With only 88 keys on the piano, the possibilities are not *quite* endless, but there are literally 2^88 different possibilities (though you may need more than two hands to play them all!).  If you go into microtonality, the possibilities *are* literally endless.  Anything you want.\n\nThat's not the answer you're looking for, obviously, but you can't forget that bit.  Music theory has a way to figure out which combinations might work better than others at achieving your goals, and *that*'s what you're actually looking for.\n\nSo you got a key -- let's say D dorian, one of my favorite keys.  The notes are D E F G A B C, which is the minor scale with a 6 instead of b6.  How do you tell your listeners that this is the dorian mode?  Well, you play in the minor scale, but you raise your b6's.  The special thing about dorian is that raised 6th, so use it often.  Try *not* to use chords with notes not in the scale unless you really have to.  When you use bIII, bVII, or, bVI in major, you're actually borrowing from minor -- you're using chords from two different scales.  That's perfectly fine, but if you do that in a mode, you threaten to lose that modal feel.  The triads built into dorian are i, ii\\*, bIII, IV\\*, v, vi0\\*, bVII.  The chords marked with a \\* contain the special note, so try to give them special prominence.  And of course, everyone asking questions in this subreddit fails to mention the most important component -- melody.  If you have a melody, that melody's gotta be in the mode.  You're welcome to leave the mode if you want, but only if you know what you're doing.  Also, the minor key has a raised 7th harmonically (raised 6th and 7th going up melodically, not raised going down).  That means the V chord.  If you're writing *modal* music, avoid that V chord if it's not in the scale.  The aeolian scale has a v chord; use that.  But refer to my first paragraph.  You may like the sound of the V in your modal piece.\n\nAnd ditch that bIII bVI bVII bit.  Not useful in the least in modes.  It's just some extra borrowed chords, and if you're borrowing in a mode, those aren't the ones you get to borrow.  Mixolydian already has the bVII, for instance.  Also, play around with 7th chords, too.  Mixolydian in particular has a dominant 7th as its tonic chord.  Most people are used to it resolving up a fourth, but in mixolydian, it *is* the resolution.

Each string starts on a different note (open string). low to high (E A D G B E). so first fret on 1'st string would be F. Here is the whole music alphabet \nA A# B C D D# E F F# G G#. After G# comes A. All sharps could also be flats. These are called enharmonic notes. I.E. A# also could be called Bb or F# could also be called Gb. the first four frets of our first string would be....Start on E for the open...1'st fret=F 2'nd=f# 3'rd=G 4th=G# and 5'th=A  Hope this helps!

A 36C and 28DD is smaller than a 44A. A 30F is the same volume as a 36D and 40B. The difference between all of them though is the way their breasts are laid out on the body. The 30F has the smallest ribcage out of the three, and because of that, her breasts are condensed in a smaller area, making them seem larger in proportion to the other two. The 36D and 40B both have larger ribcage measurements/bodies, and because of that, their breasts are spread out over a larger portion of the body. \n\nAll three have the exact same volume, they are just placed on the body differently.\n\nAll a cup letter means is the difference in inches (or centimeters) the bust is from the ribcage. Here are the cup letters US and UK sizing uses:        \nUS: AA A B C D DD DDD DDDD H I J K L M N        \nUK: AA A B C D DD E F FF G GG H HH J JJ K KK L LL    \n  \nEach of those letters means an (additional) inch difference. It starts with AA being a 0 inch difference, meaning if someones ribcage and bust both measure 28/28, 32/32, 44/44, or 60/60, they would be wearing a 28AA, 32AA, 44AA, and 60AA respectively. The women in the 60AA has significantly larger breasts than the 28AA, but they both wear AA because they have a 0 inch difference.\n\nThe A cups means a 1 inch difference, so they would measure 28/29, 32/33, 44/45, and 60/61. They would then wear 28A, 32A, 44A, and 60A.\n\nThe DDDD US/ F UK is a 7 inch difference, so they would measure 28/35, 32/39, 44/51, and 60/67. They would then wear 28F, 32F, 44F, and 60F. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375838294", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "And I'm pretty sure the 200L equates to a 55 gallon (roughly), but what are the dimensions of your tank L x W x H, because that will matter in what you can keep.\n\nTypically Haps are the most docile but grow to be the largest, peacocks are the next most docile but both peacocks and haps have very plain females and stunning males.  Many people like to do an all-male tank for the most color you can get in fresh water, rivaling even the prettiest saltwater FOwLR tanks.  The downside is that they are very expensive and take a lot of trial and error and balancing.  Its something you'll typically want to have a time-out tank as well as a LFS that will take trade and order fish for you to have a chance of working.  Mbuna have a broad range of aggression, but for the most part a very docile mbuna is equal in aggression to a pretty aggressive peacock or hap.  They stay small and like to be kept in large numbers (overstocking) so like any cichlid really you're going to want to over filter.  Mbuna like to be kept in harem groups with 1 male and multiple females but it can be hard to find the fish already sexed especially as juveniles, what and how many you can/should keep depend greatly on the dimensions more than the volume of your tank.\n\nLake Victorian haps are of a size and temperament of Mbuna and many people mix them with mbuna without problems (especially since you can get green, true red, and some funky purples that you won't find in a mbuna).  They are rarer and typically more expensive than their Malawi cousins.\n\nLake Tanganyikan Cichlids are very behavior centric as they typically don't have the amazing colors of the Malawi or Victoria fish, however many people don't come back to Malawi after having gone Tang because of how interesting and varied the fish are.  Tangs are SUPER sensitive to diet and water quality and I typically only recommend them for a person who has Rift Lake Cichlid experience and who has very hard water.\n\n[Here is a great cichlid photo site that lets you look at all the species of Lake Malawi kept in the aquarium.

{"body": "While I do not know if this can be reduced to some known optimization problem, it may help you to imagine this as labeling a regular ruler. When you have 5 variables, imagine it as a ruler five centimeters long:\n\n0---1---2---3---4\n\nNow your task is to label each of the centimeter marks with a letter from 'a' to 'e' so that the distance traveled by a pencil that traverses the given path 'a b c d a e' along the ruler is as small as possible.\n\nFrom this you can come to a couple of observations:\n\na) There is some constant cost which is represented as travelling from 0 on the ruler to the point labeled with 'a'. So if you place 'a' on 0, the cost is eliminated. Though this might not be optimal! However it might guide you as to how to choose the value for 'a'.\n\nb) You are trying to clump the adjacent nodes as much together as possible. Since there are 3 paths using the letter 'a' (more than using any other letter), it is a good idea to use 'a' as a central point for traveling to 'b' and 'e'. Indeed, if you look at the optimal solution where a=1, b=2 and e=0 you can see that 'a' is in the middle of those 3. And regarding observation a) you can see that even though a=3, b=4 and e=2 would yield the same results for this subpart of the problem choosing a=1 helps with the initial cost. But as I said above, don't take this as granted.\n\nI think that B might be the key to some algorithm for solving this in better than O(N!). Of course it all depends on the sizes of your input and whether you require optimal solution or a close enough approximate.\n\nGood luck!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375975251", "subreddit": "algorithms", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Both of your scenarios have different outcomes\n\n1st) To maintain your 40 gpm, your source's pressure would have to increase maintain said flow, due to Q∝sqrt(dP).\n\n2nd) You would start, restricting you flow, but because, friction losses in a pipe line are a result of flow through the pipe, it will not ever stop, per say, but it will get slower and slower. I will go ahead and work it out, the way you worded it I assume you are taking a Fluids class, so i will not go through the details of a lot of the math.\n\nFirst, let’s just do a general case with a few assumptions\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1) Incompressible flow, Ideal Liquid\n\n2) Flow is generated by a infinity wide reservoir, so that dh/dt=0\n\n3) Isothermal flow (I really doubt it was necessary to say, but just in case)\n\n4) Steady State\n\n5) Constant Pipe\n\nSystem:\nWe have a tank with a level of liquid in it at height h, at the bottom of the tank there is a valve, with a length of pipe attached downstream, of length l. At t=0, that valve is opened and allowed to reach steady state.  What happens as we increase the length of the discharge piping?\n\nHere is a drawing w/ equations to help understand the system.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SXsCaec.png\n\nNow, consider this the state before the valve was open was that the pressure at points 2 &amp; 3 was atmospheric. Now that it is flowing, what would the pressure at point 3 be? Have we done anything to change that pressure? The answer is no, the pressure at the end of the pipe is still atmospheric. If this needs further explanation, ask.\n\nOK so we know what P3 is and we know P1. Also, from a material balance and our assumptions the flow Q is constant across the pipe. But we have an issue, in order to know what Q is, we need P2. Well from Bernoulli's Principle, which is just an energy balance on to points in a fluid system, we can get that 0.5 x rho x u3^2 + rho x g x h3 + P3 + PL(D,l,Q,Materials) = 0.5 x rho x u2^2 + rho x g x h2 + P2.  Now since we are in a constant diameter pipe, Q is constant across the pipe, and the is no elevation change across the pipe, then the kinetic energy and the potential energy terms (velocity and elevation) cancel and we are left with: P2 = P3 + PL.  Now all we need is to find PL, which is a function of the pipe diameter, pipe length, flow, and the material of both the fluid and pipe (written like this in the dimensions we are working with PL = (32 x rho x f x l x ( Q^2 ))/(D^3 x pi^2).  Now, since the only thing we are concern with is what happens to the system as we increase the pipe length, PL can be written much simply as PL = k x l, where k is some constant. Now we, we have all of our variables accounted for in terms of things we know. So we can get the governing relationship for this system, which is Q ∝ sqrt(rho x g x h - k x l).  So with this relationship, if we increase the length l, we will keep decreasing our flow until we reach a l = (rho x g x h/k) then we will have 0 flow. But we can never reach that value because if we remember what k was, k was directly proportional to the square of the flow, so we are going to change up some stuff and define a constant j, so that k = j x Q^2 . If we rearrange some things and define a constant a so that Q= a x sqrt(dP), we end up with Q=sqrt((rho x g x h)/(1/a + j x l))\n\nSo as we increase l we approach 0 but never reach it.  To answer the question about the bonus, assuming the flow is what is maintaining your upstream pressure, then if you were at 0 psi  absolute, you will have boiled the liquid and all of your fluid would be a very light gas, and probably collapse whatever your destination is, under the vacuum.\n\nEdit: Grammar &amp; Spelling", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375987398", "subreddit": "AskEngineers", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Each of the keys (in western classical/jazz/etc.) uses a 7 note (heptatonic) scale.  By using our current system we have we only have to deal with 7 letters for each: A B C D E F G.  Yes, we have to remember which get flatted or sharped in which keys but the alternative would be memorizing which letters from A B C D E F G H I J K L any given key uses which, IMHO, would be much more difficult.\n\nWhat's more, learn your circle of fifths and you'll see that there is a definite pattern to how the sharps and flats are introduced as you move from key to key (going right: keep the sharps from the last key and sharp the 7th of the new one, going left: keep the flats of the last key and flat the 4th of the new one) -- you don't have to actually work out the notes from the whole tone/half tone major/minor pattern!.  That would go out the window if you used a separate signifier for each individual tone.  So, in that sense, the current system is actually much more simple, or at least gives you different ways of working out the notes in a given key, you just need to approach learning them inside of that system instead of rote memorization of a bunch of lists.\n\nAlso, as elmariachi304 pointed out, learning to play in the different keys is better approached by learning to play common chord progressions in each.  Many (most) instruction books will introduce new keys with pieces that exclusively use I IV V (or i iv v/V) chords from that key.  And, I'll add that it's best to learn the keys in circle order (with relative minors as you go) so that with each new key you've only got one new sharp/flat note to work with (which most instruction books that include reading sheet music probably do, as well).  By doing that you ingrain the different chord shapes and note placements for that key via muscle memory.\n\nSo, in short, there are definite advantages to the current system and moving to a system of separate signifiers for each note in the chromatic, 12-note, scale would remove many of those and introduce other challenges in the process.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375987796", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Beautiful answer, thanks for the write-up and diagram; helped a lot!\n\nI graduated ME in 2012 but this question popped into my head today. Had a engineer question my reasoning on using a 2-1/2\" line to a piece of equipment that had a 1-1/2\" connection. Told him at the 100gpm flow the machine requires, that the 1-1/2\" line, considering our losses in pipe friction, fittings, and developed length, would be near or over 80 psi. With a 2-1/2\" line those losses would only be about 5-10 psi. With a booster pump delivering 75 psi at the source and a requirement of 35 psi at the connection, we had to step up the pipe. The risk was too great of not having enough pressure at the connection point.\n\n\nIt just got me thinking as to what would happen as a certain pressurized pipe approached infinite length what would happen to the flow.\n\nLet me try to rephrase to see if I understand correctly:\n\n(I am assuming PL stands for pipe losses)\n\nI am well versed with the affinity laws that tells us that flow is proportional to the square root of pressure and the cube root of power.\n\nIn your equation - \"PL = ( 32 x rho x f x l x ( Q^2 ))/( D^3 x pi^2 )\" - we are holding the liquids density, flow, pipe diameter, and material constant. That leaves us with PL = k x l. So the next equation - Q ∝ sqrt(rho x g x h - k x l) - is the same as Q ∝ sqrt(P - losses(of which length is only variable)). The items within the square root cannot reach zero because the constant k is also proportional to flow. \n\nSo as the pipe gets longer, pipe loses will balance out with flow and pressure .... as the pipe gets longer, losses cause pressure drops, and pressure drops cause flow to slow. As flow slows, pipe loses due to friction lower.\n\nSo it iterates down the pipe as pipe losses lower due to lower pressure drop due to lower flow. Pressure can never reach atmospheric pressure (assuming the end is open to atmosphere) correct? So no matter the length of the pipe, there will always be full pipe flow, it will just be considerably slower. *EDIT: At infinity, friction loss moves towards zero, pressure loss moves towards P2, and flow moves towards zero*\n\nSo that means that at the end of a near infinite pipe, pressure could be the same as the start point of flow, less energy given off as a sum of all pipe losses? P3 = P2-PL (which makes sense from your mentioned P2 = P3 + PL). My assumption, \"pressure loss moves towards P2\" cannot hold true if P3 = 0.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375990528", "subreddit": "AskEngineers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When /u/vornska says is right, the question \"what is a mode?\" means different things depending on the kind of music. In a jazz/rock kind of setting, where this usually comes up, I firmly believe the best way to think of a mode is a scale that has a special relationship with another scale. \n\nAs a result I sometimes find myself saying \"Dorian scale\", not \"Dorian mode\". The Dorian scale (D E F G A B C, say, with tonic D) is just another scale, *not* a special kind of thing called a \"mode\". It just happens to be a mode of the Major scale, a fact that may or may not be interesting or useful to you. But you probably want to learn / use the Dorian, if you do at all, because of its own qualities, not because of this rather technical relationship it has with another scale that, after all, doesn't sound very much like it.\n\nI should say this has no *historical* validity but I think it's probably the most useful one for practical musicians outside the classical / \"early music\" world. I do my best to explain the approach concisely in the first chapter of [my free guitar scales ebook](http://ia601204.us.archive.org/21/items/ScaleAndArpeggioResourcesAGuitarEncyclopedia/Scale-and-Arpeggio-Resources--A-Guitar-Encyclopedia.pdf) and more slowly in the first of [these lectures](http://cochranemusic.com/scale-theory-music-course). \n\n[EDIT: various attempts at clarification.]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376061943", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, those b3 and b6 are minor. As for what key you are in compared to the chords, it really depends on how many chords you have in that particular section/song. A general rule of thumb is that the first chord in a song is your key. This is not always the case, but its a good place to start.\n\nHere's an example to identify keys:\n\nLet's say we have a 2 chord progression going on, a C Major and a G Major. Now one could say that we are in C Major, or we could say we are in G Major. Technically, both are correct, as there are not enough notes to specify the exact key. Now, we switch to a different section of the same song. In addition to our CM and our GM, we have now introduced a D Major chord. Knowing our G Major scale (G a b C D e f# G), we can see that the G, C, and D notes all form the major chords within this scale. So we can conclude this song is in G Major.\n\nBut what if instead of that D Major, we had an F Major? This makes the 3 chords C F and G Major. Knowing our C Major scale (C d e F G a b C), we can see that C F and G make up the Major chords of the scale, and thus makes thee key C Major.\n\n(Edit: G Major now has an F#)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376120201", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Right but you did not explain what to do over dominant chords. All Western music is about going back to tonic - so the movement like G7 resolving to C is where most dramatic opportunities are. And yes you can use G Mixolydian over G7 and then C Ionian over C and be done but that is plain vanilla - you did not play anything else but notes from C major in the process. A better approach is to treat dominant chord as if it was altered (had b5 or #5 or b9 or #9). And play scale over it that would contain such altered tones (G Mixolydian obviously does not have them). That would heighten the tension and provide stronger outline for G7 to C resolution. It is usually referred as playing \"outside\". \n\nGreat guitarist and teacher Emily Remler had a very nice \"thumb\" rule:\n\n0.A dominant chord in a progression may resolve to tonic or not\n\n1.If the dominant 7th chord is NOT resolving play the jazz minor scale starting from the 5th note\n\n2.If the dominant 7th chord IS resolving play the jazz minor scale starting from the flat 2nd note\n\nOk so first the jazz minor scale:\nThe jazz minor scale is the ascending melodic minor scale used both ascending and descending. It may be produced from the major scale by flattening the third scale degree,\n\nMajor scale: R 2 3 4 5 6 7 R \n\nJazz minor: R 2 m3 4 5 6 7 R\n\nOk so now lets look at following progression:\n\nCmaj7. G7 Dm7 G7 Cmaj7\n\nIt contains G7 in first non-resolving context ten in resolving one.  Move Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 is called 2-5-1 and is building block of much of music. Lets look (for brevity) what happens in this situation (G7 resolving to C). \n\nOver Dm7 you play Dorian mode of C or D Dorian scale: D E F G A B C.\n\nNothing too exciting here - you just play reorganized C scale\n\nOver G7 you play jazz minor scale starting from the flat 2nd note.  \n\nSo play jazz minor in Ab.\n\nLets build it. \n\nFirst A major:  A B C# D E F# G# A. \n\nNow we flatten 3rd to create Jazz minor in A: A B C D E F# G# A. \n\nNow flatten all tones to get Jazz minor in Ab: Ab Bb B Db Eb F G Ab\n\nLets examine tones in that scale from perspective of original G7 chord: G B D F\n\nNote that scale contains: G B F (3rd and flat 7th of G so it contains notes essential to G7 sound - 5th is often said to be more of color tone and you can usually skip it. but R, 3rd and seventh of a chord are essential to establish if it it major, minor or dominant chord and must always be included. That is why in a band situation you can alway get away with comping 3rd and 7th (bass usually takes care of the root). \n\nSo what about Ab an Bb - with respect to G those are b9 and #9. \n\nAnd finally: Db and Eb those are b5 and #5 wrt to G.\n\nSo once again whole scale:\n\nAb (b9), Bb (#9), B (3), Db (b5), Eb (#5), F (b7), G (R)\n\nSo by playing that scale over G7 resolving to C you outline G7 and all possible ALTERATIONS of G7 - flat and sharp 5th and flat and sharp 9th. Those notes come from outside of C scale and provide stronger resolution to C. \n\nFinal question is - is it really necessary - could somebody just say \"outline altered G7 chord\"?  Yes. Probably so - especially since in jazz situation you would play sth like G7b5#9 anyway instead of G7 (323444). But saying \"play jazz minor scale from flat second\" sure sound smarter and a bit shorter. \n\nAnyways- hope it is helpful. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376156039", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Her stuff can be easily contested, and if she's caught by anyone in the jungle she should run: her shield, although good in delivering damage and punishment, takes an heavy toll on her mana.\nThat's not to say you can't fight with people, you can fight people, but it's a big risk I learned not to take.\n\nHowever, as stated, she's quick and safe, and as already said (below :P ) she's a **great objective contester**.\nThis goes for buffs too, either yours or the enemies'.\n**Go in, take stuff, get out**, you are faster than most junglers (think Amumu).\nSince the 3.1 changes, **taking small buff monsters is beneficial** since the exp has been split throughout the whole camp, so AoE is welcome.\n\nYour first clears will be devoted to ding 6 as soon as possible. \n**Ganking does not play on your strengths**, and it's **heavily reliant on who your laners are**. If the chance arises however you could try and take E at level three, and go gank a lane.\nYou don't offer much other than damage, so it's hit and miss. Be content with a **Flash being burned**: it most likely **won't be up by the time you get your ult**.\n\nAs for the item build goes, I read [ESVDiamond's exhaustive rundown](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1jticw/champion_discussion_of_the_day_diana_6th_of/cbi6wp1) in this thread, and kind of agree with what he stated.\nI'd like to give a different take on gear, as most of the stuff has already been said around the thread.\nJust a quick thing tho: **Seekers' Armguards** and **Haunting Guise** (or **Doran Ring**s if behind) are really core on her while entering the midgame. I never really liked Sheen, but decided to try it in the future.\nYou could guess it by my suggestions, however I'd like to point out that, as it is for any jungler, **cost efficiency is the name of the game**.\n\nSo, **gear**! and, coming from an ex-WoW player, that basically breaks down to **stats**.\n\n**Cooldown Reduction** (**CDR** from here) is good, but not good enough early game to warrant rushing it. Her mana isn't that great, and if comboing faster makes or breaks teamfight,s a **wiser mana management** will make you a better player.\nHonorable mention for the **Elixir of Brilliance**: this stuff wins games. If you can afford it, you should always try tro buy one. It makes you **considerably stronger** for the price you're paying it.\nAnd of course, for **Nashor's Tooth** too, since it greatly enhances her pushing and dueling in general.\nThis is not to say you shouldn't ever purchase CDR, but that you need the mana to back it up.\n\n**Health** is good, but not great. It makes you **more sturdy**, but **your W does that already** as long as you can manage its cooldown and usefulness as a damage tool.\nThe only health you should ever purchase comes from Dorans and Guise anyway.\nSince I mentioned W, I feel like I should mention that due to the way it works (**if all three spheres detonate** the shield gets its duration and absorption **refreshed**) Diana **scales way better with resistances** than with flat health.\n\n**Magic resist** (**MR** from here) can be a tricky one. Sometimes you will not need it, sometimes you will need it desperately to survive that aoe slugfest that's the teamfight, or the occasional focus fire from their AP.\n**Abyssal Scepter** is one of the end all be all items for Diana. However I feel like it's less important than others, namely **Zhonya**. Thus, one of your best purchases for MR and one of your best bets is the Negatron Cloak. You can sit on it for a little or can straight out rush the full item.\n\n**Armor** comes from one of your cores, Zhonya. It's less of an issue, but sometimes situation could call for more.\n\n**Tenacity** is worth mentioning since ccs can screw you over, but you'll never be constantly against a Blitz/ Lissandra/ Thresh/ Volibear team (worst game of my life). However, given the most common (and optimal) Tenacity choice comes with MR too, you could just opt for Mercury Threads as your boots of choice.\n\n**Attack speed** (**ASpeed** from here) is good, feels really good, but due to its multiplicative scaling and the fact that you are probably running an healthy 17% or so (I'm bad at math) from runes and masteries, continuously buying it makes it **less efficient as it grows**.\nThe only ASpeed item you should ever need is the Nashor's. Or Malady if you were behind. I miss Malady, I swear.\n\nAnd now for the goodies:\n**Magic penetration** (**MPen** from here) is a great and cheap way to enhance your damage early, especially of **your passive and shield** given their **great base values**.\nAs stated by [TardisTechnologist](http://www.reddit.com/user/TardisTechnologist) in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1jticw/champion_discussion_of_the_day_diana_6th_of/cbi6cp8) comment, Haunting Guise gets outperformed by Abyssal, however it's more cost efficient. HOWEVER^2 , it should be sold come endgame for a Void Staff.\n\n**Ability power** (**AP** from here) is an awesome stat.\nOf course it enhances your damage, but the main thing is that **Diana double dips with AP** because of her W, thus **getting survivability out of an offensive stat**.\nThere are a lot of debates about damage per se when comparing a Rabadon to a Void Staff, but none of those matters to the moon lady, because of this one reason. AP and resistances are hella good on her, and Void is good, but in most cases. not good enough to warrant a rush.\n\nTo close this whole stat rambling, as a jungle Diana (and as a jungler in general) **you have to know in which part of the game is better to allocate given quantities of gold**, transitioning from cost efficiency to overall efficiency as the game progresses.\nA small example I can give, wards aside, are **potions**. Both health and mana are extremely cost efficient, **and mana potions especially**, given that **your Q and E cost remain constant** throughout their levels.\nA single mana potion gives back almost two Qs worth of mana, a full level W, a full level ult or an E. And that's a lot.\n\nAbout Machete: I feel **the best upgrade you can have in most cases is Madreds**.\nYou get **cheap armor** out of it, and its passive synergises well with your own passive's %ASpeed.\nOf course Wriggles is not worth the upgrade, and should you arrive 6 slot endgame you'd better sell the Razers.\nThere will be cases in which you will have to **just sell the Machete**, or you could simply find yourself **not needing it as a start item**. It really comes to personal preference.\n\nAbout the combos, I read a lot and all of them have been discussed, but I really feel that to **maximise your damage **you **need to wait your second Q**.\n**Q W R E Q R R** will straight out kill squishies, or zone them out of the fight.\n\nOf course, this is the scenario in which you can fulfill the role of the assassin. If you have to take a **more supportive approach**, you will have to **ult** without a second thought and **with no Q opener**. \nJust **R in, E** and from there good luck.\nThe good thing is that an opening like that will give you means to clean out. \nDiana can clean out if there's no MVP to absolutely eliminate/ have out of the way, but this requires more Q and R management than I'm able to manage, so can't really give tips on that.\n\nTo wrap up, jungling Diana requires you to have knowledge.\nKnow your **role** and what your team needs you to do,\nKnow your **build**,\nKnow **what you need**,\nKnow **how to spend your gold** in the most optimal way.\nAnd that's basically it.\n\nEDIT:\nSome formatting and an important correction.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376163171", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Any good cait will make sure that vayne is not close to her, and will make sure that vayne cannot get condemns off. At level 3 there is a maybe, when cait has only one level into her Q. But when you say they you can beat cait in a fight with a cc support, your assuming that you have not been poked much yet, with is highly unprobable. Then once cait has more than one level into her Q, she can outtrade with: aa aa Q aa. But yes, at about 20 minutes, assuming vayne is even with cait in cs/kills, she will win. And about ashe, I think ashe can poke cait more if she dodges her Q. Cait's Q is easy to dodge due to the cast time, so if you can dodge it and get a few volleys in, you will outpoke cait. Needless to say volley is nearly impossible to dodge.

A mode is in fact a scale, but calling it that means that's derived from another scale (most commonly the major scale) by starting on a different note. For example C major is C D E F G A B C. But if you start on D, you get the D Dorian mode: D E F G A B C D. You can apply this same process to get modes of any scale (like the melodic minor, or the harmonic minor), but the modes of the major scale are the most common and most well-known.\n\nModal jazz was essentially a reaction against the blazing tempos and harmonic complexity of bebop. They slowed everything down and sat on just one chord at a time for long stretches of time, allowing the soloist and band to explore a single scale rather than moving between multiple ones at breakneck speed.\n\n(There's a lot of oversimplification in there, but hey, you said ELI5)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376265160", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 43, "controversiality": 0}

Whether it be in naming, spacial orientation, embryological origins, origins, insertions, etc. More times than not, you are able to determine some sort of pattern. Once you do, you can memorize them so much more easier.\n3. **Compartmentalize**. Get in the habit of breaking down anatomy to small bits. It's easier to digest and memorize. The prime example is head and neck. Probably the toughest area but once you split things down into small sections it becomes much more bearable (e.g. pterygopalatine fossa, infratemporal fossa, base of the cranium, etc). Sounds silly, but in terms of processing and retention it works wonders.\n3. **Get your ass in the lab**. If you are lucky enough to have access to cadavers, then use them. There is seriously no better way to learn anatomy than by touching, seeing and doing.\n4. **Demo the anatomy to your peers**. Take turns with peers you trust and teach each other a section of the body. If you are comfortable and confident enough to teach it then you know it.\n5. **Resources**. Use what you need to.

{"body": "I suggest you start writing a song in C major. It is the easiest since it only contain chords and notes played on the white keys on a piano, C D E F G A B (and on the guitar you don't have to play ANY barre chords!). The C major key have a minor friend, A minor (the parallel key) , which contain the same notes and chords, but contain more minor chords and will mostly start out on A minor chord instead of C major chord.\n\nThe C major/A minor keys have chords that are made up of C D E F G A B, and the notes you can play in these two keys are also CDEFGAB (a basic C major scale).\n\nThe C major chord consist of C, E and G, while F major chord consist of F, A and C, etc.\n\nThe song can be spiced up with notes and chords and chord additions that are outside of CDEFGAB, but I suggest you start simple and omit it for now.\n\nIn C major/A minor key these are the normal chords used:\n\nC major - F major - G major (normally spiced with an added F note making it a G7 chord) - A minor - D minor - E minor (E major 7 is a  normal spice but it contain a note that is outside of CDEFGAB, that is G#). Note that all the notes in the C major scale/A minor scale (CDEFGAB) have a chord named after it, except B: C(major) D(minor) E(minor) F(major) G(major) and A(minor). The song normally start out with the C major or A minor chord and from that you can transition to whatever sounds good (C -&gt; Am -&gt; F -&gt; G perhaps). The more notes two chords share the more \"fluent\" the transition will sound. For example going from C major chord to A minor chord will sound very \"fluent\" since they both share the C note and the E note. C major chord to F major chord will also \"flow\" since they both contain the root note C. \n\nSo let us say your song consist of three chords only: C major for 2 bars, then F major for 1 bar and then G major for 1 bar. Then back to C major and loop the pattern until the end of song.\n\nThe first note in the first bar will most likely will be a note in the C major chord, that is a C, E or G note. After that note you can roam freely along the C major/A minor scale notes CDEFGAB during the duration of the 2 bar C major chord. After 2 bars of C major chord the F major chord will arrive. Here it will sound good with a note that belong to the F major chord, i.e. F or A or C. The you can roam around until the G major chord bar. Here it will sound good if your play a note that belong to the G major chord, G or B or D, and the keep roaming.\n\nBasically, when you change chord, the first note ought to belong to the chord that you play, the rest of the time you can roam around CDEFGAB (if it sounds good!).\n\nAfter you've done some easy songs in C major/A minor, I suggest you try to make a song in G major/E minor. It contain almost the same notes as C major/A minor but instead of CDEFGAB the notes are GABCDEF#. The only different note is F# instead of F, and the first chord normally is a G major or E minor. The chords used in the G major/E minor keys consist of the GABCDEF# notes and are: G major - C major - D major - E minor - A minor - B minor.\n\nHave a look at the Circle of Fifths (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths). If you look at C major/A minor you will note that the closest neighbors are F major, G major, D minor, E minor. The further you get away from the root in the circle, the more unlikely it is the chord will fit in the said key. \n\nDo you use any instrument when you compose songs?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376414456", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; But is there anything more to it other than just finding what sounds good?\n\nIMHO pretty much the entirety of music theory is just the study of musical patterns that have certain understandable effects. If you want those effects (and most do) you can use it as a guide to get them. Violating the rules tends to sound jarring, dissonant, or awkwardly juxtaposed. But these can be useful properties. You'll notice I didn't say \"bad.\"\n\n&gt; also how do I know which chord voicings to use (is that the right term, like suspended, augmented and inversions etc)\n\nI don't have enough theory background to tell you if you're using the right words, but you're using the same ones I use :) Choosing chord voicings is a matter of taste and practicality. As you go between two chords, you can think of each individual note in those chords \"shifting\" to a note in the next chord. Sometimes it's pleasant to minimize those distances, especially if they're played by different instruments, so you'll choose the inversion that keeps the notes close together. For example, I like to write groovy head-noddy music. Say I'm going from C major to G major. If I played both chords in root position, it'd go from the notes C-E-G (thats C major) to the notes G-B-D (the G major chords):\n\n      C   E   G \n              G   B   D\n\nBut in my style of music, I think it sounds more natural to use the second inversion of G major, so you go to B-D-G instead, thus grouping the notes closer together. Instead of the whole shape shifting up, you can think of the C and E notes just shifting down one scale position:\n\n      C   E   G\n    B   D     G\n\nI find I often choose voicings like this since I like their cohesion. But when I'm doing something more euphoric or bombastic, maybe I'll choose something else. Maybe I'll 2nd-invert the C instead, and play the G in root position, so both chords have the G note as the root, and I can play that with a rhythmic bassline. I just experiment until I have a voicing I like.\n\nSuspensions are a bit different in that you're actually changing one of the notes in the chord, moving the 3rd to either the 4th or 2nd position. Again, though, I like to experiment with them wherever I can. I love the sound of sus2, sus4, and add9 chords so I try them constantly.\n\n&gt; Also what are the different scale modes and how do I use them? Like Dorian and Lydian?\n\nIf you think of a given scale as a set of notes, then the different modes are the different patterns you'd made by starting at different points in that scale.\n\nLet's take C Ionian, AKA the C major scale, since the notation is easier without sharps or flats:\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n\nWhat if you took the same notes but started on a different point? How about we start on \"A\"?\n\n    A B C D E F G A\n\nThis is the \"Aeolian\" mode, AKA the natural minor scale. So this set of notes in that order would sound like A minor. \n\nEvery separately-named point you could start on constitutes one of the modes. They all have names and I have to look them up every time. Each of them has its own \"feel.\" So what's cool about that is that you've got 7 named notes you can use as roots, and now 7 possible modes you can play with for each root. Using music theory you can learn the different flavors of the different modes and wield those moods for your music. \n\nThis was a lot of words but I hope that helped explain it a bit!\n\nEDIT: if anyone with any proper music training spots a problem, please do correct me.

{"body": "I'm going to do my best to keep this simple and as compact as possible while packing it full of info for you :)\n\nModes are essentially a more advanced or, rather, more complete understanding of keys.  (That's by today's definition, look at the Wikipedia page on modes and you'll see that the concept has changed a lot over the last 4 or 5 hundred centuries.)\n\nThe keys are based on this pattern of \"steps\":\n\nW W H W W W H\n\nWhere:\nW(hole) - 2 semitones \nH(alf) - 1 semitone \n\nThat pattern is considered \"circular\" since it obviously repeats as you continue up in pitch. (C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C ...)\n\nEach of the different modes is simply a starting place within that pattern:\n\n1 - Ionian (commonly called the major scale) - W W H W W W H \n2 - Dorian - W H W W W H W \n3 - Phrygian - H W W W H W W \n4 - Lydian - W W W H W W H \n5 - Myxolydian - W W H W W H W \n6 - Aeolian (commonly called the natural minor scale) - W H W W H W W \n7 - Locrian - H W W H W W W \n\nSo, what a key is is a root/tonic and a mode.  Peruse /r/musictheory and you'll see question like \"What key is this piece in?\" with answers like \"D Dorian\" or \"E Phrygian\".  Once you pick those you can work out the notes/key signature of your key (which notes are natural, flat, or sharp).\n\nNow, this means that different keys share key signatures!  You probably already know about major (Ionian) scales and their relative minors (Aeolian), e.g.  For example,\n\nF major (Ionian): F G A Bb C D E \nD minor (Aeolian): D E F G A Bb C\n\nalso share the same key signature with G Dorian:\n\nG A Bb C D E F\n\n(Aside: the notes that fit in the key are called \"diatonic\", and those that don't are called \"non-diatonic\".)\n\nSo, what's the point?  If they share the same key signature what's the difference?  Two things:\n\nTonic:  The letter in the key name.  This is your home note.  This is where your piece is constantly moving away from and returning to.\n\nPrimary v. auxiliary triads: The 1, 4, and 5 chords (e.g. C, F, and G in C major) are the primary triads and the others are the auxiliary, or supporting, triads.  With regards to the primary triads: The 1 (tonic) makes obvious sense, since that's the home chord, and and the 4 and 5 triads are primary because they are the chords farthest from the 1 while still sharing a note (common tone) with the 1!  Hopefully, you can see that by using different tonics different sets of chords built from a given key signature fit those roles.  This gives pieces written in the various modes different harmonic characteristics, or \"sounds\" (e.g. people often say that Dorian tends to sound melancholy).\n\nSo, that's the basics of modes, which is really a more full understanding of key.  \n\nOf course, you don't have to stick to that and there are lots of common variations.  You've probably heard of \"harmonic minor\" before.  What's that about?  Well, let's look at the primary triads in the natural minor (Aeolian mode). (If you've ever looked at what chord progressions I'm sure you've seen I IV V in the major scale...)  In A minor those would be the first, fourth, and fifth chords built from the notes of the scale: Am (A C E), Dm (D F A), and Em (E G B).  The strongest \"chordal\" motion that can get you back to the tonic chord is from the fifth (dominant) chord.  However, when the fifth is a minor chord it doesn't sound as quite strong, or definitive, as when it is a major chord because it doesn't have the leading tone (the note one half step/semitone below the tonic note).  So, the \"harmonic minor\" is when you raise the 7th degree *when building the fifth (and sometimes others...) chord* so that it is major.  In A minor that would mean making G sharp so that the Em chord become an E major chord with E G# B.  The important thing to realize here is that this doesn't really change the key -- you don't put a sharp on the G line of the staff's key signature because you're only using the G# when building chords, when played in a melody you might still use G natural.\n\nI could keep going on this, of course, with other variations like the melodic minor or Phrygian Dominant, but I'm guessing that's plenty to digest already.\n\nNote that all of this is part of what's known as \"western\" music theory.  Other cultures often have entirely different systems using different whole/half step patterns, more or less notes per octave, or whatever.\n\nI will comment on one more thing:  What's the point of *all* of it?  You'll often hear people say, \"Music theory is just a bunch of rules that you don't have to follow anyway, so why bother learning it?\"  Instead of thinking of music theory as a bunch of rules think of it as an understanding of the built-in *structure* of the harmonic pitch system we use.  When you choose a key, and everything that goes along with it (tonic, diatonic notes, primary/secondary triads, etc.), as providing a skeleton from which to work from you're free to add or remove arms or legs (note, chords, etc.) or even change it's color or head (key changes?) as you see fit Mr. Potato Head-style, but without that skeleton you're just slapping random appendages onto an amorphous blob of skin and organs.  How attractive would that be?  For an analogy, when an artist wants to draw a person (or whatever), they don't just start throwing paint at a canvas or randomly scribbling on paper hoping they get what they want, they start with certain key elements or shapes and fill in the details.  Yes, those who have been doing it for a while (or some prodigies) can just go straight to drawing nothing but the exact features of the face they see in their head, but they've already spent a lot of time working with the structures and shapes behind the end product such that they simply don't have to draw an oval before drawing a face anymore.  They still *use* the oval, they just don't have to draw it anymore.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376510125", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Some of the best salmon farms are in your region!\n\nWhat about shrimp?  \n\nHalibut! mmmmmm\n\nThe BEST piece of advice I could give you is to find a good fishmonger.    \n\n\nIf you're looking to expand your horizons.... instead of looking to create entire meals based on a single protein being \"the star of the show\" consider taking a different approach. \n\nMake very small portions of a type of fish and cut it into little bites and serve as an appetizer or a side dish.   This way the fish is an accompaniment. It makes some more work for you,  this is true,  but it takes a HUGE burden off that piece of fish (which is likely to be more expensive than chicken or pork in any case) _and_ yourself.   \n\nYou won't feel anywhere near as much burden to \"like it\" because it is so expensive. Your expectations can be one of exploration rather than \"damn I hope I like this because it is the mainstay of my evening meal\".\n\nI think in our modern society we've spoiled ourselves.   We have sewer systems, off-site garbage disposal, the majority of our people know to shower and use soap daily.... we dont' run into \"off\" smells. So, things like fish which naturally have a stronger smell (even when fresh) are sometimes considered unpalatable.   There are some ingredients in this world which are damned near irreplaceable that smell H O R R I B L E   but are worth tolerating  (or keeping your nose away).  For example... fish sauce.  It is absolutely necessary for Vietnamese and Thai cooking (and don't let anyone tell you soy sauce is an acceptable replacement,  it is not) it smells just disgusting, but it adds a certain something that is imperative for the cuisine!   \n\nI'm rambling, I'm sure.  I suppose what I'm trying to get across is,  one reason people don't like fish is because it doesn't smell \"as good\" as chicken or beef.... and I think that's just wrong-thinking.  Fish_does_ smell as good,  but it smells good in its own way.  Some folks (perhaps yourself) just haven't trained your nose/brain to accept it as such (not saying it's your fault, but something that IS possible to overcome).\n\n\nIn some ways, I am jealous of your forward path.

This is considered a constant.  \nU: Is the electrical potential difference or voltage, which is a measure of how 'willing' the electrons are to move and is expressed in volts [V].  \nI: Is the current, which is a measure of how many electrons move at the same time (sort of) and is expressed in ampere or amps [A].  \n\nIf we take the effect formula and substitue U for I x R as seen in the voltage formula we get.\n\nP=I x I x R or P=I^2 x R\n\nFrom this we can see that if you double the current, the energy used is quadrupled. \n\nSo why do we use high-voltage transmission lines?\nLets take another look at the voltage formula.

{"body": "Kind of a long inquiry here, but any feedback would be much appreciated! \n\nMy main guitar is an American Deluxe Strat HSS w/ S-1 switching system. A couple years ago I swapped out all the stock SCN pickups (single coil neck, single coil middle, humbucker bridge) and implemented a DeArmond Gold Foil in the neck, Lace Sensor Blue in the Middle, and Lace Sensor Dually Red at the bridge. Basically made myself a Dan Auerbach / Jonny Greenwood hybrid. \n\nI've enjoyed this setup and haven't had any problems with it, but as time passes I've considered some alternatives. Lately I've been playing more heavy rock/metal (B.R.M.C., Sabbath) but also some alt rock, incorporating finger-picking (Dessner brothers of The National) and clear-ringing distortion (Brian Jonestown Massacre) and still enjoying Black Keys and Radiohead styles. I know is all over the place, but CAN IT BE DONE?! One guitar to appease my frenetic sonic palette?! Which brings me to an idea...\n\nI have a Custom Shop Epi SG with two '57 Classic (Zebra) Humbuckers that I love the sound of, and I'm pondering swapping out the Lace Red Dually with one of '57's and adding a gold cover. Does the cover alter the tone/output? \n\nAdditionally, I'm considering swapping out the Blue Lace with the remaining '57 and effectively having a H H S setup with the S-1 system. Any thoughts on this potential switch? Might having a humbucker in both the bridge and middle change/impair the functionality of the S-1 system? Would I need to change the stock pots from the Strat?\n\nWhat would you expect to be the major differences in sound between the various setups? Any other recommended arrangements, or using different pickups I didn't mention here like the wide range mentioned in your post? \n\nThank you!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376653976", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't get this, who the fuck keeps telling these people that rice will absorb water from a modern electronic device.  Rice only absorbs water when it TOUCHES water, and the evaporation required for the water to reach the rice could take weeks or without the right temperature months because of how naturally sealed electronics often are to keep out dust.  Old electronics that had crappy seals or very small things like pagers SOMETIMES worked with rice after a long time, but smart phones, Hard Drives and Vitas do not.\n\nUse rubbing alcohol, and not the watered down stuff you need 95% or higher, the nearly pure stuff.  douse a Q-Tip in it and start rubbing anywhere there is water, the alcohol will bind to it and evaporate almost instantly.  If its not evaporating you got the watered down crap.  This is your vita were talking about, splurge the extra dollar or two for the alcohol -_-.\n\nAnyways you are probably fucked for not getting rid of the water before using it again.  The device probably works when plugged in because your vita gets more current (amps) when plugged in then it does just off the battery which is allowing the voltage to push through the corroded lines or shorts you may have caused by turning it on wet.  Use the Rubbing alcohol technique I just mentioned until every single drop of water is gone, then do it again because its probably still not dry.  \n\nAfter that check the circuit board and all connections (including battery and button spots) for any burn marks, corrosion, water, shorts, etc.  Anything that is obviously not green circuit board and silver solder.  If you find any burns or corrosion, try to remove it using alcohol and if that doesn't work, use something soft to scrape the offending material off (steel wool or very fine sandpaper works well, but you need to be careful and very light on the abrasion as not to destroy the connections, board or solder).  Chances are you will destroy the board by scraping it, but honestly your fucked anyways so be careful and roll with it.  With buttons already not working the chances of this fixing your issue is all based on whether its a connection issue or a chip/part issue.  If you burnt out something in the chips, screwed a resistor, blew a capacitor, etc your SOL, but if its just a bit of corrosion or a messed up connection you might be able to save it.\n\nYour light is most definitely an issue with shorting or corrosion since it still works but O N L Y if what you are saying is correct.  If the light is intermittent its not burnt out, so its a connection issue (burnt out lights believe it or not.....don't work).  The blue light (sleep mode light) you never once mentioned so that might be burnt out or you simply forgot to mention that one (The PS button does both orange and blue, blue is when in sleep from tapping power button once, it kinda fades in and out occasionally and i think lights up for some other reasons i don't remember).\n\nLastly, don't ever fucking turn on a device after it gets wet unless you immediately remove the battery and dry/clean it with alcohol.

{"body": "I was going to comment on your OP but it seems more relevant to address it to you here.\n\nThis is VERY much a case-by-case sort of thing, also what I'm about to explain would be MUCH easier in-person, but I'll do my best.\n\nWhat you want to consider is that there are THREE ways of moving your hand from one spot to another, as detailed below:\n\n1. The simplest is to pick your hand up, and set it down somewhere else. This isn't always as accurate as you lose contact with the keys more or less. It's also not really an option if you need to play all the notes legato, because there's no way to do it without a break in the notes as your hand is in the air. So it's only really used between phrases, or maybe in conjunction with the pedal.\n\n2. Slightly more complicated, is simply stretching. When your hand is \"closed\" you have access to five neighboring keys. However, you can stretch your hand to physically cover a lot more keys, even though you can't press them all at once. So if you need to reach a high note and your pinky can reach for it, go for it! If you have to keep playing up high after that, reach with your pinky and then contract your hand so that your other fingers join your pinky up there.\n\n3. The most complicated one is used in order to play scales smoothly, so if you've practiced your scales with proper fingering, you're used to this. It's called \"crossing\" a finger under or over another finger. The easiest way to show this is to use the example of a scale, as I said. So you're playing the Cmaj scale with your left hand. The notes are C D E F G A B C. You start with your pinky, finger number five, and you play the first five notes of the scale with all of your fingers. Well at this point you're at a dead-end because you need to keep going up but you just used your thumb, the last finger available. Well, you cross finger number THREE (middle finger) OVER your pointer and thumb, and press the next note with it. Then you slide your pointer and thumb underneath finger number three's new position, and finish the scale with them. So the fingering looks like this: 5 4 3 2 1 3 2 1. You can see where the switch happened. This technique is useful for playing legato.\n\nIf you still feel fuzzy about where/when to use these, specific examples would probably help. So if you were to show me things where you're having trouble I could explain what you will want to do, and why!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376716317", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're right absolutely right bro - and I'm sure a lot of people as soon as they read this will crunch their eyebrows - well he is right. Whether you like it or not. HOWEVER...hear me out.\n\nI love Cricket, I can watch it all day; but my favorite team recently has sucked monkey balls. Hell they've been blamed of fixing games, they are overweight, don't train hard enough, their fielding sucks, they can't catch a ball for shit and half of them think they're the best players in the world. It pisses the shit out of me because I know what they're doing is wrong and they know what they're doing is wrong - and they find plenty of excuses to justify their lack of professionalism, abysmal performance and just plain ignorance for how to be good at the game. Doesn't make me hate cricket any less though - when I play, I still strive to be perfect. I still practice my hardest, apply absolutely everything when I play from everything I've learnt in the over 18 years I've been playing this game. Its the same damn concept. \n\nMuslims - in today's world - are fucked up [no, there is no need to tone down the language..i'm calling it for what it is]. We are hypocrites. We let people walk all over us. We are always on the defensive. We turn a blind eye to the millions of crimes committed in the name of Islam everyday .. even though we know it's all wrong. We are more concerned with how we'll be perceived than our actions and words. We let the people who don't practice our religion like its aught to be speak for us to the rest of the world. Our response to any violence in the name of Islam is a barrage of excuses as to how its a reaction of 'anti-muslim policies' or a meek 'oh thats not how it is supposed to be - that isn't us'. Yet we do NOTHING to change it. We'll protest with a million people when someone makes a movie on our Prophet, but when a Muslims bomb mosques, we just click on the next news headline, when the 'holy mecca' of Islam doesn't let women drive, we say it 'doesn't represent the rest of us' and go on about our business. We wear western clothes, have western educations, watch western TV shows, yet take a stab at the west at every chance we get. We attack each other, judge each other based on 'what shes wearing' and are open to tell someone 'you're not a Muslim' when we fully know we have NO RIGHT TO JUDGE who is and who isn't. We pick and choose what we want from the Qu'ran - and then we'll make ourselves feel better by justifying it. \n\nWe can't even agree on the same dates for Eid or Ramadan. We dont forge an identity based on religion, but based on what country we are from. We 'hate the west' but flock to it like a retired priest goes to a strip club. And when people attack us - we call them bigots and ignorant. HAH! At least they are not hypocrites!! \n\nThere have been over 1,000 deaths of muslims alone in the span of 30 days; and now you'll ask me 'oh yah where?' - :) THAT is exactly the problem! But fucking Sandy hook happens and we're the first to go on our twitter feeds blessing the dead kids and praying 'i hope the shooter wasn't muslim'. We have all the time to sit on the internet and type out how beautiful Islam is- yet we can't even say 'have a nice day' to the person who just served us at the cashier, or a 'peace be upon you brother' when passing another Muslim in the streets. It's okay to hate the jews, but GOD FORBID we speak up against the rampant pedophiles that scourge the Muslim world. 1400 years after the completion of the best guidance from God, and we're still silent on Imam's fucking little children (sounds harsh right?...imagine how the kids feel), men beating their wife and tribes banning women from going to school. IF THERE IS ONE MUSLIM who is being treated unjustly, it is the DUTY of every muslim to stand up against that injustice. SO before we protest about drone strikes, we must protest why women in the Tribal areas of Pakistan aren't allowed to go to school (oh shut up...they ARE NOT allowed to go to school - and you and i both know it). \n\nI can continue and go on and on and on but Fuck it. I'm done. I know I'm gonna be told 'oh what makes u so great' and the rampant attacks on anyone who speaks out against the greatest injustice done to our religion by ourselves, but I will include myself in these observations. My language will be criticized, but my message will not be heard..because 'i was too harsh'. Fucking deal with it or move along - quote me a verse or two..but don't you dare go out there and physically make a difference. That would take too much time eh?\n\nWe have strayed from the path of unity, tolerance and peace by a long way. And unless we go out into the REAL world and make a difference - nothing is going to change. N O T H I N G . Allah does not help people until they do not help themselves first. I love my Religion, but I am disgusted with its 'followers' because they are the worst example in history of how it's supposed to be practiced.\n\nSalaam Alaykum", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376720950", "subreddit": "islam", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The order of the notes *generally* doesn't matter in determining what chord something is, except for the bass note.  If you change the bass note, you're using an inversion, which could end up as a different chord in a different context.  For example, A C E G is an Am7, but C E G A might be a C6 rather than an Am7 in first inversion.  So F A C and F C A are the same, but F A C is in **closed position**, since the notes are as close as possible, and F C A is in **open position**, since there is space between the chord tones for other chord tones (between the F and C you could stick an A, for instance).  Open position often sounds very pretty, but that depends on context too.\n\nSometimes the order of the notes does matter, especially for complicated chords.  The ear doesn't do a great job of parsing complex structures and looks for shortcuts like fifths; if there's a fifth somewhere, it'll try to make that its own thing.  You might end up with a polychord -- different chords stacked on top of each other -- in one voicing and with a simpler structure otherwise.  For example, a Cmaj7#11 chord could be spelled C E G D F# (we're omitting the 7 in this voicing), but that's a D major chord on top of a C major chord.  If you spell it C E F# G D instead, you get a different character.\n\nUltimately, a chord progression leaves out a *lot* of details.  When you write \"I - vi - IV - V\", you're leaving out information about what octave things are in, what the rhythm is, what the individual voices are doing, how many individual voices there are, what the melody is, what instruments are playing, etc.  Each of these is an art.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376740339", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I'm German so it might be different in US. \n\nIt's very hard but rewarding. I'm doing a training in computer engineering, programming and everything that has something to do with computers. First off, I was told that maths is very important. Well, I can't really say that it's not important but it's also not one of the most needed things when it comes to computer science. Or at least I don't need it *that* much in my training. The usual numbers like 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 are easily remembered and boy, many things are based on them. So if you wanna do something like network administration then you'll need those numbers and you need to be able to add them together quickly in any combination. IP calculation is a hell of a thing, I learned it for about a half semester and I still have trouble with it because it's rather complicated. Nevertheless, it's very interesting to learn about how a networks communicates (OSI model). \n\nThen of course, there is the hardware part. When I started my training a year ago I knew nothing about how to build a computer from scratch. I had to learn how a processor and RAM (and all the other components) work and what they're made of. But hardware also includes stuff like \"why is the computer not working/what to do if...\". \n\nI was overwhelmed by the questions I got in my first semester (I need to complete 4) because I was new to that topic. Hardware and network is one of the driest topics in my opinion. You also have to learn about printers etc, basically everything about PCs and their Peripherals.\n\nMy favorite part is programming. I learned C++ as my first programming language and I loved it. Programming was the main reason why I joined my school, I want to create stuff and improve our everyday life. But I get sidetracked here. Programming languages are easy to learn. I think I am lucky that I began with c++ because other languages are pretty much the same. I also learned how to code in PHP and HTTP. \n\nThen there is also the theoretical part. I learned about Boolean algebra for the first time. Now, I am not sure if it's because of my teacher or because the topic is very complicated but I sometimes still have my trouble with it. It's basically how the heart of every PC works. If A and B are on, do C. The positive thing about this algebra is that it only works with 1 and 0, it's just logical thinking. Still, some things fuck my mind because they're easy and not easy to understand. It's like they're in a state of flux.\n\nOh and I also learned about the different Positional notations. Very interesting, especially the \"converting\" from one to another. This requires a bot more math, though it's mostly just + and - with (mostly) up to 3 numbers. And you also have to learn the meanings of A B C D E F in hex, it'll come in handy when you don't have much time and need to do some fast calculations. \n\nNow, I'm not exactly sure if this applies to every country but here in Germany we also get some commercial education. That's... not...very...entertaining... It's like a smash in the face to say the least. Project management is a hell of a thing, and that's just the beginning. Techniques to visualize something, rules to write texts and techniques for meetings are very important to learn here. How do I organize a project? What does my customer want? How do I convince him that he wants me to do the job? Those are questions that I'll be able to answer after this training. Or at least that's what I was told.\n\nAnother thing in my training is OS and Software. I've already gone through the office training (yep, learning how Word works takes some time). I had to hold some talks with powerpoint and write some bills, nothing special to be honest. Then there's SAP, some weird programm that business people use. Never really liked it, it's very complicated and not really what I'm gonna do later in my job. But wait, there's more! Shit will hit the fan next semester when I'll have to go through sharepoint and everything related to it.\n\nOf course I've got many other different classes. For example, I have english, german, sports and religion (meh on that one) classes as well. They're nothing special. I hate religion. And sports. Damn.\n\nThis all sounds veeeeeeery hard and boring. Would I swap with anyone if I could? Definitely no. I love what I'm doing. Even in the tough times it's still enjoyable and the knowledge I got in 1 year is already bigger than I got from my highschool (where I spent 5 years!). I'm looking forward to the next 2 semesters and my job, whatever it'll be. If I'm lucky then I may be able to study something like space engineering, but that's still in the distant future. I hope I was able to help you :)\n\nEdit: Oh and I had an E in my final Math exam. I'm doing fine now in my training, just to point out how \"hard\" and \"important\" it is ;) ^^I ^^really ^^suck ^^at ^^maths", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376779515", "subreddit": "technology", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No.  You can't have a sus4 and an augmented in the same chord.  Sus4 and Augmented are their own forms of triads, so it would be like calling a chord \"Cmajor minor.\"  It just doesn't make sense.  If we assume the **+** was an error, we can change it to the more reasonable **#** or **b**.  That way, it would just be an Esus4b13..but no, wait.  Unless you have \"add b13\" (instead of just b13), it's implied that it's a seven chord, but it can't be a seven chord (because it's a sus4 and if it's a 7sus4 it would explicitly say so) so I guess it's Esus4(add b13), but now that's the same note as a #5 and a sharp 5 is the augmented 5, but it's a sus4 chord so having a #5 (b13) without a 7 of any kind is just weird and all we really have now anyway is just E A B C which definitely sounds more like Am that it does any kind of E, especially a sus4 at that.

Observer B being at least two car lengths behind the whistle (engine and tender) will have negligible variance in the frequency due to height difference.\n\nThe further problem with this question is simple, trains have used multi-chime horns for more than 30 years AND when they did use whistles, the notch was located on the back - trailing - surface of the whistle and thus exposed to a drop in pressure when traveling at high speed.  73mph being fairly damned fast, I doubt the whistle was chiming below 450Hz relative to its own motion.\n\nSO, would you care to rephrase the question, professor, or would you like me to devise a way to get nine results in selecting two item combinations from the pool \" a a b b c c\"...

{"body": "I'm no expert but here's my take. Get a good and easy to play guitar, something that's comfortable. Should be light, and \"fit\" you well. You don't need to be a \"tough guy\" right away with a plywood acoustic that even Chuck Norris wouldn't be able to do a bar chord on.\n\nAlways remember that these things take time unless you're a prodigy or something, but even the greatest players most likely play guitar 8 hours a day (an assumption here, based on some friends of mine who became professional studio guitarists). Don't get discouraged, practice a little each day and learn right away to stretch your hands/wrists/fingers before playing, I think that's a good habit to learn. \n\nI sort of remember my beginnings (I was 12, now 36 at time of posting this). I bought a chord book (you'll find this online). I learnt the major open chords (E F G A B C D) then the minors (starting with Em, Am, Dm)... It's boring but you need to build that muscle memory. \n\nI'd say just do random chord progressions, then start learning songs. They will have different chords like Am7 or whatever. Don't fret (ha) just find the chord shapes online and learn it. It takes time but it's very rewarding at the end. Try to follow the recording, also there are tons of videos for all levels of players out there. Find the ones that work for you (teaching style, etc...)\n\nMain thing is to not give up! Find the time to practice and eventually you will see some progress. Even after all these years, I still sit down to a recording and try to learn a new song - it gets easier as you get older, trust me. \n\nGood luck and remember to practice. Also note, stop playing if anything other than your finger tips start to hurt. You don't want some sort of injury. Warm-ups and stretching will help a great deal. \n\n \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376951836", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

And if a few companies are too short to pay correctly their workers maybe they shouldn't actually run ? The economy should not be backed on even legal intendured servitude. If you can't pay your workers then you have no business running a company and making money on it.\n\n&gt;  The price of something is an emergent property of an extremely complex system - and the price cannot be reliably calculated\n\nBullshit. Most of the prices for stuff is basically arse pulled. Most stuff is build by big companies , and big companies (corps) are starting to have ways to enforce monopoly so they can just fix the prices they want and you actually have no choices but to buy. Things go that way for a large number of essentials like clothing, telecoms, homes or even local supermarket.\n\nIf you have a single super market deciding that food is gonna cost you 100$ and there's no single other super market chain within like 500km around you have no choice but to bend and take it or starve.\n\nThat's also what employers are colluding to do to the entire job market in the US.\n\n&gt; In your world where we just give employees some nice amount, what happens to the company that decides to ignore that and pay their CEO more\n\nThey invent some bullshit excuse to reduce the workers wages even more and tell them they are lucky to even have a wage and not being evicted by the bank next month because that's what would happen otherwise because they live from pay check to pay check and can't pay the mortegage/studen loan/car loan/... otherwise.\n\nThat's currently what's happening on a large scale in the US right now.\n\n&gt; Production will be way lower\n\nB U L L S H I T. Workers are the one who do the actual work, and they won't slow down because they are more paid. From experience, in fact, most workers are actually hard workers while the companies exec merely work \"just enough\" to go by. Tell me , try picking a single CEO which does not have an administrative assistant upon which he can just drop all the paper work he does not want to deal with. A single worker try this and he's fired on the spot.\n\n&gt; Now, your manager gets paid 4x what you do, and hes stressed out of his mind\n\nI work in IT. I spent quite some time in the past covering for some of the most absurd mistakes i can think of made by some of my past managers before being fed up with that bullshit and slamming the door. No, i don't think managers deserve x4 pays. Even that a CEO deserve a million times mine. They do deserve a higher pay, but not \"90% of the company revenue\" like a few does quite litterally.\n\n&gt; Now you're offered a promotion because the other guy quits.\n\nHe won't ever, because he's still paid and still need his job and wage as much as i need mine; and have about just as much mortgage and loans and live cost to pay for. That's the main reason why borderline slave don't slam the door most of the time and don't just tell their boss to just eat a bowl of dicks as much as they want too.\n\n&gt; The best man for the job does not take it. Production is down.\n\nIf promotion was based on competency half the big corporate execs would be sitting in jail for conning and lying on their CV; not be on a CEO or board manager.\n\n&gt; Do you know what happens when production is down in those examples? We get less stuff\n\nYou know what happens when most of your population is made of workers with no disposable income ? They don't buy *anything* anymore. Because they just can't, the credit card won't work when you sweep it. You basically patched the wooden leg with the credit system to inject virtual bullshit money. But it'll collapse soon because even then banks became too greedy with credit interests and loans. \n\nThen the corps will get no income in the end, and collapse. Then the entire US economy will die with it. But the execs doesn't give a flying fuck because they'll either be dead of old age when that happens, or will flee with their trillions in some island paradise watching the 600 million people cluster fuck from afar.

{"body": "I havent been a \"fanboy\" about anything. And I thought it was you or another mod who said we shouldnt even use words like that. All I have done is compare WP's update process to that of Android's in hopes of getting WP off of the crucifix it has been on in the past two weeks. I'm not saying WP is better or that Android sucks. All I have said is that WP updates are no worse than Android's and thus we shouldnt be complaining as much as we are. Everyone here acts like they are entitled to things that other platforms arent even offering like day one updates available to all phones. Android has never had anything like that and yet people say they might go to Android because of it. So I post sources and state facts about Android's update process and all of them get downvoted within a minute or two. Way too short of a time frame for people to have actually read the source material or given any real thought to my comments. It is anti-fanboyism and it is hurting the community and not helping it. Any time anyone says a good thing about WP lately it either gets downvoted or the top comment is \"Yeah but WP also sucks because of x x x x x x x x \". How is that intelligent conversation? It's not. It's a staw man fallacy. People ignore the topic and get other reader's to focus on the negatives instead of discuss what the OP originally was talking about. I have no delusions that WP is perfect. I, myself am irked that my new Lumia 928 wont be getting FM radio and may not even get Bluetooth 4.0 with GDR3. Yeah I'm freakin pissed. And I'm also mad that we don't have a good way of handling playlists in Xbox Music and I'm upset about a lot of other things. But I don't hate my phone because of those reasons and I dont think ranting about them every day is going to help. I actually email Nokia and Microsoft and talk to support about these issues. I look for workarounds and I let things slide more than I should. But when I get on this subreddit and try to have an actual intelligent fucking conversation comparing my phone's OS updates to another MAJOR OS. I shouldnt be fucking downvoted INSTANTLY just because people either have a vendetta against me or against fanboyism. Just because I like to look at the bright side instead of be negative all the time does not make me a fanboy, it makes me an optimist. And optimists are what layed the groundwork for WP. They are what gave it the marketshare it has today. They are what built this subreddit and it's community and now we're being crucified because we arent going along with the anti-wp circlejerk. And thats what it is. A circlejerk. And I'm sick of it. And a lot of other people are too from what my replies and PMs have read lately. A lot of people on the subreddit are too scared to even post about their discontent because the vocal circlejerkers would crucify them before their optimistic opinions ever got voiced.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1376958943", "subreddit": "windowsphone", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I usually go with a shtick. For example, the one I'm working with right now, it has a phonology that is similar to Welsh and Hawaiian, that is, there are very few voiced consonants, as well as the use of voiceless /r/ and /`/. \n\nAn alternate way to go about creating a phonology would be to start with a balanced phonology in terms of consonants (p t k b d g f th x, etc.) and vowels (a e i o u) and shift them so that you lose some pairs, have allophones become phonemes, etc. \n\n[this](http://archives.conlang.info/pei/pirjhin/zurbhaunsaun.html) might be of great help. \n\nWhat I've found, is that cross-linguistically, /g/ seems to be pretty marked.\n\n/g/ is a sound that is highly, highly likely to become just about anything else. In Faroese it became /k/ /j/ /v/ or /w/ (depending on surrounding vowels). In French it became /ʒ/, in Italian and Romanian it became /dʒ/, and in Spanish it became /ʃ/ then that became /χ/ (these Romance examples are in the presence of front vowels, of course). \n\nSo I try to keep that in mind when conlanging. Knowing that /ɪ ɛ ɔ ʊ æ/ are the lax variants of the tense vowels /i e o u a/ is a big help.\n\nVowel systems tend to always seek balance. This doesn't mean that a vowel system will ever be truly balanced, but it means that it will make an attempt to become as balanced as possible, but other factors will influence the developments. Then, if a vowel system does balance, it can start to come apart again (see the progression of Latin from classical to vulgar to the varying romance languages.)\n\nSo you can have the vowels move towards balance or you can do a freshly/heavily diverging system.

{"body": "Let me try to answer that!\n\nThe Song of Storms is in triple meter.  I'd notate it in 3/8, but you can call it 6/8 if you want.  It's in dorian mode, like most of Zelda's music in minor keys.  3/8 and 6/8 are catchy by default, and repetitiveness is also catchy by default if it doesn't get grating.  Actually, a little anecdote here, which may be apocryphal: someone apparently complained that Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music lacked any real tunes people would remember, so in response, he wrote [A Weekend In the Country](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZutBlUXUDI), the catchiest thing he could come up with, to make sure everyone left the theater with this song in their head for days.  What does it have?  Motifs that are repeated over and over, and all in 12/8!  It's repetitive but not blindly so.  Fun times!  The accompaniment is especially repetitive, so you can trust it to be there while the rest of the music goes places using the same formulas.\n\nSong of Storms has some of these same features.  In addition, it's important to consider one of the major sources of boredom in a melody: bad shape.  The melody needs to have a contour for it to be singable, and an intelligible phrase structure.  The Song of Storms does; it starts off with a snippet on the tonic and repeats it, but it doesn't actually *land* on the tonic again for seven bars of 6/8.  The four bars you listed are only the first half of the period; the second phrase in the period begins with the same three bars, but instead of the question at the end of the first half (ending on the 2), there's an answer in the fourth bar of the second half (ending on the 1).  Regarding the repetition of the tonic, the D F D is a springboard, and when it does get back to the D, in A D F G A, A D F G E, it's only bouncing off of it briefly.  Also, what other melody goes \"A D F\" twice?  Song of Time, of course.  That little hook is enough to keep you feeling familiarity when listening, and the chord structure is also emblematic of the other music in OoT.\n\nI listened to the first of your samples, and the thing that came to mind is that it doesn't *go* anywhere.  A good melody needs to have a contour and a phrase structure, and it needs to be supported by a chord progression.  A catchy tune needs to have repetition of patterns, both in the accompaniment and in motifs, *and* it needs to be a good melody.  Not all good melodies are catchy, nor are they meant to be.  Koji Kondo's catchy melodies were explicitly meant to be such.  As an example, do you remember the warp songs?  I kinda do, but only because I replayed the game.  The Song of Storms is in my head at will as if I were playing it, and Zelda's Lullaby as well, but the Serenade of Water?  Prelude of Light?  Minuet of Forest?  Bolero of Fire?  Actually, that one I remember a bit better because of the repetition.  Requiem of Spirit?  Nocturne of Shadow?  I don't remember them all, and I can't really match one to the other.  Not catchy!  And how about the dungeon music?  The only one I really remember is the Forest Temple music, and it's because it's got a repetitive thing with ascending thirds.  They set the mood very well, but they're *meant* to do that, not to stay in your head.  The Song of Storms is explicitly mentioned as being catchy, in-game!  Actually, so is Saria's Song, when you play it for Darunia.  It's got a very bouncy beat (and beats are repetitive), and the rhythm is EXTRAORDINARILY repetitive: eighth eighth quarter, eighth eighth quarter, etc., all variations on this.\n\nThere's another thing forcing Koji Kondo's hand here: the songs need to be ocarina-playable.  All of the non-warp songs are three-note motifs that get repeated (as is the Song of Healing, but not the song that makes statues in Majora's Mask; I don't remember that one).  That little three-note motif sprouts a melody, and if you don't remember the melody, you're not going to remember the three-note motif you need.  How often do you need to look up the Song of Storms or the Song of the Sun?

{"body": "&gt; Are you saying a good melody needs to have some chords playing harmony in the background?\n\nWell... yes.  Not really, but yes.  The melody and harmony are rather inextricable.  The notes of the melody usually outline some chords, and the harmony realizes those chords and sometimes sets up the melody for a more natural progression.  If the melody is the path you take on a bike, the harmony is the paved bike road -- it can make your ride much smoother if you ride on it!  It's not a perfect analogy, I know.  So perhaps... swimming with the current?\n\nThe harmony indicated by the notes of the melody is called the implied harmony.  If you've got a good ear, you don't need to actually hear the harmony to reproduce it, because you can just guess it from the melody.  The harmony itself can do four things -- it can agree with the implied harmony, it can soften up the implied harmony by using transitional chords (if there's a V chord coming up, it can use a V/V, a secondary dominant, to give the progression more momentum), or it can ignore the implied harmony altogether.  This last effect is interesting because you actually get two harmonies at once, the implied harmony and the actual chords heard.  But that's only three -- the fourth thing is that it can reinterpret the implied harmony as part of another chord.  Song of Storms does this in the third and fourth measures.  The chord is BbM7, while the harmony implied by A D F G A is so obviously Dm.  If the chord were Dm, the melody would be less interesting.  The bVImaj7 chord also provides momentum -- it resolves to the bIII (F major) in the third measure, and in the second, to V7, where the root is a half step away.  The roots of the chords make another little melody that needs to function in counterpoint with the main one.  All of this makes for a smooth listening experience.  We say \"a good melody\", but really we mean \"a good song\", and harmony is part of that.  You just can't pull melody and harmony apart completely.\n\n&gt; And how does the melody interact with those chords aside from being in the same scale?\n\nHopefully I've answered this question, but I want to comment that \"being in the same scale\" is not a requirement *at all*.  Why, the scale for Song of Storms is D dorian, but look at that BbM7 chord following an Em!  Many people who post questions in this subreddit think that the scale something is in is sacred.  \"What?  There's an F# in my C major soup!  Waiter, take it back!\"  The scale evokes a particular feeling, but music needs to have a progression of feelings, so it changes.  The BbM7 calls to mind the CM7 of Zelda's lullaby (the B, D A melody is harmonized by CM7, D7/C), so it's not out of place, and it resolves nicely to F in measure 3 and to A7 in measure 4.  At that particular moment, we're no longer in D dorian but in D minor.  And, of course, chromaticism is no crime.  Notice, though, that in all of this, the melody stays pretty simple!  The melody needs to be simple to be catchy, but the harmony doesn't.  The harmony needs to be *good*, though, in order for the listener to enjoy the melody enough that it becomes catchy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377092647", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "But it doesn't change any of the notes for Dm7 G7. You could play the same collection of notes in F lydian (F G A B C D E) by playing D dorian (D E F G A B C). Each tone over each chord has its own quality. This is what i mean by \"it's valuable to note the actual relationships to the chord\". Get something to play a loop of a chord vamp and try out every one of the diatonic extensions (D E F G A B C for D dorian). Take note of what each note really sounds like. You should, given enough practice, be able to hear a chord with any number of these extensions and say \"oh that's a Dm7 with a 9th and a 13th thrown on\". \n\nIt should be obvious to you that doing C lydian over the Cmaj7 instead of playing diatonically (F lydian/C ionian/D dorian/G mixolydian/etc) is a new way of expression because it has a different collection of notes (one note different, the F#).\n\nHere's a quick exploration of a series of tones over a Cmaj7, just for example. Listed in ease of resolution (in my opinion)\n\nCmaj7.\n\n1- Colorless, resolute. Does not give any meaning to the chord by itself.\n\n5- Emphasizes the 1. Not very colorful. Has a sort of \"powerful\" sound.\n\n3- Defining. Slightly dissonant. Sometimes has an almost \"breathy\" sound.\n\n7- Dissonant and defining. Very pretty sounding, almost sounds \"shimmering\" to me.\n\nEtc etc. I could continue and do this for 9ths, #11ths, 11ths, 13ths, b13ths, #9ths, b9ths, b7ths, but giving you my opinion only has so much value.

We don't have gorgeous, 2000 sq.-foot apartments in downtown San Francisco and make $90,000 commission off of one wedding. Most planners make an hourly wage, and are idiotic 25 year olds who are disorganized, sloppy and always high/drunk. \n\nThe wages are shitty, the hours are shittier. Kiss your weekends goodbye. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are your new weekends, if you're lucky. Be prepared to get fat because you live on coffee, cigarettes, leftover catering food and McDonalds. Your feet, neck, back and arms hurt all of the time. \n\nNo, we do not stand around and bark orders into a headset. We don't even wear headsets. We do everything that the catering staff does only we're in charge of it and we have no clue what we're doing either. You don't wear glamorous dresses and high heels. You wear black stretchy pants that look like dress pants and flats with Dr. Scholl's inserts. You're at the event 2 hours before everyone else and you're the last to leave. You basically live out of your car, toting around vases, jars, decorations, tablecloths (you name it) at any given time. \n\nEDIT: I also wanted to include that most of the customers are not so bad. It's the wedding guests that make the job terrible. Guests are rude, mean, messy and just generally inconsiderate. I've literally been urinated on by a guest, I've been hit, nearly run over with a car, punched in the chest, had glass thrown at me, had a chair thrown at me, and had a FATHER OF THE BRIDE claw my chest so badly it bled (in that particular incident, the company I was working for at the time forced me to drop charges against the man for fear of sullying the company's reputation,) all by drunk wedding guests. I've also had my car hit in a parking lot by a drunk guest and they drove off; it did $2000 worth of damage, which I had to pay out of pocket, because the facility had no outdoor surveillance system. I have also heard stories (it never personally happened to me) of hired security guards forcing themselves on girls. If you're single, go buy a big fake ring so male guests think you're married. I've seen many groomsmen's dicks. Too many. I've literally lost count of the amount of people I've caught having sex in bathrooms.  \n\nWeddings are like a social experiment gone wrong. People should not be in confined spaces with their emotions running high and alcohol flowing. \n\nA few years ago, I decided to go back to school and get my event planning degree (I jumped right into the field and worked for 4 years before deciding to go back to school.) and the first thing I said to every class was, \"this job is nothing like the movies. You aren't going to be JLo. You'll be lucky if you get a salaried job, and even then most positions are terrible, shitty back-beating jobs.\" Girls would always get their feathers ruffled because they were convinced that they were gonna live the dream. No. Get that shit out of your head. If you're hell bent on being an event planner, try working as a catering server first to get a taste of it. Trust me, you'll run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. \n\nOh, and another thing...don't waste your money on an event planning/hospitality degree. You don't need them. Every single thing I know about the wedding industry I learned on the job, not out of a textbook. If you must, get an AFA in hospitality management because that way you're ServeSafe certified. Because about half of chicks who get event planning degrees end up being managers at Applebee's and O'Charleys.  \n\nTL;DR don't go into event planning.

{"body": "I kind of see what you're saying... let me see if I can say it more elegantly. Note that a rudimentary understanding of modes is necessary to follow this.\n\n**DIMNISHING THE 2nd INTERVAL**\n\nLet us start with an Aeolian mode (the 6th mode). The intervals contained are:\n\nr 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7\n(r - root, numbers -  major interval, b+number - minor interval)\n\nx+2 in your example is the major 2nd. Moving it back one fret is the same as diminishing it. We would then get the following intervals:\n\n*r b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7*\n\nThis is the Phrygian mode (the 3rd mode)\n\nNow let us consider what this implies if I keep the root the same, with specific examples.\n\nA Aeolian (A B C D E F G) – from C major (C D E F G A B)\nA Phrygian (A Bb C D E F G) – from F major (F G A Bb C D E)\n\nF is a perfect 4th above C. This is also a perfect 5th below A. So in that sense you are moving \"backwards\" through the cycle of 5ths, or up the cycle of 4ths.\n\n**AUGMENTING THE 6th INTERVAL**\n\nx+8 in your example is the minor 6th. Moving it up one fret is the same as augmenting it. We would then get the following intervals:\n\n*r 2 b3 4 5 6 b7*\n\nThis is the Dorian mode (the 2nd mode)\n\nNow let us consider what this implies if I keep the root the same, with specific examples.\n\nA Aeolian (A B C D E F G) – from C major (C D E F G A B)\nA Dorian (A B C D E F# G) – from G major (G A B C D E F#)\n\nG is a perfect 5th above C (and converse a perfect 4th below C). So in that sense you are moving \"forwards\" through the cycle of 5ths.\n\nI find that grasping things from the perspective of intervals (which essetially ARE distances) is an easier way to remember and apply the concepts. You're right in saying that the half-step between B/C and E/F provides challenges to conceptualizing things, but I find that intervals deals with this quite succinctly without the need to invent a new represetation.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377148832", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*first post on this subreddit*\n\n\nTo whom it may concern: \n\n\nClass is canceled today. I have never before in my twenty-seven years of teaching canceled a class but this morning I experienced some sort of late-life existential crisis that saw me walk past my daily newspaper and continue to head down my driveway and into the street. Getting in my car felt too familiar so I believe that to be the reason behind bursting into an aimless stroll. I ended up about two miles away in one of your beloved independent coffee shops on the border of our campus trying to figure out what long term value anything sold there had. Finally my watch alarm went off, the one that usually sees me walking out the door of my house en route to my office for my morning grading and basically mandatory mingling with the other pseudo-intellectuals who make up the math department teaching staff. I snoozed my alarm and bought some kind of chocolate, caramel, triple-shot espresso drink and just paid with a twenty dollar bill, didn't even take the change. I've never not taken the change!\n\nAs I stepped outside of the coffee shop I began to reflect on the morning so far. Something had been unsettled in me since I laid eyes on the newspaper. At first it felt like your everyday feeling of *deja vu* I noted that the paper was in the **exact** same position as the day before. The *deja vu* quickly morphed into the intense urge to break this cage of a life I've been leading for the last few years. Did you know the approach to teaching my field of mathematics hasn't changed since 1982!? My lesson plan hasn't had to be adjusted for over twenty years. I know some of my test answers by heart- by that I mean the sequence of multiple choice answers; for instance the last test was 'B A A A C B B D A C A C B D A'. I know that off the top of my head. Sometimes I don't even remember the giving you a lecture because I have given each one so many times the individual occurrences have melded into one single memory. The jokes I make during each day's lesson are ones that I told during my first year of teaching, I can't even stop myself from telling them anymore- I just hear the sound waves coming out of my mouth and observe seventy-or-so students chuckle. \n\nIn conclusion, after a particularly confusing first experience with public transportation, I made it home resolved to \"cut loose\" for a day (however dramatic that sounds). I found my wife still asleep, woke her, and we're going to drive up to the Cape this weekend where I'll consider a career change. Pending the outcome of this introspection your test Tuesday will be canceled. However, still be prepared for it as my mind is definitely not made up. \n\nThank you, enjoy your afternoon. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377154698", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Western Music is mostly based around the major scale. Its pattern is Wt-Wt-Ht-Wt-Wt-Wt-Ht (whole tone, half tone), so in the key of C you have C D E F G A B C. Now, if you start at any of those notes, and treat it as a root note, you get a new pattern for each one that is a scale itself - a mode.\n\nFor example, the second mode is Dorian. It has a pattern of Wt-Ht-Wt-Wt-Wt-Ht-Wt. More often than this, scales are described in comparison to major scale degrees (1 2 3 4 5 6 7). Therefore, Dorian, in comparison, has a scheme of 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7.\n\nModes give you the option of adding flavour to your playing. Over one given chord, you can use different modes to imply different sounds (ie, over a single minor chord, you can use Dorian, Phrygian or Aeolian aka natural minor) and each has a distinct sound because of the different intervals the scale contains and thus how different they sound over the chord. Also, certain progressions will often be reminescent of a certain mode sound (e.g. Amin7-D7 is a nice Dorian progression).\n\nFire away any follow-up questions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377160451", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "They don't really. A lot of what defines an accent boils down to differences in intonation (tonal variations) and rhythmic cadence. When you sing a song, the musical tones/notes and rhythm are basically standardized for everyone.\n\nFor instance, a particular word in the song lyrics may be associated with the musical note 'C', so the singer must sing the word using a 'C' tone. If the person sings the word using a pitch/tone that is slightly off, they will sound too sharp or flat.\n\nIn regular spoken dialogue, the same set of words may be said using different tones depending on your accent. For example, lets suppose you have a sentence like \"Hello, how are you?\". A person from one country may speak the sentence in such a way that 'Hello' corresponds to an A tone, 'how' to a B tone, 'are' to a C tone and 'you' to a D tone. Conversely, a person speaking with a different accent may say the same sentence with 'Hello' as a D tone, 'how' as a C tone, 'are' as a B tone and 'you' as an A tone. Both persons may also use a different rhythmic pattern of expression when speaking the words.\n\nHowever, if these two people then sing that phrase to a particular tune (e.g. one involving four notes of D B C A tones), any differences in intonation based on accent would be eliminated and instead both singers would sing (to the beat of the song) the words using D B C A tones.\n\nThus, singing is more like a standard/neutral accent dictated by the musical notes and beat/rhythm of the song.

{"body": "I-II-III-iv-V:  \n\n- The number correlates to the note in the major scale\n\n- I / i / 1 = C (in C) or G (in G) = 0 semitones up from root note\n\n- bII / bii / b2 = Db (in C) or Ab (in G) = 1 semitone up from root note\n\n- and so on...\n\n- The capital roman numeral often indicates major.  The lowercase roman numeral often indicates minor.  Sometimes people use all capitals or all lowercase and don't try to differentiate between major/minor.  If using regular numbers, that's often called Nashville numbering.  If there's little superscript or subscript number to the right of them, then that's a notation like Figured Bass and would be a chord inversion.\n\nRelative minor/major chords.\n\n- A relative major scale is always three semitones up from the root note of a minor scale.  (relative major of C minor = Eb major)\n\n- A relative minor scale is always three semitones down from the root note of a major scale.  (relative minor of C major = A minor)\n\nScales vs. Chords\n\n- Just keep in mind that people like to equate scales and chords, but really try to realise that there both describing the same thing ... a set of notes.  It's just chords are meant to be sounded at the same time and scales are meant to be sounded with melodies more.\n\n- Diatonic chords fit inside a scale without any notes outside of the scale being used at that point in the song.  E.g. Am in a song that uses a C major scale.  A C E are notes that are all contained in C D E F G A B C\n\n- Non-diatonic chords have one or more notes that don't fit inside the scale being used at that point in the song.  E.g. A major in a song that uses a C major scale.  A C# E has one note that is not contained in the C major scale.\n\n4 &amp; 5 are very open questions.  \n\n- Especially for jazz chords, just realise that there really are no rules... just chords and chord sequences that show up more often than others.  Swing jazz often has 6 and 9 chord flavors.  Bebop jazz often has b9, #11, b13 chord flavors.  All jazz likes the 2-5-1 chord progression.  All jazz likes to go around the circle of fifths, whether diatonically or non-diatonically (look up secondary dominants for that).  A lot of times you want to have some \"familiar\" chord changes mixed with \"less familiar\" chord changes.\n\nAnd the 2 biggest things that freed me from all the stupid and confusing \"rules\" abound in the music theory world:\n\n- Always be mindful of VOICE LEADING.  You know how topline melodies can sound weird if they make awkward jumps/intervals/whatever.  It's the same concept, but taken to the chord level.  Texts on classical music talk about it a lot (just don't take seriously all the rules that are laid out for voice leading, use them as a way to learn, not a way to be).\n\n- COUNTERPOINT is one of the best tools to learn what voice leading is all about.  This really helped me learn how to write melodies on top of other melodies (or anything for that matter) and still sound good and right.  This also helped me realize that chord sequences can also be viewed as stacks of melodies (which is basically the same concept that voice leading taught me).  Again, forget the \"rules\" once you have got the basic concept down.\n\nThe 2 most important intervals (the fifth/fourth and the semitone)\n\n- Over time I've realized there are 2 main interval relationships that drive a lot what sounds right/wrong or urgent/calm.  The semitone and the fifth/fourth.  For example, I think the V-I sounds so strong because it has a semitone movement and fifth/fourth movement (and because it's been used that way for a long time).  Science-wise I think this is because the 5 is the most harmonious interval (the 1st harmonic past the octave) and the semitone is the least harmonious interval.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377298336", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Jesus, this is a tough one.\n\nLet's start with the *basics*. If I have a set S containing n unique elements, there exist n! (n factorial) ways to uniquely order S, or n *permutations* of S. So, let's say\n\nS = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nThere are 4 unique elements in S, so there should be 4! = 24 permutations.\n\nS = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nS = {1, 2, 4, 3}\n\nS = {1, 3, 2, 4}\n\nS = {1, 3, 4, 2}\n\nS = {1, 4, 2, 3}\n\nS = {1, 4, 3, 2}\n\nThere are six ways to arrange S that start with 1, so it's natural to assume that there are six ways to arrange it starting with two, six ways to arrange it starting with three, and six ways to arrange it starting with four. Thus, 24 permutations, which, as I said, is 4!.\n\nSo, let's start with one side of a Rubik's cube. I'll treat the spaces on the side like so, where each position is indexed:\n\n0  1  2 \n\n3  4  5\n\n6  7  8\n\nSo, the index in the set corresponds with a numerical value. Without bothering with colors yet, I'll just say that on side S1, we have:\n\nS1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nWhich has 9! = 362880 permutations.\n\nBut wait, it's infinitely more complicated than that. A Rubik's cube can start with two or more colors on the same side, so it's possible that we have something like\n\nS1 = {0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7}\n\nWhere the 1-3rd indicies and the 7-8th indices are indistinguishable. This is going to complicate the permutations significantly, so we need a new approach.\n\nI'll label each color with a letter, ie \"r g b y p i o w k\" corresponds to \"red green blue yellow purple indigo orange white black.\" Let's redefine S1:\n\nS1 = {r^(r1), g^(g1), b^(b1), y^(y1), p^(p1), i^(i1), o^(o1), w^(w1), k^(k1)}\n\nwhere the \"exponents\" of each element tell us how many times the element appears in S1. We thus must have\n\nfor all 0 &lt; n &lt; 10:\n\nrn + gn + bn + yn + pn + in + on + wn + kn = 9\n\nbecause for any given side of the cube, there can only be 9 squares on the side. Similarly, for some color m,\n\nm1 + m2 + ... + m9 = 9\n\nbecause there can only be 9 instances of each color on the cube.\n\nSo, what we have is a *two-dimensional* permutation problem, which means that we need *matrices*. If we have a 9-dimensional (column) vector for our colors:\n\n*C* = (r, g, b, y, p, i, o, w, k)\n\nand nine 9x9 matrices **S1**, **S2**, ... **S9** corresponding to the nine sides, our goal is that\n\n**S***C* = 9*C*\n\nsuch that\n\n**S** = **S1** + **S2** + ... **S9**\n\nunder the restriction that, given some 9-dimensional vector *u* such that\n\n*u* = (1, 1, 1, ... 1)\n\n**Sn***u* dot *u* = 9\n\nwhere \"dot\" denotes the vector dot product.\n\nGiven all of this math, we say \"holy fuck, I have no idea how to solve that.\"\n\nWe then plug it into a computer, which can test all the possible Rubik's cube combinations in less than an hour even if you're really bad at coding. That's how you get the answer.\n\nedit: turns out I suck at math, I should try checking wiki first :(", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377322291", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First i am going to go over written knowledge of voice leading, then suggest excercises. This is also on my iPhone, so sorry about format and selling mistakes\n\nA good way to start is too look at the chords to a song you enjoy, and to look at only two chords at a time ... For me, I am a tenor player, so I will choose Oleo (Based off rhythm changes) in concert Bb so for tenor, in the key of C. The first two bars have 4 chords, \n\nCMaj7, A7, Dmin7 and G7\n\nBut we will come to Dmin7 and G7 later\n\n\nSo without playing in time,\nI am going to take my Cmaj7 and A7 and spell the chords out,\nCmaj7 has the notes \n\nC, E, G, B\n(C is root of chord, E is 3rd, G is 5th,\nB is 7th)\n\nA7 has the notes \n\nA, C#, E, G\n\n(A is root, C# is 3rd, E is 5th, and G is 7th)\n\nAnd so the most basic form of voicing leading is to look at the notes in Cmaj7 and compare them with A7, and look at the distances between notes, or notes that are the same. \n\nC E G B\nA C# E G\n\nYou notice both chords have \" E\" and \"G\" which are common tones, which means you could just hold a G or E for both chords and sound fine, BUT that is not voice leading. Voice leading is playing a note from a previous chord and resolving it by the shortest distance to another note in the next chord. \n\nSo because you are going from Cmaj7 to A7, take a note from Cmaj7 and try to then play a note from the A7 that is the shortest distance away... For example \n\nThe note C COULD go to the note A, but this is not ideal, because it is a minor 3rd away ... But, if you were to play C and then C#, that would sound sweet, because it is only\nA half step away, or minor second, was a shorter distance, and the C# is a defining note of A7.\n\nIf we take The note B from the Cmaj7, we see that it's closest notes are A and C#, but because B is a 7th of a chord, it usually resolves downward.\n\nGood voice leading is based around 3rds and 7ths of chords, because they are defining notes of those chords.\n\nWhen I say defining, I mean that if you have a C Maj chord, it WILL have an E, if we have a C min chord, it WILL have an Eb... The 3rd of the chord dictates whether or not the chord is major of minor, where as something like the fith of the chord doesn't ... The seventh of the chord dictates whether is is a maj7 chord of a (dominant) 7 chord and so on ... They are your most interesting and defining notes of the chord.\n\nNow do the same thing with A7 and Dmin 7 \n\nA C# E G\nD F A C \n\nYou can see that you can hold an \"A\", that is a common tone, not voice leading.\n\nFor good voice leading, wee look at 3rds and 7ths, so look at 3rds and 7ths!\n\nFor A7, 3rd and 7th are: C# and G\nFor Dmin7 3rd and  7th: F and C \n\nC#'s closest note is C, and G's is A or F, but because F is the 3rd of Dmin7, go to F because it is a 3rd and defines the chord. (The third goes down this time as well, but keep in mind that 3rds tendancy's can change, but if you can, try resolving them up, but if resolve to a strong chord tone like a 3Rd or 7th, resolve there instead) \n\nNow look at Dmin7 to G7. This is a two five. If you don't know what that is, ask someone else, I'm not explaining anything else today on my iPhone at 6 in the morning.\n\nTake your notes of Dmin7 and G7\n\nD F A C\nG B D F\n\nLook at 3rds and 7ths ... 3rd is a common tone with G's 7th this time, so it is ideal to voice lead the 7th of D this time, or the 5th of D, resolving the notes to \"B\", G7's 3rd, a defining note in the chord. But because C is closer to B, and is a 7th to 3rd resolution, it is better to choose that one. \n\nF also can resolve to G, but that can sound lame because G is the root of the chord.\n\nNow lets say the G7 is now going to CMaj (no 7th)\n\nLook at notes in chord\n\nG B D F\nC E G C\n\nLook at 3rds and 7ths of G7\n\nB resolves up nicely to C, and F resolves down nicely to E. \n\n\nSo long story short, take a look at 3rds and 7ths and try to resolve them to the closest notes of the next chord. It is ideal to resolve notes to the 3rd or 7th of the next chord. \n\nExercise 1: take ONLY 3rds and 7ths and resolve them from one chord to another chord by the shortest distance possible. This sounds incomplete though if you don't have someone playing piano, or you know the tune really well\n\nExcercise 2: arpedigiated the first chord, R,3,5,7 and resolve the 7th to the closest note of next chord, then arpedgiate that one down. So in example of G7 to CMaj, play: G B D F E C  (or you can keep going down and play G B D F E C G E C)\n\nExcersise 3: if you know what scale source goes with each chord, play up the scale to whichever notes you want to voice lead, and resolve them by shortest distance to note of next chord.\nRemember that resolving from 3rds and 7ths is the strongest voice leading. \n\nExcercise 4: write all the notes out like I did, but vertically, and study each chord looking at the distance between notes, and draw little arrows from 3 3rds and 7ths to the closest notes of the next chord \n\nExcercise 5, take every note of the first chord and try to voice lead to the shortest distance away not of the next  ( sorry that sounded weird)\n\nExcersise 6: play piano and play from chord to chord trying to move each note the shortest distance to the next chord, this one I would say is the most helpful, because it is so visual, and everything is black and white .... :D\n\nSo there is my shpeal, there are some excercises, if you have band in the box or iReal book, use those to practice along with, and if you have any questions, ask me, I will try to clarify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377348063", "subreddit": "Saxophonics", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

Additionally, your accusation that this patriot would do nothing \"because [he's] a coward\" is outlandish. Sometimes, the most patriotic thing to do is to not fight back. The great patriot after whom we have a day off in January, Martin Luther King, Jr., fought for his constitutional rights betowed by the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments using pacifism, and if you're trying to say that nonviolence is anything less than the bravest damn thing there is, you can go back to the U S S R because you, damn commie, are not wanted in this great and bountiful nation of ours.\n\nThat isn't to say that those who do not practice nonviolence are in any way lesser patriots.

Or having girlfriends. Or being gay. Or **a combination of the three.**\n\nSide note.  When I first read this I thought you were describing a specific situation where a gay guy had a *girl*friend and yet had also fallen for *you*, too.  I was thinking, \"Uh...I don't think that guy was really gay after all.  Either he's secretly not gay or you and that other girl must be just that crazy hot enough to turn him straight.\"\n\nThen I re-read it and realized you were talking in a more general sense about your gut's misjudgements in the past :)   And we all have those misjudgements.  Worry not.  Actually, I don't think my gut has ever been *right* about that kind of thing, so you're probably doing pretty well.\n\nErr, okay, onto the real topic...\n\n&gt; Currently, I want to pursue this one coworker, but I'm not sure if he has a girlfriend or is interested in me that way, but I think those two bits are beyond my main problem if I, myself, am a barrier to the social change that I wish to make. I have tried talking to another one of my coworkers about my problem and she's suggested just trying to talk to him generally. I don't disagree that this is good advice, but with how my interactions have been with him, I just feel that I might be forcing it and/or he'd figure out what I'm doing.\n\n&gt; For the record, we are on friendly terms and hold some similar interests (mostly video games just come to mind, though he only seems to be interested in one specific series that's THANKFULLY not an FPS), just that most of our interactions end up with us throwing casual insults at one another for laughs. It's what I do best, aside from my job, and I love those interactions with him, but yes, I want to not let our relationship to revolve around that. Move up!\n\n&gt; So, I ask you guys and gals, what can you advise me to do? I know I'm being ridiculous, but it's just all I really know how to do! I mean, I don't even really socialize with my coworkers outside of work, even though I'd like to do that or try that (though I feel a little old doing that as most of them are a little bit younger than me. STILL! exclusion feeling).\n\n&gt; Bonus semi-related question that had been bothering me: every once in awhile in the recent past when we have had a semi conversation, I've noticed something that appears to be a nervous tick that he has where he'll \"adjust\" himself, so to say. I don't even know if he'll realize he does this, and that makes me hold back a laugh every time I see this happen. I haven't noticed him doing this when talking to other people, so I was wondering if this is one of those really odd things that indicates that he's attracted to me. Maybe?\n\nAfter reading all that...my initial reaction is that you're way over-thinking all of this.  At first glance there seem to be *way* too many variables to know what he's really thinking, particularly with that \"tick\" thing.  Don't read too much into stuff like that, especially so early.  Just talk to him.  Tell him you're interested.\n\nIn other words, if you say that you believe your problem (if it's even really that big of a problem) is that you \"tend to try to avoid showing that I have feelings for\" guys, then the solution might simply be just...stop avoiding it.  If you *want* to show him that you have feelings for him, then step out of your comfort zone a tiny bit and just use your words and tell him what you're feeling or ask him out on a clear date.  At the very least, it will force you to be a little more bold and yield practice for confronting your feelings openly and honestly instead of avoiding the issue.  And if he says yes or is interested, too...sweet.  Bonus points.  If he doesn't, then at least you'll spend less time fretting about it and wondering about it.\n\nThat's my late-night two cents anyway.

C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B  and then back to C. A scale is just instructions on how far away the next note is. So the IONIAN mode which is also the Major scale is this series of Intervals.

{"body": "A scale is any series of notes that repeat every octave. There's diatonic scales with the seven notes that make the major scale, three sets of minor scales: natural, harmonic and melodic, chromatic scales, diminished scales, augmented scales, pentatonic scales, blues and jazz scales as well as assorted scales like Byzantine and Hungarian scales.\n\nA B C D E F G is known as the A minor scale even though if you start from C and play C D E F G A B C it's a C major scale.\n\nG A B C D E F# G is a G major scale even though D E F# G A B C D is a D minor scale. Notice the sharp note is the same for both scales.\n\nThis is true for all twelve keys, so essentially there are 12 different sets for each scale. It gets kind of crazy when one first starts playing music.\n\nDon't ask what a chord is.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377467176", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I'll try to answer them sort of in order, though I'm gonna skip 4 because I don't really know.\n\nIf you don't know what key you're in, find the last note/chord of the song. That's your key. It's not a 100% guarantee (it's a bit of a musician's joke), but it's nearly always the case. From a more detailed theory perspective, the expectation from the listener is that the song will \"resolve\" back to the root chord of the key, even though they most likely aren't actually consciously aware of what key it's in.\n\nIf you've ever sung songs in church, for instance, you've probably noticed that a lot of them end with that \"Aaaaaameeeeeeen.\" The \"meeeeen\" is the root of the key, whereas the \"Aaaa\" is the fourth; it's called a \"plagal cadence.\" So, if the last two notes of a hymn are F and then C, it's almost undoubtedly in C major.\n\nDropping your tuning will change the key, unless you change what frets you're playing on. If you play a song in E tuning that's in C, then drop all the strings a whole step and play the same frets and so on, you're playing in B flat.\n\nThe real way to identify the key is by looking at the sheet music. If that doesn't help, you have to remember what chords correspond to each interval in the major and minor scales, and then extrapolate backwards to find the key.\n\nSo, if I have a song that uses Cmaj, Fmaj, and Gmaj, I know that I'm in C major (or A minor, but probably not) because the IV and V chords in a major key are also major, and F and G are the IV and V intervals of C. I can't be in Fmaj, because Gmaj isn't in Fmaj (it would be Gmin), and I can't be in Gmaj, because Fmaj isn't in Gmaj (F isn't even in the G major scale).\n\nThe point here is that all of the notes that make up the chords will (usually) be in the scale of whatever key you're using. It gets all fucky and weird when you bring jazz and stuff into the mix, but *generally*, all the notes in the chord will be in the scale.\n\nSimilarly, when you're writing melodies, any note in the scale of whatever key you're in is viable. You can also throw in other notes that aren't in the scale because it sounds cool, but it's beyond my understanding of music theory to explain when and how you can do that. If you're not sure, it's always safe to focus on using the notes that are in the current chord, i.e. just dicking around on the arpeggios. Really, though, your ear will know which notes are good and what aren't, even if you don't.\n\nIt's absolutely possible to go from a major key to a minor key, and vice versa. The really easy way to do it is to use what's called the *relative minor*.\n\nIf you play all the notes in a C major scale, ie C D E F G A B C, but start on the A, you get a minor scale: A B C D E F G A (try it on your guitar if you don't believe me). A minor is thus the *relative minor* of C major, and C major is the *relative major* of A minor. It's really easy to switch between the two, because they're the same notes and thus aren't that jarring.\n\nSo, if you're writing a pop song and your chord progression for the verse is Cmaj - Gmaj - Fmaj - Fmaj, a chorus that'll sound good but still have that \"minor\" feel is Amin - Gmaj - Fmaj - Fmaj.\n\nAs for the last question, uh... sort of? Dorian sounds kind of tribal or primal. If you know the [Halo opening theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0mQk7JEVq4), it's Dorian. The Phrygian mode is just a weird minor scale, it has a sort of exotic feel. The Lydian mode sounds like a major scale where you missed one note. The Mixolydian mode is sort of like a major scale, only there's one note different that makes it sound sort of jazzy; if you've ever run into a major chord with a diminished seventh, that's Mixolydian. The Aeolian mode is a minor scale, and I do not remember at all what the Locrian mode sounds like.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377467791", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Poke in lane: Energy based\n\nThats nice but without blue you go out of energy very quickly. \n\n&gt;Insane burst after 6, Zed has a higher kil potential\n\nNot really. There is also much much more counter play to a Zed all in. \n\nThe mark only does the base AD plus 20% of damage delt in that time. PLUS, the enemy has much more time to react to the all in. Lets say a zed walks up and ultis me. full hp. R E Q than some autos. Sure, thats a decent chunk of damage. but if you are playing someone like leblanc, pantheon, ahri, or any mid with a fast cc/mobility, they can instantly negate all the bonus damage deathmark would add. still though. assume you are maxing Q, thats 60 (+ 80 bonus ad) shadow slash damage, 155(+1.0 bonus ad) Q damage. than say 3 auto attacks. with the last one doing an extra 40 magic damage (his passive). with ad runes and masteries (standard) he will have 6 + 2 + (.67x6) bonus AD. \n\nLets ignore armor for this. \n\nso thats 72.4 attack damage at level 6. 3 autos thats. 214 damage. R deals a flat 72.4. E deals 69.6 damage. and Q does 167 damage. Add all taht up and we have a level 6 all in potential of. 214 + 72.4 + 69.6 + 167. and 40 magic from his passive. which gives: \n\n563 damage.  \n\nnow add 20% of that and that gives us 663 damage before armor and with no ignite. \n\nI've done the math previously with talon so i don't have to type it all out. but with the same set up. assuming no ignite assuming no armor.\n\nwe get: \n\nR: 270 damage\n\nQ: 163 damage (auto attack + Q for auto reset. very easy to do)\n\nW: 188 damage\n\nE: multiply everything by 3% \n\nToss in an extra auto to keep up with the 3 zed is getting, another 68 damage. \n\nWe arrive at: 709 damage before armor and assuming no offensive items. just base stats. (if you want to bring items into it. check talon's rations. they are much higher.) \n\nSo yea. not only do i do MORE damage than you, as i've just proved. my damage can't be stopped. the 1 second silence from E is enough to get 1 auto + q + w + the first proc of R. Thats 80% of my daamge that CANT BE AVOIDED. THEY CAN't DO ANYTHING WHILE SILENCED. Meanwhile, we have Zed. who the second he presses R on me if im low im flashing after it end. negating the entire trade (now he can't all in me for another 120 seconds or w/e it is). And if im not low. i can just out of the Q with ease or stun him if i'm playing certain champions. \n\nWith talon there is literally NOTHING THEY CAN DO. for the start of my combo. nothing. The damage is more reliable. \n\n&gt;Escape\n\nTalon has a 2.5 second stealth. if we are talking about pre 6 sure but can you harass with your energy harass pre 6 without giving up uyour escape? no you can't. therefore they are on the same page. \n\n&gt;Wrecked by early pressure. \n\nNo, not really. if you play the lane right you can bait the enemy into pushing the lane (using aoe abilities to poke you) and you get a nice 3-4 waves on your half of the lane. this makes jungler pressure very very hard to pull off and i almost never die before level 6 to a gank unless i E Q W in on the enemy at a poor time (i start a ward for this reason.)\n\n&gt;Easier to pick off someone.\n\nDebatable. If they don't have oracles their ad carry is dead and they can't do anything about it because they are silenced for the duration of my burst. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377566747", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Speaking as a high gold player, I can easily win 9 games for every 1 I lose at the bronze level. What you think is problematic with your play is not even close to what's actually causing you issues.\n\nEvery player has an idea of what \"good play\" looks like in their head - perhaps from watching the LCS, streams, and reading online forums. They know that when there's two ganking top your team should ideally be taking dragon. When an enemy is split pushing, force a fight. Things like that. Then they get mad when their team doesn't follow through with these strategies, blaming their rating on bad teammates who don't know anything.\n\nThis is the wrong way to think about League.\n\nRather, when you play you need to see the other 9 players as providing a framework on which you make plays and take action. As you play more, you start to feel weaknesses in the other players. Perhaps you might intuitively know when your teammates go in at a bad time and thus position yourself accordingly. You'll start to see more flaws in the opposition's play and take advantage of them by yourself.\n\nThis is the core of becoming a better player - being able to intuitively assess situations you've never seen before (because every situation is slightly different) and make the most of it using your mechanical ability. This is why high level players can carry lower level games - they consistently see what the optimal play is in a given situation and take it. Those little advantages proceed to snowball the game in their favor. You might think you see them right now, but chances are you're letting tons of opportunities slip right by you without taking action. This is what separates a bronze from a silver from a gold from a platinum from a diamond from a challenger. The ability to consistently see good plays and act on them with precision.\n\nIf you want to get out of bronze and improve as a player, the only way out is to play more games and be more bold with your experimentation. Trade more aggressively than you might feel comfortable with. Be hard on yourself if you're caught or die inappropriately in a teamfight. Push your mechanical skill and always be critical of the way you're clicking, aiming your abilities, and positioning yourself.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that while SOME people communicate, try to lead the team, and be a team player, most players simply operate within that framework I was mentioning and gain their rating just fine. Your own personal skill can and will shine through without saying a word, and I'm a strong believer that if you truly deserve to be in a higher league then you'll get there sooner or later, regardless of the shit teammates you get from time to time.\n\nJust gotta Q Q Q Q Q", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377570259", "subreddit": "summoners", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It's a move that more often seems to be done by non-ace hands hoping you don't have an ace.

{"body": "My personal experience:\n\n* Provide prices. Price is usually the first question CL prospects ask for. Know that CL will rarely land bigger clients. You should be on CL for small one-off projects (usually &lt;$500).\n\n* Be clear about your terms on the ad. 30-50% up front by Paypal. No exceptions. Freelancers carry way more risk than clients. **CL clients will find any excuse not to pay up.** It's the risk you take. Anyone who bitches about this *is* going to screw you. Don't even argue with them.\n\n* Don't use stupid characters OR CAPS to attract attention. I like to use text T h a t  L o o k s  L i k e  T h i s; it stands out enough but doesn't look *too* stupid (IMO). Also, limit each line to ~70 characters. Long lines are hard to read.\n\n* Be succinct. The average joe is going to read your ad for like 5 seconds. It should be immediately clear what you can do and how much it's going to cost. Too many people basically post their resume. See below vvv\n\n* No one gives a shit about you. So many posts are like, \"Hi, I'm twelvis. I have 12 years of experience as a professional basket weaver and a PhD from the Trinidadian University of Voodoo. I like waffles. I can help you achieve your wildest dreams...\" Tell the prospect what you can do for them. Avoid \"I\" statements.\n\n* Test! CL used to allow HTML codes to be inserted that would allow you to track your viewers. Sadly, that no longer seems possible unless you jump through hoops and place an invisible imgur image, etc. However, you can still post multiple versions an ad. The time of day you post matters too. Also, try setting up different ads with different services. I got into freelancing because I discovered one particular service caught on on CL.\n\n* Pics or it (probably) didn't happen. Can you show a pic of your work? Link to your site? If not, post a stock image related to your work regardless. Text is boring.\n\n* Guide the client toward the sale. Include a call to action (e.g., email me for a quote!). Also, write what you need for the quote or to get started, otherwise you will get emails like, \"hey, how much will a site cost? I will you do it for $100?\" It's better to get 1 good prospect than 10 tire kickers.\n\n* If you do get contacted, reply ASAP, and always ask for the sale. Many prospects will mass mail dozens of potential providers and will simply hire the first to reply.

{"body": "Yeah you should learn some scales, learn some chord theory (IE: how to make a triad from a scale), then learn some simple chord progressions. Study the notes in each chord and figure out why they sound the way they do. Certain chord types go well with other chord types, that sort of thing. Then, try and come up with your own chord progressions.\n\nSimple scales that you can check are the major and minor (of which there are three nearly identical variants -- natural, harmonic and melodic) scales. You can start with an easy one like C major, which has no sharps or flats.\n\n    e|------------------------|\n    B|------------------------|\n    G|------------------------|\n    D|-----------------9-10~~-| B C(octave)\n    A|---------8-10-12--------| F G A\n    E|-8-10-12----------------| C D E\n\nBriefly: Simple chords (*triads*) have 3 *unique* notes. 3 = tri. **Tri**ad. Get it? Good. The rule for building a standard triad is 1-3-5, which means root note, third note, fifth note. The numbers represent steps up the scale, not chromatic notes. In this case, the third note is E, because the scale goes C, D, *E*, etc. The root note is whatever you happen start on. So let's say, in this key of Cmaj, you wanna build a triad on a D. So your root is D, the third is three hops *up the scale* from D, including the D as a hop. So you go D, E, F. Therefore, *F is the third*. Now, go five hops from D (or two *more* from F), including D, to get the fifth. D, E, F, G, A. So, *A is the fifth*. All three now -- **D F A**, otherwise known as a D minor triad. \n\n    e|----|\n    B|-10-| A\n    G|-10-| F\n    D|-12-| D\n    A|----|\n    E|----|\n\nWe can label chords generally with Roman numerals. In this way we can talk about a chord progression without knowledge of a key. In this case, D is the second note (also known as a *degree*) of the scale, so we label it with **ii**. We use lower case letters because it is a minor chord. If the triad was actually **D F# A**, a D major, we would use **II**. But there is no Dmaj triad in a straight C major scale. Anyway, you will have one degree for each *unique note* in the scale. This means you have seven degrees (C major -- C D E F G A B). If I were to write a chord progression as I-IV-V, you could take that information and play that progression in any key and it would have the same sense of tension and release (mostly -- some people will argue that certain keys sound different even with the same chord progression). You don't need to know the exact chords because you use your chord building skills to say \"OK, that's a IV, so it's a major triad built off the fourth scale degree.\"\n\nSo what I would suggest is do this to every scale degree, build all seven chords. Then learn to play them fluently. Then start coming up with progressions. Does a **ii** go well with a **iii**? Or does it go better with a **vi**? Whatever, go to town. Look at other chord progressions, and try to figure them out in terms of scale degrees (Roman numerals). You might find that a lot of stuff follows a basic back bone of chord progressions and they just tweak stuff here and there or add an extra voice (a fourth unique note). This is how you get add9 chords and such.\n\nOK that wasn't very brief but whatever, hope it helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377665146", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK, then I'd recommend learning scalar construction. This will get you more mileage when you get into more advanced concepts and help you deal with alternate tunings better. Instead of simply looking up tablature or sheet music telling you what a major or minor scale consists of, construct it yourself on the fretboard.\n\nThe fretboard consists of twelve distinct tones in reality (as I'm sure you know), but each fret represents a half-step. Every two frets represents a whole-step. So how do you go about constructing a major scale, then? Just remember the simple formula:\n\nwhole whole half whole whole whole half\n\nIf you follow this, the first not and the last note will be the same, just an octave apart. Observe with the C Major scale.\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\n w w h w w w h\n\nYou can do this with any note, natural, sharp, flat, whatever, and you'll get a major scale! Constructing it yourself, at least in my experience, helps you retain the notes better. Otherwise you're just remembering patterns and shapes - which is fine if you only intend on playing in E standard, even going a half-step down throws off your entire theory and will trip you up if you go *just* on patterns.\n\nSay you wanted to create the major scale for Bb Major, it'd be as follows:\n\nBb C D Eb F G A Bb\n\nBut wait! There's **more**! What about minor scales? We can't just play in major scales all the time. Well, you just shift the formula above. The 6th note of every major scale is also it's relative minor. So, when you want to get A Minor, you just begin the formula starting from the A above, as follows:\n\nA B C D E F G A\n\nor\n\nw h w w h w w\n\nNow you can work forward and backward in those scales and if you can find a root of a chord, you know what potentially will run over it cleanly. Major and minors are the place to start. Once you get these, pentatonics are actually easy, harmonic minors are basically the same, and exotic scales are where you're shooting for. Why? Because they'll help you understand modulating and shifting far better than anything else.\n\nHope this helped and get to sheddin' so you can get to shreddin'!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377696732", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, there are a few things you can do. Any given collection can be arranged in an order yes? So arrange it in that order and then find the following forms: the retrograde (write the last note first, the next to last note second, etc. With the first note of the original Form being last). The inversion (start in the first pitch and every time you move up in the original Form, you move down by the same amount. So if you move from C to D in the original, you would move C to B-flat in the inverted version). Then the retrograde inversion (take the inverted Form and retrograde it). \n\nThus, the line C D F E has the retrograde E F D C, the inverted Form C B-flat G A-flat, and the retrograde-inversion A-flat G B-flat C.\n\nNow, we can do what are called permutations, which is taking this collection of notes and freely swapping the order. You can also do what some call \"circular permutations,\" which preserves the basic order, but will take the first element and put it last, and continue this process until you come back around to the beginning. \n\nThus, some free permutations of the prime Form of the above motive is:\n\nCDFE, CDEF, CEDF, ECDF, ECFD, EFCD, FECD, FEDC, FDEC, DFEC, DFCE, and DCFE. \n\nCircular permutations of the motive are:\n\nCDFE, DFEC, FECD, and ECDF\n\nNotice that the circular permutations can all be obtained using free permutations, but restricting yourself to circulars can be useful if you feel you have too much material. \n\nNow you have 4 forms of thematic material each with 12 permutations (4 of which are circular). Thus you have a total of 48 ways of using this ideas (note, some cases might have overlap, so you might not have 48 distinct ways of using the motive, but you can just elimate one of the duplicates). \n\nOne final motivic technique. This isn't used by that many composers, but I know Gershwin uses it in the opening bars of his I Got Rhythm Variations (the opening clarinet melody and the piano part that follows it, before the rest of the orchestra comes in). He also uses it in an orchestral interlude in Porgy and Bass, but I forget the exact spot. \n\nThe technique involves taking the intervals of your motive and multiplying them by an integer. You can do this with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. If you multiply by 7, you would get the inversion of the motive that comes from multiplying by 5, 8 would be the inversion of the x4 one, etc. \n\nSo, CDFE has the following intervals (1=a semitone), +2, +3, -1. Multiplied by two gives you +4, +6, -2. X3 = +6, +9, -3. X4 = +8, +12, - 4. X5 = +10, +15, -5. And X6 = +12, +18, -6\n\nThis, when you translate into pitches becomes:\n\nX1 = C D F E\n\nX2 = C E Ab Gb\n\nX3 = C Gb Eb C\n\nX4 = C Ab Ab E\n\nX5 = C Bb Db Ab\n\nX6 = C C F# C\n\nAs you can see, not all of these are that great. X3 and X4 always give you some Form of the diminished 7 and augmented triad, respectively, and X6 just gives you octaves and tritones. X2 effectively translates your motive into a whole-tone space, which can be useful, and the X5 variant gives you an almost unrecognizable new motive. Usually I restrict myself to just the X1 and X5 variants, and have many times found myself preferring the X5 variant over my original. \n\nOf course, once you have the X5 version, you can do all of the inversion, retrograde, and permutation operations I described earlier. Giving you another 48 ways of using the motive (before eliminating duplicates). \n\nWhat I've described can potentially net you 288 ways of using a single 4 note idea. If you restrict yourself to just x1 and x5, the number becomes 96. If you further reduce it to just circular permutations, you reduce it to a much more manageable 32 forms. \n\nOf course, using a motive containing more than four notes gives you more possible permutations, thus increasing the amount of material resulting from it. This is partially why early atonalists used such a small collection of motives (usually three note like the 014 they loved so much) , so they didn't get lost in a sea of too much material to use. \n\nThere's a relevant quote from stravinsky or someone talking about how composer's should learn to work in a boundary or they could end up rambling. But I have written enough for one post and can't find the energy to search for it. \n\nEdit: I dug up an old composition notebook of mine and found a choral piece where I went through this while process. So you can see exactly how it worked. http://imgur.com/a/myC7h\n\nIn the top part of the first image you see the original motive. Then the rest of that image is all the x1 forms. Each line is either the prime, inverse, retrograde, or inverse retrograde. Every \"measure\" is a circular permutation. In the second image, you see me do the same thing for the x5 Form. Note that I did not use all of them, I put stars over the resulting material that I liked, and then used that as my surface material. Hope this is a helpful illustration!

{"body": "I saw this a few minutes ago on facebook. Check out the comments on the official posting from the upworthy facebook page. One guy put down a huge number of sources used to claim that the inequity is very high. I was unsure of which person he was replying to, though.\n\nI am copying the sources here for those who are interested. Note: I have not read any of these to decide if they support any conclusion one way or another. For people with time, though, these may be interesting to look at and compare to studies that claim different. I also noticed that Warren Farrel's book is in the list, which generally indicates the opposite of what the poster used this list to claim. Other articles are obviously indicative of the recent occurrence of women earning more than men (childless, under 30 category). I don't know what the indicates about the rest of this, and I claim no allegiance or support for the list.

{"body": "Which needs to be taken in the context of the linked article, which is about one of the sources of the growing justice gap when it comes to the prosecution of rape cases, due to biased positions and treatment. This isn't a claim that all drunk sex is rape, but that there are multiple harmful myths that still vitiate the judicial process, including at the court level (meaning that even cases of nonconsensual sex is consistently not considered rape if the victim was inebriated -). FTA:\n\n&gt;The ‘cultural conceptions’ of rape re f e rred to here are often described as ‘myths’, since they\ndo not reflect the reality of rape. We prefer to discuss powerful stereotypes that function to\nlimit the definition of what counts as ‘real rape’, in terms of the contexts and re l a t i o n s h i p s\nwithin which sex without consent takes place. As a number of re s e a rchers and legal scholars\nhave pointed out (see, for example, Estrich, 1987; Myhill and Allen, 2002; Du Mont. et al,\n2000), despite extensive legal re f o rm, ‘real rapes’ continue to be understood as those\ncommitted by strangers, involving weapons and documented injury. The failure of criminal\njustice systems to address these stereotypes means that the processes involved in responding\nto re p o rted rapes – from early investigation through to court room advocacy – can serve to\nreinforce, rather than challenge, narrow understandings of the crime of rape, who it happens\nto and who perpetrates it. \n\n&gt;&gt;The attrition process itself reflects, and reproduces, these patterns.\nAttrition presents problems other than low conviction rates. It both originates in and\nleads to the perpetuation of myths and differential treatment of rape cases as\ncompared to all other crimes.

{"body": "So most \"numbered\" chords -- 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th chords, specifically -- are based on diatonic thirds (this means the note *names* go up by thirds, but the accidentals can be whatever).  So a C13 of some sort might be C Eb G B Db F# A#.  It probably wouldn't be because that combination sounds terrible.  But it could be, in theory.  It has seven notes, which are all of the notes of the diatonic scale.  If you take a CM13 chord -- C E G B D F A -- you could voice it C D E F G A B, which sounds like a hardcover music theory book to the face.  This kind of thing is just not very useful.\n\nHowever, we have a convention where you can remove notes from these chords to make them easier to handle.  We've decided that, so long as the chord has a 7th, the other notes don't matter so much in naming the chord.  So I'd voice a G13 chord as G F B E, and G7b13 as G F B Eb, because I happen to really like the way those sound.  I've seen some Brazilian guitar charts using this wonderful chord G# F B E, with a name that really made no sense (it's an E7b9 in inversion, but it was labeled something else involving an Ab).  To make a 13th chord, the usual thing to do is to include the root, the third if it's major, the seventh, and the thirteenth.  There's a \"rule\" that you shouldn't have minor ninths in the chord unless you really mean them -- because they usually sound *awful* with a few exceptions -- so you'd normally put the 13 above the b7 (in my G13 chord, the E above the F) instead of the other way around.  You can switch the third out for some other note, like the 11th, 9th, or even the 5th if you think it's worth using it (the 5th is boring most of the time).  Pay attention to what's on the melody, too; you might be able to get away with switching out another note if one of the important chord tones is in the melody.  Finally, there aren't *really* any rules; if the chart says G13 and you decide to omit the 7th and play a G6, nobody's going to come to kill you over it.\n\nI usually voice dominant 9th chords 1 3 b7 9 (not usually in order, I guess; depends on which strings I use), major 9th chords 1 5 7 9, and minor 9th chords 1 5 b7 9.  Sometimes I do 1 3 7 9 and 1 b3 b7 9 for the major and minor 9th chords.  You can get away with omitting the third, but it is a conscious choice here.  The third can be a very rich note, but sometimes that's not the sound you want.\n\nThere are also chords that *don't* have 7ths.  They're add9 chords and 6th chords, and of course, 6/9 chords.  You should *not* use a 7th in those.  For add9, you should figure out which note should be on top, because the sound will vary.  A 6 chord is 1 3 5 6, or 1 b3 5 6 for a m6 chord, and while you can skip the 5 in a 6 chord, you probably shouldn't in a m6.  The way I play the m6, it's usually 1 6 b3 5, so that a Gm6 would usually be 6th string 3rd fret, 4th string 2nd fret, 3rd string 3rd fret, 2nd string 3rd fret.  A 6/9 chord is usually 1 3 6 9.\n\nBy the way, the way I've usually seen it, scale degrees are written as Arabic numerals, not Roman.  I actually learned to write them with a \\^ on top, but that's harder to do while typing.  Roman numerals are reserved for chords.  So if you're in C, V is the G major chord, while 5 (or 5 with a \\^ on top) is the G note itself.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377901602", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I feel your pain. I've been there. Playing too big in poker, or in any gamble, is quite the drug. Without exaggeration I have won and lost literally 4x that amount of money in under two weeks. So here's what you need to do.\n-\n=\n1.Stop playing for a while and don't think about poker. How? The Freudian defense mechanism, \"sublimation,\" which is redirecting your energy to other things. It will help you to stop obsessing and allow you to rebuild. It will remind you there are things other than poker. For example, you can exercise or learn to play a musical instrument or start writing or drawing or focusing on your schoolwork, etc.\n\n2. Do not play poker until you do not *want* to play poker. Not when you're anxious to get to the table - that was your mistake before. Not when you're scared to get to the table - what's the point? You'll be nervous enough when the time comes. As long as you're chasing money you'll fail. Poker's a game. Lose sight of that and you'll be miserable no matter how much you make.\n2. When you do return to the game do not put more on the table than you would be OK with losing. That's not to say you shouldn't take the game seriously - you're playing for money, after all - but one thing you can learn from the micro stakes guys is how they manage risk. No one bet is going to break them. No one game will crush their souls. The flipside is, of course, that no one bet will *make* them either. C'est la vie. Risk management, son, is the name of the game. Doyle Brunson said he was never afraid of losing any amount of money because he knew how fast he could make it back. You need to understand how dangerous that is. It may sound heroic or cool or brave but, and I speak from experience here, that's the voice of a man who can very easily find himself in a hole he'll never climb out of.\n\n2.Understand that poker is gambling. Most of the regular posters here want to believe - and would have you believe along with them - that poker is more than anything else a game of skill. As you likely know there's no amount of skill that can stop you from losing. The only way not to lose any money is not to play and the only way not to lose any money in one hand is to fold. Don't be unhappy if you lose a little in a session. Don't be unhappy if you break even. Don't think your skill is paying off just because you win a few, even if you win big. Even if it *was* skill. Start believing your legend and you are f u c k e d. An anecdote to this is that several WSOP champs play in my local either regularly or time to time. A lot of the time they're playing 1/2. Actually last night I played with [Lori Bender](http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&amp;n=129777). Not a big time super-star, but definitely better than the majority of folks here. And she was in for $400. Several bigger-name folks come by also and they (mostly) don't gamble so huge. A couple of my biggest poker accomplishments are having won a couple hands against them. Didn't get rich, just validated my reads. I'm rambling - my point is you'd think that a big cash (120k for a few nights?) would change your world. It won't. It goes as fast as it comes. Ask Protential, probably the best player on this board, or look at his recent graph posts. Play sensibly. You can't win just because you're good. Remember that and you'll not rely on it so much or gamble so big.\n\n3.**Bankroll Management.** You, my boy, have a gambling problem. I don't think you're going to stop playing. So when you look at your expenses and your income think about what each dollar gets you. Are you willing to put a month's rent on the line? How many buyins would that be for you? If you dip below that can you trust yourself not to put more on the table? There's a reason casinos are in business, and it's not because losers stay home. If you can't get in at the casino for a reasonable bankroll just play home or bar games. **Don't risk more than you can make back fast at a real job!!**\n=\nFinally, tell yourself that you suck at poker. There's a statement in Japanese, \"Watakshi wa mushi desu-yo.\" It means, I am but a bug. Now there's a chance you're a poker god. There's a chance you're even just decent. There's also a chance you suck absolutely shit. Doesn't matter. Humility to yourself, even if you are a braggart to others, will keep you from getting too big for yourself. It will help you fold, it will help you read others, it will help you give up the money. There's a lot to learn from the old guys who play limit and fold the second nuts to a river raise. There's a reason that kind of discipline comes with age.\n-\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1377916678", "subreddit": "poker", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

But we were calculating WITHOUT ITEMS.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But keep insulting, reported your comment to the mods and hope they ban you for spreading lies and insults.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; With full CDR Amumu goes to\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2106 flat + 24.7% HP +4.9 AP\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Again not counting Amumus W AP Scaling and his passive or his E passive, which would easily give him the edge over Zac.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So damagewise Amumu is better with AP. \n\n\n\nYou can cast his E point blank with no damn channel and you know this because I assume you've played Zac at least once.\n\nAnd I like how you just dropped giving the numbers of abilities in your CDR analysis.  For anyone reading, it's because his initial analysis WAS for 40% CDR amumu - unless he can explain how he thought a 6 second CD tantrum could be cast 3 times in 9 seconds.  That's why I calculated it with CDR for Zac as well - and also because the whole point is that Zac benefits MORE from CDR due to how his W works.  \n\nI also just adore how Amumu's percent damage MYSTERIOUSLY went up from 24.3% to 24.7% in the new \"CDR\" analysis, even though his W doesn't scale at all with CDR.  You're adorable, really.  \n\nAnd yes, we could include more analysis - after all, Tantrum can be spammed if Mumu is focused, and there's that passive to consider. But, really, this is all silly.  Zac does more damage than Amumu in any realistic scenario (N O B O D Y is standing in Despair 100% of the time, but it's easy to get hit by 3 Zac W's considering Zac SLOWS YOU) - but I don't have to theorycraft it, I can see it, you can see it, the pros can see it.  \n\nAnd even if it were TRUE that Amumu did more damage than Zac (let's be clear, it's not), that wouldn't mean Zac was fine because - and this may shock some of you like AmansRevenger - they're completely different champions and Zac's power does NOT stem from his AoE teamfight damage alone.  You see, there are a number of other differences between Zac and Amumu.  Amumu has mana, for instance, and doesn't get healed for using his abilities, for instance, and, even though he's undead, he stays dead when he's killed.  Also, there's the whole Amumu Q not having Zac's E range and having to hit somebody to move him thing.
