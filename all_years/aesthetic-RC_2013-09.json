You risk getting rear-ended if you cannot enter the flow of traffic smoothly.\n\n**AMEN**!!!!!\n\nSimply learn to judge the speed of approaching traffic, if they are going to have to adjust to your fat ass lumbering out onto the road (lalalala!) then wait a few seconds - or *you're* an *asshole!*\n\nHere's my rant, \n\nWhen you merge onto a highway, YOU have the obligation - the O B L I G A T I O N to adjust your speed accordingly so you can 'fit' into the flow of traffic.   This means, you don't *expect* people to get out of your way and change lanes into the left lane so you have space to enter.  While they also have an obligation, *they* may not be able to because of approaching cars in the passing lane.  As the person merging you should be paying the fuck attention to this or YOU are the cause of the accident!   \n\nMerging involves speeding up, accelerating (sometimes quickly!) so that you can enter traffic with the *least* amount of disturbance.   That's why there's a LOOOOOOOONG lane in which to do this!   Moving into traffic slowly, *then* accelerating not only makes you dangerous, but it also makes you complete selfish asshole!  I see this every day on the Vanier.  MORONs merging in off Hanwell (eastbound).   Then the happy assholes later merging in from Kimble or Wilsey (westbound) and driving at 60 or 70 km/hr as they enter a flow of traffic doing 90-110 km/hr.   Are you people blind?  Are you afraid of your accelerator?  Were you beaten with a gas pedal as a child and now have an aversion to it?  You are going to kill someone some day because you don't know what you're doing!\n\nAlternately, when you are exiting the highway (any highway) you slow down AFTER you have left your lane and entered the exit.  See, that's why there's like a half a fucking kilometer of exit road for *deceleration!*   You DO NOT decelerate *on the highway* because you want to exit.  You are not making a right turn here - it's gently veers *so you don't have to slow down!*   So explain *why* so many idiot decide they are going to exit, and slow from 110 km/hr to like 80, *then* move out of traffic onto the exit ramp?

I truly do not understand how stupid you have to be to have taken from my post \"hurr durr the WSJ made him hate regulation with their article!\" when I actively pointed out that regulation one way or the other is not the problem here. \n\nthere is no problem regulating dangerous toys that have no business being around children...\n\n1) but this is NOT a toy, and not intended for sale as a toy, and wasn't sold with other toys in toy stores. the only way a child could have gotten one was to have had an adult give it to them, or purchase it for themselves and they got into it by proximity. Is it the responsibility of every company selling an item to maintain how it is used, and who has access, after the item has been sold and taken home? Of fucking course not. They would have no way of guaranteeing what happens to an item after it has left the store. This is the same with *literally any other item you buy*. How are buckyballs any different?\n\n2) since we've established that it is not a toy, your straw man argument for bringing back all dangerous toys is moot. I never said that, no one did, and it is a straw man to distract from the fact that this IS about personal responsibility! How is the CEO, *personally liable* for a child eating a product that some idiot parent left lying around, or some adult **who doesn't even have children** had in their office and the kid was visiting with their parent or guardian? Think about the gymnastics in logic you have to go through to make this work: the CEO, who has no knowledge or awareness of where this product ended up, is responsible for ensuring that your kid never comes into contact with his product, but the Parent **who is right fucking there** with their kid bears no responsibility at all for purchasing a product they know is not intended for children (package has warning labels), from a store that doesn't sell toys for kids (it was not sold in toy stores or stores where other childrens items were available), and for giving it or leaving it out for them unsupervised when it's obvious *just by looking at them* that they could easily be swallowed? \n\nWhat the fuck? So now no adult can purchase anything for themselves, because someone *elses* kid might get hurt by them if they come over? How about the parent just watches their damn fuck trophy and prevents them from eating stuff that ISNT FOOD! Do you turn around and hold your neighbor responsible for your kid eating dogshit off the sidewalk? I mean, he left dogshit where anyone could just put it in their mouth and get sick right? \n\nThe point is the CEO *can't* be held personally liable for any of this shit, because he's not around to police who is and isn't using his product as directed. There are hundreds of thousands of items intended for adults that a kid could misuse and get hurt on. This isn't the companies or CEO's fault -- it is the PARENTS fault. If you know kids just pick up and eat anything, doesn't it behoove you as a parent to look around a room you're about to leave your precious snowflake in to see what hazards might be there? Why does the rest of the world who have no children have to bend over backwards to accommodate you? If a restaurant can boot you for having a rowdy kid disturbing patrons, why must the purchasing decisions and market availability of a product be limited for individuals because you have a kid down the street? Why is your decision to create helpless suicide machines preventing me from buying a neat desk toy? That is the cusp of the argument here. You can argue all day long that these toys are dangerous for kids -- but since it's not meant for kids, isn't sold to kids, and the kid is under your supervision -- why is it anyone else's job to babysit YOUR KID!?\n\nWhen your kid is behind your back for a second and swallows something, no it doesn't make you a bad parent - its an accident. Accidents happen and are a normal part of children growing up. But then to say \"there ought to be a law\" is so fucking selfish on the parents part its disgusting. We should all lose out on something we want because you didn't drill into your toddler hard enough \"don't put metal in your mouth\"? Stop trying to blame other people for what is at best a blame-less accident and at worst your shortfalls at parenting.

Four main dialects come to be recorded and analyzed as the Spaniards rapidly tried to proselytize Catholicism in the country, and translating the Bible and baptizing the natives were easy steps in assimilating the newly colonized indigenous peoples. \n\nThe sound inventory of the language grows, namely the following sounds:\n\nA E I O U (the distinction between E/I and O/U becomes marked)\n\nthe addition of Roman letters in the alphabet, namely C CH D F J Ñ Q R V X and Z\n\nThis is when the distinction Filipino comes in: the islands were named as such in honor of Philip II (even here you see this distinction of Philip / Felipe in Spanish and English naming convention), as \"Las Islas Filipinas.\" Natives and citizens come to be called Filipinos and Filipinas. \n\nThe vocabulary of the language is so well-populated and interactive with Spanish that it comes to account up to about 45% of the language having Spanish roots to this day. \n\n**Colonialism Part 2: English**\n\nFor a brief few years during the Seven Years' War the Philippines becomes an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, which sees its first major interaction with English, though the bulk of the English fascination in the language comes after 1898 (when the Philippines is ceded by Spain to the United States, along with Puerto Rico). The Americans stay in the US until after World War II and don't fully recognize Philippine independence until 1946. \n\nThe sounds of the language respond to the now unwieldy Spanish alphabet, which was:\n\nA B C CH D E F G H I J K L M N Ñ NG O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \n\nThe distinction of sounds deepens with pairs like B/V and P/F, strengthened by other sound pairs like D/R, L/R, and S/CH. Other digraphs that represent sounds become better distinguished, like SH for traditional Filipino spelling SIY; CH for TIY; J for DIY, etc. \n\nEnglish naming convention calls the archipelago \"the Philippine Islands,\" which then gets shortened to \"the Philippines.\"\n\n**Modern Responses to Change**\n\nThe biggest push for a Filipino that was standardized was addressed in the early 20th century, while the Philippines had some sovereignty while in the US system of territories. At first, the official languages were simply English and Spanish; administratively speaking, Tagalog, the northern dialect spoken near the capital, was also an everyday language that was used in tandem but not in official proceedings. \n\nAfter American independence the push for a firmer national identity was led by Ferdinand Marcos; after an unsuccessful nacionalista regime the language was finally standardized by a governing body that essentially placed Tagalog as the standard for Filipino, though it was not the most widely spoken language in the archipelago proper. \n\nThis is when the identifying nationalistic demonym switched very subtly from Filipino to Pilipino, as a nod back to history. \n\nTL;DR: thanks to colonialism, \"Filipinos\" can thank the Spaniards and the prevailing influence of American Imperialism for \"the Philippines.\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378103495", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Being able to improvise is really a matter of knowing some theory. Once you know how a chord is constructed (i.e. which notes are in the chord) you can then use those notes while the chord is being played. This first bit will be on how to Solo over Chord progressions and explain briefly how Triad Chords are constructed from Scales.\n\nThe C Major Scale goes:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nHere's an example of a chord progression in the Key of C (derived from the C Major Scale):\n\n| C | F | G | C |\n\nAlternatively by Roman Numeral Analysis\n\n| I | IV | V | I |\n\n\nEach of these chords is considered a Triad. Meaning that it is composed of three tones played at the same time. So let's move through what each of these chords is composed of. Major Triad Chords always use The Root (1), Third (3), and Fifth (5) tone. These tones are taken from Scales, as the one written out above. These specific Major Triads are spelled out below with the note names (the tones that are being played at the same time).\n\nC (Called C Major): C E G\n\nF (Called F Major): F A C\n\nG (Called G Major): G B D\n\nC (Called C Major): C E G\n\nNow, while these chords are being played, you can play any of those three notes in any order that you'd like and they will all be in Harmony with the chord being played. Ideally, what you'd like to do is find Common Tones that the next chord shares.\n\nYou can see that the note C is a Common Tone with C and F. So to ease the transition from the C chord being played to the next F chord being played, you could make the last note of your Melodic Progression (solo) in the measure that C Major is being played the note C then move on to playing F, A, or C during the measure that F Major is being played. Using Common Tones in this way will make your Melodic Progressions (commonly called Solos) far smoother. Now you'll run into a problem sometimes when there is no Common Tone between two different Triads. Like the F Major to G Major Chords. This is easily solved by using the 7th. A 7th is the 7th note in a scale. A Scale being a run of 8 notes. In this example chord progression you are in the Key of C. There are NO Sharps or Flats in the key of C (making it the easiest to improvise in). So let's look at the C Major Scale again for a moment: \n\nThe C Major Scale goes:\nC D E F G A B C\n\nWhen looking to move from one Chord to the next, you can use the Scale of the Chord that you are moving too to find the correct 7th to use. In this case you are moving from F Major to G Major. So you would look at the Scale (and thus Key) for G.\n\nThe G Major Scale goes:\nG A B C D E F# G\n\nIf you give each tone a number then you can see that the 7th is F#.\n\n1  2  3  4  5  6   7     8\n\nG  A  B  C D  E  F# G\n\nBut remember! In the key of C (The key that the Chord Progression is being played in) there are NO Sharps of Flats. Which means you would simply play F Natural.\nThe 7th is called the Leading Tone. It \"Leads\" to the next note, which is one Octave above the Root or Tonic note of the scale. So when you hit F Natural before moving to the G Major Chord, it would remain in harmony and continue to \"sound right\". From there you can see that G Major and C Major DO have a Common Tone, being G. So you could play G before moving into that final C Major chord and remain in Harmony. Repeating that as you go along and repeat the progression.\n\nAs for the ability to jam simply playing chords that comes from figuring out what Chord Progressions sound good. The 12 Bar Blues Progression is a very popular one and is as follows\n\n|  I  | IV | I | I |\n\n| IV | IV | I | I |\n\n| V  | IV | I | V |\n\nNow, that may not mean much if you don't understand the Theory behind it, so I'll put it into the Key of C for your and hopefully you'll get a better understanding of how it works if you look over the Scales again (if not feel free to ask me anything you'd like).\n\n| C | F | C | C |\n\n| F | F | C | C |\n\n| G | F | C | G |\n\nFrom there you just continue to repeat that pattern and you're playing a basic blues progression in the Key of C Major. The reason why I gave it to you in Roman Numerals first, is because you can use that formula to then play the same progression in ANY key and boom! You can look at someone and say,\"12  Bar Blues in the key of G\" and if they know their theory, they will know what chords to play with out you telling them what to play. \n\nI hope this has been helpful! \n\nAny Questions, feel free to ask.\n\n**Edits: For clarity**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378105722", "subreddit": "musicians", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Um, this seems like an absolute awful way to learn modes/scales. \n\nFirst off, it doesn't even demonstrate the point of the scales. \n\nHere's how to use this:\n\nStep 1: don't\n\nStep 2: Learn that every harmony (Can be just one bar, one part, one sectoin, the entire song) has one note that is emphasized. This is called the tonic. So when you play a Gmajor chord with the notes G B D, guess what, the most important note there, it's the G, also the lowest note is usually the most emphasized note, so a lot of the time it's the tonic.\n\nStep 3: Learn that there are only 12 notes and one tonic and you gotta learn what each of those relationships are. They are called intervals. Usually written by I ii II iii III IV (tritone) V vi VI vii VII.\n\nListed these are called:\n\n- I - Tonic\n- ii - Minor Second (Second)\n- II - Major Second (Second)\n- iii - Minor Third (Third)\n- III - Major Third (Third)\n- IV - Perfect Forth (Forth)\n- tritone - Tritone (Special) &lt;-- Notice this is the middle, symmetry\n- V - Perfect Fifth (Fifth)\n- vi - Minor Sixth (Sixth)\n- VI - Major Sixth (Sixth)\n- vii - Minor Seventh (Seventh)\n- VII - Major Seventh (Seventh)\n- I - Unison (Tonic)\n\nNow, lets simplify this, this is too much, lets just get the meat and potatos, notice there are multiple \"versions\" of each degree (Major Third vs Minor Third), lets only concentrate on what each type of interval does:\n\n\n- Tonic - It's the tonic, it's pure consonance, it sounds 100% perfect with itself. \n- Second - It makes the tonic want to move since it's so close to the tonic. Major vs Minor has just different characteristics, I haven't fully discovered them yet.\n- Third - It gives the tonic a \"feeling\" so to speak, it makes it not so neutral forcing the tonic to sound either happy (Major) or sad (Minor)\n- Fourth - Sounds really consonant with the tonic, but it leaves this openness feeling. It sounds good, but it needs resolve. It needs to move, but it doesn't demonstrate actually where it will go, just that it will go.\n- Fifth - Gives the tonic stabillity. It just reinforces the tonic and makes it stronger. Very neutral, but it can use thirds to make it say something. (Also called Power Chord)\n- Sixth - I don't know what this one is used for. All a part of the experience, figuring this stuff out. Major vs Minor does do something, but I don't know what either does.\n- Seventh - Makes the tonic want to resolve itself back to itself. Minor is farther away so it does this less, but the major makes your brain scream for the unison.\n- Unison - It's the tonic, but an octave up.\n\n\nNow what do these things have to do with scales? Everything. What do these have to do with chords? Everything. A scale is a chord, a chord is a scale, a scale is a harmony, a harmony is a chord.\n\nGuess what, you know that riff you do thats E E B E C B G F# E. Guess what, when you play that riff, to your brain your just playing a chord that has a tonic, a second, a third, a fifth, &amp; a sixth. \n\nSo when you create a riff or a chord, think of it like building a sandwich out of intervals. \n\nYou start with a E, E is the tonic. Now what does this E sandwich need. We got the meat, but that's all it is. I need to make it spicy, I need it to give an emotion, so lets throw a third on there, I want it to be minor, you know make it a bit dark. \n\nSo we got E and the minor third. Minor third would be how many frets up? Let's count. So Tonic 0, minor second 1fretup, major second 2fretsup, minor third 3fretsup. So lets move 3 frets up, that note is a G. So G is the minor third. Lets throw it on there.\n\nBoom, E G. Wonderful, we added the spicy cheese, but this meat patty and cheese is just so mushy and hard to eat, lets go ahead and throw on some bread to strengthen our now turned chord. (A chord is 2 or more intervals interacting with each other) \n\nWhat interval adds strengh? Move up the list and find it. \n\nOkay, so I hope you chose the fifth, because that's what it is. Using guitarist knowledge we know what a power chord is (Note: A power chord isn't a chord, it's just an interval) So using this knowledge we probably know that on the lower strings you can just move one string down and two frets over. I'll save some time and tell you, the fifth of E is B.\n\nSo now this has got E, G, &amp; B.  Guess what, this triad (Three notes together) that we just made. It's E minor the chord. We built a chord. Now, go do the Eminor chord that you already know, literally finger it on your fretboard, you might be thinking. \"But I press like 6 different notes to do this, E minor cant be just 3 notes\" Well, manually figure out what all notes you're playing.\n\nNow assuming your doing a typical 0 2 2 0 0 0 version the notes come out to be E B E G B E. Okay, so cool. You now know that you can double certain intervals to change the sound or the voicing of the chord. This particular version has three tonics which really nail in that this chord emphasizes the E. Then there are two fifths to add extra stability and just one third to give it that tonality. You can double up on thirds, but it will change the sound, which is okay.\n\nNow, that is how you build a chord. Now let's build a scale. \n\nYeah, we're building a scale, we're not learning a scale. Why not be creative when learning? \n\nSo we start with the tonic, that's a given, you can't not have a tonic, you kinda can, but it's called chromatic, and it's farther and deeper into music theoirjkesljafdlk;fjskldj, lets just move on. \n\nGot a tonic, now which second do we want? For this example I'm just gonna choose the major because the major 2nd just seems like a nicer movement to me. So we got a tonic and a major second.\n\nLet's move on to thirds, I want a happy song, so lets go ahead and choose the major third.\n\nSo we got a tonic, a major second which allows the scale to move in a happy way, a major third which gives the entire scale a happy feeling, and now on to the fourth. Now we only really have one to choose one, because it's perfect, but the tritone can be interpreted as a different kind of fourth. But I don't want to get into that. Let's just choose the perfect fourth. \n\nThe tritone isn't really up for being in the scale because it's like this weird note that can pretend to be a fourth or a fifth depending on the situation. So let's move on to the fifth. Which is a perfect and we don't want it to be a tritone.\n\nSo with the fourth and fifth being already chosen for us, lets add a major 6th for some reason (I still don't know how it affects the scale), and I want a seventh in my scale that really praises the tonic and wants it to suceed. So obviously I want the Major seventh because it just screams that it wants to be that unison or tonic. \n\nSo we got a Tonic, Major Second, Major Third, Perfect Fourth, Perfect Fifth, Major Sixth, &amp; Major Seventh. (Unison is implied)\n\nGuess what, you just invented the Major scale. Whats a minor scale you ask? Well, most would assume we just take all the majors and make them minor.\nSo Tonic, Minor Second, Minor Third, Perfect Fourth, Perfect Fifth, Minor Sixth &amp; Minor Seventh. And you would be kind of right, but that Minor Second is just such an ugly interval that we want the nice happy movement in the scale, so let's stick with the Major Second, but keep all the others minor.\n\nSo the minor scale actually is Tonic, MAJOR Second, Minor Third, Perfect Fourth, Perfect Fifth, Minor Sixth &amp; Minor Seventh.\n\nOkay, so what you should do now is make your own scales. Choose eight notes (Just for now to understand things better), and choose what you want minor/major for different reasons. \n\nNow you know scales and you are able to play them, YES.\n\n\nWait......\n\n\nYou don't know how to play them. Damnit.\n\nOkay, I'll just show you how to do all the intervals from the low E string up to the first unison, and that's it. You can figure out the patterns for tonic being on the A string, and the tonic being on the D string, etc etc. \n\nBut just to get you started on your musical adventure, I'll tell you the fret positions for the C Chromatic Scale (Basically all 12 notes/intervals)\n\nSo these notes are C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C. These are all the notes in the western music style. Learn them. Basically you start with any letter (doesnt havent to be C), then you do it and a sharp EXCEPT for B &amp; E. So look through again, each note has a sharp (#) except the B &amp; E. Think breakfast &amp; Eggs, or breaking and entering, I don't care, just remember that those two notes are the only ones that don't have sharps. There's no reason that they specifically are this way, it's just how we chose to do it to make the C major scale easier to learn. (C major is C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R ) Wait thats wrong ( C D E F G A B C)\n\nAnyways, so starting at the 8th fret on the LOW E string, or the high one, it's still C, but for this pattern we're on the low E string.\n\n    e ----------------------------------\n    B ----------------------------------\n    G ----------------------------------\n    D ----------------------6 7 8 9 10--\n    A -------------7 8 9 10-------------\n    E -- 8 9 10 11----------------------\n\nAnd all that is in order is the original I ii II iii III IV tritone V vi VI vii VII I\n\nSo 10 on the D string is C. \n\nI wasn't planning on writing all that, but whatever.

{"body": "Okay, lets see if I can help you out here:\n\nThe name of a chord is derived from its root, so in the case of C, yes C is the root note (tone) for that chord.\n\nMostly yes, from my experience there is an agreed upon progression and key when people get together to jam (improvise). It can be memorized or written down on a Lead Sheet and handed out. Jamming isn't really less improvisation. What people are doing for the most part, while playing an instrument that is capable of being melodic, is improvising a lead/solo over a chord progression.  Another -VERY- common chord progression is | I | V | vi | IV |. The Axis of Awesome has a GREAT video on this, [stop for a second and check it out here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ&amp;list=PL2grZd5tn9mVePpGQV2h8AVBsUu7kAq4r). \n\nWelcome back! \n\nAs you can see, those songs are melodically different, though they are using the same progression of | I | V | vi | IV |.  An instrument only playing chords will have a bit of a harder time (or at least I think) being improvisational because they are following the road map, but that doesn't mean you're not jamming and cant switch it up.\nWhen I was in a music harmony class we spelled out chords to 13ths in each scale out loud. So example, in the key of C we would say: \n\nC E G B D F A (that makes a C13 chord) \n\nThen we'd move on to the next Key, F and say: \n\nF A C E G Bb D (F13 chord)\n\nThings like that, memorizing and working with scales and The Circle of Fifths will really help you out. It will also then give you the chance to make changes and be more improvisational with simply playing chords when you learn how to modulate (move from key to key).\n\nTips for remembering scales? Repetition. Pratcise mekas prefect. Practesi makse pertfec. Practice makes perfect.\n\nSame progression different strumming pattern? \n\nYes, it will remain in harmony. Though that doesn't mean that it will make sense Rhythmically.\n\nYes, you can play two different chords together and have it not sound horrible. It's a matter of Common Tones again.\nIf you can find a keyboard play these notes all at once:\n\nC E G E G B\n\nThat is two different chords, it's a C Major (CEG) and a E minor (EGB), it will remain in harmony because of the two common tones (EG) and because the 5 of E minor is the 7 of C Major (Major 7th to be precise).\n\nAny more questions?

There are other solutions than overlapping windows, but it is the predominate (if \"legacy\") solution. \n\nThe problem here is not so much needing overlapping windows, as it is that Windows 8's Metro UX does not present in clear, visible, definitive terms what windows/apps/presentation layers are open and available to access without some mediary second step.  \n\nwith overlapping windows it takes a single mouse click to instantly transition between presentation layers, and what layers are where and how to get to them are clearly and visibly defined. Furthermore the user is free to organize them in any way they see fit. \n\nThe Metro UX does not allow this. And while this Windows 9 Concept(?) seems to address many current complaints (mainly the obfuscation of certain features/settings), it seems to miss its mark on the biggest complaint of all, and that's the one I've presented above. \n\nFull screen apps are nice in certain scenarios, but sometimes I want to be able to do side by side comparisons of 2 or more things (Something I do quite often).\n\nSo I guess it boils down to: \n\nA) I don't want Windows trying to force or limit the size, number, or position of my windows on screen.  \n\nB) I want a clear, visible, well defined way of arranging and navigating between windows/presentation layers/apps whatever. \n\nC) Don't try to force me into a paradigm that favors one input type (touch) over another(KB&amp;Mouse). Give me a choice to choose, or design an interface that works with both ( I realize that's easier said than done). \n\nEDIT: to address your specific call out of \"Why overlapping windows?\": I tend to use Tiling WM's in Linux and love them (&lt;3 Xmonad inside XFCE). However, while the \"default\" nature of these is to slot everything into a grid so nothing overlaps, I often float windows outside of the grid for reference purposes. The primary reason for doing this, either in a Tiling WM or on Windows/Traditional Desktops is that your screen is only so wide and sometimes you're referencing 2 or more things who's sum of widths is greater than your screen. Additionally, there's the navigational element of being able to easily view and bounce back and forth between windows. Normally we interact in an A and B manner. Even if there's A B C D E and F things that we're actively juggling. It's nice to be able to pull something to the fore, taking precedence over CDEF for the moment, reference/interact with B and A, then push it back and pull something else forward. You can achieve this by overlapping windows on \"traditional desktops\", or by floating something to the front with tiling managers, but not near so easily with the current paradigm in Windows8, and it's unclear how much thought, UX design and optimization has gone into it in this W9 concept.

{"body": "&gt; Why not use a more objective definition like this? (from wikipedia): \"The root of a chord (in French, basse fondamentale) is the note or pitch upon which a chord may be built by stacking thirds.\"\n\nBecause music is not actually objective.  The theoretical root is purely theoretical scaffolding.  It could be argued, for example, that the root of the D F B chord you mention is G, which is missing from the chord.  It certainly makes more *aural* sense than the B, which is the theoretical root of the Bdim chord, at least in context -- I could easily see a context where D is the root of the Dm6 chord missing its fifth.  And you could then say that it's no Dm6 chord but really a Bø7 in first inversion.\n\nThe root of the chord is the note to which the others relate (if such a note exists), and it is not a well-defined concept.  The dominant 11th chord voiced G C F A could be argued to be a G11, rooted on G, or an F/G, rooted on F; I'd argue that both apply, which is one of the reasons I find this chord interesting.  The theoretical root does not necessarily have the presence to be meaningful.\n\nWith regards to this \"triad\" you're talking about, the part I find objectionable is *raising the root*.  Raising the root does not *alter* a chord; it *changes* the chord entirely.  Lowering the third of a diminished chord makes a lot more sense than raising the root of a minor chord!\n\nBy the way, I understand that the augmented 6th chord is a product of our 12-tone equal temperament; if we were to use something else, the enharmonics would break the sound.  However, the chord wouldn't be used if not for its sound.  It's a melodic confluence (or a double diminished chord, if you like that formulation) that happens to have the same configuration, enharmonically speaking, as a pleasant and familiar dominant 7th chord.  It's the sound that brings the augmented 6th chord into our pantheon, not the double diminished explanation, and if it has a root, it ought to be the root of its sound.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378264980", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Because music is not actually objective\n\nI completely agree that music in *general* is not objective, but we can still strive to define musical *terms* as objectively as possible. For example, the phrase \"chromatically raise a given pitch one semitone in 12 tone equal temperament\" is quite objective.\n\n&gt;It could be argued, for example, that the root of the D F B chord you mention is G, which is missing from the chord. It certainly makes more aural sense than the B, which is the theoretical root of the Bdim chord, at least in context\n\nYes, some theorists consider a diminished triad a rootless Mm7 chord. For the rest of this post, I'll put parenthesis around a note to indicate that it's an absent from the chord.\n\nNow, whether one thinks of a Bdim chord as\n\n-B D F with \"B\" as the root, or\n\n-(G) B D F with the absent \"G\" as the root,\n\none powerful consistency remains. Both understandings agree with the *root* being the \"note or pitch upon which a chord may be built by stacking thirds.\"\n\n(In the \"B\" case, B is at the bottom of the third stack. In the absent \"G\" case, G is at the bottom of the third stack.)\n\n&gt;The dominant 11th chord voiced G C F A could be argued to be a G11, rooted on G, or an F/G, rooted on F; I'd argue that both apply\n\nI also agree here that both apply. One could argue again that both views agree with the stacked thirds definition of \"root\" presented. For the G11 presented (in stacked third order) we have G (B) (D) F A C. \nFor the F/G understanding, the G is arguably implied to be a non chord tone. So we have F A C with an added color tone, G, in the base.\n\n&gt;Raising the root does not alter a chord; it changes the chord entirely.\n\nThree times, I agree completely. Also, the author demonstrates that the double diminished triad is a drastically different entity than a minor triad. I think the author and you mean different things with the word \"alter.\"\n\n&gt;Lowering the third of a diminished chord makes a lot more sense than raising the root of a minor chord!\n\nI used the minor chord example to draw an analogy between the voice leading of  (major to dim) and (minor to double dim). Considering a more modern definition of \"altered chord,\" I agree that lowering the third of a diminished chord is probably a better way to think about the double diminished triad.\n\nIf you want a root view of the augmented 6th chords where the root is not altered, The French, German, and Italian 6th chords can be constructed as chords rooted on scale degree 2 (In stacked third order):\n\nFrench: 2 #4 b6 1\n\nItalian: (2) #4 b6 1\n\nGerman: (2) #4 b6 1 3\n\nNotice with this interpretation, the It+6 and Ger+6 are missing the root.\n\n(Similar to how we viewed The G missing from (G) B D F).\n\nAlso of interest is the triad 2 #4 b6, which consists of a major 3rd followed by dim 3rd. (The thirds are stacked in the opposite order of the double diminished triad.) This chord seems to be more commonly acknowledged than the double diminished triad. I've heard the names \"flat five triad,\" \"hard diminished triad,\" and \"major diminished triad\" used to describe it.\n\n&gt;The theoretical root does not necessarily have the presence to be meaningful.\n\nThe only meaning put into the word \"root\" is more or less a place to start stacking thirds.\n\n&gt;By the way, I understand that the augmented 6th chord is a product of our 12-tone equal temperament; if we were to use something else, the enharmonics would break the sound. However, the chord wouldn't be used if not for its sound. It's a melodic confluence (or a double diminished chord, if you like that formulation) that happens to have the same configuration, enharmonically speaking, as a pleasant and familiar dominant 7th chord. It's the sound that brings the augmented 6th chord into our pantheon, not the double diminished explanation, and if it has a root, it ought to be the root of its sound.\n\nThis is actually another reason why I'm hesitant to declare a root of an augmented sixth chord. As you stated, this enharmonicity with a Mm7 chord does not extend (necessarily) to other temperaments. For example, calling The Ab the root in Ab C F# makes little sense in meantone or in something like 19 tone equal temperament. Calling Ab the root seems narrow and inconsistent in a generalized sense.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378342753", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Gracias por responder. En verdad que aprecio y agradesco tu comentario.\n\nAl igual que tu, yo también soy parte de una familia envuelta en el magisterio. Pero no solamente eso, la mayor parte de mi vida, desde que te tengo uso de razón la he versado junto a profesores. Ya sea yo como alumno de ellos, o bien como amigo de ellos. Incluso hasta en el aspecto personal. Por que el tema de la educación en México, lejos de resultarme ajeno, me es uno de constante cercania diaría.\n\nTe pedía que mencionaras el punto donde se marcaba tu argumento de la reforma, por que es muy peligroso soltarse a hablar sin tener un respaldo que pueda sostener el debido peso de nuestros argumentos. Que lejos de ayudarnos a esclacerer el mensaje que deseamos hacer conocer, nos entorpece e impide lograr el objetivo final de comunicar nuestro mensaje. \n\nPuede que hayas leído el texto de la Reforma, puede que no. Tu respuesta me lleva a pensar que no lo has hecho, y que solo expresas tu opinión basado en lo que has escuchado por terceros, tal vez cercanos a ti.\n\nNo deseo malinterpretes mi postura, estoy de tu lado en algunos aspectos de tu argumento. Concuerdo con algunas (mínimas) ideas contigo. No estoy de acuerdo con la reforma educativa, por que lejos de ser una reforma sobre \"educación\" es en realidad una reforma administrativa-laboral sobre los que trabajan en el rubro educativo, pero no referente a la Educación. Esta postura la he venido expresando y comentando constantemente en este subreddit a lo largo de varias semanas en diferentes threads y posts con otros compañeros redditores. Ésta reforma ha sido un golpe para disminuir y eliminar el poder del magisterio como elemento de control sobre la eduación; ha sido un golpe directo al poder Sindical. Ambos Sindicato y Gobierno, marcan su postura en dos elementos que en verdad son ajenos a la educación: el dinero y el poder. Entre esos dos es que las esperanzas de los que en verdad importan en este rubro, es decir los alumnos, se juegan. \n\nSí. Si he estudiado el texto de la reforma. Tanto por el interés personal, pero también por el deber académico. Hace unas semanas les compartí el texto de un ensayo que escribí al respecto. Con ello sustento el peso de mi argumento. Y también, en humildad y honesta simpatía te lo hago presente:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14V37w5O5NpZ7z8SI2DcfXs4pEI7BLDw1b3tqVWEPbLc/pub\n\nComo veras en el esayo, si tienes el ánimo por leerlo; mi postura sobre tu argumento es más cercana de lo que podría parecer. A tal punto que meses antes de haber escrito dicho texto, escribí otro texto sobre la posible privatización de la educación:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1nZJeKJbdJRFrYW2k4WVc5S2-4g7CUgNBfoDuCZ34ZUM/pub\n\nTodo lo anterior te lo expreso, como valuarte significativo de que en cierta medida, me encuentro en conocimiento del tema. Y en ello te he de mencionar mis acuerdos y desacuerdos con la reforma educativa:\n\nACUERDO:\n- Que se evalue a los profesores. Pero no unicamente con un examen, sino del dentro del aula también. El conocimiento académico no es un sinónimo de capacidad docente.\n- Que se capacite más y mejor a los profesores. \n- Que se amplie el horario de clases. Pero que se mejore el programa en todos los sentidos en beneficio del alumno. \n\nDESACUERDO:\n- Que no se menciona el como ni el que de los procesos pedagógicos para la mejora de los intereses de los alumnos. En realidad en el ensayo que te comparto podrás ller más a detalle a que me refiero.\n\n&gt; O te diste cuenta cuando implementaron impuestos en la medicina publica y los alimentos?\n\nRespondiendo a tu pregunta. Sí. En realidad ambos aun se encuentran marcados a tasa cero. El ideal es que se disminuyeran otros impuestos y se agrandara la base contribuyente. Algo que el instituto mexicano de contadores públicos viene recomendando desde muchos años, pero que ningun partido político ha querido asumir el costo de dicha postura. Y sí, también conosco del tema. Mi grado académico de licenciatura lo obtuve como Contador Público.\n\nEs cierto, el sistema está dañado y es corrupto. Pero el decir que es necesario salir de nuestra burbuja es también un simple placebo para querer evitar la realidad. El verdadero problema no está en las instituciones de México. El problema se encuentra en el modelo económico. En aquel que impera la valia del dinero por encima de otro aspecto. En dónde el interes privado es mas grande que el interés público. Todo ello cierto es. Pero la pregunta importante es: ¿Qué estas haciendo tu para cambiarlo?\n\nEs muy desestresante, venir a contar nuestros problemas. Venir a insultar a X o Y motivo o persona. Para eso son estas plataformas. Pero lejos de todo ello. ¿Cuál es tu propuesta de cambio, para modificar aquello contra lo que no estás de acuerdo?\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378357702", "subreddit": "mexico", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

In some cases knowing the Greek alphabet helps:\n\n   B is V  \n   C is S    \n   H is N  \n   P is R  (like Greek rho)   \n   У is U  (like Greek upsilon)   \n   X is KH - the German/Scots/Yiddish \"ch\" sound (like Greek chi)   \n\nThese come from the Greek alphabet but don't particularly look like anything in ours:\n\n   Г is G (gamma)    \n   Д is D (delta)    \n   З is Z (zeta)   \n   Л is L (lambda)    \n   П is P (pi)     \n   Ф is F (phi)   \n \nAnd these are just weird, from our POV:\n\n   Б is B  (so that's where it went!)   \n   Ж is J, but it's pronounced French-style as \"zh\"   \n   И is I   \n   Ц is TS   \n   Ч is CH (as in \"church\")    \n   Ш is SH (looks kinda like Hebrew shin ש)   \n    Э is E    \n   Ы is Y (sort of)  \n\nIf you put a little tail on Ш, you get Щ, a letter that is usually transcribed \"SHCH\".  But it's not really SH + CH, and at the level of pronunciation accuracy you'll get from this list you can just ignore the tail and treat it as SH.\n\nSome of the vowels have a built-in Y in front of them:    \n\n   Я is YA    \n   E is YE (the native spelling of \"nyet\" is HET)   \n   Ë is YO    \n   Ю is YU        \n\nIn general, the lowercase letters are just a shrunken version of the uppercase; lowercase B is в and lowercase Б is б.  You'll see ь, which is not a lowercase version of either of those; for the purposes of this list you can consider it silent.   (And Ы is a single letter, not a combination of ь and I.  Modern Russian doesn't even have a letter that looks like I, though some other languages using Cyrillic do.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378424748", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

At that point I thought it was a local issue, so I quickly restarted my modem to see if that helped. After about 2 minutes the line stabilized and I was able to start CS:GO again and frantically tried to reconnect back to the match.

He confirmed it and told me that it happened only after he had added this \"superior\" guy and started a voice chat with him.

{"body": "&gt;Any advice on how to stop this chatter?\n\nYeah, cheat.  Are you open to unorthodox techniques?  \n\nSuicide?  High doses of psychedelic drugs?  Really good sex?  Blasting very loud music then turning it off suddenly?  Have a near death experience? Totally exhausting yourself with exercise?  Being tied up and beat with a cane until you can't cry any more?  Meet a guru or charismatic person who can do low level tricks that shock you into momentary silence?  \n\nBut, from a meditation perspective, to try and stop your thoughts is like trying to calm the water in a bathtub by splashing around in the tub.  It will never work.  Instead, give up completely, and the water will in and of itself become still.  Stop trying.  \n\nYou aren't there yet because the breath awareness meditation you are doing isn't designed for that.  It's designed to get you into a rhythm of listening to what your mind is doing, notice when it wanders, and detaching from the thing it wanders too.  You're practicing to let go (of whatever your mind wanders too) not to quiet your mind.  A subtle difference.\n\nThe endpoint of that practice isn't a quiet mind, it's the ability to concentrate deep enough (let go of enough distractions) to undertake other practices that require more sustained focus.  You're using a tool designed to get one result, and expecting a different result.  Kind of like a monkey pounding a screw with a hammer.\n\nHaving a quiet mind isn't about directing things at all, it's about being in a totally receptive state.  You have to be able to listen carefully enough to hear the silence.  And look at your post.  I I I I I I I I I I.  No wonder you can't quiet your mind, it's always going 'I I I I I I I I.'   Diminish that 'I' then there will be a space to listen into and hear that silence.  \n\nHere is one method.  It starts with a backwards step.  First, you realize that all the things you think are subjectively you are actually objects of your perception, and you're actually the subjective awareness these arise in.  Then you do it again, and that system of a subjective awareness and objects (like 'I') arising in the awareness is itself an object and you're actually the subjective awareness and it's turtles all the way down.  And when you grok it, there is silence there.  \n\nSo you say \"I am vasco.\" Then you realize Vasco is an object that arises and falls in your experience.  It can't be you, because you're looking at it. You aren't Vasco, you are the awareness where \"I am vasco\" rises and falls.  Then you look at that awareness.  And you realize, you aren't that, you are the awareness in which that rises and falls.  And so on, and so on.  And as you get further away from \"I am vasco\" the silence gets louder and you listen in a more refined way.  You need to already be adept at breath counting to do this.  Then instead of focus from your breathing to what you think you really are until you catch yourself as the subject that object arises in.  \n\n**You probably don't really want your mind to be totally silent because you don't know how to tell that apart from being dead yet.**  Maybe you're not ready for it and if it happened to you, it would appear like leaping into a terrifying void.

{"body": "What you're talking about is an okay way learn the notes of the modes at first. But it's actually *not* a good way to think about the modes musically, IMO. C Ionian and D Dorian have the same notes, sure. But the important difference between the two is which note is treated as *tonic*, or the sort of musical \"home base\".\n\nTake a simple motif like C D E F G E F D C - up the scale and down in thirds. If you play it over a Cmaj7 on a piano, everything will sound normal, settled, resolved. There won't be any tension. Now take it all up a step: D E F G A F G E D. These notes are all in C Ionian as well, but if you play that lick over Cmaj7, it *won't* sound settled. It'll sound unresolved, like there's some harmonic tension. Why? Because those notes aren't just random - that second little lick is establishing D as its \"tonic\" note in a couple different ways (starts and ends there, outlines a D minor scale, for example), and that clashes with the C major chord.\n\nThat's the core difference between C Ionian and D Dorian. I've heard various analogies with the concept of gravity, which I really like. When you're playing in C Ionian, it's not just the set of notes you use, but it's the idea that important notes (like C, E, and G) have a sort of \"tonal gravity\", either in the harmony behind what you're playing, in the way you construct, or (usually) a combination of both. That's how we can distinguish between playing in C Ionian and B Locrian. They have the same notes, but the \"gravity\" of the two scales is different.\n\nSo my point is that you should aim not to think of the modes as transformations of other scales, but as their own independent entities. When you're playing E Lydian, you're playing *E Lydian*, not B Ionian starting on E.\n\nThe best way to internalize the modes like this is to learn how they differ from the major or natural minor scale (I'm assuming you already know your major and minor scales, as that's where most people start). Except for Locrian, each mode is just one (or zero) alterations from a major or minor scale. Check it out:\n\nIonian: major scale.\n\nDorian: minor scale with a raised 6th scale degree.\n\nPhrygian: minor scale with a lowered 2.\n\nLydian: major scale with a raised 4.\n\nMixolydian: major scale with a lowered 7.\n\nAeolian: natural minor scale.\n\n[Locrian: minor scale with a lowered 2 and 5]\n\nThis way, you keep the strongest points of \"tonal gravity\" (generally the root and the fifth) intact when you're playing and soloing in modes. If you think about D dorian as \"D minor with a raised 6th\", then you're still *essentially* playing in D minor, with D and A as the most important notes, but with a raised 6 (so B instead of Bb) for extra color. If you think about it as \"C major starting on D\", then you'll probably fall into ways of playing the subconsciously emphasize the gravity points of *C* instead of D, since you're thinking \"C major\" in your head.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378581776", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Waccamaw 1 checking in.\n\nAfter some initial confusion as to which M113 belonged to which squad, compounded by the medics not being in the right M113s or the crews being in the right M113s, we loaded up and into the C130s for the far too short flight to LZ Chieftain.  For the record, I think it would've been cooler if we'd all jumped out after the M113 rather than in it, but that's just me.\n\nUpon landing we made our way into the town of Khushab and dismounted to set up security and create the Aid Station.  All that went off with only a few hitches (lots of people bouncing on and offline, not sure what was up with that).  We loaded up and moved out.  We ... v e r y ... s l o w l y ... c l i m b e d ... t h e ... m o u n t a i n.  Once we were over it, we started speeding down it.  After some short discussion, we decided to just raid the town with the APC.  This was not the \"best\" plan of action, though it did have the most humorous outcome as Rage wound up dead and on fire in the middle of the street.  Mission accomplished.\n\nWe took some sort of heavy fire on the way down the hill, injuring a large chunk of the squad whilst we sat in our lightly armored coffin and bailed out to find cover.  On the side of a hill.  The barren side of a hill.  I found a rock roughly the size of a football and hid behind it, directing my people as best I could.  It was not super effective.  I took several bullets and attempted to get back to our impromptu CCP set up by the medics, but passed out on the way.  Upon awakening, bleeding heavily, I bandaged myself on the side of this barren hill with bullets whizzing by, but for the first time in my Arma career, missing me.\n\nI made it to the big rock literally covered in friendlies (good thing those bads didn't have a 203 gunner worth his salt) and got patched up.  After the FTLs got fixed up and everybody was mobile-ish, I had the APC move a bit and we rushed to the edge of town to begin clearing it.  Mulladost did not last long at this point, swiftly being cleansed by the combined presence of Waccamaws 1 and 2.\n\nRemounting into the APCs we pushed to the next town on the list, Gospandi.  Apparently the bunker at Gospandi was occupied and received a bomb for it's trouble.  There were a few bad men in the town that also received hot lead for their trouble.  Don't think we killed any civilians, but who can say?  (Actually, I didn't notice a civilian body all night, so it's possible.)\n\nAs we were about to mount back up into our M113, we got a call from Aztec (JTAC) that a friendly air asset had been shot down and the pilot required pickup.  We had a good location for him so we backtracked about two klicks and picked him up, making absolutely sure that he sat in the awkward bitch seat between the two benches.\n\nONWARD TO NAGARA!\n\nWell, this time I decided we should be a bit more cautious.  We pulled off the road prior to entering the town and dismounted.  Our position wasn't great, but the hostilities weren't too threatening so I stretched us out by the APC and we advanced on the town.  There were calls of a ZU gun in the area that turned out to be a Zeus on the NE side of Nagara, but when we discovered a military painted Ural I instructed Brunius's (what's the possessive of a Brunius anyway?) AT specialist to hit it with a rocket.  It might've been a gun from where we were standing and when they called out the Zeus, I told my team to take out the truck anyway.  From the secondaries that came from it, I don't regret that decision one bit.\n\nAdvancing further into the town we took fire from a bunker to our East, so I detached a fireteam to go clear it.  That worked out well and eventually we cleared out the remainder of Nagara.  During the clearing operation I took a bit of sniper fire from VERY FAR AWAY.  It winged me and I never heard the shot.  I got patched up by the medic and while we shot the hell out of a couple of trees, I told my men to go on about their work without caring about the shots, just don't stand still if not in cover.\n\nONWARD TO NUR!!\n\nEverything went okay at first.  We dismounted in a decent area though under fire, it was not particularly heavy.  We were able to push back against most of it and my Bravo fireteam got away from me in the middle of it, ending up pinned by machine gun fire.  Needing them to get freed up so we could push NW, I directed to the M113 to on it's own, find the enemy machine gunner and see if it could be suppressed or killed.  About 2 minutes later, I heard the sounds of a dead and cooking M113, but prayed that was not the case.  I approached the husk, tried to get the men out of the area, was shot and killed.  From the spectator view, nobody got away real cleanly there, but I believe Zelly (Waccamaw 2) was able to try to get people straightened out whilst I bled out and then, later, returned ot the fight.\n\nIn the process of dying, my body seemed to have burned and my backpack radio and gear were unusable (another vote for spare 148s in the vehicles).  We wrapped things up with me basicaly telling my squad to follow Waccamaw 2 around and shoot anything bad since I didn't have comms with Command.\n\nOverall, quite an enjoyable mission.\n\nI welcome any critique from my squad or vehicle crew, commanders, or other squads.  The purpose of AARs is to improve always.\n\n**Things that went well:**\n\n* Most of the time, the fireteams seemed to be clear on what they were doing and didn't need me to micromanage them.\n* The APC travel was a fun thing, though I did spend most of it staring at maps.\n* I love having heavier support to call on.  The few times we maneuvered WITH the APC went pretty well.\n* It seemed that while we weren't talking to each other much, the squads managed to cover each other pretty well.\n\n**Things that I could've done better:**\n\n* I would've liked a bit more command direction.  I feel like a bit of this might've been an experiment from Rage to see what happened if he let us have an extra length of rope to hang ourselves.\n* Planning between squads could've gone better.  Deconfliction wasn't great, but we only had one FF so that's not bad.\n* I couldn't keep my own squad's callsign straight for half the damn mission.  Luckily, I could keep Brunius and Quex's names straight.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* M113s require direction.  Sending one off on it's own was my mistake, not that of the vehicle crew.  They were doing what I wanted them too, they just ended up eating it.\n* Urban combat requires planning.  Lots of planning.\n* You can't see dick in an M113.  It would probably have been a good idea to stop early, get out, and do a commander's recon of each town.  The idea was that this was going to be a fast mission that we took 3 hours on.  I don't think we'd be hurting if we took 5 minutes before each assault to figure out what we were running into face first.\n\n(Good thing we get 10000 characters for a post.

Basically, imagine all the letters on a string, sort of how a bed frame comes with those planks of wood strung together like a track. If you would to pull the string taught so all the letter spread out at the same time, that's called tracking (T R A C K I N G). But if you were to put space only between two letters at a time, then that's considered kerning (KER   NING). So let's say you started with a word (REDDIT), and increased the tracking (R E D D I T), then you can tweak the kerning (R--E-D---D-I---T). Sorry, I had to add dashes because adding extra spaces didn't show up in the comment formatting. The reason why there's tracking is so you're not manually adding space between each letter every single time. You can track out entire paragraphs at a time. With kerning, you can't.

Just keep slowing down your rate of spelling, so that you are thinking maybe 1 letter per 5 seconds.  You might start thinking thoughts between letters, if that happens just start spelling those thoughts instead.\n\nanother trick is to just count something.  the easiest thing to count is your breathing, just think \"one one one one one one one two two two two two two two\" so that you don't have any mental time to think anything else.  with practice you can just think \"one, two, three\" but it takes time.  you can also count a ticking clock in the room, count sheep, count your blessings, it doesn't really matter, it is just aiming to bore yourself to sleep really.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378687851", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; That is completely facetious and you know it. Sports games have always translated better onto console than they have on computer. Yes, the sports games on console won't have the same level of graphical detail, but the control of the players is a million times better. People are so stuck on their mouse/keyboard that they fail to realize that two joysticks actually give better control of character movement than wasd + mouse does, unless you are trying to play an FPS where I acknowledge that the pinpoint accuracy of a mouse is preferable.\n\nThe issue here is that a PC can scale down (i.e. utilize lower graphics engines, and controllers) better than a console can scale up. If you want to play a sports game, I fully agree, it is better on a console. I think racing games are the same. \n\nBut you can plug in your controller to a PC, and down/upgrade to that control mechanism because it fits better for the situation at hand... Even /r/pcmasterrace acknowledges that controllers are useful in the right context. The PC is about versatility. You can have a controller, an Oculus Rift, a gaming mouse, a game pad, and different hardware. This gives developers room to flourish in their design and make some really cool stuff. The problem is that when consoles are the standard, it creates a standard hardware, so that no matter how far PCs evolve, PC gaming exists as getting whatever minor improvements the developer can make on the standard console game. In other words, before the next gen of consoles were being made, game developers had to build their games to work on 6 year old hardware, and then try to upgrade it for PC, and more often than not, that failed. Going in hand with this, the Steam Box offers versatility of a PC (at least in the ideal sense) that takes away my problem with consoles. It gets past standardization, and allows actual growth, rather than games that are stunted to development on 6 year old hardware. \n\nFurther, your statement that two joysticks gives better control is just as unfounded, because it is dependent on the situation. I would gladly put a keyboard and mouse control of a player over dual joystick. You get greater pinpoint accuracy, greater reactivity to the degree of motion, and you can do plenty of stuff while doing it. Can you imagine trying to Quake Jump while shooting a moving target on a controller? First, you'd need to be strafing back and fourth for each jump, using one thumb. Then you'd need to be aiming, using your other thumb. Then you'd need to shoot, using your index finger. And then you'd need to actually jump using... Generally one of the A B X Y // Square Circle X Triangle, etc keys... Which you press with a thumb. So do you stop aiming to jump? Do you assign it to Left Shoulder 2 so you can jump every time you land? Then what about if you also are holding in a zoom to snipe a guy? Incrimentalism is the advantage a joystick gives (slight tilts, full tilts, etc), but at a huge cost of control.\n\nBut again, a controller can be used on a PC a lot easier than a mouse and keyboard is used on a console, so much so that now, PC games are not built necessarily on the norm of a keyboard/mouse, they are generally split. But console games are built on a norm of controller, meaning it doesn't scale up well. This has lead to terrible, terrible PC ports that by and large make up the gaming market.\n\n&gt;You get these characters in MMOs as well, the only difference is that you can't hear them because of voice chat not being as dominant in PC as it is Xbox Live. Have you ever played a PvP game on computer where you didn't have people berating each other through the chat interface? If you haven't, than you haven't PvP'd recently. Those kids are everywhere.\n\nI agree, PvP does this. These are PvP people. But PvP didn't define EverQuest. Sure, a few servers were big for it, and they did it in really cool ways, but EQ was hardly designed as a PvP game. Should we just throw caution to the wind and make EQN as toxic as League is? Lol. I really dont want a MMO made up of League of Legends rage fiends. I would like a game where people come together to play a game they love. Perhaps this goes beyond just these games, but this can easily be attributed to properties of PvP. People fucking rage hard when they are fighting other people, rather than fighting to overcome a collective challenge. I just don't want that to be what ends up defining EQN. There will be nothing that loses my money faster.\n\n&gt;You further go on to say that these kids aren't in MMOs when in fact, a lot of people in WoW (which is an MMo, and a flagship one, don't discredit it) Battlegrounds act this exact way. If there is no eminent threat on their life, they will gladly teabag you and taunt/ridicule you.\n\nDisproportionately found in consoles, not unfounded in MMOs. I was the GM of a raiding guild among the top of my server for about 2 years. Believe me, I know they exist, and WoW is one of the biggest attractors of it. My point is that consoles have them to a disproportionate degree relative to MMOs. And when you say \"If there is no eminent threat on their life...\", I don't think it requires a threat on their life, just consequence. That is why I wrote the \"Player Interdependence, The Oasis of Marr, and the Feeling of Wonder\" post here... Without some accountability, people act this way, and are raised this way by their games. People are not blank slates, and they enter games with memories of the past. I would argue that there are a greater number of people who do not act this way in PC games than there are on console games, most likely attributed to the vast majority of gamers on consoles that play just to fight and dick over other people, rather than to collectively raid or achieve big things (something you don't do in Halo/CoD/battlefield).\n\n&gt;Do you think that FFXIV will be ruined in the long run because of their console linkup?\n\nRuined, yes. Fail, probably not. My point isn't that this would make EQN fail, it is that it will make it an atmosphere that I don't think many people want, just tolerate. What I mean by this is that you can make a product that is tolerable, and reach a greater range of people who all think it is tolerable, than make a good game that is good to some, and not good to others. I think game developers view the first (everyone = tolerable) as attracting the most attention, and gathering the most money. I hope that SoE is wise enough to build the game that is good to their fan base, rather than build one that their fan base will tolerate, and we see the end of the possibility of a strong social atmosphere.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1378933086", "subreddit": "EQNext", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you are comfortable playing major and minor shapes in many keys at many places on the neck, I think the next step is to be aware of what chord degree each note you are playing is and how to change the chord fingering to change the chord type.\n\nTake for example the standard six string F bar chord we all learn. From low to high, F C F A C F. To make this a seventh chord, we just need to change one note. The easiest to start with is the doubled root on the fourth string. If we pitch that down one fret or a half step, we get a major seventh chord. From low to high, F C E A C F. We can go one fret or one half step further for a dominant seventh chord. From low to high, F C Eb A C F. \n\nWe can do the same operation of the F minor bar to create a Fmin(maj7) or the far more useful F minor 7. You can use the same sort of modification to get some very useful shapes with the Bb bar, from fifth string to first, Bb F Bb D F, or its parallel minor.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379108322", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Obviously not all drunk drivers got that way in bars, but it's a shit ton of them.

Never saw or herd anyone getting busted leaving that bar in 40 years.  Everyone knows here the alkys drink, and if they come out and get in a car, pop them.  That would actually do something.  Plus it old have the un intended consequence of making it attractive for drunks to drink at home.\n\nLet's face it, the bars put up this charade that they encourage drinking responsibly, how can they bitch about getting some help from local law enforcement.

{"body": "There is no straight answer - for a tune to be \"in key\" of say A the harmony of the tune usually ends on A chords - with a strong resolution from V7 (ie E7) to A. For such tune you can use A major scale all the way through. Well... depending on melody notes there may be some more exotic chords - but if all the chords you see are just diationic chords of A major scale: A, Bm, C#m, D, E, F#m or Amaj7, Bm7, C#m7, Dmaj7, E7, F#m7 and tune is \"in key of A\" ie it is not blues or modal tune then you can play A major scale all the way through. A bit boring but will work especially if you concentrate on outlining chords (ie avoid C# or G# over Bm7).   \n\nBut what if your progression is IV, I, V - eg. D A E D A E etc etc (Sweet Home Alabama-sh). This song does nor resolve to A. So while the chords used are from key of A you should not think about such song as being \"in key of A\". It is not in key of E either (since you have D chord and E scale has D#). So what scale do you play over it? A major scale starting on E fits the best: E F# G# A B C# D E   \nBasically it E scale with flatted 7th (D instead of D#) and it is called E Mixolydian scale. So such tune is not base on A major scale but rather on E mixolydian scale (or Mixolydian mode of E). Instead of being \"in key\" it is a \"modal\" tune.\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379118404", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's all about context and perception. As a Kassadin, as soon as I hit 6 , i check health bars and items. If their bot hasn't backed - I know they would have used 2 wards ( if they had 2 ) so their timers would be near up (around 6 mins ) I would check inventory and see what else they have / had and choose whether to go bot as a chance of a kill or pressure to get my adc some free farm at worst. I would be checking my damage vs. their mid too, if I know my Q W R will do 480 in a burst and with ignite an extra 190 then I will go for it when they are under 600 hp.\n\nWhen playing league of legends you have to look at the bigger picture and make a decision based on it. I know when I play brand vs. a kha'zix that if he jumps me at level7 with void spikes levelled and I have less than 620 hp - I will die before I can stun. So I play to that fact and keep strafing side to side whilst only last hitting and every time he goes in range to auto attack a creep I use my W then E. I know if he is less than 722 health when I am Level 7 - have 2 dorans rings and a boots - with ignite W E Q I can kill with the burn damage - if he has a pot I know I use ulti to engage it first ( with or without creeps as 180 damage is better than a kill being lost )\n\nYou need to start to theory craft and play through situations in your head. It is easier if you have played them similar before. I guarantee the next time you play a similar game and you are that far ahead in lane, if you choose to do what you did in this game, you will lose that one too. Always check tab for what they are building, look radar when not last hitting that melee mob.\n\nIf somebody bases and you are far ahead, push lane to tower and roam yourself, worst is you deny him those 7 creeps, best is you burn a flash on one of them or get your team a kill.\n\nTLDR: think about every situation and know how much you as a champ and player can do to start or stop something from happening", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379154311", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[Suna no onna (Woman in the Dunes)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058625/?ref_=sr_1) Directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara (1964)\n\nSynopsis: *Jumpei Niki, a Tokyo based entomologist and educator, is in a poor seaside village collecting specimens of sand insects. As it is late in the day and as he has missed the last bus back to the city, some of the local villagers suggest that he spend the night there, they offering to find him a place to stay.  He soon discovers he is actually trapped.*\n\nEasily one the scariest scenarios that I've seen from a movie.  The idea is pretty simple, what would you do if you suddenly had your freedom taken away?  How would you react, what would you try?  The reactions from Jumpei Niki were incredibly realistic, and some the actions taken lead for this movie to have some of the most tense scenes I've seen.\n\nThe camerawork on the movie is incredibly gorgeous.  The sand is largely featured, with good reason, and it's amazing the different beautiful shots of sand that they got.\n\nThe movie also contained a lot of great lines, the best being \"Do you shovel to survive, or survive to shovel?\" which sounds more like a workplace joke you were hear without the context.\n\nMy biggest complaint was that it felt really slow in parts, especially near the end, so keep that in mind if you decide to watch it.  That was the only thing that brought down the movie for me though. 8/10\n\n_________________________________________________________\nAfter watching *Satantango* I decided to go on a short movie marathon, and inadvertently stumbled upon *Wavelength* which lead me structural films.  Copied from wikipedia: *[The artists] moved away from the complex and condensed forms of cinema practiced by such artists as Sidney Peterson and Stan Brakhage. \"Structural film\" artists pursued instead a more simplified, sometimes even predetermined art. The shape of the film was crucial, the content peripheral.*  Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Tony Conrad, Paul Sharits, and Owen Land were some of the artists who made key movies in this movement.  I made a thread a while back asking about minimalism in film, and these seem to be exactly what I was looking for.\n\n[Wavelength](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127354/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3) Directed by Michael Snow (1967)\n\nWatching this was a revelation.  Admittedly, I don't know a whole lot about avant-garde or experimental film, but I do have more experience than an average person.  Before this, most of the experimental stuff I'd seen dealt with surrealism, but this was so radically different.\n\nThere is a \"plot\" for this film, but it's not the focus at all.  It was all about how the room was presented.  I think different color filters were used, and a lot of it really changes how the room looks, and some quick changes back to the \"natural\" view are really jarring.  The other thing done focusing with the zoom.  It happens initially in such small increments, I wasn't even positive that it was happening.\n\nThe other key part is the sound.  The sound is horrifying, haunting.  Combined with the picture, it feels like it's what bad trips are made out of.  I was amazed, hypnotized, shocked.  It was nothing I was prepared for, especially after reading what effect happened in the film.\n\nIf you are considering checking it out, be warned, it's a really polarizing movie.  People may call me \"pretentious\" for even recommending it, but I only know what I felt and what I experienced.  I don't just go throwing around 10s, but this movie easily earned it from me. 10/10\n\n[Zorn's Lemma](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131149/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) Directed by Hollis Frampton (1970)\n\nAnother simple concept that sounds like it may be boring, but that I was entranced with.  Named after a lemma from set theory, my undergrad math degree unfortunately didn't run through enough set theory to completely make sense of the lemma or how it did relate to the film.\n\nThe majority of the movie is just viewing a sequence of words on street signs that run through a shortened alphabet.  Only either a word with i or a word with j were shown and the same with u and v.  So one example run would be a b c d e f h j k l m n o p q r s t v w x y z and another may be a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q r s t u w x y z.  The amount of times I said this alphabet in my head is incredibly large, I just did it almost automatically in the hour the film ran.\n\nThe change that happens is that certain letters eventually get replaced by another image.  I was largely entertained by trying to come up with a pattern for when it would happen, and once I found a pattern that worked for a while, it would suddenly not work.  The amount of excitement when I thought a letter had been changed, and then waiting to see if I was right is a little absurd.\n\nThe alphabet series was bookended by two speeches that I'm afraid I didn't completely understand what Frampton was trying to say with them.  Still, I was never bored in the hour, and recommend the film. 8/10\n\n[The Flicker](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059182/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) Directed by Tony Conrad (1965)\n\nThe movie consists almost entirely of the screen switching back and forth between white and black frames.  WARNING: if you have epilepsy, do not watch this.  The speed at which the frames switch back and forth changes throughout the film, and it creates a strobe like effect at certain speeds.  It is kind of cool the different visuals I got depending on the speed of the flicker and how it could change my perception.\n\nUnfortunately, having to watch this on a computer was really detrimental to the experience.  If I had been in a theater watching, the mix of large visuals and amplified sound would have been much more effective.  This was also the only one of the three structural films I felt bored during, even though it was by far the shortest.  I still don't regret checking it out, and if it were to play in a theater near me, I should certainly check it out again. 6/10\n\n[T,O,U,C,H,I,N,G](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189133/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) Directed by Paul Sharits (1969)\n\nThis one was very short compared to the others I watched, only clocking in at 12 minutes.  What I really liked about it was the sound rather than the visuals.  The sounds consisted entirely of someone saying destroy.  Eventually, though either just the repetition or through some other sort of manipulation, destroy lost it's meaning.  It became different words, different sounds, and only every once in a while could you hear the original destroy again.\n\nThe visuals weren't anything bad, just not as impressive as I'd found some of the other things.  It was either a clip of a man getting his face scratched or the same man about to cut his tongue.  Only little bits of each clip were presented at a time, during one of the sections which were labeled T O U ... etc.  Near the end a good amount of either clip could be seen since a new image would be shown and the clip would be run back.  While that happened, the colors of the clips were constantly changing.  Overall, kind of interesting, but none of these other videos have come close to what I saw in *Wavelength*.  7/10\n\n[Remedial Reading Comprehension](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478015/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) Directed by Owen Land (1971)\n\nBy far the strangest thing I saw when going through these structural films.  I'm actually kind of at a loss for exactly why it's included in the movement, it's pretty wildly different from anything else I watched.  It opens with a woman dreaming about class, moves to comparisons of rice, then to some people running, and also has some text from a speed reading manual which is impossible to read.  All of this and the words \"This Is A Film About You... Not Its Maker.\" were repeated onscreen quite a few times.\n\nThis was the one I just didn't get at all.  Reading the wiki page on the short helps to sort of put it all together, but even still, just something I couldn't connect with at all.\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n[Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130976/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) Directed by Bruce Conner (1967)\n\nThis was one of the shortest movies on the 1001 Movies list, it only comes in at 13 minutes.  The focus is the Kennedy assassination.  Initially, the way the film repeats certain events over and over again, and how flickering screens are used in a good portion of it, I thought it was supposed to recreate the feeling of that day and the event, like someone going back over the events again and again.  There was some bull fighting imagery that really didn't fit with that reading though.\n\nConner's intent was a commentary on media coverage of events like this.  Everything replayed over and over again, almost to death, and I think he was trying to say it ends up being more like people watching a bull fight.  After reading the intent, the short made a lot more sense, but I personally don't really see this as essential viewing. 6/10\n\ncontinued...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379266675", "subreddit": "TrueFilm", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As I said - your teacher is very likely capable to teach you using different approaches. Usually first goal of a teacher is to give student some approach to quickly allow them to to play something. Then later go back and fill out the gaps. That is normal way of teaching. First scout the terrain then survey it. So I honestly do not think your teacher is taking you for a ride. \n\nI had the hardest time understanding modes because they are usually taught as a major scale started on different steps.  \nC Ionian: C D E F G A B C  \nD Dorian : D E F G A B C D  \nE Phrygian : E F G A B C D E  \nF Lydian: F G A B C D E F  \nG Mixolydian : G A B C D E F G  \nA Aeolian : A B C D E F G A. \nB Locrian : B C D E F G A B  \n\nSo I always thought - what is the big deal - it is all C scale. Well that is because that is not how you use them. \n\nFirst lets note that 4 modes that have minor character are  Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian and Locrian. It is because 3rd step is minor 3rd above the root. \n\nDorian: R 2 b3 4 5 6 b7  \nAeolian: R 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7  \nPhrygian: R b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7  \nLocrian: R b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7  \n\nAnd letsay you play over progression that has Dm7 in it. Natural scale to use is D Dorian - after all Dm7 was built using that scale: D F A C.  But what if melody (or preceding chord) has Bb note - then playing B as in Dorian scale would clash.  In such case you look for minor mode of D that ha flatted 6th (ie Bb). And first one is D Aeolian. Then going further - if melody (or preceding chord) has flatted 2nd you play D Phrygian.  \n\nYou cannot however play D Locrian over Dm7 since Locrian scale has b5. And Dm7 has natural 5th. But if your chord is Dm7b5 then D Locrian is exactly the scale you would use to outline it. \n\nI realize it may be jumping ahead a bit but just wanted to show you why modes are important.

Wrong.\nPuck needs levels, you're able to safelane puck, but hardlaning is more or less just a waste of hero potentinal if you ask me.\nI will just go through the midlane steps for you.\n\n* **Who are you facing?** Always think of what is best for you to max out, say a QoP I tend to go Q E Q W W R W W, mainly I want to max the silence as QoP is all about spell casting even though she has some attack damage. She also has missile speed over you. This is why I tend to get 2 levels in orb, just to get some farm.\n\n* **Play it smart.** 1:55, at this point all or most creeps should die by your orb, so that you in turn push out the lane to get the bottle. If you're behind, honestly, don't bother going for rune. Let the other guy do it and take advantage of the fact that you now have the lane for yourself for atleast 15 seconds.\n\n* **ALWAYS phase shift.** Every damage you can avoid, avoid it. Even if it is just an autoattack dodge it. If you're facing someone with a dot, just like QoP, she will snap up that you're doing this and try to attack then dot. If she gains on you, either you dodge and fog, or you just take that auto attack like a man and then dodge the shadow strike.\n\n* **Runes.**\n* Did you get a DD, Haste or Invis? Try to gank. This is something you have learn - Can you kill someone with what spells your currently have off cooldown? Y/N? N. \n* Is that lane in particular getting fucked up? Y/N? Y. \n* Would your harrasement get him off the lane for a while? Y/N? Y. \nGo a head and do it and tp back to your lane, don't touch his creeps while ganking, unless you need them badly. This is something most PUBgankers do, they gank for a reason. The lane needs it because they need farm. And then the ganker comes and takes it.\n\n* **Item builds.**\nI tend to go for Boots -&gt; bottle -&gt; dagger -&gt; magicwand -&gt; pt -&gt; Hex / euls. If I go euls instead of hex, I get a hex afterwards. This is mainly if someone on their team has silence as a spell, or is building orchid. Orchid is the cryptonite of Puck, euls removes that and you can blink away as soon as it is done. If you're getting outfarmed, get the PT before blink. Hell, get the magic wand straight after.\n\n**SKILL THE ULTI AT 6,11,16** And just as an FYI 140 games is no where near you being able to play that hero good nor to perfection. So don't get upset if shit doesn't workout, it takes time.\nKeep in mind that ALL item aswell as skill builds changes depending on the situation of the game, I can only tell you so much, the reas is basically up to you to feel what items and what skills you need.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379336002", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

Start was recall, and the left analog was my mouse and I had the right analog for my pings. It was hard at first but then I made the sensitivity of the analog really really high. It made it so in which ever direction I pointed the analog it would almost automatically take it to the edge of the screen.

{"body": "They work because, in the example you gave, the chords are all diatonic to a scale.  Take the key of C major.  You have the notes **C D E F G A B**.\n\nNow look at the chords in C major:\n\nC Major\n\nD Minor\n\nE Minor\n\nF Major\n\nG Major\n\nA Minor\n\nB Diminished\n\nThe notes of every single one of those chords are made up of notes within the C major scale.  You take the root note of the chord, skip the next note, use the next note, skip the next note, and use the next note.  For example:\n\nD Minor contains the notes D F A\n\nC **D** E **F** G **A** B\n\nA Minor contains the notes A C E\n\n**C** D **E** F G **A** B\n\nB Dimished contains the notes B D F\n\nC **D** E **F** G A **B**\n\nAnd all of those notes are available to you within each chord.  You can add a G note to an A minor chord and now you have Am7.  Or add a C and E note to a D minor chord and you have Dm9.  \n\nIt all works because it's diatonic (read, in the key).\n\nOf course, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  A lot of music doesn't stay diatonic.  There are things like secondary dominants, borrowed chords, and tritone substitutions that spice up chord progressions.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379359691", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Take C scale and construct all the diatonic 4 note chords taking every other note of the scale: C D E F G A B C;  \nCmaj7:  C E G B  \nDm7:     D F A C  \nEm7:      E G B D  \nFmaj7;   F A C E  \nG7:         G B D F  \nAm7:       A C E G  \nBm7b5:   B D F A  \n\nThen record backups on Ditto using those chords only. And play C scales but try to play notes related to root of the chord. For example if you record Em7 Dm7 vamp then try to play E F G A B C D E over Em7 (E Phrygian scale) and D E F G A B C D over Dm7 (D Dorian scale). That will quickly teach you modes of C scale. Then repeat it in any other scale.\n\nJust for a completeness lets add mode nomenclature:\n\n C Ionian: C D E F G A B C  \nD Dorian : D E F G A B C D  \nE Phrygian : E F G A B C D E  \nF Lydian: F G A B C D E F  \nG Mixolydian : G A B C D E F G  \nA Aeolian : A B C D E F G A. \nB Locrian : B C D E F G A B  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379392221", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As someone else suggested in another thread, perhaps a way to start is to simply write out the alphabet, caps and lowercase. Then, look at your letters one by one. Do you like it? What could be better about it? Then, draw that letter, slowly working out how to make it the way you like and repeating it over and over until you can write it exactly the way you like. And once you get there, keep practicing it. Once you've got it, master the next letter. Then, write them both side by side so you can keep the practice on your previous letters. \n\nI only just started to improve my handwriting, and just started the exercise I said above last night, but I can tell you while I didn't knock it out all in one three hour session, I can honestly say that my lowercase a, b, and c's look a LOT better than before I started, and added bonus, it appears that I'm beginning to get the hang of spacing a little bit better. I'm going to slowly keep building this up, and eventually I'll have my own style down in the way I want.\n\nInteresting point though, take your time, and deliberately S L O W down. Way down. And conciously focus on making the strokes, where each on starts, how long it is, where second stroke starts in relation to the first one, how much it curves out, etc. After a while, you break through the fog of just scratching it out, and are much more in tune with what you are writing.

{"body": "Video compression usually works by dividing video frames into two types:\n\n* I frames - Contains the entire frame, much like a complete photograph. These frames are large in size (i.e. 1980x1080x24 bits).\n* P frames - Contains only changes to the previous frame. These frames are variably sized.\n\nSo, a compressed video viewed as a stream of frames would look something like this:\n\nI P P P P P I P P P P P I P P P P P I P ...\n\nWhen you play back a video, sometimes frames are \"dropped\". This means that for whatever reason (be it network latency, network reliability issues, hard drive latency, etc) one of the video frames isn't decoded in time for display. P frames *build on one another*, however. That is, if you miss one P frame the next P frame's changes are invalid. There will be distortion until an I frame appears and can \"refresh\" the entire screen.\n\nWhen a video is extremely compressed, the encoder inserts I frames less often, as they are much larger than P frames. This is much riskier, however, as a dropped P frame is much more noticeable since it will take possibly several seconds for an I frame to come around.\n\nFrames are dropped more or less randomly based on your hardware and other factors, so distortion could change every single time. Note, however, that sometimes an encode is simply bad or corrupted, in which case the same frames will be dropped every single time.

{"body": "Not *exactly* going to answer your question, but I think you'll get the gist. A key is a \"relative minor\" of a major key when it contains the same notes as the major key but starting on the 6th.\n\nSo that means the key of G major has a relative minor of E minor. E is the 6th note of the G scale... G A B C D E F# G. As you've discovered, the key of D minor is the relative of F major. F G A Bb C D E F.\n\nIn scale terms, from the major scale, the intervals are Whole Whole Half Whole Whole Whole Half. G to A is a whole step, or 2 frets. A to B is 2 frets, B to C is a half step... only one fret, etc.\n\nTo answer your question after all, E is the perfect 5th from A. A C E is the A minor chord. Let's ignore the intervals for a second and look at your Dm scale. We just said it's the same notes as the F major scale, but starting off the 6th. So the notes you know are OK to use are D E F G A Bb C D. You can build a Dm triad D F A; an E diminished triad E G Bb; an F major triad F A C; a Gm triad G Bb D; an Am triad A C E; a Bb major triad Bb D F; and a C major triad C E G. Each just skips a note in the scale to the next major or minor third.\n\n\n(I could REALLY confuse you by telling you that the dominant 5th, or in this case A major (A C# E) is often used in a minor key, even though C# is not normally part of the scale. V chords are special in how they lead back to I (or since we're in Dm, i)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379460982", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I shit you not, we never even touched material in the class room that effected our grade. Asking for help always led to mixed answers or a response that left me (and my group) in the same place we started. Never ever take this class! You WILL regret it. My calculus teacher (and please don't take this the wrong way) spoke terrible English and wrote in a way that was hard to read or figure out. He spoke no better during his office hours. I politely expressed some of my concerns to him, he told me to drop the class. In the class I'm in now (ill leave the name out), the professor likes to talk, and talk, and talk, and t a l k about random things using these unnecessary complex words before making it to the actual material where we have about 15 minutes (not exaggerating here) of the 74 we have in the class. As a result, the material that I really really need to see is solved on the board AFTER CLASS which means I personally done get the notes I need. He makes it so obvious that he's just waiting time, yet the class seems to be on his side. How do I address this? I can't talk to him personally about it. \"Hey, you should stop blabbing and get to the material man, I feel you're waisting our time.\" I couldn't go on and on like he does if my life depended on it.

DAVID PETRAEUS\n\nContact: Portia Seddon, 347-740-8834 or Tafadar Sourov, 646-331-1266\n\nAd Hoc Committee Against the Militarization of CUNY adhoccunycommittee@gmail.com\n\nNEW YORK, 17 September -- Six students were arrested this evening in a brutal, unprovoked police attack on a peaceful protest by City University of New York students and faculty against CUNY's appointment of former CIA chief ex-General David Petraeus. Students were punched, slammed against vehicles and against the pavement by police captains and officers, after the NYPD forced them off the pavement and into the street. The demonstration was called by the Ad Hoc Committee Against the Militarization of CUNY.\n\nThe arrested students are presently being held and are to be arraigned this Wednesday, September 18, at some point between 9:00 a.m. and the afternoon at the Arraignment Court in the Manhattan Criminal Court at 100 Centre Street. All defenders of students' basic right to protest are urged to come to the arraignment and show their support.\n\n\"As students were chanting 'War Criminal Petraeus Out of CUNY Now,' I was shocked to see several police officers grab and brutalize one of the demonstrators,\" said City College student Yexenia Vanegas. \"This was completely unprovoked, as demonstrators made clear that they were there to defend our university in a peaceful protest.\" The attack occurred in front of CUNY's Macaulay Honors College, where Petraeus has been appointed to teach a class on public policy.\n\n\"Protesters were marching in a circle on the sidewalk and chanting, but the police forced them into the street and then charged. One of the most brutal things I saw was that five police officers slammed a Queens College student face down to the pavement across the street from Macaulay, put their knees on his back, and he was then repeatedly kneed in the back,\" said Hunter student Michael Brian. The student was one of those pointed out by \"white shirt\" officers, then seized and brutalized. A Latina woman student was heaved through the air and slammed to the ground.\n\nA broad range of CUNY students, faculty and staff members have been carrying out a campaign of \"protest and exposure\" against the Board of Trustees' appointment of Petraeus, whose documented actions as Iraq/Afghanistan war commander and CIA chief include drone attacks upon civilians, and the creation of torture centers and death squads. When Petraeus was setting up special police commandos, the \"dirty tactics\" that were used included the use of white phosphorus, a chemical weapon, against the population in Fallujah. \"Petraeus' man\" Col. James Steele, who organized death squads in Central America, had been brought to the area to organize death squads there.\n\nWith the NYPD being sent to brutalize and arrest CUNY students on behalf of a certified war criminal, organizers state that this blatant use of police brutality against peaceful protesters will not intimidate or deter those who expose the truth about the actions of David \"Death Squad\" Petraeus and oppose attempts to turn the City University into \"a war college.\"\n\n    end -\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379553996", "subreddit": "Anarchism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For cancelling your speed, use your main engines.\n\nRCS is for when you're real close (50-100 m) and going real slow relative to your target (under 2-3 m/s).\n\nOnce you've set yourself up on an intercept approach, your process is going to be:\n\n1. Turn towards the [target retrograde relative velocity marker](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Navball#Target_prograde_and_target_retrograde) (green with a cross inside it).\n2. Wait till you're at closest point.  Look at the intercept in map view to find the closest distance.  If your intercept says 1.4 km, wait till you're 1.4 km away.\n3. Burn your engines till relative velocity is zero (or as close as you can get.. anything under 1 m/s is fine, really).  Use low throttle to fine-tune it - burn at 100% thrust at first, then 50%, then 20%, then just barely thrust at the end.  (Shift = more thrust, Ctrl = less thrust, X = cancel all thrust)\n4. Point at the target prograde marker again (pink circle).  Burn until you're heading towards the target at 1% of your distance.  Example: if you're 1.4 km away (1400 m), then head towards your target at at 14 m/s.  If you're 300 m away, head towards your target at 3 m/s.\n5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until you're real close (50 or 100 m)\n\nOnce you're close, use RCS to get yourself on the correct side of the other ship (or just point ship A at ship B, and then switch to ship B and point it at ship A).  Make sure you're controlling both ships from the docking port (right-click on docking port, click \"control from here\").\n\nThen move in towards the docking port.  Pay close attention to your relative velocity prograde marker (green with no cross) - you want it on top of your target prograde market (green marker on top of the pink circle).  Use the I J K L keys to thrust sideways and make the markers line up.  H and N keys to go forward or backwards with RCS.\n\nYou should dock at under 0.4 m/s.  Make sure SAS is off.\n\n  Various mods such as [Docking Port Alignment Indicator ](http://kerbalspaceport.com/dock-align-indicator/) can help you with the actual docking part.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379583532", "subreddit": "KerbalAcademy", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry, but as a Talon main, this is horrible advice. R'ing first is strictly for getting kills which are near death and exrtemely out of reach. I R to pick up kills maybe once in 50 games. R'ing first results in zero passive application and zero e application to your largest source of damage. The ideal combo is e q w r q(if still alive). Some here may see this and say \"But shouldn't you q after w to get bonus q damage due to passive?\" No, with the way Talon's e and q work , you tend to automatically proc q on targets which you e to. If i remember correctly Riot QoL buffed him in this way because you used to have to click on your target/attack move after e'ing to Q them, and i believe this is why sometimes if you e to something without Q activated, you won't auto. Maybe i just dont notice the auto. I can't remember. Anyway it feels awkward to me to e, w, q, on talon. Feels much cleaner to just q e w.\n\nBecause there are so few Talon players, I'll share an obvious but helpful tip in this thread as a side note. Use your E to win very passive lanes you dominate, or escape ganks and juke. Suppose you're against a karthus, a lane you should win. He's playing hyper safe because you just got your brutalizer. e to creeps when he goes for a cs and w him, keep going to try to land a auto + q then walk away. He should be killable once your e comes up from cd with ignite and r.\n\nSuppose a jungler is coming to gank you from the baron side of river, and you're over extended in mid. You can only run into the long brush leading to dragon. Enter the brush, and e onto the enemy jungler once he's nearest to your mid tower. Easy standard talon juke that can be performed in any brush on the map. Simply go into a brush which faces opposite the direction you wish to run to, and e to the enemy once you're in range. Some very basic tips which should help any bronze/silver talons here for sure.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379626099", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Song may modulate from key to between verses. Also more complex song may have several tonal centers within a verse and scales in one key will not fit it.   \nBut lets assume song is in one key. The way I approach it is I start playing along and pick few notes from melody - lets assume it is not blues since those are simple - all you have to do is locate I to IV transition and try couple chords. Or check turnaround part. \n\nLets look at scales:  \nC D E F G A B C  \nG A B C D E F# G  \nD E F# G A B C# D    \nA B C# D E F# G# A    \nE F# G# A B C# D# E  \nB C# D# E F# G# A# B  \nF# G# A# B C# D# F F#  \nC# D# F F# G# A# C C#  \n\nF G A Bb C D E F  \nBb C D Eb F G A B  \nEb F G Ab Bb C D Eb  \nAb Bb C Db Eb F G Ab  \netc.   \n\nSo say song has F note in melody (just so our example is simple). Your knowledge of scales tells you that after C going into \"# scales\" all scales have F# until C# scale. So it can be C or C# or one of  \"b scales\". So check if it has natural B in melody - if it does then only choice is C.  If it has Bb then it can be F,  Bb, Eb, Ab etc. so you check - does it have Eb note if no then only possibility is F scale.  \n\nNow I know it looks horribly complex. But actual process is simple. Locate F in melody  - play along couple scales that have F in them and check if some of the notes fit - ever note you locate  in melody narrows down choice of scales - after about 3  or 4 notes you know the key. And you really do not have to do any thinking - as long as you know your scales - after a while it is pretty much automatic.

{"body": "\"Fear &amp; Shenanigans\" That's what gets me a little tense. All this conspiracy bullshit really just ends up with me coming up with *my own* theories.\n\nIt's extremely scary if you think about it all. I always look at these sites and just picture them as those well dressed men fishing for \"freshly hired\" meat at a minimum wage joint, asking them to hop onto their bullshit pyramid schemes. Most kids bite, I almost did. Those sharks, after having your eyes opened to them, become easily visible. They feed you with as much golden sprinkled shit as they can, reel you in, and keep you stuck. \n\nOnce you get someone interested and hooked onto one story, they get hooked, and try to look for other stories about/related to what they previously read- then are fed an entirely new theory of how \"the moon is hollow, and is a spaceship filled with lizards, using Beyonce to control your temper!\" type of bullshit. \n\nWhich brings us back to fear and shenanigans. It makes it too difficult for anyone to truly decipher what's out there (at least it does for me). It's gotten to the point, as I stated earlier, to where you just question E V E R Y T H I N G. It gets you paranoid, it has you thinking about your circumstances, how little or how big your debt is, why you have debt, should you go to college, and all of the things that we usually worry about, but with an accentuated anxiety. \n\n*sigh* I really don't even know to where I'm getting at anymore. I don't know if it's these conspiracy theorists coming up with bullshit to feed the hype for easy blog hits, if these guys (if you can find them) are telling you the truth, or if it truly is something *bigger* that's using conspiracy  theories (that obviously aren't true) as distractions for their own ulterior motives. If a dog's chasing you - throw whatever you got at it, and hope it'll slow down or bite the shit out of what you just threw. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1379669274", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Fmaj is created from notes that are contained within C Major Scale.  Fmaj is made with F-A-C.  G7 is created with G-B-D-F.  Notice all these notes I mention are in the C Major scale!\n\n&gt;In addition, I'm assuming that if you want to start on a C Major chord, the note has to be C, E or G right? And for F Major the same would be F, A and C?\n\nIf you play C-E-G, all at once, no matter what order, it is a Cmaj chord, it just can become an \"inversion\" depending on the ordering.  The root inversion has the root, C, as the lowest note rung sequentially first, then E and G.  First inversion has the E, then G, and C.  Second inversion has G, C, E.  I wouldn't really worry about this, at this point in time.\n\n*C D E F G A B (C)\n\nTo make a chord progression using the major scale you can use the formula...\n\n*Major Minor Minor Major Major(dom7) Minor Diminished.\n\nSo for key of C as listed above you would have\n\nCmaj Dmin Emin Fmaj G7(or just Gmaj works) Am.

{"body": "That's actually a very common and versatile voicing, although it tends not to be in that inversion, because that's a pretty crunchy sound. Usually whenever you see it it's one inversion up from that, so in this case b2 4 5 1. In that inversion, it's a maj7(b5) chord. The next inversion is also very crunchy and not too common (4 5 1 b2), but the last one is also fairly common (5 1 b2 4).\n\nHowever, I wouldn't really say without reservation that you should play that for a iii chord, just because the sound of that b2 is so striking. One way I tend to see this notated on lead sheets is X7sus(b9). If the iii chord came up in a more harmonically conventional chart, like it does in [Peri's Scope](http://www.guitarcats.com/images/JazzStandardCharts/PERI'S%20SCOPE-347.jpg), I would avoid the 9 altogether, and if I played one at all, I'd just raise it. That's a lot more palatable to my ear than a b9 in this kind of context.\n\nAnd leaving iii chords behind, you can put those maj7(b5) over other roots as well to imply different chords. Probably the most common use is for a 7 chord, to use the one built off the 7th. So, say we're looking at voicing a Bb7 chord. Assuming you use a bassist playing the Bb, a pianist or guitarist could play Abmaj7(b5), and the resulting notes are Ab (7th) C (9th) D (3rd) G (13th). The two crucial tones for a 7th chord voicing are there (3rd and 7th) plus the two most standard color tones (9th and 13th), so it's a very efficient voicing. The voice-leading works well in ii-V-I's, as well. Say we're voicing Cm7-F7-Bbmaj7. If you start on Eb G Bb D for the Cm7, then all you have to do is move the Bb down a half step to A and you have our maj7(b5) voicing for F7, Eb G A D. From there, you can go down to D F A C or D G A C for Bbmaj7, or if it resolves to Bb7, then you can go down by step to D G Ab C. Incidentally, that's where the other inversion that I talked about in my first paragraph shows up. If the bass is moving in the circle of fifths in dominant 7th chords, then you can just move down by step and you'll be alternating between the two common voicings I talked about as long as you start on one of them.\n\nYou can use the maj7(b5) voicing for some other chords as well. Let's stick with Fmaj7(b5) for consistency. Here's some of the more common/useful ones (excluding more out stuff like Fmaj7(b5)/Db).\n\nFmaj7(b5) / D = Dm7 (Dorian)\n\nFmaj7(b5) / E = E7sus(b9) (Phrygian)\n\nFmaj7(b5) / F = Fmaj7(b5/#11) (Lydian)\n\nFmaj7(b5) / G = G7 (Mixolydian)\n\nFmaj7(b5) / A = Am7 (Aeolian!)\n\nFmaj7(b5) / B = Bm7b5 (Locrian if you really want, probably more common to use the 6th melodic minor mode)\n\nLet me know if anything in there was unclear!

{"body": "Like memarianomusic says, it depends a bit on the broader context. However, here's an example of a song that's almost exclusively built on that harmonic motion: [Thom Yorke - The Eraser](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1oge5nHQk). Some other harmonies get added after 1:20 or so, but mostly it's going back and forth between what I would call C6 and D6 - it's C G A E and D A B F# (you could make a case that they're inverted Am7 and Bm7 chords, but I would disagree). In this case, I hear the C as more of a tonic chord than D (but not by much), so I guess you could say that it's in C Lydian.\n\nBasically, the way you hear the progression will depend on the rest of the piece. If you establish F major elsewhere and in other ways, then you'll hear it more as bVII-I in F major.

{"body": "What you do as riven is go aggro early before he gets his Q, make him scared. After he gets his Q it's often beneficial to make him use it ( 20seconds ~~ of him not able to escape you ) since it makes him use up to 10% of his current health ( A LOT in the early lane phase ). Riven wins any trade assuming she doesnt have anything on cooldown when aatrox chooses to engage her.\n\nAatrox's sustain is insane cause of his W so you should avoid pushing him up to the tower that pretty much means free sustain ( off of melee minions, you shouldn't give him ranged minions for free ).\n\nGood strategy might be to start a red pot and carefully dive him early levels to just pop his passive then back to base and all in him the instant you get level 6. This requires you to stop his Q with your third Q or make him use his Q before you all in ( you got around 6-7 seconds of his Q being down and your Q W E R being up ).\n\nIf the aatrox is not profficient or aware of your potential it's more often than not a free lane to snowball on. Once he gets ahead of you though ( you dive and die, he lives, jungle kills you 1-2 times etc. ) it's really hard ( if not impossible ) to force him out of the lane before you get your first big buy. He can just sustain forever and his all-in is on par with yours meaning that whoever is ahead usually wins. \n\nAlso don't be afraid to use ignite just to pop his revive passive its better to save your wind slash ( 2nd R ) for after he revives for a quick W &gt; R execute. If you can't help it however, use it to burst him into the passive, 4 seconds stasis is a lot of time for your cooldowns to come back up.\n\nThat's all i gotta say, coming from a diamond riven main ( 1000 games over 2 seasons ~~ ).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380008995", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The bass has the abillity interpret the chord. That is what my teacher always told me. Say you have Gmaj7 (G B D F#). You can play any of those notes but they will always have a different feel to it. You play B as a root and suddenly it will sound more like Bm with a minor sixth. So this is one part.\n\nYou can use notes within the scale to go from one chord to another. Say you have |Em|G|D|D| You can go from Em to G via D (because D is the fith to G), so the Em suddenly is Em7! And from G to D via A (it's the second). So everything in the first chord that can be used to lead to the next one works (seconds and fiths almost always work).\n\nPlay around the chord! Say your guitarist or keyboarder plays a chord like Em7. You have E G H D to go for. Try all of those notes. Which notes work? \n\nIf you combine all of these possibilities you can have a melodie on your own (for the bass) that works.\n\n\nYou can also work by using chromatic notes. From A to G? Why not use Ab? Just play around. Approach from above and beyond.\n\nAnd the most important part (for me) seems to be rhythm. Bass is very focused on rhythm. Focus on the drums. Espacially the kick (bassdrum).\n\n\nBut do not forget. Often a simple bassline works best. A lot of people new to the bass try to create a ver unique bassline, and thats fine. But don't over do it. Very often IMO simple basslines work great.\n\nI'm sorry if any of this is incorrect. I'm a little drunk and it is very hard to talk about music in a foreign laguage. I will try to answer any questions you may have. \n\nEDIT: listen to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cd9YJvoQIg). Listen to the bass. Ignore the fills. But this is a great line for the song. It is very simple for most of the song. But it works so great.\n\nEDIT2: To actually answer your question. For me as a bassplayer, my job is to keep the song tied together. I am the piece between rhythm and harmony. I dont want to seem like a dick, but thats how i see it.\n\nEDIT3: Im sorry, but I needed to look up some basslines. [this one works great for pop songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPpTgCho5ZA)\n\nJames Jamerson is great as well, [see the title in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND-iW51idC0). Maybe check out the wiki about [walking bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassline#Walking_bass). \n\nEDIT 4: Do you have an example song? I could listen to that and try to give you my opinion.

{"body": "I *just* finished up this process in CA—I got this!\nFirst, [here is a list of instructions](http://i.imgur.com/fQcD63P.jpg) that the school I graduated from provided. I'm going to write some stuff out, but it is all based off that paper. I followed it and it was smooth sailing. A couple papers, like LiveScan forms, are missing but you can request them from your local governing agency. More details to come. \n\n**Step 1**: Pass the NREMT. You did it. Nice job!\n\n**Step 2**: Get your livescan papers from your [local certifying agency](http://www.emsa.ca.gov/Local_Ems_Agencies). Mine was [Sierra-Sacramento Valley (S-SV)](http://www.ssvems.com/). This agency accepts DoJ/FBI background checks from specific companies. [Find them here](http://ag.ca.gov/fingerprints/publications/contact.php), though your county may be different. This cost me ~$75 iirc. Be sure to get a couple copies.\n\n**Step 3**: You should do this step very soon after getting the LiveScan done, as the LiveScan expires after ~60 days. Fill out your county's application ([If you're also S-SV, you can find it here](http://www.ssvems.com/?page_id=333)) then scan it and email it to them. This cost me ~$105. \n\n**Step 4**: This one you can do out of order, but whatever. Go to the DMV. You want to pick up the following:\n\n * Ambulance Driver's Handbook—$5\n * Form DL 51: Medical Examination Certificate. Pick up two just in case.\n * Driving record printout—$5. They say this is to give to employers. \n * Prepare to pay with a Debit card. I can't remember if they accept check or cash, but I know for sure they don't allow credit.\n\n**Step 5**: Get to your physician for your \"Department of Transportation Medical Examination\". If you are like me and currently without medical insurance, you can pay just $85 to visit a Sutter Express Care (or equivalent) without an appointment. \n\n**Step 6**: Study the handbook. Read. The. Whole. Thing. [Then take a practice quize](http://www.cram.com/cards/ambulance-drivers-test-ca-1556674) a few times. \n\n**Step 7**: Take the Ambulance Driver's test at the DMV, but DON'T BE STUPID (like me) AND JUST SHOW UP. You can call and schedule an appointment so you don't have to waste 3 hours sitting around. It costs $25 (again, debit) and you can retake it up to 3 times in one day. In the interest of public safety, pass it the first time. :] \nBring **all** your EMT related paperwork. It's better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.\n\n**Other tips**: Make digital copies of *everything*. e v e r y t h i n g. They are handy for sending out to your county agency and  [volunteer opportunities](http://www.rockmed.org/). \n\n**Examples of forms**:\n\n * [Medical Examination Report](http://imgur.com/6SJxe5A)\n * [Agency Application Instructions](http://imgur.com/4mJROKV)\n * [Agency Application](http://imgur.com/hRZ6ls7)\n * [Agency LiveScan Request steps](http://imgur.com/0LDjX9g)\n\n\nI hope this helps, hopefully I haven't gone entirely overboard here hah.

{"body": "There is a standard way to notate chords for lead sheets. Because it works so well for the symbols available to a keyboard, it's also really good for naming chords online. In this system, adding a 9 to a chord implies a major 9th and a minor 7th, in addition to whatever triad is there. There is no ambiguity. Em9 is always  E G B D F#. If you wanted E G B D F, you would write Em7(b9). I have never in my years as a professional player who has read a LOT of chord charts, seen Em7maj9. I come across Em9 weekly. Your way is confusing because \"maj9\" implies a major 7th. Again, you can check my guide about all this linked to. It explains pretty much every use case and why the symbols are used the way they are. So while \"E minor with a dominant 7th and a major 9th\" is completely accurate, it turns out we have a really concise way to sum that up: Em9.\n\nAs for Em9/D vs D11, you're right! We can't know for certain. And it's okay to disagree, and conversations like this make this subreddit thrive. I still think that, given the information available, D11 is the best fit. It's okay to disagree with that. I've given my evidence to support it. If you don't agree with me, that's fine. I can see the validity of your opinion. But I still disagree. And that's okay.

So they took the ancient alien craft that reflected light in such a way as to highlight the soothing white hieroglyphics of the alien language to us it might read \" V O Y G E R\" but to them it was a prophecy that they could not allow to come true so they threw it the fuck off their planet. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380095285", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright so I'm going to explain the whole story first. Now it won't make any sense but anyone who's done salvia will know who anti-logic it is. \n\n\nSo I smoked salvia a couple of times when I was young (it was a legal drug and I was 16 man!) it always gave me these incredible blissed out giddy trips. \n\n\nSo in the early summer I bought some (after not having done it in 5 years or so). First I smoked it out of a pipe (setting: is me alone in my dark one bedroom apartment's kitchen) and it didn't really work at all. So I put some in my bong and (like the limitless idiot I am) was 100% prepared for it not to work... \n\n\nBut holy fuck did it work. I immediately felt this sound like a kettle hissing then those fucking hands man (those fucking hands) on my eyes. Then KNOCK KNOCK...KNOCK. Suddenly my mom and dad are in my apartment the last thing I remember is saying: \"I'm in t r o u b l e\" them falling falling falling...\n \n[okay so at this point it's important to note that I'm 1.) the most scared I have ever been 2.) totally don't have any \"sea legs\" and as a result what I'm describing is vague/ I imagine a lot of projecting.]\n\n\nReality is utterly and completely destroyed time/space is gone. I feel like I'm 3 there's something very cartoony and very evil around \"WAKE UP!\". blurring blurring who am I? \"WAKE UP\" screaming concern. hands on my eyes GET THESE HANDS OFF MY EYES DAD! falling omni-directionally. screaming. Panicked movement; I'm back a bit or at least I'm holding myself[ego] down \"ALAN WATTS WOULD BE SO DISAPPOINTED\" screaming blurred screaming. \"SONICYOUTHED WAKE UP, WAKE UP WAKE UP\"...\n\n\nThis went on for 5 minutes or a life time. \n\n\nI'm in my apartment, alone. Wait why is that light for the outside hallway on? I feel sick, gritty and insane I'm pleading to the universe to make it better; crying. Eventually I pass out from exhaustion.\n\n\nSince then life hasn't been great. I've really fallen apart in a lot of ways. Whenever I get really high I go back into that trip. On the weekend I was lying in my bed at a [9] and I could hear an ambulance whining inside my mind. Is this all just some salvia dream? Am I in an ambulance with my parents thinking I'm about to die? Reality is like a prison or safehouse I've constructed myself if I don't hold on...\n\n\nSo here's my theory thus far: I'm PRETTY sure this is real life and that my parents did not come into my apartment (that's a really long drive). I'm pretty sure this is just internalize fear (I love my parents and they were wonderful but they were very strict and authoritative) exploding out of me. I'm pretty sure the curious monkey yes and? part of me WANTS to delve deeper into this insanity. I think if I just \"let go\" (SOMETHING I USED TO DO ALL THE TIME!) I will breakthrough the fear and feel krishna/hyperspace in my life again.\n\n\nFear really is the mindkiller. \n\n\nSorry this is rambly and self-aggrandizing. It feels good to write it all out.

{"body": "2010\n\nI'm originally from Jersey, I'm in Dallas now. The Super Bowl was being played at Jerry World this season, and the New York Jets were hot. Hard Knocks was about us that year, was super entertaining, and set me up with high expectations. Hell we had made the AFC Championship game the year before, we had nowhere to go but up. Sanchez had his rookie year out of the way, we had signed LT, and traded for Santonio and Cromartie.\n\nThis team was fucking stacked. And all we all wanted to do was go get a fucking snack.\n\nRevis held out, but he came around eventually, and as the season unfurled, it almost seemed like we were going to take the division for the first time in forever. Then we played the Patriots week 13 and got embarrassed 45-3. Sorta took the wind out of my sails, the Jets Pats rivalry was at full steam at the time and that loss made me eat a lot of crow.\n\nPlayoffs came around, got revenge on the Colts for beating us in the AFC Championship game the year before. Then came the Pats again. I was a nervous wreck, considering how the last game went, but I had my faith. In the end, winning that game was almost as good as winning the Super Bowl. AFC Championship game again? Can't wait!\n\nAt this point I'm very excited. I was bartending at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas that year. Some of the Super Bowl festivities were taking place just a few blocks down. Daydreams of the tri-state area coming down to Texas before the game, and me leading J E T S chants from behind the bar while making millions of dollars danced in my head. We had just taken out the two teams that had been the thorn in our sides. Pittsburgh was well Pittsburgh, but we were so hot, and so fueled, I had no doubts.\n\nThen the game came, a few of my coworkers were Steelers fans (they're fucking everywhere) so we threw a big watch party. What a horrible mistake. The first half of that game destroyed me emotionally, mentally, and due to my having a few too many beers and being too close to a brick wall, physically. I was ready to throw in the towel.\n\nBut lo and behold, as the second half began, suddenly the offense remembered how to move the ball. Santonio was making plays. I was back on my feet, beer in hand, cheering my guts out and watching my Steeler fan compatriots have the same look of defeat I did just thirty minutes prior.\n\nBut sometimes you just can't stop Big Ben when it counts, and before I knew it, our magical season was over. What should've been a storybook return to glory, became the first chapter of our fall into irrelevance, ridicule, and overexposure.\n\nTo add insult to injury, a fucking blizzard hits Dallas the week of the Super Bowl, no one came to the bars, no one left their hotels. Not only was I denied my Jets camaraderie and excitement, but I was denied what should've been a career couple of weeks in tips and wages.\n\nFor all it's ups, there were equal or greater downs, only to be followed with more ups and then the downest of downs. 2010 was a metaphor for the entire legacy of the Jets since Joe Willy left town, and while sometimes I find it hard to label the 'worst' year to experience, it was without a doubt the toughest.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380129358", "subreddit": "nfl", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

With those 3rds and 7ths.  Learn how the guide tones in a minor 7th chord shift to a dominant chord and  how those dominant guide tones shift to the tonic(a ii-V-I progression).

Basically one tip that really helps is if you use speffz to basically just remember the first letter of each face... so if you know the top left letter for every face that would be A E I M Q U and you know your color scheme well enough, you can just count from each of those letters. So lets say you get the blue/orange piece, then you know it is the BL middle piece, so you count from the first middle piece on that face (Q) and then it's the next piece so, it's (R). Or if it was the red/yellow piece, it belongs on the RB edge position... so you start from (M) -&gt; (N) -&gt; (O) etc etc... and then after practice you will know all letters easily :p. Also a trick you can do is just spell out words you find at random on your cube... So if you see a STOP sign, just spell out STOP on your cube (you can even do this mentally if you want :p.)

{"body": "You may enjoy a homework assignment I had last semester. I edited out the actual questions. \n\n**Consider the signal c(t) = Ac cos(2π fct +φ ) which we call a sinusoidal carrier wave.\nc A is the carrier amplitude, φ is the phase, and c f is the carrier frequency. (In the numerical\nanalysis we shall assume that the phase of the carrier wave is zero.) Let m(t) be the message\nsignal, and consider the amplitude modulated signal\n( ) [ ( )]cos(2 ) c a c s t = A a + k m t π f t +φ\nAmplitude modulation (AM) is defined as the process where the amplitude of the carrier wave\nc(t) is varied about a mean value, linearly with the baseband (message) signal m(t). In the\nexpression for the modulated signal, the parameter ka is called the amplitude sensitivity. \n\nIf we increase the amplitude sensitivity we get phase reversals as shown below. In this case we\nsay the carrier wave is overmodulated. (The picture shows the signal where the exaggeration of amplitude makes is almost unrecognizable)\n\nThus, AM is effective only if the amplitude satisfies ( ) 1 a k m t &lt; . In addition, if W is the largest\nfrequency component in the message signal, we must have fc&gt;&gt;W. If this condition is not\nsatisfied, then the envelop cannot be easily visualized and (therefore) detected. \n\n\nMore fun facts! \n\nIf you do the math behind the physics of transmitting signals with an antenna you would need an antenna more then 10 feet long on average. Not conventional at all. So what do you do? You send it through a **linear time invariance system**\n\nThe idea that is that convolution in time is multiplication in frequency. Essentially you can exploit the properties of linearity and multiply the signal by something like .02 in the frequency domain and make it tiny so that it can be transmitted by conventional antennae. Then when the signal hits another radio an LTI system in there collapses it and uses mathematical filters to sort through different stations!\n\n\n\n**EDIT: Here is a link to screen shots http://imgur.com/a/JMdCA**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380159078", "subreddit": "amateurradio", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

The reason it is so popular is because all these notes are harmonically close together; there's little dissonance.\n\nIf you keep going up a fifth for two more notes, you will get F C G D A E B - all the white keys. Now you got enough notes for the major scale, another extremely common scale. Again, the reason for the popularity is that all these notes, even the newly added E and B, are all close together harmonically.\n\nThis latter scale historically formed the basis of western music. Some instruments can only play the major scale, just like a piano with only the white keys. For example, six-hole flutes, pedalless harps and many harmonicas.\n\nIf you keep going up a fifth, you will finally add the missing notes: F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A#. These \"black keys\" are harmonically distant from the original diatonic scale.

These restaurants were obviously in existence before 79 CE, when Vesuvius erupted and buried the town.\n\n(Source:http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/pompeii/9850077/Pompeii-exhibition-the-food-and-drink-of-the-ancient-Roman-cities.html)\n\nThere were probably other restaurants in existence even earlier than these, but these may be the first that we have primary evidence of.\n\nOf course, it partly depends on the definition of “restaurant”.  The first restaurant claimed to have called itself a “restaurant” is said to be Boulanger’s in Paris.  In 1765 a man named Boulanger, a vendor of soup in the Rue Bailleul, gave to his soups the name of  r e s t a u r a n t s, i.e. restoratives, and inscribed on his sign: 'Boulanger sells magical restoratives', a notice which he embellished with a joke in culinary Latin: Venite ad me; vos qui stomacho laboratis et ego restaurabo vos.\n\n(Source:http://schonwalder.org/Hotels/FoodService/food_service_f.htm)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380216141", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't know the extent of your knowledge about the guitar, so I'll try and make this pretty easy to understand. Please don't be offended if at some points it seems I'm talking down to you. I'm only trying to make sure you understand it.\n\nSo, here we go. Circle of Fifths is a great way to start learning scales.\n\nFirst, you want to know your notes on the fretboard. musictheory.net has a great fretboard note quizzer than will help you learn this.\nSecond, the circle of fifths (cycle of sharps) is F C G D A E B\nAlternatively, reading it backwards yields us the circle of fourths (cycle of flats) B E A D G C F.\n\nEasy, right?\n\nSo, the C scale has no sharps and no flats. So, CDEFGABC\nIf you to the next note in the cycle of fifths you get G. G has 1 sharp. If you look at your cycle of sharps you see that the first one is F. This means that G has 1 sharp and that sharp is F. So, GABCDEF#G.\nIt moves cyclically like this. The next scale to the right on the cycle is D. D has two sharps -F# and C#\n\nIf you move to the left from C you get F. F has 1 flat. That flat is Bb as determined by the cycle of flats. FGABbCDEF\nBb scale is next, with two flats. Bb and Eb.\nEb scale follows with Bb Eb and Ab.\n\nSo, you can use this to figure out which notes are sharp or flat in a scale. You can also double check your scales if you aren't sure. Major scales have a set distance between each note. So, each fret represents a half step. A major scale follows this pattern:\n\nWhole step, Whole step, Half step, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half.\nC-D is a whole step, E to F is a half step. etc... \nConsequently, your 7 note of each major scale is a exactly 1 half step below your root.\n\nOnce you learn your major scales you can learn some scale modes. Ionian, dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian. Your major scale is in the Ionian mode. They are the same thing. The different modes will diversify your solos and give you some pretty cool melody ideas. Scale modes are based off of your major scales. \n\nYour cycle of fifths/fourths also gives you what is called relative minors. If you count to the sixth note of each scale, you find the relative minor scale. Relative minors have the same key signature (same number and same distinction of sharps and flats.) Am has the same amount of sharps and flats as C major. They both have 0 sharps and flats.\n\nOne last thing. If I tell you this major key has 4 shaprs, it will always be E major. If I tell you this major key has 2 flats that key will be Bb. The key signatures (as far as major scales are concerned) are distinct to each key.\nHope this helps. If you need any more help/explanation I'll be glad to assist.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380253756", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nAnd do have any particular goals (more specific than core and forearms?) If not, here is my critique of the routine alone:\n\nIt is good that you balance push pull, but I would balance more specifically, as in horizontal push with horzontal pull, and vertical push with vertical pull. Like, in A, bench is a horizontal push, so do inverted rows, not pullups. However, on those press days, do pullups, because they are inverted. Now, it may not make the biggest difference, but it may give a small sense of balancing in the planes.\n\nAlso, I would simplify by sticking to something you want to improve on, in much the same way you do 2 days of bw squats and 2 days of weighted squats. Do that for your push's and pulls. Do you want to improve the bench? Then do bench, not pushups. Do you want to do harder dips? Then do dips, not press.\n\nIn the end, you will get better and the movement you practice more often.\n\nAnd yes, deadhangs at the end of a workout are a nice finisher.\n\nHope that covers it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380317020", "subreddit": "bodyweightfitness", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The thing to remember is that these names generally noted the position on the field, literally.\n\nThe quarterback is literally a quarter of the pay back in the formation.\n\nThe halfback is halfway back.\n\nThe fullback is the full amount back.\n\nThe Wingback plays offset from the ends on the line.\n\nThe formation would have looked something like\n\n  _E G C G T T E\n\nWB ____QB\n \n\n\n __HB\n \n\n ____FB\n\nBack when these descriptors were used, the fullback was generally a speedy back used solely to run. The WBs were blockers/receivers and the HBs were split in the running/passing game.\n\nEventually, the WB was phased out due to the tailback. Some formations called for the wingback dropping to the back of the backfield, behind the HB and FB. However, when doing this, that would require renaming as the FB would be more of a three-quarters-back, which is a rugby thing. Because of this, they renamed the WB in such a formation to the tailback. as the game progressed and evolved, the tailback became more prominent. He was used as a punter in much of the time as back in the day, the deepest player did the kicking...it used to be the fullback.\n\nSuch a formation would look like this:\n\n TE G C G T T ________________SE\n\n ______QB\n\n__ HB\n\n ______FB\n\n ____TB\n\n\nThe SE is what eventually evolved into the WR. Split ends were moved outside for receiving purposes, and thus also evolved the end position into SE, and Tight End. The tight end, naturally, playing tight to the line.\n\nA formation featuring both of these would look like this:\n\nTE T G C G T __________________SE\n\n _______QB\n\n _HB\n\n _____FB\n\nNow you might be wondering what's up with the offset quarterback and center...well, back in the day, there was no forward pass....and direct snaps were a very common thing. You see, the whole \"wildcat\" thing isn't new. Even after the forward pass was legalized, it took a while for the positions to get set. Passing was a desperation tool rather than a normal part of the game.\n\nThe QB was mostly a block back for years until the 30s...hence the offsetting and general not-being-under-the-centerness.\n\nThis is probably a bit jumbled up...but I'm okay with that. I'll fix it later.\n\nEdit: Also, an RB can be an HB, WB, FB, or TB.\n\nIn today's terms, a TB and RB are generally interchangeable, the WB is basically an offset TE, and a FB just blocks, gets short runs, or passes in the flat...but these positions evolved heavily.\n\nEdit 2: Apparently reddit doesn't like alt-code black spaces.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380389690", "subreddit": "nfl", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "oh god I don't even know why I bother... BUT:\n\nDo you not understand what being a supporter of a football club actually means? \n \nIt is trust, it is belief, and it is S U P P O R T.  Through thick and thin.  Aspas, for example, is currently a Liverpool player.  If, in 1 years time, he's sold, and we all palm-face a little bit, then so be it.  But right now, he's a LIVERPOOL PLAYER.  The reason this sub is, oh, I don't know, perhaps a little POSITIVE about the team they love, or quick to downvote (particularly premature) negativity, is because that is the job description of being a supporter.  Yes, I can sit down and analysis objectively the strengths and weaknesses of a Chelsea or a Man City (as I do not have a relationship with those clubs), and even, to an extent, Liverpool. But, realistically, I will always have rose-tinted glasses - I will ALWAYS hope for the best from every player who pulls on that shirt, every young academy player and every player that costs millions of pounds.  If they are a little shitty at first, I will hope against the odds that they come good.  Because for every Poulsen, you have a Lucas, for every Carroll (and damn it if I didn't love how hard he tried), you have a Henderson - and when you see those players, the players you SUPPORTED from the beginning, when you see them show, without doubt, that they are good enough for this club, the pride and joy that you are able to experience, WITHOUT HYPOCRISY, is the best feeling you can have as a supporter.  And for the players who fail, you can wish them luck with the rest of their career, knowing that they have done their job to the best of their ability, but that they just didn't quite cut it, but regardless, as a fan, to have supported them anyway, you know that you have done YOUR job to the best of your ability too. \n\n(For players who break your heart, like say a Fernando Torres it's a little more complicated...).\n\nThis, and I cannot stress this enough, this is the BARE MINIMUM of what it takes to be a supporter of this club.  Yes, you can discuss and disagree with decisions, complain about a player's performance, but attacking, in any shape or form, a current player (or manager) for Liverpool goes against EVERYTHING this club was built upon.  \nThere's a mantra here, that you may have heard of, it isn't too well known.  Actually, never mind, I can't remember the precise way it goes anyway... I know Daniel Agger has the acronym tattooed onto his knuckles, I know that much.  But it's no big deal.  Look it up maybe if you have the time.  Or check out some Daglish quotes, some Carragher, Gerrard, or some Shankley (particularly his quote about the 'holy trinity') quotes about what it means to be part of Liverpool Football Club, and then try to argue that your attitude is appropriate.\n\nTL;DR: you're being downvoted, essentially, because you're not acting like a SUPPORTER of Liverpool should.  Yes, 'fans' of clubs (including our own) may have built up around the years, bringing with them a slight ignorance of the history of the club, what it stands for etc., or, indeed, the lack of patience that seems to be often claimed to have taken over the younger generations of the world (I'm not old myself), could be blamed, but whatever the reason, the truth is this: we are all here, on this subreddit, as supporters of Liverpool.  You can act like one, or your contribution can be pissed upon. \n\nIn the words of Bill Shankly, 'it's terribly simple'. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380414407", "subreddit": "LiverpoolFC", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

They know the PCs are coming and so they will turn tables on their sides, throw wardrobes onto the floor, and hide behind them. They will lock doors and put large immovable items behind them doors, to force the PCs into choke points and then pepper them with arrows and run away to somewhere they can do that again. They will attack in small groups, ambushing using surprise to get a round of attacks in before running, they will always spread out so as to minimise the damage from AoE spells.\n\nThe enemy will do everything they can to survive.\n\nA lovely alternative to this, and to be used sparingly, honestly the first time you do this the PCs faces will be a picture. You may not be able to stop yourself laughing if you do it but give it a go!\n\nSimply have the entire dungeon run away full stop. The PCs rest, then they wake up and carefully explore the rest of the dungeon.

There is a hastily scribbled note on the floor saying 'You'se Dungeoneers are welcome to the 'treasure, ha ha ha'\n\nPCs: WTF this is supposed to be the Treasure room of Mr BBEG, his treasure is said to be so large it is uncountable\n\nDM: Yeah well you just counted it ... you get 3gps and 12sps, between you all. There is an open door at the north end of the room seems to head back to the surface.\n\nThey find absolutely nothing left, all the monsters have worked out they are outmatched and have done a runner. They have decided to try and set up their new lair elsewhere, taking all the treasure with them, they have also just deprived the PCs of the XP they would have gotten.\n\nPCs hate losing treasure and XP take it away from them and they may be a bit more committed to adventuring 'properly'", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380547594", "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What you described in your post is a fly sparge.  With fly or \"continuous\" sparging, you maintain a bed of 1-2\" of water above the grain and v e r y   s l o w l y pour your sparge water in the top, while draining out the bottom at the same rate.  You don't stir it up, you don't want to disturb the grain bed at all.  The idea is that as the sparge water slowly flows through the grain bed from the top to the bottom, it picks up all the sugary goodness from it and you get wort at the end.  A good fly sparge should take about 45 minutes - it sounds like you went too fast, so the sparge water didn't have time to do its job.\n\nIt's tough to fly sparge properly if you're doing it by hand the way you describe.  I would strongly recomend you give batch sparging a try on your next batch.  Check out [dennybrew](http://dennybrew.com) for a decent explanation of what batch sparging is.\n\nIt's much easier to do, and fool proof.  After the mash you basically just dump water in, stir it up, let it sit about 10-15m, vorlauf, and drain it out.  You'll do it in 2 steps as Denny describes on his website, but I think you get the basic idea.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380558726", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I play sona a lot. Depending on the lane matchup I'll take q or w. Then take the other on the 2nd level. My usual leveling is something like - q w q w e r w w w q r q q e r e e e. \n\nI find early game poke with her very useful, especially that passive autoattack. Then the w helps sustain. I wanna get my e right before 6 just in case I need that extra step if the enemy lane comes in all in for the dive with an ultimate. I give myself that extra step to possibly get out of range. But I have enough heal to get me and my adc out. Though, if I get counter picked and I see a thresh or blitz, I'm maxing w first. The q maxed gives an additional 20 ad, which is nice to your adc, but a solid 8 (lvl 2 q) to help maintain but keep them alive with my W is much more beneficial, imo. The only downside to this is the mana cost for leveling each or maxing one. I try and play her aggresive for the first 5 levels and then become less aggresive at 6.

{"body": "Compared to static languages, it has a great type system that:\n\n * Is much less of a burden than the type systems in Java, C++, etc. Far better type inference.\n\n * Capable of well-typing more kinds of useful code. Various programs that would be a pain and/or be rejected by the Java/C++ type systems will be easily written in Haskell\n\n * Captures more kinds of errors (e.g: No null dereference problems)\n\n * Capable of encoding more complex invariants, giving nicer guarantees. For example, these [ten lines](https://github.com/yairchu/red-black-tree/blob/master/RedBlackTree.hs#L27) not only state the structure of a Red Black tree, but also encode a guarantee that the red-black tree invariants are held (except for the sort invariant). The hundreds of lines of code below are thus *guaranteed* to make valid trees only, and you don't have to unit test any of that at all!\n\nCompared to dynamic languages:\n\n * Guarantees and safety: Many problems that would crash a production system at night will be ruled out by the type system.\n\n * Maintainability: Editing code written by others, or by years-ago-yourself is much easier when it is documented by rich types. Unlike ordinary documentation which goes stale, this documentation is verified by the compiler.\n\n * Speed: Dynamically typed languages are generally much slower than Haskell\n\nUnique libraries:\n\n * Haskell has compile-time-reliable software transactional memory.\n\n * QuickCheck: You write some properties that you think hold for your code, and QuickCheck verifies them with fuzz testing. For example, we can define the associativity property as:\n\n    associative f x y z = f (f x y) z == f x (f y z)\n\nand then we can use: quickCheck (associative myFunction) and quickCheck will generate as many tests as we'd like to verify our function is indeed associative.\n\nHere is a paste from GHCI/REPL session:\n\n    Prelude&gt; import Test.QuickCheck\n    Prelude Test.QuickCheck&gt; let associative f x y z = f (f x y) z == f x (f y z)\n    Prelude Test.QuickCheck&gt; quickCheck (associative (-))\n    *** Failed!

You can take working code, add annotations to it, and it will be guaranteed to give the same result with better/worse performance due to parallelism!

You can write down a type you need, and Hoogle finds a library function that does what you want.\n\nAnd many many many more...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380581625", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
