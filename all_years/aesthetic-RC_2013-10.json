{"body": "Another tip that builds upon this suggestion is to build the ship as it will be in orbit, select 'launch', and then press Alt-F12 to bring up the debug menu. Select 'hack gravity' and, presto, on the launching pad is the same micro-gravity conditions you will encounter in orbit. Now, turn on RCS and practice moving your ship around. Use H &amp; N for forward and back, respectively. And I J K L to translate your craft around its centre of mass. Is everything going as planned? No unexpected spinning or drifting? Good. You'll have an easy time in orbit docking your ship/thingy. Everything isn't good? Well, go back to the VAB, turn on centre of mass (little icon at the bottom left) and adjust your RCS thrusters. I like putting the round single-direction thrusters (looks like a little grey circle) immediately under my centre of mass (4X symmetry!) and then I put standard RCS thrusters (4x symmetry) equidistant from the centre of mass and as close to the ends of the ship as possible. What the single-direction thrusters, which have more power than standard RCS thursters, at your centre of mass do is make it easier to translate left, right, up, and down. The standard RCS thrusters equidistant from your centre of mass and as close to the extremities of your ship make it easier to turn your ship with WASD &amp; QE keys. It takes a while to get comfortable with setting up your RCS thrusters around your centre of mass and a big heavy thing like an orange tank will always be a beast to manoeuvre. However, getting everything balanced and testing it out on the ground with gravity hack will save you a lot of grief once you are in orbit. Finally, consider using the Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-21-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-2-1-Updated-8-17-13%29%29). It doesn't dock for you or anything, it simple shows a little indicator that compares your orientation to that of the targeted docking port. What I do is line myself so that I perfectly aligned with the port and then I hit SAS to lock that in. You can do this while you are still a ways away from the target. I then use exclusively RCS translation controls (HN JIKL) to bring myself in. It is so much easier to dock when you have already match the orientation of the docking port.

{"body": "**His early damage is really lack luster.** \n\nShort, fast trades are generally ineffective due to the Health cost on E, and Q seems to do very little damage, especially considering its mana cost. Using Q to poke is usually a poor choice, again due to the mana cost tied to it.\n\n**Using him to \"all in\" feels... odd?** \n\nWhile he does do well when both you and your opponent stand still and brawl, it seems very easy for opponents to simply walk away. If they move in a zig zag pattern (immediately changing direction when you throw an axe) it becomes difficult to chase, as you have to choose between following them to AA and E, or going to pick up the axe to continue the chase. over long distances this isn't too much of an issue. but if their top tower is still up I think your lane opponent will just run to tower when you pop ult and simply wait it out.\n\nI feel like the minimum throw distance on Q needs to be lowered slightly, or give the axe a larger hit box while on the floor. Another option would be something like \"*While Ragnorok is active, Undertow's cooldown is reduced to 2 seconds.*\" Something like this would at least allow him to stick to his target during the 6 seconds of extra damage he receives.\n\n**He is cost gated in every way.**\n\nMost champions in the game are gated in some way, most through mana costs on their abilities, occasionally by health costs. Manaless champions tend to be gated by long CD's to stop them spamming skills for free over and over. Olaf suffers from all 3. High CD's on all his moves (especially pre 6 and before CDR items) along with huge mana cost on undertow, make it very hard for him to trade in lane, and consequently fairly easy to bully out. Also in the jungle, clearing camps becomes very mana intensive if you max Q, and if you give blue to mid it becomes very difficult to clear camps efficiently while saving mana to gank.\n\n**Some good points.**\n\nBeing able to use E to last hit without cost is a nice feature, as is the reduced CD every AA. Very strong in toe to toe brawls (provided you can find the right situation)\n\nHis ability to peel/help ADC's kill tanks is great, especially during the mid game before AD's get to their own crazy tank shredding items + QSS/GA. I feel like he plays really well in the midline of a team fight, and also gives him more options other than \"press R run at ADC E E E E E\"\n\nHe also has a lot more item choice than before, with AD being more beneficial. I still feel as though HP, CDR and MR are his strongest options. Spirit Visage is very good on him. If you find yourself winning lane, BotRK and Hydra are both strong offensive options. I would just build tanky CDR after that though, you **need** the tankiness once teamfights roll around.\n\nSorry for the huge wall of text and poor formatting, I tried to keep the points short.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380629947", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

Having said this, since Cm would 'somewhat' be included in the key of Am having 4 notes in common(C,D,F,G), I could theoretically get away with using an Am scale over this chord but there'd be some notes to avoid. But the Cm scale would sound better because it includes the Cm3 note (bE) and Cm7 note(bB) neither of which are part of Am scale.\n\nI think I've got some definite gaps in my knowledge of knowing which note intervals sound good even if they are out of key, but I think that's one of those things that takes a long time to develop.\n\nThe other thing I'd note about this progression (or maybe its nothing) is that the bB note is common in both the bBm scale and Cm scale, I imagine this type of chord choice can be taken advantage of from a lead perspective? ie: using that bB as a pivot note between the Cm7 and bBm7\n\nSo to conclude and hopefully seal away my understanding ... The best way to go given my current knowledge of scales would be, as you said, with Am,bBm,Cm pentatonic scales to accompany each chord change as these corresponding scales all include the triad + 7th chords being played in the progression.\n\nAm I on track?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380642714", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A full musical theory rundown, which may be way too detailed (I did enough musical theory for a free high school credit).\n\nThe key of X means that you are playing an X scale. So \"do\", in do re mi terms, would be X.\n\nA major scale (do re mi fa so la ti do) is based on specific intervals of semitones (an interval of 1 fret up, e.g. the sound between mi/fa and ti/do) and tones (an interval of 2 frets up, the remainder of the notes).\n\nIn a minor scale, the semitone intervals are the between the 2nd+3rd note of the scale; and also a) the 5th+6th and 7th+8th note of the scale (harmonic), or b) the same as the major scale on the way up (7th/8th note), and only the 5th+6th note on the way down (melodic). That's why minor 7s can be so different from major 7s. It's harder for me to explain this part b/c I think they use slightly different terms if I was to describe it as do re mi, and I'm not familiar.\n\nThe key is important to know because then you can figure out what notes should be in your tabs/chords, if you are looking to change your fingerings but still play the same chords or if you are playing a melody or solo. In the latter instance, if you're riffing and you hit a note that's supposed to be flat but you play it sharp or regular, it might sound off. A lot of this is instinctual, though.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nA major: A B C# D E F# G# A\n\nKey signature: C# F# G#\n\nA minor (harmonic): A B C D E F G# A G# F E D C B A\n\nA minor (melodic): A B C D E F# G# A G F E D C B A\n\nMinor key signature: no sharps or flats (the A minor key is based off of C major - minor key sigs are always based off of the major scale of the note 3 semitones/frets above)\n\nWhat key something is in also dictates what other chords you might come across. Unless a song is a bit odd, you're not likely to find E flat in the progression of a song in A, since it's not part of the scale, but C# or F# chords would be reasonable.\n\nIf you look up things like 'scales keys notes' on Google (I'm a succinct but haphazard Googler), you should be able to find good reference guides with everything written out.\n\nThere's more I can say about it, but that may be too detailed. If anyone wants to know how to determine key signatures on their own, I can elaborate further at some point.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380690991", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Number 4.  I see the city theme in the Bible this way.  Think of the Bible as a story about a tent and two cities.  The tents of Abraham and later the tabernacle eventually become Jerusalem and the temple.  But the fear of the nomadic spirit of the Hebrews is that an evil empire is coming, and empires live in cities (and, like Cain, they raise grain, not sheep, like Abel)  Babel becomes Babylon, which becomes Rome.  The city of God comes down from heaven after Babylon is destroyed.  You can have a good city (Indeed, the NT Church is made up of urban city dwellers living in cities writing letters from city to city)  So, God eventually accepts cities over tents, but you still have to be careful.\n\n\nNumber 3.  The Redaction of Genesis is not a long book, and it is available online.  The idea is that the final writer of Genesis organized the material into chiastic parallels (parallels that are shaped  A B C D E F E D C B A ) in the Abraham story, and a second chiasm in the Jacob story.  (I can't remember about Joseph)  The creation and Flood stories form a regular parallel  A B C D E A B C D E.  The nice thing is that you can read the main points and skip over the in depth analysis of word use.  It helps me see Genesis in a very different light.\n\n\nCurious question, who is your OT prof?

{"body": "If you're in the key of C major, those are based on the chords you could make with those notes.\n\nC Major goes C D E F G A B C.  So let's take each note, skip one and add that note, and then skip another and add that note (so we'll have the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the scale):\n\nThe first chord is C E G - that's C major.  \nIf we start from D, we get D F A - but the distance from D to F is shorter (3 semitones instead of 4), so the interval is what you call a minor third.  So the second chord is D minor.\n\nContinuing on, you get:  \nC E G - C major  \nD F A - D minor  \nE G B - E minor  \nF A C - F major  \nG B D - G major  \nA C E - A minor  \nB D F - B diminished\n\nIf we make this generic, it applies for any major scale.  So for any major scale, you can say the chords in that key are I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii°.\n\nAdding the G7 was kind of an extra idea sneaked into there somehow - 7th chords are formed when you add *another* note to each chord in the same way.  The I and IV chords will be extended to maj7 chords if you add another note, but the V chord is a dominant 7th chord.\n\nSo for example, in C Major again, you'd get  \nC E G B - Cmaj7  \nD F A C - Dm7  \nE G B D - Em7  \nF A C E - Fmaj7  \nG B D F - G7  \nA C E G - Am7  \nB D F A - Bm7b5\n\nWhere you could go with a chord progression isn't really limited to what's in the video - the progressions that come out of that algorithm are fairly popular-sounding ones, but it's just kind of a cross-section of where you could go.  If you're in C Major, you don't *need* to use a G7 - but it's the only dominant 7th chord that really fits in C Major, while staying totally in C Major.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380740863", "subreddit": "Learnmusic", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I know that you asked this a while back and you may not be following the thread any more, but there's another aspect to this question that hasn't been directly addressed even though it has some significant implications.\n\nThere are a lot of things to optimize for, and unfortunately improving one aspect can often only be done while sacrificing some other criterion.\n\nFor instance, if you want to maximize throughput, then it is much better to _reorder_ disk accesses such that the disk head goes through in a linear fashion rather than jump around a lot from place to place. However, the downside is that some programs may have to wait a long time to actually complete their disk accesses. For example, consider the OS is reading some large-ish file A near one end of the disk, then some program Foo requests a file Z near the end of the disk, then some other programs request files B, C, D, E, and F which are near file A. In this case, if the OS is trying to maximize throughput then program Foo has to wait for files B C D E and F to all be read before it can proceed even though it made its read request first. This can actually get even worse for program Foo because if while the OS is reading F, files E, D, C, B, and A are requested again, then the OS might decide to prioritize those requests over file Z again (since Z is far and all the others are close), so program Foo might have to wait indefinitely. (this is called starvation)\n\nAnyway, measuring performance is very ad-hoc, and degragmenting could _increase_ performance on some benchmark while simultaneously _decreasing_ performance on some other benchmark which has a different performance measure.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380751522", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

C major is C D E F G A B C while D dorian is D E F G A B C D.\n\nNow, you might be going, \"But WHY IS IT FLAT DAMMIT?!?\"  The answer is that the intervals between the notes change while the notes stay the same.  There are half steps between E - F and B - C.  So, if we start on D, we no longer get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1, we get 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7 1 instead.

{"body": "I'm gonna give a crash course on Persian phonology... the \"standard\" Persian is spoken in Tehran, the largest and capital city of Iran, the largest Persian speaking country. All modern dialects of Persian contain six vowels, which vary slightly based on where the speaker is from, but the standard is this:\n\nImagine that vowels come in \"short\" and \"long\" pairs:\n\na/a:, e/i, o/u\n\n* a = a in apple\n* a: = a in awesome\n* e = e in egg\n* i = i in elite\n* o = o in oval\n* u = u in lute\n\nThese are the same vowels found in Spanish, except a. Our alphabet lacks a letter for a: (using the colon comes from the IPA), so people either write the words ambiguously with \"a\" or use \"aa\" to denote the \"long\" vowel (Persian vowels don't have length; it's just a writing convention).\n\nu and i are often written as \"oo\" and \"ee\", mimicking English spelling. Many people who try to write Persian using English letters add superfluous h's to words in order to indicate vowel sound, like writing \"eh\" where \"e\" is sufficient--try to avoid this.\n\nPersian contains 5 sounds that are represented in English as digraphs:\n\n* sh\n* ch\n* zh (sounds like z in azure, s in pleasure and measure)\n* kh\n* gh\n\nThe last two sounds are the only sounds in Persian foreign to English. The kh is a rough sound like when you hock a loogie, and the gh is lower and deeper like when you are gargling mouth wash.\n\nThe rest of the sounds in Persian are simple and identical to the following letters: b d f g h j k l m n p r s t v y z\n\nAll Persian words are made up of only these sounds. Practice them and learn how to pronounce words correctly, because correct pronunciation is critical to people understanding you. The most common mistake is the inability to distinguish between a and a:, so never confuse the two ever.\n\nI'm going to rewrite IranRPCV's examples phonetically for you:\n\n* Hello = Salaam\n* Goodbye = Khodaa haafez\n* How are you? = Haale shomaa chetore?\n* Chaay mikhaa'id? = Do you want tea? (Chaay mikhaad is like \"Is tea necessary?\", is perhaps more polite)\n* Ma'am, madam = Khaanom (khaanome aziz means \"dear lady\")\n* Mister, sir = Aaghaa\n* Hello sir/madam = Salaam aaghaa/khaanom\n* Mamnunam = thank you (lit. \"I'm grateful\")\n* Khoshmaze = tasty/delicious (lit. \"pleasant-tasting\")\n\nOther useful phrases:\n\n* Khosh aamadid = welcome\n* Bebakhshid = Excuse me / Pardon me / I'm sorry (lit. \"forgive me\")\n* Chi meyl daarid? = What would you like? (lit. \"what is your desire\")\n* Nushe jaan = Bon appetite (you can also say \"eshtehaaye khub\", which literally means \"good appetite\")\n* Befarmaa'id = Here you are / Go ahead\n* Khaahesh mikonam = You're welcome (or very polite way of saying thanks; it's a universal response to any compliment or polite statement)\n* Nakheyr = polite way of saying \"no\"\n* Bale = yes\n* Kheyli = very\n* Ziyaad = a lot\n* Kam = little (as in few)\n* Shekar/ghand = sugar\n* Shir = milk\n* Khoshmaze bud = It was delicious\n* Na, mersi = No, thanks\n\nPersian has many ways of saying thanks:\n\n* Motashakeram (or simply \"tashakor\")\n* Mersi\n* Mamnunam (or simply \"mamnun\")\n* Sepaasgozaaram (or simply \"sepaas\")\n\nPersian is a fun and easy language. You'll be saying these phrases in no time, and I hope you continue to learn. :)\n\nEdit: If you want to address the owner's wife, the general polite way is to say her name followed by the word \"khaanom\", or \"khaanom\" followed by her last name.

Paige is too tweener to work in the current program anyways, Emma is a great Kelly Kelly-ish character but she can actually wrestle.\n\nI really wanted Ohno to go over but it seems like management just hates the guy. I thought he was a dark horse to get called up because of personality ... conflicts; I don't expect it at all now. I've seen great matches, promos, entire feuds from him. Don't know what the deal is.\n\nI &lt;3 ENZO AND CASS. Enzo is pure charisma and Cass is picking it up fast. This promo was overworked imo, but S A W F T~~~~~~~~~ TACOS.\n\nMojo looks and sounds like every meat-head I've ever met, but a little uglier and a bit stupider. It could be a great gimmick if he Warriors all over and doesn't understand why people hate him.\n\nAscension don't work for me. I think they are very talented in ring, that's about it. Could be random muscle for BfB, need to develop actual characters.\n\nI don't see anything good in a Neville v Zayn feud, though a match would be nice if they do classic face v face with lots of handshakes and pats on the back and such. I can't see Neville getting far, to be honest. He's an amazing in-ring talent and I am happy when he gets to show off, but there's nothing about him that makes him must-see. I hate saying this, but of all I've seen (a good bit) he has great spots but it doesn't add up to a character.\n\nI thought Graves was ok as a heel; he got stuck with the Orton trap of women cheering for the bad boy. He has a good look and fairly sound ring psychology when given time.\n\nBo is fantastic and that terrible delivery is a major part of his character. He's something new as a character... awful and unaware but completely sincere. Part of me wants to see him on the main shows NOW before his gimmick gets old, but its hard seeing where he would fit in.

{"body": "Thanks for the reply. \n\nGood to know there is a simple and elegant core. And I can see how such a consistent operator naming scheme may help keep things simple and intuitive. \n\nLike I said, I don't know that much about lenses at the moment so I don't really have a well formed opinion. But let me tell you that just looking at the [package webpage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-3.9.2/docs/Control-Lens.html) certainly does not convey that idea of a simple core with some more helpful functions. \n\nYou're greeted with a picture of a pretty big class hierarchy. Lens aren't even at the bottom of it. Getters seem to descend directly from Lens alone which is OK. But Setters which you seemed to be talking about, descend from Traversal, which itself descends from Lens and Prism (both having the same parents). \n\nFrom the package page and accessing what seems to be the main module documentation, i.e. [Control.Lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-3.9.2/docs/Control-Lens.html) doesn't really provide us with anything, but access to over 25 child modules.  I'm guessing Control.Lens.Lens would be where the core resides. If there is a simple useful core, it would be nice to identify it. But here you find references to not only  Lens, Getter and Setter, but  also Conjoined, Overloading,  Iso, Indexable, Pretext, Traversal, Fold, and others. \n\nAnd then the combinators provided in the module. You are right that they seem to be consistently named. But still... there's a ton of them. Do I really want to slowly learn them and start using more and more? Eventually that may reduce my coding time, true... but do I really want people reading my code to have to learn all that? \n\nAnd then there's the types... This pick certainly isn't the worst, I just went for one of the first in Control.Lens.Lens.\n\n     (%%~) :: Overloading p q f s t a b -&gt; p a (f b) -&gt; q s (f t)\n\nOuch. Type errors can't be fun. \n\nNow I know I'm sounding quite negative here which is a bit unfair. Truth is it does seem rather interesting, and eventually I'll get around to play with these libraries and possibly change my mind. My point is simply that at first sight, it really comes across as a pretty complex beast, and it has to make you wonder whether it is really worth it.

{"body": "The thing is, you're free to play whatever you want. There are no rules. Different choices give different sounds, that's all. \n\nYou don't even have to choose a scale that contains the notes of the chord. I'm sure you've played A minor pentatonic -- A C D E G -- over A7 -- A C# E G -- in a blues, for example. The C in the scale clashes with the C# in the chord, but it's a very familiar clash and we like it.\n\nSo you have total freedom; but of course that just makes things harder, because now the task is training your ears to be able to make the choices you want!\n\nTo solve that problem I'd recommend taking a single scale -- say, A Phrygian -- and trying it over all different A chords: A minor, Am7, A major, A7 etc -- and working with the tensions that creates until you can *sing* Phrygian lines over the chord. That's when you really know the scale and can use it creatively. Take your time and work on one scale / mode at a time.\n\nBTW there are some links to some of my more in-depth stuff on scales [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faqs/guitarlessons#wiki_do_i_have_to_learn_scales.3F) in case that's useful -- but it's not necessary to get into all that to make music with them.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380866271", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "C and F Lydian have different tonal centers: C and F respectively. Music written for each key/mode will generally treat these pitches as home base. If you are playing something in C, a C major chord will sound very stable and resolute. An F major chord would not, it would sound as though it should go somewhere. Conversely, if you are playing something in F Lydian, an F major chord would sound stable, while a C major would not.\n\nThe issue is how modes are taught to a lot of people, particularly guitarists. For ease of memorization, we are told that you can have D Dorian by playing D to D in C major. So a lot of people think that modes are just playing a major or minor scale starting on a different pitch. I learned them this way originally, and I kind of had to rethink how I thought about modes when I got into Music Theory in college.\n\nWhile somewhat harder, I think it's more useful to think of modes as parallel to all other scales for a particular pitch. D major, D natural minor, D pentatonic, D Mixolydian, they all have D as their tonal center, or central pitch. \n\nOne possible way of learning modes is to think about how they differ from their major or minor counterparts. So D Dorian is like the natural minor scale, except it has a raised 6th scale degree, or #6. This would be D E F G A (B) C.  F Lydian is like the F major scale, except it has a #4 scale degree (F G A (B) C D E), and so on. These differences from major or minor scales are what give modes and modal music its characteristic sound.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380869994", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I personally don't have one, my son who just got into IT doesn't have one, most of his friends don't have one.  There is this frantic buzz that you can't get anywhere in the world without a degree and it simply isn't true.  Unfortunately, as /u/blue01kat4me points out it is an HR check box, but with experience, which you are getting, and with networking with other professionals, which you are doing, I think you're better off.  Those things count more than a degree and can get you past most HR checkbox automatons.  That isn't to say a degree is worthless, I just advise people that if they can get a degree without going massively into debt, go for it.  If the degree comes with crippling debt you'll be paying off for the next 20 years, then not worth it (excepting in cases where it clearly is a R E Q U I R E M E N T such as Doctor, Lawyer etc)\n\nSo, off my soapbox.

{"body": "Roman numeral notation used in harmonic analysis.\n\nYou know how in the key of C the G the fifth, right?  A G major chord is then referred to as the \"five of C\".  V/V is then pronounced \"five of five\" so you can say that II or ii (depending on if your key is major or minor) is the V/V.  When used with a dominant V, V7, you'll often see it written as V7/V (five seven of five).  Basically, every chord has it's fifth so you can also have, say, V/IV.  C is the fifth of F so in the key of C, where F is the IV chord, a C7 chord would be the V7/IV or, for any given key: I is the V/IV and I7 is the V7/IV.\n\nThis stuff be a little confusing at first because a lot of the terms get used differently in multiple places so context when used really matters.  For example, the term dominant:\n\n* Denotes the fifth degree of a scale.  The note G is in the dominant position of the key of C. \n* With respect to a given key, refers to the chord built from the fifth degree.  G major is the the dominant in the key of C. \n* A dominant seventh chord refers to any chord with a minor (with respect to the chord's root) 7th added, usually in order to give a pull the next chord as a V/X -&gt; X chord movement.  This is why a using minor seventh when building a chord is a dominant 7th.  If that chord is not the dominant of the key being used then it's called a secondary dominant.  It's actually very rare to see dominant sevenths chords not used for dominants and secondary dominants.\n\nSo, how can this stuff be used?  Say you have a basic, uber-common (from classical to blues to modern pop and rock), I IV V I chord progression and you want to add some spice to it.  Well, we know that I is the V/IV so we can make that I an I7 to give it pull to the IV or start with a I and then add the 7th before moving to the IV.  The IV already works as a natural predominant (which, in this context refers to a chord that easily precedes the V chord, which then typically follows to the tonic) so we can maybe make it a maj7 chord (if you made it a dominant 7th chord it would sound better being followed with Bb chord since F is the dominant of Bb and probably wouldn't sound all that great in the context of the key of C).  Major 7ths, being in key with respect to the chord's root, don't have as much of a pull to another chord -- it also helps in this case that F's major 7th, E, is also in key with C.  Making the V a V7 to lead to the I I've already explained.  For the last one we can add a 7th, too, but stick with a major 7th.  So, in C what started as a basic C F G C progression is now C C7 Fmaj7 G7 Cmaj7.  Add more color notes to those chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths, etc.) and you get those classic jazz sounding chords.\n\nIf you want to learn more on this /r/musichtheory is great, tons of great resources in the side-bar there and very helpful commenters.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1380932355", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok the names of the notes can be easily understood by looking at a piano, and knowing why the notes where split up the way they were.\n\nOk, there are 12 notes in a chromatic scale because when you look at the change in frequencies 12 was the reasonable number to where the change between notes was discernible and not large enough to sound funny. If you look at the frequencies here(http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html) you can see that they increase and each C more or less doubles the previous C. I dont know the formula but they use the relation and decided on 12 note scales, and created instruments based on that.\n\nQUOTE \"Why are there even sharps and flats in the first place?\"\n\nThe Music system was set up in full and half steps. \nThe normal set up is: C D E F G A B C. === This is a 'C' scale. Most instruments this is the easiest to play. \n**Unless you play a bass clef instrument in which case is a Bb scale but well get to that later**\nSo in the C scale you move:(F for full set, H for half step)  \nC -&gt; D -&gt; E -&gt; F -&gt; G -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C  \n    F      F     H     F      F      F      H  \nEvery scale is going to follow this pattern of full and half steps.\nSo with 12 notes in the scale they thought it might be easier to have the MAIN scale be the regular letters and the others be sharps and flats.\n\nfor example the Bb scale goes  \nBb -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; Eb -&gt; F -&gt; G -&gt; A -&gt; Bb  \n     F       F     H        F      F      F     H   \nAgain more easily seen when using a piano.  \n\nSee how this follows the same pattern. **Note: since this is a Bb scale you call both of the notes Bb and Eb instead of A# and D#. Just the common practice. As it works in key signature in music. You usually dont mix sharps and flats.\n\nBest I could do in short notice with an explanation of this. lol\n\nQUOTE \"Why isn't there just A B C D E F G H I J K L?\"\n\nWell they kind of did go in order, just started on a different letter. Which i have no idea why. most likely because another language started on a C sounding letter. but really i have no idea.\nC D E F G A B C - &gt; A B C D E F G\nevery place has a difference way to call it as well. The most popular different one is the do-re-mi  \n  \nQUOTE \"What are the points in sharps and flats in the first place and why do poor E and B miss out?\"\nAs i said before the sharps and flats are so scales can work out well. E and B miss out because there is only a half step between them and the note above them (F and C) while every other note has a step in between them and their neighbor so they get a sharp/flat.\n\nReply to me and I will try to explain better if need be.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381026817", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'm willing to let that slide, but troubles unbuckling her harness, dropping/losing tools in space, whining, not staying focused, good grief, someone get me a real astronaut. In b4 she's a human in a high pressure situation... this is what she is trained for.

{"body": "**NP** - When you sprout someone and have max level treants, if you put the enemy hero in the direct center of your treant summon circle you will surround them. If they don't have phase and can't one shot a creep they will pretty much die. One thing to note is if they are moving around in your sprout you'll have to have godly reaction time or a good sense about how their moving because if you don't hit them square in the center it wont surround them fully.\n\n**BH** - You're most likely off lane, and what usually works best for me skill build wise is e w e q q r w. Variations differ based on how the lane is going, for instance, if you're having to go invis a lot and can't get your quick bottle you should go e w e w q r q. Moral of the story: 2 pts in shuriken and then leave it for last. Pts 1-&gt;2 increase 100 damage, every pt after is 75. The 2-2-2-1 build is godly good and works in 9/10 situations :). Also remember to get cheap, helpful items because you're job is to track, do some damage, and help the team. Vlads, Drums, Medallion, all good. Personally, my go-to item build, bottle-&gt;phase-&gt;drums.  *sorry, not much of a \"tip\", but just general gondar knowledge =)*\n\n**AM** - Don't go straight bfury. Without treads/tranquil, a stout/poormans, and some levels you wont be able to jungle effectively and you will just create an awkward moment where you're pushing your lane hard or you're jungling on low life and risking an instant death from any gank. Go for treads, ring of health, and poorman's before you start working on your bfury. You'll have it 3-4 minutes later, but when you have it you'll actually be able to use it on top of the fact that you'll be tankier and prepped for any fights prior to acquiring your battlefury. Going straight bfury makes you useless and unless you're trying to get a &lt;10 minute bfury for luls it not worth it.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381070404", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

You can't have non-monospaced, AND full editing functionality.\n\nI don't feel vim sucks at making important stuff stand out. set syntax works for me. You can turn on italics and bold too if you want (in gvim), but I don't. I guess that's up to you.\n\n&gt;you can define efficiency in terms of X Y Z A B C\n\nThis was kind of my point. You can't say 'this is a more efficient editor'. There's no metric.

Your Shift-Del command example is kindof pointing out where it is faster to use a command than the mouse. And, I had never heard of that command. I guess for me to get the benefit of it, I would have to learn it. Learning the vim commands is relatively easy. All the keys stand for something. So when I want to change the text inside brackets, I do ci(. My mind thinks '**C**hange **i**nside the **(**', and so on. Now, I find my hands do it as I think of it, which can be disconcerting.\n\nAlso, the good thing is you don't have to intimately know the code to still edit it fast. You know that below you have a printf that has your keyvalue string. do /print.*key to jump to it, wherever it is, yy to yank the text, '' to jump back to where you were before the search, p to paste it.\n\nTrust me, depending on what editor you're using, I can think of 100 common situations where using keyboard commands is noticeably (or drastically) faster.

Off the top of my head:\n\n1.) There are a number of cases where when you to use it that users start needing to put in type signatures. \n\n2.)

One doesn't actually need the composition `(&lt;&lt;&lt;)` of an `Arrow` to define an `ArrLens`.\n\nPersonally speaking, my concern is that as more and more library authors become lens-aware they will provide more and more `Lens`es in their APIs (a good thing) that are impossible to use for anyone who wants to use them with `Arrow`s (a bad thing) when they could easily just have defined `ArrLens`es (or `Strong Profunctor` lenses) in the first place.\n\nPersonally I'm happy to define my own combinators to work with `ArrLens`es, so I don't particularly mind if `over` etc. don't support `ArrLens`, but if nobody exports `ArrLens`es in the first place that's useless to me.\n\nSo what do you think of the suggestion of just switching to the definition\n\n    type Lens s t a b = forall p.

{"body": "To start off: there's the major scale. Let's take the C Major Scale for simplicity's sake:\n\nC D E F G A B \n\nThose are the 7 unique notes in a C Major Scale. Each note in a major scale is referred to as a scale degree. In the case that you don't know about Roman Numeral Notation, I'll run it down for you simply: Roman numeral notation is a notation used when noting down chord progressions to represent each chord and their relevant to their key.\n\nIn a C Major Scale: C is I, D is ii, E is iii, F is IV, G is V, A is vi, and B is viidim. \n\nUppercase numerals are major chords, lowercase numerals are minor chords and the vii is a special chord, because it's a diminished chord (usually notated with something that looks like a degree symbol, but I can't use that on my phone, so whatever)\n\nSo a I IV V progression in the key of C is C Major, F Major and G Major. And a ii V I progression will be D Minor, G Major and C Major.\n\nBefore we get on to really learning modes, you need to know the names of the 7 modes and their order:\n\nIonian (Commonly known as a major scale)\n\nDorian\n\nPhrygian\n\nLydian\n\nMixolydian\n\nAeolian (Commonly known as the natural minor scale)\n\nLocrian\n\n\nThe Major Scale is the root of all modes, it is the *parent*. A mode is simply the parent major scale shifted around to suit a different tonality.\n\n In layman's terms, this means that a mode will have the same notes as its parent major scale, but it'll sound different, and I'll explain why in a minute.\n\nNow, let's make some modes. We'll use the C Major Scale again, for simplicity.\n\nThe parent will be the C Major Scale.\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nWhich means the modes you can make are D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian, B Locrian. And they'll all have the same notes as the C Major Scales.\n\nAnd the roman numerals will come back into play now. \n\nLet's make D Dorian, which will be a minor mode because the D in it's parent major scale is minor.\n\nD E F G A B C\n\nYou'll notice that those are the exact same notes as it's parent major scale, just shifted around. The scale will just sound different because it revolves around the note D instead of the note C, and the intervals are different.\n\nBack to our roman numerals.\n\nD is i, E is ii, F is III, G is IV, A is v, B is vidim and C is VII. The tonalities of the chords have all remained the same, but their order has changed. See how this is just the major scale but shifted around? You can do this with any other mode, but you just shift it around accordingly.\n\n\nYou can apply this to every mode, and use this to make every mode, provided you know the parent major scale.\n\nI hope you understood that, because that's about as simple and comprehensive as I can make it. \n\nAll the modes are useful and fun to use and compose in. Except Locrian, not even the most avant-garde noise composers use Locrian.\n\nEDIT: Holy shit, I did not realize how many spelling and grammar mistakes there are in here, I guess that's what happens when I type with my phone.\n\nOn another note, I want to say that I find it far more helpful to think about modes relating to a parent major than to think about modes relating to a parallel major. For me, at least, it's a ton easier to simply nail the major scales perfectly and then be able to mentally move around the notes to get any mode I want, instead of just memorizing formulas and learning how to build individual modes from scratch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381165549", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some other folks have described modes in series pretty well - it's like looking at a scale from a different root note.  You can make modes of any scale, but when people talk about modal playing, they're *usually* talking about the Major scale.  You could make modes of other scales like Harmonic Minor though - but one step at a time. :)\n\nIn C Major, you'd have these modes\n\n* C Ionian (same as the Major scale): C D E F G A B D\n* D Dorian: D E F G A B C D\n* E Phrygian: E F G A B C D E\n* F Lydian: F G A B C D E F\n* G Mixolydian: G A B D C E F G\n* A Aeolian (same as the Minor scale): A B C D E F G A\n* B Locrian: B C D E F G A B\n\nSo let's look at what happens to each note in the scale generically - putting b before notes that are flattened by a half-step, and # if it needs to be raised by a half step.  So for example, in the list above, G Mixolydian is different from what G Ionian would be only because it has a b7 (F natural instead of F#).\n\n* Ionian: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n* Dorian: 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7 8\n* Phrygian: 1 b2 b3 4 5 6 b7 8\n* Lydian: 1 2 3 #4 5 6 7 8\n* Mixolydian: 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7 8\n* Aeolian: 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 8\n* Locrian: 1 b2 b3 4 b5 6 b7 8\n\nNow, there's something that you might notice from reordering this list: each mode is different from the others by just one flattened note.\n\n* Lydian: 1 2 3 **#4** 5 6 **7** 8\n* Ionian: 1 2 3 **4** 5 6 **7** 8\n* Mixolydian: 1 2 3 **4** 5 6 **b7** 8\n* Dorian: 1 **2** b3 4 5 **6** b7 8\n* Aeolian: 1 **2** b3 4 5 **b6** b7 8\n* Phrygian: 1 **b2** b3 4 5 **6** b7 8\n* Locrian: 1 b2 b3 4 b5 6 b7 8\n\nSo what does this mean?  For example, if you're familiar with the minor scale (Aeolian mode) already, you just need to play the Major 6th interval instead of the Minor 6th, and you'll be able to play the Dorian mode.  Or if you play a minor scale with a b2, you'll be playing in Phrygian.\n\nThe top three modes in the last list (Lydian / Ionian / Mixolydian) are all \"major modes\" - they closely resemble the Major scale.  The next three (Dorian / Aeolian / Phrygian) are the \"minor modes\".  If you use the major pentatonic and minor pentatonic scales, you'll find that the major modes are all the major pentatonic with two added notes, and likewise for the minor modes and the minor pentatonic.\n\nThose extra two notes are really what gives a \"modal\" phrase that particular flavor.  For example, to make something really sound \"Phrygian\", it helps to emphasize the b2 and b6.  Without the b2, it may just sound like a regular minor or pentatonic minor phrase.  Those two \"flavor notes\" that differentiate the modes from the major/minor pentatonic are bolded up above for reference.\n\nExtra bonus, the modes can help you easily think of the chords that are in a given key.  For example, D Dorian is one of the modes in C Major, and it's a minor mode - and similarly, the D minor chord is in the key of C Major.  Here's the rest of those:\n\n* C Ionian (major)\n* D Dorian (minor)\n* E Phrygian (minor)\n* F Lydian (major)\n* G Mixolydian (major)\n* A Aeolian (minor)\n* B Locrian (diminished)\n\nAnyway, let me know if something there doesn't make any sense, it's possible that I screwed up somewhere while typing.

ABC fill up the three slots. Next you have only AB, AC, and BC winning. For each of those scenarios there are six outcomes for each, let's take example AB. You have AB4 (no AB3 since 3 is C), AB5, AB6, AB7,AB8,AB9. Repeat for AC AND BC, so you have a total of 6+6+6+1 / 84. 19/84.

{"body": "Actually, better yet, let's look at **chords**.\n\nFor the most part, a chord is formed as a triad: the tonic (first note), third (third up from the tonic), and fifth.\n\nFor simplicity, let's operate within the key of C major (or just \"C\"). There are no sharps or flats to complicate things. Going off of what I said above about intervals, the notes of C major are: C D E F G A B C. See how it starts and ends on C? That second one is an octave (\"octa-\" means eight).\n\nThe C chord, going off what I said about tonic, third, and fifth, is **C, E, and G.**\n\nThere are **four** half steps between C and E, and **three** between E and G. Intervals--one half step at a time--are minor second, major second, minor third, major third, perfect fourth, tritone, and perfect fifth. Well, there's more, but I'm rambling.\n\nSo, this is a major chord because the half steps are 4 then 3. If you replace E with E flat--bringing it down a half step--the half steps are 3 then 4. This makes a C minor chord.\n\nI'm explaining all of this because, while C, E, and G make a C major chord, **D, F, and A** are a minor chord. Specifically, D minor. If you raise the F a half step to F sharp, then it becomes D major.\n\nAgain, I'm rambling...\n\nSO: the key is C major (C D E F G A B C). A chord off of C is C, E, and G, because C is the tonic, E is a third up from C, and G is a fifth up. D minor is D (tonic), F (its third), and A (its fifth). E minor is E, G, and B. See the pattern?\n\nIn a major scale, the first (I), fourth (IV), and fifth (V) chords are major chords. The ii, iii, and vi are minor (notice the lowercase letters?). And the seventh is diminished. That means the half steps between the tonic and third, and between the third and fifth, are 3 and 3. B, D, and F are a diminished chord.\n\nThat's a lot to swallow, so let me know if you're stuck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381217948", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've been playing for 20 years now.  In my mid-30s and still playing in an original band.  \n\nProbably the most useful and biggest \"aha\" moment is when I started to think about my solos (and later comp parts too) by playing around the major and minor triads of the chords I was playing over INSTEAD of worrying so much about modes.  You still play the \"in between\" notes, but the triads anchor you and help you to escape boring \"shapes\" you've memorized and sound more like you're playing with the chords. Sounds simple, no?  \n\nI HIGHLY recommend all beginner/intermediate players try to use the basic open chord shapes: C A G E D and concentrate on groups of 3 strings.  \n\nFOR EXAMPLE:  Play your basic D chord on the top 3 strings.  Now staying on just the top 3 strings, play every inversion of that D chord up to the octave (your middle finger on the 14th fret).  Now do it back down.  Now try to do it with a metronome and speed the metronome up so you can go up and down the neck without thinking.  Now learn this with all the main major and minor chords.  Then do this on the next 3 strings, and so on.  \n\nThen, using this example, next time you're soloing or backing up a song in the key of D (to use this example) , use these shapes as your \"anchors\" to your solo.  You'll find yourself playing over and around the next more, and you'll find you're playing much more \"with\" the chords.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381369166", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

What if a parser wants to actually handle \n&gt; parsing a network packet or a request that contains no data? I can't think of a case \n&gt; off-hand, but it seems messy.\n\nI agree, which is why I gave up on the approach in SCC, at least on the consumer side. There is no such downside on the producer side, however. My current solution would correspond to something like this form of the Yield constructor:\n\n    Yield :: Monoid o =&gt; o -&gt; (o, Step i o d m r)\n\nWhen the consumer side accepts a Yield with a chunk of data from the producer, if it decides to terminate it provides back the leftover part of the chunk. If the leftover is not empty, the producer knows the consumer has terminated.\n\nYou could argue that it's possible for the consumer to consume the entire chunk and then terminate. That's true, but the only consequence is that the producer will attempt to yield the next chunk which will be handed back whole. That's harmless except from the performance point of view, but it doesn't happen often enough to matter.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381426273", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "/r/learnmusic is great for this kind of question!\n\nBut to answer it here anyway, you've correctly noted that there are many types of chords you can make by adding a 7th.  In the dominant 7th chord, the 7th is what's called a *diatonic* 7th because, if you're in C major, the notes starting on G are G A B C D E F, and the 7th there is the F.  It's not the G major scale, it's the C major scale.  *Diatonic* just means \"in the scale\", so when you build a 7th chord on G in C major, that's what you get.  If you built a diatonic 7th chord starting on D instead, you'd get D F A C, which is a different kind of chord!\n\nSo, first thing, when we talk about numbers for intervals, there are a lot of different things we could be talking about.  We have to get them straight.  A 7th *chord*, like G7, is a triad with a 7th attached.  That 7th refers to an *interval from the root*.  On the other hand, when you say that the G is the 5th of C, that 5th is an *interval from the tonic*, which is the base of the scale.  The G major chord is the V of C major, and the G7 chord is the V7.  There are a lot of numbers here.  The G7 is a type of chord that has a 7th as an interval.\n\nNow, there are different types of 7th chords.  I'll go over the main ones.\n\nThe dominant 7th is 1 3 5 b7.  That's a major triad with a minor 7th.  G7 would be G B D F.\n\nThe major 7th is 1 3 5 7.  That's a major triad with a major 7th.  Cmaj7 (or CM7) would be C E G B.\n\nThe minor 7th is 1 b3 5 b7.  That's a minor triad with a minor 7th.  Dm7 would be D F A C.\n\nThose are the three main ones, but there are others that come up all the time.\n\nThe diminished 7th is 1 b3 b5 bb7.  That's a diminished triad with a diminished 7th.  In Cm, you'd probably see Bdim7 (or Bo7), which would be B D F Ab.\n\nThe half-diminished 7th is 1 b3 b5 b7.  That's a diminished triad with a minor 7th.  In Cm, you'd probably see Dø7 (or D7b5), which would be D F Ab C; in C, you'd probably see Bø7 (or B7b5), which would be B D F A.\n\nThe minor-major 7th is 1 b3 5 7.  That's a minor triad with a major 7th.  Cmaj/mi7 (or CMm7) would be C Eb G B.\n\nOf course, there are other possibilities, but you have to get creative.  You could have CM7b5, for instance, which would be C E Gb B, but you'd probably want to write it CM7#11 instead and have C E F# B.  That's actually a pretty common chord, especially in Eastern (Japanese, Indonesian, etc.) musics that like that #4.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381605223", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

A brick requires some base materials (x), equipment to mix it with (y), equipment to make the brick shape (z).\n\nI also need labor to do all of these things, unless I do it myself. Lets say I need people (a). I might need someone to handle quality checks so bad bricks don't go out (b). I need shippers (c).\n\nso into the cost of my brick goes x + y + z + a + b + c. As a business owner/manager i manage the costs of x y z a b c and make sure that bricks make me money when they are sold. \n\nNow, lets say that I sell 100 bricks for 1$ a piece, and that covers my cost with enough left over for myself. \n\nWith your question, if I just lowered the price of bricks, I'm cutting into what I get to take home. That's a hard decision to make, because I have to make money as well. Depending on my margins, I might not have room to do that.\n\nSame thing works with many other things - while certain industries like healthcare are inflated, in general, goods cost as much as they do because at least in part they have a base cost, and anything above that base cost is profit.\n\nThere's also what the market will bear (e.g. if the market is OK with 100 bricks at $1.50, then thats what I'll sell it at). \n\nAs far as healthcare, behind the cost of equipment and supplies are millions of dollars in research and development that, if margins get too low on, become less lucrative.

{"body": "So you have Mustang I. Good enough. \nLearn few basic chord shapes C A G E D. \nIf you are after learning chords then learn how to build them. Chords are not some set in stones entities. They can and should be constructed on the spot if you want to be a good rhythm player. \n\nSo start simple with triads. Understand the concept of major and minor triads. Major and minor (skip augmented and diminished triads at first). Play a triad on a set of three strings then on same three strings find next inversion. Example C major triad:\n\nx320xx - basic form (C E G)  \nx755xx - 1st inversion (E G C)  \nx10109xx - 2 inversion (G C E)  \n\nThe way to construct inversion is on each string to go up the neck and find next note of the chord. Try doing the same for the triad: xx201x (E G C) - go up the neck on same three strings and find the other two forms (3 note chord will only have the different shapes before the will start repeating same shapes octave higher).\n\nDepending on a chord not all inversions may be playable.\n\nLets try 4 note chord: G7  \nxx0001 (D G B F)   \nxx3433 (F B D G)  \nxx5767 (G D F B)  \nxx910810 (B F G D)  \n\nAnd that is it next form is xx12121213 same as original one but octave higher. \n\nNow start with different 4 note form of G7: x2303x (B F G D) and find all the 3 other forms on same 4 strings. \n\nDo the same with other 4 note major chords eg C6, Cmaj7 etc and with minor triads and related 4 note chords eg. Amin6, Amin7 etc. keep doing those exercises and very quickly you will be able to construct your own chords anywhere on the neck. The other benefit is that you will learn the fretboard in the process. \n\nLearn how to play major scale in several positions of the neck - Jimmy Bruno's \"Six Essential Fingerings\" is a good book on a subject.  \n\nRest depends on type of music you want to play. But whatever it may be spend a lot of time building your ears. Listen to melodies and try to repeat them on guitar.

This isn't a J O B where you work for someone else - you're building a business to help expose the product to more customers, both personally and through other distributors. You don't get paid for trying - you get paid for producing. Furthermore, many people don't WANT a full time income off of Network Marketing - it's just a part time gig for a little more cash to a lot of people.\n\n2) \"Pyram1d skeem\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gOZI0uYJl0\n\n3) \"Only those at the top make money\"\nNo, you can outearn anyone based on how well you build your business. You're building a network of consumers for the company, and that's why you get paid. I've seen people outearn their uplines many times over. \n\n4) \"They just want your $\"\nIf you don't succeed, then you ship your product back for a full refund within a month or for a 90% refund within a year and the people who brought you in made $0 dollars from you and the company probably lost money through restocking and consumed inventory. \n\n5) Only Brand Partners are recruited\nNo - in fact, to qualify for the tuition bonus, you need to have 3 customers and have your product for free. At the convention they announced that, in the future, more bonuses will require customers: the global bonus pool, the momentum bonus, the car bonus, and more.\n\n6) \"You need to have other people take a 'negative option' to make your $ back\"\nA basic analysis of the compensation plan reveals this to be a flat lie. Everyone at the \"bottom\" can get 3 customers, receive free product, and get more customers and start cycling (earning residual income).\n\nYou can make anything seem bad if you want, but this is legitimate.

{"body": "Ever since the nerfs to him and Muramana which were justifiable he hasn't been picked much cause his poke rating, spike damage and power curve got evened out and this reduced his pick rate significantly one can say. I still believe he is still a great pick just not face roll and auto win like before. He offers his team a shurelias like buff with his range E, solid single target disengage tool on his Melee E, his Q TTS has great base damage and scaling also a noticeable slow and the notorious range E Q poke combo which is just brutally awesome.  A concerning issue with jayce is his lack of sustain in his kit compared to resilient top laners like Renekton and Shen, no stuns only medium forms of CC and lastly he's a bit squishy for a top laner considering the generally playstyle of him in season 3 the poke build rather than the all in season 2 tri force off tank build.Mate in the end you play what you feel like! Personally I loved Jayce's theme and concept and I will continue to play him even the inevitable rework down the line.\n\nIf you do consider pick up jayce here's a few tips that might help you play well!\n\n1. Start off in range form 1st use it for generally laning phase.\n2. I believe people still max Q &gt; 1 in W &gt; Max E &gt; Skip R &gt; Max W etc.\n3. A neat trick that takes a lot of practice is range Q first and then E rather than the reverse which makes it harder for them to dodge!\n4. Your range W Hyper charge's buff can be carried over to Melee form what you wanna do is fight in range form Q E W R Melee Q W whack whack whack E :3 it takes time finding out combos but yeah it's a great way to bring down the hammer on them :3. \n5. Muramana build is still awesome and heavily synergies with Jayce's kit and much needed stats however since the nerfs to tear your power spike will come in later through the game! \n6. The season 2 tri force off tank build relies on tri force BT and LW with defensive items and generally going balls deep Melee form rather than being the poker!\n\nI can't think of much more and my fingers hurt ahahahaha I really hope you take your time learning Jayce he just so awesome and memorable as a champion to play! Good luck summoner!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381874551", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Their title was \"Kit Kat made an announcement.. so this is it?\" Today's post said none other than, \"This is it.\" This shows that Google clearly has the means to travel through time, and it is thus perfectly reasonable for them to have altered the Declaration of Independence in preparation for Kit Kat. By my best estimates, this may have happened on October 11. You'll also notice that the Kit Kat G+ page had posted nothing on October 11. This is obviously because they were working on the time travel.\n\nIt's been right in front of us all along. It all just makes logical sense. There's a definitive science behind this.

This means that your array will be laid out in memory like this:\n\n    Array[0][0], Array[0][1], ... Array[0][9], Array[0][10],\n    Array[1][0], Array[1][1], ...

{"body": "The idea comes from [this awesome paper](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) on how the Euclidean algorithm creates rhythms that are immediately pleasant to the human ear.\n\nBasically, the idea is that you take a measure of any number of subdivisions and then take any number of notes and you space them as evenly as possible. For example, 3 into 8 would look like one of these:\n\n    | O x x O x x O x |\n\n    | O x O x x O x x |\n\n    | O x x O x O x x |\n\nObviously, 8 doesn't divide by three, so the notes aren't spread evenly. This does however make for a very nice (and frequently used) rhythms. We can then use it to do freaky irregular time signature stuff. how about 5 into 13? Here are two possibilities.\n\n    | O x x O x O x x O x O x x |\n\n    | O x O x x O x O x x O x x |\n\nIf you don't get what I'm going on about I can explain it more clearly and run you through how I do it on pen and paper.\n\nThe Euclidean sequencer name comes from the fact that the Euclidean algorithm allows us to do this even spacing mathematically, so we don't have to do it on pen and paper and can write computer programs to do it for us (sequencers basically).\n\nNow when I said there are *two* types of Euclidean sequencers it's because they do slightly different things when you have two of these rhythms. We'll call type one poly-metric and type two poly-rhythmic.\n\nPoly-metrics create that \"generative\" sound, basically something that is really hard for our ears to identify a pattern from. What these ones do is if you have one phrase lasting 3 beats and one lasting 4 beats, it keeps the beats the same length making the two patterns go in and out of sync. 3 and 4 is an easy example, it would look like this (spaces before and after barlines removed to make them match up right):\n\n    |O x x|O x x|O x x|O x x| 3\n    |O x x x|O x x x|O x x x| 4\n\nThe poly-rhythmic type force multiple rhythms into the same bar length. Unlike the poly-meter type, the first beat of any sequence (almost) always falls on the first beat of the bar. This I can't really represent in text as well but bear with me, I'll try. Let's take two sequences again. One will be 2 into 5 and the other will be 3 into 7. On their own they will look like this:\n\n    | O x x O x | 5\n    | O x O x x O x | 7\n\nNow in this next bit of notation, the dots are there just to make it space out properly. The Os are notes and the xs are rests. Notice that the number of dots between each event in the 5 row is 6 (7 - 1) and the number of dots beween each event in the 7 row is 4 (5-1). This is more Euclidean magic!\n\n    |O......x......x......O......x......| 5 \n    |O....x....O....x....x....O....x....| 7\n\nAlternatively, if these were in polymetric form they would look like this (spaces before and after barlines removed to make them match up right):\n\n    |O x x O x|O x x O x|O x x O x|O x x O x|O x x O x|O x x O x|O x x O x| 5\n    |O x O x x O x|O x O x x O x|O x O x x O x|O x O x x O x|O x O x x O x| 7\n\nThis is fusion/prog-rock shit right here. Basically the point of having a sequencer that does this is that it takes all of the work out of programming or playing something like this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381993518", "subreddit": "guitarpedals", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For each note, there is a major, minor and various other altered scales.  There are other scales for each note that are known as modes.  Modes were actually the first types of scales before our modern major and minor scales.\n\nBasically it's taking a scale, but starting on a different note. For example take a C major scale :\nC D E F G A B C\n\nBy starting on C, it follows the pattern of whole steps and half steps our ears recognize as major.  If I began the scale on D however, it would sound completely different.  It would sound sort of \"minor-ish\". Playing from D to D in the key signature of C would yield what we call a Dorian scale.  If I started on the E in scale of C instead, it would be called Phrygian, which is even cooler and weirder!\n\nBy starting in a different note within the major scale other than the tonic, you can make all the different modes.  Where this comes into chords is more in jazz and contemporary music.  A chord is usually the 1st, 3rd and 5th note of a scale.  Many chords also include the 7th note as well.  One of the most popular chords in modern music is the dominant seventh chord written like this C7 or D7. The dominant chord is the first, third, fifth and the seventh note of the scale that the chord is named for. However, in a dominant chord, the seventh note is lowered a half step.  For example, a C7 chord would be C E G and Bb.  This obviously doesn't fall in C major.  You can either think of the chord as being a part of the key of F, or as being in C mixolydian.\n\nThis is a topic that I don't think I could fully explain to a five year old!!

Prost absolutely  o w n e d  Mansell.  \n\nProst won 5 races to Mansell's 1.  At the halfway point of the season Prost was leading the WDC and Mansell wasn't even in the Top 5.  \n\nMansell ended the season with *barely* more than half Prost's points.  To put that in perspective,  that's about what Kimi is currently doing to Grosjean,  and Alonso is doing to Massa.  \n\nThe ownage was so comprehensive,  and Mansell was so ... Mansell-ish,  that the race commentators at the time were actually speculating that Mansell was intentionally breaking his car in fits of pique.  This might be hard for people who weren't around at the time to believe,  but bear in mind that none other than Sid Watkins referred to Mansell in his autobiography as the strangest person he had encountered during his F1 career.\n\nSeeing Mansell and Prost together really emphasized how god-like Senna and Prost were in comparison to all the others.  Mansell was no slouch.  He was serious competition for 3-time WDC Piquet when they were teammates.  Then Mansell came to America with zero oval experience and beat America's best.\n\nBut Prost waltzed into Mansell's team and absolutely handed him his ass.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382061274", "subreddit": "formula1", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

Everyone is different, so you may find that the numbers give you a different result than what actually works for you. To approximate your cup size, measure around the fullest part of your bust while leaning over so that your chest is parallel to the floor. Then do the same thing while lying down, and average those two measurements. Subtract your band size from this number, and you have your cup size. It's one cup per inch, so 1\" = A, 2\" = B, and so on. (Note that American sizes are inconsistent, so we tend to favor the British system here, which goes A B C D DD E F FF G GG H HH J JJ K KK L LL.

{"body": "\"Mode\" can mean various things.  \"Scale\" refers to the notes and relationships a piece of music uses.  There's a phrygian scale -- C phrygian, for instance, would be C Db Eb F G Ab Bb -- and you're welcome to write music in this scale.  The phrygian scale is a *mode* of the major scale, by which I mean that they have the same notes but a different starting point, so the relationships are different.  The Ab major scale has the same notes as the C phrygian scale, but the C phrygian scale has C as the tonal center while the Ab major has Ab, so they're modes of each other.  The phrygian scale is the third mode of the major scale, since it's the major scale but using its third note as the tonal center.  Any scale has modes!  You can make up some scale, and if it has 6 notes, then it will have 6 modes.\n\nNow, \"mode\" can also refer to a style of writing music.  It's similar to a key or a scale in concept.  A *mode* uses a collection of pitches as well as a collection of *gestures*, and the collection is usually limited in scope and may surround the tonic instead of have the tonic at the top and bottom.  This is probably really confusing, so look at Wikipedia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_mode\n\nAs you can see, there's a distinction between plagal and authentic modes.  Those modes in the page are the ones used by the church, but there are others and you can make your own, technically.  So here's an example.  One mode might be the C major scale, C D E F G A B C, with the top and bottom C as the final.  This means that they're the tonal center.  Another might be the C major scale starting on G, with the C as the final still: G A B C D E F G.  What's the difference?  The C is the tonal center for both, right?  The second example is called a plagal mode, since the tonal center is in the middle, and the first is an authentic mode.  A great example of an authentic mode in a song is Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which has that octave at the start.  There are notes outside that octave too, but that's OK.  A great example of a plagal mode is Happy Birthday, which spans an octave from 5 to 5 and the tonic is in between.\n\nThis is the deal with modes as they were used in church, but actually, modern Ashkenazi synagogue music has modes too, of a very different sort, and Sephardic and eastern synagogue music uses a system of modes similar to the Arabic maqamat.  These modes are made of scales and gestures.  For example, in an Ashkenazi Jewish prayer, there will always be, at the end, a \"Baruch atah Adonai\".  Blessed are you our Lord, who is or does blah blah blah, amen.  When a prayer is in a particular mode, the paragraphs before it will be chanted in a particular scale and have some particular set of melodies, which will be improvised on, and then that \"Baruch atah Adonai\" will come up and it will always have the same melody, and the stuff after will be a concluding musical phrase that's common to all prayers in the mode, with an amen also in the mode.  So you're listening to a fairly repetitive but familiar chanting for the paragraph, your ears perk up at the familiar \"Baruch atah Adonai\", and the paragraph concludes in a familiar way.  So those are modes too.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382134938", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The major pentatonic scale is just a major scale but without the fourth and seventh note in it. For example, the major pentatonic scale in C would be C D E G A (C). Notice how F and B are not in it. Don't feel like you're restricted to just those notes, because the pentatonic scale should just be a vehicle for inspiration in your case.\n\nSyncopation doesn't refer to any scales, since it's a general term for rhythm and accents. To put it simply, syncopation is the opposite of simple rhythm. Any rhythm that sounds \"off\" usually has syncopation. Some genres that heavily use syncopation would be Funk, Progressive or House EDM, and genres that have a lot of groove. Artists usually use syncopation to achieve some kind of groove, or bounciness to the song, and will maybe add catchiness to your melody. It can come in many forms... triplets, accented notes just before or right after downbeats.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDndZn0YPdI Here's a link to an EDM song that features some examples. at the synth at 0:35 has a fairly complicated syncopated polyrhythm similar to triplets over the snare drum that is implying the simple downbeats (1, 2, 3, 4). When the beat comes in, listen for the clave/bongo sounding drum which comes right before beat 4 every other measure. This is yet another example of syncopation. Don't feel like you have to use a lot of syncopation in your melody or too little, but a little bit always helps in getting the melody to sound catchy. Acivii's melodies are definitely not as extreme as the example, but always has some subtle hints of syncopation.\n\nI didn't quite understand your last question, but I would try the original pattern of 1,5,6,4 and see what you think of it. It's basically the most common chord progression in pop music. You can mix it up if you would like. It wouldn't sound and better or worse, since it's what you make of it, and it all depends on you and your song. Again, it's a suggestion and not an obligation.\n\nIf you have any questions for things you didn't quite understand, just ask me, I'd love to help!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382204583", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Yes there were others before it but EQ was the first to make MMO a house hold thing. It was king for quite a bit.. then Came along WoW. Wow did something very important to make itself better then EQ.. it made things simpler.. more player friendly.. it's staff were more accessible in game for help. In short.. it made a player friendly MMO where EQ was much more hardcore. \n\nLEague has done pretty close to the same damned thing with MOBA. It took the DOTA 2 formula.. which is in all do honest a much steeper learning curve. with long, lanes safe lanes, very few actually junglers, Stacking jungle camps and pulling waves into jungle mobs. It took ALL of that.. and made it player friendly. They made it so anyone above the age of sucking their thumb could pick up the basic mechanics. They every day player could get into the game and pick it up pretty quickly. It was more colorful, less serious. In short they made it accessible to the average Gamer.. not just the hardcore MOBA player. \n\nyou can pretty much draw lines between what WoW did to unseat EQ and what League did to Unseat DOTA Two. \n\nand I keep changing the spelling of D o T a 2 to piss off fan bois and grammar Nazis ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382278446", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

Firstly, LoL's S3 world playoffs barely surpassed 600k concurrent on Twitch and the online viewership was only ~1.7-1.8 million concurrents at peak (across multiple streaming platforms). I won't count the TV numbers because the Dota 2 International 3 was not broadcast on Chinese or Korean television. TI3 got over 1 million concurrents, for a game that has about 6 times less players. That shows that there is a bigger portion of Dota players interested in the competitive side of things.\n\n&gt; renting out the Staples center for a \" WORLDS \" tourny. \n\nLol...Valve is a multi-billion dollar company. They generate millions upon millions of dollars per month. I'm pretty sure they'd have no trouble renting out that Staples Center but they didn't because they have a different approach to e-Sports for the time-being. Riot are more flashy and love showing off, however, the S3 world playoffs ended up being over-hyped and under-delivered.

Why then are there a bazillion threads asking for features and tweaks every single day?\n\n&gt; Also.. you again miss my reference when I mentioned EQ so let me try one more time. Everquest use to be big.. it was the first POPULAR MMO.\n\nYou don't seem to understand that it was Ultima Online that was the first MMO to be 'popular' not EQ you twat.\n\n&gt;  Wow did something very important to make itself better then EQ.. it made things simpler.. more player friendly.. it's staff were more accessible in game for help. In short.. it made a player friendly MMO where EQ was much more hardcore.\n\nThat doesn't make it better, simply more accessible which lead to more $$$.\n\n&gt; LEague has done pretty close to the same damned thing with MOBA. It took the DOTA 2 formula.. which is in all do honest a much steeper learning curve. with long, lanes safe lanes, very few actually junglers, Stacking jungle camps and pulling waves into jungle mobs. It took ALL of that.. and made it player friendly.\n\nPlease do lecture me more. How fascinating! I'd never have realised this!\n\n&gt; They made it so anyone above the age of sucking their thumb could pick up the basic mechanics. They every day player could get into the game and pick it up pretty quickly. It was more colorful, less serious. In short they made it accessible to the average Gamer.. not just the hardcore MOBA player.\n\n\nPlease do exaggerate more! It's marvellous!\n\n&gt; It was more colorful, less serious. In short they made it accessible to the average Gamer.. not just the hardcore MOBA player.\nyou can pretty much draw lines between what WoW did to unseat EQ and what League did to Unseat DOTA Two.\n\nAre you retarded? Dota 2 didn't even come out of alpha until LoL was about 2 years old from release.\n\n&gt; and I keep changing the spelling of D o T a 2 to piss off fan bois and grammar Nazis\n\nNo that doesn't piss me off, it only adds to fuel the fire and suggests that you're utterly retarded.\n_______________________________\n\n+1 for effort but unfortunately you're still a scrub. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382293645", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The tough part is to stay above 45 heat, if you use a q w or e at 50 heat, you will get the bonus. You can use a Q W E combo at 40+ heat to get a good overheat combo, or E Q at 60+ heat to get a decent over heat combo. One common combo I use a TON is Q W at 0 heat to get the melee minions, then e 2 seconds after the initial Q W to get to 60 heat, the W Q to get to 100 to get the over heat bonus on Q and extra damage auto attacks.

Gore supporters contend that Nader's candidacy spoiled the election for Gore by taking away enough votes from Gore in Florida to swing the election to Bush. Their argument is bolstered by a poll of Nader voters, asking them for whom they would have voted had Nader not run, which said 45 percent of Nader voters would have voted for Gore, 27 percent would have voted for Bush, and the rest would not have voted.\n\nThere are other examples, the Perot spoiler is also well known.

{"body": "It depends on the style.  In a jazzier style, your music might sound too simplistic without the 7th in pretty much every chord.  In any other style, the 7th spoils things.  So use what's necessary.\n\nModern jazz understands chords differently from other styles of music -- in modern jazz, a \"chord\" is really a whole scale.  The bass plays the root, the harmony instruments (piano, guitar, whatever) play some voicing of the notes in the scale possibly excluding the \"avoid\" notes, and the solo instruments improvise on that scale, or possibly off the scale if they want to be fancy (or don't know what they're doing).  So when you're in C and write a C∆ chord (or CM7 or Cmaj7; these are all synonyms), that's a cue for the bass to play a C, the other instruments to play some subset of the notes of C major usually excluding the avoid note (which is the 11th, the F), and the solo improvises on the C major scale.  If the chord is C∆^(#11) , then it's C lydian instead and there's no avoid note.  So the 7th is always there -- or at least the option to use it is always there.  It's also a common thing to use a 6th instead of a 7th.\n\nIn other styles, the 7th and other chord tones are explicitly added if required.  It's actually pretty easy to use them.  Pretty much any chord can sport a diatonic 7th, though it'll affect the sound, obviously.  A major 7th makes a major chord more bittersweet.  A minor 7th makes a minor chord more complex but doesn't alter the mood much.  The melodic properties of the notes are more important than in jazz, so one shouldn't add a 7th unless there's a good reason to.  Dominant 7ths don't need to actually be used as dominants, either; they can easily be the tonic or subdominant.  For example, F7 - G7 - C7 is a perfectly valid, if very bluesy, cadence.  F A C Eb to F G B D to E G Bb C; you have the bass going F F E, the tenor going A G G, the alto going C B Bb, and the soprano going Eb D C.  Sounds good, no need for resolution.  Especially with a fifth voice, on a string or electric bass, playing F G C below the piano.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382379319", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

No Nader voter gave Nader their vote without knowing that it might have cost Gore the election.  They relished the spoiler role.

{"body": "Sophomore molecular bio course? \n\nAnyway... restriction enzymes (RE) cut at specific motifs in a sequence of DNA.  Most of these are palindromic (there's a couple commercial ones that aren't if I recall right).  For example, the RE EcoRI cuts at this site:\n\n    5' G A A T T C 3' \n    3' C T T A A G 5'\n\nSee how the GAA appears reversed and on the complementary strand in the second half?  That's a palindrome.  Now, that's what EcoRI recognizes.  It cuts it after the G's to give you this:\n\n    5' G                       A A T T C 3'\n    3' C T T A A                       G 5'\n\nAnd now, if you're clever, you can bring in soemthing that has complementarity to that overhang (called a sticky end) and then use a ligase like T4 DNA ligase to seal it shut... and in a nutshell, that's cloning.  I'm guessing you're going to be doing that soon. \n\nRemember to follow the RE instructions closely, especially concerning long reactions.  You don't want \"star\" activity, where things outside of specification begin happening, and cuts appear where you wouldn't expect it.  That's a bad thing and ends up leading you down some pretty dark, time wasting roads.\n\nSo, what can you get from a pre-RE vs. post-RE gel?  You can eyeball the approximate mass of stuff removed from the DNA band, if it's a tiny amount at either end (usually as part of a cloning process).  You can also do classic geneic maps of DNA.  Since they cut at specific sites, and DNA just doesn't disappear, if something cut off is still in the resolving area of a gel, you can figure out how many cut sites there are in that piece of DNA and how far apart they are relative to each other.  Do a double digest, now you can place (hopefully) one site between the several that you have, or candidates.... and build up a map of where these cut sites are.  Back in the day, this was real important, since you did not get much in the way of sequencing beyond a few base pars a shot.... so sequencing a gene, for instance, was worthy of a PhD.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have more specific questions - hopefully this basic short overview will get you started. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382398935", "subreddit": "molecularbiology", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've had to taper down huge before, and as long as you get a BIT of benzo regularly (for me, 0.5mg Xanax a day, divided, though I won't say I had a good day) is doable even coming from a LOT of Xanax.\n\nIt's very hard when you're used to popping pills. Get a pill box, divide some into each day (like 3 mg/day for starters), and TRY to go without as much as possible THAT DAY. Break those three pills up and GET BY. You'd be surpised how much extra we take and don't really need it.\n\nI think the worst with benzos is **seeing the bottle empty up**, so a pill box really does help (or an empty bottle that you can put your daily supply in). And take it just one day at a time.\n\nAnd when you see you've gone all day on *just that*, it really helps a lot with your self-esteem. I can get down to 0.5mg/day with little problem when I need to. (I might feel like a zombie a times, panic, use ice packs, whatever, but I CAN do it.)\n\nThe worst thing is getting that new month's supply and feeling like you don't have to count it out anymore because there are TONS! **You have to count it out.** Count out a day (or a week's) worth of Xanax, put the rest AWAY, and depend just on those 3mg. You CAN do it.\n\nThat last 0.5mg/day though, hell no. I don't think it's easy or doable and have no desire to try to get off it. I would LOVE to eventually switch to Valiums (diazepam), but my docs wont do that. :/ So I'm probably on at least 0.5mg for LIFE. But whatever.\n\nI doubt you've screwed up your mind :) The thing I've seen most is, people who use benzos often seem to have an underlying cause. Mine was physical (just diagnosed), but there's depression, panic, hormones, lots of stuff and it helps to get the underlying causes treated. Mine was thyroid, and it's a B I T C H, *but* the thyroid treatment has helped **a lot**. I've actually skipped Xanax on accident before, so I don't think it messes up your mind too much. I do try to take at least a half mg a day so I don't get convulsions. And LBR, if I don't count out a day's dose, I zip right through the benzos. For stupid reasons too (oh, upsetting political commercial? XANAX! someone yell at me? XANAX!) You can learn to deal if you see three pills or bars left and know that's all you \"need\" for the day. You ask yourself, \"Do I really blow my ration of Xanax on a damned telemarketer, or should I wait a few hours when something worse might happen\".\n\nGood luck; keep us posted :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382420880", "subreddit": "benzodiazepines", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's the thing: in the contexts where you'd use standard Roman numeral analysis, i.e. analyzing tonal Western art music, when you do start seeing 9th, 11th, and 13th chords (Romantic era), they are very rarely in inversion, so there isn't a standard notational practice.\n\nIn tonal Western art music, the idea of adding 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords is the same as the 7th to triads, which is of course very prevalent. All of these upper extensions serve as coloration on the basic harmonic building block, which is the triad. The dominant V(7) chord is most pliant to the addition of these types of tones, since they add tension to the already tense dominant-tonic idea.\n\nWhen you have a 7th chord, you've got at most four unique tones going on, so it's easier for the ear to understand it as a triad with a single extension, even when it's in inversion. When you hear a C7 chord in root position, you can identify it clearly as a dominant chord. When you hear the same chord in 4/3 inversion, it is still pretty easy to hear it as a dominant chord, especially when it is treated with good voicing, voice leading, and generally put in a good context.\n\nWith 9th, 11th, and 13th chords, if you don't leave out any of the tones, suddenly you've got chords with 5, 6, and 7 unique tones. Play a fully voiced G13 chord: G B D F A C# E (#11/C# to avoid the minor ninth between B and C). With so many unique tones, how you voice the chord will drastically change your impression of it.\n\nStraight up in thirds will sound conservative but easy to comprehend: this a chord built up from G in thirds, and you can hear the upper extensions as what they are, which is, as their name would suggest, extensions of the triadic construction of the chord. We hear chords in thirds, so this seems like the most natural way to build it..\n\nWhat about up in fifths? That sounds a little odd doesn't it? It just sounds like tuning strings, and it feels like the notes could continue upward forever, and then back downward forever. We start to lose the sense that G is the foundation for the chord. We hear in thirds, not in fifths. But fine, if we direct our ear towards the bottom of the chord and then hear upwards, we can start to hear again the idea that this is fundamentally a G chord. Bring on any voicing; as long as we can cast our ears towards the G in the bass, we can orient ourselves fine.\n\nExcept, oops, now we've decided to put our G13 in inversion, with the B in the bass. Is this a G chord still? In this (hypothetical) voicing we've got B D F A C# E G. If you saw this out of context you'd think it's a B half-diminished chord with coloration. If you HEARD this IN context you'd be forgiven for thinking the same thing. We can no longer cast our ears to the bass, because the bass is no longer G. We try to hear it in thirds again like we used to, except now we're hearing it up in thirds from B, and we're becoming convinced this is a B chord. In fact, put any note of a 13th chord in the bass and you can build up in thirds all of the other notes, since a 13th chord maxes out the diatonic collection (ignoring in this case that C# is not diatonic).\n\nWorst case scenario, you throw in a chord in inversion, and rather than hearing any hierarchy in the chord, all you hear is a diatonic mishmash of notes, without form or foundation. It might be pretty, but it would not be stylistic. There are simply too many notes in 9th, 11th, and 13th chords for them to be put in inversion and at the same time retain their identities.\n\nWhen they are put in inversion, it's done sparingly and carefully. The composer might put the same chord in root position beforehand so that the listener has a note that says, \"This is what that weird chord you just heard is! It's not weird, I just rearranged it. Please stay calm.\" Tones might be pared out: fifths are often omitted just because they don't add much to the tonal identity of the chord. In a G13 chord you might hear only G, B, F, A, and E, omitting the fifth and eleventh. This brings it's own problems with the identity of the chord; the omission of notes might destroy the coherency of the chord, being hollow where you would expect a third to follow.\n\nI've only explicitly seen the notation for 9th chords in inversion, but I imagine that 11th and 13th chords are analogous. You can write in the actual figured bass, so intervals above the bass accounting for the fact that there's also a ninth in there. Closely related is an extension of the  standard inversional notation; if F9 chord has an A in the bass, you'd write 6/5 as usual, and then in parentheses, add a 9 to the right. I have never seen a ninth in the bass (for the aforementioned reasons; it'd just be too weird), so since standard notation can't account for that, it's better to revert to the more general figured bass notation.\n\nTL;DR: They aren't.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1382424118", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 27, "controversiality": 0}

My name is Emil and I am the father of Max who you walked in together with during the game on tuesday versus Germany. I am writing to you because I am not sure you understand how much of a difference you have made. On tuesday my son Max got to experience something very special, for other children it's about 15 minutes of concentration and nervousness and an amazing happiness to be part of it and meet the players of the national team. For Max tuesday was the result of weeks of training, cheering on, watching Youtube-clips on 'entrances', the playing of 'fan noices' on high volume at home, talks etc etc. Because of your actions Kim my son could experience exactly the same feelings as all others have done during these 'entrances', pride, a feeling of specialness, 'I did it' and an amazing happiness. Från my perspective in the stands I noticed it right away by your body language that you had made your choice! What do I mean by that? Well, you choose to be engaged, you choose to support Max, you saw his fear and acted. Your decision to support Max when he was scared, you bending down and comforting him (even if it only helps for a short while) sends so many good messages and to us that makes all the difference between success for Max and failure. What you do during those 7-8 minutes sends so much joy to us for months, memories for life and a feeling for Max that says 'I did it'. Therefore I would like to say T H A N K  Y O U with all my heart. Now I have a cocky 8 year-old at home with a national team-jersey that thinks he's a tv-celebrity and you are a big part of that. May be that he left the pitch after a while, but he held your hand, he walked onto the grass and he was there! THAT is what means something, you supported him in just the way he needed and took the decision to let him go before it became a negative experience. That is leadership, role model, guidance and 'acting' on the highest level in my world! You are probably not reading all the footballblogs etc but my feelings as a parent are summarized very good here. Thanks again.

Serena says she'll be waiting at Café Soleil for us. Heading outside finally, we're set loose in this massive city. Let's go on a tour. :) Just across the street is a Pokémon Center. /Remember where this is as it is very important!/ You'll probably need to heal your Pokémon, so I recommend you pop in there. In this particular Pokémon Center, there is a Poké Miles dude in addition to your normal Poké Mart--Poké Miles are earned by walking around with Pokémon in your 3DS. He has some rather good items so be sure to take a look! Once you're all done, head back outside. ______________________ ______________________ ______________________ | Poké MART | | Poké MART | | Poké MILES | | | | | | | | Pokéball ------ 200P | | Bulldoze ---- 10000P | | Berry Juice ----- 10 | | Great Ball ---- 600P | | Struggle Bug 10000P | | Moomoo Milk ----- 20 | | Potion -------- 300P | | Swords Dance 10000P | | Full Heal ------- 30 | | Super Potion -- 700P | | Sunny Day --- 50000P | | Max Repel ------- 35 | | Antidote ------ 100P | | Rain Dance -- 50000P | | Hyper Potion ---- 60 | | Paralyze Heal - 200P | |______________________| | Ultra Ball ------ 60 | | Awakening ----- 250P | | Ether ---------- 120 | | Burn Heal ----- 250P | | Max Potion ----- 125 | | Ice Heal ------ 250P | | Full Restore --- 300 | | Escape Rope --- 550P | | Max Revive ----- 400 | | Repel --------- 350P | | Rare Candy ----- 500 | |______________________| | PP Up --------- 1000 | |______________________| Just across the street from the Pokémon Center is the PR Video Studio. Upon entering, one of the receptionists will ask you to make a PR Video--choose your style and watch the fully animated (if not a little embarassing...) video sequence. After he dismisses you, feel free to talk to the girl with pink pigtails in the back--she will give you a Lens Case. There isn't much else in this room for now--maybe we can check it out again later? Let's go back toward the entrance to Route 4. The transportation office, which is on the same side of the street as the lab, doesn't have much to offer other than advice on the town's various transportation methods (talk to the clerk on 1F). After that, keep heading counterclockwise along the avenue until you find a restaurant on the northern edge of the street called Restaurant Le Nah. Let's try out the Double Battle for 3000P! Every course of the meal requires you to defeat the opponent in varying lengths of time; follow these instructions to a \"T!\" You'll also get a reward (TinyMushrooms) for your hard work! Cool! Sadly, we can't proceed any farther counterclockwise due to a blackout. Let's go back to the street near the Pokémon Lab and Pokémon Center--to Vernal Avenue! On this street, there are a variety of small shops. The first one on the left sells evolutionary stones--it is the Stone Emporium. For the record, the guy in the suit in the back-left will try to sell you a Mega Evolution stone for 1000000P. Ahem, you probably don't have enough yet... ever. The next shop on the left is a medicinal herb store--Herboriste. Herbs are powerful and cheap healers, but they make your Pokémon dislike you--use them with caution! The next two stores--the Pokémon Salon--are irrelevant until we can get a Furfrou. There is also a clothing store across the street, but it's unlikely you'll get in as it's for \"Stylish people only.\" A lot of classism here, eh? ______________________ ______________________ | STONE EMPORIUM | | HERBORISTE | | | | | | Fire Stone --- 2100P | | Heal Powder --- 450P | | Water Stone -- 2100P | | Energy Powder - 500P | | Leaf Stone --- 2100P | | Energy Root --- 800P | |______________________| | Revival Herb - 2800P | |______________________| The cafe next to the Boutique will tell you about the various Boutiques across Kalos. We'll come across all of these in due time, don't worry! Unfortunately, we can't much beyond this Café due to that blackout. Let's head back to South Boulevard and head clockwise toward Trevor. We can't go out of the city now, but we can keep poking around this area. The hair salon just across the street from Trevor offers to mess with your hair for varying prices. For now, we'll avoid the Café next door as that is where Serena is. Instead, let's go across the street to an office building. In this building, the woman sitting on the first floor's couch will give you a Quick Claw! Cool! The northeasternmost guy on the second floor will also give you some Timer Balls while the guy sitting opposite of him will give you Quick Balls. This place is all about time, huh? ______________________ | COIFFURE CLIPS | | | | Color &amp; Style 3000P | | Color -------- 2000P | | Style -------- 1500P | |______________________| There's another office building farther down on the outside ring of South Boulevard, but it doesn't have anything in particular of note. The northern portions of Lumiose City are also off-limits because of the blackout. The Shutterbag Café also doesn't have anything, though the clerk will tell you about photography. Let's talk to Serena! Follow her into the café! The talk that takes place is kinda creepy. Again. Oh well, Serena offers to let us battle her later. Maybe we should look forward to that? Head out of the café and go to where Trevor once was as this heads out to Route 5.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382450035", "subreddit": "pokemon", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; vii isn't completely diminished, however. When you add a seventh, it's kind of its own thing.\n\nSure.  I figured the \"major\" or \"minor\" next to the chords was just identifying the triad - I suppose they're all different when you add the 4th note of the chord.  Like Ionian/Lydian will have maj7s but Mixolydian will have a dominant 7th.\n\n&gt; For example, in C major, the seventh chord in use would be C E G B (c maj7) while in A Aeolian he'd have A C E G (A-7.)\n\nSo you'd just substitute the i chord from Aeolian in for the I chord of Ionian?  Interesting - I *think* the end result would be similar to playing the 6th chords from Ionian instead of 7ths, right?  For example, you'd have the Amin7, A C E G, which is the same set of notes as C6 - C E G A.\n\n&gt; So, A aeolian's characteristic notes are the C as a minor third, F a minor 6th and G as a minor seventh. Well lookie there, two of those primary notes are part of our C major triad...\n\nI guess that depends on what you identify as the \"characteristic notes\" of that mode - I usually just think of the notes in which it's different from similar modes.  So for example, I find the key notes in Aeolian are the major 2nd and minor 6th, since those make it clear that you're not in Phrygian or Dorian.\n\nBut interestingly, those notes are always going to be the same for each mode derived from the same major scale.  For example, in C Ionian, the notes that differentiate it from Lydian and Mixolydian are the 4th and 7th (F and B).  In A Aeolian, the notes that differentiate it from Dorian and Phrygian are the 6th and 2nd (F and B).  And in D Dorian, the notes that differentiate it from Mixolydian and Aeolian are the 3rd and 6th (F and B).\n\nSo what would you think of as the characteristic notes of a mode?  The 3rd, 7th, and one of the \"different\" tones, like the 6th in Aeolian?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382461345", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Even in these conditions however, the difference is so slight its almost negligible (and that difference is getting smaller every day). On highways the performance is the exact same because there is no disconnect (torque converters work by using a fluid disconnect between the engine and the transmission, basically a fan blowing on a windmill, except a LOT more efficient [design](http://assets.bankspower.com/tech_article_images/37/Torque-Converter-callouts.jpg) ) when the disconnect is gone it behaves exactly like an engaged clutch, so there is no difference between them  at all.\n\nAlso, CVTs are hopefully going to replace all transmissions, but most consumers (looking at you, Americans) don't like them, because even though they are vastly more efficient, they don't have that \"gear shift sound.\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382489145", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

So you're counting like:\na b c d e f g h i j k l m aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am\nwhere aa=n, ab=o ac=p etc etc.\n\nThe idea is intriguing, clever, and innovative. I have two caveats: first it's not invariant under rotation. Basically, you need to know which part of a cell is the top in order to read the message, and there is no indicator which part that is. For example, the letter \"b\" given by \\-, if rotated 90 degrees to the left gives '/ which is the number \"1\" (or 0, does the \"shift\" apply for math symbols too?) The problem is there is no clear way to tell which side you should regard as the top, unless you write it on a window or something where the top would be \"up\". This is a big issue for me, especially for the folded paper usage. Upon being handed a folded piece of paper, unless I am somehow indicated which edge is the top I cannot read it. Any kind of indication of this sort should already be a part of this system, or else it defeats the point.\n\nSecondly, it's a little hard to tell the difference between when a notch is in the first or second place on an edge unless there is an indicator or it is a double notch. This prevents me from being able to read the \"Google\" thing, because I can't tell if the notches on the bottom are in the first or second places of their edges.\n\nEDIT: It might be more efficient to represent numbers in base 2, just with multiple shifts. base 2 we get 0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,1000,...,11010=26. So 5 \"shifts\" would be needed, OR just encode the numbers all as five digit sequences 00000,00001,00010,... It means the same thing, you had 0a 0b 0c... 0m aa ab ac... with the base 13 thing. This would save space (no longer would m take up two whole cells). Notches and blanks would correspond *exactly* to 1's and 0's. The only thing is that people would need to learn base 2, which isn't inherently more difficult than the \"shift\" idea i.e. base 13, but could still take extra time to learn because it's got more places (5 places instead of 2)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382567611", "subreddit": "math", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'm going to link one of my posts from a while back, so ignore point 1.\n\nI'm a professional classical musician so I'll try to tackle this one.\n\n*First of all, you are correct that this originated as a western thing. If you ever listen to traditional Chinese or Cambodian music, you will feel odd mixes of rhythms or a complete lack of meter. Meters stem from \"rules\" that were set into place that were eventually built on by more and more composers until it got to where it is today. Perhaps an easy way of seeing this progression is to listen to some early and late Gregorian chant.\n\n*Second point, humans really really like patterns. If I were to type out 9 dashes, I I I I I I I I I , I guarantee 99% of readers will break up these dashes up into either 3 groups of 3, 4 groups of 2 with an added dash, or some other compounded grouping. Very very rarely will people look at all of those dashes and immediately say \"9\" without doing some kind of grouping. Why is this important to your question? Because of the way we group up musical phrases. Using 4/4 as an example, it's very easy to equal phrases with a final cadence tagged on (one reason I used \"9\" as an example: two phrases of 4, followed by a downbeat chord).\n\n*You could argue that a lot/most of eastern cultures now use common time signatures, and you would be right! This really happened during the late 1800's once America started to influence Japan. The Japanese started to emulate what they saw from the \"rich\" Westerners in every way, from clothing to music (we see this in their marching/military band style music that started during this time period). The second big push of Western ideas occurred right after World War II after America defeated Japan. Contrary to what you would think the reaction would be, Japan saw America as a role model of military superiority and wanted to emulate the Americans as much as possible. America set up military bases throughout Japan and, in those bases, introduced Japan to rock n roll. Through the years, Japan has taken western style rock and made it into their own genre called J-pop, which is why we now see common meters like 4/4 and 3/4 throughout the world now.\n\ntl:dr- It started as a western thing, got integrated into other cultures over the years. Another part is human psychology.\n\nEdit: I'll note that I used Japan as an example, but these ideas have spread all over the east.

Turn off the power and open your furnace, inside is the board. Running into that board will be a bunch of small wires, these are your thermostat wires. Ignore the actual colors of the wires, often people use phone cord in place of thermostat wire because it is easier to find, nothing wrong with it. The terminals should be labeled Y G W R C. Take a small piece of wire and jump it between the W and R terminals, leave all the wires in place you are just adding an extra one between the R and W. This simulates your thermostat calling for heat, turn the power back on and your furnace should start up and go right into a heating cycle. If it runs fine then it is probably your thermostat.\n\nNote your furnace will not shut itself off while the jumper is in place. you will have to kill the power and remove the jumper. All this is doing is removing one of the possible culprits.\n\nEDIT If this doesn't show you your problem can you be more specific when you say fan?

Let's entertain the idea.\n\n\nImagine five parties:\n\n\n1. Mr. Huckabee, representing the Christian Conservatives\n\n2. Mr. Romney, representing the Tory Party\n\n3. Mr. Ventura, representing the Independents\n\n4. Mr. Biden, representing the Workers\n\n5. Mr. Gore, representing the Greens\n\n\n\nIt's 1960, civil rights is the issue. Huckabee and Biden have previously been in an alliance, as have Romney and Ventura. Gore just got elected. Civil rights is a divisive issue, which causes Huckabee and Ventura to switch sides. Gore decides to join the Biden/Ventura alliance and the legislation passes.\n\n\nIt's 1980. A tax vote is coming. Now Ventura thinks taxes are too high and he joins the coalition with Huckabee and Romney, and a tax cut is passed. Gore is getting frustrated that his pet issue isn't gaining leverage. Since his party has not expanded enough to win a majority on their own, he decides to stay and push his coalition from within.\n\n\nIt's 1990. Gore wants to expand the Clean Air Act. He talks to both Romney and Huckabee, who give tepid responses. Biden gets worried that Gore may leave, so he convinces Ventura to go along with it (who is getting a little creeped out by how Huckabee has been acting lately). Gore stays in the coalition and new environmental regulations are passed.\n\n\nIt's 2010. Huckabee retires and Assange wins an election while representing the Pirate Party. Which coalition would he think of joining? With Huckabee out, maybe Ventura has more to gain from a new ally. Regardless of which he joins, because he's in the far minority, he won't get his pet issues passed for a while. Biden assures him that if he joins them, and votes with them, that he'll get his day. Gore shares his anecdote and asks for patience.\n\n\n==================\n\nI believe the issue shouldn't be framed as \"the US only has two parties\" since this is both technically false and neglects the diversity of political opinions in the American populace. Rather the defining characteristic is that we have two ingrained coalitions.\n\n\nActually, this represents the will of the people- that change should come **s l o w l y**. I don't think the average American wants sweeping alliances to change every election cycle.

So many things I could say about what I think is wrong, but I agree with the video's perspective because it focuses on Batching students by age. \n\nIf I have a group of students and 40% Excel in the subject, 50% are average, and 10%  struggle...\n\n* that 40% needs to try more challenging material. They should be progressed, regardless of age. Old or Young.\n\n* that 50% are on track and should continue their learning, again whether there is a 3 year age gap, or uniform ages. We should not be satisfied until they are where the 40% are. This is their Goal, and our Goal as Teachers.\n\n* and that final 10% should not be demonized, or blamed. Something has gone wrong with the teaching strategy that we tried to employ with them. We should counsel them one on one, looking for the objective(s) missed to understand where each of them is struggling, and try new more targeted teaching for each of them until they are able to move forward.\n\nThat last 10% is not broken, or behind. They are a product of individual needs that the group could not satisfy. They need a different track of learning. \n\nThe Grading curve to tell them they have failed is antiquated. It is Detrimental, and demotivating. It sets them on a path of failure and depression. It is the teachers Job to deliver and help them understand. Evaluation should come from the students ability to move forward to new subject matter. There is no A B C D or Fail. There is only, Ready, or needs more training. I am not blaming the teacher either, but at the end of the day that is our goal. If we can't deliver, either this strategy implemented was not tuned for this student, or we need a new teacher. \n\nOne of the problems is cost. \n\nPublic schools would never allocate the proper funding needed for students to bring them to the level they could achieve. The focus is on the cheapest production line model. Adequate and satisfactory is best, dispose of the rest.\n\nThat is the innate problem. The *Intention* is not to maximize the person, but to produce satisfactory numbers.\n\nI was about to expand and explain what my ideal high school was before I realized I had written down about two pages of description.\n\nNeedless to say, I feel there are a lot of areas of improvement.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382852265", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm really interested in binary form at the moment, but that's just a personal thing. Form is always one of the first things I think about when beginning to write a piece however, I usually have a rough idea and then I write a sort of diagram based on that. I think form is quite an individual thing, and definitely something that is shaped by your ideas. Just go with what feels right. Any composition will 'move', and the audience will not really pay a lot of attention to 'what has just been heard' vs 'what is now being heard' because their attention is drawn to what is happening in the moment.\n\nIn the music I mainly listen to (minimalism), it's interesting that forms are quite structured, but also feel free. You might want to check out Music For 18 Musicians by Steve Reich to get an idea of what I mean. I'm not saying you should write a piece similar to the length of 18 Musicians, but the form is quite interesting. \n\nIt basically has an opening section, which cycles through some of the chords and tonal centers that Reich is about to use, its like an introduction and a sort of index or summary at the same time. Then there are new sections, each with slightly connected but quite different ideas, additive motifs and textures. It could be summed up as A B C D E .... etc. \n\nThis is just one example, but I hoped I somewhat answered your very deep question on form. To summarise, I think classical music is heading away from ternary form and more towards freer, non-repeating forms. \n\nGood luck!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382873685", "subreddit": "composertalk", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I started on the saxophone 8 years before picking up a guitar, so I was already fluent in reading music. As for tips for learning, I suggest first learning the string names. Lowest string to highest in standard tuning is E A D G B E. After that learn your chromatic scale. It is just going up by half steps, or by one fret. There are several online resources for doing this. I'll give you the chromatic scale for the E string to start. The open string is E, up one fret is F, up another fret is F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb and then E on the 12 fret. There are some things you must notice about the chromatic scale, first off it is made up of 12 notes each a half step apart. Next you should notice that some notes are separated by slashes instead of commas. This is because they are the same note - same pitch, different name. The reason for that being is most of the natural letter names are one whole step(two half steps) apart. A is a whole step away from B, but there is one fret in between the two. That is known as A# if you raised A, or Bb if you lowered B. Which leads me into the next thing you should notice... There is no fret in between E to F or from B to C. That is because B is a half step away from C, and E is a half step away from F. If you ever look at a piano keyboard notice that there is not black keys in between every two white. In most cases, when going up a chromatic scale, you will use the sharp renditions of notes and flats while going down. So starting on the open E, the chromatic scale is E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, and finally the twelfth fret is another E. Going down it is E, Eb, D, Db, C, B, Bb, A, Ab, G, Gb, F, and finally open E. The chromatic scale starting on A would have the same notes, just starting in a different place. The next step to reading music on the guitar is to memorize the note names of the fretboard. The reason I teach the chromatic scale first is to lead to an exercise to learn the notes. Turn a metronome on, pretty slowly. Next play each note of the chromatic scale while saying the note names out loud, sharp names going up and flats going down. Do this on every string. The first time you do this, it will be rough. It might take you half an hour to get through this exercise. Do it before you play anything on the guitar. Once you have that down, start another exercise... Play each of the strings from bottom to top and say the note names. Open would be E, A, D, G, B, E. Then bar the first fret and say all the note names. F, A#, D#, G#, C, F. Continue up to the 12th fret and back down using flat names. After doing these two exercises for about a week, you should have a thorough understanding of the fretboards note names. The next step is reading music. This takes years to master. For online material, I suggest musictheory.net. For a book I suggest Solo Guitar Playing 1 by Noad. For mobile apps I suggest Theory, Tenuto, and Music Tutor. Also, if you'd like, if be willing to give free guitar lessons via Skype if you pm me.   ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382913033", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Move your character with W and holding RMB (Right Mouse Button), or just click and hold both mouse buttons. You will probably never use 1-9. Personally, I use 1-7, where 7 is a long CD ability I rarely use. Even 6 is a bit of a stretch even though I have long fingers. Use the buttons around WASD. Things like R F T Q E G X C V. And then you can use all those but with Shift or Control aswell. You can use Shift+1-6, Control+1-6, surplus mouse buttons, I personally use F1-4 for buffs I dont spam (Battle Shout/Fear Ward and the likes). Personally I have a Razer Naga and use all of its buttons aswell, but you dont need that.\n\nThe big thing is you have to get used to the way you move your character. When using keybinds, youre nearly never gonna use LMB to look around you in a combat situation (except when youre stationary). Use Right Mouse Button so that you can always keep targets in front of you while casting spells. I assume youre not much of a PVPer, because if you try to click on spells in PVP, 70% of the time, the target will be behind you and your cast wont be succesful.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR - You say youve tried but never \"really got it\".

{"body": "**Are hex-shaped pixels better than square-shaped?**\n-----\n\nThe answer is, for the most part, no. Here's an easy way to see why. This is how you draw a rectangle and a circle in a square grid:\n\n    X X X X X X    _ _ X X _ _\n    X _ _ _ _ X    _ X _ _ X _\n    X _ _ _ _ X    X _ _ _ _ X\n    X _ _ _ _ X    _ X _ _ X _\n    X X X X X X    _ _ X X _ _\n\nThis is how you draw a rectangle and a circle in hex:\n\n    _ X X X X X    _ _ X X _ _\n     X _ _ _ X _    X _ _ _ X _\n    _ X _ _ _ X    X _ _ _ _ X\n     X _ _ _ X _    X _ _ _ X _ \n    _ X X X X X    _ _ X X _ _\n\nWhich one looks better for rectangles? For circles? Now look at this website, your browser, your desktop, your file system, your word processor. Now tell me, what's more important, drawing rectangles or drawing circles?\n\n\n**Are they viable?**\n-----\n\n\nAbsolutely. Here's what most LCD monitors looks like under a microscope. http://imgur.com/PXPUqFI.jpg\n\nWhoa! Where did all the bars come from? A single pixel is actually made up of 3 subpixels, each showing red, green, or blue that are so close together that our eyes can't tell them apart. A rectangular pixel grid actually looks like this (checkerboard to help you show pixel boundaries):\n\n**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB\n\nRGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**\n\n**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB\n\nRGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**\n\n**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB\n\nRGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**\n\n**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB\n\nLet's take that same mass of subpixels and group them sliiiiiightly differently.\n\nRGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**\n\nRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**B\n\nRGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**\n\nRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**B\n\nRGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**RGB**\n\nRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**BRG**B\n\nDon't see it?

Pretty much a hexagon, right? The difference in shape between that and a hexagon is smaller than our eyes can detect, because if our eyes could detect that difference it'll also detect the fact that your white pixels are just really closely grouped color ones. Boom, I just made your screen use hexagonal pixels and you didn't even need to buy a need laptop.\n\nNow, can we somehow replace the rectangular subpixels with something different? Absolutely, in fact, there are more [subpixel geometries](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Pixel_geometry_01_Pengo.jpg) than the most common square one, and *gasp*! Some of them are kind of hexagonal. So yes, it is possible to build a hexagonal pixel.\n\nIn Conclusion, a.k.a.\n-----\n**tl:dr;** Hexagonal pixels are not really better if you want to draw rectangles, which is what all of our UIs are based off of. And yes, you can make hexagonal pixels, because pixels are actually lies, they're just even tinier subpixels that can only be different brightnesses of red, green, or blue.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382933713", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 249, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As everyone else has so delightfully pointed out, the artists don't need to explain themselves.\n\nBut you're asking about definitions of things in music theory.  How can a song have both a G and a G# without changing key?\n\nFirst answer: it changes the key and you just didn't notice.  Then it went back to the original key as if nothing had happened.\n\nSecond answer: the chord's not in the key.  The key signature you write at the start doesn't dictate what notes you can play.  It just describes the piece; it tells you what the primary relationships are and which note is the center.  And sometimes the description just doesn't fit completely.  A piece may be in G major, but it could have E major chords which aren't in the key and contrast with the key and sound weird, and that's OK because some people like weird music.\n\nThird answer: the chord's related to the key.  The \"smoothest\" way to get to G is by way of D7.  What if you're in C?  G is the dominant, so you use it all the time, and you don't always want to use Dm to get to it.  Why not D7?  \"Because we're in C, you dumbass!\"  Wrong answer.  There's no law that bans F#'s in C.  Use whatever you want.  That's called a secondary dominant.  If you use an Ab - Bb - C progression in C, you'll notice that Ab major and Bb major are not in the key of C major.  They're in the key of C *minor*, though.  Some would say you've \"borrowed from the parallel minor\".  Sometimes you get interesting chords by means of melodic lines.  For example, if you see a chord with the notes Ab C D F#, or as some would mistakenly call it, Ab7(b5), that's a melodic construct; each of those notes is going somewhere in particular, and it resolves to G B D G or G B D F.  The chord itself is called an augmented 6th chord because of the augmented 6th between the Ab and the F#.  Another useful progression would be something like F - Fm - C, where one voice plays A Ab G.  That's a nice and relaxing chromatic line.\n\nTo summarize, it's a perfectly natural thing to step outside the key on occasion.

{"body": "Here's my attempt to explain it.\n\nThe best analogy I can think of for a time signature is a fraction, just like you would in fifth grade math class. Take [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ODrFZDleYE) for example, (not metal but has a easy pulse to recognize). This song, like the vast majority of other music is in 4/4, you can tell because you can literally count out 1...2...3...4 and you can do that over and over for the whole song without overlapping into other measures. If you are having trouble understanding this listen to the bass and the snare for guidance. So it'll look like this\n\n1     2     3     4    \nB    S     B     S\n\n... Meaning that the drummer will be hitting the bass drum on every 1st and 3rd beat of the measure and the snare on the 2nd and fourth beat as long as they are not doing a neat drum fill or anything like that. This is not universal and different styles could switch up the two.\n\nNow once you understand what a 4/4 beat is and how to identify it try listening to [this song by Guthrie Govan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U02_F5E4_Bk).\n\nThis song is in 5/4, meaning it just has **1** extra beat compared to that techno song in the beginning, that's it. Once the drums kick in try counting it out along with the drums. This time the drummer is emphasizing only the 4th beat with his snare (S) while keeping the bass on 1 and 3 (B), with a nice tasteful cymbal flick on the fifth beat (C)and a weak cymbal on the 2nd beat (x). So it looks like this.\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nB  x B S C\n\nNotice how the only the difference between the 4/4 and 5/4 is just the one extra beat and a different emphasis on some of the beats, that is essentially what a musician is doing who is writing in odd time signatures, **basically shortening or lengthening different musical ideas and emphasizing the different notes.**\n\nSo... let's just say I wrote this riff in 4/4 and I want to spice it up a bit by turning it into an odd time signature. In 4/4 and tabbed out it can look like this:\n\nA|--------0-3-5-----\n\nE|-0-3-5--------7-5-\n    \n   e e e e e e e e\n\nWhere every note played is an 8th note (that's what the \"e\" under the tab means), meaning that each is note literally takes place for 1/8 of the time of the total measure. This where that analogy to fractions takes place. If it wanted to change it to 5/4 for instance, all I would have to do is add one extra quarter note beat. This could be one extra quarter note or two extra eighth notes. So now if I were in 5/4 it could be this now:\n\nA|--------0-3-5-----7-5\n\nE|-0-3-5--------7-5---\n  \n     e e e e e e e e e e\n\nSo now I am playing 10 eighth notes so the time signature is 10/8 but isn't 10/8 the exact same thing as 5/4? (Remember 5th grade math).\n\nHopefully this will help clarify things, time signatures can be a difficult and abstract process at first but can easily be understood if broken down. For practice I would recommend downloading [TuxGuitar](http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/), a free tablature program that plays the music and shows you the actual notation, and downloading some songs that incorporate a lot of odd time signature changes such as in [Tool's Rosetta Stoned](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/t/tool/rosetta_stoned_ver2_guitar_pro.htm) or [Porcupine Tree's Anesthetize](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/p/porcupine_tree/anesthetize_ver2_guitar_pro.htm). With TuxGuitar the time signature will be displayed. \n\nIn one part of Anesthetize there is a riff that alternates between 23/16 and 25/16 (I haven't seen anything much more \"weirder\" than that. So you take the number on top of the fraction and count that out yourself (The 23 or the 25, depending on the measure in this instance). Since it's the 16th note being played, you're going to have to count out to 23 pretty damn fast because a 16th note takes up a lot less time than an eighth note or much much more less than a quarter note. This riff can be seen [here at the 9:39 mark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKeTD8E8Nkg). \n\n\n\nHopefully this clarifies a few things, if anyone has questions I could try clarifying some more or providing more examples. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1382994129", "subreddit": "progmetal", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some one else got a lot of downvotes for stressing what OP could have done/could do in the future to avoid the danger here, as did my comment, which said something similar.  It's not OP's *fault* at all, but there seems to be some need to stress the vulnerability/self-protection factor on some people's part, and this is incurring a lot of negative reactions. Why? It's missing the culpability of the rapist. I did stress that she should go to the police, call his friends, etc., but that wasn't enough for the downvoters. No, they want something else. What exactly is it that they want? The idea is that everything or anything that stresses avoiding the vulnerability that comes with being alone with strange guys, when there is a little alcohol (or at times a lot) in the mix, etc., somehow plays back into rape culture. I am not sure this is the case. As I said, I stressed that OP should go to the police (and more than that), but no, that isn't enough. The idea is that any emphasis on anything along the lines of \"protect yourself\" is *verboten*. \n\nI think this is similar to the reaction after 9/11 in which it was forbidden to characterize the bombers as courageous. They were clearly rather courageous, but let me add horrifically violent terrorists lest this be taken for my extolling them as heroes, which I am not. Did I spell that out clearly enough? Or am I wearing the kind of clothes that will get the downvoters excited and prompt them to jump my bones for calling the 9/11 bombers \"heroes\"? Maybe you see where I'm going with this. The idea here is that all thinking, perceptions must be subordinated to the hubris of the anti-rape cause, a good cause, of course. Yes, let me spell that out clearly: being anti-rape is g o o d  c a u s e, and I am not endorsing or condoning rape. \n\nBut that's where things get tricky. To subordinate a cause to a strong passion, be it righteous or malicious, means just that: to subordinate thought, to subordinate making distinctions, rationality, etc. And who does that most of all? Yup, the rapist. Now this may seem quite the leap. On the other hand, let's go back to the 9/11 scenario. A lot of subordination of thought and rationality went on after that, didn't it? I suggest that the seeds for more terrorism were sown right in the righteous reaction to the bombings, in that moment in which it was decided to say things like \"they were *cowards*!\" In which it was decided to keep though subordinated and to launch a war against Iraq for what those predominantly Saudis under Al-Qaeda did.\n\nHere we have instances of what could be called thought-subordinated anti-rape culture. Thought is subordinated insofar as it thought is beholden strictly to the resistance against the idea of blaming the victim, to the point of stressing that any emphasis on her avoiding dangerous situations amounts to letting rapists off as people who can't control themselves. My response stressed simply both things. That was not enough. No, I am to completely remove any such stress, stop making distinctions, and above all not stress two things at once. I am to focus only on the desired object and go in for the kill: rape is the rapist's fault and any emphasis on security amounts to endorsing rape. \n\nNow, as I indicated, I suggested that this itself a bit of a rapacious approach. I drew a parallel with 9/11, suggesting essentially that the response to 9/11 was itself a bit of terrorism. I would suggest that too strong a reaction of the kind in evidence here in the end will actually contribute to rape culture in much the same way that post-9/11 reactions have seen the rise of global terrorism. But how? Just how could a more robust, strident and (as I suggest) doctrinaire culture actually lead to more rapes or, at least, a less then optimal reduction in them?\n\nWell, the answer to that question requires thought, and that's part of what is being put out of play in the current and predominant modes of activist/movement-oriented culture. This culture tends to be single-issue oriented, cause-committed and thought-subordinated. Which is, again, the very MO of the rapist.\n\nWhat such an approach is committed to do most of all is portray the rapist as absolutely incorrigible, inhuman, untreatable, an impossible criminal requiring life imprisonment or sterilization, etc. In a recent comment elsewhere I tried to make some steps into actually understanding a rapist and how rape is possible. You can imagine the response. Any attempt to do so will, like my attempts to stress security for OP, be regarded as being sympathetic (my interlocutor's term) with the rapist. Indeed. And by extension, ultimately any attempt to understand criminals in general will be seen as sympathizing with criminals and crime. And yet, isn't it odd that we have such a high incarceration rate in the US? And isn't it odd that the progressives who want change really don't want to get into the humanization or re-humanization of the criminals who are put into the CJ system? And what about this rapist in the case of the OP? I stressed in my response that it probably was rape in any case, which went unnoticed as the eyes skimmed across my comment, undressing it and seeking only what the downvoters wished to find: *a sympathizer*!\n\nAnd I will say outright that I am a sympathizer with all criminals. Every single one. This is not because I wish to further their crimes. The current, predominant culture and mentality is one of capture and punish. It is also understood, especially among progressives, that this is not so effective. But the implications and necessities of actual sympathy fully eludes most. My comment to OP did not stress the condition of the rapist at all, BTW; I only stressed both her safety/well being and her getting the info over to police, etc. But I would, indeed, go so far as to say we need to look into the heart of that rapist. With necessary sympathy, which means, at the same time, with a full freedom of thought. Not to endorse rape, but to understand and ameliorate. I suggest that strident anti-rape culture is not going to foot the bill. And that as long as it uses a thought-subordinated approach, it will tend to feed into a monolithic, simplistic culture that makes a kind of football game of \"getting to the goal post no matter what\" in any issue. And when that mentality dominates, rape is furthered among those who are prone to rape. \n\nWere a more thoughtful approach used, smarter approaches that could target the real features of rape and the vulnerability to the propensity to it would emerge. There should indeed be *campaigns*, just as there should have been campaigns after 9/11, but whether they should take the form vaunted and enforced (socially and legally both) today is an open question to me. But then, that's what questions should do: they should spread their legs and remain open, without fearing getting raped by doctrinaire football players of the anti-rape cause regardless of how many end up being raped. For you can be fully assured, if the anti-rape campaign goes the way of the war on drugs, for those in the trenches there is one simple answer to the cries that \"it's not working!\": *collateral damage*, a catch-all dismissive concept brought to you by you know who. \n\nMy use of the idea of anti-rape being rapacious is very incendiary, I realize. To call people who are opposed to rape \"rapacious\" is about as crazy as calling those who...well, who opposed 9/11 \"terrorists\". Well, you see I can't get out of the straight-jacket I've made for myself. But is it me who is wearing it?

{"body": "Basically all you need to understand is putting a capo on a guitar will raise the pitch of all the notes by a semitone,the difference between a note and the next note in chromatic order, (for example there is a semitone difference between A and A#, \"#\" symbol indicates a sharp and a \"b\" indicates a flat. These notes are referred to as accidentals (more on that later) , for each fret it is raised.\n\nFor example if a capo is placed on the 2nd fret, it will raise every note played by 2 semitones, or a full tone (Your E A D G B E tuning would then become D B E A C# D)\n\nThis change will also affect chords being played. For example, if you take the shape of an D major chord, and play it with a capo on the second fret (treating the first fret after the capo like the 1st fret) the sounding chord will actually be E major, because E is a full tone above D.\n\nThis seems pretty straight forward, except there are two anomalies in the chromatic ordering of tones:\n\nThe musical scale consists of tones from A to G ( A B C D E F G)\n\nAs in the above example going from D to E is two full semi-tones, this is because there is a note between D and E. It is referred to either as D# or Eb (both are correct) This is the case for most gaps between full notes (ones that are not flat or sharp).\n\nHowever, there are two special cases: the gap between B and C and the gap between E and F. Both of these gaps are only made up of 1 semi-tone. In other words, there is not a sharp (or flat) between these notes.\n\nSo the full chromatic range (written as sharps): \nA A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#\n\n(as flats) A Bb B C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab\n\nSo if you were to take an E note, to raise it to an F note it would be 1 semi-tone (or one fret). If you were to raise an E note a full tone it would become F# (or Gb).\n\nSo this makes chords a little more complicated when using a capo.\nFrom the original chord example (Capo on the 2nd Fret) any of the chords that would have a full tone between them (C to D for example) will just go up one letter in pitch. However, if you take a B chord shape, it will be raised to the accidental above the next letter chord. So the B shaped will actually sound like a C# (or Db) chord.\n\nSo take a standard chord progression of Am F C G. If a capo is on the 2nd fret of your guitar and you want the chords to ring as Am F C G you would have to play the chord progression Gm D# A# F. Notice that where the accidental is. It is also important to note that capo'd chords keep their major or minor sound.\n\nUltimately, just remember that a fret is equal to one semi-tone, so what ever fret the capo is on is how many semitones the note or chord is above what it would be without a capo on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383114317", "subreddit": "rocksmith", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Instead of chord charts learn how to construct chords yourself. There are many possible voicing for each chords and charts are ok if you look for new or unusual voicings but for current needs and for as ranging your guitar comping you will do better if you know how to build them on the spot.   \nSince you play in the band with several other instruments you DO NOT have to play all the notes of the chord. Bass player will take care of root and fifth so it is safe to skip those - unless perhaps dealing with altered chords where 5th is sharp or flat - eg Cm7b5.   \nOtherwise the two note you must play is 3rd (or 4th if sus chord) and 7th (if exists for a given chord). And as many other extensions as you can squeeze but don't go overboard - most of the time 4 note chords are completely sufficient. Or triads or even chord tones (3rd and 7th).   \nTo construct the chord just read the symbol - map all extensions to notes and find come voicing (with or without root and fifth) that contain these notes.  \nFor your specific examples:   \nA^9 sus\nA D (4th) E (5th) G (b7th) B (9th)\nSkip 5th so notes are A D G B and you can play them in any order.  \nDepending on style of music you can comp on low 4 strings, middle or hight.  \nWith or without open strings.  \nSo x0000x is actually one possible voicing although hard to manage timing with so many open strings.

{"body": "Hi, coming in from the opposite perspective at this point.  The way my (very much former) best friend of 8 years felt towards me is the way you feel towards your BFF.  My former bestie's problems worsened and worsened to the extent she was vehemently taking the side of a guy that threw me into a wall as well as a guy who attempted to rape me, and spent a lot of time passive-aggressively trying (and failing) to slander my reputation and turn friends against me.  At this point I realized that her pain (which I had always observed and been aware of) had grown to a point that neither of us was capable of serving the other, and I cut her out of my life.  \n\nHere's the thing.  I wish I hadn't had to do that.  The truth is, I always thought she was A M A Z I N G; she had this complex of self-hatred that completely baffled me.  Eventually it consumed her - word on the street is she isn't doing so hot today.  I pray for her nightly and will always love her, but there's nothing anyone could do to make me let her back into my life.  I haven't spoken to her in 2 years; and the last 2 years I WAS speaking to her, I was actually speaking to her pain.  I stuck around and accepted her abuse for a while BECAUSE I loved her so much and wanted to help her.  But in the end I realized I was the trigger and the crutch and I walked away out of love for myself AND the hope that she would heal.\n\nI understand you're not there yet - not nearly to this extreme.  I'm not necessarily saying you ever will be, either.  But I wish I never had to leave her and that her demons didn't haunt our friendship this way.  She was very amazing and beautiful and had NO IDEA.  I just COINCIDENTALLY happened to have some of the attributes that she subjectively wanted (extroversion, skinny, whatever).  I loved her and it hurt me greatly when I realized she wanted me to go DOWN, not up.  I was always very good to her (to a freakish loyal degree).\n\nI think it's fairly common to experience jealousy of friends.  But maybe you could look at yourself - not in a blame or shame way, but in a self-love way.  If you feel great about yourself, this situation dissolves, and you get to keep an amazing, kind best friend, right?  I'm not saying self-love is easy or quick - but I am saying that's what I'd focus on.  Devote more energy to things you love doing.  Take up hobbies you've always wanted to try.  Journal.  Exercise.  Realize how beautiful and unique YOU are, in any way you can.  I think this will assuage the issue a lot.

{"body": "To anyone wondering why they do this; the HDD is considerably faster than a disk drive. Not only this, but I have the feeling that that 50 gigs sits in the fast(er) segment of the HDD (and all relatively in the same place). If you can give the developer the ability to control WHERE to write the data on the drive, you can significantly improve the speed of reads. For instance, they can pack in such a way that the reader, which has physical latency, doesn't have to swing around back and forth so much. Alternatively the reader doesn't have to stop and go back, but rather can keep swinging in the same direction it was already going to obtain the next segment of data. This increases performance quite quite a bit and helps speeding up asset loading. Since we are dealing with assets that are fairly large in byte size, this is one way of dealing with the latency vs amount of data to be read.\n\nEDIT: Of course the best way is to pack data in order on the drive, but because you have to read data A D G A B D L I A, the often reader has move to read somewhere else and come back.\n\nSource: just covered this in the last Game Optimization lecture.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383193352", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A common cause is a segmentation fault, or 'Access violation' which you might have seen before.\n\nImagine you have a program. You run this program, and it asks your operating system \"Hey man, could you give me a bunch of memory that I can use\" and your OS replies with \"Sure, here is a list of places in the memory that you can use\"\n\nIn simple terms, access violation means it tried to access memory when it wasn't supposed to access it.\n\nNow every part in your memory has an address. We write this address in hexadecimal (meaning we use 0-9 and A B C D E F). One possible address is 01234A\n\nIn most programming languages, you don't really have to care about this memory stuff. Your programming language takes care of that.\n\nIn a language like C and C++, these memory stuff are very important to know. In those languages, you can write \"I want to store the memory address of a certain thing\". Now you could do funny things to it. You could add 1 to the address. If your address is 012345, it would become 012346. If it waa 01234A, it would become 01234B.\n\nHowever, it is very likely that the new address does not belong to your program. If you would say \"Now tell me what is stored at that address\", it would likely give an access violation. \n\nAdding numbers to addresses has legit purposes. These kinds of mistakes can easily occur.\n\nAnother is the null pointer. If you want to store an address and later you are done with it and no longer want to store it, you can set it to store null which is an address with only zeros in it. You can never access this address. If you make a mistake later and forget you stored a null pointer instead of the old address and you try to access it, it will give you an access violation, telling you you tried accessing 0x000000 or similar and you would know right away what happened and you could fix it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383210423", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Second, if we WERE going for some reason in order around the [vowel space](http://www.yorku.ca/earmstro/ipa/vowels.html) with the way you propose, it would be A E I U O, given that /u/ is roughly the same height as /i/ and /o/ is the same backness but a bit lower.\n\nLong story short, there's no substantiable claim for an order (hidden or otherwise) in the Latin or ancestor alphabet because of a lack of primary sources on their creation and the fact that alphabets are arbitrary creations with little connection to language (much in the same way that there's no inherent reason that a dog is called a dog beyond the fact that that's the word it was assigned).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383216081", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was going to lessons years ago, I was shown two scales, C and G major.  I was given the correct finger for the C scale, hands together, over one octave, the C scale RH-only over *two* octaves, and the G scale one-handed over one octave.  I was never shown what a scale actually *is* so for all the other scales, I had to figure out all the transpositions by myself, single-handed over one octave.\n\nI stopped playing for about a year then started again, this time I'm learning my scales hands together over two octaves, correct fingering.  Learning by myself.\n\nI  never actually asked, but I got the impression that if I had asked the two teachers I had (not at the same time) what scales are actually for, that they'd just have said \"you just have to learn them\".  Meanwhile, my guitar teacher was saying what scales are really **for** musically.  He was also making me play them two steps forward, one step back style, which is this melody:\n\n&gt; C D E F | D E F G | E F G A | F G A B | etc\n\nor any variation of that:\n\n&gt; C D E F G | D E F G A | E F G A B | etc\n\nand play them \"in thirds\", which is this melody:\n\n&gt; C E | D F | E G | F A | G B | etc\n\nor \"in sixths\", or whatever you like.  And sing these things while you're playing them.  So, you know, scales for music. (By the way, play a major scale starting on the 8 and descending to the 1, to this rhythm: 4/4 𝅘𝅥 𝅘𝅥𝅮**.**𝅘𝅥𝅯 𝅘𝅥+♫  | 𝅘𝅥 𝅘𝅥 𝅘𝅥+𝅘𝅥 ||)\n\nI'd like to do that now on piano, but I can't figure out good fingerings for, all the scale stuff I can find on the internet for scales is just playing them straight up and down.  For the two steps forward one step back thing, do you literally just use the same fingers each bar, just moving your hand one key to the right each cycle?  It's too simple (and boring) to be the correct way professionals do it.\n\nI'm glad I did go to lessons, because one thing I learned in there turned out to be useful: that thing where you pass your thumb under.  It's genius, and not the sort of thing you'd come up with by yourself.  I used it recently in an actual song to be able to reach the next note after that with my fifth finger.\n\nBut I got the impression that while my teachers were good players, they weren't good teachers (for a logical minded **adult**).  One thing in there that I definitely wasn't learning was sight-reading, because I was working on a piece for the next week, and putting it in my memory after three tries at actually sight-reading it.  This time I'm learning sight reading every day from a guitar book I've got full of forgetable major-scaley made-up tunes, not real songs, and if I don't get them in three tries I go on to the next one.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383245302", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
