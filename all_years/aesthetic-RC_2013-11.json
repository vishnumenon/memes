{"body": "First, it's a good idea to have a strong understanding of [what a mode is](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faqs/guitarlessons#wiki_what_are_modes.3F).\n\nAssuming you've looked through that and understand it, let's look at A Dorian and harmonize it.\n\nThe title tells us that the key is A and the mode is Dorian. The Dorian scale formula is 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, 6, b7. In the key of A Major the notes are A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, so following the Dorian formula we need to flatten the 3 and 7 to make A Dorian. The result is A B C D E F# G.\n\nNow, if we harmonize this into triads (pick a note, miss one out, repeat until you have three notes) we get Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim, G. So a chord progression that stays in A Dorian will use those chords. You can put them in any order but the important thing is that the tonic is A so you want to be resolving to Am.\n\nFor example, you might play Am C Bm D as a repeating sequence, and end the song with an Am. This would have a Dorian flavour because it's using chords harmonized from the A Dorian scale. I can't listen to the linked track but it presumably uses a similar approach. Try all the chords I listed in the previous paragraph and see if you can figure it out by ear.\n\n&gt; Why does the A pentatonic scale sound good the entire song and I don't have to switch scales?\n\nA minor pentatonic contains the notes A C D E G, which are 5 out of the 7 notes in the A Dorian scale. Since the A Dorian contains only notes that are in the chords, it's a close fit for them; since A minor pentatonic contains some of those notes, it's a close fit too. Maybe not very exciting, but a good match.\n\nI hope this helps -- ask if anything's still confusing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383382470", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 27, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a detailed response to a more specific question, but it answers yours pretty thoroughly. It was one of my post from a while ago, so feel free t ask additional questions if needed.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nI'm a professional classical musician so I'll try to tackle this one.\n\n*First of all, you are correct that this originated as a western thing. If you ever listen to traditional Chinese or Cambodian music, you will feel odd mixes of rhythms or a complete lack of meter. Meters stem from \"rules\" that were set into place that were eventually built on by more and more composers until it got to where it is today. Perhaps an easy way of seeing this progression is to listen to some early and late Gregorian chant.\n\n*Second point, humans really really like patterns. If I were to type out 9 dashes, I I I I I I I I I , I guarantee 99% of readers will break up these dashes up into either 3 groups of 3, 4 groups of 2 with an added dash, or some other compounded grouping. Very very rarely will people look at all of those dashes and immediately say \"9\" without doing some kind of grouping. Why is this important to your question? Because of the way we group up musical phrases. Using 4/4 as an example, it's very easy to equal phrases with a final cadence tagged on (one reason I used \"9\" as an example: two phrases of 4, followed by a downbeat chord).\n\n*You could argue that a lot/most of eastern cultures now use common time signatures, and you would be right! This really happened during the late 1800's once America started to influence Japan. The Japanese started to emulate what they saw from the \"rich\" Westerners in every way, from clothing to music (we see this in their marching/military band style music that started during this time period). The second big push of Western ideas occurred right after World War II after America defeated Japan. Contrary to what you would think the reaction would be, Japan saw America as a role model of military superiority and wanted to emulate the Americans as much as possible. America set up military bases throughout Japan and, in those bases, introduced Japan to rock n roll. Through the years, Japan has taken western style rock and made it into their own genre called J-pop, which is why we now see common meters like 4/4 and 3/4 throughout the world now.\n\ntl:dr- It started as a western thing, got integrated into other cultures over the years. Another part is human psychology.\n\nEdit: I'll note that I used Japan as an example, but these ideas have spread all over the east. If you listen to traditional gamelan music you wouldn't find a common beat pattern, because the idea didn't exist in their culture. The same goes for a lot of African nations.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383443039", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Formed in 1981, Tulpa was equal parts Chris Bottomley, John Bottomley and Sev Micron (Mike Severin). They were a progressive rock trio from Toronto, Canada that sounded like a meeting between King Krimson and the Sex Pistols. They were loud, aggressive, opinionated, funny and angry, with a crazy, psychedelic stage show called The Tulpa Circus. It was very multi-media and involved slide projection, dance and strange futuristic cyber clowns.

{"body": "I guess the best is to learn your scales. Start first with the major scale and then the natural minor scale.\n\nSo if you know your notes on a guitar, try playing this:\n**C D E F G A B C**\n\nThis is the C major scale. You will notice a similarity to the A natural minor scale, which is:\n**A B C D E F G A**\n\nSo, as musicians technically say it, the A natural minor scale is the **'relative minor'** to the C major scale. And visa versa -- C major is the **'relative major'** to the A natural minor scale.\n\n\n\nNext, let's talk about *keys*.\nIn each scale, the notes are called degrees, so for C major:\nC is degree 1, D degree 2, E degree 3, etc.\nNow, by combining these notes together we can form chords.\n\nNow when we talk about keys, we are pretty much talking about scales, but scales only indicate the notes and their degrees, whereas keys indicate what chords can be created by the degrees of a scale.\n\nFor instance, the first chord in a C major scale is, appropriately, C major.\nThis chord (written simply as 'C') is made up of three notes of the C major scale. The 1st 3rd and 5th degrees; C E and G.\n\nThe second chord is D minor (Dm) and is made up of the 2nd, 4th and 6th degrees of the C major scale; D F and A.\n\nNow the difference between a basic major or minor chord is the properties of the second note in that chord. If you are playing a C chord, you will notice that the E is 4 frets up the string from the note C. If you play a Dm chord, you will notice that the F is only 3 frets up the string. It's the position of this 2nd note that determines if the chord is major or minor.\n\n\n\n*Read through that info above and if you get that, read this next part.*\n\n\n\nI've introduced you to keys, but I haven't fully explained them. The C major scale has 7 possible (basic) 'triads' that can be created:\n\n**C Dm Em F G Am** and B Diminished or just **Bdim**\n\nNow diminished chords are pretty crazy, but easy to get your head around. They usually sound bizarre to play, but can be used very well in compositions to give the song some character. \n\nThe difference between diminished chords and all other major and minor triads is the third note in the chord. A major or minor chord will have the 3rd note 7 *'frets'* up the string, but let's not call them frets anymore, let's call them *semitones*. A diminished chord has the third note *flattened*, or reduced by a semitone, compared to usual major or minor chords. \n\nThis is the reason why the diminished chord creates a feeling of dissonance, as our brain wants that note to up to that 7th semitone. There's a lot more on the concepts of harmony and dissonance, but that's for another time.\n\n\n\nLet me know how you go with what I've taught you. But remember, take most of what I've said with a grain of salt. This is only a basic understanding of music theory, you'll understand much more by testing stuff by yourself, and by asking other musicians questions.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383553533", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Though the idea is interesting, it is jarring.  It seems that the stanzas are arbitrarily in one scheme or the other, and that creates a lack of flow in the piece.\n\nThe second issue is that your meter in your lines is not consistent.  This is even apparent in the first stanza if you read it out loud.  It seems as if the poem is just fumbling for words, and it continues through the whole piece.\n\nIf you are considering writing something such as this, I would advise you to choose a meter and a rhyme scheme and stick with them throughout the whole piece.  If you want it to be more \"modernized,\" then drop the rhyme scheme altogether and try and make at least a meter of sorts in the lines.\n\nIn essence, love the idea, have issues with the execution.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383657338", "subreddit": "NoSleepOOC", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

I'll use your number/alphabet example, though I'll simplify it a bit.\n\nLet's say each of these is a functional DNA element (gene, regulatory region, etc): \n\na b c d e f\n\nEach of these DNA elements has a role, and mutating any one of them might have disastrous consequences (only very few mutations are actually beneficial). This presents a problem for a species; in order to evolve, it needs to be able to withstand mutations.\n\nAt some point, the messy and chaotic nature of biology means that one of these DNA elements is accidentally duplicated:\n\na b c c d e f\n\nThis is unlikely to have any effect on the organism - having more than one copy of a gene is fairly rarely an issue. If the species is lucky, this mutation will persist in the population and not be lost due to [genetic drift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift). \n\nThis duplication then accrues a mutation.\n\na b c c* d e f\n\nConsequences for the organism? Little to none. The functional copy of c is still there - the extra copy is free to mutate as it pleases, even if those mutations make it non-functional.\n\nOver large amounts of time, though, there's a chance that the extra copy will mutate in a way that it gains a new function:\n\na b c z d e f\n\nPerhaps this new function allows the organism to digest a new food source, making it very advantageous, and it quickly spreads throughout the population. That's evolution - or at least, one of the ways in which evolution can occur.\n\nI don't really like to think of DNA as information...perhaps you could say that *some* DNA is 'information', but that information is only a mutation away from being different information.

What matters is the order that they're in that determines the information they contain. If the order of some of the sequence changes enough it can code for different and/or brand new proteins which may do new and different things in the organism.

{"body": "Not fond of Ms Collins but she is absolutely right and Ms Logie would do herself a favour to actually find out how sexual violation Court cases are tried. \n\nEverything possible is done beforehand to help the complainant from suffering any further trauma.  If the complainants are young persons, they would have been interviewed by a separate department within the police division specially trained in taking formal statements from young persons (although, there's always a minority of the interviewers who can just be plain assholes, though I've only ever personally witnessed one or two out of hundreds and hundreds of interviewers, they're usually extremely respectful to the complainant and well aware of their age and developmental capabilities).\n\nThat is done before the trial, the first thing that happens when the trial begins, before the complainant is even called as a witness is that the Judge rules the Court closed to public under an Act that protects complainants in trials of a sexual nature, so there is no unnecessary public persons in the courtroom while the complainant gives evidence.\n\nThe complainant then sits in a separate room from the actual Court, with a support person and is sworn in via CCTV.  So the complainant is never actually in the Court or anywhere near the accused.  They also cannot see the accused, all they can see are the Judge or counsel who are questioning them at the time.\n\nFrom there the previously mentioned DVD interview is played to the jury and any supplementary questions follow.  The only time it can become stressful is when defence cross-examine the complainant.  They can put a whole range of things to them which could upset them, but this is simply part of a fair trial - the accused is presumed innocent unless the Crown can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.  The defence lawyer will most likely put questions to the complainant that could be to the effect of, \"I put it to you that none of this actually happened, and that in your drunken state you might have just thought it happened.\"  And so on... \n\nThe complainant is allowed as many breaks as needed and is well accommodated for.  \n\nIf Ms Logie has a better way to deal with sensitive cases such as young persons and sexual violation I'd personally love to hear it.  You can't just make a trial out of thin air, you need a complainant to give E V I D E N C E. \n\n/edit:  I in no way condone the Police's outright lie in where they said no one had come forward, and I would hazard a guess the interview was not done by one of the specially trained interviewers for a few reasons; I find it hard to believe they would criticise what she wore on the night and there would be three DVD recordings of said interview.  It sounds like they didn't even get to that point, which is a shame - and if true, then it's absolutely on the police as to why this hasn't come to Court yet, nothing to do with how the Courts themselves run trials of a sexual nature.

The word \"mode\" has many different meanings (that get confused with each other, unfortunately), and one of those meanings is that the kth mode of a scale is that scale beginning on its kth note.  So the second mode of C major would be C major starting on the second note, D, so it's D E F G A B C (D).  This mode is named dorian, and in particular, it's the D dorian mode, since it's the dorian mode starting on D.  But other than the fact that D dorian and C major have the same notes, they don't really have much to do with one another.  So when you mentioned the C dorian scale, C D Eb F G A Bb (C), D dorian has really nothing to do with it.  You know how C major and A (natural) minor have the same notes?  D dorian has those notes as well, as does G mixolydian, F lydian, B locrian, and E phrygian.  They form kind of a family of scales that all use the same notes.

But the more I think about it, the more I feel it makes the concept of using modes more challenging to grasp in the end. You're not the only one confused by this either, so don't get the impression that you're struggling just because you're new to theory. As Robin Williams says to Matt Damon, \"It's not your fault.\" - Good Will Hunting //Rant\n\nThere are really four modes we use most frequently: Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian. The first two are \"minor\" modes because the tonic (i) chord is always minor (because both Dorian and Phrygian have a b3 scale degree). The latter two (Lydian and Mixolydian) are major modes because their tonic chords are always major. So, keep it simple:\n\n* Dorian and Phrygian: Minor modes, easy to borrow from when in Minor\n* Lydian and Mixolydian: Major modes, easy to borrow from when in Major\n\nThe other thing to know is that each of these modes has a tendency pitch OTHER THAN, or IN ADDITION TO (depending on the mode) the 7th scale degree. Remember in basic, classical theory, the 7th scale degree is called the leading tone. It's the pitch that resolves to tonic, taking us home to I or i. So, what are these \"tendency pitches\" of the other modes?\n\n* Dorian (remember, this is a MINOR mode) has **a raised 6th scale degree**, relative to the b6 of the natural minor mode. This makes your subdominant chord IN MINOR a IV instead of a iv, which has a strong impact on the sound of the Dorian mode.\n* Phrygian (remember, a MINOR mode) has a **b2 scale degree**, relative to the natural 2 of the natural minor mode. This makes your ii^o chord in natural minor into a bII chord instead, making it much more useful in minor progressions and compelling as a \"tritone substitution\" of the dominant chord. Don't worry about \"tritone substitution,\" just know that when you hear the term, the Phrygian bII chord in minor is applicable. \n* Lydian (remember, this is a MAJOR mode) uses a **#4 scale degree**, relative to the natural 4th scale degree of the major scale/Ionian Mode. This makes your 'ii' chord in Major a 'II' chord in Lydian. \n* Mixolydian (remember, this is a MAJOR mode) uses a **b7 scale degree**, relative to the natural 7th scale degree (the leading tone) of the major scale/Ionian Mode. This makes your vii^o chord in Major a 'bVII' chord in Mixolydian. \n\nNow, I've highlighted the biggest changes that these tendency tones produce. But really, if you're trucking along and just can't find the right sound for your tune, look and see if you have an opportunity to use a tendency tone in your melody. Just think, *\"This is the 4th scale degree. I could raise this to a* #4, *harmonize with a II, and see what that sounds like.\"* You don't necessarily have to use the II chord, either. You may decide you need a minor chord instead of a major one. The #4 makes the vii^o of the major scale a 'vii' in Lydian, which may prove to be a viable chord for you to use. \n\nJust know what your tendency pitches are for each mode and in what chords those tendency pitches can be found. Then, as you become more affluent with these, you can start mixing in chords from different modes at your leisure. Don't make it so hard. It isn't. It's actually terribly obvious once you commit your tendency pitches of the modes to memory.

Looking at a circle of 5ths as:\n\nC G D A E B Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F (C)\n\nAnd treat it as a list of keys you go from C which has no accidentals to G, which has an F#, then D has F# C#, A has F# C# G#, etc (Notice the sharps are also in perfect 5ths).  You can continue going around the circle of fifths by adding another accidental each time.\n\nSo since each step along the circle only adds one accidental to the key you have a major scale where 6 of the 7 notes are the same, meaning you can change keys to keep your piece interesting but also without jarring tonal shifts.\n\nYou can also build pentatonic scales out of the circle of fifths.  Cmaj Pentatonic is: C D E G A, or you may see it above as C G D A E.

He begins to push his bulk against your tight puckered asshole; your body resists, but only at first.  Soon you relax in his hands and let him inside you.  He pushes himself into you slowly.

{"body": "First of all, never excuse your noobness. Everyone was a noob once, and that's perfectly normal. \n\n\nFor your question, I'll go with \"c\". And your friend is perfectly right : experience is very important to find the \"best\" fingering options. What you should do as a beginner, is take the piece you're playing, try a few fingerings, and find the one that seems the most \"logical\", that requires the smallest amount of movement in your hand (not your fingers, your hand). That won't necessarily be the easiest one : sometimes you'll have a choice to play a note with your pinky, or move your hand to play it with another finger. The first solution is harder (because our pinky is usually weak), but it's better if you don't move your hand needlessly. \n\n\nLet's take a few examples, on your right hand you're trying to play C D E F G. That's simple : start with your thumb, then first finger, second finger, third finger and finish on the G note with your pinky. You can play the whole melody without moving your hand, just your fingers.\n\n\nLet's say you have to play C D E F A now. You can use the same fingering, you'll just have to \"stretch\" your pinky to hit the A note. That might seems harder than just moving your hand, but it will allow you to play without gaps between notes. So once again, the hand doesn't move, the fingers do all the work.\n\n\nNow let's try to play C D E F G A. You don't have enough fingers to play all the notes, so at some point you'll have to move your hand and use a finger on multiple notes. There's two fingering that can be used there : 1 2 3 1 2 3 or 1 2 3 4 1 2 (1 = thumb, 2 = first finger etc...). So what happens there ? You play the first three notes like previous examples. Then for the fourth note (the F), you'll have to move your thumb under your second finger (on the E note). From there, you have your thumb on the F note, and you can play the G and A with the first and second finger. So you play three notes, you move your thumb under your fingers and you play three notes again with the same fingering. The second option is basically the same thing, except you first play four notes before moving your hand. So which is better in this case ? Both are. There's no preferred way to play that, it will all depends on what comes after. \n\n\nThose are very basic examples, but they highlight what you should think about : how many notes can you play without moving your hand ? If you can't play the whole melody without moving your hand, you'll have to move your hand at some point. It's your job to find when you should move your hand so that you have the less amount of movement. \n\n\nDo that very slowly for every melody you'll encounter. Be lazy, try not to move your hand if you don't have to. If you find a similar pattern in two melodies, use the same fingering. Write everything down so that you won't forget which fingers you're supposed to use, and you can come back later to check if a fingering you used there can be used somewhere else. I don't know what style you're trying to play, but buy music sheets. Many of them have fingerings (not complete, just a few hints). And as a conclusion, be patient. It will take sometime for you to be \"fluent\" in finding fingerings, but the more you practice this, the better you'll be.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384090322", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "hey bud im gonna re post something i typed to a fellow summoner hope it helps :D.\n\nEver since the nerfs to him and Muramana which were justifiable he hasn't been picked much cause his poke rating, spike damage and power curve got evened out and this reduced his pick rate significantly one can say. I still believe he is still a great pick just not face roll and auto win like before. He offers his team a shurelias like buff with his range E, solid single target disengage tool on his Melee E, his Q TTS has great base damage and scaling also a noticeable slow and the notorious range E Q poke combo which is just brutally awesome. A concerning issue with jayce is his lack of sustain in his kit compared to resilient top laners like Renekton and Shen, no stuns only medium forms of CC and lastly he's a bit squishy for a top laner considering the generally playstyle of him in season 3 the poke build rather than the all in season 2 tri force off tank build.Mate in the end you play what you feel like! Personally I loved Jayce's theme and concept and I will continue to play him even the inevitable rework down the line.\nIf you do consider pick up jayce here's a few tips that might help you play well!\nStart off in range form 1st use it for generally laning phase.\nI believe people still max Q &gt; 1 in W &gt; Max E &gt; Skip R &gt; Max W etc.\nA neat trick that takes a lot of practice is range Q first and then E rather than the reverse which makes it harder for them to dodge!\nYour range W Hyper charge's buff can be carried over to Melee form what you wanna do is fight in range form Q E W R Melee Q W whack whack whack E :3 it takes time finding out combos but yeah it's a great way to bring down the hammer on them :3.\nMuramana build is still awesome and heavily synergies with Jayce's kit and much needed stats however since the nerfs to tear your power spike will come in later through the game!\nThe season 2 tri force off tank build relies on tri force BT and LW with defensive items and generally going balls deep Melee form rather than being the poker!\nI can't think of much more and my fingers hurt ahahahaha I really hope you take your time learning Jayce he just so awesome and memorable as a champion to play! Good luck summoner!\n\nHere also an added bonus i'll list you the starts for him too :D\nWell let me list you the starts:\nFort Pot and 3 red pots - Generally the aggressive all in start where you know you can either win the lane trading or killing them however caution as you need practice for this start and it lacks wards\nCloth and 5 red pots - this is a counter lane start where you obviously counter ad with a bit of lane sustain good for farming purposes.\nnull magic mantle and 2 pots - not a start i'll recommend but if you are experienced in laning well then go ahead it softens AP damages early.\nCrystaline flask 2 pots OR 1 red and blue with ward - Now this start ive seen pros run mid and not top for some reason. Its viable if you KNOW you will spend alot of money on consumables so flask pays off in the long run saving you money plus it comes with 2 pots of your choice and a ward an awesome start!\nCharm, wards and 3 pots - not a start i'll do but it can work with an early tear but i'll rather have option 1, 2 and the last one below\nDoran's blade - Excellent with lifesteal quints great for a passive laning phase where you dont take risks and get strong through creep scoring.\nLastly i'll include runes and masteries :D\nI like to run a specific jayce set up of 21/9/0 taking both penetrations and cdr instead of attack speed then go down the offensive tree leaving the 2 crit masteries. make sure you get summoners wrath.\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/235613#masteries\ngo to page 4 of my masteries page that is the ideal jayce page :)\nrunes are interchangeable since the meta of tanky sustain top laners running 2 lifesteal quints inconjunction with dorans blade is an excellent way to sustain yourself through laning phase giving you a relatively easy time however sometimes when i do a cheesy strat i run a mixture of ad and armor pen marks which is generally great stats for jayce.\nLastly my fellow summoner incorporate this in your own style of play take what you like and learned today and apply don't copy it completely :) everyone has their own style of playing and remember teamwork and decision making! good luck!\n\nhope it helps mate post any other questions and ill get back to you! \nfrom an avid jayce main\n\nEDIT: dont check the link to my masteries ahahha i deleted them all but you should go 21/9/0 taking both penetrations for the maximum damage capacity", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384170871", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes you're right about them. The other two are a little harder to explain but I'll try. \n\n* Chromatic fills \n\nFirst you need to be clear on the difference between chromatic and diatonic. Chromatic is just all the notes in order (C C# D D# E F F#...). Diatonic is notes from within the key signature. So to add a chromatic fill to what would usually be a diatonic melody you'd be adding notes from outside of the key signature in a stepwise motion. Example - diatonic melody is C E A G diatonic melody with chromatic fill is C E A A# G. The added A# would be played slightly faster to fit the extra note in and not hang around on it too long (creating dissonance). \n\n* Canon \n\nDid you ever sing songs at school in 'a round' where one person would start singing the first line and then the next person would start on the first line when they got to the second line? That's basically canon. So it's the same melody repeated but each voice comes in slightly later than the one before it. To really simplify it the best description I can give is to say imagine four people counting. The first person starting 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 but when they say 2 the second person says 1 and starts counting and then when the second person says 2 the third person says 1. Eventually all four people are counting in a loop and each person is saying a different number between one and four on each beat. \n\n\nI hope those make sense :/ ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384178614", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't know much about Hughes/APS other than what I just looked up, but here's my 2 cents from the lupus side:\n\nPlaquenil isn't a pain killer/NSAID, so it won't help you with the headaches. Plaquenil is actually an anti-malarial whose side affect was helping auto-immune arthritis - and now the drug doesn't work on malaria so much, but it still works great on arthritis, so there we are. What plaquenil excels at is keeping your immune system calm so that it doesn't attack your joints. The thing is, the more your immune system attacks your joints, the more it wants to attack your joints, and it's a positive feed back loop. The plaquinil just kinda sings a lullaby, to keep it calmed down. \n\nThe thing with pain killers/NSAIDs/steroids and auto-immune diseases is this: generally we don't take them for pain, we take them to suppress our immune system. But they are bad for our GI tract and they are literally murder for our liver. Murder. You *must* be careful of what pain medication you are taking, because mixing and matching can cause *real* bad side effects. Therefore I will not recommend any pain meds because you need to take a pen and paper with you to your doctor and get them to S P E L L out you what you can and cannot take and when. You need to be on pain meds for your HS, so maybe talking to your doctor can kill 2 birds with 1 stone - maybe they can give you a NSAID that will help your headaches and your immune system, like meloxicam or naproxin or something. \n\n**You need to drink water.** I fucking hate drinking water. I do. Loath it. If I drink it cold, I get cold, if I drink it at room temperature, its just bad, if its hot it hurts my teeth. And I can't count on myself to sip on it all day long long like a good girl. So this is what I do: I have [2 nalgene bottles](http://www.amazon.com/Nalgene-Wide-Mouth-Bottle-Bloom/dp/B004H85EI4/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384225196&amp;sr=8-16&amp;keywords=nalgene), one on my counter at home, one at work. In the morning, first thing, I fill up the one on my counter and drink half of it. 1/4 of my daily water done. Then at work, first thing I do is fill up my other nalgene. Ever time I get up, I pick it up, and take a couple of big swallows. No sipping. I hate water, I gulp, get it out of the way. The last thing I do at work is empty the damn thing, so its best if I've drank a bunch throughout the day. Get home, make dinner, drink the other half of my nalgene before I eat. 2 liters of water, done. Also, now I'm not as hungry cuz my belly is full of water. **You need to drink water.** Headache, low blood pressure, lethargy - all caused by lack of water. You cells need water to work, and also, without water, your skin looks like crap, and who wants that? :)\n\nEnd of lecture! Sorry about that. It sucks, having to do all these things, but you will feel lots better drinking water, and hopefully your rheumy will be able to help you out. Make sure to sit down and write down all the meds you are taking, and the dose. Then write down all your questions and your concerns (like headache meds and pain meds in general). Be prepared! They can't remember to tell you everything, and you have to be bold and brave and be your own advocate. If you can, bring somebody along with you, they'll help to remember everything.

I just think the words when I read them, I'm not sure how one can comprehend something without thinking it.\n\nHere's how you can tell the difference. In order to break the habit of reading aloud internally, try saying internally \" a e i o u \" over and over while reading a passage. Or count \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\" in your head, over and over, while reading a passage. Sounds difficult but it's surprisingly easy to do.\n\nThis is generally the first step in learning to \"speed\" read, or to improve your reading speeds. Once you break the need to internally vocalize, your speed takes off like a rocket. If you get this quickly, try reading 2 words at a time, instead of 1 word at a time. Or 4 word phrases at a time, so you scan through the passage reading 4 work blocks at once. You can tear through a textbook very quickly with just these two tricks (and a highlighter for good measure).\n\nAlthough, I personally go back and read aloud (actually aloud) or internally some passages in books that really grab me, or I want to spend more time with :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384286555", "subreddit": "web_design", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, you may hear a lot of bad reviews and a few of good reviews about this game, but let me assure you...this game is fucking amazing.\n\nThe new Dante, IS the same Dante, regardless of how people react. Its basically a new origin story similar to how the new Tomb Raider is. Its Dante at heart, with some changes. The same basic formula of Dante is there, with a new face. He's still a smart ass, he's still a badass. He's just young and fresh. Sure the hair is different...but its just hair...\n\nThis game is an entirely new universe, its not the same world as the other DMC games. Take it for what it is and not for how the previous games are. Do not judge it based on its predecessors.\n\nThe combat is fantastic. It may not be as hard to pull off combos like it was in the other games, but that makes the combat more fluid. There are 5 types of melee weapons you get in the game, which you can easily switch to in combat with the D-pad &amp; L &amp; R buttons. You also get 3 types of guns---including Ebony and Ivory. The guns aren't exactly the best thing, but each has their use for keeping up your combos/the style meter. Each melee weapon has its own use as well, 2 for crowd control, 2 for single target heavy attacks. \n\nEvery weapon generally has 4 types of attacks. the X X hold X X type and the X X X X type. As well as a hold X attack and a Forward X attack. These combos are completed in the same process in air and on land. \n\nEnemies you encounter vary from easy trash mobs to big bads where you have to hit their weak spot. As you play you learn what weapons are best at defeating certain enemies. \n\nThe controls are perfect, you can also edit the controls to better suit your play style. (like you can set basic attack to X instead of Y and etc.)\n\nThe cutscenes are great. The art is great...everything about this game is just awesome. \n\nI think I may be a bit biased....because I think this game has become my favorite game of all time....I've never played another game this much, nor have I gone back to a game over and over just to kill things. \n\nI have it on PS3 as well as PC (it looks WAY better on PC)....I've beaten it at least 8 times, I've finished it on every difficulty. And the DLC for Dante's Brother Virgil adds a completely new take on the combat. There's also a free DLC for a timed based tower climbing mode where you defeat wave after wave of enemy and defeat bosses every so many waves. \n\nThe game may not be perfect....and a lot of people complain about the combat being too easy (which it isn't at all unless you play on normal or easy mode)...also the lack of an enemy lock on system (which gets annoying but is not that big of a deal)\n\nRegardless, its definitely worth a buy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384293797", "subreddit": "ShouldIbuythisgame", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, in any Major key you have the following pattern of chords:\n\nI ii iii IV V vi vii^o\n\nIn any Minor key, this pattern reverts two sonorities back (to vi in Major), giving us:\n\ni ii^o III iv v VI VII\n\nIn traditional harmony, the V chord is pretty important to harmonizing the key. You'll notice that the V chord in what we call \"natural minor\" is 'v'. So, we can raise the third of that chord (the 7th scale degree of the minor scale) to revert back to our 'V' chord. Playing a scale over this chord would give us the \"harmonic minor\" scale, or in C Minor:\n\n     Natural Minor:  C D Eb F G Ab Bb C \n     Harmonic Minor: C D Eb F G Ab B  C\n\nYou'll notice that the movement from Ab to B natural is pretty big compared to our other steps of the scale. Many composers would avoid this by using a \"melodic minor\" scale over chords that used the raised 7th scale degree, reverting the 6th scale degree back to major as well (or for our purposes of C Minor, reverting the Ab back to A Natural):\n\n     Melodic Minor:  C D Eb F G A B C\n\nThis gives us the option of shifting in and out of awkward voice-leading by using the pitches of the natural minor scale, reverting our 7th scale degree back to what it would be in major, or reverting both the 6th and 7th scale degrees back to major depending on our harmonic preference of retaining the V sonority as dominant. \n\nThe Tonic - Subdominant - Dominant system is virtually the same for Major and Minor. You can pretty much count on that functionality working for you in constructing minor chord progressions just as it does for major ones. \n\nAlso, \"chording\" is properly referenced as \"harmonizing\" in formal theory, just so you are aware. Sounds like the book uses some different language than we use in formal theory, but that's not a terribly big deal unless you really need a specific answer to a specific question. \n\nHope this helps.

{"body": "Fantastic answers? Downvote me for going against the trend,  but I found this analogy to be completely unfair and wrong to both sciences and religions. \n\n\nIn the analogy, the whole universe is already contained under 7 panels the moment he brought it up. He knows its size, he assume it's finite, and he believe that it's fully understandable with logic. And then,  he start uncovering the panel to reveal an already known gradient that goes from black to white.\n\nBut is it really how sciences has progressed? Hell no.  For one, interpolation is already used to predict data. Scientists would have no issue making the claims necessary to fill the gap, and it would be a widely accepted theory except by a few nutjobs who represent only but a subcategory of theists. An example of this would be evolution theory, which explain the many \"shades\" we see in the animal kingdom, even if some are still unobserved. It's also, I'm pretty certain, where the authors got his simplistic idea from, and why everyone here accept this analogy so readily.\n\nHowever, evolution has nothing to do with sciences being unable to know 100% of the universe.  When this idea is brought up, it's to address the concept of the extreme. Where does it begin? where does it end? Sciences won't ever tell you that, because it can't fundamentally makes claim about these things. Your model are always going to be based on your furthest observations, and that will be the foundation of your theory, not the \"beginning of everything\". \n\n**My analogy** \n\nIf instead of 7 panels, he simply started by uncovering one.  Under that panel there was a big  N(ewton), and then he found a M(axwell) to its right, and a L(avoisier) to the left. However, the world is still not fully explored as there is a E(instein) card to the right, and a H(einseberg) to the far left. And then he keep going and going, but everytime he manage to flip one,  he only find that there is another right after.   He tries to make sense of that series [..] H L N M E [...], but extrapolating doesn't help him in any way, because the next card always seem completely random and unexpected. \n\nThat's what sciences is like, and sciences can't tell if our world is finite or not, and even if it was, it wouldn't be able to say how it all begin. The question is not as simple as some interpolation of a shade of gray. \n\n\n\nOn top of this, the analogy is told in a way that ridiculed that \"religious character\". It appeal to the bias of the reader, rather than try to make a fair representation of the situation. It's possible to read beyond that, but anyone who attempts to win its argument like this lose some respect in my opinion.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384354014", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Data from the National Violence Against \nWomen Survey demonstrate the consequences of these \nmyths. In the nationally-representative study, only 32.1% \nof reported rapes by intimate partners were prosecuted, \ncompared to 44.4% of reported \nrapes by non-intimates (7). \nConviction rates for \nintimate rapists were also \nsignificantly lower \n(36.4% to 61.9% of \np r o s e c u t e d c a s e s ) , \nsuggesting that prosecutors' \nreliance on rape myths when \nconsidering prosecution may be at \nleast partially based on experiences in trying real cases \n(7) . Likewise, interviews with rape survivors also show \nthat white victims with stranger offenders fitting a \"classic \nrape case\" profile are most likely to have their cases \nprosecuted, and yet fewer than half of these offenders \nwere convicted at trial (4).\n\nEdit: another relevant quote:\n&gt;Some survivors report that the detailed investigation by \nlaw enforcement can make them feel further violated and \nnot believed, a situation researchers have termed the \n\"second rape\" or \"secondary victimization\" (15, 16, 17). \nStudies surveying rape survivors found that in the past \npolice have doubted women's stories, were unsupportive \nor threatened to charge the women with crimes for not \ncooperating, or asked intrusive questions about the \nwoman's sexual history or how they were dressed (18, 19, \n20)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384441181", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This one requires me to give away my first name. Worth it.\n\nThe summer before Freshman year of college, I had been Facebooking a few guys who joined the Class of 20** Facebook group, looking for chill people I could potentially room with. I eventually began talking to a guy named Chad, and we more or less hit it off. It seemed like we had a lot of the same interests, and we messaged back and forth for a few weeks. Eventually, I noticed that, if I didn't respond within 5-10 minutes, he would message me more and more. It got to the point where I stopped messaging him back altogether because it was getting to be a little much. One day, a few weeks before I would move into the dorms, I got a text from him- I hadn't given him my phone number. Turns out he had messaged some friends of mine saying that we were already roommates, and he needed my phone number for an emergency.\n\nThat was the last straw for me. I ended up telling him I was gonna live with a friend of mine from high school (a lie), and that we could still be friends. He did not respond. So, the weeks went by, and I moved down to my University. It's about a 3.5 hour drive from my hometown, and on the way, I got a text from Chad. It said: \"Hey man. I'm picking up our key to our room. Where do you want to meet?\" *I freaked the fuck out* and texted the guy I was actually rooming with, and he said we were still roommates. So, confused, I texted Chad back reminding him I had another roommate. He flipped shit. He acted like the Office of Resident Life told him we were rooming, so I had to call them on the way to school. Turns out, he had called them weeks ago telling them we wanted to officially be roommates- this was *after* I told him I found another roommate.\n\nSo I got to school, got my *actual* key, met up with my *actual* roommate and moved in. That night, after I was all moved in, Chad Facebook messaged me telling me how upset he was that we weren't rooming- but not to worry because he lived 4 floors below me (I was on the 11th floor). I freaked out, and told my roommate about the fiasco. So, we decided to do some stalking of our own. We went into his photo albums on FB, and saw some weird shit...\n\nHe had posted an entire album of a gutted bobcat. Intestines hanging out, gunshot wounds, blood everywhere. There were like 9 pictures of this thing. Not just your average hunting pics. These looked like a serial killer's trophy pics. He had another album of deer who were skinned, maimed, and a lengthy photo comment that talked about how \"Creatures who stand in my way get shot. Hunting is my stress reliever. Best be glad there's no one pissing me off in the student body.\"\n\nSo, naturally, I shit myself. But those albums were from years before, so I let it go. Chad kept messaging me, and I kept ignoring him, hoping he would stop. About 2-3 weeks into school, he posted a status that sent chills in my spine. \n\nIt said: \"Alas, Never Does REVENGE Easily Wait.\" - I will never forget that status update. Look at the first letters of each word. A N D R E W. My name is Andrew. (SIDE NOTE: He also had another status that included that same quote, and also another one that spelled out my LAST NAME- which, unfortunately, I won't give away on here. It also mentioned revenge.)\n\nSo, I promptly emailed the Dean telling him I felt unsafe, and that this student was making threats on Facebook to me, stalking me, and posed a threat to the student body. I took screenshots of the bobcat/deer pictures with captions (I still have them, message me if you wanna see), and sent those to the Dean as well. I basically ordered a restraining order.\n\nChad sent me one last message, telling me he never wanted to freak me out- and that the status he wrote was merely a reminder to message me later that day- even thought I hadn't responded in weeks... I have seen him occasionally since then, and get freaked out every time.\n\n\n--- *TL;DR* -  I had a stalker my Freshman year who threatened my life, more or less, because I didn't want to live with him.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384471108", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't think it's all in the mind but I feel it is very damned close, like Einstein said \"Genius is 1% talent and 99% very hard work..\". I think the same maxim can be applied to our marital relationships and our sexual lives. Basically those that say they are \"too tired\" or X Y Z I CANNOT HAVE SEX WHO CARES MEH are those that excpect a surge of inspiration in their loins to make them want to ravish someone- and when they don't feel that ever or only mildly they assume there is zero pay off for actually having sex with their spouses or SO's. (this of course barring actual health related LL's or you know occasionally a cigar is a cigar and we might really be tired but I'm talking of the consistent pattern of denial LL's commit to). \n\n\n\nI identify as a HL woman. This not only means, most likely, I'm probably far hornier more often than a lot of other people (including men obviously) but that doesn't mean I don't have times and or experiences that make the idea of having sex at the moment slightly unpalatable or not what I'm wanting right now. But I find rather than making excuses, if my husband gives me the cues that he wants sex I'M ON IT. Not entirely because I'm a desperate housewife but because for me I want to give him a positive experience connected with his own desire- he wants me and I will give him me: all of me and I will be enthusiastic and please him and myself. Essentially I better walk the walk if I'm going to bemoan our frequency I should and do make it a priority to say *yes*. I think that a lot of times it's all about **attitude**. Most of the LL women I read about around here- if they just readjusted their heads they would be great sexual partners..but I sense for the most part they just don't give a shit.

{"body": "Others are right that it depends on context, but it also depends on the *genre* of music in question. In Bach, for example, there is no such thing as a major 6th chord, and you frequently deal with inverted chords, so C E G A would always be Am7 in first inversion rather than C6. But in most jazz, there's almost always a bassist who is always playing (or implying) the roots of chords, regardless of the inversions in the other higher instruments, so if you hear A C E G in the piano with a C in the bass, you'll be inclined to hear that as C6, rather than Am7.\n\nEvery genre has its own standards, its own vocabulary, its own mode(s) of listening.

{"body": "Good question.\n\nFirst of all, the notes of a first-inversion Am chord don't have an order.  The C is in the bass, but you can put as many A's, C's, and E's in any order above it.  C E A C E A C is a big, thick Am in first inversion.  C A E E is a smaller and sparser one, using an idiomatic octave between the upper two voices.\n\nBut on to the question, how do you differentiate between a first inversion minor chord and a 6 chord?  Well, the first thing to notice is that they're the same chord.  F# and Gb are different spellings of the same note, and one is right and the other is wrong -- a D major chord has an F#, certainly not a Gb -- but Am7/C and C6 are actually the same chord.  The difference is which note you *feel* is the root.  Do you feel like the A is the the root or the C?  If you play G9 - C6, the C is probably the root, and in the case of a C6, the 6th, the A, is kind of extraneous.  It's there to make the chord more interesting, but it's not important to the harmony.  On the other hand, in a progression like Am7/C - D7/C - G/B makes the Am7/C feel more like an A chord than a C chord.  But even then it could go both ways.  The first inversion minor chord (whether a triad or m7) is just ambiguous like that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384539042", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Short answer - there is a set of chords one can build on a scale - skipping every other note - eg from C scale. C D E F G A B C you can build CEG - C major chord/triad, DFA - D minor chord /triad etc. So there is a set of chords that is associated with each scale. And vice versa the are scales associated with each chord. So when you have a tune ie chords (harmony) and melody you can analyze it and figure out a set (or sometimes sets) of scales one can use to improvise a solo that will sound against the chords. The connection is usually made this way. As improviser you are given set of chords and melody and ask to produce a solo. And there are rules to do that that. But they require basic knowledge of theory to comprehend. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384651893", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah, came over to express a similar confusion. For anyone who is interested, here's a piece from AVFM extolling the virtues of catcalling: \n\n&gt;Women continue to expect all the benefits of so-called “benevolent” sexism, while accepting none of the downsides. They continue to demand all the privileges of the feminine, while refusing the costs. They accept all the rights, and reject all responsibilities.\n\n&gt;Well, wake up, bitches. You can’t have it both ways. If you are going to demand the right to shove your tits into push-up bras and unbutton your shirt to the waist and go sashaying down the street trying your best to attract high status men (however you define that), all the while expecting him to be the pursuer, then guess what?\n\n&gt;You’re gonna get some blowback. Some of it will come in the form of men mocking your efforts, and some will come from men who understand they are expected to initiate.\n\n&gt;You know what you call a woman who thinks the entire fucking world should revolve around what she wants? Who thinks she is the star of her own universe? Who has a grandiose, inflated sense of her own self-worth? Who is convinced only her desires and her needs and her wants have any currency?\n\n&gt;N A R C I S S I S T\n\n&gt; There is a really easy way to deal with “street harassment” ladies.

{"body": "The circuit you want is a [full adder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_adder#Full_adder). It will add two bits, plus a carry in, and generate the output bit plus a carry out bit.  If you put a bunch of these in parallel, you can add binary numbers that are as long as you like. The more bits you add, the more time it takes because you need time for the carry out of the lower bits to move up to the next bit stage.  But it is still very fast.  The largest number of gates in a stage that a signal has to go through is 3, so the time it takes will be D x N x 3, where D is the Delay through one gate and N is the number of bits you are adding. These days, D should be measured in picoseconds, so even a 32 or 64 bit addition should take nanoseconds.  \n  \nThe symbols in the \"full-adder logic diagram\" on that Wikipedia page are basic logic elements, or \"gates\". The two on top are eXclusive OR gates (XOR), the other two that are the same are AND gates, and the one furthest right is an OR gate.  Each will be made up of just a few transistors.  Not used in this circuit the other common logic gates, the NotAND gate, the NotOR gate and the inverter (NOT).  \n  \nThose gates (AND,OR,NAND,NOR,XOR,NOT) make up most of the \"combinational\" logic in a processor. In addition, there are \"latches\" and \"flip-flops\" which not only implement logic, but also will retain their state until given a clock signal.  Multiplexers (MUXs) allow the selection between multiple inputs.  Memory elements (such as Static RAM) and registers make up the majority of the rest of the circuits used besides the ones I just named.  \n  \nThose basic circuits are used to do all of the things a microprocessor does.  Addition is one specialized thing; there are various other logical functions that must be done. A processor must fetch instructions, decode them, send them to the right part of the chip for execution, store results, etc.  Much of this is accomplished by making \"state machines\" out of logic gates and latches/flip-flops and registers.

{"body": "There are some good responses, but the truth is that there are many ways to do it.  The key to understanding how this happens is understanding that the most foundational part of music is V--&gt;I harmonic motion (so G chord--&gt;C chord or B chord--&gt;E chord).  As long as the first of the two is a major chord and built off the fifth note of the scale of the following chord (G is the fifth note in a C scale, B is the fifth note in an E scale), this progression has the effect of making you feel like you're in the \"key\" of the second of the two chords.  This can be used not only to go from minor to major but from any key to nearly any other key.  But, since you asked minor to major, we'll go there.\n\nFirst, lets look at what happens if you build a chord off of each note in a minor scale.  Lets take E minor for the sake of simplicity.  M means Major, m means minor, and d means diminished (don't worry if you don't know what this means).\n\nEm F#d  GM  Am    BM (or Bm)  CM  DM  Em\n\n\nAs you can see, if you're trying to move to a major key, G (III), C (VI), and D (VII)--the numerals just represent which note in the scale the chord is built off of--would be your best bets. Like we said at the beginning, the easiest way to make you \"feel\" like you're in a new key is to play the V--the major chord built off the fifth note in the new key's scale.  That one is easy enough to figure out.\n\nIf we want to move to C (VI), we'll play C D E F **G** &lt;-- G (III) to C (VI)\n\nIf we want to move to D (VII), we'll play D E F# G **A** &lt;-- A (IV) to D (VII)\n\nIf we want to move to G (III), we'll play G A B C **D** &lt;-- D (VII) to G\n (III)\n\nAfter you've established that, you can just start playing as if you were in that key.  The most seamless one, of course, will be the move to III (G) since the G major scale and the e minor scale share all the notes.  I personally like the sound of moving to the VII (D).  A nice progression, if you're playing around in a minor key, is i--&gt;iv--&gt;v (minor)--&gt;i--&gt;IV (major)--&gt;VII...and voila, you're in the new key. Play around with it, there are lots of fun ways to change keys when you understand the pour of the V--&gt;I relationship.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384740206", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Just Intonation pretends to be that, but some things we take for granted in 12-TET (ii6 - V7 - I) are impossible in just intonation without breaking some stuff.  Different systems of tonality are different possibilities for making music first and foremost, rather than approximations to something else.  17-TET is in fact a *bad* approximation, but insofar as it is an approximation, we have to keep its notes in the correct order rather than the order that looks nicer on the staff.  The fact is that this order is mandated by the assumptions we make (not just me) about preserving relationships in Western music.  If I were to write music in 17-TET, I'd write C Ct Dd D, where t is half-sharp and d is half-flat.  Ct and Db would be enharmonic, as would D# and Ed; Ed is a neutral third that sounds much better in a triad than E or Eb in 17-TET.\n\nThe assumptions I started with, actually, are that the distance between C and D is a whole step and that the distance between B and C is a diatonic half step.  The distance between C# and D is also a diatonic half step (same scale degrees in D major are B and C are in C major, for example), so the distance between C and C# has to be a whole step minus a diatonic half step, which is called a chromatic half step.  The assumptions are that these distances are positive (or 0).  So I'm making the assumption that the notes C D E F G A B C are in order and that E - F and B - C are smaller intervals than C - D, D - E, F - G, G - A, A - B.  On those assumptions, a diatonic notation for 17-TET is possible.  If I also add that the chromatic half step has to be smaller than (or equal to) the diatonic half step, then 17-TET is no longer possible (but 19-TET is still good).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384805637", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That \"method\" its not completly wrong, but its confusing and doesnt help to think the topic in a more... global way.\n\nI think its better to think transposition to the same key, not to the relative minor. I think the relative minor confuses people.\n\nTo me its better to think it like this.\n\nIn major, we have (as degrees, not intervals), the Root, a P5, P4 (perfect fifh and fourth), 2M, 3M, 6M, 7M (major seccond, major third and major sixth).\n\nSo, we have this notes: R, 2M, 3M, P4, P5, M6, M7 --&gt; c d e f g a b\n\nThe firts \"step\" to the \"minor world\" would be to flat the third! Just that. Theres a hole new scale from there (melodic minor). R, 2M, **3m**, P4, P5, M6, M7\n\nc, d, **e flat**, f, g, a, b\n\nDepending of the melodie you are working on (and its harmony) you could just try to make it minor just flattening the third. In Cmajor, its the \"e\". Make it e flat, so you would have a 3m (minor third) instead of a 3M (major third). Remember I'm talking about DEGREES, and relative to the KEY. (also you can talk about degrees relative to each chord in the harmony).\n\nIt would sound minor. But usually, minor melodies also demand its 6M flat. So do it. Flat the sixth --&gt; a becomes a flat.\n\nR, 2M, 3m, P4, P5, **m6**, M7\n\nc, d, e flat, f, g, **a flat**, b\n\nSo, just working in C and flattening two notes, you have a huge new world.\n\nMinor its more difficult, as you have to make changes according to what sonoritie do you look for (just major/minor, or modal).\n\nThinking in this terms its really easy... its also very easy to help you improvise. \"Relative\" transportation leads to confused people.\n\nWhat you were doing there was doing two transpositions at once. You transposed it to A, then you choose the notes that would make it to sound in A minor, that just happends to be the ones that correspond to Cmajor.\n\nDon't take me wrong, the relationship between relative major/minor keys exist. But its something I would say more symbiotic. What you were doing here, just making a melodie minor, had more to do with working in a not-relative way.\n\nThe same confusing arise with people trying to learn the modes. The \"easy\" explation about the relative modes just confuses them and don't let them use it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384813441", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I would start with the single note intervals for sure.  Really, chords tend to stick to basic major, minor, and 7th's and progressions are mostly based around scales.\n\nFor instance, as I mentioned above, a C to a G note is a perfect fifth interval, but the C chord to the G chord is also a perfect fifth.  Instead of playing individual notes, you play multiple notes together.\n\nTo make it easy, chords are made up of of three or more notes.  Those notes come from the scale the song is based on.  If you determine a song is in C major (to simplify things), the notes are:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nChords will generally be constructed from that scale.  A major chord consists of the intervals 1-3-5 so a C Major would be the notes C-E-G (a C minor cord would be 1-3b-5, or C Eb G).\n\nThe major scale follows a pattern (W=Whole steps, two intervals and H=Half Step, one interval):\n\nW-W-H-W-W-W-H\n\nIn the C Major Scale:\n\nFrom C to D is two steps (C, C#, D).  From D to E is another two steps (D, D#, E), but from E to F is a half step (E, F).  There is no E#/Fb or B#/Cb.\n\nThat's pretty much all there is to the major scale.  Now you can apply that to other notes...  Here are the notes in the A Major scale:\n\nA B C# D E F# G#\n\nA to B is two steps (A, A#, B).  B to C# is two steps (B, C, C#) but C# to D is one step (C#, D).\n\nThe D Major scale is the same thing:\n\nD E F# G A B C#\n\nThe follow a similar pattern, but instead of thinking about them in terms of Whole steps and Half steps, it gets easier to think of them in numerical intervals.  This gets a bit more intense and I don't have time to explain it fully here, but the major scale is just seven notes with no flats or sharps:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nYou then manipulate the notes in different intervals to fit so the notes are the same as the major interval.  So in C Major:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nThe A is in the sixth place, which is generally referred to as the \"Minor scale\" and is otherwise known as the Aeolian interval.  You need to manipulate the notes in this interval to fit the notes of the C Major scale.  You'll remember that the A Major scale had a C#, F# and a G#, but there are not sharps in the C major scale.  Therefore you need to flat those notes:\n\n1 2 3b 4 5 6b 7b\n\nA B C  D E F  G\n\nEach mode of the scale will have specific notes that will be flatted in order to match the notes of the original major scale.  If the 3rd interval is flatted, it's considered a \"minor\" scale.  If it's not, it's considered a \"major\" scale.\n\nIn our example, if the song is in C Major the chords you could build a super basic chord progression like this:\n\nC, F, Am, C\n\nC, F, G, C\n\nRight now, I would definitely just plan on learning the single note intervals and applying this chord stuff at a later date.

Maybe a new rendering and physics to apply to the first .25 or .5 k around the city to give us artistic drawing tools and road capabilities around each city to give us more creative ways to work with the limitations we do have.\n\nthere are a ton of things we could explore and try.\n\nclusters are definitely the key to mega cities and better R C I U G S separated segregated cities if it can be done right.\n\nI mean if a cluster was really what creates a SINGLE mega city or sprawl then we could really vision a new world of creativity.\n\nWe need more DLC bot Maxis and UGC but its just starting.\n\nSo much could be done if QA and Production managers are willing to think outside the box and let the developers / coders really push the envelope and make it so DLC's maybe are a key to using more advanced yet riskier features so they can say USE at your own risk or something or USE with acceptance of XXX factors.\n\nI'm so trying to come up with so many ideas to see if any of them help or stick to the wall at this point.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384879018", "subreddit": "SimCity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sure, I understand the issues you're talking about. Just understand that transposition isn't always dictated by harmony either. Let me provide a real-world example of what I mean, because I recently performed an operation like this that is, for all intents and purposes, a \"transformation through transposition.\"\n\nI have a theme in D Minor. It's essentially this order of pitches...\n\n     D_ A____ E F G___ C___ C D E E___ F___ Bb A G___\n\nIt would take me some time to lay out the chords, but just let it be understood that I want to take this idea and put it in a different context. In this case, I'm going to transpose it to Bb Dorian, or the key of Ab Major starting on Bb. So, one more time, the order of my pitches are...\n\n     D A E F G C C D E E F Bb A G\n     1 5 2 3 4 7 7 1 2 2 3 6  5 4\n\nWhen I transform by transposition, I'm not necessarily copying the harmony as well. In fact, my harmonic progression will be determined after my melody has been transformed to Bb Dorian:\n\n     Bb F C Db Eb Ab Ab Bb C C Db G F Eb\n     1  5 2 3  4  7  7  1  2 2 3  6 5 4\n\nNotice, a literal transposition would make the G a Gb, lowering the 6th. But it's nice to have that 6th raised and to change my progression ever so slightly to accommodate that change instead of letting a strict transposition process prohibit that difference. As long as my goal is to transform my idea through the process of transposition, this process is perfectly fine. This IS a type of transposition, a diatonic process rather than a chromatic process. \n\nIf I used a chromatic process to do what I just did, it would require me to use an inconsistent interval when transposing the 6th scale degree of the piece to accommodate the dorian sound. It could be done, of course. It's a perfectly valid approach as well. But if I'm looking at the degree of simplicity in making the transposition happen, the diatonic process achieves the same goal in fewer steps. The chords need not remain constant for a transposition to be a transposition.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384887887", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Mostly Asian food, though (but I definitely put it on Indian/Ethiopian a lot of the time...). Last night I made a burrito with an Asian fusion, terriyaki stir fry veggies, forbidden rice, sliced avocados, bean sprouts topped with siriacha all rolled into a whole wheat tortilla! A while ago I made a pizza with a curry sauce, seared tofu, topped with tomatoes and basil and cashew cheese with siriacha drizzled on top after it came out of the oven.\n\nI know, I'm passionate as fuck about siriacha.

Well that makes sense given that Twitch's definition of \"harassment\" is apparently \"criticizing an admin for making a global Twitch of their boyfriend's underage fursona\".\n\n&gt;Not every broadcaster participating in the coordinated petition was also encouraging harassment.\n\nYou mean not *any* broadcaster. The word you're looking for is \"any\".\n\n&gt;We're still sorting through this mess, and the important takeaway is there's not just two sides.\n\nIt would be easier to sort through the mess if the Twitch staff wasn't hard at work suppressing any and all discussions on the matter. The moderating in /r/gaming and /r/Twitch has been fishy at best and there is evidence of Twitch contacting the mods. What kind of conclusion are people supposed to draw from that? The actions of Twitch and [blatantly unprofessional conduct](http://i.imgur.com/G1RMsbo.png) seem to suggest that there's only one side that they'd like to listen to and that's the side that protects their precious staff.\n\nAny professional business would actually take a look at one of their staff if customers have complained about their abuse of power. The fact that Twitch has decided to do the exact opposite and ignore their customers, banning several popular accounts, censor the criticism, victimize their employee, and protect him at all costs is indicative of how unprofessionally Twitch is being run.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385053559", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

These fighters had a number of technical solutions that could not be considered innovative by the middle and the end 1930s, like mixed wood and metal construction with fabric covered elements, non-retractable landing gear and an open cockpit. These features directly impacted the aircraft’s speed, but gave the I-15 its biggest advantage — outstanding manoeuvrability. Moreover, the fighter’s considerable armament (4x7.62 caliber machine guns) and good climb rate allowed its use as a high-altitude interceptor.\n\n&gt;The I-15’s contemporary a Japanese fighter the Ki-10 had been created under the direction of Kawasaki’s engineer and aeronautical designer Takeo Doi. The model was the last biplane adopted byt the Japanese Army and possessed relatively good speed (for a plane with fixed landing gear) and high manoeuvrability. However its armament was inadequate by all standards, consisting of just two 7.7mm machine guns.\n\n&gt;In 1939 the Japanese and Soviet biplanes faced each other in the battles over the Mongolian river of Khalkhin Gol (the events also known as the Nomonhan Incident). The undeclared war broke out between the USSR, Mongolia, the Japanese Empire and its puppet state of Manchukuo. It was fought from May till September of 1939 and ended up in a Japanese army defeat. By that time both the Polikarpov I-15 (in its ‘bis’ modification) and the Kawasaki Ki-10 II were near obsolete and suffered heavy losses from modern monoplanes like Ki-27 and I-16.  \n\nEnd News Item\n\n---\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385131089", "subreddit": "Warthunder", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;**General Tips for speed**  \n\n* Don't use a period for `echo.`, use a colon, semicolon or an open parenthesis (there are more).  \n* Avoid `call`s and pipes, because of the overhead they carry.  \n* If you need to `call` or `goto` a subroutine a lot, put it near the top of the file and `goto` over it at the begining.  \n  \n&gt;**Specific Points**  \n  \nLine 2: You could add `EnableExtensions` too, just in case it's disabled in the registry.  \n  \nLine 4: Your use of `exit /b` over `exit` makes it seem as though you intend for this program to work from the command line. If so, then use `pushd` instead of `cd /d`, and then whenever you intend the program to terminate, use popd and endlocal.  \n  \nLines 18, 26, 40, : Your usage of `delims=` is redundant, because `tokens=*` stops all delimiting from that token onwards.  \n  \nLines 28 and 29. \nYou might be able to replace those lines with  \n&gt;`set str=!str:~18,-19!`  \n\nIf and only if the terms you are replacing are the First and Last things in !str! and they occur exactly once. i.e.:  \n&gt;`&lt;stFnt:fontFamily&gt;textHere&lt;/stFnt:fontFamily&gt;`  \n  \nI don't think Line 30 does anything, as line 31 will (re)set the errorlevel either way. Try:  \n&gt;`find /i ^\"!str!^\" %init% &gt;nul &amp;&amp; find /i ^\"!str!^\" %clean% &gt;nul || (echo !str!&gt;&gt;%clean%)`  \n\nThe `||...` part will execute if either fails.  \n  \nLine 35: `%clean%` should ALWAYS exist by then, as it is created on Line 23.  \n  \nLine 42: the `x` in `call :Sub x` does nothing useful, as `:Sub` never uses `%1`.  \n  \nLines 53,60: It's probable best if you store the location of FontLoader.exe in a variable, so you don't need to make an edit half-way into the file.  \n  \nThe indentation of Lines 65 through 78 is inconsistent. Not an issue for cmd but it makes it harder to read properly.  \n  \nLines 73,74:A call without arguments followed by a goto is just the same as a goto.  \nProbably not an issue, but you can only `call` so many times before cmd kicks a fit and you get this:  \n\t\n\t******  B A T C H   R E C U R S I O N  exceeds STACK limits ******\n\tRecursion Count=593, Stack Usage=90 percent\n\t******       B A T C H   PROCESSING IS   A B O R T E D      ******\n\t\nLine 77: Comparisons of a variable to an empty string ( `if \"!x!\"==\"\" ... `) can be replaced with (`if not defined x ...`). The latter method is very very sightly quicker (0.12 seconds in ten thousand operations).  \n  \n&gt;**Code Improvements**  \n*Disclaimer: I haven't tested any of this to see if it will work.*\n  \nThe :Sp loop can be improved and even removed. Consider:  \n\t\n\tset line=!line:)=\" \"!\n\tfor %%A in (\"!line:/=\" \"!\") do if not \"%%~A\"==\"\" (\n\t\techo %%A | find \"FontFamily\" &gt;nul || (\n\t\t\tset \"found=%%~A\"\n\t\t\techo !found:FontFamily(=!&gt;&gt; %init%\n\t\t)\n\t)\n\t\nPut this on line 20 and it should work as intended.  \nThis has some shortcomings however, as each element of `line` is expanded, so if one contains an `*` then everything will break. It may also break if `line` contains any `\"`s.  \n  \nThe :Sub subroutine can also be improved slightly.  \n\t\n\t1&gt;nul 2&gt;nul dir /b %SystemRoot%\\Fonts\\*!x!* || (\n\t\t1&gt;&gt;\"%fp%\" 2&gt;nul dir /s /b %fontdir%\\*!x!*.tff,%fontdir%\\*!x!*.otf || (\n\t\t\techo [!x!] was not found...\n\t\t\tset /p x=\"Press Enter to skip or try a name variation: \" &amp;&amp; (\n\t\t\t\tgoto :Sub\n\t\t\t) || (\n\t\t\t\tset x=Skipped [!x!]\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t)\n\t\techo Found [!x!]\n\t)\n\t\nSwitching from a `... | find ...` setup to using wildcards should improve things significantly.\nAlso, `set /p` does NOT set the errorlevel to 0, ever. See the following example:\n\t\n\tN:\\&gt; echo [%errorlevel%]\n\t[0]\n\tN:\\&gt; set /p a=Type:\n\tType:\n\tN:\\&gt; echo [%errorlevel%]\n\t[1]\n\tN:\\&gt; set /p a=Type:\n\tType:OK\n\tN:\\&gt; echo [%errorlevel%]\n\t[1]\n\t\n  \nI hope all of this helps somewhat.

{"body": "I'm going to give you a long-ass answer, because there are certain things you really DO need to understand!! First of I'm going to tell you what you're going to do RIGHT NOW! Then I'll give you an explanation that I hope you'll read because you certainly need some help (and no, I don't mean that in an offensive way like most of the others seems to do...)\n\nFirstly; you will sell all your Bitcoins right NOW! Get that money of that market! (If you are so certain of being able to earn this money back, then there's no need for you to do that today! Money out, earn the rest back later.)\n\nSecondly; according to you, you'll then have about 280k $ which you will put in two different savings account in a **trusted** bank. One account will hold 200k $, and the other will hold about 80k $.\n\nThirdly; tell your sister EVERYTHING!\n\nFourthly (lol, that a word;p); if you don't have one already, get A JOB!\n\nFifthly; don't think I've got another point :P ...yet.\n\nAllright, so to the explanations... First, who am I to give you advice? (I'm not too familiar with all the different english terms for \"money transactions\" etc., so sorry if somethings unclear.) About eight years ago I wanted to figure out what all of this stock-market-easy-money-thing was all about, so therefore I invested about all my \"savings\" into the stock-market. I was about 20 years old and had about 3-4000 $. Not much, but it was what I had, and it was just an experiment on my part really. I just wanted to learn, and I saw that money as already lost! As about two years went by, I had tried a lot of different things, day-trading, long-term trading, low-risk and high-risk trading etc. etc. I felt I learned a lot, and I wanted to invest more, but this time with a goal to earn some money out of it. So I put in an additional 10k $ and had about 15k $ as the first money actually had grown a bit in the end. Today that money is about 75k $. Nothing great, but it's been just a hobby, as my main focus has been studying and now working. I'm just trying to say that I have some experience with this, and I've experienced all the good and bad parts (I've been down to about 1000 $ and up to 100k $, so it's been a fun journey.), and likewise as you, I've been selling low and buying high over a long period of time...and I feel with you!\n\nWhy sell all your bit coins right now? Because you need to learn how the market works before you invest in it! Blindly investing in some stock/company/resource/currencies/input-whatever-you-like-here, is just gambling! Then you might as well go to Vegas and have a crazy good time at least! So get your money out! I'm not very familiar with bit coins, but from what I hear (and seen now with a quick glance at the graph of it), it's crazy volatile and soooooo risky! Obviously you want some quick money, but T H A T W I L L N O T H A P P E N. \"Easy come, easy go\" is a saying for a reason!\n\nPut your money in a safe place! And why split them into 200k and 80k? Because those 200k is your sisters money and you will NEVER touch them again! \"...a verbal contract between my father and I...\"; a verbal contract is just as binding as a written one!! If your father wanted your sister to have that money, IT IS HER MONEY!! And why do you think your father gave you all the money for (let me help you..) safekeeping!? \n\nWhy haven't you told all of this to your sister?? She might hate you for it, yes, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't deserve to know!! And you certainly deserve at least some of the hatred! SHE NEEDS TO KNOW! What you should say and do, is that you give her those 200k when she is 21, and you'll owe her about 140k (175k - 30k - 5k - more??) which you will (here comes my last point..);\n\n...get a decent job for and W O R K  Y O U R  A S S  O F F  T O  G E T  A N D  G I V E  T O  H E R!!!!! END OF STORY!\n\n\nSome general investment advices:\n\nWith those 80k you got left, you can do with as you please. If you really want to learn to invest, you need to learn how it works first. And bit coins is a bad place to start! There's a lot of reasons for that, but firstly because it's so volatile. Secondly, because you should invest in something that's more hands-on. \"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet...\" WTF is that?! It cannot get any more unsafe than that! If anyone ever should invest in this, losing all the invested money should not affect them any, meaning you should see the money as already lost! So, will you put your livelihood into that? Will you want to say that your livelihood is already lost??\n\n\"I know I can earn this money back, I just need to figure out how.\"\nThere's no solution to markets! You cannot know that you can earn the money back! There's nothing to figure out!! Especially with bit coins!!! \n\"Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin.\" How is this in any way, shape or form safe? Aaahhh..I can go on about this, but I'll leave it be.. All I can say is, and people with some knowledge about these things should agree with me!, bit coins are a bad place to start investing a lot of money. \n\nAnother thing, how have you not learned anything about your investments so far? You have lost roughly 400k on this investment, and you still want to invest all your and your sisters money back into it?? There's nothing stopping you from loosing another 300k!! Do you not understand this?!\n\n\"How can I guarantee that I earn high returns?\" Argh!! C'mon man! In markets, there is no such thing as guarantees!!! If anybody tell you that they can guarantee anything in these matters, YOU SHOULD **ABSOLUTELY NOT** TRUST THEM!!!\n\nWhen it comes to money, nobody can be trusted... You have lied to your sister... do you see?! Even your sister can't trust you! So the question remains if you can trust yourself? ...it seems not... :/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385177740", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You might want to post on /r/stobuilds for specific advice about ships, but since this appeared here, I'll try to help as much as I can.\n\n\nLet's tackle it point by point. I appreciate the bullets; lets me organize my answers better.\n\n\n* Being blasted into space dust is one of the things you'll have to endure as an escort. The idea in an escort is not necessarily to immunize yourself to this, however. When you first start playing you might be a bit squishier, and as you gain equipment and grind more reputation stuff and better shields, deflectors, and get Fleet ships, you'll become a far tankier, but besides maybe a Neutronium console here and some other things there, the point shouldn't be to become an unkillable rock per se. The exception to this, of course, is engineers running escorts. In an escort, you have to maximize how deadly you can be in a small window of time. I'm talking destroy something in 5 seconds effective. You will have periods of low damage, between bursts of extreme damage. This more than compensates for your low survivability.\n* Classes matter in space. What matters even more is that the right class get themselves the right ship. There are some exceptions, but the right ship for the right class is a good strategy to follow. Also, PvE won't show these differences because it's generally about making as much damage as possible, *with exceptions*. One of the reasons I'm all about PvP nowadays is because that's where you really see classes *shine* for what they are. The Science officers are doing their thing, debuffing, subnuking, crowd controlling, the Engineers are tanking and pressuring, and the Tacticals are doing a bunch of different manners of dealing damage, spiking, etc. Classes become more apparent when the enemies are more challenging or have more tricks up their sleeves. Each class has its own unique flavor, and often can make or break a match. In PvP, especially - if you have a team with 5 tacs against a team with 2 tacs and 3 scis, the team with 5 tacs is probably going to lose, provided that they all have a similar level of skill with builds and playstyle.\n* You'll get better at it with time! Cruisers are more tanky, but the amount of damage they do, and how they do them (over time? spike? both?) depends heavily on how you outfit them in terms of BOFF abilities, weapons, etc. Of course this is true for any ship, but there are some cruisers out there &gt;coughFleetExcelsiorcough&lt; that are very versatile and can pull off a number of different builds well. Cruisers are not escorts, however, especially on Fedside because they usually can't even equip dual heavy cannons. More on AuxToBat in a bit\n\n\n\nThings you like:\n\n* Are you a Tac or an Eng officer? You might like the Fleet Excelsior or Fleet Sovereign\n* This is a tricky matter to handle. Ultimately you'll have to find the right balance between \"look how fast I can kill things and--oh shit I died\" to \"I can tank, but this is taking f o r e v e r\".\n* That's cool. Find out what works best for you in PvE situations. Most PvE situations pit you against multiple enemies, so AoE (Area of Effect) abilities like Beams: Fire at Will and Cannon: Scatter Volley are great, especially if combined with Attack Pattern Beta, or something like Grav Well 1 (AoE pull).\n\n\nI think Kurtis or someone might have written something about AuxToBat in the sidebar, check out the link!

{"body": "Okay, let's allow that one to slide for the time being. I don't entirely agree that it works in a modern society, but never mind.\n\nDoesn't solve the simple arithmetic problem. Look at it like this: Here's a very small MLM-type scheme that's only just got started. It has four members: the guy who set it up (we'll call him \"CEO\"), three distributors, thus:\n\n         CEO\n          |\n     /---------\\\n     |    |    |\n     D    D    D\n\nOne \"layer\" below the top, three distributors. Remember that bit, we'll be coming back to it later.\n\nWith me so far? Now, let's say they decide to keep things simple: each distributor will follow the same pattern of hiring three further distributors. These distributors can either focus on reselling the product, recruiting more distributors or both. Seeing as both will give them an income, but recruiting distributors means you get a recurring income off the back of their work - and neither, it turns out, will produce a living wage on its own - it's almost inevitable they'll choose both. Resale for immediate profits, recruit for ongoing residual income.\n\nA few months later, every distributor has recruited their three further distributors and the chart looks like this:\n\n                      CEO\n                       |     \n           /-----------|------------\\\n          /            |             \\\n          D            D             D\n          |            |             |        \n     /-------\\     /-------\\     /-------\\ \n     |   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |\n     D   D   D     D   D   D     D   D   D\n\n\nThat extra layer to the chart has added 9 distributors. So, layer 2, 9 distributors. Each of those 9 distributors must find another 3 to keep the system going:\n\n                             CEO\n                              |     \n             /----------------|---------------\\\n            /                 |                \\\n            D                 D                 D\n            |                 |                 |        \n      /-----------\\     /-----------\\     /-----------\\ \n      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n      D     D     D     D     D     D     D     D     D\n     /|\\   /|\\   /|\\   /|\\   /|\\   /|\\   /|\\   /|\\   /|\\\n    D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D\n\nSo... that third layer added 27 distributors.\n\nIf you're particularly awake, you'll have spotted a pattern emerging. Every new layer requires 3^n (where n is the layer number) to function. \n\nThe first layer was 3^1 distributors = 3 distributors, 4 members in total.\n\nSecond layer, 3^2 = 9 new members. Plus our existing members, we've got 13 in total.\n\nThird layer, 3^3 = 27 new members. Plus our existing 13 members = 40 members.\n\nFourth layer, 3^4 = 81 new members.

{"body": "I'll give some general advice but it would help if we could actually see the CVs and hear about the system that you are working on, particularly whether the wave in question is reversible or not and whether you are working with a molecule in solution.  I'm assuming you're working on a molecule in solution.  If you suspect that there are any follow up chemical reactions, then this complicates matters, and you might not even be able to find the values experimentally, so you might have to resort to modelling software.\n\n**Mass transfer coefficient** I've honestly only heard anyone ever talk about the diffusion coefficient.  I think that's because during a CV, you assume that by having a high concentration of supporting electrolyte (and not scanning below 50 mV/s) diffusion is the only mode of mass transfer, so I think they're one in the same.\n\nMy favorite way to get the diffusion coefficient **from a reversible wave** is to simply plug the peak current (ip) into this equation\n\nip = 0.446 x F x A x C x sqrt[(D x F x v)/(R x T)], where A is the electrode area and C is the analyte concentration, D is the diffusion coefficient, R is the gas constant, T is the temp in K, F is faradays constant, and v is the scanrate\n\n**Charge (electron) transfer coefficient**  In Marcus Hush modelling, this coefficient actually changes as you change the potential.  But if we assume Butler Volmer, this is a constant.  One way to try and find this value is by measuring the peak width of the wave in question.  The peak width is defined by the peak potential (Ep) minus the half-current peak potential (E(p/2), or potential at which you measure current equal to half the peak current, *make sure to correct for the baseline!*).  The absolute value of (Ep - E(p/2)) is equal to (1.857 x R x T)/(F x a)  where a is the charge transfer coefficient.\n\nIf you have an irreversible electron transfer and you are absolutely positive that there is no follow up chemical step, another way to try and find the charge transfer coefficient is to vary the scan rate and plot (Ep) vs. log(v), the slope should be (1.15 x R x T)/(F x a).\n\nTruthfully, only hardcore electrochemists care about the charge transfer coefficient, and you really need to understand marcus theory to understand it.  If you find a value higher than 0.7 or lower than 0.3, I wouldn't trust it, and I would be very careful reporting anything that is not 0.4-0.6.\n\n**Standard rate constant**  Again, this only works if there are no chemical steps involved.  If this is the case, you know your E0 (the potential half way between the cathodic and anodic peaks).  \n\nThe right way to do this experimentally for a reversible wave is to get your hands on an ultramicroelectrode, cross your fingers, perform a seance to become possessed by the spirits of Bard and Saveant, and perform ultrafast scans (up to 50,000 V/s).  The cathodic and anodic peaks will start to get further from each other, and plotting Ep vs ln(sqrt(1/v), you should get a line with a slope of [(R x T)/(F x a)] x [ln(k x (sqrt((R x T)/(a x F x D))))] for a cathodic peak or [(R x T)/(F x (1-a))] x [ln(k x (sqrt((R x T)/((1-a) x F x D))))] for an anodic peak (be careful with your signs), where k is the standard rate constant.\n\nIf the wave is electrochemically irreversible and you know E0, you can plot ln(ip) vs (Ep - E0) at different scan rates and you will have a line with a slope of -(F x a)/(R x T) with a y-intercept of ln(0.227 x F x A x C x k).\n\nI got all this info from \"Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications\" by Bard and Faulkner and \"Elements of Molecular and Biomolecular Electrochemistry\" by Saveant, which is basically an in depth look at the cyclic voltammetry sections of Bard and Faulkner.  Check if your university has it, get it only if you want to bash your head against a wall trying to understand dimensionless parameters and convolution.  I still don't claim to understand dimensionless parameters.\n\nAs the other people on this thread have stated, modelling software is one option, but it is very easy to get nonsense values out of modelling software if you don't know what you're doing.

{"body": "I'll try to be objective about this - because I _really_ like movie music. I truly believe that music score composers are the classical composers of our day, mostly because they go out of their way to experiment with all the available modern instruments while retaining all the good old ones; music in movies is probably their last saving grace after all the plots have been dumbed down to allow our brainzzz the room to process the CGI and _extremely necessary_ lens flare... (you _recall_? I _totally_ do)\n  \nIf I may do some categorisation: we have movie _scores_ and we have movie _songs_. The former are usually instrumental + choral arrangements made specifically for the movie, whereas the latter are individual songs that are chosen to add to the atmosphere (in most cases, by bands/musicians unrelated to the movie).   \n  \nIn both cases, however, I try to establish what makes the music in a movie good - it's essentially a toss up between:  \n  \n- Do I like the actual _sound_ of the song/score?  \n- Does the song/score _improve_ the movie (add to it in a strongly significant manner)?  \n  \nThe first point is pretty simple, and in most cases it applies to the **songs** (from external musicians) used in movies. Most cases, not all. This category is where I would lob movies such as:  \n  \n- Sucker Punch (like, really, the songs ... so, so clutch)  \n- Warm Bodies (the National, M83, Bob Dylan, Bon Iver ... just o.o)  \n  \nThe second point is significantly difficult for me to rate, mostly because I feel that the rating I use favours bad movies. Essentially (this is a generalisation, but it's where my thought process starts), I ask myself what the movie would be like _without_ the **score**. Other factors, such as whether or not the main tune stays after the movie (_Man of Steel - that fifth on the reverb-y piano_), whether it was invasive in a _good_ way (_Book of Eli_) or just f*ckin invasive (_Resident Evil_) or subliminal (_Let Me In_) throughout the movie, and so on, also contribute. This choice is strongly influenced by my favourite score composers though - and my severely limited exposure to movies :) This is where I would put movies such as:  \n  \n - Lady in the Water (James _frakkin_ Newton _frakkin_ Howard, man)\n - Hannibal (yeah, the Zimmer)\n - August Rush (Mancina ftw)\n  \nNaturally, the above lists are hardly conclusive. But this question wasn't about how _I decide_ which movie I think has the best music...  \n  \n**TL;DR** Based on the number of times I've listened to this album, T R O N : L E G A C Y _by a f*ckin mile_.\n  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385325306", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Picturesque, even. You couldn't ask for a better existence. \n\nIt was raining. The kind of rain that makes you think about Noah and his Ark. I was having trouble seeing the lines on the road, so I was taking it slow and being cautious. We went through an intersection and were T-boned by this man. This *child*.

Little Joshua was impaled by a shard of the door, staying alive for long enough to say one last word.\n\n*\"...Dad...?\"*\n\nI don't even remember being pulled out of the car.

Something that hurt much more, and burned that much more fierce.\n\nAnger. \n\n\"I want him to die one death for each day of life he had,\" I growled.\n\nMel smirked. \"How poetic, John. Allow me to 'sweeten the pot', as the gamblers put it. I'll let you have the honor of ending his life, over and over again. Do this, and you will have your family back. The only thing I ask is for your soul.\"\n\n\"Do whatever you have to do. I don't care.\", I replied, \"All I want is for him to pay.\"\n\n\"Very well. Close your eyes John. When you open them, you will find yourself near him. All you have to do is end his life. When you do, you will feel a fading sensation and awake the day before that. All you have to do is do this until the day of his birth. Is that understood?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I closed my eyes and waited.\n\n-----\n\nSo here we are.

{"body": "Here's my take on MIDI-entry and workflow if you find it at all helpful:\n\nMost of my compositions are in the form of jazz lead sheets, but I also create exercises for students and compose short classical pieces.  I have a fully capable MIDI setup and a nice 88-key weighted keyboard (Yamaha P120).  My software of choice is [MuseScore](http://musescore.org/), but I used Finale in college and with students of mine.\n\nIn my setup: MIDI entry is ready to go, my computer is right next to my keyboard, and I almost never use it.  Here's why:\n\n* Real-time MIDI entry is not good enough to be reliable.  You can tell Finale to record your input and it will get most of the notes and notate absolutely atrocious rhythms.  You will always have to go through and manually correct individual notes, chords, rhythms, etc.  With notation programs, it is almost always faster to get it right from the beginning instead of going back and editing mistakes.\n\n* Disregarding real-time MIDI entry, we still have limitations with stop-time MIDI entry.  Namely, we have to tell the computer what kind of note duration is coming next.  This means one hand will be on the MIDI keyboard and one hand will be on the computer keyboard selecting notes.\n\nThe fastest way I have found to enter things in is just using \"A B C D E F G\" on a normal computer keyboard and using keyboard shortcuts to quickly move things around (sharps, flats, change octaves, etc).  I can get a typical lead sheet entered in, with lyrics, and nicely formatted in under 30 minutes.\n\nSo, those are just a few things to think about!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385341004", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When it comes to computers there are even more ways to optimize. I'll try to keep this simple because this is deep stuff but I can't guarantee it will be. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory#Complexity_classes\n\nBasically when you code an algorithm into a game or anything else, the time it takes to run that particular code is a function of the input size. So lets say you have a terrain generation algorithm in your game. You have the choice between 2 algorithms. One has little overhead but each coordinate has to be compared to each other coordinate(for any odd reason it doesn't really matter for the thought experiment). Let's say the other algorithm only has to compare coordinates that are near each other, but there is some overhead in determining which coordinates are near. \n\nFor the first algorithm N coordinates will have to be compared N times. so N^2.\n\nFor the second algorithm N coordinates will have to be compared to much less, lets just say the nearest 8 since that accounts for N E S W NE SE NW and SW if they are aligned in a grid. \n\nFor the sake of demonstrating my point lets say the overhead is 1250x for each compare. So the total time for this one is 10000*N. \n\nIn this case if N is less than 100 the naive algorithm will be both faster and easier to code since it is simpler. But once our data set gets past a certain size the other one begins to be faster since the first one grows more as a function of input size. \n\nTL;DR More efficient algorithms are only more efficient on larger data sets, sometimes in the millions. With a new generation comes much larger data sizes and new algorithms with less \"complex\" growth can be discovered to take advantage of this. \n\nEdit: A great real world example is a naive terrain engine vs the Just Cause engine. An easy way to code terrain into a game is to arrange the coordinates into a 2D grid with a height for each point. This doesn't allow for level of detail though. Now check out the insane way Just Cause's terrain was made(Warning long and complex read): http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/192007/sponsored_the_world_of_just_cause_.php?page=1", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385378358", "subreddit": "PS4", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

All orthographic features have been affected. For example, the status of capitalization varies greatly. Most of the Internet is not case-sensitive, which thus motivates the random use of capitals or no capitals at all. There is a strong tendency to use lower-case everywhere. The \"save a keystroke\" principle is widely found in e-mails, chatgroups, and virtual worlds, where whole sentences can be produced without capitals (or punctuation):\n\n    john are you going to london next week \n\n&gt;The lower-case default mentality means that any use of capitalization is a strongly marked form of communication.

{"body": "This is likely an issue with the way the MPEG streams are configured. Generally MPEG-2 encoding (I am not especially familiar with MPEG 4 but I would hazard a guess that it is similar, or at a very minimum has great flexibility in its configuration) uses three types of frames: I, B and P.\n\n- I (intra) frames are full frames of data encoded similarly to JPEG (~7:1 compression). These do not reference any other frames.\n\n- P (predicted) frames only have information describing the difference between the preceding I or P frame (lower size than I frames, ~20:1 compression).\n\nBoth I and P frames are called \"reference frames\" since the information they describe can be referenced by other frames.\n\n- B (bidirectional) frames are encoded from interpolation of preceding/following reference frames (even smaller than P frames, ~50:1 compression).\n\nThese various frame types are typically sent in the following way:\n\n    I B B P B B I B B P B B I P B B....\n\nWhere the distance between I/P frames (in this case it is 3) is configurable as is the distance between I frames (in this case there are 6).\n\nWhy am I telling you this!? Well, a P frame cannot be decoded without its referenced I frame, and B frames cannot be decoded without all of their referenced I/P frame. So, the longer the distances mentioned above, the greater affect a lossy channel will have. You would see the behavior you are describing in the following case:\n\n    MPEG2 GOP structure (m=2, n=4): I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B P B I B ....\n\n    MPEG4 GOP structure (m=4, n=16): I B B B P B B B P B B B P B B B I B B B P B B B P B B B P B B B ....\n\nA lost I frame on the lower stream would blow away 16 frames of data, while on the upper frame only 4 frames.

Formed in 1981, Tulpa was equal parts Chris Bottomley, John Bottomley and Sev Micron (Mike Severin). They were a progressive rock trio from Toronto, Canada that sounded like a meeting between King Krimson and the Sex Pistols. They were loud, aggressive, opinionated, funny and angry, with a crazy, psychedelic stage show called The Tulpa Circus. It was very multi-media and involved slide projection, dance and strange futuristic cyber clowns.

{"body": "What even is a 10 second song? That sounds more like you want a sound effect than a song, in which case again you'd be better off scouring the web for some sound effects or getting someone else to make them for you. Unless you mean a full song but you fade in for 10 seconds and then fade back out, as I can't imagine a song that starts and ends in only 10 seconds.\n\n&gt;Is it really hard to make 10 second songs?\n\nIt's not that hard to make any song. A song is just organized sounds. But to make something that sounds somewhat good, yeah it can be. If you're not planning on going with more of a sound effect here's a couple things you could do.\n\nPlay a prebuilt arp on a synthesizer VST. An arp is basically a bunch of notes already laid out, so it'll pretty much play itself. A sequence is (for these purposes at least) pretty much the same thing. I'm not sure of any VSTs that are free and have prebuilt arps or sequences, but search \"VST preset arp sequences patch free\" and you should be able to find something.\n\nYou could also learn some quick music theory;\n\nC D E G A is the Major Pentatonic if you want something \"happy\"\n\nC  Eb F G Bb is the Minor Pentatonic if you want something \"sad\"\n\nThe emotions these scales have are not set in stone, as they can all sound like any emotion if used properly; happy and sad are just their tendencies.\n\nNow just take your synthesizer VST and put in some on midi. You'll need a DAW to do this, and I don't know of a free one. But search \"Digital Area Workstation free\" or \"DAW free\" and you may find one. Check to see if it can use VST plugins and how to install them. Also check how to program MIDI; common ways include Piano Roll and Sheet Music. Then grab some free VSTs and program them on midi. Essentially the midi is the notes you're using.\n\nIf you get stuck somewhere along the way while doing all this let me know and I'll try to help you out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385511859", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Lol nice story. You seem to have lasted way longer than I and I wish I wasn't panicking enough to where I forgot about lester's off the radar perk. But I love the adrenalin rush you get from trying to stay alive as a 9k bounty in a full room.\n\nMy experience last night, I accidentally killed a crew member in my buzzard because I was attacking the cops that were chasing  him. One of my missiles blew him up as soon as the police helicopter dodged it. Clever girl.\n\nMy friend said \"What the hell? Nobody kills me.\" He then proceeded to put a 9k bounty on me. As someone who never usually gets a bounty, I decide to see how long I could survive. Pretty sure my brother and friend that I killed wanted me dead. Not sure about my other member in the room, we'll call him \"U\".\n\nStill being in the buzzard, I elevated to the highest building near me since we were in the city. As I'm about to get there, some dude, in a cargobob of all things, was trying to run into me for the kill. I tried to missile him but it was too risky, he was too close. Thankfully the buzzard is quicker so I simply flew away. As I'm turning away from this guy, another dude in a regular helicopter trying the same thing, but the buzzard is just too quick.\n\nSo after dodging these guys by flying around buildings I finally get high enough to land on the highest one. Immediately after doing so I get out and go toward the edge in case the copters come toward me and crash into me, I'll shoot them down.\n\nNot even 10 seconds after getting on the ledge of the skyscraper I see a white dot coming close. Too close. I turn around and the dude in the cargobob is RIGHT IN MY DAMN FACE. I quickly drew my Assault Rifle and shot him dead 1 second before the cargobob crashes into the building before me, exploding and launching my character off the roof.\n\nAs I was shooting I thought, \"oh no I cant lose my bounty this fast.\" because I thought he had me. Turns out I killed him just in time for it to count as a suicide by explosion lol. \n\nAt this point I'm spamming \"X\" (ps3) because I know we  will both spawn on the floor below the building. I spawn a good 40 feet away from him as he was still flickering from the respawn and I just book it to the nearest car ( X X X X X X X X X X X RUNNNN) but theres NOTHING! No damn car anywhere, WTF?\n\nWhile I'm running against the wall, I see a white dot coming toward me at too fast of a pace, I figured Oh shit, hes definitely in a car and is about to run me over. And since im running in the same direction, I dont want to spend the time to look behind me to see because by the time I do so im probably roadkill. So instead of that, I quickly jump to the left of me to see if i can dodge it as it hits. He hit my leg while I was in the air and im on the floor struggling to get up. \n\nWhile getting up i see him 10 feet away getting out of his car to kill me. But its a woman. I get up just in time to send bullets flying into her face.  So damn close. I steal the car she was using and had no idea where I was heading. I just went. After a few seconds I saw the parked trains under the freeways.\n\nI see \"U\" coming toward me. I keep shouting in the mic FRIEND OR FOE!? Everyone is talking though so i wasnt sure what his answer was. So i kill him. After doing so he said \"MAN I WAS HELPING\" HAHAHA i said DUDE IM SCARED! FORGIVE!\n\nGot to the back of the train station, saw a guy on the freeway looking down at me about to shoot and I try to pull out my machine gun I just got at 50, but instead it pulls my FREAKIN PISTOL OUT. So I'm trying to hold the button down to shoot and bam, only shoots once, thats when I noticed it was the pistol. So I kept shooting thinking oh noooooooo get emm!\n\nBut it was no match.

{"body": "Perhaps this does not directly address all the issues raised in the above quote, but I have found Sweezy's explanation of the 1859 Preface, and base and superstructure, quite helpful. \n\nSweezy, \"Four Lectures on Marxism.\" Pg 21-3 (Bold mine)\n\n&gt;Here  we  have  [in the 1859 Preface] what  appears  to  be  a  universally  valid  schema  for understanding  history.  The  genesis,  direction,  and  modalities  of change  are  mapped  out,  and  the  appropriate  points  for  human intervention to hasten and smooth the process,  different for different stages  in the  development  of a given mode of production,  are more or  less  clearly  indicated.  It  is  no wonder  that  this  way  of thinking has  exercised  such  a  fascination  for  generations  of  Marxists,  and that  now,  in  a  time  that  nearly  everyone  considers  to  be  a  revolutionary epoch par excellence, it should steadily attract new converts.\n\n&gt;And  yet  we  have  to  ask  whether  it  is  really  a  Marxist  way  of  thinking.  It  has  its  origin  in  the  writings  of Marx  and  Engels  in one  place  and  one  place  only,  the  brief *Preface  to  Marx’s  Critique of Political  Economy* (1859).  The purpose  of this  *Preface*  was  not  to expound  a  scientific  theory  but  to  give  readers  information  that would  help  them  to  understand  the  book  and  the  point  of  view from  which  it  was  written.  Most  of this  information  was  autobiographical,  leading  up  to  an  explanation  of  how  the  author  came to  focus  his  research  on  political  economy,  the  subject  matter  of  the  book.  This  in  turn  gave  rise  to  a  “general  conclusion”  which “once  reached  ...  served  as  the  guiding  thread  in  my  studies.” There  then  follows  an  exposition,  couched  in  very  general  terms, of the  schema  sketched  above— forces  and  relations  of production, base  and  superstructure,  revolutionary  transformations.  The  ‘ general  conclusion' then  ends  with  speculations  on  two  themes  that were  doubtless  closely  connected  in  Marx’s  mind  but  for  which subsequent  history  has  provided  little  support:  (1)  “A  social  system ,”  Marx stated,  “never perishes  before  all  the productive  forces have  developed  for  which  it  is  wide  enough;  and  new,  higher productive  relations  never  come  into  being  before  the  material conditions  have  been  brought  to maturity  within  the  womb  of the old  society.”  And  (2)  “In  broad  outline,  the  Asiatic,  the  ancient, the  feudal,  and  the  modern  bourgeois  modes  of production  can  be indicated  as  progressive  epochs  in  the  economic  system  of society. Bourgeois  productive  relationships  are  the  last  antagonistic  form of the  social  process  of production  . . .  :  but  the  productive  forces developing  within  the  womb  of bourgeois  society  at  the  same  time create  the  material  conditions  for  the  solution  of this  antagonism. With this social system,  therefore,  the pre-history of human  society comes  to  a  close.”\n\n\n&gt;If one  examines  this  *Preface*  as  a  whole  and  in  context,  rather than  simply  lifting  out  a  few  statements  that  are  formulated  in general  terms,  it  is  unmistakably  clear that what  Marx was  talking about  was  capitalism,  not  history  in  general.  Political  economy, of course,  meant  the  political  economy  of capitalism:  Marx  always used  the  term  in this sense;  it was  therefore the study of capitalism and  not  of  any  other  forms  of  society  that  led  to  his  “general conclusion” ;  the  forces  of  production/relations  of  production  and base/superstructure  schema  was  evidently  derived  from  his  study of capitalism,  including  its  origins,  its  development,  and  its  presumed  future;  the  revolution  transforming  relations  of production that  had  become  incompatible  with  growing  forces  of production undoubtedly  referred  to  both  the  bourgeois  revolution and  to  what Marx  was  certain  was  the  coming  proletarian  revolution.  The  insertion  of  a  single  sentence  listing  Asiatic,  ancient,  feudal,  and modern  bourgeois  modes  of  production  as  “progressive  epochs  in the  economic  system  of society”  does  not  contradict  this  interpretation:  it  was  simply  meant  to  emphasize  the  status  of capitalism as one,  and  in Marx’s view the last,  in a long  line of “antagonistic” forms  of  society.  That  he  had  no  thought  of  reading  back  into those  earlier  societies  the  structure  and  mode  of functioning  characteristic  of  capitalism  is  conclusively  proved  by  the  well-known fact  that  it  was  precisely  during  the  1850s,  when  the  *Critique  of Political  Economy* was  taking  shape,  that  Marx  came  to  adopt  the (erroneous) view of Asian society,  in the words of the Indian Marxist historian  Bipan  Chandra,  as  “a  stagnant  changeless  society  which was  incapable of change from within.”  Such a view obviously could not  have  been  held  simultaneously  with  a  belief  in  the  universal applicability  of the  schema  set  forth  in  the  *Preface*  to  the  *Critique*. Nor  did  Marx  or  Engels  on  any  other  occasion  elaborate  on  the schema  or  seek  to  apply  it  to  the  understanding  of precapitalist societies.  This  was  the  work of later Marxists,  undertaken  for their own reasons and purposes and not because it was a logical outgrowth of the  Marxist  interpretation  of history.**\n\n\n&gt;We  shall  return  to  this  theme  later  on  when  we  come  to  the question  of postcapitalist  societies.  In  the  meantime  I  want  only to  add,  in  order  to avoid possible  misunderstanding,  that  I  believe  that  as  applied  to  capitalism the  schema  of  the  Preface  can  yield useful  insights  and  understanding.  The  reason  is  that  **under  capitalism,  unlike  other  forms  of society,  separating  base  from  superstructure  and  locating  the  prime  source  of  change  in  the  base correspond  to  a  deep-seated  and  palpable  reality,  namely,  the  unplanned and  uncontrolled character of a predominantly commodity- producing  economy.  Furthermore,  the  distinction  between  forces of production  (means  of production,  technology,  and  workers)  and relations  of production  (the  absolute  dominance  of capital  over  the production  process,  guaranteed  by  the  system  of private  property) is  there  for  everyone  to  see.  And  it  does  not  take  a  profound k n o w led g e  of economic  history  to  understand  that  underlying  the great  changes  that  have  characterized  the  capitalist  epoch  has  been a  series  of  technological  revolutions.  Nor  would  anyone  want  to deny  that  these  changes  originating  in  the  economy  have  more  or less  rapidly  spread  to  other  areas,  including  government  and  laws, philosophy  and  religion,  culture  and  the  arts,  in  short  everything that  is  usually  thought  of as  constituting  the  superstructure.**\n\n\n&gt;The  schema  of  the  Preface  is  thus  by  no  means  arbitrary  or artificial  as  applied  to  the  case  of capitalism,  from  which,  after all, it  was  originally  derived.  **But  it  seems  to  me  a  great  mistake  to treat  this  schema  as  embodying  “laws”  of  historical  materialism that  are  universally  valid.  The  essence  of historical  materialism  is simply  that  every  society  has  to  produce  what  it  consumes,  and it  has  to  consume  in  order  to  reproduce  itself,  to  survive,  and  to carry  on  the  myriad  activities  that  together  define  it  as  a  recognizable  historical  entity.**  Production  is  therefore  fundamental  in a  universal  and  unique  sense,  and  a  scientific  approach  to  the understanding  of  history  has  to  take  this  as  its  starting  point.  **Furthermore,  it  is  obvious  that  the  possibilities  of  production  at any  given  time  and  place  establish  narrow,  though  certainly  not rigidly  defined,  limits  and  constraints  on  what  a particular  society can  actually  accomplish.**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385616513", "subreddit": "communism101", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Nicely done! A couple thoughts:\n\n* Don't whack the thumb notes so hard from m. 5 onwards. Don't think about the notes as grouped by beats: (rest A F A) | (C A F A) | (C G F G) | (C G E G). Instead, practice phrasing them this way: rest (A F A | C) (A F A | C) (G F G | C) (G E G | C), and so on.\n\n* Watch out for rhythmic inconsistency around mm 10-12. Here's how I'd practice it: go in groups of two beats and block up all the notes you play into one chord (except for maybe one or two that won't fit). E.g. in measure 10 I'd play C, Bb, and C in the left hand and E G Bb D in your right, then move to C and A in your left and F A C F in your right. First, figure out those block chords out of time, and just get used to moving from one to the next. Then practice playing them in rhythm (so it'll be pretty slow, a metronome might help). After that, I'd do the same process in quarter note groupings. My reasoning is that the rhythmic jerkiness is probably coming from uncertainty about how your hand moves from position to position in that passage. By doing this, you isolate just the changes in hand position and shape, and once those are in your muscles, filling in the moving notes will be much easier.\n\n* I don't know if you're doing this intentionally, but you're playing the last bar nearly twice as slow as it's supposed to go. The eighths in your last bar are like the quarters preceding it. It's okay to slow down a little bit at the end in Bach, but not that much. You should still feel the quarter note (or half note) as the fundamental beat, except for *maybe* on the last couple notes.\n\nOverall not bad at all, though! A lot of people have trouble interpreting Baroque music and tend to over-romanticize it, especially relative beginners, but you did a very good job with this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385775164", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Lastly, the chorus is just the first four notes of the E minor scale in reverse descending order: A, G, F#, E. \nThe rest is on you!

{"body": "Okay so this is how I answered the question. Any advice or critique is welcome. Sorry if it is a long read. I put the question first. \n\n2. Your company wants to use Apache as a load balancer and firewall for several of their internal servers. These servers all have different hardware and software configurations. Some have slower processors than others and may support more than one application. What load balancer scheduling algorithm would you suggest and why? Give as much detail as possible.\n\nTo answer this question I would give them the following scenario. Let's assume that the company has four machines. Two of the machines are top of the line and state of the art and can handle much larger work loads. The other two are older machines that while stable and effective, simply cannot handle the same work load as the aformentioned machines. \nIn this case a \"Request Counting Algorithm\" could be applied to the loadbalancer. Enabled via lbmethod=byrequests the configuration of the Request Count could resemble the following in table form.  \n\nworker       A   B   C   D\nlbfactor     2   2   1   1  \n\nThis setup has 4 machines. \"A\" and \"B\" are your performance machines while \"C\" and \"D\" are your older models. This table represents \"A\" and \"B\" both handling twice the requests of the \"C\" and \"D\". The requests would resemble this. \nA B A B C D - A B A B C D - A B A B C D  This is only a small example of the load balancing configuration. Performance tests could be performed on all machines and the balance could be tweaked to properly determine the percentage of requests machine to machine. \n\nAnother very similar method would be the Weighted Traffic Counting Algorithm. The idea is much the same as the above however this method measures traffic in bytes rather than requests. Using the same scenario from above we could use this table to represent the share of work between the four machines. \n\nworker     A   B   C   D \nlbfactor   2   2   1   1 \n\nThis table represents \"A\" and \"B\" processing twice the amount of \"I/0\" or input/output as \"C\" and \"D\". In this configuration the percentage is purely based on data sent back and forth and not simply on a per request basis. \n\nIn closing both scenarios would work but determining which one to choose should be based on performance tests of the machines. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385799228", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
