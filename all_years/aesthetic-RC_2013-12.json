{"body": "Why anyone would listen to a \"cook\" whose name is taint is beyond me. Without adding anything...Here's the facts: \n\nIn cooking, the smoke point of an oil or fat is the temperature at which it begins to break down to glycerol and free fatty acids, and produce bluish smoke. The glycerol is then further broken down to acrolein which is a component of the smoke. It is the presence of the acrolein that causes the smoke to be extremely irritating to the eyes and throat. The smoke point also marks the beginning of both flavor and nutritional degradation. Therefore, it is a key consideration when selecting a fat for frying, with the smoke point of the specific oil dictating its maximum usable temperature and therefore its possible applications. For instance, since deep frying is a very high temperature process, it requires a fat with a high smoke point.\n\nThe smoke point for an oil varies widely depending on origin and refinement.[1] The smoke point of an oil does tend to increase as free fatty acid content decreases and degree of refinement increases.[2][3] Heating oil produces free fatty acid and as heating time increases, more free fatty acids are produced, thereby decreasing smoke point. It is one reason not to use the same oil to deep fry more than twice.[1] Intermittent frying has a markedly greater effect on oil deterioration than continuous frying.[4]\n\nConsiderably above the temperature of the smoke point is the flash point, the point at which the vapors from the oil can first ignite when mixed with air.\n\nThe following table presents smoke points of various fats:\n\nFat\tQuality\tSmoke Point\nAlmond oil\t\t420°F\t216°C\nAvocado oil\tUn-Refined, Virgin\t375-400°F\t190-204°C\nAvocado oil\tRefined\t520°F\t271°C[5]\nButter\t\t250–300°F\t121–149°C\nCanola oil\tExpeller Press\t375-450°F[6]\t190-232°C\nCanola oil\tHigh Oleic\t475°F\t246°C\nCanola oil\tRefined\t400°F\t204°C[1]\nCastor oil\tRefined\t392°F\t200°C[7]\nCoconut oil\tVirgin (Unrefined)\t350°F[8]\t177°C\nCoconut oil\tRefined with stabilizers\t450°F\t232°C\nCorn oil\tUnrefined\t352°F\t178°C[7]\nCorn oil\tRefined\t450°F\t232°C[1]\nCottonseed oil\t\t420°F\t216°C[1]\nFlax seed oil\tUnrefined\t225°F\t107°C\nGhee (Indian Clarified Butter)\t\t485°F\t252°C\nGrapeseed oil\t\t420°F\t216°C\nHazelnut oil\t\t430°F\t221°C\nHemp oil\t\t330°F\t165°C\nLard\t\t370°F\t188°C\nMacadamia oil\t\t413°F\t210°C\nMustard oil\t\t489°F\t254°C\nOlive oil\tExtra virgin\t375°F\t191°C\nOlive oil\tVirgin\t391°F\t199°C[7]\nOlive oil\tPomace\t460°F\t238°C[1]\nOlive oil\tExtra light\t468°F\t242°C[1]\nOlive oil, high quality (low acidity)\tExtra virgin\t405°F\t207°C\nPalm oil\tDifractionated\t455°F\t235°C[9]\nPeanut oil\tUnrefined\t320°F\t160°C\nPeanut oil\tRefined\t450°F\t232°C[1]\nRice bran oil\t\t490°F\t254°C\nSafflower oil\tUnrefined\t225°F\t107°C\nSafflower oil\tSemirefined\t320°F\t160°C\nSafflower oil\tRefined\t510°F\t266°C[1]\nSesame oil\tUnrefined\t350°F\t177°C\nSesame oil\tSemirefined\t450°F\t232°C\nSoybean oil\tUnrefined\t320°F\t160°C\nSoybean oil\tSemirefined\t350°F\t177°C\nSoybean oil\tRefined\t460°F\t238°C[1]\nSunflower oil\tUnrefined\t225°F\t107°C\nSunflower oil\tSemirefined\t450°F\t232°C\nSunflower oil\tRefined\t440°F\t227°C[1]\nSunflower oil, high oleic\tUnrefined\t320°F\t160°C\nTallow (Beef)\t\t420°F\t215°C\nTea seed oil\t\t485°F\t252°C\nVegetable shortening\t\t360°F\t182°C\nWalnut oil\tUnrefined\t320°F\t160°C\nWalnut oil\tSemirefined\t400°F\t204°C\n[edit]\n\nBoiling point\nFlash point\nFire point\nKindling point (Autoignition temperature)\n[edit]\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k Wolke, Robert L.

{"body": "OK, a couple things before I get to how to do a key modulation (i.e. \"jump\" from one key to another):\n\n1) Your enharmonic spelling of Bb as A# is a little confusing here. When you're dealing with a key change, the first important thing you need to understand is what key you're coming from and what key you're going to. You said you're starting in E minor, and you're going to a key involving Dm, F and \"A#sus.\" There are multiple possible keys that can contain these 3 chords, and the first one that comes to my mind is D minor. The thing is that in the key of D minor, the 6th scale degree is spelled Bb, not A#. (D E F G A Bb C) So I think calling it Bbsus would make more sense here. \n\n2) the Bbsus being a suspended chord is a little unusual, but I think it could work towards making your chord progression a little more interesting. It does make the key of this progression more ambiguous. A Bbsus4 chord would contain the notes Bb, Eb and F. Eb is technically outside the key of Dm/Fmaj, but not too far away that you couldn't still consider the progression to still be in that key. At the same time, introducing that Eb implies to some extent that you might actually be in, say, Bb major. I'm going to answer your question as if you're interested in a way to modulate from E minor to a progression that's essentially in D minor, but leans toward Bb major. \n\nNow, the secret to a smooth key change is to bridge the gap with chords that belong to both keys. So we need to use chords that belong to both Em and Dm. There is technically only one chord, C major. That doesn't give us a lot to work with, but let's keep it in mind. \n\nAnother thing we can do is to move through a \"transitional\" key just briefly, thus making the transition smoother. I would go with A minor, which is a natural part of E minor, the iv chord in that key. To get to Dm (the first chord of your new section) from there, just go Am - A(major or 7) - Dm. \n\nRemember how I mentioned the C major chord? The one chord  shared by the keys Em and Dm? You might consider using that too, to help smooth out the transition a little more. So I would try  something like this:\n\nEm - C - Em - Am  \nEm - C - Am - A(7)  \nDm - F - Bb(sus)  etc. \n\nEdit: or maybe stay in Am a bit longer, and make that second line:  \nEm - C - Am - C - Dm - A(7)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386000729", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I had a suspicion as to what it was and this was eventually confirmed by a neurologist in Manchester and I went to see a specialist in London who set up the Botox. He was the one who suggested Braille as it teaches awareness and sensitivity of the fingers. I also saw a hand specialist in Windsor who made me splints. I've switched to playing with a pick and have been doing ok playing jazz while in the background I've been rebuilding my technique. I can now play a tremolo with p e a i fingers.

He had just started a week or two prior, and he was also in the office early, trying to make a good impression. Anyway, he thought it would be a good idea to start up a fantasy football league in the office, so he sends out an email about fantasy football to everyone. **To e v e r y o n e.** The company is a huge, multinational corporation. He sent the email to every single employee, manager, director, VP, COO, etc. But more than that, he sent it to every single distribution list, so people were getting double, triple, quadruple emails. He effectively shut down the entire email system with a failed attempt to increase office morale.  Big boss comes in at 8, closes the door to his office, and sits at the desk. A minute later, I hear \"What the F?!\" He calls in the noob to his office. By 8:30, the new guy is walking out the door escorted by security. True story.\n\nTL;DR: New guy accidentally sends an email to the whole company, clogging up the system, is fired in one hour.\n\n**Edit:** Allow me to elaborate. The company I worked for is a pretty big global financial firm.  No transactions were done via email, of course, but a lot of information sharing (reporting, publishing) was on a pretty set schedule depending on the global markets. Pretty time sensitive. \n\nIn addition, the fantasy football league required a monetary buy-in, so in addition to clogging up the email system, the new guy was sort of \"soliciting gambling,\" which is a no-no, and he used \"company resources\" to do it, which is a double no-no (no-no no-no?). \n\nLast bit of info, this was back in like 2006, so I don't know if that makes a difference on the type of networks blah blah, I don't know a thing about IT stuff.\n\n**Second edit:** I mistakenly a word in the original post.

I thought you were beign rude to him and asking him for a link, I didn't think you were actually being serious when you thanked him.\"\n\nThat apology would be the correct thing to do, since you, whether purposefully or accidentally, provided me with the proof that you misunderstood me. Instead, what you are likely to do, is continue to beat a dead horse, like saying that I got downvoted for saying \"everyone's being a fucking dick\".\n\nWhatever makes it feel easier to not un-press that down arrow, bud.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386102938", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No real straight \"answer\" to this as pieces with complicated progressions may require the use of multiple scales. To give an example;\n\nImagine a piece is in E Minor and has the sequence Em DMaj GMaj AMaj. Playing in standard E Aeolian mode (A Minor: A B C D E F G) will be perfectly acceptable. However the last chord being an A Major is a little \"oddball\" chord as usually the 4th chord in a Minor Key is a Minor chord. However the A Major provides a \"lift\" towards the end of the progression. So over the last chord, I would base my melody/improvisation around notes form A Dorian (A B C D E F# G). The reason for this is that the C natural found in A Aeolian mode clashes wit the C# (3rd of A Major chord). The best thing to do is isolate the notes of each chord and cross reference them to the scales (helps if you know all the scales too ;) ) and figure out which ones to use.

Your ear is waiting for that resolution to the top C. To be in C major is not just a question of what the accidentals are, it means that C has a sense of *tonal gravity*. The piece will be drawn towards C in general, and will feel at rest when it's there. It obviously is a lot more complex than that - sometimes C won't feel restful, and sometimes other notes will.

C Major sounds Major when being played in the context of the Major tonality of C, or for want of a better way of saying it, a song or piece in C Major. \n\n\n\nThink of the first stage of the C Major box shape starting on 6th string 8th fret. (*Best tablature ever right here*...)\n\n|---------------------\n|---------------------\n|---------------------\n|----------------9-10-\n|--------8-10-12-----\n|8-10-12-------------\n\n\n\nPlaying around this box over pieces in C Major and A Minor you will find that all your notes are acceptable in *both* keys. However due to the nature of this box, you may find yourself leaning more on the notes C F and A so when playing over A Minor you may find yourself thinking \"this just sounds like I am playing the same thing\" which, theoretically you actually are.\n\n\n\nPart of \"changing\" the actual sound of what you are playing relies on the notes that you are \"leaning on\" when playing, AND the fact that straight Major/Minor does not bring any interesting notes to what you are playing.\n\n\n\nTo \"break out\" of the standard Maj/Min/Pentatonic shapes we must first analyse the chord sequence and the structure of each chord.\n\n\n\nLets look at another chord progression example.\n\n\n\nConsider this sequence in C:\n\n\n\n\n(|             | &lt;- represents one bar)\n\n\n\n\n|C Major C Major |C Major Bb Major| C Major C Major | Eb Major F7    |\n\n\n\nPlay through this sequence on your guitar to get a feel for how it sounds. Sounds cool right?, but seems to have a little \"twist\" to it. I shall explain...\n\n\n\nThe progression is very definitely in C Major (or some form of C Major... ;) more in a minute...).\n\n\n\nHowever, there are a few glaring anomalies to be found. The most obvious is that neither the note Bb or any chord of Bb are found within C Major. The other anomaly is that there is no Eb (or any chord of Eb) in standard C Major. The Major 3rd of C is E not Eb. See where this is going? If not, do not worry. All will become clear.. I hope!\n\n\n\nWe have yet more to address: another \"offender\" is our F7 chord (note that this is what is known as a \"dominant\" 7th chord although in this case it is not the \"dominant\"/5th chord). The \"7th\" in our F7 chord is an Eb (Minor 3rd of C) which screws our tonality in yet ANOTHER place. We have more Minor 3rds to deal with. However, the existence of the F chord in our progression is perfectly acceptable. Another problem is that the 3rd of our F7 chord is an A Natural.\n\n\n\nWant to quickly just say why this matters in relation to our \"choice\" of notes. It is not possible to play in C Ionian Mode (C Major) over the chords in this progression as there are notes that straight out clash.\n\n\n\nIdeally in this song we want the notes we \"lean\" on to be rooted firmly in C and that all the positions/boxes we choose to play in will allow us to play with a \"sound\" that could be said to be the sound of C. Despite what you MAY think at this point, this is perfectly possible. This is where we must leave behind the idea of \"modes are just scales in different places\" and detach ourselves from it.\n\n\n\nLet us look in detail at what is ACTUALLY GOING ON with our little song in C.\n\n\n\nOur first phrases of melody or improvisation over the course of our first two and a half bars we are free to play C Major Scale as we choose. Or are we?\n\n\n\nLooking ahead to the next chord we see our Bb Major which already is telling me one thing. Toss our C Major scale out, it's no use in this song. So what do we do?\n\n\n\nLook at the problematic notes. We have to find some way to still play in C but accommodate our B flat note which is too prominent to be ignored. We do this by playing in C MIXOLYDIAN MODE.\n\n\n\nC Mixolydian mode is C D E F G A Bb (C) and is essentially just a C Major scale with a MINOR SEVENTH (b7th for short). One note difference:\n\n\n\n|----------------------\n\n|----------------------\n\n|----------------------\n\n|----------------(8)-10\n\n|--------8-10-12------\n\n|8-10-12--------------\n\n\n\n\nCompare this to our regular C Major: \n\n\n\n|----------------------\n\n|----------------------\n\n|----------------------\n\n|----------------(9)-10\n\n|--------8-10-12------\n\n|8-10-12--------------\n\n\n\n\nPlaying around in C Mixolydian mode gives me the feeling that I am playing some traditional Celtic (Scottish) music. This is what the Mixolydian \"tonality\" is.\n\n\n\nSo we have established that our song is predominantly to be played using C Mixolydian. There is no reason to use C Major at all (even for our first 2.5 bars) as we do not want to suddenly \"jump\" to C Mixo. after a short time. Instead we should look to reinforce our tonality in the best way we can the first 2.5 bars, and play \"around\" the 7th (B flat) over our B flat major chord to really \"push\" or stress that we are NOT in C Ionian.\n\n\n\nNow while in practice, we could play in C Mixo. for the entire progression without sounding \"off\" or our notes sounding bad, lets consider the other \"outlaw\" notes from our remaining chords. \n\n\n\nTry the next ones yourself:\n\n\n\n1. Identify the notes which lie outwith the Key for the chords of Eb Major and F7 (I have done this for you, look further up).\n\n\n2. Cross reference those notes to the modes of C.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT:** What I mean to be the \"modes of C\" are often completely DIFFERENT to how \"conventional thinkers\" think and talk about their modes. \n\n\n\nA classical musician would consider the \"Modes of C\" to be C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian and B Locrian.\n\n\n\nHowever, I have taught myself to think about the modes in a different way. I have never met anyone else who thinks of this the same way as I do. My way of thinking places the actual TONALITY or \"sound\" of each modal pattern (regardless of key) as more important than the \"theoretical\" maths of tones and semitones that lies behind each. \n\n\n\nTo ME, modes of C are C Ionian, C Dorian, C Phrygian, C Lydian, C Mixolydian, C Aeolian, C Locrian. I find this MUCH more useful in terms of improvisation and composition as I can simply identify the notes of each chord, and quickly know which modes should be applied. Now it's your turn...\n\n\n\n3. Find the correct modes to be played. (Look down for answer if you get stuck!!!)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\nAnswer: C Aeolian and C Dorian.\n\n\n\nOur Eb chord does not lie in either C Major or C Mixolydian as both are major modes and Eb is a minor 3rd of C. So clearly our required mode shall be a minor one. It also contains no seventh or other \"outside\" notes. Just the \"triad\" Eb G and Bb. Cross reference that to our modes of C and we will find that **C Aeolian** mode is our best choice here.\n\n\n\nWhy? Well all its' notes including the passing tones fit amicably over the chord in question.\n\n\n\nC D Eb are all acceptable as either chord tones or passing tones, as are F G and Ab and Bb. There are no A naturals, B naturals or E naturals present in the chord.\n\n\n\nAs for our F7 chord...\n\n\n\nC Aeolian mode does not fit here because our F7 chord contains an A NATURAL. C Aeolian has an A FLAT. See what I'm getting at? So we are looking for a MINOR mode in C that has an A natural in it!\n\n\n\n**C Dorian** is the obvious choice to me. It is a minor mode, but is \"less\" minor than a straight minor (Aeolian mode) scale.\n\n\n\nBut why this mode?\n\n\n\nThe Eb present in our F7 chord again denies us our Major sounding modes as, like before, Eb would clash horribly with the E natural found in the Major modes of C. The A Natural clashes with the A flat found in C Aeolian mode.\n\n\n\nSo from our Eb -&gt; F7 transition we have a subtle \"lift\" in our tonality providing a nice resolution back to C Mixolydian when our chord progression repeats. This is pefectly fine as our 7th (Bb) has REMAINED CONSTANT throughout, it is present in C Mixolydian, C Aeolian and C Dorian.\n\n\n\nI hope you managed to figure this part out under your own steam. If you did not, then do not worry, it literally took me YEARS to understand the modes and develop my own method of applying them to music, which is what I have demonstrated to you here.\n\n\n\nI learned my way around the modes by turning the theory of their structure around to make them into something more useful and more applicable to creative playing.\n\n\n\nI hope this has been useful and interesting and I will gladly answer any other questions you may have after reading this.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386177309", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\nThe biggest thing I notice is that the drummer is all over the place and giving that crash a workout.  It will be impossible for the bassist to sit in the pocket and make a tight groove without some drumming changes, and that is a big part of why the song sounds sloppy.\n\nThe first thing I would do is recommend the drummer constructs a simple beat.  Basically you want three variants on the same beat, A, B, and C, each being one measure.  Then you can arrange it like A B A C A B A C then finish with an accent (like a crash) and start from the beginning.  \n\nWhat this will accomplish is it lets the rest of the group have a frame of reference for where they are, with that method of building a beat you should easily be able to know where you are in the song, which will make the everybody else have an *infinitely* easier time.  From there the rest of the band can build on it.  \n\nThe bassist needs to be able to do something similar to what the drummer did, but most importantly he needs to sit in the pocket to make it sound tight.  The bassist and rhythm guitar don't need to be playing the same thing, but they have to make sure it is complementary.  Playing in the same scale is probably the easiest way to do that.  \n\nThe lead guitar was not too shabby, but because there was no structure to the rhythm section it sounded a bit disjointed.  \n\nI hope my critique was helpful and make sure to keep it up!

Bind your spellbook to ` or something else easily within reach, sheathing your weapon to tab, and toggling the cursor to \"f\" or something, and you're all set.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, I find the dungeons legitimately frightening and dangerous; you can literally get lost for hours of real-world time (if not longer). The world is also refreshingly unforgiving and hardcore. In Oblivion and *especially* in Skyrim you're the most important person in the world. In Daggerfall you're just a pawn of powerful nobles and get the impression that no one would give a shit if you were murdered in the bottom of a dungeon somewhere.\n\nThere are some drawbacks, of course. The only practical way to get around is fast travel, as the world is so ludicrously enormous and procedurally generated that there's not much point in running around on foot. Villagers are extremely boring and a lot of the side quests are \"go kill four rats to get a pittance of gold and a few reputation points.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the game is frightening, atmospheric, jam-packed with skills and humorously unbalanced characters and spells you can create, and still immersive after all these years. You'll also never again run around cities that are *actually* city-sized (the world of Skyrim is home to, what, 150 people?). Plus the music is really enjoyable and memorable, too.\n\nAnd here's my obligatory plug for /r/Daggerfall.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386293898", "subreddit": "ElderScrolls", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yep. A good grasp on the construction of scales is critical to getting anything done.\n\nLearn as much about chord/scale relationships as possible - for example, a mixolydian scale (major scale with a flat 7, or the 5th mode of the major scale) matches up with a V7 chord in a jazz chart. For example, a G7 in a tune that's in the key of C would correspond to the scale G A B C D E F G. Other scale options exist, but that's the basic relationship. Understanding relationships between chords and scales is the first step to getting anything done as an improvisor. The literature on this topic is extensive - I've heard that Mark Levine's Jazz Theory Book is a good start. Jamie Aebersold's basic scale syllabus is my favorite chord/scale sheet, even though it's not especially thorough: http://www.jazzbooks.com/mm5/download/FREE-scale-syllabus.pdf\n\nOnce you've got a decent grasp on that, start transcribing solos from the masters and analyzing them in the greatest detail possible. Map out the harmonic relationships of the lines vs. the \"correct\" chords, examine phrase lengths, check out recurring motives... there's an endless amount of work to be done in the analysis of solos.

The problem is that it's also incredibly emotional. To get past the subjectivity, which can be crippling, you just need a little objectivity. What works for many people is to have some organizing principle in mind. This can steady you if things get so emotional you can't continue.\n\nSomeone else suggested organizing through age ranges, and that may work for some. Another way, perhaps more helpful, is to organize according to the seven cardinal sins. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins\n\nTo keep myself on track, I use the old memonic device, W A S P L E G. This works for me because it gives me a good opening: I don't have much Wrath, or much Avarice. The middle three are tough for me personally: Sloth, Pride, Lust. But I'm less susceptible to Envy and Gluttony, so the end's a little easier.\n\nThat's just one example of one way of organizing your thoughts as you prepare.

{"body": "[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1hf7sr/faq_question_what_are_modes/catut3e) in /r/musictheory does a good job of explaining what modes are, as well as an intuitive way of memorizing modes without having to work backwards to figure out the key and tonic of the original Ionian mode.  \nTo quote the comment:\n\n&gt;So without further ado, here are your diatonic modes, their names, and their intervallic relationships.\n\n&gt;-------------------------------------\nMajor scale| Ionian | W W H W W W H|  \n2nd Mode | Dorian | W H W W W H W|  \n3rd Mode | Phrygian | H W W W H W W|   \n4th Mode | Lydian | W W W H W W H|  \n5th Mode |Mixolydian| W W H W W H W|  \n6th Mode | Aeolian | W H W W H W W|  \n7th Mode | Locrian | H W W H W W W|  \n\n&gt;So this works. But it's a ridiculous way of memorizing these scales. The most important things to know about these patterns is how they relate to the major scale, and what they actually ARE. Let's dive into that. Let's look at Lydian. \n\n&gt;Lydian is the \"4th mode of the major scale.\" That is to say, it is all of the notes in the major scale, in the same order, just starting and ending on the 4th degree. So F Lydian should have all the same notes as C major. If we break down the notes, here's what we get:\n\n&gt;F lydian: F A B C D E F  \nCompare that to F major:  \n  \n&gt;F major: F A Bb C D E F  \n&gt;Notice that the only difference between these two scales is that the 4th degree is raised in F lydian? That's a much more useful way of memorizing what a lydian scale is. It's exactly like a major scale, but with a raised 4th. Let's do that for all the modes:\n\n&gt;* Ionian: Major Scale\n* Dorian: Minor scale, only with a natural 6th (as opposed to a lowered sixth usually found in minor).\n* Phrygian: Minor scale, only with a lowered 2nd. \n* Lydian: Major scale, only with a raised 4th.\n* Mixolydian: Major scale, only with a lowered 7th\n* Aeolian: Natural Minor\n* Locrain: Minor scale with a lowered 2 *and* a lowered 5. \n\n&gt;With the exception of Locrian, all these modes are just one note different from either major or minor. That's much easier to retain, and speaks to the *sound* of each mode.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386357881", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

You will be training your fingers to be more independent and more voices in different directions.\n*Play triads in different inversions (start with Major and Minor triads, different octaves and all around the fretboard). Play everything in the 12 keys, I use the cycle of 4ths: C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb B E A D G\n*Play open triads, example in C major from lower to higher: C G E\nC/E open triad: E C G   and finally C/G open triad: G E C... Study open Major and Minor triads in the 12 keys up and down the fretboard.\n\nI will be posting more video lessons on my Youtube channel. Thanks a lot once again.

{"body": "\n\nWhat’s really cool is how Donald is seemingly playing a character (THE BOY), whilst also being himself. For a long time, prior to the release of the album, Donald wore the same outfit as worn by THE BOY. Twitter has played a role in this, how Donald will go from an interaction like so …\n\n@DonaldGlover: i just saw u @chancetherapper say u were the hardest working. i beat u in push ups son… p u s h u p s\n@ChanceTheRapper: @DonaldGlover in the movie… Cause we were acting…. Nigga fuck you\n@DonaldGlover: @chancetherapper fuck me? you want to settle this? who can make the best EP by tuesday? skype pushups?\n\nTo …\n\n@DonaldGlover: inte någonsin väcka mig #roscoeswetsuit\n\nWhich translates to “don’t ever wake me”. The original language is Swedish of Sweden, where THE BOY visits in the script, yet, Chance’s interaction with Donald was definitely out of character (mentioning how it was a movie, and they were acting). Even in the short film “Clapping For The Wrong Reasons”, Chance mentions Donald by name. If “Clapping For The Wrong Reasons” is a 100% canon, then all the secrecy of THE BOY’s name is gone, so maybe it isn’t completely canon.\n\nIn the short film, at one point, someone enters the house and kicks their shoes off into a pile of other shoes. This is what THE BOY does in the script when he returns home from camp.\n\n~\n\nCheck out this awesome website here &gt;&gt; http://becausethe.com/what-we-know-because-the-internet/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386479783", "subreddit": "donaldglover", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

So they all contain those notes in the order CEG. The difference between the open C and the barre C is that it starts on a different part of the chord structure. A barre chord is the root @1, 5th@1, root @2, 3rd@2, 5th@2 root @3. Where @# is the octave of the scale. If chords were linear as the scales are you wouldn't be able to fret more than a couple of them as the others would be unable to be heard.

{"body": "I'm 22 and have been playing for about 11 years now. For a while when i was starting out I was obsessed with learning other people's songs. Then as i evolved I kind of became just as obsessed with writing and listening to my own music. Now I'm at the point where I've learned and written so much material that I've kind of realized that so many songs share the same qualities such as chords/progressions/keys. In a nutshell, I used to look at songs individually, taking way too much into consideration that each song has its own specific characteristics. For instance, if I learn/write a song with the chord progression E G C D, I've basically just learned every song that's written with the same progression, whether it be E G C D, or F# A D E, or A C F G (They're all the same progression just in a different key, use a capo and it'll be easier to notice). Even if the tempo or style is different, it is objectively the same song. In my opinion too many players are way too focused on playing exact notes and accents that they don't take a step back, break it down into a basic format, and look at the fact that they can attain a similar, almost identical result if they realize that they probably already know the song.\n\nTL;DR - I think the reason that you don't think you know these \"popular\" tunes is because you don't realize that you probably already know them; and since \"popular\" songs usually contain \"popular\" chord progressions", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386543706", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you play online your World Tendency should be fixed before long but if you're impatient take him on. He was able to one-shot me too but I still pulled it off. His moves are pretty easy to handle generally, usually just one two-handed attack or a couple single handed. If you're quick enough you can get in some backstabs here.  If you're really skilled you can even backstab chain him. So long as you can stop him from healing he's managable if not nerve-wracking.

{"body": "Okay with my first love I went through a situation very similar to this. My ex had a habit of having girl \"friends\" consistently throughout our relationship. We dated for about 3 years and there were 3 girls in which he acted inappropriately with. He wrote them letters(which, mind you, he had never done with me) went to the movies alone with them, and one girl he took to concerts with a looooooooot. One time him and his best friend(whom he referred to as pam beasley. I was an idiot for not realizing I needed to gtfo then) were supposed to go to this concert together. I didn't know about it. I found out through facebook. That is when I got up the courage to confront him and asked why he didn't really invite me to things, and how his bestie seemed to be more of a priority. He told me he f o r g o t about me. Again, I was a big dumb dumb and stayed with him because I was his first relationship, and he reassured me that they were just friends. Plus, love UGH. I don't know if anything ever happened with her but he did cheat on me later, with a different girl. \n\nThis particular girl, he referred to as \"friend\" every time I would call or text and they were hanging out. \"Oh I'm just hanging out with a friend.\" When his same sex buddies all had names. Anyway, he ended up telling this girl he was in love with her and he regretted all the time he spent dating me when he had all those \"unrequited loves\" he could've perused instead. When I found out, he told me that I deserved it because I was so jealous and insecure. I believed him for awhile after that. Once again, stupid.\n\nIf you are hearing alarm bells, and from what I've read here, It seems you have VERY valid reasons to be concerned, you need to listen to them. Trust your gut, OP.

This was the first 4 player game and it was B R U T A L. One. ONE! One early overbid on a plant knocked me out for the rest of the game. Didn't have money for resources or builds. I was really off my game. A later analysis with a PG-guru taught me that 4 players is the most cut-throat, and leaves very little room for error. I taught it to the 3 others, and they had a great time, and will def play again next time it's tabled. I'll whip out the Quebec map, and see how heavy emphasis on wind fares.\n\nQuick game of 2 player base **Dominion**. Won handily, and followed my plan of getting Curses into my opponents hand, and stocking up on Gardens to the win. Feels good, man. Feels good. Had a long chain of Market and Laboratory cards that only yielded 4 coins on one turn. That was crazy!\n\n*Sunday*\n\nOnly managed to get in one full game, **Firefly**.

I'm more confident to teach it, now, so it'll see play in future game group sessions.\n\nAn abbreviated game of **Smash Up**, due to time constraints, with a new player.

Thank you! \n\nAbout the 'verse-hook-verse' stuff: I actually don't understand why it's considered criticism against DG, as it applies to 98% of music worldwide. It's just an artifact of how music is being made and consumed these days. Is it also fair to criticize DG for all their songs being ~2-5 minutes long? Not in my opinion, because that's how long *every* song is, because that's just how long songs are these days. Changing things that are so basic about the musical landscape like that takes generations, and if you do it too fast, it just sounds like you suck at music. I don't mind the 'verse-chorus-verse' stuff in music any more than I mind most films being 90 minutes long and having three acts... so long as the *content* of the film is creative and interesting. \n\nIn regards to the synthesizer stuff... yes, they do use actual instruments to create actual notes and melodies. I wasn't trying to say that Death Grips NEVER uses melodies or anything like that, I was just saying it's not a priority for them like rhythm and percussion is. There are no synthesizer solos, for example. Guitar sounds are usually samples (Spread Eagle Cross The Block and Birds, especially) and highly processed. The phrasing of their melodies is interesting too, which is hard to explain... for example, I think Get Got is one of their most melodic songs, but I can't whistle it. The musical information is there, but it's bite-sized and looped, used only to 'color' the sound. It's not like, say, a Green Day tune, where they keep the same melody during the verse, chorus and goddamn guitar solo.

{"body": "1) This can be calculated using the binomial distribution. You can also logic through it by using a with replacement counting method. \n\nEasy way (binomial pmf)\n(n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution\n\nThe (n choose k) notation is a way to write the binomial coefficient. You can read about that here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient\n\nYou should get a really low value for this. \n\nNow instead of using the function you could just multiply the probabilities together because we are counting WITH replacement, but you have to add all the permutations by hand together. So how many combinations are there? Well, let 5 be when we get a 5, and x be when I get something else\n\n1) 5 5 X\n\n2) 5 X 5\n\n3) X 5 5\n\nSo there are three permutations which are acceptable. That gives us 3 * (1/5 * 1/5 * 5/6) \n\n2)So, because we're working with small numbers we can do this two ways. The first is we find the probability of two boys, and add the probability of three boys and then add the probability of having 4 boys, and then again add the probability of you guessed it, 5 boys.  \n\nSo\n\n(5 choose 2) * 1/2^2 * (1/2)^3 \n+ (5 choose 3) * 1/2^3 * (1/2)^2.... adding up all the cases where there are two or more boys. \n\nWe're adding up a lot of the spectrum here! After all once you take this option away all we're left with is the chance of only having 1 boy and the chance of having 0 boys! \n\n\nVisually:\n\ncase a G G G G G \n\ncase b G G G G B \n\ncase c G G G B B\n\ncase d G G B B B \n\ncase f G B B B B\n\ncase g B B B B B \n\nYou'll notice, the outer edges of all boys or all girls are very unlikely and the more balanced options are more likely. This makes sense because if you have 5 children, the average amount of boys and girls you will have is 2.5, since you have a 50% chance to have either.\n\nYou'll also quickly realize, that instead of doing 6 calculations where there are 2 boys or more, you could have just done two calculations and subtracted it from 1. \n\nAlso if you try to do it without the binomal like in part one you have to remember to do all the possible combinations again for each piece. \n\ne.g. \n\n\nCASE B\n\nG G G G B\n\nG G G B G\n\nG G B G G\n\nG B G G G\n\nB G G G G \n\nSo there's 5 permutations for case B. Then we do what we did before and get (1/2^4 * 1/2^1 )*5 = 5/32\n\nAnd you'd have to do that repeated for every case and then add up all the cases the boys are more than 2 ( or all the cases the boys are less than 2 and subtract that probability from 1). \n\nAs you can see, it gets really complicated really fast without the binomial distribution.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386672401", "subreddit": "cheatatmathhomework", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There's tons of great youtube videos and stuff but I always thought the best way to learn was to just do it and figure things out along the way. Obviously everyone learns differently but I always learned the fastest through hearing direct results. Obviously don't ignore the important stuff like technique and scales but make sure you're having fun so you don't lose interest. I would always get way more into bass when I was playing along with something and hearing the results as the bass is one of those instruments that is hard to sound good by itself when you're just starting off. \n\nI suggest once you get comfortable with getting a good sound out of your bass to try and just learn a song. Pick something you like, recognizable and simple. listen to it and try to play along. Find something simple that has only 1 or 2 progressions in the whole song (blues rock, pop punk etc) and just try to play along. Start with finding the first note, then the next.\n\n Don't worry about playing the exact bass line but just getting the root of the chord right. Most easy bass songs will literally only have 3 or 4 notes you play the entire song. You can look for tabs to help though I would recommend avoiding them because if you can learn to pick out progressions by ear, it will help you immensely as a player. I found people end up getting held back by tabs because they have a hard time making connections between progressions. If you're having trouble picking the notes out I recommend looking up the chords as opposed to the tabs. This will get you thinking in terms of notes and chords as opposed to tabs. So if you're jamming with some buddies and they say \" can you play a D A G for me?\" you can bust it out as opposed to fishing for notes on the frets and is much simpler than saying \" 5th fret A, Fith Fret E\" etc. If you can start learning simple songs you'll run across a lot of the same progressions and have more and more moments where it just \"clicks\" because you realize that your playing the same stuff.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386725643", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, in general, a greater understanding will only enhance musical ability.  You'd be hard pressed to find somebody that will say that learning what a 'key' is will not help you.\n\nThat being said, I think of a key as a musical context.  In a basic sense, if you're playing in the key of G, you know that G is the tonic, the key signature will have one sharp because the G major scale is G A B C D E F#.  Based on this scale, you know that C is the sub-dominant, and D is the dominant.  You also know that F# is the leading tone.  There are functions for each degree in the scale.  So if you're just jamming and you hear a I -&gt; V -&gt; vi -&gt; IV progression you know how to map this to actual notes and you might have a better idea about how to improvise a bass line or melody over that progression.\n\nYour question about what it means to have x number of flats and sharps in a key signature is just to signify what key it's in.  In the example above, 1 sharp means it's probably G major or E minor.  I could be wrong but you typically don't indicate modes via key signatures, but rather with accidentals.\n\nI do a lot of improvisation on guitar and I find that knowing what key I'm in to be incredibly helpful.  If I don't explicitly know the key, it's one of the very first things I try to figure out by ear because it gives me a structure to work with.  So if I hear that the tonic sounds like an E major chord, then I know that I can end phrases with a B -&gt; E progression to give a sense of resolution or I can use E -&gt; F#m to give a more romantic, whispy feeling (it's hard to describe, but I know it by sound).  On top of that, now I know which notes will probably dominate my melody.  I typically do acoustic rock / folk / pop style songs and very typically the melody will contain notes in the chord being played plus some passing tones.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386816890", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well it really depends on the client.  If the client prefers the message transliterated, this is the easiest.  I would actually use the idiom or minced oats because that client understands the terms and I'll allow the client to determine the true meaning.  Often in my experience when the client prefers a transliteration they more closely identify with the hearing American culture.  \n\nIf the client identifies more with deaf culture it's more complicated.  You always have options as an interpreter.  I would make a choice based on how this minced oat affects the message.  One choice is to not include the word or phrase.  If you decide to purposely omit this does it impact the message? Most times omission is looked down upon, but it is a choice and sometimes it's better to omit that small part that could arguably be less important to the intent of the message.  Especially if in trying to formulate that part of the message is using too much cognitive power and is negatively affecting the interpretation.\n\nI believe you were looking for concrete examples in how I would handle this interpretation in the most complicated instance.  I apologize for the sojourn into options but it's important to remember that you are constantly making choices like this when interpreting.\n\nSo to get at the crux of your question.\n\nSay someone stubbed their toe while I was interpreting and yells out \"oh fiddlesticks\"  and I was interpreting English to ASL.  In this situation I would probably just sign WOW and put agony on my face.  Remember that the client could see the speaker and I believe that interpretation would suffice.  \n\nIf the person said \"oh h e double hockey sticks\" I would probably spell h e l l because that's what the English participant would receive and I believe is an equivalent message.\n\nSomething like \"jimminy Christmas\" could be conveyed through non manuals and body language.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nIf you had a specific question or minced oat you can't think of how to sign just reply here with in what context you imagine it happening and I'll put in my two cents.

{"body": "&gt;FinCEN are about aiding in the detection and deterrence of money laundering and terrorist financing. I believe that their approach to this is that Caldwell ends up as an unsuspecting middle-man in an inefficient and rather expensive tumbler. Person A sends him 50 BTC money from an address to be split up into 45 1BTC coins, each with their own address. He asks that these coins be sent as \"gifts\" to Persons B C D E and F. It's a possibility to launder, and that is really what their focus is.\n\nThanks this is a good explanation of their stance. I think it is quite ridiculous though. I really don't buy their argument. If one was trying to tumble their coins, this would not be the way to do it. You have no guarantee that the coins you send Casascius aren't the very same ones he makes into physical coins he sends you. So the link might not be severed. The blockchain still betrays the path of the coins. Add to that, the large fee, and the turnaround time, and it sounds like possibly the worst way to 'launder' coins.\n\nThere's no reason to go to such lengths either, when its trivial to mix coins from a computer, like [here](https://blockchain.info/wallet/send-shared) or [here](http://sharedcoin.com/), with low fees and pretty instantaneously. And these systems are actually designed to be good mixers, unlike Casascius.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386960758", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You realize that a gigantic portion of those teams you mentioned have had much more success than the Isles have?  I'm aware that they have made the playoffs.  I mean, we haven't made it past an 8th seed in over a decade.  So technically, lower half of the league EVERY year.  And I specifically said we haven't WON a playoff series in 20 years.  For a salary capped league... that is ABYSMAL.  You do realize this is the longest current streak in the NHL right? \n\nSo... let's see here.  You threw in a team that made the freaking SUPER BOWL.  The Jets made the AFC championship TWICE in a row.  And had won playoff rounds numerous times under Pennington.  The Lions went through a long period and are now getting good again.  We are not.  The Bengals were good for a period with Carson Palmer.  \n\nThe Oilers again, made the FRIGGIN STANLEY CUP.  Florida won their division recently, they also made the FRIGGIN STANELY CUP within the last 20 years.  And this is team that is only twenty years old.  They were a freaking expansion team and have gone further than us.  Phoenix?  Uhhh yeah they are pretty good.  Not sure if you've seen their record, or the fact that they have competent ownership now.  They also made the Western Conference Finals recently. Again, basketball -- sorry the Knicks, Kings, Hawks, and Warriors (especially now) have had some success in the last twenty years -- MUCH more than the Isles.\n\nBaseball is very difficult to compare given that there isn't a salary cap, and in this time period, only 4 teams made the playoffs.  The Mets have won rounds.  The Marlins have won friggin WORLD SERIES. \n\nMaybe you think twenty years is some arbitrary number.  I think it is a nice neat number that should show some peaks and valleys.  I agree with you that you listed some teams that have been pretty bad for a while (Pirates, Raptors, etc.).  But now, compare the success of these teams versus the ridiculousness of some of the crap that goes on in the joke of our franchise:  \n\nSpano incident, worst arena in sports, terrible attendance, RDP fiasco, our owner looking into sumo wrestlers to be a goalie, buying out Yashin, firing Milstein, Mike Milbury, the terrible trades surrounding Kvasha and Parrish, moving to an arena that is not made for hockey, salary FLOOR circumvention, lowest payroll in sports, Lafontaine incident, Chris Botta incident, Ted Nolan incident, etc.  \n\nI think you brought up some good examples, but I think my point still stands.  Between lack of success (not winning a playoff round in a sport where over half the teams make the playoffs), and the absolute facepalm off-the-ice crap that goes on with this team -- yea, this is one of the biggest jokes in sports.  The fact that some of the candidates it goes against are expansion teams kind of proves my point.  \n\nSo, what do you think?  We are NOT a joke?  Middle of the pack?  Bottom 5?

{"body": "I'll copy and paste the guide I wrote on the [Harmonized Major Scale](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1p9bsj/my_guide_to_the_harmonized_major_scale_and_roman):\n\n**1.  The Harmonized Major scale**\n\nLet's take a look at the C Major scale again.  It contains the notes:\n\n**C D E F G A B**\n\nWe can harmonize these notes to create chords.  These chords will all be diatonic to the C Major scale.  Diatonic means 'in the key' so simply put, every chord we harmonize from the C Major scale will work in the key of C Major.\n\nTo create the chords, we start on any note in the scale, skip the next note, use the next note, skip the next note, and use the next note.  If we start on a C note we get:\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A B\n\nThe notes **C E G** make up a C Major triad chord (triad simply means 3 notes).\n\nIf we start on the D note we get:\n\nC **D** E **F** G **A** B\n\nThe notes **D F A** make up a D Minor triad.\n\nIf we do this for every note in the C Major scale, we end up with the following chords:\n\n**C Major**\n\n**D Minor**\n\n**E Minor**\n\n**F Major**\n\n**G Major**\n\n**A Minor**\n\n**B Diminished**\n\nThe quality of the chord (major, minor, or diminished) will always be in the same order no matter what key you are in.  So in the key of E Major (E F&amp;#9839; G&amp;#9839; A B C&amp;#9839; D&amp;#9839;), the diatonic chords are:\n\n**E Major**\n\n**F&amp;#9839; Minor**\n\n**G&amp;#9839; Minor**\n\n**A Major**\n\n**B Major**\n\n**C&amp;#9839; Minor**\n\n**D&amp;#9839; Diminished**\n\nThis is the reason you'll see many songs have chords that go to the same type of chords.  Songs in the key of C Major often will have an A minor chord in them.  Songs in E Major will often have a C&amp;#9839; Minor or B Major chord in them.  This happens because the chords are all diatonic.  Simply put, the chords just work well together.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**2.  Roman Numeral Analysis**\n\nLet's assign a Roman Numeral to each chord in the Harmonized Major Scale.  The Roman Numerals for the Harmonized C Major scale are:\n\n**I - C Major**\n\n**ii - D Minor**\n\n**iii - E Minor**\n\n**IV - F Major**\n\n**V - G Major**\n\n**vi - A minor**\n\n**vi^o - B Diminished**\n\n*NOTE:  The ^o symbol denotes that the chord is diminished.  Also note that major chords have uppercase Roman Numerals (e.g. IV = F Major) and minor and diminished chords are lowercase Roman Numerals (e.g. ii = D Minor)*\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**4.  What About Minor Keys?**\n\nThe vi chord of any major key (e.g. A minor in C, C&amp;#9839; Minor in E, etc.) is what's known as the *relative minor* of the major chord.  A Minor is the relative minor of C Major.  C&amp;#9839; Minor is the relative Minor of E Major.\n\nWhat this means is that both keys contain the exact same chords.  The key of A Minor contain the exact same chords as C Major.  The only difference is that the numbers are changed.\n\nSo if we are playing something in the key of A Minor, the Roman Numeral analysis would be:\n\n**i - A Minor**\n\n**ii^o - B Diminshed**\n\n**III - C Major**\n\n**iv - D Minor**\n\n**v - E Minor**\n\n**VI - F Major**\n\n**VII - G Major**\n\nAgain, the quality of the chords (major, minor, diminished) does not change if you change keys.  They will always be in the above order in a minor key.\n\n**5.  What's the Point of these Roman Numerals?**\n\nOver the years, musicians created these Roman Numerals to use as a type of shorthand for communicating chord progressions.  Rather than say \"The chords are C Major, A Minor, F Major, G Major\" you could hear something like \"It's a I vi IV V in C\".\n\n*NOTE:  You would literally say \"It's a one, six, four, five in C.\"  If a minor key is not specified it means it's in a major key.  Otherwise, you would say something like \"It's a one, six, four five in C Minor.\"*\n\nThis system was done for a few reasons.  The most important being that you can change the key of a song easily without having to rewrite the entire chord progression.  In a studio situation, a vocalist might have a particular vocal range that they feel more comfortable with.  Using the Roman Numeral system, you can easily change a song from something like C Major to F Major to better suit the vocalist's range.  Or in a big band situation, it may be easier for certain instruments to play in certain keys.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**6.  Common Chord Progressions**\n\nIf you start analysing songs using the Roman Numeral system, you'll quickly see that there are many chord progressions that are common to a lot of tunes.  The only difference is that they've changed the key.  Below are a few examples.\n\n*The I IV V*\n\nThis is the typical blues progression.  You've heard it thousands of times.  You've also heard it in many pop songs ([The Sweater Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHQqqM5sr7g) is almost entirely a I IV V IV).  \n\nAs usual, it's played in a variety of keys.  \n\n*The I vi IV V*\n\nThis one can be heard in all sorts of songs as well.  [Run Around Sue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jefJpr-3no) uses it in C.  [D'Yer Maker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xmVEqp17DU) does it in C as well.  The Beatles do it in [Octopus's Garden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRu-oEwA0Ec) in E.\n\n*The ii V I*\n\nThis is the most common chord progression in Jazz.  It's what's known as a \"turnaround\" (i.e. a way to get back to the I chord).  [Fly Me to the Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtFBRJFN3p8) uses it to get back the C Major chord (Dm-G-C).  Miles Davis does it in [Tune Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiSDqJIQk8k) to get back to the D Major chord.\n\nIt's literally everywhere in Jazz music.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nI hope this helps some of you.\n\nI'm planning on doing another one of these posts after this that introduces 4 note chords in the Harmonized Major Scale, Extended Chords, and a basic introduction to chord progressions that get out side of the diatonic scale.\n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1387029491", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 133, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "ok you fool, its quite simple. let me spell it out for you.   **it makes no difference**  unless of course you're as poorly educated as you appear to be.  \n\nAs for \"conventions\", you halfwitt.  The point i made was your incorrect use of the term.  Its a convention, less popular than other conventions (**note correct English**) i grant you, but any student who is not aware of it, SHOULD KNOW IT.  Once you understand it, you realise it makes no difference.... that's what you are lacking.  Along with a poor grasp of meaning of the word convention.  If you understood it you wouldn't say dumb things like \n\n&gt;majority of the convention\n\nIt's like talking to a 5 year old. \n\n&gt;Learning circuit analysis came naturally to me.\n\n**Clearly not since this particular convention by your own admission, confuses you!**  Now you're claiming it comes naturally to you? ROTFLMAO!\n\n\nAs for the rest... WTF does the Navy have to do with it? LOL, you're pathetic attempt to try and give yourself some kind of credibility is really laughable.  Clearly you are a poorly educated, immature little shitkicker.  If you had half the brains you were born with, you'd be dangerous.  \n\n&gt;...schematic diagram makes little to no sense and makes it harder for people to figure out it all out...\n\nIt's certainly harder for **you** to figure out, that much is obvious over your butthurt over this convention.\n\nNow, the site does an excellent job of justifying its usage of this convention; as it clearly states....  (read this bit S L O W L Y you smega-filled rent boy)\n\n&gt;In conventional flow notation, we show the motion of charge according to the (technically incorrect) labels of + and -. *This way the labels make sense, but the direction of charge flow is incorrect*. In electron flow notation, we follow the actual motion of electrons in the circuit, but the + and - labels seem backward. Does it matter, really, how we designate charge flow in a circuit? Not really, so long as we're consistent in the use of our symbols. You may follow an imagined direction of current (conventional flow) or the actual (electron flow) with equal success insofar as circuit analysis is concerned. Concepts of voltage, current, resistance, continuity, and even mathematical treatments such as Ohm's Law (chapter 2) and Kirchhoff's Laws (chapter 6) remain just as valid with either style of notation.\n\n&gt;You will find conventional flow notation followed by most electrical engineers, and illustrated in most engineering textbooks. Electron flow is most often seen in introductory textbooks (this one included) and in the writings of professional scientists, especially solid-state physicists who are concerned with the actual motion of electrons in substances. These preferences are cultural, in the sense that certain groups of people have found it advantageous to envision electric current motion in certain ways. Being that most analyses of electric circuits do not depend on a technically accurate depiction of charge flow, the choice between conventional flow notation and electron flow notation is arbitrary . . . almost.\n\nIt's clearly explained, for anyone (with half a mind) to read and understand.  They even take the time to explain further, the differences it will make to the reader.  You should read it, because clearly you were not given any depth of understanding regarding this whatsoever.  So again, i ask you... what so fucking hard about that cupcake?  **The REAL WORLD isn't necessarily like you were taught (as this discussion clearly shows), a convention is just that, but the actual physics is REAL WORLD, and needs to be taught!  Right from the get-go.  After you are made aware and understand it, you're free to use whatever convention you like!**\n\nPS.  \"The navy\"....  I'm still rotflmao at that. \n\nPPS.  As for the topic, I'll remind you of what the OP said.... first sentence!\n\n&gt;So in striving to learn the basics of how circuits and electricity work\n\nLike i said, if you don't explain to a student that the convention you're about to teach them does NOT actually reflect true electron flow, you're doing your students a disservice.  It needs to be taught you halfwitt.  **The fact that *you* don't like it is irrelevant!  I'm actually not overly keen on it myself, but i can't change how the universe works i just accept it, and so should you!**  :-/\n\nE2A:  Make sure you read that text before you make it worse for yourself. :/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387050686", "subreddit": "arduino", "score": -5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "the point of countering irrational thoughts is to create new mental habits instead of thoughts that create trigger fear themselves or come along with the fear.\n\nThe trick to get them to stick - that is feel real in my gut not just in the logical bit of my mind that recognized the thoughts and physical sensations of fear were irrational - is to combine the counter thoughts with physiological calming so my body would start to believe them. \n\nLike you I can think at the irrational thought all day long but the fear response remained. It was only after I finally had therapists who taught calming techniques and constantly reminded me to use them every day in as many situations as possible. Over time I became less anxious in general and less reactive to situations.\n\nThe easiest thing to start with is abdominal breathing. it sounds stupid but it really does work if done regularly. with more severe and long standing anxiety disorders it might take many months of daily practice as it did with me. Every time you have a rise in anxiety with or without a thought do at least 5 deep breaths into the belly making them last as long as you comfortably can. Exhaling though the mouth puckering like you are blowing up a balloon or though the teeth seems to make the calming effect stronger but if this is a public situation just do deeper than normal breaths s l o w l y. \n\nNotice your jaw or other body part is tensing? Do belly breaths until the tension level drops or at least 5 breaths. \n\nwith practice I found I could do the breaths and continue to do most activities for better effect.\n\nHave a anxious thought? Do minimum 5 breaths or belly breath until you feel calmer. \n\nHave angry/mad/sad/other intense emotion(s) - belly breath. minimum 5 breaths or until calmer.\n\nanother good trick that can stop panic attacks, PTSD flashbacks, and help dissociation/derealization for most is to notice and name 5 things you see, 5 things you hear, 5 things you can touch. Do this w/the breathing. Then name 4 things you see, 4 you hear, 4 you can touch trying not to repeat items. Then name 3, then 2, then 1.\n\nnaming things switches the brain's energy from the fear center to higher brain function which usually stops a panic attack. using it when you notice sensations that indicate your body is ramping up to the attack is even more effective.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387055986", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I will start with this:  last I checked, this was a forum about music theory.  Thus refering to things from a theoretical analysis perspective would likely be the defualt terminology used as it is the default terminology of music theory.\n\nI will now address my first, apparently controversial statement.  When I said that they were acurately described as adds, I was refering to the analytical perspective (where sus chords are not actually a thing).  When I said it was ok to call them sus chords, I was refering to a notational perspective.  Again if this was not clear, I'm sorry.\n\nTo demonstrate the difference between chord naming notationally and analytically I will give a few examples.\n\nFirst, take the following common progression:  D Dsus4 G\nNotationally this is correct and we are done.\nAnalytically this would become:  G:  V I where the g in the Dsus would be noted as an anticipation. \n\nNow let's take this example:  F Csus4 C\nAgain, notationally this is correct and we are done.\nAnalytically it becomes:  C:  IV I with a note indicating that the f present in the Csus4 is part of a 4-3 suspention.\n\nHere's one with a 2 instead of a 4.  Say we have the following notes in a chord:  a e a b e\nNotationally this would likely be called an Asus2.\nAnalytically this would be called one of a few possibilities:  neutered Aadd9, A5add9, Aadd9(3), or Aadd9no3.\n\nLastly I will address your implication that the sus always refers to a chord with no 3.  Here is an example of a common guitar voicing for Csus4:  c f g c e\nNote the presence of the e (which is the 3 in a C major chord).  This chord would still properly be called a Csus4 (or sometimes just Csus) because the sus only refers to the presence of a 4 (or sometimes 2).  I will definitely give you that if a guitarist were to see a Csus4 there is a good chance that they will voice it c f g c f, thus completely substituting the 3 with the 4, but that does not mean that sus in the chord name only refers to chords without the 3. \n\nEDIT:  fixed a bad typo", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387061247", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Logically due to his abilities build him with mana.  This means get an early tear and continue building towards that.  Practice last hitting with his Q for stacks.

Nothing amazingly new for Drake, but really really good Drake. Love it.\n\n**Kimbra - Vows**\n\nTerrific Jazz-Soul album with a pop-infused sound.

The first half of this EP was very strong with a unique sound and terrific commentary. Most people don't like the second half as much but its still an excellent debut album from this chick.\n\n**Compton's Most Wanted - Music to Driveby**\n\nOne of my favourite records ever, pure gangsta shit to its core. Pushed gangsta rap to new heights and the social commentary resonates still to this day. Another classic.\n\n**Shabba Ranks - Greatest Hits**\n\n*SHABBA!*\n\n**The Internet - Feel Good**\n\nAnother perfect album for lazy Sunday's, and its free! Great feel-good vibes as the title may suggest, download it and give it a spin!\n\n**Self Titled - PARTYNEXTDOOR**\n\nFind a plane ticket come riiight now, South Beach where the sun gooo down. What can I say, great record for the night time exploits as you would expect ;)\n\n**Jhene Aiko - Sail Out**\n\nAbsolutely love Jhene, terrific release with a solid length as to not trying to do to much but delivering on expectations. Features are brilliant.\n\n**Armand Hammer - Race Music**\n\nAll I have to say is if you haven't heard this. Get it, listen to it and enjoy it! Straight hip-hop with some great messages that everyone should hear.\n\n**Yung Lean prod. by Yung Gud - Kyoto**\n\nBanger.

{"body": "Losing my wedding ring at Burning Man. \n\nI play a fragile steel percussion instrument (YouTube search PANArt Hang) and just before leaving [early -- I'm a parent] my friend and I rode our bikes out to the Temple and I played for people for a couple hours. When I play I take my ring off to avoid dinging the metal, and I hung it on the hook end of a bungee cord I had stuffed in my small camelbak backpack. \n\nNormally I let (encourage) people to [gently] play my instruments, but on the playa I was paranoid about the corrosive effects of the playa dust on steel and being v e r y careful. There was one fellow at the Temple though who was clearly in a very altered state and he could not keep his hands off... so I ended up packing up and biking home somewhat abruptly.\n\nAfter biking at least a mile or mile and a half across open playa I got back to our packed up car and as I was loading my bike on the bike rack after saying good byes I had 'that feeling' of my finger being naked. Looked down and realized I'd never put my wedding ring back on at the Temple.\n\nRipped off my camelbak and looked at the bungee cord. Both ends empty.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; THAT MOMENT &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n\nI was at the Burn without my wife, who was graciously watching both our kids -- she took one for the team because I'd ended up with a free ticket two days before the event because I jokingly posted about how I'd grudgingly go if someone GAVE me a ticket (90 seconds later I had a free ticket courtesy the infamous Chicken John Rinaldi... but that's another story). \n\nBurning Man has been pretty important to my wife and I, collectively we've gone for almost twenty years to almost every Burn together, and only since we have had kids have we really ever gone apart or not gone at all. Indeed, we were symbolically married at the event a few weeks before our 'family' wedding more than ten years ago.\n\nOur rings were custom made with a symmetrical wave design done by overlay; each of our rings has one half of the overlay.\n\nSo... even if it were replaced, such a replacement would never be the same.\n\nIn half-numb, half-abyssal dread, I borrowed a bike and retraced my path across open desert as well as I could, eyes glued to any irregularity. Yet that year like several recent ones had been quite dry and there were 'drifts' of flour-fine dust in snakes everywhere. When I got to the Temple I did a widening circle search pattern around the area I'd been playing in on my hands in needs, hands often covered by the fine dust broken up by all the foot traffic.\n\nMaking my way back an hour or two later as the sun started down, empty handed (so to speak) to camp and the waiting car, I idly wondered whether my ring, were it in the temple, would be completely evaporated or merely melted into slag by the conflagration that was going to envelop the entire Temple in less than 36 hours. Or, if in the foot-by-foot sweep of the event site over many months, a clean-up person working DPW might hypothetically find it before rains wet the surface enough for it to sink for twenty thousands years...\n\nBack at camp in dead monotone I explained what had happened to a few friends and asked them to put a message in at Lost &amp; Found in case of a miracle.\n\nAt the car, I slung my now drained camelbak off for the last time and started stuffing it into the back of the car. Doing so I mechanically checked the bungee one more time. Nothing.\n\nPulling the bungee out and pulled the small 'pocket' portion of the pack off the water carrying bit. The two are connected at the bottom, but unconnected at the top, and the 'walls' of that space (where the bungee was stuffed) have nylon criss-cross laced cord. The only other thing in the pocked was my flask, at this point a quarter full of top-shelf Islay smokey single-malt.\n\nThere at the bottom of the crevasse, I saw that my flask had pinned one-half of my ring. The other half stuck out through the nylon criss-cross at this point, into empty space.\n\nPicture of my reaction taken 15 seconds later available on request. The file is aptly named Unfucked.jpg.\n\nTwinned morals of the story:\n\na) the Playa will provide; and\n\nb) ALWAYS carry your whisky flask. ALWAYS!\n\n\nTL;DR: lost custom-made wedding ring at Burning Man, recovered through 'chance' (sic) operation of Playa magic.

{"body": "&gt; I suppose S-expression based notation is really good to write a syntax tree, but a programming language is not a syntax tree. Haskell is closer to me where you should try to omit brackets if it's possible.\n\nOmitting brackets in Haskell comes down to the 'semicolon as seperator syndrome'. Often if you later need to edit an expression and you have not bracketed every single sub expression you callously add something and you get a parse error or worse, a bug. It's what you got back at the time where expressions were not terminated by separated by semicolons, you add a new one and you forgot to add another semicolon and the parser goes mad.\n\nIt happens so often to me in Haskell that you go back to replace one operation by another or add a new function and the operator praecedence screws you over because it suddenly generates a completely different parse tree, I would say that explicit delimitation of every single sub expression is something that makes code both more readable to human beings and machines. If you have something like\n\n      a * b * c * d * e * a + c\n\nit only becomes apparent at theend that the outermost operator is in fact addition. However in the case of:\n\n    (+ (* a b c d e f a) c)\n\nIt becomes apparent at the start what the logical structure of the expression is.\n\nHaskell is actually laden with situations where adding an expression later can generate a completely different parse tree which you didn't expect, ever seen this idiom:\n\n    list = \n        [ \"foo\"\n        , \"bar\"\n        , \"baz\"\n        ]\n\nIt's funny how people invented such a weird idiom which looks ugly, the obvious reason is of course to more easily deal with the fact that commata can't be trailing and stop things from going wrong if you add or delete a line. Not a problem in Scheme of course:\n\n    (define lyst (list\n       \"foo\"\n       \"bar\"\n       \"baz\"\n     )\n\nOr how having a reasonably complex numerical expression and then add some point realizing you forgot to multiply it by 2pi, not to worry, just add `* 2 * pi`. But oh wait, without realizing you just warped the operator praecidence to a completely different one and the bug you get now is even more confusing.\n\nUsing mathematical textbook notation as a template for a computer program is in my opinion a really big mistake. Mathematical textbook notation was never \"designed\", it was evolved over 200 years by different authors, it's inconsistent, laden with abuse of notation, and was never meant to be able to be quickly edited like a computer program.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387201236", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Many ISPs have been compelled to install some form Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to comply with their local laws to combat child pornography, assist drug investigations, and just keep their networks running fast and smooth.  Now, I can`t speak specifically for Germany, but the United States requires all ISPs to have the capability to scan all data flowing through their networks against  a list of known child pornography websites.  However, DPI is not limited to finding child pornography.  Rather, it is a shorthand for a variety of technologies which can be used find anything within your data stream.  [Link for more info](http://www.priv.gc.ca/information/research-recherche/dpi_index_e.asp). \n\nMost ISPs throughout the world use DPI not only for law enforcement, but also to make sure that data is flowing efficiently through their network.  This practice, known as `shaping`looks for customers that are using a large amount of bandwidth and then `throttles`their traffic down to what they deem to be an acceptable level.  In 2013 it is now very difficult to tell who is a pirate vs. a streamer based solely on anonymized traffic patterns.  Instead, the ISPs have begun to use DPI to regulate usage [Link for more info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_throttling)\n\nWith this in mind we can break down your question into three parts.  \n1) How do they know that you are torrenting?  -DPI technology is used for a variety of purposes, one of which is to limit (throttle) traffic which they consider to be against the law or Terms of Service. \n2) Will changing the title make a difference?  -  Many countries maintain a list of content which ISPs are required to monitor; mostly related to child pornography.  The list is not based on name, but rather on the unique attributes of the file- so renaming it will have virtually no effect if it is on one of these watch lists (I`m not familiar with \"An Evening of German Porn: Now Harder but I doubt that it would make the cut).\n 3) How to they attain the knowledge:  In many countries, ISPs are just one division of a larger company.  Even if the larger company isn`t a media producer directly, many of them have other divisions (cable, PPV, etc) which profit on the content that you are stealing.  They have a vested interest in making sure that you don`t steal it because they want the opportunity to sell it back to you.  Beyond the direct trade, ISPs (and all comms companies for that matter) are required to comply with the laws of the local jurisdiction because network infrastructure is heavily regulated by the state.  There is really nothing to disincentivise them from passively, or even actively (if they chose) rooting out filthy pirates (except for privacy laws and constitutional rights- but good luck trying to litigate a technology case before a judge who still types H T T P : / / before every URL)\n\n(I`m sure that I`ve missed a huge amount here- this is an extremely new and complex area of the law that we`re talking about) \n\nTL;DR: 1) DPI sees all 2) ISPs have to use DPI to comply with the law 3) Most ISPs are close partners (if not partially owned) by large media producers", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387210772", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The buttons really helped free up my left hand and avoid awkward button presses. While this isn't necessary, I've had it for about 2 weeks and I feel it changed my life.\n\n* Also, if you haven't already, change the control scheme to Legacy, this will have A and D make you run in that direction, and S make you run backwards (instead of tip-toeing). When the fight begins I left click an empty part of the screen and hold the button. Now it controls like every other video game on earth since the mouse is used for looking and turning.\n\n* I then set up the row closest to the front of the mouse be my main 3 stance combo (Dragon Kick, Twin Snakes, Snap Punch).\n\n* The next row down was what I normally swap out in situations, but always align the buttons with the stance like above (Bootshine, True Strike, Rockbreaker. This allows me to swap Dragon Kick and Twin Snakes easily when optimizing my combos and always have Rockbreaker for AOE when necessary.\n\n* The next row is my DOTs (Demolish, Touch of Death, Fracture).\n\n* The last row of buttons is my Fist Stances (Fist of Fire, Fist of Earth, Fist of Wind).\n\n* The mouse has 3 buttons on the top which allow you to change the buttons by holding it down. I use these to drop in Howling Fist, Shoulder Tackle, Arm of the Destroyer, etc.\n\n* Finally I set up Q (Steel Peak), E (Internal Release), R (Second Wind macro which will run Mantra first then Second Wind, so I spam the button when I need heals but can also use it to Mantra a group), F (Defensive Skills like Featherfoot, again I macro this so each time I press the button I get a defensive skill, putting Haymaker in the front), X (Perfect Balance), and V (Invigorate).\n\nFor the layout, I have 4 hotbar rows on the bottom and arranged by button order, the right half of the hotbar is for the Shift Buttons (when holding down the 3rd Mouse Button). I then have a 5th hotbar to the right of my character and load it up with my Q E R F X V triggers. \n\nI also make the font a little bigger on my chat window to help avoid some tunnel vision.\n\nI put the Target health bar about an inch above my character's head as well so I can see their status effects and what attacks they are about to do without having to move my eyes. \n\nI hope this helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387222155", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll tell you everything I wish they told me in high school. Get Ready. Large block of text incoming!!\n\nA lot of people here have recommended you run out and get a real book (the fifth and sixth editions are considered the most reliable, and you can find them as pdf's on the internet). The real book is a collection of lead sheets which are song notations that include only chords and melody. The real book includes \"jazz standards\" - i.e, well known songs by jazz musicians - and \"standards\" which are songs that weren't necessarily written by jazz-writers but have been adopted into jazz cannon.\n\nI don't know how much you know about playing lead sheets so I'll give you the run down (otherwise skip this): excluding any intros or outros, the top of the melody is called the \"head\" of the tune. The run through of the melody from beginning to end is called the \"chorus.\" A tune can take a variety of forms (know the classic AABA, but also recognize the 12 bar-blues, ABC, ABA, and other forms). In jazz, the head is played once or twice and then the chorus is repeated again and again as jazz musicians improvise over the song’s chord progression, referred to colloquially as the \"changes.\" The true heart and soul of jazz is not merely playing the melody, but improvising over the changes.\n\nIn order to play over the changes of a tune you need three things: proficiency in your musical scales, the music theory knowledge to identify when to employ those scales, and a lot of heart and creativity. I’ll go over these one by one.\n\nFirst, let’s start with scales. Practicing scales probably makes you think of playing your major and minor (Aeolian) scales up and down and up and down relentlessly. Jazz musicians conceptualize scales differently. Here’s what I mean by that. Many jazz musicians believe that for every chord, there is a scale of “best fit” to play along with it. In this sense, scales are like an available “pool” of notes that you can use on a chord. Every chord/scale pair has its own particular sound. So which scales am I referring to? There are only technically 29:\n\n1)\tThe 12 major scales and their modes\n\n2)\tThe 12 melodic minor scales and their modes (different from the Aeolian natural minor that you’re used to hearing. It is essentially the major scale with a flat 3)\n\n3)\tThe diminished scales (Also called the “Whole-Half” scale since it is built off alternating whole and half steps. For example C D Eb F Gb Ab B C. There are only 3 of these scales)\n\n4)\tWhole tone scales (Simple enough. There are only 2 of these scales)\n\nThese scales will get you through the changes of 99% of tunes out there. By the way, when I mean the “modes” of a scale, I’m referring to the greek modes (google these. You got to know them). The idea is that if you start a scale on a note different than the root, than you get a “new” scale. It might seem trivial at first but this way of thinking helps jazz musicians a lot. Also, when practicing these scales, play them musically. Don’t just run them up and down. Play them in 3rds, 4ths, 5ths. Play them backwards. Come up with your own licks and riffs. Get these sounds in your ear!\n\nSecondly, you’ll need to know when to employ these scales. Unfortunately, if you’re not used to reading chord symbols, you’ll have to do some learning on your own since I don’t really have time to explain them now. So starting with the major scale, I’ll list the mode, and the appropriate scale, and for clarity, I’ll give you the example in the key of C.\n\n1)\tIonian\t---\tmaj7\t---\tC D E F G A B C\t---\tCmaj7 (or CM9,C Δ,C6/9)\n\n2)\tDorian\t---\tm7\t---\tD E F G A B C D\t---\tDmin7 (or Dm7, D-7)\n\n3)\tPhrygian\t---     m7\t---\tE F G A B C D E\t---\tEmin7 (Em7, E-)\n\n4)\tLydian\t--- \tmaj7\t---\tF G A B C D E F\t---\tFmaj7\n\n5)\tMixolydian   ---   \t7\t---\tG A B C D E F G\t---\tG7\n\n6)\tAeolian\t---\tm7\t---\tA B C D E F G A\t---\tAm7\n\n7)\tLocrian\t---\tm7b5\t---\tB C D E F G A B\t---\tBm7b5 (B-7b5, or Bø7)\n\n\nAnd the melodic minor modes (keep in mind, jazz musicians only consider the first half of the melodic minor, since the scale changes when being played back down in classical music.)\n\n1)\tMelodic Minor ---     min(M7)\t---C D Eb F G A B C\t---\tCm (maj7) (or Gm6/9)\n\n2)\tDorian b2\t---\tmin7\t---\tD Eb F G A B C D\t ---       Dm7 (or Dm9 ect)\n\n3)\tLydian Aug.  ---\tM7(#5)---\tEb F G A B C D Eb  ---\tEbmaj7(#5)\n\n4)\tLydian Dominant---\t7(#11)---\tF G A B C D Eb F\t---\tF7(#11)\n\n5)\tMixolydian b13---\t7(b13)---\tG A B C D Eb F G   ---\tG7 (also Harmonic Major)\n\n6)\tLocrian #2\t---\tmin7(b5)---\tA B C D Eb F G A\t---\tAm7(b5) (also half-diminished)\n\n7)\tAltered\t---\talt\t---\tB C D Eb F G A B\t---\tB7alt (or B7(#5 #9))\n\n\nNotice that when you come across a m7(b5) chord, you have the choice between the major Locrian, or the minor Locrian #2. Also, there are short-hand formulas for deriving all of these scales and modes! Like for the lydian, its a major scale with a sharp 4. See if you can't try to come up with your own formulas!\n\nTwo other scales of interest are\n\n1)\tWhole Tone (6 notes)---\t7+\t---C D E F# G# Bb C\t---C7+\n\n2)\tDiminished Scale---\t°\t---C D Eb F Gb Ab A B C\t---C°\n\nI should also mention the blues scale since it’s used often in jazz. The blues scale does not derive from any scale, nor is it even found in any classic western music. It is essential a minor pentatonic scale with a passing half step note between the 4 and 5. It is used when playing a blues (that is the ENTIRE blues. i.e a blues in Bb will use the Bb Blues Scale for all of its chords)\n\n1)\tBlues Scale\tBlues\t\t---1 b3 4 #4 5 b7 8\t---\tC Eb F F# G Bb C\n\nThere’s also this thing called the Bebop dominant scale. Hebrew Scales. Egyptian Scales (something Miles Davis used in his early career) and a ton of others that I you can find out on your own.\n\nIn addition to the scales listed here, you should also be able to identify common chord progressions that appear in jazz. The holy grail of progressions in jazz is the ii V I (If you don’t know Roman numeral notation you should take the time to learn it).\n\nThe ii V7 I is extremely prevalent in earlier 1940s, 50s, jazz. In classical music, you’ll know it as the dominant cadence. It works like this. Anytime you see a minor chord followed by a dominant chord and ending on a major chord, you know you have a ii V I progression. For example\n\n/D-7 \t/G7\t/ Cmaj7\t/\t---\t/Cmin/\tF7\t/Bb 6/9/\t---\tand so on.\n\nAccording to our chord/scale theory, you would be able to play the Dorian scale on the ii, the Mixolydian on the V, and the Ionian on the I. Since these three scales are all techinically modes of a major scale, you can just blow a major scale lick of any major ii V I you find! (e.g C major for the first example and Bb major for the second).  Arpeggiating in 3rds and then moving up or down the scale will almost always drop you off on a chord tone (i.e the 1st, 3rd, 5th or 7th)\n\nYou should also know of variants of the ii V I, such as the harmonic major ii(b5) V I and the minor ii V I variants (Dm7b5  G7  Cm,  Am7b5  D7alt  Gm(M7)). For the minor ii V I, there is not a single scale you can use, but you can get away with the harmonic minor scale (major scale with a b3 and b6) to outline the chords (outline = playing chord tones).\n\nThere are also common progressions called turnarounds that function as ways of looping the ends of songs back to the beginning (iii VI ii V I and the I IV II V ect). There are also tunes in jazz that have been so influential that the chords to such songs have become well known progressions. Some of these songs include “What is this thing called Love?” “I’ve Got Rhythm,” and the 12-Bar Blues. There are also well known progressions coined after the musicians who used them (e.g Bird Blues, and Coltrane Changes). \n\nLastly, if you understood none of what I’ve written about above, the most important thing you should take from this is the following: Jazz is about freedom. It is about jamming with your friends. There are two quotes that I always keep in mind in whenever I’m playing:\n\n“Learn the changes and then forget them.” (Charlie Parker). What he meant is that all of the theory, the technicalities, the chord/scales are not what you should be focusing on. When you hear a recording of a jazz musician, they are not consciously thinking “Blues scale, Lydian on the maj7(#11) chord, than a pattern blah blah.” They internalized all of these things years ago. They are playing lines as fast as they can think of them and what they’re playing is coming from the heart.\n\n“There are no wrong notes in jazz” (Art Tatum?). Even with all this chord/scale theory and fancy greek names, no one can tell you what’s right and wrong in jazz. If you’re slick, you can get away with playing anything. Let your ears and your own tastes be your guide.\n\nIf it helps to know, I’m only 18 and graduated high school last summer. I never had anyone to help me with stuff like this and had to find out the hard way (after sucking at concert after concert). I truly believe that jazz is accessible to anyone that wants to learn it, and what I just gave you is only a snippet of what jazz is about. If you’re interested in other readings, I would recommend “Patterns for Jazz” by Larry Coker to practice to and the “Jazz Theory Book” by Mark Levine, as well Aebersold Play-Along Volumes. Also the \"ireal pro\" app is a great for making your own chord progressions for your own practicing purposes. Good luck with your playing bro!\n\nedit.

{"body": "Absolutely playable, and easier than you think! It's the measure after that's much trickier. You're on the right track splitting up your hands, that's the only way it would be playable. The next measure is doable, but much harder to figure out a good fingering. My first stab at it would be something like (starting on the beginning of the second measure in the right hand): 2 3 5 4 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 2. I'm sure that's not the best option, though, it would take some time to figure out a good one.\n\nSo here's the trick to being able to play it quickly and smoothly. You can't be thinking about playing each individual note. You should not feel like your fingers are working at all, you'll feel like you're playing with the weight of your upper arm *through* your fingers. It's very hard to describe in words, this is one of the reasons that people on this subreddit always tell you to get a teacher in person, because it'll be 1000x easier to explain a concept like this. But here's how to practice it:\n\n* Break the music down into hand positions. By that I mean this: you know how you've grouped up that first measure into 4 notes for the right hand, 4 for the left, and so on? Each one of those groups of 4 is a hand position, a set of notes that a hand plays without (significantly) moving. So the hand positions in the first measure would be D F A C (right hand), D F A C (left hand), D F A on top with your right hand, and however you have it coming down, probably D F A C left and A C right. How you split up the second measure will depend on the fingering you choose, just remember to group together the notes that your hand plays without pivoting over, or moving up or down the keyboard.\n\n* Practice those hand positions in blocks. So, play them all as chords, and don't worry about timing or tempo at first. Just play the D F A C with your right hand, then the one above it with your left, and so on, playing each hand group of notes all at once, even if you play them more than once per hand position like at the top of the first measure. The goal of this is to internalize the way your hands 1) move across the keyboard and 2) change shape, without worrying about the timing or the dexterity to get the individual notes. You'll want to stay on this step until you can go smoothly and easily through the whole run this way, and at a speed resembling the actual performance tempo. Obviously you won't be able to line it up precisely, because the hand positions don't always fall on the beats, but that's fine! This is a purely physical process we're working on.\n\n* Now it gets tricky. For each individual hand position, start breaking up the notes. But remember what I said at the beginning, and don't think about each note in the position. Try to envision it as one unified physical gesture. For the D F A C's going up the keyboard, think about rolling each hand from the D to the C effortlessly, but putting a little bit of physical effort in to make sure that the notes do sound separately and evenly. For the one at the top, you might think of wiggling your hand back and forth, since it has to from D up to A and then back down. This is the real challenge, finding the physical balancing point between being so relaxed that everything gets mushed together, and tensing up your muscles so much that you wear yourself out and risk injuring yourself. It's as much a mental game as anything else, finding the right imagery to encapsulate how it *feels* to play it right. I might as well emphasize again that a good teacher will be able to work wonders in getting you to feel this. When you haven't felt it before, it's extremely hard to try and find that feeling yourself. Our words can only do so much to describe it.\n\n* Once you've got the individual groupings down, you can start chaining them together. Don't tackle too many at once, work in groups of two. Once you can do twos comfortably, try to do three, and so on. Make sure you always stay relaxed and loose, not tensing up and trying to force the notes out. Don't worry too much at the start about adhering to a strict tempo - try to just keep the notes sounding as *even* as you can. You can gradually start trying to keep it in time, figuring out where the beats lie in the patterns, etc, but it's important to start with getting the physical aspect right. Once you've got that, it's just a matter of putting your hands with the beat. Don't start too slow, though, because the slower you go, the more you have to play each individual note rather than thinking in gestures like I talked about.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions. Like I said a couple of times, it's exceedingly hard to describe in text what it feels like to play this sort of thing right, and you may be misled by people or videos who can make it work by muscling it out and thinking note-by-note instead of gesturally. There's three problems with that:\n\n1. If they're playing on a keyboard, chances are that inconsistencies in volume and articulation will be much less evident than they would be on a real piano. Those mistakes tend to get covered up on electronic instruments.\n\n2. If you ever want to tackle some serious classical music, that approach won't cut it. In the overall scheme of things, the music you posted is relatively simple and easy. I know it may not seem that way, but I think I could probably play that run pretty close to the way the video sounds with 30 or 40 minutes of work, and I'm not *that* great a pianist. I swear I'm not trying to brag, just saying that if you do want to eventually play things like Chopin ballades or Rachmaninoff preludes, it'll be absolutely essential for you to develop the concept of learning I'm outlining.\n\n3. Toughing it out is unhealthy. If you play the way I'm describing, without tension anywhere in your body, you can comfortably play for hours and hours. It's not a question of building up crazy piano muscles, it's a question of using them the right way. If you tense up your hands and try to force yourself through it, you're running a very real risk of getting tendonitis, carpal tunnel, or something similar. If you ever feel a sharp pain in your hands or arms, **stop immediately**. I can't emphasize that enough, I know people who have put themselves out of commission for years by playing in unhealthy ways.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387305186", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

Listen to pretty much any pop song with a bass guitar in it, and you're likely to hear the bassist play a pentatonic fill or turnaround.\nA pentatonic scale has five notes in it.\nIn a major pentatonic, the notes are:\n\n    1 2 3 5 6\n\nTo work out the actual notes, take your 1 (call it C for simplicity) - this is your root. Then find the second, third, fifth, and sixth of a major chord and you wind up with:\n\n    C D E G A (C)\n\nThe minor pentatonic is:\n\n    1 b3 4 5 b7\n\nAnd the notes for this in C are:\n\n    C Eb F G Bb\n\nThere is a strong relationship between these two scales but it's most obvious when you write out the scales not as intervals to the root, but as intervals between each consecutive note, like you would with an 'ordinary' scale.\n\nThe Major Pent. looks like this: \n\n    C(Tone)D(Tone)E(b3)G(Tone)A(b3)C\n\nTone, Tone, b3, Tone, b3.\n\nThe minor is\n\n    C(b3)Eb(Tone)F(Tone)G(b3)Bb(Tone)C\n\nb3, Tone, Tone, b3, Tone\n\nNotice how if you start the major pentatonic on it's last note, (in C that would be A), you are playing the same intervals and note relationships as the minor pentatonic. Try playing the major pent scale around for a bit, in C. Just up and down one or two octaves, whichever is easiest. Then, play exactly the same scale, but start and finish on the A - instead of C D E G A C A G E D C, play A C D E G A G E D C A. Now, rather than playing a C Major Pentatonic scale, you are playing an A minor pentatonic scale.\n\n\nNow, I need someone else to carry on cus I have to go to work and have confused myself too much...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387362893", "subreddit": "basslessons", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "natural minor is the minor scale.\n\nHarmonise means to get a couple of notes together simultaneously to produce harmony / a pleasant sound.  Triad means 3 notes, typically refers to the basic major / minor chords.\n\nSo the \"Natural Minor Scale Harmonized with Triad Chords\" is a fancy / slight odd way of saying a harmonised form of the minor scale, i.e. minor scale harmonised together to make triad chords.\n\nSimple was is to pick every other note in the scale and work through the notes for example, C major:\n\n   C D E F G A B C D E F G A B\n\nFrom C you get\n\n    C \n    C E  \n    C E G  (C major triad)\n    C E G B  (C maj7th)\n    C E G B D... and so on for more of the extended chords in this position, i.e. Cmaj13 is the last one.\n\nthen can do the same for every other note of the C major scale , i.e. from the D, E F.. etc.  \n\n    D  \n    D  F\n    D  F  A  (D minor triad)\n    D  F  A  C  (D min7th)\n    D  F  A  C E..... and so on everton\n\nYou can do this just the same with A minor.\n\nIf you dont know how to name chords, i.e. what is a 1 3 5 or 1 b3 5 then you need to look into that now.  There are plenty of informations on the internets about that. \n\nIf you do that for C on each note you'll hit the first line of what you said:\n\n    C|Dm|Em|F|G|Am|Bdim\n\nDo 4 notes for the same thing but with the 7ths, do more notes for 9ths, 11ths, 13'ths etc.\n\nSo in the Key of C thats your chords.  You could refer to this as stacking major / minor thirds ( the intervals of 4 or 3 semitones, check the distance between each note)\n\n\nFor A minor, note how the chords are the same as C major.\n\nLong story short A minor is in the same key as C major, look at the notes of A minor and compared them to C major, they are the same but from A not C.  This is breaching \"modes\" and there is no need to go into that yet.\n\nAs an aside the whole explain it like I am 5 thing I find a very arrogant way of asking for help. It may be cultural differences but from my perspective its like someone is asking for my/others help/time but is also telling me to dumb it down and spoon feed to them as they can not be bothered putting any effort into understanding any of the help.\n\nI generally breeze past these posts that ask for help like that because it annoys the hell out of me and often no effort is put in asking for help, i.e. just explain this rather I'm here trying this and stuck on that.\n\nI'm not having a go or anything, just ranting randomly at the whole explain like 5, I took the time to answer your one as it genuinely seems you have put some effort into trying to understand / seek help.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387377660", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's the same process as harmonizing the major scale.  Here's an excerpt from [my guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1p9bsj/my_guide_to_the_harmonized_major_scale_and_roman):\n\n**1.  The Harmonized Major scale**\n\nLet's take a look at the C Major scale again.  It contains the notes:\n\n**C D E F G A B**\n\nWe can harmonize these notes to create chords.  These chords will all be diatonic to the C Major scale.  Diatonic means 'in the key' so simply put, every chord we harmonize from the C Major scale will work in the key of C Major.\n\nTo create the chords, we start on any note in the scale, skip the next note, use the next note, skip the next note, and use the next note.  If we start on a C note we get:\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A B\n\nThe notes **C E G** make up a C Major triad chord (triad simply means 3 notes).\n\nIf we start on the D note we get:\n\nC **D** E **F** G **A** B\n\nThe notes **D F A** make up a D Minor triad.\n\nIf we do this for every note in the C Major scale, we end up with the following chords:\n\n**C Major**\n\n**D Minor**\n\n**E Minor**\n\n**F Major**\n\n**G Major**\n\n**A Minor**\n\n**B Diminished**\n\nThe quality of the chord (major, minor, or diminished) will always be in the same order no matter what key you are in.  So in the key of E Major (E F&amp;#9839; G&amp;#9839; A B C&amp;#9839; D&amp;#9839;), the diatonic chords are:\n\n**E Major**\n\n**F&amp;#9839; Minor**\n\n**G&amp;#9839; Minor**\n\n**A Major**\n\n**B Major**\n\n**C&amp;#9839; Minor**\n\n**D&amp;#9839; Diminished**\n\nThis is the reason you'll see many songs have chords that go to the same type of chords.  Songs in the key of C Major often will have an A minor chord in them.  Songs in E Major will often have a C&amp;#9839; Minor or B Major chord in them.  This happens because the chords are all diatonic.  Simply put, the chords just work well together.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nYou can do the same thing for the E minor scale:\n\n**E F&amp;#9839; G A B C D**\n\nThat gives you the chords:\n\nE Minor\n\nF Diminished\n\nG Major\n\nA Minor\n\nB Minor\n\nC Major\n\nD Major", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387378107", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1. Robert Glasper Experiment - Black Radio 2: One of the greatest young Jazz pianists, everything Glasper makes is golden. Just Fuck, I can't deal with this album it's so great. When I first heard Black Radio 1 I was hooked. This album, takes all of the great stuff from Black Radio 1 and continues it in such a innovative way. One of the best Jazz bands out there.\n2. Thundercat - Apocalypse: Every song on this album is a killer. Thundercat blends funk, electronic, jazz, and blues so well in this album. Every song has a unique sound world, and the performers are on point as always.\n3. My Bloody Valentine - MBV: As a lifelong fan of Shoegaze, I've been waiting for these guys to release an album for years. Took me a few listens, but I think it's one of the best projects yet. While staying true to the original goals of the band this album presents a new image of shoegaze rock. So many colors and textures this album definitely blew me away.\n\n4.  Pierre Boulez - Complete Works: Although this album is more of a complete collection of the works of the composer, a lot of the are hard to find in any store, so having them all together is great. I certainly had a few disagreements with a few of the recordings they chose (interpretation and what not) I was excited to re-approach some of my old favorites and to listen to some pieces I hadn't listen to before. Definitely a difficult listen, but I was, as always, blown away by the incredible talent of Boulez.\n\n5. The Flaming Lips - The Terror: as a life long fan of the lips to say I was excited for a new album is an understatement. I was incredibly surprised with the dynamic shift in focus from the last album. The use of electronics in this album is incredibly innovative. The mood of the album also demonstrates the Lips' shift to a much darker mindset.\n\n6. Board of Canada - Tomorrow's Harvest: I've loved this band since Geogaddi, so I was pretty ready for some new material. Definitely lived up to the hype. It's exciting to see some fresh, inspired material in the IDM genre. Also, I found the motivic unity of this album to be pretty refreshing. It's more of a larger piece than a collection of smaller pieces.\n\n7. Atoms for Peace - AMOK: I don't think I need to convince too many people here of this albums merit haha. Honestly though I was more excited about Fleas contribution here. I'm a huge fan of his collaborations and this album shows he really embraced his love of traditional Electronique Musiche and IDM. Just a great listen.\n\n8. The Flaming Lips - Peace Sword EP: When I found out the Lips were writing a song for Ender's Game I could not believe it. One of my favorite bands and one of my favorite Sci-fi novels combined! Madness. This EP, which takes the mood and sounds of the first song and spreads it across an EP. It is kind of step back\nfrom the work in The Terror, but it is nonetheless a well written work!\n\n9. Kaija Saariaho - Passion De Simone: Saariaho is one of the greatest living composers. Her blend of Choir, Orchestra, and Electronics is masterful. This piece sets the works of the french philosopher Simone Weil (one of my favorites) in such an incredible way. I can't say enough good about it!\n\n10. B L A C K I E - Fuck the False: EP from the Houston based rapper B L A C K I E, I can't get enough of this album. It shows considerable improvement from his work on GEN, and I thought that album was the tops. He blends so many different genres into his music (Jazz, Rap, Funk, Folk) he's really a refreshing artist. Plus he's local!

Each person is holding the hand of the person to their left. The person at one end squeezes a hand and the person whose hand was squeezed squeezes the next person's hand and so on until everyone's hand has been squeezed. I have just described a *series* circuit to you. \n\n                         O o o o o o o o [End of line]\n\nNow imagine that there are two lines that behave just as the last line did except for a minor difference. The difference is that we have one  robot who is standing centered between both lines and at one end of the lines. This robot is holding the hands of both of the people at the end of the two lines. This robot squeezes its hand and starts the chain of hand squeezing. The robot can only squeeze both hands at once or none at all. This is pretty much a *parallel* circuit. \n\n                         O o o o o o o o  [End of Line 1]\n                       /\n             [Robot]\n                       \\ \n                         O o o o o o o o  [End of Line 2]\n---\n\nImagine at the end of the lines is either an LED or a camera and once everyone has squeezed hands and the squeezing reaches the end, the LED or the camera turns on, depending on which line you are looking at. If you took the *series* line for the LED and put it before the *series* line for the camera, the camera could never turn on unless the LED light was on because the power (squeezing) has to go through the LED before it can turn on the camera. In practice, there are other concerns such as how much power can the LED take, how much does the camera need, etc. that require more elegant ways to solve this problem than the simple method that I just described. Regardless, it is very possible and not difficult to design at all.\n\n                         O o o o o o o o [LED] O o o o o o o o [Camera]\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387419029", "subreddit": "apple", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First question: do you know how to read guitar tabs?\n\nThey're actually pretty simple. The horizontal lines represent guitar strings, and the number written on the line represents which fret you play. Since the frets on a guitar neck are 1 half step (1 semitone) apart, basically the number represents how many half steps the note is above the note that would play if the string were open. In fact, a \"0\" usually represents playing a string that is open. So that explains the lines and numbers. The main other thing to know is that time proceeds left to right on tab, usually without any strict meaning, you're just supposed to figure out by ear what is an eighth note or whatever.\n\nSo, the tab you posted starts with this:\n\n    e---3-----3-3\\5-3--3--------3-3\\5-3--\n    b---3-----3-3\\5-3--3--------3-3\\5-3--\n    g---0--------------0-----------------\n    d---0--------------2-----------------\n    a---2--------------2------3----------\n    E---3---2----------0-----------------\n\nAt the very left, where it says \"e b g d a E\", are the notes that each string is tuned to. From top to bottom of the page, these go from highest to lowest pitch. Musically, it makes more sense, usually, to read from the bottom up, that is from the E string to the a string to the d string, all the way up to the top e string.\n\nSo, let's figure out what the first chord is. The leftmost column of numbers (from bottom to top, 3 2 0 0 3 3) forms a single chord, so what notes are in it? Well, on the \"E\" line, there's a 3, so move 3 steps up from E. That takes you from E to F to F# to G. So the bottom note of the chord is a G. Moving up to the second string, you start with an A, but add 2 half steps, which takes you from A to A# to B. On the third string, D plus 0 steps is D.\n\nAt this point, you can guess it's probably a G major chord, because its bottom 3 notes are G, B, and D. The rest of the notes bear this out. The fourth string is a G, the fifth string is B plus 3 half steps which makes D, and the sixth string is E plus 3 half steps which makes G.\n\nSo, the first chord is G B D G D G, which is a major G chord. Now just repeat with the rest of the tab. :-)\n\nOne sort of shortcut you can use to play a tab on the piano is to actually just put touch fingers on the piano keyboard at the starting notes for the open guitar strings, i.e. put your left hand on E, A, and D, and put your right hand on G, B, and E. Then look at the number for each string, and where a guitar player would move their finger up the guitar neck by that many frets, you move your finger up chromatically that many piano keys instead. This puts your fingers in the right position to play that chord.\n\nThere's a bit more to it than that, but you should be able to at least get through the song that way. The tab has a few special notations available, like the backslashes you see used, which indicate that the guitar player's fingers slide to a new position on the guitar neck while notes are playing. Since you can't do that on a piano, you have to approximate it. So there are some things that don't directly translate. Another thing you'll run into is that what sounds good on a guitar doesn't necessarily sound great on a piano. Ideally, you sort of adapt the piece a bit to make it sound better, but that takes practice.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387447071", "subreddit": "MusicNotes", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not sure how to answer your question exactly so I'll just say how I play Undying and explain why I do certain things. This is completely a pub solo queue explanation btw.\n\n(1) Depending on your lane, you will buy different starting items.\n\n* Defensive Tri - Stout, Tengo, 2 clarity, courier OR 2 branches\n\nYou are not farming, you will upgrade the courier so the other support can get wards, you are harassing with your Q and any right clicks you can get in but keeping enough mana to drop a level 2+ tombstone should a fight break out\n\n* Offensive Tri - Same items, though you probably want the two branches over the courier. Consider also purchasing an additional tengo or a salve in place of branches. This really depends though, 2 GG branches can be all the difference.\n\nYou are not farming, you will very likely upgrade the courier, the assumption is that in an aggro tri you are going to take part in kills and either get kill gold or assist gold, no reason for you to not be able to ugprade courier and still get boots / magic stick at a reasonable time.\n\nThe big difference now though is that you are actively looking to trap the other team in a tombstone (once it hits level 2, NEVER INITIATE with a level 1 tombstone, only use defensively and even then try not to). You are going to be trying to zone people, attack the creep stack with your other support.\n\nYour tombstone is a very big deal, don't just drop it whenever you get startled or every time it's off cooldown, you want to *trap* people in it. And part of having such a big skill so early is the enigma black hole effect. You can just dance around essentially threatening to drop it, and they have to take into account you can. If they see you blow it on stupid things all the time, they won't fear it, and you lose your lane presence.\n\n* Dual lane (farming) - Stout, Tengo, Salve, branches (Or switch the salve and a branch for a Ring or Prot, if you want to build a basi)\n\nIf you are farming, you want to shoot for arcanes, magic stick (not wand), and either a vanguard or mek (mek is probably better). You want to tank up and be a super buff meat bag for mid game pushing. You can opt for a soul ring or basillius too if you want, I'd probably advise basi over soul ring though. Basi's nice beacuse you can turn it into a vlads which isn't a bad pick up on him after you've gotten your core (arc boots +tank item +stick)\n\nOnce again, you are exploiting your lane presence. Casting decay to give yourself more tankiness / damage while making opponents more brittle. But you always, always, always, keep mana for a level 2+ tombstone. If you need mana at any point your support should be nice and give you a clarity. Try not to burn through them though, keep in mind the laning phase lasts quite a while and they need to spend money on courier / wards / boots.\n\n* Dual Lane (not farming) - Same as trilane items.\n\nYou're basically doing what you did as a tri lane. Adapt your strategy on whether or not you're dual combo is stronger than the opponents. You are still a force to be reckoned with, but you may need to play defensively to guarantee your carry some farm. Try to zone the other hero(es) out of exp range, but if you can't or are taking too much harassment, just chase them away from last hit range. You may want to get wards depending on the lane you end up in, communicate with your team if they want you to or not :P\n\n(2) Skills\n\nGenerally, regardless of what lane I'm in, I tend to do this (I'm sure people will disagree and completely endorse other opinions!)..\n\nq e e w w r e e q q r q w w..\n\nNow, it's very situational. You ideally want to get level 2 tombstone online as soon as possible. But if you don't grab decay at level 1, you're lane presence is pretty gimped. You don't have a way to harass outside of auto attacks. I think level 2 soul rip is amazing early on, \n\nSoul rip is awesome! I agree with you! Having it skilled to level 2 is in my opinion superior to decay skilled to level 2 for the early game. You can secure kills or give, yourself or your partner, a really big second wind! I find that by the time you need to soul rip, if you dropped a tombstone you have max targets on it (usually).\n\nI read a little bit and it seems you have a hard time knowing when to soul rip. Let me put it this way: When a fight is happening and you need to secure a kill or save a teamate. If a fight isn't happening, you don't want to waste the mana. Give them a tengo, tell them to buy regen items, like, you shouldn't be wasting that mana outside of a fight or you won't be able to drop a tombstone and decay and soul rip when your lane NEEDS it.\n\nOne thing you mentioned too, being worried about harassing with decay because of low mana. You don't necessarily need a basilius, by all means, after you've grabbed boots, you can opt for that instead of a wand, but that's why when you're not the one farming you **NEED** clarities. And you **NEED** to not get hit by something while using a clarity.\n\nUndying's strength as a farmer comes in mid game for pushing, it's really hard to take him down. His strength coming in as a support is that he's quite possibly the best low level hero. While he won't win a 1v1 fight with Ursa, he's strong in his own way. Forcing people to back off or fight inside a tomb. You zone people away from you, or they are forced to fight a rather unbalanced fight against you AND your lane combo.\n\nRemember, when you go to your lane, think to yourself \"I'm the most badass person in this lane right now, if they want some of this they can have it\" Just.. you know.. stay close to your team so they can actually help you. You're like 1.5 a hero, you can still lose 2v1, or 1v1 to an ursa cause fuck ursa, but you get the point.. I hope.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have specific questions!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387479987", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

WHen I was young, my parents were involved in a pentecostal church that went on a \"chase out the demons\" tangent. This would have been directly after the record burning/backward masking age - a lot of churches were involved in this, spanning a variety of denominations. I can remember one afternoon my Mom went around casting demons out of e v e r y t h i n g - demons of nicotine, demons of unrest, demons of dust. You name it, she was on a righteous bender. And while I know her intentions were good, I can honestly tell you that in those months, more strange - dare I say, downright sinister - things happened in that period of time than possibly any other time of my life. \n\nWhile I don't believe that your experience is necessarily that (and CosmicDuder really did sum it nicely), the adage \"Seek and ye shall find\" equally bears a particular truth. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387504531", "subreddit": "occult", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Going up 2 frets raises the pitch by a \"Whole Tone\" or a \"Whole Step\". All scales are made up of these \"half steps\" and \"whole steps\" in different orders.\n\nFor instance, the C major scale is C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. That's Whole Tone, Whole Tone, Semitone, Whole Tone, Whole Tone, Whole Tone, Semitone.\n\nNow, you can assign each note in the scale to a number: since it is the C scale, C, is 1. D is 2; E is 3, etc.\n\nMajor chords are formed on the 1st, 4th, and 5th scale degrees (in this example: C, F, and G) by skipping the next note in the scale and including the next note in the chord.\n\nFor example, in a C major chord, the notes are C (the 1st scale degree), E (the 3rd scale degree); and G (the 5th scale degree). The E is what makes the chord Major. If you dropped the E by a semitone (it would be called Eb), the resultant chord would be C minor.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nIf you have any more questions, or want clarifications feel free to ask.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387504568", "subreddit": "ukulele", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

My Sec 2 Chinese teacher who was also Languages HOD said I could opt for CLB which definitely reduced my academic burden.\n\n I assume you already enough subjects (excluding Chinese) to account for your L1 R5, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nCLB is a piece of cake, and as background info, Chinese isn't even my Mother Tongue, hence my horrible Chinese grades. It allowed me to focus on my other core subjects, in term of mental stress as well as freeing up time. And thus for O's I got 8 points raw, 6 points nett, accounting for CCA points, and entered JC.\n\nAs to how to convince your parents, I think /u/infinitus_ is pretty much correct. But moreover maybe you could tell your parents your personal perspective. I know how it probably feels to have the O Levels, your ticket to JC in your case, hinging on the possibility that you could fail your Chinese. And it's really very scary. Maybe it's not about being rebellious but rather personally taking sensible actions to minimize risks. \n\nAs for your last question. You need a Mother Tongue to get into JC, and simply getting a Pass or above for CLB (and I can assure, is really easy) fulfills that requirement. \n\nFor additional info, in JC, you can also take CLB.

Let's say that when you exercise discipline, when you compel yourself to think or not think, do or not do, anything specific, you drain the battery.

You've been deliberate so that it's become a habit and you might feel that itch, you might get restless.  That's just a battery charge indicator.  It is of no consequence.

For example, suppose partner has\n\nS: K Q J x x x\n\nH: x x\n\nD: Q x x\n\nC: x x\n\nThis hand has at most one entry as a dummy in notrump, so 3NT is likely to go down quite a bit.

{"body": "It all starts with an idea. This idea may come at any time. You may be riding a motorcycle through the desert. You may be backpacking in Europe with no one to keep you company but a monkey and an atlas. You may be taking a huge dump. Actually; you're probably taking a huge dump.\n\nOnce you have this idea it all boils down to a few basic things:\n\nYou know how to play the guitar? Good. Pick a key. Start with the \"one\" of that key (the \"one\" of C is... you guessed it; C). Now move on forward until you find what chord is next. It's probably the \"five\". I'm not going to give you a theory lesson right now. Figure it out. It may be the \"minor six\". Go for it. Just play these chords until you find the right next chord. It may take a while. Don't give up. There's only one *right* chord. You'll get it.\n\nNow that you have an idea/concept/inspiration and a chord structure just start strumming it in circles. You'll get a rhythm for it after a few play throughs. Now add some words. They don't have to be good. Just sing the first thing that comes to mind that makes sense with the theme that you've chosen. This should be the melody. This isn't necessarily the words you'll end up with.\n\nOnce you write a vocal melody you'll probably find that the chords that you wrote are absolute horse-shit. They don't fit with what you wrote. There are better chords out there. Now find the right chords. Again. \n\nOnce you've got a rhythm and a melody and a chord structure you're ready to write some real words! Excited? Don't be. It sucks. There's far too much in rhyme theory to go into right now and I'm going to assume that you've listened to some songs and you know basically what's going on. I'm going to suggest you focus on getting yourself out of the \"A B A B A B A B\" scheme (or even the A B A B A B C C scheme) and focus on making good rhymes.\n\nHere's what makes a good rhyme. It's simple and always right. I guarantee that if you find the sweet spot here you'll never go wrong. People love this shit. \n\nRhyme something with another rhyme that doesn't really rhyme. Here's an example that, shameless plug, I wrote:\n\n&gt; Now through the motorhomes and coffeeshops I'll fly\n\n&gt; Lookin' for your face in every window\n\n&gt; and from the comfort of this\n\n&gt; hotel mattress I\n\n&gt; will watch the news and make plans for tomorrow\n\nSee how close/slant and exact rhyme were mixed? This is an excellent technique. It keeps people on their toes. Try, also, to include something visceral. Use imagery, both visual and olfactory, to allow your listener to connect with what you say. Don't be afraid to be too specific. The closer to home, the worse it hurts, the better. \n\nConsider the idea of using internal rhyme to offset end rhyme (but not all the time) like in the following example:\n\n&gt; I'm laughing nervously cuss I can't see \n\n&gt; if my jokes are any use\n\n&gt; when our friends see me now I am \n\n&gt; terrified that they will know the truth\n\n&gt; honestly in the hours\n\n&gt; before you arrive\n\n&gt; you know you make me feel\n\n&gt; like everything well it all might be alright\n\nThat example includes both of the above-mentioned rhyme concepts. Get a feel for how long words take to say. Consider where the stress is in each syllable. Maybe read some Shakespeare so that you understand the subtle emotional differences between iambic and trochaic. Listen to the music inherent in the words. If you're really, really writing a song then every part should be able to stand on its own. The words should be a poem without the music. The vocal melody should sound good even if it's being played by a horn section on an easy listening record. The chord structure should move perfectly from one place to the next so effortlessly that the audience never even notices that there's any background music.\n\nNow; take everything I just said...\n\n and completely ignore it. When you write a song it should sound like *you*. Maybe you're looking for discord? Maybe you want to write licks. Maybe what really calls to you is three chords over and over again until your eyes bleed. At the end of the day, you have to make the listener feel your hand like a father guiding his child gently towards the future. I should never feel like I could've written your songs. Your songs should have external quality, sure, but they should flow from *you*. And sometimes that means just going with it and seeing how it all falls out. \n\nIf you want to write like Connor Oberst, Tim Kasher, or Bruce Springsteen, however, the one thing you *definitely* have to do is *take. your. time.* and be sure that you do it right, whatever that means.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387690160", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This advice is very good for instruments in general - I definitely feel a difference whilst playing when I am very happy with the patterns. Note that you don't \"really\" need to know a lot of scales to have a good understanding of where notes are, as some patterns will be much less common. I'd go through the scales listed on a music grade syllabus (a search for \"ABRSM guitar syllabus\" will have the scales required for each grade) and add a new one in when you are happy with the current set. This is pretty boring though - make sure that you do some other playing alongside.\n\nProbably the most \"efficient\" way of learning the patterns is using modes, but I'd use them once you are really happy with a scale. Once you feel confident with a scale, then you play the first 5 notes of a scale up and down (for example):\n\nC D E F G F E D C\n\nFollowed straight away by playing every other note: C E G E C.\n\nThen repeat this as if you are in the same key, but start on the next note up:\nD E F G A G F E D F A F D\n\nAnd again: E F G A B A G F E G B G E\n\nand so on. This idea can easily be extended (just add 2/4/6 more notes onto the end and you cover a lot more \"interesting\" chords) and will cover a lot more patterns. It is a lot easier to mess up though, as several of the runs initially sound strange and you may miss mistakes because you aren't used to how they sound.

{"body": "I totally understand and absolutely agree that in general the cheap financing on automobiles is A W F U L. I can't tell you how many people I see making 40-50k a year with a $40,000+ car. WHAT ARE THEY DOING!? Of course they don't see it as a 40k car. They just see a $600/mo payment on a 5 year loan or, even worse, a $450 monthly lease payment. \n\nI'm not sure this logic would apply evenly in my case. I bought a great car at a great price, I plan on keeping it for at least 10 years (on year 3 right now and it still seems that way), and I shopped around a lot and got a private loan for it at a dirt cheap rate. When I think about what I would have done had I not gotten this loan and instead just thrown down all the cash...I think I would have just not contributed as much towards retirement - I probably would have been only able to save 15% of my income instead of the 30+% that I was actually able to contribute. So that's the tradeoff: I am spending $1200 on interest payments over 4 years in exchange for being able to contribute another $20,000 towards retirement in that first year. I think with my particular set of circumstances the math works strongly in my favor.\n\nI will say though that this is VERY much an ideal set of circumstances and that it does not apply at all to 98% of people out there. I agree with the spirit of what Dave says but I don't think it applies to my specific case. I happen to be VERY fortunate in that I have a great job, I have a stocked emergency fund, I'm able to save a lot for retirement, and other than this current car loan I have absolutely zero debt. It should NOT be this way, but I believe that puts me ahead of about 90% of all of the households in the US and that is VERY sad :(\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387739772", "subreddit": "DaveRamsey", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Same rule applies to any extended chord:\n\nC7, C9, C13 all mean play a *dominant* seventh chord with the natural extensions. This means major third, minor seventh. When the extensions are altered, though, it's standard to list the chord as a 7th with the extensions in parentheses, such as C7(b9), C7(#11), or C7 (#9 b13).\n\nHere's where it gets a little bit odd, but you get used to it. The \"mi\" in Cmi7 refers to a minor *third*, since the 7th is already minor. This also applies to any other extended variations, So Cmi9 would be C, Eb, G, Bb, D. Cmi13 would include all of the extensions up to the 13th (A), while a chord listed as Cmi7(b13 or b6) would likely omit the 9th and the 11th.\n\nThe \"MA\" in CMA7, however, refers to the 7th, since the third is already major. Thus a CMA9 would be C E G B D.\n\nCmi9(MA7) is also possible, though it's awkward to notate, it's a very unique chord.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that in modern jazz voicings, where you'll see a lot of this extended nomenclature, the chords tend not to be voiced as blocks of stacked triads like we're talking about here. The extensions are more \"substitutions\" to create interesting intervals and colors.

{"body": "I really recommend looking more into how profunctors are used in lens. The entire lens team has pushed them really far. Here's one quite fun use of Profunctors and lenses, something Shachaf Ben-Kiki showed me once.\n\n    type ProTrans p s t a b = p s t -&gt; p a b\n    type Iso s t a b = forall p . Profunctor p =&gt; ProTrans p s t a b\n\nHow can we create something of this type? If it must work for all Profunctors then we can only be using the methods in the Profunctor class, so without loss of generality if `f :: Iso s t a b` then\n\n    f ≡ dimap (as :: a -&gt; s) (tb :: t -&gt; b)\n\nIf we had that `as . tb = id` and `tb . as = id` then this would clearly live up to its name and represent an `Iso`morphism between `a ~ b` and `s ~ t`. Using the Functor laws on the covariant functorial parameter and the Contravariant laws on the contravariant functorial parameter we can do this\n   \n    id \n    ≡ dimap id id ≡ dimap (as . tb) (tb . as) \n    ≡ dimap as tb . dimap tb as\n    ≡ from anIso . anIso\n\nwhich lets us define a way to invert our `Iso` (this is the lens `from` combinator)\n\n    from (dimap a b) = dimap b a\n\nSo profunctors lead to a nice representation of Isos. Their implementation is just a bit trickier. We need to create a profunctor that simply stores the functions passed to it by dimap.\n\n    data Exchange x y a b = Exchange (a -&gt; x) (y -&gt; b)\n    instance Profunctor (Exchange x y) where\n      dimap f g (Exchange ax yb) = Exchange (ax . f) (g . yb)\n\n    from :: Iso a b -&gt; Iso b a\n    from iso = let (Exchange ba ab) = iso (Exchange id id) in dimap ab ba\n\n    (^.) :: Iso a b -&gt; a -&gt; b\n    (^.) iso = let (Exchange _ ab) = iso (Exchange id id) in ab\n\nThis continues further by adding more constraints to the `p` in `ProTrans`.\n\n    type Lens  s t a b = forall p . Strong p =&gt; ProTrans p s t a b\n    type Prism s t a b = forall p .

{"body": "There's a LOT of misinformation here.  Here's how it works.\n\nC9 - dominant 7th with a 9.  You might spell it C E G Bb D.  The mandatory notes here are the b7 and the 9.\n\nCadd9 -- just add 9, so C E G D.  There's no 7th.\n\nCm9 -- Cm7 with a 9.\n\nCM9 -- CM7 with a 9.\n\nOther 9th chords are possible, but I'm not sure what the standard terminology would be.  A big one here is:\n\nC7b9 -- C7 with a b9.  Whenever you see (chord name with number)(number) it means you add or alter the second number.  So C7b9 is a C7 with a b9 added.  C7#11 is a C7 with a #11 added.  Cm7b5 is a Cm7 with the 5 changed to b5.\n\nC6 -- C E G A.  A 6 is added.\n\nCm6 -- C Eb G A.  It's a Cm chord with a 6.  NOT A b6.  Cm(b6) might be a Cm with a b6, but I've never actually seen this before.\n\nC6/9 -- C chord with an added 6 and 9.  When playing it, I usually voice it C E A D, skipping the G, but you can do whatever you want.\n\nC13 -- C E G Bb D F A.  Yep, *all* those notes are in a C dominant 13th.  You're welcome to skip them!  The required notes are the b7 and the 13.  I usually voice it C Bb E A.\n\nCm13 -- C Eb G Bb D F A\n\nCM13 -- C E G B D F A\n\nC7b13 -- C E G Bb Ab.  It's a C7 with an added b13.  You'll often see this respelled as C7+5 or C+7 or C7+, which would actually be C E G# Bb, but you'd usually skip the 5 anyway.  Most of the time, C7+5 actually means C7b13, but jazz chord symbol writers are notoriously bad at spelling!  (It can be easier to read if you misspell chords sometimes -- a #9 chord is pretty much always a b10 chord, for example, and b5 is pretty often actually #11.)  By the way, does a C7b13 chord have a 9th and 11th?  Technically no, but nobody will kill you for adding them in if you think they belong.  If it's vital to the piece, it'll be marked -- something like C9b13 or C7#11b13 or what have you.  Chord symbols do *not* tell the whole story; there's always room for interpretation.\n\nC7/6 -- C E G A Bb.  The slash just separates the 7 from the 6.  It's a C7 with a 6.\n\nFinally, there are sometimes contradictory notations for stuff.  If the chord symbol is ambiguous, try listening to the piece to figure out which one is meant.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387760853", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Yes, there have been hoaxes in the past.  But aside from a few irrelevant one offs, do you have any citation \nor evidence for a massive and I mean MASSIVE conspiracy to fabricate the vast amount of fossils? \n\n\n&gt;I read extensively about Charles Darwin, and discovered that he was actually mentally impaired. \n\nCharles darwin got the ball rolling, he was still wrong about many things.  This is part of the beauty of science.  When we find something wrong or that fails testing, we change what we hold as true.  We don't cling to assertions that don't stand up.\n\n&gt;I spoke with a geology professor who pointed out that there is indeed evidence of the great Flood. \n\nYes im sure there have been thousands of floods over the span of the earth.. and there is surely geologic evidence of localized floods.. there has not been evidence of a world wide flood that covered the highest mountains.\n\n&gt;The science that contradicts Creationism is false, much of it fabricated for the sake of monetary gain. \n\ncitation certainly needed.   through the scentific process, when we find something untrue or that does hold up to testing, we discard it.  we then go back to the drawing board and try to see if we can come up with an assertion that DOES hold up.  we are more than willing to change our assertions if that is where the evidence leads\n\n\n&gt;Creationism may not be entirely true; I understand that.\n\nthats very kind of you.. actually, we would like to see even a tiny bit of actual evidence of creation.. not just a few minor unimportant events.. actual evidence of creation. we are asking for verifiable repeatable evidence.. not just some anecdotal experience that only you can know about.\n\n\n&gt;Certain parts of the Bible may have been lost or translated incorrectly. However, there certainly seems to be a good deal of truth behind it\n\nyes many parts were likely not included, lost, mistranslated or untranslatable in modern languages.. that much is likely agreed on.  If they happen to get a few things right, is kinda incidental.  \n\n&gt;Over the last six years, I have learned that creationism is a more likely hypothesis than evolution, and that we shouldn't worship everything scientists say. \n\nplease PLEASE PLEASE provide this evidence that will support your hypothosis.  We would love to look at it and see if is testable, repeatable and ultimately whether we can find a way to 'falsify it'.  If the hypothosis is untrue, we want a way to know that it is not true.\n\n&gt;There is evidence that Creationism exists\n\nplease please please please PLEASE PLEASE P L E A S E present this evidence.. we ALL would love to see it... truly.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387830414", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

First letter of each word spells E L O T S A I D. This as I'm sure you're aware is not a word. If you reverse the letters it spells, DIASTOLE, part of the heart cycle. The opposite of diastole (since the letters are reversed) is systole, responsible for the pulse you feel when palpating certain areas of the body.\n\nI CAN BE GOOD, I CAN BE BAD, BUT I WILL ALWAYS END BY LAUGHING ALOUD.\nTried first and last letters, nothing comes up. The suggestion is that this can do harm and good. Ending by laughing aloud? Same as ending by laughing out loud LOL. Beta blockers are a class of drugs that slow heart rate (in addition to other effects) and generally end in the letters lol \"propanalol\" \"labetalol\" etc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker. So I'm thinking heart stopper aura.\n\nMARVEL AT RISQUE QUALITIES UNTIL IT SATIATES\nAgain weird order and syntax. First letters spell M A R Q U I S. This could be a hint to \"Marquis de sade\", a french nobleman from whom we get the word sadist from.\n\nI HAVE A BEARD, A FOOT AND A LONESOME RING.\nAt first I thought this was simply a reference to Necrolyte himself, as he has a beard etc. But the foot seemed odd, plus going by the pattern this line should refer to Reaper's scythe. Well according to wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythe a scythe has multiple named components including a beard and a ring. The foot seems to be in reference to the heel and toe.\n\nFinally we have the all caps. Might be to do with skeleton king and Necrolyte being related etc, or buyback stoppage. But I think it might be something to do with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(Discworld), since the character of DEATH is similar to Necrolyte in appearance with a scythe etc, with DEATH only speaking in small caps throughout the series.\n\nNecrolyte.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387982870", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 25, "controversiality": 0}

Up the escalators, in the stadium. And seeing Fire Man Ed up there leading the charge. I got to see Tebow and Sanchez up close, IIRC Willis was out. I got to see Santonio Holmes last snap for 2011 as he went down with an injury. It was a fun experience, but for my first real game, I wanted it to be more tense. And close. But they got blown out and left mid 4th quarter. \n\n**3rd and Most recently: Seattle Seahawks vs NY Giants.**\n\nBLOW OUT. Not fun to watch other than when Seahawks O went. Seeing beast mode, and Wilson play is soooo fun to watch live. The experience was cold, my feet were freezing because stadium maintenance was shit, there was STILL ice on the Seats and floor, and the stadium was just wet. But I took out my sister to her first game ever, so that was fun to do. And again, I wished it was more closer. But it's okay. I still enjoy watching live football.\n\nedit: also a nice tip for those who haven't been to a football game and wanting to go regardless of team. \n\nBuy tickets that are shitty seats. (Also buy binoculars to counter that) to a team that is doing bad in the season, facing another bad team. For example. Tickets for the Jets vs Browns game was going for as low as 45 tickets a seat in section 300+. And like 100 each on better seats. My friend went to that game, and he said he had a blast.

Many slide players will use their ring finger or pinky to hold the slide, and use their index and middle fingers to mute; they will also play with their fingers instead of using a pick. and use their extra fingers to mute unwanted string noise. You may also wish to raise the action on the strings to make slide playing easier.\n\nA good way to start learning slide is to use open tunings. For instance, imagine an open E chord, then imagine all the notes a whole step down. Now, tune your open strings to those notes (from low to high D A D F# A D). This is the very popular open D tuning, which is great for slide blues. Other popular open tunings include open G and open E (Derek Trucks favors this one).

You just have to make sure you don't let that become a crutch that hinders your development as a guitarist.\n\nFor example, instead of playing a B Major Barre chord like this:\n(numbers representing which finger, X is nut)\n\nX X X X X X\n\n| | | | | |\n\n| 1 1 1 1 1\n\n| | | | | |\n\n| | 2 3 4 |\n\nyou could play it like this:\n\nX X X X X X\n\n| | | | | |\n\n| 1 1 1 1 |\n\n| | | | | |\n\n| | 3 3 3 |\n\nYou lose out on the highest note this way, but it's a much quicker shape to get your hand into.  You can actually let your fingers lay across the highest string as long as you don't actually hit it with the pick.\n\nYou could also play an F Major like this (only picking the top 4 strings):\n\nX X X X X X\n\n| | | | 1 1\n\n| | | 2 | |\n\n| | 3 | | |\n\nJust remember to take time to practice the full Barre chords, too.\n\n\nEdit: adjusted formatting so diagrams displayed correctly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388101224", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I've added in one fake fact.  Can you find it for me?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOLTRANE. The Coltrane Sound has had a profound i n f l u e n c e on the jazz of the 60's. 70s, and 80's. At a purely visceral level, his massive and intense tone and the withering speed of his note-flow overwhelmed many younger generation jazz players.\n\nIn the words of jazz critic , Ira Gitler : \"He played notes so fast that\nhe seemed to hang sheets of sound before the listener, playing through\nscales and melodic patterns at a velocity previously unknown to the jazz world. \n\nHe extended the upper range of the tenor saxophone to new\nheights, which eventually led him to use the seldom-played soprano\nsaxophone, the highest, most piercing member of the sax family; this led\na whole new generation of sax players to switch to the soprano sax.\n\nColtrane's intensely ecstatic level of improvising, based on nearly\nsuperhuman virtuosity, was derived from the most virtuosic form of\nimprovisation in Asiatic  cultures : the quasi-religious raga\nimprovisations of India (using such instruments as the sitar, veena,\nsarod and sarangij.\n\nColtrane derived 3 things from Hindu improvisers:\n\n1. The hypnotic intensity of the playing based on extreme virtuosity\nand rapid notes.\n\n2. The frequent shifting , in a rapid improvisation, from the standard\nmajor or minor scale to modal scales, giving his music a faintly\nexotic quality.\n\n3. Basing a radically extended improvised line on a mere fragment of\nmelody. This was the 1st significant ant step towards free improvisation\nin jazz, in that the improvised melodic lines are not jacketed by a\nfixed song form ( binary , tertiary , blues) but rather are free \"spin\noffs\" of the short fragment of tune. The tune fragment in India is\nis called the raga; in Coltrane's jazz it's called a heed motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nI made this one very easy too.

{"body": "A scale represents a stepwise series of notes that usually repeats itself after an octave.\n\nThe most common ones are those with 7 and 5 different notes.\n\nA few of them are as follows:\n\nA C-major scale consists of the notes: C D E F G A B\n\nA c-minor scale consists of the notes: C D Eb F G Ab Bb\n\nA c-minor melodic scale consists of the notes: C D Eb F G A B\n\nA c-minor harmonic scale consists of the notes C D Eb F G Ab B\n\n\nA C-major pentatonic scale consists of the notes: C D E G A\n\nA c-minor pentatonic scale consists of the notes C Eb F G Bb\n\n\nIn blues you may add a 6th note to the minor pentatonic scale which in the c-minor pentatonic scale would be the note Gb. (Is also known as the blue note..)\n\nAdditionally, you can derive the modes from the major scale by playing the major scale from the second step (D E F G A B C) from the third step (E F G A B C D) and so on. You can do the same with the melodic- and harmonic minor, but that is a bit more advanced (and quite jazzy...)\n\nI suggest that you start by playing all of the scales I have listed above so you can hear the difference among them. Then you can focus on the pentatonic scales which are a great place to start with soloing. Youtube has a sh*tload of tutorials on this.\n\nYou can read a bit more about scales [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_%28music%29).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388317647", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I'm thinking they don't know HOW to use all the stuff they've collected.\n\nMaybe this data/metadata collection is like those people who have their heads cut off at death and pay tons to have the heads stored (cyrogenics?) *in the event* that one day, someone will know how to reconstitute them? Maybe the NSA collects and stores, but just stares at their floppies (LOL, loved that story) or papers and have NO IDEA what to do with it.\n\nI'm not so against this metadata collection (I'm def. a privacy advocate, but I know we're not putting this genie back in that bottle), but I am a bit **furious as Hell** that they can't use their evil ways to even stop human trafficking, or return kidnapped kids, or stop child rape.\n\nAnyone else feeling this way?

{"body": "I definitely recommend it.\n\nDisclaimer: I own and have played the 360 version, so I can't speak to the PC port or features specifically.\n\nThe strengths of this game lay in its setting, art direction, level aesthetics, soundtrack, and the story and voice work for the primary cast. Some supporting characters have weaker voice work. The combat ranges from meh to okay depending upon the viewer.\n\nThe closest comparison for gameplay is Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, in that gameplay is split between linear \"exploration\" / ledge-to-ledge \"parkour\" elements, and combat. The best part about the exploration is that the setting, set design and overall aesthetic is gorgeous (ref: [Dead End Thrills](http://deadendthrills.com/gallery/?gid=3) screenshots, though they use an unlocked camera).\n\nThe protagonist, Nilin, is well modeled, animated and acted; chapters are buffered with her internal monologue, reflecting on new information or her fears on what's to come.\n\nFor combat, you have combos and super moves. Combos are \"customized\" by you as you decide if each hit deals bonus damage, heals you or reduces cooldowns on your special moves by slotting \"presens\" into each slot. The actual combo doesn't change though, so the basic combo will always be X X X, while the longest one will be Y Y X X X X Y Y X. The effects of presens are enhanced the further down they are in a combo.\n\nCombos must progress in order, and must be done on one target; so no \"linking\" combos for a longer chain, and if you switch targets or spend more than a moment away from your target, the combo is lost.\n\nAttacks may not be countered; instead, they are dodged when you see a red \"!\" pop up.\n\nEach enemy tends to need a certain strategy to defeat, and the game is not shy about throwing multiple types at you in a single bout, so you'll dance around a melee-immune robot while disabling a riot shield and so on. \n\nThere are actually boss fights, which are fun enough and are an extension of the mechanics from normal fights.\n\nRemember Me's big trick is in remixing memories. Effectively, you are given a cutscene that you can rewind and play through, looking for interactive objects that change the outcome of the memory. There tends to be more than just the winning outcome, so it isn't rote or linear in that way.\n\nUnfortunately, throughout the 10ish chapters, there's only 4 remix segments, limiting what is easily the game's most unique feature and selling point.\n\ntl;dr definitely worth it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388416876", "subreddit": "ShouldIbuythisgame", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Glad I could help :)\n\nFor teaching yourself solfege, first get intimate with all the major scales.  There's only 12, just sitting down at a piano and banging through them won't take more than a few days or weeks to internalize.  While you're playing them on piano, sing the solfege along with it (do re mi fa sol la ti do and then back down).\n\nStart with songs in a major key, it's always easier that way.  Figure out the melody on piano and understand what key the song is in.  If the song is in C major the melody will very likely consist of only white keys.  Each white key will be one of the solfege syllables.  C is do, D is re, E is mi, and so on...  When singing the melody back, sing back the solfege syllables instead of the words.  For example if the first line of a song goes: C E G C (octave) C C G F, sing Do Mi Sol Do Do Do Sol Fa.  Now you can take this same melody and put it into the key of E and sing the same sofege syllables but with the notes E G# B E E E B A.\n\nYou'll probably find after a while that it can be slightly ambiguous what the solfege syllables could be... Mi Fa Do has the same intervals as Ti Do Sol, for example.  It takes other contextual clues to disambiguate these, so knowing the chord progressions of the songs you're learning helps a lot too!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388442059", "subreddit": "singing", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So there's a bit of an issue there: in real life, a Cmaj9 chord is not always a C major triad with a G major triad on top.  These chords are seventh chords with added notes, and you can voice them any which way so long as they contain the added note and the 7th.  For example, I'd voice a Cm9 chord C G Bb D, making it a Gm/C chord and skipping the Eb.  A common voicing for the dominant 11th chord is as follows: G11 would be G C F A, which is an F major triad in second inversion with a G in the bass.  My favorite way to voice a G13 is G F B E, and G7b13, correspondingly, is G F B Eb.  You may have been taught that Cmaj13 is C E G B D F A, a crazy-ass chord!  In reality, you'd omit most of those notes and only play the ones that are important in context, in the position that makes the most sense for the piece.\n\nThat said, stacking triads has its uses, because it makes the result a polychord.  That is, Cmaj7 feels like both a C major chord and an E minor chord, at the same time.  On the other hand, C and Bdim don't play well together.  You'd *very* rarely want to actually play a maj11 chord.  The 4 is what's called an \"avoid note\" due to its being dissonant with pretty much everything else in the chord.  Cmaj11 would be C E G B D F, and the E - F forms a harsh minor 9th, while the B - F tritone isn't nice in this context either.  I can think of a use for a Cmaj11 chord, and that would be as a G7/C -- the G7 resolves to C major, but the C is already there in the bass, giving a feeling of repose to the progression.  So yeah, it can be done, but eh.\n\nTo answer your more immediate question, the way I remember this stuff is by visualizing the keyboard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388447041", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Well, let's look at the C major scale.\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nEvery note goes up a letter, right?  Now let's look at the C minor scale.\n\nC D Eb F G Ab Bb C\n\nEvery note goes up a letter.  If you change the flats to sharps, you have this:\n\nC D D# F G G# A# C\n\nNow D to D# doesn't go up a letter, D# to F goes up two letters, G to G# doesn't go up a letter, A# to C goes up two letters.  It breaks the pattern!  Every note has its place in the scale, and the name of the note tells you what that place is.  In C, the note name E means that it's the third, and the note name D means that it's the second.  When you say D# when you're in C, I assume you mean that it's a kind of second, and when you say Eb, I assume you mean that it's a kind of third.  The spelling tells me what the *function* of the note is.  So if you spell it wrong, I get confused.  I know how to *play* the note, but I don't know what it means!  And that actually makes playing the note harder.  It's as if I decided to misspell words on purpose.

{"body": "&gt; Finger legato?\n\nThis means connecting one note to the next purely with your hand, rather than by using the pedal. On the piano, you actually do this by overlapping the notes a tiny bit. For example, if I'm playing C D E F G with my right hand, I would start by pressing down C with my thumb. Ever so slightly before I release the C, I would press down the D with my index finger, so that the sound of the two notes overlaps. At first you have to practice it in slow motion to get used to the coordination, but it'll become easier with time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388527075", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
