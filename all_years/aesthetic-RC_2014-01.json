If you change the name - you change everything.  The conquerors rewrite history - \"History is written by the victors\".\n\n\nThe Freemasons' holy book is the ENGLISH BIBLE because they have changed the Real Names with blasphemous ones - The names of their Satanic Deities. \n\nFreemasons worship Lucifer. The difference is that the lower bottom ones don't know it. Jesus is the son of Lucifer. Freemasons created him through the name \"Jesus\" and snuck him into the bible to replace the true savior.  \n\nHere is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.\n----------------------\n\nRevelation 13:18\n----------\n\n------------------------------\n6 is the number of man - 9 is the number of the adversary of man. \n\nAdd 9 at every letter.\n\nA 1 x 9 = 9 \n\nB 2 x 9 = 18 \n\nC 3 x 9 = 27 \n\nD 4 x 9 = 36 \n\nE 5 x 9 = 45 \n\nF 6 x 9 = 54 \n\nG 7 x 9 = 63 \n\nH 8 x 9 = 72 \n\nI 9 x 9 = 81 \n\nJ 10 x 9 = 90 \n\nK 11 x 9 = 99 \n\nL 12 x 9 = 108 \n\nM 13 x 9 = 117 \n\nN 14 x 9 = 126 \n\nO 15 x 9 = 135 \n\nP 16 x 9 = 144 \n\nQ 17 x 9 = 153 \n\nR 18 x 9 = 162 \n\nS 19 x 9 = 171 \n\nT 20 x 9 = 180 \n\nU 21 x 9 = 189 \n\nV 22 x 9 = 198 \n\nW 23 x 9 = 207 \n\nX 24 x 9 = 216 \n\nY 25 x 9 = 225 \n\nZ 26 x 9 = 234\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nJ E S U S = 90 + 45 + 171 + 189 + 171 = 666\n\nJesus = 666\n\nLucifer = 666 \n\nJesus = Lucifer\n\nJesus is the mark of the beast. Most people won't accept it because the mark of the beast is not made to be removed. Once you accept it - you are most likely doomed to it.\n\nThe Freemasons are evil people because they use people's ignorance against them. They spiritually prostitute people to Satan. That's there dirty little secret.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388680880", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": -21, "controversiality": 0}

The easy way out would be to say it's because of lack of interest in the music, but with releases like \"My Life\", \"Major Distribution\", and \"We Up\" we got no choice but to believe it's because of poor marketing and lack of a real budget. 50 also said it was because of this in recent interviews.

That's why we say #FREE50CENT.\nif you feel the same way and believe interscope should push 50 cent on the same level they do as artists such as Lady Gaga share this image on social media with the #free50cent hashtag mentioning @interscope and  @50cent in the message. lets let the world know we’re ready for a new 50 cent album in 2014. g g g g g g g g g g g g g g-unit!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388721600", "subreddit": "HipHopImages", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Technically all the notes are just as common as any other, even if certain instruments or composers favor some more than others. I'll try not to go too in depth about theory, but you are correct that F# is so common and there's a reason why.\n\nThe key of C major has no sharps and no flats, C D E F G A B\n\nIf you move to the 5th note in the C scale you get G. G has one sharp, and its F#. \n\nIf you move to the 5th note in the G scale, you get D. D has two sharps, F# and C#.\n\nIf you move to the 5th note in the D scale, you get A. A has three sharps, F# C# and G#.\n\nIf you notice, we keep starting from the 5th note in the pervious scale, and we add a new sharp to each scale, but the F# always remains. \n\nI was going through what's called the **Circle Of Fifths**.The most common guitar scales are the ones I just listed, but there's also a circle of fourths, and that covers the other half of the musical scales which happen to be more common on trumpets and horns. On that side, all of the keys use the F-natural note, instead of F#, but they aren't as common on the guitar.\n\nIf you want more information, look up key signatures or circle of fifths, or just ask away in /r/musictheory", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388854210", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Why can't you, when hunting lets say, rent them at the hunting location?\"\n\n\"Having guns, even in the safe, makes me feel protected.\"\n\n\"Everyday, kids are dying from getting into these safes.  There are mass shootings that kill innocents from people making hasty decisions and having access to these weapons.\"\n\n\"Do you have a family?  Kids?\"\n\n\"Ex-wife...No kids.\"\n\n\"Vastly different situations, then, sir.  You do not know personally what it is like to want to protect your family from situations which you can not predict.  A few violent situations should not prevent me, a law abiding American, from doing this.\"\n\n\"I know the facts.  The facts are that for every life guns in a household save, 10 more are lost.  I know that there were tons of dads who held your opinion, until someone got into their safe...\"\n\n\"Cocksucker.  You are just a liberal hack.\"\n\n\"Everyday, we get callers like this, folks.  People can't objectively look at the facts and realize that what I want, what this radio station wants, is a better, safer America.  And getting rid of guns will cause just that.\"\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Commander, we have an incoming message from our guy.\"\n\nW E H A V E T H E D E V I C E.\n\n\"We move out tonight.

{"body": "I love the dual blades. I have been using them since I first got into the series, so I will try to answer your questions.\n\n1. The A attack can come in handy. Like if you do X X X A you will finish with the X + A attack. If you do it right you can keep the combo going for quite a while.\n\n2. Each mask has it's own abilities, quite honestly which ones to use are personal opinion and whichever suits your playstyle best. To use them add the Signals panel on your touch screen. It will show two buttons with chacha and/or Kayamba. When you tap the Signal button for your shakalaka it will activate the mask ability.\n\n3. Wroggi S is great armour for DS. That set carried me 3/4 through hi rank. For skills you want things that compliment your play style and your weapon, it can be tricky but once you figure it out it's not that bad. For DS, Sharpness is really important, always try and increase that when you can. Another good skill is spirit. Spirit increases the speed at which the demon mode bar fills, and decreases the speed at which it empties. Other good skills are dodging, as DS can't block which makes dodging really important. \n\n4. For the love of all that is holy bring poop bombs. ALWAYS bring poop bombs. When the jho shows up, throw some stank into his face and he will leave the area, leaving the Peco undefended. If he comes back, poop him again. Rinse and repeat till the Peco dies\n\n5. Using multiple weapons is up to you, some weapons work a bit better depending on what you are fighting. I am a fan of the Switchaxe, as it requires similar skills as the DS so I don't usually have to switch out my armour set when I use it. Longsword is nice as well. Try out different weapons and see what you like.\n\n6. I haven't tried the multi element weapons, but I think it is a jack of all trades, master of none situation. Rather than having a weapon that deals meh elemental damage of multiple types, you can get a dedicated single element weapon that really packs a punch.\n\n7. I have not seen too much hate personally, I think it's considered a \"noob\" weapon by some as it is an easy weapon to get into. Don't let that deter you, all weapons are equal and have their own strengths and weaknesses. It's all about what you like to use and what you enjoy playing with. Experimenting with different weapons is always encouraged!\n\n\nHopefully I answered some of your questions at least :P if you need me to elaborate just ask!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388872068", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

We now know Am is in the key of G, but what 7th chord can we make of it?\n\nAgain you have two choices to narrow down for which 7th you pick. The 7th of A is G#. The minor 7th is G. Obviously in the key of G we not be using the G# but the G.\n\n\nSo we can add on top of our Am a G note.

Maybe you go a step farther and use the A minor scale. That will sound bitching too. If the band is jamming on only an A minor chord that means they're only jamming on a three note chord (A,C, E). No one is prolly playing those Fs, or F#s except the soloist.......so it's YOUR CALL whether or not to start sharping out your Fs. If you do, your solo will stop sounding like A minor(A Aeolian for the nerds) and start sounding like A dorian (which, like you said, happens to ALSO be the G major scale, but don't think too hard about that).\n\nYou could slink in and out of both scales as long as your ideas are strong. If you think of both scales the whole time you'll get some chromaticism from the E, F, F#, G part of the scale. You're allowed to do this because you're not changing the main chord tones (A,C,E). If you lean hard into those F's its just regular old fashioned Aminor. Start leaning into the F#'s instead and you get A dorian. If you're backing band is smart they'll pickup on what you're doing and goove with the F#'s in mind. Trust me, we can hear it. \n\nAnother real world example:\n\nSame as above, except this time the chord everyone is jamming on is Am6.\n\nNow you MUST use dorian over A minor. The Am6 chord has that F# in it. Everyone's gunna be playing F#'s with their Am chords. If you lean into F its going to sound whack because everyone else is hitting the note fret above. \n\nWhat is an Am6 chord? It's an A minor chord with a M6 on top (in this case............F#). The only mode of the major scale that gives you a minor chord with a M6 on top is the dorian mode. The chord name literally TELLS YOU WHICH MODE TO PLAY.\n\n\nReal world example 3.\n\nSame as above, but now the chords are Am and D..............Still HAS TO BE DORIAN instead of Aminor...........more or less...........and here's why.\n\nThe regular Am chord suggests an Aminor scale...........but the D tells a different story............D chords have F#'s!!!!. You need a scale that is going to give you an Am chord AND an F#'. Once again............you need dorian. \n\nNow lets jazz up the chords..............Am7, D9. Very funky chords. still the same change as before but you may notice that when you play the D9 it kinda sorta looks and sounds like the Am6 we talked about before..........because it more or less is.\n\n\nThe chord progression Am7, D9 chould easily be thought of as Am7, Am6 becaus the same thing happens in both...........first chord is A minor and the second cord introduces an F#.................\n\nKind of rambling, let me know if any of that helps.\n\n\nAlso, listen to So What by Miles Davis, that's the goldstandard for the dorian sound.

{"body": "To start with, I have absolutely no idea what you're asking.  I'm sorry.  Please clarify?\n\nI have an attempt at an answer, though, by guessing the question: why do we have a circle of fifths?\n\nThere are 12 notes in the scale, right?  The 5th is 7 semitones (C, C#, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G).  7 is relatively prime to 12, so if you start from 0 and count by 7's mod 12, you get back to 0 after going through every note: 0, 7, 14 = 2, 9, 16 = 4, 11, 18 = 6, 13 = 1, 8, 15 = 3, 10, 17 = 5, 12 = 0.  The only numbers relatively prime to 12 are 1, 5, 7, and 11.  1 is a semitone, so the circle would be something like C C# D Eb E F F# G G# A Bb B C.  11 is just the 1 circle backwards.  7 is a fifth, which yields the circle of fifths, and 5 is the circle backwards, which is the circle of fourths.  If you use some other interval size, you don't get a complete circle.  For example:\n\nThe circle of whole steps (2 semitones, or 10 backwards): C D E F# G# Bb C\n\nThe circle of minor thirds (3 semitones, or 9 backwards): C Eb F# A C\n\nThe circle of major thirds (4 semitones, or 8 backwards): C E G# C\n\nThe circle of tritones (6 semitones forwards or backwards): C F# C\n\nSo far, we've talked about why the circle of fifths is *possible*.  But why do we *care*?\n\nSimply put, because Western music is based on the fifth.  The basic harmonic progression is V - I.  This is because our major scale has evolved so that 7 - 1 is a convincing melodic cadence, and it's harmonized by V - I.  Since the fifth is an organizing principle for our music, a circle of fifths tells us useful information.  In addition, the diatonic scale is basically seven fifths in a row.  Starting from F, we get F C G D A E B, which is all seven notes of the C major scale in a different order.  So the C major scale and the G major scale share six out of seven notes, and the C major scale and the D major scale share five out of seven, and so on.  The key signature of the scale shows which notes are in the scale, so when you go from one tonic to the next in the circle, you only change one accidental in the key signature because the other six notes are shared.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1388989665", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think the best way to approach it is to learn the harmonic framework of C major and extrapolate from there. That way your knowledge of chords is built on something that you can go back to and build on, rather than just being a collection of data without any real meaning behind it. \n\nC major is just C D E F G A B C, so that's easy enough to memorize, but also memorize the distance between any two note names (C to D is a second, E to G is a third, F to B is a fourth, don't worry about major or minor or diminished yet) and the chords derived from C major are C, Dm, Em, F, G, A, Bdim (let me know if you don't understand how I got there). Memorize that order of chord qualities: major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminished. \n\nThen memorize how different inflections (notes raised or lowered a half-step) affect a chord. Not necessarily memorize, just learn how any given inflection will affect a chord's quality, which just comes from a basic understanding of how chords are constructed in the first place. For example, taking a major chord and lowering the third will make it a minor chord, and taking the same major chord and raising the root and fifth will make a minor chord built on the new root.\n\nWith that down, you can figure out any chord quality quickly by comparing it to the major scale, and figure out the notes in the chord very quickly by doing the same.\n\nEGB: Built on E, and no differences from the C major scale, so E minor (because you've memorized that the chord built on E, without any alterations, is minor)\n\nBbDF: The chord built on B in C major is diminished; with the root lowered, it becomes a Bb major chord.\n\nA major: The triad built on A in C major is minor, so raise the third (A C# E) to get A Major.\n\nF# minor: The triad built on F in C major is major, so raise the root and fifth (F# A C#) to get F# minor.\n\nSo, taking your example, 1 4 5 in Eb, you know that the chords built on those notes in any major scale are all going to be major. So the first is Eb major; E minor is your \"template\" from C major, lower the root and the fifth to make it ~~minor~~ major and you've got Eb G Bb. Ab is the fourth of Eb; an A chord is minor in C major; lower the root and fifth to make it ~~minor~~ major and you get Ab C Eb. Bb is the fifth of Eb; a B chord is diminished in C major; lower the root to make it major and you get Bb D F. \n\nI've found that, once you've got that framework down, direct memorization of all the chords (being able to instantly say that D F# A is D major, for example), comes very quickly.\n\nEDIT: Typos", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389079998", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am just going to copy and paste this here in full... Gotta love well cited stupidity! (everything below is a quotation. Chris, if you object, let me know and I will delete it. I assume you will not since you presumably want your theory shared)\n\n&gt;ChrisThomas 6 hours ago\n\nG.W. Theory (a.k.a. - \"Global Warming\") is a made-up theory to cover for the enviable onset of \"climate change\".  This was known by the original government think tank when they discovered the truth about Planet X - Nibiru back in the Voyager series of space probe days:\n\nhttp://redxpro.com/articles/nsaie_b_1987.gif (note: \"tenth planet\")\nToday, the old theory is pushed even more, despite the disagreement among the climate scientist's peer group. A few years ago, even 40 retired astronauts formed an anti-climate change group to pressure the government (and NASA) to tell the truth about Climate Change: http://www.wnd.com/2012/04/rebellion-at-nasa-against-global-warming/\nEven with the ongoing failure of nations to abide by the Kyoto accord and the carbon credit trading business end being such a joke, the establishment still persists in flogging this dead horse. Does anyone actually know what the original theory proposed? The only reason I have a slight bit of knowledge of G.W. Theory, is because I happened across an explanation by a climate scientist on-line a few years ago.\n\nThe theory says that less than 1% of the atmosphere contains \"green house gases\" (a highly doubtful effect, by-the-way) that are responsible for the re-reflection of solar energy back to the Earth's surface supposedly resulting in the rise of the mean temperature of Earth's surface air by 1.75°F over every 20 year period. Of course this theory completely ignores the fact that our continents float on red-hot magma or any possible heat transfer from that and the fact that we have solid ice polar caps, more-or-less unaffected by the 10,000° F. Earth's core. Now called Climate Change, trillions of dollars have been spend on Climate Change:\n http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2011/08/23/the-alarming-cost-of-climate-change-hysteria/ ; so one has to wonder why? Well the reason why is many fold, but the core of the reason is: c o v e r - u p. Does anyone remember \"Climate Gate\" from the fall of 2009, where climate scientists (management)  were revealed to be cherry-picking the data, and other forms of bias? That website is gone now but the emails are viewable here:\nhttp://di2.nu/foia/\nI could go on and on here and cite many examples from my research, but time, space and attention is limited.\nThe globe IS heating, but not from CO2, neither from the purportedly much worse new \"green house\" gas \"discovered\" lately, it's heating due to the nearby presence of Planet X - Nibiru. The crazy weather? Cold, then hot, records being broken, the increase in volcanic action, and fire balls all have a singular cause. First the Earth is wobbling, causing land masses to be exposed to colder and correspondingly hotter air temperatures and difference in temperatures of layers of air. The magma underneath the mantle is being roiled by external influence of Planet X/Nibiru.\nFor more reading on this, refer to my blogsite where topics are broken down, images aid in understanding and other related subjects are covered:  http://survivingthepoleshift.com\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389082816", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

This is as expected, and possibly related to a chemical in the brain.\"  \n  \nSo now you're wondering why, how, and who cares?  But I'd have to explain that in circular technical jargon, because the why and how are extremely complicated AND unproven (relying on previous research connecting chemical X to chemical A to chemical B to C D E F blah blah blah and then MAYBE this is how it happened) since we only tracked behavior.  We didn't/can't split open their brains and watch the chemicals moving.  So you have to hedge and avoid saying anything definite.   \n  \nAnd the \"who cares\" you can't talk about at all.  But it's because PCP usage closely mimics certain psychiatric disorders, so if a chemical disruption can \"cure\" PCP, maybe a chemical disruption could eventually be used to cure a psychiatric disorder.  But, that's such a ridiculous stretch of the imagination and so easy to fault, that we just don't bring it up.  Other researchers in the field can read between the lines.  But it's the ENTIRE reason behind doing any of this research.  You have to start somewhere.  But basic research is so far removed from the end product.

{"body": "It's the simplest explanation when we take all the stylistic considerations out of the equation and just focus in on the notes and their orientation to each other. \n\nLook on a keyboard at the orientation of the sonorities in C Major:\n\nC D E **F** G **A** B **C** D **E** F **G** A **B** C **D** E F G A B C\n\nTo the left of our C Major triad is the F Major triad. To the right of our C Major triad is the G Major triad. We get FAC, CEG, and GBD. The gravity of CEG to FAC is equal to the gravity of GBD to CEG.

But the gravity is really just a word/idea I'm borrowing from earlier theorists. \n\nThere are plenty of others who will go on to talk about the \"dissonance\" of the dominant, the leading tone, the 7th, the tritone that collapses onto the root and third of the tonic to \"resolve\" the tension. That's all fine and dandy. But in this case, the fundamental idea behind it, before all those stylistic considerations developed in the common practice, was the idea that tonic was the center of gravity in music that all other sonorities of the key were bound to. \n\nI'm probably not explaining it as well as a real theorist would.

{"body": "By ear basically. Some tabs have \"U\" and \"D\" markers above the notes but otherwise watch videos or listen. It's fairly obvious to me now what the strumming patterns are, and the longer you play, the more keen your ear will become at picking out the patterns. A general rule of thumb would be that if the strum sounds sharper or you hear the higher notes ring first, it's an upstrum, if you hear the bass notes first, it's a down strum. \n\nFor example, in this video http://youtu.be/m8rfKUDy13I, the basic pattern is D D U U D U (D being down, U being up) if you listen you can very clearly hear the higher notes first. Imagine this strum pattern as you hear the song and watch Dave's hand (the singer, with the blue guitar).\n\nEverybody has a different ear I guess, strum what it sounds like to you, and it will sound good. When I started playing I never really gave a conscious thought to whether I was strumming up or down, I just kind of did it.

{"body": "It sounds like you lack even the most basic knowledge of music theory. For your purposes, the basics can be summed up quickly, and at least then you'll have something to go off.\n\nThe note-names are labelled [like this](http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/images/piano-notes-and-keys.JPG).\n\nTry to memorise these. Most people pick a note that they can easily recognise and use that as a 'home' key to count from until they can pick out notes more automatically. (I first learned to spot C quickly because I knew that it is the first white key before a set of two black keys on a piano; using a guitar, I have six open strings which I know are tuned to E A D G B and another E, these too can serve as my 'home' notes).\n\n* A **semitone** is one fret away on a guitar or one key across on a piano. This is also known as a *minor second*\n\n* A **tone** is two semitones. This is also known as a major second*.\n \nTo build a **major scale**, pick a starting note (say... A), then play up a tone, up another tone, up a semitone, up a tone, up a tone, then up a tone; going up one more semitone should bring you to your starting pitch one octave higher (it will sound finished). To review, that was TTSTTTS; in our case, you should have played the notes A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A.\n\nTo build a **minor scale**, pick a starting note (say... C#), then play up a tone, up a semitone, up a tone, up a tone, up a semitone, and up a tone; going up one more tone should bring you to your starting pitch one octave higher (it will sound finished). To review, that was TSTTSTT; in our case, you should have played the notes C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A, B.\n\nMany people have many different methods of remembering these. I find it easiest to think of the major scale pattern (TTSTTTS) as the classic rock-beat on the drums, where the Ts are the kick and the Ss the snare; I tend to think of the minor scale pattern (TSTTSTT) as the same as the major scale, but starting on the sixth one of the sequence.\n\nWhen writing chords and harmony, composers will often 'raise the seventh' degree of the minor scale. This simply means that they will take the seventh note of the minor scale and make it one semitone higher to create what we call the **harmonic minor scale** (eg: a D harmonic minor scale will contain the notes D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C#; since a normal D minor scale contains a C natural, and we raise this to a C#. Harmonic minor scales increase the tension of the seventh note, making it want to lead to the 8th/1st. \n\nYou will notice that all the black notes on the piano have two names (eg: C# or Db). This ensures that every scale may contain one of each letter. One would not write a D minor scale with an A# instead of a Bb, because then it would contain two As and no Bs (D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C vs D, E, F, G, A, A#, C). Since each scale contains 7 notes (8 including the octave), we can number them. In C major (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C), we call C the **tonic**, D the **second**, E the *third* of the scale, and so on. This allows us to name a note in relation to a scale. We call these numbers the *scale degrees*.\n\nTo confuse matters somewhat, separate to scale-degrees there are also *intervals* intervals are the distances between notes, and we have already touched upon them when we discussed semitones and tones. \n\n* The distance between one key on a keyboard or one fret on a guitar (aurally) is a semitone, more formally: a **minor second**\n\n* Two semitones make up a tone, more formally: a **major second**\n\n* Three semitones make up a **minor third**\n\n* Four semitones make up a **major third**\n\n* Five semitones make up a **perfect fourth**\n\n* Six semitones make up a **tritone**\n\n* Seven semitones make up a **perfect fifth**\n\n* Eight semitones make up a **minor sixth**\n\n* Nine semitones make up a **major sixth**\n\n* Ten semitones make up a **minor seventh**\n\n* Eleven semitones make up a **major seventh**\n\n* Twelve semitones make up an **octave**\n\nTry working out the intervals between various notes (eg: C# -&gt; F upwards = major third).\n\nCan you see the pattern to how they are named?\nIn general, when counting from the tonic, the major intervals make up the major scale, the minor intervals make up the minor scale, and the perfect intervals are present in both scales. The exceptions to this are the tritone (which appears in neither scales), and the second. You would think that the major second should be labelled a perfect second, and the minor second need to find another name, since both the major and minor scales begin with a major second. There are a multitude of reasons for why that isn't the case, but that's beyond your worries for the moment.\n\nStill with me so far?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389204705", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Basically, it's because the whole step is used more often than the half step. If you sing \"Mary had a little lamb\", all the intervals except the skip to the top note on \"-tle lamb\" are whole steps. I don't know if you've learned your scales yet, but the major scale is predominantly whole steps:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nThe only half steps are between E and F and between B and C; the rest are all whole steps. So basically, whole steps are the bread and butter of Western music, and half steps add some variety and color.\n\nAnd this is related to why there are black keys on the keyboard, too! The major scale I mentioned earlier is what you get when you play only the white keys on the keyboard. Or, to put it more accurately, the keyboard was designed so that the white keys would make a major scale.\n\nThere's also a practical reason: if it were all white keys, there'd just be 88 keys all in a row. Not the only would the keyboard be *huge*, but there'd be no way to tell where you are! It would just be one undifferentiated mass of keys. Now, there are other keyboard designs that have been proposed to get around these problems, but the one we have today has been the standard for centuries now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389210129", "subreddit": "ELI5Music", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; A) How is the XP related to the scoreboard number?\n\n**They're not related.  The scoreboard will show you points you got for kills, various captures, and assists.  The XP you receive is a total of the match XP, Operation Bonus, the Match Bonus XP any other bonus XP (Clan XP bonus and/or Double XP bonus).  The experience you get from completing operations will trigger at certain intervals, which explains why sometimes you'll get a 500+ point assist.  Those 500 points are experience points towards your character, not in-game XP.**\n\n&gt; B) How is match bonus calculated?\n\n**I don't think there's been a formula released that states exactly how it works, but I think it consists of the following:**\n\n* Player level\n* Win/Lose/Tie (1 for win, .5 for a loss, .75 for a tie)\n* Match Length\n* Your time in the game\n\n**So for example, if you're playing Team Deathmatch and you win 75-50 in 5 minutes, you'll get the bonus for winning the game, for winning by 25 points and additional bonus for how long you were in the game relative to how long the game went on.  It seems to be that the longer the match, the larger the match bonus, so I assume the formula is a simple A x B x C = Match Bonus.  Again, this is speculation, but seems to be consistent with what scores I receive for match bonuses.**\n\n&gt;C) does being in a party actually have an effect on XP (it appears it does for me)\n\n**It doesn't appear so, according to the bonuses I receive.

I get these bonuses fairly often, but have never checked to see if my total assists are just past a milestone (1,000/1,500/2,000...etc).**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389216710", "subreddit": "CODGhosts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When you've got a scale, like the maj scale, you have specific intervals between the notes that will have a certain characteristic. Let's analyse the C scale:\n\nC - Root note\n\nD - Major Second \n\nE - Major Third\n\nF - Perfect Fourth\n\nG - Perfect Fifth\n\nA - Minor Sixth\n\nB - Major Dim Seventh\n\nC - Octave\n\nThe connotations of the intervals means a specific relationship with the root note, it's interesting to note the major intervals (2,3) the minor (6) the perfects (4,5,) and the (7). \n\nThat means that, by knowing how the intervals work, it is easier to work up a riff, or even to strum a melody. Open your DAW and play with these intervals, play C D together, then play C E and try to notice the difference. Play both perfects and see what you can feel from the sound. Supposedly, the perfect fifth is the most harmonic interval ever, so it should feel naturally good. If you play C-A you'll get a minor interval, which is supposed to sound more sad. Then play the 7, in this case, C-B, and feel the dissonance. It such an 'evil' interval that the church forbid it. Ironically, it's a common interval for blues and jazz, since it adds quick tension in progressions. \n\nAnd I'm just talking about the intervals, think that this scale is also able to get you all the basic chords you'd need for a song:\n\nC maj is C-E-G\n\nD maj is D-G-A\n\nE maj is E-G-B\n\nF maj is F-A-C\n\nG maj is G-B-D\n\nA min is A-C-E\n\nB maj is B-D-F\n\nThese would be the basic chords, the triads of 1-3-5. Knowing in which scale you are, means that you can funk these chords up and add more flavor to it, depending to what you want. For example, a C maj is C-E-G, but you could add a 7th to get more jazz going, making the chord C-E-G-B. This is extremely common in deep house chord progressions. You can even try to add some minor to the exact same chord by changing the B to an A (C-E-G-A) or even adding the A on top of the 7th (C-E-G-B-A). \n\nTLDR::: A scale is the basic framework when you start making music. You get a set of notes that you can play with. This is limiting and this is good when you start. Instead of focusing on 12 notes per octave, you can tune it down to only 7 - considering the major and minor scale. \n\nIf 7 is too much you can even use pentatonic scales, so you only have 5 notes to work with (in our case C maj pentatonic is C D E G A)\n\nJust to say again, this is something good when you start, as you gather more knowledge these scales become more ingrained in your music making, and you'll learn to borrow notes from other scales to make up melodies - for example, D-F# make a really nice interval, but the F# is not present in the original scale, still you can transition from a A minor chord (A-C-E) into a D/F# (F#-D-G-A) and still sound good. You can even go as far as changing the key from C major to E minor to use the F# more frequently, especially during an extended breakdown, where you could want to express more intensely a particular emotion. \n\nDon't mind the names of the intervals so much, just be aware that they are there, and they have specific characteristics.

{"body": "So no way to yell POWER LEVEL OVER 9000?!?!?! ;)\n\nThe rework isn't bad, but I wonder if it is a huge departure. The idea of a tanky ADC isn't impossible. Graves is a good showing, he has shorter range but his passive gives him decent early game tankiness without him building any. So I think taking Urgot into a completely different direction such as this would be better as a new champion.\n\nThat being said, I do and don't like some of the concepts. \n\nPassive - Other than gating his strength through missiles and power, it gives a marginal movement speed boost. The thing is, he gets it only with power (which is not hard to get so not a big drawback) and only as he runs low on ammo (which while not hard to do, seems counter intuitive in a way). From my perspective, you are encouraging a hit and run play style. You're giving a better chance of escape only after he deplete's his ammunition, but in a meaningful way (the gate of needing power which I really like). This is pretty wonderfully done for a passive. Let's see how it interacts with the kit, in my opinion.\n\nQ - Urgot is no longer an early game bully. His ability to cast multiple Q's is not completely dependent on farming well. And at level 2, I don't know just how many missiles you can have even with perfect farming. Gating it as such isn't necessarily a bad idea, but you have taken the bully out of Urgot, IMO. He now needs more late game power. Also, being his only way of gaining power outside of backing, I'd prefer it to be more spamable where his other abilities use the power to be effective. It's a hazard of the double resource.\n\nW - Hold to activate or toggle? Could be done either way, IMO, and it's not a big deal whichever way you choose. Just a question.\n\nSo, now it drains your missiles as fast as if you were attacking. I don't like replacing the auto attack of a marksman with an ability. They are supposed to be pretty heavily tied to their AA to dish out a large majority of their damage, and you've countered that. It's also essentially a watered down Lucian Ult but clunkier because you have to use the mouse to aim. If it offered more burst, I'd say go with it, but the fact is, it doesn't until late game. Early game, it's kinda useless to leave it on. I'd rather Q AA Q AA than hit this and essentially Q Q Q Q but at the same intervals. It's a nerf to his damage output.\n\nE - Another basic carry over and for good reason, this works extremely well with his current and your reworked kit. Definitely necessary. \n\nR - I like the idea of this ultimate. I have a couple of nit picks. One, Urgot now has no shield, nor any tank stats. Being within 1200 unit of the enemies might not be the best idea for him. It's fine if he is in that of the front line, but in a typical fight, being that close to the back line means he is in the front line. It's a step in the right direction from where he is today, but I don't know if it synergizes well with the rest of his kit. \n\nAlso, being able to pull an enemy to him is only useful in very niche situations. He is now a squishy ADC. Unless there's a tower or ally nearby, I'd rather let the slow sit and kite than anything.\n\nOVERALL - Your passive is best for kiting or burst and move. You don't have any real burst in the kit (unless I'm reading W wrong) so you are encouraging kiting. His Q and E work decently with kiting because they let you hit at long range. If you R and slow them, you can kite effectively as long as you have missiles. The range on a EQ as it is is huge. Outside of that though, I don't see where the kit really excels. W seems to gimp his damage output as compared to a Q - AA - Q - AA. The slow on ult is great, and grouping them is a fun idea and good to play with, but you need to be close in to grab many ( without innate tankiness ) and no AoE to speak of to make it effective to group them up. Perhaps if W launched a barrage at a target location, hitting all enemy champions therein, his ult would be better. There would be burst to aid in his passive, and it wouldn't gimp his damage output. As it is though, I'm not sold. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389282831", "subreddit": "LoLChampConcepts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "http://tinyurl.com/TheHiddenFilesExposingSatan\n\nTHE SECRET SACRED NAME FOR THE ALL POWERFUL IS SUMMERIZED BY ONE SECRET PHRASE \"Hayah Asher Hayah\". \n\n14 And G-d said unto Moses, “I Am That I Am.” And H- said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, ‘I Am hath sent me unto you.’” 15 And G-d said moreover unto Moses, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: ‘The L-d G-d of your fathers, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob hath sent me unto you.’ THIS IS MY NAME FOR EVER, AND THIS IS MY MEMORIAL UNTO ALL GENERATIONS.\n----------------\nExodus 3:14-15\n\n\"I AM THAT I AM\" - THE MOST POWERFUL DOESN'T HAVE A NAME. THE MOST POWERFUL IS................. INFINITE.\n\nTHE MOST POWERFUL CANNOT BE LIMITED BY A NAME. IT IS BLASPHEMOUS TO IMPOSE A NAME ON SOMETHING THAT IS INFINITE. YOU CANNOT SAY THE NUMBER \"45\" IS INFINITE - IT IS MATHEMATICALLY INCORRECT... \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet the Spirit of Truth guide you brother, sometimes things happen for a reason.\n-----------------------------\n\nBrother, we have been lied to by the Religious Institutions. Religious Institutions are not there to draw you to the ALL POWERFUL BEING, but are there to psychologically chip you with the false god of their religion. All Religions were created by the Freemasons to control and enslave different regions of society. Once you accept Religion, you become psychologically chipped to a RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION. You become a soldier of religion and a spiritual prostitute for FALSE MAN-MADE PAGAN GODS. \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nYou see brother, Satan is the adversary... He doesn't care how he is worshiped, whether it be with intent or not, Satan wants to be worshiped by man. Freemasons are the soldiers of Satan, they are the ones who start the religions so that Satan can be worshiped. In return, they become rich and powerful for as long as they live on earth. The goal of the Freemasons is to SPIRITUALLY PROSTITUTE PEOPLE to SATAN without the PEOPLE realizing it. Most people have been deceived by the Freemasons because THEY DO NOT KNOW THE SACRED NAME OF THE ALL POWERFUL.    \n\nTHE TRUE NAME OF THE ALL POWERFUL INFINITE CREATOR HAS BEEN HIDDEN AND KEPT SECRET BY THE FREEMASONS SO THAT THEY COULD ENSLAVE HUMANITY TO FALSE GODS. \n-----------------------------\n\nIn the ancient times, people knew the SACRED NAME OF THE ALL POWERFUL and they were so spiritually evolved that it was impossible to control society and build empires. EVERYONE WAS FREE...\n\nA group of man decided that they wanted to rule over mankind. They understood that in order for them to be successful, they needed to brake the spirit of the civilization that they wanted to enslave. TO DO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HIDE THE SECRET NAME OF THE ALL POWERFUL to stop the spiritual evolution of mankind and spiritually enslave mankind to them. These man instituted \"THE TETRAGRAMMATON\" which is \"Y-H-W-H\" to hide the SACRED NAME. \n\nThe Tetragramaton was the root of Religious Systems. IT ESTABLISHED THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FREEMASONIC EMPIRE. The Freemasonic Empire was not an Empire of the EARTH, BUT THAT OF THE MIND. The Freemasons understood that if you could control the EMPIRE OF THE MIND, you could control the Empires of the EARTH. That was the goal of the Tetragramaton, it was to hide the TRUE SACRED NAME behind a coded ACRONYM. That way people would no longer worship the ALL POWERFUL, but a meaningless ACRONYM.  \n\nFrom then on, different RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS started to emerge WITH EACH ONE HAVING THEIR OWN NAME OUT OF THE MASONIC ACRONYM. That's why you have some people saying Yahweh, Yahuwah, Yahawah, JEHOVAH and all these different names. People fight each other on which one is the right one because they have been MENTALLY chipped by different Religious Institutions. \n\nThe Tetragramaton allowed for confusion to occur and divide the kingdom of the All Powerful. People were no longer interested in being righteous and having a relationship with the ALL POWERFUL, they were interested in defending a religious institution. That is how the Pharisees came to be. They were so brainwashed in MAN-MADE Religion that they allowed for their spirit to become spiritually enslaved to it. The Pharisees were no longer setting their minds on Divine Interests, but man's. \n\nThe Mashiyach / THE SAVIOR realized that the pharisees were more interested in ENSLAVING THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION instead of showing them who the ALL POWERFUL CREATOR really is. \n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE PHARISEES KILLED THE MASHIYACH BECAUSE HE WAS EXPOSING THE FREEMASONS - THE BUILDERS OF RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS - TO CONTROL AND OPPRESS MANKIND.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, the Catholic Church is not what you think it is. Do you know what Christmas is about? It's about the celebration of the winter solstice. Do you know what the cross represents? It represents the 90 degrees between the solar equinoxes and solar solstices. \n\nBrother, the Vatican worships the sun, they are satanists - \"adversaries of the truth\". \n\nThe Mashiyach was not crucified. He was stoned to death and than he was hung on a tree. \n\n30 The G-d of our fathers raised up J-s whom you murdered by hanging on a tree. 31 Him G-d has exalted to H- right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are H- witnesses to these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom G-d has given to those who obey Him.”\n\nActs 5:30-32\n\nThe reason that they want you to appreciate the cross is because it is an instrument of death. It is the instrument to which they are trying to crucify YOUR SOUL. YOU WEAR YOUR CROSS AROUND YOUR NECK BECAUSE THE CROSS WILL KILL YOU AND YOUR SOUL. WOULD YOU WEAR AN ELECTRIC CHAIR AROUND YOUR NECK? \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLORD, GOD, JESUS... THEY ARE ALL BLASPHEMOUS NAMES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT REPRESENT THE REAL BEINGS, BUT THAT OF DEITIES CREATED BY MAN. \n\nJust why do you think that the American money says \"In God, We trust\". Because God is Satan. \n\nThe Freemasons were responsible for the creation of the name \"God\". When you worship \"God\", you worship the Freemasonic deity because they were responsible for instituting the name. \n\nJust what makes you think that name \"God\" is so different from all the false gods that the previous societies before this one worshiped? If you change the name - you change everything. The conquerors rewrite history - \"History is written by the victors\".\n\nThe Freemasons' holy book is the ENGLISH BIBLE because they have changed the TRUE NAMES with blasphemous ones to enslave society. \n\nFreemasons worship Lucifer. The difference is that the lower bottom ones don't know it. Freemasons created The Son of Lucifer through the name \"Jesus\" and snuck him into the bible to replace the True Mashiyach. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nHere is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.\n------------\n\nRevelation 13:18\n------------------------------\n6 is the number of man - 9 is the number of the adversary of man. \n\nAdd 9 at every letter.\n\nA 1 x 9 = 9 \n\nB 2 x 9 = 18 \n\nC 3 x 9 = 27 \n\nD 4 x 9 = 36 \n\nE 5 x 9 = 45 \n\nF 6 x 9 = 54 \n\nG 7 x 9 = 63 \n\nH 8 x 9 = 72 \n\nI 9 x 9 = 81 \n\nJ 10 x 9 = 90 \n\nK 11 x 9 = 99 \n\nL 12 x 9 = 108 \n\nM 13 x 9 = 117 \n\nN 14 x 9 = 126 \n\nO 15 x 9 = 135 \n\nP 16 x 9 = 144 \n\nQ 17 x 9 = 153 \n\nR 18 x 9 = 162 \n\nS 19 x 9 = 171 \n\nT 20 x 9 = 180 \n\nU 21 x 9 = 189 \n\nV 22 x 9 = 198 \n\nW 23 x 9 = 207 \n\nX 24 x 9 = 216 \n\nY 25 x 9 = 225 \n\nZ 26 x 9 = 234\n\n----------------------------------------­----\n\nL U C I F E R = 108 + 189 + 27 + 81 + 54 + 45 + 162 = 666\n\nJ E S U S = 90 + 45 + 171 + 189 + 171 = 666\n\nJesus = 666\n\nLucifer = 666 \n\n\n\"666\" is the mark of the beast. Most people won't accept it because the mark of the beast is not made to be removed. Once you accept it - you are most likely doomed to it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\n\nRevelation 13:16-17 \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED DURING THE INQUISITION IN THE NAME OF JESUS??? HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT JESUS??? WHICH BEAST IS BIGGER THAN JESUS??? WHICH RELIGION HAS KILLED AND TORTURED MORE PEOPLE THAN IN THE NAME OF JESUS? \n\nTHE WHOLE WORLD WAS CONQUERED AND CONVERTED IN THE NAME OF JESUS. EVERYONE ELSE WAS KILLED FOR NOT ACCEPTING JESUS. YOU TELL ME IF THERE IS A BIGGER BEAST THAN JESUS THAT REFLECTS 666.  \n\n21 “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old, ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ and ‘Whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.’ 22 But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, ‘Raca,’ shall be in danger of the council; but whosoever shall say, ‘Thou fool,’ shall be in danger of hell fire.\n\nMatthew 5 21-22\n\nThe Mashiyach preached love while people were burned because people were angry with their brothers and sisters. \"Jesus\" is a poster boy invented by the catholic church to push forward their agenda to dominate the whole world. \n\nI DON'T ACCEPT JESUS, I ACCEPT THE MASHIYACH SENT BY THE ALL POWERFUL \"Hayah Asher Hayah\" . \n\nThe Freemasons are evil people because they use people's ignorance against them. They spiritually prostitute people to Satan. That's there dirty little secret.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389330919", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": -15, "controversiality": 0}

These colors came from the Mexican anarchist movements that Sandino got involved with during his stay in Mexico in the early 1920s.[122]\nIn recent times, there has been a dispute between the FSLN and the dissident Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) about the use of the red and black flag in public activities. Although the MRS has its own flag (orange with a silhouette of Sandino's hat in black), they also use the red-and-black flag in honor of Sandino's legacy.

{"body": "What he's saying:\n\nEvery major scale has a corresponding minor scale with the same notes. For instance, think of the C major scale: C D E F G A B C. Now, if you start playing the C major scale, but at the 6th note of the scale (A) instead of the first (C), you get the corresponding minor scale: A B C D E F G A. This works for every scale.\n\nNow you might be wondering, \"if they have the same exact notes, what is the difference between the two?\" It's all about the note that you decide is the root (first note) of your scale. (Note - this is a slight simplification.) Choosing different root notes from the same scale will give a different feel to the song. The first, C, will sound happy (major). The 6th, A, will sound sad (minor). \n\nIn order to get the idea of the C major scale into the listeners mind, you want to establish C as the root. The easiest way to do this is to simply play it in the bassline - the mind will instantly recognize it as the root. If you don't want to do that, you can play a C major chord. (I'm assuming you know what a chord is.) If you don't want to do that, you have to have the melody suggest that the first is the root note by coming back to it repeatedly and emphasizing it on strong beats. \n\nWow I could talk about this stuff a lot.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389383749", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I agree with you ThoughtBrick, a lot of what has been written about kundalini \"is quite contradictory\".\n\n&gt;What is the difference between the life force and evolutionary force (kundalini)?\n\n\nThis is only my understanding in that I'm not citing ancient or for that matter modern texts.  A most unsatisfying answer which is true but confusing is that Kundalini is all of the above and more.  IMO it is helpful to first examine Kundalini in the context of an individual who experiences the rousing of It and It's movement.  \n\nThere can be an incredibly wide spectrum of ways in which the arousal and movement of Kundalini is experienced the first time and how the movement changes subsequently.  For the sake of clarity I will only touch on one obvious way that this occurs.  A student under the guidance of a wise teacher engages in practices that prepare the student and \"set the stage\" or cultivate the needed inner environment for the latent/dormant Kundalini within the student to be aroused.  Much of this preparation the wise teacher guides the student through involves two aims.  \n\nA. Developing the students ability to mentally/emotionally/physically tolerate and harmoniously control and contain increasingly higher energy levels.\n\nB. Removing or allowing to drop away those spiritual hindrances, mental &amp; emotional barriers/blockages, that restrict/prevent Kundalini from naturally moving within the student. \n\nThe student will reach a point where Kundalini will \"awaken\" rise and move.  And due to the guidance from the wise teacher the student will harmoniously integrate this amazingly powerful force of energy and learn how to express it responsibly. \n\nSo on the individual level Kundalini is an expression/manifestation of the \"life force\".  I'm sorry but I do not know what you specifically meant by \"evolutionary force\"  \n\nA comparison could be made to atomic energy which exists everywhere but only the most advanced scientists can \"awaken\" it and do so in such a way that the awakening is controlled.\n\n\n&gt;is the life force the same as what many would call the true or inner self or is this something completely different?\n\n\nThe \"life force\" is everywhere all the time and the \"true-self\" or Atman can be understood to be an individual experience or individual expression of that \"life force\".  At the highest level there is no differentiation between Atman and e v e r y t h i n g  manifest or un-manifest. From our \"normal\" consciousness perspective we see Atman as an individual expression as if each being has their own special personal Atman but from the highest view there is only one Atman.   \n\n\nMaybe I didn't clarify that at all for you but I hope I did at least a little or if nothing else didn't make it more confusing ! \n\n\nEdit- P.S. I'm sure sooner than later Marc-le-Half-Fool will respond to your questions far more eloquently than I have. \n\n :  )", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389388271", "subreddit": "kundalini", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A computer is basically a really really fast calculator.  How does that become a video game, a math program, or a programming language?  \n\nFirst there is something you must understand about numbers:\n\nYou are used to using these symbols to count things: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  \n\nYou think they are numbers, but they are not.  They are just squiggles on a page, or in the dirt, or on your computer screen.  They are just glyphs, and they really could be shaped like anything and still be useful for counting.  The ancient Romans used the symbols:\n\n    I V X L C D M \n\nto mean what you mean when you write \n\n    1 5 10 50 100 500 1000\n\nbecause in ancient Rome, the glyphs 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 did not exist.  \n\nUsually, I V X L C D M were viewed as letters, spelled with, and pronounced as part of a word, but when it was time to do math, or accounting or something, those specific letters were used to stand in for  the values 1 5 10 50 100 500 1000.\n\nJust like in ancient Greece, they used the glyphs Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ϝ Ζ Η Θ to mean what you mean when you write 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, again, just straight up stolen from their alphabet but interpreted as numbers.\n\nSo what's special about that?  You'll notice the Greeks did not have a zero, they had to invent a clever way to deal with zero values when they were doing astronomy, or whatever.  And the Romans did not have a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or a 6... so how did they represent 2, or 3?  Like this:\n\n    II III\n\nSimple, right?  Just keep tacking on glyphs to the right.  So far so good.  But what about 4 or 6?  IIII and IIIIII are OK, I guess... but it would get pretty unwieldy pretty fast, so they did this instead:\n\n    IV VI\n\nIn order to demonstrate the difference between 4 and 5, you place a lower denomination glyph (in this case I) to the LEFT.  In order to demonstrate the difference between 5 and 6, just tack on the smaller denomination glyph (I) to the RIGHT of the higher value glyph (V), like you were doing before i.e. IV means 4 because it is 5 minus 1... but VI means 6 because it is 5 *plus* 1.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with computers?  Well it's important to understand that to know what binary actually *is*, and why we use it.  \n\nNotice that the ancient Greeks used nine glyphs to represent the numbers 1 through 9.  That's nine glyphs, not ten like we use.  (The Romans didn't even use nine, they used seven.)  The idea here is that the number of glyphs you use is arbitrary, and there are different orders you write them down in to indicate value, like the Roman example above.  The Greeks would have written 666 as ΧΞϜ because Χ means 600, Ξ means 60 and Ϝ means 6.  But the Romans would have written it as DCLXVI.  The symbols go from larger stuff to smaller stuff as you keep reading to the right... but for a Roman, CDXLIV means 444... because you're \"taking away\" when you have something smaller to the left of something bigger. \n\nThe fact that \"left of...\" and \"right of...\" mean different things is a problem; it complicates calculations, but worse: you have to keep adding new glyphs for larger and larger values.\n\nOur system has one nice feature and that feature winds up being the most important thing: columns.  We use ten and only ten glyphs, and indicate \"multiply this by 10\" by shifting the glyph one column to the left and putting a 0 in the empty space if necessary to clarify what column the glyph is supposed to be in.  Even when they are left-justified, you know when looking at \n\n    6\n    60\n    600\n\nwhich of these values is the biggest, and that each one is exactly 10 times as large as the last one.  You also know that 605 is just a bit more than 600 and you know that 650 is substantially more than 600 because of the column of the glyph 5.  Additionally, things like 46 and 64 are completely unambiguous.  There's no way you're going to mistake \"46\" for the value two , because it's \"4 less than 6\".  Likewise, \"64\" always means \"4 more than 60\", it never means ten (\"4 more than 6\")\n\nThis is what is mean by saying we use a \"base 10\" or \"decimal\" counting system.  Ten symbols, and each time we reach the end of the symbol set, we loop it and add one to the \"next\" column (since there's only one \"next\" column now), the way a car's odometer ticks over, and that indicates that the value is ten times what the glyph is being used to represent it... or 100, or 1000, and so on as the columns stack up.\n\nSupposing you don't like ten?  Supposing you want only eight glyphs for some reason before that odometer ticks over?  Easy, just use 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 since you already think of those as numbers anyhow.  Watch the counting increase:\n\n     1\n     2\n     3\n     4\n     5\n     6\n     7\n    10\n    11\n    12\n    13\n    14\n    15\n    16\n    17\n    20\n\nThis is known as \"Base 8\" or \"octal\".  Notice that 10 looks like it means ten but in this case it really means eight, and 20 looks like it means twenty, but really it means sixteen.  Put that on the back burner for a sec, and now lets look at what happens if we want *more* than ten values before we add a column to the odometer... say, for example sixteen.  We can recycle the glyphs 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 for the first ten digits, since we already think of them as numbers, but what about eleven through fifteen?  Let's just do what the Greeks and Romans did and use letters.  So here's our digits now: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F and here's how it looks to count with them:\n\n     1\n     2\n     3\n     4\n     5\n     6\n     7\n     8\n     9\n     A\n     B\n     C\n     D\n     E     \n     F\n    10\n    11\n    12\n    13\n    14\n    15\n    16\n    17\n    18\n    19\n    1A\n    1B\n    1C\n    1D\n    1E\n    1F\n    20\n\nThis is known as \"Base 16\", \"hexadecimal\" or simply \"hex\".   Again, notice how 10 is the sixteenth value, and 20 is the thirtysecond value.  \n\nSo now consider \"Base 2\" a.k.a. \"binary\": \n\n        0\n        1\n       10\n       11\n      100\n      101\n      110\n      111\n     1000\n     1001\n     1010\n     1011\n     1100\n     1101\n     1110\n     1111\n    10000\n\nThat's zero through sixteen right there.  Why is that so useful for computing?  Because as you can see, you can easily represent any number, it just gets longer and longer the higher you go... but the two glyphs you use as your Whole Entire Symbol Set to represent all numbers, is 0 and 1.  And that just happens to be the same number of states a light bulb can be in, On or Off; powered or unpowered.  A lightbulb... or its microscopic counterpart, the transistor.\n\nSo now here comes the Computer, or more precisely the CPU (\"central processing unit\").  It's an electric device made up of millions and millions of transistors, and can represent any plain old counting number just by switching transistors \"on\" (1) or \"off\" (0).\n\nWe have devised many different ways over the years to express many different ideas as numbers, so that they can be \"calculated\" i.e. worked on, one way or another, by a computer.  \n\nMuch the same way Romans used I V X to mean numbers when in a math context (when most of the time we think of them as letters), we have used numbers to mean letters in certain contexts within the computer.  The numbers \n\n    65 (101 octal, 41 hex, 1000001 binary)\n    66 (102 octal, 42 hex, 1000010 binary)\n    67 (103 octal, 43 hex, 1000011 binary)\n    68 (104 octal, 44 hex, 1000100 binary)\n    69 (105 octal, 45 hex, 1000101 binary)\n    ..\n    90 (101 octal, 41 hex, 1011010 binary)\n\nusually just mean the numbers sixty five through ninety, but when we are processing text, they stand for the capital letters A B C D E .. Z.  This is part of something known as \"ASCII encoding\"... the \"encoding\" is called encoding because we're literally taking what you and I think of as letters, and giving the computer a way to treat them as numbers.  So when you type something into your word processor like TO BE OR NOT TO BE, somewhere deep inside your computer it's actually dealing with the binary versions of the numbers 84 79 32 66 69 32 79 82 32 78 79 84 32 84 79 32 66 69. (The \"space\" character is 32 in ASCII)\n\nThe thing is, a calculator isn't much good without math operations like +, -, × and ÷.  So, much the same way as we know that I V X might mean \"i\", \"v\", and \"x\" or they might mean \"1\", \"5\", and \"10\" depending on the context, and the computer sometimes thinks of  the binary 1000001 as the number 65 or as the letter A depending on the context, sometimes it does not think of it as data at all.  Sometimes, it's an instruction, like +, -, ×, ÷ for example.\n\nSo how do things like video games work?  Let's do a simpler example, like a graphical image.\n\nWhat a picture of a cute kitten is, as far as the computer is concerned, is a stream of pixels made up of their XY co-ordinates on the screen, and colour data.  Conceptually, it is basically this:\n\n    Pixel 1 of \"kitten.bmp\": x1 y1 red 80 green 90 blue 3\n    Pixel 2 of \"kitten.bmp\": x1 y2 red 80 green 92 blue 3\n    Pixel 3 of \"kitten.bmp\": x1 y3 red 79 green 91 blue 2\n    ..\n    Pixel 307,200 of \"kitten.bmp\": x640 y480 red 50 green 255 blue 70\n\nAny manipulation of that image is ultimately going to boil down to adding or subtracting from those numbers, and then displaying it on the screen by telling the graphics hardware to paint pixel 1 with the colour 80/90/3, pixel 2 with the colour 80/92/3, pixel 3 with the colour 79/91/2 and so on. \n\nAudio can also be represented as numbers.  It goes, very *very* vaguely something like this:\n\n    Second 0.001: frequency 400 volume 50\n    Second 0.002: frequency 401 volume 51\n    ..\n    Second 10.000: frequency 1000 volume 100\n\nand playback consists of the CPU telling the audio hardware to emit a noise that is 400 Hz and 50 mW of power for 1 ms, and then to emit a noise that is 401 Hz and 51 mW for 1 ms, etc.\n\n...and when you consider that video is really just a bunch of images presented in high speed at the same time as some audio, and for the most part a video game is just a combination of still images, video, audio and text... well, I'm sure you see where I'm going by now.  All those data types are ultimately just numbers deep down, and what happens to them are just enormous, vast series of calculations, and the resulting numbers are interpreted as instructions to be sent to the graphics hardware or the sound hardware.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389402885", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "All the answers you got are really really shitty, so let me show you what binary ACTUALLY is.\n\nBinary is just as number system same as Decimal. I'm sure you know Bi means two and Dec means ten. But if you ever take a number theory course you will learns theres infinity many number systems you can have. They all just represent the maximum value, of any one place value.\n\nIn binary there is only two numbers, 0 and 1. In decimal there is ten numbers, 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. In hexadecimal there is sixteen numbers. Now this is where what I'm explaining could either start to make sense or i will loose you. We use base 10 (Decimal) our whole lives thinking you can only have 0-9 as numerals. But they are anything we make up that denote a value as a single digit. For hexadecimal we use, 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b v d e f. That is just because we haven't created a single digit character that has a value for anything above 9, in our part of the world anyways.\n\nNow when you get back to binary, we will just use a 8 bit number like computers do to make it simple. \n\n    0000 0000  is zero\n    0000 0001  is  1\n\n    0000 0010  is 2, we just carried the number over to the next place value just like when counting from 9 to 10\n\n    0000 0011  is 3, we keep the second place value the same and count off the lower digits like going from 10 to 11 to 12, the 'tens place' stays the same.\n\n    0000 0100   is 4, we filled up our 2 place values and carried them over to the next one similar to going from 099 to 100\n    \n    0000 0101  is 5, we just start over at the lowest place value and count up\n\n    0000 0110 is 6\n    0000 0111 is 7\n    0000 1000 is 8\n    0000 1001 is 9\n    0000 1010 is 10\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each place value always has its own value so you don't have to actually count up each time.\n\nKeeping the theme of 8 bits there value would be\n\n      0  0  0  0 0 0 0 0 \n    128 62 32 16 8 4 2 1 \n\nSo in order to make the number 10 thinking this way. You need the only combination that adds up to 10, 8 + 2.

{"body": "Good job!\n\nIn 1997 a friend and I saw a sea turtle climb up out of the ocean,  dig a nest,  and lay eggs.  We reported it,  and it turned out to be a highly endangered Kemp's Ridley.  It was one of only 9 nests found in entire the US that year. (In the last few years there have been [200-ish nests found per year](http://www.nps.gov/pais/naturescience/images/Kempsnests2012_692703_2.jpg).)\n\nAlll the eggs hatched,  and my friend and I were guests of honor at the release.  And we got [these nice certificates](http://i.imgur.com/HDasjIE.jpg).\n\nThe story was in the cover of one of those free newspapers down in Corpus Christi.  I had a copy of the paper,  but it was accidentally destroyed by the framing shop I sent it to.  If anyone from Corpus is reading this just happens to have a copy of that old newspaper (or knows where I can get a copy of the cover or something),  I'd be very grateful.\n\n\n**EDIT**:  Dug up some old pics.  Which I had to then photograph with my DSLR.  [Here's a pic of \"Bertha\"](http://i.imgur.com/IlW0z4x.jpg),  with a hooman for scale.  Hooman is my friend \"Pablo\",  not me.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in this situation,  this is what I remember the people at the Lab on South Padre telling us:\n\n * 1) Don't fuck with the turtle until *after* it has laid its eggs\n\n * 2) When it's done with its business,  approach it and take all the photos you can.  Especially of the top of the shell.  If possible,  take a picture of its underside (though this starts getting into pro-wildlife-handling shit).  The reason for the photos is that The Turtle People mark the hatchlings they release,  and they want to know if nesting turtles came from previous releases.\n\n * 3) Note where the turtle laid its eggs and notify the authorities  i m m e d i a t e l y.  Predation of nests is a problem.  The sooner you notify them,  the better the chance the babies have.  We didn't know this and delayed a day (because we were on vacation and slept most of the next day).  Luckily the nest was intact,  and all the eggs (110-ish) were collected and hatched.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389477057", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 239, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I came across this. Just thought I would post it... \n---------------------\n\n\nThe Council of Nicaea convoked by Emperor Constantine I.\n-------------------------\n\n\"Because the general Roman populous adored Julius Caesar, he was the most fashionable god in Western presbyters´ texts but was not recognised in Eastern or Oriental writings. Constantine´s intention at Nicaea was to create a new god for the Empire that would unite all religious factions under one deity and presbyters were permitted to debate and decide upon who the new god would be. Throughout the meeting, the howling factions were immersed in heated debates in attempts to promote their own divinity and the names of 53 gods were tabled for discussion; ´As yet, the new God had not been selected by the council, and so they balloted, in order to determine the matter. For one year and five months the balloting lasted´.41\n\nAt the end of that time, Constantine returned to the gathering to discover that the presbyters had not agreed on a new deity but had balloted down to a short list of five prospects, namely, Caesar, Krishna, Mithra, Horus, and Zeus. Constantine was the ruling spirit at Nicaea and ultimately decided the new god for them.\n\nHe determined that the names of his two first century descendants Jesu Cunobeline and Judas Khrestus be joined as one, Jesu Khrestus, and that would be the official name of the new Roman god.\n----------------\n\nA vote was subsequently taken and it was with a majority show of hands that both men became one God ...161 votes to 157. Following longstanding Heathen custom, Constantine used the official gathering and the Roman Apotheoses Decree to legally deify the new god for the rabble and did so by democratic consent and with the blessing of presbyters in attendance. A new Roman god was proclaimed and´ officially´ ratified by Emperor Constantine.42\n\nThat purely political act of deification effectively and legally placed Yesu Cunobeline and Judas Khrestus among the Roman gods as one individual composition today called Jesus Christ and lent earthly existence in two forms to the Empire´s new deity.\"\n\nSources: \n\nhttp://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/nicaea.html\n\nhttp://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_24.htm\n\nhttp://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-02/Npnf2-02-19.htm#P3125_1277828\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nHere is wisdom.

{"body": "Augmented 5th?  You mean an augmented triad?  I can think of two situations, and they're both dominant chords.  In the key of C major, you might see a chord G B D#, which is a V chord with a raised fifth.  The B and D# would resolve to C and E.  It's just a chromatic alteration.  The [Super Mario World ending theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mNZAZgXYJo) uses chords like these.  The first three chords, if it's in C, would be Dm9 - G+ - C.  The other type of chord, in Cm, would be G7b13, spelled G B Eb.  There, the Eb resolves down, not up.  You might see something like G7b13 - Bdim7 - Cm; you can figure out the voicing yourself.\n\nAs for that dim7, that's also a dominant function, usually in minor.  You can think of it as a rootless V.  V7b9 in Cm would be G B D F Ab, but Bdim7 is B D F Ab, the G7b9 without the G.  However, since the chord is completely symmetric, you can resolve to Cm, Ebm, F#m, or Am from this chord (by reinterpreting the notes, of course -- if you resolve to Am, you need to reinterpret the Ab as G#).  Now, you can use these as secondary dominants too, and something interesting happens when you do.  Say you're in Cm, so the secondary dominant would be the dominant of G; the dim7 chord that serves this function is F#dim7.  But instead of resolving to G7, you resolve to the dim7 instead, which is Bdim7.  But wait, Bdim7 has the same notes as Fdim7 (with some respellings)!  F#dim7 resolving to Fdim7 means that you can resolve a dim7 chord by moving the whole thing down a half step.  You can do this a whole bunch of times, in fact; Bach likes that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389557973", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Can only do X times per week or for XXX tokens per week. We aren't allowed any freedom or fun in the way we play the game.

It's not about a lack of content (though it doesn't help) but the direction SE has taken it.\n\nThey are so paranoid about RMT &amp; RPG crossover players that they have engineered the game so nobody can do anything different from one another.

{"body": "I posted it before but I think it works here too. To wit:\n\nIt all starts with an idea. This idea may come at any time. You may be riding a motorcycle through the desert. You may be backpacking in Europe with no one to keep you company but a monkey and an atlas. You may be taking a huge dump. Actually; you're probably taking a huge dump.\n\nOnce you have this idea it all boils down to a few basic things:\n\nYou know how to play the guitar? Good. Pick a key. Start with the \"one\" of that key (the \"one\" of C is... you guessed it; C). Now move on forward until you find what chord is next. It's probably the \"five\". I'm not going to give you a theory lesson right now. Figure it out. It may be the \"minor six\". Go for it. Just play these chords until you find the right next chord. It may take a while. Don't give up. There's only one right chord. You'll get it.\n\nNow that you have an idea/concept/inspiration and a chord structure just start strumming it in circles. You'll get a rhythm for it after a few play throughs. Now add some words. They don't have to be good. Just sing the first thing that comes to mind that makes sense with the theme that you've chosen. This should be the melody. This isn't necessarily the words you'll end up with.\n\nOnce you write a vocal melody you'll probably find that the chords that you wrote are absolute horse-shit. They don't fit with what you wrote. There are better chords out there. Now find the right chords. Again.\n\nOnce you've got a rhythm and a melody and a chord structure you're ready to write some real words! Excited? Don't be. It sucks. There's far too much in rhyme theory to go into right now and I'm going to assume that you've listened to some songs and you know basically what's going on. I'm going to suggest you focus on getting yourself out of the \"A B A B A B A B\" scheme (or even the A B A B A B C C scheme) and focus on making good rhymes.\n\nHere's what makes a good rhyme. It's simple and always right. I guarantee that if you find the sweet spot here you'll never go wrong. People love this shit.\n\nRhyme something with another rhyme that doesn't really rhyme. Here's an example that, shameless plug, I wrote:\n\n&gt;Now through the motorhomes and coffeeshops I'll fly\n\n&gt;Lookin' for your face in every window\n\n&gt;and from the comfort of this\n\n&gt;hotel mattress I\n\n&gt;will watch the news and make plans for tomorrow\n\nSee how close/slant and exact rhyme were mixed? This is an excellent technique. It keeps people on their toes. Try, also, to include something visceral. Use imagery, both visual and olfactory, to allow your listener to connect with what you say. Don't be afraid to be too specific. The closer to home, the worse it hurts, the better.\nConsider the idea of using internal rhyme to offset end rhyme (but not all the time) like in the following example:\n\n&gt;I'm laughing nervously cuz I can't see\n\n&gt;if my jokes are any use\n\n&gt;when our friends see me now I am\n\n&gt;terrified that they will know the truth\n\n&gt;honestly in the hours\n\n&gt;before you arrive\n\n&gt;you know you make me feel\n\n&gt;like everything well it all might be alright\n\nThat example includes both of the above-mentioned rhyme concepts. Get a feel for how long words take to say. Consider where the stress is in each syllable. Maybe read some Shakespeare so that you understand the subtle emotional differences between iambic and trochaic. Listen to the music inherent in the words. If you're really, really writing a song then every part should be able to stand on its own. The words should be a poem without the music. The vocal melody should sound good even if it's being played by a horn section on an easy listening record. The chord structure should move perfectly from one place to the next so effortlessly that the audience never even notices that there's any background music.\n\nNow; take everything I just said...\n\nand completely ignore it. When you write a song it should sound like you. Maybe you're looking for discord? Maybe you want to write licks. Maybe what really calls to you is three chords over and over again until your eyes bleed. At the end of the day, you have to make the listener feel your hand like a father guiding his child gently towards the future. I should never feel like I could've written your songs. Your songs should have external quality, sure, but they should flow from you. And sometimes that means just going with it and seeing how it all falls out.\n\nIf you want to write like Connor Oberst, Tim Kasher, Bruce Springsteen, or any number of other great lyricists (all debatable, I'm sure), however, the one thing you definitely have to do is take. your. time. and be sure that you do it right, whatever that means.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389671946", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "***WARNING: LONG***\n\nI gave up on competitive running halfway through my senior year track season. I was pretty good, but nowhere near the best runner out there (2:10 800, 4:48 1600, 10:34 3200, 17:24 5K), but I had the mixed blessing of being on a really good distance/cross-country team my senior year (short rundown of team history: team was bad enough freshman and sophomore years that I made varsity as a sophomore, then took advantage of the varsity workouts for three years to keep up as the rest of the team got better).\n\nThe process of me running out of fucks to give started junior year in track. With three weeks to go until League Finals, I got a stress fracture. I'd been poised to pull out a huge time drop on the 1600, just hit 4:50 that day, in fact, but then the season was shot. So I healed up and focused all of my energy on the next year's cross country season, and actually improved substantially, to the point where I dropped over a minute off my 5K (I'd been running at ~18:30s the previous season). The rest of the team had been doing the same, so we had gotten really damn good.\n\nWe swept our league meets, which consisted of 4 absolute dominations and one tense confrontation with our league rivals (who happened to be the 6-year defending league champions), then narrowly won League Finals despite half the team having a bad day. I didn't see the warning signs: our 4th position freshman phenomenon had been falling apart for the last couple of weeks, our solid third seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown every time I saw him, and it had fallen to me, normally fifth, and our sophomore sensation, a colossal wildcard and most often sixth, to carry League.* So I should have figured on not everyone performing their best, whether due to nerves or overtraining or whatever, but I didn't, and I held out hope that we'd qualify for State, and I ran as hard as my fucking legs would carry me, spent the next hour alternating between being curled up in the fetal position and violently vomiting everywhere, and when the results came out, we'd placed sixth. Not even close.\n\nSo I spent most of the offseason making up bullshit reasons to not go running because the very thought of it made me nauseous. Then track rolled around, and I was way out of shape, and after spending the entire season playing the catch-up game I decided this shit was for the birds and if I could manufacture enough fucks to give to make it through the season, beat my 4:50 mile time and beat this dude I hated named Joey, I would never have to stand on another starting line ever again. Well, I ran a 4:48 at League Finals, then beat Joey in the 3200, and I breathed a huge sigh of relief that I could finally stop giving a shit about competitive running and move on with my life. I still run for fitness with a group of guys I met in college, but every time they enter a race I have a convenient conflict and can't make it.\n\n**If anyone's confused, cross country scoring gives 1 point to 1st place, 2 to 2nd, and so on, up to each team's fifth runner. Low score wins. Once we won a race on a sixth-man tiebreaker: the order was (H=other team, V=my team) H H V V H V V V H V H. They would have won by 1 if it hadn't been for me, our sixth, beating their fifth and pushing it from 27-28 to 28-28. In that situation it goes to the sixth, and I'd obviously beaten their sixth, so we won.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389761380", "subreddit": "gifs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Man, I really shouldn't have gone drinking last night.\n\nSo, last night was a blur, I have a massive hangover, and there are flipping feathery things sprouting out of my back. What did I do last night? I don't remember anything. And I need to sleep off this hangover.  \n\n---\n\nWell, I'm on national news, and I'm an idiot.\n\nYou'd think that after rewaking up, I would be a little more rational. Nooo, the first thing I did after eating some food was to jump off of my tenth story apartment buildings roof. And you know what? I actually flew. It was more of falling not so gracefully, but whatever.\n\nFlying's cool, it's a lot like swimming if you ask me, at first it was really scary, and I was afraid I w a s gonna fall to my death, but after I caught on to the whole not falling thing, I think I did pretty well. My only complaint is that city air is really smokey. Somehow it looks, and smells, a lot better on the ground then the sky. Everything was going great untill I got caught by a gust of wind and crash landed in the city park.\n\nI must've looked like one of God's angels the morning after a heavenly bachelor party. Shirtless, (what, you think my shirts just magically could fit a fifteen foot wingspan) messy hair, and smelling terribly of alcohol. I was a mess. \n\nAt least I had the good sense to not be noticed on my way back to my flat, right? Wrong. Like an idiot, I took the subway. \n\nThat's when the cameras caught up to me. Apparently someone had seen me fall out of the sky and land in the park. Naturally, they thought I was and alien.\n\nAfter they interviewed me on live television, things started happening really quickly, too fast for me to handle. The FBI, CIA, NSA, or some other three lettered acronymed government branch showed up, and asked me a bunch of questions about the night beforehand. Most of which, I couldn't answer, because I was black out drunk most of the night.\n\nThen the government dudes tried to take me somewhere, but I didn't want to go, because there is no way in hell I want to be taken to a lab and cut open, be forced to run tests, and be studied forever. I don't want none of that area 51 carp either. \n\nThey tried to make me go by force, but I got out of their grip, and flew away. Apparently,they don't want to accidentally kill me, so once I started flying they let me go. Now I'm not actually sure about what to do, I wish I could go to my flat, but it's probably swarming with people by now. I hope my cat is okay at least.\n\nI guess this is my life now, on the run. Funny, I always pictured it to be more glamorous and exciting. I am glad that the government guys gave me a shirt and coat with holes cut in them at least.\n\nI hope they don't have any sort of trackers in them or anything, because I'm screwed then. Maybe I can fly down to Florida or something, and I can ditch the coat,because it will be warmer there. At any rate, I need another nap. How much was I drinking last night?\n\n---\n\n-014\n\nThis is my first monologue that I'm really happy with. I'm really trying to work on character voice and flow.

{"body": "Horizontal is pretty easy. I think the best way to start is by learning the whole-step/half-step pattern of the scale you want to play (ex: major scale is wwhwwwh). Then just play it on one string at a time.\n\nAnother way is to learn the intervals in the scale (ex: major scale contains root, maj 2nd, maj 3rd, perferct 4th, perfect fifth, maj 6th, maj 7th) and then play those on one string.\n\nAnd one final way is to learn the actual notes of the scale you want and play it on one string (ex: C major is C D E F G A B). This will help you learn the notes of the fretboard a bit, especially if you say them out loud.\n\nThese last two methods, imho are very good ways of learning some theory, because you're thinking in terms of intervals and notes instead of patterns.\n\nOne last thing you can do to take a shortcut is to realize that one vertical scale pattern (like the ones /u/tsupaero linked) can be stretched out onto one string. So let's say you play Eminor with 3 notes per string. \n\nOn the 6th string you play E F# G (frets 0 2 3). then on the 5th string you play A B C (also frets 0 2 3). Well you can take those three notes on the 5th string and move them down to the 6th string, you just have to move them 5 frets higher up the neck. So now on the 6th string you can play 6 notes instead of 3: E F# G A B C (frets 0 2 3 + 5 7 8). Similarly you can add the notes of the 4th string on top of those (D E) and you get a full octave scale.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to ask anything if unclear.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389796781", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "While I don't explicitly advocate violent revolution as a means to achieve liberty (though there are successful examples of violent revolutions in defense of liberty, like the American Revolution and to a degree even the French Revolution), I do recognize that violent revolution is not immoral per se. As to the issue of states replacing violent revolution, [it turns out that those nations that did industrialize without a violent revolution were the ones that quickly fell into tyranny, while those that did achieve victories for liberty through violent revolution were more successful.](http://mises.org/journals/lf/1970/1970_07.pdf)\n\nAs Murray Rothbard said (my notes will be in brackets):\n\n&gt;is joined in this historical error by many historians and by the great mass of the American public, who have thereby been lulled into repudiating revolutions and denying their own revolutionary past. This old bromide is, however, dead wrong; we might almost say, in reverse, that most revolutionary governments have been far better, on balance, than the ones overthrown. Even the French Revolution, much abused by Tories and Conservatives then and since [from Edward Burke to Russell Kirk to many more conservative], and surrounded by armed invaders from counter-revolutionary crowned heads, was on net balance a great blessing for liberty and free enterprise. The French Revolution swept aside crippling feudal and mercantilist restrictions and oppressions, and set the stage for agricultural liberty and for the Industrial Revolution in France. I will here simply refer Mr. Read-and other counter-revolutionaries-to a monumental work of comparative history, Barrington Moore's *Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy*. Moore conclusively demonstrates that, in contrast to Tory mythology, it was precisely through violent revolution that America, Britain, and France were able to achieve as much liberty ar.d democracy as they did; in contrast, it was those countries which industrialized ~ i t h o u ti nternal violence: e. g.

{"body": "Ohhh... you've got it a bit backwards there.  And your bra size has everything to do with your actual size.\n\nThe band size (the number, 32, 30, etc) is approximately your underbust measurement.  So if you measure 30 inches around, measured snugly, under your breasts, usually in the inframammary fold, then you are approximately a 30 band.  Depending how \"squishy\" you are, you could go up or down in that measurement.   And if you measured 31 inches, you could go up or down.  Most people go down, so 31's usually wear 30s.  But it's usually the reverse below 30, because below 30 most women tend to have less squish.\n\nYou then calculate the cup letter by measuring loosely around the fullest part of your bust.  It will differ based on your posture, because boobs are squishy :) So most people take a measurement bending over, and a measurement standing up, and choose one of them or average them.\n\nFor every inch bigger than your underbust that your bust is, you add one \"letter\", but they aren't just ABCDEFGH etc...  we usually use UK sizes because UK sizes are more consistent, and UK brands generally have their act together, whereas US brands do not.\n\nIn UK, the sizes go A B C D DD E F G GG H.... so if for example your loosely measured full bust measurement is 5 inches bigger than your snug underbust measurement, you'd choose a DD, because that's the 5th cup letter on the UK size list.\n\nIt's not too complicated.  But it's also only a starting point (an important one!!)  Armed with your \"statistically correct\" size, you'll find that different brands fit differently, and even different bras within the same brand fit differently.  You may find you're a 30E in one brand and a 32E in another, and a 32DD in another...\n\nAs a starting point, it's an important one, because women are usually wearing bands that are 4-6 inches too big for them, and cups that are 2-3 inches too small.  It's almost even more important to know the rules of bra fitting, like that the centre of the bra between your boobs needs to lay flat on your breastplate, and the underwire should not touch breast tissue nor should it hover over your chest... basically the wire can only provide support if it lays flat against your ribs, directly underneath your boobs, without gapping or straining.  But most women don't know this, and the sizes they try don't have any hope of getting close to these fit guidelines.\n\nSo visit /r/abrathatfits!  I can't explain everything here and it'd be a waste since they have it ALL covered over there, and have lots of bra experts who want to help women find the best fit if you want to pose a question.  :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389814953", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

For beginners on any musical instrument, I would take some crash courses on music theory, just to understand the basics, and especially if you want to improve at your instrument.

On a guitar, you can explore this relationship by playing an open string, and then the eighth or ninth fret. A sixth above a G is an E. \n\nWithin the G major chord on a guitar, as you mentioned, it consists of various combinations of the notes G, B, and D. More specifically, G B D G B G.

If you play an open G and open high E string on guitar, that is the sound that a sixth makes. Within the G major chord on guitar, the most prominent sounding sixth is that between the open B string and third-fretted high G on the E string. \n\nI'm sure this explanation was confusing and I'll be happy to go into more detail (or less detail) if you like. \n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389821773", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

The D# sounds like it's going to resolve to E or E#.  Similarly, the Ab major scale goes Ab Bb C Db Eb, while the G# major scale goes G# A# B# C# D#.  Same notes, but they're labeled differently so that they go up by step.  G# to C, in particular, is a diminished fourth, while Ab to C is a major third.  If you want the C to be the third note of a scale starting on Ab, you use Ab, not G#.\n\nNow, since Ab and G# sound the same, composers have *reinterpreted* one to mean the other when it suits them.  That kind of thing is usually unexpected.  There's a kind of chord called the augmented 6th chord that sounds just like a dominant 7th.  In C major, you'd have the chord Ab C Eb F#, which resolves to G B D G (this is bad voice leading, but anyway).  The Ab resolves down and the F# resolves up.  Now, if you were to write Ab C Eb Gb instead, instead of resolving to a G major, it would resolve to a Db major, which is unexpected!

For instance instead of just sticking to 3rds, do something like E B E G (going up) for the Cmaj arpeggio.

Trap is a \"flavor-of-the-year\" music genre, based largely in sounding \"gangsta\" and using EDM cliches - what does the concept of TRAP have to do with the desert and surreal, ancient, mystical landscapes? It literally could not be farther removed from the imagery I'm seeing here, which makes it seem really silly.\n\nIt's like finding an image of Yosemite National Park with a full moon and writing \"D U B S T E P\" - you are doing this landscape and your own artwork a disservice by making the focal point a generic, white-font music genre name. \n\nPoint being: I really support your artwork, but I think it would be far more effective if you created this for the sake of creating a surreal image, not arbitrarily promoting a music genre. When I was in High School, I had a lot of painting talent that I would spend all my free time harnessing... but very frequently I was using it to paint things related to crappy bands I liked at the time, or dumb lyrics, or dramatic quotes from angsty movies or books...

I wasted a lot time \"advertising\" for something that was a passing trend, and not enough time developing my own creative vision, and it really detracted from my work. \n\n[EDIT: Giving an artist constructive criticism is one of the most valuable favors you can give them - please don't downvote.

{"body": "[Still used to this day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY), the QWERTY layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer who lived in Milwaukee. In October 1867, Sholes filed a patent application for his early writing machine he developed with the assistance of his friends Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soulé.[3]\n\nThe first model constructed by Sholes used a piano-like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as follows:[3]\n\n    - 3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n     2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M\n\nThe construction of the \"Type Writer\" had two flaws that made the product susceptible to jams. Firstly, characters were mounted on metal arms or typebars, which would clash and jam if neighboring arms were pressed at the same time or in rapid succession.[4] Secondly, its printing point was located beneath the paper carriage, invisible to the operator, a so-called \"up-stroke\" design. Consequently, jams were especially serious, because the typist could only discover the mishap by raising the carriage to inspect what he had typed. The solution was to place commonly used letter-pairs (like \"th\" or \"st\") so that their typebars were not neighboring, avoiding jams. Contrary to popular belief,[5] the QWERTY layout was not designed to slow the typist down,[6] but rather to speed up typing by preventing jams.[4][7] (There is also evidence that, aside from the issue of jamming, keys being further apart increases typing speed on its own, because it encourages alternation between the hands.[6] Almost every word in the English language contains at least one vowel, but on the QWERTY keyboard only the vowel \"A\" is located on the home row, which requires the typist's fingers to leave the home row for most words.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389903498", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's hard for me to give advice, because I pretty much figured it out on my own, and have always had a natural ability to learn instruments and songs.  My strategy with the accordion (or any instrument) is just sit down with it and make noise for about an hour.  Get used to the movements involved with the arms and fingers.  Figure out which buttons make which sounds, and just make yourself familiar with it.  \nFor learning songs by ear, this is what I do.  Figure out if the song is in major or minor.  For example, I wanted to figure out the song Katyusha (It's a really fun song, I would give it a try if I were you).  It doesn't take long to realize it is in Minor.  I listened to the first note of the song and paused it.  I messed around until I found the matching note.  It was a D.  The song is in minor, so I knew I was going to be playing out of a minor scale starting with D.  I listened to the song a few times until I could play it over in my head.  I played a D and then I played the rest of the song in my head.  It ascends from the first note.  So I played D, then I naturally went up to E, and then to F.  I then realized that it goes back to the first note, then back to F, then climbs back down (F to E to D). etc.  So the song would go: D E F D F F E D E, then down to A.  If you just start on the first note, and have a very basic understanding of scales, you should have no problem.  \nThe bass notes are where things get a bit tricky (for me, anyway).  I really can't explain this as good as it should be explained because I play  12 bass note accordion, and don't have the same knowledge as people who have more buttons.  I basically start off on a D, then switch to A, then back to D, etc (I can't really explain how you know when to switch chords.  It's just something I learned from experience.).  In your case, since you have more bass notes (I assume) you would play D minor with your left hand, then switch to A7.  If I was unclear about anything, or if you have any questions, feel free to ask. Good luck, have fun, and never give up.

{"body": "*Wrong.\n\nThe number is a reference to the BAND.  The number is very close to the measurement done snugly underneath the bust.  For example, as a 28DD/30D, my snug underbust measurement is about 29 inches.  A lot of measurement guides recommend adding 4-6 inches to this number to get your band.  This is one of the areas where women go wrong in their measurement because this will NEVER work for ANYONE.\n\nThe letter is for the CUP.  It designates the volume of the cup, but it's relative to the band.  It is found, approximately, by measuring around the bust, then increasing the cup letter for every inch bigger than the band measurement.  It isn't ABCDEF though, it's A B C D DD E F G GG H... and etc.  The letters do get much higher than that though.\n\nIt's all just a starting point and it depends on each woman.  But one thing's for sure... a woman who measures out at 30F should NOT be wearing a 34C, it's a horrible fit and for some reason most women are just never taught what their bra should fit like, so they don't know any better.  And of course, men aren't picky... they are just happy to see boobs, they usually don't analyse the bra fit :P\n\nUnfortunately there isn't any sort of designation for the circumference of the cup.  That would be useful!  And it does make a difference in bra fit.  Differently shaped breasts need different shapes of cups.  Most women find this out through trial and error or recommendations.  But this is sort of an... in-depth part of bra fitting. Most women never get to this stage, they just stay in their 34Cs and have no idea there's more to it and that their straps should never dig into their shoulders and hurt, and their headaches are being caused by their bras and lack of support.\n\n[Hey, check out this image.

NSFW obviously.](http://bfcidade.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/real-dd-breasts1.jpg)  I look pretty much like that picture of the 28DD in the transparent white bra near the bottom left.  So I know that one's accurate.  Some of these aren't actually D/DD, they look bigger than that, but most of them are much more accurate than what people usually think of.  Pretty much the entire second row is wrong... none of those could possibly have a band bigger than 30, they're all slim... and I think most of them are F cup at least.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389974309", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Don't be afraid of saying exactly \"it seems that you are causing a majority of the wipes and even though I really like playing with you and want you in the group, I can't sacrifice 7 people's progression to keep one person in the group that isn't performing.  I want to keep you though, so do you want help to figure this out and work on it?\"\n\nThe key is the last part. Sometimes people will blow up and leave, but that is rare (and solves the problem). You let them know your intentions and put it in THEIR hands if they want to work on it or expect to get the boot. \n\nSo they want to stay and get better. GREAT!  Now to help them with this.  It is something that I have done on many, many occasions. \n\nFirst: isolate the main issue(s). Have them take a screenshot of their UI. Find out what type if system they have and input devices they use. See where their keybinds are. Have them record a video during a boss encounter!  The last might seem excessive, but it is probably the most important. \n\nLet's look at what this information can tell you:\n\nUI - are UI elements placed intelligently. Are they using the default UI?  Is the mob buff/debuff indicators still at the top of their screen while their own is all the way at the bottom. Are they a healer, but the party window is in the top left. Are they a DD, but everything is clustered on top of each other with unnecessary information (party list front &amp; center but enemy list/focus off to the side). \n\nKeybinds - do they still have everything bound to 1&gt;= or are they utilizing q e r f v c x z?  Are key skills bound?  Are skills grouped logically. (Proper binds change from regular mouse vs MMO mouse and controller). Do they still have shift modifiers flipping hotbar pages. Do they have alt-a/s/r still bound to initiate chat?\n\nRecord Video - this is the greatest source of knowledge. How does their mouse behave. Are they clicking skills. How are they targeting mobs/players? Do they keyboard turn? Do they strafe properly?  Do they stop doing their job while moving. Is there a delay in skill use? Are they keeping buffs up. Do they miss procs. Are they positioning correctly. How much of a delay do they have before reacting to aoe or changes. There is SOOOO much to learn from recording yourself. I'm good, but I STILL find so many errors when I watch videos after the fact. \n\n\nAfter you have this information, you will likely know where the problems are. All that remains is working with them to fix it. Show them how to rebind keys. Set up their UI for them. Watch their video together to point out areas they did well as well as opportunity areas. Get on the training dummies and work with them on rotation. Not just a stand still rotation, but be there with them and occasionally run after them and have them keep up their rotation while avoiding you (not full time, but at random times run at them and they have to dodge while continuing combat). Have them keep recording to track progress. \n\n\nThis is a lot if work for both of you. If they don't get better, follow through and kick them; however if they aren't getting better, then it is entirely because of lack of effort on their part. \n\nI'd much rather make a bad person good or a good person great then kick them for someone else. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389992809", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "score": 44, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**TL;DR:**  Challenge accepted.  This is difficult to explain to twenty-year-olds.  I doubt I can answer this to your satisfaction.\n\nI'm going to read between the (single) line of your question and assume that by \"physically\" you mean \"give me a physical metaphor that I can picture.\"  If this is what you want, I will fail.  I think my best strategy is to tell you about macroscopic angular momentum, spin in particular, and then tell you how an electron does and doesn't meet our macroscopic expectations.\n\nThere are two types of angular momentum:  orbital and spin.  Orbital angular momentum is how much an object is 'orbiting' about the origin of your coordinate system (imagine putting the origin at the sun, then Earth's angular momentum is R x M x V, where R is the Earth-Sun distance (center-to-center, roughly), M is Earth's mass, and V is the earth's speed).  The actual number you get depends on where you put your coordinate system (because R changes with the definition of the origin).  There is some vector algebra that I am leaving out in the spirit of ELI5.  If I had included it, I might have been able to convince you that an object doesn't have to be rotating in order to have non-zero orbital* angular momentum.  An object traveling in a straight line can have non-zero orbital* angular momentum.  And, just to emphasize, the actual value of it's orbital angular momentum that you calculate can be *anything*, depending on where you decide to call the origin.\n\nSpin angular momentum is special, more specific:  it is the angular momentum of an object, or system, that you calculate when you put the origin at a special place, at the instantaneous center of mass of the object (or system).  For example, a baseball traveling to home plate is spinning about its center.  The center is moving along the ball's path.  The ball's spin angular momentum is what you get when you add up all the little contributions of each little bit of ball rotating about the ball's center.  Different objects with different masses, shapes, and rates of rotation can each have a different value of spin.  Because spin is always reckoned about the center of mass, there is no ambiguity in the number you calculate.\n\nSo, can we think of the electron as a little ball?  No, not really.  The electron has mass.  It has charge.  It also carries around a magnetic field, like a little permanent magnet.   But no experiment to date can find any evidence that the electron has non-zero size.  It appears to be a point-particle.  Now absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  But if it were a solid ball of charge with a non-zero radius, there would be even more interpretive problems then there are now.  Maybe I'll get to that, ~~probably~~ definitely not.\n\nSo the electron has spin.  Moreover, every single electron has exactly the *same value* of spin (hbar/2).  They are all spinning the same amount, and they never change.  That's odd, to put it mildly.  \n\nHow do we know the electron is spinning?  What do we observe?  We observe the electron's *magnetic* interaction.  The electron is charged, and it possesses a permanent magnetic field.  We know this because it interacts with other magnets.  Well, when a *macroscopic* charged object spins, *it* generates a magnetic field (each little bit of charge travels in a circle, generating an electric current, which by all the experimental work of the 19th century is known to make a field).  So that's very suggestive.  The clincher is that when an excited atom relaxes via an electron spin-flip (the opposite of [ESR](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/molecule/esr.html)), the photon that is emitted carries away the angular momentum that the electron lost in the flip.  So it has something that behaves like honest-to-goodness spin angular momentum.  But there is no there there to do the spinning.\n\n**TL;DR2:** The electron has some qualities that can be interpreted in the same way as macroscopic equivalents:  namely mass and charge.  Other qualities, like position, momentum, and spin angular momentum don't scale up perfectly to the macroscopic world.  Electron spin is angular momentum.  It is conserved in interactions with other particles.  Its associated magnetic field behaves just as if it were generated by an infinitely small spinning ball of charge.  But the electron has zero size.  The 'rate' of spin never changes.  It has no classical analog.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390033107", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I personally recommend finding some music and playing it.  The Bach inventions are a good place to start, but there are plenty of method books with fairly easy literature that's not all Bach.  Yeah, it won't be easy, but do it slowly, one hand at a time at first, and repeat it over and over until you can do it well.  A lot of this music you can find online at IMSLP, to make it even easier.\n\nThere's also the question of what you plan on playing.  Are you trying to learn jazz improvisation?  In that case, there's the Jazz Piano Book, but you might *really* want to find a teacher.  If you're interested in more mainstream pop-like music, just get some songbooks.  You know what I'm talking about; they'll usually have the melody, a piano part that often includes the melody, and chord symbols.  You can improvise by playing the melody and the chords from the chord symbols, or you can just read the piano parts.  Since they're meant to be played for fun, ideally with people singing along, they're not usually too hard.\n\nIn any case, method books might be nice, but you should focus on playing music.\n\nBy the way, you know your scales on saxophone, right?  That's not really very useful when playing the piano.  The point of practicing scales is to give you muscle memory with the fingerings, and saxophone fingerings are not at all useful on piano.  Of course, knowing the actual notes in the 15 major and minor scales is useful.  Yes, 15, not 12.  Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, for example, has a prelude and fugue in C# major, not Db.  You still need to be able to understand the scale!  (But only 15 -- you're really not likely to see Fb major or G# major, at least not as key signatures; Bach has plenty of Fb and G# major *chords*.)  Anyway, you might want to practice scales on the piano to get the muscle memory, but don't wear yourself out.  Again, focus on music.\n\nOh, and try to find music that has fingerings written in.  This is more common than you'd expect.  Follow those fingerings to learn proper playing technique, like crossing over/under and such.  For example, a C major scale C D E F G A B C might be fingered, on the right hand, by 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, where the thumb (1) crosses under while you play the F to reach the G.  Also, your electronic keyboard is most likely not the best equipment around to learn to play keyboard.  If you stick to songbooks and such, you'll be fine, but if you want to play more traditional piano music, you'll want a keyboard with 88 weighted keys and a pedal.  You obviously don't need to worry about this right *now*.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390035038", "subreddit": "Learnmusic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you're playing 5+ strings, it will be a simple pattern repetition, but on 4 strings (still helpful to the 5+ cats), you should learn how to play a scale in two octaves, going up and down the neck differently. It's just a way to familiarize yourself with alternate positions for arps/runs and timbre variations (where you play a note on the neck is as important as the note you play) that may come in handy later on.\n\nOh, and with your triad studies, try going up/down the scale in thirds (C E D F E G F A G B A C B D C), then try 4ths (C F D G E A F B G C A D B E C), and so on with 5ths, 6ths, 7ths and beyond. This is all about muscle memory, of both the hands and the ears. On that note, try to sing the notes as you play them. \n\nPhysically saying the note while you play boosts your recall when you need that note later, and the memory of vibrations in your temple improves your readiness to play a note when you hear it in your head or wherever else.

{"body": "If you're totally new to music theory, it might be helpful to know a couple of basics. The C major scale is CDEFGABC. It is the only major scale without sharps and flats. However, though there are no sharps or flats, the notes are not the same distance apart. Most notes are one whole step apart (two frets). However E and F are only one fret apart, as are B and C. In other words, if you played every note on your C string in order, you would get (C) (C#/Db) (D) (D#/Eb) (E) (F) (F#/Gb) (G) (G#/Ab) (A) (A#/Bb) (B) (C). The pattern of half steps for a major scale is always 2212221, so a Cmaj scale on the C string would use these frets: 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 12. A major chord always uses the first, third and fifth notes of a major scale. The uke already has the C, E and G that you need for a C chord. You just have to raise the A string to C to make it fit the pattern. That's why it only takes one finger.\n\nThough the finger pattern is different, a C chord on a guitar uses the same notes as the ukulele (or a piano for that matter). As others have mentioned, the idea of a capo is to raise every string by the same number of half steps (a whole step is equal to two frets). A capo on fret 1 raises your tuning from G C E A to G# C# F A# (E# is the same as F). The distance between E and A is five half steps (E F F# G G# A). The distance between F and A# is still five half steps (F F# G G# A A#).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390086784", "subreddit": "ukulele", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Alkoholin todelliset ongelmakäyttäjät pyörii ihan muissa baareissa ja ihan muihin aikoihin.

Se että juottolat avaa aamulla ovensa klo 09:00 ja kahvassa roikkuu koko yön valvoneita täriseviä alkoholisteja on mun mielestä huomattavasti suurempi ongelma, kuin se että onko korkeatasoinen klubi auki vaikka klo 04:00 tai 06:00 asti. Klubithan joilla on 04:00 luvat eivät saa avata oviaan ennen klo 18:00, jollei siihen ole joku järkevä syy esim. ruoka tmv vrt. Ravintola Teatteri. Näin ei ole mahdollista pitää esim. aamubileitä avaamalla ovia klo 05.00. En tiedä miten Venue on tän hoitanut vai onko laki vaan Sörnäisten alueella. \n\n&gt; Sekään ei ole mennyt koskaan mun jakeluun, että miksi ihmiset eivät saa jäädä tanssimaan pilkun jälkeen muutamaksi tunniksi ravintolaan, kun baari menee kiinni tai siis alkoholin tarjoilu päättyy vaan ajetaan kaikki väkisin samaan aikaan taxijonoihin. Sehän on selvää että klubit kuolee ja kuopataan samantien jos ovet pitää sulkea klo 01.00 tai 02.00, eli samaan aikaan kuin baarit. Siinä vaiheessa lisääntyy ainakin allekirjoittaneen osalta ns. laittomien juhlien järjestäminen omalla vastuulla, eihän olisi enään muuta vaihtoehtoa jos haluu pitää itsensä hengissä klubihommalla, tai sitten muutto ulkomaille olisi ehkä se paras vaihtoehto. \n\n&gt; Noh, katsotaan ja odotellaan mitä nää fiksummat ihmiset taas päättävät.

{"body": "which one do you mean?\n\nin the first one, the scam is called the ['distress cull'](http://www.snopes.com/fraud/distress/stranded.asp) or 'distressed stranger'. The conman or conwoman pretends to be a person who needs help. If you either read the threads in Reddit's ['social engineering'](http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/) or books like Robert Caldini's ['Science of Persuasion &lt;short video explanation&gt;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFdCzN7RYbw) [{**a PDF summary here**}](http://lookstein.org/leadership/case-study/harnessing.pdf), most of us whether we realize or admit it, are on average more likely to donate to someone who is more like us in terms of measures like perceived socio-economic status etc.; in others words, not just Tokyo, but say, in LA, we're way more likely to 'loan' $10 to a well-dressed businessman or pastor even who indicates they have been mugged or lost than a clearly poor down on his or her luck homeless person. \n\nIn WDC, there is this black guy who dresses nattily in a suit, bow-tie, and crisp Southern accent with the finest of manners who'll target guests gathered outside to smoke at receptions and explain (falsely) he is an out of town pastor from Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee etc., just got mugged and needs $50 to get back to his hotel room etc. Add automatic [White Guilt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_guilt) for out of town white targets who might feel a bit guilty about daring to doubt a his story, and you've got a pretty smooth con.\n\nIn the fake monk scheme, they are leveraging two concepts:\n\n1. [Reciprocity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkyGOAWoYxA) - like the Hare Krishnas back in the US, even though a flower might be totally worthless and the target *knows* it is a ruse to make us feel obliged somehow, many people still feel obliged to reciprocate in some fashion. \n\n2. [Social proofing](https://fc.deltasd.bc.ca/~dmatthews/FOV2-00074762/S02DB0598.2/Cialdini%20airplane%20studies.pdf) The fake monks will show the mark a donation book where others have supposedly indicated their pledges. \"John Smith, USA - Y4,000; Alex Lamb, UK - Y10,000; \"Franklin Vassar, Canada - Y2000...\" This helps most marks who end up donating something into giving at least Y1000. The presence of fellow Western names who have also supposedly donated 're-assures' most fellow Western tourist &amp; expats.\n\nWith advance presence of mind, my idea for dealing with the fake Tibetan monks (they are actually Chinese conmen) is as follows:\n\n1. Establish that I am in a public place and determine where the nearest police box (koban) or police station is - or whether there is a cop nearby; I don't want to try this and have the guy suddenly angered, pull a knife or something and end up a foolish casualty. \n\n2. Enthusiastically respond to the fake monk. Indicate I would like to donate a huge generous sum which I write in his 'social proofing' book. Y1,200,000 or maybe 'only' Y350,000. And make sure to sign my name clearly and legibly for the sake of any future marks or the police. \n\n\"**A D O L F  H I T L E R -  Best Germany: Y1,888,8888!!**\"\n\nIf the fake monk is stupid enough to demand the sum I, Hitler {purposely chosen to be as offensive as possible - I'm not a closet neo-Nazi or anything - or maybe writing my name as [\"**FUCK YOU DOLPHIN!!**\" would provide more entertainment value](http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s13e11-whale-whores)}, have written, I've already called the police (it's 110) and when they arrive, patiently explain how/why I am being extorted and threatened for the princely sum of Y1.88 million. In any event, I will have ruined the 'social proofing' value of his donation book (unless he magically can identify all the neo-Nazi tourists in Asakusa). \n\nI dunno. This is just a stupid idea, perhaps. However, one motive for simply not doing as one would do back in NYC (eg. ignore these scam-artists) is that I believe there are occasionally decent people who do need help - and I hate the idea of Tokyo turning toward a 'fuck off &amp; die' mentality. Also, I hate the idea that it'll only be the savvy street-smart people who end up avoiding these con-artists and they'll end up victimizing someone more trusting &amp; less sophisticated.

{"body": "Okay, you're not crazy: chords and melodies are related. Often times one flows from the other. So take a deep breath, and I'll give you some concepts to help you understand some concepts. This might stray into the ELI15 range, as music theory is very difficult to explain to even a hypothetical 5-year-old.\n\nFirst of all, let's address what the Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory is trying to teach you in that chapter. What they're saying is that for any key, you can deduce a set of 7 chords that fit in that key. Because every single chord is a triad (1 3 5), and every note used in every chord fits in the key signature (fits in the scale), those chords will all \"fit\" in the key.\n\nThe concept we're getting at here is that we, as western listeners, really like the major scale (and it's relative, the minor scale). So much so, that we create entire chord progressions using only those 7 notes that belong to a single scale. This progression will, to us, sound logical and safe, and this \"safeness\" is a part of a lot of popular music. \n\nLet's look at the \"Key of C\" (That is to say, the C major scale)\n\n    C D E F G A B \n\nThose are the notes that make up a C major scale. As your book was instructing you to do, we can build chords using each note of the scale as the root note of a scale. If we follow two simple rules: every chord has to be a triad, and no chord can use any notes that aren't from the scale. Let's do it:\n\n    I:   C E G\n    ii:  D F A\n    iii: E G B\n    IV:  F A C\n    V:   G B D\n    vii: A C E\n    VIIº:B D F\n\nWhat that represents are the 7 triads that are possible to construct following the most important rule: not notes that AREN'T from the key of C. \n\nThe reasons we go through this exercise are numerous, but here are a few: \n\n1) This let's us compare songs that are in different keys. If, for instance, I found a chord progression was C-F-G-C, I might recognize that that is I-IV-V-I in the key of C. And then if I found another song that used the progression Ab-Db-Eb-Ab, it might seem that those two songs aren't very similar, as they don't share any chords. But you will find that this chord progression is I-IV-V-I in the key of Ab. They are in face the same chord progression, but they are in different keys. While the absolute pitches being played are different, the relationships between them are identical.\n\n2) This also gives us a handy list of chords we can use to start making our own chord progressions. If you wanted to write a song in the key of C, you already know 7 chords that fit well together. You can arrange them in pretty much any order, and it will work. Now, granted, some progressions will work better than others, but that's a large part of what studying music theory is all about. Without over complicating things, let's just say that any set of chords from that list (especially if it ends on C, the I chord) will work as a pop chord progression. \n\n-----\n\nNow on to melody. \n\nOnce you've got a chord progression, it is time for a melody. They way pop music typically works is that you have a chord progression which repeats over and over, and on top of that you have a singer who provides the melody. What notes does the singer sing? Generally speaking, the notes from the scale! If all of the chords are chosen specifically because they fit a certain scale, doesn't it make a lot of sense that the melody would come from that same scale?\n\nBut of course, we can get more specific than that. If we want the melody to sound like it fits perfectly with whatever chord we're playing, we can use *only the notes from that chord.* These notes are called *chord tones.* Singing a chord tone will *always* fit in with whatever chord you are playing. But if songs used only chord tones, they would get a bit boring and stale. So a good melody writer knows how to use *non-chord tones* to spice things up. Typically, these are notes that, while still part of the scale, aren't one of the 3 chords being used by the chord that's currently being played. Crafting a melody to fit over some chords isn't all that difficult. Stick to the scale, and you'll be fine. Making a *good* tune that is catchy and fits the lyrics...that is an art. \n\nTo see this in action, I will refer you to the Axis of Awesome. I like this video because the accompaniment is simple: just piano and guitar playing the same 4 chords over and over again, without anything fancy, but the variety of songs is really astonishing. But the thing to note, is that every single one of these songs uses a melody that is made up exclusively of notes *from the scale*. The order their in, the rhythms, and the words are what add the variety. \n\n[The video in question.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ)\n\n-----\n\nNow on to your last paragraph. The video above gives a great example of the most common case, in which the melody and the chords are separate entities that are related to each other. The piano and the guitar do their job, which is very repetitive, and the vocals sing all the different melodies. But of course, rarely is popular music so simple (though sometimes it can be). \n\nPart of making each song unique is coming up with unique ways to present the chord progression. Black Bird is a great example. The chord progression and the vocal melody are one thing, but the specific plucking pattern Paul uses on the guitar gives the song its unique, signature flair. But the same principles apply to that tune. The way he plucks the strings is certainly exciting and interesting, but at the end of the day, all the notes he's plucking form a chord progression. (Given, the chords used are a bit more complex than we've been talking about, but the same principles apply). At the end of the day, the melody of the song (the part you would hum or whistle) is the vocals. \n\nA Lady Gaga song with heavy production and synthetic sounds is no different. The chord progression is there, and she is using tricks to make the song unique and exciting. This is easily seen by when the Axis of Awesome does her song in their video. You still recognize the song, from the melody and chords, even without all the glitz and production. \n\nBut sometimes chords themselves can provide the melody. This can happen in a few ways, but the John Mayer example you mentioned is a good one to think about. The thing is, in the absence of some other melody, your ear will tend to focus on the highest sounding note of the chord progression. Clever musicians can use this to their advantage, and play a chord progression, but deliberately choose what notes the are placing as the highest sounding voice to also create a melody. Many times a good pop song will have an instrumental section in which this happens, but the highest notes of the chords are outlining the melody that is about to be sung. This is a clever way to prepare your ear for what you're about to hear, and makes it sound cohesive. But even if this is going on, it's not magic, it's the same principle. Pick a scale, stick to the scale, and everything will fit. Write a catchy melody, and place it as the top note of your chords (this works really well as most melodies tend to use mostly *chord tones* as we mentioned earlier). Done. \n\nAll that being said, not every form of popular music conforms to the simplistic major scale as its harmonic basis, and some don't use chords at all. Metal is a great example, in that it tends to be \"riff\" based instead of based on chord progressions. But your assertion that you \"barely ever hear music that follows such a simple explanation of chord progressions\" is clearly a bit off. The Axis of Awesome video shows you just one very common chord progression and how often it is used in popular music. And it really IS that simple. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390257493", "subreddit": "ELI5Music", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Great post, OP. Random replies\n\n&gt;If not for Carl Jung, I would not be writing this.  \n\nThank you Carl!  \n\n&gt; I am not so proud as to think that this is a story everyone wants to read, so for those who did, thank you.  \n\nIt's a perfect way to filter out the less-interested or the lazy, for whom Kundalini isn't much yet part of their path. Actually, your words show  humility. Dark nights are GREAT for that!!  \n\n&gt;The advice and guidance offered in other threads here has greatly impressed and humbled me, and I can only hope for such thorough and thoughtful guidance.  \n\nYou deserve as much as anyone else.  \n\n&gt;I feel that I should sum this up. For better or for worse, kundalini was my most important discovery in my post-Catholic life, and I suspect it will remain a focal point in my future pursuits.  \n\nNo small pronouncement. I know how that feels. Did you *discover* Kundalini like Columbus discovered America, or was it the Kundalini saying to you to follow that lovely lady, though which you were introduced to the new info? (Like Neo was told to follow the white rabbit. Sure, different mechanism, yet similar in that there was an invitation. )  \n\n&gt; But I find that the Westerner inside of me--well, the Westerner that I am--tends to get in the way. I try so hard to rationalize my experiences and feelings, to justify everything with the vocabulary and the theoretical frameworks I know, that I always end up feeling like an outsider looking in.  \n\nThis is the only notion that you share that I feel needs a little nudging or correcting. Probably, Northerners, Easterners AND Southerners all feel the same way about feeling like an outsider looking in. It will remain true for you until you choose something which leads you to become an insider.   \n\n&gt;I hope my reasons for posting here become apparent over the course of this explanation.  \n\nYour choosing to post in /r/kundalini is completely valid.  \n\n&gt;I know that in the current state of my spiritual journey it is very premature of me to even think of pursuing kundalini as my primary means of spiritual advancement.   \n\nAnd yet, you are considering it. Another big statement or consideration. This is something which may deserve a separate response, as in to give you ideas or some directions N S E W etc, to give you some guidance which you asked for. Smiles. \n\n&gt; I ultimately reached a point where I could no longer feel intellectually responsible with the worldview I had held as sacred and unquestionably true for so long. This, as you might imagine, was jarring: the sense of rightness and order, the promise of eternal life, the connection to something bigger than myself slipped away.  \n\nIt is my estimation that you will eventually come to value this jarring, once healed. Moving forward is an excellent way to accomplish this. Same thing with the dark night. A time of both purification and the beginnings of ***unlearning***, a word I am glad to see you using.  \n\n&gt;I steeped myself in philosophy, history, science, art, etc.--all of a distinctly western form.  \n\nThese are all valid pursuits, even if temporary, even if distractions.  \n\n&gt;I was never able to find anything close to peace, purpose, freedom from fear and doubt.  \n\nThese are the starting points for you, if you choose to expend or deepen your Kundalini knowledge, practice, etc.  These too I'll expand on separately.  \n\n&gt; A girl I was interested in invited me to do it with her, and I jumped at the opportunity, though certainly not because of the yoga.  \n\nPeople get married over similar situations. Nothing to be ashamed of. Kind-of a cute part of your story, actually.  \n\n&gt; I try so hard to rationalize my experiences and feelings, to justify everything with the vocabulary and the theoretical frameworks I know...  \n\nThis has been a common theme in the recent /r/K posts.  \n\n&gt; The first thing I feel I need is some serious \"unlearning.  \n\nThis is a universal truth to spiritual growth, and is not exclusive to Kundalini by any means.  \n\n&gt;It is rather a historically conditioned and geographically confined dimension, which represents only a part of mankind.\"  \n\nMight this idea be true for all areas?\n\n&gt;Though Jung concluded that there was no \"fix\" for this issue; that pursuing eastern spiritual practices would lead the westerner to mimetic madness.  \n\nJung was a product of his time, including some poltical  influences from attempting to not cross the Freud followers. Jung just didn't want to rock the boat TOO much. Exploring Eastern philosophical systems will not make you mad nor crazy. It may make you less of a materialist, but it won't remove the stripes off the tiger.  Did Jung mean a different context?  \n\nIt's my observation so far that he had a decent taste of Kundalini, but just a taste, not a whole meal.   \n\nIn order to better answer you request for guidance... a few questions first, please:  \n   \n1.  How old are you? (Nearest 5 is close enough if you need some privacy.)  \n1.  *Male* or female?   \n1.  Are you still drinking to the point of getting drunk? (from your brief post history.) Any other intoxicants?  \n1.  How much yoga did you end up doing?  \n1.  Have you done any yoga other than Kundalini yoga since then?  What did you like best?  \n1.  What form(s) of meditation have you been doing and for how long.  \n1.  What books? (You said you read lots of Kundalini books). Which ones did you find better FOR YOU? Which ones stood out?  \n \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390279486", "subreddit": "kundalini", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Loving this series, Nilesy! I spent the last few days playing it pretty much non-stop while recovering from wisdom teeth surgery (yay, more dentist stuff), so here's some things I learned that might be useful:\n\n* you can send out cooked food that doesn't require any more prep (like the pizza or lasagne) by pressing the number key while you work on something else (e.g. prepping a burger), this becomes quite crucial later\n* equipment wise it's worth upgrading the trash and the dishes pretty early on, it will make these chores much easier and faster. The rat and toilet upgrade are useful as well but these chores are easy enough, so you can save them until you have money left\n* you'll get more prep stations later, so it is worth investing in the patience upgrades (air con and fun menus) once you hit 1 star, it will make the rush hours a lot easier to handle\n* don't worry too much about the buzz, better fill up your menu with 5 dishes, especially ones that get ordered earlier in the morning or later at night, to make more money\n* always check out the cooking robot bets (in the mail client) before starting a new day, they are quite easy sometimes and you can make a nice amount of extra money from them\n* the daily special upgrade is very useful to have as soon as it's available. It increases buzz if you swap the dish daily and you make more sales on a big money maker food that is easy to prepare (like lobster or fish)\n\nFoods:\n\n* the fish as it is super easy to prepare: it's left, down, right, s, enter and you can press the arrow keys at the same time, so it can be done very quickly. One of the upgrade only adds a lemon, so you have to press an additional L every now and then\n* the chicken breast (t t t t t t s enter), upgrades for it just increase the price, prep stays the same\n* the steak is easy enough as well and can be upgraded to high prices, it gets a bit more complicated then but still doable\n* get the Lobster as soon as you can, it's very easy to prepare and a big money maker (L, Enter to boil, then different sauces in the prep stage)\n* icecream is good for the bonuses and it's a staple food - consider getting it as well for the afternoon (and you'll need it for catering anyway)\n* upgrade the fried chicken and the beer to the next level, prep stays the same and you make more money\n* upgrade the burger, so you make more money from it. Also upgrade the salad, it just adds additional dressings and increases the price, the other stuff stays the same\n* don't bother with pasta or soup, they are too difficult to make. That also applies to pizza and nachos, to some degree. \n* careful with the lasagne upgrade, it will add recipes that require new layers that need more focus than the p s c r combo. Easy to mess up then\n* the wine can make you a nice amount of money, but it's expensive and takes ages to get an order out (you have to tap the up-arrow like a madman). Once upgraded it's a nice money maker though. It's good to have on the menu with foods that can be sent out directly after preparing (fish, steak, chicken breast, etc.) as you can do that while opening the wine\n* I didn't really bother too much with the breakfast foods, some people say they are good for early morning buzz but generally I don't think they are worth it. The pancakes might be worth having as they also get ordered late at night, but generally I'd stick with the food mentioned above. \n* I pretty much went up to four stars with beer, ice cream and salad on the menu daily and rotating steak, fish, chicken breast, fried chicken (up to 2 stars), burgers and lobsters. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390289004", "subreddit": "Nilesy", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Newport tower is thoroughly debunked as anything else than a 17th century windmill base. I'd never heard of the Narragansett Stone but even opening the link and glancing at the first picture it immediately sprang out to me as fake. The letters have the wrong dimensions for a runestone, they're actually in a mixture of the younger and the elder Futhark^1 and, most importantly, the arrangement of the letters is just wrong for a runestone. So even from that picture alone I can tell you it's very probably fake.\n\nReading the text I'm only more convinced. The fact alone that it is supported by Scott Wolter, who is a big proponent of the Kensington runestone speaks against the veracity of the find. The Kensington example is a runestone I am familiar with and there is no doubt that it is fake. When Templars are mentioned this should be another huge red flag. And the only actual archaeologist who has examined the stone is speaking against it.  \n\nNow let's look at the runic text itself: I'm being very open minded here and I had to break out books to look for non-standard rune forms to even arrive at this transliteration but this is what the text could be read at:\n\n    S H R O M C/Z || G F\n\nwith the *O* being from the elder Futhark, the rest from the younger and the *M* and *C/Z* from Danish variants.^2\n\nLet me reiterate at this point:the letter forms alone do not make sense! But let's look at the text itself: it doesn't make sense!\n\n*SH* is not a combination you will find in many runic inscriptions. At the beginning of the word it is only used once for *S* (*sálum*, Ög 39 †M) and four times for *Sig* (e.g. *Sigtryggr*, U592). So let's assume it means Sig here.\n\nSo now we have something like **SIGROMS GF*.\n \nIf we really wanted to stretch that^3 we could reconstruct something like **Sigraums gjöf*. This means  *Sigraum's present*, with Sigraum being a proper name. The only problem being of course that Sigraum, while sounding like one, isn't actually a Norse name. \n\nThe article mentions an interpretation as Skrauma, obviously interpreting ᚼ as *K* or *C*. I can't see that, though.\n\nThe text doesn't make much sense. While that's the case for many runic inscriptions, together with the other evidence I have presented this should make it pretty clear it's fake.\n\n--------------\n^(^1 i.e. in two alphabets from different time periods.)\n\n^(^2 cf.

{"body": "Personally, I wouldn't have come to Japan as a private ALT had I not gotten into JET, but that has more to do with my personal goals/interest in Japan (interested, but not married to it) than any sort of objective truth. Make sure you know what it costs: both the initial start-up, and how far your salary will go in the area you're living/working. Without good Japanese or useful local contacts, I don't recommend coming over and winging it like you seem to be thinking about.\n\nI don't know of any companies that are known as being terribly supportive; the main difference between JET and private is that the BoE has fronted a bunch of money to get you over to Japan, so you represent an investment and it's in their best interest to treat you well and make sure you're doing OK. CLAIR is also very concerned about the viability of the JET Program, and wants to make sure BoE's are happy with them. \n\nIn the case of the private companies, they have very little incentive invest the resources in all of that, since you represent very little investment, and can be replaced without too much trouble (whereas on JET, they typically need to fly another person over from the list of alternates, or subcontract the position out to a private until the next round of applicants arrives in Japan). Your typical \"If A x B x C is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one\" logic. That's not to say there aren't good companies or bad BoE's to work for on JET, but it's generally the way things are.\n\nJET's have access to a wealth of resources for getting acclimated to Japan (supervisors, prefectural advisors, other JET's in your area, a language programme from CLAIR, national hotlines for employment/mental health issues... it goes on). I don't think that the private companies offer nearly as much support, although there are some publicly available resources for foreigners (over the phone counseling, medical advice, local International Relations association, etc) you would be able to use. \n\nIf you're planning on staying in Japan longer-term and your situation at home isn't bad, you might consider taking another year off, getting volunteer/working with kids experience, studying up on Japanese some more, and reapplying.

{"body": "Let me try having a go at it. I'm newer to this so maybe my simpler way of thinking / understanding might help.\n\nThe key of a song is the note a song revolves around. It's where the song feels \"home\". They're generally Major or Minor.\n\nLet's consider the key of C major. You have the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B. Generally major keys have a happy fun ring/mood to them. Basically, you can try to hit those notes randomly but always put the accent on C and you should hear what I mean.\n\nThen try the same, but put the accent on A. Same notes. You should get something that's has a sadder mood. The reason is that A, the sixth note is the relative minor. It has the exact same notes, but the key is A minor.\n\nThis works for any key. For example, G major has the notes G A B C D E F#. Try the same (hitting those notes randomly) and focus on G. Then do the same and focus on E (sixth note, relative minor E key).\n\nA good example is [this silly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psazw6xsMFs). Igudesman starts singing Mozart's Turkish March in A minor, and Joo suggests they play it in A major (not exactly my point since they have different notes) but you should clearly hear the difference between a major and minor key.\n\nAnd now to your original question. A chord is generally made up from the root note, the third and its fifth. So, for C we have C E G. For Am we have A C E. That's two similar notes (C and E). Am7 adds the 7th note (relative to the root, which is A): G. So Am7 would be A C E G.\n\nSo, basically, the C chord is C E G\nAm7 is A C E G\n\nThey might seem very similar, but they're really not. It's hard for me to explain why this is true, but again, see the video I linked if you want to understand how much of a difference a single note makes (when they start playing B flat instead of B).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390387977", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I never adhered to that but I did start to regularly take those pre-packed AM/PM multivitamins. I know some people say its a crock but I definitely seemed to feel something even if it was placebo.\n\nAs for the actual meals I would do just different meats eggs and veggies. Whether it was a skirt steak salad or getting fajitas and only eating the meat and veggie my main thing was getting in the meat and veg. I know that may seem boring but you get creative in how you season, spice, etc its great. As you can see from the pictures I am of Indian descent but born and raised here in the states so giving up rice was hard but getting to crush as much curry, BBQ, and steaks was great for me. For the mornings to keep it simple I would just do a protein shake. Its amazing how many different ways you can make a Pshake and it taste really good.

This *IS* the definition of an MMO to them. They didn't get to play Ultima Online. They don't understand the idea of a game's mechanics and systems involving player interaction being the heart and soul of the game. The content is prepackaged dungeons and scripted encounters, and not interaction between players.\n\nAnd the developers listen, because that is what MMO players want. They demand this shit over and over and over, and they play apologist when they get it and it disappoints them and people abandon the game en masse for the next big thing.\n\nWhy is it so goddamn hard for developers to realize they are going backwards? WoW was a great game, but designing every game in the genre after it is just recreating the same thing over and over.\n\nPlayers want something new. We want experiences, and memories, and situations that are impossible to reproduce because they arose out of a set of circumstances that are impossible to replicate.\n\nGive us an online world designed with care and love, where systems are designed to be skill based and less level based. Give us the freedom to do what we want to do. Give us the ability to interact with other players in a way that means something, beyond putting up vendors to sell goods, or killing them and sending them to a respawn point that is predefined. Let us build with and for eachother. Let us build relationships, both positive and negative, with other players that isn't just a facile excuse to go dungeon crawling together. Let us murder and loot each other. Let us be human beings in a fantasy world where the only limitation is your imagination. \n\nThat's what TES was, and it is the opposite of what TESO is.

{"body": "Graduate Student in music here.  Many of these answers are correct but I'd like to contribute what has helped me in the past. \n\nE# and B# do exist, it's just that they only really become necessary in less commonly used keys.  \n\nWhen we write a scale, it helps to have each letter (A-G) represented so that we can see it as an alphabetical sequence.  This is easy with scales such as C and G major (spelled C D E F G A B C and G A B C D E F# G respectively.)\n\nHowever, if you play an F# major scale on the piano it will look like you are playing both an F and an F# in the same scale.  So, to maintain the \"diatonic\", or seven note spelling of the scale, we call the \"F\" an \"E#\" instead.\n\nTo put it slightly more visually:\n\nF# G# A# B C# D# F F#\nbecomes\nF# G# A# B C# D# E# F#\n\nIn the latter, all seven letters are used (albeit most have sharps) whereas the former is missing the letter \"E\", which can be a little headache-y to think around.\n\nHope that helps or at least clarifies!

The best thing to do right away on a new hunter is to learn how to kite well. This is going to mean that you'll want to start key binding. Me personally, I use A and D whilst holding down my right mouse button to strafe and rotate the camera. Depending on your style of movement your binds are gonna be a little different, but i started simple with 1-6. After you get movement and basic keybinding down start adding more binds in that are close to your reach, Like E F R Q Z X C. Practice with those like you did with the first set and then move on to SHIFT modifiers. So SHIFT+E SHIFT+R and SHIFT+Q etc. What I did a long time ago when I was learning to bind was hide the entire interface with Alt+Z i believe it is and just play like that. Playing like that helps to not look at your spells and to instead look at the other players and what they're doing. Ideally you want to play around them. If you see an important cast be able to interrupt it. Or not, depending. It takes a lot of practice for sure, It took me years after I first started playing in vanilla but when you get it all down hunters are tons of fun.

The damage from your W (Sleight of Fist) maxed is insane, especially on a 5 second CD. If you can combo your W and Q, you can shackle them during your jump.\n\nWhen using your ult, its best to stack them all 3 on top of the enemy. It does an insane amount of damage. Otherwise, leave 1 farther away to escape to before you start to initiate.\n\nThe bottle is all you should need for mana regen. If its empty, with no rune in sight, and you still need mana, throw down a remenant, use your BoT to teleport to base, fill it up, then jump back to the remenant.\n\nOtherwise, you can use your BoT to teleport to any lane/gank, and get kills all around the map.\n\n-----------------------\n\n[The reason you want to stack BFurys](http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1398624) is that:\n\n1. You aren't really a \"carry\", your 1 role should be farming safe lane. You're more of a ganker early game. Your spells powers hit very hard early game, and should be used accordingly. You wouldn't build a maelstrom on Puck or Queen of Pain, why should you on Ember? No matter what items you build early game, you hit like a truck. Even \"itemless\" (with a BoT and a bottle), you hit incredibly hard.\n\n2. After a while, your spells powers start to wear down. Aside from your Sleight of Fist (SoF), you really have no steroid skill, a CC that is horrid in team fights, and an escape with your ult. However, your W has the potential to do a ton of damage, even going into the late game. However, keep in mind that this skill doesn't buff up your right clicks, your rightclick damage buffs up your skill\n\n3. Since most of your damage late game comes from your SoF, this means you should build upon this. What does benefit this? Damage. Stacking damage. What doesn't? Attack speed.\n\nSo, what does this mean for Battlefury?\nLate game, teams want to group up (unless they're ratting). Teams will be grouping as 5 to defend their tier 3. If they're all clustered up, its quite easy to hit all of them with your SoF.\n\nFirst, lets assume you have a \"normal\" xin build at level 16, with drums, deso, and a maelstrom, against 5 heroes, with no creep wave. You do roughly 250-400 damage, depending on armor values of the enemy.\n\nGold Value: 4100 + 1775 + 2700 = 8575\n\nWith 2 BFurys, you can do between 800-1100, depending on range. If you're all clumped up to try and take a tower, or to fight, you're cleaving onto everyone with each attack. \n\nGold Value: 8700\n\nKeep in mind, this is without any creeps nearby. If the enemy is pushing, there is definately going to be a creepwave nearby. Also, remember that this skill can be used **every 6 seconds.**\n\n------------------------------\n\nAs for Flame Guard (E), you can pop it before a fight, and it'll help push the creeps down. It'll also give you a nice spell shield in case you get hit with a nuke.\n\n*Oh, but it gives you the same amount of damage as a radiance in a skill!*\n\nYeah, but do you REALLY want to be standing in the middle of a fight? Ember Spirit's Kit has high mobility, and with a moderate strength gain, he isn't one for sitting in the middle of the crowd. If you're chasing someone down early game, you'd rather have the huge radius of SoF for an instant 120+ damage nuke, compared to the burn, which can be lost by being hit by any decent stun. \n\nDid I forget that Flame Guard has a 35 second CD, and is over double the mana cost of SoF?\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nTL;DR:\n\nEmber Spirit is Mid\n\nSkills: Q W W Q W R W Q Q E E E Stats R\n\nItems: QB + Tangos -&gt; Bottle -&gt; Boots + OoV -&gt; BoT -&gt; BFury -&gt; BFury -&gt; Crystalys -&gt; Bfury -&gt; Daedalus\n\nStart ganking hardcore at level 8.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390511514", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's a ubiquitous recommendation, but Mark Levine's *Jazz Piano Book* is a very, very good all-around resource. People will have plenty of objections to the way it structures and explains things, and I do too, but it's one of the best places to start.\n\nIn the meantime, one of the best things you can do is practice seventh chords and their inversions, just to start getting those in your fingers and your brain/ears. Do you know your seventh chords yet? They're the basic vocabulary of jazz. Here's the most common ones (with scale degrees spelled out relative to the major scale):\n\nMajor seventh chord: 1 3 5 7\n\nDominant seventh chord: 1 3 5 b7\n\nMinor seventh chord: 1 b3 5 b7\n\nHalf-diminished seventh chord: 1 b3 b5 b7\n\nFully-diminished seventh chord: 1 b3 b5 bb7\n\nPick a key, like Bb, and go through each chord, building it on the root and then playing the inversions. So a Bb major seventh chord would be Bb D F A, and then D F A Bb, F A Bb D, A Bb D F. The dominant seventh chord is Bb D F Ab, etc etc.\n\nOnce you start getting comfortable with those, you should buy a Real Book (Hal Leonard, 6th Edition, Volume I, and make sure you get the treble clef edition for C instruments), and start flipping through and playing random charts. If you haven't seen a chart before, they just have melodies and chord symbols - to start out with, you can just play the melody in your right hand and play the chords in root position in your left hand. Once you can do that, try inverting the chords to minimize how much your left hand moves. For example, if a progression goes Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7, you can invert the G7 and play D F A C - D F G B - C E G B.\n\nThe book and/or your lessons will help you progress beyond that, but those are some baby steps to get started speaking the language of jazz piano.

The vision changes actually helped open up some ganking paths for him considering you can time trinkets and get ganks in.  He plays fairly similar to J4. \n\nTop lane vs the meta of super tanks he does actually really well.  I use to always pick him vs shen because it would be a free lane.  You can stop TPs with Q.  Poke with E.  Sustain through most of their damage.  Shyvana and nasus are the two toughest matchups but both can be won with good Es.  \n\nI always max R E W Q regardless of role.  \n\nMy pref build in jungle is Botrk if im getting fed, meaning 2-0/3-0/4-0 before 12 minutes.

{"body": "Yes you have it correct! I'll just expand to make sure it's clear for anyone else reading.\n\nSo let's think concert pitches. Concert Bb on trombone is a C on trumpet.

If you play those both at the same time, you'll find it's the same note (concert Bb) granted they're an octave apart.\n\nLet me format the slide-&gt;valve translations better.\n\nPositions-&gt;valves \n\n1-&gt;no valves \n\n2-&gt;2nd valve\n\n3-&gt;1st valve \n\n4-&gt;1+2nd valves\n\n5-&gt;2+3 valves\n\n6-&gt;1+3 valves\n\n7-&gt;1+2+3 valves\n\nSo now, this allows you to read both instruments in both clefs. \nLet's take a concert Bflat scale.\n\nOn trombone the notes are Bb C D Eb F G A Bb\n\nThat is slid as 1-6-4-3-1-4-2-1.\n\nOn trumpet the notes are C D E F G A B C\n\nthat is fingered as open, 1+3, 1+2, 1, open, 1+2, 2, open.\n\nNotice the patterns positions match their valve counterparts for each note, which are the same pitch, just represented differently for each instrument.\n\nSo since the pitches like up, you can read both clefs with both instruments.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390628787", "subreddit": "Trombone", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

The best thing you can do is keep going. keep trying. get an app on your iphone like fivetimer(i use it) and/or download prisma on your windows(or mac i believe) excellent timer apps that come with scramble sequences(make sure you understand basic notations(F U R L D as well as F' U' R' L' D') You may already be doing this :P It's great practice for knowing notations. \n\nAs you get better your look-ahead will get much better as well. pretty soon you can solve a cube in your brain, and it's all you'll do. Literally. haha XD Without even changing your method or cube, you can easily get your times down to 45 seconds with just practice/repetition because pretty soon it requires less...thought? It comes more naturally with every solve. \n\nI still have yet to change my method(from the beginners method, which is a 7-step process similar to yours :P) and im averaging 48 seconds right now and i could probably keep bringing it down with just practice. \n\nOne thing i wish i hadn't done, was buy a new cube when i wasn't fast. I got my zhanchi  a week or two into cubing. I've been cubing since october, and i have 20 cubes. XD 9 of which are 3x3. why? Idk. Don't do it. XD you can stick with rubiks cube easily. It will help you out in the long run too, because it helps you learn how to correctly solve the cube. going into the zhanchi (or other speedcubes too quickly) makes it so that you don't learn how to NOT cut corners. they promote cutting corners(being able to turn the side from at least a 45 degree angle..if that makes sense to you. il post a picture later :P) \n\nSign up for competitions in your area soon! I went to my first competition when i was at a minute average, adn i learned tips from people there, and it was overall a fun, great experience! hell, you might get last? But who gives a shit right? It's only cubing. XD \n\nyou are right with \"The rest just seems to be as fast as i can spin the cube\" That comes with practice, being faster at turning pieces, and again, look ahead, being able to predict what will happen when you move the cube a certain way, and being able to predict what will happen after you put one edge piece in it's slot, where the other pieces will be. May seem like a lot of work now, but it gets easier! \n\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY!\n\nhave fun bro/sis.\n\nHappy Cubing :) ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390631569", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*I am a bot. The following text was posted by someone who yearns for both the publicity of Battle.net and the karma from Reddit. Shameless.*\n&gt;\n&gt;**UnrealMagic / Forum member**\n&gt;\n&gt;In Diablo 2 the bosses were the main wain way to get legendaries and some people liked it and others didn't.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Since all monsters scale now with the level and tehnically Diablo should be the same as King Leoric why doesn't Blizzard add legendaries back to bosses?\n&gt;\n&gt;For this to be properly balanced the following must happen:\n&gt;\n&gt;- The time it takes to gets to the boss + the time needed to kill him should be the same for all bosses.\n&gt;\n&gt;- To prevent farming the same boss over and over each boss should have a item table associated with him like : Diablo drops Inna's Temperance at 100% chance. Leoric's chance for the same item is 25%, Azomdan never drops so you can farm him forever and you won't get it. The same will be for each item. If you want to get Full Immortal King Set fast for example you will have to farm 5 different bosses. I know this is WOW like but this is the main reason people love Dungeons in WOW and MMORPG's in general. Because at some point, after some time of farming you will get that drop.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Elites should give crafting materials that are needed to craft/re-roll + legendary plans that should NEVER drop from bosses.\n&gt;\n&gt;- White mobs should give more XP + common debris.\n&gt;\n&gt;- The difficulty selection adds MAGIC FIND. This is done so people want to farm higher difficulties. So each time they test if they can kill that boss on the next difficulty and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Bosses drop a Legendary on Normal at max one out of 10 runs on Torment 6 one every run. Torment 6 should only be done with UBER gear. Crushing Blow should have diminishing returns as the difficulty increases. For example at normal the min life of the monsters is 7%. It increases by 7 each difficulty thus T6 min life is 70%. Still a strong stat but not too strong.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This way the player has options what to do with his time when he enters the game:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Do I farm BOSS A B C D E? What legendary item do I need? From which boss do I get it? (Of course this should be public somewhere like the game guide).\n&gt;\n&gt;- Do I enchant my legendary? Then I have to farm elites. Or maybe I want to craft something. The best rolled crafted items should be on par with the best legendaries but under the best sets.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Do I farm xp for paragon so I can be stronger in the next battle, so I can increase difficulties.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The restriction part of the idea should have the following effect: People don't farm the same boss over and over and get bored.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That Loot table can be easily translated for everyone with a sign next to each bosses name or an icon that is also visible on the item. For example Leoric's head next to the name of the Legendary.\n&gt;\n&gt;Or each boss should have a TIER.\n&gt;\n&gt;The further you are from that TIER the lower the chance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For example:\n&gt;\n&gt;Leoric 1\n&gt;\n&gt;Araneae, the Shadow Weaver 2\n&gt;\n&gt;The Warden, Head Jailer of King Leoric 3\n&gt;\n&gt;The Butcher, Flesh Carver 4\n&gt;\n&gt;Maghda, Leader of the Coven 5\n&gt;\n&gt;Gavin the Thief 6\n&gt;\n&gt;Zoltun Kulle, Betrayer of the Horadrim 7\n&gt;\n&gt;Belial, Lord of Lies 8\n&gt;\n&gt;Ghom, Lord of Gluttony 9\n&gt;\n&gt;Siegebreaker Assault Beast 10\n&gt;\n&gt;Cydaea, Maiden of Lust 11\n&gt;\n&gt;Azmodan, Lord of Sin 12\n&gt;\n&gt;Iskatu 13\n&gt;\n&gt;Izual the Fallen 14\n&gt;\n&gt;Rakanoth, Lord of Despair 15\n&gt;\n&gt;Diablo, the Prime Evil 16\n&gt;\n&gt;Act 5 bosses Tier 17-20 (I hope there are 4 bosses :) ).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For example an item is Tier 2. To make it really simple Tier 2 Boss has 100% and each time you go up or down you lose 10% thus Gavin would have on a Tier 2 item (6-2)*10% = 40%. Of course Azmodan in this case would have 0% chance to drop and all bosses beyond that Tier. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The player would be able to say this. I want to farm that Tier 2 item but if that Tier 5 item drops it's ok.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This add diversity. This adds the reason to play all zones. Of course this has to be properly balanced so for example Immortal Kings set would have the following tiers for the ad-don:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Item 1 Tier 20\n&gt;\n&gt;- Item 2 Tier 16\n&gt;\n&gt;- Item 3 Tier 12\n&gt;\n&gt;- Item 4 Tier 8\n&gt;\n&gt;- Item 5 Tier 4\n&gt;\n&gt;- Item 6 Tier 1\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This of course can be done for elites and white mobs which should have the same droprate as on the PTR right now. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The player can say. I want to farm Fields Of Misery because that's where I get T1-T2 items.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Give players options for END GAME. Also allow sharing with friends.

{"body": "To clear something up, HSBC were fined for doing two things:\n\n1)  Having no system in place to prevent drug cartels laundering money.\n\n2)  Amending payments to Iran and Cuba (probably a few other places) so that they wouldn't be stopped.\n\nNow to explain these.\n\nIn (1), HSBC should have been following a bunch of rules called \"Know Your Customer\" rules, where you are supposed to ask relevant questions at all stages of the customer relationship.  By doing this, you build up a picture of who your customer is.\n\ne.g.  Whenever someone opens an account, you ask \"so why are you opening this account?\" and they say \"I just got a job and need somewhere to pay my wages\" or \"I just started a business and need somewhere to manage my revenues and costs\".  Now the bank should then ask \"Oh, a new job, who with?\" and then if your new job's payments don't come from the company you claim this should be a red flag.  Or they should ask \"Oh, a new business, what sort of business?  Where did you get the capital to start the business?  Who are the other owners?\"  If you can't answer these questions then again this is a red flag.\n\nThey should ask to know about large cash withdrawals for customers who don't have a history of regular large cash withdrawals.  (And in that case, they should know why you are regularly withdrawing large amounts of money).  It just sounds like the usual big bank poor training, but asking about large withdrawals is something they should be doing.\n\nIn (2), the issue is this.  If you a transferring money from HSBC New York to HSBC London and then to Banco Cuba, the transfer from HSBC New York to HSBC London may say \"$5,000 to Mr I A M A Cuban Honest (double barreled surname) for forwarding on to Cuba\" which the US banking network would flag as breaking US banking law (no $s to Cuba).  However, if HSBC changed the payment details to \"$5,000 to Mr I Honest for totally legitimate use in the UK\" then it wouldn't be flagged by the US banking network ($s to UK is ok).  Once it got to the UK and was converted to £s, it was then perfectly legal for the bank to pay £s to a Cuban living in Cuba (if we ignore the fact the money came from the US and was originally $s).\n\nIran is slightly different, but usually they would have been amending the payments of perfectly legal and legitimate people of Iranian descent (Iranian nationals who are not resident in Iran) living in the US, who were probably trying to send money home to family living in Iran.  However, they could have been sending money home for terrorism.  And HSBC had no way to tell the difference.\n\nThere are actually some legitimate issues for people of Iranian descent (Iranian nationals who are not resident in Iran) getting access to banking services in the UK due to this.  Basically the banks won't open an account for them at all, because of the extra work involved in making sure the banks don't accidentally let them send money home to terrorists.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1390647850", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 283, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think the fundamental issue with the ending is that despite whatever else you did, your final choice was one of three. Hell, it probably would have felt better if you only had access to 2/3 based on all of your previous actions.\n\nWhat the ME3 ending did was completely shatter the illusion of the game's choice system, regardless on which # playthrough you were on. Any ME player can tell you that on their second or third run through they noticed that different choices would sometimes result in the same exact dialog and rewards/repercussions. A hell of a lot better than a David Cage game but still.\n\nThe biggest insult is that no matter how immersed or complex you believed your character to be, the endings were color coded as the only noticeable difference.\n\nSo, yeah, on a conceptual level it makes sense that there are only so many ways to end the conflict you face at the end of the game, but the implementation and storytelling was easily the weakest part of the franchise. \n\nRemember that brother-in-law and his sister-in-law arguing on the Citadel in ME1? They were arguing about gene therapy for the baby. I made the choice to not have any time for them and did not encourage them to do or not do the treatment. I felt the immediate consequence of my choice despite how tiny of an interaction it was and how quickly I brushed it off by not getting involved. In ME2 I saw them arguing again and was curious to see what was going on. I looked it up on the wiki, too, and it was very clear that despite whatever interaction. But in the process of it all it felt like I had made an impact. I had to shatter the illusion for myself, the game did not do it for me. On a conceptual level a couple arguing on the street probably would not give a thought to what a random passerby suggested they should do. On a conceptual level they would have made their own decisions regardless of your input. But I still experienced that I made an impact.\n\nThe ME3 ending does not afford you that. Unlike the three choices I had about the baby, each choice resulted in nearly identical endings. The worst part is that if someone were to look up the different consequences of any other choice in the game, they could see a difference. If you play through all three titles only once without ever looking up anything until the end to see what the fate of the galaxy would have been if you chose differently, you will immediately see that ultimately nothing else mattered but that final choice.

It also makes me super nostalgic because I used to watch it in mexico ALL the time when I would go visit. In fact the first time I heard it in english it weirded me out hard core. It reminds me of summers in Mexico laying around with piles and piles of family eating mexican snacks and watching tv and absolutely no worries at all. \n\ni would like ivy or spirited seas.

For example, if it starts with 'r', the letter looks a bit like a loopy 'y', but if 'r' comes after another consonant, the left bit falls off and it hooks on like a little tail like a backwards 's'.  Almost all the letters can do that, but they're almost all different depending on the combinations.  Then you can hook multiple letters on in a row with a whole mess of vowel rules until you get a combination that doesn't work and start a new block.  That's a tiny example haha.  \n\nIt started really simple.

So the most general way will be via a method like the above for loop to generate a logical mask, c, as in above and then call data(c). But if data is very big (say 7e7 x 1) and length(A) = 1e4, this does go very slow.\n\nTo constrain further, we know size(A) = size(B) by design (after all we are looking for sets of data between various sets of boundaries) and A(i) &lt; B(i).\n\nbsxfun was also one of the first tricks I tried as well.

Alright:\n\n**-Floral &amp; Woody-**:\n\n* [Mon Boudoir by Vivienne Westwood:](http://imgur.com/faLWJT3.jpg) It smells like rose, amber and sandalwood, pretty warm if I must say. It's really elegant, feminine and kind of strong (not aroma wise, it just gives that hint of being powerful), designed by a punk woman after all. It's delicious and pretty unique, it leaves a really comforting smell on your skin. \n* [Omnia Crystalline by Bvlgari:](http://imgur.com/6F6f8A4.jpg) Femenine, sweet, powdery like it has an almost Asian hint to it because it smells so foreign. When it settles though, it has a kind of vanilla-like smell that feels almost creamy and that you can perceive. Delicious but not for everyone. \n* [Cashmere Mist Pearl Essence by DKNY](http://imgur.com/aX6oEus.jpg): Imagine how a rich, opulent lady would smell. That's how this perfume smells like, it really suits its name. It's floral mainly but you can definitely notice the sandalwood that lights the scent up. It's not everyone's cup of tea, more of a scent that grows on you. Beware, though: When it wears out, it leaves a soft almost powdery-like smell that will make you want to relax at home, just lovely. \n\n**-Fruity/Fresh and Powdery some-**\n\n* [Burberry Brit Sheer by Burberry:](http://imgur.com/IcIslhP.jpg) One of my favorite perfumes, I have bought it 3 times so far. It's fruity, fresh (like really, really fresh), the kind of perfume that makes you feel clean and ready for any occasion. Lychee, pineapple, maybe some apricot... Delicate and simple, perfect if I must say. After all, being British made, it really shows its quality and deliciousness through its notes.\n* [Bright Crystal by Versace:](http://imgur.com/eTikkdA.jpg) Another wonderful fragrance that, even though it's supposed to be floral, it's mostly fruity. It's fun, super chic, feminine and \"luminous\", the kind of perfume that can make you feel like you're glowing. It definitely smells of pomegranate and peony when it first comes out of the bottle but wears of little by little, just leaving a really neat scent behind.\n* [Feerie by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels:](http://imgur.com/rFcHikH.jpg) What can I say, it lives up to its name. You can feel like you're a magical, mysterious, beautiful creature or that you live in a forest full of those. It's a scent that you need to get used to and learn to love because it's unlike anything you've smelled before, almost out of this world. It's intense, powdery, fruity and definitely unique. Mischievous and playful but God, this fragrance will sweep you off your feet. On top of that, the cap of the bottle works as a jewelry holder. A M A Z I N G.

{"body": "I really don't like this build at all. I think 2 value points in shruiken is all that's necessary. The way the skill works is it does: \n\n**DAMAGE: 100 / 200 / 250 / 325**\n\nwhile the mana cost goes up for:\n\n**MANA: 90 115 135 155**\n\nIn other words, when you put your third point into shruiken, you pay 20 mana to only get an extra 50 damage. It's a bit more economical with the 4th point, 20 extra mana for 75 damage, so I can empathise with people that max it. But bounty, like Slark etc. often has mana issues, and I think only putting 2 levels into it is the way to go. \n\nYour build should always default to E W Q Q ?

{"body": "This is probably terrible advise because I'm not at all very good on the grand scale of things, but if you're like I was when I started and just want to play something you like then I suggest just powering through and trying some [Tabulature online](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/)\t if you dont feel like shelling out a lot of money at once. Of course you should compliment that with lessons, but those usually include lots of musical theory, basic practical info like finger placement and whatnot, scales and simple songs that arent that interesting (again all important, but not very gratifying in the beginning). Tabs are easy to understand on paper (or computer screen). Theres the six strings that go from the top of the tab sheet to the bottom, starting with the e at the bottom string of the guitar to the E at the top, then the number on the string on the tab is the number of the fret (the space in between the metal bars on the neck), which begin at one and go on down to the 20 somethings depending on your guitar. Easier said than done but if you choose something simple at first (dont go jumping into hendrix or flamenco) and sit there powering through it you might begin to figure it out. Also it is imperative that you learn the basic chords A B C D E F and G, which can also be found [online](http://www.all-guitar-chords.com/)\t . Youtube probably has some good advice as well. If you dont know what chords are then go learn that as well before you start. Ok I realize this is all rambling and maybe a bit much but Im just trying to remember how I started. It was mostly fumbling around online and many hours of frustration. If you want to learn from the very ground up with correct form and stuff then guitar lessons are your best bet, probably found at any music shops near you or in classifieds or online etc. If you want to just go it alone for cheap then start cruising around youtube and guitar sites like the ones above and be prepared for much frustration and annoyance. However I will say that theres no better feeling than finally getting a good handle on a song you like and being able to play it all the way through.

{"body": "Before Tear/Gate Nerf I thought it was really fun and kind of good. It was super versatile because you could max W for fast clearing and shredding towers for early fast pushing or Q for AOEing camps or poking. Jayce has always had really good damage and they never touched that since after the Tear/Gate he just fell out of favor.\n\nBut I do think it's pretty fun. I don't know if it would be good, just cause it seems noone really knows the best build for Jayce atm (some people go Tri, some Manamune, some Brut/LW) but I would go Lizard &gt; Trinity &gt; BT &gt; LW if I were to play him. Lizard is obvious for a first item. I like Trinity because you really wont stack Tear fast as a jungler IMO, but Trinity has a nice build path and can let you be versatile in building. BT is obvious damage as is LW. After that it would depend from game to game.\n\nFor skill order I dont know if I would max W or Q, I really think W would be better cause Lightning Field has really good damage, but that is the skill you usually max last. Q seems fine and is generally your power source. E would be bad because E is only one damage component and has a rather long CD. \n\nI would probably go W Q W E Q Q E Q E Q E W E W R W R R for skill order. 2 Points in W early for clearing, then shifting to Q for your main damage, Then maxing E for MS/CD on Gate and %HP, then W, and R last because it feels like it takes away from your power spikes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390789667", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I think it would also be helpful for me to see the plots you were kind enough to make without the annotations, so I can better grasp the structures you are trying to point out.\n\nHere it is, together with a cell-shaded version (because otherwise it's near impossible to see the double points at r = +/-sqrt(-5))\n \nhttp://imgur.com/hPCnuep\n\n&gt; So the graph is given over the complex plane, correct?\nYes.\nIf f(r) = (r^2 -1)^3 r^-5 = a, the brightness of the color depends on |f(r)|, and the tint on the argument of f(r). So positive reals are kind of between red and orange, negative reals are blue ; numbers of the form +yi (like +sqrt(-5)) are purple, and those of the form -yi are green\n\n&gt; I see why there are zeroes at -1,0,,+1 on the real line\n\nYes there are zeros at -1 and +1 (you can see the colors going black there),\nwhile there is a pole at 0 : f(0) is infinity (you can see the colors going white)\n\n&gt; By \"locations\" do you mean bands or (apparently disconnected) crescent-shaped regions?\n\nFor almost each value of a (so each colour / each combination of tint/brightness) there are 6 values of r that gives f(r) = a\nThe exceptions are when the derivative  df/dr(r) is 0 or infinity. That indicates double points. Just like how with polynomials, you have a double root at x when P(x) = P'(x) = 0. Here df/dr(r) = (6r(r²-1)² r^5 - 5r^4(r²-1)^3 )/r^10 = (r²-1)² r^4 (6r²-5(r²-1))/r^10 = (r²-1)² (r² +5) r^-6 . This tells us that the irregularities are at (r= -1,a= 0), (r= +1, a= 0),  (r = 0, a = infinity), the double points at (r= +/-sqrt(5), a = ...), and possibly at (r = infinity, a = infinity)\n\nYou can recognize multiplicities on the graph because near those r , each color near f(r) appears multiple times.  \nFor example, if you solve f(r) = 10^10, you will obtain 5 values of r very close to 0 on the order of 10^-50, and one value on the order of 10^10, which means close to infinity.\n\n&gt;  By \"how these locations are permuted when the color makes loops\" do you mean \"how (and the order in which) the colors change as we follow a circuit around one of these singular points\"?\n\nNo, it's the other way around, you change the color (we change a) and look at how each location moves ; rather than changing one location and looking at how the color change. It's important to have all 6 locations moving at once while only changing the color.\n\nFor example, if we do \"dark red -&gt; dark purple -&gt; dark blue -&gt; dark green -&gt; dark tellow -&gt; dark orange -&gt; dark red\",\nif we start from the location A, we end up at location B. If we start from B we end up at C, and so on.\n\n&gt;  but I don't understand the cycle notation being used for the permutations\n\nThe cycle notation (ABC) means (A -&gt; B, B-&gt; C, C -&gt; A).\nThere are 2 triple points with a= 0 so we get a product of two disjoint cycles (ABC)(DEF)\n\nLikewise, if you start at bright-red and rotate the tint, since there is a 5-uple point at (r=0, a=infinity), you will permute the 5 corresponding values of r that are near 0. By itself this isn't relevant to A,B,C,D,E,F since their a is not very large, but by fixing a path from dark-red to bright-red, you define a permutation on {A B C D E F} by making the color follow the path from dark-red to bright-red, then do a rotation around infinity, then follow the path back to dark-red.\n\nWe can also rotate a around +/-sqrt(-5) to get a transposition (it only switches two values of r) , which gives the other 2 generators.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390817714", "subreddit": "math", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The stun procs on his next auto attack and all autoattacks have a technical cast time.

Just by guessing, it's about a 0.3s 'cast time; to swing the weapon and stun them after pressing W.

If you can get 'behind' the enemy, you can stun and dash through them - giving you a double dash and maximum disengage (use enemy minions to dash through also, if possible).\n\nRenekton allows some good combos around his stun.

{"body": "I don't really like the way the other commenters are explaining so...\n\nBasically what I think you're asking is, what should you play overtop that chord progression, correct? Chord progression of G C Em D? \n\nWhen I play lead I try to create a melody to fit the progression, and then I'll work around that. But the absolute first thing I do, is I always start playing on the root of the key, which you've named as G. So I'll start on G, and then my brain works out what will sound good, and there ARE ways you can know what will sound good, not just the age-old answer of \"just play what sounds good\" because ya gotta know how to do that!! Hahaha, anyway-\n\nThe pentatonic scale is a really easy way to play a melody that sounds okay on the ears; because there will be no notes that rub up against each other, like F# and G(in the key of G). The pentatonic scale is a smaller version of a major scale, leaving out notes that are at a half-step interval. So G major scale- G A B C D E F# G. There are two notes(in every major scale) that are a half step interval away from the proceeding note, and that would be(in G major) C and F#. Pentatonic scale would be G A B D E G, you have your G major triad in there and everything, no sour notes. \n\nHowever, if you would like to add more flavor, you can CERTAINLY do different things. I'm gonna try to explain how you'd go about being careful when you use scales other than the pentatonic scale:\n\nFor the chord being played, the safe notes are the notes in the chord. So if a C chord is being played, C E G are the \"safe\" notes that sound good. You should USUALLY try to land on those notes on important parts of the beats, and then you can incorporate \"passing tones\" in the middle. So you could play C D E G on lead, over too the C major chord, and it would sound good, and you've got a non-chord tone in there. This applies to any chord in a progression\n\nFor the most part, especially at first, just stick with the major scale, I think as long as you're willing to try to understand, then it will come easy.

{"body": "At the minimum, you'd need to know about all of the players within the user's sight cone with some reasonable max distance. But players don't look in one direction for long, and querying the server takes more than 1/60th of a second, so just having the cone isn't practical, so really you need anything within a sphere of that max distance. This is likely to be less than the total number of players in the world, true. \n\nBut how do you find out which players are within this user's sight sphere? The naive approach would be to loop over every other player in the game and calculate the distance between them in 3d, and compare that to the sight sphere radius. If it's larger, don't include them in the data you send to the player. That means for every update you send to the user about the location of other players, you have to do 5000+ distance checks, and you have to do that for all your users, so that's 25,000,000 distance checks every update period.\n\nThere are better ways to calculate that, though. Instead of looping through all 5000, we could limit the number that we have to consider by dividing the world space into pieces. If we divide it into cubes that are r x r x r, where r is the sight sphere radius, then any player more than 2 cubes away we just won't consider. Cube coordinates are easy to find for a player, just take their x y z and % r. Each player data structure keeps track of which cube they're in, and if they move from one to another, they remove themselves from the player list of the old cube and add themselves to the new cube. So instead of looking at 5000 players, you might only have to look at 100, resulting in 10,000 actual distance checks. You could add the players within your cube without bothering to check their actual distances as well, but then you're not strictly talking about a sight sphere anymore. It's kinda similar though, so it's a trade off of sending a bit more data about players that are outside r vs the extra computation to remove them before sending them to the client. Quad/oct-trees are another way to divide spaces like this, and there are many more besides. Which one is appropriate depends on the situation.\n\nAdditionally, if you've already checked whether player A is close enough to player B, then you don't have to go back and check whether B is close enough to player A; you've already done that check, so if they're in range, add each to the other's next update. That means instead of doing n x n we have n x (n+1) / 2 to consider. If we continue with the 100 assumption from the cubes above, we now have 5,050 instead of 10,000.\n\nThis actually approaches a reasonable amount of data to transmit each update, but so far we've only considered players, and we've made a lot of assumptions about how they're positioned in the world. If everyone shares a single spawn point, then you're not going to have 100 in your cube; you're going to have 2,000, because dying is part of the fun in a game like this. But there's something else to consider: non-players. Things like cars driven by the AI have to be considered. Non-player characters. Trash cans. Bullets flying through the air. Each of these things has its own position data, it's own direction data. Assume that, for any given player, there are 2 AI characters and 3 cars in the city. Our 5050 number in the ideal situation is now back up to 180,300, which is worse than our original naive approach for just players. And that's not counting bullets!\n\nI'm rambling.

{"body": "I am a twenty-year old girl from the east coast and I always doubted church stuff from my pre-teen years, but I stopped and left early last year, a year after I came back from my first and only semester at byu (fall 2011). I can tell you right now that if you do not believe in the religion, you do not want to go to BYU.  Even though I wasn't really buying the religion stuff (although I tried), and I rarely went to a full church meeting during my time in Provo, I did respect my professors and felt that I did learn a lot (particularly in my philosophy of art, biology, and french classes). But eventually I just felt guilty.  I didn't belong there.  I had made some church-disproved choices that I hadn't spoken to a bishop about, and I knew it was wrong for me to keep going there since you have to sign the honor code.  The honor code is of course rigid, but dishonesty is something that I've detested my whole life and I knew I was being hypocritical by technically lying to get into BYU.  So I even went to the honor code office and told them all that I'd done, and they were appreciative and said I could continue going there if I read a few articles and came back to meet with them monthly for the following 3 months (but I just didn't go back the next semester). I'm getting sidetracked.  But, the reason I stuck it out so long was similar to yours; I really did not want to disappoint my parents and peers (although not nearly as intense as yours, since I'm assuming you're in a more highly concentrated LDS area than Maryland).  And it's so much harder being a guy because of the whole mission thing.  I totally get how scared you must be.  And honestly, your family might disappoint you and rescind some of their promises and shun you.  Maybe for a little while, maybe for a long time.  It will be hard.  But I 100% think it's worth it to leave and live YOUR life.  It was hard for me to allow myself to actually tell myself that it was ok, after being trained to think the Mormon way, and it still is hard sometimes, but you will be  m i s e r a b l e  if you live your life to satisfy others.  My mom was devastated, but not surprised.  It's not easy being around her, knowing I'm such a disappointment, but she isn't too harsh about it.  I'm pretty lucky.  Just know that if/when you make the decision you most certainly are not alone.  You're 17, and there are sooooooo many other people in this world and an infinite amount of positive and negative experiences possible.  I recently moved out of my house to a city where I didn't really know anyone, and it has been amazing being separated from my upbringing and getting to know myself and what actually brings me happiness.  So yeah, even if your family and friends are upset, if they really love you they will come around.  But more importantly, you will meet new people and learn new things about life that make it amazing, and not be inhibited by a false religion.  \nSorry this was so long, I just thought maybe it would be helpful since I'm somewhat on the other end of what you're describing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390866454", "subreddit": "exmormon", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Having raided in Vanilla, all the way through ICC nearly non-stop (short breaks here and there) then coming back a couple months ago. (Haven't done any heroic content in MoP and skipped all of cata)\n\nI can give you some of my experiences:\n\nGearing:\n\nIn Vanilla especially, gearing was a HUGE hurdle. I've heard people loudly complain because they didn't get their tier 4 piece in the ENTIRE 3 weeks they've been 90 and running LFR. To put that into perspective, I raided BWL for multiple years on my priest and never got my Transcendence bracers. Oh and the whole set was needed for the top bonus, they were at 3, 5 and 8 pieces of an 8 piece set. We were a Naxx guild and would still have people running weekly MC pugs trying to get gear they wanted/needed from there to fill out sets/etc (think of someone who is on Garrosh heroic having to still run LFR Mogushan Vaults for 1 piece.\n\n On top of this, the classes themselves were very different. This was before +heal was merged into +spellpower. So there were separate pieces for healers. This also meant that if you were a healer, you couldn't use that gear to go out and farm things (you could auto-attack and heal yourself, which took FOREVER to kill anything - as a pally or a priest). This wasn't as big of a deal though because - there was no dual-spec. You had one spec. If you wanted to change, you were paying 50g each time you wanted to swap specs. (Dual specs didn't hit until Wrath I believe - someone correct me if I'm wrong). That 50g added up, especially in a time where the 1000g to get your epic riding was considered a TON of gold. \n\nThere was no group or raid finder. You used trade chat/guild chat. This meant that before you could even get into raids, you needed to get gear from 5 and 10 mans (UBRS and LBRS were both 10 man dungeons). You would sit in trade chat and spam. Once you finally formed the group, either you were lucky and people (including a warlock) would be at the instance and could summon (no summoning stones) or you would all run there. Sometimes you would get there and someone would drop, then you would return to town and spam again for more people, hoping that more don't drop.\n\nIf you do finally get a group, you need to complete the instance. Some of them were long (BRD was a nightmare) or odd (Tribute runs were harder than they are now - you needed to bring stuff with you) or difficult (I remember MANY a group wiping in UBRS and breaking up without finishing (espeically after arguments over the Pristine Hide of the Beast)\n\nOnce you get your gear, you're ready for Molten Core right? Nope, you need fire resist gear. Hopefully you picked up a bit from what you ran to get geared, but likely you still need more. Head to the AH and buy yourself some Green fire resist pieces. Yes, they're expensive because everyone needs/wants them. OK now you got your FR you're ready for MC right? Good - find a guild to run it with. (or later on PUGs - another FUN story - trying to get 40 PUG people to do anything together was like herding cats, usually it was 20ish people from a good well-progressed guild that vastly outgeared the content carrying the rest of the raid)\n\nEver seen Garr? If not... look at this [Garr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqso6o92pmU) See how all those little adds around him are constantly shifting around? They all needed to be assigned to either a tank or warlock (for banish). The fun part here? There were no raid markers. The setup for this fight took longer than the fight itself. It consisted of the raid leader having to keep track of which is which and go \"ok tank 1 assist me, that's your target\", \"ok warlock 1 assist me, that's your target\". There was no focus either (I don't believe) so you couldn't just focus it and move on. Then, usually about halfway through this process, one of the tanks or warlocks would go \"I lost my target\" and the whole process would start over. There was also no way to see who was targeting something to do it that way. \n\nAfter every boss is a rune. These days, these runes just turn off when the boss dies. Back when MC was current, they didn't, you had to run to a small island to get water to douse them. The water was 1-use only. If you didn't  have 8, someone was running halfway through the instance. Once you got exalted you at least got an unlimited use version...\n\nHow about AQ? Remember all that fire resist gear you got? It's worthless. You now need nature resist, well some people do at least. The tanks and \"sponges\" namely rogues who were going to soak up poison damage. Everyone needed at least a little, but sponges/tanks needed a ton... Want to raid AQ40 as a rogue? You better have a NR set. Where does the best NR gear come from? It's crafted from materials that drop in raid. So most guilds were not posting this stuff, they were crafting it for their raiders.\n\nFinally, Naxx:\n\nPatchwerk was the fight that blocked SO many guilds. We spent a long time on him (weeks? months? felt like forever).\n\nLet me break down this fight. You need 4 tanks. 1 main tank and 3 \"hateful strike\" tanks. They all had to run in together, the hateful tanks had to get \"keyed\" meaning they needed to get hit with hateful strikes, before the DPS could move in. Pulled from WoWWiki about the original fight:\n\n&gt;**Hateful Strike**\nBase damage is 22100-29900 physical damage, thankfully this is mitigated through a high ac. The average hit is ~8000 on a BWL/AQ40 geared Warrior in defensive stance (there were no non-warrior tanks back then). This ability will hit the main tank if the HS tanks are not properly healed. The ability will hit the character with the highest health in melee range. Highest HP and threat factors into this, but the pattern is typically A B A B C A B A B C in a typical fight.\n\nMost DPS actually stepped into the slime which lowers your health a ton just to make sure this didn't hit them at all. \n\nFor the healers, you were assigned to either the main tank or a hateful tank. If you were on a hateful tank - you needed to cast a heal that hit for a specific amount (I want to say 800ish) on that tank (buffs could alter how much your heals hit for). You would downrank to that heal. You needed to be able to cast this heal for the entire fight (~5-7 min). This meant you needed to be able to use potions, demonic runes and anything else you could to keep your mana regenerated for the entire time. If you stopped casting this heal your raid generally wiped. (sometimes you got really lucky, but it was rare)\n\nThe fight was also a DPS race, he had a 7 minute enrage timer. You needed to beat that timer. This meant that while the DPS couldn't move in right away, they needed to max out DPS as much as possible. We wiped many times with perfect execution from tanks/healers and just not enough DPS.\n\nYou mention people \"just pressing fireball\" this was because abilities weren't like they are now. You didn't have multiple viable specs to choose from or unique options. You had a best rotation and a best spec. Want to DPS as a pally? good luck. Ret could auto-attack with seal of command up, and spend the rest of their GCDs refreshing buffs (oh and judgement as well). Rolled a druid? You're a healer. (barring a few rare exceptions). There were no alliance shaman or horde pallys, if you were alliance you didn't get bloodlust/heroism or any similar buff, you got paladins instead, this meant that if a fight was tuned to a specific amount of DPS (see patchwerk above) you needed more gear to get through it. \n\nIt's not that people were \"bad\" at playing the game as you put it, it's more that the game wasn't as friendly as it is now. The game wasn't made as user friendly back then, it didn't hold your hand through things. There weren't anywhere near the number of mods there are now, and they weren't anywhere near as advanced. We didn't have deadly boss mods to tell us when to move out of things or when a boss ability would come, we had to pay attention/listen on vent. We also didn't have the global resources like we do now. There wasn't a place like icyveins or askmrrobot where you could go for gear/spec advice and tips, or to learn your rotation. You had to browse the forums or figure it out for yourself. \n\nThere wasn't a \"normal\" or \"heroic\" mode, the boss was either hard or it wasn't. \n\n\nAnother specific example I thought I'd mention:\n\nArchimonde. This fight was a BEAR. Here's the thing. Every time someone dies, he gains an orb floating around him. This orb he can unleash whenever (random from raid POV) and did a ton of damage plus some ability BASED ON THE CLASS OF THE PERSON WHO DIED. This ability usually killed more people. Meaning more orbs, meaning more people dead, meaning more orbs, see where this is going?\n\nFind me a fight these days where you have to be perfect, not a single death from anything. Even a lot of the world first kills were \"half the raid is dead race to kill the boss\" this didn't happen on a fight like Archi, if half the raid is dead, the rest is following almost immediately. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390911900", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You need a key for it to make sense as it will relate to a major scale.  For example, in the Key of C means C major scale.  C major contains 7 notes which are all in the key.\n\nC major scale:\n\n    C D E F G A B\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nI've labelled numbers there.  ((If you dont know how to work out scales worth taking a look at the structure of the major scale in whole + half steps.))\n\nNow from this you can create chords, and come up with a set of chords that relate to that key.  You have 7 notes, so there are 7 starting points (C, D etc...).  I wont go into how, but from each note you end up with a chord, all in the key of C:\n\n    1 - C major\n    2 - D minor\n    3 - E minor\n    4 - F major\n    5 - G major\n    6 - A minor\n    7 - B minor flat 5\n\nSee how each not in the chord gets turned into a chord.  We've \"harmonised\" the major scale.  Why its major or minor is to do about the notes in the key + where you start from.\n\nSo a 1 4 5 progression means you take the chords from the corresponding numbers, i.e. a 1 4 5 in the key of C would be:\n\n    1 - C major\n    4 - F major\n    5 - G major\n\nWhich is quite simple, but what about other keys?  For example, what is a 1 4 5 in the key of G?\n\nWe can make the first example generic, so regardless of key the chords will always be:\n\n    1 - major\n    2 - minor\n    3 - minor\n    4 - major\n    5 - major\n    6 - minor\n    7 - minor flat 5\n\nSo we just need to fill in the notes, G major contains the notes:\n\n    G A B C D E F# \n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nSo a 1 4 5 will be\n\n    1 - G major\n    4 - C major\n    5 - D major\n\nTo write this a little more correctly roman numerals are used.  Major is in captials, i.e. I IV V is a 1 4 5 progression, and minor is in small case.  For example a 2 5 1 progression would be ii V I -- the ii is small because its a minor chord.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390937154", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The fact that Betazoids can vocalize implies a prior evolutionary need to oral speech, as opposed to telepathic communication. The rudiments of oral communication would likely be the same as human or Klingon: content is delivered via grammatical rules. We get a hint that this is the case in the episode Darmok. Tamarians communicate through idiomatic metaphor and their communication is seen as bizarre precisely because it is so *alien* to them, as opposed to the languages of the Enterprise crew.\n\nIf Betazoids relied solely upon telepathy, it is conceivable that communication would be the transfer of whole ideas from one mind to another without language. This may or may not be the case - discussions between Betazoids that we are privy to may have been *language-ized* for our benefit. Though Troi does call Riker her *imzadi* telepathically, implying telepathy mirrors actual oral language. \n\nWhat is fairly certain is that Betazoids, when speaking, do use language using innate cognitive structures much like humans do. This almost certainly has to be an ancient ability that predates the emergence of telepathic communication among Betazoids.\n\nWhat would the phonology of Betazoid language(s) be? There's little way of knowing. The Universal Translator does a phenomenal job at masking native languages. Nevertheless, there is a tantalizing clue via the appearance of Betazoid loanwords:\n\n* Imzadi \"beloved\" demonstrates a very \"English\" set of phonotactics. A VC-CV- beginning is hardly shocking. Betazoid apparently voices both [m] and [z] when together. More unusual would have been [ms]. What /mz/ implies is that Betazoid minds have a tendency to reduce and simplify sounds in order to facilitate communication. In short, they do not perfectly map sounds to their semantics in order to deliver content like androids, rather they lenite and \"cheat\" to express meaning like Humans. The sounds also imply that Betazoid language was much less like the harsh, guttural and glottal tongue of Klingon and closer to the sounds of English.\n\n* Lwaxana; Grax; Rixx: names with less \"English\" set of sounds. The /ks/ (represented by &lt;x&gt;) reinforces the idea that Betazoid harmonizes voice/voiclessness in consonantal pairs. \n\n* Original name of the Betazed cannot be recovered (from Human *beta* + *zeta*). \n\n* Females tend to have vowel-final first names (Lwaxana, Stadi, Kestra, Deanna - a human name, but Lwaxana must have approved), hinting at gendered naming norms. Men tend to have consonant-final names: Tam, Sabin, Reitan, Andrus, Amanin, Lon. Counter-examples Jarot (female) and Devonini (male) can be regarded as exceptions and not the rule.\n\n* El'nar, a lake. One of the few instances of orthographic marks, though little can be gleaned from this single example by itself.\n\n* Muktok, a flowering plant. Intervocalic consonant cluster /k't/ is the least \"English\" pair we have.\n\n* Utta-, first part in 'uttaberry,' a Betazoid fruit; Rixx, capital city. Second half of uttaberry is evidently English. Both of these examples tell us that the orthographic geminate is not real (pronounced with an alveolar tap for utta- and simply /ks/ for Rixx), which is misleading but shows us an advanced writing system.\n\n* Betazoid is grammatically flexible enough to tolerate English suffixing: Cata*ria*, Janar*an*, Utta*berry*.\n\n* Betazoid retroflex approximant rhotic is very unusual and *very* English-like.\n\nThe conclusion is the the phonemic system would have very closely mirrored English. The phonotactical system, the way the sounds are arranged, would not mirror English but would still be very easy for an English speaker to adapt to. The result is that a Betazoid language likely sounds like a cousin to English.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: For fun, what we can reconstruct of the Betazoid phonology. Vowels:\n\ni i: ɪ æ a a: ɑ ʌ o u u: ɛ \n\nWith o only in diphthong /oi/ \"Troi.\"\n\nConsonants:\n\ng l m n k t ɾ ɻ d z s ʒ w\n\nWhere ʒ only appears in /dʒ/ and ʃ only in /tʃ/ which suggests a very diminished role for the minimal pair; [h] is absent, even as /-^h /; non-sibilant fricatives like [θ] seem to be absent.\n\nWe can conclude that while the vocalic inventory seems to be close to English, the consonantal inventory is significantly smaller than English. This has more to do with the limited selection of Betazoid vocabulary than anything else.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390990378", "subreddit": "DaystromInstitute", "score": 49, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Disclaimer: I am no where near your level of play yet.\n\nThe two different ways to attack with hammer are the charge 3 superpound (standing still charge) and the infinite combo X X X R X, you can also lead with R if you want that little bit of gap closing. Don't use A. I don't mention the hammer spin because while it's fun I don't think it's worth it. The total raw % of a full iteration of the infinite combo according to stats taken from http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_3_Damage_Formula is 174% while a perfect spin (5 following spins followed by a super golf swing) is only 160%. I'd have to actually test it with a stopwatch but I'm fairly certain that R XXXX is faster than a spin including recovery time, even if it's slightly slower, it does more damage. Just for completeness the raw of a charge 3 superpound is 96% for both hits, obviously heavily backloaded.\n\n The charge 3 superpound is for more mobile monsters as you maintain very good mobility even holding the charge and both hits from the superpound are almost as fast as the first pound on X while being much more powerful. The infinite combo is for beating on monsters sitting who are disabled, down or otherwise standing there and eating hammer.\n\nA good way to use the hammer is sort of like GS charge sniping though probably much easier. When a monster is attacking something else, position yourself and charge so that if it turns around to face you, you release your swing during its rotation or movement so that the pound portion of the superpound smashes into the head. \n\nThis is not appropriate for every monster because some monsters have a tendency to step back as they turn around, pulling their face just out of range of your superpound, if you can position so that even after the step their head is in range then you can still make this work but this is even more difficult than above.\n\nI can't really give advice on Hallowed Jhen but it doesn't look like he moves around a lot so, infinite combo him to death?\n\nEdit: Also, dash juice which I'm sure you are very familiar with as a DS user is great for holding charge on hammer for extended periods if you need it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390995566", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Studying mechanical engineer here.\nLet's start from the beginning using a high carbon steel as our example. \n\nAbove 731 deg C, steel is in a phase called Austenite. Austenite is not stable at room temperature meaning it cannot exist at this temperature. \nIf a blade above this temperature is very quickly (less than 10 seconds) quenched to room temperature, a phase called martensite forms. Quenching creates zones of high tension and compression, so martensite will crack at room temperature. So it needs to be reheated to around 400 deg C and then allowed to cool in room temperature. \n\nDifferent combinations of quenching to a certain temperature and holding at that temperature and allowing to cool at different rates will yield different phases and microconstituents. \nTempering these will yield steel of the same exact chemical compositions, but different mechanical properties. For example, ductility. \n\nTempering any final phase or microconstituent at a very high temperature will yield spheroidite. In spheroidite, the grains are allowed to form spheres shaped grain. This will create a very ductile metal. \nNot exactly ideal for a blade. \n\nSo a tempered martensite is best for a blade because it is very hard and has great edge retention. \nThis is because the carbon in the steel snaps together during the quench. The trade off with doing this is you get a brittle steel. So it will only bend a little bit before breaking. \n\nSo to conclude, tempering creates different  carbon configurations which affect properties of hardness and ductility.\n\nSince I'm already here, I'll talk about different types of steel for blades. \n\nHigh carbon steel contains 0.8% and up to around 1.3%. HC (high carbon) steel makes for a really hard steel, but it is susceptible to rusting. To fix this, chromium is added to steel. When the composition becomes equal to or more than 11%, you get stainless steel. \nThe reason this makes for a rust-proof steel is because of what is called the tenacious chromium oxide layer. Chromium oxide forms on the outside of the blade which prevents the formation of ferret oxide (Fe2O3). There are many different types of stainless steels such as PH (precipitation hardened), austenitic (bad for blades), martensitic, and ferritic. \n\nIf you look at chemical compositions of stainless, you'll sometimes see molybdenum and vanadium as well. They both work effectively as chromium but also add hardness to the steel.\n\nIf you want to see the affect of quenching and tempering different steels, have a look at a T T T (time temperature transformation) diagram.\n\nI hope that all helps! PM me with any further questions. I've become a bit of a blade fanatic and can answer a lot of questions you may have.

{"body": "Wtf everyone, reverb? Yes reverb will make your pianos sound bigger, but using too much reverb can sound incredibly cheesy, especially if this is a virtual piano that is trying to emulate a real piano sound. While reverb can work for buildups and intros, using it right after a drop in EDM will kind of \"slow down\" the drop and drag it along.\n\nHow I would go about this:\n\n* Take a look at the chords. If you're just playing triads, play the triad at the bottom, layer the first/5th/8th uptop, so:\nC E G C G C \n^ that'll make your chords sound really \"full\", play around with formulas and add extra notes in to give more of a feel to each chord, for example, maybe throw a D in up top.\n\n* Layer your piano with a synth / other piano that plays an octave higher or lower. Bus the two pianos to the same reverb, but make the layered synth / piano have a lot more reverb, but make sure this reverb &amp; piano sit at a much lower volume. This really depends on the chords/speed but I really like the sound of this, sometimes. Cut out the lows/mids in the EQ if they're clashing too much.\n\n* Bump the volume up a bit on the piano &amp; compress. If you can hear the bass and drums so prominently they might be too loud. Listen to tracks you're a fan of and notice how the mix sits, sometimes high hats, cymbals, shakers, etc..  are a lot lower than you think, and these types of instruments are really good at blocking out lead instruments. After compressing the piano, side chain it to the kick. This way the piano will sit nicely on top of your percussion and glue to it, instead of just increasing the volume on it and overshadowing it.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391038132", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's a guitar fretboard. You look at the chart the same way you see the guitar neck when you're playing it, unless you play left handed. If you are, I can make a few inverted ones for left handed players. The notes you see between the frets are the notes for the fret to the right (for right handed players). The ones on the very far left are the notes of the open strings, when you're not pressing down any frets.\n\nI named each chart based on the chord or group of notes it represents. The easiest one for noobs is the C major scale, A minor scale, C major chord, A minor Chord, and C major/A minor pentatonic charts. They're all in the key of C and it's what beginner students typically start on for playing to basic backing tracks.\n\nReally you can start anywhere though, it's not rocket science, it's just different patterns of notes for creating different sounds. The important part is to just know what key or what chord the notes you're playing belong to, so you know what key/chords you can play to with those note patterns you're using.\n\nIf you want to play a C major chord, just finger the notes of C E G. Guitars are structured weird, in a good way, so a C major barre chord would actually be C G C E G C starting on the 8th fret of the 6th (thickest) string.\n\nDepending on the shape of the chord and the lowest note, the notes will either be in order or out of order. That's what gives you different voicings/inversions.\n\nThe second album I posted is for different tunings, so make sure you're in the right tuning for those. Other than that, my first album shows note patterns for the same tuning, E standard ( E A D G B E). They're all basically different chords and scales you'd find in C major, and then a few others that go a little outside the key or are just in their own world, like those augmented, diminished, and exotic ones I posted.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391112679", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They have their own language, complex hunting methods, they go so far as to name themselves.

Because I'm human and because I've only ever been human, the only way I can approach an encounter with that dolphin, an AI, or those little grey fellows with the anal probes is to be as courteous and compassionate a human as I know how to be and trust that their development has followed similarly enough to mine that these things are present in some form in their mind. \n\nYes I'm anthropomorphising it.
