{"body": "Matthew Smith looked intently at the man who was half buried in an eviscerated panel on the outer wall of the structure.\n\n\"What've you got there Jimmy?\" \n\n\"Almost there, battery tapped in, just tracing the control lines to clip onto aaaannnnddd.... OPEN!\"\n\nMatthew looked up expectantly at the door. It didn't open. \n\n\"It didn't work.\"\n\n\"Huh... Well let me try this one.\"\n\nThis time the door shuddered. Then with a creak and a groan of strained metal, the doors cracked open in the middle. They shuddered back a few inches, and then with the scream of rust-on-rust, slammed back into the recesses of the wall.\n\nMatthew was an archaeologist. And along with a few members of a specialist team, he was attempting to make his way into a structure that had been uncovered in a mine in southern USA. The tomb of the rocket-men as it was popularly called.\n\nAn artificial structure almost one thousand meters long, by seven hundred wide, it had been discovered month when a shaft collapse had necessitated a new borehole be dug. \n\nThe first thing seen when the door cracked open was a body lying on the floor. Well, more specifically, it was a skeleton, collapsing and settling in a cloud of crumbling bone-dust, having been disturbed from it's position of leaning on the doorway.\n\n\"Leena, document.\" Matthew commanded, almost necessarily as a wiry looking young woman with a camera dashed forwards. Videoing she took a few cautions steps around the bones. \n\n\"Very damaged. What remains: Possibly human? At least, very similar architecture. Not enough remaining to make a positive identification, movement will cause further disintegration.\"\n\n\"Take a sample, but we move on and in. \"\n\nLeena nodded, and using a few small tools, took a couple of scrapings and powder samples and placed them into some specimen jars. \n\nMichael flicked on his head torch, and being careful to step over what was left of the skeleton, proceeded to lead his team into the depths of the tomb.\n\nWhat was ahead of them, a short corridor, leading up to a junction. Almost eerie in it's silence, except from the shallow, excited breaths of five people and the ringing sounds of their footsteps on metal. \n\nThree ways to go, one with a staircase at the end of it, although it was difficult to make out the direction in which it went from where they were. Matthew peered down all of them, as did the rest of his team. \n\n\"Which way?\" Katy was the first one out with it. \n\nGesturing to the corridor of his choice, Jimmy stepped to the left hand tunnel. \"Well, if the imaging is correct, we came in on the left hand side of this thing. If they're like us, then I say we turn left, head for the front. At least, that's where I think this should take us.\" \n\n\"I disagree. Let's take those stairs and head for the top. That's where I'd put the control room.\" Katy responded, giving Jimmy *that* look. The one that Matthew knew was going to set both of them off and very shortly devolve into an argument. But before he could step in and head it off, Tom, the final member of their little troupe, started jabbering excitedly and demanding they all come and look at what he had found.\n\nUnnoticed by Matthew, Thomas had been scraping away at the grime on one of the walls, and had uncovered something.\n\n\"Holy hell. Please tell me I'm seeing this.\"\n\nKaty stepped forward and whispered almost reverentially \"That's English lettering - E A L I U R - not comlpete obviously - rest of the lettering is too faded to make out in this light. Dammit, if only I had more light.\"\n\nWhat happened next scared the whole team witless for just a second. Starting with a deep, clunk and a slowly rising hum, the light block directly above them burst into light, and with a series of clicks cascade out to ignited the rest of the lights in the immediate sector, until everything that was in the immediate vicinity was bathed in an even white light.\n\nKaty, looking all around herself, and with only a slight tremble in her voice began to talk rather rapidly, her impending conflict with Jimmy forgotten for the moment. \"Ooookay then. Spookiness. Grade A Capital S Spookiness. Is anyone else freaked out right now?\" \n\nTom ran his fingers over the lettering on the wall, before using a small brush to scrub away the rest of the grime. \"*Excalibur*\" he whispered softly. \"A name?\" he continued, his voice more confident. \"I think this is the name of this facility, whatever it is. \n\nLeena and Matthew looked at each other.\n\n\"Human. Definatley Human.\" came from Leena's mouth.\n\n\"Seems like it. English writing on the wall. Apparent response to voice commands. Upwards. We go up, let's reach the top of the structure and then head forwards.\"\n\nDecision made, the group gathered closer to themselves whatever tools they had and walked the chosen path.\n\n-------\n\nBeing that it's half one where I am, I will continue this in the morning.\n\n-------\n\nContinuing from here\n\n-------\n\nThe staircase took them up three floors before it became impassable. Some sort of damage had deformed the stairwell above them, making passing it impossible without the liberal application of acetylene torches and heavy lifting equipment. Now, they had a small cutting torch, but ultimately, the decision was made to attempt to find a way around the blockade.  Thomas, using a stick of chalk, made a marking on the wall to indicate the direction they were taking, and then sketched a map into a tablet computer he was carrying. His attention taken away, he didn't notice that the others had dropped behind, involved in their own discussion until he nearly stepped on another corpse. He whistled back for the others to come up.\n\nThis one, Matthew noted, was for a given value of such, more intact than the body down by the entrance. This one, instead of being just a skeleton, still had mummified flesh on it's bones. However, almost none of the bones were intact - some violent trauma had happened to the body - Leena crouched down next to the body and carefully started to examine it, talking more to her camera than the rest of them. \"Body. Male. Unknown time how long it's been here. Must be some sort of environmental factor to not show the same decay as the skeleton downstairs. Skull is caved in, all major limbs show multiple breaks, limbs heavily distorted. Cause of death is unknown, but I would hazard a guess it was the skull that did it. Certainly you would be unlikely to recover from that.\"\n\nPanning the camera up and side to side, Leena nodded when she found a bloodspatter on the wall. \"Bloodsplatter looks consistent with the skull wound - someone or something caused this man's head to collide violently with the wall. I wonder what happened here?\"\n\nThe whole team looked around as another hum started to rise in the vicinity of them. This time, they all jumped to the side when something appeared in the middle of them.\n\nA model of a room, with two people in it. Their images fuzzy and blurred. Then from apparently nowhere, voices started, and the image began to move. The two people seemed to be arguing about something.  \n\n\"... gotta fix... no, you .... I ... to... failing... I can fix... your permission.\" were the only words that could be made out before one of the figures dashed out of the room. A moment later, Tom gave a scream when a man appeared at the end of the corridor at a run. Again, fuzzy, blurred. He belted it down the corridor, past the team, and down the stairs they had just come up. Just before he disappeared out of sight, there was a pause, a flicker and suddenly he was running in the opposite direction, when something unseen flung the man from his feet. Head collided with the wall, precisely where the bloodstain was, and his now limp body was flung violently around the corridor for a few seconds more, before the hologram folded the body into the same positioning that the real body was in now. The last thing to be shown was a set of words in the middle of the corridor: \"Excalibur Internal Security recording terminated. Query answered.\"\n\nMatthew blinked a few times. \"Leena, please tell me you got that?\"\n\nThomas breathed a sigh. \"Full holographic technology, and what is at the least an incredibly intelligent voice recognition/command system. Imagine the applications! Imagine what could be done!\" Thomas grabbed Matthew by the front of his shirt. \"I have to have it!\"\n\nMatthew calmly pried Thomas's hands off of him. \"All in due time. Let's not get too excited here Thomas. First, let's get to the bridge.\" To the corridor at large, he spoke out. \"Excalibur. Indicate the shortest unobstructed route to your primary command center.\"\n\nThere was a minute pause, and then some words formed in the center of the room. \"Regret: Captain, Primary command systems unavailable. Significant damage to superstructure. Report: Secondary command systems, Engineering deck. Pathfind?\"\n\n\"Did this thing just call you Captain?\" Jimmy inquired of Matthew. Matthew made a gesture to silence him before speaking again. \n\n\"Excalibur, confirm. Pathfind to secondary command systems. \"\n\nA series of blue lights along one side of the wall lit up, starting at their position and leading back the way they came. \n\n-------\n\nPart three to come tomorrow.

You can take one point in E earlier if that's your preference, for the cliffwalking.\n\nWhy? Multiple reasons.\n\n-Dive costs no mana, Sun Ray costs a 100, in the early to midgame, Phoenix has a very limited mana pool as some of you here have pointed out, not enough to do one full combo of Dive - Spirits - Ray - Ult.\nYou also have to take into account that you might not start a clash with completely full mana, it's more likely that you're missing some.\nThis can lead to you having to fire your Ult prematurely, and dying as a result.\n\n-Dive deals a guaranteed 280 damage if you hit it, Ray is dodgeable and depending on situation might only deal 50 damage before they're out of range (or you get stunned). It has a HUGE AoE that means 280 damage times 4 or 5 enemy heroes, as well. On top of that, HP are low in the early to midgame, which further reduces Sun Ray's effectivity.\n\n-The HP cost of Ray is absolutely excessive in the early game as well, if you've been getting a few assists and took some jungle camps with spirits, you'll be getting your HoT around the point your Ray becomes maxed and useful.\n\n-The psychological aspect, both on your enemy and yourself. On your enemy, because they're more likely to retreat than fight if they see heavy stacked DoTs on them, and on you because you're not tempted to use Sunray in a bad position as much (which is most situations in smaller clashes)\n\n-If you level Dive on levels 10-14, you might as well level stats instead, at this stage in the game, it's almost a waste of skillpoints. Almost. By that time, HP are borderline too high.\n\n-And finally, Dive + Spirits alone stacks 580 magic damage on the enemy, more as you keep chasing and firing more spirits - engaging from a distance of 1400. If you can combo this together with someone else with mobility, this is a guaranteed kill in the midgame almost every time.\n\n\nTry it out first and build your opinion from there, I once too thought that maxing Dive would be useless.

{"body": "http://musictheory.net\n\nYou've got a lot of fun ahead of you! Layering notes, or building chords, has to do with the mathematical relationships between different tones. Fortunately, if you're not interested in the physics of sound, you don't have to worry about that at all.\n\nMost chords are built around what's called a \"triad\", which is the root note, a third, and a fifth. If you write out the notes in a scale (we'll use C Major, because it's easy) you'll find that you've usually got 8 of them. IN this case, it looks like this:\n\n  C D E F G A B C\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nLet's start with a C Major triad. Since we're building a C chord, we're going to call C our 'root note'. Now we have to find out what the third and the fifth are - the quickest way is to just skip every second note in your scale. So, **C** D **E** F **G**. There's our C Major, C-E-G!\n\nYou can do this with any note in your scale, and if you make sure to only use the notes within that scale you'll generally do well. For another example, if we wanted to make an F chord (still in C Major) we would use **F** G **A** B **C**, or F A C. Once again, we got here by starting with our intended Root Note and using the 'skip one' method.\n\nNow, if you build all your chords like this, you'll find that some of them sound big and happy and awesome. Others will sound sad and serious and sombre - this isn't too complicated. Look at the third, which for now is the middle note. In the C chord, that would be E. In the F chord example, that would be A. Because of the way the notes on of the scale are laid out, there will either be 3 or 4 \"steps\" on your piano roll between the Root and the Third. 3 steps forms a Minor chord, and 4 steps forms a Major. If you use the skip one method like I showed you, some of the chords in your scale will be minor and some will be major - for now, it's a good idea to stay within your scale and use the palette of chords it offers you, moving to a Major chord when you want something big and awesome to happen and a Minor chord when you want something serious or tense to occur.\n\nMost importantly, remember to have fun! All these rules are bendable and breakable, and there is SO MUCH MORE to chords than just basic triads. The only reason to practice all this bullshit is so that it becomes second nature and you can play with it and have a good time!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391370612", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The easy answer is that most people are partial to the aesthetics of having a metal phone. They believe it looks the best and is the highest quality material.\n\nThe more complicated answer stems from a few things. Most people have been socialized to associate plastic with cheapness. Is it disposable? Made of plastic. Is it cheap costing? Made of plastic. Companies know and utilize these mental associations to create a more appealing product to their consumers. It creates an easy way to claim that your product is superior. Theirs is plastic? Well ours is METAL!!!\n\nIf you look around you’ll see many examples of this: cars are poorly reviewed for having a plastic-y interior; all plastic appliances are deemed cheap feeling.\n\nIn reality though there are many different grades of plastic that all get erroneously lumped together, and the higher quality plastics usually have superior attributes than metal. Like you mentioned, metal is a good conductor of heat and so it get HOT rapidly. Plastic phones won’t conduct the heat into your hands as readily. Metal phones are rigid. Just like how an inflexible brick building falls in an earthquake, a rigid phone won’t take fall forces as well as a plastic one that will slightly flex and disperse the force over a greater distance; reducing chances of the dreaded cracked screen. An added detriment is that metal phones keep dings, while plastic usually rebounds into its original shape.\n\nIn the end, the deep seated root of what a person finds aesthetically pleasing is usually going to win out over all other reasons. People perceive objects first though sight and first impressions die hard.  \n\nWe have seen though that plastic can be well executed on the design end. The Moto X and Nexus 5 are good examples of that. Unfortunately they can also be done horribly which is what many end up associating plastic with. If I met the S4 design team I would be the first to ask them what the FUCK they were thinking with that back cover. (Cased mine up to remedy this). \n\nAnyway, I’m not trying to knock metal phones at all, just wanted to put a different spin on the answer to your question. Hell, if the htc M8 comes out in that stealth black I am jumping on that thing instantly. That thing is b e a u t i f u l. (Would love for it to come with that matte plastic that shipped on the Butterfly, that would be my perfect looking and feeling phone.)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391394697", "subreddit": "Android", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; The 51% figure in Premise 1 is a bit curious and, when I first saw it, I assumed it was a minor bias introduced by the fact that the “heads” side of the coin has more decoration than the “tails” side, making it heavier. But it turns out that this sort of imbalance has virtually no effect unless you spin the coin on its edge, in which case you’ll see a huge bias. The reason a typical coin toss is 51-49 and not 50-50 has nothing to do with the asymmetry of the coin and everything to do with the aggregate amount of time the coin spends in each state, as it flips through space.\n\n&gt; A good way of thinking about this is by looking at the ratio of odd numbers to even numbers when you start counting from 1.\n\n&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\n\n&gt; No matter how long you count, you’ll find that at any given point, one of two things will be true:\n\n&gt; You’ve touched more odd numbers than even numbers\nYou’ve touched an equal amount of odd numbers and even numbers\nWhat will never happen, is this:\n\n&gt; You’ve touched more even numbers than odd numbers.\nSimilarly, consider a coin, launched in the “heads” position, flipping heads over tails through the ether:\n\n&gt; H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H\n\n&gt; At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Heads state. In the aggregate, it’s slightly more likely that the coin shows Heads at a given point in time—including whatever time the coin is caught. And vice-versa if you start the coin-flip from the Tails position.\n\n[Source](http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/the-coin-flip-a-fundamentally-unfair-proposition/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391397541", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 43, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The charts are fine but pretty much all of the subjective commentary is just dumb and misleading.  \n\nHere's my take on five minutes of theory:\n\nThe circle of fifths is cool.  The more notes you have in common with a key the closer it is to you.  The key a fifth above you (or one to the right) is only one note different, the fourth of the key you are in is sharpened in the new scale (where it's a seventh) \n\nC D E **F** G A B C, \n\nto G A B C D E **F#**\n\nThat's why changing keys by a fifth is so easy, they are very closely related.\n\nOk, chord progressions.  I and V, these dudes are important.  We'll use C again:  \n\nI = C E G\n\nV = G B D or V7 = G B D F\n\n\nSo with just two chords we have 5/7 notes of the major scale if we make the V a V7th chord we'll have 6/7 notes with just these two chords.  AND look at this notes are lazy, they really like to resolve stepwise, aka to the dude next to them.  Going from V7 to I we have basically every note resolving stepwise, except G which stays the same: \n\nB=&gt;C \n\nD=&gt;E \n\nF=&gt;G\n\nG=G\n\nYou can do the same kinds of thinking about any other chord change or what you want your melody to do, do you want to strongly imply a key?  or do you want to maybe take some notes out and build a sort of ambiguity and sit on that for a while, do you want to have abrupt changes or a smooth change, the more notes something has in common the less jarring a change is generally.  \n\nHave a chord progression but it isn't quite where you want it, maybe change the I on the second bar to a closely related chord, well hey, how about a chord with two of the same notes.  So I becomes iii or vi, that's probably going to work pretty well.  \n\nThe rules of music theory don't come out of nowhere it's the same sorts of ideas popping up over and over again in different ways, ambiguity, change all that jazz.

The song \"hey joe\" by the jimi hendrix excperience is a good exmaple of this kind of bassline.\n\nThat era of rock also had a lot of guitar riffs doubled on bass.

{"body": "Hmm good answer. What I'm trying to do is create a simplified mechanic that can work for all kinds of actions. i figured magic was the most complicated portion of most RPGs so started with magic seemed logical.\n\nWhat I'm trying to achieve is a mechanical function that takes the input of the character's action, the character's proficiency, and the random result of the dice rolled (likely based off the proficiency). The trick here is that I prefer opposed rolls, meaning all that times 2. \n\n**M = P1(Action + Level + Dice) - P2(Action + Level + Dice)**\n\nI like opposed rolls because it gives both \"children\" the chance to win. P1 shoots P2, and P2 uses their bulletproof skin spell to counter. Highest roller wins. If P2 lost then maybe they didn't cast quickly enough, or perhaps the spell fumbled all together. The result of the function is nearly 100% narrative. Aside from some Hp calculations of course. (Using Hp isn't something I want to use but some kind of health monitoring system is needed, something like Fates stress intrigues me.)\n\nI like the way you described mechanics and I think this will be helpful in the future. But I also believe focusing on magic will help me. By focusing on things like \"casting time\", \"duration\", \"range\". If i made those into more general terms that are applicable to mundane actions, like aiming/focusing, ammo, and well range, I can define all actions using the same break down. Obviously those 3 aren't the only ones but the ones that are on the top of my head.\n\n**Example of use:** A caster charges a spell for 2 rounds before releasing a strong blast of energy. A ranger knocks their arrow and steadies their aim for 2 rounds, providing a more precise shot. A samurai focuses his stance for 2 rounds before attacking with lightning speed.\n\nThat was my example for casting time but I think the same thing could be done with all the factors. Range on melee weapons could determine attacking out of reach characters, using a penalty to do so. Using creativity and imagination is necessary to bring those gaps but if the gap is bridged it could lead to some interesting mechanics.\n\nIf we (because I need help) can determine the W X Y Z factors that apply to all actions then we can create the mechanical function that takes W X Y Z input plus the narrative factor N (the type of action, magic or otherwise) and produces a simple system for determining every action...ever.\n\n**M = P1( N + W + X + Y + Z) - (N + W + X + Y + Z) = Narrative Outcome + Damage**\n\nAm I crazy for wanting this?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391447396", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;So if you lived in Chicago you would see no point in rooting for your city?\n\nNo point whatsoever.\n\n&gt;Look it is different for everyone, I grew up watching the Bears and the Irish with my dad, and hearing about how great Chicago is. So I bonded with my dad rooting for the Bears and the Irish. That alone will always keep a place in my heart for those teams. I don't give a shit that Neal Anderson is no longer the running back for th Bears, I wasn't rooting for Neal Anderson I was rooting for the Chicago Bears.\n\nNostalgia/old times purposes are the only real reason I can see rooting for a team. Which basically just boils down to whatever team someone was rooting for at the time. But as I said, if you take a team of five, and replace each member, that's not really the same team anymore. Sure, it might have the same name, but it's not the same team.\n\nHere's a more drawn out example:\n\nYou have this team (each letter is a player): A B C D E F.\n\nOne guy is replaced: T B C D E F\n\nAnother guy: T U C D E F\n\nAnd another: T U V D E F\n\nAnd another: T U V W E F\n\nAnd another: T U V W X F\n\nand the last: T U V W X Y\n\nTeams A B C D E F and T U V W X Y are obviously not the same team. They have none of the same players, and if you stuck them side by side, you can see they aren't the same. They could even compete against each other. Even though it's the same \"team\".\n\nNow, coming into the game without any family or nostalgia attached, there's no \"real\" way of picking a team to support. Honestly, I'd go with which team seems to be doing the best. That's generally what I pick anyway. But as soon as the team switches out like that, it's no longer the team I picked. And unless I follow the sport religiously, there's no way of knowing when that happens.\n\n&gt;But what ever the reason they started, they get a bond with that team, not the players, not the coach but with the team.\n\nSo basically you arbitrarily bond to a name. Yea, see, at that point you aren't even caring about who is playing football. You literally don't care about the guys playing the game you are watching. You just care which team that's arbitrarily attached to your name wins. They could literally swap the names of the teams and you wouldn't care. At that point I don't even see why the game itself is worth watching, let alone siding with a team.\n\n&gt;You start to say we, instead of they. We need to win this week. Now rationale you get you aren't on the team but those are your boys, you are \"with them\"\n\nNo. You are with the name and the other fans. We've already determined that the actual players can just be any random assortment of players. And really, assorting yourselves by just choosing arbitrary names, or worse, just your location, is completely pointless. Might as well just label each team with an MBTI type and cheer for your type. Much more interesting. You get people who have similar personalities grouping up. I might actually be up for something like that. But really, you just have a bunch of people in a similar location, rooting for arbitrary players attached to their location name. That's just pure tribalism.\n\n&gt;It is about emotion, not logic. But if the emotion isn't there, you are never going to get it, and I feel for you. Because the wave of emotions that sports gives you is better than any movie or tv show\n\nI've yet to feel any powerful or strong emotion outside of a few select tv shows and movies which I like. I honestly relate to those fictional characters more than I relate to anyone I've ever met in my entire life.\n\nBut I don't go around rooting for a tv show or movie to top charts or get the most sales.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391456427", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think you're on the right track having everything, even tasks and inanimate objects, behave the same way. I really like consistency in games, for multiple reasons. One thing to keep in mind in this instance, though, is that you are doubling up on luck by having two die rolls, one for each side. \n\n([random #] + constant) - ([random #]+constant) \n\nis not really different than \n\n[random #] + constant 1 - constant 2. \n\nThat's to say, having the mountain make it's own roll is not really adding anything except a larger spread of luck, which can be achieved more controllable ways.\n\nI'm generally more a fan of skill being represented by constants rather than a larger spread of possible outcomes. For example, to me, it makes much more sense that a normal person can be expected to have an outcome of value between 1-3 whereas an artisan can expect to have between 6-8, rather than a normal person expecting a value of 1-6 and an artisan expecting somewhere between 5-30. d/level is just too swingy to be believable for me.\n\nSimilarly, it doesn't make much sense to me to have a mountain of proficiency/difficulty 6d6. It could be 6 to climb, it could be 36, and that's just a huge spread. Some days the mountain is a sheer cliff and other days there is an elevator!\n\n&gt; Because it would be easiest to just collectively tell a story using a referee(GM). but I want the next closest thing to that using dice for a randomness factor. I suppose I don't need W X Y Z, but I was just spit balling out what I had in mind. So far I've been focused on a system that only uses levels of proficiency as the measurement. So just the N really.\n\nRight, all of those variables just result in a number added to the roll. So, there isn't actually a W X Y or Z in your model currently, it's just bonus+bonus+bonus+bonus as necessary. Everything is just a bonus to your roll, it doesn't matter where it's coming from. I'd have a table that says something like:\n\nMinor help, passing skill or knowledge, one appropriate time unit of prep = +1\nModerate help, moderately skilled or knowledgeable = +3 etc.\n\nAnd that just gets added to your roll. So long as you only have one format of output (aka their result), there is no fundamental difference between the inputs. That's all I'm trying to say.\n\nFunnily enough, this table would be almost the entirety of your rulebook, which is a very good thing to me :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391462204", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you are attempting to craft your own system you should study up on the games out there before you try to reinvent the wheel.\n\n&gt;If we (because I need help) can determine the W X Y Z factors that apply to all actions then we can create the mechanical function that takes W X Y Z input plus the narrative factor N (the type of action, magic or otherwise) and produces a simple system for determining every action...ever.\n\nYou know this is precisely what Fate Core does.

Passive opposition is a set number the roller needs to beat to succeed, active opposition must beat someone rolling 4dF + skill against them. \n\nAdd in the narrative flair of aspects, and varying outcomes of dice rolls (fail, tie, success, success with style), and Fate Core fulfills your requirements for the system you are trying to build.\n\nSo what are your intentions, are you unaware there are systems that are already published which do all the things you are trying to design on your own?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391475020", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, you see... this is one part where I don't totally agree with you : *only Curse breaking the Meta*. First of all, I don't want to discredit Curse for anything they do/don't, but I don't think that they've honestly broken anything in the first 4 weeks of their LCS performances (including promotion). Otherwise, I see a few teams that are doing as well as curse to alter what the meta is.\n\nThe reason why I'm so unconvinced is most probably my second disagreement : *the Meta*. I think that people are simply being extremely narrow-minded about the meta when they are watching LCS games. If you ask anyone in the stadium (apart from most pro players) what the current meta is, most people would answer you something like this :  \n- Tank/Fighter top (Fighter being damage+tankiness here).  \n- Tank/Bruiser Utility jungler (Bruiser being utility+tankiness here).  \n- Mage mid.  \n- ADC and 0 cs support bot.  \n\nTo really identify what the meta is, you have to revert back to its source. Meta basically means whatever you're expecting from the game while you're in queue. Anything that is obvious to you because you learned it but is in fact player-decided and not defined by the game. The most obvious ones includes lane setups (1-1-2) and role repartition, but it could be extended to buffs attribution, objectives prioritization (kills vs towers vs buffs vs dragons/barons vs inhibs), estimated game lengths... Basically, everyone has its own meta coming into each game. The player base simply calls *the Meta* the common denominator of those metas. (btw, I'll keep using Meta for the global one and meta for personal ones, just for the sake of clarity).\n\n**This** is where the true problem arises. People that search for the meta are often players that are - or rather feels - capped in their ability to perform. If you cannot get better, then you can simply outsmart the opponent by knowing what he's knowing better than him. The problem is that once you've studied the Meta a bit, you won't end up with a carbon copy... Some things you won't grasp, maybe some things you'll understand better than the mass. In the end, you'll develop your own meta, slightly skewed toward a different direction, and slightly tilting the balance of the Meta. But since chances are that since you've looked up the Meta, you've performed much better, you'll know that your meta is better than the Meta. This makes your opinion of whatever the Meta is now biased. And because of that bias, you can't properly evaluate the Meta anymore.\n\nIn my mind, the Meta was changed a small bit in S3 (or rather redefined more clearly), and S4 has brought out a massive storm in that meta. This is my meta :\n\n- Top lane : You want global pressure, and a way to deal with tanky champions with free sustain. The latter part is quite simple. Top lane is plagued with those, mainly because LCS are spamming them for the former reason. The other is dead simple... **D R A G O N**. All the casters are saying it every days, ganking top between 5 and 55 minutes means a free dragon for the enemy team. So basically, your job as a top laner is super simple... get ganked, and survive, then repeat those 2 steps endlessly.\n\n- Bot lane : Strong lane presence, which gives you safe sustained dps and support from mid game on. You will need sustained dps eventually, so putting it here is the easiest. Otherwise, you will also need a support, but I'm a lot more lax on support definition. For me, a support is pretty much only someone that makes the laning easier and still helps once laning is over.\n\n- Mid lane : Mage with whatever is still needed between burst, long ranged poke, wave clear, cc, mobility, dragon control, peel, etc. Basically, the mid laner will most probably be a mage because your 2 other sources of dps (top and \"adc\") are physical.\n\n- Jungle : This one, Jatt made me reconsider a bit... First of all, I'm clearly not a great jungler, and next, I've seen a ton of shit work... I'd simply say that Jungler is a Catalyst. Whatever your team is good at should be reflected in your jungler.\n\nIf we take a few picks that I wouldn't be surprised to see appear, but doesn't really fit the meta : Twisted Fate top (although I'm still struggling to find an actual build that would make sense vs, for instance, Renekton), Ryze-Soraka bot, Poppy (if I had to really bet on it, I'd say jungle Poppy... from Jankos, Impaler, Dominate or Diamond), Cait/Lucian/Graves mid.\n\nBasically, I think that the meta is a ton more lax now than ever before (arguably less than S1, but it's simply that in S1 everyone was bad).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391524445", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "All right, you seem to be playing jazz.  So don't be confused, because modes mean two different things in jazz.\n\nThe normal definition of \"mode\" is just a scale that shares the same intervals as another scale but shifted.  Phrygian, for example, is the third mode of major, since it's the scale you get by starting on the third note of the major scale.  It's also the second mode of dorian, the seventh mode of lydian, the sixth of mixolydian, the fifth of aeolian, and the fourth of locrian.  The phrygian scale is minor with a b2, so A phrygian would be A Bb C D E F G (A).\n\nThe jazz definition of \"mode\" is a *chord* you improvise over.  If you're in F major and come across an Am chord, you'd play the A phrygian mode.\n\nThe difference is that in the first definition, you're in A phrygian -- the tonic is A -- while in the second, you're in F major, and you just happen to be playing the A phrygian scale right now because you have an Am chord.

{"body": "Predictions for today: \n\n\n**[Rox.kis] vs. Next.kz**\n\n\n* Both teams are in a huge slump as of late. \n\n\n* Rox showing signs of rebandment, taking a game off VP. However in the game they lost, they fed a triple kill to a dual offlane Void early game, which is kinda iffy...\n\n\n* Next.kz on the other hand have hardly won any games at all, even dropping games to rather unknown teams like hehe united.\n\n\n* Next still do have the potential to play really well. However judging from their recent performance I don't see them wanting to step up their game anytime soon. \n\n\n**Rox.KIS vs. [Empire]**\n\n\n* Empire is on fire lately, beating many tier 1-2 teams like Fnatic, Liquid, Speed and Sigma.\n\n\n* Rox hasn't been performing well for quite a while now. \n\n\n* Empire seems to have Rox.Kis' number, beating them 5 games in a row in their past encounters. \n\n\n* Odds are ridiculously good for Rox but I don't see them winning. Bet big on Empire or small on Rox just for the odds if you feel ambitious, otherwise just skip. \n\n\n**(Sigma.int) vs. Empire**\n\n\n* Based on recent performances, Empire is hot, Sigma is not. \n\n\n* In their previous matchup Sigma had the upper hand early on but was unable to capitalise on their advantage, leading to Empire winning in the end. \n\n\n* Nevertheless I still feel the odds for this matchup is about 50-50. Sigma can definitely beat Empire and this is a BO1 so anything can happen. Might bet on Sigma for slightly better value. \n\n\n**[Sigma.int] vs. Fnatic**\n\n\n* Sigma has been beating Fnatic in almost all of their previous matchups with their current roster, with Fnatic's only win on Sigma happening recently. \n\n\n* Fnatic is the favorite here most probably due to their recent wins against Na'Vi, Rox and also Sigma themselves. \n\n\n* Fnatic is highly aggresive in the early game, which might be hard to handle for Sigma as they are relatively weaker in the early game. \n\n\n* Still the matchup is about 50-50 in my opinion, as long as Sigma doesn't give Fnatic Wisp, Invoker, Enchantress etc. Bet's on Sigma due to better value. \n\n\n**[Liquid] vs. eHug**\n\n\n* Liquid has been performing decently, beating tier 2 teams while falling short to the tier 1-1.5 teams like Empire and Sadboys. \n\n\n* eHug has been dropping most of their recent games, losing to Speed, Sadboys and even Denial.\n\n\n* Liquid is by far the better team and should take this. But I'll skip due to crappy odds. Plus it's a BO1.\n\n\n**(eHug) vs. Swage**\n\n\n* Swage is a decent team, they did beat eHug 3-2 in their previous matchup so I'd rate them slightly higher. \n\n\n* That said, my personal odds are about 60-40 Swage. Betting on eHug as they could potentially upset Swage since this is a BO1. Pretty good odds as well. \n\n\n**[Denial] vs. Swage**\n\n\n* Denial has hardly been winning any games but their recent games were against Liquid, Sadboys and Revenge, which are tier 1.5-2 teams. \n\n\n* They did beat eHug recently though in a BO1. They also took a couple games off Swage in the past, their past encounters including a 1-2 loss and a 1-1 tie. \n\n\n* This is a BO1, Denial has a chance of upset and returns are really good for them. Betting small on Denial. \n\n\n**[S A D B O Y S] vs. PssT**\n\n\n* Judging from recent performances I'd say SADBOYS are tier 1.5 and the top NA team at the moment. \n\n\n* PssT on the other hand are rather unknown and haven't got any notable wins at all. \n\n\n* Should be a safe bet on Sadboys.

So if you're in C major and find a C major chord, it's actually C E G B D F A -- that is, the C major scale.  If you find a Dm chord, then it's actually going to be D F A C E G B, the D dorian scale.  If you think of all of those notes as chord tones, you'll have your goal.\n\nThe key, of course, is to know all those notes from looking at the chord.  If you see an F major chord, do you play F A C E G Bb D, the F major scale, or F A C E G B D, the F lydian scale?  If you're in C major, probably F lydian, but maybe F major is what's really meant because you're momentarily not in C major at all.  Maybe your CM7 is actually a CM7#11, which is C lydian.

{"body": "As a whole, Morgana is a super safe champion in the mid lane.  Her primary strength is her ability to farm from a distance, and keep encroaching jungles from getting to her with use of her Q. \n\nMy personal strategy on Morg (just early game because she changes entirely once you get your Zhonyas)do the following:\n\n1. Rush your early game Catalyst of the Protector and Seeker's Armguard (Total Gold is 2360 I believe).\n\n2. Try and stay in lane until level 6 where you can go back and buy Catalyst the Protector, 2 wards, and maybe boots (depending on how well you know how to farm you can usually have around 1800-2100 gold at the 7-8 minute mark).\n\n3. Once you return with Catalyst, you can push the lane as hard as you want and start to take your enemy wraiths, your wraiths, or your wolves when the lane is pushed.  This should accelerate both your levels and your income through the 6-8 levels.\n\n4. As far as roaming goes, it's situational.  You'll find that much of the time,you're pushed to your enemy tower.  If other lanes are pushed, it's usually an advisable strategy to take the back path (through enemy jungle) to gank other lanes.  You can either open up with your Q W E R, or just run in behind with an E R W Q (depending on positioning).  Then return to your lane.\n\n5. After a successful gank or wraith/wolves clear...ALWAYS return to your lane and push it again.  Morgana benefits more than almost any other champion from constantly pushing lane and gaining a level advantage on your enemy.  She is unique in that she is not a very mobile AP Caster, but requires a very aggressive (almost melee esque) play style in team fights.  If you're up on levels, it is much easier to survive that ult initiation long enough so your teammates can clean up.\n\n7.  Don't fret on your items that much.  Just focus on farm as much as you can.  You should be able to buy a rod of ages about 2-3 minutes after your first buy.  Do this as fast as possible and return to lane.  \n\n8. Usually my end build is something like: Rod of Ages, Zhonyas, Mpen boots, Rabbadons, Abyssal Scepter, Guardian Angel.  Perfect combo of magic penetration, damage, sustain, and tankiness.\n\n\nSome of the downfalls of playing Morgana is that you have to rely a bit on your teammates in the mid game to follow up on your plays, while also recognizing when to peel and when to initiate.  It's not a very glamorous 'carry' role, but she's definitely adept at making her mark.\n\n\nI hope that helps.  I'm not Diamond, but I'm fairly successful at an individual level with Morgana (Gold I S3, Plat II/III MMR).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391797483", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I'm not saying don't ever do them, because they can help with finger dexterity and control and so on, just don't substitute them for meaningful practice. \n\nI'd say if you want to do some technical practice, you can work on scales and finger dexterity in combination. For example for C major instead of just playing through the scale C D E F G A B C and so on up and down in the 7 positions across the neck, try going up the arpeggio and back down the scale, then starting at the next note. There are thousands of these scale patterns, and mixing them up will not only give you a stronger understanding of the shape and more importantly the SOUND of the scale, it'll improve your dexterity and control.\n\nAlso harmony and chord construction are something that a lot of guitar players eschew because they just want to shred or whatever. Invest some time in to understanding how chords are constructed, and applying this so you can free yourself from open and barre shapes. Guitar is a harmonic instrument after all, so why limit yourself. It's like a piano player only ever plays with one hand.\n\nThere are tons of books and youtube tutorials out there, so just think about what areas you'd like to improve on specifically and then just search for information on that and incorporate it in to your practice!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391829571", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I clearly am not living the 'American Dream' - will never own a house, will probably never retire, will never have my own family.  So \"being okay with myself\" is an imperative.  Taking care of yourself, r e a l l y taking care of yourself - sleep, food, exercise, self reflection and self expression - are the keys.  \n\nAt least I tell myself this.  I'll see how it goes when the economy tanks again and no one can afford a house cleaner.  Or I get cancer or too old to work.  \n\nGetting older is a trip, man.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391896432", "subreddit": "40something", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; This is dated hundreds of years after the supposed Jewish \"empire\" discussed in the bible, thus even if 100% of what you claim is true, has nothing to do with the fairy tales of Exodus, Kings David and Solomon, or the mythical Jewish empire discussed in the bible/old testament.\n\nI wasn't talking about that. I was talking about the historicity of the existence of a kingdom of Israel.\n\n&gt;This shows Jehu, son of Omri. The bible tells us that Jehu is the son of Jehoshaphat.(I know, wikipedia claims Omri means \"Israeli\" in Assyrian, but this is just the typical Judeo-Christian scholars changing the definition of words to fit their preconceived notions, there is no evidence this is true)\n\nEh, Omri doesn't mean Israeli in Akkadian. I think you're misunderstanding the Akkadian Bit-Humriya, which can mean either House of Omri (literally) but is used to mean \"Kingdom of Israel\". Basically calling the area after the ruling dynasty. This isn't an uncommon type of toponym in Akkadian. Bit Adana and Bit Gusi for example are found in Akkadian documents referring to Aramean polities in Mesopotamia.\n\n&gt; You are confused here. The Tel Dan Stele is claimed to state that Hazael killed Jehoram and Ahaziah, not Jehu.\n\nSorry, was typing in haste. Thank you for catching my error.\n\n&gt; Also, Jewish \"historians\" like to translate part of this fragment as \"House of David\", but that's merely because they use the bible and then work backward to \"prove\" biblical claims. Circular logic is very popular with religious nutters.\n\nCould you provide an alternate reading? BYTDWD can't be broken up in any way except for House of David. I will assume, you don't read Hebrew at this point. I already know you don't have any knowledge of Akkadian, nor Egyptian as I'll bring up in just a second.\n\n&gt; The hieroglyph is I.si.ri.ar, not \"Israel\".\n\nI... I dunno where you got that from. Your consonants are correct... But the vowels. See, Heiroglypic writing, like Paleo-Hebrew, Phoenician and Aramaic, didn't write vowels. The actual Heiroglyphics read Y S R I R. (Note on the I. That's more of an educated guess as to it being a proper I sound. Y is written as two Reads, and what we assume is I is written as a single reed. It's been argued that they are both Y, the double read being a more stressed Y.) Now, about the R there. The thing about Ancient Egyptian is it lacked a symbol for the L sound. This is similar to the situation with the Japanese Language. For example, other nations with an L in there name end up with an R, sea people known as the Philistines end up as PRST, \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391899906", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Fellow Scot here &lt;3...\n\n&gt; Will learning chords and scales make me learn guitar or just how to play scales and chords?\n\nTo a certain extent yes, chords and scales are pretty much the basis of all music. Developing theory knowledge is important to becoming a well rounded player, however do not neglect things like learning to play songs that you like. Learning chords/scales/theory improves your ability to understand music and your ability to improvise. Learning songs/solos helps you understand phrasing and melodic playing, and your knowledge of theory will tell you WHY particular songs sound good/happy/sad/dark... etc.\n\n&gt; Musical key I don't understand, can I only use the notes in the C scale for the key off C?\n\nIt is hard to tell if you will understand my answer to this question, but I will answer it anyway. The answer to this question is both yes and no. Theoretically, the notes of C Major are C D E F G A B. However there exists OTHER scales which technically are \"major\" scales but have slightly different sounds, but are not the same scale as a C Major scale, these are called modes. \n\nFor example, C Mixolydian mode, is a Major mode of C with a flattened 7th (B flat). I would go into this in more detail but it is (not trying to shit talk you here by the way) unlikely that you would understand it at this point. This is what I meant by \"yes and no\" C Major and C Mixolydian are both Major scales, but have different tonalities.\n\n&gt; How do you know what chords fit into the key? \n\nThis is related to the notes of a particular scale. The chords in any given key are derived from the notes in the scale of said key.\n\nFor example: C Major is C D E F G A B (C)\n\nChords are made up of the following \"degrees\" or \"steps\" of the scale, these are usually represented by Roman Numerals ( I II III IV V VI VII VIII). The degrees of a scale are measured in tones and semi tones, or half step and whole step. A semitone being C to C sharp, and a tone being C to D.\n\nThese are:   \n\nI -  Root (tonic note, or starting note), in this case C. \n\nII - Second degree of the scale, a tone above C = D.\n\nIII -Known as the \"third\", in the case of C Major our third is E, two tones above C.\n\nIV - The \"fourth\" (in this case a \"perfect fourth\") above the root = F\n\nV - The \"perfect fifth\" \n\nVI - The sixth\n\nVII - Seventh, or B. This is the last step before you are back at where you started at C (an \"octave\", same note but higher)\n\nChords are commonly made up using the third and fifth, occasionally the seventh, and sometimes other tones too. For the sake of ease we will consider the root, third and fifth. (There are probably better ways of explaining this with diagrams... but google is useful and you can find those no problem if you want to.)\n\nOur first chord in C Major would be C Major, obviously. Our chord tones here are C (root), E (Major 3rd), and G (5th). This is what we call a \"C Major Triad\" (triad because three notes).\n\nOur second chord by process of counting up the scale is D Minor. Count two steps up from D to get the 3rd (in this case Minor 3rd; F), and 4 steps up from D to get the fifth, which is A. D, F and A forms a D minor triad.\n\nOur third chord is E Minor, E, G B = E Minor triad.\n\nSo on and so on... I'm not going to explain all this stuff here, you can find this info. in plenty of places if you look around for it.\n\n&gt; Will I eventually learn to recognise notes by ear?\n\nYes, if you put the time into learning how to do it. I learned it from transcribing songs by ear, and constant analytical listening to music. I can pretty much hear a piece and see how it looks on the guitar and see it as written music in my head. This kind of thing just takes time to develop. It starts as \"trial and error\" in the beginning, playing notes to see if they match, and eventually develops into an instinct. I have got so good at it that I don't really even think about it anymore.\n\nThere are various ear training resources available online, and you can start to practice yourself by transcribing (working out by ear) instead of using Tab for songs. Tab is useful as a resource, but is also somewhat of a \"crutch\" for players who do not make the effort to learn about music. Tab also teaches you next to nothing about WHY the music is the way it is.\n\nI hope this was interesting, and if you have any other questions feel free to PM me on reddit, or drop me an email to davidbrownguitar@gmail.com.\n\nGonna take this chance to plug my [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/davidbrownguitar) channel, I upload lesson videos from time to time, and have a bunch of stuff planned soon. If you have any request for a particular lesson topic feel free to request it and I will see what I can do.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391909545", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

If you learn each scale, you'll notice that the same group of notes can be used for one minor and one major scale. For example, the notes in the C major scale and the A minor scale are the same (C D E F G A B C, all white keys); the notes in the D# major scale and the C minor scale are the same (D# F G G# A# C D D#).. etc.\n* With more experimentation, you will find other intervals to transition that sound good. The reason I suggest you start off with the 5th is that it's a \"perfect\" interval, and is considered to be \"perfectly\" consonant. This lets you layer a bassline on deck A with a melody on deck B that's a 5th off, and it'll still sound \"in tune\".\n\nI find that learning the theory is a better investment in the long run, because you're not a slave to a \"system\" that somebody came up with.

{"body": "This one is fucking beautiful, lol!\n\n&gt; Of course yew would take screenies of someone who disagrees w/ yew, what a trolish move, wanna talk educatin? Fine, the system in this countri suks and is flawed. Facilitators should work towards helping chil'ren lrn what they want to lrn to do what they want to do in their futur's not let the govmnt (skools r govmnt insititutions) tryn control them, as it's all about todai, CONTROL of the futur of the populace, to tryn get em to do wat they want, and not fight for their rights as their ancestors did that the govmnt tramples daili. Skool should be completely optional, not mandatory. IT's all about tryn to get chil'ren to be \"fucntioning membrs of society\" bucnha b s. They act as if lyf is, and try to shoehorn chil'ren's livs into this format, to follow a certain method, like everyone goes thru hi skool and graduates and joins \"the \"workforce\" or military\" and all jobs r suit-n-tie office ones, it's a buncha B S, there r other jobs (not all drugg-related mind yew) that are nothing of the sorts one can make a decent living and have fun doing what they want to do teechrs do not faciliate lrning about or encouraging in skools (most at least, todai). Nah, they just focus mroe on gettin tenagers to not slep w/ each other. There r polees here who haras innocents over \"suspicious activity\" B S (just goin for a walk at nyt, FOR MONEY, cause most polees r crookd) and despite the hi number of polees where ey liv currently, crime still happens near mnthly-basis. And there's NOTHING wrng w/ NOT jonin the military, the skool needs to stop bein so extra-humbl to membrs of it everydai, as most ey knew in r o t c were ay holls/bulees and ey still have no respec for and peopl just wanna bend over bakwards for some who haven't even seen combat yet, and just work supply, and they get all this free gratuity for wearing fatigues...peopl act as if yr a cowrd for not joinin, ey'm not a cowrd and am gunna do several physical things in mey lyf, profession-wise, and don't wanna join, if ey wanna do somethin ey'll make mey own air ship and go 1-mahn army. That's another thing, the govmnt is tryn to get u s to think they're the onyl protectors of this countri and \"oh, no, w e can't let citizns take some of r glory\"\" by lettin em own a guhn n defend their households, they can tryn take r guhns, they just wanna move ovr the peopl easier when marshal law is declared and it's like infamus 2nd sohn, the wrld may be somewhat safer if wrapped in bubbl-wrap, but r rights would be trampled and freedom would b gone, freedom and rights OVER defense and security ALWAYS, n teechrs r told to teech the oposite. A drivin instructor told mey clas that if they got in an accident that they'd win even if they were at fault if polees came to report if involding a tenager as the other driver just cause w're yonger and theirolder, that's terribl, just cause 1 is OLDER doesn't meen they r RIGHTER then the yonger persn and can do what they want. Teechers todai, one in particular ey had, believed \"no one's perfect\" so REFUSED to give out 100s in clas even if r work permitted that (which HAS to be illegal somehow), that affects the system to if w e wanna go to a colleg all they look at r these \"grades\" these lettrs some (potential) idyots (teechin degrees...pieces of papr, r the easiest to obtain, fact) say so, and doesn't reflect the studnts actual intelligence, subjective testing is flawed that way, ther'es always the room for bias AND miscommunication, a student may know the answer and attempt to write it dwn but the teecher may not see the answer and fail it/mrk it wrng. OBJECTIVE testing isn't much better, 4 multipel choice answers or so each that could read weirdly/differently so that the student who may know the answer goes to mrk it dwn, is confused as to which to mrk and may not be elaborated on by the instructor, cause that's all that's there, a question written and 4 choices, it doesn't measure IF THEY KNOW it well enuff. standardized testing is what skooling is all about in this countri and it suks, it's all about repitition and memorization, and w're worked to near DETH so that when w e do graduate w e don't wanan do anymore work and peopl blame u s? It's the SAME B S since 6th grade thru colleg, that's the only major change in educatin is after elementry, it's the same format, students lrning THE SAME sht diff dai each dai after 6th grade (in mey experience). Ey found a nice clas in colleg here, a literatur, where it's not liek that format and is one of if not the best cla ey evr took here, it's just peopl talking and discussing lit/movees/televisn and there's not too much direction that it suks, but ey'm not sayn it should be a free for all as then it's no different from daili lyf, why even bother goin to skool, but there should be SOME (not too much nor too little) direction the teechr should initiate in clas to somewhat steer the clas into going, and let em go there, ey WANT to go to that clas, make peopl WANT to go to yr clas, teechr! Yeah if ey said all teechrs suk n yr creenie is ryt then mayeb ey meant it in THAT WORD not all teechrs as in facilitators/mentors, but the word, teechr, means to mself some1 who does these thigns ey listed above who suk who respond to a bos, the principl, and comforms to the govmnt and doesn't help peopl lrn wat they want, there certainly r some teechrs bettr then others, and the bahd ones needa b fyred! Peopl like to say resepc is earned, that DOES NOT mean it's ok to DISrespec some1 jus tcause they haven't earned yr respec, that's a diff respec, there's an inherent resepc one should have for all livn things! bulees exploit the system todai where the buleeD can't fight back and yet r tortured daili (as ey was buleed) and the teechrs do next to ntohing about it, go bak to the ol' dais let em go at it mahno y mahno and then they'd stop buleeing when they pick on the wrng persn. Ey woulda likd to get mey hnds on thsoe who harased mself and still haras mself in gam, but they're cowrds all of em, and ey had mey ey on a bigger rpize that collg had ey didn't wanna jeapordize, but bahd mn win when good ones do nothing, and theere r peopl who need to b taught a LESSN in manners and bois will b sois and galz will b galz in mey countri's futur when ey run it.

Ey've been told ey typ like a mentlly ill persn (these peopl shouldn't b brought into the convos as ey'm not talkn about em but bulees like to bring em up) even if ey was...THIS is how they'd treat a mentl persn just tryn to plae this gam? How pathetyc and ey make no apologeez. Yes, some know ey mispel some words ey'm uncomfortable w/ on purpose, but they're for various reasons dependant on the word in question, NONE of which r to trol others, and it's mey right to plae this how ey want and not spel what ey don't want to. IF one can't read it, ignor it or ask for clarification nicely. No need to say \"that sentenc gave mself cancr\" as peopl HAVE that diseas it''s NOT funy, meme or not. What if those peopl didn't know that? Ey've been trold logn before ever typn in chat and letting others know of mey speln preferences/problms and was stil ltrold, so that tells mself they woulda still anyways, cause thee r some pathetyc losrs who plae this gam that make mself feer for the futur of this race, despite a few nicer ones who restore mey fayth sometimes. Face it, yr a naive old timer who beleives perception is reelity, and it's not, ey don't care about anothers speln in gam, it'S NOT an indicator of their skill/know how, ey can op, ey've oped before and WILL op again and do wrld firsts. Getting trold only makes mself strongr, one more to prove wrng. So keep bein meen to mself Cap i tan kerk, ey'm only mroe determined to be who ey am and plae how ey want here and will not b buleed off here. Why don't these trols ignor mself? Ey'm not ignorn em, they have the nitial problm they ignor mself, yew don't go up to a strngr who's smakin their gumms in clas or somethin n say \"ignor mself\", YEW ignor EM! Ey have to throw bak what they're throwing first and defend mself against the libel and slandr ey get daili. And the govmnt is still makin money plaeing both sides if wEd was legalized (which it wil lsomedai) and yet will try to tell yong peopl not to smok it and this whole health crazz b s, give awards to those promoting healthiness, yew can't plae both sides, n get money from/to non healthy things and healthy entities. Peopl don't try to get yonger peopl (who's cafeteryas reflect this force on u s w/ onyl healthy food at some places) to b healthy for their own health, it's abuncha secret council peopl who run the wrld who think faht peopl/obese peopl r disgusting and don't wanan look at em, and r tryn to eliminat em, what ever happend to \"beauty is in the ey of the beholdr\" and \"be yrself\" and all that jaz when w e were yonger? Now it's the opposite and it suks, ey'm not sayn ey'm faht cause ey'm not, nor that ey will mary (likely) a faht gyrl, but ey will defend em like voltair said about rights/opinyons that differ. It's all bout the money, not to make yogner peopl healthier as if they care about u s, it's cause some peopl don't wanna look at faht peopl, well DON'T LOOK THEN, but don't tryn force their vision of controllin peopl's looks on this countri, that's what hitlr did and is fascis t.

The actual Heiroglyphics read Y S R I R. (Note on the I. That's more of an educated guess as to it being a proper I sound. Y is written as two Reads, and what we assume is I is written as a single reed. It's been argued that they are both Y, the double read being a more stressed Y.) Now, about the R there. The thing about Ancient Egyptian is it lacked a symbol for the L sound. This is similar to the situation with the Japanese Language. For example, other nations with an L in there name end up with an R, sea people known as the Philistines end up as PRST,\n\nActually, I missed another error in your earlier post.  You claimed that the Merneptah Stele is an Egyptian account of their conquests in the Levant.  It isnt.  It is actually an Egyptian account of their conquests in Libya, which is nowhere near the Levant, and actually is in the opposite direction from Egypt.\n\nThere is no reason that a monument commemorating battles in Libya would throw in a few lines about an area a thousand miles in the opposite direction.\n\nAlso, as you just pointed out, it is extremely difficult for modern translators to deduce place names from ancient foreign translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391970734", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

Do they have what i want in stock when i want it?  Do they carry the brands I prefer? Are their hours conducive to when i need to get parts. Are they in a safe neighborhood where my car won't get messed with while searching for parts?\n\nI am somewhat loyal, more out of convenience and past experience.  i.e. One local place (autozone) is staffed by a rotating set of monkeys that couldn't tell a screwdriver from a box end wrench. They don't know one part from another, where things are stocked, or how to effectively use their computer inventory system.  I rarely shop there as the experience is painful, versus a different store  (Advance Auto Parts) that has staff that at least know the basics, they know how to use their computers, and they know where the stuff is stocked.\n\nIf I'm not in a hurry I tend to check rockauto.com (which usually beats out the locals cost/brand wise even with shipping),  or even amazon/ebay for esoteric or \"new old stock\" items that sometimes come up very cheap (radiators and exhaust components come to mind...)  Some stores I'll go to for specific bits even if they cost more because I know they carry a specific better brand that's made in usa, canada or japan , vs mexico, china or taiwan.  Napa is/was good for this (lately their parts are \"more of the same\" (chinese with questionable quality) and you really need to look for gems (japanese/american/european parts) among the crap) and have excellent staff,  but rarely have decent hours or convenient locations (there's only one Napa within 15 miles of me,  but at least 5 advance-autos or autozones within the same distance, and those two have weekend hours where napa doesn't) as they cater more to shops than regular joe's.  Napa's public online catalog S U C K S though, and doesn't seem to have access to all the parts that the store clerks are able to find. Even their staff has told me they don't like it....\n\nI prefer working on my own car(s) because I know (or at least I think I know) it's done right and I'm not getting screwed on price or being taken advantage of.  The satisfaction of knowing I CAN FIX IT, is well worth it, a huge confidence booster, and puts me at an advantage over others, who are ignorant or don't care to learn how to maintain their vehicles, and end up paying 5-10x what it cost me to fix my own car..

You can use concentrated blast every 3 abilities and impact every 9 abilities.\n\nSo:\nCB W I W CB W C W CB W CH W CB should be the first 13. This uses concentrated blast and impact whenever possible.\n\nOne would then use Sunshine and drink an adrenaline potion bringing you to 35% adrenaline. Then use the following:\n\nCB I WM W CB A W CB C (ending at 61% adrenaline)\n\nThis takes 5+8*1.8=19.4 seconds. Leaving 5.8 seconds for Wild Magic cool down to end or 3 abilities . So use:\n\nW C CB WM (ending at 69% adrenaline)\n\nThis takes another 7.2 seconds so that’s 27.6 seconds total giving 30.6 seconds to get to full adrenaline again (not 32.4 because sunshine begins to CD instantly, meaning the 1.8 seconds is subtracted).\n \nAsphxyiate has another 20-7*1.8=7.4 seconds until it is off CD. 4 abilities left until impact is off CD and 2 for concentrated blast. However, If you use basics until asphyxiate is off CD you will go over 100%, so one should include omnipower here. So:\n\nW C CB O W I W CB W A (ending at 35%)\n\nThis takes 20.6 seconds meaning 6 seconds left. there are 4 abilities until Impact is off CD and 1 unil CB is off CD.\n\nIt will take 9 abilities or 14.4 seconds to get to 100%, going over the time by 8 seconds, meaning asphyxiate above can be cut out leaving us with:\n\nW C CB O W I W CB W instead. This only takes 16.2 seconds, leaving 8.4 left and ending at 50% adrenaline. Impact is 6 abilities off CD, but should be saved until sunshine is used and CB is 2 off.\n\nThere is little time until sunshine is off so we should build to 100%\n\nC W CB W CH W CB (ending at 100%)\n\nThis takes 12.6 seconds, meaning sunshine can be used again.\n\nNext sunshine is used dropping to 10%. CB is 3 abilities off, impact is off CD so:\n\nS I W CB W C should be used to get to 50%. Taking 9 seconds. Next:\n\nWM CB W A I CB W C W CB WM W CH CB I (ending at 100%)\n\nThis takes 5 (asphyxiate should be ended as soon as the last hit hits)+14*1.8=31.2.\n\nThis leaves 20.8 seconds to get back to full adrenaline and repeat the cycle so:\n\nO W CB W C W CB (ending at 58%) This takes 12.6 seconds, leaving 8.2 seconds to finish things up and gain 42% adrenaline. Impact should be avoided to save for when it’s sunshine and CB shouldn’t be used in the last 2 abilities. Impact is 2 off CD and CB is 3 off, so:\n\nW C W CB W CH (ending at 100%)\n\nThis takes 9.125 seconds and completes the rotation.\n\nGiving a final answer of:\nCB W I W CB W C W CB W CH W CB S (Adr) CB I WM W CB A W CB CH W C CB WM W C CB O W I W CB W C W CB W CH W CB S I W CB W C WM CB W A I CB W C W CB WM W CH CB I O W CB W C W CB W C W CB W CH S (Adr)\nrepeat from above adren potted sunshine\n\nCB: concentrated blast\nW: Wrack\nI: Impact \nC: Combust\nCH: Chain\nWM: Wild Magic\nA: Asphxiate \nS: Sunshine\nO: Omnipower\n\nI noticed I made an error with impacts at the start so there is a better possible solution.

On the down side - shrink will generate gobs of UNDO and REDO (alter table t move will not generate undo, alter table t move can be done with nologging to skip redo if you want)\n\n\nthat said, whether you use shrink or move within the same tablespace - it is highly unlikely (like zero percent likely) that you'll be able to shrink your datafiles by any meaningful amount.  Let's say your tables are about 1/3 free space - they might have extents allocated in the file like this:\n\n      t1 t1 t2 t3 t1 t4 t5 f t2 t4 t3 f f f f t5 t1 t2 t3 t4 t4 t5\n\n\nso, five tables, each having a few extents.  There is some free space in there too (f).  Now you shrink and free up the last one and a half extents for all segments:\n\n      t1 t1 t2 t3 t1 f t4 t5 f t2 f t4 t3 f f f f f t5 f f f f t4 f f f\n\n\nNow, you go to shrink your file, you'll be able to ONLY shrink it to where that last bit of t4 is.  None of the interior (f) extents can be released.  The last allocated extent in that file dictates the smallest that file will be.\n\n      t1 t1 t2 t3 t1 f t4 t5 f t2 f t4 t3 f f f f f t5 f f f f t4\n\nthat is what your file will end up looking like\n\nThis is why I suggest and will suggest again (note: this is psuedo code, I have not tested this 100%, the gist is there, review it, understand it before using it)\n\n\n    begin\n        for x in (select table_name from user_tables)\n        loop\n            execute immediate 'alter table ' || x.table_name || ' move tablespace perfstat2';\n            for y in (select index_name from user_indexes where table_name = x.table_name)\n            loop\n                execute immediate 'alter index ' || y.index_name || ' rebuild tablespace perfstat2';\n            end loop;\n        end loop;\n    end;\n\nthen drop tablespace perstat including contents and datafiles and optionally rename perfstat2 to perfstat.\n\n\nIf your goal is to reclaim space at the OS level, you have to reorganize the tablespace.\n\nif your goal is to reclaim space at the tablespace level, you have to reorganize the table(s) (alter move or shrink does that)\n\nif your goal is to reclaim space at the table level, just delete\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392208011", "subreddit": "oracle", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "ok well it's quite simple. so an octave is 8 notes (example: the harp is a c major scale which is c d e f g a b c. 8 notes. starts and ends on C.) a basic major chord follows a 1 3 5 pattern, meaning you take the first, third, and fifth notes in the scale and those 3 notes form the chord. now you can use any combination of two notes it will still be in the same key, ie: 1/3, 1/5, 3/5. the only difference is in sound so you pick which one sounds the best for that specific part of the song.\n\nnow this 135 pattern applies to any starting note. for example on the harp if you start on D, or 2, you get 2 4 6 . that's a D minor chord. if you start on E, or 3, you get 3 5 7. that's an E minor chord. \n\nchords can also be inverted. let's use a G major chord as an example. a standard G major chord on the harp is 5 7 -&gt; 2. but you can't play all 3 notes together on the harp. so what you do is you take the top note and move it one octave down. the end result is 2 5 7. it's still a G chord even though the first note is D.\n\nso now that you have all that awesome info, you simply have to apply it to the song. to do that, you figure out what key the song is in and you can start substituting single notes with two, three, or four note chords of the same key. but you have to do it delicately. too many chords and you'll ruin the sound. \n\nsome songs change key while it's progressing. the song of time is one of these songs. it starts off in D minor. the beginning of the song is simply a D minor chord played separately (D minor chord being 246 and the song starts off 62 462 4). it then transitions to F major, then to inverted G major, then back to D minor. so with that info hopefully you can insert your own chords into it :)\n\nwell i hope that wasn't too confusing and i hope it answered your questions. :D", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392243356", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A basic C Major scale is C D E F G A B C. All the roman numerals do is count from 1 to 7, from C to B. The C is our \"home\" note, which the music always wants to move back to.\n\nA chord traditionally consists of a triad, or three notes stacked as thirds. All you really need to know is that you skip a letter to make a third. So a C chord would be C (skip D), E (skip F), and G. C-E-G. Do this for each note in the scale:\n\nCEG-DFA-EGB-FAC-GBD-ACE-BDF-CEG\n\nIf you've seen roman numeral analysis before, you'll notice that sometimes the roman numerals are uppercase, and sometimes they're lowercase. And other times they have a ^+ or ^o next to them. These tell us what *kind* of chord it is. There are 4 basic kinds of chords you can make with triads: Major (CAPS), minor (lowercase), diminished (^o ), and augmented (^+ ). The difference between these take some longer explanation, but when you work it out, this is what your roman numerals look like when you do an analysis for our C scale of chords above:\n\nI - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii^o - I\n\nTo do a roman numeral analysis, you just need to figure out which groups of notes there are, and where those groups of notes fall on the basic chord progression line like above.\n\nThere are other ways that chords can be presented. Like, what if the chord is out of order (it goes EGC instead of CEG)? Or what if there are four notes instead of just three?\n\nA dominant seventh chord is a chord that has four notes. It consists of the V chord from our above example (the fifth note in a scale is called the *dominant*), and with an extra note on top. This fourth note is just like how we stacked the other three, where you follow the scale and skip a letter. This note (F) is called a minor seventh, because it is the seventh note in a minor scale that starts on the first letter of the chord. \n\nA G minor chord goes: G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G. The F was the seventh note, so it is a minor seventh. Our final dominant 7th chord looks like this now: GBDF. Or V^7 . \n\nResolving it is usually achieved just like a normal V chord - by going to back to chord I. The B is only a half step from C, which is our \"home\" note. Half steps *really*, **really** want to go resolve, which is why V chords really want to go to I chords. The dominant 7th also has an F, which is only a half step from the E in the I chord. So that's two notes in the V^7 that want to go to two notes in the I. \n\nThe V^7 also resolves to the vi and iii chords. This is because they both have a note that one of the V^7 notes wants to go to. If you remember, the vi chord in our example is ACE. That same C in the vi chord is where the B of the V^7 wants to go. Also if you remember, the iii chord in our example is EGB. That E in the iii chord is where the F of the V^7 wants to go. So you can resolve to those notes as well.\n\nI skipped over and simplified a lot, and I understand that, so please continue to ask questions if you're confused!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392246460", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It's also available on top left there is some sort of Spectator Menu, where you can navigate through options using mouse. Each of the options there is bound to top row keys, and last hit/deny one is the second one(Q W E R T Y U I etc)\n\nAlso also also, you can cycle through heroes by clicking through them in the top row(The top row that consists of hero icons, Radiant on the left, Dire on the right, kill score, and daytime indicator and clock in the middle). While in game, this only works on friendly heroes, but in spectator mode, you can click all heroes. Clicking a hero icon once focuses said hero. Double-clicking makes your camera move to said hero.

{"body": "It is extremely hard to put into words as it was so fantastical that words seem too little to describe it. Nothing can prepare you for what happens to you on DMT.\n\nFirst my vision fractured and I could see patterns everywhere, it felt like I was sitting in the worlds tallest roller coaster just about to go over that first hill.\n\nI was listening to Roar by Katy Perry as the video is quite colourful and I like that song and by all reports colours are a big part of the experience.\n\nSo where was I, oh yeah. Sitting in my chair feeling like I was about to go down a roller coaster, well after my vision, my hearing started to all I can maybe describe as stutter and then turned into an electronic ZZZZZZZZ sound which started to rapidly increase in tone not smoothly but in octaves and this is where it felt like I went over the hill and went down that roller coaster at the speed of light. I will paste below what I wrote about it:\n\n**Right at this stage the Katy Perry song was just starting at the line of:\n\nYou held me down, but I got up\n\nGet ready cause I’ve had enough\n\nI see it all, I see it now\n\n(Which is rather funny to me because of what happened next)\n\nSound started to echo and by the end of that line I felt like I was at the top of the highest roller coaster the world has ever seen and then, well and then as the next line of words in the song played I went down that roller coaster at the speed of light\n\nI got the eye of the tiger\n\nBut it sounded like this:\n\nI,I,I,I got got got got the the the eyeeeeee o o o o of theeeeee tigeeeeeeeeeeeeeer zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE (BOOOOOM)\n**\n\nAfter the word tiger there is a single drum beat and when that drum beat sounded reality shattered. \n\nMy hands and arms and entire body and mind melted out of existence right in front of my eyes like a water balloon filled with water that is popped with a pin and I exploded out into this space. (At this stage I thought I had just died)\n\nIf that wasn't enough of an experience in itself, THEN IT STARTED TO REALLY GET CRAZY.\n\nFor 1 second and also infinity years I felt every good feeling every person has ever felt or has yet to feel in a single moment and every moment yet to come. (Yeah, I know that does not make sense) I experienced a euphoric ecstasy, a complete and utter mindgasm, I can only describe it as making love to the universe, pure bliss unlike anything I could have ever imagined.\n\nI was not in my house any more. I was not even me, I was the universe, the universe was me. I had no body, no breath, no self and it was OK, it was freaking OK, better than OK, it was RIGHT. I started flying through this umm space at the speed of light and smashing through these membranes (Smashing is the only word I can describe it as but it was not a physical breaking but umm mentally smashing) Each one I smashed through my speed compounded twice the speed of light, 4 times, 8 times, 16 times until I was smashing through these membranes at a billion billion times the speed of light hitting a billion billion times more membranes.\n\nMy wife heard me moaning OH MY GOD in slow motion and came out of bed into the living room and put her hands on my shoulders. I opened my eyes and was completely lucid (One of the most mind boggling things ever after what was just happening to me)\n\nHOLY SHIT, I looked at her and she was beautiful beyond words glowing with an aura of light, an aura of bright light like 2 feet around her entire being and she emanated love and life. Then I noticed the colours, colours you have never even seen before filled the entire room. Everything was made up of fluorescent cubes that were square with round edges like a keyboard key. I felt like I was in a computer game, the cubes were glowing with the most fantastical colours and all had numbers inside them 1's 2's and 3's and when I moved the numbers all changed to show me where they were in time, it felt like I could see time.\n\nOK, so at this stage I am just astonished and can not believe what just happened to me and ask my wife to just hold my hand and it felt right. I told her how beautiful she was and said thank you to her.\n\nLater she asked me why I thanked her and I told her I thanked her for being a part of what I just experienced, it was natural to thank her at the time.\n\nAnyways, words really are not able to sufficiently describe what it was like but hopefully I have given you a little understanding into what it was like. I read a lot about DMT and watched a lot of videos over 3 years before I even tried it and honestly I thought I would just trip out see some awesome things, maybe go on a journey and that would be it, but nothing could or ever will prepare you for a DMT break through experience but it will change your life. \n\nSorry if my story sounds crazy but it was even crazier in real life by about a billion times.\n\nIf you ever get the chance, go make love to the universe some time.\n\n:)\n\n\nEdit: I have listened to Roar maybe 300 times since my experience 4 - 5 days ago and I almost cry and get the most amasing full body ASMR through the entire song every time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392297492", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi, musician here.\n\nIt just so happens that in around the Medieval era of music, monks would sing in what we refer to now as a 'major' scale, the 8 notes you speak of. Basically how it works is that each note in the major scale is a fifth apart from another (C G D A E B F C). What this means is G is 1.5x the wavelength of C. And D is 1.5x the wavelength of C and etcetera.\n\nOkay. We transition to the Baroque Era where we meet the biggest innovator of the 8 note system, Johann Sebastian Bach. This guy basically invented equal temperament, basically the division of the different wavelengths into 'notes'. At the time he was a leading figure in music, and if the leading figure adopts the division, so you better believe all the other kids do too. This was the first real definition of the 8 note system in the form of a major/minor format.\n\nSo basically the 8 note system is popular now simply because it's most convenient to both read/write in. There ARE string instrument pieces that have like the note between C and Csharp written, but I mean this isn't very common.\n\ntl;dr notes are 1.5x the (edit: frequency) of the previous note, the 7 distinct sounds become the the scale. We like it, so no ones bothered to change the definition. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392357636", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A standalone album called *[Crossings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossings_\\(Herbie_Hancock_album\\))* came out during this same period, and it's one of the very few albums Hancock did for Warner Bros. This is three years later than *BB*, but there are many similarities btw the two albums; and it is certainly well on par with *Bitches Brew* in terms of overall quality, musicianship, compositional daring, and general trippiness. If you like like *BB*, consider picking up a copy of *Crossings*…ESPECIALLY if you enjoy delving deep into challenging, intricate, layered, existential fusion with the benefit of mind-altering drugs.\n\n*Crossings* was recorded in the SF Bay Area (Pacific Recording Studios, San Mateo). Of the supporting crew, Benny Maupin (soprano sax, alto flute, bass clarinet, piccolo, percussion)—like Hancock—also played on *Bitches Brew*! The rest of the crew are lesser known but equally adept jazz musicians. The rhythm section consists of the phenomenal pairing of Billy Hart on trap kit with Buster Williams on bass (a dude equally skilled at jazz and funk), along with almost everyone else in the ensemble playing percussion together on the 8-min. percussion-exclusive intro to the 24-minute-long opener \"Sleeping Giant.\" Filling out the main ensemble, we have two other men on horns: the well-known Eddie Henderson (trumpet, flugelhorn), and Julian Priester (bass, tenor, and alto trombone).\n\nIn addition, the ensemble includes Patrick Gleason on synth (as well as, for all you Yes and Crimson fans, mellotron!), adding a spacey, extraterrestrial edge at times. The inclusion of Gleason pushes the texture of the music just a little above and beyond *BB*. The manner in which Hancock melds this particular aspect of the music with the very rooted, percussion-driven earthiness of his band's groove is a wonder to behold. Occasionally there are background vocalists (used for atmosphere—no lyrics), and congas are provided by Victor Pontoja.\n\nSpecial note about \"Sleeping Giant\": the piece is written in the so-called \"modern Phrygian mode\" (which, if the tonic is E, consists of the white keys [E F G A B C D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_scale#Modes_of_the_major_scale) and is easy to test drive on a keyboard by playing the familiar do-re-mi, white-keys-only sequence starting two white keys up from C on an E). Although I can't find the reference right now, in addition to Wikipedia's stating that the mode has [Greek origins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_mode#Ancient_Greek_Phrygian_mode), I'm pretty sure the Phrygian mode also has some association with Morocco as well. That would go along with the cover art of the album, which is a painting by Robertt Springett that appears to depict Spaniards having just crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in boats to meet with North Africans (hence the \"crossings\" of the album's title). The Phrygian mode is *very* rare in most of the major genres of modern music—rock, jazz, classical, ambient, techno. But curiously it is employed to great effect on an ambient album by Brian Eno, *Neroli*.\n\nIf you're looking for more recent albums of the same type of layered, complex, sophisticated fusion, \"Water Torture\" from *Crossings* is covered by Jeff Gauthier on his album *One and the Same* (2006); and another, similarly-sounding album worth getting is *Rewind That*, by Christian Scott (from the same year).\n\nIf you like the percussion aspect of *Crossings* and want something similar from that same time period, there's *[Sweetnighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetnighter)*, by Weather Report (1973), which I believe is the last album that graced the extraordinary bassist Miroslav Vitouš (who in addition composed the contemplative, existential masterpiece \"Will\" on that album).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392377298", "subreddit": "Music", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There's probably a good amount of you on here who know this already, but if you don't, it's pretty helpful and not too hard to learn. I'm talking modes!\n\nModes are just scales that build off of each note in the diatonic (major) scale. So take C Major for example: C D E F G A B \n\nIf we start on the D, but play all of the notes in C major, we get D E F G A B C, which is known as the Dorian mode. Do the same with the fifth, the G. We get G A B C D E F, which is the Mixolydian Mode. \n\nHere's all the fancy names of these modes and what scale degree they're built off of:\n\n1st: Ionian (Major)\n2nd: Dorian\n3rd: Phrygian\n4th: Lydian\n5th: Mixolydian\n6th: Aeolian (Natural Minor)\n7th: Locrian\n\nYou can get some pretty cool colors out of these different scales. You may be thinking, shit that's a lot to learn. But it's not! \n\nIf you've taken the time to study scales, you probably know a major scale shape or two. You want to pick one that is movable, or doesn't use any open strings. Learn a couple of these shapes and really get them down. Now, if you we're to go jam or something, your really musical friend might be all like, \"this one's in G Lydian!\" So now is where your knowledge of these modes comes in. The Lydian scale is built off the 4th degree, and G is the 4th of D Major. So the G Lydian scale contains all of the same notes as D Major! Using that movable scale shape, find a D Major scale, but start on a G. If you play the scale up (or down) to the next G, you've played a G Lydian scale, and will sound like a boss when jamming. \n\nThis use of modes is extremely useful and very cool. I can sit for hours using backing tracks in A Dorian or F Lydian and just go. Try to learn at least 4 or 5 of the scale shapes to really utilize the entire neck. \n\nHappy Jamming! \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392403552", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Simple question but not so simple of an answer.\n\nThat's like asking what the appeal is to women, or men, or long hair, or. . . or anything that turns you on.\n\nMy sadism is a part of me.  It's part and parcel of who, and what, I am.  The same as my being a man is part of who I am.  The same as me being heterosexual is part of who I am.  All of these are things that I don't actually control.  I didn't make a choice to be a guy any more than I made a choice to like women or be a sadist.\n\nI've written extensively on reddit about my journey to where I am.  How I was convinced that I was a serial killer because of the sadistic urges I felt at a young age.  So the idea that sadism is something that appeals to me is one that makes me chuckle.  More than once in my past, but no more mind you, I've wished that I could just be \"normal\" like all the rest.\n\nBut I've come to enjoy, if not REVEL in, my sadism.\n\nThe feeling of causing pain or discomfort in others is. . . well it's like an indulgent.  Like eating your dessert first or that split second when you are singing as loud as you can to your favorite song before you realize others can hear you.  It's not right to call it a guilty pleasure, but it's CLOSE.  \n\nWe all know that \"men don't hit girls\".  That's what I was always taught.\n\nBut. . .\n\nWhat if they do?  What if a guy DOES hit a girl?  What if the girl likes it?  What if the GUY likes hitting the girl?  THAT's the feeling of indulging in my sadism.\n\nI see others talk about power exchange and adrenaline rushes and mutual pleasure.  And that's great!  I understand and won't disagree with those sensations.  But for me it comes down to. . . scratching an itch.  Something I can put off, even put off forever should I choose to.  But when I DO indulge, when I DO cause pain. . . wow.  ***N O T H I N G*** feels better at that point in time.\n\nSo I can't tell you the WHY of things.  I can barely tell you the how of it. But I can tell you that it's less about appeal for me as it is about being who I am when I can.\n\n[DS](http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/n74sk/per_request_link_dump_of_my_reddit_posts/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392445482", "subreddit": "BDSMcommunity", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "9ths are 7ths with an extra note.  Really no different.  The dominant 9th is the dominant 7th with another note; the minor 9th is the minor 7th with another note, the major 9th is the major 7th with another note.  All the same.  A useful addition is the dominant 7b9, which, again, is the dominant 7th with another note.  The 9th is used for color and for complexity but otherwise *doesn't do anything*.\n\n11th chords are indeed pretty uncommon, because the 4th is such an unstable interval.  I'd say an 11th chord wouldn't really come up unless there's a 4th between the bass and melody.  But since the 11th is 6 notes out of the scale anyway, it's often just another name for something else -- I see m11's in bossa nova, but you can pretend it's really a 2nd inversion chord.  The only time I've seen 11th chords really used is in chords such as F/G, voiced G C F A, a kind of mix between a G7 and and F chord.  It resolves to C, being both dominant and subdominant at the same time.  Kinda cool.\n\nThe #11 is actually a very common note to use.  It's a lot less dissonant than the 11th, that's for sure!  Try playing a major chord and stick the tritone above it.  Wow.  Beautiful sound, no?  Just play a C E G C F# on the piano, and you'll hear it.  The F# wants to resolve down to E in a whole step, which is why it's so pretty.  The 9th and #11th are the happiest notes in the chord, in my opinion.  When it's actually a maj7#11 chord, you get a more bittersweet experience.  This is a good tonic chord, by the way.  Your classical training about the tritone is not *wrong*; it's just *incomplete*!  The tritone is the tofu of musical intervals.  It can be whatever you want, from a soft dessert with ginger glaze to soy-soaked spongy goodness to hot dogs that taste like rubber.  There are many ways for a tritone to resolve.  For example, Db F G resolves to C E G.  The tritone in C G B E F# doesn't need to resolve anywhere.\n\nI usually save 13's for dominant chords, and the 13 is basically a 3-2 suspension.  In C, G13 would be G F B E, with the E tending to the D.  G7b13 would be G F B Eb, same thing but in C minor.\n\nAs for #9, I don't know enough about it, but from what I do know, it's actually a mislabeling of a b10.  A chord with a major and minor 3rd might be called a #9.  For example, in C, you might have G B F Bb.  This works -- well, works-ish -- because the Bb tends *down* while the B tends up.  It does meant that you have an honest-to-goodness diminished 8ve in the chord, and not a major 7th.  I like writing chords with this, because it's a very dissonant yet very directional sound.

{"body": "He used a lot of chromatic melodies in his chord progressions. One common thing I've noticed is he tends to play the 2nd chord of a key as Major instead of Minor. So in the key of C, instead of going C, Dm, F - he would go C, D, F. This creates a chromatic walk-down using the notes G, F#, F, which are contained in those chords. \n\nOne of my favorite examples of his use of chromatic notes is in the song Strung Out Again. The verse starts on A and ends on E but stops at every note in between. \nThe chords are: A G#aug C D Dm A# E7\nWith these notes: A G# G F# F E \n\nThen the chorus uses the same chromatic notes, but with different chords: Am E G D F C.\nSame notes: A G# G F# F E\n\nIt's pretty damn brilliant considering he was still able to weave catchy, accessible melodies through these chords.\n\nNote: I've never been taught music theory so some of my wording might be wrong.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392583671", "subreddit": "elliottsmith", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Perhaps some that might have some voice leading. Maybe some borrowed chords or secondary dominants. I like the Beatles, so here's what I wrote.

C9 is also Em7b5 with an added C, and Em7b5 is Gm6, which is pretty much the most borrowed of all the borrowed chords -- I *know* you've heard IVm6 -&gt; I plenty of times. I threw the G7s in there to add tension and release between its F and the D major chord's F#. You could also replace the first G7 in the third bar with G#dim7 (4 5 6 4 6 4), like Wiinner128 did. It fits all the notes and adds even more tension to release on the D (that's what Pattie Boyd said), but it's less rock'n'roll.\n\nIf I was writing a rock chorus, and I had to run the melody through twice, I'd write this.\n\n    D - - - / E7 - - - / G - - - / D - - G7\n    D - - - / E9 - E7 - / G - G7 - / G#dim7 - G7 -\n    Bm7 - - - / G - - - / E7 - - - / A7 - A+7 -\n    D - - - / E9 - E7 - / A#7 - G7 - / D - - -\n\nWith a repetition of the last FEDFEDCD melody bit at the end on another four bars:\n\n    E7 - - - / A#7 - - - / D - - - / D - - -\n\n    G#dim7 : 4 5 6 4 6 4  \n    A+7    : 5 8 5 6 6 5  \n\nNote how the A - G# - G - F# is reversed through the Bm7 -&gt; G -&gt; E7 -&gt; A7 chord sequence.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392585019", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's usually referred to as the constant release technique.  It is similar to heel-toe (of which there are several variations), but the idea is to always get back to a playing position to be able to play another stroke.  Heel-toe is great for quick doubles (on a single pedal) or fast footwork on a double pedal (a double stroke roll between the feet, for example), but it doesn't work well for continuous strokes because the foot ends up in a different position than it begins in.   [Here's a description of the constant release technique from Steve Smith.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqj3p8rF4ew).  Also, Jojo Mayer is known for using this sort of foot technique.  There's a youtube video of him demonstrating it at a drum clinic (In the 90s, I think).  I don't have it on hand but I'm sure if you dig around there you can find it.\n\n\nExercises that I like are basic rudimental sticking patterns (paradiddles, double paradiddles, triple paradiddles, paradiddlediddles, single stroke rolls, double stroke rolls, and inverted double stroke rolls), except instead of playing them as R L R R etc, you use the sticking to describe the position of your heel.   So using a paradiddle, you have R L R R L R L L .  Let R mean that your heel is in or moving to the UP position and L mean that your heel is in or moving to the DOWN position.   So starting with your heel down:\n\nR: Heel moves off the plate, the stroke is played from the ankle while the leg moves into the up position.\n\nL: The leg drops while playing the stroke and the heel moves back down to rest on the plate.\n\nR: The heel lifts off the heel plate again and the ankle plays the stroke as the leg moves into the up position.\n\nR: The leg stays in the up position and the stroke is played from the ankle.  This is probably difficult at first and at slow tempos because you may require some core strength to keep your leg in the air.\n\nL: The leg drops as the stroke is played, heel moves back down to rest on the heel plate.\n\nR: Leg lifts into the up position again as the stroke is played from the ankle.  \n\nL: The leg drops back down as the stroke is played and the heel is returned to the plate.\n\n\nL: The heel stays on the plate and this stroke is played as a normal heel-down stroke.\n\n\nYou can use this method to come up with exercises for other sticking patterns.  Singles (up / down / up / down) are quite useful and I would probably start there.  Doubles are good too ( up / up / down / down) because they force you to get comfortable moving in different ways.  It might seem overwhelming and complicated at first, but it's really not that bad after you get the hang of it!  Try playing 8th/8th triplets/16th notes along to a metronome or some music that you enjoy and just focus on consistent strokes and making it feel good.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392593255", "subreddit": "drums", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Vowels can be standalones in Japanese \"a/i/u/e/o\" and are used to indicate a long sound (Such as in \"Susanoo,\" which can be written like that, or like \"Susano'o\" or like \"Susano\" with a line over the \"o\").

Three genera are still living: the giant and the silky anteaters, and the northern and southern tamanduas, and several genera are extinct.\nMyrmecophaga tridactyla - Phoenix Zoo.jpg\nTwo-toed anteater balanced on a stick.jpg\n\t\nLesser Anteater.jpg\nA giant anteater (top), a silky anteater, and a southern tamandua\n\nOrder Pilosa\n\n    Suborder Folivora (sloths)\n    Suborder Vermilingua (anteaters)\n        Family Cyclopedidae\n            Genus Cyclopes\n                Silky anteater (C. didactylus)\n            Genus †Palaeomyrmidon (Rovereto 1914)[3]\n        Family Myrmecophagidae\n            Genus Myrmecophaga\n                Giant anteater (M. tridactyla)\n            Genus †Neotamandua (Rovereto 1914)[4]\n            Genus Tamandua\n                Northern tamandua (T. mexicana)\n                Southern tamandua (T. tetradactyla)\n            Genus †Protamandua (Ameghino 1904)[5]\n\nPhysical characteristics\nGiant anteater skeleton with visible \"knuckle-walking\" forelimbs\n\nAll anteaters have elongated snouts equipped with a thin tongue that can be extended to a length greater than the length of the head; their tube-shaped mouths have lips but no teeth. They use their large, curved foreclaws to tear open ant and termite mounds and for defense, while their dense and long fur protects them from attacks from the insects. All species except the giant anteater have a prehensile tail. [6]\nBehavior\nSleeping giant anteater\n\nAnteaters are mostly solitary mammals prepared to defend their 1.0- to 1.5-mi2 (2.6- to 2.9-km2) territories. Normally, they do not enter a territory of another anteater of the same sex, but males often enter the territory of associated females. When a territorial dispute occurs, they vocalize, swat, and can sometimes sit on or even ride the back of their opponents. [6]\n\nAnteaters have a poor sense of sight, but an excellent sense of smell, and most species depend on the latter for foraging, feeding, and defence. Their sense of hearing is thought to be good. [6]\n\nWith a body temperature fluctuating between 33 and 36 °C (91 and 97 °F), anteaters, like other xenarthrans, have among the lowest body temperatures of any mammal,[7] and can tolerate greater fluctuations in body temperature than most mammals. Its daily energy intake from food is only slightly greater than its energy need for daily activities, and anteaters probably coordinate their body temperatures so they keep cool during periods of rest, and heat up during foraging. [6]\nReproduction\n\nAdult males are slightly larger and more muscular than females, and have wider heads and necks. Visual sex determination can, however, be difficult, since the penis and testes are located internally between the rectum and urinary bladder in males and females have a single pair of mammae near the armpits. Fertilization occurs by contact transfer without intromission, similar to some lizards. Polygynous mating usually results in a single offspring; twins are possible but rare. The large foreclaws prevent mothers from grasping their newborns and they therefore have to carry the offspring until they are self-sufficient. [6]\nFeeding\n\nAnteaters are specialized to feed on ants, termites and sometimes spiders, each anteater species having its own insect preferences: small species are specialized on arboreal insects living on small branches, while large species can penetrate the hard covering of the nests of terrestrial insects. To avoid the jaws, sting, and other defences of the invertebrates, anteaters have adopted the feeding strategy to lick up many ants and termites as quickly as possible — an anteater normally spends about a minute at a nest before moving on to another — and a giant anteater has to visit up to 200 nests to consume the thousands of insects it needs to satisfy its caloric requirements. [6]\n\nThe anteater's tongue is covered with thousands of tiny hooks called filiform papillae which are used to hold the insects together with large amounts of saliva. Swallowing and the movement of the tongue are aided by side-to-side movements of the jaws. The anteater's stomach, similarly to a bird's gizzard, has hardened folds and uses strong contractions to grind the insects; a digestive process assisted by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt. [6] The tongue is attached to the sternum and moves very quickly, flicking 150 times per minute.\nDistribution\n\nSilky anteaters and northern tamanduas extend their ranges as far north as southeastern Mexico, while giant anteaters can be found as far north as Central America. Southern tamanduas range south to Uruguay (giant anteaters did also until their recent extirpation there) and the ranges of all species except the northern tamandua overlap in eastern Brazil.[6] Anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent, during most of the Cenozoic Era. Once the Isthmus of Panama formed about three million years ago, however, anteaters invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.\nHabitat\n\nAnteater habitats includes dry tropical forests, rainforests, grasslands, and savannas. The silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) is specialized to an arboreal environment, but the more opportunistic tamanduas find their food both on the ground and in trees, typically in dry forests near streams and lakes. The almost entirely terrestrial giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) lives in savannas. [6] The two anteaters of the genus Tamandua, the southern (Tamandua tetradactyla) and the northern tamanduas (Tamandua mexicana), are much smaller than the giant anteater, and differ essentially from it in their habits, being mainly arboreal. They inhabit the dense primeval forests of South and Central America. The usual colour is yellowish-white, with a broad black lateral band, covering nearly the whole of the side of the body.\n\nThe silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) is a native of the hottest parts of South and Central America, and about the size of a cat, of a general yellowish color, and exclusively arboreal in its habits.\nEvolution\n\nAnteaters are one of three surviving families of a once diverse group of mammals that occupied South America while it was geographically isolated from an invasion of animals from North America, the other two being the sloths and the armadillos.\n\nAt one time, anteaters were assumed to be related to aardvarks and pangolins because of their physical similarities to those animals, but these similarities have since been determined to be not a sign of a common ancestor, but of convergent evolution. All have evolved powerful digging forearms, long tongues, and toothless, tube-like snouts to make a living by raiding termite mounds. This similarity is the reason aardvarks are also commonly called \"anteaters\"; the pangolin has been called the \"scaly anteater\"; and the word \"antbear\" is a common term for both the aardvark and the giant anteater.\nPopular culture\n\n    In recent years, the anteater has emerged in children's books, television shows, and other forms of entertainment. One such anteater is Francis the Anteater.\n    An anteater is also the mascot of the University of California, Irvine, named Peter the Anteater.\n    A talking giant anteater (sometimes shown with a giant, fanged maw) is also featured prominently in the television series Kingdom Hospital as the alter ego of a main character (Anubis).\n    An anteater named Sniffles is one of the main characters of the internet series Happy Tree Friends.\n    Heatmor, a Pokémon from Generation V of the video game series is based on an anteater. Its counterpart Pokémon is Durant.\n\nNotes\n\n    Jump up ^ \"Giant Anteater Facts\". Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved 2011-07-30.\n    Jump up ^ \"Giant Anteater\". Canadian Museum of Nature.

{"body": "First things first, your chord voicing could use some work. Typically, chords are voiced more spaced out in the left hand, and denser in the right hand. This is mainly because of overtones, as the lower notes' overtones will clash more through the reverberation. A way to fix this and get more interesting harmony is reducing the amount of voices. Right now, you have between 4 and 5 voices. Typically, you want to keep this number constant to avoid the blocky feel that is currently present. Doubling the octave is unnecessary, and so are the fifths of the chord. Already, in the first measure it would be best to eliminate the C4, reducing the voices to 4 (SATB). I would also move the E in the left hand up to the right hand to create an alto line. Repeat the process in the other measures, but make sure to keep good voice leading (aka. logical motions. If you can't sing it easily, you're likely doing it wrong!). \n\nIts a really good start, and I like the half cadence. Sadly though, that cadence is not a phrygian half cadence, as you are using Vsus4 instead of iv^6. The chord should be spelt C E A C in SATB.

It's spoon-fed to us throughout our life that we need to get a degree in order to be successful when that is far from the real truth. My cousin who is the same age as me is going to a State school, paying 20-30k a semester, and do you know what his degree is seriously? Packaging engineer. Think of the UPS boxes that you get when you order things online; packaging engineers design them. l o l o l o l \n\nHaving children is much more then just this thought, though. Please remember that. It's a lot of thoughts and a lot of thinking. This was not something I just suddenly decided that I didn't want, but rather it was a very long thought process.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392742644", "subreddit": "RedPillWomen", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Lots of excellent stuff in here - some I didn't see:\n\n* YMO - BGM: They're the Japanese Kraftwerk. See Rydeen for a synth pop classic, but BGM is on a whole different level. Plenty of space in the music. It sounds to me like an album that was written by the keyboards/machines themselves while the band was sleeping. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzsdza2iyvE (By the way, the gear list in this album would make all of you cry tears of joy)\n* Venom 18 - Mystery Organization: Side project by Legowelt full of 80s crime/spy movie soundtrack synth sounds, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsdhNVefzvQ\n* Anything by Drexciya - E L E C T R O, made on 808s and SH-101s, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imKh_TKqHt4\n* Hypnosis - S/T: Instrumental italo disco/space synth where the cheesy riffs just keep coming, and I mean that in the absolute best way possible. Completely brilliant. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blEzq3zltrE\n* Ladytron - 604: Their first album and possibly the most synth-heavy, and by synth-heavy I mean tons of MS-20s. I'm not sure anyone has nailed synth pop as good since this album (and yet it doesn't sound just like 80s-revivalism). Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q73lgVFI3Wc\n* Autechre - Tri Repeate: I consider the Tri Repeate era of Autechre to be their masterwork. Earlier albums fall in with the 90s-Warp crowd, later albums are too cerebral, but this is a perfect blend of both sides. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KsRIM4Jx4Q\n* Metro Area - S/T: Not only is this one of the most well produced albums ever (see also Steely Dan, \"Random Access Memories\", etc), but it's a rare perfect album - I could listen to this a million times and never get bored. It takes the sound and aesthetic of 70s disco and early 80s italo and somehow sounds completely cool, completely non-ironic, totally in control. Amazing. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxv8DQAzS2s&amp;list=PL6HOohggkMxWD5-3Vlu18SaqxGyUE76cK&amp;index=3\n* Chvrches - The Bones of What You Believe: Maybe it's too new to be a \"classic\" but I feel like this album will be remembered well as time goes on. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mTRvJ9fugM\n* Plone - S/T: I'm not sure anyone remembers this album - it was a one-off on Warp, and kind of skates the line between 70s-Moog nostalgia (see Stereolab and The Moog Cookbook for more) and their warp contemporaries (See Plaid, Chris Clarke, etc). Not something I want to listen to all the time, but I think they really nailed what they were going for here. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNxZ2xijsCg\n* New Order - Technique: The sound of Madchester (I've never liked The Happy Mondays). Really you'd be well off listening to any 80s-era New Order album. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRLAlvS5w7Y\n* Pet Shop Boys - Please: Their first album. This was the mid-80s so the album is filled with samplers and Fairlight sounds.

{"body": "For those of you not aware of the dota community, here's a short explanation of who rtz/arteezy is:\n\nHe's an incredibly talented, but also incredibly immature player (18? maybe still 17? he's still in high school). He's not currently on a sponsored team (nor has he ever been), but the assumption is that his current team, S A D B O Y S, will eventually be picked up by EG since a large chunk of the team is made up from the fragments of the old EG. I guess you could complain to EG, but realistically speaking he's unfortunately way too good for someone not to pick him up. Rtz is pretty well known for being ragey, doing moronic things, and listening to terrible music, so it doesn't surprise me that this happened. I'm mostly disappointed at the lack of reaction from the dota community - hell, my community - but not particularly surprised about that either.\n\nAlso worth noting is the NADota community - a forum, distinct from NA dota which refers to the north american scene as a whole. Many pro players and pubstars in NA are members, and that forum is as toxic as it can get, full of flaming, racist and homophobic slurs, and endless drama. One incident that sticks out is a member/caster GrandGranT who, when casting a pro match, named the in-game broadcasting slot 'n*****rs @ Neodota', and when called out on it on reddit and other places, posted an 'apology' at NADota which amounted to 'Sorry if you got offended, I did nothing wrong, go fuck yourself'. People even defended him. The presence of NADota sure as hell doesn't help things either.\n\nFunnily enough, reading the comments on the deleted /r/dota2 thread, people are saying that it was grandgrant mostly fueling the fire and that rtz, when he realised what his followers were going to do, was asking them on stream not to. I wouldn't be surprised if this was closer to the truth - rtz is much more of an immature moron than actively malicious. I don't feel this excuses his actions, and I feel the community should still force him into apologising and making amends (not sure what those should be though), but the presence of grandgrant certainly explains a lot of things for me. \n\nIn general, dota seems to have few girls involved - I can only think of maybe 8 community members who are women, of whom 1 is a caster, 1 is a lower-tier (i.e not in a T1 team) pro player, and 1 is both of those.

{"body": "First time contributing to the daily prediction thread. Thing you might need to know about me. I don't bet on low return matches. For example 4 keys for 1 or 4 rares for 1. My predictions are made based on my own opinions and you are not obligated to follow them. I'm merely a information provider and you are responsible for your own decisions.\n\nMYM vs Hehe United  \n- Pretty much a coinflip match. Both teams took 1 game off each other in their recent match up according to dotabuff.  \n- I would favor MYM because of their recent matches with VP. I like their drafts.  \n- It is a bo1. Usually it is better to bet on teams with the better return, but I'll place my keys on MYM.  \n\nRoxKis vs PR  \n- It is a bo3 match. Looking at how strong RoxKis has become, they should be taking this series.  \n- I think chshrct is not playing on PR. Watch out for their standins. Don't think it will be Xboct or Dendi, as they will be playing against liquid at that time. Probably Scandal again.  \n- Will abstain due to the odds being too low and the suprise factor is with PR.  \n\nVP vs Sigma  \n- I feel a lot of people underestimate Sigma due to the walkover against RoxKis yesterday. There have been a lot of **rumours** about internal problems in Sigma.  \n- Sigma has been down in the slumps losing to PR, and RoxKis(When they still had scandal).  \n- VP lost to next.kz yesterday. Next.kz had an edge in their draft because they were teamfight oriented and they did not give antifun any space to farm.  \n- It seems like VP is experimenting their drafts. VP needs to stick with their teamfight/splitpush play style.  \n- Due to the ambiguity factor on Sigma, I'll place my keys on them. It is a bo1 after all. I suggest you watch VP vs Fnatic before placing your bets.  \n\nNavi vs Empire  \n- Navi lost to RoxKis recently while Empire is looking really strong.  \n- It is a bo1 so everything comes down to the draft. I'll place my keys on Empire due to their consistency.  \n\nUG vs Denial  \n- I remember denial being good but recently they lost to revenge, psst and top5.  \n- Denial seem to have only 3 members so far and they'll be using 2 standins for this match.  \n- I think Benjaz left UG and joined Revenge. So UG will also be using a standin for the match. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks :)  \n- Would place my keys on UG since this a bo2.  \n\nCloud9 vs Swage  \n- Cloud9 is looking strong despite losing to liquid. I think they have been scrimming.  \n- Swage's dotabuff seems good. They've been winning their recent games, but got stomped by S A D B O Y S.  \n- Cloud9 is a tier 1 team and Swage is tier 2 at best. Will abstain due to the returns for Cloud9 being so low.  \n\nSadboys vs Cloud9  \n- I hate this match. I am a fanboy of both teams.  \n- As much as I love Cloud9, Sadboys seems to be the superior team in this matchup even taking down Empire and Liquid without dropping any games.  \n- Bo1 factor again. Will be betting small on Sadboys.  \n\nDenial vs Ehug  \n- I recommend you watch UG vs Denial before betting on this match.  \n- Ehug did win Psst yesterday while Denial lost to Psst few days ago.  \n- Will abstain due to the returns of Ehug being so low. It is worth betting small on Denial if Denial stomps UG.  \n\nSwage vs Sadboys  \n- Only way i see Sadboys losing this is a weird draft by them.  \n- Abstain due to low returns.  \n\nWill try to provide more information next time and improve on the format. There are also several other factors to take account for. It is wise to check whether a team is playing with each other before going into a match. This show preparation and may decrease communication problems. Thanks for reading.

{"body": "I have to say you've definitely come a long way in a short time. I'm looking forward to where you get to by the end of the year.\n\nThe biggest thing I can say to you is that your guitar work seems to be much better when you aren't singing, so I'd agree with you that you ought to work out your guitar parts a little bit better. The best way I can think of to work on this is just boring, repetitive fundamentals. You may hate them, most of us do, but man they work.\n\nGrab a metronome (if you don't have one, [try this one](http://www.metronomeonline.com/)) and grab your guitar and pick any chord and just do one strum down (V) per beat. Start slow, because accuracy is far more important than speed. Once you've found a speed where you can do those downstrokes exactly on time every time (maybe start out at 60 or 72 and see how that feels, and adjust from there) then add upstrokes (\\^), so now you're doing two per beat. Your arm motion stays the same, you're just strumming on the upstroke, so it's V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ and then alternate 4 beat measures going V V V V then V ^ V ^ V ^ V ^ (remember each V is on the metronome beat, and each ^ is in between beats)\n\nOnce you've got the hang of that, then just start removing some of the strokes to make a fun pattern. Here are a few that I like:\n\nV V ^ ^ V ^  (like Green Day's Good Riddance)  \nV V ^ ^ V V ^ ^ V ^ V ^  \nV _ V V ^ (the _ is no strum on the beat. This is the one from the beginning of your song)\n\nYou can play with this and make up an infinite number of strum patterns. Just make sure you master each one you choose so that you can play it without really thinking about it. That way when you start singing, your hands just kind of automatically do their thing without you having to pay so much attention and getting mixed up.\n\nAlso, in general, practicing with a metronome will help you out a lot. It will be hard at first, because none of us is as good with a metronome as we think we are without, but in the end it will make you a better player.\n\nYour recording quality is much better than in the past.

Similarly, for any amount of damage, doing slightly less can be a huge difference in the outcome of a fight. Compare a dead adc to a really low adc who can still output some damage to a slightly below half hp adc who still feels safe enough to kite you and probably lifesteal back most of the damage.

Seriously haunting sometimes. And hey, look, [here it is on youtube.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mUX1l89npg) Fun fact, *Spleen* off of William Shatner's **The Transformed Man** is one of Baudelaire's works also featured on this album.

Pretty classic stuff, production by Dre right after The Chronic had dropped the year before, classic singles like *Gin and Juice* and *What's My Name?* Not really a lot to say here that people don't already know.

{"body": "There are two ways to look at this: \n\n1.) Switching scales over each chord in the progression\n\n2.) Playing in one mode over the whole progression\n\nIf you are going to switch scales for each chord, then it is a simple matter of looking at the chord and figuring out which modes share the intervals/notes in the chord. If it is a major chord, it will have a major 3rd, so you know it's going to be the major modes (Ionian, Mixolydian, Lydian). Look at the other notes in the chord and compare them to the notes in each of the major modes and use the one(s) that match. If the chord has a minor 3rd, then you'll want to look at the 3 minor modes to see which one shares the chords other intervals/notes. \n\nIn the case of playing the same mode over a progression, then you can take the chords and write out the notes to see what will work. Let's say the progression is Am, G, C and Em. Write out the notes of those triads: Am: A C E, G: G B D, C: C E G, Em: E G B. Now arrange them in alphabetical order starting from the root of the 1st chord: A B C D E G.\n\nSo, looking at the modes, you can deduce that the two scales that best match the progression are A B C D E F G - A Aeolian, and A B C D E F# G - A Dorian.\n\nEdit: typo", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392931602", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes certain weapons require certain stats. To see which stats are required to wield a certain weapon open your inventory scroll to whichever weapon you want inspect it and there should be two things which read Param Bonus which tells you how well it scales with certain stats and Req Param the minimum required stats to wield the weapon. From left to right the stats are Strength Dexterity Intelligence and Faith. So for example the zweihander you found in the graveyard should read under ReqParams 24 10 0 0 which means to wield it you need at least 24 str and 10 dex. However, with STR there is an exception; whenever you two hand a weapon the game treats as you have 1.5 times your actual strength. This allows you to equip weapons which require more STR than you actually have so long as you 2hand it. The zweihander can be 2handed at 16 STR instead of 24. Note this only applies to STR not DEX INT and FTH. And the Param Bonus simply dictates how much certain stats increase the dmg of your weapon when you invest into them the order of worst to best scaling is E D C B A S. Weapons with S A and B scaling will see a hefty boost in dmg with every point invested up to 40 D and C will see a moderate increase while E is never worth investing past the minimum required stats.\n\nAnyways, I rambled on for quite sometime but hope this clears up everything and I hope you also learned how to pick weapons you might wanna try.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1392948375", "subreddit": "darksouls", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Excellent post.  \n\nOP, don't get too hung up on theory - many great guitarists have played their entire lives without a lick of theory.  It's complicated - no doubt.  However, a knowledge of this will make you a better player in the long run.  \n\nI'd suggest starting with something small, like playing the major scale at different positions on the neck.  get a feel for the shapes that you have to play.  Play as many notes (in the scale) above and below the base scale that you can go.  \n\nThen, play the same exact scale, but just start at a different note.  For example,\n\nThe C Scale = C D E F G A B C\n\nInstead of playing it like this, start on the D note:  D E F G A B C D\n\nGuess what?  You just played D Dorian.\n\nI know this mirrors /u/XWindX 's information, but hopefully you didn't just gloss over all the terms and notes.

{"body": "There are two (main) types of scale: major and minor (and a whole mess of others that aren't important right now).  It turns out that if you take all of the notes that it takes to play a major scale you also have all the notes it takes to play a different minor scale.  For example, if you take C major that goes C D E F G A B C, while A minor goes A B C D E F G A.  Neither uses any sharps or flats, but one starts on C and the other on A.  A piece in C major or in A minor would both have the same key signature, but that isn't to say that they are exactly the same--a piece in C major is likely to tend to return to C and to work with various chords that are important to the C major scale (e.g. G major, F major), while a piece in A minor would tend to return to A and to use chords relevant to the A minor scale.  It is pretty easy for a song written in C major to slip briefly into A minor since they use the same notes, though; this can be a method to make the piece more interesting.\n\nAs for how to tell what two keys are going to be \"relatives,\" that's pretty simple.  To go from major to minor look at the sixth note.  The sixth note of the C major scale is A.  The sixth note of the A major scale is F# (A B C# D E **F#** G# A).  To find the relative major scale from a minor scale you look at the third note:  F# G# **A* B C# D E F#.

{"body": "Museveni's statement:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=213758742150843\n\nIt seems the topic of homosexuals was provoked by the arrogant and careless Western groups that are fond of coming into our schools and recruiting young children into homosexuality and lesbianism, just as they carelessly handle other issues concerning Africa. Initially, I did not pay much attention to it because I was busy with the immediate issues of defence, security, electricity, the roads, the railways, factories modernization of agriculture, etc. When, eventually, I concentrated my mind on it, I distilled three problems:\n\n1. those who were promoting homosexuality and recruiting normal people into it;\n\n2. as a consequence of No. 1 above, many of those recruited were doing so for mercenary reasons – to get money – in effect homosexual prostitutes; these mercenary homosexual\nprostitutes had to be punished;\n\n3. homosexuals exhibiting themselves; Africans are flabbergasted by exhibitionism of sexual acts – whether heterosexual or otherwise and for good reason.\n\nWhy do you exhibit your sexual conduct? Are you short of opportunity for privacy - where you can kiss, fondle (kukirigiita, kwagaaga) etc.? Are we interested in seeing your sexual acts – we the public? I am not able to understand the logic of the Western Culture. However, we Africans always keep our opinions to ourselves and never seek to impose our point of view on the others. If only they could let us alone. It was my view that the above three should be punished harshly in order to defend our society from disorientation. Therefore, on these three I was in total accord with the MPs and other Ugandans. I had, however, a problem with Category 4 or what I thought was category 4 – those “born” homosexual. I thought there were such people – those who are either genetic or congenital homosexuals. The reason I thought so was because I could not understand why a man could fail to be attracted to the beauties of a woman and, instead, be attracted to a fellow man. It meant, according to me, that there was something wrong with that man – he was born a homosexual – abnormal.\nI, therefore, thought that it would be wrong to punish somebody because of how he was created, disgusting though it may be to us. That is why I refused to sign the Bill. In order to get to the truth, we involved Uganda Scientists as well as consulting scientists from outside Uganda. My question to them was: “Are there people that are homosexual right from birth?”. After exhaustive studies, it has been found that homosexuality is in two categories: there are those who engage in homosexuality for mercenary reasons on account of the underdeveloped sectors of our economy that cause people to remain in poverty, the great opportunities that abound not withstanding; and then there are those that become homosexual by both nature (genetic) and nurture (up- bringing).\nThe studies that were done on identical twins in Sweden showed that 34% - 39% were homosexual on account of nature and 66% were\nhomosexual on account of nurture. Therefore, even in those studies, nurture was more significant than nature. Can somebody be homosexual purely by nature without nurture?\nThe answer is: “No”. No study has shown that.\nSince nurture is the main cause of homosexuality, then society can do something about it to discourage the trends. That is why I have agreed to sign the Bill. Since Western societies do not appreciate\npoliteness, let me take this opportunity to warn our people publicly about the wrong practices indulged in and promoted by some of the outsiders. One of them is “oral sex”. Our youth\nshould reject this because God designed the human being most appropriately for pleasurable, sustainable and healthy sex. Some of the\ntraditional styles are very pleasurable and healthy. The mouth is not engineered for that purpose except kissing. Besides, it is very unhealthy. People can even contract gonorrhea of the mouth and throat on account of so-called “oral sex”, not to mention worms, hepatitis E,\netc. The Ministry of Gender and Youth should de-campaign this buyayism imported from outside and sensitize the youth about the healthy life style that is abundant in our cultures. We reject the notion that somebody can be homosexual by choice; that a man can choose to love a fellow man; that sexual\norientation is a matter of choice. Since my original thesis that there may be\npeople who are born homosexual has been\ndisproved by science, then the homosexuals\nhave lost the argument in Uganda. They should\nrehabilitate themselves and society should assist\nthem to do so.\n\n\n\nYoweri K. Museveni Gen.

{"body": "F I N A L   P I E C E 1\n\nIt is a deliberately androgynous face hidden by a mask, which hides the figure from anybody realizing who they really are inside, which could really be anyone, regardless of standing, gender, attitudes or beliefs. It alienates them from society, and hidden behind the façade they can die inside and nobody would ever know or notice. The mask is made of metal, cold and unnatural, and utterly stiff, unable to let anyone in. It is also scratched with indecision, fingernail fissures gouged out when they reach to pull off the mask and reveal everything, but receding when they realise what consequences might arise by revealing their true nature. By this we would argue that keeping secrets as a rule is not human nature, and only by regrettable necessity do lies arise.\n\nHowever, the cracking of the mask shows also the strain of maintaining a lie, and as the lie grows the fractures do too, gradually disintegrating, letting the light of truth out, a beautiful fire surrounded by filth and grime of a society weighted towards degrading attitudes for anybody who goes against the grain. This corrupt society is represented by the two dark and faded figures either side of the ‘protagonist’ of the piece, who in this way present the fear and uncertainty that surround some people, that they cannot even confess to the lonely silence without the dread of being overhead, spreading through their mind like a paranoia; however, as dark and unattractive as that society is, it also represents a darker thought as present in their mind as the fear there, that it would be so much easier to be anybody else, and that they would prefer to blend into the background as much as anyone else, and not feel like they were under constant surveillance.\n\nThe border is made to look like gold, which would have cost more than the picture within, but is dirtied and scuffed by corruption and bigotry, a disease which afflicts all things in reach of the human hand, and represents how, after coming out as LGTB, many people are worth less than a scrap of metal, and in a broader sense, how much more appearances are worth than a life well led.\nIn total, however, the piece presents both an inward and outward conflict: whether to come out and come whatever may to stand head held high unmasked, even if that meant the alienation of family, friends and society and take the chance of a life in solitude; or to stay in the closet, in the dark, and to let emotions fester and collect together with internal conflict as to whether what they are is wrong, and cause the worse alienation of themselves, and live a lie, not a life – a lie to your friends, family, and a lie to yourself which doesn’t comfort you at night, instead distorting everything in turmoil of self-hatred and bitterness for yourself. Its purpose is to demonstrate, in a shockingly moving way, the condition and contempt in which ‘closeted’ members of the LGBT communities are treated, as unfair but real it is, and to give the strong message that this is not the way that a human should be treated, regardless of orientation, gender or attitude.\n\n-\n \nF I N A L   P I E C E 2\n\nThis piece, instead of representing the struggle of hiding your true identity, presents the greatest fears of what could happen, should ever someone with such a secret reveal themselves in honesty or by accident, or be dragged into the light by someone else. It is the same figure as used in the first piece, however more bedraggled, with the stark red scars and scabs running from the scalp to the upper back, caused by uncleanliness and lack of hygiene due to their being thrown out onto the street, for what they are – regardless of who they are as a person. This is the presentation, not just of what could happen, but what really happens to many people, blackened out of their family name simply because they were born as the wrong gender, or because they loved someone in a different manner.\n\nThis often creates a sense of self-shame, that it is the fault of them and not those who reject them, creating a sense of alienation and a black hole inside. This has been also presented, in the sense that it feels like the light and warmth of the Sun touches nothing beyond the skin, and creates the feeling of utter coldness and emptiness, which nobody can see, but you can’t help but feel is a flaw in your  being. It makes the world seem like misery, with little more than endurance tethering you, and this is presented by the rain, which we generally associate with the most dreary of days and with the tears of despair and dejection, but with the dark skies in the piece it is presenting the feeling of darker days for the rest of your life, with the Sun, the only brightness in the world, being infinitely far away, doesn’t care, just as nothing else does.\n\nThere is nothing but the road, which leads into the unknown, curving in the opposite direction to what was your home, little more than a memory in the distance you wish you’d never compromised; this home is presented by the Church in the distance, lit up by warmth in the sepia desolation, as the houses of God are often seen as a place of forgiveness and repentance, but with that also comes what can be seen by some as the greatest institution of homophobia and transphobia existing. This creates an even more defeated attitude, that there is truly no place for acceptance.\n\nThe stitched together clothes, held together by nothing more than necklaces found on the road, are representatives of how it is so easily possible that coming out can shatter your life, and that you must pick up the pieces and try to put back together as much as you can, but it will never be as clean or near-perfect as it was, nor will it ever stop being a regret of having put an end to that life.\n\n-\n\n“When we don't know who to hate, we hate ourselves.”\n\n- Chuck Palahniuk\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393274526", "subreddit": "LGBTeens", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

For example, it's much easier to cast a 2cc and 5cc spell (or leave mana open for abilities) than it would be to cast two 5cc spells in one turn. And with over half your spells costing 5cc or more, that's going to happen quite a lot.\n\nBeing so top heavy would hamper your ability to react to your opponents' actions. I don't know what your deck's strategy is, but it would be much more difficult to implement your strategy if you rarely have enough mana to do multiple things in a turn. I realize your probably trying to cheat big guys into play via the graveyard, but you might find more consistency if you reduce the number of fatties and go with more cheap reanimation and entomb-like tutoring effects. That would free up some room for cheap disruption staples like disenchant or doom blade, which would give you a bit more flexibility than yet-another-big-bomb.\n\n\nHere's my take:\n\n0cc: x x x (3)\n\n1cc: x x x x x (5)\n\n2cc: x x x x x x x x x x (10)\n\n3cc: x x x x x x x x x x x x (12)\n\n4cc: x x x x x x x x x x x (11)\n\n5cc: x x x x x x x x x x  (10)\n\n6cc: x x x x x x (6)\n\n7cc: x x x x (4)\n\n8cc: x (1)\n\n9cc: x (1)\n\nWhat do you think?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393281149", "subreddit": "EDH", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here is something else that I thought needs pointed out, not all the information is wrong, a lot of it is correct but for the misconceptions to be stopped something needs to be acknowledged. \n\n1. What is the difference between a Key, a Mode and a Scale? (First line of the lesson, and actually the first 2 paragraphs) \n\nThere is a difference between the meaning of all 3.   He also says that modes are hard to explain because there are so many ways to think about them. It really only comes down to one thing, it's just that people have taken it upon themselves to give it more meaning and definition that what it really is. A mode is not a sequence or order or notes or a melody, this fits more to the definition of a scale. IOW playing D to D using the C major key signature is not the Dorian Mode. It's just a scale, specifically it's the C major scale, or sometimes is used to define the group of notes that are in a Dorian mode. Referring to this as the Dorian Mode is what is confusing a lot of people IMHO. To go ahead and define \"Key\" while we are at it, is simply a group of notes, diatonic to a center much like mode. Since we are bringing modes into the picture however now it's  better to have a more general view of the meaning of \"In a Key\" as simply referring to a group of notes without a center(currently). At this point I am probably going to cause some confusion so. IF we look at the *scale*  of C D E F G A B C we call that the C major *scale*. We also call this the *Key* of C. Referring to the fact that it contains all of the notes in the *key* of C. Now lets take a look at the *scale* D E F G A B C D. Well these are the same notes that are in the C major scale and are in the \"Key\" of C also, so technically it's a C major scale. However we're taught in online lessons, Guitar World Magazine etc(a whole other issue in itself). that this is the Dorian mode, but it's not! A mode has a center, a mode has a function and is simply more than a group of notes.  That's the whole point of having modes and Keys is when the center changes from the (long ago) typical center or strongest center of the Major Key(Ionian).  For those who want to argue now because you were taught that D E F G A B C D is the Dorian Mode, tell me then, how is D your center? What is pulling to the D? Play that scale from D to D over top of a C major chord accenting the D's as haaaard as you can and tell me what you hear. It won't be the dorian mode. So then what causes that pull towards the center???? \n\nNow to answer another question. Why does everyone say to practice playing a scale to hear a mode or to learn modes? It's simple as a way to learn what notes make up a mode you're given a scale, then to show what note needs to be made the tonic in order for that mode's tonic to be the center they show you the scale from tonic to tonic of that mode. You end up with what you're shown here C to C, D to D, E to E, and on. It's a guide as to what a mode is but not a \"how to\". That is completely different. What's happened is someone has taken this to mean something else and the misconception is passed down and taken literally. Importance is put on an order of notes (I still don't know how this even makes sense to anyone) and the pull to the center is given to that scale order somehow( again in practice you will see this just doesn't make sense.)\n\nSo then what is a mode if it's not a scale or a key? It's not something simple and you won't learn it from a quick article or online lesson. My suggestion is to keep learning music theory. Before you move on to \"Modes\" you need to learn chord theory. Most players try to tackle modes when they get to scales which often is learned first or hand in hand with chord theory but you need the chord theory first!!!!!!!!! Can you tell me how to build a maj7#11 chord without out a chord chart? If the answer is no then I would hold off on modes and learn chord theory.  Can tell me what mode you are in if the maj7#11 is your \"I\" chord? If you don't know what \"I\" means then  I would work on learning chord progressions. If you know the answer then you probably have a grasp on modes. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393311401", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Going to post one since I feel like.\n\n* **[CIS] vs Hearts ( 55% / 45%)**\n\nGoing based on the fact that CIS drew with NE and DT while hearts lost to DT. However, hearts have a chance to take this so if odds are too skewed, going on hearts. If not, CIS.\n\n* **[5inq] vs Birdgang ( 60% / 40% )**\n\nOn dota wage, odds are 1:0.6 for 5inq, so it's alright to bet small (?) I did not like the way that birdgang lost to the other teams, therefore going on 5inq.\n\n* **[Fd] vs G8 ( 65% / 35% )**\n\nOn dota wage, odds are still decent for Fd. Singaporean pride i guess? But i kept hearing complains bout fd being really rude and morally wrong so I'm indecisive about this. I guess abstain?\n\n* **Lgd.cn vs Arrow (ABSTAIN)**\n\nThis match is tough to predict as LGD is one of the top teams but their mid(and captain) player is not around anymore. It's replaced by maybe, who i heard is a dota-allstar, but I wil still consider them shaky, as they have not played recently. On the other hand, arrow has been taking games left and right.\n\n* **[[[EG]]] vs Throw.kis ( 70% / 30% )**\n\nRox is back to thrash, and EG is S A D B O Y S renamed. This should be EZ for RTZ.\n\n* **[Empire] vs Sigma.int ( 65% /35% )**\n\nEmpire took two games off Navi yesterday, while sigma has shwon signs of rebanding. GOGO SILENT.\n\nGLHF.

{"body": "Hey on the flip side I unfortunately pay attention to the ~if you are a feeeemale of at least average attractiveness and not overweight then you LITERALLY can just stand on the sidewalk and LITERALLY millions of guys will throw themselves at you~ societal, guys are always pursuing bullshlit, and no, it does not feel to be the case for me (single for 2 long, sane, smart, cute I guess IDEK, etc etc etc etc)[ok I complain about it too but I don't quite put the blame on all the dudebros out there]. You know what? Sometimes shit just doesn't work out. And you know what? Pretty much the only advice from my therapist? That I can't really internalize but I will dole it out nonetheless? That things happen at different times for different people and we don't always get what we want when we want it. And that people of all sizes, attractiveness levels, places in life, incomes, intelligence- it doesn't matter- they can be and are all in relationships. And just become someone IS fat/balding/blue collar, does not mean that they deserve love or a relationship or happiness even less.\n\n\nI think some of the problems you've encountered from your post do seem to be a result of how online dating works (also, women dating men encounter this too, come the fuck on), maybe also unlucky selection bias of the women you have been dating have yielded such results. Honestly I don't have any answers on how to deal with it all well internally, but going down the 'why aren't things working out for me when I have a b c d e, other people don't have that and they have relationships!' is a crummy path (that I have been down, and still find myself going down). Going down the path of 'all these women are doing this and idk why and it sucks' is also pretty detrimental. Hang in there though, and recognize that a confluence of luck, online dating's weird paradigm, people being their own people and making their own people decisions, and just life is gonna play out in finding relationships and love and sex and all that jazz, for better sometimes and worse others.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393375546", "subreddit": "OkCupid", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As a Diana main I would be sad if you didn't give her a shot. She really made me get into this game with how fun she is to play. I feel like she has been nerfed quite a bit but 100% still viable. Difficulty to do well i would say is 6/10 10 being the hardest. Here are some tips I have for her off the top of my head.\n\n-In lane you need to be somewhat safe until 6. Farm with Q and passive, and always try and land a q on the enemy when going for minions. Some people have a very hard time dodging her Q with its unique travel path.\n\n-Diana requires lots of resistances as she is an \"all in\" champion. Vs an AP mid I always rush Abyssal Septer, Vs AD its an Hourglass. Ryalis can be another great item for Diana.\n\n-There are many ways to build her. As the step above mentioned a few items I will go over some others. DPS Diana will usually build a Nashors Tooth 1st or 2nd. Personally I feel like that item is better for a jungle Diana. If you are going for burst which I recommend is a Lich Bane for your 2nd item after the 1st item being defensive.\n\n-Once you hit level 6 it is time to punish your enemy for being too close. Act like you are just trying to farm by getting two autos off on minions. When the passive is charged throw Q R W E R Ignite Dead. During that time you can usually get another passive strike off. There are few champions that can survive that lvl 6 damage without burning flash.\n\n-Once you have hit level 6 do not be afraid to roam all over the rift with Diana. As her post lvl 6 ganks are very effective you can snow ball very hard. Help your lanes!!!\n\nI hope I gave you a few things to go off of. If you have any questions message me or follow me on my stream where I mostly play Diana. twitch.tv/xlunargoddess.  I am also willing to do customs with viewers who need helping working on mechanics.

{"body": "This. I've played the ever living shit out of this game and, imo, none of the other support upgrades even come close to these two. small maps demand Dexterity, and larger maps make ammo a must! People will disagree with me, but I think if you go into Big Team or a CTF on a large map without ammo, you're significantly gimped.\n\nThink about it: If you're skilled enough to stay alive long enough to run out of ammo, then you have to go find more or use a weapon you're less comfortable with. With the ammo perk, you can sit back firing round after round of suppressive fire. While you may not get all the kills you used to, it is a H U G E advantage for your team when you're putting shots on everyone and nobody is at full health. On maps like Complex and settler that are large with few vehicles, I actually roll with ammo/firepower and grab a BR/Lightrifle. I go to a corner with good cover and a great view of the map, then I basically can just fire constantly for long periods of time without any worries. In addition, if I get a power weapon, I can opt to switch if out for either the BR/LR depending on the range of the power weapon so as to always remain versatile. \n\n\n[EDIT] it's also great for that k/d everyone seems to be obsessed with.

{"body": "**So What about Crafting?**   \nI am willing to bet my hat that you will fall in love with this crafting system. If you’re a good crafter, you will HQ everything you touch. If you’re a bad crafter, come see me. I’ll get you straightened out :P as for what to pick as a crafter? Everything, well most everything lol (see below). The beauty of crafting is; the more trades you level up, the stronger they all become, as they complement and enhance your skills at performing other trades. \n\n*Resources*  \n\n* Progress – Completion status of an item\n* Quality – Chance to HQ the item\n* Durability – The remaining “HP” of an item. If it hits 0 before you finish your progress, you fail the synthesis. All abilities that increase Quality or Progress directly, will consume 10 durability. \n* Craftsmanship – increases the progress gained from synthesis type abilities \n* Control – Increases the quality gained from the Touch type abilities\n* CP – your Resource pool for using abilities, increasing this value directly impacts the maximum actions you can take \n\n\nFor this portion I’ll give you three ratings on each craft, and detail what and why you should pick it.\nThe ratings are done the same way as the class ratings above   \n\nProfitability- does this class make a good profit?    These are done on the basis that a new patch has launched and oversaturation has yet to occur  \nNecessity- is this a necessary skill for me to have?    \nValue- is this a valuable skill to have    \n\n**Alchemist**   \nProfitability: ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆  \nCrafter of potions, remedies, and mystical items, alchemists are a quirky breed of crafter. They provide several useful abilities for other trades, and is highly advised to level up. They can make a decent profit off of the creation of potions, but the simplicity of potions can cause market overflow. \n\n**Cross class Skills:**  \n*Tricks of the trade* - Level 15  \nNecessity: ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★☆☆  \nGrants 20 CP – Can only be used during Red Light. Very good for restoring your CP  and allowing more actions. Extremely valuable. \n\n*Comfort Zone* - Level 50  \nNecessity: ★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★☆☆  \nConsumes 58 CP, and restores a total of 80 CP over 10 steps. basically invests your CP for later usage. Very effective and good ability to have.\n\n**Armorer**  \nProfitability - Profitability: ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆  \nYou want to make the pew pew less pew pew for people? That’s an Armorer. You’ll make protective wear for Paladins, Warriors, and Dragoons. They can make a pretty penny off of gear if they get on it early in a patch. Too late after a patch, and the prices plummet due to oversaturation. Armorer contributes nothing to other crafters, only level this if it complements your fighting class, or you want to be a completionist.\n\n**Cross class Skills:**  \n*Rapid Synthesis* - Level 15  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ \nNot a very useful skill. Has the potency of 2.5 basic synthesis actions, but fails 50% of the time. Not advisable to get. \n\n*Piece by Piece* - Level 50  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ \nNot a very useful skill. Increases progress by (Progress total – Progress needed)*.3 (so 30% of the remaining progress needed). This skill is W O R T H L E S S. Not advisable to get. \n\n**Blacksmith**  \nProfitability - ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆\nNice craft to have leveled, it can make some money, and has some nice abilities, but it lacks anything that sets it as a “zomg” crafting class like the other three classes I mention here. \n\n**Cross class Skills:**  \n*Ingenuity* - Level 15  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ \nLowers the level of a synth by three for five turns if your level is below the synths level. Only really useful if crafting something way over your level. Forget about this ability once you hit 50, as it no longer works. \n\n*Ingenuity II* - Level 15  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ \nNot really a game breaking ability. It practically doubles the potency  of your Synthesis abilities. It lowers the level of Any synthesis by three for three steps. it can effectively cut down the number of progress actions you need to complete a synthesis by half. It’s nice to have, but you can easily work around not having it.\n\n**Carpenter**  \nProfitability - Profitability: ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆  \nYou make bookshelves, bows, and spears…. Not much more than that. this skill generates minimal profitability, however it is INVALUABLE as a support craft. It gives two AMAZINGLY good support abilities, one of which is mandatory to being a professional crafter. I recommend this as your Second to level craft.\n\n**Cross class Skills:**  \n*Rumination* - Level 15  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ \nRestores a portion of CP equivalent to the number of stacks of CP Per stack of Inner quiet. (If I remember correctly it is 5-8 per). This ability is very useful when just starting out as a crafter, however it loses utility the higher you go, as you get higher and higher CP pools which allow you to rely only on tricks of the trade. \n\n*Bryegots Blessing* - Level 50  \nNecessity: ★★★★★★★★★★  \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★★★  \nOne of the Three “best” crafting abilities in the game. Increases quality at a rate of 40% per stack of inner quiet. 10 stacks of inner quiet would give a 400% potency quality increase action for a mere 24 CP. This ability is absolutely AMAZING, and should be one of the first two abilities you aim for. Hands down, this ability is invaluable when reliably producing HQ, or 1 button 100% HQ macros. \n\n**Culinarian**  \nProfitability; ★★★★★★★★★☆  \nChef. You can call me master chef. This class is my number one recommended “first to level”. Your synths, while large, are SUPER cheap to make. You can literally find all of your materials from NPC’s for the first 30 levels practically. Not only that, it competes with two other classes for first place for the highest profit margin of all the crafters, AND provides **Three** great abilities. You cannot go wrong with leveling this first. Plus you get to wack things with a skillet if you get bored &gt;_&gt;\n\n**Cross class Skills:**  \n*Hasty touch* - Level 15  \nNecessity: ★★★★★★★☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★★★\nIncreases Quality by 100%, has a 50% chance to fail costs ZERO CP. When properly mitigated with the Steady hand II ability, this has an 80% success rate, and is very good for getting  you stacks of inner quiet up for a big finisher.\n\n*Steady Hand II* - Level 37  \nNecessity: ★★★★★★★★★★  \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★★★  \nCompletely replaces steady hand I for all other crafters. Absolutely invaluable, this is one of the three “Best” Skills in the game. Increases success chances for all actions by 30% for only 5 more CP than its predecessor.  A Must have skill. \n\n*Reclaim* - level 50  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★★★   \nCosts a hefty amount of CP however it provides a unique benefit. If you don’t reach an acceptable level of quality, or change your mind mid synthesis, this ability will allow you to intentionally break  a synthesis and have a 90% chance to get everything back. Extremely useful if you are about to miss the quality requirements to HQ on a costly synthesis, and want to try again. becomes less useful the better you become as a crafter, eventually you can force it out completely. \n\n**Goldsmith**  \nProfitability; ★★★★★★★★★☆  \nBecause Everyone likes shines. Gives a few ok abilities. The primary booster of this class is the fact that it s a cash crop. Everyone needs accessories, , and they are the most popular items for people to use for spirit bonding and HQ ones are most popular because of the eased bonding requirements of HQ. You make almost every single accessory slot on this class. Leatherworker makes a few, but not nearly as much or as varied as goldsmith. People will practically throw money at you. \n\n**Cross class Skills:**   \n*Manipulation* - Level 15   \nNecessity: ★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆     \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★★★  \nGreat ability here. It basically replaces masters mend 1 &amp; 2, and for less CP with a twist. It restores the durability over multiple turns, 10 per turn. \n\n*Innovation* - Level 50  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆  \nThis is practically the definition of an “ok” ability. It increases your control by 50% for a few steps. when coupled with great strides and bryegots blessing, it’s practically a joke to HQ Synths. It’s not needed but it makes it easier as your material and gear levels are climbing. \n\n**Leatherworker**\nProfitability - ★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆\nYou get some pretty awesome crafter AF with this class. It’s a personal favorite of mine. You get to make a wide variety of armors and accessories, giving you multiple markets to target. It has one of the BEST level 15 synth abilities out there. Take this trade to 50 only if you want to have it for complimenting your primary class, making money, or a completionist desire. \n\n**Cross class Skills:**   \n*Waste Not* - Level 15   \nNecessity: ★★★★★★★☆☆☆     \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★★★\nYour Next four actions consume 5 durability if they would consume any. So basically, with this action you can double the amount of durability you have available to work with. You can with, some luck, essentially make an endless crafting loop where you could force anything, no matter how high the progress or quality marker was set,  to HQ and complete. You basically keep recycling Tricks of the trade, Waste not, Manipulation (or MMII), and comfort zone which can potentially give you an infinite amount of actions to take. I personally have forced a synth to take two hundred steps with this trick, just to prove I could.\n\n*Waste Not II * - Level 50  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ \nYour Next eight  actions consume 5 durability if they would consume any. Its basically a longer version of the level 15 ability. Bad thing is, currently it has zero utility in any rotation that I know of. Its delay is longer than any other ability, which means you basically loose those extra steps, invalidating the ‘reduced’ cp. WN1 works much better in every rotation, but for a little bit more CP. Don’t bother aiming for this ability. Its got no purpose in any serious synth. It can be used a lower level synths that your just burning through for whatever reason… but don’t bother. There isn’t a synth below level 49 you couldn’t naturaly finish with 100% HQ without using this.\n\n**Weaver**  \nProfitability; ★★★★★★★★★☆  \nYou can make people look fly. Has some pretty nifty abilities, and possesses one of the “Big three” must have skills. Makes a good profit, and is in the top three profitability bracket, because every class in the game wears cloth on at least one slot. Everyone needs pants :P They are the pants masters!\n\n**Cross class Skills:**  \n*Careful Synthesis* - Level 15  \nNecessity: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆    \nValue:       ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆  \nIncreases Progress by 90%, but can NEVER fail, and it costs ZERO CP.  Very useful, extremely useful. It only gets a one star rating simply because it gets replaced once you hit level 50. \n\n*Careful Synthesis II* - Level 50    \nNecessity: ★★★★★★★★★★  \nValue:       ★★★★★★★★★★  \nAnd this is the Other “best” crafting ability in the game that I mentioned.  Increases progress by 120%, costs ZERO CP, and can never fail. Once you get this, you can take every other synthesis action off of every crafter forever. This is all you will EVER need to complete progress. This is a top priority to obtain. You should level this craft second or third. \n \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393444965", "subreddit": "ffxiv", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I know I'm very late to the thread and nobody will really have a chance to read this, I think that's okay because I know I'm typing this for myself.\n\nI was in prison for 6 years (5 years in I was found not guilty). 2 years in I felt calm, I mostly kept to myself, although I had a few friends. One day I was given a new cell mate, and it because the worst experience in my life. To this day I can't sleep, I self medicate any drug I can get my hands on, I have a girlfriend (god bless her) who I can't sleep next to because if I do, I will go into shock when she touches me. \n\nAnyways, my new cell mate seemed fine, he told me he never been to prison before and was scared, I was just like him so I think I wanted to make sure he felt okay, I stay in my cell to play cards with him, we talked, after a few days I truly started to bond with him, he became my friend, we both loved video games, came from the same town, hell, I think we must of played the \"would you rather\" game for hours on end just laughing.\n\nThen, randomly I was asked by another prisoner about my cell mate, he wanted to know why he was locked up, I didn't even know, but it made me curious, so I asked him and he confided in me that he raped a minor (I later found out that the person he \"raped\" was his wife who was underage\" I was shocked and scarred of what would happen to him so I tried my best to avoid the people asking me about him. Until I was beaten and raped. The funny thing was I didn't mind it. I didn't even know why I was standing up for some random guy, but I knew that he wouldn't last long if people knew about his past. The rape went on for weeks, I shouldn't even call it rape, I would go meet the man, strip down, and he would do his thing, it became a scheduled thing. It was fucked up. \n\nEventually, it started being more than just 1 guy, it was a group, and it got worse and I couldn't handle it, I broke and told them why my cell mate was behind bars.  They gave me an option, either I kill my cell mate or they kill both of us. \n\nI'm fucked up, I fuck....I didn't even think about killing him until one day he started talking I don't even remember what he was saying, I just snapped, my hand grabbed a book I was reading, all I remember is the feeling of the hardcover and the letters of the book p r i d e and prejudice. The feeling of the texture on my fingers....I can feel it now. I smashed his head in, the book needed up flying out of my hand, but without a beat I started using my hands, he was dead, but I didn't stop, some part of me liked it, everything pent up in me since forever, arguments I lost, losing my job, my hunger, in my head I believed the more I smashed my fists into this bloody dead body, the more I would be happy.  I kept going, laughing, punching, laughing, punching, until a guard came and pulled me off of him.  \n\nI remember his face, his smell, his smile, the way he would shuffle the deck, the feeling of his blood on my hands, my friend. \n\nBut even more so I will never forget how good it felt, better than any drug, the rush of it all. The feeling of pure power, in all aspects I was his god and I was passing judgement onto him. I was everything......and that scares me. It opened up a door that I believe should never be opened in a person. It keeps me up at night, it laughs at me when I'm awake.

{"body": "As a Diana main I would never give up on her. She really made me get into this game with how fun she is to play. I feel like she has been nerfed quite a bit but 100% still viable. Difficulty to do well i would say is 6/10 10 being the hardest. Here are some tips I have for her off the top of my head.\n\n-In lane you need to be somewhat safe until 6. Farm with Q and passive, and always try and land a q on the enemy when going for minions. Some people have a very hard time dodging her Q with its unique travel path.\n\n-Diana requires lots of resistances as she is an \"all in\" champion. Vs an AP mid I always rush Abyssal Septer, Vs AD its an Hourglass. Ryalis can be another great item for Diana.\n\n-There are many ways to build her. As the step above mentioned a few items I will go over some others. DPS Diana will usually build a Nashors Tooth 1st or 2nd. Personally I feel like that item is better for a jungle Diana. If you are going for burst which I recommend is a Lich Bane for your 2nd item after the 1st item being defensive.\n\n-Once you hit level 6 it is time to punish your enemy for being too close. Act like you are just trying to farm by getting two autos off on minions. When the passive is charged throw Q R W E R Ignite Dead. During that time you can usually get another passive strike off. There are few champions that can survive that lvl 6 damage without burning flash.\n\n-Once you have hit level 6 do not be afraid to roam all over the rift with Diana. As her post lvl 6 ganks are very effective you can snow ball very hard. Help your lanes!!!\n\nI hope I gave you a few things to go off of. If you have any questions message me or follow me on my stream where I mostly play Diana. twitch.tv/xlunargoddess. I am also willing to do customs with viewers who need helping working on mechanics.

You would be on the hook to CA for $8,700, meaning your federal taxable income would be 111k, so you would pay ~24k to the federal government.\n\nWhy should you pay more money to the federal government, than someone in CA would, because CA decided to have higher taxes than your state? \n\nIf we do away with this system, a 120k wage earner in CA and UT would both owe ~27k in federal taxes, and be on the hook for the same amounts of state tax, which means you will both pay more in taxes.\n\nTo be dead honest, none of that really matters, at 120k a year you alone make 240% more than the average *household* income, are in the top 10% of all wage earners, and are rich.\n\nThis is not about \"red and blue\" states, it is about the wealthy, and better off people paying their fair share to the federal government, regardless of what their state chooses their tax rate to be.\n\nThe only reason this is being now becoming a red/blue issue, is because it affects the rich people in blue states, because they will pay more taxes, and if there is one thing rich people hate, it's paying taxes.

{"body": "I assume that by \"complete a game of Pokemon\" you mean \"beat the Elite Four.\" If you gotta catch 'em all, it ain't gonna happen.\n\nLet's do some algebra where:\n* A = Likelihood of moving in the right direction on the map\n* B = Percentage of Kanto that is tall grass or water (where you can be attacked by wild Pokemon)\n* C = Total number of trainers on the map (we can assume the player will inevitably fight every single trainer)\n* D = Average number of Pokemon held by each trainer\n* E = Statistical likelihood of encountering a wild Pokemon while walking through tall grass or swimming\n* F = Average number of hits it takes for a Pokemon to be knocked out\n* G = Average ratio of strength/levels between opponent's and player's Pokemon (equivalent to percentage likelihood of losing any given battle)\n* H = Average distance to closest Pokemon center (you will have to re-travel this distance every time you black out)\n* I = Shortest possible route through Kanto (in a perfect game)\n* J = Number of words spoken by each NPC\n* K = Number of non-trainer NPCs\n* L = Statistical likelihood of performing an unallowable move (start menu, using items at the wrong time, etc)\n* M = Number of Pokemon held by the player\n* N = Average number of instructions required to perform any action\n* O = Total size of Kanto\n* P = Likelihood of performing the correct action at any given moment\n* Q = Number of sentences spoken by each NPC\n* V = Total amount of time spent clicking through speech from NPCs\n* X = Total amount of time the player will spend in battle\n* Y = Total amount of time the theoretical player will spend traveling\n* Z = How many seconds it would take to complete a game of Pokemon Red with completely random input\n\nWe are looking to solve for Z = (W + X + Y) x 2L /P, so we need to first solve these equations:\n* W = ((C x G / M) + K) x Q\n* X = ((C x D) + (B x A x E x O) + (G x M x ((C x D) + (B x A x E)))) x F x M x G\n* Y = (A^2 x I) + ((H x A^2 x I) x G x M x ((C x D) + (B x A x E)))\n\nUnfortunately Google has let me down and I cannot find any of the actual numbers. There are simply too many variables to give an estimate, because if I miscalculate even one of them it will drastically change the whole equation. However, we can estimate at least some of these numbers, or put them in terms of each other in order to simplify the whole equation.\n\nThere are 7 allowable inputs: Start, A, B, Up, Down, Left, and Right. There are only 4 directions to move on the map. Therefore P = 1/7 and A = 1/4. I don't know how to calculate L, but based on what I've seen on TPP I'll call it 10%. My equation says 2L because you will need to perform the same number of actions to back out once you screw up.\n\nWe can assume the player's Pokemon will generally be on a slightly higher level than the opponent, so G is probably close to 1/2. The Pokemon attacks are skewed toward those that do little damage (one hit KOs do exist but they have low PP, and we have to account for non-damage moves like Sand Attach) so I'd estimate F = 4.\n\nM is going to equal 6 after only a small amount playtime, so let's pretend M = 6 throughout. Each trainer probably has 3 Pokemon on average so D = 3.\n\nI'd guess 50% of the map is tall grass or water so B = 1/2. Also, there are about a dozen towns and I assume each of them has a Pokemon center, so H=O/12.\n\nN is probably close to 2. Some actions take longer, such as selecting an individual item or Pokemon, but usually you just need to move a single space.\n\nNPCs usually say between 2 and 10 sentences, so let's say Q = 5.\n\nOur overall equation can now be written as:\nZ = (((C/12) + K) x 5) + (((C x 3) + (E x O)/8 + (3 x ((C x 3) + E/8))) x 12) + (I/8) + (((O x I) x 32 x ((C x 3) + (E/8)))) x (7/5)\n\nSo the real unknowns are C, E, I, K, and O. Since this is r/estimation, I'll take a stab at them:\n* O = 1,000x1,000 = 1,000,000\n* C = 500\n* E = 1/4\n* I = O / 100 = 10,000 steps\n* K = 100\n\nNow is when I start questioning my math, because I calculate that is approximately 448000630642 seconds. That's 14,206 years. TPP has almost finished, in approximately 14 days. So TPP is, according to my calculations, about 370,370 times faster than a random number generator.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393551829", "subreddit": "estimation", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

In ball golf all irons will be a little different but a 9 iron is a 9 iron. I do like the idea of having a bag of P M F D all suited to one particular skill level, and you could take it a step further and have M, M+, and M-. You could have a beginner level set of those and then a pro set where the pro M- would be drastically different than the beginner M-. I don't know. I like how they've simplified it but I do see how that system could limit them in the future as it leaves no room for discs in between their current ones. Maybe they're thinking they won't need any more. I like the pictures on Innova discs but they're not necessary. Look at lat64's gold line. The stamp is so simple and boring but people love 'em. I guess the uniqueness of the plastic helps with that. I just think that in end Prodigys goal was to move away from silly names and be more professional while at the same time simplifying the flight ratings.

If he/she starts playing a D minor chord now (the second chord in the harmonized Cmaj scale) and you are still starting and stopping on that 2nd note (D) then you're playing D Dorian. \n\nI wrote this and realized if you don't know it already I probably didn't simplify it at all. \n\nI think the best way to learn modes is to learn their intervals and then harmonize them. If someone is playing a vamp or one chord jam you can \"force\" any mode you want over it and the song will take on that characteristic. Or you can harmonize all the modes and see what chord progressions also yield each mode's characteristic. OR even better do both.\n\nI am more tired than I realized when I started this, feel free to PM with more questions, that goes for anyone.

{"body": "A definition of \"mode\" from my dictionary:\n\n    \"a way of operating or using a system\"\n\nSo for example, I have a camera.  It has loads unique functions and what I can do is put it into different modes, so sports mode to capture fast things, night mode to not get blurry pictures at night, flash mode to flash, portrait mode to take closeups.\n\nI.e. I can take all the functionality a camera has and with these modes arrange it in such a way I get something unique.\n\nScale modes are just the same.  So I have a scale lets say C major, its has the notes\n\n    C D E F G A B\n\n\nThey are just a bunch of notes, but I can now use them in different ways.  For example, picking a different root note.\n\n    C D E F G A B  = ionian\n    D F E G A B C  = dorian\n    E F G A B C D  = phrygian\n    etc\n\nI've named each mode there. But its just like the cameria, I've organised by basic set of functions / notes in different ways to create several unique things / modes.\n\nNow these all sound different because of the semitone gaps between E and F and B and C and that changes the structure of everything and how these notes relate to each other and harmonise.\n\nWhat I have said above is all well and good, but its not really helpful.  How to use them?\n\nLets use the Key of C and progressions C F G (I IV V).  C major is a scale that \"works\" over this all just fine.\n\nHowever, over the F and G it sounds lost and wrong, unless you really start tailoring and selecting what you play.  Some people have that natural ear, most like me dont, so I need help figuring that out.\n\nSo whats going on is those chords have both established new tonal centres, for example the F defines the F as the root / home sound of the chord.  So playing the root of C major, C, over the F wont sound homey or safe, it sounds tense.\n\nSo we know these notes can work, so we can shift the c major notes to fall in line with the chord / operate the scale in a different way by note selection / use the scale in a different \"mode\" as I would my camera for different situations.\n\nSo In C major and that key, F major would therefore mean we use C major but from the F, which is called F Lydian.\n\nSo over that progression I would use:\n\n    C major - C ionian\n    F major - F lydian\n    G major - G mixolydian\n\nI'm using all the same C major notes that relate to the key, however, over the different chords I'm aligning the notes of the scale I am using to match the chord and it makes it sound like it belongs.\n\nSo we can see how we take a major scale and use it in a modal fashion to fit in with a progression and make good sounds that are related to the chords.\n\nNow the question is what more can the modes tell us and how can we leverage it to make more good sounds?\n\nOne avenue is to too look back at the structure of the modes.  We are using Lydian, it has a structure\n\n    1 2 3 #4 5 6 7\n\nI.e. compared to the major scale it has this #4 as a different note.  This is unique to lydian, and therefore a defining characteristic.\n\nSo we can use that in our chord sequence,  Over the F chord we can play F lydian, we can focus on the chord tones as tey will harmonise well with the chord.  Then we can also play / focus on the #4 note which is the B.  This will sound awesome against the chord and you can get that sound anywhere else in the progression (well, without playing notes outside of the kay / c major).\n\nSo ionian the 3rd + 7th  are a nice notes, the mixolydian the 3rd and b7 are the note to play.\n\nI dont like the idea of a \"lydian\" progression. or something like that, makes no sense to me.  However, you can make a progression sound lydian, i.e. a lydian sounding progression.  If you take C major, use F as the home chord and then in the other chords try and show off the lydian notes, so that is reallt the F A B (root, third and #4).  \n\nSo non-theoretical explanation, take your major scale and play to the chords.  theoretical explaination you need to understand basics of keys, chord structure, chord naming, scale structure, progressions.\n\nI found a really good way to practice and here modes is by keeping the same root and changing key to suit. \n\nPick 1 position in the of the major scale you know.  For example A major from the 5th:\n\n    -----5---7---9-----\n    ---------7---9-----\n    -------6-7---9-----\n    -------6-7---9-----\n    -----5---7---9-----\n    -----5---7---9-----\n\nStay in that exact postiom, so between the 5th and 9th fret, then play:\n\n    A ionian (major scale) &gt; A lydian &gt; A ionian &gt; A mixolydian\n\nPay attention to what notes move and how they effect the sound. You may want to play just and down at forst, but you can start mixing it up / improvising a little more free in that position, when you do that try and get the sound of the mode you are playing to com out.  \n\nALWAYS stay in that poisiton, dont shift to a different position.  Doing that, you really hear + understand the 1 fret movement some notes have and how that contributes to the sound.\n\nThen do same thing in that position, but with the minors:\n\n    A aeolian (minor scale) &gt; A dorian &gt; A aeolian &gt; A phrygian\n\nThen link the two starting scales:\n\n  A ionian &gt; A aeolian\n\nThen just mix it up whatever really. So maybe\n\n  A ionian &gt; A mixolydian &gt; A dorian &gt; A lydian &gt; A phrygian \n\nIgnore locrian for now, the extra effort isnt worth it for now.  If you need to use it, arpeggios of the chord are good, very few musical situations will hang on that chord unless its particularly out there type music, in which case you need to build towards that first.\n\nChanging modes like this is really powerful, for example you will learn + hear what notes do what, what role they have.  Its really good when you start combining them you can start combining them.\n\nSo for example in that A position, play A ionian but play the #4 note of lydian and the b7 note of mixolydian. For example:\n\n    A ionian &gt; A lydian &gt; A mixolydian &gt; A lydian / mixolydian mix of ionian with the #4 + b7\n\nIf you can do the above exercise it will be easy, now you are playing A Lydianb7 with no real added effort.  \n\nMost people would struggle to learn that and have to learn a ton of positions / patterns but you dont actually have to do that if you learn how to take a base maj / min scale and modify it and essentially play to the chords.\n\nThis gets real handy when out of key notes are used within a progression, for example, say in the Key of C you get an Amin-maj7 chord.  In the key a Amin7th with the b7  is normal, so the 7th messes everything up / clashes.\n\nHowever, it doesnt really.  The A aeolian scale / mode would have been the one to use, what we can do is take A aeolian, but take its b7 note and just raise it a fret to a 7th to match the chord.  Its the same 7th we played on C ionian + F lydian, we know that note, so its not difficult to do.\n\nWith that \"A aeolian maj7\" scale we just created everything sounds really good, especially that 7th note really ties back nicely with the chord, which is awesome especially as we didnt really do much.\n\nWith a little encyclopedic knowledge, A aeolian with a 7th is actually A Harmonic minor, a very common scale, but we didnt have to learn all patterns and shapes or even know of it's existence, we derived it ourselves to fit a musical situation.\n\nI find its really cool to look at music like that.  Keys provide a group of safe notes + chords which is a foundation.  Staying within a key is cool, but you can also start including notes outside the key and massaging your expected scales/modes to match.\n\nChords really do form the foundation / base and for a lot of guitarists seem to be massively underrated.  Really, if you are playing respectfully to the chords and using the modes well, you should be able to hear the chord sequence + chord changes in what you play, otherwise what you are playing is essentially random.\n\nHope that made some sense.\n\nTL;DR play to the chords.\n\nedit: correct english, add bit about harmonic minor at the end", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393584643", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1t0gyg/modes_are_often_a_question_on_rguitar_so_i_tried):\n\nNOTE:  In order to understand the modes it's imperative that you understand the Harmonized Major Scale. In order to understand The Harmonized Major Scale you must understand the Major Scale and How Chords are Created.  \n\nIf you aren't familiar with these topics you should go read my two guides before even glancing at this guide.\n\n1.  [The Major Scale and How Chords are Created](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1oi69u/a_lot_of_people_here_have_been_asking_chord)\n\n2.  [The Harmonized Major Scale](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1p9bsj/my_guide_to_the_harmonized_major_scale_and_roman)\n\nThis is often the problem with people who can't grasp the modes.  They don't understand other music theory concepts that are necessary to know before diving into the modes.  It's a crawl before you walk thing.\n\n**1.  The Names and Notes of The Modes**\n\nThere are 7 modes and they have a specific order.  The order and names of the modes are:\n\n**1. Ionian**\n\n**2. Dorian**\n\n**3. Phrygian**\n\n**4. Lydian**\n\n**5. Mixolydian**\n\n**6. Aeolian**\n\n**7. Locrian**\n\nNow instead of using numbers, let's put the notes of the C Major scale next to each mode:\n\n**C - Ionian**\n\n**D - Dorian**\n\n**E - Phrygian**\n\n**F - Lydian**\n\n**G - Mixolydian**\n\n**A - Aeolian**\n\n**B - Locrian**\n\nSo here's the mind blower that people have a hard time wrapping their head around; *The notes for each of the above modes are exactly the same*.  \n\nYes, you read that right.  D Dorian has the same notes as B Locrian and the same notes as F Lydian and so on.  \n\nThe notes for each corresponding mode are as follows:\n\n**C - Ionian - C D E F G A B**\n\n**D - Dorian - D E F G A B C**\n\n**E - Phrygian - E F G A B C D**\n\n**F - Lydian - F G A B C D E**\n\n**G - Mixolydian - G A B C D E F**\n\n**A - Aeolian - A B C D E F G**\n\n**B - Locrian - B C D E F G A**\n\n*NOTE:  You will often hear something like \"The 5th mode of C major is G Mixolydian\" or \"The 2nd mode of C Major is D Dorian\".  This is important to remember for later.*\n\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**2.  Making Sense of the Modes**\n\nSo how do we differentiate between playing something in D Dorian or something in G Mixolydian if the notes are all the same?  Well, the answer lies in what's known as the *tonal center* of the music.  If we don't have a tonal center we can not clearly define what the notes we are playing are relative to.  \n\nIf you sit there on your guitar and just play the notes **A, C, F, F, B, C, D**, you could be playing any one of the above Modes.  But have a bass player play a steady D note or another guitar player play a D Minor chord and play those exact notes above, and you'll be definitively playing in the D Dorian mode. \n\nThe reason is because your ear is telling you that D is the tonal center of the music.  It's the note that everything you are hearing is relating to.\n\nThus, **without a defined tonal center, we can not define what mode we are in.**\n\nRob Chappers has an [excellent video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKbPIGnqt80) illustrating how important the tonal center is to defining what mode you are playing.\n\nBefore I go any further, I'd like to point out that tonal centers are often a subjective thing in music theory.  Some people hear songs differently and can make a case that one chord is stronger than another in a song and therefore that chord is the tonal center.  [Check out a discussion in /r/Musictheory on what's the tonal center of Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\".](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1lmp0y/daft_punks_get_lucky_reminds_me_that_the_dorian)  The song only has 4 chords in it but some people hear the song as having F&amp;#9839; Minor as the tonal center and others hear it as having B Minor as the tonal center.  Luckily, the majority of music has a pretty clearly defined tonal center.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n\n\n**3.  Modal Chord Progressions**\n\nAnd now we are back to the Harmonized Major Scale.  If we take the chords from our Harmonized Major Scale and really put an emphasis on one certain chord (i.e. Define a tonal center), we can create a Modal Chord Progression.\n\nLet's say we have the following chord progression:\n\n**C Major-F Major-G Major**\n\nWell, we know that these chords make up the **I, IV, and V** chords of the C Harmonized Major scale.  We can also clearly hear that the tonal center of this progression is the C Major chord.   If you don't believe me, play the progression and stop on the G Major chord.  You'll hear that it wants to resolve back to that C Major chord.\n\nSo with our tonal center clearly defined as a C major chord *and* all of the other chords in the progression fitting within the C Harmonized Major scale, we can say that this is a C Ionian progression or simply a C Major progression (Ionian is the fancy name for the major scale).  We could play lead guitar over this entire progression using the C Major scale and it would sound good.\n\nBut what about a progression like this:\n\n**G Major - F Major**\n\nG Major is the clear tonal center.  It wins the tonal center award by default for simply being the first chord to be played.  But there's a problem here...\n\nThat F Major chord doesn't jive with the G Major scale.  In fact, the note F doesn't appear in a G Major scale at all (G, A, B, C, D, E, F&amp;#9839;).  So what is going here?  What notes can I play over these two chords that will fit?\n\nWell, a keen eye will tell you that two major chords a whole step away from each other exist in the Harmonized Major Scale as the **V and IV** chords.  In this case G Major and F Major are the **V and IV** chords of the key of C.\n\nSo we know we can play all of the notes of the C Major scale over these two chords.  We also know that our tonal center is G Major.  And since the **V** chord of C Major is our tonal center, we know we are in G Mixolydian (Remember \"The 5th mode of C major is G Mixolydian\"?)\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n\n**4.  Well That Was Confusing**\n\nThe Modes are one of those things that seem very confusing at first but once it clicks in your head, you usually kick yourself for not understanding it much more easily.  The trick is to identify the chords and what the tonal center is.\n\nHere are some other examples:\n\nIn the song [Oye Como Va](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NsJ84YV1oA) by Santana, we have the following chords:\n\n**A Minor - D7**\n\nIf you look at the Harmonized Major Scale, you'll see that this corresponds to a:\n\n**ii - V**\n\nin the key of G Major.  Since we're playing the G Major scale over a chord progression that's tonal center is A Minor, we know we are playing in A Dorian (The 2nd mode of G major is A Dorian).\n\nIn the song [Fire on the Mountain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhEi7W1ib0) by The Grateful Dead, you have the following chords:\n\n**B - A**\n\nAgain, if you look at the Harmonized Major Scale, you'll see that this corresponds to a:\n\n**V - IV**\n\nin the key of E Major.  Since we are playing the E Major scale over a chord progression that's tonal center is B Major, we know we are playing in B Mixolydian (The 5th mode of E Major is B Mixolydian).\n\nIn the song [Dreams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrZRURcb1cM) by Fleetwood Mac, we have the following chords:\n\n**F - G**\n\nIf you look at the Harmonized Major Scale, you'll see that this corresponds to a:\n\n**IV - V**\n\nin the key of C Major.  Since we're playing the C Major scale over a chord progression that's tonal center is F Major, we know we are playing in F Lydian (The 4th mode of C major is F Lydian).\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**5.  Summary**\n\nThis is the way I learned to understand the theory behind the Modes.  There are other ways to attack the topic that may work better for some people than others.  For example, some people learn the modes by memorizing the intervals (e.g. Mixolydian = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;#9837;7, Locrian = 1, &amp;#9837;2 ,&amp;#9837; 3, 4, &amp;#9837;5, &amp;#9837;6, &amp;#9837;7).  This is useful to understand but, in my opinion, doesn't really explain *how* the modes are created or, more importantly, how and when you can get modal in your music.\n\nI hope this guide helps some of you.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393596952", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

For example a C major scale is as follows:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nIn order to change the mode you simply change the starting note.\n\n    C D E F G A B C - Ionian\n      D E F G A B C D - Dorian\n        E F G A B C D E - Phrygian\n          F G A B C D E F - Lydian\n            G A B C D E F G - Mixolydian\n              A B C D E F G A - Aeolian\n                B C D E F G A B - Locrian\n\nTo tab it out\n\n       -----------------------------------------------------------10--12--14---\n       -----------------------------------------------10--12--14---------------\n       ------------------------------------9--10--12---------------------------\n       -------------------------9--10--12--------------------------------------\n       --------------8--10--12-------------------------------------------------\n       ---8--10--12------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf we start on the 8th fret, we have a C major, or Ionian mode scale. If we star on the 10th fret, we had D Dorian, and so on. The reason the mode changes is because the intervals between the notes change. For example, If we start on the 12th fret, we have Phrygian, which has a flat second, and goes from E to F, a half step.\n\nAfter you get that refer to /u/EduardoCarrochio's post in this thread as he explains the intervallics of it well.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393597668", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
