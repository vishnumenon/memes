{"body": "**B E A S T I E   B O Y S**\n\nA lot of people give me shit for being so into these guys, but I gotta say, over the trajectory of their career, there's some great albums to be heard.  The Beasties put out a lot of EPs and collections, so I'm going to go through just the primary albums of their discography.\n\n\nAs the poster requested, I'm going through an album order that I would listen to for the Beasties.  \n\n\n\n**1. Check Your Head (1992)**  \n\nBeasties just before their prime, IMO.  Still fresh sounds that they were making themselves and goofy enough to still have fun with.  I had this tape in my car from 1996 on.  It got played every day.  My little brother was indoctrinated to this album in 5th grade.  Poor kid.\n\n\n* Funky Boss\n* Gratitude\n* So What'cha Want\n* Stand Together/POW\n\n\n**2. Ill Communication (1994)**\n\nAlmost a continuation of 'Check Your Head.'  More polished and on target.  Great mix of beats/source sounds/samples.  Most instrumentation by the BBoys.\n\n* Sure Shot\n* Root Down\n* Flute Loop\n* Shambala/Bodhisattva Vow\n\n\n**3. Paul's Boutique (1989)**\n\nPaul's Boutique is one of the most sample-heavy album made.  Produced by the Dust Brothers, it was just before the industry started cracking down on samplers.  As their sophomore album, it was nothing like 'Licensed to Ill,' and did not sell well.  It's been hailed as their best album despite this.\n\n* Shake Your Rump\n* High Plains Drifter\n* Shadrach\n* The Sounds of Science\n* Hello Brooklyn\n\n\n**4. Licensed to Ill (1986)**\n\nThe album that blew up three Jewish punk rockers turned rappers.  Produced by Rick Rubin.  Hilarious party bangers and anthems.  Teenage sexual angst and Brass Monkeys go with this album like your mom goes with my dick.\n\n* The New Style\n* Girls\n* Hold It Now, Hit It\n* Brass Monkey\n* Slow and Low\n\n\n**5. The in Sound from Way Out! (1996)**\n\nInstrumental compilation/review that will give you a good understanding of what types of instrumentation the three beasties like to play around with.  MCA is mostly bass, Adam Yauch is lead guitar, and Mike D plays drums.  A nice break from their 'standard' albums.\n\n* Groove Holmes\n* Namaste\n* POW\n\n\n**6. The Mix Up (2007)**\n\nLining this up right after their other instrumental album to transition into their 'new' sound.  Great groovy beats.  They did a 'Gala Tour' for this album where they only played in small venues for black tie audiences.  \n\n* 14th St. Break\n* Electric Worm\n* The Melee\n\n\n**7. Hello Nasty (1998)**\n\nThe long awaited follow-up to 'Ill Communication.'  A throwback to 'License to Ill' style rapping with brand new spaced out beats.  Very clean and differs in that it was created with primarily digital tools.  Changing from their old DJ, DJ Hurricane, to Mix Master Mike, this album has a completely different sound when compared to the standard instruments that were used in 'Check Your Head' and 'Ill Communication.'  \n\n* Remote Control\n* Intergalactic\n* Three MCs and One DJ\n* The Negotiation Limerick File\n* Dr. Lee, PhD\n\n\n**8. To The 5 Boroughs (2004)**\n\nThe second album to feature Mix Master Mike as their DJ, The Beasties bring it again this time.  Very focused on NYC and politics.  The lyrics are goofy, but generally very positive. You can start to hear MCA's voice go in this one.\n\n* Ch-Check It Out\n* Hey, Fuck You\n* The Brouhaha\n\n\n**9. Hot Sauce Committee Part Two (2011)**\n\nTheir last album...  A fitting one to end on.  Completely polished and just having fun.  At this point, MCA's voice is almost gone, having been diagnosed with salivary gland cancer in 2009...  He died the year following this album's release.  RIP MCA - Adam Yauch.\n\n* Make Some Noise\n* Too Many Rappers\n* Here's a Little Something for Ya\n\n^EDIT:typos/formatting", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393635344", "subreddit": "Music", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So basically everything works except stereo playback IN Pro Tools?\n\nYou need to go into your I/O set up in Pro Tools, and make sure all your inputs/outputs/busses are routed to where they need to be routed for stereo output. We don't necessarily know how your entire rig is routed, but it's safe to assume you need to hit Stereo on your C24 instead of 5.1 / alt / mono. Since you aren't working in 5.1 - you need to somehow make sure you're not running a L R C LFE Ls Rs (5.1) setup and are simply using L/R for stereo. I doubt that a single button press or command has changed this (as you stated what may be the issue), so this is probably not applicable, but worth checking out.\n\nGo to System Preferences, and find what your default audio output is. Since this output lets you hear audio through the board/monitors, this is the output bus that you need to route Pro Tools to.\n\nTry going to \"output\" in I/O set up, and make sure there is a blue checkmark beside the stereo output. At the bottom right of the I/O set up, there is also a \"default output bus\". Change that to whatever you saw in System Preferences as well. Then, go to the Bus window in I/O set up. There must be a bus that is linked to the output that you saw in System Preferences. If there isn't, you must create a new stereo path from the bottom left (New Path -&gt; change mono to stereo -&gt; create). Then make sure this output bus has both boxes checked so they're blue in both left and right columns.\n\nIt could also be your tracks in the actual Pro Tools session have their output routed to something else, or turned off. Change those to the same thing you saw in System Preferences as well, or the Pro Tools bus that works. Try them all if there's a bunch.\n\nThis is a problem that has so many variables that it's kind of hard to explain over text without being a massive wall of text. Since you're a student, I would suggest getting a prof or teacher to come get it set up or fixed. They'll probably figure it out in like 5 minutes opposed to you struggling, and then you'll know how to fix it for sure in the future.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393779948", "subreddit": "protools", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "sorry dude, what you got there is an incorrect version of the two middle voices.  Kinda fucked me up for a bit because it's actually two voices moving in parallel 4ths (sound fucked up).  The bass line is the fat ass synthy sound that's moving by whole notes (4 beats) for the first two bars.  I would suggest go for the bass line first, now that you know there are four voices.  \n\n\nBPM seems about right.  As for the top voice, \n\nf# g a d d d d e d \n\n\nAgain, a bit fucked up because there's goddam delay on that thing and I'm too stoned to tell which ones are real and wchich one's are delays (I feel like at least one for sure, but I'm preeeeety stoned right now so).  And then I just got lazy didn't figure out the rest :D\n\n\nI would go for the bass at first, because it seems the least problematic .  Then go for the melody.  Once you got the bass line, you can try to figure  some of the chords to make educated guesses as to what the super high notes are.  To get you started, I think it's in D major, with some b6 (Bb) and b7 (c) chords, along with some other chords.  For the two middle voices, try to figure out the higher one first, the lower one is exactly the same, only a fourth lower.  Good luck\n\n\nEDIT:  nice you're rhythm is correct, btw.

{"body": "This is a big topic. Answering this question would require some background info on music theory in general. I'll try to condense that as best as I can and also answer your question.\n\nIn the broadest sense, playing the changes means adjusting a certain sound during your improvised solo/fills/whatever to another according the chord changes that are happening. The question then becomes, What is the sound of a certain chord change in a given context to which you must adjust to? The first step, and the most practical answer, is getting into something called chord-scale relationships. But before we get into that, have some theory.\n\nDo you know what intervals are yet? If so, ignore the following paragraph.\n\nIntervals are the distance between two notes. Here in your chromatic scale, which is the scale embodying all the twelve notes used in Western music, you have C C#(Db) D D#(Eb) E F F#(Gb) G G#(Ab) A A#(Bb) B. The interval between each of those notes is a half step, or in \"interval terminology,\" a **minor second**. The interval between two notes if you were to skip one (e.g. C to D) would be a major second. Skip two and you have a minor third. Continuing with this skipping routine, your other interval names are: major third, perfect fourth, tritone, perfect fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, octave, minor ninth (above the octave), major ninth, etc.\n\nDo you know your modes and how scales are built yet? If so, ignore the following paragraph.\n\nTake your standard C major scale: C D E F G A B. Disregard the actual note names for now and think of the them as numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. The major scale is kinda the quintessential \"reference\" scale to which every other scale is compared to, and those numbers play a key role in that (I'll explain that in a bit). Observe the intervals between each note: 1 to 2 is a whole step, 2 to 3 is a whole step, 3 to 4 is a half step, etc. Now take the first note of your major scale and throw it at the end, so now you have D E F G A B C. The notes are the same as your C major scale, but the sound is completely different because the notes in the scale have a different relationship to the root of the scale, which at this point is no longer C, but D. When I say relationship to the root, I mean their intervals. Even though D to E is still (and will always be) a whole step apart, E to F a half step, etc., the sound is different because D is now 1, E is now 2, and F is now b3 (that's a flat, not a letter b). That b3 is an example of what I mean by having the major scale as the reference scale: it's b3 because it's a half step lower than the 3 in a major scale, or it's a minor third from the root as opposed to a major third. Anyway, do that rearranging thing for all of the notes and you get seven different scales, or \"modes\": Ionion (major), Dorian (that one that started on D mentioned above), Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (natural minor), and Locrian.\n\nDo you know how to build chords yet? If so, ignore the following paragraph.\n\nAs scales are defined by the intervalic relationships between the notes in the scale to their root, the same goes for chords. Except instead of counting 1 2 3 4..., we count in thirds, so 1 3 5 7 9...etc. Each type of chord has a formula to build it: major chords are 1 3 5, minors are 1 b3 5, diminished's are 1 b3 b5, and augmented's are 1 3 #5. Extend the chord types to incorporate 7ths and you have... Ma7: 1 3 5 7, 7: 1 3 5 b7, mi7: 1 b3 5 b7, mi7(b5), or half-diminished 7: 1 b3 b5 b7, and o7 (fully-diminished 7): 1 b3 b5 bb7. Obviously there are more, but those are the big ones.\n\nIf you wrote out the \"number formulas\" for your seven modes, you'll notice that the number formulas of these chords fit into certain modes; the Ma7 fits into Ionian and Lydian, mi7 fits into Dorian, Phrygian, and Aeolian, 7 fits into Mixolydian, and mi7(b5) fits into Locrian. Obviously there's a correlation, and this correlation is your introduction to chord-scale relationships. When musicians talk about chords in relation to a key or scale, we use Roman numerals. So rewriting the major scale now incorporating corresponding chords to their scale degrees, you have: I ii iii IV V vi viio; in minor (Aeolian), you would have i iio III vi v VI VII, and so on.\n\nLet's take a common progression in jazz: the IMa7-vimi7-iimi7-V7. To reiterate, a I-vi-ii-V in the key of C would be CMa7, Ami7, Dmi7, and G7. Notice how these chord roots are all in the key of C major, and chord qualities match the correlations illustrated earlier. Then, the most natural, \"at home\" sounding scales to play over these chords would be: C Ionian, A Aeolian, D Dorian, and G Mixolydian. Pretty easy, hey?\n\nHowever, when you encounter chords outside of the key, things get a little trickier. Let's say, D7 in a tune that's in the key of C. The F# in the chord doesn't belong in the key of C, as Dmi7 is the naturally occurring D chord in the key. D Dorian isn't your go-to scale anymore. So now we have to adjust. How you dictate the most \"natural\" sounding scale for an outside-the-key chord is you consider where the chord is going, and the key itself. Let's say the chord coming after the D7 is an G7 (I didn't pick this destination chord arbitrarily; read up on some more theory to find out why it's logical, and common). Lay out your chord tones: D F# A C, and G B D F. Now you already know the implied \"home\" scale of the G7 chord: G Mixolydian (as G7 the naturally occurring V chord in C).\nSo now you have D F# A C, and G A B C D E F. For a smooth transition, let's fill in the gaps of that implied D scale with as many notes from the G Mixo scale as possible, so you get a lot of notes in common: D E F# G A B C. D Mixolydian. Bam. The basics of finding out an implied scale/sound from a chord, or, as musicians calls it, chord-scale relationships.\n\nOf course, this only scratches the surface. Implied sounds aren't so black and white; D Mixolydian may be the most \"at home\" sounding scale to use over D7 in that given context, but it's not the only option. I'll stop here and let you process the information I just left. Obviously, if you have any questions regarding anything above or feel confident with what was covered and want to venture into more advanced territory, reply or PM me or something and I'll be glad to explain.\n\nAlso, the process is grueling at first, but if you keep doing it, and also learn about different musical devices writers love to use, you'll recognize patterns and this stuff will become second nature to you.\n\nEDIT: A mistake in one of the examples.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393826631", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The whole notion of repayment for sacrifice to the relationship is antiquated in this day and age.\n\nLet's say instead of raising kids, I sacrifice my education and instead spend five years trying to start a business or become an artist.  Should I still be entitled to spousal maintenance?  What if the business or my art is making tons of money?  I still sacrificed my education and a career, so I'm entitled right?  Wrong.\n\nThe basis in law for spousal maintenance (alimony) was that divorced women were considered by society to be used up, unemployable, and not marriage material.  Divorced older women really had nowhere to go and very few means to support themselves.  Spousal maintenance was a way to prevent society from having to support divorced women in poverty, much the same way child support is designed to prevent the state from having to support children when their parents are fully capable of doing so.  That's why alimony traditionally lasted until the woman remarried and why child support lasts until the children are adults.\n\nSo spousal maintenance makes sense in that world.  Cut to today, when women and elderly are fully capable of working in the workforce and there isn't any great stigma attached to being divorced.  Yet the law still handles divorce as though the outcome is likely to have one party living in poverty for the rest of their life unless supported by the other one.\n\nIf you (or any person) decides to stay at home with the kids, then guess what you got for that?  You got a lot of time to enjoy raising your children.  That was your choice.  We don't live in a world where roles are forced onto us and so we are therefore entitled to a leg up (a monthly stipend) because a role was forced on us that restricted our ability to grow into some idea of what potential we would have had if we had only made different choices.\n\nWomen (and men) that choose to stay at home are entitled to all the great memories of the time they did exactly wtf they wanted to do.

{"body": "Cuban jazz is generally just a mix between jazz (in any of its incarnations) and Afro-Cuban rhythms. Some of it is practically Afro-Cuban music with a slight jazz influence, and some of it is practically jazz with a Cuban style rhythm section. Since I assume you're coming to this from a jazz perspective, I'll assume you're familiar with that side of things and talk more about the traditional Cuban harmonies.\n\nAs far as Afro-Cuban tonality goes, it's generally either in standard major or harmonic/melodic minor. There's traditionally a very strong tonic/dominant relationship, with I IV V and i V V i progressions being common. Circle progressions and secondary dominants are also standard fare.\n\nMinor 6 chords are common variants for any minor chord (especially i), and tritone substitutions are not uncommon (bII7 instead of V7 or bVI7 instead of V7/V)\n\nAs others have mentioned, rhythm is one of the most important aspects of Afro-Cuban music. The biggest difference you'll notice coming from a jazz perspective is that traditional Cuban music is never swung, 8th notes are always even. \n\n[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/11m1jc/can_you_teach_me_something_about_rhythm_that_i/c6nzcos) is a post I made a while ago that goes in to more depth about how the clave works.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393893865", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Which quality makes the phonemic distinction? For example, if a speaker hears [ʃ], would they classify it as /ʒ/ because it is postalveolar, or /ʂ/ because it's voiceless?\n\nSyllable structure is governed by the [SSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonority_Sequencing_Principle). Your language looks to have a pattern like this:\n\np t k b d g &gt; f s š z ž m n &gt; v r l &gt; i &gt; ü u e ö o a\n\n/pra/ and /tva/ are formed by sounds from left to right so I'd expect they'd be allowable syllables. /kbe/ has 2 sounds from the same group so it's less likely to be a syllable. /rpo/ is probably prohibited because it goes backwards. However, /spa/ goes backwards too but is allowed, so the language isn't totally restrained to that order. Since codas only allow one sound, everything is allowed (except /x/, which I left off the chart).\n\nIt works the same for diphthongs too, which is why I found yours interesting. Usually, if a language has diphthongs, they will form based on the SSP, where the less sonorous vowels become the rising or falling part of the diphthong. Most languages group /i/ and /u/ as equally sonorous, so if you have /ai/ and /oi/, you'd expect /au/ and /ou/ also. However, the sonority scale for your language looks to isolate /i/ as being less sonorant that the other vowels, which is pretty unique!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1393952065", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Just like it's easier to remember five 5 digits #'s compared to a single 25 digit one\n\nTo memorize things you **need** solid sleep. It takes me 2-3 days of rest to truly memorize something long-term. It gets committed to long-term memory even if I do not play what I'm trying to memorize for the 2-3 days of rest, but that's just me.\n\nDo not practice for too long or play too many pieces if you want to memorize things, stick to one song at a time, do not move on in the song unless you really have the previous stuff down. Play slowly not just in tempo but actually physically move slowly and look at the keys and your hands while trying to memorize. Group things as well, if a song contains a plain C major scale for the love of god do not memorize it by C D E F G A B C, you only need to think and tell yourself \"play c major scale here\". It's all about chunking things together with as much context as you possibly can. Describe how the melodies move around the keys in every way you can. Like how wikipedia describes goldberg variation 23\n\n\"It begins with the hands chasing one another, as it were: the melodic line, initiated in the left hand with a sharp striking of the G above middle C, and then sliding down from the B one octave above to the F, is offset by the right hand, imitating the left at the same pitch, but a quaver late, for the first three bars, ending with a small flourish in the fourth:\"\n\nSo for the beginning of this variation you absolutely do not need to memorize the specific keys but rather understand what this paragraph means and how to execute it. You don't even need to look at the sheet music when you have a description like that and it's easier for your brain to \"get\" to boot (although simpler language would help). The beginning of this variation was the first thing I ever memorized simply because the context was easier to memorize than the notes\n\nIf you're memorizing the third bar after you've memorized the first two do not just play what you're trying to memorize. Move back and forth between just the third bar only and the whole song up to where you are trying to memorize. Play this section repeatedly and at every speed you can think of.\n\nCertain phrases and melodies will go by faster in terms of learning time if you begin your practice/memorization before the phrase begins rather than just saying bar X or this or that melody.

If you take a look at a key like C major you will notice that each note letter appears exactly once: C D E F G A B. This is a rule making things easier. Once you know the key, the note letter (without the accidentals) uniquely identifies a note, making reading sheet music easier. If you take a look at sheet music that stays within a key you will notice that the accidentals are written at the beginning of the tune once. This establishes the key and the note letter to pitch correspondence. The notes in the tune itself do not carry the accidentals each time.\n\nNow take a key like Eb major: Eb F G Ab Bb C D. This is the only way to spell it consistently if you add the second rule that the accidentals for a key only ever contain exclusively sharps or exclusively flats. \n\nTake the key of F# as another example: F# G# A# B C# D# E#.

If what you're saying is true, I'd be throwing support behind multiple candidates (some I may disagree with strongly) by way of ranked voting simply because the system gives accord to candidates who did not win but still ran.\n\nThe Act as it stands allows this in a far more perverse way FYI. It allows the use of bloc voting in multimember wards, and this was in fact the system that was in place for the Metro board pre-amalgamation.\n\nSuppose there are 5 councillors elected from the same ward.  Under the Act as it stands, you would get to vote 5 times, and each of those votes would be given equal weight.\n\nNow suppose that there are 6 candidates in the ward named candidate A, candidate B, candidate C, candidate D, candidate E, candidate F.  Suppose there are also 100 people casting ballots in the election.\n\nSuppose 20 voters have A as their first choice and candidates B C D E as their second, third, fourth and fifth choices.  So they vote for A B C D and E.\n\nSuppose another 20 voters have A as their first choice and candidates C D E and F as their second, third fourth and fifth choices.  So they vote for A C D E F.\n\nAnother 20 voters have A as their first choice and candidates B D E and F as their second, third, fourth and fifth choices.  So they vote A B D E F.\n\nAnother 20 voters have A as their first choice and candidates B C E and F as their second, third, fourth and fifth choices.  So they vote A B C E F.\n\nAnother 19 voters have A as their first choice and candidates B C D and F as their second, third, fourth and fifth choices.  So they vote A B C D F.\n\nAnother 20 voters have candidate B as their first choice and candidates C D E and F as their second, third, fourth and fifth choices.  They vote B C D E F.\n\n1 voter lives between candidates A and F and really doesn't like how long they leave their Christmas lights up late into January.  He thinks candidates B C D and E are alright though, so he votes B C D E and that's it.\n\nHere's how the votes break down:\n\nElected:\n\nB - 81 votes\nC - 81 votes\nD - 81 votes\nE - 81 votes\nF - 80 votes\n\nNote elected:\n\nA - 79 votes.\n\nSo here's a result where the first choice of 79% of voters fails to get elected, while the most hated candidate (candidate F) manages to get elected despite not being the first choice of even one voter.\n\nThat's a pretty extreme example, but even under real circumstances bloc voting (the name of this system) can have some pretty perverse results.  I'll go out on a limb here too and say that any system that has the first choice of 79% of voters losing is a bad system, and this system is allowed under the existing legislation in Ontario. In fact, this system is in use in Waterloo, Vancouver and parts of Montreal.\n\nI'll post a more direct response to your main question (re: what are the merits of this bill) in a separate thread, but I thought I'd just point out that the current legislation already allows exactly the situation you're concerned about. :/\n\nEdit: Hopefully no typos in that example, and hopefully it's fairly clear.

{"body": "Wasn't expecting a lot out of March, the only albums I had written down in my calender were the Freddie Gibbs + Madlib album, along with Atlas. But I've picked up a lot of great albums that I've enjoyed this week. \n\n**[The Hotelier - Home, Like Noplace Is There](http://thehotelyear.bandcamp.com/album/home-like-noplace-is-there)**\n\nAlways been a bit weak for this kind of alternative/emo-ish type of rock. Absolutely loved **Whenever, If Ever** by The World Is A Beautiful Place from last year, and it easily cracked my top 10. This is a really strong contender for my favorite album of March. It's simple, and catchy, and I've had the chorus from **[The Scope Of All This Rebuilding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hsqkia_S8E)** on my mind ever since I heard it. Pitchfork gave it an 8.2, definitely worth checking out. \n\n**[Real Estate - Atlas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gSE2NK8SDQ)**\n\nBeen listening a bit to this album aswell. I'm enjoying it but there isn't that much to it. There's some really good songs on here, like the singles **[Talking Backwards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgsdblVq8wo)** and **Crime**, but there's not really a lot of reason to listen to this album for more than 20 minutes at a time. It gets a bit tiring for me. Still a solid album, and I'll definitely come back to it once Spring comes. \n\n**[Pharrell Williams - G I R L](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM)**\n\nVery little talk about this album, haven't seen it mentioned outside of /r/hhh and some reviews here. One of the biggest daily papers reviewed it today in Sweden and gave it a one. The critic said that Pharrell ruined Get Lucky, and his dumb lyrics made the album the trash it was. I really disagree, even if I don't think the album is stronger than a five at a scale to ten. The production on G I R L is actually really good, even if it gets a bit repetitive, and while the songs just all feel like radio-hits, some of them are really good at being just that. I really liked Happy, it's catchy as dicks, and it's optimisim is really infectious, but my favorite track is probably **[Brand New](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pwOGbnlD5Q)**.\n\nAs for singles, the latest **[Perfect Pussy](https://soundcloud.com/capturedtracks/interference-fits)** single's got me crazy hyped for the debut. Loved the demo-EP from last year, and I was one of my most played songs of the year. Also the **Cloud Nothings** album that drops in April is looking like it might turn out really good. \n\nBeen a busy week and topping it of with seeing Danny Brown this Friday, and Darkside at Sunday, stoked!

{"body": "Hey man I've been playing him and practicing him alot lately, as suggested watch replays that helped me alot. I think the best to look at would be qojqva (he also plays offlane tinker sometimes) and Chains who's a SEA legend on tinker http://dotabuff.com/players/61061435\n\nI used to play laser/rocket tinker and it helps alot with kills early on but you will find that around the 10 to 20min period you farm like shit because your march isn't maxed. I now try how qoj and chains build it which is Q E E W E R E and it has worked much better. I also tend to only pick him when im Radiant because I stack the ancients for myself every minute 3 or 4 times in the first 5min allowing me to get BoT's around 8min even if I had shit last hits.\n\nI go to lane with tango 2 branches and ring of regen, should get soul ring at around 2min and boots at 4. I don't go bottle because I don't spam rockets, I just use laser from time to time to last hit or harass, or 1 march or 2 if enemy is getting agressive. Having your soul ring when you hit level 6 is key! Once you have it, go farm your ancients, you should have your boTs by then or be really close. Once you have your bots farm lanes and go help team in skirmishes if you see you can help, get bottle next and then probably one of the 3 core items on tinker, get your blink!. If you have all of this at 12 min you're golden.\n\nWith blink bots and march 4 you should be able to push and farm very vast and bottle helps you regen faster in fountain. I then suggest getting dagon and getting ult level 2 once you have it. If you are stomping get dagon 5, if you're having a hard time, stop at dagon 2 or 3 and then get your hex, you absolutely need it. Once you have your ultimate orb or mystic staff you can probably afford getting 3rd point in ulti. Once you have hex and dagon is when the fun really starts, see someone in lane? tp blink hex dagon rcket laser refresh rince and repeat until dead. If you see a team fight, blink to the sides, spam 1 or 2 marches + rockets then burst enemies down. The key to tinker is positioning so when you go in a fight or farm a lane be sure to always blink somewhere after each refresh so you don't get stunned. \n\nOnce you have these items it's up to you really, if there is an enemy with a stun like Lion or w/e i like to get linkens and sell bottle for it, if I'm doing really well I get bloodstone, if you are staying in teamfights alot get bkb. \n\nLike I said this is mostly for the pushy/global farming tinker which I feel is the safest build. If you go full laser/rockets and you don't snowball hard, odds are you are going to fall behind alot on items and that's no good.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394050255", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is one of the more convincing explanations I have found:\n\n&gt;  \"E.T.A. Santiago 17:45. STENDEC\"\n\n&gt;That was the last message received from Star Dust, sent by Radio Officer Dennis Harmer at 17:41 on 2nd August 1947.\n\n&gt;The Chilean radio operator in Santiago said the reception was clear, but the message was sent rather quickly, so she asked for it to be repeated...twice. The message was believed to be the same on all three occasions.\n\n&gt;Clearly, if the crew believed they were only minutes away from Santiago, the radio officer would have been keen to complete that final morse message so he could make voice contact with the controller at Los Cerrillos airport. Therefore it is no surprise that the message was sent rather quickly.\n\n&gt;There have been many suggestions over the years as to what was meant by Dennis Harmer’s message that day, as it clearly was not intended to be STENDEC. Some of the theories are totally implausible. A popular one is that STENDEC is an anagram of DESCENT and the letters were re-arranged due to Harmer suffering from the effects of hypoxia. A person suffering hypoxia is unlikely to make the same mistake consistently three times in succession and is very unlikely to create an anagram of the intended word. Furthermore, a normal message would not be expected to consist of the single word 'descent'.\n\n&gt;We have asked many former aircrew for their views on STENDEC and several have said they believe there is a very simple explanation. This is as follows .....\n\n&gt;The actual Morse code which the Chilean Operator believed she received was:\n\n&gt;S    T        E        N       D       E        C\n\n&gt;…    _         .         _.      _..       .       _._.\n\n&gt;A recognized signoff or 'end of message' signal was 'AR' (with no space between the letters). Therefore a standard signoff would be sent as the Morse '._._.' in other words 'EC' without the space. If the messages from Star Dust were sent quickly it is quite conceivable that spaces were misinterpreted. A common message at the time was \"Standard Arrival\" followed by the direction from which the aircraft was arriving, so in this case if we simply shift a couple of spaces from 'STENDEC' we are left with 'S T A R E AR' or STandard/ARrival/East/signoff:\n\n&gt;S    T        A       R        E        AR\n\n&gt;…    _        ._      ._.        .        ._._.\n\n&gt;It is impossible now to know for sure what Dennis Harmer intended his final message to mean. It was almost certainly not STENDEC. Even though the discovery of the wreckage of Star Dust helped us to understand the events of that day in 1947, the word STENDEC will always be a subject for debate.\n\n[source](http://www.flywiththestars.co.uk/Documents/STENDEC.htm), thanks to u/tomhirst69", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394077643", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 87, "controversiality": 0}

Anyways we turn off the lights and light up some candles. At first it was nothing for a while. \n\nThen a guy randomly calls my buddy who was with us, he hears what we are doing and rushes over. He said he had used them before and was certain it would work. He comes over and he was so confident that it would work that we all got kind of a second wind about it. Sure enough it starts working. Most of it was not scary. We were talking to a little girl who said she liked our my roomates cats. Her spelling was terrible. The random dude leaves like 10 mins later (never saw him before that and never again after that)\n\nThen we start asking questions I found out later that you are not supposed to ask. Mostly about death. The little girl had done the leaving gesture. At this point it was just me and my friend matt touching the pointer and we asked it- Who in the room would die first?

His name is Matt and mine is Mark and really slowly it went M-A (im thinking oh shit) - R and then C and instantly I felt relief thinking to myself HaHa i spell my name with a K.

I have even asked him again at the bar one night and it had been like 3 or 4 years he still swears he wasn't. I don't think he would keep a joke like that going this long. \n\nBut who knows.

{"body": "Putting a couple of points into E is always good early game. I usually skill up in this order: E W E W E R then start maxing q. With two points in E at level 3 (150 dmg) and using it on an enemy champ forces them to use a health pot (unless they have someone to heal/shield the damage). Like other people have said in the replies your attack speed steroid doesn't really apply until you get damage, which usually happens around mid game/after level 6.\n\nHope this helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394128749", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "So, i'm currently in my second read through of the series, but this was my first time reading TWTTK. I was fascinated by the message at the end which shows a couple of sentences written in high speech and their translation. the message, from [Roland's mother, says \"I forgive you everything. Can you forgive me?\"] (/spoiler).\nI started solving it like a cryptogram and found that the literal translation was [\"I forgive ou everting. can ou forgive me?\"](/spoiler)\nTherefore, i had constructed at least part of the High Speech alphabet. It is the same alphabet that we use to write 'Unfound'. I did some research and found that the font King used for this is called [Hoefler Text Fleurons](http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/features/hoefler-text-arabesques-patterns/) (guess how many letters that has ;D )\nFrom the books, only about 14 letters of the alphabet can be found, but i added some more to round off the language.\nThe current High Speech alphabet contains the letters: A C D E F G CH I K L M N O R S T U V W\n\nObviously, we can't be expected to draw all those convoluted symbols every time, so i'm developing a shorthand version. (That can be seen in the fourth image).\nIt's not really ready yet, and this isn't a guide to writing in High Speech (as i'm still learning it myself), But i wanted everyone's feedback with what i've got so far.\n\nDid-a-chum Dad-a-chater, I'll see you all later!\n~ConstantlyTodash", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394129819", "subreddit": "TheDarkTower", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If he's not able to control himself and put YOU FIRST in a scene then he's a danger to you, your relationship, your physical wellbeing, your mental welfare, and emotional health.\n\nHe's right though, being a dom/top/master *is* a hard thing.  But it's just as hard being a sub/bottom/slave!  He gets no points for inexperience.\n\nDon't you DARE \"promise\" away sex for safety!  That's rape.  No other way to think about it.  I don't use the word \"rape\" much since consent is one of those nebulous things in BDSM and in the world in general, but this is pretty cut and dry in my eyes.\n\nHe's given you nothing but red flags here and now is trying to emotionally blackmail you into keeping him around so he can CONTINUE to act this way to you.  \n\nRun, don't walk, away.  Call his family/friends/a doctor/therapist/cops on your way out the door.

{"body": "I didn't start until I had my programming class in college. But where I really started learning scripting and messing around with things was putting Arch Linux on my computer with bspwm as my window manager and sxhkd as my keybind manager. Want to customize your window editor? Open the file and code it in! Want to make a new keybind? Edit the script! I coded my own script for linux that I bound to f3, it toggles between hiding+disabling the cursor and re-enabling+unhiding the cursor. Very useful on a laptop with a bitchy trackpad driver.  Took me three days to get it working how I wanted it to.\n\nI also had to program my f1 and f2 to raise/lower brightness correctly. I had to write scripts to make my volume on/off up/down media keys work. I had to write the code to display all the information in my (menu)bar. Time, cpu temperature, day, wireless strength, battery %, wireless network, all of that.\n\nOf course, I borrowed code from others, and put it together, but it took a long time to get everything how I wanted it to. When absolutely everything has to be written/configured, and it's all through the terminal/text editor, you'd be surprised how much code-fu you pick up. I can barely stand GUI file browsers anymore, as the terminal is more comfortable for me. Love my grep and awk.\n\nIf I were to suggest to someone how to start coding, I would probably suggest to them to check out [this list of books](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list). And then get the ones that sound interesting to you. Anything (relevant) written by the creator of C++ (bjarne) is a must have, in my opinion. \n\nRead through 'em. But don't just read. Do. All the examples, type them out long-hand if they interest you. Try to understand how it works rather than just reading and go \"mmhmm yeah I get that\". If anything interests you, find out more about it, try to code something of your own. Experiment. Download random small \"applications\" (super small example programs of 500-1500 lines of code, really. More commonly known as coding exercises) and then break them apart, dissect them, have fun playing with them.\n\nI once spent 10 hours attempting to make a exercise that outputted a c++ binary tree in a list (a b c d e ...) into it's literal 2D implementation using setw function, and other stuff like that. I had to google the crap out of that code and had a blast making it work.\n\nYou don't learn without doing, and you (like me) get distracted far too easily to sit down and \"study through the language\" like you would in school. So make it fun, do it however you want, just do it and don't let it sit by the wayside like I did.\n\nI also found learning vim to be really fun, and it was also a great way to get into scripting since the vimrc is like, the most customizable file on the planet Earth.\n\nDoing dumb challenges for the hell of it can also be fun. Like saying \"I'm going to use nothing but the tty for 3 days and I'm going to browse the internet by curling every page I wanna visit, piping the output to a pager/text editor, and then casting the data to null when I'm done.\" I'd bet money you'd be a hell of a lot better with the curl function after 3 days.\n\nJust have fun with it, that's probably the most important part.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394174423", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Partiye gidip geldiğim sıralarda, benim ne işle meşgul olduğumu sordu, bende bir iş yapmadığımı Emekli olduğumu iş bulursam çalışabileceğimi söyledim. Bunun üzerine kendisi bana bir teklifte bulunarak , İCRATÜRK adında bir internet sitesi olduğunu ve burada kendisinin Ücretli üye olduğunu yine bu stede adamlarının olduğunu onlarında yardımlarıyla Motorsiklet ve Araba alım satım işi yaptığını söyleyerek, eger paran varsa seninlede bu işi yapabiliriz dedi. Bende bunun üzerine bir düşünmem gerektiğini söyledim.\n\nTekraren ve ısrarla bunun düşünecek bir tarafı yok, herşey gayet açık ve net, sen artık partili üyemizde oldun, bende yanlış yapacak  bir kişi olsam, “HEPAR” gibi bir siyasi partinin İlçe başkanlığını yaptırmazlar tarzında ve Siyasi nüfusunuda kullanarak beni inandırmıştır. Seninle ve kendi aramızda birde sözleşme yaparız ve Ticaret yaparak para kazanırız dedi. Bunun üzerine Parti binasındaki  Bilgisayardan  05/07/2012  tarihli sözleşmeyi hazırladı. Ve bana  bahsettigi steye üyelik için  3.000 Dolar karşılığı  5.400 TL ve alınacak  arabanın yarı bedeli olan 8.000 Tl yi hemen getir ve  yazılan sözleşmeyi İmza altına alalım  ve ben bu steye arabanın alımı için hemen onay göndereyim dedi. Alınacak olan arabanın Tescilide benim üzerime yapılacağı için, Aynı gün içerisinde FİNANSBANK tan 14.000  bin TL kredi çektim. 13.400 Tl sini, dilekçe eklerinde sunacağım sözleşme şartlarına göre Parti Teşkilatı içerisinde  Burhan KARABAĞ’ a teslim ettim.\n\nTüm bu işlemleri yaptıktan sonra, bahsettiği gibi üyesi olduğu İCRATÜRK isimli internet stesine 05/07/2012 Tarihinde ONAY gönderip  Aracın alınması ve adıma Tescil edilmesi gerekiyordu, Çünkü alınacak olan araç belliydi  ve Bilgisayardan bana gösterilmişti bunu yapmayıp bir sorun olduğunu o stedeki işlerini takip eden arkadaşlarına ulaşamadığını dolayısıyla yarın bu işi yaparız demek suretiyle beni Parti teşkilatından göndermiştir. Birgün sonra ise başka bir araç alınacağından bahsetti, benimde kendisine olan güven duygum tamamen sarsılmıştı işlem yapılamadı 3. Gün ise hal ve hareketlerinden, tavır ve davranışlarından’da  şüphelenmeye başladım.  Kendisi hakkında kulağıma birtakım bilgilerde gelmesi  üzerine,  Burhan KARABAĞ’ı  telden  aradım ve yanına giderek  benim  bu işten vaz geçtigimi, herhangi bir Araç alımı  işide olmadığı için verdiğim parayı geri vermesini istedim. Ve oda bunu kabul etti, sözleşme şartlarına göre  3.000 Doları 3 ay sonra geri alırsın,  kalan  8.000 TL sini  ise görüştüğümüz haftanın içerisinde Çarşamba veya Perşembe günü alırsın dedi. Bende bunu çaresiz kabul etmek zorunda kaldım. Ancak vadettiği günler gelip geçmesine rağmen herhangi bir ödeme yapmadığı için şüphelerim daha çok arttı, bunun üzerine      (Cumhuriyet Başsavcılıgı Sahtecilik ve Dolandırıcılık Bürosuna  12/07/2012 tarihinde müracat ederek şikayette bulundum. 2012/41440 Tarih sayı numaralı Dosyası kapsamında yapılan soruşturmasında ve alınan 26/07/2012 Tarihindeki Polis ifadesinde aramızdaki sözleşmeyi kabul ettiğini, sözleşme şartlarına uyarak paramı geri vereceğini beyan ettiği için, Sayın Savcılık makamı bu olayı  HUKUKİ  ihtilaf olarak değerlendirip 07/09/2012 Tarihinde takipsizlik kararı vermiştir.)\n\n26/07/2012 Tarihinde Antalya 16.

{"body": "That's not really *the* answer.. but it does touch upon the troubling phenomenon of how money and value work in an economy. So since it's the top comment I'll expand. Hopefully my background in economics will help. Note that I am simplifying a lot here.... it's ELI5 after all.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The problem does not lie in the fact that people create value \"out of thin air\" like /u/strangedigital suggests - it's always been like that. That's why money was invented - so that people would have something concrete, tangible and physical to trade against. If you did not trade or invest using proper money (precious metals or something of equivalent value) then your investment was immediately categorized as risky or unsound or simply suspicious. That changed with the introduction of government-mandated currencies(legal tender laws), banknotes (paper money) and most importantly [fractional reserve banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking) which legalized to full extent the notion that you can trade or invest having N O     M O N E Y except for the few percent required for reserve...  and still use legally binding values denominated in the currency being legal tender as if you just used legitimate and real money. That mixed up the \"sound\" portion of the market where all transactions had backing in physical money and the \"unsound\" speculative portion of the market where all kinds of risky or shady deals were conducted. In effect those regulations artificially elevated the range of those unsound practices to the level of your ordinary money-backed trade and that made them artificially profitable but did not remove the risks. Because you CAN NOT LEGISLATE AROUND LAWS OF ECONOMICS**\n\nSo it wasn't so much that there \"was no money\" because such transaction always existed, will exist and *should* exist - but that those transactions had the same weight and legal power under law as your regular transaction where you see the money - and in 1929 preferably in gold.  It's like pension funds and the stock market...it should be allowed but it should *not* be encouraged by write-offs, tax breaks and other legal tricks to funnel more pension money into the stock market.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow some more detail:\n\nMoney is a product of the market - an universally accepted *physical* good - which is used as measuring rod to help exchange other goods of varying value. It works that if you have some apples and someone has oranges and you want to trade but can't agree to how much for how much you think how much are both apples and oranges worth to you in terms of money. Historically it was a valuable commodity such as gold, silver, tobacco, alcohol which was treated just as any other commodity - by quantity. A pound of apples was worth an ounce of tobacco which was worth two pounds of oranges. There - here's your price system - the value formula for this particular transaction. That's how money came about - through numerous transactions which resulted in people choosing one particular commodity to use as the standard of value to appraise any other commodity.\n\nOver time as money production developed money grew into specific forms called currency which were named (dollar, pound, shilling, krona) and quantized by assigning an amount of currency to an amount of money commodity ( quarter of ounce of silver per krona for example). That allowed people to determine value in abstract units with some link to commodity which defined value of money (gold,silver etc). Slowly instead of an ounce of silver for pound of apples people started paying four kronas (quarter of an ounce per krona) for a pound of apples. It also allowed for expansion of money supply without the use of the commodity because if you can imagine how much gold or silver is your house worth you can imagine how much dollars or shillings your house is worth.  That led to growth in value for value exchanges which used money as unit of currency/value but without the use of physical money. There were legal developments that made it possible which ultimately evolved into the fractional reserve system and central banks as lenders of last resort but the legal nature is not important right now. \n\nWhat is important is that progressively into XX century people were making more and more complicated transactions - not only trading apples for oranges but stocks for treasury bills, mortgages for long term deposits etc etc while at the same time no physical money was being traded. Although many people thought it was in a sense - metaphorically - in fact it wasn't *at all* - once the value of money was expressed in currency units and not the quantity of specie or other monetary commodity nobody (well...few people) bothered to check if the [8banknote of the bank of england promising to pay the bearer the sum of 5 pounds*](http://www.peterboroughaccountants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/5-pound-note.jpg) (most likely in gold - check the top of the banknote just under \"Bank of england\") had some backing in gold or not. Definitely not the banks which gained most from such practices through credit expansion.Therefore a large portion of transactions was conducted using the currency as measurement but without it physically being present to ensure that all values checked out. \n\nThis led to a problem once the scenario /u/strangedigital mentioned. Say you want to buy goods worth $50k but have no money only a house worth $100k of current market value. You could go to the bank and get a loan for $50k with your house as collateral. So let's say you have arranged for the goods to be delivered and plan on going to the bank tomorrow to sign the papers and pick up the check.  Overnight the value of your house collapses due to an unexpected market crash. Now the best you can get for the house is $25k but the goods are arriving in the afternoon and you'll still get the bill for $50k. Now both you and whoever sold you the goods are screwed. That's how economic \"bust\" works in real life.\n\nThat was the most basic instance. If you realize that complicated accounting gets involved and money can be moved around to create funds from illiquid assets just by moving them around the books then you begin to see how large the problem can become since you do not need to have physical money backing up all transactions. That's the greatest problem with fractional reserve - as long as you meet reserve obligations the money you use for transactions can be a make-believe amount. If everything checks out - then there's no problem - after all all transactions are just a more refined barter. But if anything is wrong on either side...well that's where it becomes a problem because then everybody wants to see *real money* instead of promises, papers, loans, guarantees... And there's simply not enough of them to cover all transactions.There was not enough long before the Great Depression begun but in the roaring 20's trust was high and nobody wanted to see too much money. Once it stopped however everyone wanted to see the money....and the hole became deeper and deeper and deeper.\n\nSo the TL;DR would simply read:  \"because there was no money to begin with\" but it's sounds ridiculous...hence this short...well not so short explanation. If you have any further questions ask away. \n\nEDIT: Second paragraph.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394217020", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That may be true in modern times but it has not always been the case.  It is true that watches were originally made to be worn primarily as jewelry but this was because they were inaccurate and mechanically problematic.\n\nHowever, watches were *so damn cool* that a lot of time and effort was invested into improving their functionality.  Let's be honest though, it wasn't the watches that were so damn cool, it was the boat loads of money that could be made by decreasing the production costs.  Some smart guys managed to begin \"mass producing\" those suckahs in the 19th century.  These guys were like the Larry Page and Greg McLemore of the good ole' days!  Okay, maybe not that one guy.\n\nThese debonair watch-making-gods managed to take a once bulky complex device that was encased in a big wooden box and shrink it down to fit on *your wrist*.  There is only one thing more amazing about this moment than the watch itself: to the surprise of everyone, the pioneers of watchmaking *weren't* put to death for witchcraft.\n\nSo, you are probably wondering at this point, what the hell does this have to do with whether a watch is a gadget or a piece of damn jewelry?  The answer to that question is: E V E R Y T H I N G.  The watch wasn't only being worn by aristocrats, rats, and the President.  No, everyone needed one these examples of pure American ingenuity.  Don't let those pikey piss-artist Brits try to take credit for what the big red, white, and blue did.  Yeah, they were producing a few watches here and there but they didn't manage to put a watch on almost every wrist of every person to ever have been born.  These things became so widely worn that it actually became common to dig up your dead relatives and ensure that they weren't without a wristwatch.\n\nThe wristwatch, neckwatch, armwatch, legwatch, and even cockwatch had its time as a piece of jewelry and as a gadget.  These wrist leaches didn't really take off until America made them an essential apparatus of every farmer, businessman, coal miner, and nagging spouse.  It was easier than ever to ensure that your spouse's brother *and*/or sister was out of the house with enough time to remove the stains of poor performance from the sheets.  Hell, if the wristwatch didn't take the world by storm then you may not be here - how else would your great great grandfather have so easily known he had time to finish the deed and leave his seed?  The wrist watch is *directly* responsible for the love child that you now know as grandpa.\n\nToday we may have forgotten the position of gadgetry glory that our wristwatches once occupied but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394231889", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

As far as the growing number of businesses- yes and no. Take a few moments to read through the article that I linked and you will see what I am talking about. Essentially they state that the trend of US firms moving in to China is starting to reverse, with many of those firms returning back to a US base for their manufacturing. I imagine that when 3d printing really starts to become affordable that trend is only going to accelerate.\n\n&gt;As for that article you presented...it says that \"a growing number of american companies\" are coming back yet spends the biggest percentage saying how \"higher wadges in China will not drive businesses out\" due to their super effective supply chain and so on and so on.\nDo you truly believe that over the past decade the West created a more welcome and fertile environment for investments and businesses? Come the fuck on.\n\nProbably because everything is relative.

{"body": "I want you to imagine a keyboard or just to look at one. You'll notice how all the keys are arranged 'chromatically' meaning that as you go from left to right, each one is a semitone higher than the last. As you go from right to left, each one is a semitone lower. \n\nNow there are certain intervals that you get by playing any two notes. The different words we use to describe intervals refer to the notes positions on the major or minor scale.\nFor example, C to E is a major third. E is the third note on the C major scale. In the C minor scale, the third note is Eb meaning that playing C and then Eb would be a minor third.. Getting it? Now in both major and minor scales, the fourth note and fifth note are the same (go try it out. C major has F and G on the 4th and 5th positions and so does C minor) these intervals are called 'perfect' fourths or fifths. The circle of fifths is what happens when you play a note, then play the fifth interval from that notes scale, then play the fifth interval from THAT notes scale and so on. Instead of trying to work out each scale though, you can just go up 7 semitones each time. So the pattern starting from C would go\n\nC G D A E B Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F and then back to C\n\nTry not to think about octaves so much and just focus on the notes.\n\nThe cool thing about this is when you reverse the order, you get the circle of fourths. C F Bb Eb Ab and so on.\n\nSo as you work your way up an accordion you get the circle of fifths, and as you work your way back down, you get the circle of fourths.\n\nThe bass side of an accordion is (usually) laid out in this way so that you can access the chords most important to you in the scale you are playing in. In most simple polka and folk tunes, the three most important chords are the tonic (the chord built on note one), the sub dominant (chord four) and the dominant (chord five.) on a piano you would need to move your hands up or down 7 semitones to get these chords but on the accordion, these chords are all right next to each other.. \n\nDo you follow?\nI hope that helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394241940", "subreddit": "Accordion", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some time ago, I posted a thread here about a \"transparent\" DAC, and /u/OJNeg suggested I try a NOS DAC. To be exact he said \"*Look into NOS DACs if you're tired of the artificial sound that most delta-sigma DACs have*\"\n\nI researched NOS sound, and didn't know what to make of it -- essentially NOS dacs have no output filtering, and typically run a TDA1543 chip, which is an \"antique\" monolithic dual 16 bit DAC that came out in 1991, I believe. For those interested, more about NOS theory [here] (http://www.sakurasystems.com/articles/Kusunoki.html). \n\nI was curious, and got one. I'll post a detailed review after a month or so of listening, but here are first impressions. Product web page for the Pro-Ject DAC Box S FL is [here] (http://box-designs.com/main.php?prod=dacboxsfl). \n\n**First look**: Spartan looking. Good build quality. It's small but heavy for its size. Offers digital or coax in, but no USB. Powered by a wallwart.\n\n**the guts**: The \"NOS\" stands for no over sampling.  Unlike conventional delta sigma dacs, there is no oversampling, and no output filtering (which you have to do with oversampling because of the harmonic distortions it produces at ultrasonic frequencies). \n\nConversion is at the native data rate so whatever is the data rate from the source is what you get -- no upsampling!  In theory running four 16bit/44.1kHz TDA chips in parallel sounds crazy, and shouldn't the sound be completely distorted if there are no filters? You would think so, but put quite simply, this DAC works. \n\nIn essence the DAC circuit is comprised of four TDA1543 chips, WIMA output capacitors, and not much else. No output filters whatsoever. No digital filters. No analog filters. Nada. The circuit board only occupies a portion of the tiny enclosure, and the 4 Philips chips are hidden by a (relatively) large heatsink.\n\n**The sound**: This is not a neutral DAC by any standards. I would characterize it as having warm rich mids with vocals pushed forward, ***very*** detailed bass all the way down the spectrum, and with smooth highs which do exhibit some blurring and smearing that impacts high-frequency definition but in a pleasing way. \n\nVocals are particularly strong. Vocalists sound rich and lush. Classical music shines particularly well as well, with rich timbre and an extraordinary level of detail. I listened to some fado after a long time (I can't speak Portuguese but fado is amazingly beautiful stuff) and  there was so much detail in Mariza's 'Concerto em Lisboa' it  became an immersive experience -- there is one point in one of her songs where she is overcome by the tune and the emotional content of the lyrics and breaks down, taking a minute or two to compose herself and before she can continue, the guitar and audience help her out. The separation and soundstage at that point was absolutely stellar -- everything was crystal clear and distinct, the vivid notes of the portuguese guitar and the fretwork, the applause from the audience projected across the soundstage, *even Mariza softly sobbing in the background*! which sent a chill down my spine. Not even the DAC1 can do this.\n\nWhere does the Box S FL fail? Well, it has no USB in, for starters. And while the bass is deep and rich and precise and detailed, the upper end is a little smeared, and the mids sound a tad over-bright with electronica.\n\nI'm working my way through Wagner's Ring Cycle right now, and classical is equally rich and open, and while I'm not a phono fanatic, it all sounds very layered and, well, retro, like the source was analog phono, not a flac file.\n\ntl;dr: this is a rich, bright DAC. Probably not suitable as a primary DAC, and not a good choice for folks who want their DACs to be transparent, but a great (and different) addition to my collection. I love it. Thank you /u/OJNeg.

{"body": "Well, there's an easy way to do it, but it only works sometimes.  When you play, listen for the tonic.  That's the note or chord that feels like \"home\".  That's the root of your key.  Then, figure out which are the most important other notes, and that's your scale.  For example, you're playing a piece and keep resolving your melodies to E, so the piece is in E.  The other important notes are F, G, A, B, C, D.  That makes it E phrygian (minor b2).\n\nThere are several problems with this approach.  The first is that the tonic may change, and it might change *often*.  The second is that the other notes might change, and they might change *often*.  The third is that there may be no note that feels like home, or several notes that have similar pull, or a variety of other things.\n\nThe solution to these problems is simple: in those cases, there's no key, or the key changes, or the scale changes.  If you can't figure out what key it is, give some strong consideration to the possibility that the key is ambiguous.\n\nFinally, when you use sheet music, the key signature *lies*.  If I were writing music in C mixolydian -- C major with a Bb instead of B -- I'd use the normal blank C major key signature and simply mark every B as Bb.  When I write in D dorian, which is D E F G A B C, I use the D minor key signature and natural every B.  When I write in D ahavah rabbah (phrygian dominant), D Eb F# G A Bb C, I use the D minor key signature and mark every Eb and F#.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394344740", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It'll be a really neat project!\n\nLooks like you've done a pretty good job finishing (i.e. going under at least 3 stitches on the back) and starting.

If I end up with no loop at the end (i.e. I've used the thread for another group of stitches, but still have enough for more in a different area) I generally make half a stitch (a /), then when I start the second /, I make sure that the tail end of the thread is underneath the vertical bar on the back. Let me know if that doesn't make any sense, and I'll make sure to find pictures or something to show it.\nI'm not sure what other people do, but what I like to do is if there is a patch of the same colour like on the tail, I'll generally try to make it so that I only have thread traveling one or two squares on the back. That hopefully minimizes the amount of thread that is overlapping on the back like the tail does. \n\nEveryone has their own method: I work in rows, but in a weird way that I like to do all the / / / /  in one row, then do / / / in the row underneath and so on until I've done most of the / / / in an area, then I go back and make that area all X X X X X, instead of making each row separately. I'm not sure how common that is, but I find that it keeps the back of my project much neater (again, I can show you what I mean if you are interested).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394399503", "subreddit": "CrossStitch", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The ascii table is a way of \"translating\" what numeric value has been used to represent a letter/character.  See this:  http://asciitable.com\n\nThe computer can only understand numbers, so the ascii is the numerical representation of the character.  So, 'a' is actually 97 under the hood.\n\nThe formula shown in the pset\n\n    c = (p + k)%26\n\nis a way to change the letter by manipulating the underlying number.  But it's been simplified because it assumes that you have first converted your letters such that 'A' is 0 (or 'a' is 0), rather than 'A' (65) or 'a' (97).  I think it is confusing that they give you that formula without explaining that bit.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that because chars are actually numbers, you can do arithmetic on them.\n\nLet's say that the character you want to change (p) is 'd'   (d is 100 in ascii) and your key is 6\n\n    c = ('d' + 6) % 26   \n\nBut to use this formula, we need to make 'd' be within the range of 0 to 25, so we first need to subtract 'a' from 'd'.  Can you see why?  Afterwards, we then add 'a' back to the answer to get the actual letter ascii value.\n\n    c = ( ('d' + 6) - 'a' )%26  ) + 'a'\n      = ( (106) - 97)%26 + 97\n      = ( 9 )%26  + 97\n      =  9 + 97\n      = 106\n\nIf we then print that, we'd get 'j'    This makes sense, because if you start at 'd' and move 6 along in the alphabet:  d e f g h i j\n\nCan you see how that works?  -Brenda.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394428247", "subreddit": "cs50", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

The command is displayed in gray and who wrote the command gets their name on top.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, it's anarchy with accountability and visibility. There's nothing democratic about it because it doesn't choose the option with most votes, and even if it did democracy has problems with 1-2 commands delay while this is a steady 80 commands delay depending on lag. Like anarchy can get a pseudo-democracy going if more people type the right direction, drowning out inputs that go against it, this does the same by them having a higher chance of being pulled out of the hat every 0.5 seconds.\n\nSo, what else is different about this anarchy? Mainly two things, movement and start spam.\n\nMovement is no longer two commands to turn+walk, you walk in one command even if you're facing in the wrong direction. This leads to smoother movement. This also means that ledges become more difficult, since it no longer needs two consecutive down commands to jump off one, a single down is enough.\n\nStart spam is reduced because it doesn't accept all commands that normally don't cause an animation. If we're standing still and input b a a b start, b a a b does nothing and start has a 100% chance of being activated (I don't know how fast the emulator is, if it can accept multiple inputs in the same frame and/or how many frames need to be between each input that doesn't cause any animation for all to be registered). In the current system, start would have a 20% chance of being used.

{"body": "My usual username, Starline, is the eight-letter string with the most English anagrams. That username was taken on reddit, so I shuffled some letters around and picked Linearts. The word \"starline\" is sort of an inside joke among competitive Scrabble players. (I sometimes get asked on AllIsBrawl or Pokemon Showdown if I play Scrabble, but I pretend I don't know what they're talking about.) It's a mnemonic for remembering the letters a e i l n r s t which are important for some word tricks. For example, try this simple technique the next time you play: if you can play a word that scores 30 points or more, do it, but if you can't, then don't use your tiles that have one of those letters on them. By saving them for the following turn instead of wasting them on a mediocre word, you drastically increase the probability that you will be able to play a high-scoring word next time. Unfortunately you'll score a bit lower on the turns where you have to save the letters instead of using them immediately, but don't worry, you'll score much higher overall by the end of the game. The difference between good scrabble players and people who don't play competitively isn't just that the pros know more words - you could literally give the average casual Scrabble player a _huge_ advantage by letting them look words up in an electronic dictionary or even allowing them to pick whatever tiles they want out of the bag instead of drawing randomly, and they'd _still_ lose to a good player, who'd beat them with any number of advanced techniques like tile management or word positioning or a dozen others.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394472690", "subreddit": "smashbros", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You're very squishy in cougar form, so it should generally only be used as an execute, or if you're 100% sure you won't be focused and just want to do as much dps as possible. \n\nEarly game ganking a nid lane is generally pretty pointless unless the enemy is really pushed up without wards, and you have a good ganking jungler. (If you have lee/elise and they're an ahri pushing without wards or something, then maybe you can blow flash, but other then that it's pretty hopeless.) The lack of any burst or cc means pre 6 you just wanna survive and poke with spears through the wave.\n\nOnce you hit 6 you get a huge power spike, as I mentioned in a response further down, your w e q combo is really really damaging early on.\n&gt;At level 6 her cougar form w -&gt; e -&gt; q combo does (before resists obv) 275 + 1.0 ap magic damage, and at least 200 more physical (often more if they're low.) That plus ignite is generally a kill on anyone who is sub 50% hp.\n\nSo at this point if you ever land a mid range spear through the wave then r w e q ignite is often just straight up a kill, or at least flash blown.\n\nWhen you roam cougar form damage is also really powerful, running to a lane in cougar (and going through bushes on the way for passive ms boost) lets you get there much faster then most mids. Then you generally want to try and throw a spear at long range, either before they see you, or lead them as they're retreating, so they either have to dodge back away from their tower, or get him, then just cougar form and w -&gt; e -&gt; q onto them. Combined with your top/bot lane's burst and cc it's often just an easy oneshot kill.\n\nAlso when taking blue, the rotation of human q -&gt; heal -&gt; cougar form -&gt; w e q -&gt; human form, q, heal, cougar form, w e q  etc lets you take blues solo from level 6 really easily without taking much damage, so you don't rely in your jungler.\n\nIn mid to lategame teamfights you generally have to be really careful about when you cougar. There are probably 3 main situations where i'd go into cougar form. \n\n1. I see someone who i know i can burst (tank sub 10%, squishy sub 40%) with my cougar combo nearby, and he's isolated enough that i can r w e q without getting caught. This happens a lot more then you'd think, as people really underestimate nida's burst when spear is on cooldown, and they'll often chase you into situations where you can heal yourself, spear them then r w e q and kill them. (a combo which takes about 1s max to execute fully.)\n2. A member of their team, who can't solo burst you, is isolated/diving. Say a vi or renek or something dives your adc, while the rest of your team is fighting their team half a screen away. Since you know that they can't burst you down, and you know if they turn onto you the adc will just kill them before they kill you, throwing a spear at them then going in cougar form to burst them rather then just running back to try and throw more spears can often save your adc's life and get an easy kill.\n3. The team catches someone, then the objective is just to burst that person down asap, so just spear -&gt; cougar -&gt; weq for max burst.\n\nYour teamfighting as nida is basically spears + heals onto your adc (for attack speed) or whoever needs it to not die, and whenever you see a chance to cougar form someone without risking death, do it, because in close quarters cougar burst does a lot more dps then spears to, and if you can use cougar spells during your spear cd, that's even better.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394617352", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The command is displayed in gray and who wrote the command gets their name on top.\n&gt;\n&gt;For all intents and purposes, it's anarchy with accountability and visibility. There's nothing democratic about it because it doesn't choose the option with most votes, and even if it did democracy has problems with 1-2 commands delay while this is a steady 80 commands delay depending on lag. Like anarchy can get a pseudo-democracy going if more people type the right direction, drowning out inputs that go against it, this does the same by them having a higher chance of being pulled out of the hat every 0.5 seconds.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, what else is different about this anarchy? Mainly two things, movement and start spam.\n&gt;\n&gt;Movement is no longer two commands to turn+walk, you walk in one command even if you're facing in the wrong direction. This leads to smoother movement. This also means that ledges become more difficult, since it no longer needs two consecutive down commands to jump off one, a single down is enough.\n&gt;\n&gt;Start spam is reduced because it doesn't accept all commands that normally don't cause an animation. If we're standing still and input b a a b start, b a a b does nothing and start has a 100% chance of being activated (I don't know how fast the emulator is, if it can accept multiple inputs in the same frame and/or how many frames need to be between each input that doesn't cause any animation for all to be registered). In the current system, start would have a 20% chance of being used. Of course if it's the only input in the 0.5 second window, it gets used as any other command would.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394639023", "subreddit": "twitchplayspokemon", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Although I am strongly of the opinion that it doesn't matter what a developer could create, it would still never quite meet our expectations. As gamers we can't very often align what we imagine the design and development process to be with what it actually entails, and so we think that adding in X or Y is as easy as just goddamn doing it... but in fact the development process is a long, miserable, awkward juggling act, and if you do add in X then you have to change A B C D etc to accommodate it, which in turn might compromise a whole series of other things.\n\nIt's difficult for us to properly conceive of, because it all sounds just so darned logical to us that it should be easy to implement what we are asking for.

{"body": "I really don't feel like sugar coating this, so I won't. I've heard a lot about Deafheaven's Sunbather the past few months but hadn't  looked into it until now. I think the reason people dislike it is because it's taking elements of American black metal, and putting them together in a shittier way then a lot of other bands out right now.  Being that American BM is currently my favorite genre, which has really been building up over the past few years, it really sucks to see some great fucking artists like [Panopticon](http://thetruepanopticon.bandcamp.com/) and [Wolves in the Throne Room](http://wolvesinthethroneroom.bandcamp.com/) (who basically created the style these guys are imitating) still be very unknown. \n\nAlso, to address your fourth point, this is black metal we're talking about.  Half of the genre is presentation, namely in the form of your cover art.  Not only do the colors and such clash with the BM norm, it's pretty fucking boring to look at. S U N B A T H E R. Kinda makes it hard to go into that open minded for the average metal fan.  \n\nAnother point is the lyrics. I just glanced at the albums lyrics on MA, but at least the first half of the album seemed to have pretty whiny lyrics, typical of general metalcore type music. The two bands I mentioned above, like most American black metal, have very strong messages that they hope to convey to their listeners, usually about nature (Panopticon's newest album was actually about the coal mining industries irreversible affects on the ecology of the Appalachian mountains).\n\nTo sum this up, the metal community rarely likes a band like this becoming big, especially if they feel the band is less than average compared to others in the genre.  I listened to most of the album while typing this post, and have been thoroughly unimpressed. As I said, it's a little upsetting considering the amount of recognition they've received compared to the greats.  Someone in this thread said that one of the albums acoustic numbers brought them to tears by how beautiful it was (not that their's anything wrong with that) which lead me to believe that the song would blow me away, but it didn't really stack up to most if not all of the atmospheric black metal I've heard before.\n\n**However, its no excuse for the shitty stuff that was shown in the photo you posted**. I agree people get a little to worked up over this shit. I checked /r/metal and people were claiming that Deafheaven wasn't even black metal, which is I'd say is bull shit.\n\nSorry for the rant, and like I said, I didn't feel like searching for the words to make this seem nicer, so call me an asshole or an elitist if you so choose. And on a more positive note, if Deafheaven gets more people into my favorite little niche of metal, then I guess that's not a bad thing at all.\n\nP.S. your post did in fact make me cringe, so have an upvote", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394764175", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

For my \"brain food\", I had a giant (and I mean...like 4 pounds of the stuff) bag filled with jelly beans and chocolate covered raisins and things like Skittles and M&amp;Ms. I ate about a pounds worth before I crashed big time...with my face right in the middle of my text book. I think I slept for about 3 hours in that position.\n\nSo I wake up, realize what happened, and then realize that I'm now 15 minutes late to class - the exam has already started. So I haul butt to the class and get there, and sure enough, everybody was there, heads down working on the exam. The room was dead quiet but everyone in that room seemed ultra pissed that I was disrespecting them by showing up late. I could FEEL the tension.  \n\nI go to get the exam from the teacher and I get the evil eye of death - his eyes where saying to me - \"how dare you show up late....but I'll give you this one big break in life\".  \n\nClearly, EVERYONE in that room wanted to kill me...at least that's how it felt. \n\nSo as I walk down the aisle of chairs looking for an open seat, I go to swing my shoulder bag over my head, wasting no time to get ready for the big exam, and completely forgetting that I still had about 3 pounds of the mixed candy brain food in my bag. \n\nAnd...well...upside down the bag went and out came 3 pounds of \"brain food\" - it all dumped out and went E V E R Y W H E R E. \n\nLike a giant sack of marbles being let loose all at once. One loud explosion followed by thousands of bits of candies bouncing off of the legs of the chairs of people. \n\nI prayed to god for a burst of room filled laughter...but no one moved or said anything. The tension only got worse. I just wanted to die. \n\nThen...making it all worse, as each student finished their exam they had to walk up to front of the class by stepping over and around the spray pattern of crap all over the floor. Most didn't make it without failing to see a Skittle or M&amp;M, followed by a crunching sound and then a whisper of \"shit\" going off. Some people even kicked them off to the side to make it more of a point as to what I had done to them. \n\nNeedless to say, I think I failed that exam as well. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394814396", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Of what I'm currently doing at work? I'm working on a finite element software that calculates the flow of temperature in 2D regions. The temperature in a region is described by a set of partial differential equations that can be approximated using the finite element method. The whole calculation involves several steps, some of them are mandatory, some are purely for efficiency.\n\nIn general, you're given a system with a boundary polygon (or a set of these) and a set of loads. The first step is to create a good mesh out of that polygon. This is also the hardest part (in my opinion of course) and it is what I'm currently working on. Right now I'm busy optimizing the mesh such that it provides a good basis for the numeric calculations that are then done on it. The output of that mesh generator is then a mixed mesh which can contain triangles as well as quadrilateral elements.\n\nFor the purpose of calculation, we're really interested in which knots are connected to which other knots. The actual solving is then done on a (kinda sorta) adjacency matrix. The problem here is, that this matrix can be really really big. Consider a mesh with 10^5 knots. We'd end up with a matrix a magnitude of 10^10 elements. Using floats, this amounts to roughly 37GB of data (it's actually more than that, because we need to consider both spatial dimensions in the matrix, hence blowing it up by a factor of 2). Since this happens to be a sparse matrix, you can store it as a band matrix (i.e. instead of storing a n x n square matrix, you store a n x b matrix, where b is the bandwidth, from which you can fully reconstruct the original one), given that you can number the knots in a way, such that the bandwidth is small. When done correctly, this saves a tremendous amount of space and also allows you to adapt the solver such that it is *much* faster. The problem with this is, that bandwidth optimization is NP-hard and it's been proven that there is no approximation algorithm. However, there are a few heuristics (Cuthill-McKee for instance) that work rather well in most cases.\n\nAfter that, the actual system of linear equations is set up from the problem definition and the mesh. This system is then solved by a linear equations solver -- the one that I've mentioned in the other post.\n\nThere's also a whole lot of other stuff going on around this \"core\" of the program. The input is text-based, hence there is a need for a parser. That's still a whole lot less work to write than a graphical interface for input though (especially since writing parsers in Haskell is like a walk in the park), and once the engineers get used to the format, they're usually more productive with it. At least, that's been our experience in the company.\n\nResults have to be presented in a way that makes sense. Since the resulting data sets can become quite big, they require smarter data structures to be stored in than just arrays and lists. For instance, to display isolines over the region to indicate the temperature, interval trees are used for fast lookups.\n\nMy personal projects are much much simpler and there's really not much more to be said about them than what I already wrote. The spring simulation was just something I came up with on a sunday afternoon. It's basically a solver employing an Euler Method in order to simulate a system of interconnected springs. The front-end was written with Xlib and cairo and was really minimal. You could drag the endpoints of springs around and then watch them snap back into place and stuff. I think the whole front-end code was less than 250 lines of C code.\n\nThe CMS was a little more serious. I got myself a Linode server to host my own emails because I decided that Google already had enough of my data. So I thought about running a small blog and had a look at the performance of popular blog systems and decided that it was abysmal and that I could improve on that; Mainly because I didn't need 90% of the features that they offered. So I started coding something up in C. It utilizes FastCGI to interface with the web server and SQLite as a DBMS. There's a caching scheme inbetween the database and the (very minimal) template engine, that provides roughly a 10x speed-up over the SQLite queries, once the posts have been fetched for the first time. For a simple template and some example posts, performance peaked at around 240k requests per second when running in standalone, i.e. without a FastCGI connection to a web server, so I was definitely a lot faster than the PHP based systems (not very surprising). However, it turned out that the web servers I tried were quite a bottleneck (down to around 1500 to 2000 requests per second). Or I just suck at setting up webservers. However, I ended up deciding that I didn't want a blog after all and now it's just lying around in some directory on my hard drive.\n\n***\n\nTL;DR: I'm writing FEM software for temperature flow in 2D regions.

So if you wanted a G major scale, you'd look at what notes are in that key, and then use that to build chords. G A B C D E F# G would be a G major scale. Take the third and fifth and you have G B D, or a G major chord. \nNow, chords have formulas too. They tell you what the intervals are in the chords, because its not always the same. A major chord is 1-3-5. A minor chord is 1-b3-5, because those are the intervals in a minor scale. So if we stay in G, we would get G-Bb-D as a G minor chord, because we took the G major chord and just flattened the third.

{"body": "More to the point - he chose 107 nPr 10 as the number of distinct hero matchups. This ignores the fact that an identical combination of heros is essentially the same team - that is to say, it's not a different team because blue plays puck and teal plays lion compared to blue plays lion and teal plays puck if all the other color/heros are the same, for example. This means he overcounts the potential meaningful number of matchups by 120 * 120 (5 nPr 5 * 5 nPr 5 for the number of possible permutations of radiant and dire teams). This assumes that a team of heros A B C D E on radiant vs F G H I J on dire is different than F G H I J radiant and A B C D E dire (if you want to take that assumption out, divide by two). The real number of meaningfully distinct matchups should be  [8,854,617,997,445,220](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28107+nPr+10%29+%2F+%28%285+nPr+5%29*%285+nPr+5%29%29&amp;a=*C.nPr-_*InfixFunctionOperator-) in my opinion. \n\nSimilarly, in the estimate of the number of matchups to duplication, the ignorance of the [Birthday Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) means the estimate is substantially misleading. The matchid for DotA 2 is around 563672400 currently, as far as I can tell. The chances of NOT having ANY duplication after that number of matches is approximately 1.615086265156014e-08  as far as I can tell - that's assuming all hero picks are random chance evenly distributed, which is a huge assumption that is certainly wrong (clustering effects from a metagame, hero combinations and counters, etc would cause the probability of seeing the same team lineups twice to rise substantially). \n\nExample matlab code to find chances of duplication of lineup over many games:\n\n    clc; clear all\n    nMax     = 563672400; \n    prevPnot = 1; %initialize probability\n    combos=8854617997445220;\n\n    for iN = 1:nMax\n        Pnot     = prevPnot*(combos-iN+1)/combos; \n        prevPnot = Pnot;\n    end\n\n    disp(Pnot)\n\n(the returned probability is the chance that there will be NO duplication in lineup over 563672400 distinct games). Therefore, saying 'no two DotA 2 matches are similar to each other' is mathematically a lie - though the similar statement - 'your chance as an individual player of seeing the exact same lineup twice in 20,000 games of AR play is about one in 44,275,302' is pretty persuasive so from the perspective of an individual player it's not all that important. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394902178", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Seems like a shake down. They definitely weren't removing anything out of fear.\n\n7. cloudflare.com -- this is a reverse proxy / pass through network, primarily to defeat DDoS attacks.  They are used by 4chan.org, anonib.com, etc).  They 'hide' the IP address of the actual hosting website, but will reveal the IP/datacenter if you present them with a valid DMCA request.  An interesting issue is that under DMCA pass-through-networks then need to block access on their network.  Cloudflare.com does ~not~ do that step and ignores questions about why they don't.  This would be an interesting area for anti-revenge-porn-lawyers to focus on. :)\n\n(edit: fixed typos)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394933757", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "alright just downloaded it, going to give my first impressions.\n\n**Elevators:** nice beat. I love how Chuck can make such a simplistic beat as good as complex ones. Chuck's raps are a bit average but I still love him. this feels really different, I like the hook. very nice and smooth. Buddy's verse is OK, his voice kinda reminds me of a deeper voiced E-40. the flow was nice. Really feeling Polyester's verse, I like it. That flow is nice, that autotune effect was nice, not intrusive or annoying or forced at all. \n\n**Swervin:** nice beat, again. Simplistic but good. It drowns out Chuck a bit but it's so good it's not much of a problem. That hook is good, catchy. Sir Michael Rocks still rocks, can't wait for more Cool Kids. I love Mikey so much. That flow, that delivery, everything. Polyester's verse is fire, shiiiiit. I love it. Gonna have to check this dude out, for sure. Flow is on point, rhymes were great, etc.\n\n**Legs:** Already listened to this 100x but I love it. Chromeo on the hook &gt;. I honestly prefer this to anything on R.A.M and even on G I R L tbh, besides Happy. Really funky, easy to dance to. Chuck kills his verse, I really like his delivery. Idk why, but it's addicting to listen to. Chuck kills every verse on this song tbh. The production on this is insanely good. Chuck is in my top 10 producers tbh, hella slept on and underrated. I could see someone like Chance or Vic on this track for a remix, easily. Tokyo Shawn would be perfect on it, too. Andre 3k could fit over it really well, too. \n\n**Came Thru/Easily:** Came out a long time ago on one of his other EPs, dope song. One of my favorite Soulo and Mac verses. Flow and lyrics on point for the entire song. Everyone kills it. Beat is great, again. Chuck is just too good. One of Chuck's best verses, too.\n\n**Attitude:** That beat is fucking insane. sounds straight out of the fuckin dungeons of rap. This could be a Mobb Deep instrumental, basically. Chuck fucking kills it. Holy shit. I think this might be the best Chuck verse I've heard yet. BJ on hook still killing it. Love his hooks. Chuck kills 2nd verse. This beat is sooo nasty, I love it. BJ's hook on this beat seems so unconventional but it works so well for some reason. That beat change tho... sounds like something from the Tron soundtrack, really nice.\n\n**Mas o Menos:** ooh I like this. this beat is nice. That sample works well. This track is really weird, but I like it. Feeling this the least out of all the songs so far, but I still really like it. This Chuck verse is great, too. This album is gonna be so slept on and underrated it's not even funny. Oh shit this spanish feature, wasn't expecting this. Dope. Was hoping for a full verse but that little part was too nice.\n\n**Money Clip:** this beat. Sounds really nice, almost like G-Funk but not quite G-Funk. Chuck verse is too nice. I'm really enjoying the samples used in this album so far, they work really well. That hook is catchy. 2nd verse feature is niiiiice. Kinda reminds me of MC Eiht in a way, can't explain it. Really nice though, rides the beat really well and his flow is nice. That part near the end is great. I like this hook's beat change. Oh shit, this 3rd verse is really nice. Not sure who this is but they kill it. Really nice. That transition was nice. Sulaiman! Killin it, fuuuuuuck. Sulaiman is severely slept on, really. Loved his verse on Pinata but this verse is just fuckin' insane. Love it. Vic's verse starts, says what we're all thinking \"Chuck on his old school\". Really nice Vic verse, he has such a vast number of flows it's insane.\n\n**Prism:** Really weird beat, that guitar solo is nice. Jade has a nice voice, I'm feeling this. Really funky. Feels airy, but still satisfying in a weird way. I don't know how to explain it. Chuck is going kinda experimental and I love it. Chuck's verse was OK, I liked the flow. Definitely feeling this beat + hook, for sure. Real nice. Dammmn this beat change is too nice. Funky as fuck. Really nice. Jade + this beat on the change is soooooo niiiiice wow. Really feeling this. I'm really enjoying this song more than I thought I was going to when it started. I feel like this 2nd half of the song is a lot better than the 1st. That guitar solo is nice, too. Fits surprisingly well.\n\n**Game Time:** FUUUUCK this is great. This beat is too nice. I think this is one of Bronsolino's best verses so far, I love it. That transition from Bronson -&gt; Chuck is too good, and this Chuck verse is amazing goddamn. I love it. I think this album is some of Chuck's best work yet and I can't wait for Shark Week now.\n\n**Hurt You Back:** This feels futuristic as shit, and really unique. Chuck starts with a killer verse. I'm really enjoying that \"pew\" sound in the background. Synths are too nice. This Chuck verse thoo... then Benny Cassette on the hook? IDK who she is but I love this. Feels really nice. Unless Benny's the guy in the hook, can't tell. Chuck's gotten a lot better at rapping since Bake Sale and shit. Really feeling this 2nd verse. Flow is nice. That singing is too nice. This breakdown with the subtle guitar in the background is super nice. Really spacey vibe from this part of the song, I like it. \n\n**Dream:** Nice beat so far. I like the chimes. That harp... wow. This beat feels like heaven. Chuck rides this beat really well. I like this... I think it's picking up pace? I'm pretty sure it is. The beat is heaven but the lyrics are far from heavenly in subject, I love it. I had a dream on the low, that this album would not be underrated.\n\n**Glam:** Was looking forward to this song hardcore, already heard it, but I love it so much. The singing by Macie Stewart is heavenly af and that guitar completes it soo well. Nico Segal on trumpets is too good. I'm pretty sure this is featuring the entirety of Social Experiment. That piano. The beat's drowning out Chuck a bit but I like it. The hook is soooo positive, I love it. Chance's singing is so good and it's unexpected. God loves all my niggas. NiggIGH. Chance been killing every verse recently, this verse is sooooo good. His flow is so bouncy it's crazy, I love him. Chance sing-rapping and it's soo nice. Social Experiment is nice on this track, for real. The guitar and drums on this track are really nice, too. Macie's singing is just heavenly, tho. Makes the track.\n\nOverall: 9/10, summer as fuck. Really nice album. Chuck's best work probably. Features all killed it, hyped for Shark Week. That one Sir Michael Rocks feature is making me thirsty af for this next Cool Kids joint.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394934250", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well most of the statements made have some degree of ineptitude, but my biggest gripe is this statement:\n\n\n&gt; Your DNA acts as a construction foreman: It calls up specific amino acids, directs their deployment, and assigns their roles\n\nThis is not what DNA does. A better analogy, using the construction worker theme, is that DNA is the blueprint, and amino acids/peptides are the nails, beams, tools, radios, hard hats, and even construction workers. \n\nMost of your DNA acts as nothing more than an instruction booklet for WHICH amino acid to use. \n\nDNA is like a book, written using only 4 letters of the alphabet. ATCG. So a stretch of your DNA might look like this \n\nGATTACATATCGGGCTAATCTTACCAAAATCGGAATCCATACGCGATTACA.\n\nProtein, on the other hand, is like a machine. This \"machine\" is made of amino acids, of which there are 20 in humans (and ~25 in all of life on earth.) So a sample protein might look like this \n\nL H I G L I L P K S E S I R S I R L V I Stop S S V W I P I L V R L A R\n\nIf there's anything in your cell that acts as a construction foreman, calling up specific amino acids, directing their deployment, and assigning their roles, it's the RIBOSOME. The ribosome is like a freak hybrid. It is made of both protein and RNA, is much much larger than a typical protein, and is the translation machinery in your cell. This means that it takes the instructions (from your DNA blueprint) and 'translates' it into a chain of amino acids (a PROTEIN!).\n\nSo let's say you want to make a specific protein. What happens is your DNA is the blueprint, but it's locked away in a vault (the nucleus). So you tell the vault people (DNA polymerase) to make you a copy, and they make a copy of the protein's blueprint out of RNA. RNA is like DNA in that it's written using only 4 letters of the alphabet, but this time the letters are AUCG instead of ATCG. This RNA copy leaves the vault (nucleus), and gets into the hands of the construction foreman (the RIBOSOME). This ribosome then reads every three letters of RNA and translates into an amino acid. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_Codon_Table) is the translation guide between every three RNA letters and a specific amino acid. So the ribosome starts spitting out this chain of amino acids, and depending on which amino acids are used and the order that they're used, this chain folds up a certain way upon itself and becomes a machine (protein). Or maybe not a machine, maybe just a key, or a hammer, or a door, or a lightswitch, or the light itself.\n\nSo by now you're thinking, wow the ribosome sounds pretty important.. IT IS! and this is why the people who studied and described the behavior of the ribosome were [awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2009.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/)\n\nDNA gets alot of attention, but it's the proteins within your cell that are doing all the dirty work. The DNA is just a blueprint for those proteins. \n\nA lot of this is grossly oversimplified, and DNA does have some functions beyond just being a blueprint, but not much.\n\ntl;dr Men's Health is garbage, wikipedia is a much more accurate source for this type of information.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394951907", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I'm aware that the roots are different, but aren't I just essentially playing in C major the entire time?\n\nThis is exactly my issue with the (ubiquitous) way they teach people improvisation. You *are* in C the entire time, and the \"modal\" approach completely ignores the harmonic activity (movement) that is happening in a tune. It doesn't say much at all actually, at most it might tell you to emphasize the root, but that gets boring really quick. Why play what the bass is already playing? \n\nThe opposite (and more effective imho) approach is to look at the actual harmony ('vertical' instead of 'horizontal'). A II-V-I is actually an interplay of different tensions. This tension is a consequence of three major (not in the music theoretical sense) chord \"qualities\" that you can find in all of the diatonic chords in C. These are of course subdominant, dominant and tonic. The tension that these qualities summon are respectively \"moderate tension\" (in C these are Dm and F), \"lots of tension\" (G and Bm (b5) ) and \"no tension\" (C, Em and Am). It is within this framework that you can classify tons of chord sequences that essentially do one thing: bring you back to the tonic (\"home\"). \n\nThe archetypical chord sequence in western music (AFAIK Scarlatti, Bach and some predecessors used it too, I'm no music historian at all, just going off my own knowledge) is the IV-V-I movement (e.g. F G C). If you play these on the piano, you will clearly feel the aforementioned sequence of tensions in these three chords. When you end up at C, you don't feel like the chord should change, you're \"home\". What makes a IV-V-I actually a fit sequence for returning to the tonic? Why not Em- &lt;bullshit chord with lots of tension&gt; - C? The answer is that the leading tones (i.e. the 3 and the 7) move gradually. For a IV-V-I you have that the IV's fifth (C) moves to the leading tone of the V (B) to the root of the I (C). \n\nNow if you look at a II-V-I, this is essentially the same sequence of chord qualities, just in a different form, and on top of that you have both leading tones that each move gradually. What bebop does is extend chords,specifically here with sevenths, to quote Bird:\n\n&gt;[...]I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.\n\nYou have Dm7-G7-CMaj7, in terms of leading tones that move gradually you have Dm7 (C) G7 (C-&gt;B) CMaj7 (F-&gt;E, B-&gt; C, sort of). Say you have two beats per chord, the easiest \"lick\" that sounds okay could be   \nDm7: D F A C   \nG7: B A G F  \nCMaj7: E G C B C ...   \n\nNotice that the emphasis is especially on the B, as it lands on a downbeat and is preceded smoothly by its leading tone. Same with F-&gt; E. You will see this a million times in any bebop giant's solos. It's so simple, yet it makes such a huge difference. Playing over chord changes is not only playing the \"right\" notes, but also playing them on the right spot! Guess what the modal approach tells you about this? Nothing!\n\nWhat is the point of all this? It is these tones that make a II-V-I sound the way it sounds. Not dorian, myxolydian or ionian and all that crap, but these tones and their relation, and you should acknowledge these tones in your improvisation. The easiest way is playing arpeggios and inversions. Once you have those down, you can try new things, add colour notes and whatnot. But for that I suggest you listen a lot, maybe transcribe some passages of interest or complete solo's. \n\nThe modal approach will not work on its own, it's only when you are aware of the actual harmonic mechanism that these might be effective, but at that point you already don't need the modal approach anymore, because you recognize II-V's instantly. I can't help but think that the modal approach is purely symptomatic (the teacher tells which mode to play and they are done) while the harmonic approach goes to the root and answers the question \"why does this sound good\", \"why is this chord here\" and dozens of similar questions.\n\nAnalyse Charlie Parker's solos in the modal approach and the harmonic approach (which I had better called the functional approach) and I can assure you they will make a lot more sense with the latter. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1394999784", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well I am down in GA but I will tell you how we do splits:  \nWhen splitting you want ten frames of just foundation, five for each hive(you will replace the five from the original hive with foundation. \nFrom the hive you are going to split from you want two frames of just ripe honey or donated from surrounding hives (this will keep them busy and less likely to think of swarming).\nOptimally two with one sided amounts of brood (one side has brood the other has little to no brood the brood will face inside and the other side will act as a cold barrier)     \nAnd one frame jam packed both sides with brood.       \nNow you will place the frames with just foundation on the outside two on one side one on the other, then the honey frames next then the light brood and finally the one jam packed full of brood. Something like this: F F H b B b H F F F     \nSorry if this is confusing it’s something better shown.  \nYou will be leaving the queen in the old hive, if you think there are not enough bees in the new hive take a frame and shake some off. Make sure there are both capped and open celled brood, they need eggs (the fresher the better) to make a queen. Its best to capture the queen so you do not mistakenly put her in the new hive, remember its ok for the old hive to have less bees/eggs the queen will replace them all. Above all (and I am repeating), make sure there are plenty of newly laid eggs and two fistfuls of capped eggs, along with a ton of living bees. If there is not enough honey that is ok, if there is not enough brood or bees then wait, its better to wait a week or two then kill the entire hive. When unsure wait, if the hive has several queen cells and is bulging with bees it may be too late and they are planning on swarming, you can split and hopefully stop it but I would advise keeping one queen cell just in case.   \n  \nIf it is late in the season approaching fall the bees might not swarm and if they do odds are they will die before finding a new home. At the same time if it is too early they will be weak and need the extra numbers to get ready for the nectar flow. No matter what the hive will be weak when you split so you should either put them in a nuc or make sure they have a large population before splitting. \nYou should not wait until just before or after a swarm to split, you should be splitting to prevent and multiply your hives. Down here in the south we split three or four times a year to keep the populations under control. Now down to how to split, you are looking for a hive that has filled up its brood box and is starting to get so full that they are spilling out on the front of the hive and hanging off the landing (this is called bearding) you want to watch this hive and prepare to split. When preparing to split you should decide whether you are getting a new queen, taking a frame with a queen cell, or letting them make their own.   \nThere are two times I like to split; the first is right before it rains (best is a few days of rain) now some will say never do this because they will be highly aggressive, I say they will be stuck in the hive for a few days and will have a higher chance of staying (not all splits will stay and if it is right next to the old hive many will fly back)  in the hive because they will start to tend to the emerging brood, remember they need to smell and have brood to take care of or they will leave, the power of the queen will draw a lot back but the brood will keep most in the split. The second time to split is to wait until late in the afternoon or dusk so the bees will be forced to stay inside the split and once again tend the new bees.  \nSorry for the wall of text.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395029209", "subreddit": "Beekeeping", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As it turns out, they do. Evopsych, on the other hand, would require changing the environments of the past to see if a different outcome obtains.

Second, you act as if different cultures haven't been interacting with each other for literally thousands of years, plenty of time for some paradigm (like patriarchy!) to achieve dominance.

{"body": "Ok so I'm going to use an analogy that I just thought of.\n\nYou have a pie. This pie is a delicious G Major pie. It is cut up into 7 slices. These slices are called \"modes\" (or patterns... its technically not a mode by itself but just accept it as fact for now). \n\nWithout any of these slices, you don't have a full pie (scale). All of these slices have names and they are called *G Ionian, A Dorian, B Phrygian, C Lydian, D Mixolydian, E Aeolian, F# Locrian* in this **G Major** pie. \n\nNow... we want to make a different pie. So we shift the ingredients (notes) and we now have a C Major pie. This pie also has the seven slices **but** there is something different about these patterns. Since we changed the ingredients (notes) the slices are still 'slices' (patterns are the same) but the notes are different. That means we get this *C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian, B Locrian*\n\nI'll line both of these side by side. \n\nG Major = G Ionian, A Dorian, B Phrygian, C Lydian, D Mixolydian, E Aeolian, F# Locrian\n\nC Major = C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian, B Locrian\n\nNotice how the crazy music words are in the same order and only the notes have changed? \n\nThat means we have taken that cool G Major pattern you learned (where you started on the 2nd fret) and moved it to a C root note (to the 8th fret)\n\nBut like I said before, you only know 1/7th of the entire scale. Once I get home, I'll get you that pdf that has all of the modes for G Major. \n\nEdit: if you've ever seen Sound of Music and the Do Re Mi song, she's actually singing the progression you're learning now. Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do is the exact same as the progression G A B C D E F# G in G Major. Notice something? Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti is a seven note progression. There are seven notes in one octave progression (G to F#) and seven modes in a single scale (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian). Seven is the key number here. Once these patterns have reached the seventh, it repeats itself, just like she sings in the video \"and that brings us back to Do\".

{"body": "While I play a different style of music, I'm essentially in the same situation as I haven't spent much time developing my vocal melodies- guitar melodies, I feel good at, but there's a bit of a difference, especially when you start dealing with lyrical ideas.  \n\nSome things I've found are that where guitar music, the melodies are kind of busy, alot of vocals are simple- they'll sing the same note a few times and that's where the importance of the lyrics come in. [\"All You Need Is Love\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pFAFsTFTI) is a perfect example of that- the hook of the song \"all you need is love\" is the same note. It's just a D over G, A7 and D7 so the melody stays the same but the relationship to the harmony changes. Here's a great analysis of the song http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/aynil.shtml\n\nI can explain how it works if you want, but if you learn about songs this way, you'll have a better understanding of how melody and harmony interact and that most songs use the same notes as far as the Root, 3rd, 5th (chord tones) and 7th (which is mostly a leading tone, it leads to the root or 5th).\n\nThe other notes 2nd, 4th, 6th are used generally to get to and from the Root and 5th and they're referred to as passing tones.  \n\nNow if you analyze songs based on melody, lyrics and harmony you'll find that there are either leaps or steps between the notes- that's the difference between playing C to D and playing C to F#- steps are easier to sing and kind of feel like they're called, steps. Whereas you'll take a big ol' leap getting to the F# and it will show in your music.\nYou'll also notice these can move in either direction- up or down. Some music will leap from the 5th DOWN to the 7th and then resolve, up to the Root.\n\nI'd suggest starting with simple songs like Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star or Happy Birthday and really just listen to them, because honestly they're the most popular songs of all time- I can't really think of any modern melodies that will outlive these two and they stand on their own, without harmony. I think we forget how fascinatingly good they are. These types of songs are also great examples of intervals (distance between notes). When we hear the first two or three notes of them we automatically identify what they are, even if they aren't them. If someone sang an octave (the same note but higher), you'd probably think of \"Somewhere over the rainbow\" and that's a good thing, or a Perfect 5th could be Star Wars, but the point is you know the intervals and how the work and where they go, but you don't know that you know it.\nHere's a great website that lists a bunch of interval examples http://www.earmaster.com/products/free-tool/interval-song-chart-generator.html\n\nI'm sure you know the pentatonic scale? It's the most commonly used scale, not just for guitar, but for vocals as well because it contains the meat of the notes I mentioned earlier the Root (1st) 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th.  \nExample C Major Pentatonic C D E G A or A minor Pentatonic A C D E G  \nFor whatever reason it's the most common used scale in everything from celtic to western music to japanese music\n\n\nThere's an endless amount of ways to write melody- you could start with an exercise- writing on a single note like the aforementioned song, or you could try singing triads (the 3 notes that make up a chord, C= CEG) and arpeggios.  \nYou could write your melody based on a chord progression and sing the root and then decided where you want to go from there and then even in that situation you could decide that you can only use certain notes or certain rhythmic devices.  \nLyrically, you could write something and then base the melody off them, and when they lyrics are dark you can use minor chords and go down but if you're singing something happy, you could use happy sounding major chords (sometimes that all sounds good if you switch it up and use minor chords over happy lyrics and melodies and major chords over sad lyrics/melody to create a different feeling).\nThe progression of the melody can be dictated in the lyrics as well because if you're singing about flying or being high or something of that nature you'll tend to go up to the highest note or if you're singing about falling down or being down you'll tend to drop the note down and like the chords you could do the opposite as well. In Tom Petty's Free Fallin' he sings \"and I'm Freeeeeee fallin\" and the free is the highest part and he goes down for \"falling\".  \nAlot of those things are kind of obvious, like we know that they're there and why they're there but that doesn't make it easy to create.  \n\nI could go on, but if you have any specific questions or find any of this useful I'm still here", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395103981", "subreddit": "Songwriting", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I worked it out today, it's been 28 years that I have been smoking dope.\n\n\nHeck, I'm stoned now. \n \nI have a creative job and mainly smoke in the evening to try and switch off but also wake and bake in the weekends.  Keep in mind however that I have an extremely addictive personality and a diagnosed functioning alcoholic. \n\nSo I am speaking from the reference of someone that has almost smoked every day for the last 28 years and not someone that has had a sneaky puff in the garage every third weekend for the last 40 years ...and thinks they have a problem, if that makes sense. \n\nSo I feel well qualified to answer your question.\n\nIn truth, you are asking the question to the wrong group, perhaps \"Partner's, friends and families of long term weed smokers, what side effects have you experienced, if any\".\nBecause marijuana's biggest side effect is it's insidiousness.\nYes, look it up, because there really should be a marijuana leaf as the symbol of that phrase.\n\nMy doctor was quite insightful when he said, \"of smoking cannabis, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes, to me your biggest problem and obstacle, is the marijuana...\",  \n\nNow I was quite taken back by this, considering he also said that I would have a physical problem withdrawing from alcohol.\n\n\"The reason being, as long as you smoke marijuana you won't change, you'll have the \"she'll be right\" attitude and you'll never be able to address the other two because you won't care and tomorrow's another day\".\n\nAnd he's right.\n\nGetting stoned puts the brakes on things for awhile, it can slow down time but if you smoke long-time it will stunt your growth.\nAll your growth, because while the world changes you sit still stoned.\nRelationships  may change but you might not.  You'll watch friends set and achieve career goals, you'll watch others fall in love, have babies, grow tired of each other and move on, you'll watch history change, but for comfortable stoned us, we're just the same old same old.\nWe might struggle to make up exciting things we could have done in the weekend but we didn't go out and seize that day simply because we just got s t o n e d.\nThis topic is close to my heart and I am hoping to tackle this demon by myself with gradual meditation practice and than be real proud.\nBut remember how that clever insidious procrastination has me snarled and don't become like this.\nThanks for letting me share\n\n**TLDR:  WEED STEALS YOUR DREAMS**\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395128378", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 52, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As others have commented, this question is posed a bit vague, but consider the following. First for relatedness: The brain integrates many different modalities into a coherent whole. You are free to think of a green apple, a red apple, a green pear, etc. You're also free to think of a violin performer and the sound of his/her playing. These things are often integrated because they are learned and inherent to our understanding of our environment. So, on some level of the brain, they're unrelated things (and for some people who have brain lesions they will always be unrelated things), but if you go \"higher up\" in the brain and different modalities are converging, there will be relatedness between these things and you'll perceive something as a uniform 'thing'.  \n  \nThe next bit is in line with what's been mentioned (somewhat). As I pointed at before, there's some level at which relatedness seizes to be essential (i.e. it also makes sense for us to perceive things as separate beyond a functional threshold). The way we make a more detailed sense of such separate things is by means of attention. Now, there are several ways this can manifest itself. First is the idea that we have both an attentive and pre-attentive awareness of our surroundings. There are studies that indicate that if you read a book or watch a silent movie and are instructed to pay attention to these activities while tonal sequences are played in your ear as follows: A A A B A A A B A A A B, your brain will detect the B tone even if you are not aware of it (this is a form of 'mismatch negativity' in EEG/MEG research). In a way corresponding to your question, you are \"thinking\" of your book and of these so-called oddball sequences, so essentially of two things. However, you're only really aware of what's in your book. Analogous, in our everyday environment, we may be daydreaming while walking somewhere we know, or talking to someone while driving. Essentially, we are doing multiple things, but only really aware of one of them. So depending on your definition of \"thinking\", this could be an explanation.  \n  \nNow, the third part of this discussion entails the purely attentive component of things we already perceive as separate. There is a bit of debate in the literature about our capacity to have multiple points of foci for our attention. The implication of such a capacity would be that we are both able to be aware of two or more things simultaneously, and be attentive of them. An alternative (more prominent) view, which is described in a different comment as well, is where we switch rapidly between different foci of attention, and can be aware (pre-attentively) of the rest of our surroundings. This would mean we are not able to \"think of two things\" as you'd put it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395128953", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are several ways of creating a \"hologram\" on a stage.\n\nThe most basic is using a material called vision gauze which is used a lot in theatre the world round. Lit properly it is (mostly) invisible to the naked eye but will take projection pretty well. This allows a layer of projected image to \"appear\" in mid air.\n\nThe other slightly more advanced and \"invisible\" approach is actually based on an old victorian illusion called \"Pepper's Ghost\". This uses the principle of reflection to reflect an image that is projected onto a screen that is hidden from the audiences view. \n\nHystorically this was done using glass. Imagine a L shaped room. You, the audience, are at one end (y) and you are looking at some one at the other end of the room that is lit (o). The ghost (x) is unlit for the moment and you can not see it. The backslashes represent a pane of glass.\n\n    ___________\n    |          |\n    |     y    |\n    |          |\n    |          |\n    |          |\n    |          |___\n    |  \\         x |\n    |   \\      ____|\n    |  o \\    |\n    | ____\\ __|\n\nNow as soon as x is lit you will see its reflection on the transparent pane of glass. Because y is also lit you will also see him so it will seem that x showed up out of nowhere and is now floating in mid air.\n\nAnyway this concept is used onstage however x is replaced with a projection screen and instead of glass we use a flexible material that we can stretch. On a stage, instead of having the room on the side, a big hole on the stage is used or a cavity is created up in the ceiling. \n\n    ___________________________________\n    |                /\n    |               /\n    |         o    /\n    |        /|\\  /                              y y y y y y y\n    |________/_\\_/    _______             y y y y y y y\n    |            |    |      |    y y y y y y y y\n    |            |  x |      |\n\nYou can kind of observe the same thing in your house when you turn on the lights at night you can see your refection in the window however if you turn them off you can see straight through it.\n\n\nWOW that was alot more long winded that I thought.

{"body": "Hi there, Diamond Jungle main, but Ziggs is my go to champ when I have to play Mid.\n\nFew tips versing him:\n\n1. Respect his passive early game. When it's up, you can tell by clicking on him and it makes an animation when he gets it, he has incredible short burst damage. The correct way for a Ziggs to combo when his passive is up is Auto Q, E/auto and then Q. This allows for his passive to be up a second time at the end of his combo since the spells reduce the cooldown of his passive. Respect the early damage boost it provides and wait till he uses it to CS to trade with him.\n\n2. Call for an early gank from your jungler. I can't tell you how vulnerable he is against an early burst champs like Leblanc and Gragas. Normally, at least from my experience a lot of players go Q E Q W on Ziggs, leaving him vulnerable for a level 3 gank from then jungler and at least a burnt flash on Ziggs if played correctly. \n\n3. 'Counter' champions. Gragas and Leblanc are two of the best AP champions to play verse Ziggs. Both can reliably farm the minions, gragas with Q and Leblanc with W.\nGragas has excellent wave clear and his ult is almost a garenteed hit on Ziggs due to him not having an instant flash/escape in his kit. Post 6 I'd say that gragas is the hardest counter as a Ziggs player.\nLeblanc on the other hand is a skill matchup, if you're good with her she can destroy a Ziggs that doesn't have his summoners up. She forces him to play passive and many times farm with Q instead of heavy pushing and roaming like he'd like to.\nAnother champion I'd like to touch on is Ahri. Pre6 she can play relatively safe and farm with her Q, and post 6 she can all in at anytime she wants to and pushes just as hard as Ziggs. Also her ult is an easy dodging tool for Ziggs skillShots skills.\n\n4. If you're ahead late game and you can't seem to push on the enemy team because of Ziggs, the easiest way to win is to choke out the enemy teams vision and split push. Sure he can ult a side wave, but that's one wave of minions that he can clear. Force outside objectives, go for picks in the jungle and engage when they slip up.\n\n5. Champ select. This is where I'd like to touch on picks in champ select. Generally make sure you have at least one champion with good wave clear against Ziggs late game. Wether it be a Caitlin or Gragas late game, you better be sure to have something that can waveclear as well as he can or you're gonna be shoved under tower and poked down. This leads to my next personal suggestion, pick a champion with a hard engage/initiation. Not thresh, think Malphite, Leona or Vi. The best thing to do against poke comps and poke champions IS hard engage. \n\nFinally, last tip. Play him yourself. The best way to learn to counter something is to learn how to play something. You figure out a lot easier where a champions weak and strong points are if you actually play them instead of just reading about it. Go play 10 games and analyze where you did good and bad and why things went the way they went. Don't just cry op, learn.\n\nHope these tips helped, a tl;dr for you all:\n\nRespect the passive, ask for an early gank, grab some waveclear, make sure your team has a hard engage, and try him out yourself to personally analyze his weaknesses.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395252088", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Very good album, very personal, really good substance. Exile's production really compliment's Blu's flow very well in this project. I believe it's being re-released next month so Cop it if you can HHH!\n\n* (album)Blu &amp; Mainframe - Johnson &amp; Johnson......One of my favorites of the Blu projects that i have. Varying sound along with great production,lyrics, and doesn't lack a bit in substance\n\n* (mixtape) Blu - Jesus......A release I had not expected and was very pleased with. Some songs lack in Sound quality, but if you can get past that, the poetry and production in this project is the epitome of Blu's style. Lyrics are very West Coast, and you'll get what I mean when you give it a good listen\n\n* (mixtape)Blu - So(ul) Amazing Part 1\n\n* (mixtape)Blu - So(ul) Amazing Part 2..........I'll make my comment about these two tapes together. Some of Blu's better sound quality mixtapes. Lots of self reflection and education of morality and what we value in life in these tapes. My first two fav mixtapes by Blu by far.\n\nOther mixtapes that aren't necesarily in my top 5 of his but are still classic blu are: And if you see the E Drop 'Em, N O Y O R K ., the GODleeBarnes(lp), Untaped, and Soul Amazing three.\n\nHe also has a nice collection of Beat tapes, Some of which are:\n* Open (theInstrumentalAlbum)\n* NoSleepForADay\n* Not necessarily a beat tape, but has some beats on it, Her Favorite Colo(u)r\n\nI'm sure with a little bit of googling you can find some of these to download if anyone reading this comment is interested in any of the projects.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395259655", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm pretty sure they were pretty much the same except the TE, and WR probably didn't exist yet.  As I recall the difference between now and the early game is the offense lined up \n\n    E T G C G T E\n          QB\n          FB\n          HB\n          \n\nAnd then the 11th player might be another back or another lineman, I'm not sure.\n\nThe Defense lined up the same way but with the back field players playing LB's and safeties.  Something like:\n\n    E T G N G T E\n        LB  LB\n      S       S\n\nThe E means end and I'm not sure about the guards or the nose on defense.  I think they were called that but they might have had different names.\n\nThe lineman played the same position on both sides of the ball so there weren't DTs and OTs there were just Ts.\n\nWhen the game changed to be more passing heavy the ends on the offense turned into a tight end and a split end.  The split end was an end that as the name suggests split out wide so he could be more useful as a receiver.  The split end eventually transformed into a WR.  One of the backs also started flanking out wider and wider to be used as a receiving threat.  He also eventually transformed into a WR.  This kind of transformation is continuing today as the FBs are being replaced by a 3rd WR and TE's are splitting out more and becoming big receivers.  I doubt TE will ever fully disappear though, their utility as a hybrid receiver/blocker is too high.  However TE may split into 2 distinct positions.\n\nOn Defense the big run stoppers up the middle weren't needed any more so they eventually got removed and replaced by secondary players or were transitioned into the backfield as LBs.  So now the DTs play in the middle rather than opposite the OTs and the DE's play over the OTs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395261698", "subreddit": "nfl", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

So far, the dialogue sample was concise, which is nice. When it started, I anticipated a longer wait before it got to the music. The opening rhythmic pattern seems basic at first, but the sampled voice that comes in on the eighth bar breaks it up with some nice polyrhythmic syncopation.\n\n0.53 really liking the vocal melody so far. Not catching most of the lyrics, but I like the melodic structure and the unique tonal qualities.\n\n1.37 into a 3.40 song without a single section repeat yet. That's promising. Picking up more of the lyrics on the second melodic section for the vocals, and I'm enjoying them. Interesting rhythmic structure in the vocal lines as well.\n\n1.50 ah, there's the first repeat of the verse structure, but it's an augmented version. I dig that.\n\n2.29 the section breaks and transitions work very well.\n\n2.40 those wind/brass instruments are killing me. I like the implementation.\n\n3.30 like the synth sounds in the ending, and the last line was nice.\n\n0.10 of Es-so, more vocal sampling. Still nice, and not overdone.\n\n0.42 a lot of unexpected transitions and variation, that still seem to make sense and work for the song.\n\n1.18 I'm getting a real joy out of the unique sounds she uses.\n\n1.40 Every line I've been able to interpret so far has been really well-written.\n\n2.13 I appreciate her working within and without the confines of theoretical tradition at the same time. It's innovative and fresh.\n\n2.50 somehow for something strange and unique, it's also quite accessible for what it is.\n\n3.30 hanging mostly on the same chord structure on the whole song, yet not dragging after three and a half minutes.\n\n0.55 on Gangsta. I really like the combination of sampled melodies, programmed drums, and live melodies and drums on this album. This song is a shining example.\n\n1.50 lots of section variation throughout the album as well. Repeats always feature augmentation and variation.\n\n2.30 more well used dialogue samples here.\n\n2.47 interesting use of vocal production to swell into a transition.\n\n3.14 the breaking and manipulation of the main vocal track is dope as hell. Sorry if that's not descriptive, but damn does she do good work.\n\n3.54 the ending was perfect for that song.\n\n0.11 Powa. This one features a much different aesthetic to the prior songs. Welcome change, and a good demonstration of versatility.\n\n0.54 another common element: using simple and common rhythms sprinkled with unexpected, complex, uncommon, but well suited one time events.\n\n1.54 so much diversity of instrumentation while maintaining a general atmospheric setting. That's a combination of solid writing and production.\n\n3.09 she's funny, and smart, lyrically. That's a good combination. Good use of metaphor so far, and other interesting techniques.\n\n4.09 such great juxtaposition of classic pop music elements and new experimental elements on this album.\n\n4.54 the increasing saturation of the delay guitar (the echoing one) throughout was a tonal beauty.\n\n0.42 Riot. can't say enough about great her use of rhythm is. Unique and satisfying. Gets me swaying without resorting to cheap and well established rhythmic elements. New and accessible. Hard to accomplish.\n\n1.50 as a guitarist, innovative use of effects gets me going. This album is filled with it.\n\n2.29 controlled chaos. Brilliant.\n\n2.48 and the chaos breaks into a powerful vocal line.\n\n3.12 powerful vocal line ushered in a strong emotional climax for the song.\n\n3.40 following that climax, this ending brings down the chaos while increasing tension. Clever.\n\n0.10 Bizness. this song demonstrates how well she uses vocal sampling. Rhythmic and melodic.\n\n0.57 quality bass tone throughout the album. Quality everything tone so far. Clear she put a lot of work into getting the perfect sound.\n\n1.37 smooth and appropriate transitions are the hardest thing for me to nail as a writer. She kills it.\n\n2.40 one of my favorite things is that I can hardly think of anyone who comes close to comparing stylistically.\n\n3.50 so many satisfying one time events.\n\n\n4.21 Bizness was the perfect distillation of her sound into a good single.\n\n0.25 Doorstep.

{"body": "I think this will be easier to explain by example.\n\nLet's start with the most basic of scales, C major:\n\nC D E F G A B (C)\n\nIf you play two notes next to each other in the scale (ie C and D) you get a sound that isn't very pleasing or useful on it's own. But if you skip a note, for example C and E or D and F, they go well together. If you try each combination like this you will find that they all make one of two different kinds of harmony. C-E, F-A, and G-B all sound alike and are each what is called a \"major third\". D-F, E-G, A-C, and B-D also all sound alike and are each what is called a \"minor third\". The reasons why they are called this are outside the scope of this comment, but having the names makes it easier to explain. You may also notice that a minor third is always 3 half steps (A-&gt;A#-&gt;B-&gt;C) and a major third is always 4 half steps (C-&gt;C#-&gt;D-&gt;D#-&gt;E) - counting half-steps is one way to tell the difference between the two.\n\nNow these major and minor thirds sound okay on their own, but they are also somewhat weak sounding. That is part of why most western harmony is based on groups of not two notes, but three, called a triad. To make these, we skip another note and use the next one, for example C-E-G or D-F-A. One way to look at this is a major or minor third with *another* major or minor third on top (ie C-E is a major third plus E-G is a minor third).\n\nSo now from our C major scale there are seven triads we can make, each one based off of a note in the scale:\n\n1. C-E-G\n2. D-F-A\n3. E-G-B\n4. F-A-C\n5. G-B-D\n6. A-C-E\n7. B-D-F\n\nChords 1, 4, and 5 are the same pattern of a major third with a minor third on top. These are called \"major chords\". Chords 2, 3, and 6 are the other way around - a minor third with a major third on top. These are called \"minor chords\". Chord 7 is the weird one - it's a minor third with another minor third on top! This is called a \"diminished chord\". In other scales besides the major and natural minor you may find a fourth type as well, made with two major thirds - this is called an \"augmented chord\" (an example would be C-E-G#, which does not exist in C major but can be found in certain other scales such as A harmonic minor, A-B-C-D-E-F-G#)\n\nThese are not the only types of chords that exist, but they are by far the most common and important ones in western music, and understanding them will empower you to learn how other kinds of chords are built and function.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395268117", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "PRE-ORDER THIS ALBUM\n\nDO IT\n\nIT'S GOOD ENOUGH\n\nedit: here was my writeup when it came out, I still feel the same:\n\n&gt; alright just downloaded it, going to give my first impressions.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Elevators:** nice beat. I love how Chuck can make such a simplistic beat as good as complex ones. Chuck's raps are a bit average but I still love him. this feels really different, I like the hook. very nice and smooth. Buddy's verse is OK, his voice kinda reminds me of a deeper voiced E-40. the flow was nice. Really feeling Polyester's verse, I like it. That flow is nice, that autotune effect was nice, not intrusive or annoying or forced at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; **Swervin:** nice beat, again. Simplistic but good. It drowns out Chuck a bit but it's so good it's not much of a problem. That hook is good, catchy. Sir Michael Rocks still rocks, can't wait for more Cool Kids. I love Mikey so much. That flow, that delivery, everything. Polyester's verse is fire, shiiiiit. I love it. Gonna have to check this dude out, for sure. Flow is on point, rhymes were great, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Legs:** Already listened to this 100x but I love it. Chromeo on the hook &gt;. I honestly prefer this to anything on R.A.M and even on G I R L tbh, besides Happy. Really funky, easy to dance to. Chuck kills his verse, I really like his delivery. Idk why, but it's addicting to listen to. Chuck kills every verse on this song tbh. The production on this is insanely good. Chuck is in my top 10 producers tbh, hella slept on and underrated. I could see someone like Chance or Vic on this track for a remix, easily. Tokyo Shawn would be perfect on it, too. Andre 3k could fit over it really well, too. \n&gt; \n&gt; **Came Thru/Easily:** Came out a long time ago on one of his other EPs, dope song. One of my favorite Soulo and Mac verses. Flow and lyrics on point for the entire song. Everyone kills it. Beat is great, again. Chuck is just too good. One of Chuck's best verses, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Attitude:** That beat is fucking insane. sounds straight out of the fuckin dungeons of rap. This could be a Mobb Deep instrumental, basically. Chuck fucking kills it. Holy shit. I think this might be the best Chuck verse I've heard yet. BJ on hook still killing it. Love his hooks. Chuck kills 2nd verse. This beat is sooo nasty, I love it. BJ's hook on this beat seems so unconventional but it works so well for some reason. That beat change tho... sounds like something from the Tron soundtrack, really nice.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Mas o Menos:** ooh I like this. this beat is nice. That sample works well. This track is really weird, but I like it. Feeling this the least out of all the songs so far, but I still really like it. This Chuck verse is great, too. This album is gonna be so slept on and underrated it's not even funny. Oh shit this spanish feature, wasn't expecting this. Dope. Was hoping for a full verse but that little part was too nice.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Money Clip:** this beat. Sounds really nice, almost like G-Funk but not quite G-Funk. Chuck verse is too nice. I'm really enjoying the samples used in this album so far, they work really well. That hook is catchy. 2nd verse feature is niiiiice. Kinda reminds me of MC Eiht in a way, can't explain it. Really nice though, rides the beat really well and his flow is nice. That part near the end is great. I like this hook's beat change. Oh shit, this 3rd verse is really nice. Not sure who this is but they kill it. Really nice. That transition was nice. Sulaiman! Killin it, fuuuuuuck. Sulaiman is severely slept on, really. Loved his verse on Pinata but this verse is just fuckin' insane. Love it. Vic's verse starts, says what we're all thinking \"Chuck on his old school\". Really nice Vic verse, he has such a vast number of flows it's insane.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Prism:** Really weird beat, that guitar solo is nice. Jade has a nice voice, I'm feeling this. Really funky. Feels airy, but still satisfying in a weird way. I don't know how to explain it. Chuck is going kinda experimental and I love it. Chuck's verse was OK, I liked the flow. Definitely feeling this beat + hook, for sure. Real nice. Dammmn this beat change is too nice. Funky as fuck. Really nice. Jade + this beat on the change is soooooo niiiiice wow. Really feeling this. I'm really enjoying this song more than I thought I was going to when it started. I feel like this 2nd half of the song is a lot better than the 1st. That guitar solo is nice, too. Fits surprisingly well.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Game Time:** FUUUUCK this is great. This beat is too nice. I think this is one of Bronsolino's best verses so far, I love it. That transition from Bronson -&gt; Chuck is too good, and this Chuck verse is amazing goddamn. I love it. I think this album is some of Chuck's best work yet and I can't wait for Shark Week now.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Hurt You Back:** This feels futuristic as shit, and really unique. Chuck starts with a killer verse. I'm really enjoying that \"pew\" sound in the background. Synths are too nice. This Chuck verse thoo... then Benny Cassette on the hook? IDK who she is but I love this. Feels really nice. Unless Benny's the guy in the hook, can't tell. Chuck's gotten a lot better at rapping since Bake Sale and shit. Really feeling this 2nd verse. Flow is nice. That singing is too nice. This breakdown with the subtle guitar in the background is super nice. Really spacey vibe from this part of the song, I like it. \n&gt; \n&gt; **Dream:** Nice beat so far. I like the chimes. That harp... wow. This beat feels like heaven. Chuck rides this beat really well. I like this... I think it's picking up pace? I'm pretty sure it is. The beat is heaven but the lyrics are far from heavenly in subject, I love it. I had a dream on the low, that this album would not be underrated.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Glam:** Was looking forward to this song hardcore, already heard it, but I love it so much. The singing by Macie Stewart is heavenly af and that guitar completes it soo well. Nico Segal on trumpets is too good. I'm pretty sure this is featuring the entirety of Social Experiment. That piano. The beat's drowning out Chuck a bit but I like it. The hook is soooo positive, I love it. Chance's singing is so good and it's unexpected. God loves all my niggas. NiggIGH. Chance been killing every verse recently, this verse is sooooo good. His flow is so bouncy it's crazy, I love him. Chance sing-rapping and it's soo nice. Social Experiment is nice on this track, for real. The guitar and drums on this track are really nice, too. Macie's singing is just heavenly, tho. Makes the track.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall: 9/10, summer as fuck. Really nice album. Chuck's best work probably. Features all killed it, hyped for Shark Week.

Songs like Brand New are really great and Pharrell's falsetto is on point on most tracks.

{"body": "It seems to me that this DOTA2 player fulfills most if not all of the requirements set before the league. I don't believe this league should partake in unilateral persecution of its own members for unknown reasons. If someone desires to play in a casual league such as our own, it is only fit we let people of all colors and creed join us. Without diversity we stake to limit our adaptability and thus restrict our social boundaries. \n\nI have seen this aforementioned player Ren|{t in some of the inhouse games I've seen and I've only seen him be positive and reinforcing to some of the newer and more inexperienced members of DOTA2. I have never witnessed him publicly rage at any one person, regardless of how absolutely terrible the trashcans may be. \n\nAs a DOTA2 player, I can respect his skill. As a human, I can respect his attitude. Perhaps we shall all see an end to all the background shenanigans going on and perhaps there's a whole other side to the story, however, I am simply a human being, and I can only observe what I see with my own two eyes. \n\nExtraordinarily, this man is not one who wishes to come back to our league, but rather, someone who desires a simple explanation as to why he has been removed perhaps unjustly. I can support his quest to find the truth. With someone so dedicated and so hopeful, I can only apologize that we can't ask to have him back, rather than the other way around. \n\nIt seems this post is longer than I have intended, but his words struck at the core of my heart. As a fellow human being who has been subjected to rash acts like this, I can sympathize with him. The high road is a long and difficult, but I wish you the best Ren|{t.

{"body": "I used to be really terrible at her for some reason. Lately I've gotten much better at her, and while I'm not sure exactly why, I have some ideas.\n\nOne big thing is your skill build and refraction charge management. Something I couldn't comprehend for some reason when I first started playing her was that I was *literally* taking no damage while my refraction charges were up. For this reason, max Refraction ASAP. A solid skill build is Q E Q W Q R. Just leave one point in Psi Blades, they give you enough range to be more competitive last hitting in lane. Max Meld after Refraction.\n\nI also changed up my item build. As long as you're getting good farm, it's fine to go Midas on her as she doesn't need too many early items to be effective. I used to always build Phase boots on her, but I think treads are way better. Switching them to STR while your Refraction is down lets you tank up some more, and switching to AGI when it's up gives you even more damage. They also give you even more attack speed if you got a Midas earlier. Blink is really really strong on her. You can blink right next to an enemy, Meld, and then instantly attack them to take out a huge chunk of their health. In most cases you'll also want a BKB so you can give even less fucks, and I think Deso just synergizes too well with Meld not to pick it up. After that, you can switch it up a bit. If you're still having difficulties surviving in fights, you can pick up an AC to tank up, while synergizing with your spells and items, as well as stacking more attack speed. If you're just destroying everything, Crit is a great choice, and if a pesky carry's evasion is starting to become an issue, MKB is another great damage dealer.\n\nWhile in game, make sure your refraction charges are up when you go into a fight. Try to time the cooldown so that as your last defensive charges run out, you have another set ready to go. Use Meld very offensively once you get your blink dagger, use Psi Blades to get clutch last hits and harass your lane opponent, and use traps to give vision of runes and common places supports come to gank, as well as for chasing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395666623", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Do Not:\n\n– Name after a Ship of Misfortune ( Titanic, Lusitania, Andrea Doria, etc. )\n\n– Have a name, which is pompous, arrogant or threatening\n\n– Give an Impressive Name ( name should be humble )\n\n=&gt; humble is more likely to pass unnoticed by the elements\n\n=&gt; haughty named vessel is bound for trouble\n\n– Name after Larger Denizens of the Deep; Oceans, Winds, Storms or Other Cataclysmic Events that might offend \nthe gods of the seas\n\n\n\nWill your boat name weather this storm?\n\n\n1) The Explanation Test. How often do you want to explain what the name means?\nBizarre Greek gods, in-jokes, and foreign words usually fail this test.\nNames that are difficult to spell fall in this category.\n\n2) The Non-cute Test. How sappy is the name? Puns, childhood nicknames, and in-jokes usually fail this test.\n\n3) The Brevity Test. \"Brevity is the soul of wit\" as well as the soul of boat names.\nImagine repeating your boat name 3 times, followed by a \"Mayday\".\nStill sound like a good name?\n\n4) The Hubris Test. If you're racing, try not to pick names like \"Magic Bullet\", \"Blew By You\" (see test 2), or \"Clear Ahead\", unless you feel you can live up to them.\n\n5) The \"Been There, Done That\" Test. Don't name your boat after a type of wind (Zypher,\nSirroco, Breeze), any historical boat (Dawn Treader, Ra, Spray) or an alcoholic\nbeverage. Unless, of course, that's what the boat tells you her name is.\n\n6) The Embarrassment Factor. Imagine explaining your boat's name to someone you don't like,\nand who doesn't like you. If grudging respect is not a possible outcome, you may wish\nto reconsider.\n\n7) The Corruption Test. What will your 'friends' call your boat? e.g. White Hawk = White Cloud or Serenity=Senility.\n\n8) The Omen test. Once followed a boat cutely named 'Das Broke' out one day. He promptly drove over a submerged section of break wall at high speed and sank.\n\n9) The radio Test. \"Over and Out\" would be a bad name. ... \"This is Summertime calling Over and Out.

{"body": "# Music Theory Notes\n\nThese notes are very basic and simplified.\nEverything is more complex than described here.\nIt is meant as a very basic start into music theory.\nI keep these notes as I try to learn blues guitar.\n\n## Melody\n\nLooking at a piano keyboard we quickly see a pattern of white and black keys\nthat repeats.\nThe black keys come in bunches of two or three.\nTry playing the white keys starting with the one just to the left of a group of two black keys.\nThat note is named C.\nIf you play the white keys up to the next C you hear the familiar _do re me fa so la ti do_.\nThis is, of course, the _C major scale_.\nTry fooling around playing the white keys starting and ending on a C.\nNow you're noodling around in C major.\nIn the diagrams that follow the little vertical bars are meant to depict the black keys.\nThe letters are note names for the white keys.\n\n     | |   | | |\n    C D E F G A B C\n    ^             ^\n\nFor extra credit do it again with only the white keys.\nThis time start and stop on the key two white keys below the C.\n(or any of the white keys that fall between the second and third black keys\n in a group of three black keys)\nSounds a bit melancholy, doesn't it.\nNow you're noodling around in A minor.\nSame notes, but different emphasis.\n\n     | |   | | |\n    C D E F G A B C\n              ^\n\nWhen you play the notes in order (up or down) it's called a scale.\nWhen you noodle it's called a melody.\nSo we have played the C major scale and the _A minor scale_\nand making up simple melodies with them.\n\n## Harmony\n\nNow try playing three notes at once.\nNot just any three, but the ones pointed to below:\n\n     | |   | | |\n    C D E F G A B C\n    ^   ^   ^\n\nThat's a C _major triad_. It is a very simple chord.\nThe three notes harmonize with each other.\nNow try these three:\n\n     | |   | | |\n    C D E F G A B C\n          ^   ^   ^\n\nNote that both the triads above use only the white keys,\nthe keys in C major (and A minor).\nMore subtle is the fact that there are two black keys\nbetween the left note of the triad and the center note.\nThere is just one black key between the center and right notes.\n\nThe \"distance\" between notes is measured in _steps_.\nThe distance between two adjacent keys is a _half step_.\nTwo half steps is, naturally a whole step.\nSo you can see that our C major scale follows the pattern of:\n\n    whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half\n\nThat's the pattern of the other major keys which can start on any piano key.\nOf course, except for C major all the other major keys will have to use black keys\nto keep the major above.\n\nNow back to our triads.\nNotice that if we play this triad it doesn't really have that same major sound:\n\n     | |   | | |\n    C D E F G A B C\n      ^   ^   ^\n\nThat's because it doesn't have the same number of steps between the tones\n(the same number of black keys).\nBut this one does:\n\n     | |   | | |   |\n    C D E F G A B C D\n            ^   ^   ^\nThat's it. These are the only three major triads\nwhere all the notes are in the C major scale.\nHere's another diagram where we go vertical\nto show the notes in all three triads:\n\n     | |   | | |\n    C D E F G A B C\n    E     A B\n    G     C D\n\nPlay all three notes of the C major triad.\nThen do the same for the other two.\nNow mess around with these three triads starting with C.\n\nIf you look at a lot of popular songs\nyou will see C, F, and G chords pretty frequently.\nThese are also called the I, IV, and V chords respectively.\nYou can probably figure out why they are called that.\nIf we number the notes of the C major scale starting with C\nF is 4 and G is 5.\nThen we go with roman numerals.\nThe other triads will sound a bit sad and are called _minor_.\nLower case chord numbers are used for those:\n\n    I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi\n\n### Melody and Harmony\n\nNow try playing those same triads with your left hand\nand noodle around with the white keys higher up (to the left)\nwith your right hand.\nYour right hand is playing the melody\nand your left hand is supporting the melody with harmony.\n\n## Keys\n\nIf you use a particular scale to build melodies and chords for a tune\nthat tune will be in a _key_ of the same name.\nSo, if you make up a tune with chords and melody from the C major scale\nit will be in the key of C major, or just \"the key of C\" for short.\nKeep in mind that the note C and the C major triad (or C chords) would be\nwhere you start and finish.\nIf you emphasize A as your _root_ note \nthen even though you are still using only the white keys\nyou are playing in the key of A minor.\nBecause the key of A minor uses the same notes as the key of C\nthe key of A minor is called the _relative minor_ to the key of C.\n\n## Pentatonic Scales\n\nIf you play all the keys, white and black, you get what's called \"the chromatic scale\".\nThe major and minor keys are called \"diatonic scales\"\n(I think, also heptatonic for 7 tones).\nBut what if you play just the black keys?\nStarting with the left-most black key in a group of three,\nthere are five in the pattern.\n\n    Gb, Ab, Bb, Db, and Eb.\n\nTry noodling again with only these keys\nand start and stop on the Gb.\nDoes it sound a bit Chinese to you?\nSort of does to me.\nThis is the Gb major pentatonic scale.\nCounting steps between the notes we get:\n\n    1, 1, 1.5, 1, 1.5\n\nNow back to the white keys.\nLet's start with C and take the same steps.\nWe get the C major pentatonic scale:\n\n    C, D, E, G, A\n\n     | |   | | |\n    C D E F G A B C\n    ^ ^ ^   ^ ^\n    1 2 3   5 6\n\nNotice this is the C major scale with half steps omitted.\n\nNext play that scale starting on A (remember the A minor scale?)\n\n    | | |   | |   |   \n     G A B C D E F G\n       ^   ^ ^ ^   ^\n       1   3 4 5   7\n\nThis gives us the A minor pentatonic scale.\n\n## The Blues Scale\n\nNow let's add a _blue note_, a flatted 5.\nTry noodling around with this.\nRemember to start and stop on A.\n\n    | | |   | |   |   \n     G A B C D E F G\n       ^   ^ ^^^   ^\n       1   3 4 5   7\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395779060", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here is an extremely oversimplified description:\n\nFirst, the musical alphabet contains the letters **A** through **G** with some *\"flats\"* (written as a lower case \"b\" to the right of the capital letter) and *\"sharps\"* (written as a \"#\" to the right of the capital letter). Therefore **\"Bb\"** would be pronounced **\"Bee Flat\"** in english and **\"C#\"** would be pronounced as **\"See Sharp\"**. *Flats* sound a little lower in pitch and *Sharps* sound a little higher in pitch.\n\nSo, when someone writes music on a page that says, *\"play a* **C** *for me,\"* here's what happens:\n\n* If an instrument like a tuba or a flute plays the **C**, you will actually *HEAR* a **C**.\n* If an instrument like a trumpet (which is said to be tuned to **Bb** [Bee Flat]), you will hear a **Bb**. Not a **C**.\n\nAlphabet for **C** instruments (oversimplified):\n\n**C D E F G A B C**\n\nAlphabet for **Bb** instruments (oversimplified):\n\n**Bb C D Eb F G A Bb**\n\n\n* So when we are telling them to play a **C**, it's *like* (again, way oversimplified) telling them to play the **first note** (letter) in *their* alphabet.\n\nIf an instrument is said to be tuned to **F**, then their alphabet would start on that letter:\n\n**F G A Bb C D E F**\n\n* So if they played *their* **C**, it would sound like an **F**.\n\nAgain, this is ***WAY*** simplified and I'm sure that many music ed students would hate this description. But, for laymans, who just want an *easier/basic* explanation, this is a good start.

They've moved a lot from one sound to another and have been releasing a steady stream of albums/eps for as long as the band has been together. The new album is one of their most energetic works and the album is pretty strong, i couldn't really say i thought a single track on the album was weak, even though none of the songs are 'blow me away amazing'.\n\n* [Cloud Nothings -- Pattern Walks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2gezhxG4rI)\n\n[**Have A Nice Life -- The Unnatural World \\((2014\\))**](http://listeninglog.tumblr.com/post/79499850090/have-a-nice-life-the-unnatural-world-2014)\n\nHave A Nice Life is kind of similar to Slint in my head, although none of their songs have ever been similar to anything on Spiderland their music has always had a really dark Post-Rock type of sound that Slint had without being the type of band that's trying to sound like Slint. The album is mixed to be incredibly noisy so much so that sometimes you think you're listening to white noise but it's still really good once you get use to it. So far, for me this is the best album put out this year. Cropsey and Guggenheim Wax Museum are linked below, and both songs are absolute monsters of tracks, Guggenheim especially seems like a missed opportunity to be used in the new Godzilla film. Also, the link in the title is again to the tumblr, click on the album image if you want to download it. \n\n[* Have a Nice Life -- Guggenheim Wax Museum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FUMl2gAM7c)\n\n[* Have a Nice Life -- Cropsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-bDyYkYX74)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395865930", "subreddit": "LetsTalkMusic", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This might go into too much detail, but this is from an explanation I wrote a while ago about flames.\n\nThere are three main things going on in most flames:\n    1) Fuel is heated and becomes a gas\n    2) The gas burns\n    3) Heat and light are produced\n\nSince there are so many different types of flames, I'll primarily focus on a candle.\n\n1) Paraffin wax is heated and becomes a gas.\n\nParaffin was is a is a long molecule, but it's quite simple, since it's made of only two elements, Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H). It looks like this:\n\n       H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H\n       | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n     H-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-H\n       | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n       H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H\n\nThe C is a carbon atom, the H is a hydrogen atom, and the lines are bonds between them. The molecule isn't flat, but that's the general idea.\n\nThe name paraffin is a general term for molecules like this, but of many different lengths. The one above has 20 carbon atoms, but it could have 21, or even 40 carbon atoms and still be called paraffin wax. Most candles are actually a mix of Paraffins. When chemists want to be more precise, they have other names they use. The molecule above is also called \"Icosane\", from \"ekosi\" the Greek for 20, and \"ane\" which refers to this type of simple carbon and hydrogen structure.\n\nIf you heat Icosane it melts at 37 deg C (98 deg F) and as it gets hotter it starts producing more Icosane vapors. These vapors are produced well below Icosane's boiling point  -- like it's possible to dry cloths on a line because water slowly evaporates even below the boiling point of water. When Icosane reaches 110 deg C, it can produce vapors that are concentrated enough that they can burn. This is called the flash point -- it doesn't mean that the vapors will burn, just that there are concentrated enough that they can burn if ignited by something else.\n\nLarger molecules usually need higher temperatures to melt or boil, so a paraffin with 40 carbons would have a flash point of 138 deg C. A mix of different paraffins in a candle will have a flash point somewhere in between.\n\nWhen the paraffin becomes a gas, it actually cools the wick slightly -- like how sweating cools your skin -- so even in the middle of a flame, the paraffin evaporating actually stops the wick from burning. The same thing happens with boiling water, which is why it's possible to boil water in a paper cup.\n\nWhat about things other than candles?\n\nWith a gas barbeque or stove, it's simpler since the the Propane (\"prop\" meaning three carbons, \"ane\" meaning the same simple structure as above) or natural gas, (which is mostly Methane (\"meth\" meaning one carbon)) are already gases at room temperature so they don't need to be heated.\n\nWith a wood fire, it's more complicated. Cellulose in wood is a much bigger molecule so it needs to be broken up before it can become a gas, and there are other things in wood, so it doesn't all become gas. It takes more energy to break up the wood molecules, so wood needs to be at at least 230 deg C (450 deg F) before it produces enough gas to burn (the exact temperature depends on the type of wood). About 70% of the wood becomes Carbon Monoxide, Hydrogen, and Methane, which look like this:\n\n                  H\n                  |\n     C=O  H-H   H-C-H\n                  |\n                  H\n\nThis is known as \"wood gas\" and it used to be widely produced, stored and used for lighting, cooking and vehicles during WW I. It is still used today in some places as an alternative to natural gas. In some ways making wood gas from rice husks and other plan waste and then burning it is better for the environment than drilling for natural gas or oil, but there are also disadvantages.\n\nA lot of the rest of the wood becomes soot, which is just clumps of Carbon of various sizes which don't have enough Oxygen and time to burn completely. The ash that is left behind is mostly Calcium Carbonate, which is more difficult to draw accurately, but looks something like:\n\n         O\n         |\n     Ca--C-O\n         |\n         O\n\n\n2) The paraffin gas burns.\n\n\"Burn\" can mean many different things, but in chemistry it usually means a rapid reaction with Oxygen, and that's what happens here. Burning is all about moving from molecules with more potential energy to molecules with less potential energy, and releasing that energy as heat. Because that's a bit vague, let me throw in a metaphor here. It's a bit like how a ball sitting on a table has more gravitational potential energy than a ball sitting on the floor. The ball on the table won't fall unless it gets a little push, but it can then fall to the floor. However the ball on the floor won't be able to get onto the table unless you do a lot more work and lift it up. Chemistry is similar. Some molecules are very unstable and only need the tiniest nudge to fall, while others take a lot to get them going. Some reactions are very energetic and involve falling a long way, while others are just a little drop. A falling ball might just make a noise and a dent in the floor, but falling water can run a generator, and chemical reactions tend to release heat. There are some reactions that can release energy in other ways, such as high pressure gas with gunpowder, or light without heat with glow sticks, but heat is a very common output.\n\nFor a candle, the first things that happens is the long chains of Paraffin get split apart into smaller pieces until there are just one or two carbon atoms per molecule. Every time the chain is broken it exposes two ends which are more reactive, so they can form some very unstable molecules (called radicals). These can be Ethynyl radical, CH radical, Carbon Monoxide,  and Atomic Hydrogen:\n\n     C≡C-H    C-H    H\n\nSplitting up the large Carbon chains takes energy, so this is actually cooling the flame down slightly. While this is happening, Oxygen from the surrounding air is also reacting and first producing some other molecules like Hydroxyl radical, Carbon Monoxide, and Atomic Oxygen:\n\n    O-H    C=O   O\n\nThe two molecules that can be produced have the lowest potential energy -- the ones that are sitting on the energy floor -- are Carbon Dioxide and Water, which look like this:\n\n     O-C-O   H-O-H\n\nGiven enough heat, time and oxygen, eventually all the Paraffin would end up as just Carbon Dioxide and Water. It's this reaction with Oxygen that produces the heat in a flame.\n\nHowever, if there isn't enough Oxygen, then the radicals can also recombine into the larger Carbon structures that we call soot. There are so many possibilities here that I'm not even going to try and draw them, but one of the interesting shapes that comes up because it's also quite stable is Buckminsterfullerene, which is a sphere made of 60 Carbon atoms arranged like a soccer ball.\n\nThere are lower energy molecules, but they require elements that aren't usually found in a candle, or in the air. As with too many things, it's a bit more complicated than that, so you can Google \"standard enthalpy of formation\" to learn more about this.\n\n\n3) Heat and light are produced.\n\nWhen anything gets hot, it glows. Most things, like the heating element in a stove or toaster, or the filament in an incandescent light bulb, give off what's called \"black-body radiation\". (That \"radiation\" means radiating light, not the \"ionizing radiation\" that can cause cancer.) At low temperatures a black-body will glow a little bit in the infrared, as it gets hotter this moves into visible light and it glows red, then more green light gets added and it glows yellow, then more blue light gets added and it glows white. Black-body radiation produces a wide range of colors of light and the colors gradually change with the temperature in a very predictable way. A candle flame is 1,000-1,400 deg C, which produces a range of black-body radiation that on average looks orange.\n\nWith a flame something different is also happening. Inside the flame the heat is enough to tear some of the electrons away from the molecules. This creates something called \"plasma\". In extreme cases all of the electrons can be stripped away and any molecules fall apart and you are left with a plasma that contains the positively charged nuclei of atoms in a cloud of negatively changed electrons, but that doesn't generally happen in a flame. When an electron recombines with a molecule the energy will sometimes be released as heat, but sometimes it will produce light. The color of the light depends on how far the electron fell, which depends on the structure of the molecule rather than the temperature. The CH radical produces the blue light that you see in a Propane flame, or at the bottom of a candle flame.\n\nAs you get higher up the flame there is more soot in the flame. The large soot molecules produce black-body radiation. If you split apart the light with a prism and look at the full spectrum, there is usually a brighter band in the blue due to the number of CH radicals. In addition to being the main source of light, this soot in the flame is also the reason that the yellow part of flame casts a shadow, while the blue part at the base doesn't.\n\nChemists will sometimes hold a little bit of a material in a flame to help identify it. For example Sodium produces a bright yellow flame, Copper produces a green flame, Lithium produces a red flame, and Arsenic produces a pale blue flame. If you look at the full spectrum the exact positions of the bands is more precise than just the general color.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1395927409", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

But what it does illustrate is that a rational fear (\"Our leaders are out of touch with the common people; they don't know what our lives are like or how we suffer.\") that is extremely common, and reacts to it with an explanation (\"Lizard people!) that isn't very rational.\n\nDo you see the difference?

L’ ambiente è costituito da una stanza nuda, salvo la presenza di un computer, dal cui schermo balza fuori improvvisamente il Bug, che inizia a svolazzare qua e là, sporcando con chiazze colorate le pareti bianche. L’attore spiega : “Ecco che salta fuori il Millennium Bug, un invitato indesiderato alla nostra festa di Capodanno del 2000.

{"body": "Yeah as OP said go to youtube for the basics. Learn how to read Tab. There should be tutorials on there. \n\n After that learn all the basic chords. A B C D E F G Yes there are alot more variations then that. But those will do you for a while. \n\n Next just google chordbook.com You can actually use this for the chords I mentioned. But also take a look at the \"scales\" section. These are very important and If nothing else will at least get your fingers moving in new exciting ways. \n\n Learn a few chords then a few scales. Then decide what kind of music you want to focus on playing. But I recommend 2 things. \n\n The first is to learn basic strumming patterns (Every country song ever)  early on. It's easier to learn it when you're just starting, opposed to learning it 8 years later. 2 At least try music outside of your comfort zone. Hear a song you like but it's not the usual music you listen to? Learn it. Then learn from it. Being boxed in to one particular style sucks. \n\n Also don't count out getting a Teacher. I took lessons for about 4 or so years? I was really dedicated, played at least 4-6 hours a day. Since I was a kid in High School I had alot of time on my hands. So 4 hours was nothing to me. Point is I gave up on being a guitarist and even though I haven't played seriously in around 2-3 years. I can still pick one up and play 80% of the scales and arpeggios I burned into my mind. Also all the songs people force you to learn and play on demand :/ \n\n Point is just find something that sounds cool, then drive it so far into your head that it's just there. Ready on demand. Then play with it and make it your own :D Also don't play to get famous or to get laid. Trust me. Just play for your own enjoyment. Have fun man. \n\nEdit: Wow almost forgot this one. Assuming you have a smart phone download a Metronome app or just google Metronome. Heck some tuners/pedals even come with them built in so that's a possibility. Just set it to a pace you're comfortable with and practice keeping time. Then as you get better get faster. You can just go to youtube for more information on keeping time with a metronome.

{"body": "If you want to start improvising, start improvising. Play the song as you normally would. Hit a couple random notes without breaking rhythm. Go back to your normal play. Did they work? No. Try different notes. Keep the rhythm going. Keep adding notes as they sound good. When in doubt, go back to what your comfortable with. Always try to keep the rhythm ticking along. You can change the rhythm while improvising, but you've got to come back. \n\nIt sounds like tripe, but all improvising comes from sounding terrible. Try, fail, try again, fail again, repeat ad infinitum. Record yourself. Listen to your recordings. You'll often hear things in recordings that you didn't realize you liked when playing. You don't need theory to improvise, but it does help immensely. \n\nIf you want to start learning theory, learn it. Start with scales. I'd recommend not looking a scale sheet and build your own. \n\nStart with a C major. It's the easiest because there's no flat/sharps. It's C D E F G A B C. Now, take that pattern and move it to a G. So, for C you have:\n\n    C (whole step) D (whole step) E (half step) F (whole step) G (whole step) A (whole step) B (half step) C\n\nAnd, for G you have:\n\n    G (whole step) A (whole step) B (half step) C (whole step) D (whole step) E (whole step) F# (half step) G\n\nDo it on your banjo. Don't read the words and think you understand it. You might mentally understand it, but you'll need to do it over and over until you want to bang your head against the wall to get your fingers to understand it and make it second nature.\n\nNext, move to minor chords. The easiest way to learn minors in my opinion is learning relative minors. Quick and easy, take the root of a major -- i.e. G -- go back three frets --i.e. E -- that's the relative minor. C goes to A, D goes to B, A goes to F#, etc. The major scale is the same notes as the relative minor. So, if you want a Em scale, take a G major scale, start on E and there you go. So, G Major:\n\n    G (whole step) A (whole step) B (half step) C (whole step) D (whole step) E (whole step) F# (half step) G\n\nE minor:\n\n    E (whole step) F# (half step) G (whole step) A (whole step) B (half step) C (whole step) D (whole step) E\n\nThe notes are the same. The start point has just changed. This comes in really handy if you're improvising. For example, say your playing a song in G. You're playing along and thinking \"Ok, I'm going to improvise over this next G.\" Now that you know that Em is the relative minor of G, you can throw in an Em instead of a G and see how it sounds.

{"body": "Glad to help, since all my DUI investigation training and experience is in the State of Florida.\n\nFirst, we can go over the basics and then move on to the three NHTSA exercises, as well as two other exercises that are commonly administered in Florida.\n\nThe most important thing to know is that the actual performance of the exercises is only accounts for part of the overall evaluation. The ability to listen to, understand and follow instructions are also being evaluated. Additionally, the officer will be looking for other clues during the instructional phase of each exercise, such as swaying and slurred speech. An individual will also be asked if they have any medical conditions which may preclude them from performing the exercises.\n\n1. Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) - This exercise is generally the first to be given. It involves having the subject stand with their feet together and hands by their side. They will then be asked to focus on an object (either a pen or a small stick with a light on the end). The object used is then moved back and forth in a prescribed manner. The officer will be looking for three clues during this exercise: The lack of smooth pursuit of the eyes, nystagmus (jerking / fluttering of the eye) while at the maximum deviation from center and nystagmus that is present prior to forty-five degrees of deviation from the center of the eye. **Bonus for Florida**: The HGN is considered a scientific test in Florida and as such is not admissible unless the officer can qualify as an expert in such testing. There are many officers that have the appropriate training to qualify themselves as experts in the HGN exercise, but a vast majority are not able to qualify. Regardless, the other clues present during the instructional phase are still admissible.\n1. Walk and Turn - this exercise is going to mainly measure the ability to perform a divided attention task. During the instructional phase, the individual will be asked to stand on the line with one foot in front of the other and to not start the exercise until told to do so. Instructions are going to be given to take nine heel-to-toe steps down a straight line (masking tape on pavement or perhaps a painted roadway line), turn around and take nine heel-to-toe steps back. The officer is going to be looking for several clues of impairment. The ability to keep balance while listening to the instructions, whether or not the individual begins before the instructions are finished, whether  an individual stops while walking to regain balance, if an individual misses heel-to-toe,  if an individual steps off the line, if an individual uses their arms for balance, whether an individual makes a turn contrary to the instructions, or if an individual takes an incorrect number of steps are all indicators of impairment.\n1. One Leg Stand - During the instructional phase, the officer will tell the individual to stand with their feet together and hands by their side. The officer will instruct the individual not to start until they are told to do so. The officer will instruct the individual to lift one of their feet six inches off the ground and count to thirty (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, etc.). The individual will be instructed not to put their foot down and if they do, to immediately raise the foot again and resume where they left off. The officer will time the individual for thirty seconds. The officer will be looking for clues of impairment such as using arms for balance, hopping to keep balance, swaying while standing on one leg and putting the foot down prior to the completion of the exercise. The aforementioned clues present during the instructional phase also still apply.\n\nTwo other exercises are also commonly used in Florida, although they are not part of the NHTSA standardized exercises. \n\n1. Finger to Nose - The individual will be instructed to stand with their feet together and arms by their side. The individual will also be instructed not to start until told to do so. The officer will instruct the individual that they are to close their eyes and tilt their head back. The officer will instruct the individual to touch the tip of the indicated (left / right) finger to the tip of their nose and then place their hand back at their side (the officer will demonstrate). Once the exercise begins, the officer will usually use the order L R L R R L. The officer will look for clues such as starting the test too early, using the wrong hand, not returning the hand back to the resting position and swaying during the exercise. \n\n1. Romberg Alphabet - The officer will inquire as to the individual's familiarity with the English language and alphabet. The individual will be instructed to stand with their feet together and their arms by their side. The officer will instruct the individual not to start until told to do so. The individual will be told to close their eyes, tilt their head back and recite the alphabet from A - Z (not backwards, which is a common misconception) in a non-rhythmic manner. The officer will be looking for clues such as starting too early, singing the alphabet, swaying during the exercise and missing letters or stopping before reaching the end of the alphabet. \n\nThis is all I can type right now, if you have any follow-up questions, I would be happy to answer them.

{"body": "Technically speaking, if you are playing a D major chord (D F# A, or perhaps more properly a D major triad), the D minor petatonic (D F (natural) G A C) should not fit over that chord. The note F natural in D minor pentatonic is a minor 3rd above D, whereas F# is one of the chord tones of the D major chord. The F and F# would clash and would not sound that great together. I suspect that you are playing D5, or a D power chord instead. D minor pentatonic would work over a D power chord, since the power chord doesn't have a 3rd. The D minor pentatonic scale would then determine the minor character of the music through the note F natural (the minor 3rd of the scale).\n\nThe other D chord that you could play a D minor pentatonic over would be a dominant D chord (for instance, D7, D9, d7#9, etc). Dominant chords are supposed to have some built in tension to them, so some clashing notes actually works OK. For instance, playing a F natural over a D7 chord implies a D7#9 tonality (because #9 = b3 or minor 3rd), which is the famous \"Hendrix\" chord.\n\nAssuming that your chords are actually major chords and not just power chords, it sounds like its a Mixolydian chord progression. This is because in D mixolydian the 7th note of the scale is C natural, which of course is also part of the C chord (the next chord in the chord progression). So D mixolydian (D E F# G A B C) would be a good scale choice. \n\nThe reason why the G major scale (G A B C D E F#) works over the G chord (G B D) is because if you compare the notes with D mixolydian, they are the same! (except in a different order). So basically you are playing D mixolydian when you play G major (also called G Ionian).\n\nTo build some tension, you could try really goofy things, like playing D Lydian (D E F# G# A B C#) over the D major chord. Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, etc. like to do this a lot. The catch is that D lydian doesn't really work for the C chord (because of the C# and the lack of a C natural), so you'd have to switch to a different scale when the chord changes. You could do C Lydian (C D E F# G A B C). But, do you notice that C Lydian is basically the same as D mixolydian/G major? So there is really no getting around the fact that D major -&gt; C major -&gt; G major is essentially a D Mixolydian progression!\n\nOne thing you can do to convince yourself that this is in fact a D Mixolydian progression, is to play your chords over a D bass note drone over all three chords, and jam away with a D mixolydian scale. The D bass note keeps the tonality in D and lets you hear all the color tones of D mixolydian more clearly.\n\nD major pentatonic (D E F# A B) is a subset of D mixolydian so that would work, too.\n\nAll this theory aside, use whatever that works for your ears!!\n\n[edits for clarity and typos]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396028041", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You get exort for last hitting, forges for denying the runes since you don't want the puck you are facing to take them and you aren't supposed to leave your lane for them. You invoke forge first cold snap second so if you invoke sunstrike you can use a second coldsnap later, if it comes to it.\n\nI like to get basil on invoker, you need mana regen and the armor really helps the forges, especially since the nerfs. H4nni style. I also like Midas since levels are incredibly important on invoker. When you feel like a gank is coming, you go to jungle and get a couple of waves until you feel safe to come out. Its so easy to jungle with invoker a few levels in the game so make sure you utilize it. If you go midas, midas a big creep on the hard camp.\n\nWex invoker is more gank oriented, while exort invoker is more \"stay and win your lane, push a tower and help with sunstrike\" kind of hero. That doesn't mean you don't gank at all, but most of the time I don't leave my lane until I get level 9 (this is when you get double forges).\n\nWith double forges and coldsnap you can anihilate a teamfight already, if you get level 10 and get your wex, a deafening blast is quite useful as well, more than it would be if you were wex since it does quite a lot of damage.\n\nTry to utilize your teammates abilities like cogs or big stuns to land sunstrikes. Try to get level 17 as fast as possible because thats when you get your last invoke and can cast many more spells in a teamfight. \n\nThe basic combo once you have some levels is tornado(wait) meteor(wait) def blast.

{"body": "I have some very strong opinions on this, and since you're asking, I'll talk. To forewarn - some of this might sound a bit unusual, but bear with me.\n\nWhen I was younger (although lately I've been getting back into it due to finding likeminded individuals in my local community), I practiced a certain kind of magic. It wasn't theological or mystical in nature as many types of magic are - I consider myself far too skeptical to mess with deities or fae folk. Most people in the magic-using world would call what I do \"cottagecraft\" or similar. It's quite interesting and I encourage anyone curious to look into it.\n\nLet me explain where I'm coming from. In Terry Pratchett's Discworld universe, one of Discworld's foremost witches, Granny Weatherwax, is able to Borrow the bodies of animals--even so, she holds that MOST magic is no more than \"headology\" - her way of referring to what folks in our world would call psychology (especially certain branches thereof). I am personally of the same opinion. In the interest of not automatically discounting the supernatural, since I feel that an essential part of skepticism is the understanding that nothing is strictly impossible, I'm going to say that for most people who practice magic or variations thereof, what they find works best for them is simple ritualized self-determination, self-care, self-comfort and similar.\n\nFor a couple examples, let's look at sigil-making in witchcraft. There are many variations, but the simplest variation of the most popular form of sigil making is as follows:\n\n* Write out your intention on a piece of paper or other material (\"I WILL LOVE WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS\").\n* Eliminate all repeating letters in your statement (\"V H U X P C A N S\").\n* Break the letters down into lines and simple shapes (\"\\ / | - | U \\ / | ) C / - \\ | \\ | ( )\").\n* Arrange the lines and shapes into a single image that feels \"right\" and comfortable for you-no need to be overly simple or overly elaborate if that's not what pleases you.\n* \"Charge\" the sigil, usually by carrying it next to one's skin or heart for a day or more, and reflecting on its message whenever one becomes conscious of its presence (by it rubbing against one's skin or similar).\n* \"Activate\" the sigil. In witchcraft there are lots of ways to do this: you can burn it, tear it to pieces and toss them into flowing water to dispose of them, bury it in a particular place, orgasm over it while focusing on it, or a number of other things.\n\nNow let's consider what the witch in this situation has actually done:\n\n* They've made a clear statement of what they want to do.\n* They've made themselves reflect extensively on their intention and what it means for them.\n* By \"activating\" their sigil, they have made a solemn and undeniable promise to themselves to take their intention seriously, once which absolutely cannot be dismissed by them later if they feel their resolve wavering, because they manifested that promise in a deliberate and physical manner.\n\nThese are all incredibly healthy and effective methods of self-improvement.\n\nI have a point, I promise. Bear with.\n\nOn the subject of \"childish behaviours\" and stuffed animals in particular: In magic, \"talismans\" are a popular notion. Talismans are objects, sometimes specially made, other times completely unintentional, which are infused with the emotions and intentions of the person it belongs to, thus increasing its magical potency. In headological terms, our brains form strong associations with certain objects--whether that's intentional or not. Stuffed animals, safety blankets, etc. are often incredibly powerful talismans. Well-loved stuffed animals brim with positive energy, and even the most staunch skeptics of magic must have had the experience at once or another of picking up a stuffed animal and instantly feeling better. This is normal. This is part of being human. My girlfriend has a stuffed bunny (aptly named Bunny) that goes with her everywhere. Bunny is part of our family, and all of our friends who have met Bunny report instantly noticing their bad feelings eased or their good feelings intensified after giving her a hug. Again, this is common. This is something experienced by almost everyone.\n\nSimilarly, I believe a lot of \"childish behaviours\" - enjoying nostalgic media, thumb-sucking, etc. - can be attributed to what is at its most basic level ritualized self-comfort. Unless it harms themselves or others, it is important, it is valid, and it is something that every human being on Earth does. For those of us with abuse in our pasts, the need for self-comfort is more pronounced and therefore our mechanisms for addressing that need will be more noticeable.\n\nNever feel ashamed for doing these things. It is normal. It is healthy. It is valid. It is a result of being human.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396038005", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, im curious now! I've started by looking at this: https://www.yubico.com/applications/password-management/consumer/keepass/\n\n I'm confident it is a counter-based method as that would be the simplest to implement so I'm going to focus on your 2nd option.\n\nAs a side note, could you not assume that if a hacker has obtained access to your KeePass database then you potentially have lost control of the platform you are running it on, whether that is your physical, network, etc is weak. If you've lost control of the database then you have to assume the passwords are compromised, right?\n\nSo, I looked into how it generates the OTP using OATH-HOTP through the OtpKeyProv plugin, as I think this may be what we're looking for... From the first link I post there is also some initialization that occurs between the YubiKey and a new/existing KeePass database in order to get OTP working. Looking into the OtpKeyProv plugin @ http://keepass.info/plugins.html#otpkeyprov\n\nI downloaded the plugin and took a look at the readme:\n&gt;\n**Generator token secret key and counter. Here you need to provide the current secret key and the counter (which is also called 'moving factor') of the generator token.** These values can be entered in different formats: Hex, Base64, Base32, UTF-8 and Dec.\n&gt;\nNumber of required OTPs. Here you can specify the number of OTPs that need to be entered in order to open the database. The more OTPs, the more secure the database is. See the section 'Security' below for details.\n&gt;\nLook-ahead count. OtpKeyProv supports look-ahead windows. When a number n is specified as look-ahead count, n OTPs may be skipped and opening will still work. For example, if the OTP sequence is A B C D E F G H (where each letter represents a multi-digit OTP), 4 OTPs are required and the look-ahead count is 2, then all of the following OTP sequences will open the database: A B C D, B C D E and C D E F.\n&gt;\nThe default look-ahead count is 0, i.e. only exactly one OTP sequence will work. The higher the look-ahead count is, the less secure the protection of the database is.\n&gt;\n\n**TL;DR** It implements a counter-based 2FA. There is then a specific setup to go through for the YubiKey in which you need to enter your current KeePass secret password in hex, set the amount of OTP you want and your done.\n\nI still don't, and wont entrust my passwords to an application that is inherently vulnerable to an attack. I have a method for create and remembering long passwords and it works.\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396095749", "subreddit": "usenet", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, I'll give this a shot!\n\n**Ionian** is of course, the major scale. Pretty straightforward, sounds happy. In my (very subjective) opinion, most things played in the major scale sound very cheesy/poppy to me unless someone is playing it in a unique way. \n\n**Dorian** is by far my favourite mode to play in. I believe it was an /r/guitar comment that described it this way and I completely agree - Dorian is the minor scale after it's heard some good news. To me the natural 6th adds that tasty bit of flavour to the minor scale that's heard in a lot of rock, folk, blues, and some metal (power metal anyone?). \n\n**Phrygian**, like /u/TheoriesOfEverything said, sounds very flamenco styled to me. In addition, a lot of metal (black metal, death metal, etc etc) and psychedelic rock uses this scale because it's got a certain 'unknown' flavour to it. \n\n**Lydian** sounds like the major scale but much more mysterious to me. A lot of the crazy intense guitarists (Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, those kind of guitarists) use this scale wonderfully to make some very interesting music. Personally, I find it hard to make music around the Lydian mode, it always ends up sounding like something else!\n\n**Mixolydian** is the slightly more gritty major mode to me. The flat 7th makes the mode sound less 'straightforward major scale' and gives it a little extra kick. Lots of styles of music use this mode, including but not limited to pop, rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and folk. I find a lot of rock bands will use this as opposed to Ionian when writing more upbeat songs to retain their edginess factor, haha. \n\n**Aeolian** is the straightforward minor scale, or as I used to call it - the 'metal scale'. Used in tons of different styles of music (not just metal like young me once believed), this is a go-to for sad/melodic type of stuff. \n\n**Locrian** can go fuck itself. Nah, just joking. I've just always felt this mode sounds strange and a bit 'unresolved'. No idea how to use it effectively, probably some intense jazz stuff would suffice. \n\n**DISCLAIMER - IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF MODES, GO NO FURTHER.**\n\nThe major-type modes (Ionian Lydian and Mixolydian) are all diatonic scales built off of the major pentatonic. \n\nThe minor-type modes (Aeolian Dorian and Phrygian) are all diatonic scales built off of the minor pentatonic. \n\nLocrian is built off of minor pentatonic b5. \n\nThis may help you understand the intervals a bit better. Think of the other modes as being built off of the major and minor scales (Ionian and Aeolian respectively). \n\nIonian (#4) = Lydian\n\nIonian (b7) = Mixolydian\n\nAeolian (#6) = Dorian\n\nAeolian (b2) = Phrygian\n\nAeolian (b2, b5) = Locrian\n\nThe awesome thing about the modes is that they all line up in a specific order. That order is Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian (yeah I wrote my thoughts about each one in that order for a reason). What I mean by this is that if you take C Major on the piano and move up 1 note to D, and play the same notes as the C Major scale but starting from D, you now have D Dorian. Go up one more, you now have E Phrygian. One more, F Lydian, so on and so forth. This works this way because of the intervals of each mode. C Major's intervals are W W H W W W H. If you take that first Whole and tack it on the end, you now have W H W W W H (W) &lt;--- that being the first one we moved up. This order of intervals is Dorian. If you move the first interval of that to the end, you have Phrygian. Hopefully you can see where this takes you if you keep moving the first interval to the end. \n\nI hope that helped explain some things, and if anyone smarter than me has any corrections please reply and tear me apart!\n\n**TL;DR** Fuck Locrian.

{"body": "Here we go! Okay so C minor is just the wrong chord and makes no sense harmonically (music theory-wise) in the chord progression. It's often mistakenly heard by people who post up chords on online chord sheets probably because the note \"C\" is in the bass. That doesn't always mean that the bass note is the ROOT note of the chord. In this particular case it's in FIRST INVERSION, so the THIRD of the chord is in the bass. So if there is a chord marking like that [chord]/[note] it means [WHAT THE CHORD IS]/[WHAT NOTE IS IN THE BASS] So for this chord it's B#. So why B# and not C? Well the chord at that given time is G#7. So here are the notes in that chord from root to 7th: G# B# D# F#. 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th scale degree. Scale degrees are always in alphabetical order: A B C D E F G A B C D E F G etc... so let's start on G---&gt; G A B C D E F G. so lets get the 1st 3rd 5th and 7th from that scale order ---&gt; G B D F. But the chord is G# not G(natural) okay so let's put the sharps on --&gt; G# B# D# F#. So if we did this G# C D# F# it will SOUND correct but looking at it on paper and functionally it doesn't make sense because C in the G# scale is a variant on the 4th degree (so C(natural) in G# is flat4).  \n   \n  ___  \n**TL;DR** Using the bass note to always use as the root of the chord is what most people mistakenly do even though it's sometimes not always correct because it could be an inversion.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396157039", "subreddit": "k_on", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have a slightly different take than some here (especially mods).\n\nI'll probably get a lot of down votes for this but i need to be frank with the community.\n\n&gt; Most importantly let me say i am against pirating 100%, if you like a app you should buy it.\n\n&gt; BUT.\n\n&gt; I have to agree.  \n\n&gt; Furthermore and *secondly most important* I also think we should stop randomly accusing anyone we THINK is a pirate just because they run into errors that might also be circumstantial to that of using common pirated repos **like** xsellize and sinfuliphone. Like GPG and other **COMMON** issues. \n\n&gt; As well as stop accusing and moderating people here and on IRC for talking about apps like appsync and tongbu.\n\n&gt; All of these things have **legitimate** purposes. Just because they are ALSO used for pirating paid work(s) doesn't mean we should immediately jump to conclusions and **vilify** the average joe and immediately label him (or her) as pirating copywritten and/or paid work(s)\n\n\n&gt; **It just needs to stop altogether.**\n\n&gt; We should make it a rule. Unless you are blatantly soliciting pirate material all speech about development tools and everything else should be allowed in conversations. \n\n&gt; **AS WELL AS TALKING ABOUT THOSE REPOS THEMSELVES!**\n\n&gt; **We shouldn't have to watch every single letter we type for fear of being labeled a pirate.**\n\n\n&gt; Now that all being said. I own 138 paid tweaks and counting and i implore everyone to be of a help to developers financially because they deserve to be compensated for their hard work too.\n\n&gt; ps: I just also wanted to add i also know about the dangers of DRM as well. And that is a good argument and discussion that should also be heard too. DRM can be hazardous in some situations and its just another reason why i can not blame people for going out of there way to try and cut a alternate path for paid work(s) but at the same time **going the same distance** to make sure developers are compensated for there hard work as well.\n\n\nThe above is my take on piracy discussion in forums.\n\nI think we have a responsibility to allow uncensored discussion about piracy and piracy tools + sources here in this sub.\n\nI also think that the idea that pirate repos hurt developers in the grand scheme of things is complete BS made up by young idealistic moderators that don't pay attention to details and are not PAID tweak developers themselves.  It is nothing more than a romantic (while noble) notion but its dangerous and needs to stop. \n\nEDIT:\n\nBy the way the biggest thing that tipped me over the edge was that i was censored and unable to post about tongbu s' smart icon feature. That is really great if you just used semi-restore or iLexRat on your iPhone, then restored as new but still wanted to download all of your apps &amp; didn't want to use up all your time manually sorting them over again.\n\n\n**TL;DR**:  \n\nI am against piracy. \n\nI still use sources for trial (like most) + also use them to get older versions of tweaks i already own.\n\n (i'm guessin other people do this as well too)\n\nBut still compensate developers for  there work. And am trying to rid myself of all pirated tweaks and sources.\n\nHowever I STILL think **all discussion** about pirating tweaks and how to pirate tweaks should be 100% **allowed** here.\n\n[Yes i said ALLOWED] A L L O W E D\n\nAnd also think direct solicitation about piracy should **not** be allowed at all.\n\n*That's just me.*\n\n\n..\n\n..\n\n..\n\npps: (The following is just my personal view on this matter please take it with a grain of salt)\n\n If cydia ever does enact some kind of trial policy it should be 90 days MINIMUM and the developer should be compensated after a certain period of time within that 90 day period.\n\nCydia should also have a way where we can gift purchases. This would be a big money maker for devs and i'm not sure why cydia doesn't have a easy way of doing this yet.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396233044", "subreddit": "jailbreak", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Our sun is a perfectly ordinary \"G\"-type star, so there are stars out there that are bigger and brighter than our sun and plenty more that are smaller and fainter.\n\nAn added complication is that stars change in brightness over time, particularly towards the end of their lives when they can swell up to many, many times their original sizes.\n\nOf course, how bright they appear from Earth depends on how far away they are as well as their intrinsic brightness. I hope this helps.\n\n(Source: I'd recommend reading the Wikipedia pages on [stellar evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) and perhaps [spectral types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Spectral_types) if you would like some more information. The pages contain many links to further sources of information too.)\n\n(This is my very first post on reddit!)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396278354", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}
