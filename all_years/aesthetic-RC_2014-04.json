{"body": "I agree that the majority of self-pubbed books don't meet that standard and as a consequence will likely be ignored by readers. But as far as marketing goes, there isn't a whole lot done by big publishers anyway. They generally send review copies out with a form letter/publicity release and call it a day. Then they turn around and tell the author to get on social media and start a blog.\n\nBig publisher publicity departments are understaffed and overworked, dealing with hundreds of books over a short period of time. The more the book cost to acquire, the closer to the front of the line it gets.\n\nOtherwise, you're on your own. Just like you are in self-publishing. The difference in self-publishing is that YOU are highly invested in your own book and don't have to wait for permission to try any and all marketing schemes you can think of. If they don't work, you can quickly change gears and try something else.\n\nThat's impossible in traditional publishing, where everything moves s l o w l y . . .", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396310960", "subreddit": "writing", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Example: The Super Hornet's Ball turret can hold weapons sizes 2 - 4.\n\n------\n\n1 -  Here is a list of what each Mount Class is.\n\nNote: Classes 6 &amp; 7 and 8-10 are guesses based on info from the Idris hard points and comments made by Chris Roberts in the 10ftC videos respectively.\n\nClass 1 -&gt; Fix Mount\n\nClass 2 -&gt; Gimbal Mount\n\nClass 3 -&gt; Small Missile Mount\n\nClass 4 -&gt; Unmanned Turret\n\nClass 5 -&gt; Manned turret\n\nClass 6 -&gt; Large Missile Mount\n\nClass 7 -&gt; Small Spinal Mount Weapon System\n\nClass 8-10 -&gt; Capitol Ship Heavy Weaponry\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396319416", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sven is a really Nice Early-Mid game carry and most of the times these days played as a hard carry considering his ult is a free Double damage rune, and he has a very spammable speed and Armour buff. \n\n\nYou're going to want to start by getting Power treads, Drum of Endurance and a Magic wand &lt; 15 minutes\n\nAfter that i suggest rushing a BKB (Black King Bar) so you can actually participate in team fights without getting     stunned and not being able to cast your ult.\n\nIt's usually all situational items from here, Examples:\nMask Of if you think you aren't attacking fast enough in ult.\n\n-Heart if you need to become more tanky\n\n-Assault Cuirass if you want fast attack speed and Armour but also want to help the team.

Do not harass with it.\n\n  Use your stun when enemies are clustered together as it has an AoE.\n\n  If you have someone with arcane boots in the lane, or KoTL THEEN you can spam you're skills because they will just give Mana back (Dont spam too hard if its just someone with mana boots, kotl is much better)\n\nWell, That's all.

{"body": "Interesting question!\n\nI think the reasons we use the major scale are mostly cultural, but whatever the reason, the piano was obviously designed to match the scale.  I don't know the history of the keyboard very well, but this particular arrangement is nice because it's asymmetric within the scale, meaning that it's easy to find any particular note.  If it looked like your example, how would you know which note is, say, C?  That question can be answered, of course: colors.  That's how strings are labeled on the harp.  But the major scale has been the \"default\" for a long time, and the note names came from the major scale.  In old times, there were no other notes; the modes came from those notes, and musical practice of the time might have altered a pitch (like a B into a Bb) for some of the modes, but this wasn't even written down, something we today call musica ficta.\n\nNow, why the major scale and not something else?  Bobby McFerrin has a wonderful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6tB2KiZuk) where he demonstrates the pentatonic scale.  The pentatonic scale also corresponds somewhat to the first nine overtones of the very fundamental overtone scale.  In equal temperament (which wasn't used, of course), the pentatonic scale is five fifths in a row.  Putting together fifths was done even in Pythagorean times.  Anyway, the major scale is an obvious extension of the pentatonic scale -- except it's not so obvious, because the Church used to strongly dislike that extension.  The pentatonic would be C D E G A, but the new notes, F and B, form a tritone, which the Church wasn't a fan of, and those are the most common targets of alterations to fix that tritone in one direction (F#) or another (Bb).  The F and B are also fifths added on either side of the five fifths of the pentatonic, making seven fifths: (... Bb) F C G D A E B (F# ...).\n\nBut I think these are a rationalization of the major scale, which was probably around before.  I don't know the answer, and I think it's cultural.

The first part is just a subjective interpretation of the modes, after that is the theory. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask. I don't mind explaining things more in-depth. \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAlright, I'll give this a shot!\n\n**Ionian** is of course, the major scale. Pretty straightforward, sounds happy. In my (very subjective) opinion, most things played in the major scale sound very cheesy/poppy to me unless someone is playing it in a unique way. \n\n**Dorian** is by far my favourite mode to play in. I believe it was an /r/guitar comment that described it this way and I completely agree - Dorian is the minor scale after it's heard some good news. To me the natural 6th adds that tasty bit of flavour to the minor scale that's heard in a lot of rock, folk, blues, and some metal (power metal anyone?). \n\n**Phrygian**, like /u/TheoriesOfEverything said, sounds very flamenco styled to me. In addition, a lot of metal (black metal, death metal, etc etc) and psychedelic rock uses this scale because it's got a certain 'unknown' flavour to it. \n\n**Lydian** sounds like the major scale but much more mysterious to me. A lot of the crazy intense guitarists (Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, those kind of guitarists) use this scale wonderfully to make some very interesting music. Personally, I find it hard to make music around the Lydian mode, it always ends up sounding like something else!\n\n**Mixolydian** is the slightly more gritty major mode to me. The flat 7th makes the mode sound less 'straightforward major scale' and gives it a little extra kick. Lots of styles of music use this mode, including but not limited to pop, rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and folk. I find a lot of rock bands will use this as opposed to Ionian when writing more upbeat songs to retain their edginess factor, haha. \n\n**Aeolian** is the straightforward minor scale, or as I used to call it - the 'metal scale'. Used in tons of different styles of music (not just metal like young me once believed), this is a go-to for sad/melodic type of stuff. \n\n**Locrian** can go fuck itself. Nah, just joking. I've just always felt this mode sounds strange and a bit 'unresolved'. No idea how to use it effectively, probably some intense jazz stuff would suffice. \n\n**DISCLAIMER - IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF MODES, GO NO FURTHER.**\n\nThe major-type modes (Ionian Lydian and Mixolydian) are all diatonic scales built off of the major pentatonic. \n\nThe minor-type modes (Aeolian Dorian and Phrygian) are all diatonic scales built off of the minor pentatonic. \n\nLocrian is built off of minor pentatonic b5. \n\nThis may help you understand the intervals a bit better. Think of the other modes as being built off of the major and minor scales (Ionian and Aeolian respectively). \n\nIonian (#4) = Lydian\n\nIonian (b7) = Mixolydian\n\nAeolian (#6) = Dorian\n\nAeolian (b2) = Phrygian\n\nAeolian (b2, b5) = Locrian\n\nThe awesome thing about the modes is that they all line up in a specific order. That order is Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian (yeah I wrote my thoughts about each one in that order for a reason). What I mean by this is that if you take C Major on the piano and move up 1 note to D, and play the same notes as the C Major scale but starting from D, you now have D Dorian. Go up one more, you now have E Phrygian. One more, F Lydian, so on and so forth. This works this way because of the intervals of each mode. C Major's intervals are W W H W W W H. If you take that first Whole and tack it on the end, you now have W H W W W H (W) &lt;--- that being the first one we moved up. This order of intervals is Dorian. If you move the first interval of that to the end, you have Phrygian. Hopefully you can see where this takes you if you keep moving the first interval to the end. \n\nI hope that helped explain some things, and if anyone smarter than me has any corrections please reply and tear me apart!\n\n**TL;DR** Fuck Locrian.

{"body": "&gt;I'm still a little confused on how I know what chords work with a scale. Like, do I just look at the notes in the scale and those are the chords that would work?\n\nThe chords and scale go hand in hand. If anything, to me the scale follows what chords are being played, not the other way around. So let's take the progression G, Emi, C, D. The G chord is G B D G B G, the Emi chord is E B E G B E, the C chord is C E G C E, and the D chord is D A D F#. All the notes in these chords make up the G Major scale - which is the scale you play over top of this progression. \n\n&gt;But then how do I know whether its a minor or major chord?\n\nUsing the trick I showed above. If you're playing in Major, the I chord will always be major, the II be minor, the III will be minor, the IV will be major, the V will be major, the VI will be minor, and the VII will be diminished. You can use the devil horns technique I described above to remember these easier. \n\n&gt;does it depend on whether its a minor or major scale?\n\nIf you're trying to find out which chords are major and minor when you're playing in a minor key, just follow the same pattern but start from the VI in major. \n\nSo for example, Emi, the relative minor to G. \n\nI - Emi\n\nII - F#dim\n\nIII - G\n\nIV - Ami\n\nV - Bmi\n\nVI - C\n\nVII - D\n\nSo a I - IV - V progression would go Emi, Ami, Bmi.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396399920", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This doesn't explain where the convention came from but it should hopefully add some context.  \n\nIn western music, scales are built on any of several patterns of whole tones and semitones (whole steps and half steps.) This is a construct that has existed ages before the major/minor scale dichotomy that we know today.\n\nThe modes we have today are:\n\nIonian (major), Aeolian (minor), Dorian, Lydian, Phrygian, Locrian, and Mixolydian.\n\nYou'll notice that if we only have whole steps and half steps to work with, and we want seven unique notes in the scale (e.g. A B C D E F G), then there has to be exactly two half steps in there somewhere. All the modes differ from each other by where in the sequence the two half steps are. For example, the major mode is:\n\n    Whole Whole Half Whole Whole Whole Half\n\nwhereas the minor mode scale is:\n\n    Whole Half Whole Whole Half Whole Whole\n\nAt some point in history it was enforced by convention that we would name pitches so that a C scale in the major mode would have no sharps or flats. So for that to make sense, we need half steps to fall in the right place: between E and F, and between B and C. \n\nIt might also help to realize that if we didn't have half steps built into our naming convention, there would be no mode/scale without sharps or flats, and determining what key music is written in would become considerably more complicated.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396403490", "subreddit": "answers", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "E V E R Y T H I N G\n\nhere is my reasoning:\n\n1) Most important reason is... people should be free to consume anything they desire. Just because some people can't handle doing drugs responsibly does not mean everyone should be punished for it. We are adults, and are capable of making our own decisions.\n\n2) Due to the prohibition of certain substances, enormous criminal networks have come into power in order to supply a demand that legitimate businesses cannot, which have essentially taken over Mexico, and central America. Other huge networks exist all over the world, and organizations, such as the Taliban make most of their money via heroin production. It is disgusting what is going on south of the American border. [The shit on this website should give you some kind of idea of what the war on drugs is doing to people who are not lucky enough to live in the country that consumes the drugs, instead they have to deal with the consequences themselves](http://www.elblogdelnarco.info/). By legalizing drugs, we would effectively put these organizations out of business.\n\n3) Because drugs are illegal, their quality is hit or miss, and there is no way to ensure the drugs are safe. Of course drugs can be dangerous if taken to the extreme, but a pure product, such as meth or MDMA, is a lot less harmful for someone than, say, meth made with battery acid, or the many impurities that are present in other street drugs. Not to mention the danger that clandestine drug labs pose to communities.\n\n4) Because certain substances are illegal, people are turning to new, often times dangerous, experimental chemicals such as the stuff found in K2/Spice, or bath salts. People want to get high, and will find ways to get high whether drugs are illegal or not. The situation we have right now only makes it more dangerous, and risky for people to do so.\n\n5) Millions of non-violent, and otherwise law abiding people have been/are imprisoned, and/or have had their plans de-railed simply for trying drugs. There is a guy serving a life sentence in prison right now for possession of LSD, while murderers are rapists are set free.\n\n6) Because of the war on drugs, trillions of dollars have been spent trying to combat the made up crime of drug use, while other more important issues, such as poverty, research, or more damaging crimes have not received anywhere near as much attention.\n\n7) Finally, study after study has been released showing beyond any shadow of a doubt that the war on drugs has been a colossal failure. Drug use, and availability has only increased since it has begun, and other countries/societies that have made strides towards legalizing drugs via decriminalization have actually seen drug use decrease.\n\n[This guy can articulate it all better than me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8yYJ_oV6xk)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396468087", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So many. The game is so well composed. \n\nBut there are two that stand out to me. The first is the short opening theme, not the whole opening credits. Just the part when \"E A R T H B O U N D\" comes in from the sides. That little clip, combined with this big introduction, just says \"HERE IT IS! WE *PROUDLY* PRESENT THE MASTERPIECE THAT IS....... *EARTHBOUND*\". It establishes the epic cinematic feel that is present throughout much of the game. Be been thinking lately about what an Earthbound movie would be like, and if you filmed the whole scene, doing a cold open of Ness in bed, a mysterious crashing noise, and him, Pokey, and the dog running up the hill past cops to this strange wreckage, and out of the smoke in the crater rises the form of the Starman, and then POW, that exact opening title comes in. It just feels so cinematic. It tells you that the game you're about to play is no ordinary game, but rather an epic story that grabs you by the arm and pulls you straight in. It's all build-up, to a huge crescendo, and that awesome title screen. Like the ending to *A Day in the Life*, y'know, that huge arrhythmic orchestral build, each individual instrument climbing the full range their instrument can perform at a rhythm independent to everyone around them, making sure they make it last note at the end of the 20th measure, and when they all hit the peak at the same, wait a beat, and then BOOM-- the final Eb chord that gets smashed as hard and loud as possible. That's what this small 50 second song makes me think of. It's an epic introduction that leads you in with full build up, but unlike A Day in the Life where it perfectly wraps up the album, this one doesn't resolve. It just leaves you hanging. And all that's left to do is press start.  \n\nThe second is the theme from Threed *after* you clear the zombies. It has such an interesting composition to it, and it has a very unique feel in its movements. It's tough to describe, but I really like how it just feels.... Different. The other songs, including the first song in Threed, feel like they fit. They're songs you would expect from that area. You hear something like the theme from Onett and it evokes a feeling of a quiet small town- which is exactly what Onett is. You hear the first song in Threed, it's really spooky and creepy- also exactly what it is. But when you clean up Threed, the sun is out and everything is nice, except for the fact that there are still creepy circus things, huge dead trees, and half the town is still a graveyard. This whole motif really fit with the dark colors, and the gloomy music. But with the colors that come in now, it feels like a summer evening over this once scary town. The people are getting used to regaining their freedom. And the music evokes this mysterious feeling of change, and with its falls and lifts, it kind of follows the life of the town itself. It has dark minor keys, strange sevenths that subtly surprise you (but by this point we are VERY used to surprises), lifting into a major feel, and leading up to an unexpected resolution. Kind of like that chapter of the story itself. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396569350", "subreddit": "earthbound", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A key is the same in all music, not just guitar music.\n\nFirst off, all of this is a guideline. It's totally fine to bend or break rules in music, if it's the sound you want to make. A key tells you what notes you can play in a song and still sound 'good.' All keys have one of every note, but some of the notes in most keys have to be sharp or flat (ie raised or lowered by one semi-tone/fret) to fit the key. C major and A minor have no such notes, and are just A B C D E F and G. The key of G has one sharp in it, and goes G A B C D E F#. B-flat has two flats in it, and goes Bb (the lower case b means flat) C D Eb F G A. Typically, if you want a song to sound happy the whole way through, you stick to a major key. Sad, you stick to a minor key. For exotic sounds, you either write in a different kind of key, or write in a major/minor key and borrow notes from outside of it. Like I said, the rules are allowed to be broken, so it's totally fine to write a song that's 99% in G major, but includes an F natural a few times because it's the sound you want to make. Keys are more of a descriptive tool than a restrictive rule, but for the most part it's a good idea to stick with them, as they do tend to sound pretty good. \n\nKeys are also very useful for determining what chords will sound good together and what notes will sound good for a solo. Again, these are more guidelines than anything strict or set in stone, but they're helpful. \n\nHow do you choose a key? Well on guitar, often it's because of the position of the chords you're going to be playing. G is popular because there are a lot of open chords (G, C, Em, Am, and D, for example) in that key. Sometimes you change the key to match an instrument better. For example, while it's easy to change key on piano or guitar, a saxaphone doesn't have the same luxury, so in a song with one of those, you may write the key around what sounds best on sax. Additionally, sometimes the sound of the instrument changes when you play it in different keys. A guitar will sound much more resonant when played in the lower registers compared to if you play with a capo on it, so depending on the sound you want, you may choose one or the other. A folk song might use a capo to get a twangier sound, while a punk song might play in standard tuning using low E chords to get a chrunchier, dirtier sound. The final reason you might write in a given key is to match a singer. People have well-defined vocal ranges, and some will sound better in certain keys. I know I prefer to sing in the key of G because my voice sounds good when singing in it. Many other keys are either so low that I have to use my lower registers, which are not as loud for me, or so high that either I have to strain my voice to reach the high notes or sing it a full octave lower, bringing me back to problem one. \n\nSome people also claim that different keys have different feelings to them, like some of them are going to be sadder or happier than others, but honestly I've never felt that way. To my ear, if you played the same progression twice but put a capo five frets higher the second time, I doubt I could tell them apart unless you played them right next to each other.

{"body": "A game is always defined by the obstacles that you have to overcome. Rules, enemies, resources. \n\nA game that just keeps your score is boring if the score has absolutely no meaning. A leaderboard is probably the weakest motivation here, especially if you do not know the others. Achievements are a bit better, as they make you look at your score from time to time. But a real obstacle would be always present in your thinking - if for example you continuously keep running out of money (because hard mode actually is hard), you spend more time thinking about better words, thus you are more and continuously engaged in the game.\n\nI would think that hard mode could be a lot harder, making surviving the round a challenge. At the same time, the game should guarantee that a solution is possible.

{"body": "Here's why writing in letter names is detrimental:\n\nWhen a student starts out reading music, they often feel pressured to make fast progress.  So they write in the letter names of notes and then ignore the notes while reading the letters they've written in.\n\nIf you look at most method books, they give you very few notes to start out with and then *gradually* add more.  So your first exercise might be \"C C C C.\"  Then they'll add a D along the way, and an E, and so on.  If you're slow and careful, you complete these exercises and by the end recognize the notes directly on the staff.  Most students try to rush through this process.  If they lack self-discipline or a careful teacher, they'll simply gloss over these foundational steps.\n\nThe human brain is really really good at seeing patterns.  It's something we can do very quickly.  If you stick with music long enough and put the time in, you really start to see the patterns in music.  If you've practiced your scales and you come across a piece of music where you see \"C D E F G A B C,\" you can recognize that as a C major scale instead of seeing each note individually.  This allows you to process things faster.  Intervals, chords, arpeggios, and scales are all building blocks that you'll learn to recognize directly.\n\nIt's incredibly to your benefit to stop writing in letter names, rewind five years and put in some work on the fundamentals.  It doesn't have to be boring and it doesn't have to take a large chunk of your daily practice!  You can find apps now that show you a note on the grand staff and quiz you on it.  You can grab some staff paper, close your eyes, and hit a random note on the piano.  Then look at that note and see how fast you can write it on the grand staff.  You can write out a melody away from the piano, and then come back and play it.\n\nYour teacher is right to discourage you from writing in letter names.  It's a handicap and it will hold you back in music.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396615208", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Yeah, you need to solve the 'root' problem first. \n\nSome chords will actually have a \"pedal\" tone below the root. That's where you can end up with chords like 1-2-5-b7 because you're calling 1 the root instead of 5. So, if this is a C D G Bb chord, we would actually consider reordering these pitches so that the triad is clear - in this case the triad is G Bb D and the C is a pedal tone in the bass. This might be notated as G-/C meaning a G minor triad over C. That the D occurs below the G in the voicing of the chord doesn't matter. You simply have to identify the triad first to establish what pitch is the root. It's not always going to be in the bass voice. \n\nGood luck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396616516", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

First we would reorder these pitches to the closest approximate location to each other within an octave (without changing the bass pitch). Essentially, your program needs to determine how to order these across an array of all pitches, and I think you'll need an algorithm that essentially assigns numeric values to the upper pitches in relation to the lowest (fundamental) pitch. \n\nYou could do this with a 12 point system in a Binary array where: Undefined Pitch = 0, A = 1, Bb = 2, B = 3, C = 4... G = 11, Ab = 12. Something like this could allow you to use pointers across the array to assign temporary values to each pitch of input that you can then operate on to create a final 'reduction' to the triad. I imagine the operation on GDAF might go like this: \n\n* G is our reference point, so every time G would occur (think in multiples of 12, so G would occur at 11, 23, 35, 47, etc...), we have to add 12 to the value of our next pitch. Since D = 6 &lt; G = 11, we're going to add 12 to D (so D = 6+12). G = 11, D = 18. Now, A = 1 &lt; D = 18, so we have to add 12 twice. G = 11, D = 18, A = 25. Finally, F = 9 &lt; A = 25, but we still only need to add 12 twice to get F = 33 &gt; A = 25. So, these are the starting numerical values of our chord. All I'm really doing is 'incrementing' each pitch's value by 12 until it is greater than the value of the previous pitch. \n\n* A triad won't extend beyond an interval value of 7. This means that between any two pitches, if you have a value &gt; 7, subtract 12 from the value of the pitch. F(33) - A(25) = 8, so subtract 12 from the value of F since it's greater than 7. A(25) - D(18) = 7, so no operation needed. D(18) - G(11) = 7, so no operation needed. Our reduced placement of pitches, in order, is now G(11), D(18), F(21), and A(25).\n\n* Our final step is to find where major and minor thirds exist. These values are 4 and 3 respectively. D(18) - G(11) = 7, so NOPE. F(21) - D(18) = 3, BINGO! Minor third. A(25) - F(21) = 4, BINGO! Major third. The interval sequence between these notes is G (up 7 to) D (up 3 to) F (up 4 to) A. Then we point to the first pitch where the interval of either 3 or 4 exists, and that gets us our root.\n\nSo, now we have our triad consisting of a Minor third followed by a Major third with a 'Root' pointer pointing to D. This gives us a D Minor triad over G. The chord symbol is D-/G. This same process can also be used to find the interval spacing of 7ths, 9ths, and so on. But this is how I would do it. Feel free to use this approach if you'd like. All you have to do is figure out the syntax of your programming language to implement the functionality (which I just suck at because I haven't written code for a couple of years now). But I think this will give you what you need. \n\nEDIT: Because this is interesting, I thought about some test cases to see if the code can be tweaked further. \n\n* B G F D: B=3, G=11, F=21, D=30. REDUCE: D(30)-F(21)&gt;7, D(18); F(21)-G(11)&gt;7, F(9); G(11)-B(3)&gt;7, G(-1); D(18)-F(9)&gt;7, D(6). REDUCED Result: G(-1), B(3), D(6), F(9). INTERVAL Check: B(3)-G(-1)=4, M3; D(6)-B(3)=3, m3; F(9)-D(6)=3, m3. RESULT: G7/B. Notice that our root, G, sets to a value of -1, so you'll need some kind of IF statement where you add 12 to values &lt; 1 (remember that 0 is undefined as well). Simple solution would be to add 12 to everything before reducing down to the triad to avoid the problem altogether. \n\n* C G C E B: C=4, G=11, C=16, E=20, B=27. REDUCE: B(27)-E(20)=7, Nothing; E(20)-C(16)=6, Nothing; C(16)-G(11)=5, Nothing; G(11)-C(4)=7, Nothing. So, this breaks the existing algorithm (infinite loop of sorts). The trouble is that doubled 'C', so maybe we need to check for duplicate pitches. We would ignore C=16 since we already have C=4. Assuming you find a way to do this, we could theoretically get to a point where we compare E(20)-G(11)&gt;7, and get E(8). Then through the next loop of operation, we'll find B(27)-E(8)&gt;7 and reduce B to 15. Ultimately, this is a CMaj7 chord. We just need the order to be C(4), E(8), G(11), B(15) to get there. \n\n* A E G D B: This is an Asus9 chord. The trouble is that we might end up with a chord symbol of E7/A (a valid chord, but that's not necessarily the right chord symbol). In this case, the chord ought to reduce down to A(1), D(6), E(8), G(11), B(15). You need a way to establish that the A(1) to D(6) that gives you 5 is a Sus interval. So, think about a case that checks for this before declaring a Root of E7/A if you want sus chord symbols. Maybe a check for an interval value of 5 above the bass would be possible here. Technically, an E7/A is valid, but I believe we would more often call this an Asus9. This will also depend on the chords before and after this chord. In progression logic, this would be an Asus9 if the chord before it was an E and the chord following it was a D chord. This would be a typical ii-V-I progression in D. \n\nAnyway, it's not foolproof, but it's a start.

{"body": "It sounds like you're just finding the wrong kind of information; materials that assume understanding of some fundamentals that you haven't learned yet.  You just need a more basic starting point, and then everything will make a lot more sense.  Maybe I can help you out.\n\nThere should be no debate about what notes comprise a C major scale.  They are simply C D E F G A B (C).  In other words, all the notes with no sharps or flats.  The white keys on a piano.  Do re mi fa so la ti do is the major scale.  If \"do\" is C, then it's C major.\n\nPlay a basic C major scale in the simplest possible way:  C to C in the open position.  5th string / 3rd fret is C, so that's \"do.\"  Fret it with your ring finger and play that note.  Next is D = open 4th string, E = 4th string / 2nd fret (middle finger), F = 4th string / 3rd fret (ring), then G = open 3rd string, A = 3rd string / 2nd fret (middle), then B = open 2nd string, and ending with the high C = 2nd string / 1st fret (index finger).\n\nThat should be the first \"scale\" exercise you learn.  You should recognize the \"do-re-mi-...\" sound, or if you don't, it will be familiar soon.   You can sing (just in your head is OK) do-re-mi-... as you play, and also the note names (C-D-E...).  You'll become more comfortable with the sound of the scale and the positions of different notes on the fretboard this way.  Play that same scale ascending (low C to high C) and then descending.\n\nFrom here, there are many directions in which to build your knowledge.  So far you've only played the C major scale in one octave, but that \"high\" C is also the \"low\" C of the next octave and vice versa.  You can play notes from the other octaves (starting with the low open E), you can play the C major scale in different positions (3rd position would probably come next), and of course you can learn different scales.\n\nThe fingering position diagrams are useful, but I would suggest learning the positions of the notes on the fretboard first (start with the 0~5 position).  Then if you know how major scales are built you can figure out how to play any major scale on your own, and it will make a lot more sense.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396629354", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Spectre isn't about farming creeps--she's about farming *heroes*. She can't farm jungle until well after it's not as profitable, and she can't really farm ancients. \n\nSkimming through the skill builds from TI3, they seem to vary. One game, Loda goes q w q e q r w w w q and in a different game, Hao leveled dispersion at level 2, after dagger(gross), yet they won. In the 46 minute game, Illidan goes q e www r w e q r w e q q. They lost, but after 46 minutes. Black went e(grooooooss) w q w w r w q q q and won in 41 minutes. Hao went dagger first(with dispersion skilled at level 2 =( ). Burning maxes dagger then desolate. Zhou skilled dispersion at level one(again, gross), then maxed dagger then desolate. Last three games I looked at maxed dagger. \n\nThese builds seem all over the place, and I'm really curious if there's any worthwhile reason to level dispersion first, because prima facie, there is none. I can't see any situation where, at level 1, 10% dispersion damage of 511~ health is going to be more worthwhile than a dagger to escape. \n\nIMO, Spectre excels as a split pusher(to get her farm)who has a reliable and readily available escape and can join the team for any teamfight. The only real way to stop it is to go after Spectre herself, which allows the rest of her team to push unharassed. Phase, drums, oov allows her to ensure that her illusions can get that desolate damage on enemies during her ult. At level 6, she's putting out 100+ damage(without any items) on any isolated heroes, which makes her MUCH more dangerous early-midgame. She has a great midgame presence that can transition into late game very well, but I feel that a lot of people waste this potential by tunneling on the rads rush, even in competitive. \n\nIf you can get a fast drums and see yourself finishing rads by 18-20, it's not the worst thing ever. You're still going to be pretty fragile, but it's an alright time, unless the other team is already knocking on your T3. I feel like people are too attached to it and refuse to abandon rads for something else, however, despite a few deaths and the projected completion time turning into 25-30 minutes. At that point, getting rads fucks you and your team in more ways than one. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396632982", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Scales and modes are different musical worlds from one another.  Take, for example, C major (C D E F G A B C) and D dorian (D E F G A B C D).  C major is a major mode -- the I chord is C E G, C major -- while D dorian is a minor mode -- the i chord is D F A, D minor.  The dorian mode is famous for having a kind of hopeful quality, since the i chord is minor while the IV chord is major.  So when you play Dm - G in D dorian, you have this infusion of joy from the G major chord in an otherwise minor mode.\n\nBut comparing C major and D dorian is like comparing my apple to your apple.  My apple is here and your apple is not.  So let's move my apple to where yours is and compare C major with C dorian.  Here's the list of modes, starting on C:\n\nC lydian: C D E F# G A B C\n\nC ionian: C D E F G A B C\n\nC mixolydian: C D E F G A Bb C\n\nC dorian: C D Eb F G A Bb C\n\nC aeolian: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C\n\nC phrygian: C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C\n\nC locrian: C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C\n\nThese are arranged in order from brightest to darkest, which is also the order of accidentals -- lydian has one sharp, ionian has nothing, mixolydian one flat, dorian two flats, aeolian three, phrygian four, locrian five.  Basically, things get more \"minor\" as you go down and more \"major\" as you go up.  Try playing around in each of these (caution: locrian is weird), but don't change the tonic.  Stay in C, but vary the mode.  Try not to fall into the relative major -- when you're in C phrygian, for example, try not to sound like you're in Ab major (for example, Eb7 - Ab sounds an awful lot like Ab major, while Bbm6 - Cm sounds more C phrygian).\n\nIt turns out that C major and D dorian have the same notes, and this is a useful thing to be careful of when you want to switch between them because it's harder to make a real distinction between a section in one mode and a section in another mode with the same notes.

The A minor scale is as follows:\n\nA B C D E F/F# G/G# A\n\nThe G# variant is used harmonically -- which is why it's in the harmonic minor scale -- specifically in the V chord, which is E (or E7 or some other variant).  The F# and G# are both used melodically when the melody goes up to the A, since the G#, the leading tone, has more pull towards the A, and F to G# creates an augmented second.  Note that in modern music, people don't particularly care about that; the augmented second is fine and resolving the G up to A is also fine.  Common Practice music, however, always raises the G to G#, and if it's used in a melodic line, the F is almost always raised to F# to avoid that augmented interval.\n\nIn that sense, the natural minor scale is misleading.  It's the \"default\", in a sense, but it's never actually used; the harmony always comes from harmonic minor and the melody from melodic minor.  The natural minor scale really only comes out for bIII and bVII chords, which are basically a tonicization of the relative major.  If you ever see the minor v chord (in Common Practice music), it's almost definitely either part of a sequence or a modulation.\n\nAs for why it's 'allowed' (I'm glad you put that in scare quotes), obviously, *anything* is allowed.  The key isn't a rule to follow; it's a theme for the composition -- what it's about, in a sense.

The C major scale is made up of all the natural notes from C to C.  \n\nC D E F G A B C \n\nIn this case the C is scale degree one, D is scale degree two, E is three and so on.  \n\nAll of the scale degrees make an interval off of the root (in this case the root is C)\n\nFrom C to C is a unison (it's the same note) \n\nC to D is a Major Second\n\nC to E is a Major Third\n\nC to F is a Perfect fourth \n\nC to G is a Perfect fifth \n\nC to A is a Major Sixth\n\nAnd C to B is a Major Seventh\n\nAll of the intervals have there own unique sound and being able to identify them by ear can be super beneficial (in my opinion it's what makes a good musician a great musician).\n\nAll Major scales will follow the intervals listed above.  Minor scales share the perfect intervals but the others differ.  \n\nIf you are a math guy you might really like delving into music theory.  I would suggest taking a couple lessons to get you on the right track.  \n\nAnd never say you're not talented.  Talent comes with time and hard work.

{"body": "&gt; My assumption that the C major scale is natural and basic and your assumption that the A minor scale is natural and basic is based on the arrangement that the piano is already in.\n\nThe other way around. The piano is designed to emphasize the major scale because the major scale was already considered important before the piano was invented.\n\nSo the real question is \"What is special about the major scale?\" Part of it is up to history, but I can explain one possible justification for the major scale.\n\nLet's imagine we're building a scale from scratch. We don't know anything about what scales already exist, so we have infinitely many frequencies to use. Where should we start?\n\nLet's start with the idea that two notes an octave apart sound really similar, so we'll give them the same letter name. We'll try to build a scale that fills in one octave, and then repeats when you move up to the next octave.\n\nNow let's just pick a note to start our scale on. We'll call that note F, but since we're picking just one note out of infinitely many, this is completely arbitrary. So now we have a one-note scale, which isn't very interesting... How should we add new notes into the scale? What should the basic rule be?\n\nHere's the rule we'll use: the interval called the \"perfect fifth\" is a special-sounding interval, like an octave. So we'll build our scale by starting on a note, then going up a perfect fifth, and adding the new note into our scale.\n\nSo we've got F, then we go up a perfect 5th, which gives us C. Then we go up another perfect fifth again, which gives us G. Then D, A, E, B, F#, C#, G#, and so on.... possibly to infinity. \n\nSo how do we decide how many notes is \"enough\"? We could have a 3 note scale that goes F G C F, or a 4 note scale that goes F G C D F, and so on. So how many notes do we want?\n\nSo here's an idea: let's stop when we get back to the note we started on. We started on F, so let's just keep adding new notes till we get another F.\n\nBut here's a problem: we'll never get back *exactly* to where we started, for mathy reasons that we'll gloss over. But we do get *close* to where we started, after we add 12 notes. F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# X. The note \"X\" is really close to an F, only about 1/5 of a half step away from F. If we say \"Ok, 1/5 of a semitone is close enough, we'll stop here,\" we get 12 notes, and that gives us the chromatic scale. (This is why pianos have 12 notes total in one octave.)\n\nBut 12 notes is a lot, and maybe we don't want so many. So we need to be more flexible. Instead of saying \"1/5 of a semitone is close enough\" we need to say some other distance is close enough.\n\nWe could say that a half step is \"close enough,\" in which case we would stop after just 5 notes: F C G D A, but then the next note (E) is just a half step from F, so we'll stop before adding it. This gives us a 5-note scale, which is the very popular pentatonic scale (CDEFG).\n\nOr, if we want something just a *tiny bit* smaller (still approximately the size of a half step, but a little bit less), we could stop after 7 notes: F C G D A E B, but then the next note (F#) is a small semitone above where we started, so we'll stop before adding it. That gives us the 7-note scale that we know as the \"major\" or \"diatonic\" scale: CDEFGAB.\n\nDoes that make sense? This is easier to explain while drawing on paper or a chalkboard, so don't feel bad if I've explained it poorly. I'd be happy to try to clarify if you have questions.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1396847778", "subreddit": "ELI5Music", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;When an English speaker hears the term alphabet, they tend to think of all the properties that the English alphabet has.\n\nYou're right, it's not redundant, it's just meaningless.  A better stab at defining an alphabet is an ordered catalog of characters conveying phonetic meaning.  We can't call them phonemes, the alphabet and actual sounds of English don't consistently match up at a one-to-one ratio.  For example, /ʃ/ takes two letters (\"sh\") to be conveyed.\n\nI already explained why the difference you pointed out before wasn't significant.  The other two you've just listed are, yeah, different from the English alphabet, but don't by any means make the kana system un-alphabet-like.  I think you expect an English speaker to expect an alphabet to look and function exactly the same as they do in European languages.  \n\nI think if we tried to make it look more like one, we'd be looking at five vowels (/a i ɯ e o/) and 14 consonants (/k g s z t d n h b p m y r w/).  Like English most of these have allophones for special environments (/s/+/i/=[ʃi]).  Similar to English, not all phonemes can be produced with just one character (/ja/=じ＋ゃ).\n\nIt's a pretty close match, where it counts.  I'm pretty sure I study linguistics, and I'm almost as sure you don't.  I'm also pretty sure you haven't studied second language acquisition, which I'm pretty sure I am.  Your arguments have been pretty consistent throughout in that you're positing the same point over and over under the assumption that it will completely confound an English NL Japanese learner.  You're entitlted to your opinion, I guess, the same way I'm entitled to analyze the question and demonstrate the efficacy of proposed solutions.

We got along great as buddies and flirted all the time. \n\nOne day we were hanging out after school goofing off, like kids do. I saw it coming a mile away and tried to avoid it a little bit, but after wrestling and cuddling there I was, on my back on the ground, staring up and him... And he kissed me. A friend came and picked us up a little while later and that's the story of my first kiss.\n\nOh, wait. This is a first time with sex thread! Well, that happened just a few days later.\n\nThat kiss must have set things off for me. A whole new world was opened up. A world of touch, and sensation and lil tingly feelings in the tips of my toes and all over my body. I wanted more. And damn it, I was going to get it.\n\nI dressed up for school that day. I thought I looked cute in my knee high socks, pleated skirt and sky high heels, but looking back, I probably looked like a 16 yr old porn star, which is exactly how I felt. I was H O R N Y baby, and I was gona get mine!\n\nSo I cornered my friend after theatre class (because we were both big theatre geeks) and told him to hang around the auditorium instead of going to lunch. We went into the green room, onto these soft squishy smelly couches and started making out. \n\nI liked it. \"More more more!\" My body screamed. Now, for most people, getting 'more' out of their very second time making out only means more kissing. Not for me. I started undoing his pants. \n\nI'll spare the embarrassing details here, but we went thru the standard first time 'is it in yet?' 'What now?' 'Am I doing this right?' Sort of awkwardness. But just was we were getting on a role....\n\nThe janitor walks in. \n\nI shit you not, reddit, it was straight out of a movie. Who is that lucky, whose life inhibits cartoon land so much that their very first time doin the durty they get walked in on by a total stranger?? Just this chick.\n\nHe was cool about it tho. He was in one door- \"you kids about finished? Ok bye\" - and out another before we had time to respond. After a moment of frozen shock, we threw our clothes on, ran out of there, and avoided each other for a few weeks. \n\nAnd that, my friends, is how I lost my virginity.

{"body": "Did you try Fake Dr Levin's \"Music Theory From The Ground Up\"?  \n\nLesson 1 covers whole steps, half steps, notes, and a few other helpful things.  Lesson 2 talks about how keys are formed.  \n\nJust those two lessons alone gave me a few hours jam session.  Try and sit back and absorb the information, it will come slow at first but become more natural the more you do it and actively study it.  It's only around 20-30 minutes for the first two lessons, and it just requires listening and paying attention pretty much.  \n\nIf you know how to tune by ear (Google is your friend if you don't, I know when I was a beginner it took me a little while to google it since I didn't really know it was a thing until I watched my Grandpa do it a few times and just thought he had magic tuning ears until I saw what he was doing), or that the 6th fret on the E string and the 1st fret on the next string are the same, you can play the scales on one string and then work your way up following the same pattern once you work out what notes go in the scale and what notes go on the next string.\n\nThis will allow you to condense your scales from being on one string to a sort of box, across all 6 strings that you can follow up and down.  \n\nA more logical approach to dissecting scales is to just find the notes in a mathematical form, using the major scale formula (WWhWWWh, W = Whole Step, h = Half Step; a half step is 1 fret, a whole step is 2 frets).  Once you find that the C Major scale is C D E F G A B C, the 8th note (C) being the same as the 1st, you can apply the 1 - 2 -3 -4 -5 -6- 7 rule of major scales to the guitar neck, going up a Whole Step, Whole Step, Half Step, Whole Step, Whole Step, Whole Step, Half Step.  \n\nAll of the notes are as follows:\n\nA **-** A# / Bb **-** B **-** C **-** C# / Db **-** D **-** D# / Eb **-** E **-** F **-** F# **-** G **-** G# / Ab **-** A\n\nNote that the sharps and flats are the same note; what name you would actually call the note depends on how you are actually using it, and the names of the notes in that scale.  Also, there is no B# or Cb, or E# or Fb, they are the same notes, but sometimes may be referred to as Fb depending on the usage.\n\nIf you look up on Google Images for a \"guitar fretboard notes chart\" or something similar, there are a bunch of charts online.  You want a \"Standard Tuning\" chart, since the actual location of the notes depends on your tuning.  An open E string to the first fret is an F note, the next is an F#, the next is a G, the next is a G#, and so on.  \n\nSince the Major scale follows WWhWWWh, and you now know how to find the notes on the guitar neck using half steps and the order of the notes (if you don't you can study this), and a Major scale follows a 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7, let's say for example you wanted to play the D Major scale.  \n\nLet's start from D for the sake of starting from the 1 on this chart:\n\nD **-** D# / Eb **-** E **-** F **-** F# / Gb **-** G **-** G# / Ab **-** A **-** A# / Bb **-** B **-** C **-** C# / Db **-** D\n\nNow for the sake of readibility, let's remove the Sharps and just re-write the order:\n\nD **-** Eb **-** E **-** F **-** Gb **-** G **-** Ab **-** A **-** Bb **-** B **-** C **-** Db **-** D\n\nSince you go WWhWWWh for your 1 - 2 - 3 -4 -5 -6 -7, you want to go:\n\nD **-** E **-** Gb **-** G **-**A **-** B **-** Db **-** D\n\nNow you just plug those notes into your neck and you have the entire fretboard for the D Major scale / B relative minor.  \n\nBasically, a relative minor uses the same exact notes as the it's relative major scale, but it has a different emphasis on the chord triads (chords are covered in the later \"fake Dr Levin\" tutorials).  All you need to know for now is that you focus on the 1 - 3 - 5 triad for your licks, or put more emphasis on the 1, the 3, and the 5 (back to the 1 -2 -3 4- 5 -6 -7).  Your licks will sound best when they end on those notes, you can add vibrato, slides, hammer ons, etc. for tonal variation.\n\nTo find the relative minor to your major scale, start on the 6th note of your scale. \n\nTo find a relative Major from a Minor scale, you start on the 3rd note in the scale. \n\nLets apply the above to find the relative Minor of C Major (and reverse our answer to show the opposite rule):\n\nC Major:\n\nC **-** D **-** E **-** F **-** G **-** **A** **-** B \n\nRelative Minor: A Minor (6th note is A, so this is A Relative Minor)\n\nA Minor Scale: \n\nA **-** B **-** **C** **-** D **-** E **-** F **-** G\n\nThe 3rd note in this minor scale is C, so C is our relative Major. \n\n\n**Re-cap:**, you have notes, with Flats/Sharps between all of them except for the B and C, and E and F.  \n\nYou use WWhWWWh for the Major Scale, which gives us the basic 1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7.  \n\nNow in order to do a natural minor scale (referred to my father who is a fellow musician and has been playing piano 30+ years as \"true minor\", or just \"minor\", you take your Major Scale, and you do the following:\n\n1 - 2 - 3b - 4 - 5 -6b -7b \n\nYou just flat the 3rd, 6th, and 7th note in your scale (down 1 fret) to make your natural minor.  \n\n**Wrap-Up:**\nOnce you learn a scale you will want to have a way to practice them, and find all the notes within that key.  To find them you just plug them into the fret board and use the same notes all the way from 1st to 12th fret, then the pattern repeats from the 12th to 24th fret.  Look up some \"backing tracks\" on YouTube in whatever key you want to learn, and there are literally hundreds and hundreds of tracks that range from simple chord progressions repeated to full out song quality chord progressions.  Start out with C Major since it's basically C - D - E - F -G - A - B - C, with no sharps or half steps.  For C Major leads you want to emphasize your C - E - G notes.  There are other ways you can emphasize your notes, I am actually not that far into theory yet, but I just know that C - E - G triads work in the key of C Major.  I played some leads earlier for about an hour and was jamming out, it's 3:35AM now so I don't want to wake the neighbors though.  Going to figure out my Major keys on Guitar, starting with C Major from 1st to 12th fret.  Writing all this just inspired me to go play and figure some shit out since I just started diving back into theory and taking it heavy about a week ago.\n\nI figured I would try and help you out, basically once you understand music theory and work on learning some scales and keys you can play based off of \"feel\".  Try and learn your C Major / A minor scale, and then find a backing track.  Then, just jam out to the backing track, playing notes as you get more comfortable playing them around the neck.  You don't have to shred blazing fast, you can just do soft notes, letting them ring out, or muting them (your choice, this is all based on feel).  Sometimes I like to slide into notes from not touching any strings to start a solo, like going /12 on the A string and starting in the A, or slide into them from being in the middle of a lick to give it a nice tonal variation.  You can experiment on your own to come up with your own melodies and licks using the scales along with chord progressions once you learn some chords and how basic chord progressions work.\n\nPractice techniques along with theory, such as alternating your picking (alternative picking should be the first technique you learn besides palm muting I think, that's one of the first things my guitar teacher taught me when we started lessons after I took lessons from another lazier teacher for a year).  To do alternative picking, it's good practice to go up for your picking when you need to go up a string, or down on your picking when you go down a string (low E being up, high E being down, vertically).  This will increase your speed a lot, and is a great method for soloing, since you can get a faster and smoother transition from string to string that makes it piece together a lot better and makes it sound a lot less \"choppy\".  \n\nSome of my favorite shredding techniques are slides, hammer ons, pull offs, vibratos, bends, double tapping, and arpeggios sweep picking.  \n\nNo comments as I post this, but I've been typing for at least an hour as I discuss what I've learned so far, in an attempt to help you better understand stuff.  I highly recommend watching \"Music Theory from the Ground Up\" if you haven't started yet, it's on Ben Levin's YouTube channel (\"fake Dr Levin), his channel is simply called \"Ben Levin\" and has a bunch of free lessons.  \n\nIt's good to take some time off between learning things to let them sink in, and to think about them and quiz yourself.  It's kind of like doing math, you make more errors in the beginning but as you get better at it, you make less errors.  You can't get good at math just watching the teacher talk and write on the board, you have to actively figure out equations and let the equations sink in.  It's pretty much the same with music theory, it's best to learn all of this stuff with your guitar near you so you can experiment and see how stuff sounds on the instrument rather than simply naming notes and losing yourself. \n\nSo basically a mix of theory + techniques will help you learn how to \"shred\", just apply it.

{"body": "I agree with js...\nIt is a Penn Senator fitted into an Accuplate frame, which is an aftermarket customization.\nTaken from a PDF.\n\n\"The New AccuFrames are CNC machined one\npiece frames, precision machined from 6061\nAluminum and Anodized for vivid coloring and\ncorrosion protection. The AccuFrames eliminate\nthe original chrome bars and base which allows\nflexing and mis-alignment of the sideplates. Our\nAccuFrames can be used with the original plastic\nPenn sideplates or with our AccuPlates. The\nAccuFrame dramatically improves the\nperformance of the reel because it does not allow\nthe sideplates to mis-align. When the sideplates\nare aligned the reel will have smooth drags ,\nexcellent free spool, and no spool seizer under\nheavy drag loads.\nThe New Modular UniMount Designtm eliminates\nthe need for a separate mounting base that is\nattached to the frame with screws. This new\ninnovative design allows the center line of the reel\nto be as close as possible to the center line of the\nfishing rod. The result is less side torque when\ncranking on strong fish and a lighter weight reel\nwith increased strength and rigidity.\"\n\nAccuplates:\n\n\"The Aluminum AccuPlates replace the standard plastic side\nplates. AccuPlates are precision machined from solid blanks\nof 6061-T6 Aluminum. Polished anodize is added for\ncorrosion protection and vivid coloring. The A c c u P l a t e s\nenhance your old and new reels with better casting, higher\nstrength, endurance, longer life and appearance. \nTake out your original Penn internal parts including: bridge,\ngears, yolk, handle, drag star and replace the plastic\nsideplates with our AccuPlates. Instead of insulating the drag\nsystem’s heat with standard plastic sideplates, our\nAccuPlates will dissipate your drag’s heat by pulling the heat\nout of the drags and into the aluminum AccuPlates.\nEliminate eating line by using the AccuPlates. We hold\nextremely tight tolerances and there f o re the A c c u P l a t e s\nlessen the gap between your spool and sideplate which\ncauses the reel to eat line.

{"body": "As having both of these champs as my comfortable picks, i'd love to help as much as possible.\n\nStarting off with orianna\n\norianna is one of the most balanced mid lane champions in game. depending on lane match-up she can both be bully or passive. but orianna's most powerful aspect is her teamfighting ability. She can be played in almost all teamcomps.  \n\nfor masteries depending on matchup i go 21/9/0 or 21/0/9 with biscuit talent. against ad mids i prefer going 21/9/0 while against ap i go 21/0/9. for runes i use hybrid pen marks, armor seals(even after the changes), scaling ap glyphs and ap quints. you can change armor seals or scaling ap glyphs with other viable options but hybrid pen marks are mandatory. as summoner spells against bursty champs i take barrier/flash others ignite/flash.\n\nat level 1 if we are going to invade or if their level 1 is stronger than ours i level q for scouting, if not i level e. leveling e is just too good to give up for level 1. as mentioned orianna's autos hurt a lot and with shield you can sustain enemy minion dmg or their autos. level 1 e means you always win the first trade and be able to start bully. \nafter then depending on matchup i go q w q q or q w q w r w w q. now you probably ask which one to choose when. against mobile mids level q to position ball better and against less mobile or immobile champs level w to hurt them when you find to chance. \n\norianna is easy to gank because she dont have any kind of dashes or escape abilities except flash so map awareness and warding is important. if caught she can still 1v2 with enemy mid laner + jungler and kill one of them. so if you are sure that you are going to die try to kill one of them. because her autos really hurt pre 6 and after 6 with proper shockwave you can kill one and still escape. \n\nafter level 6 you should start playing depending on the mid laner's movements. is he roaming or farming? if he's farming don't roam orianna is not good at roaming and creating opportunities. orianna excels at farming so if enemy mid laner wants to farm its fine you probably will farm better and outscale him. what if he's roaming? then your team will need some wards on river to see his movement and you need to shove your lane and take the tower or follow him. i said that orianna is not good at roaming but still she can be hell of a pain with shockwave while enemy is overextended on your bot lane and trying to force a 3v2.\n\nfor item builds i build depending on enemy team/opposing mid laner. ordinary build is athenes into deathcap then zhonyas/void for me but if they are assassin/ad heavy you can build tear &gt; zhonyas/morellonomicon(zhonya morello order can change but if you are not building athenes you are buying morello for cdr.) then archangels.\n\nand at last teamfighting. if your team has an eligible ball delivery champion aka initiator, you should try to use shockwave while your ball is on them. elise, leona, lee sin and kha'zix are the best ball delivery champions imo. this sounds easy to do but actually its pretty hard because if they dash too far away from you while you are pressing r your ball can come back to you and you may shockwave the air. it's the most demoralizing thing as an orianna player. even after a couple hundred games with her i still miss my shockwaves :D\nso you need to run with your initiator while he's initiating for being in a good spot to press r. but while doing this dont get caught. and also try to keep your ball closer to the enemy team than your team. what i mean by that is if your team moves a bit forward move your ball forward as well think of it as 6th player in your team and move it with team. why? because your ball is not that fast and when you need to reposition your ball, you need it to be closer to its target thats why. \n\nlast and the most important thing. dont rush to press r, i have played too many games with her trust me, wait, don't panic. you will have the chance.\n\ni think this post is a bit long so i will cut it here if anything else comes to mind i will edit it. \n\nnow moving forward to Vi\n\nVi is one of the good duelists but not the best, and probably one of the best gankers pre 6 and best ganker post 6. if you need to apply pressure pre 6 and your ganks is somewhat fails still you can go a bit reckless and try to force fights without tower diving. she can trade with almost anyone except croc and lee sin pre 6 imo. your e is an auto attack reset and you have one of the best armor shreds in game. that means you can hit a fair amount of damage in a short time. \n\nafter 6 your all ganks should get a kill. there should be no exception. if you gank with ulti it shouldnt fail. that means do not force it too much wait for opportunity. don't try to gank ezreal gank heimerdinger for example. \nand in teamfights wait for the best chance to pickoff that squishy and dunk it, dont use flash q r just to initiate a teamfight you will just die while your teammates try to catch up to you. \n\nif you have any more questions you can reply below this post i will try to answer them as well. forgive me if i forgot some important details.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397053518", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Gravitational batteries wont take decades to develop.  Not everywhere has rivers suitable for hydroelectric, but many places have hills and mountains.  You load up rail cars with rock and use electric motors to drive them uphill.  Once on top they dump the rock and return for another load.  When you need power, you reverse the process.\n\nWhether the motors are in the rail car wheels or you use a cable to haul them up and down is a detail, but either way the efficiency is in the 90%+ range.  And you can't get much cheaper than rock for a \"battery\" material.\n\nTo put some numbers to the idea, a standard rail car is about 100 tons.  Assuming you lift it 500 meters up a mountain, the gravitational potential energy is m x g x h = 100,000 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 x 500 m = 490 MJ = 136 kWh = 1.6 Tesla car batteries.  However 100 tons of rock is ~ $1000, much less than 1.6 electric car batteries.\n\nThe rail car is obviously more expensive than that, but you can use it multiple times a day.  Assume you have two rails on a 30 degree hillside, and two cars that alternate going up and down, one per rail.  A cable connects the two cars to a large motor/generator at the top.  The rail length is then 1000 meters, and assuming the cable moves at 5 meters/sec (about the speed of San Francisco cable cars, old tech), each trip takes 200 seconds.\n\nWhen drawing energy, you fill one car, let it ride down by gravity, while the other car is empty and is pulled up.  The full car dumps it's load at the bottom, and you fill the other car at the top, and they go the other way.  In theory this will generate 2.45 MW.  If you make the track oval, and have a continuous loop of rail cars, you can fit up to 60 standard gondola (hopper) cars on the downhill side, and generate 147 MW.\n\nYour energy storage capacity is just limited by how much room you have for rock piles at the top and bottom", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397079859", "subreddit": "technology", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

One of the most eminently replayable records of the last two decades.\n\n**Beach House - Bloom**: The lyrics all sound like fucked up emotional dreams. The music is beautiful, it's soothing as hell.\n\n**Madvillain - Madvillainy**: It's the quintessential HHH record.\n\n**Redman - Whut? Thee Album**: Probably my favorite Reggie album if you put a gun to my head. It's that dusty 1992 shit, but it's funkier than pretty much everything else from that era, so it holds up better than most. Blow Your Mind and Tonight's Da Night are both absolute classic tracks.\n\n**French Montana - Coke Boys 2**: The single quintessential French project. Twist some spliffs and witness the first relevant thing Harry Fraud ever did too (he produced greater than half the tape).\n\n**French Montana - Coke Boys 4**: My favorite mixtape of 2014 so far. The actual Coke Boys aren't on this tape very much, just Chinx really. Charlie Rock and Flip don't even show up for this one, but it doesn't matter because the other features (Jada, Snoop, Rozay, Diddy, etc) and beats (88 Coupes, Paranoid, God Body, etc) have gotten even more titanic.\n\n**Mad/Gibbs - Pinata**: It's just such a good record. It's everything you could want in a modern rap release. Lakers and Knicks are my favorites by far.\n\n**M83 - Hurry Up, We're Dreaming**: Even more dream pop. I've got some wonderful memories under the influence of marvelous substances associated with this record, so it's been getting spins for almost three years straight.\n\n**Destroyer - Kaputt**: The third track from this album has 200 plays in my iTunes, making it my #1 most-played by far. In second place? The other eight tracks from this album. Go listen to it.\n\n**French Montana - Coke Boys 3**: It's not as good as 2 or 4 but it's still a damn fine mixtape.\n\n**MF DOOM - MM..FOOD**: Madvillainy is only higher than this on the list because it has 22 tracks as opposed to FOOD's 11 (not counting the bullshit sample chain in the middle as part of it). The raps might have been stronger here than ever before. One Beer, Deep Fried Frenz, Vomitspit? All top 10 DOOM songs easily.\n\n**Luke Vibert &amp; BJ Cole - Stop The Panic**: A classic acid house record. Don't ask questions, just listen. Start with \"Fly Hawaii\" and work through the rest.\n\n**DIIV - Oshin** It's interesting because I don't know how to describe it. Kinda like a mix between garage rock and shoegaze.\n\n**Yung Lean - Unknown Death 2002**: S A D B O Y S\n\n**Cypress Hill - s/t**: Muggs is one of the great underrated producers.

{"body": "It's important to understand the difference between a scale and a mode. For the purposes of modern western music (from the lens of Jazz music), a scale is a group of 7 notes within a key. The first degree of the scale is always the key of the song, meaning that a C-major scale will always begin at C and be in the key of C.\n\nBy contrast, a mode is dependent on which note is used first in a key. Thus, a G-Mixolydian mode is in the key of C, but begins on the 5th degree of the C scale.\n\nI think the best way to look at it is that a scale is the group of notes form which you create modes, and while a scale can be a mode (Ionian), not all modes are scales.\n\nWith that being said, modes are important because music can be written in a way that makes that different scale degree important. Dorian, for example, makes the 2nd degree of a scale into the \"home\" chord, and even though the key of the piece is still based on the 1st degree of the scale, the mode begins at the 2nd degree, and all \"modal\" harmony is built around making the 2nd degree the \"home\" chord.\n\nPeople use the word \"mode\" in music for mainly two purposes nowadays: Helping with composition/improvisation, and writing modal harmony.\n\nWhen someone starts playing a D-Minor chord and says \"Just play D-Dorian\", you could make an argument that you're really playing in the key of C, because the notes you'll be using are exactly the same - C D E F G A B. However, because a D-Minor chord is being used, you have to look at the notes from the perspective of D instead, thus: D E F G A B C. It's the same notes, but their organized differently and have their own sound or character now. This chart about Dorian might help to explain:\n\n    Major Scale/Ionian: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    Dorian: 2 3 4 5 6 7 1\n    Dorian from the perspective of Scale Degree 2: 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7\n\n\n    Then Phyrigian:3 4 5 6 7 1 2\n    Phrygian from Scale Degree 3: 1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 7b7\n\n\n    Lydian: 4 5 6 7 1 2 3\n    Lydian from Scale Degree 4: 1 2 3 #4 5 6 7\n\n\n    Mixolydian: 5 6 7 1 2 3 4\n    Mixolydian from Scale Degree 5: 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7\n\n\n    Aeolian: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5\n    Natural Minor/Aeolian from Scale Degree 6: 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7\n\n    Locrian 7 1 2 3 4 5 6\n    Locrian from Scale Degree 7: 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7\n\nModes are all about perspective. When you view an E phrygian mode through the lens of E rather than C, it has a totally different character and sound. Modal harmony takes the E phrygian chord (Em7) and makes that chord the focus of a song, rather than writing a song that wants to go back to C. Additionally, modal harmony does not typically include the use of tritone resolutions, because adding a tension-release structure to a piece causes the chords to \"sound\" like they are in the key of the scale, rather than \"sounding\" like the mode.\n\nHonestly, if you're just starting to learn scales and modes, just remember the degree from which each mode is sourced. That way, if you see A-Aeolian you will immediately know that the notes are really the same as a C-Major scale, or that F#-Locrian is just G-Major and so on. For improvising and most composing, that should be enough to move onto a new topic for now, and after you feel you can get a good grasp of harmony theory, then you can move back to Modal Harmony later down the road.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397125553", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yup, that's exactly right. This is a necessary design methodology to maintain the longevity of the content, keep gear relevant, and make sure raiders always have something to progress towards, but without gateing people out of content by making it too mechanically demanding.\n\nThere's even more to it as well. Even after the gear requirements are met, the encounter still needs to be a difficult learning process, but exactly as you said **it still must maintain a reasonable amount of actual gameplay difficulty**. \n\nLet's use Twintania as an example. Suppose you meet all of the gear requirements. It has taken you several weeks of clearing T1-4 to get there, but you're finally there and ready to learn. \n\n* You start the fight learning how to deal with Conflags, Fireballs, Death Sentences and Infirmity. It takes a lot of time, practice and testing to understand how these mechanics behave and how to deal with them.\n\n* Once you're past that, you have to learn the Divebombs + Snakes phase. If you don't know how Divebombs work, they will wipe your party nearly instantly, sometimes before you've even learned a single god damn thing. Moreover, If you haven't quite mastered the previous phase and still occasionally wipe to it, this stunts your progress on learning/testing Divebombs/Snakes.\n\n* Once you've beaten Divebombs/Snakes, you reach the Twisters and Dreadknights. Maybe at this point, you're 80% consistent on the Conflag phase and 30% consistent on the Snakes. That means you're only reaching Twisters on 24% of your attempts, further stunting the learning process here. Eventually, you improve your consistency across the first two phases and earn more learning time for Twisters until you learn how to beat it.\n\n* Repeat this once more for the final Hatch + Liquid Hell phase. You're super consistent with Conflags (~95%). Getting there with Snakes (70%) and Twisters (60%). You're only getting to the Hatch phase on 40% of your attempts, but more time is required because it takes you 9-10 minutes to earn the opportunity to practice the Hatch phase.\n\nAgain, none of these mechanics of the fight are overwhelmingly difficult for the average raider. If you broke down the fight to individual elements, each of them are actually quite simple. However, **the difficulty in the fight is how many mechanics you have to learn** as well as **how many phases you have to go through**. \n\nThis difficulty is magnified by the **layered progression structure** of the fight:\n\n* To learn A, you must be geared enough.\n* To learn B, you must learn A.\n* To learn C, you must learn B, but your consistency at A limits the pace at which you can learn B.\n* To learn D, you must learn C, but your consistency at A **multiplied by** your consistency at B limits the pace at which you can learn C.\n* To learn E, you must learn D, which is limited by your consistency at A x B x C.\n\nSo, the process of learning A, B, C, D an E are each individually reasonable in difficulty and not out of reach for a player of average skill. However, defeating the boss requires learning **A x B x C x D x E**, which is a long and arduous process for even the best and most hardcore players. The end result: A genuine challenge for the top raiders. Nothing absurdly difficult for the rest.\n\nThis is a great design philosophy for a final boss and I'm guessing this is what the FFXIV raiding community can expect from Nael Van Darnus.

Given that the average American male is 5'9\" that means that CEOs, as a group, have about three inches on the rest of their sex. But this statistic actually understates matters. In the U.S. population, about 14.5% of all men are six feet or over. Among CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, that number is 58%. Even more strikingly, in the general American population, 3.9% of adult men are 6'2\" or taller. Among my CEO sample, 30% were 6'2\" or taller,\" writes Gladwell.

If you play alternating notes of the scale together, they sound harmonious. \n\nThe C major scale is C D E F G A B C. If you play CEG together you get a C major chord. If you play the notes one after another it is an arpeggio of a C major chord. \n\nYou can use the same pattern by starting on any note of the scale and using alternating notes. The list repeats as you continue to go up or down. If you start on the second note, you get DFA. This is a D minor chord. The difference between a major and minor chord is that a major chord has two whole steps between the first two notes where a minor chord has a whole step and a half step. \n\nIf you're curious, you may be wondering what happens if you keep going in skipping notes. Some styles of music, particularly jazz, are heavily based on these extended harmonies. For example, you might use GBDFA. This is called a G9 chord because the last A is an octave plus a whole step (a ninth) above the starting G.

(We swaddle him so they're too far for him to interact with or move while he's sleeping because SIDS) I rotate them out every few days to give him something new to look at. We also have a mirror he loves to stare at his own face and often it calms him down. I read to him every night, we have little golden books and i bought the three billy goats gruff and the ugly duckling as 5 min stories at walmart (four bucks a piece). When I'm getting ready to put him down at night when the lights are dim and it's \"bed time\" around his 8-9pm feeding, even though he sleeps all the time lol, I read him a story. I count his fingers and toes out to him while he eats his bottle and poke his nose, and say nose, and so on. When I'm dressing him I say back and front as I'm putting on his onesie depending on where it touches first, one arm, two arms, one leg, two legs. that kinda thing. We do tummy time as well and he's got reflux so I just watch for signs that he's uncomfortable, he's up to being able to do it for 20 mins at a time without fussing much now. I have a teething ring shaped like and elephant that I've let him put in his mouth and touch. I have him touch his stuffed animals (he loves his wubba nub monkey and sleeps with it as a comfort toy now not just a binkie). I talk about the animals he's touching, that's a monkey, m o n k e y, and spell it out loud. I make very exaggerated shapes with my mouth as i spell, I read they pick up on that and learn to speak/read better because of this. I also sing him his ABC'S I've been doing all this since he came home at 3 weeks old (he was in the NICU prior to that) I sing to him every day and sang to him at the NICU as well. Just TALKING to the baby right now will make a difference. \n\nA couple my husband and I used to be friends with, their son is totally behind in speech because they left him in his crib constantly, didn't do any activities with him and didn't talk to him for about his first year. They left him in his room and didn't allow him out in a swing or anything to just be part of the action. At three years old he knew 60 words and couldn't say most of them well. Talking to her, letting her be out around you guys even if she's sleeping she'll hear the noises, words, and other activity in the house. My son is at his due date TODAY so his adjusted age is one day old and he's already meeting the mile stones of his actual age (almost 1.5 months) and I really believe that's due to our intervention early on. \n\nI hope this gave you some ideas and I'm so happy to see other mommas so on top of their kiddos development.

That has to do with actual orthography. All the consonant characters have an inherent A. To change the vowel, the consonant is followed by the vowel you want to replace A with. A is only ever written when at the beginning of a word or when a consonant is followed by two vowels in sequence, such as AE or AO or something (to distinguish it from a simple vowel replacement). Anyway, back to the N's. The phonotactics only allow for a syllable to end in a vowel, or a vowel + N. You don't want people to get confused between a word like (these aren't real words, I'm just making something up to give an example) 'pin' and 'pin(a)' with an inherent A after the N. So the first N in the alphabetical order above is the regular N, and the one toward the end is the final N. The final N may also actually be written as M before P and B.\n\nI use the comination GN for the velar nasal to distinguish it from NG, which is a velar nasal + G (I thought writing GNG or GNK, which is also a possiblility, was just really asthetically unpleasing). However, in the actual orthography, one would write the GN character followed by the G or K character.\n\nHere's the [orthography](http://i.imgur.com/Q844YA4.png).

{"body": "There's two major issues with this line of thinking. First of all, when you say \"minorities,\" the term is relative. Russians may be a minority on the US servers (I'm ready for the jokes about this), but they aren't on the Russian server. South Americans aren't minorities on the South American server. But in Dota, females are ALWAYS the minority. There's nowhere for them to go where they aren't going to be the butt of the joke, or the liability of the team. They're the single pub to your four-stack - if you win, it's because you managed to carry them, but if you lose, it's because they dragged you down. That's the reality of it. \n\nSecondly, you may be right about the fact that a female could potentially breach the pro scene if they were good enough, but doesn't the fact that none have seem a little strange? Not even ONE? What's stopping them? Well, that's the thing. People don't just come out of the womb with their Dota skill level predetermined like most people here seem to believe, with men just having way higher skill levels than women. The ultimate problem is that women don't WANT to get good at a game where everyone playing it fucking hates them and is discouraging them every chance they get. If you got bullied every day at school, guess what - you'd start to hate school. If you got bullied every day at an after-school club, you'd stop going. It's the same thing. I know I don't speak for everyone, and there are women who are currently overcoming this, but in general, the current gaming culture is one where women feel unwanted, and that's why they're not becoming professional players.  \n\nAnother common thing I've seen in this thread is the idea that the professional expectations of women are completely identical to that of men, and I really don't think that's true. Let's play a quick game to show you what I mean. Let's imagine Fluffnstuff was a girl. Do you think people would have reacted to the blog post the same way (B L O G G I R L S), or do you think maybe the responses would have been a little more harsh? Imagine if EternalEnvy was a girl. You think people are overly-critical of his play now? Imagine if MUFC at TI3 or MYM in the ASUS DreamLeague were a team of women. Imagine if KYXY were a girl during the Aegis deny. The idea that women and men compete on an even playing field in terms of expectations doesn't hold up in my mind. Additionally, telling women to \"stop letting the fact that no one wants you to succeed\" is such a shitty sign on the times. They shouldn't HAVE to overcome this giant wall that we've set up for them. It's a band-aid solution that stops us from having to actually deal with the problem at hand. The all-female league is trying to provide a place where women don't have to be under the normal yet completely unfair pressure that is incredibly prevalent in Dota. It's not the perfect solution, but at least someone is trying to be proactive about it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397400881", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The same way you know if someone is wearing a shirt that's stained.\n\nNot all music follows the same rules, but when you listen to a piece of music, you draw upon all the similar music you've ever heard to analyze how it works.  For example, suppose you're listening to Bach.  You've heard a lot of Bach before and you have an idea of how it works.  So when you hear something that's uncharacteristic of what you expect, you notice it.  For example, if you're listening to a Bach fugue played by a string quartet and all of a sudden a car horn starts blaring, you know there's something that doesn't fit about it!  Obviously if one of the violins plays a wrong note, it's not as obvious as the car horn, but if you've heard enough Bach, it can still be jarring.  Suppose everyone is playing C D E F G, but one dude plays C# D# E# F# G# instead.  Nowhere else in the piece are there dissonances in a row like this, so you figure that the one dude was playing wrong notes, because it just sounds different.\n\nIt's actually easier to know when a note is played out of tune.  Western music uses exclusively (almost) a system of 12 tones per octave.  Everyone who lives around Western music is familiar with how this sounds, even if they don't know it.  So when someone plays something out of tune, it has a particular sound that doesn't match what people expect.  Musicians especially train themselves to recognize when they're out of tune so that they can fix it, so they'll hear it if someone else is out.  Suppose you're building a table.  If you put one of the legs in upside down, that's a wrong note.  If you put the leg in a bit off to the side so that it's not lined up with the corner of the table, or if you don't nail it in all the way so that it's still loose, that's out of tune.  You can usually hear what the composer intended, but you can also hear that the execution missed it.  If one of the players holds a note longer than everyone else, you can hear it, and depending on how it goes, you can guess that the composer didn't mean for that to happen!  Actually, Beethoven plays with this in the 5th symphony, 1st movement.  In the recap, the oboe keeps holding some notes out too long, and you think that maybe the oboist isn't paying attention, but then there's an extended oboe solo and you realize that, no, the composer did mean it for the oboe to do that.\n\nWe have an expectation of what good music is supposed to sound like, and when that expectation is violated, the conclusion is that it's an error.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397430158", "subreddit": "ELI5Music", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So...you seem to have a misunderstanding and I shall enlighten you. I am RainbowBrittle's husband. We have been married for what will be 6 years next month. In those 6 years we have never, with the exception of her six week trip to Germany a couple of years ago, had sex less than once a month. While I'm not 100% sure I'm pretty positive that it has never been less than twice a month. She once asked me how many times a week I would like to have sex and I responded that 2 to 3 times a week would be satisfactory for me. (At the time it was once and sometimes twice a week.) She as never since that conversation let me down regardless of my \"work ethic,\" barring illness or absence. I am very happy with my sex life. I have never wondered what my life would be like if \"we were sexually compatible.\" The reason for this is that she has never turned me down in the bedroom. Yes, sometimes one or both of us are not in the mood and so sex doesn't happen (this has even been my fault a few times) but once the act commences neither of us says no to the desires or fantasies of the other. I don't actually think that a more \"compatible\" mate could exist for me. \n\nYou will notice that I am replying to you regarding moronic comments that you sent to her in a private message. That is because of something else that I am going to teach you. We share E V E R Y T H I N G. I don't have any secrets from her and she has none from me. In the early stages of our relationship I made a leap of faith and told her things about my life and about who I really am that no one else has or will ever know. I shared myself with her so deeply that if she wanted to she could hurt me in ways that would likely never heal. What happened next is that she reciprocated and together we both learned about a level of trust that few people ever experience. That is the basis of our marriage. It's not sex. It's not about anything physical at all. If sex somehow became a physical impossibility I would still not cheat on her because I don't need that to have a fulfilling relationship. Sex is fun and we both like it but it does not define our relationship and it never will. I went for more than two decades without sex or even the desire to have sex with any woman I knew because I was more interested in the people than the bodies. I'm not really sure what else I can say about this subject except that if you really feel that sex is that integral to a successful relationship, I'd say you have had some very shallow relationships if any at all and if the correct answer is that you've had none then the fault is likely yours.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397440281", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First off, take a look at 19/30 as a start finding notes as effortlessly as possible.  It sounds like you maybe be having a problem I once had.  You are likely make too much effort, over-setting and trying to move everything way more than you need to.\n\nStart with some nice, super relaxed long tones, then try the following exercise daily to really help you make your slurring efficient and effortless.\n\nSlur a bar of eighth notes from C-G and hold out a whole note of the C.  Set your metronome in a very VERY comfortable place to do this with almost no effort and focus on making the motion as small as possible, especially with your lips.  Think of it more as a slight (very slight) tongue arch thing.\n\nContinue down through the valve combinations doing this at whatever tempo you chose.  Then start back C-G for 4 eighths, B-F# 4 eighths, etc through all the valve combinations down and back up.  Then just a quick 2 eighths each... C-G-B-F#-A-E....\n\nNow bump your metronome up 5 or 10 clicks and go back to a bar of 8 eighth notes and repeat the whole process again.\n\nThe point is retain the easy, smoothness, and even airstream from the slower tempos on into the next tempo.  Doing is slow makes sure you're doing it right.  Do so many repetitions makes your body slowly find the most efficient way to make the transition between the notes and *want* to continue doing it that way.  As you speed up, you'll maintain a lot of that.  Eventually you'll obviously get to a point where it's just uncomfortably fast and you're almost having to make more effort than you should.  Push a little into this, but not far.\n\nNow take a break and repeat the same thing starting on G-C.  You may actually find that, so long as you're relaxed, it's actually easier as you get higher and the slurs end up closer together to find that sweet spot of quick, efficient change.\n\nObviously continue on from there to C-E, E-G, G-Bb with lots of breaks and only going as high as your chops are really comfortable doing.\n\nYour first go, you probably won't make it far just because the repetition of the exercise involve lots of face time.  As you try to work on this daily, you'll find you can get from your starting point to your max more easily.  While I'd suggest starting at the same slow starting point you might move from 5 to 10 to 20 click increments for the early ramping up and back it down to smaller increments as you get closer to your max tempo to ensure you don't start getting erratic.\n\n\nSo that's a good start on quick, adjacent lipslurs.  Another exercise worth trying is to do some with skips.  For the sake of smoothness and musicality, I tend to throw in some thirds in the low end.  So do something like starting on low C G E C (middle of the staff).  Linger for a bit then sort of shimmy back down G C E G C (with the last C being the lowest).  Obviously the same concept through all the valve combinations, then add a partial on top repeating the pattern.\n\nIf I can remember, I'll try to make a video demonstrating these exercises, though I've already agreed to make another video for a pianists and it's Easter week so it's busier than normal.

[**Move notation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Move_notation) of article  [**Rubik's Cube**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's%20Cube): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Many 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by [David Singmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Singmaster) to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \"Singmaster notation\".  Its relative nature allows [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *F* (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n\n&gt;* *B* (Back): the side opposite the front\n\n&gt;* *U* (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n\n&gt;* *D* (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube\n\n&gt;* *L* (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n\n&gt;* *R* (Right): the side directly to the right of the front\n\n&gt;* *ƒ* (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *b* (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *u* (Up two layers) : the top side and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *d* (Down two layers) : the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *l* (Left two layers) : the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *r* (Right two layers) : the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *x* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *R*\n\n&gt;* *y* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *U*\n\n&gt;* *z* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *F*\n\n&gt;When a [prime symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol\\)) ( ′ ) follows a letter, it denotes a face turn counter-clockwise, while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. A letter followed by a 2 (occasionally a superscript ^2) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. *R* is right side clockwise, but *R'* is right side counter-clockwise. The letters *x*, *y*, and *z* are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When *x*, *y* or *z* are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees.\n\n&gt;The most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \"w\", for \"wide\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of *Rw* is equivalent to one of *r*. \n\n&gt;For methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods) there is a generally accepted \"MES\" extension to the notation where letters *M*, *E*, and *S* denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm. \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *M* (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)\n\n&gt;* *E* (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)\n\n&gt;* *S* (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F\n\n&gt;The 4×4×4 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (*F B U D L R*) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (*f b u d l r*) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parenthesis (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (*Rr*)' *l*2 *f*' means to turn the two rightmost layers counterclockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer counterclockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.\n\n&gt;An alternative notation, [Wolstenholme notation](http://www.topaccolades.com/notation/rubikscube.htm), is designed to make memorizing sequences of moves easier for novices. This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants. The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A and I for clockwise, counterclockwise and 180-degree turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU′R′UL′U′RU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face.\n\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Rubik, ^the ^Amazing ^Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik,_the_Amazing_Cube) ^| [^Optimal ^solutions ^for ^Rubik's ^Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_solutions_for_Rubik%27s_Cube) ^| [^1982 ^World ^Rubik's ^Cube ^Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World_Rubik%27s_Cube_Championship) ^| [^Rubik's ^Cube ^group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_group) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cgs9d0j) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cgs9d0j)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397498333", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's also worth pointing out that it is a circle. Moving upwards in fifths from C we get: C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E#(F) B#(C). Each jump adds one more sharp in the key signature.\n\nIf we move downwards in fifths, we find that each leap adds a flat to the key signature: C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb(E) Bbb Ebb Abb Dbb(C).\n\nModern intonation systems are equally tempered. This means that all the steps of the scale are equal distances apart. Getting into a full explanation of this is beyond the scope of ELI5, but suffice it to say that equal tempered enharmonic tones are equivalent. In ELI5 terms, that means that a Cb is the same as a B natural and that any music can be played in any key. \n\nWhy is this important? As /u/beachutman points out, it is a way of demonstrating which keys are closely related and which are farther apart. This is useful if you are writing music in one key and want to include a modulation (key change). Depending on the effect you are trying to accomplish, the modulation could be to a closely related key or one farther apart. Generally speaking, the effect will be more jarring for the listener the farther away the other key is. \n\nMost of all, it is an important way of demonstrating some of the basic ideas of music theory. You can certainly play an instrument without knowing about the circle of fifths, but it helps tremendously in understanding how music is put together and why composers make some of their musical decisions.

{"body": "Hey there, I transitioned from Green/Blue cross to ZZ, you can imagine how bad that was... so first and foremost, learning EO rules are a must, there is no easy way out of it and you should just go ahead and memorize them. Unfortunately, the method of \" see if it can be solved using L/R/U/D \" takes a great amount of time. once you have EO and being able to recognize, organizing can be a real pain. Much of this is intuitive, Id advise watching \"asmallkitten's\" video on EO. remember, all bad edges are EVEN NUMBERED, they will result 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 bad edges. Now once you have eo'd id make a CROSS. Block building is difficult to grasp at first, so making a cross after EO is much easier on you and your brain( I use to get headaches from block building) Remeber once EO is done, ONLY USE R U L D moves for F2L ONLY, LL is a different story.

Also IMO unless you're very good at n noticing the difference in tone, strings aren't a big deal. Electric IMO is easier to play also. But a lot more goes into buying an electric than it does buying an acoustic. Go to a wholesale store like guitar center and play everything see what feels nice to you. You may find certain neck shapes you prefer over others or you may prefer the sound of one over the other. Also when learning you may be overwhelmed. Learn a scale and 4 chords at 1st.

And I really hate having to build the Cleaver, Lizard, blade route since I don't have competent teammates.   Nautilus is still a good pick but a niche one at that.  He requires a team comp with lots of burst to help when he locks them down.  He is still the best champ when it comes to Ganking bot lane in the current meta because he synergies so much with all the CC thresh and Leona bring to the table so having any sort of competent support almost secures a kill.  His first clear is actually not as bad as you'd think, I use Attack speed marks and attack damage quints which allows you to get 1 more W proc on first buff, wights and wolves at level 2 (I've been leveling W E W Q W R unless I know I can make a level 3 gank). And two extra procs at level 3 on wights and wolves.  His clear is weak in general but you shouldn't be farming jungle a lot, you should be farming assists.  If I don't have at least 4/5s as many assists/kills as our support I don't feel great about that game.  I wouldn't really compare him to maokai or Amumu but more akin to someone like Sejuani (whom I also jungle, and also who is in a much worse spot right now).  A Jungler who I've been falling in love with right now is Warwick though, he has an ult that gets team mates to cooperate and can still 1v3 or 4 as a late game monster.

{"body": "I remember reading a great post on this ages ago, but can't quite remember where I found it and a cursory look on the phone isn't turning anything up. But to summarize, dialects seem to pop up around any group of people who spend a large amount of time solely on one site. This is usually a reflection of several things, such as the intricacies of posting, the attitudes of the general user base, etc. \n\nAs an example, let's say you posted a short video of yourself attempting to eat an ice cream cone, only to drop said cone on the ground, ice cream side down. Depending on the site you post it to, you may get a variety of responses such as:\n\nTwitter: \"lol @ this dumass RT\"\n\n4chan: \"[reaction image]  \n\\&gt; be eating ice cream.   \n\\&gt; \"Oh boy this'll be a treat!\"  \n\\&gt; asshole gravity denies me of frozen delights.  \n\\&gt; mfw\" \n\nTumblr: \"omfg i can't with this shit it happens every time like idk mAYBE I ACTUALLY WANTED TO EAT THE ICE CREAM THIS TIME????\"\n\nReddit: \"Do you want ants? \n\nBecause this is how you get ants.\"\n\nAnd so on and so forth. And even those responses aren't unanimous across those sites, as there are pockets of different cultures and ways of communicating across boards/cliques/subreddits/etc. \n\nMore to the point, I believe the tagging and reblogging systems on Tumblr play a large role in affecting the way people communicate (i.e. commas being used to separate keywords leads to both the lack of use of punctuation outside of tagging purposes and halting sentence structure, as something like \"but honestly, who's counting?\" appears as \"but honestly\" \"who's counting?\"; the use of bold face repetition of phrases for humor or emphasis purposes is easier to do than blockquoting due to the shabby nature of Tumblr's reblogging system; repetition in tags means the tag won't show up so people are creative with things such as spacing out w o r d s  l i k e  s o.) Tumblr is notoriously horrible when it comes to conversation, and that paired with it being more visually-oriented than, say, Reddit means you tend to get short bursts of conversation on Tumblr, while Reddit, with its ready to use, primarily text-based system breeds a user base who prefers longer, more grammatically sound conversation. Reddit users are also more likely to have a slight skeptical lean, as the site voting system means blatant bullshit is called out quicker than on Tumblr, where speed of reblog is favored over long posts and research. \n\nOr at least, that's my hypothesis. \n\n(Edit: phone formatting)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397658476", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Probably one of the least liked Radiohead albums next to Pablo Honey for most people but I still love it.\n\n**The National - Trouble Will Find Me:** I can understand how people would find them boring but I absolutely love everything about them. From Matt Berninger's voice to the melancholy lyrics to the use of horns, it just all works so well for me.\n\n**Teebs - E S T A R A:** Artist on Brainfeeder. He's ok but kind of feels like Flying Lotus lite.\n\n**Liars - Mess:** Listened to this again and solidified it as one of my favorites of 2014 so far.\n\n**Kool A.D. - WORD O.K.:** Seems like the sum of Kool A.D.'s efforts up to this point. His solo work is extremely loose and experimental which usually makes it pretty hard to listen to but I think he nailed it down more for this. Definitely worth listening to if you're looking for something different.\n\n**SZA - Z:** Listened to this pretty much just because she's on TDE but it really surprised me. Didn't expect this sound at all and I really enjoyed it. Probably also in my Top 5 for this year so far, at least Top 10 but I'm gonna have to listen to it more to figure that out.\n\n**BADBADNOTGOOD - III:** Bit of a predictable release but it's good. They don't really seem to be progressing much but they always put out consistent stuff.\n\n**Girl Talk &amp; Freeway - Broken Ankles:** I think this release has more depth than it seems. At face value it's just a few fun, simple bangers with pretty repetitive lyrics that are almost just there as filler. But if you look a little deeper into it it's a pretty interesting project. Maybe not the masterpieces that Girl Talk can put out, but all the beat switches and just the way the vocals were handled made this have a unique feel that was almost similar to a mashup.

I do a quick read of all of the essays once before I write anything on them (I do this in phases, one class at a time) and put them in rough piles of A B C D and F. This helps me immediately see if whole classes or large groups of students are making similar mistakes, as well as setting a fair bar for myself while I grade. If I don't do this, I tend to get frustrated as grading continues and count off for things that I allowed in the first few essays. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397699267", "subreddit": "ELATeachers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

A major chord is the 1st, 3rd, and 5th note away, so C = 1, E = 3, G = 5th. What are the notes in a C major? the low E, C on the A string, E on the D string, G string, C on the B and an open E again. ECEGCE. You can figure out most major chords that way with the 1-3-5 rule.\n\nTo create tunes/melodies, string the chords together. You've probably heard of a 1-iv-V progression? So in the key of C, (whatever is 1 is the name of the key, you can start with any note) you'd play C major, an F (minor), and then a G.

{"body": "Can't Hear God? Change your station. I know how you feel sadman314. It's can be very hard to hear God's voice. One thing I have learned throughout the years is that many times we are unable to hear God because we are tuned in to ourselves. \n\nWhat do I mean by tuned in to ourselves?\n\nWe are constantly thinking about ourselves, how we feel- our depression, our crippling anxiety, our life's circumstances etc. We want OUR pain, OUR frustration and OUR anger to go away. We are always thinking about what word WE will get from God, how God is going to bless US, what rewards WE will get when we go to hear, what OUR purpose is, what needs WE need met etc. In your forum post you used the words 'I' or 'me' 27 times. \n\nEveryone has needs, wants and desires. Everyone wants to feel validated, loved and recognized by God. Everyone wants to hear God speak to them. The key to getting these things is to change your spiritual station. You do that by tuning out of yourself and tuning into O T H E R S. \n\nThe reason for this is because in the Kingdom of God, love is the law and we are supposed to focus on others first. We give to others, love others and put other peoples needs above our own. We walk in love by putting our faith in action. Doing this will cause us to recieve the things we desire. Outside the Kingdom of God it's the opposite- everyone is focused on themselves first, we work hard for money to buy things we want and do the things we want, it's all about us. Our needs and our wants. In God's kingdom, it's the opposite.\n\nThis is why Jesus said, \"give and it will be given to you\" and \"seek the kingdom of God first and then all things will be added to you\". It is also why many Christians never recieve the desires of their heart. How do you get the desires of your heart? By changing your station. \n\nIf you want to hear God and feel God than start focusing on others. Put other people's needs ahead of your own. Find a way to make a difference in someone's life. Call someone and encourage them, give to someone in need, donate to a charity, complement someone, walk in love. Do these things and you will be tuned into God and you will feel Him and hear Him speak to you.\n\nTuning out of ourselves by tuning into others is the key to learning how to hear the voice of God.

{"body": "I'm not a professional mathematician here, so the following is just my speculation. \n\nLet's say that the rug is 100' long, 2' wide and 1/12' thick. This makes it a rectangular prism with L= 100, W= 2, and H= 1/12. The rug has a volume, which would be equal to L x W x H, or 16.67 cubic feet in this situation. \n\nNow in rolling it up, you don't change the amount of material, so the volume of the rug itself would remain the same, but the solid would now be a cylinder. The cylinder's height (distance from base to base) would be equal to the width of the rug; in this case 2'. Volume of a cylinder is pi x r^2 x H, where H in this case = 2. Setting the volumes equal to each other, we would get the following:\n\n2(pi)r^2 = 16.67\n\nCranking that out algebraically, you get ~ r = 1.629, so diameter would be about 3.3 feet. \n\nNow of course, these are all approximations, and I'm not accounting for space in between the \"sheets\" of rug or the hole in the middle, but I'd say this gives a rough estimate.

{"body": "Second this.  Not having premade KO's makes a job so much neater and easier.  \n\nParticularly in situations where your product may be replacing something that was there, it makes fitting existing pipes SO much easier and neater if we make our own holes.  Sometimes the pipes line up just right, and you end up punching out half of a prepunched KO.  Plus it saves OP the time and expense of having the machinery to make those nasty KO's.  and what if I want a 1\" or 2\" KO?  I've got to punch out anyhow.  Concentric KO's are fine for like a residential panel where you know you are going to have a gajillion holes for NM cable, but for a lighting control panel where pipe is an expected wiring method? Nope.\n\nAdd to that there are too many different situations to consider when making an installation that to say, \"What is more popular?\" is somewhat misleading.  Whatever you choose, you are going to screw somebody.\n\nMy chief complaint about enclosures for lighting control revolve around lack of space inside the enclosure for feed wires and screwy phasing.  Instead of A B C A B C A B C phasing that is typical for distribution panels and load centers, lighting control panels are sometimes A A A B B B C C C, which really screws with guys heads.\n\nAlso, only having a small area in the enclosure where pipe or cable entrance is \"allowed\" is a real pain in the ass.  Sometimes, I can't enter the bottom of an enclosure without making two 90 degree bends.   Sometimes, I can't enter one side or the other at all!  The contortions that we go through because we only have 12 square inches to enter 10 inches of pipe in is ridiculous.\n\nEdit: Added link to [ETC DRd installation instructions](http://www.etcconnect.com/docs/docs_downloads/manuals/Uni_DRd_Rack_Enclosure_Installation_Manual_revC.pdf) (PDF) for those who are scratching their heads about what I'm talking about.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397773933", "subreddit": "electricians", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "http://www.last.fm/user/FactualEvidence\n\n[3x3](http://i.imgur.com/j3oG2sF.jpg)\n\n**Radiohead - Hail to the Thief:** Listened to this again after getting into a discussion about it. Probably one of the least liked Radiohead albums next to Pablo Honey for most people but I still love it.\n\n**The National - Trouble Will Find Me:** I can understand how people would find them boring but I absolutely love everything about them. From Matt Berninger's voice to the melancholy lyrics to the use of horns, it just all works so well for me.\n\n**Teebs - E S T A R A:** Artist on Brainfeeder. He's ok but kind of feels like Flying Lotus lite.\n\n**Liars - Mess:** Listened to this again and solidified it as one of my favorites of 2014 so far. **I've also downloaded Sisterworld but I'd love more recommendations for Liars albums since this is the first one I've heard.**\n\n**Kool A.D. - WORD O.K.:** Seems like the sum of Kool A.D.'s efforts up to this point. His solo work is extremely loose and experimental which usually makes it pretty hard to listen to but I think he nailed it down more for this. Definitely worth listening to if you're looking for something different.\n\n**SZA - Z:** Listened to this pretty much just because she's on TDE but it really surprised me. Didn't expect this sound at all and I really enjoyed it. Probably also in my Top 5 for this year so far, at least Top 10 but I'm gonna have to listen to it more to figure that out.\n\n**BADBADNOTGOOD - III:** Bit of a predictable release but it's good. I like pretty much all their stuff but they seem consistently good or even very good but never getting to the point where they can really wow me.\n\n**Girl Talk &amp; Freeway - Broken Ankles:** I think this release has more depth than it seems.

{"body": "Looks like it's in the key of E minor to me. There are a few tricks you can use. Sometimes, the first chord is the key it's in. This isn't always true. Often, the last chord is the key it's in. This also isn't always true. But if you play your progression, then add another single strum in the Em chord, it sounds done. We call this resolution. That chord (the final Em strum) *resolves* tension that is created in the progression.\n\nAnother way is to pick apart all the notes in all the chords and see what scale fits best. You have Em-G-D-Am, so that's:  \nEm: E, G, B  \nG: G, B, D  \nD: D, F#, A  \nAm: A, C, E  \n\nSo your notes, from those chords, starting at the first note of Em and going to the last note of Am, and only using each note once, are: E, G, B, D, F#, A, C\n\nIf you re-arrange them alphabetically you get: A B C D E F# G\n\nWell, that's a nice scale there, 7 unique notes. How do I know it's E minor (E F# G A B C D) and not A dorian (A B C D E F# G)? Well, because the Em chord makes that progression sound resolved, so the Em is the \"home\" chord, IE: the root of the scale, or the tonic, or the first degree.\n\nIf you played your progression and stayed on the Am as the final chord, it does not sound as resolved as it does when you shift back to Em for one final strum. Try it. It still sounds OK, but the Em sounds really \"done\". Like you almost feel relieved.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nI suggest learning scale and chord theory, they are essentially two faces of the same thing, and they can aid a lot in this sort of task.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397781810", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Therefore YOU are responsible for keeping YOURSELF safe.  \n\nAnd that point number 2 is true even in cities with big, well funded police forces.  In some cases I'd argue that you need to keep yourself safe FROM the over zealous, overly militarized, citizen abusing police force (NYC cops)  Assuming that any police force can keep you safe when you live in a remote rural area, and then refusing to take responsibility for your own safety under that assumption is sheer insanity.\n\nIn this case the citizens of this county refused multiple attempts to increase taxation that would have provided funding for more police.  Tragically a woman suffered a terrible crime because of the active choice of the citizens.  The only sane response in these circumstances would be to move to an area that properly funds law enforcement and other public services or take responsibility for your own protection.

{"body": "I think what I'm going to do is similar to what I did last day. I'm going to write out my thoughts here as they come to me. But this time, I have more than one message to consider. I think I'll post the first few, and then edit in more as I go.\n\nFirst:\n\n&gt;Dear 'Masons',\n\nA fairly simple taunt. Could be a coded message, but unlikely.\n\n&gt;Town, can you please,\n\nThis message uses the name I created yesterday for the witch claim, and certainly does have a similar tone. However, the message does not actually say anything of consequence.\n\n&gt;Greetings my genlte lambs\n\nI'd be interested to know if rcxdude would admit to posting this. The intent of the message seems to be: \"ipretendiamacat is innocent, Uncomprehensible is not.\" This could imply many things about this information's source. For now, I don't think this information is in any way actionable, but it's interesting data to keep in mind.\n\nEDIT BREAK ONE:\n\n&gt;Masonsssss help me.\n\nMeaningless drivel. Probably a townie.\n\n&gt;Well Town, you called our bluff.\n\nNot, in itself, a particularly meaningful message. It implies that the fake witch claim was the action of the werewolves, but that was more or less already known. If Uncomprehensible has survived the night, then either they are the true witch, or the true witch is *wildly* incompetent. It also implies that they're going to attempt to kill him. Again, we'll just see if he survives.\n\nWhat I do find interesting about this message is the sign off. The fact that it shares a sign off with the first message does *strongly* imply that they originate from the same source. Either the werewolves, or a separate individual intending to sow discord and confusion. The two messages are similarly jovial and devoid of meaningful content, so I suspect that whatever the factional source, they were written by the same person. \n\n&gt;Schwarzlache, I'm 95% sure you're around. Please target 'HHlwV' (not Caesar) for the time being. You'll thank me later. -SvU\n\nI hate being stumped.\n\nEDIT BREAK TWO:\n\n&gt;I, the Oracle, had a revelation!\n\nThis is where things get interesting. A naked, simple, Oracle result claim, simply stating that /u/Silent11 is innocent. Interesting, interesting. Assume that this is truth: The Oracle chose to investigate Silent11, and found him innocent. Assume the worst: Silent11 is a werewolf and this is a fake cover. Unlikely. The large amount of other \"oracle\" activity suggests that at least some of that is the result of werewolf psy-ops. Attempting to usefully exploit the \"oracle\" data while simultaneously undermining it is fooling. Continue: A possible interpretation is that this is a werewolf or other malintended message, but not coming from Silent11 himself in any way. It could be intended to introduce extra confusion into the system, and possibly cause a false lynch on Silent. Converse: This is Silent11, a non werewolf, attempting to create some security for himself. Not being a werewolf himself, he has no information about their own counter-messaging, and does not plan for it. I consider one of these latter two possibilities to be the most likely. One requires that Silent11 is acting in a strongly anti-town way, the other supposes a total lack of involvement of him in this process. A possible lynch target, but low-priority.\n\n&gt;Hello. Constable here.\n\nThis is certainly highly consistent with the previous night's Constable message. I think it's unquestionable that the two messages came from the same source. I really don't know what to make of the \"validation codes\". I'm no cryptographer. Overall, I think the sheer effort this individual is going towards indicates a certain degree of legitimacy. I certainly agree with the sentiment espoused in the last paragraph, however, so I'm not going to accept any of that as gospel. For now, at least, I'm willing to consider ipretendiamacat a lower priority lynching target.\n\n&gt; [](/blank)\n\n&gt;[](/sp)\n\nOk.\n\nEDIT BREAK THE THIRD:\n\n&gt;I'm the Oracle. The first letters of...\n\nAgain, more interesting. The first letters in question were \"Y n i G N O a y a t O\", which relatively trivially expands into \"Your name is [G N O] and you are a town Oracle\". That really doesn't prove much though, although I do support the addition of additional information when possible. The specific thing being claimed here is the guilt of /u/Eizero0. He's a reasonable investigation target, being a mostly inactive unknown, but where it gets interesting is the opposing later claim that he was investigated as innocent. Of the two, I prefer this one, as it's offered additional information. It's not a strong belief, but overall I'd say that /u/Eizero0 looks like the best lynch we have available to us, barring later revealed information.\n\n&gt;Don't &amp;%^$ing mess with my luggage.\n\nHi Srol.\n\n&gt;He may have terrible ideas that harm the town considerably, but don't lynch redpoemage.\n\n&gt;-gryffinp\n\nYeah, so, this wasn't me.\n\nI like to think that red's smarter than to try to pull this kind of crap. Now that I've thought about it, I can almost see this as someone else trying to get me to refocus on redpoemage, manipulating my previously displayed animosity towards him.\n\nInteresting.\n\n&gt;[Hey guys I just wanted to share my Night 1 Cop results with you guys.](http://memeabuse.wordans.com/wvc-1294327343/wordansfiles/images/2011/1/6/61639/61639_popup.jpg)\n\n**vote:dick butt.**\n\nEDIT FOURTH AND FINAL:\n\n&gt;Srol is guilty. Look at previous message board for proof that I investigate him Night 1. I was hinting that he would be my investigation target. Now I can post results.\n\n&gt;♣ ♦ ♥ ♠\n\nReviewing the previous message board post marked with the four suits, this seems plausible. There were at least a large number of capital S's. Oh, I should clarify, when I say \"plausible\", I mean \"plausible that these messages came from the same person.\" Not necessarily \"Plausible that this result is actionable.\"\n\nI think for more information on Srol, we need to turn to ArchmageLudicrous, our claimed thief who targeted Srol. Last I saw, there was some discussion elsewhere in the thread on that subject. If he'd be willing to claim to be the message writer (which seems not implausible considering the card suits), that could clear things up a bit.\n\nAlso, I find it interesting that the card suits are in a different order this time.\n\n&gt;Oracle here. N1 investigated /u/Eizero0 result innocent. N2 Investigated /u/Srol \n\nAnd here's the third and final Oracle claim. The lack of supporting information makes me inclined to put less faith in this as opposed to the other one. It's interesting that the two are in direct opposition to one another though. We have to start considering some unusual possibilities: If Eizero0 is guilty, why would the werewolves promote one of their own to greater attention, unless they had some indication that other, damning evidence would surface. If he is innocent, was it simply unfortunate luck for the werewolves that their chosen scapegoat happened to have a Legitimate oracle claim? Or perhaps the real oracle is the first, and one of the other two is a jester or other independent causing trouble? Or they are both werewolves, and this whole contradiction is an effort to distract and undermine the town's efforts? All of these are possibilities.\n\n&gt;I know who you are, serial killer. Play nice for the town and I won't reveal your fakeclaim.\n\nGood job the SK's super dead then.\n\nI feel like this is a Tracker claim. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be at bluepoemage or not, since he largely dropped his fake claim towards the end there.\n\n&gt;It's me again. I forgot to say, I got a free second check last night, and ErisDraconequus is harmful. Signed, the Constable.\n\nBULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSHIT. Do I even need to explain why? I do? Fine.\n\nFirst of all, this doesn't match the tone or writing style at *all*. Second, it also doesn't match the Constable's displayed levels of caution or paranoia. Third, I see no reason why if more information needed to be added, a message board post couldn't simply be updated. Fourth, the idea that there was an extra, unexplained, completely random second investigation strains Occam's Razor so hard it would shatter if was a literal razor. Fifth, even supposing that all of the above was false, the Constable could have added the previous \"verification code\", or created another one, to that message. Hell, in the last paragraph of his own post, he preaches paranoia and caution, and then we're expected to believe he just turns around and says something that insecure and unjustified?\n\nI interpret this as a poorly thought out Jester maneuver by Eris. That, or a fairly impressive Werewolf play.\n\nI need to go eat something.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397866818", "subreddit": "PloungeMafia", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I don't need all the baby steps stuff.) \n\nK) Can you make the Level up spam NOT so invasive? .. it's HUGE .. it's a nightmare while you are in the heat of a battle..\n\nL) The Killer Instinct announcer guys \"M M M M M M  Ultra kill!!!\" guy is entirely too loud..

I remember being so solemn, melancholy, and just wishing things didn't have to be that way, wishing we didn't have to part ways again.

{"body": "So, if you play a C Major scale, there are 7 notes in it: C D E F G A B.  If you play a D Major scale, there are also 7 notes in it: D E F# G A B C#.\n\nIf you tried to memorize the C Major scale across the entire fretboard, you'd see it makes [a certain pattern](http://www.scalerator.com/cgi-bin/sdispatch.py?optionsDisp=none&amp;root=C&amp;pattern=major&amp;tuning=EADGBE&amp;size=30).  If you memorized the D Major scale, you'd see it's [the same pattern, but shifted ahead](http://www.scalerator.com/cgi-bin/sdispatch.py?optionsDisp=none&amp;selLeft=0&amp;menuTab=instructions&amp;root=D&amp;pattern=major&amp;tuning=EADGBE&amp;size=30) by a couple frets.\n\nHowever, the entire scale pattern across 6 strings and 12 frets is kind of intense to take in all at once.  For that reason, you usually see teachers or online instruction break scales down into \"scale positions\".  Usually I think folks break the fretboard down into at least 5 positions (often corresponding to the CAGED approached, but that's a different story ;)).\n\nSo if you're learning by scale positions, an important thing to know is where the \"root note\" is in the pattern.  For example, if you're looking at a diagram of E Minor, you'll want to note where the E note is.  Once you know the pattern though, you can shift it to play in different keys.  So if you've learned an E Minor pattern, you can shift it forward one fret to play in F Minor, or two frets to play in F# Minor, and so on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1397971239", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you don't mind spending money, GURPS Space is the best for this. It doesn't really go into compositions of stars, but it deals with everything you're looking for and more. It doesn't even really need the GURPS rulebook until you use it to design societies (although that step can be overlooked - but I find the society stuff lacking and supplement it with the older GURPS Traveller: First In and other sources) and aliens. For stars, planets and the basics of society, its fine on its own. A scientific calculator is useful, as well as d6s to randomise.\n\nFor free there's [donjon's solar system generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/scifi/system/). It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination - M class stars shouldn't really have garden planets, and it tends to be skewed towards larger planets and no gas giants where GURPS Space is conservative and is weighted to smaller planets and gas giants are more plentiful and in realistic positions. I've never quite figured out how to deal with it, as I'm never entirely happy with the results.

However, it is standalone and quite easy to understand, but it is not as focused on the stars.\n\nThe basics are that the classes A F G K M are the ones that are likely to have planets, O and B don't live long enough to get them, and their remnants can be pretty dangerous, like neutron stars and black holes. Of the rest, As don't live long enough to form life, Ms aren't all that bright and any planet in the Goldilocks zone is likely to be too small, and I've found tidally locking happens on a planet old enough to have life.

We have two conflicting reports on Eizero0. Time for some semi-WiFoM stuff here; my guess is that Eizero0 is the godfather role, unless he can prove his one-shot claim soon (Or was it Srol that he supposedly killed?.  My guess is that the werewolves submitted these to spur an investigation by the actual oracle, and he'd come up as innocent/townie, so we'd assume he was just a hapless victim.\n\nOf course, again, they could be wanting me to think that, and to cast suspicion on Eizero.  But obviously either one or both of these are false claims.  So either the werewolves got lucky with their few fake claims and hit on the same one as the actual oracle, or they submitted both of them.\n\n\n&gt;I, the Oracle, had a revelation! I saw in my crystal ball that /u/Silent331[3] is a Vanilla Townie.\n\nNot much to be said here. This one seems pretty... I don't know, blatantly weak? Like some kind of play.

I forgot to say, I got a free second check last night, and ErisDraconequus is harmful. Signed, the Constable.\n\nWell.... I don't know why he'd get a free second check, so my instinct is that the second one is a fake. Which would implicate Eris to an extent.  But again, by now a lot of these are pretty strange.\n\n&gt;Srol is guilty. Look at previous message board for proof that I investigate him Night 1.

Play nice for the town and I won't reveal your fakeclaim. -Angua.\n\nThis one I had to google, but first result for \"Angua\" is what seems to be a werewolf(ess) with a heart of gold who became a city guard. It talks about her leaving clan Uberwald, which fits with the supposed post from the werewolves as well... But I still don't entirely know what that would make her; probably either a miller or a cop.  We lynched the serial killer, though, and I can't see there being two serial killers... so... I don't know what to make of this either.\n\nTHE SUMMARY:\n\nWe probably have a town-sided werewolf, but otherwise I think the safest bet for today's lynch is Eizero0.

{"body": "I hear the first Bb major chord as a way to lightly tonicize F major the first time, then as a predominant to the A major (V) the second time. I find the bVI is better at drawing the ear towards the dominant and establishing a cadence. The melody never hits either a B or Bb so Koji Kondo is free to use either in the harmony as he sees fit, whether he wants modal/sideways motion or functional/forward motion.\n\nFor a similar example listen to Summertime from Porgy and Bess. Gershwin uses major sixths and even sevenths for modality in the first half of a line, and then switches to more functional harmony, first to set up a half cadence, then an authentic cadence. \n\nEDIT: I just noticed even more similarity. The modal part is played twice in each song, first before an antecedent phrase ending in the dominant, and then before the consequent phrase ending in the tonic.\n\n**A1:** Dorian mode (D F D, D F D, E F E F E C A / Summertime, and the livin' is easy)\n\n**A2:** Functional, leading to a dominant chord, melody ends on II (A D F G A, A D F G E / Fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high)\n\n**C1:** Modal, melodic and harmonic repeat of A1 (D F D, D F D, E F E F E C A / Oh, Your daddy's rich and your mamma's good lookin')\n\n**C2:** Functional, leading to the melody and harmony landing on the tonic (A D F G A, A D / So hush little baby, don't you cry)\n\nI'm sure there are several examples of the same format.

{"body": "Amarynth is one of the best early game mages. Go predator and take drain level one. Your W is a great escape in a pinch with a long range-it makes you extremely mobile and you can jump a ton of walls with it. Your skill order is R &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; W. I usually like my first point in E though because the level 1 damage is better than just Q and gives a nice slow for utility. At level 10 I take Blink for play making or pinch escape if needed. Then level 20 depends on the game. Stasis is nice for waiting on cooldowns-but its really whatever you need.  \n  \nTry to pair yourself in lane with a Bruiser that has some CC (her and Cerulean apparently go way back?). You can combo your abilities with your laning partner very nicely most of the time if they can get in the opponents face safely.  \n  \nIf you are in lane with a squishy target you are guaranteed a kill, if not before, when you hit 6-SHE EVEN SCREAMS \"FEED ME!!\" WHEN USING HER ULT! What does that tell you about her? Bruisers are a little more difficult to kill early but you still can score a kill fairly easily with enough harass. Your E Q puts down tons of harass, the hardest part is learning the missile speed for your E. But lets be honest-any champ would require a similar learning curve. As you move through mid and late game your ult becomes one of the best disruptors and counter engages, especially considering the amount of hard engages in the game right now. Anyone that has dashes can be killed if you wait till they use it or get CC'd.  \n  \nHer abilities scale EXTREMELY well with Power and a bit of Haste rounds it out nicely and you can still build a defensive item or two if needed. A fed Amarynth is FUCKING SCARY. Seriously, don't mess with her if she is on a rampage. My favorite combo in a 1 v 1 situation is E Q W R Drain and they Blink away out of fear, then die. Simple. In teamfights keep positioning in mind as you are somewhat squishy and you will be good.\n  \nIn the late game your passive and reduced cooldowns ensure that as long as you hit a target, you can continue to dish out TONS OF DAMAGE.  \n  \nSilences ruin you though, admittedly. But it doesn't matter, 9 games outta 10 I play Amarynth, and its not because of the boobies (but it is a nice...asset to have). So what are you waiting for?

{"body": "To add a little bit of history, originally this is how the offensive line lined up when the game was young (End, Tackle, Guard, Center): \n\n    E T G C G T E\n\nEven today, the teams must have at least seven players on the line of scrimmage. Only the ones on the outside (the ends) are eligible to catch the ball if thrown. The ends were called tight and split ends depending on how close they were set up to the rest of the line. Eventually the term split end lost favor to the term wide receiver.\n\nThe other four players on offense were the backs, who are all eligible to catch the ball. But in a traditional “I” formation, you would see them like this:\n\n    QB\n    HB\n    FB\n\nwith another back somewhere else in the backfield, or lined up out as a receiver. This is why they are ‘quarter’ ‘half’ and ‘full’ backs. When the game was young, the quarterback called the play, but he was not the one who threw the ball, instead it was snapped to the halfback who either ran, threw, or handed it off to the fullback, and the quarterback was there to block.\n\nEventually that changed so the quarterback became the one who both called the plays and received the ball, and these days they are how /u/Clamwizard described it.\n\nIn addition, you might be interested to know that originally the game was played with a rugby style ball, but the shape and material changed over the years to make passing the ball easier, after the forward pass was legalized.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398152108", "subreddit": "nfl", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Depending on your definition of metal, I would suggest heavier acts such as: Killswitch Engage, Parkway Drive, All That Remains, Vanna, Bury Your Dead, A Day To Remember, Every Time I Die, Gideon etc.\n\nBut in all honesty, the best lead players started as rhythm players. There's a lot to be said about the music that plays in the background, supporting a melody, singer, or some other type of instrumentation. Someone already mentioned Iron Maiden, but they would be a good place to start for metal. Their songs are pretty simple and fun to play through. Everything I've listed requires heavier gauge strings to stay in tune and alternate tunings — so if heavier music isn't your thing, you may check out some of these other responses.\n\nAlso, some fairly basic music theory could really be your friend in this situation. \n\n&gt; A major scale in western music is just a specific set of tones made up of whole steps and half steps. On a piano, playing all of the white keys, from one C to the next is a C major scale, because playing this set of notes contains the pattern:\n&gt; \n&gt; W W H W W W H (whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half). \n&gt; \n&gt; If you don't know which key C is, it's the white key immediately to the left of any set of 2 black keys.\n&gt; \n&gt; Playing a minor scale is just as simple. Starting on an A (the sixth tone of the C major scale), and playing this same set of tones from the C major scale, is an A natural minor scale, which contains the whole step half step pattern:\n&gt; \n&gt; W H W W H W W.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only significance of scales, is for learning to construct chords and visualizing melodies and chord progressions. Taking the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, tone from any major scale will create a major chord. A key is just a set of tones. You mentioned the major and minor pentatonic scale earlier; these are simply the major and minor scales with certain tones removed. In the key of C major (C D E F G A B C), this would be C - E - G — so, the tones C - E - G make up a C major chord. \n\n&gt; Want to create a major 7 chord? There are two major 7 chords in any major key — one chord is built off of our first tone (C) and the other is built from our fourth tone (F). Constructing a major 7 chord, is similar to the three note \"triad\" chord we've just created, but here, we add one more tone: the seventh. Taking the 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 from the key of C major, gives us C - E - G - B — so this is our major 7 chord. Constructing our other major 7 chord (built on the fourth tone of the scale), we use the same method, but we change our starting tone to (F) — the fourth tone of the C major scale. This gives us, F - A - C - E — so, spelling this sequence of tones out on a guitar will give us an F major 7 chord! This type of chord construction can be applied to any genre of music and can benefit any musician. \n\nIf you're interested in what I've just mentioned, there's a plethora of information that can be found at /r/musictheory, and there are many who would be happy to help you along with any questions/concerns you might have.

While mating can be quite ordinary and uneventful like the rest of the animal kingdom there is a special type of mating that requires precision, years of practice and dedication.

One might even argue that it's preposterous how much work goes into satisfying the female specimen, since the possibility of performing this mating ritual is quite rare, very few female specimen are blessed with the necessary anatomy to perform it. Yet, the extraordinary uniqueness of this event motivates male specimens to practice, study and pursue finding a suitable mate dilligently for years until they find 'the one'. The speical specimen whom they can share this unique ritual.\n\n&gt;Scientists have long wondered why male specimens go through so much trouble for this ritual, countless theories have been suggested why male specimens don't simply give up on their pursuit and settle for conventional mating, and perhaps a recent study conducted by /u/lilmisssmartypants can finally answer the question scientists have pondered for eternity. Dr. /u/lilmisssmartypants says that when males perform this ritual succesfully 'You will ruin them for other men.

For example:\n\n&gt;The starting point is a paradox that goes back to the beginnings of probability. Consider a coin that landed heads every time you flipped it. Would you eventually conclude the coin was crooked? Of course you would—just as Dilbert suspected the random number–generating lizard that always output nine! On the other hand, you’d probably find nothing wrong if you saw the following sequence of 30 heads and tails: T H T H H H T H H H H T T H H T H H T H T H T H T H T T H T.\n\n&gt;The paradox is that a fair coin is exactly as likely to produce this sequence as it is to produce 30 heads in a row. Both sequences have the same probability, namely, 2-30 (base 2 numbers are used because there are two options here, heads or tails).\n\n&gt;French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, considering this puzzle in the 1800s, realized that a run of 30 heads is special or meaningful in a way that another sequence is not. **If we instead asked for the probability that we’d get a sequence that was just as random-looking and patternless as the one above, the probability would be almost 1.**\n\nWhat does that mean?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398225530", "subreddit": "math", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What you have to understand is that Schenkerian analysis is predicated a bit on what is called \"melodic fluency.\" which basically involves soothing out skipwise motion by understanding skips as serving an embellishing function. For instance, skips could mean that you have an incomplete upper neighbor (C D F E might be regarded as an embellishment of C D E with the F as an upper neighbor) , or they could signify a \"compound melody\" where the two notes actually signify two different voices. \n\nSo, by smoothing out the surface melodic lines, you come up with one basic representation of a \"model\" voice leading. But then what happens if you treat *that* representation as the new surface and try to apply the principle of melodic fluency again? That is, the smoothed out, largely stepwise representation is then interpreted as containing embellishing tones (passing tones, suspensions, etc.), which in themselves imply skips, which you then treat in the same way you treated them in the previous step. So, our newly-smoothed out C D E is really outlining C E, and if the next note at the surface was D (that is, our line is C D F E D), then we could again consider the E to be acting as an incomplete upper neighbor, making a possible next level of reduction C D. Now you see that we are getting at something that requires nuance and interpretation to get at what is \"really\" there - C {(D [F]) E} D isn't the only way of interpreting our line, of this interpretation would have to do with rhythmic placement, contrapuntal and harmonic support, etc. \n\nThe Fundamental line is what emerges when you completely smooth out all of these levels and arrive at a basic, fundamentally stepwise \"model\" from which all levels below are seen as being various elaborations of. \n\nAlso, good Schenkerian analysis does not \"ignore\" the considerations you've mentioned. But rather it seeks to interpret them as *doing* something within a larger stepwise framework.

Lot's of fun sampling and sexy beats. *Expedition 44* on the other hand is a tech-house album her realeased under his moniker **Gr4m4tik**. \n\n**Mac Miller** kept coming up in some threads here and I realized I'd never really given his last album, *Watching Movies with the Sound Off*, a shot. For a guy that I thought only made Frat Boy music I was pleasantly surprised. He didn't really draw me in with the lyrics but the beats were wonderful. I'll give it another listen when I'm not at work so I can concentrate. \n\nSome more fun futurebeats/instrumental hip-hop from **Teebs**. A name definitely known here. I was reminded of his new LP *E s t a r a* by the header and gave it a listen, as well as his duo with **Jackhigh**, *The Tropics*. Both were enjoyable, but not something that will stick with me forever. \n\nYou, by **Galantis**, aka Christian Karlsson of Miike Snow and Linus Eklow aka Style Of Eye, has been getting a ton of play so I checked out the eponymous EP. These two know how to make some hits. I can see at least one more single off that EP making the rounds. Uplifting progressive house with some fun vocals make it hard not to like. \n\nThe album *R+B=?* by **Aeroc** is a hard one to describe. It reminds me a lot of Boards of Canada, but nothing is like BoC so that's not the perfect fit. Either way it gives you the jist of what you're getting into. Nice downtempo/ambient idm for the work day. \n\n**Max Corbacho** is that dude. Amazing space music from beginning to end on *Arc Lunis*. Basically, space music is soundscapes without drums. One of the purest forms of ambient I've found. Big fan here. \n\n**Daft Punk** need no introduction. I gave *Random Access Memories* another listen after a year of it being out. Does it stand up to what I thought about it last year? Yes. Awesome production on every track. You can hear the effort they put in.

{"body": "Here are some basic things to think about. You might know some of this already but I did my best: \n\n1. While melodies usually follow some sort of progression, sometimes we have what are called \"passing tones\" or \"neighboring tones\". These are not always in the chord or even the scale, but usually connect notes in the chord, which are on stronger beats (strong beats = 1 &amp; 3 in 4/4 time or 1 in 3/4). You don't need a chord change for every note or beat.  \n\n2. In common era theory, basic chords are built in thirds. Even more basic are just 5ths, which are neutral (power chord like C G C). Added tones may change the color, but in the beginning, I would say work to find just a bass note that works and that you like for each part of your progression. Bass keeps time so these will follow some sort of consistent rhythm, even as a fancy riff. This adds an initial structure.\n\n3. Some melodies and chords are related to modes which make finding the ideal bass note more complex. Modes are basically scales that use the same notes but start and end in different places (try playing a C major scale but start and end on a G, for example. You could play a C bass note OR a G even though its a C scale!)\n\n4. Writing in keys-a lot of modern music modulates (changes key) in new sections. \n\n5. It may help to learn roman numerals and how they relate to chords. Example- I IV V in the key of C relates to C major, F major, and G major because those are the chords built on thirds on the 1, 4, and 5 scale degrees of C. You can use roman numerals to reference any key--they just help you find pattern relationships. Another common progression: I vi IV V (C am F G)\n\n6. Bar chords are shapes based on 1, 3, 5 plus any altered scale degrees when they are more complex. For these it helps to think of numbers instead of just keys because guitar patterns transpose really fluidly (piano has black &amp; white thrown in!)\n\n7. Other scales--check out blues, pentatonic, and whole tone scales, and try and think about the modes more--these can give you clues about structure as you write when you recognize them.\n\n\nTl:Dr: find a bass note first before the whole chord/key. Helps if you can experiment by singing your melody and trying different bass notes to find what you like. There may be more than one possibility. You might have more than one key center in your song, that's fine! Chord tones are (usually) emphasized on strong beats. Those can also guide you. \n\nExample: riff of F G A G that repeats.\nYou could play JUST an F bass note under this riff the whole time. Or d, or Bb. Or all of them in a progression that repeats. This riff uses the first 3 notes of F major scale. So you can emphasize F most obviously. But the notes are also part of d minor. And Bb uses these notes also. It doesn't sound as resolute for Bb or dm because F is the 5th note of Bb scale, or the 3rd of dm, whereas F is the root of the F scale so it sounds more stable. \n\nHope this helped, lemme know if I was unclear/ you have questions", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398295107", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I put my acoustic guitar in Frank Gambale \"Nouveau\" tuning--the E A D G strings are tuned up a 4th, to A D G C, and the B E strings are tuned down a 5th, to E A. You have to buy two sets of strings to pull this off but it's so worth it! It's one of the only tunings I can think of--and probably the best--that can pull off very close-voiced piano \"clusters,\" like, for example, an EMaj9 chord that would be spelled out D# E F# G# B, in that *order*, so you don't have to use any special inversions if you don't want to. You can also use normal chord shapes which is a huge advantage--there are tunings that allow for *some* cluster voicings (like DADGAD) but this one really allows you to get pretty much any one you want. You never really need to do harp harmonics ever (like how Chet Atkins/Eric Johnson/Tommy Emmanuel do) because the notes are just all there already under your fingers, and you can play the guitar basically like a harp! \n\nThe only downsides to all this would be that (1) there is a learning curve--different fretboard \"geometry\" going on, and it's kind of strange getting used to the highest-sounding string being the 3rd string instead of the 1st, and (2) it can't be your \"only\" tuning, especially if you want to play lead guitar as well--Frank Gambale himself had a special double-neck guitar built for him that would allow for Gambale tuning on one neck and standard tuning on the other, so he could switch back and forth seamlessly for chordal and lead playing. Other than that though, it's a *lot* of fun, and I would definitely recommend it to those who are just starting to get some more \"complex\" or \"extended\" chord voicings under their belt--any 4- or 5-note chords you know that have all distinct notes (no repeats in different octaves) will take on a whole new life in this tuning.\n\nMy next project will be to get this tuning on an electric guitar, so I can integrate it with my custom-made stereo chorus/delay/reverb patches ;) I think in the end it might end up sounding more like a synth than a guitar--especially with volume swells--but I'm definitely ok with that because I love synths too :) ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398313041", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

The documentation makes an effort to correct this by pinpointing specific examples of what the type signatures translate to, but having lenses be *so general* is both a blessing and a curse at a certain point.\n\nFor example, the `%=` operator is defined like so:\n\n```\n(%=) :: (Profunctor p, MonadState s m) =&gt;\n     Setting p s s a b -&gt; p a b -&gt; m ()\n```\n\nBut really all it does is `modify` a specific piece of an overall state in a `MonadState`.

All in all, every missions so far has played near exactly the same because every mission was 'kill every mindless enemy in sight' with little if any interesting teamwork.  That's a pretty big issue IMO.\n\nThere's a few ways to fix that, how I've always thought of it is: this game is a game.  Games, for as long as they've been around have survived off of finding interesting ways of rehashing the same content over and over again.  Making the same content feel different with each round, giving you an important role, making you really feel like part of a team; all are good ways of keeping something entertaining.  Fixing the AI would do allot of that, making enemies more team based could make teamwork taking them down more important, which would be WONDERFUL.  It'd breath new life into the game.  Giving players more of a way to work together would do allot too (like pushing sentinel mods towards being teamwork based. An example would be: with the click of a button the sentinel moves to a location and projects a short wall blocking projectiles)\n\nAnyways, for melee... 'press E E pause E E E E to do the combo'...

{"body": "the simplest way to think about it is to put everything in its relative major form. Take C major for example. The diatonic chords read as i ii iii IV V vi viio I. Lets say we want to go to Eb instead of E. In the key of C, E is regarded as the iii. When we lower the iii, it has now become a bIII. Why? Because in C Minor the E is flatted as well as the B, so we end up with an Eb major triad. It has become a FLATTED MAJOR triad. The flat coming from E being the normal note in  C major, as opposed to C minor.\n\nNow as far as modes go, lets take Phrygian as an example. Phrygian is a minor scale with a flatted 2. Lets use E as our starting note. E F G A B C D E. In the key of e minor, we have an F#. In Phrygian, the F# has become a normal F, resulting in it being FLATTED. So in Phrygian, we would read the ii chord as bII. Again, making it an F natural makes the new ii chord major, and therefore is now bII as opposed to iio in phrygian.

The first version would work like:\n\n    let output_result result =\n      printf \"The frabbled value is %d\\n\" v\n\n    let test () =\n      let v = frabble true 5 3 in\n      output_result v\n\nThe CPS version would be called like:\n\n    let test () =\n      frabble_cps true 5 3 output_result\n\nSo frabble_cps doesn't really return a value. Instead, it is given a 'callback', that accepts one argument, namely the value the original function would like to return.\n\nOf course, in practice you would use anonymous functions to not disrupt the flow of the code, in addition to being able to capture variables from the scope:\n\n    let test () =\n      frabble_cps true 5 3 (fun result -&gt;\n        printf \"And the result is: %d\\n\" result\n      )\n\nAnd here's a more involved example: let's say we implement a function based on frabble that calculates the frozznel-value. First the regular version (slightly more verbose than it would need to be):\n\n    let frozznel x y =\n      let result1 = frabble true x y in\n      let result2 = frabble false x y in\n      result1 + result2\n\nand in CPS:\n\n    let frozznel_cps x y c =\n      frabble_cps true x y (fun result1 -&gt;\n        frabble_cps false x y (fun result2 -&gt;\n          c (result1 + result2)\n        )\n      )\n\n    let test2 () =\n      frozznel_cps 4 2 (fun result -&gt;\n        printf \"The frozznel is %d\\n\" result\n      )\n\nAnd to be even more practical (at least in ML family languages), one would use monads to thread the continuation, instead of giving it a name (c). That would make it look like:\n\n    let frozznel_monad x y =\n      frabble_monad true x y &gt;&gt;= fun result1 -&gt;\n      frabble_monad false x y &gt;&gt;= fun result2 -&gt;\n      return (result1 + result2)\n\n    let test2 () =\n      frozznel_monad 4 2 &gt;&gt;= fun result -&gt;\n      printf \"The frozznel is %d\\n\" result;\n      return ()\n\n(I only used the monad for the cps style, not for doing pure io.) The benefit of this style is that you don't need to explicitly give a 'cps' argument to functions. When you have a more complicated function (with, say, a few lambda functions involved in the CPS transformation as well) one learns to appreciate that. Of course, you lose some generality, but you can regain them by providing that functionality in the CPS monad.\n\nHope this helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398358410", "subreddit": "compsci", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I put the UML diagram up there to speak to a different audience -- the audience who understands UML diagrams, but not mathematics. It let's me show it to a crowd that only thinks in those terms and say 'you can even see how to access our accessors' with UML.\n\nI get a number of complaints and kudos in almost equal measure for most of the design elements in lens, and try to fix things when the balance tilts too far in one direction. With a project this size, I can't please everyone, so I choose to try to be true to a few goals:\n\n* Be non-prescriptive about how people should use the library\n\n* Put the laws front and center in everything we do. There are no \"monadic lenses\" in lens, because nobody can give me a consistent set of laws for them.\n\n* Let almost everything work with everything for fundamental reasons. We bend over backwards in the implementation to ensure you can use all the combinators in any sensible way with the lens variants that should make sense with them, but without making up something to get ad hoc overloading. Any such overloading should exist because it is the only sensible definition.\n\n* Fit into the cracks in the namespace. It uses gerundive nominals, past tense, leading _'s, borrows the `_1` convention from scala, starts prisms with _Foo, etc to get out of your way and try to maximize the chance that its names won't conflict with yours, so you won't be forced to import it qualified.\n\n* Let people define lenses without having to depend on lens. This lets us break the terrible library dependency order problem up, and makes it possible for other libraries to choose to supply a lens or two if a user asks for it, without having to haul in the library.\n\n* `lens` doesn't try to be the smallest thing that can work. `lens-family` already existed when `lens` was written! Consequently, we decided to ship \"batteries included\" for the Haskell platform.\n\nI hope that I don't try to defend lens from a 'people shouldn't be scared of math' standpoint. I try to be very clear that lens puts together lots of very fundamental things, but I freely admit it does so in very strange ways. It is necessary for lens to work that it leak some information into the types. Otherwise every time I added a point in the lattice of possible optics, I'd need a new set of combinators. If you think lens is bad now, make it take 12 times as many names. ;)\n\nIf I only wanted to appeal to the mathematics crowd, a lens would look more like \n\n    type Iso s t a b = Profunctor p =&gt; p a b -&gt; p s t\n    type Lens s t a b = Strong p =&gt; p a b -&gt; p s t\n    type Prism s t a b = Choice p =&gt; p a b -&gt; p s t\n    ...\n\n`Strong` and `Choice` and `Prism` are made up words, though strong here alludes to monadic strength, choice to `ArrowChoice` and prism was needed for something that sounded like it split. `Strong` and `Choice` are close to saying these are `Representable` and `Corepresentable` profunctors respectively, but make slightly weaker claims.\n\nThis wouldn't serve the goal of adoption, however, as it'd mean you couldn't define a `lens` quickly just using stuff from the `Prelude`.\n\n&gt; Certainly the proliferation of arcane syntax like ^., .~, %~ isn't helping.\n\nThe choice of those 3 operators is something that the lens community spent an awful lot of time trying to get right. I'm sorry that you do not see the utility in them. However, descendants of them go right back to the genesis of lens as a 20 line tiny library so I could talk about field access nicely inside of a physics engine.\n\nI personally find that working with `x^.foo.bar.baz` is very convenient when thinking of lenses as field accessors. It appeals to the vulgar sensibilities I acquired writing in imperative languages like Pascal, C/C++, Eiffel, etc. before coming to Haskell, and it nicely encapsulates all of the power of Erik Meijer's [\"The power is in the dot\"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.146.5411) behind a sightly more principled back end that can now sensibly be fully bidirectional.\n\nIf you don't like operators. you can use them as `view`, `set` and `over`.\n\nIn lens literature `view` is commonly called `get` and `set` is commonly called `put`.\n\nIf you never want to work with anything more complex than a lens then that is enough to get by.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398359893", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 30, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**--------= = = = J A P A N E S E = = = =--------**\n\nMy vision for the Japanese would be a more Archer-centric civ, reflecting the actual fighting style of the Japanese in medieval times. The Japanese prowess with swords is memetic nowadays but highly inaccurate. The sword was almost never used as a main weapon between 400-1600 AD. It was only after medieval times when swords were worshipped. My Japanese civ would make more use of Archery. Japanese Siege was also pitiful in real life, so my idea is to give the Japanese Archers strong anti-building capabilities. Seeing the Longbowmen in AoE2 be so effective while seeing the Saracen anti-Building attack bonus to Archers be so weak made me want to come up with something in between.\n\nMost important units:\n\nSamurai - Some sort of archer/melee hybrid.\n\nComposite Bowmen - With high range and attack bonus vs Buildings, they are the Japanese' primary building destroyers.\n\nHandgunners - They do huge damage to buildings but do not have the range bonuses thus function more similarly to Infantry who must get close to Buildings and take them down. They are meant for anti-Cavalry functions.\n\nCavalry Archer - For speed and raiding purposes, plus they still benefit from anti-building attack.\n\nHalberdier - As a meatshield to protect Archers from Cavalry who try to close in, allowing Archers to pump out damage.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**UNIQUES AND BONUSES**\n\n&gt;Foot Archers + 1,2,3 Range starting in Dark Age\n\n* The whole point of this is to give the Archers enough range to beat fortifications. This is clearly the Britons' bonus in AoE2. The Longbow didn't have exceptional range like it's presented in AoE2, and really the longest range bows came from Asia, especially the Mongol and Turkish ones. Japanese bows threw up lighter arrows and outranged alot of European bows, but didn't especially outrange the Mongol and Turkish ones. HOWEVER, the idea of a civ that lacks Siege weapons and uses Archers instead wouldn't work with the Mongols (who have Siege weapons) and Turks (who have gunpowder). So I gave it to the Japanese since they lacked Siege weapons almost entirely for most of their history.\n\n&gt;Archery Range units do 3x damage vs Buildings\n\n* Works with the last bonus. Foot Archers are thus useful for destroying enemy fortifications but Handgunners become ridiculously good for destroying buildings, too. This is 3x damage, not +3 damage or anything. So any net damage an Archer does after attacking a building is increased threefold. A Handgunner has naturally high attack that overcomes the armor of a building, allowing them to do HUGE damage to Buildings, and allows them to destroy buildings faster than most Infantry. Of course, the Handgunner does not benefit from the range bonus and is in harms way while firing upon a building but he makes a good substitute for Infantry. The Japanese had the most rifles in the world when they got ahold of them, so it would make sense for them to use tons of Handgunners. The Japanese would also demolish buildings using multiple smaller cannons and did not develop large caliber guns so this is even more historical.\n\n&gt;?Economic Bonus?\n\n* I was thinking of transplanting the old Britons Town Center bonus to the Japanese to go along with the obviously transplanted Archer bonuses. The Japanese tended to have a very loose government system with their central governments being quite weak, which meant that the towns and cities were the most important institutions of government. This bonus would be quite strong by the end game, and that makes sense because the Portuguese reported that Japan was highly urbanized by the time they visited them.\n\n&gt;?Economic Bonus?\n\n* Probably something like \"Ships cost -10%\" which affects Fishing Ships as well as warships. The Japanese fought large scale battles with small Galleys so they should have cheaper warships.\n\n&gt;Team Bonus: Archery Ranges work +20% faster\n\n* The Japanese were producing the most rifles in the world by the end of the medieval period so this works. Plus they always had an affinity for Archers moreso than melee Infantry for the majority of their existence.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Samurai: Archer who does true damage?\n\n* My idea for the Samurai would be to incorporate their Archery history as well as their Infantry history. They would do neither hack or pierce damage, but ignore enemy armor due to their swordsmanship (and \"naginataship?\") and archery skills. When enemy units close in, their attack animation would switch to a sword or a naginata (vs Cavalry). They'd have the tough stats of an Infantry unit and the range of an Archer. They would have poor base Range but thanks to their bonus it would be equal to a regular Archer. This would also work beautifully vs Buildings as they ignore building armor and do way more damage thanks to their bonus but unlike the regular Japanese Archers, Samurai would be vulnerable to building fire (which is okay since they have tougher stats, see how they are basically Infantry-Archers?). Samurai would have very low base attack power, though, to balance out the fact that they ignore enemy armor. Samurai would be affected by Infantry upgrades, even the Attack upgrades. Samurai would also be very strong vs Siege. So it seems like they have no weaknesses? They would still be beaten by other Archers, and unlike most Infantry, they would be weak against stronger Cavalry.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Bushido: Samurai gain attack bonus vs Unique Units\n\n* This would be a call back to AoE2. Historically, Samurai would make it a point to engage the most elite and famous soldier in the enemy army, and those units are usually your Unique Units.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Ashigaru: Archery Range units, Samurai +1 Range, +1 Attack\n\n* The Ashigaru were common peasants who were armed with Bows (and later rifles) and would accompany their Lords on campaign. So that's why it affects Archery Range units. The +1 Attack would be huge for Samurai, and it would basically be +3 Attack vs Buildings for regular Archers. Cavalry Archers,  Handgunners, and Skirmishers would be affected, as well. The use of Ashigaru was revolutionary in Japan and slowly but surely sapped the Samurai class of their dominance.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS:**\n\n&gt;Infantry: full, maybe they'd miss the last armor?\n\n* The Japanese would still have a strong and full Infantry line. This would make them quite a bit like the Britons in AoE2. In real life, the Japanese favored staff weapons such as the Naginata for melee fighting. They have the Great Swordsman and there are instances of Japanese soldiers using huge swords as anti-Cavalry weapons. They won't need GSwords too much because their Archers counter Infantry just fine. Instead, Pikes and Halbs would be best to serve as meatshields to protect their frail Archers.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: no Camels, Light Cavalry, Cavaliers, some other Cavalry techs)\n\n* Of course, the Japanese Stable must remain weak. They had poor grazing lands and their heavy cavalry was only better than the Koreans, but that's not exactly an accomplishment.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Elephants, Arbalister, Atlatl Skirmisher, maybe they'd miss the last armor upgrade? no Composite Bowman?\n\n* There are no Elephants in Japan. No Atlatls either.\n\n* There's a little evidence of crossbows here and there but they didn't use them due to lack of materials and because of their strong and near-religious archery tradition.\n\n* The Japanese didn't *quite* have Composite Bows the same as the rest of Asia but their Bows are similar enough in construction technique to count as composite, just not materials since they lacked large mammals whose sinews and bones could be used for it.\n\n* Cavalry Archers get +1 Attack and +1 Range (but they'd miss at least one Cavalry tech to make up for) and 3x damage to buildings, and are a strong option for the Japanese which makes sense in history because Samurai fought as Cavalry Archers for a long time. \n\n* Handgunners with +1 Atk and +1 Rng and 3x damage vs Buildings.\n\n* Composite Bowmen with +1 Atk, +1 Rng, 3x damage to buildings, +3 Range by Imp.\n\n* All units are created +20% faster.\n\n* Though they miss Atlatl, their Skirmishers get +1 Range and +1 Atk so that makes them very good.\n\n* I want them to miss the last armor upgrade so that enemy Archers have an easier time vs Japanese ones. In their few foreign conflicts, Japanese Archers got beaten up by Mongol Horse Archers and Korean Archers. They might miss other upgrades that makes them less effective vs flesh and blood units.\n\n&gt;Siege...ry?: no Capped Ram, no Mangonel (and no Onager), no Siege Tower, no Bombard.\n\n* The Japanese Siege tech tree should be highly lacking. The Japanese are not documented as using siege engines until the advent of gunpowder.\n\n* In AoE2, they had Heavy Scorpions and uber Trebuchets, so they were okay-ish at Siege. In my version, they are like the Turks and Huns in AoE2 such that they only have the basic Onager line unit, worsening their ability to counter enemy Archers. No final Ram upgrade, either.\n\n* The Japanese loved gunpowder when they got them and they'll have access to Cannon but no Bombard. During the Imjin Wars, the Japanese did not have large calibur guns and had access only to smaller ones.\n\n&gt;Navy: miss late game techs, early game bonuses\n\n* I don't have interesting Naval gameplay in mind yet, but the Japanese Navy should actually be kind of crappy, at least late game. Age of Empires 2 depicts them as being pretty good but in the few organized conflicts they had with rival nations they got their asses handed to them at sea. Interestingly during the Imjin Wars, the Koreans expected to beat the Japanese on land but to face a tough fight on the water due to Japan being an archipelago. It turned out to be the reverse: Korea was a seafaring nation who relied on trade and had advanced ship technology and whipped the Nipponjin at sea, while Japan had been in a civil war fought primarily on land and had no time to develop their naval tech so they kicked the Korean army's teeth. Their ships were pretty crappily constructed and they used some old, old technology. Still, the Japanese are an island nation and when they had battles against each other, they would have impressive massed galley vs galley combat so they should probably have some sort of an early naval bonus as well as an economic bonus for water.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398364992", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I had thought about making them much more similar to the In real life, the Mongols' weakness was economics and governmental unity. So I'd make the Mongols a much more militarily-oriented civilization with a weak economy, but at the same time it would be very difficult to encroach upon the Mongol players' home territory and beat their economy.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**UNIQUES AND BONUSES**\n\n&gt;Villagers benefit from Archer Blacksmith upgrades\n\n* This is similar to the Inca bonus in AoE2: The Forgotten except more useful overall. In real life, virtually ever Mongol citizen would be skilled with a bow (and horsemanship but let's pretend that the Mongol army has hoarded all the horses for themselves).\n\n&gt;Villagers +1,2,3 Range starting in Dark Age\n\n* This is kind of a silly bonus, but it would make Villagers extremely hard to fight. On the flipside, it also makes the Mongols better at forward building.\n\n&gt;Light Cavalry upgrades free\n\n* The Mongol HP bonus in AoE2 is inferior to the Turkish bonus in almost every way, so I decided to give them this one. This makes the Mongols prime economic raiders and supplements their Villager bonus.\n\n&gt;Cavalry Archers attack +20% faster\n\n* The Cavalry Archer attack bonus stays, as it makes alot of sense for the Mongols.\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: Military buildings give +5 population\n\n* The Slavic team bonus in AoE2: The Forgotten. It fits the Mongols perfectly, as one of their strongest traits was their army's ability to stay on the move without permanent settlement.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Mangudai: Anti-Siege Cavalry Archer\n\n* The Mangudai would be overall more offensive than the regular Cavalry Archer, but the Mangudai would be much more frail and weak to anti-Archer and Cavalry units, especially Skirmishers and Camels. They'd regain their ability to destroy all Siege weapons that they had in AoE2 (Forgotten took away their bonus except vs Rams and Trebs).\n\n&gt; Unique Tech: Adaptivism\n\n* The Mongols had a unique world view and of their place in it. They were semi-nomads, never staying in one place for long and as such they had to be flexible. Not only did they view themselves as more robust than their agriculturally based neighbors, but they were flexible enough to adopt new weapons, ideas, tactics, technology, cultures, and religions. I'm not sure what it will actually do in gameplay but I really want a technology that displays this aspect of the Mongols.\n\n&gt; Unique Tech: World Conquest? Pax Monglica?: Trebuchets pack, unpack, and fire +33% faster\n\n* The Mongols were always on a path of World Conquest. They left that legacy upon their successor states, such as the Mughals and the Golden Horde. They believed that it was their destiny to conquer the entire world. Pax Mongolica is the concept that after the Mongol conquest, the various countries that they ruled were now connected by one administration and intangible ideas and tangible goods began to flow all over the now Mongol-ruled world relatively quickly compared to before. At any rate, I want the Mongols to have an awesome early Imperial and wreck their enemies. Most of the other civs get a game-changer Unique Tech but the Mongols get a specific and cheap, but powerful one. Trebuchets will be available as soon as the Imperial Age starts, so Mongols can bust out some ridiculous Trebs and destroy their enemies. However they won't have their post-Imperial prowess they had in Age of Empires 2 due to the fact that the Mongol Empire and successor states mostly disintegrated (except for the Mughals). The Trebuchet was one of the most iconic weapons in the Mongol arsenal, and they used Arab-designed Trebuchets to fight the Chinese, who had never seen Trebuchets like that.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS:**\n\n&gt;INFANTRY: no Pikeman, Halberdier, Great Swordsman\n\n* I always wondered why the Mongol Infantry was kind of good in AoE2. In Age of Kings, there were no Halberdiers so the Mongols actually got fully upgraded Infantry. In The Conquerors, they didn't receive Halberdiers but Drills made their Siege Rams so good that you could get away with Siege Rams + Champions. In real life the Mongols did not have any Infantry forces that came from their own ranks. They often relied on conquered forces to provide Infantry, whether it was forcing conquered populations to be their meatshields or willingly allied and organized Infantry units like that of the Armenians.\n\n&gt;CAVALRY: no Cavalier\n\n* Just like in AoE2, they miss the final Heavy Cavalry upgrade. HOWEVER the Mongols did make use of heavy cavalry and lancers. Actually, if we were to discount allied nations providing Siege Weapons, the Mongols in real life were much more like the Huns in AoE2.\n\n&gt;ARCHERY: no Arbalister, Handgunner, Atlatl Skirmisher\n\n* The only fully upgraded, foot Archer unit the Mongol should get is the Composite Bowman since they were almost entirely mounted. They get Elephant Archers since they did use them when they were in India but they lack the economy to make use of them so the Elephants are there for historical completion. Their Elephant Archers do shoot +20% faster, though.\n\n&gt;SIEGERY: no full?\n\n* There are a couple of different directions to take the Mongols. In AoE2, the Mongols were Siege kings. In real life, this is kind of hard to assess. The Mongols relied on other cultures and peoples to provide Siege equipment but they themselves did not use this much. Some civs in AoE2 were pretty schizo about whether or not they would use their real-life related or subject nations' abilities or not. If all civs in AoE2 were allowed to use the abilities of their real life allies, then they would all pretty much have full tech trees. The road I want to put the civs is a middle ground one. The Mongols thus have strong Siege, especially with Trebuchets. \n\n* The Mongols were one of the few civs to truly use anti-personnel Siege weapons while many of the other civs did not use anti-personnel weapons until the advent of the cannon. However the Mongols would already have very powerful units such as Cavalry Archers for use against flesh and blood units. For history's sake, it would make sense to give the Mongols my anti-personnel Siege weapons, the Scorpio/Cannon, the Onager, and the Siege Tower. However gameplay would dictate giving the Mongols good anti-Building capabilities with Siege, and using their Cavalry for anti-personnel.\n\n&gt;NAVY: \n\n* The Mongol Navy shouldn't be particularly good as they weren't known for their naval accomplishments, although they did beat the Song Dynasty a couple times on the water (using former Chinese for this purpose but still). Their population bonuses might be a small help in that regard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398368148", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**--------= = = = C H I N E SE = = = =--------**\n\nThe Chinese are wayyy different than they were in AoE2, and are actually probably a little closer to how the Turks were in AoE2. In real life, the medieval Chinese relied on their population and mass levies of cheap soldiers armed with their advanced technology to get things done. They had an extremely powerful economy thanks to their huge population but I figured that giving them a million military bonuses should be balanced out by giving them no economic bonuses (but they would have a good economy otherwise).\n\nThe Chinese most important units:\n\nZhuge Nu - Back in 1999, we used to pronounce this as Chu Ko Nu but now that Romanization of Mandarin has been refined, we should call them Zhuge Nus. Rapid-firing Crossbows who now have lower attack power but higher accuracy and rely on multiple arrows hitting enemies for damage.\n\nHandgunner - The Handgunner/Crossbowman line receives a weaker version for use in the earliest Age, and the Chinese upgrade this line for free as they age up, making them very strong militarily.\n\nOnager - For anti-Archer purposes.\n\nCannon - For additional damage vs Infantry and Cavalry.\n\nPetards - Get +99 pierce armor and can thus blow down fortifications very easily.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**BONUSES AND UNIQUES**\n\n&gt;Nu Shou available at Archery Range in Dark Age\n\n* The Nu Shou is like a mini-Arbalister, available in the Dark Age at the Archery Range. The Chinese are the only civ to receive this unit, and it's a powerful unit in the Dark Age with high attack and range, and an attack bonus vs Cavalry, allowing them to beat up nearly anything except for Archers and Slingers. The Nu Shou would automatically upgrade to Arbalister as soon as the Chinese hit the Feudal Age, while most civs with access to Arbalister would have to research an upgrade and only have access in late Feudal Age, making the Chinese very powerful.\n\n&gt;Arbalister free\n\n* The Crossbow is China's most iconic weapon. No other civilization is as synonymous with a weapon as the Chinese are with Crossbows. The Chinese invented the Crossbow in Antiquity when the Horse Archer civs were barely breeding horses with enough stamina that could carry them around in battle, and just before the Romans fought Celtiberians wielding the forerunner to the Gladius. That's why they get a Crossbowman in the Dark Age, and also why those Crossbowmen upgrade into Arbalisters immediately.\n\n&gt;Chemistry free\n\n* Thanks to this, the Chinese have early access to gunpowder and their Arbalisters upgrade immediately into Handgunners when they reach Imperial.\n\n&gt;Population +13%\n\n* The Chinese have the highest possible population ceiling of any civilization because in real life they always had the biggest population.\n\n&gt;Start with +1 Villager, -50 F\n\n* I'd make it so that they start with an extra Villager but also they have enough population room to create another Villager thanks to the previous bonus. The Chinese had the largest population at the beginning of the Dark Ages, as well as later on in the medieval period.\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: \n\n* I haven't come up with a good Teams Bonus yet. I want every Teams Bonus to be useful (unlike such gems like Knights +2 LoS)\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Nu Shou\n\n* Nu Shou approximates to \"Crossbow user,\" Nu meaning \"crossbow\" (like in Chu Ko Nu or Zhuge Nu) and \"Shou\" meaning user.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Zhuge Nu Shou: Fast-firing Crossbow.\n\n* Zhuge Nu is simply the proper, now accepted way to pronounce the Chinese phrase that we used to pronounce as \"Chu Ko Nu\" back in 1999. Zhuge Liang an ancient Chinese politician, inventor, scholar, and military strategist who invented the Zhuge Nu. Zhuge Nu means \"Zhuge's Crossbow.\" The Zhuge Nu would now hit with all 5 arrows accurately every time, but the attack power would be highly reduced. Vs units with high pierce armor, this is a very good thing. Vs units with low pierce armor, they end up doing roughly the same damage as a Composite Bowman. This unit is not really like the Handgunner line at all, but the point is that it can't be upgraded like the Composite Bowman line can be (whereas in AoE2, it was a full on foot Archer affected by Blacksmith upgrades).\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Land Mines: Petards +99 pierce armor\n\n* The Chinese would have the best Petards who are immune to arrow fire, allowing them to be used extremely effectively vs Buildings.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Fire Arrow: Something that affects Cannons, Zhuge Nu, and Handgunners.\n\n* fucks\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Standardization: Everything costs -5%\n\n* My favorite thing about the Chinese is the fact that they invented the concept of Standardization: every skilled builder in the country would be given blueprints for screws, bolts, beams, arrowheads, blades, etc. Carpenters had to adhere to building codes. Nearly any blacksmith could replace the parts in your Crossbow even if you were all the way in Xianjiang (well, maybe not that far). The Chinese were practically an Industrialized civilization in every way except without the steam engine. So it makes sense for them to receive a technology that makes all other techs and units cheaper. I just don't know where to put it.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry: full, maybe no final armor upgrade?\n\n* The Chinese fought mostly in Infantry formations, especially when the Song Dynasty was restricted to Southern China where grazing land is limited so cavalry was difficult to use. They made use of Pikes, Halberds, as well as giant Swords vs Cavalry. I was thinking of taking away the final armor upgrade. Historically, the Chinese are the most prolific Blacksmiths on the planet. On the flipside, they didn't use huge, heavy suits of armor because they'd rather conserve iron for weapons and put out 20 shittily protected guys rather than 2 well protected guys.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: no Light Cavalry, Cavalier, Camel Cavalry\n\n* The Chinese Stable is weaker than it is in AoE2. In AoE2, the Chinese received a fully upgraded Camel somewhat inexplicably even though the Chinese rarely used them as mounts. But they still occupied the Gobi Desert and Xianjiang region quite often so they should at least get Camels. Given the Chinese' strong penchant for anti-Cavalry Archers, I took away the Camel Cavalry unit.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Atlatl, War Elephant, no final Archer attack upgrade?\n\n* The Chinese had the technology for Composite Bows and use composite materials in their Crossbows but didn't use many regular bows made of those materials. So much so I was thinking of taking away the final Archer attack upgrade. The Chinese get Elephant Mahouts since they did have access to a few Elephants in the far South but only used them a few times.\n\n&gt;Siege: no Sheltered Ram\n\n* They get every Siege unit except they only have the basic Ram. This is historically inaccurate but their Siege is very strong thanks to their Unique Tech Fire Arrow, so they had to get a weakness somewhere.\n\n&gt;Navy:\n\n* I want to depict Chinese naval technology while also demonstrating their lack of desire for exploration and bad-ish naval military record. So they should probably receive most technologies but have no specific bonus for it.

They would be a mainly cavalry civilization with some ranged support, and they would be based on gold. My idea for them is to have a strong ass army made up of gold-intensive units kind of like the Turks in AoE2. This works out beautifully because militarily, the Ghana loved cavalry. However once they lose their gold...they start to suck dick (kind of like the Turks in AoE2).\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**IMPORTANT UNITS**\n\n* Farima: Anti-Building?\n\n* Camelry: Anti-Cavalry, meatshield unit\n\n* Cavalier: Anti-Archer\n\n* Composite Bowman: Anti-Infantry\n\n* Great Swordsman: Anti-Infantry, Anti-Cavalry\n\n* Onager: Anti-Archer\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**BONUSES AND UNIQUES**\n\n&gt;Villagers gather gold +15% faster\n\n* Duh.\n\n&gt;Composite Bowmen +25% HPs\n\n* The majority of Mali's foot forces were Archers so I've given them extra HP. I kind of imagined the Ghana being like the Huns, with a principal Archer unit and a principal Cavalry unit so the Archers get higher HP to make them more like Cavalry Archers.\n\n&gt;Start with +50 Gold\n\n* The Kingdom of Ghana was extremely powerful and existed around my timeframe for the Dark Ages. Arab Chroniclers claimed they had as many as 100 to 200 thousand soldiers (holy shit). So the Ghana should start off with a few extra resources for some early game aggression.\n\n&gt;TEAM BONUS: Trade Carts generate +25% Gold?\n\n* Trade was the lifeblood of the Western African civilizations, especially given their agreeable capital of gold. I've toned it down from the Spanish Team Bonus in AoE2, and the Ghana benefit more because they get a UT that gives them more trade gold.\n\n&gt;UNIQUE UNIT: Farima: Slow, ranged, anti-Building Camel\n\n* The Farima is a compromise between the Mameluke and the Tarkan. I originally imagined the Ghana as being the closest thing to the Huns in the last game except with a toned down economy. The Tarkan was not extremely useful in AoE2 but I figured that it would be more useful if it was anti-Cavalry. Furthermore, Age of Chivalry: Hegemony features a Tarkan equivalent unit known as the Gwaster (which upgrades to the Kigner). Instead of just being a regular ass Cavalry unit with anti-Building capabilities, it has a small range and throws it's torches at everything. This is genius, as it allows many Gwasters to huddle around a Building and wreck it. Mamelukes were borderline OP in AoE2 so I figured I'd keep them good vs Cavalry but make them less good vs everything else and viola, here's the Farima. The Farima in real life was a heavy cavalryman and not camelry so that's inaccurate but hey we can't make everything 100% accurate. Farimas were the closest equivalents to Knights that the Mali had. The Ghana have crappy anti-building Siege, so this dude makes up for it.\n\n&gt;UNIQUE TECH: Salt and Gold: All gold income +15%\n\n* This is co-opted from AoE2: The Forgotten's Indian UT Sultans. Sultans is weak in that game but here 10% keeps it from being OP and it works out very well with the other bonuses. Salt was the most important commodity to the West African kingdoms and combined with gold they had very favorable trade balances with other countries. The Ghana should lack a Gold Mining upgrade to make up for the strength of this tech.\n\n&gt;UNIQUE TECH: Mandekalu: Camel units +30 HPs\n\n* I took the Mameluke away from the Saracens, might as well take Zealotry, too. The \"Mandekalu\" was the name of Mali's Army in the medieval period.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;INFANTRY: no Spearman, Halberdier\n\n* I don't know a whole lot about Ghana's Infantrymen besides their love of Archers but if the majority of their Infantry were Archers it makes sense that their melee Infantry was rather sucky. But to keep the theme of expensive gold units, they get a fully upgraded Great Swordsmen. Their Spearman line is nearly non-existent like the Turks.\n\n&gt;ARCHERY: no Elephants, Archer Cavalry, Arbalister, Handgunner, Atlatl\n\n* The West African kingdoms loved Archery and they loved Cavalry but didn't really put two and two together; the craziest part is that the Savannahs and the Sahel were open and flat enough for Horse Archery would have been super powerful. But this was because their bow technology was not especially powerful. Turkish and Mongol bows became so intricate and powerful so that smaller, easier to wield weapons could be used on horseback and still have the punch of a big ass bow that a footman could use. The fact that they get Composite Bowmen is egregious in this case but that upgrade represents how vital Archery was to them, not a historical detail. Anyway, I like to think that *somebody* might have though combining the two as a good idea so they don't fully miss the unit. The Ghana didn't have access to Elephants (\"but they're from Africa!\" a more ignorant man may shout), and no Atlatls, either. They also didn't get Crossbow tech, nor did they get gunpowder and the Songhai were in fact destroyed by Moroccan Berbers using rifles.\n\n&gt;CAVALRY: no Light Cavalry\n\n* Again, no good trash units. But they get Paladins AND Camels and use both extremely effectively. The Mali imported tons of horses and were dominant because of their heavy cavalry tactics. They actually didn't use Camels much militarily but whatever.\n\n&gt;SIEGERY: no Capped Ram, Siege Tower, Cannon, Bombard\n\n* There is almost no information about West African siege weaponry. So they get a really crappy Siege tech tree, except for Onagers because I want them to be forced to use gold-intensive units. Their best anti-building weapon is the Trebuchet (which costs a fuck ton of gold).\n\n&gt;MONKERY:\n\n* I don't have much info on Monks for each civilization but I want the Ghana to have some fairly strong Monks backed up by alot of gold.\n\n&gt;NAVERY:\n\n* The West African kingdoms fought naval battles on the rivers on galleys. I'm imagining the gold bonus being decent for rushing ships but they should lack some technologies.\n\n&gt;DEFENSERY:\n\n* The Ghana should be a very offensive civilization and be lacking in many defensive techs. No Bombard Tower, no Fortified Wall, or whatever it's equivalent I'm going to put in this game.\n\n&gt;ECONOMERY:\n\n* The West African empires wouldn't have had much access to lumber on the Savannahs so they'd lack in lumberjacking techs.\n\n* In order to give the Ghana a decent chance on the water, though, I'd like to give them some way of trading their Gold for Wood at the market for an early advantage.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**OTHER STUFF**\n\n&gt;Language: Songhai\n\n* The civilization is called the Ghana, they are mainly based on the Mali, but their culture is based on the Songhai.\n\n&gt;Wonder: Great Mosque of Timbuktu", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398371793", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

I guess the alternative is last-hitting with Q (55 mana) and not taking any harass for it, but I find that it's easier to take multiple last-hits with E up (3-4 CS with no harass) than to try to kill multiple creeps with Q consistently, so E is still more mana-efficient for farming.\n\nHonestly, I frequently don't even push Q until level 5; it's just horribly mana-inefficient at ranks 1-2 (it has a static cost, so the efficiency gets better every time you level it).  Diana's most efficient trade against ranged champs is charging 2 passive hits on minions, then proccing the 3rd on her opponent with Q R and shielding the retaliation with W -- she can't do that until 6.  It's worthwhile to poke your enemy down before 6 if you think you can get them low enough to burst out when you ping 6 with Q W R P R, but, for the most part, it's advisable to just play super passively until you can out-trade them.\n\nThe reason I don't take E is because, if you use E, you're contributing to your lane loss.  Best-case, you can land a couple more autos with E than you would, otherwise, but it will not be 3 attacks with your early attack speed and E's early slow, so you won't get a passive proc (you should get your first passive proc immediately when you R).  70 mana for 100 extra damage (2 AAs) is so not worth.  Anything else you did with that mana would've been better-spent.  That extra point in W costs you *10* mana and gives you 30-ish damage and 30 extra shield.  Another point in Q would give you 1 second shorter cooldown and 30-ish extra damage *for zero mana*.\n\nThe exceptions are (1) when your jungler is being a bro (the CC adds 2-ish more Diana autos *plus* whatever your jungler can now land) and (2) when you're strong enough to beat up your opponent, anyway, so extending trades is your *goal* (where, otherwise, having the extra shield to negate post-aggression harass is a better investment).\n\ntl;dr W is Diana's bread-and-butter skill before she can kill things at 6, and, after 6, her passive becomes her bread and butter (you will lose trades just pushing Q R W).

{"body": "**--------= = = = I N C A S = = = =--------**\n\nI wanted to characterize all of the American civs as being unreliant on gold, and so the Inca are a trash civ. This makes sense since the units that use the most gold are the ones that the Incas did not have access to or use in real life.\n\nMy Incas are a bit of a reference to The Forgotten Incas: instead of getting Skirmishers with no minimum range, they get cheaper Skirms. Instead of Kamayuks, they get cheap Pikemen (who have +1 Range in my ideas!).\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**BONUSES AND UNIQUES**\n\n&gt;Slingers, Pikemen cost -25%\n\n* The Incas two primary units are the Pikeman and the Atlal Skirmisher, so here we go. This bonus is clearly taken from the Byzantines in AoE2.\n\n&gt;Slingers move +15% faster\n\n* All of the Meso civs have this bonus, which makes their Slingers almost like Cavalry Archers. The Inca UU is also affected by this.\n\n&gt;Villagers move +10% faster\n\n* The native peoples of the Andes are famous for being extremely hardy, with noticeable adaptations to the higher elevation like more efficient blood. This combined with the Inca roads makes for a logical eco bonus.\n\n&gt;Villagers gather Stone +20% faster\n\n* The old Korean eco bonus. This is extremely weak by itself but combined with faster movement, maybe not so much. The Incas are still somewhat weak economically but they get cheaper trash like the Byzantines, who lack a true eco bonus, so I figured they'd balance out. This is a very historically accurate bonus, as the Inca collected Stone like mofos and built big ass walls and roads and monuments.\n\n&gt;Start with a Slinger instead of a Rider\n\n* The Eagle Warrior is now an Aztec UU but combined with the faster movement speed and range, the Slinger makes a fine scout.\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: \n\n* I was thinking of a Farm bonus somewhere here since Incan Farming was pretty freaking great.\n\n&gt; Unique Unit: Ayllo: Fast foot Archer\n\n* The old Plumed Archer except in Inca form. This dude is almost a faster, better Slinger but without the anti-Archer power. The Ayllo is more like a Cavalry Archer without the cavalry weakness much like the Plumed Archers are in AoE2.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Coca Leaves: All units +25% HPs\n\n* Coca leaves were and are used by the people of Eastern South America to boost their stamina. Coca leaves, as you may guess, are the source of C-C-C-C-C-C-COCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIINE. I love the idea of Inca soldiers hopped out on drugs. This also affects their Villagers, but it's not that powerful. This is most useful or the Inca trash units who can survive longer to dish out more attack bonus damage.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Four Regions United: All units do +25% attack.\n\n* Four Regions United is the meaning of the Inca word for their Empire, Tawantinsuyu. The Inca units are varied and come from different parts of the Empire, and together they are a formidable fighting force. This is like a more crazy version of the Aztecs' Garland Wars. It's really great for the Inca's reliance on trash, allowing them to do huge damage thanks to their attack bonuses. I try to make the Unique Techs more relevant to the civilization and more grandiose, unlike the absolutely shitty Unique Tech names in The Forgotten.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry: no Great Swordsman, miss Blacksmith techs?\n\n* A great sword needs a shit ton of iron to make so the Inca will be having none of that shit. They will get Halbs because they need a nice, durable meatshield unit. The Inca will, however, lose out on a couple of Blacksmith techs (but they get more than the Aztecs and Mayans). This is balanced out by their Imperial Age UT.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Elephants, Mounted Archer, Arbalister, Handgunner, Composite Bowman, no Blacksmith techs?\n\n* The Inca are entirely lacking in the Archery Range, which is all historical and nice. The Composite Bowman is not a great loss because they get Ayllo, who are more like Archers than Slingers. They also miss a few Blacksmith techs to tone down their super buff Atlatl Skirms.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: none\n\n* Yeah, FUCK YOU INCAS.\n\n&gt;Siege: no Mangonel, Siege Tower, Cannon, Bombard\n\n* The Inca lack the Onager and Mangonel entirely, but that's okay because they can mass up buff ass Atlatl Skirmishers to take out Archers. The only Siege weapons they get that are worth using is the Capped Ram. However their Capped Ram is great because of higher HPs (almost like a Celt!) and they do wicked damage vs Buildings. The Inca lacked what we'd call Siege Weapons entirely, and their main way of Sieging enemies was to throw masses of dudes at buildings. The Capped Ram is for gameplay purposes, as the Inca are otherwise handicapped against buildings.\n\n&gt;Navy:\n\n* Incas never went conquering other peoples via the ocean. The Incas should have a piss poor navy except their ships have +25% more HPs and do +25% more damage to keep the competitive on the water.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398374403", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I said I’m wondering if they’re better off under government subsidy, and their young women are having the abortions and their young men are in jail, and their older women and their children are standing, sitting out on the cement porch without nothing to do, you know, I’m wondering: Are they happier now under this government subsidy system than they were when they were slaves, and they was able to have their family structure together, and the chickens and garden, and the people had something to do? And so, in my mind I’m wondering, are they better off being slaves, in that sense, or better off being slaves to the United States government, in the sense of the subsidies. I’m wondering. That’s what. And the statement was right. I am wondering.”\n\nthe man is not a professional speaker- just a rancher so he could have worded it a bit better but the message is perfectly clear if you look past the media's desperate attempt to twist and smear this man. \n\nwhat he is saying is that Black people have essentially traded one form of slavery for another.  All of those subsidies come with all kinds of catch 22's that completely destroy the Black family- just ask anyone who ever lived in Pruit/Igoe. one of the big rules of that government public housing was that any able bodied man could not live with his family if they were living there. the government literally ripped families apart so that they could be eligible for those benefit. you rip a family apart and you will have a never ending cycle of broken homes, single mothers, children without both parents in the home. Black people are still to this day feeling the effects of all that government \"help\" even today that same rule still exists- you want help with public housing assistance- even if you are married the father can not live there. you want help? the government requires you to destroy your family first. what the hell do you think this is going to do to the children? the #1 cause of the problems in the Black community today is not having both parents in the home. \n\nThey are no better off today than they were back then. they are still slaves. instead of being slaves to the whip they are slaves to the government handout- it keeps them down just as effectively and has been doing so for multiple generations.\n\nyou need to learn a skill called critical thinking- don't just run around regurgitating what you heard or read in the news. that's exactly what they want you to do. \n\nhere is a comment from a Black person posted to another article about this same story:\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathanDunbar  • 3 hours ago  \n\n\n\n\n\nThey are trying to LYNCH Bundy in the mess media!\n\nI am black, and I agree 100% with Mr. Bundy said!\n\nThe modern day black, or n e g r o is in fact a slave to socialism and all the trappings there of!\n\nBlacks today are in positions of USELESSNESS unless its election time and the left needs robotic voters; my people are embarrassing most of the time!\n\nWe don't THINK for ourselves, we don't DO for ourselves!

The British went batshit mad for Yew wood and made it extinct in the British Isles so I feel like this bonus fits them perfectly.\n\n&gt;Siege Weapons attack 10/20% faster starting in Feudal Age\n\n* Another Celt bonus. This fits the Brits better due to their propensity for Siege in real life. This is very strong for anti-personnel Siege weapons, which the Britons are very into.\n\n&gt;Towers +1 Range\n\n* The Britons built tons and tons of Castles and they should have some sort of bonus to reflect that. Since I took away the Britons' Archer bonuses, I want them to feel like a ranged civ in other ways.\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: \n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Longbowman: \n\n* The Longbowman is kind of halfway between an Archer and a Siege weapon. He doesn't possess the same range as he did in AoE2 but he's still longer ranged than regular Archers, possesses more attack power, and stronger defenses. In return, the Longbow moves slower and doesn't enjoy fighting Cavalry. In real life history, the Longbow was more of an artillery piece than a bow, so I really like the idea of the Longbow being an almost-Siege weapon.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Yeomen: All Ranged units +1 range\n\n* I want the Unique Techs to be kind of crazy and things that the player MUST research. This affects foot Archers, Skirmishers, Arbalisters (Britons miss Handgunner, though), Towers, Castles, Siege, and ships ALL during the 2nd Age of the game! Paired with the Tower bonus, Briton towers are very long-ranged earlier on in the game than the Korean towers in AoE2. As far as Siege goes, the Britons lack Siege Engineers (or whatever I'm going to call the +1 Range, +20% building damage tech) so this balances them out. What it means is that the Britons have deadly Siege in the Feudal Age and pretty great Siege in the Imperial Age but not super powerful. This also affects Pikemen, making them equals to Frankish Pikemen.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: War of the Roses\n\n* I haven't come up with a decent Unique Tech for the Britons here. I was thinking of giving them the Japanese UT Kataparuto, Trebuchets pack, unpack, and fire +33% faster. Combined with the +20% faster attack would make them beastly.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry: full\n\n* The Brits made full use of Pikes and Halbs. The Scots of course came up with Shelltrons formations for their Pikemen, and Great Swordsmen could wield Claymores.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Elephants, Composite Bowman, Handgunner, Atlatl\n\n* Nobody on the British Isles had access to the Composite Bow so they don't get it. This makes the Britons more reliant on their Castles (which makes sense in real life), and puts more emphasis on their Siege. They get Arbalisters with extra range, which makes sense because Richard the Lionhearted fucking loved crossbowmen. Maybe they should get Handgunner for historical accuracy but I've taken it away from them to make them more Cavalry weak in Imperial. No Elephants or Atlatls are no-brainers.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: no Camel, Cavalier\n\n* No Camel of course. The lack of the final Knight upgrade keeps the Britons from being too strong, though I was thinking of giving it to them because the Celts had it (and also taking away other cavalry technologies to make it a weak unit). Light Cavalry is available due to the Hobelars, an Irish light cavalry unit that was used by the Scots and hired by the English.\n\n&gt;Siege: no Capped Ram, Bombard, Siege Engineers\n\n* The Britons miss two key anti-building Siege Weapons, and they miss Siege Engineers, which is okay because they get 20% faster attacking Siege weapons (good for BOTH vs buildings or vs anti-personnel), and their Unique Tech gives them +1 Range. The British' penchant is with anti-personnel weapons like the Cannon, Siege Tower, and Onager.

{"body": "So the first things I'm going to recommend, are dropping the current paper you're using, and switching to a different pen.\n\nThat looks like the Parallel 1.5mm (?), which has a pretty poor hairline/downstroke ratio. It helps to use a slightly larger nib to learn so you can see your mistakes. I'd suggest the 2.4, but more likely the 3.8. You can better study the form and structure of the letters. That's if you want to use Pilot Parallel Pens though. There's a lot of other ones out there. I wrote [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1s4l1j/what_kind_of_pen_do_you_use/cdtuwao?context=3) a while back that has my opinion on pens. \n\nThe paper has slanted guidelines, which is exactly what you do not want when you're practicing a Blackletter hand (because it is written vertically). Also, you seem to be getting a pretty fair amount of feathering. I'd personally suggest the Strathmore Drawing paper, though I'd really suggest you try out 10-15 different kinds yourself. See what works best for you. Some people like a more textured surface, some like something much more smooth. \n\nIn regards to the letterforms themselves, you seem to have a pretty good start actually. Far better than how I was on my second day. I have a [three part Quadrata \"guide\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1ojd8n/by_request_of_ufishtacular_but_for_everyones/) you may want to check out. It has most of what I've written about it, and may help you out. The best advice that I can give you is to study historical texts, and try to reproduce the letterforms as accurately as you can. Always use the highest quality exemplar texts. Never settle for \"okay\". \n\nFinally, drill the fundamentals. It may not seem fun or interesting.

{"body": "Ok here are my night messages tonight, i hope I forgot nothing.. this is such a lot of work.\n\n---\n\n\nHe may be a smooth talker who has contributed a lot of noise and zero wolf lynch, but don't lynch gryffinp.\n\n-redpoemage\n\n\n---\n\nGood morning. Constable here. Today's validation: jvFxK13. Yesterday I checked out rcxdude. The result I got was **Harmful**, but the night message left me with an uncomfortable feeling. It said I went to the Watch station to pull his file because I remembered seeing something of concern in there, but his file wasn't where I thought it would be. I had to spend the night picking shelf after shelf before I found it behind a crate of bloody body parts with the words \"forensics (NOT snacks)\" written on it. Of course, this is likely just flavor, and I'm reading too much into this. My result, as it stands, is that rcxdude is Harmful. But consider taking it with a grain of salt, and give rcxdude a chance to defend himself. I don't know what's going on here.\n\n\n---\n\nDear wolves,\n\nWe are not interested in working with you. Especially not if you are going to be so indiscrete as to post your plans up on this board for all to decypher. -SvM\n\n---\n\nConstable again, imgur link http://i.imgur.com/nYAtb8I.png. This is a separate message to prove that the same person can post several times. This night I will target Meno_Self, but I believe the wolves may have broken my verification system so don't believe anything that appears to be from me tomorrow if it gives a result on any one other than Meno.\n\n---\n\nI'm the actual Oracle, and I can't prove it because there is so much BS on the board. Screw this broken system. Just don't believe anything from any other claimed Oracle. At all. Ok? We can still win this if you all completely ignore the board from now on.\n\n---\n\nI'm the RMBW, and this is going to be a little wordy. Bear with me. I'm fuming here and it's hard to put my thoughts in order.\n\nOn night 1, red came up with that terrible plan. My role message was clear that I would be informed of the wolf kill, but said nothing more. So the plan clearly wouldn't work if there was a strongarm in the game, and Jib refused to answer my questions about whether there was one. But during that discussion he stated again that the only thing he could tell me is that I would only know about the regular kill. I took the word \"regular\" to mean that there was a non-regular one, and that the plan fucked. So the best move was absolutely to stand back and say nothing in public so the town would have at least one protection role left, while explaining my decision on the board.\n\nAnd then Uncomprehensible steps forward and goes \"lol I'm the witch honest\". And the plan goes forward. And we lose BOTH the doc and the jailer on night 1. I used the life potion on the real target, Plarzay. And then the SK targeted him too... My potion blocks the wolf kill, not the serial killer. Ask Jib, he'll confirm this. Go ahead, ask him. Also go ahead and blame me for not anticipating that the SK would nail Plarzay in order to score two kills. Because I should have, and not doing it is my failure. We can discuss this more after the game when we debrief.\n\nBut THEN you guys bought Uncomprehensible's lies hook, line and sinker. I'm angry at you, but also at myself. The role message says, exactly, \"You can use either potion on any given night\" which I took to mean, only one potion on a given night. Yes, I know we're not allowed to quote role messages verbatim, but quite frankly, screw you. Either way, I fucked up that part, Uncomprehensible latched onto that while I could only slap myself repeatedly and vow to feed him my death potion *especially* slowly.\n\nNight 2: GUESS WHAT I FUCKING DID. No, really, guess. So I visited Uncomprehensible. Remember how cocky he was on day 2? Daring me to use my potion? Right. He wasn't home, and there was no trace of him anywhere. My night result states that I waited for him all night, and when he didn't turn up, I tried to brace my potion atop his door frame so it would spill on him when he walks in. Because of course it makes complete sense to waste my potion like this... Still, I assume that Uncomprehensible is a role that can hide at night. Having that role fake-claim Witch was a stroke of brilliance and completely fucked us up. Or the wolves have a jailer of their own. I think that's less likely, because they would have used it on night 1.\n\nThen it's day 3 and guess what happens? Uncomprehensible goes full inactive, doesn't vote on our first good wolf lead, and only shows up later saying \"was busy, lol.\" Nothing in my role message says my potions are stronger than hider roles, but I find the coincidence interesting. I eagerly await the next death reveals.\n\nSo that's my story. And now I have many questions for you, Town, and I BEG you to try and answer them.\n\nIf I'm not the real Witch, then WHY am I wasting my time writing all this instead of just fucking playing Dark Souls 2?\n\nWHY would the wolves post something to \"confirm\" Uncomprehensible as the Witch last night? What do they stand to gain from that if Uncomprehensible is real?\n\nWHY have they not targeted him straight away? If he was the real Witch, they would absolutely want to make him spend both his potions while we have few suspects to FOS.\n\nHell, if I'm a wolf as you claim, WHY would I still post on the board after the wolves said I was a fake?\n\nAnd most importantly:\n\nWHY, WHY, WHY WOULD UNCOMPREHENSIBLE FAIL TO ASK JIB IF HE WOULD BE TOLD OF THE STRONGARM KILL. That was a CRUCIAL part of the plan. There is NO reason why the real Witch would not ask the mod about that RIGHT AWAY. NO. REASON.\n\nAnswer me this, Un. Go ahead. I'm waiting.\n\nI should probably just go and claim publicly. I'm just so tired of this shit. But the last thing I want is getting fucking lynched by the town and have Uncomprehensible gloat smugly, confident in the knowledge that my role won't be revealed for days because of the bullshit death thing. I'm not even hoping we can win anymore. At this point I just want to make this game infuriate me less. But I do reserve my right to be all I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO in your faces when the game is over, because, for *serious*, guys.\n\nSo please, *please* try to give a honest answer to the questions I raised, and then apply Occam's Razor.\n\nOne last thing: I see Uncomprehensible offered to use his, quote, life potion, unquote, to save redpoemage. Redpoe is indeed tonight's target. So I bet Uncomprehensible will sorrowfully tell us he decided to keep his potion. Or he'll lie about using it, and if he does, WE CAN NAIL HIM.\n\nIf redpoemage is alive tomorrow, ASK JIB IF HE WOULD LET THE WOLVES FAKE A KILL IN ORDER TO MISLEAD THE TOWN. Because that's the only way red can be alive tomorrow. And we can now prove it.\n\n---\n\nI'm the Oracle. The last letters of the first words in my role message are \"r e s a y g d u e e e\". On night 2 I targeted /u/Meno_Self. Check this out: they're the **Vampire Recruiter.** Therefore, fuck this game comprehensively. What were you even *thinking,* Jib.\n\n\n---\n\nDear Rincewind,\n\nNice to meet you! You want to survive. So do we! Let's strike a deal. You will now refrain from voting, unless asked to by one of us. In exchange, to ensure your survival, we vow to kill the first person to vote for you. Don't fail us! That would make us sad, and grumpy, and unpleasant. Thank you for mentioning your protection item, speaking of. We now know to account for it. But there will of course be no need for that. We're great fans of yours and dearly wish to see you live.\n\nLove and nibbles,\n\n - Clan von Uberwald\n\n---\n\nThe stars spoke to me last night! I saw that /u/redpoemage is the Cult Leader.

{"body": "I apologize if this is a bit confusing, but please feel free to ask for any clarifications.\n\nYour question essentially asks how to figure out which notes/chords are in the same key, aka fit well together. You can have chords/notes that are technically out of a specific key but still work because they create a particular effect or whatever but you obviously don't need to get tangled up in that yet. You'll figure that out as you go and by learning songs. Here are the basic ideas to get you started.\n\nKeys can be major or minor, and to each key corresponds a scale with the same name. Songs in A minor will be written with notes from the A minor scale, chords in the key of A minor are constructed with the notes in the key of A minor, and so on. To build a scale, start from a note (called the root note, this is the note that names the scale, e.g. A minor starts on A, G major starts on G, so on) and follow these patterns to build either a major or minor scale. \n\nYour basic major scale goes like this (R = root note, W = whole step [2 frets], H = half step [1 fret]):\n\n    R W W H W W W H\nSo if you start on C, to get the C major scale you go one whole step higher to D, then one more whole step up to E, a half-step up to F, one more whole step to G, one more whole step to A, one more whole step to B, and from B you go up a half-step to a C that will be an octave higher than the one you started on. C D E F G A B C.\n\nTo get the minor scale, follow this pattern:\n\n    R W H W W H W W\n\nStarting again on C, that will be: C -&gt; 2 frets up to D -&gt; 1 up to Eb (or D# if it helps you understand) -&gt; 2 up to F -&gt; 2 up to G -&gt; 1 up to Ab -&gt; one more whole step up to C. C D Eb F G Ab Bb C\n\nYou'll notice that he minor scale is just like the major scale except the 3rd, 6th and 7th notes are flattened, or taken down a half step. So in C minor E becomes Eb, A becomes Ab and B becomes Bb.\n\nNow that you know the scale that corresponds to the key you're in, you can use it to figure out which chords are in that key. I'm gonna write out the notes of a scale numbering them with roman numerals (so C would be I because it's the first note of the scale, F would be IV because it's the fourth, etc.) If the numeral corresponding to a note is lowercase, then the chord corresponding to that note is *minor*. If it's in uppercase, it is major. Here's what I mean, starting out with the major scale:\n\n    I ii iii IV V vi vii*\n\n    Major - minor - minor - Major - Major - minor - diminished \n\n\nThe chords I, IV and V (in our key of C major these are C, F and G) are major; ii, iii and vi (D, E and A) are minor. vii has an asterisk near it because it's neither minor nor major, it is diminished, but don't worry about that just yet, you won't encounter this much in pop/rock songwriting, it's more of a jazz thing. So the key of C major has the chords C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am and Bdim inside of it.\n\nNow for minor keys, the pattern is:\n\n    i ii* III iv v VI VII\n\n    minor - diminished - Major - minor - minor - Major - Major\n\n\nIn a minor key it is the second chord to be diminished. The III, VI and VII chords are major and i, iv and v are minor. So for C minor, the chords you'll find in it are: Cm, Ddim, Eb, Fm, Gm, Ab, Bb.\n\nYou can use these rules to figure out the chords/notes in any key. One thing that helped me memorize them was practicing them in my head or on paper, starting from a note and following the whole step/half step patterns to build the scales. Hope this helps, again, feel free to ask for clarifications, I don't know how good I am at explaining things :p\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398454987", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I consider this highly doubtful.\n\n&gt;I'm the RMBW, and this is going to be a little wordy. Bear with me. I'm fuming here and it's hard to put my thoughts in order.\n\nLong post.\n\nHonestly I find the scenario proposed here quite possible, except for one thing: This mystery person's continued insistence on refusing to step forward publicly. The logic I proposed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PloungeMafia/comments/22j9ie/undamnedwerewolves_day_two/cgngx9h) is still as valid as ever, and even more so if you truly have expended both of your available potions:\n\n&gt;And at that point, once you have expended your killing potion and your saving potion, you are **useless**. You will have no power to act over the game, and are no better then a vanilla townie. You will be informed each night who the werewolves intend to kill, but it will be impossible for you do anything at all about it. You will be powerless.    \n&gt;Unless, that is, you claim. Claim *now*, and step into the role that Uncomprehensible usurped. Use what remaining power you have to the fullest benefit of the town. Your survival is meaningless if it only means that your predictions are of no use to anyone. Share them publicly, and let us work with them.\n\nI reiterate. If you are the real witch, and you have used your potions, then you gain nothing by continuing to hide your identity, as you have nothing but the ability to gain information you cannot use. Step forward, and end this farce.\n\nMoving on:\n\n&gt;Recognition code 5i7TWGs, I am a potato.\n\nInserting that code into an imgur link gives us this: http://imgur.com/5i7TWGs In it, it appears that someone has copied the \"constable's\" technique, in order to signal to the original constable that they have understood the system they derived.

Lie low, try to suss out some wolves, and then step forward when you think you have enough names to make a difference. Personally, I believe that useful information can be extracted.\n\n&gt;Dear wolves,\nWe are not interested in working with you.

{"body": "Hey guys! I have a [smurf solely focused on Lucian](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/45349274) so I'd like to give some tips as well if anyone is interested.\n\nAs for his AA Q AA advice, this is very handy and your typical and optimal Lucian combo for quick trades. Early game it will feel a bit more clunky like someone else here mentioned as your attack speed will have a cooldown of over a second and Piercing Light has a cast time of 0.35s, meaning your passive AA may not be up immediately after your Q is done casting but you are getting an extra AA in and utilizing your AA cooldown efficiently. This can be used for all his abilities as they all have cast time of sorts, so AAing before using an ability is more efficient than just straight up using an ability. This philosophy can be used for all champions though...\n\nAs for W into E, this is something I only discovered recently screwing around in customs and is very important when you think about it. W has a casting animation, meaning after you use W you can't move until the animation is complete, locking up your character and being forced to stand still. What Doublelift is saying is that if you use E milliseconds after W, you are cancelling the animation and actually MOVING and doing SOMETHING after casting W rather than just standing still. It is true that you will lose the passive, so in trades where you aren't chasing, you don't necessarily need to cancel W's animation. Let's assume you are chasing though or you know you don't need the extra passive proc to kill your enemy, it is better to cancel W's animation with E so that you can output your damage faster, as well as keeping up with your fleeing opponent. Remember, Lucian's passive is strong but when you W -&gt; E, you are losing ONE extra AA that does 50% damage. You can even cast W and use Q immediately after to cancel the W animation as well.\n\nAnother thing to note when casting W -&gt; E is that the W projectile will originate from E's FINAL DESTINATION. This is like the multiple abilities with cast times where you flash immediately afterwards, the ability will originate from where you ended up, not from where you initially casted it. This is incredibly useful for when you are chasing because you can now eliminate the W's \"stand around while your enemy escapes\" animation and you are gaining distance on the ability by the distance you dashed with E.\n\nOther tips I can give are rather well known, casting W before R will give you the consistent bonus movement speed assuming your are hitting the targets marked with Ardent Blaze with The Culling.\n\nDon't be afraid to use The Culling on your lane opponent when no minions are around, it has a rather low cooldown and can chunk super hard if you aim it well, potentially winning lane by forcing him to back or having the possibility to zone him.\n\nAs for typical build paths, Bloodthirster rush is optimal because of his good AD scaling, and then you can go TF for a great mid game spike (recommended) or you can go LW if you think you'll be grouping as 5 earlier and teamfighting against armour stacking enemies. Either way, your core 3 items are BT TF LW, and your 4th can be a defensive item, situational based on your opponent's composition, or it can be BoRK if you need the extra survival and self peel in team fights, or it can be IE if you need more damage in general. TF can be replaced with PD if you are the only carry on your team as you need the increased damage output from PD's crit chance and attack speed to make up for your team's lack of damage. Eventually boots can be replaced with Zephyr if the game gets that late.\n\nYour skill order should be Q -&gt; E -&gt; Q -&gt; W, sometimes it's useful to level up W third or even second in some matchups, but I almost always go Q E Q W. An example of an early W level up would be against Vayne, where you W her and follow up with passive, forcing her to tumble if she wants to trade evenly. Then you can follow up with an easy Q to win the trade once again, if you had Q'd first to trade she could have tumbled the Q and won the trade in her favour.\n\nAlways max Q, no question there, take Culling whenever possible. This is where I get controversial... between E or W second max. Personally, and I suggest you try it before you write it off, I max E second. All pros as far as I know max W second, and my opinion on this is that it's because in today's meta, it is better for sieging and poking, but in soloq I think E max is so much better.\n\nLet's look at the major differences, W scales from 14s cd to 10s cd, and it gains 40 damage per level while keeping the same utility (40 movement speed bonus) the same mana cost (60), and the same AD scaling (60%).\n\nIf you look at E, the CD scales from 18s to 10s and the mana scales from 60 to 0.\n\nThe fact that you have E twice as fast at level 13 in an E second max build is ridiculously strong in soloq, where you may misposition more often or where you need to chase kills more often, and being able to rely on your E without any worries about mana costs really makes it a better choice than the super minimal damage you get from W. The fact that W scales with AD but the scaling doesn't scale means you can build damage and W will still do lots of damage if you don't max it.\n\nYour typical trade combos should be AA Q P W P (E if not needed for safety) P Q P R. This combo can 100-0 AD carries in the mid game, don't underestimate The Culling's damage. This combo is also efficient against Baron. Some people think The Culling does less damage to Baron than your typical ability rotation, and this is true assuming your abilities are off cooldown. If you go through the ability rotation mentioned above, you will have 4-4.5s until your Q and W are up again, so using the Culling, which lasts 3 seconds, will out damage regular auto attacks. The Culling will only do 100% damage to Baron though, some people think it does 400% but that increase is only against lane minions, not jungle monsters.\n\nIf you have any other questions or comments, don't be afraid to ask! I'll answer as best as I can.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to talk about runes and masteries! I honestly haven't looked in depth into the new runes and masteries, so I will probably analyze whatever the pros are using and run from there. I'm still using armour runes and 3 lifesteal quints as I focus a lot on the laning phase and snowballing it in soloq, and the early armour helps a lot and scales better into late game than flat health, and the flat lifesteal quints really do help with sustain on top of the Feast mastery. Other options are flat health or scaling health seals, and you can run a combination of 2 armour quints with an attack damage quint or 2 AS quints with an attack damage quint. I don't really like the AS quints on Lucian but they could be useful in some situations. In my opinion 9 AD marks are the best and 4 mana/5 and 5 flat MR glyphs are the best for their respective categories.\n\nAs for masteries I just go a [typical 21-9-0 (page 1)](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/45349274#masteries) on ADCs with a heavy focus on abilities. Please don't put more than one point into Warlord, the 3% extra AD you get from BONUS AD is very minimal and not worth the 2 points it costs. Late game, this will only be around 6-9 AD. I think 1 point is worth the 2% though, as there aren't many other efficient options that will help you get to the bottom of the tree.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398463838", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 53, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "--------= = = = T U R K S = = = =--------\n\nThe Turks are all archers, all the time but still have a strong gunpowder and cavalry aspect. In real life, the Turks ethnic weapon was the composite bow. They LOOOOVED the Composite Bow, and even though AoE2 depicts them as being gunpowder experts, the Turks were using the Composite Bow well into the late 1500s. In fact, the Battle of Lepanto in real life featured Turkish naval troops firing Composite Bows in showers and the European powers were scared to death of this weapon there, and that battle took place in 1570! I'm going for a more representative Turkish civilization, as they were more than just the Ottomans.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**BONUSES AND UNIQUES**\n\n&gt;Hunters work +50% faster\n\n* This seems really weird at first, but this bonus is very historically accurate and works well for the Turks as they were a pastorial Steppe people. This helps them get light cavalry out of the gates early on.\n\n&gt;Fut the wuck\n\n* I haven't really come up with any other bonuses for the Turks. My dilemna here is that the Turks would have access to almost every archery technology (whereas the Japanese would lack armor or attack speed techs or something), AND they'd have access to a super Handgunner unit. So instead of giving them direct military bonuses, they should maybe get bonuses in other ways?\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: \n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Jannisary: Super Handgunner\n\n* The Jannisary is going to remain the same, although I wish I could have come up with a way to depict them as using multiple weapon types somehow. Anyway, Handgunners are very powerful in this game as a ranged counter to cavalry, which makes the Jannisary quite strong (although they would lose the anti-Cavalry aspect just like how Jannisaries lose the anti-Infantry bonus in AoE2).\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Jereed:\n\n* Jureed is a game that is played on horseback where the participants throw javelins at targets. It was an extremely important and ceremonial game that built martial skill for the Turks, and it was also used as a wargame by the Ottomans. Sports have always been a huge part of human society and I was thinking about how little representation there is for that so maybe Jereed is the answer. I was thinking of giving them a technology that would make their Skirmishers on par with Meso Skirmishers, and thus this is what I came up with. Of course, it would be available in the Feudal Age, whereas the Atlatl Skirmisher is available in the Imperial Age. This may make the Turks too strong.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Gunpowder Empire: Bombard Cannons +4 Range\n\n* I wanted to simulate the Great Bombards that the Turks used to destroy the Walls of Constantinople. +4 Range *might* be a bit much, though.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry:  no Pikeman, Great Swordsman\n\n* The Turks used these weapons in real life so maybe they should keep the units and in exchange lose the beneficial technologies?\n\n&gt;Archery: no Atlatl\n\n* The Turks would have access to fully upgradeable Cavalry Archers, Composite Bowmen, Handgunners, Elephant Archers (but they won't be able to afford them most of the time), as well as Jannisaries and possibly even an Atlatl Skirmisher equivalent.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: no Cavalier\n\n* The Turks used Heavy Cavalry to great effect, and their Sipahi were probably the best heavy cavalry at their time. It's actually inaccurate to NOT include the full heavy cavalry line (both in AoE2 and here) but they may be too strong with their Archer strength. The Turks still get fully upgradeable Light Cavalry and Camels.\n\n&gt;Siege: no Capped Ram, Mangonel Siege Tower, Siege Engineers\n\n* The Turks lack alot of Siege weapons. In AoE2, they are one of two civs to lack an upgrade for their Onager line, and so it is here so that they can have something resembling an Archery weakness. They make up for this with overpowered Bombards. I guess. One thing that makes the Turks less powerful in Archery that other civs have is the Siege Tower.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398467081", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "all melodies come down to rhythm. if the rhythm is interesting, then you're off to a good start. use some simple recording device to record rhythms that sound cool to you, then reference back to them when you're in your studio. enter the rhythms into a midi clip (Ableton-sprecht), throw a Scale effect before a synth, and use a preset like C Major, or Natural Minor. \n\nOnce you have a rhythm and you have a scale to work with, then it's up to your inner voice. the best melodies are the ones that are singable, and for good reason, too. if you can't sing your melody, then chances are it's not memorable or it's too difficult to become so. the keys to a good melody are repetition and step-wise motion (C D E F G F E, etc.). Come up with a short phrase or musical thought, then move the phrase up to the next step up or down, e.g., G G F E D, A A G F E, B B A G F. On the third time, change it slightly. \n\nI also teach my piano students to use numbers for notes in a scale and to build patterns out of them. If you're in the key of C, then C is 1. With that in mind, the notes that make pop or mainstream melodies usually use these tones, which I call \"pop tones\": 1 2 3 5 7. Play them in short, rhythmic patterns that repeat.

One of our Paramedics, Kris Stark was involved in a fatal motorcycle accident on Sunday morning. While we may know the face of death all too well, it definitely strikes a different cord when it’s one of our own. \n\nDuring these most difficult times it is important to support each other. I have arranged for a grievance professional to be onsite from 9-5 on Monday, April 28th. In addition to the onsite counselor please note that EAP services are available 24 hours 7 days a week. Whether you need to speak with a grief counselor urgently or would like to make an appointment to meet with a professional, please call 1-800-646-9923 or 1-800-967-9276.\n\nThank you all for being the support system we need while coping and making strides to move forward after this unfortunate tragedy. \n\nIf you would like to make a donation or send your written condolences to the Stark family please see any Supervisor or Nykia in Human Resources. \n\nSincerely,\n\nNykia Moore", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398693344", "subreddit": "ems", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "They are not classified as \"paleo things.\" I really recommend you do your own research and decide what is going to help your performance individually versus listening to what other sheep have to say because they are d e a d wrong that paleo will improve your performance. Sure, if you have a bad diet now then you will notice changes and improvements, but on a long term scale paleo will not be the most optimal diet for an increase of strength or endurance. You can not listen to all the crossfit bandwagoning hype because unfortunately a lot of it is \"bro science.\" CARBS will improve your WODS and strict paleo is LOW carb.  \n\nPaleo is a template to use on a path to eliminating processed and chemically altered foods. It is a template to use to figure out what foods work best for YOU, not OTHERS. The Paleo community also prides itself on being open and accepting that if dairy doesn't bother you then they don't care that you have it, etc. It makes very little sense, when looking at only strength and endurance, to eliminate products that have no negative effects towards your bodily performance. My personal belief towards paleo is that it is a BEGINNERS guide to rehab with food, it's there to break bad habits and set you in a new direction while allowing you to experiment what works and doesn't work, paleo as it is written is NOT the final stop for \"paleo\" and it is definitely NOT prime nutrition for crossfit training.\n\nEdit: your goal is to get better at WODS, but each WOD is specifically designed for something different each day. Do you even know how to break down a WOD to see what it's meant for? That shows your goals are not well defined and are a bit all over the place.

You can also send raid starships up to 8 hops out and blow up a command station; this is dangerous but costs less AIP.\n\n* to create a buffer around really critical planets (homeworlds, advanced factories). \n\n2) If you don't want to take a planet but it's adjacent to your territory, usually you want to leave the command center and the wormhole guard posts, but take out all the other guard posts (aka 'neuter' the system).  \n\n* You can do this to as many systems as you want, since guard posts don't raise AIP on death.  \n\n* You can also clear the wormhole guard posts if you have a LOT of firepower, but it's only worth it very late game or using golems because they have so much health.  \n\n* Killing guard posts reduces the number of reinforcements that the AI gets at that planet.  \n\n3) If you have a series of planets A B C D in a line, and you have enough Core Turrets, you can take and hold A and D, then build a bunch of core turrets on B and C.  The AI reinforcements will usually suicide into the turrets.  Only useful if you have the Vengeance of the Machine expac, and this probably only works on lower difficulties.  Transports + Cloaker starships can sneak around together (use group move) if there's no tachyon, or use Assault Transports (power them down so they don't uncloak); that's probably a much better option.  \n\n4) Use warp gates or unlock Mobile Space Docks to get reinforcements to the front faster.  Load all the slow ships into Transports to get your army around faster.  For planets that you've captured that you transit through a lot, you can build Logistics command stations if they're in pretty safe positions, those boost the speed of all ships in the system.  Teleporting ships can also get around at ludicrous speed if you happen to have any unlocked.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398725895", "subreddit": "AIwar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Your best option would be to buy heavier gauge strings, try Ernie ball not even slinky or something similar in gauge size, and tune down either to drop A which is A E A D G B (theres no high E anymore because you only have six strings!) or B standard, which is what I showed earlier, but without the High E obviously.

{"body": "I think the key is to get an idea of what \"music theory\" is and to get a sense of how learning \"music theory\" can help you. Providing a chord progression for a melodic line, or harmonizing the melody, is an *artistic* process. This means that while an understanding of theory can help you, ultimately the chord progression should be determined by your ear and whether you believe it sounds good or not. This is because it is hard to pin down what exactly you want in a chord progression. Music theory can help you find a chord progression where each note of the melody fits each chord under it. However, this will sound boring as there is no harmonic tension or release. On the other hand, we can also contrive to find a chord progression that clashes on each note with the melody. This would sound rather horrible. There is also the issue of how many chords you want in your progression, and when to change chords, etc. Music theory cannot help you find the answers to all these problems; messing around on a piano and listening with your ear is the best way to find a good chord progression.\n\nThat said, I do think that some topics in music theory *can* be helpful thing for an electronic music producer to know:\n\n1. *Keys and modes*--becoming familiar with your basic major and minor keys, as well as the church modes (Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, etc) can help categorize progressions and figure out what exactly the \"feel\" of a progression is.\n\n2. *Basic intervals and chords*--major and minor, along with their extensions (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths). Learn what intervals make these chords. Don't spend too much time with diminished or augmented chords--these are extremely rare in modern popular music and I have yet to hear one in any EDM song.\n\n3. *Roman Numeral Notation*. Being able to write down chord progressions that are *relative* to the key (numbers I ii iii IV V vi etc) instead of writing them in *absolute* notes (C D E F G A etc) allows you to think about your harmonic progressions in relative, abstract terms, which is helpful when trying to figure out why two songs sound the same or when trying to come up with progressions with different \"feels.\"\n\nI really do not think there is that much content relevant to electronic music in typical music theory courses apart from the topics I listed above. A lot of music theory is tailored to analyzing Western European music written from about 1600 to 1900. This means that a lot of details, such as SATB voiceleading rules and chord progression rules are not very relevant when dealing with electronic music. Secondary dominants may be useful in analyzing John Mayer songs or other more jazzy genres, but are not helpful in understanding things like EDM, where they see very little use. Learning to read sheet music is tremendously helpful when deciphering complex harmonic progressions, but is less helpful when dealing with guitar strumming patterns or synth sound-changes, which are better visualized through the various tools of a DAW (though I do concede that most widely avaialble music theory courses are conducted through sheet music).\n\n\"Music theory\" is also very harmony-biased and many typical music theory courses have very little content relating to rhythm (they tend to only deal with time signatures and how to notate rhythm on sheet paper). There is no discussion in these courses, for example, of rhythmic patterns (difference between latin claves or a four on the floor house beat for example).\n\n*tl;dr*\n\n1. Music theory can't help you find a better chord progression than your gut can\n\n2. Get familiar with \"keys and modes,\" \"intervals and chords,\" and \"roman numeral notation\"\n\n3.

{"body": "John slowly massaged his temple. The constant stabbing headache had receded to a dull thud every few minutes. He looked at the wall clock to his right, just ten more minutes\nuntil his shift ended. Two more calls, maybe three if a sales side call came over by mistake. He no longer cared about the cross-sell/up-sell targets. Never did during that last hour. The last hour of a shift was like the last kilometre of a marathon. You want to give up, it'll be so easy to do so, but you can’t. You beg your body for a little more, just take one more call, hopefully it'll be a quick one. His mind would zone out and he’d only hear key words like policy renewal or sum-insured. Not that it mattered, the customers didn’t care if you weren’t really listening, they just wanted whatever they wanted done and hang up. Sometimes John would look around the call centre and he’d feel like a prostitute in a brothel. At least in a brothel the customers come because they want to. Nobody calls an insurance company unless they have to. The worst part though was the loneliness. Only in a call centre can a person be in constant contact with so many people yet feel so utterly alone.  \nJohn took a deep breath and pressed the bright red answer button. \n\n\"Welcome to NRMA Insurance, my name is John, how can I help you?\" \n\n\"For now I'm ok I suppose, physically at least.\"\n\n\"That’s fantastic.

I live at 773 Ocean St, Penshurst.”\n\n“No worries  Mr Hutz, I’ll just bring up your policy right now.”\n\nSilence, or dead air time as the managers called it, lingered as they both waited. \nJohn could hear the customer’s heavy breathing. He’d normally try and make small talk whilst the system loaded up their files but he didn’t even have the energy to throw an insincere ‘how was your day’. \n\n“Hmm… I can’t seem to find your policy, is it H U T Z and Troy is spelled T R O Y?”\n\n“Like I said, I don’t have a policy. At least you spelled my name right, thanks for that”\n\n“Oh so you don’t actually have a policy with us?”\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Oh that’s fine. Thank you for calling NRMA Insurance, you have a nice night Mr Hutz”\n“Please don’t hang up”\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“I just need to talk to you. Or anybody…..somebody.” \n\n“Um…”\n\n“What’s your last name John?”\n\n“Err… We’re not suppose to give out our last name, it’s company policy for security reasons incase irate customer threaten us.” \n\n“Oh that’s a shame. People are too angry these days.”\n\n“Yeah they are…. Listen Mr Hutz I’m gonna have to-” \n\n“I’m dying John.”\n\nJohn froze. Did he hear that right, did that guy just say he was dying? \n\n“Did you hear me John, I said I’m dying”\n\n“Wh…What do you mean you’re dying”\n\n“I can feel my life force leaving me.”\n\n“Your life force?”\n\n“Yeah. The will to live. You ever feel like that John?” \n\nJohn stood up and looked around the office wondering if this is some kind of elaborate joke. Didn’t seem like it. Nobody was looking in his direction, everyone around still had the same zombified look on their faces whilst staring at the monitor in front of them. John looked at the wall clock. Fuck, it was ten minutes past the end of his shift. \n\n“Er… yeah sometimes. Listen Mr Hutz I really hav-”\n\n“I’ve been feeling like this for a long time now.” \n\n“I’m sorry to hear that Mr Hutz…”\n\n“Me too. I really shouldn’t be feeling this way. I have all the things that a successful man is suppose to have. Yet I feel…. empty, like an aquarium that has had its water drained.”\n\n“You feel empty…?”\n\n“Do you like the poems of Robert Frost, John?”\n\n“I…er… in highschool we did some English stuff on his poems. But I don’t really remember much about it.”\n\n“Do you mind if I read one of his poems to you?”\n\n“Mr Hutz, I really have to –” \n\n“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost. \nWhose woods these are I think I know, \nHis house is in the village though, \nHe will not see me stopping here,\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow. \n\nMy little horse must think it queer,\nTo stop without a farmhouse near,\nBetween the woods and frozen lake,\nThe darkest evening of the year.\n\nHe gives his harness bells a shake,\nTo ask if there is some mistake,\nThe only other sound’s the sweep,\nOf easy wind and downy flake. \n\nThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,\nBut I have promises to keep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep, \nAnd miles to go before I sleep. \n\n Beautiful isn’t it John? I wanted to read it one last time, but I didn’t know who else to call. Thank you for sharing some of your time with me”\n\nJohn felt his heart beat quicken. Something didn’t feel right. He’d heard of this one before but he couldn’t quite remember what it was about.\n\n“Mr Hutz are you ok?”\n\n“And miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep”\n\n“Hey man listen whatever you’re thinking of-”\n\n“I’m glad I had a chance to speak to someone like you.

{"body": "Start slow and simple.\n\n* Make sure your seat height is correct.  Most people sit too low at the piano.  Look for your forearms to be level or sloping slightly downward towards the keyboard.\n\n* Rest your right hand on C D E F G in a nice, relaxed manner.  No tension.  Nicely curved fingers.  There is a natural curve that our hands want to return to when they are relaxed.  This is what we want to return to as often as possible while playing the piano.\n\n* Set your metronome on 60bpm.\n\n* Start with half notes.  Run through each note of the 5 note scale paying careful attention to how your fingers are moving.  Are you keeping a curve?  Are you relaxing the fingers that aren't in use? Is your wrist level?  Are you playing exactly in time with the metronome?  Is your dynamic level the same from note to note?  Are you lifting any fingers too high before you play each note?\n\n* Do that for a few minutes.  You are PRACTICING a lack of tension in your playing while maintaining a very careful level of control.  You are also being hyper critical and aware of how your body is moving.\n\n* Next try quarter notes for a few minutes.  Then eighth notes.  Then triplets.  Then sixteenth notes.  Are you able to achieve the same consistency at each new level of speed?  What about isolating different parts of the scale?  Is playing 4 5 4 5 easy and effortless?  If anything ever stops feeling easy and effortless, then slow it down and get back to the relaxation zone.\n\n* Try this on different scales.  Try this in your left hand.  Try this running a full scale.  Try this on arpeggios.  Create your own exercises to isolate different areas of your piano technique.\n\nTrying to start on 16th notes and trills after 3 years off is only going to build bad habits into your playing.  Really take the time to start slow and simple.\n\nDoes that help at all and give you any ideas?  Taking lessons when you are able to can also be incredibly beneficial.  I have some adult students who can only squeeze in a lesson once a month or so, but they always come with great questions and leave lessons having plenty to think about and work on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398784613", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The sniping route which is to cut off targets escaping a teamfight (Typically only use this when you have already won the teamfight and your ult will not have a large impact). The other, much more common use, is to lay it in the middle of the team fight or in an open fog abuse spot (think the trees at tier 1 mid tower legion side) which will offer my teammates A LOT of regen and a large burst of damage. A lot of people think you should always W before ulting but that is more for the sniping route. Your ult copies the E bolts that come with your W and can actually add on a lot of damage if you are sure you can get a full channel on W while still having time to demolish teamfights. A good idea of when to not W before ulting is a rax push. You know they are going to stay there to defend the rax and you know you have control of when the fight ends.

{"body": "&gt; Does each one have a different set of DNA that would produce a different child?\n\nYes. You have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Each sperm has only one half of each chromosome pair. However, every sperm chooses randomly different halves. So if you have pairs AB CD EF GH XY, one sperm might choose A C E G X, and another might choose B D F H Y, and a third might chose A D F G Y. Since there are exactly 23 pairs, there are 2^23 or 8,388,608 possible combinations. There are significantly more sperm than that in your body at any given moment, so there are definitely some duplicates, but yes, they're different from one another and would produce totally different babies.\n\nA good example is gender. As a male, you have an XY chromosome pair. An XX pair means a girl, and an XY pair means a boy. Since women have two X's, their eggs will always choose X. Your sperm will randomly choose between your X and your Y, like any other chromosome, so half your sperm will have an X and half will have a Y. If an X sperm reaches the egg, that's two X's, so it'll be a girl, and if a Y sperm reaches the egg, that's an X and a Y, so it'll be a boy. That's also why there's a 50-50 chance it'll be a boy or a girl. If a doctor carefully chose a sperm to put in an egg by looking at its genes, he could pick the gender.\n\n&gt; How do the testes create sperm?\n\nMeiosis. It's pretty much the same as producing any other cells, except that you end up with half of each chromosome pair instead of completely copying the genes.\n\n&gt; How long do they store it for? Is it recycled?\n\nSperm's good for quite a few months, but they die like any other cell and are processed back into the body like any other cell. Nothing in your body lasts forever. It's good at picking up the bits and building new stuff.\n\n&gt; How much is \"decided\" by the sperm in terms of the child's development as opposed to the egg? Does one play a greater part than the other in certain parts of development?\n\nHalf the genes come from the mom, half from the dad. Once they're mixed into a new person, it doesn't really matter whether a certain gene came from the mom or the dad.\n\n&gt; Is sperm... Alive?\n\nThat's a tough one. What's alive? Is your left hand alive? Is a virus alive? If I take some red blood cells out of your body, are they alive? They'll keep doing red blood cell stuff for a while in a vial before they die, just like sperm.

{"body": "Still used to this day, the QWERTY layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer who lived in Milwaukee. In October 1867, Sholes filed a patent application for his early writing machine he developed with the assistance of his friends Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soulé.[3]\n\nThe first model constructed by Sholes used a piano-like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as follows:[3]\n\n    - 3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n     2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M\n\nThe construction of the \"Type Writer\" had two flaws that made the product susceptible to jams. Firstly, characters were mounted on metal arms or typebars, which would clash and jam if neighboring arms were pressed at the same time or in rapid succession.[4] Secondly, its printing point was located beneath the paper carriage, invisible to the operator, a so-called \"up-stroke\" design. Consequently, jams were especially serious, because the typist could only discover the mishap by raising the carriage to inspect what he had typed. The solution was to place commonly used letter-pairs (like \"th\" or \"st\") so that their typebars were not neighboring, avoiding jams. Contrary to popular belief,[5] the QWERTY layout was not designed to slow the typist down,[6] but rather to speed up typing by preventing jams.[4][7] There is also evidence that, aside from the issue of jamming, keys being farther apart increases typing speed on its own, because it encourages alternation between the hands.[6] Almost every word in the English language contains at least one vowel letter, but on the QWERTY keyboard only the vowel letter \"A\" is located on the home row, which requires the typist's fingers to leave the home row for most words.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398868133", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**--------= = = = A Z T E C S = = = =--------**\n\nI've reimagined the Aztecs with more ranged capability than in AoE2, where they were mostly an Infantry civ. Their army usually consists of: Shorn Ones, Jaguar Knights, Eagle Knights, Atlatl Skirmishers, and Monks. The Aztec army is one of the most unique ones in the game, relying on 3 exclusive units (Shorn, Eagle, Jag), a semi-exclusive unit (Atlatl), and a unit that is shared among all civs but has different attributes per civ (Monk). Due to the fact that they did not put an intrinsic value on gold, Aztecs do not rely much on it just like the Mayans and Incas, though they rely on it more than those two.\n\n**UNIQUES AND BONUSES**\n\n&gt;Farms cost -33%\n\n* The reason why I gave this to the Aztecs and not to the Franks or the Teutons or anybody else is because this fits the Aztecs better than any other civ. The Aztecs used to use mud, compost, and reed islands known as Chinampas to grow their food on top of, which shows a clear conservation of resources and efficiency. That's exactly what this bonus means.\n\n&gt;Monks convert buildings faster\n\n* The Aztecs lose their powerful but hard to use Monk bonus in favor of a more straightforward one.\n\n&gt;Slingers +15% movement speed\n\n* Just like the Incas, Aztec Slingers are faster and thus make good scouts and almost replace cavalry archers. The Aztecs made very good use of Slings and were among the most effective users of the Bow (having been invented in Mesoamerica around 700 AD) in the area. That's not to say that they didn't do melee: ammunition for ranged weapons is limited so of course they would have fought in melee but I wanted to characterize them more as a ranged civ due to their love of those weapons.\n\n&gt;Start with Slinger instead of Rider\n\n* Similar to the shared AoE2 Eagle Warrior bonus.\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: Eagle Knights available at Barracks in Feudal (need Castle)\n\n* This is me ripping off The Forgotten's Italian team bonus. I wanted the Aztecs to have 3 Unique Units, and one of them would have had to come from a more common building. Anyway, the Jaguars and the Eagles would have had their own Barracks and temples and such but Jaguars weren't more prestigious (which is what their creation at the Castle vs the Eagles' creation at the Barracks implies). There is some truth to the idea of Aztecs allying with neighboring polities and then hiring themselves out to defend those polities. In fact, during the era before they became the strongest regional power (let's pretend this era is the Feudal Age)\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Eagle Knight: Fast, anti-Gunpowder, anti-Monk Infantry?\n\n* I haven't really quite made up a good role for the Eagle Knight but I think maybe he should be like the Condottiero in The Forgotten, an anti-gunpowder, anti-Monk unit. This would make the Aztecs and their allies very powerful vs civs with Handgunners since Handgunners kill fast Cavalry but wouldn't be especially effective vs fast Infantry.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Jaguar Knight: Anti-Infantry Slinger?\n\n* The Jag is still made at the Castle. This time, he'd wield an Atlatl. I'm not entirely sure what role he'd play yet.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Shorn One: Anti-Cavalry Infantry with splash damage\n\n* To get access to the Shorn Ones, the Aztecs must first be in the Imperial Age, and then research \"Shorn Ones\" at their Castles, which will finally allow them to be created. The Shorn Ones were these badass motherfuckers in the Aztec military who would shear (where \"Shorn\" comes from) the hair off their entire head except for a lock of hair above their left ear. They were the elite troops of the Aztec army and would not be allowed to take a step backwards in battle or else their own allies were allowed to kill them. My idea for the Aztecs is to give them a Cavalry weakness, to reflect how the Spanish beat them. The only unit they have that can really give it to Cavalry is the Shorn One but they get the Shorn Ones very, very late in the game. The Shorn Ones would wield big ass macanas and be the ultimate Infantry.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Blood Debt: Monks convert everything faster?\n\n* The Forgotten's Inquisition tech repurposed for the Aztecs. The \"Blood Debt\" is an important part of Aztec philosophy, the idea being that the gods created their world and provide for them so the Aztecs must repay this debt in blood by sacrifice.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Flower Wars: \n\n* No idea yet.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry: no Pikeman, Great Swordsman, other Blacksmith techs?\n\n* The Aztecs only have one fully upgraded Infantry unit from the Barracks. They would also miss a plethora of Blacksmith techs (but that would be okay because their Unique Units have high base stats). The lack of Pikeman and Great Swordsman make it hard for them to fight Cavalry. Their lack of Infantry is due to the fact that they didn't have iron or steel.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Elephants, Mounted Archer, Arbalister, Handgunner, Composite Bowman\n\n* Their signature weapon is the Atlatl Skirmisher, their strongest unit from the Archery Range.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: none\n\n* Uh, none.\n\n&gt;Siege: no Capped Ram, Cannon, Bombard\n\n* The Aztec Siege tech tree is still pretty good, kind of like how it is in AoE2. But historically the Aztecs didn't make use of Siege.\n\n&gt;Monks: \n\n* Maybe the Aztec Monks wouldn't be quite as strong as they are in Age of Empires 2 ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398894802", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
