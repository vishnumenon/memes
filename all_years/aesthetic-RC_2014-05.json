{"body": "**--------= = = = M A Y A N S = = = =--------**\n\nI've shamelessly taken the Goths and made them into Mesoamerican peoples. Basically, the Mayans playstyle in AoE2 was completely made up. Archery would have barely hit Mesoamerica in the heyday of the Mayans before the Classic collapse. The Mayans would not have had decent archery at all, and they did not have massed archers. I cut the Goths because nobody identified as \"Goths\" after the 700s, except for a tiny polity in Crimea. The Teutons and Vikings can represent the Goths just fine. Anyhoo, we don't know very much about Mayan warfare except that warfare was usually limited to small groups of Elites. So Infantry spam is still not historical but I can at least lend some historical flavor to it: firstly, the Mayan population in the Yucatan was pretty high. Secondly, war was not institutionalized like it was in Aztec society, which was pretty much a martial government. Thirdly, most Mayan weapons and armor would not have been of high quality due to lacking most smelting techniques so masses of weak soldiers is fairly balanced. Fourth, there was a sense of sacrifice in Mayan society where masses of Infantry throwing themselves at the enemy makes sense.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n**BONUSES AND UNIQUES**\n\n&gt; Infantry costs -35%\n\n* Uhhh, I ended up justifying the Infantry spam in the paragraph above so...shit.\n\n&gt; Start with free Turkey\n\n* The Inca bonus from The Forgotten. Domestic Turkeys originated in Yucatan, so it makes more sense for the Mayans to have it. This is a weak bonus, kind of like how the Goths have a weak economic bonus in AoE2 but make up for it with cheap Infantry. I'd like for the Mayans to be sort of a reverse Goths, strong early game but tapering off late game.\n\n&gt;Slingers move +15% faster\n\n* The one unit in the Mayan inventory that isn't Infantry, kind of like how the Hand Cannoneer was in the Goths' arsenal. Slingers are faster and are the Mayans equivalent of Scouts (and Cavalry Archers).\n\n&gt;Start with Slinger instead of Scout\n\n* Same as the Inca and Aztec bonus, taking away the Scout since the Mayans didn't have horses.\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: Barracks work +20% faster? I guess?\n\n* Uh yeah.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Holcan: Anti-Siege Infantry\n\n* Holcan is Mayan for \"War Chief,\" the leaders and most elite troops in most Mayan armies. Holcans appear in Age of Empires 3 where they are anti-Cavalry Infantry. The Mayans have real crappy Siege weapons, so they need a way to fight them, and this is why I made the Holcan anti-Siege. So the Mayans get Holcans for Siege, Pikemen vs Cavalry, Atlatl Skirmishers vs Archers, Great Swordsman vs Infantry, and Halberdiers for the sake of mass.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Dance of the War Chiefs: Castles work +50% faster\n\n* The Dance of the War Chiefs (Dance of the Holcans) was a ritual performed by the Holcans before war and battles. This also serves as a reference to Age of Empires 3. The Mayans do not get an equivalent to Anarchy because I want them to build Castles and fortifications, a major difference between them and the Goths. I must state that the Mayans miss the Trebuchet, and are the only civ to miss Trebs. It's pretty weird seeing any of the Meso civs use Siege, and I wanted at least one to miss it. They are one of the few civs in the game to make regular use of Petards since they create them faster, and the idea of dudes willing to kill themselves in warfare is pretty Mesoamerican.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Uprising: Barracks work +100% faster\n\n* The Mayans tried to rise up against the Spanish several times after the Spanish conquest of the Yucatan. This is a reference to that, and it makes sense that small Mayan villages with their Castles and political systems destroyed would turn to their local units and Barracks.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry: several Blacksmith techs\n\n* The Mayans lacked most ironworking, so there's that. I've tried to buff Infantry, and I'm assuming my changes will make them stronger than they are in AoE2. In that case, having the exact same bonuses as the Goths may be too powerful. In exchange, the Mayans, just like the Incas and the Aztecs, will miss alot of Blacksmith techs, and that's historically accurate as well. The Mayans did not have big ass two-handed Swords, and they didn't have Halberds though they had Pikes.\n\n&gt; Archery: no Elephants, Mounted Archer, Crossbowman, Handgunner, Composite Bowman\n\n* The Mayans lack in almost every area of the Archery Range except that they get Atlatl Skirmishers. They should probably get most Archery Range techs.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: none\n\n* NO CAVALRY\n\n&gt;Siegery: no Capped Ram, Mangonel, Cannon, Bombard, Trebuchet\n\n* They are the only civ to lack Trebuchet. They basically lack in everything except for getting fully upgraded Siege Towers that they can use with their Atlatl Skirmishers. There's at least one depiction of Mayan Siege Towers on murals so that's why they get that tech. Otherwise the Mayans had no Siege weaponry in real life.\n\n&gt;Monkery: \n\n* The Mayans should have Monks that have something to do with...sacrifice.\n\n&gt;Navery: \n\n* I don't fucking know bro.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398924132", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**--------= = = = V I K I N G S = = = =--------**\n\nMy idea for the Vikings on land is to give them \"land ships,\" which would be the Siege Tower and Capped Ram. The Vikings loved to fight with guerilla tactics, running out from their Ships and attacking quickly, then retreating back to their Ships. This is basically my attempt to give the Vikings a little more variety than Infantry and Archers, which is kind of what they had in AoE2. This is not historically accurate but if the Vikings had magic, moving wooden land vehicles they would use them similarly to their moving wooden water vehicles.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**IMPERIAL AGE ARMY:**\n\n* Berserker\n\n* Pikeman\n\n* Great Swordsman\n\n* Composite Bowman\n\n* Capped Ram\n\n* Siege Tower\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n**UNIQUES AND BONUSES**\n\n&gt;Moving Towers and Rams gain 17% move speed per unit garrisoned\n\n&gt;Units heal inside Towers and Rams, benefit from Herbal Medicine\n\n* This goes with the last bonus. Vikings get pretty strong Archers as a result of this and the last bonus.\n\n&gt;Ships cost -10%\n\nWarships costing -20% is too OP so 10% is better. Plus honestly, the Vikings were not known for fighting straight on naval battles against most of their enemies, except against each other. This also doubles as an economic bonus, making Fishing Ships cheaper.\n\n* Some sort of Economic tech based on colonization\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: Galleys +50% Line of Sight\n\n* Not as strong as the Dock bonus and more historically accurate; Vikings were great ship navigators. Cheaper Docks is actually historically inaccurate because half of the reason why the Vikings were so powerful was that their ships did not require Docks.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Berserker: Regenerating, fast Infantry\n\n* I always thought that a unit who was fast and could retreat from fighting would make the best use of health regen. Since I took away the Celts, I decided to merge a pretty useless Unique Unit, the Berserk, with a kind of good-ish Unique Unit (but not very Unique), the Woad Raider, to create a great unit. So Berserkers can actually leave battle quickly and come back after regenerating their health.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Longboat: Regenerating Warship\n\n* I also thought that Longboats should regenerate like Berserkers, too.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Housecarls:  \n\n* As a nod to the Goths since I cut them, and because Housecarls were more of a Scandinavian thing than an early Germanic tribe thing. I don't really know how this tech would work, though.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Kalmar Union: All units heal faster\n\n* The Kalmar Union was the union of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, which created a very large and powerful kingdom, at least for a short while until they broke up. This would benefit Berserkers, Longboats, all units garrisoned in Castles and Keeps (think of the Normans), and all units garrisoned in Siege Towers and Capped Rams.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry: no Halberdier\n\n* But the Vikings would get the Throwing Axe technology. The Scandinavians eventually adopted the Pike and Shot warfare of the rest of the European continent but up until then they relied on Infantry formations.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Elephants, Mounted Archers, Handgun, Atlatls\n\n* The Vikings lack quite a few units here but they get Composite Bowmen. The Viking bow was more of a Longbow type (and a Longbow is a type of Selfbow). Composite Bows were not used by the Vikings so that's historically inaccurate but this represents the strength of Viking archery instead. The Vikings loved the bow and made no qualms of using it, unlike the rest of Europe who eschewed the use of the Bow and often made a point about it being a cowards' weapon. The Scandinavians had Crossbows, and they eventually adopted handguns. I didn't give them Handgunners in order to accentuate a slight Cavalry weakness.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: no Camel, Light Cavalry, Cavalier\n\n* Viking cavalry sucks. Scandinavia is not a horse friendly place so their soldiers did not usually ride them in battles.\n\n&gt;Siege: no Bombard, Cannon, Onager\n\n* Fast Capped Rams and Siege Towers is all they really get. The rest of their tech tree is pretty meh. I took away their gunpowder but ironically large cannons are probably the first mention of Scandinavian siege weaponry, whereas before that they didn't make too much use of Siege. Maybe I should give them Bombards or Cannons or something.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398926388", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Traditional mandolin players may not like me for this post. I taught myself mandolin without any research or advice from others so it's probably not the 'correct' way to go about it, but it worked great to get me started fast from guitar.\n\nI played guitar for about 5 years before buying a mandolin, which I've now been at for 3 years. The switch only took a matter of hours to play all the songs I had already known on guitar. I rarely had to even look up a chord. Your four strings on the mandolin are tuned to the same notes as the top four on the guitar, E A D G, but upside down and at different octaves, G D A E. Being at a different octave doesn't matter very often for shapes so you can play all your guitar chords as they would sit on the E A D G strings on the guitar if it were upside down. To put it in tab:\n\nHere's an E chord on the top four strings of a guitar:\n\nE:--0--\n\nA:--2--\n\nD:--2--\n\nG:--1--\n\n\nAnd here's an E chord on a mandolin:\n\nG:--1--\n\nD:--2--\n\nA:--2--\n\nE:--0--\n\nG chord on a guitar:\n\nE:--3--\n\nA:--2--\n\nD:--0--\n\nG:--0--\n\nG chord on mandolin:\n\nG:--0--\n\nD:--0--\n\nA:--2--\n\nE:--3--\n\nExactly the same but upside down. There are of course chord shapes for mandolin that sound better in different circumstances than a transposed guitar shape, but you can look them up as you need them. As it is, if you know guitar chords you can learn to play most every one of them on a mandolin in an afternoon simply by flipping them. From there it's just a matter of refining your fingering and learning new chord shapes to replace ones you don't care for.\n\nPicking notes is a little trickier to transpose from a guitar, but you can figure that out in time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1398982885", "subreddit": "mandolin", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**--------= = = = B A N T U = = = =--------**\n\nA catch-call name for a variety of peoples in Sub-Saharan Africa. My civ refers specifically to the peoples of Benin, Kongo, and other Central-West African Kingdoms. This could also refer to the peoples of East Africa on the Swahili coast. I've shamelessly ripped off the Mayans of AoE2 for this, but that's only because a lot of their bonuses work so well for the Bantu! The Bantu are sort of a 4th \"Meso civ,\" in that they have nearly nonexistant cavalry and gunpowder.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**BONUSES AND UNIQUES**\n\n&gt;Archery Range units cost -10/15/20%\n\n* The Kingdom of Kongo used tons of archers. Tons and tons and tons of archers. Archery was their favorite weapon.\n\n&gt;Economic Bonus, maybe referring to trade...Food trade is 3%?\n\n* Sub-saharan Africa is not exactly kind to farming so my idea was for some sort of trade bonus, as the Sub-Saharan Kingdoms lived off of trade. I was thinking of some kind of super specific, Saracen like bonus except for Food only.\n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: Walls cost -50%\n\n* Benin had humongous ass earthen walls. Actually, I believe most of the Kingdoms in that area had big ass walls.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Pombo: Super Skirmisher\n\n* The Pombo would be like a pumped up Atlatl Skirmisher, just as fast as Meso Atlatl Skirmishers and with higher stats overall. A Pombo was a type of light infantryman in the Kingdom of Kongo who would scout ahead and skirmish with enemies. Portuguese chronicles said that the Pombo could keep up with horses, and they would twist and dodge enemy projectiles in battle. In this way, the Pombo is somewhat similar to the Plumed Archer.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Assegai: Skirmishers, Pombo +2 Attack, +1 Range\n\n* A traditional spear used by many Bantu peoples in Africa. I don't really know what this would entail. Maybe I'd rip off the Atlatl UT in The Forgotten?\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: \n\n* I haven't come up with one yet.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS**\n\n&gt;Infantry: no Great Sword\n\n* I gave the Bantu a nearly full Infantry tech tree, kind of like the Mayans in AoE2. The Kingdom of Kongo did not have giant swords but they did use long spears and halberd-ish weapons.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Elephants, Mounted Archers, Handgunner, Atlatls\n\n* The Bantu get cheap, cheap Composite Bowmen and cheap Skirmishers (not fully upgraded but still probably good?). They miss Handgunner but get Arbalister. I don't know why I gave them Arbalister, maybe to make them stronger in the Feudal Age. The Bantu did not have access to the Composite Bow in real life but this is for gameplay's sake...I dunno, perhaps the Mayan bonus was considered kind of OP in AoE2, and since I'm intent on buffing the final foot Archer unit maybe I could take away the fully upgraded Archer unit here and the bonus would balance it?\n\n&gt;Cavalry: no Camels, Scout Cavalry, Noble Rider\n\n* Most of Sub-Saharan Africa is unsafe for horses due to the prevalence of the Tetse Fly. There weren't a whole lot of horses but cavalry was used on occasion, so the Bantu aren't quite a \"Meso\" non-Meso civ. I still made their cavalry tech tree really, really shitty. So the only unit they get is the initial Scout. Yippee!\n\n&gt;Siege: no Onager, Cannon, Bombard\n\n* Siege weapons among the Bantu peoples wasn't well-known, so their Siege tech tree is lacking. They at least get the Capped Ram, the Siege Tower, and the Mangonel so their Siege is about as useable as the Mayans in AoE2. Capped Rams fit a \"low-tech\" feel for a civilization like these dudes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399004631", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Computer Engineer here. The real way to answer this question is WHY we use bytes and WHY we use bits. \n\nA bit is just a single binary digit which means it can be a 0 or a 1. Shannon first popularized (though not coined) this term and used it as the smallest primitive we could use in communication for Bell Labs because they had no idea how to measure the data on their phone system. \n\nFast forward a few years to the mid 50's and we've got this crazy thing called computers. Computer scientists are now dealing with hundreds of bits at a time and its really freaking hard to read them. Have you ever looked at a long series of 0001000101010010? It's impossible to read. Unfortunately we cannot convert the same number of binary digits to the same amount of decimal digits! 111 in binary is 7, 1000 in binary is 8! We need to maintain a strict digit count ratio for readability. \n\nThis is why we now have bytes. It turns out that four bits can be \"compressed\" perfectly into a hexadecimal (base 16) system perfectly! This is because any combination of 4 bits can be mapped to a single hexadecimal character. 1111 in binary is 15  in decimal! \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with hexadecimal it goes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F, where A can be read as 10, B can be read as 11, C can be read as 12, D is 13, E is 14, F is 15.  The important thing to realize is that 10 in hexadecimal is actually 16 in decimal. This means a *new* digit for hex won't start without a *new* digit for binary, every single time. Very important.\n\nBut these 4 bits being represented as hex aren't the full 8 bits needed to be a byte. They are instead only a nibble! (not a joke they're actually called a nibble). If you put two of them together THEN you get a byte. \n\nAs computers got larger and faster the byte defacto became the smallest quantity of addressable information. This is because when dealing with data a single nibble isn't very expressive, it only has 16 possible combination (0 through 15). Instead if you slap just a single extra nibble it can hold up to the value 255! You've probably seen this number everywhere. This means that when you're running a computer program most variables aren't going to be under a byte long. There are of course ways around this, like bit fields and masking macros in C to address a single bit out of a byte, it's just fairly common to use a full byte and virtually no one in higher level programming cares to do other wise. \n\nSo in summery the byte came about because instead of writing 1110 1111 0010 1010 I can write EF2A and after working in it for a few months it basically looks like the same thing to you. So then for some reason both bytes and bits have stuck around. This is for the very simple reason that bytes are better for reading data directly from binary, and bits are better for control fields, figuring out error rates, or figuring out transmission rate. We don't \"send\" a byte of data onto a phone line, or a cable line, or however you get your internet. Instead, we send one symbol at a time. A symbol is exactly like it sounds like. Imagine a kid in a pool who splashes and creates a certain height wave and you were on the other side of the pool recording the waves he sent. You knew one wave that looked one way was a 0 and another wave which looked another way was a 1. This is basically the same thing. There will be many symbols \"in flight\" on the line at once, but like I said they're sent one at a time. It's true a symbol can be a byte or more (8 different ways to splash!), but that all depends on modulation techniques and in the end we still usually refer to error rate for bits rather than symbol error rate. \n\nNow computers have gotten even faster faster and faster since the 50's. We're now dealing with MEGA bits and MEGA bytes. In the scientific community mega is the prefix for a million. If you ever see mega it really just means that number multiplied a million times.  This is why we always talk about MB (mega bytes) and Mb (mega bits). \n\ntldr\n\nbits are the smallest form of information in digital communication. We use them to describe things like rates or other more continuous things\n\nBytes are used to describe stuff like computer memory and are 8 bits. They don't break down perfectly for statistics. \n\nThere's nothing stopping us from having an a  5 bit system (embedded guys know what I'm saying). We just stick to the byte based computing out of convention. \n\nWe switch between the two terms because both are still useful. \n\nEdit: Said slap on extra byte when I meant slap on extra nibble to make a byte.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399018861", "subreddit": "answers", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[BIGBANG](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/BIGBANG_Extraordinary_20's.JPG) debuted as a 5-member group in 2006 under YG Entertainment. Their music was almost exclusively hip-hop oriented, and while they prominently feature two rappers, their sound and style have changed throughout the years. Their debut was fairly successful, but things changed when \"Lies\" was released. They've had their issues in the past. Still, they remain a huge force in the industry.\n\n* Fanclub: [VIP](http://i2.wp.com/bigbangupdates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fb3.jpg) (Very Important Person)\n* Color: [Yellow](http://24-7kpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/big-bang-crown-light.jpg)\n\n*****\n\n**Members**\n\n* **[G-Dragon](http://coolasianhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/G-Dragon-For-Bean-Pole-g-dragon-29447232-600-900.jpg)**: Leader, Rapper (Lead), Vocals\n\n     * Alternative names: [GD](http://www.officiallykmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KMUSIC_gd11.jpg)\n\n     * Born [Kwon](http://coolasianhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gdragon-birthday1.jpg) [Ji-yong](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q9nXh6odWYY/T6P3omKzCRI/AAAAAAAAAug/Hv-L95AKwAE/s640/G-Dragon-550x4081.jpg). His stage name is a play on \"Ji-yong\", \"G\" for \"Ji\" and \"Yong\" for \"Dragon\". Initially a trainee under SM entertainment. G-Dragon was a trainee with YG for 6 years before debuting. His normally reserved nature in public belies his flamboyant stage/musician persona. G-Dragon is a bit of a fashion icon, and has changed his style and image over the years. He's written a large amount of BIGBANG's songs, including member solos. He currently has two solo albums, a collaboration album, and a mini-album.\n\n     * Theme Song: [One Of A Kind](http://youtu.be/rJnICByeL8Q)\n\n* **[T.O.P](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmw16uLcyr1qd39rt.gif)**: Rapper (Main)\n\n     * Alternative names: [Tabi](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W4PrY7XhI8A/UPU6C2qQhhI/AAAAAAAAAB8/MPfxewaCx28/s1600/5854.97594422.top-detail-608x342.jpg), [Bingu TOP](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llovchdAMY1qi6l9l.gif), [Choom TOP](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mefzkpWw1a1rad1fm.gif)\n\n     * Born [Choi](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/32100000/Photoshoot-choi-seung-hyun-32182179-581-737.jpg) [Seung](http://ygfamilyph.weebly.com/uploads/2/0/8/5/20857094/3001942_orig.jpg)-[hyun](http://www.aznlover.com/asia/sites/default/files/field/image/-t-o-p-top-from-big-bang-33335316-769-1024.jpg). TOP is the low-voiced rapper. He was a neighborhood friend of GD, and they would often practice and perform together. As GD was getting ready to debut with a group, he suggested TOP (then an underground rapper) audition for YG. TOP was rejected at first for body-image purposes, but was accepted a month later after having lost the weight. His reserved nature in public also contrasts his rapper persona. TOP is the oldest member, but he's the [youngest](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iLDI4KRJajg/UHqtfI70KEI/AAAAAAAABj4/JQhEf5sgNMQ/s1600/T.O.P+Turn+It+Up+Bingu+TOP.gif) [at](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0jpwvcYeTWM/UQYt35zCXGI/AAAAAAAAATw/DmMBPE_Xo7I/s1600/537301_587591737936431_150607602_n.jpg) [heart](https://alltheone.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/kyaa-my-tabi-bingu.gif).

He is one of BIGBANG's dancers and is the resident shirtless member. Of the three vocalists, he is smoother. Taeyang and GD were both YG trainees, and have been friends since they started. He is starting to [play](http://coolasianhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Taeyang-G-Dragon_1384195430_af_org.jpg) [around](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qYtFlbIIttk/UnOpBO2t__I/AAAAAAAAY7E/6zMCWTEVisI/s1600/taeyang_elle_november_2013_002.jpg) [with](http://theturnmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/taeyang-kpop-ringa-linga-video-798x350.jpg) [styles](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gVaCdX_l0ks/UoRdY5DE-NI/AAAAAAABfeY/vtLGazw8ixg/s1600/taeyang.jpg) and sounds, and is growing as a solo artist. He has a solo album, a mini album, and several singles to date.\n     * Theme Song: [Only Look At Me](http://youtu.be/3bRrGsNymUI)\n\n* **[Daesung](http://cdn.bigbangupdates.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/bigbangupdates+extraordinary+20s+daesung+scans_022.jpg)**: Vocalist (Lead)\n\n     * Alternative name: [D-Lite](http://i0.wp.com/bigbangupdates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/daesung.jpg)\n\n     * Born [Kang](http://www.soompi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/daesung1-800x450.jpg) [Dae](http://p.twimg.com/At0A7C7CMAAOy9c.jpg:large)-[sung](http://www.officiallykmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/130128Daesung.jpg). His vocals are husky and powerful. He's not out and about in public like GD or TOP, but he's just as reserved. We see his outgoing personality and wit through his television appearances. He was a permanent member of Family Outing and Night After Night, and has made appearances on Korean and Japanese variety shows as either a host or guest. Daesung has also appeared in a drama and a musical. He has a solo album (Japanese) and several singles.\n\n     * Theme Song: [Wings](http://youtu.be/60XBAkNeo5g)\n\n* **[Seungri](http://kpopchuu.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/1295054596_25893.jpg)**: Vocalist, Maknae, Troublemaker\n\n     * Alternative name: [V.I.](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/35000000/-Seungri-seungri-35091105-768-1024.jpg) / [Victory](http://lovequakes.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/seungri4_11052009_seoulbeats.jpg), [Panda](http://www.kawankumagz.com/articleFoto/Seungri_Big_Bang:_Panda_Boy1.png)\n\n     * Born [Lee](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIhIEkRCYAA9zt-.jpg:large) [Seung](http://i905.photobucket.com/albums/ac260/ngsujean/tumblr_ljdrde4MG71qfk7kd.gif)-[hyun](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltnjvyXcXd1qjwvgso1_250.gif). Seungri is BIGBANG's other dancer. He was the leader of the dance group\"Il Hwa\" in his hometown, prior to debut. He competed in Mnet Battle Shinhwa, and was praised for his dancing skills. He was cut from the program, however. He was also cut from BIGBANG, but was given a second chance. He's had a hand in some of BIGBANG's choreography. Like Daesung, Seungri has appeared in Korean and Japanese variety shows both as a host and guest. He's also been in a few movies and dramas. Seungri has opened dance academies in Korea, \"Seungri Academy\", which provide both singing and dance training. \n     * Theme Song: [Gotta Talk To U](http://youtu.be/Yki3X1pG3ZE)\n\n*****\n\nLast year's [BB post](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1foait/right_rkpop_lets_help_each_other_and_me_discover/cac7ewr) listed the most representative songs. I want to add 5 new ones to that.\n\n1. [B I G B A N G](http://youtu.be/8OoRYCHluU0)\n     * This is the \"old sound\" for me. It's their roots, and quite different from, say, Fantastic Baby. I like all their styles, but I really like songs like B I G B A N G.\n2. [Love Song](http://youtu.be/IKZEmLvYVF0)\n     * The voice transitions are great. It starts with a soft TOP to Daesung transition, then to something higher (GD). And then it oscillates between higher registers and lower ones. And Seungri's voice is uncharacteristically lower here, but it completely works.\n3. [Love Dust](http://youtu.be/oIg6HtzBcFo)\n     * This is a warm-feeling song like Love Song, but there are really great bright spots in Taeyang and Seungri. I like to call this lighter electro, and is definitely part of their new sound.\n4. [Bad Boy](http://youtu.be/1qnV55LUFVM)\n     * I think this as a mature return to roots, and I treat this as a nod to the group they started out as. It's not that their earlier songs were childish or anything, but the composition and sound is a lot more grown-up.\n5. [Blue](http://youtu.be/2GRP1rkE4O0)\n     * This is a great example of group cohesion. I can pick out each member's voices, but I think there's some great blending going on. \n\nHonorable Mention:\n\n1. [Sunset Glow](http://youtu.be/aMwqGfovrIk)\n2. [Gara Gara Go!!](http://youtu.be/fkwPTz67sgI)\n\n*****\n\nThis was my intro group. I was having fun in college, and my friends and I were going out and being ridiculous. They remind me of good things and times. But let's get into things.\n\nTheir voices are unique, and I enjoy being able to pick them out in a song. This might also be a function of the group size, but that is also a plus for me. I like their ability to have distinct directions as solo artists, and how they've all been successful in their search for a voice. Put them together, though? They're something incredibly special. As different as they all are, they can come together and be one. I really feel how they're a group.\n\n*****\n\nI might add a bit more later on this evening (variety shows and stuff)\n\n*****\n\nVIP ~~until whenever~~ forever!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399040189", "subreddit": "kpop", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

Which means it was Mikami's fault in the end for not trusting Light would have a plan B for emergencies like these. Not gonna question the fact that, yes, Mikami was the most useful person possibly, but in the end, a little mistake on his part was Light's demise.\n\nAbout the L's successor, it's hard to say there wasn't a plan B and a plan C D E F for those cases.

They don't engage in any deeper philosophical thinking than that.**\n\nIt seems like it Near had written Mikami's name in the death note with the whole \"you are going to show up without checking the notebook...\" kinda falls apart, if Near really follow L's ideology, he would never be able to go so low to get this victory. Possibly he also wouldn't be able to manipulate Mello. Or...Near is not such a follower of L's ideology when it comes to somethings, but does to other. He does not question Justice, even when presented by the facts that yes, Kira was indeed good to the world. I agree that Light was a dick and he killed people that made me question how good he was, but still, the fact that Near does not deny that make me hate him even more. By the time I was reading I agreed completely with Kira's view of the world, that some people are just rotten and shouldn't be allowed to have a second chance. In this case, I  thought: Fuck, if the police gave up on capturing Kira, if L or Near actually stepped in to help and decide who should die the world could be a better place.\n\nAnd apparently, Near didn't completely disagree with this fact, that Kira did good to the world. Yes, he completely trashed Light's \"I'm God STFU YOLO\", I agree that Light's ego was way over the top. But he could have tried countering something about Light's plan besides that. He was a mass murder...of mass murderers, of dictators, of rapists, of people who make the world a worse place. Near could at least say \"Do you think all those innocent people you killed deserved that? Do you think you're someone to decide who should be sacrificed for you selfish plan?\" And that would be a blow to his argument, would be a blow to his plan.\n\nGod, thanks a lot of that, I was wishing to discuss death note this seriously for a long time now, but no one had gone this far into the interpretations, you caught me off guard many times, I had to re read the ending to stand a chance here.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399065663", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Strokes may be *straight*, as in k l v w x z, or *curved*, as in c o s. If straight, they may be *horizontal, vertical,* or *diagonal*; if curved, *open* or *closed*. Typographers also speak of an *instroke,* where one starts writing the letter, as at the top of a c f, and an *outstroke,* where the pen leaves off, as at the bottom of c e j k t y.\n\n&gt;A main vertical stroke is called a *stem.* The letter m has three, the left, middle, and right stems. The central stroke of an s is called the *spine.* A stroke, usually a stem, which rises above the height of an x (called the [x height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_height)) is called an *[ascender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography\\))*; letters with ascenders are b d f h k l. A stroke which drops below the [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography\\)) is a *[descender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descender)*. Letters with descenders are g j p q y. An arching stroke is called a *shoulder* or sometimes just an *arch*, as in h n m. A closed curved stroke is called a *bowl* in b d o p q D O P Q R; B has two bowls. A trailing outstroke, as in j k y J K Q R is called a *tail.* A short horizontal stroke, as in the center of e f t A and the middle stroke of E F, is called a *bar*. A longer horizontal stroke at the top or bottom, as in E F L T, is called an *arm.* The bottom of the [two-story g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G) is called a *loop*; the very short stroke at the top is called the *ear*. i j each have a *dot* or *[tittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tittle)*.

{"body": "As a short answer, yes, I believe capitalism has now boiled down to regional monopolies. Newcomers have no way to effectively break in to established markets In the beginning it works just fine, when A B C D and E all make competing products and their consumers choose who they like the most. 20 years down the road, A and D have pushed B C and E out of the market, and F G and H cannot effectively enter the market because they don't have the capital to compete with A and D, and the quality of their product won't come close without that capital. \n\nCAPITALism is all about acquiring CAPITAL. The market may be free, but that doesn't mean it's in any way open. \n\nInterestingly enough, want to know something that noone complains about? Water rates and electricity rates. Utilities are LITERALLY a handful regionally determined government granted monopolies. The main reason they work is because the government also sets the rates on utilities. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric wasn't handed an open monopoly on the SF Bay Area, they are given the monopoly but also given prices which they must charge their customers, which are adjusted (yearly I believe) to reflect the cost of providing the utility, along with (again, if I'm not mistaken on the number) a 6.5% growth allowance.\n\nDoes this not sound like a reasonable model for the internet? Does this not establish net neutrality? Let Comcast have the South, Google the West, Verizon the North and AT&amp;T the East. Fix the prices they charge customers for what has now become a utility just as common and nearly as essential as water, electricity, and gas. Allow them room for profit, and set rules on how they may tier their customers' access. \n\nThe companies remain entities separate from the government, so no worries about your internet traffic going through the NSA first, at least no more than there are currently. The companies, much like the utility companies, will provide usage statistics, be audited. When the need for infrastructure improvement arises, the companies get a notice that they must upgrade or lose the control on the region in question.\n\nSometimes, instead of trying to turn the tide on something that is clearly already firmly in place, we may want to embrace what has already happened and look to make it better. If telco companies are left the liberty of being able to charge content providers or customers extra, they will find ways to do so.\n\nUltimately, the ISPs are all providing Internet access. They are not different products. Sometimes free-market capitalism is not the best solution for the consumer, and that is when the government needs to step in and take control.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399173211", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Okay, here we go. I decided to stick with the Bebas Neue light minimal theme. [Heavily inspired by this](http://xniikk.deviantart.com/art/Ruby-339109124)\n\n**Lockscreen:**\n\nLockHTML 3 ($1.00) ModMYI. Good stuff, allows you to hide elements and place widgets. Better clock hider than CustomLS because it doesn't blink as much as CustomLS. It doesn't even show.\nIts frustrating to put the widget exactly in the middle though\n\nCustomLS (Free) BigBoss. Well, free is best. It does do the job pretty good but it has a few lacking points, like the one i pointed out. Sometimes it works while editing the \"slide to unlock\" text, sometimes it doesn't. Maybe because i got an iPhone 4.\n\nFlex 2 ($3.99) Can't say much about this really. I've done one patch that was with a tutorial because I don't know Objective C. It's not like HTML/CSS where I know a little just by looking at it. Can't really say much, but If you know Obj C then you can probably get your way with this. I only got it for the white statusbar, and pretty much that.\n\nSameStatus (Free) BigBoss. Makes the statusbar the same in ls as with hs.\n\n______\n \n**Homescreen:**\n\niWidgets (Free) ModMYI. Why wouldn't you want this? Easy to use. Could be smoother to use. But it's also up to the dev of the widget to make it customizable.\n\nWinterBoard (Free) System. Do I need to say anything? Used to apply\n\nClarity (Free) ModMYI. This is just plain amazing. It supports almost all the icons i expect it to, and it really quite fits in to my theme. Pastaal offwhite was also an option, but it didn't quite fit my taste for this setup. \n\nSpringtomize 3 ($2.99). BigBoss. Amazing tweak. If you don't have the money to put on Cloaky, LockHTML 3 etc. for \"Best in Slot\" Tweaks, this is a godly tweak to have. I've tweaked; Disable Spotlight and Page dots, Pinch to close Folders, set the number of icons in dock to 10 (so it shoves the whole 4 icons i use to the left), resize icons in dock to 55%, hide background on dock and hide labels.  It's quite a lot for its moneys worth, really. \n\nFolderEnhancer ($0.99) BigBoss. Amazing. Nested folders without many noticable flaws, 3x4 folders, folder icon stuff. Plus, Compatible with Barrel and Infinifolder. \n\nFolderIcons (Free) Bigboss. Hella buggy on about any device, but I got it to work by a guy on reddit. [Here's the guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1zg2av/minimally_mint_latest_setup/cftgc80)\n\n_________\n\n**CC:**\n\nCCControls (Free) ModMyi. Customize your CC.\n\nUniformity (Free) repo.pnre.co (god ive typed that so many times i remember it in my head now) Customize the colors further. Tint Opacity 0.30, Disabled toggle opacity at 0.08, Darkening view opacity at 0.20. Rest at 1. Grabber style - Tint Color, Tint color - Amethyst. Normal color - F7F7F7, Highlight - Amethyst, Tint color - Amethyst.\n\n__________\n\n**Persistent:**\n\nCloaky ($0.99) BigBoss. Hide items I dont need to get a cleaner status bar? Hell yeah. Time Format hh | mm, Hide everything except Time, Airplane mode, DataNetwork, everything with battery and bluetooth. Also hide stuff on the CC. Media Controls (on when music app is ready), Airstuff, Quicklaunch and separator. \n\nAlkaline (Free) ModMyi. Used to apply\n\nI I I I I Status Bar (Free) http://andreaslarsen.dk/statusbar/ (Browser, previews and repo name there.) Great theme.\n\n______________\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nInstaLauncher ($1.99) BigBoss. Amazing when you have everything stuffed in a folder. \n\nPurge (Free) BigBoss. Hold to close all apps at once. Compatible with\n\nGridSwitcher ($1.50) BigBoss. More efficient than the regular one. Didn't like the look of Auxo 2. \n\nStride 2 ($2.99) BigBoss. Draw your Passcode.\n\nI absolutely hate it on my iPhone 4. I know, it's not the dev's fault because I have an outdated chip, but it's clunky, buggy and often ends up with the strokes being black. It's supposed to feel smooth, but just about anything can break in. I have a cursive L I make in a certain way, but you can just write a 2 and youre fine. It's not worth it at the moment at all.

{"body": "This was ideal for me since I am already writing a story based on this. I have posted an excerpt here. Really hope you guys like it :(\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nP R O L O G U E\n\nBLACK AIR\n\nThat’s what they call it nowadays. There used to be technical names for it like “radioactive winds”, but as it became a standard aspect of everyday life the slang started to evolve. The Earth used to be a beautiful place, but that was long ago. My grandfather used to tell me about children gathering in huge facilities where they would play and learn from adults. Food was readily available on every corner. Can you imagine? People preparing fantastic meals and then giving them away in exchange for slices of paper. \n\nThe third nuclear weapon detonated in war made the first two look like sparklers. After that, the blast radius seemed to triple in size with every use. The world grew less and less steady until it degenerated into an endless warzone of proxy battles. Governments passed out hydrogen bombs like they were on sale. Men, in all their foolishness, felt complacent at the beginning. Just another horror story from a distant land. That is, until death was knocking at their doorsteps. \n\n8.5 billion Humans on a small, paradise planet known as Earth showered themselves in arrogance, enmity, and eventually nuclear fallout. It doesn’t matter anymore who struck first or what countries were fighting with whom. Before long there were just groups that everyone fell into, and whichever one you belonged to you had to fight for, even die, or else you didn’t stand a chance regardless. A lot changed then. Done was the time when people used to mass-murder for politics and natural resources. You see, when that fad died out, war again -- like in the medieval ages -- became theologically driven. As they say: History repeats itself. \n\n“The Mission” had its roots as a small band of Christian fundamentalists. Everyone, including most Christians, thought they were just like any other typical cult of religious nuts who liked to stir up trouble to get their message across, but before anyone knew it they were barging into people’s residences waving guns in petrified faces. The bigger they got, the more distantly they veered from their stated objective; that being to spread the word of whom they called Christ. As they grew in numbers through guerilla warfare tactics and conquest, they slowly began to lose sight of their original intentions and became a ruthless and bloodthirsty brigade of maniacs. They were intent on one thing - establishing rule, united in the cause of bringing ‘justice’ to mankind by freeing it from its mortal coil. The “Missionaries” took cities by storm, leaving a desolate ocean of fire and blood in their paths. In a matter of a few short years they had conquered America and turned the presidential cabinet into figureheads. \n\nOnce they had a fully-mobilized military force with land, air, and sea support, they wasted no time in developing the weapons that would come to put the idea of stability in the past. Nations toppled like so many dominoes, regimes replaced by a simple but wrathful code: The world outside of their governance was filled with only chaos and hedonism; hence anything that wasn’t the Mission was the Missionary’s plaything. It no longer mattered what your race, color or creed was. They even executed members of their own faith, seeking any excuse to label them lost souls. Suitable women and girls became concubines, useful men and boys became slaves, and everything else died. \n\nThe Mission had quite a wide array of killing machines; some of them as small as a bicycle, and others that made your heart sink -- mechs that stretched across the horizon. \n\nAmongst that era’s various extermination tools, the most celebrated build is the Stallion. Much like a prize horse, they are fast and elegant. Bigger is not always better, no pun intended. Comparatively, you could say one of these war birds is roughly the size of a sedan from the early 2000s. An ionocraft, it has a triangular-shaped exterior design with a highly-efficient conduction engine. By manipulating ion winds, or something like that, it fought Newton’s forces with ease. If only man were as smart as he was educated. \n\nThe Mission built their devices with covertness in mind, as their armies tended to move in stealth formations and kill from a distance. Most people didn’t even know a threat was present until their loved ones were turned into ash and bones. The Stallion is untraceable. She shines no lights, makes no noise, and leaves practically no evidence behind, and she comes equipped with shielding for all types of wavelengths. You can’t find her on any kind of standard tracking equipment like radar and infrared. In other words, you could have a Stallion in your house, killing your family while you’re on the toilet and not even know until it finds you. The only sign that it leaves behind is a triangular imprint from the landing leg, a “Gallop Mark”, and if the pilot was dumb enough to anchor in an open field he probably wasn’t a Missionary anyway. \n\nThe world found hope again in the Builder’s League, a rebel force cultivated in the underbelly of devastation. You didn’t have to be qualified to join and you didn’t need a degree. All you required was to prefer death over a life of utter misery. In other words: Everyone was eligible. The Builder’s League knew they didn’t stand a chance against the Mission weaponry, so before going at the Mission head-on they began to lay siege of armories and stash houses, intercepting and rehashing their enemy’s technology. Once the odds were at least partially matched, the Mission finally started to give way. A pyrrhic victory at best. The fertile soil didn’t stand a chance as the last remaining contingents battled for the supremacy of a dead planet. The nukes poured like rain drops, wiping everything off the map and making eighty-six percent of the globe uninhabitable. \n\nMeanwhile, there was outer space – the unknown. It’s funny how strongly we value our lives and our possessions when you consider that we’re not even a speck in the vast expanse of the universe – not to mention our period of dominion as a sentient species is not even remotely significant in comparison to the length of time that our universe has existed. \n\nPerhaps it is key to note that at some point during all this, a group of humanitarian physicists were seeking an alternative to Earth. Now here is where history gets cloudy and mythology starts to take its course. Allegedly, these scientists found a way to manipulate the Higg’s field and created something called the “grav-engine”. By toying with gravity they found ways to travel insane distances in short time, successfully finding their way around what is today called the “Known Universe” (as opposed to the undiscovered). I have heard stories of how these heroic men and women, over the course of time, transported anywhere from ten to fifty million people with them into space to find a safe haven. I suppose the desperation of accepting that mankind was on a sinking ship had caused some to leap off the deck. If this was true then certainly nobody earthbound knew where these astronauts were going, only hearsay. \n\nSome say they found a new Earth, only better -- a perfect world to live on, away from all the destruction and warfare. Eden, they called it. The wilder iterations added that they were building intergalactic pit stops, like enormous gas stations and bars in space for refueling and recreational purposes. Even still, gossip spread about the treacheries of space travel; alien beasts, star pirates, diseases, and other terrors that no grounded mind could fathom. Most of us, including myself, were never concerned with it. \n\nEden-Runners. That was everyone’s favorite story, and many claimed to have met one. Keep in mind, earthlings are all refugees. None of us want to be there. So allegedly from the stars will come these brave philanthropists looking to save as many as they can. These masters of space travel have perfected the route to the refuge of planet Eden. It is said that they roam around on the surface of the Earth, picking up strays and gathering them into a group. This group is then led by the Eden Runner back to some earth-based cove of safety known as an “Oasis”, a fitting title seeing as how our world is an endless stretch of desert. Supposedly these Oases are scarce and few, but within them are the last docking bays that exist on this planet for space flight. Some of these “star-skippers”, whom we refer to as “Sayyids” (Leaders), supposedly go as far as to select a lucky few who win a golden ticket on their spacecraft and whom they will grant passage to Eden. Whether the spacefaring society was just a myth or a reality, it was of no benefit for me to know. Before I had learned it was all true, it was these stories that kept our minds off the barren, cultureless chaos we were stuck in -- a chalkboard erased.\n\nSo there I was, Lloyd Best, born to this. I, with the remaining three million scavengers, inherited that forsaken rock and all the nothing that came with it. We scoured the endless desert for whatever canned foods or dead animals we could find that hadn’t yet been contaminated. Among the countless dangers we struggled to avoid, the one that claims the most lives is radioactive winds, BLACK AIR, which covers much of the planet’s surface. Whoever walks in it never walks out. If you did so then I pity you. There is no turning back. Within minutes you’ll feel your entire body burning like a fire that doesn’t exhaust. After that comes the coughing of blood and the skin lesions. By an hour’s time your flesh will be falling off your bones, fluids leaking from every orifice. Don’t expect anyone to find your corpse. Nobody’s ever getting that close without ending up beside it.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399228912", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not a long form chord progression, but a fun way to expand diatonics or even bend them if you put them in weird places:  \n\nSomething fun to do that is relatively simple is to add a Major 6th to a minor chord or a #11 to a Major chord. These imply a dorian (ii) value to the minor, which Pink Floyd does with their melodies over minor chords all the time, and a Lydian (IV) value to the Major, so it'd be less 'out' to stick those tensions to those chords in the key you're working with...so Am6 (A C E F#, or even add the G in there for a Minor 7th chord with the rub of the F# to G...maybe put them in different octaves if they rub too much for your application) and, in long form, Cmaj7/9#11 (C E G B D F#) You don't have to add the extra notes...like the 7 and 9 to the C chord, just makes it a bit more flavorful.  \n\nA cool way to realize a Maj7#11 chord is to play any given major triad and then have someone else (or you with a delay pedal, pedal tone, or something) play another major triad one whole step above. Meaning, play a C chord (C E G) and have someone else play a D chord at the same time. (D F# A) The notes in the D chord are the 9th, #11th, and 13th of the C chord. So, you're playing all the tensions on the C chord, in other words. This is especially easy to do on a piano.\n\nThis way your bass motion remains in the same key (or you can impose these chord 'values' onto minor/major chords where they don't usually belong and that can lead you to a new key before you V7 back home to G.     \n\nAnother quick idea is to use diminished chords. Put very simply, you can get away with adding a diminished chord in between any two diatonic chords that have a whole step between them. So, G major to A minor (I to ii) has space for a G#dim7 in between...and so on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399256071", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The expiration date of the constitution is whenever we fucking decide to end it. If tomorrow enough people decided they didn't want to live by it anymore it would be a worthless piece of history. America will exist as long as we use the letters A M E R I C A to call it America. You're clinging to symbols and memes to define yourself and your country that have nothing to do with it. If we abolish the consitution but stll call ourselves \"the united states of america\" then it will still exist. It will just have different laws.\n\n&gt;As to your point that \"laws only have power as we give them power\" I can only answer \"well, duh\". The very premise of America, from the Declaration of Independence on down, is that political power and the right to govern derives from the will of the governed. If in recent years we have abdicated this right to the wealthy and powerful it is our fault. We have been apathetic, we have failed to educate our children, we have resisted the excesses and incursions of the would be ruling class by fatuous and ineffective means. An effective political voice never uses the phrase \"hey hey, ho ho\".\n\nSo what this then implies is that constution in itself has no inherant powers. It's only powers are what we give. This means that if we decide not to give it power then it has none. So appealing to the consitution for your laws and morality is senseless. You must appeal to the morality of the issue itself.\n\n&gt; As for your hypothetical event where everyone in America decides to break the Constitution at once; you do realize that that would never, ever happen, right?\n\nYou do realize that's what the Romans said and what the English said about America and what the Germans said before the Nazis and what the Russians said before the dissolution of communism right? You are historically illiterate if you think America immuned to changes in it's government and way of life. By the way the constiution can and does change when we want to. It's already been changed exactly 27 times. So the hypothetical has already happened. It's a completly different document from when it started.\n\n&gt;responsibility for just and effective government lies with us. The Constitution puts our rights in our hands, but along with them come the responsibility of safeguarding and maintaining those rights. This doesn't require money, nor guns; it requires an engaged and educated populace that are willing to go to the polls and informed as to why\n\nJust? Rights? Who decides what your rights are? It's men with guns who have the man power to decide what your rights should be. We're lucky that those men with guns are in our favor for the most part. But those rights are in no way a given and are in no way universal.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399293507", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Change They Believe In\nSpeech for Harlem Tenants Association, November 14, 2008\nBy Robert Fitch\n\nNellie asks us to foretell what an Obama Administration is going to do for cities, housing and neighborhoods. Of course we can’t really know what’s going to happen in the future. We can only know what’s already happened. So it’s an exercise that reminds me a little of Johnny Carson’s old late night TV routine with his sidekick Ed McMahon. Carson played Karnak the Magnificent. McMahon would give him an answer. And Karnak, wearing a giant turban, and holding an envelope to his forehead, would guess the question inside the envelope. Ed would give an answer like. “A B C D E F G.” Karnak would reply with the question: “Earlier versions of Preparation H.”\nWhat’s President-elect Obama’s prescription for urban pains? I’m going to put on my urban turban and try to play Karnak. It’s a difficult role not only because the future is hard to predict; but because Obama himself is not easy to read. In my lifetime, we haven’t had a politician with his gifts: his writing talent; his eloquence; his charisma; his mastery of public policy; his ability to run a national campaign against formidable rivals. Obama projects so brilliant an aura that it’s almost blinding. He’s become the bearer of pride for forty-five million African Americans who want to be judged by the content of their character. He’s the prophet of hope; the apostle of change and the organizer of “Yes We Can.”\nAll this makes Obama’s actual politics very hard to put in any critical perspective. By actual politics I mean above all, the principal interests he represents; his authentic political philosophy. Where he fits on the Left-Right political spectrum. Obama resists being identified with either the Right or the Left. Even when he talks about his mom’s liberalism, it’s with a certain irony. “A lonely witness for secular humanism, a soldier for the New Deal, Peace Corps, position-paper liberalism.” Obama is a partisan of the Third Way. In Europe, the Third Way means you’re neither socialist nor capitalist. In the U.S. it means you’re neither for liberalism nor conservatism. The Third Way is expressed very well in Obama’s 2004 convention speech.\n“Well, I say…tonight, there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there’s the United States of America.\n“There’s not a black America and white America…there’s the United States of America.\n“The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue States: red states for Republicans, blue States for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them, too.\n“We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.”\nAre traditional political vocations now obsolete? The Left stands for the interests of those who have to work for a living; for the tenants and the poor. For the victims of discrimination. The Right in America stands for the interests of the employers and the investing class. For those who own the land, the houses, the banks and the hedge funds. For Joe the plumber who was really Joe the plumbing contractor. And for those who see themselves as the victims of affirmative action.\nIn a way, though, the Left and the Right have more in common with each other than they do with the advocates of the Third Way. The Left and the Right argue that different interests matter. The Third Way says they don’t. According to them, the oppressed and the oppressors, the lions and the lambs should set down together and celebrate their unity in one great post-partisan, multi-cultural 4th of July picnic. One of Obama’s most repeated mantras resonates here: “a common good and a higher interest,” he says. “That’s the change I’m looking for.”\nWhere in the world most of us reside do we find that higher interest? I don’t know except perhaps in the higher interest rates that kicked in with variable rate mortgages.\nWhat is the common good that tenants and landlords share? Not a lot I can think of. Maybe that the building doesn’t burn down? But some of you remember the ’70s when landlords burned down their buildings in poor neighborhoods to cash in on the insurance.\nThe haves and the have-nots have different and opposing interests—landlords want to get rid of rent stabilization; tenants have an interest in keeping it. Workers want to save their jobs; bosses want to save their capital, which means cutting workers. In pursuing their opposing interests, the have-nots are forced take up the weapons of the weak—demonstrations, direct action; filling the jails with conscientious objectors; taking personal risks. Who benefits when one side gives up without a struggle? The Have’s or the Have nots? Frederick Douglass reminds us: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did. It never will.”\nWhen the Third Way advocates insist that we share a common good; when they refuse to recognize that the interests of the oppressed and the interests of the oppressors don’t exist on the same moral plane; when they counsel us to stop being partisans of those interests—they’re not being non or post partisan; they’re siding with the powers that be.\nIn the same way, Obama’s notion of change claims to transcend the politics of interest while it steers sharply to the right. What kind of change does America need? Above all, America needs a change of heart: her people need to give up selfishness; all Americans rich and poor, white and black; the hod carrier and the hedge fund operator must give up self-interest; stop always asking “what’s in it for me?”\nIn a word, with his emphasis on change coming from people giving up group egoism and together pursuing the common good, while practicing old fashioned virtues, Senator Obama is a communitarian. In The Audacity of Hope he invokes the legacy of Ronald Reagan who, Obama believes, recognized America’s need to rediscover the traditional values of the American community: hard work, patriotism, personal responsibility, optimism and faith.\nCommunitarianism flows from belief that we all share a common good. What’s needed to achieve the common good, communitarians insist, is sacrifice. But some parts of the community have to show the way in giving up their selfish, anti-communitarian habits. For communitarians, the first responders must be the poor. For black communitarians like Bill Cosby and Barack Obama it’s chiefly the black poor.\nObama insists that the key to change is not resistance to oppression; not a battle against the exploitation of workers; or against institutional racism, or the domination of unaccountable financial elites; or the interests promoting gentrification.\nThese all fade away compared to the need for community self-help, strengthening the community by building strong families; by the need to convince the African American poor to pull up their socks. And stop engaging in anti-social behavior. Speaking recently to a group of black legislators, Obama said, “In Chicago, sometimes when I talk to the black chambers of commerce, I say, ‘You know what would be a good economic development plan for our community would be if we made sure folks weren’t throwing their garbage out of their cars.’”1\nIn fact, as Obama knows very well, for most of the last two decades in Chicago there’s been in place a very specific economic development plan. The plan was to make the South Side like the North Side. Which is the same kind of project as making the land north of Central Park like the land south of Central Park. The North Side is the area north of the Loop—Chicago’s midtown central business district—where rich white people live; they root for the Cubs. Their neighborhood is called the Gold Coast.\nFor almost a hundred years in Chicago blacks have lived on the South Side close to Chicago’s factories and slaughter houses. And Cellular Field, home of the White Sox. The area where they lived was called the Black Belt or Bronzeville—and it’s the largest concentration of African American people in the U.S.—nearly 600,000 people—about twice the size of Harlem.\nIn the 1950s, big swaths of urban renewal were ripped through the black belt, demolishing private housing on the south east side. The argument then was that the old low rise private housing was old and unsuitable. Black people needed to be housed in new, high-rise public housing which the city built just east of the Dan Ryan Expressway. The Administration of the Chicago Housing Authority was widely acclaimed as the most corrupt, racist and incompetent in America. Gradually only the poorest of the poor lived there. And in the 1980s, the argument began to be made that the public housing needed to be demolished and the people moved back into private housing.\nFor a while, the election of the city’s first black Mayor, Harold Washington, blocked the demolition. But Washington died of a heart attack while in office, and after a brief interregnum, the Mayor’s office was filled in 1989 by Richard M. Daley—whose father had carried out the first urban renewal. Daley was his father’s son in many ways. By 1993, with subsidies from the Clinton Administration’s HOPE VI program, the public housing units began to be destroyed. And by 2000 he’d put in place something called The Plan for Transformation. It targeted tens of thousands of remaining units. With this proviso: That African Americans had to get 50% of the action—white developers had to have black partners; there had to be black contractors. And Daley chose African Americans—as his top administrators and planners for the clearances, demolition and re-settlement. African Americans were prominent in developing and rehabbing the new housing for the refugees from the demolished projects—who were re-settled in communities to the south like Englewood, Roseland and Harvey.

{"body": "Linguistic enthusiast here. I freaking love stuff like this. Kudos for making it! If you're going for simplicity, I might be able to help make it even simpler.\n\nNote that these are suggestions and I am not emotionally invested in whether you take my advice or not. =P\n\n* You might want a U sound. Have all your monophthongs covered. Your initial vowel sounds will be \"Ah\" \"Eh\" \"Ee\" \"Oh\" and \"Ooh\" for A E I O and U. That way you can make diphthongs like \"I\" and \"You\" out of your monophthongs. (Ah-ee. Say it fast and you get \"I.\" \"Ee-yoo\" makes \"you.\") This is how it works in Japanese. Our \"I\" sound is actually \"ai.\" Fewer unique characters that way, and less variation in the way they're pronounced. I'm assuming you want it to be as simple and clear as possible. If possible, you want it to be like Japanese hiragana in that there is only one possible pronunciation for a given set of symbols.\n\n* In a similar vein, I suggest you use voiced and unvoiced consonants, and have them share a similar character. For instance, take \"S.\" \"S\" is possible to make without employing your vocal cords, making it an \"unvoiced\" consonant. \"Z\" is its voiced counterpart. You're putting a little less hiss into it, and \"humming\" as you pronounce it. Unvoiced / voiced pairs in your script are as follows: P/B; T/D; K/G; F/V.\n\nThere's a point to pointing this out... In Japanese (again with the Japanese, I know... but it's a phonetic written language and it's really great for this example), they have a specific character (\") for denoting voiced consonants. It's not 100% consistent, but if you put your \" above the symbol for \"sa\", it changes the unvoiced consonant to a voiced one, so \"sa\" becomes \"za.\" You could have a similar character (maybe just a pointy tool used to make a dot or hole) in your alphabet that would make a \"P\" a \"B\" and so on, almost halving the number of characters that your writers would have to remember.\n\n* Also included in English are the \"ch\" unvoiced and the \"j\" voiced, which are actually mutations of \"sh\" (ʃ) and \"ʒ\" (found almost never in English, but imagine the soft J in \"Jean\" as a French name; Jean-luc Picard). The only difference between the two pairs is that our \"ch\" sound is just \"sh\" with a \"t\" in front of it (sound it out: when my Linguistics professor pointed this out, it blew my mind), while our \"j\" (as in jug) is just \"ʒ\" with a \"d\" in front of it. If you want those sounds in your language, you might want to have dedicated characters for them (\"Ch\" and \"Sh,\" and have them able to be modified by the \"voiced\" symbol I mentioned above) so that you can keep the purity of having each character pronounced the same way.\n\nThese changes have the advantage of being easier to learn and remember, as well as cutting down on the clutter of the symbols, allowing it to be read faster at-a-glance and with more clarity. The beauty of this is that the writing could have been made by someone with a strong understanding of the language, but understood by everyone because it's designed to be intuitive.\n\nSource: 2 years Japanese, 2 years Spanish, native English speaker, took Linguistics in college and loved it so much I remember a lot of it to this day.\n\nLet me know if you like any of those ideas!\n\nEdit: Sorry for moving this around so much. I thought it was in the right place, then changed my mind, then changed my mind again.\n\nI'm going to try to get a moment to draw up what I mean about the voiced and unvoiced stuff.

This means that every distinct sequence of digits is present somewhere in its series of numbers. Now imagine any arbitrary way of organizing information. For example, suppose you want to store a l x m matrix in a medium; a very simple approach would be to find some way to store the l value, m value, and then all i=1...l and j=1...m values. This requires storage of l x m + 2 values, and space required to store this dataset will increase with proportion to the magnitude of l x m.\n\nSince pi is guaranteed to contain the sequence of numbers that you need, instead of storing l x m values + 2 you could instead store the values l, m, two indicies into pi which contain the series of values you want, and some encoding value. Then when you need to remove your matrix from storage you just need to know l and m to create the matrix, then start pulling raw values out of pi's series of values, starting from your start index and ending at your end index.

If you aim for the zombie's head you will kill them much faster, even with the baseball bat, which incidentally is now the easiest way to kill a zombie (probably due to the fact the swinging arc of the baseball bat is much more linear and accurate).

{"body": "Since we're stepping into this realm of meta... can I ask if \"new-age woowoo\" came from Deepak Chopra? I've never heard anybody else use the phrase. And if that's the case, it makes me do the exact same thing with your comment that you're doing with the article in question. Because that guy is seriously talking out of his anus. It's almost infuriating the way he abuses technical terms with hard definitions. Like his use of \"quantum physics\" in his explanations when it's obvious he doesn't know very much about the subject at all.\n\nTangent aside... I don't even know if I 100% agree with his sentiment. \"Pre-planned sets lack soul\" is such crap. I agree with \"pre-planned sets lack impulse\" but since when was impulse ever a universally good thing?\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't learn your music and practice mixing off the cuff... it's a great skill to have. But if you play a show and your pre-planned set happens to smash it all night, what's wrong with that? Why not use _both_ techniques? Pre-plan your set but have the ability to swap out or change directions at will.\n\nThe way I pre-plan my pre-planned sets is exactly that. I basically will come up with a playlist with a general order of tracks, but while making that playlist I come up with deviations of the playlist... and I mark certain sections as \"skippable\". Meaning that I could go track A B C D E F, or I could go A B E F, if it seems like the crowd is already pumped up. And then I also like to place \"forks\" in my playlist where I can choose one direction or another to go. The opening of my mix might be a set of 6 tracks but from there I can either play one set of 5 tracks or another set of 5 tracks...depending on how I read the crowd.\n\nThe end result is that my mixes tend to be a _lot_ more polished than if I were just improving the entire thing, but I'm still flexible enough that I can accommodate for an over-enthusiastic crowd, an under-enthusiastic crowd, a crowd who takes a longer time to warm up...etc. And if my set just isn't doing it no matter what I try... I can always back spin and switch it up entirely and go with improv at that point.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399404434", "subreddit": "DJs", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "I think the EG style of play is extremely interesting.  My friend and I were talking about why its successful the other day.  We have often seen teams overly commit to shutting down Arteezy, especially when he is on one of his signatures like Shadow Fiend or Siren.  Teams will kill him, a lot.  The mentality is \"if RTZ gets farm, we are going to lose\", so they crush his farm.  But then you have Mason (or Fear during S A D B O Y S) farming up on a Mirana or another semi-carry who then starts crushing them because he was given all this space.  Having 2 (or even more) cores isn't to have this unstoppable late game team, its to force the enemy to decide who to shut down the most.  If you split, and try to gank both RTZ and Mason in an alternating fashion, you're just going to end up opening the other person up to farm.\n\nI think Na'vi has sort of been doing a similar thing recently, or at least been toying with it.  A few times, they've run Funn1k offlane in a Mirana or Ember role with Dendi on a less farm heavy hero, and XBOCT on whatever XBOCT is playing.  Yeah, you can shut down 1 of them effectively, but all 3?  How do you stop everyone from farming at once?\n\nEDIT:  Even Fnatic/Liquid have been doing similar things.  With Era and TC playing \"softer\" carries like Slardar, and having H4nni/Qoyjva playing another semi-carry/farm heavy mid.  I think its opening up a lot of options for teams that don't have a carry player like Burning, that they can 100% rely on late game.  I definitely think Era and TC are solid carries, but they aren't Burning, and so they need to play a hero with farm priority, but still have the late game assistance that Shadow Fiend or Siren can provide.\n\nMaybe this all stems from the fact that its HARD to create enough space, long enough that an AM or Void needs to farm.  Even when Na'Vi picked Void yesterday against Fnatic, XBOCT played more of an \"initiation/cc\" role with Agh's and Shiva's rather than traditional carry items, while Dendi went hard carry tinker (~~I can't recall what Funn1k played, but I feel like it was a semi-carry, maybe Mirana?~~  It was Tusk!).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399486738", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

This works with the second digit to determine whether it attacks the defending card's third digit (physical defense) or their fourth digit (magic defense). If the second digit is P, then your first digit (attack power) will attack your opponent's third digit (physical defense). If it's M, then your first digit will attack your opponent's fourth digit.\n\nNow, if the second digit is X, then your card will attack whichever one of the third or fourth digits is a lower number.

And MDMA is no exception to that nonononono *wave of the finger* no sirree bob it is no exception.  You are gonna have a blast--almost... almost literally possibly.  Hahaha!\n\nSo you *will* be fine, but there are a few things to keep in mind.  \n\n#1:  Where did you get it from?  Unless you're on vaycay in a city you don't know or at a music festival across the border and you're desperate to get your hands on something, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS get from a reliable source.  Get from someone that a very good friend, or co-worker or classmate you've known for A LONG TIME, has been going to.  This cuts down any bunk shit possibilities by nearly 100%.  But it's rare people get bunk shit.  Anyway...  \n\n#2  TAKE, ONE!  Take 1 to start, and honestly, that's all you'll probably need for your first several times, let alone your first.  And by \"times\", a weekend can count as a \"time\".  Try to space out doing it by several months though, even a year if possible.  If you can't, I understand.  Ho ho, trust me, I understand.  But seriously, I would say MINIMUM wait time is a month.  Also, if you end up adding it to your repertoire of recreational use, begin taking multi-vitamins daily if you don't already.  This helps rebuild.. serotonin? (someone correct me if I'm wrong), and will help reduce the need to popping more in the future to garner the same effect.  But again, nothing replaces getting the same effect like more time off of it.  \n\n#3  STAY HYDRATED AND COOL!  WATER! WATER! WATER! WATER! WATER! JESUS FUCK WATER!  AND STAY COOL!  When I'm at a festival, I always have a water bottle handy.  When it's close to done, I fill up it up again, and keep it shoved in my pocket.  I go to the bathroom every half hour haha.  Sure, this is very conservative.  But guess what, if you die--FUCK YOU.  Hahahahhahaha--no but like actually fuck you.  I have done, A LOT, OF DRUGS, in my day.  And one thing is for sure.  I know enough to know, nobody, NOBODY, goes from THIS IS THE GREATEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE to--flatlined, in 5 minutes.  Nobody.  Listen to your body.  Your body will tell you e v e r y god damn thing you need to know.  Not trying to alarm you, again, you will be fiiiiine.  Just take all the necessary precautions so your friends don't have to look after you.  Not that that's a problem, we all have to call it a night a few nights in our lives to look after a friend, but you'd always rather NOT have to pull that card out.  More so for yourself.  Feeling like shit is not fun.  If you feel somethings off, you need water, you need air, you need to sit down, you need to puke, you need to go home.  Whatever it goddamn is your body and then your gut is telling you to do--YOU FUCKING DO IT.  Not \"oh man but this chick hottest tattoos and piercings is feeling me she's gonna fuck my brains out I can't leave now\".  That's how people fuck up.  They push the limit.  Something's wrong, you correct it right away, up to AND INCLUDING calling it a night.  Doing drugs is like driving.  You ALWAYS take the safest option.

All you gotta do is one thing.  Realize you're alive, you're well, you're out with friends, and you're having a good time.  If the night isn't close to over, drink some booze to keep you inebriated. (PS you can drink while on Molly, just if you do, then DEEEEFINITELY upkeep your water intake).  But don't let it get to you 'cause then you'll feel bummed out, and that's not the goal.  You can't feel like that forever right?  It is what it is.  Truthfully, now that I think about it, curbing it off with alcohol is a good idea.  Just, you know... don't over drink, and keep on that water.\n\nThat's it I guess.\n\nOtherwise, dude... have fun.

I think the profile could use a little work.  I'd look to shorten the bullets on the profile.  That's not the place you want to be long-winded.  For example, your third bullet could simply be \"Self-managing, organized individual contributor\" (You also want to modify this part if you're applying for a job with a strong team component, since that could hurt you).\n\nI think the format would look much better if you'd change the font.  I find this one difficult to read and a little old-timey.  If you change to a modern sans-serif web-friendly font, I think this will seem more up to date and easier to read.  I also don't like the huge spacing for things like P R O F I L E.  I just don't find that kind of thing easy to read, and if it's not helping me get hired I don't want it in my resume.\n\nBut mostly this is good.  Oh, I'd also recommend getting rid of professional development.  I mean, it's an entire section dedicated to you taking an excel course?

I just don't feel like going through and editing it all.\n\nHave you read Dr. Lisa Pierson's articles on feline nutrition? http://www.catinfo.org/\n\nShe addresses the concerns that not all proteins are created equally. There are some comments saying plant-proteins are sufficient. There is a short version if you haven't seen the website/report before. What is your opinion on Pierson's findings?\n\nThere are some other sources that, if you haven't seen them already, you may want to look into. I'd love to hear what you think about them too!\n\n[Plantinga et al. 2011. Estimation of the dietary nutrient profile of free-roaming feral cats: possible implications for nutrition of domestic cats, British Journal of Nutrition / Volume 106 / Supplement S1 / October 2011, pp S35-S48](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8404219). (Full Report Available for free).\n\n\"When cats do not have access to human garbage, they naturally consume a diet that is composed 100% of prey animals. Not corn, not wheat, not vegetables, not grasses, barley, oats.... Even eating the stomach and intestines of prey results in a carb content (NFE) of just 2.8% on a dry matter basis (and 2% on an energy basis). For cats, from a macronutrient perspective, their diet is 62.7% protein, 22.8% fat, 11.8% ash and, as already pointed out, just 2.8% \"carbs.\"\" (Dry matter basis)\n\nThis is also confirmed by an (earlier) Waltham study: http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/6/1039.full#R22\n\n\nIt's difficult to feed a cat their evolutionary diet using grains. Unless, of course, they're being broken down into their components. But humans thrive on diets that include fresh foods. I'm not sure why we expect our pets to thrive on such highly processed foods. In fact - they're not.\n\n- [59% of cats are now overweight or obese](http://www.petobesityprevention.org/2012-national-pet-obesity-survey-results/) and this problem is at \"epidemic levels;\" so it isn't surprising that with that extra weight, according to http://www.stateofpethealth.com/Content/pdf/Banfield-State-of-Pet-Health-Report_2013.pdf\n\n- 67% of cats have arthritis; or that\n- Incidence of diabetes have DOUBLED in the past five years;\n- 85% of cats over the age of 3 years have dental disease (and with kibble being the predominant food fed, I think that puts to rest the notion that kibble is good for cats' teeth);\n- Kidney disease is 7x more common in cats than dogs; and\n- according to VPI Insurance, digestive issues have ranked as one of the top two reasons for a vet visit seven out of the last nine years.\n\nUSDA facilities are where animals meant for human consumption are slaughtered. According to the USDA, \"30 percent of the liveweight of hogs and about 44 percent of the liveweight of cattle\" cannot be used in human food consumption. This stuff goes to the rendering plant. But it is NOT just \"leftovers\" from human food consumption that are rendered.\n\nFrom a 2011 USDA report:\n\n\"Some inedible offal, along with normally edible offal that has been deemed unsuitable for human consumption, bones from meat processing, and cattle that are unsuitable for human consumption (nonambulatory and other condemned cattle), is rendered for use in the industrial, cosmetic, and feed manufacturing industries.\" (Pet foods and animal feed are the SAME REGULATIONS).\n\nSorry - it directly opens the PDF, so it's the google link: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ers.usda.gov%2FersDownloadHandler.ashx%3Ffile%3D%2Fmedia%2F147867%2Fldpm20901.pdf&amp;ei=MsZrU_aINIrTsASzlYBY&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUyJRVRZJxBq0s-DCKIJiZwx3Abw&amp;sig2=vEkqtB7Mfn4j80tFJTkz6A&amp;bvm=bv.66111022,d.cWc\n\nInterestingly, data from 1990 indicate that 27% of renderers own pet food facilities: (p 5) http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergingissues/downloads/render.pdf The report was conducted based on BSE/Scrapie concerns, but has some interesting info.\n\n\"Feed manufacturers reported the animal source for 124 different dairy feed products. Sixty-six ( 53 p e r c e n t ) of the feed products contained MBM/MBP from unknown animal sources and from manufacturers that do not exclude any species.\" (This is animal feed, not pet food). (Same report)\n\nAnd the discussion of dead sheep vs slaughtered sheep in that report, again, makes it clear that 4D animals are a part of the rendering output.\n\nLet's face it: Del Monte's 9Lives Daily Essentials Dry food that costs $1 a pound is not going to be the same stuff as Newman's Own Organics adult dry at $4.31 a pound.

Place the bridge pin in, groove aligned with the string until it is snug, but do not apply any pressure. Holding the pin in place, tug the string gently until the ball of the string stops you. You may now insert the pin fully, and give a gentle tug on the string, still holding the pin in place. \n\n3. Run the string the length of the neck to the tuning post.  Insert the string into the tuning post(which should be perpendicular to the length of the neck) and pull until the string, while saddled in the nut, has a small loop extending to the opposite post. Take the loose end of your string, loop it clockwise around the post(facing the guitar) and back under itself. Then pull the string back over itself to form a hook in the string(you want to put a kink in the string, no need to fret, pun intended). You may now wind the string clockwise around the post. Turn the post counter-clockwise while holding the string taught with your thumb against the headstock. Tune to a low C. If you don't own wire cutters you can wrap the loose end of the string back and forth around the post to snap it off. Otherwise, snip snip to get it out of your way. \n\n4. Repeat those steps with remaining strings in the following order: e A B D G this keeps the strings from getting in eachother way while you're working by moving front to back. Assuming you have 3 tuners on each side, the order E A D e B G would also be efficient. It is also important to note, that all rotational directions are inverted for the tuners on the bottom of your headstock. Also, your final tuning at this stage should be C F Bb Eb G c\n\n5. You may now tune your guitar. The reason I tune first to standard a third down, is to avoid shifting the tension of the neck rapidly.\n\n6. If you wish, you may now gently tug with two fingers, directly upwards on each string to see if they lose pitch. Try and tug from about the 12th fret to avoid unsaddeling the strings or pulling your bridge pins out.  If they do lose pitch retune and repeat this process until the strings stop losing pitch. I find this step unnecessary if you have saddled your strings well, and kept them taught while winding. \n\nCongratulations, your guitar is now clean, re-strung, and shouldn't lose pitch because you either did it right the first time, or worked it out at the end.

{"body": "There is no such thing as a \"decimal prime\" or \"hexadecimal prime\". I am gonna use a perhaps strange analogy to explain my point.    \n\n\nIf I only look at sequence of letters, the two sequences \"y e l l o w\" and \"j a u n e\" do not have much in common. However, if I interpret the first sequence of letters as an english word, and the second sequence of letters as a french word, then these two apparently different things now represent the same concept, the same color.\n\nAs you probably know, the color that is represented by the english word \"yellow\" is a primary color. The fact that this color is primary has nothing to do with the sequence of letters \"y e l l o w\".  The color which is called \"jaune\" in french has exactly the same properties, because it is exactly the same color ! In other words, the fact that a color is primary has nothing to do with the languages I use.\n\nAre you still with me ? Good. Now back to numbers.\n\nThe two sequences of symbols \"47\" and \"2F\" do not have much in common. However, if I interpret the first sequence of symbols as a number written in decimal notation, and the second sequence as a number written in hexadecimal notation, then those two seemingly unrelated sequences of symbols now represent the same thing, the same number ! \n\nJust like french and english, decimal and hexadecimal are just two languages that give a meaning to certain sequences of symbols.\n\nSo the number that is represented as \"47\" in decimal notation is prime. It means that it cannot be divided by any number other than one and itself. But as you probably understood, the number that is represented as \"2F\" in hexadecimal is also prime because it is exactly the same number. **The primality of a number is something that depends on the value of the number, not on the particular sequence of symbols that I use to represent it.**\n\nI could write the same number in roman numerals as \"XLVII\". As it is the same number, it has exactly the same properties.\n\n\nNow, perhaps what could be a little bit confusing in this story, is that the sequence of symbols \"47\" can be read both in decimal notation but also in hexadecimal notation. But you have to understand that if you do that, you are now considering two very different numbers. And there is no reason that these two numbers share any property. To continue with my analogy, the sequence of letters \"b i t e\" can be read both in french or in english. But it means two very different things ! \n\n\nTL;DR : A number is prime whatever language I use to write it.

If you are unfamiliar with the new Mac Pro line, there are quite a few combinations of options that can produce a range of prices from $2999 to nearly $10,000. \n\nCurrently there are only TWO \"Stock\" configurations: $2999 gets you a Quad Core Xeon with dual D300 GPUs, 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of Solid State Storage $3999 gets you a Six Core Xeon with dual D500 GPUs , 16 GB of RAM and the same 256 GB of Solid State Storage. This is truly the \"Goldilocks\" configuration... the middle of the road. In a custom configuration, which you can only get directly from Apple (which takes time), each of those components can be upgraded, however only some can be \"User Upgraded\", so you must be aware of that when you buy, because you will not likely change them later. \n\nHere are the things you CAN upgrade AFTER you purchase: \n\n1. RAM - You can upgrade the RAM on all models, from 12 GB all the way to 64. There are 4 card slots, however you can't mix chip sizes. So, if you buy the 12 GB model, it uses 3 cards of 4 GB each leaving 1 slot open, so you can upgrade it to 16 by adding one more card. If you want to increase it beyond that, you will be removing all of the 4GB cards, and replacing them with 8's or 16's. This means that the 16 GB model comes with 4 x 4 GB cards, so any increase in that configuration will involve getting rid of all 4 of the 4 GB cards and starting with 8's or 16s. I think it's a shame Apple doesn't start with 2 x 8GB cards, so you could keep your existing memory and add two more... or even better, if it had 1 x 16GB card, so you could add up to 3 more. Anyhow, with this base model, if you want to upgrade to 32 or 64 later, just be prepared to toss out the old. \n\n2. The Solid State Drive is upgradable too, however since this is new technology, it's not easy to find them right now. My guess is in a year or two, there will be plenty of third party SSDs out there. In particular OWC has already committed to making a line of Mac Pro friendly storage. \n\n3. The CPU... oddly IS upgradable, however you will not likely change this for a long time, because the Xeon chips in these models are super expensive. The top of the line 12 core that fits this socket costs well over $3000. In either case, it's nice to know you can. So in a year or two, you may be able to double your CPU cores for $1000 or less as chip prices drop. \n\n\nAmong things you can't change (easily). \n\n1. The Dual GPUs. The GPUs in this model technically are not soldered in, so although upgrades are potentially possible, I don't think there will be any third party upgrades on the horizon. So, if you think you need ultra-high end 3D rendering or GPU intensive power for image processing or CAD, get the GPU card you want from the start. You won't be able to change it. They don't have a \"Stock\" configuration with the top of the line GPUs, which are the D700s, but the \"Goldilocks\" configuration has the D500s, which are right in the middle, and they are super powerful. \n\nYears ago, that kind of horsepower could only be found in a super computer. Although some people consider the Mac Pro to be expensive, the reality is the GPUs alone are based upon existing cards which actually cost just as much as the entire computer. These are not the run of the mill graphic cards you would find in a typical gaming computer.  \n\n\n-------&gt; Apple Breaks New Ground Again with PCI Express SSD Storage In New Mac Pro and MacBook Air \nWednesday, June 12, 2013 - by Seth Colaner \n\nWe’ve been critical of Apple recently for being frustratingly stagnant in terms of innovation (at least with handsets), and while it’s still debatable whether the iOS 7 and Mac OS X Maverick updates are worth getting excited about, Apple’s forthcoming Mac Pro certainly piques our collective interest; it portends some of that industrial design meets superb engineering, meets high-end features flair that we haven’t seen from Apple much lately. \n\nThere’s of course the obvious fact that the Mac Pro is built as a cylinder with all the components facing inward as opposed to the big rectangular box style of most computer chassis. Presumably, this facilitates heat dissipation (we’ll need to get this cylindrical wonder tested out ourselves before we can believe that for sure), but in any case, it’s a clever way to pack a lot of powerful components into a small space. Apple Mac Pro Among the other extremely high-end components in the Mac Pro, including the 12-core Intel Xeon processor and dual AMD FirePro GPUs, there’s one that stands out: the machine’s PCIe-attached flash storage. \n\nPCIe-attached storage is so much more robust because it’s a runs on a \"native\" interface and offers direct-attached performance. Most SSDs rely on a bridged interface such as SATA or SAS, which pose a performance bottleneck for the actual storage media since signals have to be translated from SATA to PCI Express and back again. \n\nWith PCIe, that bottleneck is no longer such a limiting factor. (It’s hard to imagine just how much this beautiful machine is going to cost by the way.) Apple also has PCIe-attached SSDs in the Macbook Airs it just announced. Performance-enhancing features like PCIe-attached storage is the kind of real innovation and strong design chops that Apple needs to get its groove back. Cheers to the Cupertino crew on this one and we challenge others to take note and possibly a page or two from Apple's playbook. \n\n\n------&gt; As of April 17, 2014 -- The Apple Mac Pro MD878LL/A Desktop is the most recent Mac Book Pro out there which means the quality will last you at least 8 years with thousands of dollars saved on tech support because you most likely won't need it if you're a beginner who wants something amazing for school that will last longer than a textbook, through grad school, and beyond.

{"body": "By the law of conservation of energy, total energy (TE)= potential energy(PE) + kinetic energy(KE). \n\nWhen the ball with mass 'm' is held up at a height 'h' over the ground, its total energy is equal to its potential energy and kinetic energy is zero : \n\n      TE = PE + KE\n=&gt;  TE = mxgxh + (1/2)mxv^2\n=&gt;  TE = m x g x h  ( because ball is at      rest and therefore velocity 'v' equals 0)\n\nWhere g is the acceleration due to gravity and has a value of 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nSo when the ball falls to the ground , only the 'h' part of the equation changes and the potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy. \n\n      Mgh = (1/2)mv^2\n=&gt;  v = (2gh)^(1/2)\n\nThis also leads to another interesting observation that velocity of a falling object does not depend on its mass (not considering drag due to air) . \n\n\nTL;DR - potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy. No change in mass. Object has potential energy by virtue of its position relative to the earth or observer.\n\nEdit : Also , weight and mass are two different things. While mass remains constant regardless of your position, weight changes because it depends on the acceleration due to gravity of the earth or any other heavenly body.\n\nWeight 'w' is essentially the force exerted by you on the ground.\n\nW = mass x acceleration = m x g.\n\nNow as you move away from the center of the earth, 'g'  decreases. \n\ng = g0 ( r/ (r+h))²\n\nWhere g0 = acceleration due to gravity near the earth's surface = 9.8m/s²,\n r = radius of earth,\nh = height of object above the surface of the earth.\n\nSo ,higher the object lesser its weight.\n    \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1399807570", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From what I've read so far, reactions are *extremely* mixed, so let me provide opinion that will pull the arguement in no discernable direction!\n\nOn first watching, I wasn't really too into it. I didn't mind the \"K I S S I N G\" part as much as some people did, but after further listens it's fine. The \"hands in the air\" part doesn't fit quite as well, but it adds a little character to the \"trap\" half of the song, so I'll give it that. I love, love, *love* the \"Kiss on ma lips\" part, though. \n\nAs someone who likes a good amount of story in my K-Pop MVs (like SNSD Gee levels of story, at least have *something* going on) I found this MV to be...*okay*. There's definitely something going on, but it's just kinda hard to put everything in a cohesive order. Not bad, though, I appreciate what little amount there is. \n\nThe \"trap-lullaby\" style mash-up went as well as I could have imagined. It's not an entirely graceful fusion, but like I said, I can't imagine what a smoother fusion would have sounded like. I love the gentle-lyrics-to-trap-beat thing. \n\nThe MV itself was good. I think the random shots on her cleavage are a bit gratuitous, but I they're few so, once again, I'll let it slide. I noticed that a lot of MVs are doing the Sistar Alone thing where it's just a person laying down all sexy-like with low lights and neon lights around them, which isn't all that bad but I just started noticing it a lot more. \n\nI feel like this is gonna be my favorite of the upcoming torrent of solo comebacks, honestly. Though I'm not as excited over it as I was for Jieun's last solo thing, but then again they're two wholly separate kinds of songs with different focuses and concepts so it's not really fair to compare. \n\nI'm gonna stop rambling before I end up talking myself in circles and end this here. Yeah! I'll give it a good 7 or 8 over 10 overall. Definitely good, could have been better. \n\nEdit: I can *totally* see the \"K I S S I N G\" part becoming crazy with fanchants as an addition.

in spite of his being a little bald \nintelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time \nhe was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a \nsplendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I \ndidnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on \naccount of her but I could have stopped it in time she \ngave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of \nWilkie

centuries \nof course they never came back and she didnt put her \naddress right on it either she may have noticed her wogger \npeople were always going away and we never I remember \nthat day with the waves and the boats with their high \nheads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers \nuniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say \nanything he was very serious I had the high buttoned \nboots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or \nseven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips \nwere taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous \nwrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the \nvoyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was \nextremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I \nwas almost planning to run

Build Janna Tanky/engage rather that full AP. Survival is key. \n\nAfter the not so recent changes to many supports being given AP scaling on their cc abilities, such as Janna's W, Zephyr giving a larger slow with more AP, many are building Mage supports. This isn't effective. You do not need to max AP to be the most effective support on Janna (Or idk, Lulu, I don't play her but she's another example), but simply having **any** AP is helpful.\n\nMy skill path: E W Q E E R W E E W R W W Q Q R Q Q\nAKA E &gt; R &gt; W &gt; Q\n\nMy core build:\n\nInitial buy:\nAncient Coin, 2 Biscuits of Rejuvenation, 1 Stealth (Green) Ward, Warding Totem (Yellow Trinket)\n\n- Talisman Of Ascension, for engaging, disengaging, and gold income. Always start Ancient Coin. \n I recommend not investing in anything else until you've upgraded your coin to Nomad's Medallion.  You always want to upgrade your gold item to it's maximum rank that you can afford so that your gold income starts snowballing as early as possible, so that you mean something later on.  If you have upgraded your coin to a Nomad's, and the decision falls on deciding between getting a Sightstone and a Forbidden Idol, I personally pick the Sightstone. If I can afford a Talisman but not a Sightstone with the Talisman, I take the Talisman and 2 green wards, get the Sightstone my next back. \n\n- Sightstone, essential for any support. Should be rushed after upgrading the base gold item if possible.\n I don't always upgrade my Warding Totem to a Sweeping Lens when I get a sightstone, but usually only because I forget; Always try to do it. I will say that having the extra 60 second ward definitely doesn't hurt as it gives you a 'throwaway' ward. Temporary vision of an area, baiting the enemy into going out of position/using their red trinket/using a pink?. Always upgrade to Ruby as soon as you can. No matter what anyone tells you, having that extra health and extra ward means you can stay on Rift longer, without having to recall as often.\n\n- Athene's Unholy Grail, this will cap off CDR vs Ability Power Heavy comps. \nI consider this item absolutely core on Janna, as it offers her Ability Power, Cool Down Reduction, and a glorious amount of mana regeneration.\n\n- Rylai's Crystal Scepter, gives you a good chunk of health as well as AP, as well as a totally awesome slow when one deals magic damage while equipping it.\nThis is my most recent addition to my build (I never would have dreamed of building anything but wards last season). I love this item because it basically gives my Howling Gale the same effect as my Zephyr, but applicable to a group of enemies. It also increases the potency of Zephyr in that it increases your ability power, giving Zephyr more power on it's base slow, as well as giving the slow from Rylai's itself. It's pretty good.\n\n- Ohmwrecker, gives you AP, HP, and the ability to turn enemy towers off for 2 seconds\nThis is another item that should really be built when your team is so far ahead that it doesn't matter. Ohmwrecker to me is HILARIOUS. I love tower diving in general so being able to turn the tower off for 2 seconds, well, kinda turns me on. I get this item whenever I can. \n\nMore situation-based items:\n\n- Frozen Heart, this will cap off CDR vs Auto Attack/Attack Speed heavy comps.\nThis is good if they have a Jax or a Yi, or against champs like Vayne, Varus, and Twitch where your ADC will need a faster attack speed in trades to come out on top. Frozen Heart provides a really awesome aura, the aura slows all enemy attack speed around you. Compare this to Randuin's, another great item, which requires that the wearer be struck to cause the same effect. \n\n- Randuin's Omen, this offers a large amount of Health and Armor but is quite expensive.\nPretty much only time I get this is if I'm getting focused REALLY hard AND if I can afford it. It's 3000 gold. If I don't get this early it never pays off. This item has an activated ability which slows all enemies in a small radius around you. Using this before using your ultimate to get a group off you is a great technique for teaching people not to mess with you!\n\n- Locket Of The Iron Solari, Aegis Of The Legion, offers magic resist, 10% cooldown reduction, and health.\nThis item also has an activated ability. It gives allies within range a really decent shield. I rarely build this anymore, but if I do it's because their team has a large amount of AP champs, my team is getting burst down, or I need a way for my team to come out on top in teamfights. I've found that if my team has an Aegis or Locket and theirs doesn't, my team wins teamfights. Just a personal observation. \n- PS I really miss Runic Bulwark.\n\nBoots:\n\nI always choose between any of these four:\n\n- Boots of Mobility, for when you're ahead and want to stay ahead. Can't kill what you can't catch, and these boots pair so so so well with Janna's passive. \nThese boots should be a standard rush anytime you are ahead on any support. They help you ward safely, they help you get back to lane VERY quickly so that you can *PROTECT YOUR CARRY.* Again, these are for when you're so far ahead it doesn't matter.\n\n- Ionion Boots of Lucidity, for when you're losing trades because your abilities are coming off Cooldown just a second too late.\nI find that sometimes I'll be in a match, early, and I will literally only lose trades because my shield had 1 second left on Cooldown. I generally build Ionion boots in that situation. If you get these boots and a Talisman you will be at max CDR, provided you optimized your masteries correctly.  These are for when you get behind but know that you can win trades/come back. I've found that getting these helps me get items like Rylai's and Randuins, rather expensive items for a support, simply because I am more often than not able to help earn that shutdown gold because my cooldowns are more up to par.  Even getting these before you get your Idol/Talisman will greatly improve your trading potential if you're in that situation.\n\n- Mercury's Treads, for when mid fed or when they have a high CC team. \nTenacity reduced crowd control effects on you.\n\n- Ninja Tabi, same as Merc Treads but for an Attack Damage situation.\n\nAs you can see, I like building my supports tanky, even on Janna. I used to play a lot of Taric and when I switched over to Janna I loved building items like Runic Bulwark and Mercury's Treads etc on her, so I just started playing her as a support tank like Leona or Taric. I'm not sure how many other people do the same but I gotta say I enjoy the playstyle. Good luck on the Rift, I hope this helps.\n\nI'm still a new player so some of the suggestions here might seem questionable, etc, but I have the most time on Janna out of any other champ. I'm more than happy to converse and share ideas about Janna.\n\nE: I really suck at formatting on Reddit, if anyone could help me clean this post up I'd appreciate it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400007316", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Classical guy here.  Grew up playing nothing but classical, but in the past few years, I've been learning some other stuff here and there.  \n\nFor me, improv (well all music, tbh) is about knowing the theory behind the music.  Are you playing solo, or with people?  First, know that you'll play differently in those situations.  As a soloist, you'll have to come up with left hand voicings/comp pattern with a bassline.  If you're playing with a bass player, you need voicings without the root (fucking weird, right??).  \n\nYou need to know extension chords (pretty much chords but with numbers assigned to notes outside of the triad).  \n\nYou need to know which modes/scales work with the chords in the chord progression.  I'm guessing you can just spam the blues scales and it'll sound pretty cool, but you gotta learn them modes if you want to have multiple tools in your toolbox.  Plus I'm not really sure the blues scales would work for every jazz song, you know?  \n\nI don't practice this shit nearly as much as I should, but when I do work on a tune, I'll work on coming up with a left hand voicings first.  Then figure out what modes works for what (this one kicks my ass).  Then while playing the left hand voicings, I slowly play arpeggios and scales going up and down those chord progression.  \n\nOh, and try working on modes/scales in thirds and fourths, like if you're doing C major in thirds, you would do:\n\nC E D F E G F A G B A C B D C  going up.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400031027", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I find that I generally get more traction with Harper supporters when I outline the conversation differently. \n\nBetween the two of us, I think that his drug policy is stark raving lunacy and borders on incoherence. \n\nBut there are at least two reasons that my view is a non-starter, insofar as proper discourse is concerned. \n\nThe first reasons is that I'm finally being rational about a topic that I'm otherwise emotional about (I loathe the Harper Government policies), and while it's tempting to think that this would be a 'good' thing, it's more often than not just a jarring thing. This is to say, I'm tempted to blow \"Mr. Harper's drug policy is senseless\" into \"only a stupid or soulless human being would vote for Mr. Harper! Just look at his drug policy!\" where I should say \"I really think that drug addicts, Canadian taxpayers, and willing drug users would benefit from an about-face in Canadian drug policy. Moreover, this would be consistent with other policy changes that the Harper Government and opposition parties have put forward.\" \n\nThe second reason is sort of tricky, and that's that when you confront someone on something that they support, they're likely going to diminish the quality of your good arguments and augment the importance of any arguments you make that are either bad or that make them look good. You know that trick where you make someone think that an idea is theirs? (No, not **I N C E P T I O N**, more like 80s sitcoms where the husband is 'putting his foot down' by giving the wife what she wants). The thing that is always easier to recognise in others and always difficult to see in ourselves is that Humans Love To Be Right! even when there is no 'right' or 'wrong' and especially when the evidence points to their wrongness. \n\nSo instead, I try to think about it this way:\n\nFor sake of ease, let's pretend there are only two parties. The principles I'm outlining scale well.\n\nLet's say that I'm relatively likely to vote for a Liberal Candidate in my riding. While I generally support pro-choice thinking, I have more respect for the pro-life argument than a lot of my contemporaries (which is to say, I believe there are anti-abortionists who seek control and order, but I also believe there are pro-lifers who genuinely see the fetus as a human life, and thus while I tend to disagree with them, I agree it's defensible to protect human life...). Moreover, while I understand that Mr. Trudeau's new \"pro-choice only candidates\" policy probably has some qualities of a good tactician, I think it's blatantly contrary to his earlier promise to have open discussions and more local control over candidates. Moreover, I think Andrew Coyne hit the nail square on the head: the debate is clearly not over - and while the \"side\" that I happen to support happens to be \"winning\" right now, I think that it's more important for discourse, debate, and deliberation to continue unimpeded at the Parliamentary level than it is for my \"side\" to \"win\" any particular battle. \n\nMoreover, Mr. Harper and Mr. Trudeau agree on, like, 85% (to draw a number from the sky) of everything [and, to cheat, the Tories and the NDP agree on, sure, 83%, fine]. You'll just never hear about it because the stuff they agree on isn't a big deal.\n\nOf the 15% that they disagree on, my personal stance might look something like this:\n\nOn 25% of the remaining issues, I agree with the Liberals' outlined policy more than I do the Cons.\n\nOn 20% of the remaining issues, I agree with the Conservatives' outlined policy more than I do the Libs.\n\nOn 30% of the remaining issues, I have no stance on the issues whatsoever.\n\nOn 10% of the remaining issues, I think both parties' policies are wrong.\n\nOn 15% of the remaining issues, I think both parties' policies are equally fine.\n\nOK so we have some wigglies because we think one runner will enshrine certain values better than the other, or we may be in a riding where we are unwilling to support the candidate of the party we happen to support and either cast a scratch ballot or (if the candidate is bad enough) vote for the party we'd rather not support. But in both cases we're getting some things right and some things wrong.\n\nSo, rather than trying to say that Mr. Trudeau is our new saviour and Mr. Harper is probably the devil himself, what I try to learn to do is say: I support the Liberals on A and the Conservatives on B.\n\n---\n\nThinking about this differently: I have a really hard time shopping at Wal-Mart.\n\nFor a long time I thought I hated Wal-Mart. But it's not Wal-Mart that I hate. I have nothing against the company, its shareholders, its customers, etc. I have five specific issues with Wal-Mart:\n\n1. They are big, ugly buildings, and I want to live in a beautiful city.\n\n2. They rarely, if ever, provide access from sidewalks, so pedestrians have to walk through big ugly parking lots, which discourages any kind of transportation except driving, and I want to live in a city where pedestrianism is specifically encouraged and driving is generally discouraged (in favour of better alternatives).\n\n3. I don't like the way that they rely on foreign workers, and I think that by allowing it we are encouraging a race-to-the-bottom approach to the economy which will eventually filter up to the \"first world.\"\n\n4. They tend to hurt local business.\n\n5. While not true across the board, a lot of the cheapness built into their product comes at a cost of quality and beauty. And I value quality and beauty over cheapness.\n\nThere are other policies I don't like, but you get the idea. The point is: if Wal-Mart changed these, then I'd be all for Wal-Mart. I love not spending money, I'm just willing to spend more to make the things I've listed not happen. But I also have to acknowledge that for all of my values, there are \"hidden\" values which I have and which Wal-Mart is good for. For one, local businesses aren't always the bastion of responsibility: I'd prefer a well-run local business to Wal-Mart, but Wal-Mart is probably more likely to deal with harassment, sexism, quality control, mice, etc. than a local business who has these problems systemically (yes, I'm aware that Wal-Mart has ongoing problems with sexism, etc., but while it's bad that it happens, it's good that we are collectively aware of it - are you aware of the pharmacist's view on promoting women?). Also, Wal-Mart is a big part of the reason that inflation during the early 2000s was held relatively in check. The recession of the late-2000s was bad, but it would've been worse if inflation had come before it. So there are things about the company that I have to acknowledge are reasonable, even if, in my head, it doesn't make it worth shopping there. \n\nPolitics should be the same way, and the only ones who benefit from polarisation, it seems to me, are the people who run for government. Stephen Harper is probably smarter than you and me combined. For all we know, he knows that his drug policy is irresponsible, economy-stifling, and backwards. But he'll never be able to admit it because we live in a country where his supporters will get confused and think that he's getting soft on crime, and his detractors will use his changing his mind in a positive way as a sure sign of his inability to lead. We must learn to change the tone of conversation if we are to move forward in any reasonable way. For my money, two great ways to do that are to understand that, all-things-considered, life is pretty good, and to allow ourselves to recognise that even the worst candidates have a lot of supportable ideas, and that all we need to do to get them to be tolerable leaders is to take on a few more supportable goals. While I think that Rob Ford, for example, is wildly off the mark, and I could probably not hold my nose long enough to vote for him, because I think that the way politicians hold themselves matter, he serves to make my point: what they do or believe hardly matters, all that really matters is the policies they implement and the effectiveness of the implementation.

{"body": "Improvising is just what it sounds like - making up melodies on the spot. First let me say a few things that will help to take care of some of the understandable anxieties that you are likely to be feeling right now.\n\n* You don't have to be technically perfect. Nobody is. Remember the old saying: if you make a mistake and stop, you've made two mistakes.\n\n* Don't be afraid to quote melodies you already know. This is a staple of many soloists in jazz. \n\n* Long, slow, legato phrases sound great on violin. Don't feel like you have to impress anyone by playing a million notes. \n\n* Most of all, remember that what will make it good for you and for everyone else is to make it like a conversation - listen, think about what your want to say, then say it and listen some more.\n\n\nNow for the more technical stuff. The good news is that \"So What\" is one of the easiest songs to improvise over. If you are playing it in A minor, then what you will be doing is improvising over the notes in the A Dorian mode for 16 bars, then in Bb Dorian for 8 bars, then back in A  Dorian again for 8 more bars. (form is AABA).\n\n\nJust in case you don't  know, the Dorian mode is the second diatonic mode of the major scale. So, for example, if you were to take the notes of the G major scale (G A B C D E F# G) and start and end on an A instead (A B C D E F# G A) you would be playing in the A Dorian mode.\n\n\nSo to start with, get comfortable with the notes in both the A and Bb Dorian modes. Then, practice making up little melodies using those notes - make sure you practice with a metronome. Then practice switching back and forth between them. These are all the skills you'll need to play this piece.\n\n\nIf you have any other questions, please feel free to PM me - I instruct improvisation to all levels and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400101820", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I also tried adding more notes but it does not seem to fit.\n\nThis is where a little basic music theory goes a long way. The easiest - and usually least interesting - thing you could do to add tension and excitement is to speed up (not the actual tempo, but playing for example eighth notes instead of quarter) and add in the note an octave above or below. So if you're playing e e e e you could do something like e E e E e E e E. To make that slightly more interesting, instead of simply alternating, follow the pattern of the drums, especially the kick and snare. If you lock in well with the drummer, you'll sound much tighter.\n\nBut what you really need to do is learn about chords. I don't mean how to play full chords on bass (though it couldn't hurt to know, that usually won't help you much in a classic rock setting) but instead learn what the chords to the songs are, how you can tell what notes make up those chords, etc. The safest notes to play besides root notes when you don't really know what you're doing are going to be the other chord tones.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400106385", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(continued from above)\n\n&gt;Green spices at the beginning in a major overtone are the quintessential liability of one’s assets and fortunes.\n\nHere, it seems that he's trying to grapple with why one surrenders one's assets in the way described in the last section. \"Green spices\" is kind of weird. I'll look at \"major overtone\" first. An overtone is, in music, \"a musical tone that is a part of the harmonic series above a fundamental note and may be heard with it.\". Ok... a harmonic series, what's that? \"A harmonic series is the sequence of all multiples of a base frequency.\" - ok I'm not that familiar with musical theory, but I did find this interesting part in the wikipedia article on \"Harmonic Series (music)\":\n\n&gt;*Partial, harmonic, fundamental, inharmonicity, and overtone*\n\n&gt;Any complex tone \"can be described as a combination of many simple periodic waves (i.e., sine waves) or partials, each with its own frequency of vibration, amplitude, and phase.\" (Fourier analysis)\n\n&gt;A partial is any of the sine waves by which a complex tone is described.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;An overtone is any partial except the lowest. Overtone does not imply harmonicity or inharmonicity and has no other special meaning other than to exclude the fundamental. This can lead to numbering confusion when comparing overtones to partials; the first overtone is the second partial.\n\nWhoa - ok. Overtones, in harmonics, is when, to my understanding from this, the \"fundamental\" or lowest partial (maybe the lowest \"note\", in layman's terms?) is *excluded*. The overtone is exclusionary, and it excludes the part of a complex sound that is called \"the fundamental\". Ok, going back to the text, what's \"the beginning of a major overtone\"? Well it seems like it's the first overtone, or second partial. Looking at the chart in the wikipedia article ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music) ), I can see that the \"second major\" partial corresponds to the note D on the musical scale, the first being C. I may be interpreting this wrong, but it would seem to me that the beginning of a major overtone is the note, D. The whole overtone series would then be, it seems like \"D E F G A B\", with C being excluded, since it's the first partial in a major hamonic series, *I think*. Still kind of fuzzy on all this, just trying to find something to work with here.\n\nOk, so reinterpreting the first sentence, we get:\n\n\"Green spices at the note D are the quintessential liability of one's assets and fortunes.\" What?! What are these enigmatic \"green spices\"?? It seems like a lot depends on these green spices! It's too general, I think, to try and find a specific green spice, but... they do bear a resemblance to another part of the text in that \"Greenville\" also begins with \"green\". The fakeness philosophy of Greenville, as interpreted previously, seems like it could indeed fit the bill as a \"quintessential liability of one's assets and fortunes\", since once one gets sucked down the road of trying to remain sane through credulity (going out on a bit of a limb here), then one's assets and fortunes, and by fortunes I'd interpret that as endeavors and outcomes, get subjugated and their quality reduced. Yes one may be able to stay sane through credulity, but will one be operating with respect to what's really true? It is by knowing the real, certain truth (even if it can only be estimated), that we can navigate the world in a way that's more to our advantage, and we can better accomplish our intentions within the world. Subjugating the truth to sanity may feel good, but it ultimately puts us at a disadvantage with respect to our ability to navigate and respond to life with knowledge and understanding of things like cause and effect. Why note D? Well, maybe because note D is the second step after the fundamental, meaning one passes from perhaps the familiar (the starting place of C) into the unfamiliar (D), and the change may cause fright and retreat back into the familiar, never allowing the full series to be grasped. However, this may not be the right interpretation, because in that case why not say \"The second note in a major harmonic series\"? Maybe, instead, the overtone series is a way of referencing a life cut off from the fundamental of C, staying only in the overtone notes, starting from D. Maybe \"green spices\" are about becoming comfortable within the overtone series, which perhaps displaces a person from the fundamental. I guess this is a good time to note that I'm just trying to make educated guesses, but ultimately it's your brother's own system of meaning and his intentions that would matter here - I can't necessarily pin down exactly what he means. But I can uncover possibilities.\n\n&gt;Like bag blown in the air, piping and down streaming off a bit in a splattery of misery.\n\nThis seems to just refer to one's ideas and sense of reality being blown around, here and there as if by the wind. \"Piping\" may refer to the later idea of following the piper, as expressed by \"Drooling and playing as the piper goes on.\". Like with the ripple and with the harmonic series, there seems to be a rhythm that applies here, which perhaps just refers to how things move up and down, here and there through time, perhaps moving down stream through this process (as described by \"down streaming\"). \"Splattery of misery\" may refer to the misery felt by those who have to surrender themselves to this mode of being, being blown here and there, or perhaps instead, or in addition, it describes the misery of insanity that they are trying to escape. My bet would be on both: miserable because one's assets and fortunes have been surrendered to credulity, and also miserable at the idea or possibility of choosing truth over credulity, since the fear of insanity may inhibit that.\n\n&gt;Horrible is the fact of that which is a conduit for its bohemian passing. Down the river, down the road, mastering a interstated sequence, gushing down for ultimate confidence. Raspberry tarts could not match the deed.\n\nThis part seems to be a reflection on the movement through the conduit of the desire for sanity through credulity, which seems to have \"confidence\" as its ultimate goal, whether or not that confidence is based on truth. \"Raspberry tarts\" seem to be that which is produced from this path, which is a nice little treat, a reward of confident, safe feelings that your brother seems to be arguing do not match the deed of giving up so much when going down \"sanity lane\". This makes sense in the later context of Greenville, since it's a city that produces tarts, and seems to represent a society of people operating on this level of credulity and fear of insanity. A few parts in this before I move on.\n\nFirst, \"bohemian passing\". Bohemian seems to mean, in this context: \"living a wandering or vagabond life\". \"Bohemian passing\", then, just seems like another way of describing the life of one whose ideas wander without a dedication to the accurate truth - it's this same sort of feeling of moving in a random, wandering fashion. Neither here nor there, like a bag in the wind, all of that.\n\nThe second part that stands out as something to investigate is \"mastering an interstated sequence\". Hmm. Interstated isn't even a word, so I wonder what he might mean by it? Well, interstate may mean, in this context: \"existing or carried on between states\". \"mastering an interstated sequence\", then, may mean mastering a lifestyle of existing between states. He probably changed it to \"interstated\" because \"interstate\" is more present, but he might be trying to talk about a history, developed over time, of existing in such a way, neither here nor there, moving between states, which may be a metaphor for intellectual or emotional states. Or maybe just the states of one's world view and attitudes.\n\nBut all in all the passage seems to be developing the idea of this \"conduit\" or really this way of life, encapsulated by the word \"credulity\", the subject that began the passage as a whole.\n\n(continued in reply)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400206759", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Also remember you are a teamfight champion, you aren't supposed to win against dualists. just farm, relax, punish, and dodge. Most lanes I win thats all I do, I don't go all in before I know its a safe.. Your basic attack also scales with AP, so throw in as many as you can while laning/tfs. remember wards, a pink in the brush between mid/drake. You are a hybrid between a poker and a support, some games you will get 0 kills and 15 assist, but thats fine your ult is still op if you get it.

You can also get abbysal and a bunch of other situational items, but thats for you to decide on the fly.\n\nSpells 101:\n-Reminder: Q gives Vision, don't facecheck.\n-Set ur Q between you and your opponment to zone easier. also say if the enemy jungler flanks you, then you need to get that EW off quickly, if it is at max range than its pretty much a  half second before the ball comes to shield you\n-QW regurlar poke\n-QWE just behind her, the E will go through her, dealing 60%? percent of shield amount into damage. You also get a shield if you are going in with auto attacks, carefull of your mana though, this is costly\n-E(Q)RWQ E a friendly let him jump in and then get a good ult off, know that your E has a longer cast range than Q and you also get a range indicator on how far you can go away from a target with E before the ball comes back.\n-EW friendlys to help them run away or chase if you are running in a group E the first target running. This also works with Q if E is on CD, might save a life if you know this in the heat of combat.\n\nLearn how the Ult work, if you can E W Q R a friend who is being chased, you can save him pretty easly. The ult is hard to explain, it doesn't simply drag people to the middle as a lot of people seem to think, it more reverses the position of the target hit.. If you hit an ult when they are close to the middle, they will be thrown further away from the ball just on the opposite side. and vise versa.\n\nVS Other Pokechamps, This is pretty much mostly about skills. dodge and poke. Don't focus to much on killing though, just punish. wait for your jungler, ward a side and stick to it. (Through Gold - Plat I found that 95% of the lanes I won, I didn't do shit, all I did was farm and punish.) You should always win in cs. Take wraiths IF your jungler aren't doing them in some time. Its pretty much a waiting game, if she uses her cooldowns you punish her, Keep your ball in between you and the opponment and harass whenever you can. \n\nVS DPS: Poke her hard, don't miss CS and dont die.. really aint much to it, if you give away a kill or two and you cant trade just play against her like a normal poke champ.\n\nVS Assassins, play defensivly, (WARD A LOT/SPAM SS when you think he raoms, add a few Warning signals aswell) Use your QWE and AA to get as much CS as possible. Whenever he tries to roam, push. NEVER follow unless you are certain there is no way he can turn around and kill you.\nGetting a few points in E doesn't hurt if he grabs a kill or two.. If it is akali/zed who gets their assassin role at level 6, play normally up to then, just don't forget that the power spike is huge. If he dives you under your turret, remember E - R - Q - W might save your life and kill your oppenemnt. Also when your poke starts hurting a lot( around 8 I'd say) Zone him but don't get baited, he might still be able to easly kill you.\n\nTL:DR: Don't die, and cs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400355844", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 104, "controversiality": 0}

A half-hour lesson goes by quite quickly, especially when dealing with a beginner who needs everything spelled out!\n\nStart with tunes that can be played on one string, then two strings, etc.  After several songs have been taught, you can then go to introduce scales and show how those tunes are derived from the scales.  Chord triads come from scales, so you can show simple three-string chords that go behind each of the songs that you have taught.  These would be easier for a new person to hold down than full chords.\n\nFrom chords comes timing - time signatures, a tempo and strumming.  Write them out using semi-breves, minims and crotchets to show when to strum on beat one, beats one and three or all four beats in a bar.\n\nRemember that your students will be there to have fun and enjoy themselves, so don't be disappointed if they don't progress as fast as you wish them too.  Always have material prepared beforehand, and make sure that you think through it thoroughly to anticipate questions.  You can even answer those questions in the material in order to give students a reference for future practice and to save you from repeating yourself.\n\nMake sure to have fun yourself!

{"body": "Dark seer is one of the coolest heroes you can play in the game because he can pretty much work in any line up. While it is always orgasmic to watch a huge vacuum into epicenter or witch doctor ultimate(with aghs), his ability to create mass confusion and pull heroes out of position cannot be undervalued. \n\nIt is great if you get to solo off lane because you can get levels and farm fairly easily in pubs since it is unlikely that you would be facing a deathly tri lane or a tri lane in which the supports are super efficient at double pulling creep waves to deny experience. The best case scenario is when you are one v one against a melee hero because of the huge harass ion shell deals and the fact that you can play aggressively by using shell on yourself and surging into the enemy solo. Also if you feel that supports are beginning to rotate in more and that you feel a little pressure you can move into the jungles real easily since ion shell at level 2 makes it real easy to take out stacked camps. The only problems that you may face the early game is if the enemy lane has a really efficient tri lane with a lot of kill potential (like sd, mirana, dazzle) in which case you may be forced to just abandon lane and go into the jungle at level 1. While not terrible it is a little slow and might take a while for you to get going since you clear out camps pretty slowly and will tank way too much damage.\n\nThe best part about dark seer is his item choices. He is probably one of the most versatile heroes since he can rush a quick mek for the team, a force staff or blink if he is looking for early team fight initiation, a pipe if your team needs it and then can shift into luxury items such as bots of travel, hex, shivas, aghs, refresher.\n The vacuum wall combo is probably the most intimidating part of the hero but not the hardest. You can get a hang of the vac into wall after a while but he relies heavily on positioning in team fights because if he gets disabled the fight gets pretty disadvantageous for your team. This is why blink or a force staff can be considered core on him. the instant surprise vac+wall can really disjoint your opponents and chaos ensues.\n\nHope i helped, but I just feel that I can't write it down clearly enough.

{"body": "i feel like i am giving away a big secret here because i see everyone play this champ so poorly and with shitty cookie cutter mage builds. for example 99% of every velkoz i have seen rushes athene's but why? his spells basically have no mana cost to begin with and it doesnt give enough damage. in the champion spotlight they encouraged people to max Q and i am like stahhhhp pls! my friend will bitch at me for playing a \"no damage\" champion but i often times have significantly higher damage on the charts even as support velkoz.\n\nwhen i play velkoz i will push the lane so fast that the other mage will struggle to keep the minions out of their tower. max your W. it's literally 4 nukes. 2 charges of a 2 hit nuke. max W E W Q or W Q W E depending on how you want to lane but always leave 1 point in E as mid. as support max Q because you are poking not clearing. Max W last in that case.\n\nafter a couple levels you can W a full minion wave line as it comes in. then W again when they settle on a position and basically clear the entire wave before your minions take any damage. if possible your second W wants to overlay the minion wave AND the enemy champ. if you pull that off you need to hit them with a third spell to pop the true damage passive. if you can pop your passive a couple times in lane it sets the other guy so far behind in trades. if you see the enemy jungler somewhere sit at the enemy tower and beat the shit out of the enemy mage while they are trying to farm under tower. if you land a Q on them then go ahead and waste a W charge. Q - E - W\n\nthis is the part im afraid to tell everyone though. screw your cookie cutter mage builds. rush liandry's. liandry's tics like once per second but it will tic on the first application of damage and it does double on disables champs. your ult tics 4x per second and if you combo Q E W R the other guy will be knockup snared while the ult comes across with liandry's making it 8x effective on the ultimate.\n\nyou are an immobile mage so the extra health also helps tons when someone gets on top of you. i usally like to go void staff second.

{"body": "Oh fuck yes, now is my moment!\n\nI play Diana top, mid, and jungle, and I play her almost exclusively.  This post will be kind of general, but I'll get more in-depth in replies to this post (everything I want to say won't fit, gg).\n\nThe first thing you need to do is decide whether you should even pick Diana in your comp.  She's great in AoE teamfight comps, she's great in comps where she can split push and duel, and she can provide great peel for her own carries.\n\nDiana is *not* good against strong peel or hard disengage, early-centric enemy junglers (Lee, Elise, Kha), and she's not good in situations where no one else on her team can engage fights.\n\nSo if all of those things are good to go, let's talk about how to play Diana in lane/jungle!\n\nIn lane, Diana is either a huge bully or she gets shat on until she hits 6.  There is no middle ground: Diana wins melee matchups and gets punked in ranged ones.\n\nRegardless, start Doran's Ring, 2 health pots, and a warding totem.  Take W at level 1.\n\nIn mid, the first thing you want to do is shove your lane hard.  Most enemy laners (e.g. \"anyone that's not Kayle\") can't compete with your waveclear at level 1 because you start with 2 huge AoE damage sources: W and your passive.  Shoving your lane forces the enemy laner to either (1) take a bunch of minion damage at level 1 *which is fucking important* or (2) lose CS to turret.  On top of those, you'll force them to spend mana to clear the wave, and you need them to burn as much mana as possible.  When they can't cast spells, it doesn't matter if you're melee; they can't stop you from farming.\n\nWhen you ping 2, grab Q, but don't plan on using it, yet.  Your level 1 Q is piss-weak; it's literally not worth the mana it costs.  If an enemy eats *every single Q*, you will still run out of mana before they run out of health.  By eating their harass with W, you create the opposite situation: your health outlasts their mana, and leaves them pretty harmless.  When your enemy is 2, play safer, since they've probably just doubled the amount of damage they can harass you with.\n\nAt 3, you can either take Q or W again.  If they're harassing you hard enough that you're taking damage through your shields, W lets you eat more of it.  Otherwise, once you've got 2 points in Q, it actually kind of hurts, and it's worth poking when you can land them.\n\nAbout E.  Honestly, I sometimes don't take it for quite some time, since it's mostly unusable in mid lane unless your jungler's coming to gank or you're getting dived.  The lane is short enough that, even after 6, you won't be able to land much extra damage after your burst without taking turret shots.  You can put that point in Q or W, alternatively, and actually use it.\n\nBy 5, you want to be harassing with Q (level 3) whenever you can land it.  If you poke them low enough at 5, they're an easy kill at 6.  Since you've managed your mana well up until this point, you have enough to kill them as long as you're landing your harass.\n\nAt 6, you should be actively looking to kill your lane opponent.  You're going to do this by charging your passive on minions, then trying to land Q.  If you land it, go in with R, blow your passive all over their face, and soak up the counter-harass with W.  If they're low enough that it will kill them (with Ignite), press R again and collect your gold; otherwise, walk away, refresh your shield, and repeat.\n\nAs Diana, look to roam a lot, especially in the enemy jungle.  Junglers are frequently not at full health and frequently don't have combat stats, so you can check their camps with Q and, if you see someone pop up, R into them and wreck face.\n\nWhen ganking other lanes, try to deny escapes with E (cancels any dashes), rather than just pushing it whenever.\n\nIn mid lane, I usually build 2 Doran's into Chalice.  If you can afford it at any point, grab a Needlessly; the extra AP means that whatever mana you have *will* be enough to kill things.\n\nMy full build order when mid is: Doran's x2, Chalice/Needlessly, Athene's, Hourglass, Nashor's (starting with Fiendish Codex, not Stinger), Deathcap/Void Staff (hat if you need to be tankier, void if you want more damage).  Build sorc shoes when a tower gets pushed down.\n\nIn top lane, your job is sort of the reverse: just be a huge fucking bully and *don't care*.  Look to fight every time your passive is up.  Just hit them, shield their retaliation, and kill minions.  Like mid, shove the lane: they can't do anything about it.\n\nStart W.  Once you've bullied your enemy away from the creep wave, max Q.  If you're ahead, take E to force them to fight you when they don't want to.\n\nBuild order is largely the same, except grab Seeker's if you need to, and don't finish Athene's until after Hourglass.  Also, get the Stinger before the Codex when working on Nashor's: against melee opponents, you can apply more damage.\n\nIf you get behind, practice last-hitting with Q.  Don't feed; accept that you're getting denied.  If they try to dive you, use your deceptive tankiness and burst to show them why that's a bad idea, then use your pull to force them to live with the consequences of their decision.  Keep in mind that after they jump on you, you can Q R to their minion wave to stop taking damage while your turret goes ham on them.\n\nIn the jungle, start W and max Q for clear time.  If you have a 40% attack speed page, use that.  Also, be sure that your laners know that you can't gank any but the most-overextended lanes pre-6, so they should play safe and wait for your power spike.\n\nI generally build Wriggle's into Spirit Stone (yes, both: this solves your mana issues, makes your clear time retarded, lets you give your mid every blue, and means that you're always at full health/mana, so always ready to gank/countergank) into Stinger and Sorcs, then Hourglass and Nashor's.  Once you're sitting on Flare, you're a fucking monster.  You push fast and eat turrets and are strong in duels, so make that happen.  Once you finish Hourglass, bring that same power into teamfights.\n\nSpeaking of team fights, you can play Diana as a fighter/assassin (wait for someone to engage and blow CC, then pick a squishy and fuck their day up with Q R W E and autos; don't R twice *unless you need to for a kill*, so you preserve your ability to relocate in the fight), you can play her as peel for bigger carries (E has a really big slow later in the game, and you can do it often since you're building CDR), or you can dive into the enemy team, W, E, Hourglass when you get focused, and pray for followup from your team.  Try to avoid that last one, but sometimes you'll have to go balls deep.  Don't be afraid to try plays: learn what you can and can't do.\n\nAny other questions, feel free to ask!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400378708", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "as an orianna main i posted a similar thread on summoners school i'm copying my post from there, hope it helps\n\norianna is one of the most balanced mid lane champions in game. depending on lane match-up she can both be bully or passive. but orianna's most powerful aspect is her teamfighting ability. She can be played in almost all teamcomps.\nfor masteries depending on matchup i go 21/9/0 or 21/0/9 with biscuit talent. against ad mids i prefer going 21/9/0 while against ap i go 21/0/9. for runes i use hybrid pen marks, armor seals(even after the changes), scaling ap glyphs and ap quints. you can change armor seals or scaling ap glyphs with other viable options but hybrid pen marks are mandatory. as summoner spells against bursty champs i take barrier/flash others ignite/flash, with summoner changes you can also choose heal or exhaust instead of ignite/barrier but i'm not used to it so i don't.\nat level 1 if we are going to invade or if their level 1 is stronger than ours i level q for scouting, if not i level e. leveling e is just too good to give up for level 1. as mentioned orianna's autos hurt a lot and with shield you can sustain enemy minion dmg or their autos. level 1 e means you always win the first trade and be able to start bully. after then depending on matchup i go q w q q or q w q w r w w q. now you probably ask which one to choose when. against mobile mids level q to position ball better and against less mobile or immobile champs level w to hurt them when i find to chance. but don't forget that using w constantly is an easy way to deplete mana.\n\norianna is easy to gank because she dont have any kind of dashes or escape abilities except flash so map awareness and warding is important. if caught she can still 1v2 with enemy mid laner + jungler and kill one of them. so if you are sure that you are going to die, fight them.\nUsing mana considerably is the key of having a chance in these fights because you are going to need to use a rotation of her spells and probably with a well placed shockwave you'd able to survive. If you are so sure that you are going to die here is a quick tip. try to calculate enemys pathing and make sure you start to run a different direction from them while throwing your ball to them. you can even escape to their jungler just use the path that makes them chase you. when you find to shockwave enemy mid and jungler together dont hesitate. at this moment two things can happen; 1) they can flash/rappel/jump/dash etc and use their precious gap closer to dodge it. 2) they can just be unprepared and eat it. at this moment you can use your flash over a wall because of they have just used their gap closing abilities or simply stunned they wont be able to respond to this movement. by doing this you can make them waste 2 flashes to kill you even if you die. \n\nafter level 6 you should start playing depending on the mid laner's movements. is he roaming or farming? if he's farming don't roam orianna is not good at roaming and creating opportunities. orianna excels at farming so if enemy mid laner wants to farm its fine you probably will farm better and outscale him. what if he's roaming? then your team will need some wards on river to see his movement and you need to shove your lane and take the tower or follow him. i said that orianna is not good at roaming but still she can be hell of a pain with shockwave while enemy is overextended on your bot lane and trying to force a 3v2.\n\nfor item builds i build depending on enemy team/opposing mid laner. ordinary build is athenes into deathcap then zhonyas/void for me but if they are assassin/ad heavy you can build tear &gt; zhonyas/morellonomicon(zhonya morello order can change but if you are not building athenes you are buying morello for cdr.) then archangels.\nand at last teamfighting. if your team has an eligible ball delivery champion aka initiator, you should try to use shockwave while your ball is on them. elise, leona, lee sin and kha'zix are the best ball delivery champions imo. this sounds easy to do but actually its pretty hard because if they dash too far away from you while you are pressing r your ball can come back to you and you may shockwave the air. it's the most demoralizing thing as an orianna player. even after a couple hundred games with her i still miss my shockwaves :D so you need to run with your initiator while he's initiating for being in a good spot to press r. but while doing this dont get caught. and also try to keep your ball closer to the enemy team than your team. what i mean by that is if your team moves a bit forward move your ball forward as well think of it as 6th player in your team and move it with team. why? because your ball is not that fast and when you need to reposition your ball, you need it to be closer to its target thats why.\n\nlast and the most important thing. dont rush to press r, i have played too many games with her trust me, wait, don't panic. you will have the chance.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400406007", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This might be an expensive alteration, but it's worth asking about.\n\nMFA recommends Allen Edmonds for dress shoes. Specifically, the Park Avenue, Carlyle, and Fifth Avenue models would work best in this situation- the Park Avenue is called a cap-toe, Carlyle is a plain-toe, and Fifth Avenue is a quarter-brogue (brogueing is the punch-holes that you see all over many leather shoes; quarter-brogue means there's only brogueing on the cap toe). I don't know how much you know about quality shoes, so here's a quick summary.\n\nThe point of spending so much money on shoes is that it's actually cheaper to purchase one pair of goodyear-welted, leather soled, quality dress shoes rather than replacing a pair of glued-sole, cheap, unattractive shoes once a year. The key here is that you have to take care of the nice shoes for them to last- you'll want a pair of shoe trees that you keep in the shoes whenever you don't wear them, you won't want to re-wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row, you'll want to regularly clean, condition, and polish the shoes.\n\nIf you've never had a leather soled shoe before, the point of a goodyear welt (the style of construction for the shoe) is that once the sole wears out with use, you can send the shoe to a cobbler (or back to Allen Edmonds) to get a new sole attached (with customizations such as heel and toe taps, topy, etc.) A leather sole is considered the dressiest because it has a slim profile, and it's been the tradition for a very long time.\n\nAll that means you can invest some money up front and some time in the future to saving money on dress shoes while simultaneously looking better. The shoes I recommended are all relatively un-adorned, making them more formal, and they're all classic, safe, and attractive designs- note how they aren't boxy or square-toed, shapes which are really unflattering on the foot. \n\nAnother important thing to understand about shoes is what's called a last. Lasts are basically shoe blueprints, or shoe molds, and it's important to find a shoe that fits well- depending on the last, the shoe can be uncomfortably tight or unnecessarily loose for your foot in certain places, leading to foot problems or extra creasing/wrinkling on the leather.\n\nThe Park Avenues and Fifth Avenues are both on the \"5 last\" (aka \"65 last\"), which is a narrow fit and might cause pinky toe squeezing. No matter what brand of dress shoes you end up purchasing, it's very important to try on multiple sizes and widths to find the one size that's in between too tight and too loose. It's possible that a last simply doesn't have a good size for your foot. For example, I'm unlucky in this respect, as my right foot is wider than my left. The Carlyle, on the 8 (108) last, will never fit me properly- size 8D is too narrow for me, and size 8E is too wide. \n\nShoe widths go from narrow to large: AAA AA A B C D E EE EEE, with D being medium width. When trying to find the right size, make sure to walk around in the shoe, and if possible, try it on after you've walked around for a while that day- your feet swell over the course of the day, and no matter how attractive and expensive the shoe is, you can be miserable with one that constantly distracts you with foot pain.\n\nOne more thing- you should look on the Allen Edmonds Shoe Bank for shoes once you've found your size. The shoebank is a repository of factory second quality (aka slightly defective) shoes, which don't pass quality control. Allen Edmonds sells these at a discounted price through their factory stores- you have to make a phone order for these shoes, and shipping is free, but returns are $10 a pair. I own two pairs of factory second shoes, and the so-called defects are imperceptible- I don't even remember what was defective about one pair, as shoe polish has long since hidden any tiny blemish in the leather. Additionally, there's a decent sale running on factory second shoes right now, so it's a good time to buy. For example, Park Avenues are currently $219 at factory second quality, as opposed to $365 full price.\n\nhttp://www.shoebank.com/FactorySecondInventory.php\n\n\nI've linked the Allen Edmonds page about their lasts below, so you can get a better idea of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/AllAboutLastsView?catalogId=40000000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=1\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400442956", "subreddit": "malefashionadvice", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It depends a lot more on how much cdr you have than on whether you are maxing w second. If you have 40% CDR, you can use q in between each spell like so: Q r Q e Q w Q. If you don't have full cdr, you usually need 2 spells before your q can be off cooldown. In which case the combo looks like: Q e r Q w. This is of course not optimal because you have to wait a little bit before you can get another q off, breaking the chain so to speak. That's why CDR is such a prized stat on ryze.\n\nOne little tip that I'll mention here is that if you have your q in the air and activate your r, your q will land and deal the aoe. That means that rather than pressing R Q you should be pressing Q R. Indeed, if your q is up, you should be pressing it before ANY spell because the spell will then reduce the cooldown of your q, allowing you to cast it faster. \n\nOther than cdr, the combo changes based on the situation. If you absolutely need to snare someone, you would w before anything. If you could stand to wait, you would throw a q before you snared, because throwing a q before any spell reduces the cooldown of q so it will be up sooner. If you don't need to snare someone ASAP and have a little time, you would throw e at them first to reduce their MR so both your w and your subsequent qs would deal more damage. If you activated R before your E, then you could potentially get even more damage out of E because the e would do AOE when bouncing to other targets, potentially hitting the primary target multiple times. \n\nReading the above, it would appear the ideal combo would be to r first, then e, then w to get the maximum possible damage. However, someone showed me this little trick: you can press r with q in midair and have your q treated like an aoe; however, this true not just for q, but for e as well. This means that the idea combo would be Qe(both in midair)RQwQ. This way your r is doing double duty as it is reducing the cooldown of two spells simultaneously.

I didn't realize how important Shyvana's mark is so I wasn't really good at her until recently.\n\n\nKha is fairly simple early, you just run into lane hit them with your W and Q Q Q Q and if they start getting away you E after them.

Doing that, you'll be able to say to yourself \"Ok, he's playing a G, I should play a G.\" or \"That's a D, I should play a D.\" When they tell you the chords, ask them to play the rhythm slowly so you can see what shapes they'll use throughout the song. Then you can just follow the guitar.\n\nI don't like using a capo or retuning, so I usually stay in Open G when jamming. If it's in an awkward key, I'll just play closed chords. If you're trying to take a break, G B and D are in most scales so they'll work over most keys. On the scales they aren't in, you can throw them in for dissonance. As long you resolve on root of the chord they're playing, it'll sound alright.\n\nIf you want to learn to improvise, ask your teacher to start showing you how. If you're coming from a perfect the piece route, it'll take some work to wrap your head around the mentality of improvising.

He was always very proud of the three consecutive zeros at the end of his name.\n\nRight, anyway, Jack did watch out but watching Number 2,326,000's yawn, he too yawned, so he nearly messed up again but didn't because how do you think he lived long enough for a real name?

{"body": "Really good for a first attempt, honestly. You don't want to see what my first tablet drawings looked like -shudder-.\n\nMy favorite software is Paint tool SAI, it's relatively cheap if you're not into pirating software. Photoshop is also super amazing, but insanely expensive.\n\nThe biggest piece of advice I can give to you is use references for **E V E R Y T H I N G!!!!** And I mean it. I catch myself not using them, and once I'm done drawing I can definitely tell the difference between ones I've not used references on and ones I have. Now that you have a tablet you have no excuse to NOT use references- you can have them pulled up on your screen next to your drawing.. heck, even ON your canvas (just make sure you delete the layer it's on!)\n\nEven if you don't like how cramped your canvas might feel (btw I stick to 300ppi, and usually 10in x 10in, but I resize as I work), if you have an ipad or even a spare computer (old crappy laptop), pull your reference up on those. HECK, even books (manga!!!) are good references.\n\nMy second biggest piece of advice isn't really about the drawing, it's about the process. I find myself getting very frustrated and doubtful when it comes to skill when I am unable to make something look right.

{"body": "&gt; does a leading tone have to progress to the tonic?\n\nIt doesn't have to *progress* to the tonic, but it has to *tend* to the tonic.  If I play C D E F G A B G, the B is the leading tone to the C, and you *expect* it to go to C but it goes to G instead.  It's still the leading tone because you expected it to go to the tonic; it simply failed your expectations.\n\n&gt; if progressing to the 'leading tone' would it still be considered a leading tone?\n\nThe leading tone always tends to the tonic.  But if you're tonicizing some other note, then you could have a secondary leading tone.  For example, if you're in C major, F# is the leading tone to the G.  When you use the F# tending to G, you pretend that G is the tonic.  You can pretend that any note is the tonic, with a modulation (change of key) or just a tonicization (very brief change of key).  So if you're in C major, you can briefly move to B major and have an A#, which is the leading tone to B, which is ordinarily the leading tone to C but you're briefly using it as a tonic.\n\nActually, I can see 4 - 3 as an exception, but I'm not sure \"leading tone\" is the best term there.\n\n&gt; could a minor 2nd descending to the tonic be considered a leading tone?\n\nI would say *absolutely, yes*.  Others will disagree on terminology.  In my opinion, any note that strongly tends to another note by step is a leading tone.  That means that a b7 could be a lowered leading tone, or a 4 could be the leading tone to the 3.  One of my favorite cadences is well-used in Spanish music.  In C, it would be Db F G to C E G.  The Db and F are basically leading tones to the C and E, so Db F G works as a dominant chord, even though it's not a dominant 7th -- that would be the G7.  This chord is basically a Gø7, or a G7b5 (or Gm7b5; it's missing the third anyway).\n\n&gt; could harmonic and melodic minor scales be considered altered to create leading tones in a minor scale?\n\nThis is the entire reason why the harmonic and melodic minor scales exist in Western common practice music.  The harmonic scale is for chords and the melodic scale is for melodic lines.  The reason the 6th is raised in the melodic scale is to prevent the augmented second there would otherwise be between the b6 and 7.  In the harmonic scale, this doesn't matter because the harmonic scale is \"never\" actually played in order.  The harmonic minor scale reflects the reality that you use V in minor instead of v, and the melodic minor scale reflects the reality that the 7th is raised in melodies when it leads to the tonic, and the 6th must also be raised to avoid the augmented second.  The natural minor scale is also \"never\" actually played.  \"Never\" is in quotes because some composers were weird; of course, today, all of these scales are popular in their own rights.  In common practice, they were simply different ways to explain how people played music in a minor key.\n\nBy the way, the \"Spanish\" scale is basically the 5th mode of minor.  Imagine the C minor scale*s*, starting on G.  In C minor, you play G major as the dominant, right?  So the tonic chord is G major.  The notes of the \"natural\" scale are G Ab Bb C D Eb F G (also known as phrygian), but the \"harmonic\" version is G Ab B C D Eb F G (known as phrygian dominant), and the \"melodic\" version that is often played is G A B C D Eb F G F Eb D C Bb Ab G.  With this, you get the famous Andalusian Cadence, which goes Cm Bb Ab G.  It's got a Bb major chord, and the G chord at the end has a B natural.  Why?  The Bb comes from the descending melodic version of the scale and the B natural from the harmonic.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400563029", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am also interested in discussions related to macro and microalgae cultivation (with more emphasis on microalgae) and processing techniques (and potential employment in these fields) to green diesel and biodiesel. \n\nSome topic discussion areas of interest (of interest to me anyway :D) are:\n\n* How to make cultivated algae based feedstocks for bio/green diesel production sexy to the public and to non-technical politicians?\n* Algae cultivation as a means to offset or mitigate point source industrial CO2 emissions. For example, algae cultivation using the high concentration CO2 effluent from ethanol production (fermentation of grain sugars or from cellulosic material) fermenters to produce a viable (positive cash flow) material concurrent with reducing the plant overall CO2 emission (where CO2 emission often drives the design cap on nameplate capacity).  An example application - InBev could cut a substaintial amount of direct CO2 emissions ([Anheuser-Busch InBev: 2009 year](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/05/17/anheuser-busch-inbev-cuts-water-and-co2-emissions-by-nearly-9/); 3 million metric tons - 3x10^9 kilograms), and possibile indirect CO2 emissions, by using the CO2 effluent as feedstock for algea cultivation with the algea processed into internal transportation and energy diesel fuels.  \n* Algae cultivation designs and tradeoffs between deep water farming, shallow water ponds/raceways, and photobioreactors vs. land/water surface area usage, yields, and costs, and subsequent processing to diesel fuels.\n* Algae selection for use as feedstocks; and production tradeofffs for lipid/triglyceride/fatty acids production as an 'easy' feedstock for mono alkyl ester biodiesel via esterification/transesterification vs. straight biomass production for various methods of green diesel (and green gasoline) production.\n* Carbon tax credits, in general, and applicability to algae to diesel production.\n* EPA certification of various algae based green diesel energy and transportation fuel formulation \n* Esterification/transesterification production techniques and tradeoffs for various lipid feedstocks (applicable to algae as well as traditional oilseed oil feedstocks).\n* How can large scale algae based green/biodiesel production be used as a selling point to increase diesel engine sales in North America (diesel engines have better lifetime economics than gasoline engines)? Additionally fossil fuel conversion to diesel fuels is less energy intensive and has lower overall emissions than gasoline production. \n\nI am also interested in algae cultivation in general (photobioreactor design that allows high land area utilization, mechanical/optical methods to increase PAR utilization (genetic modification of algae to better utilize PAR and/or increase growth rate/internal chemical production is very interesting but outside my areas of expertize), algae selection for cultivation [specific chemical constituents like lipids vs. straight biomass utilization], wet mass algal extraction techniques, wet mass algal feedstock utilization (water removal to a dry mass is energy intensive),  wet to dry mass drying techniques and energy requirements; and cost/production/product trade-offs between lipid extraction and processing, algal bio-oil steam (sub-critical water) reforming, syngas production and reforming, etc.] but these topics are likely beyond the scope of a biodiesel subreddit.\n\nWhile I am not interested in being a primary mod to this subreddit (I can see myself liking it [oh the P O W E R! /heh] and becoming a mod/more involved in other subreddits, but I already spend too much time on reddit), but should traffic in this subreddit increase to where part time mods/watch mods are needed, I can assist.

{"body": "Again apologize for the late response time! I work nights, got hung up later than planned or else i would have responded sooner.\n\nI find pegging my lists most common. As I mentioned in my last post that when I do lists I peg on thing to another and then develop pegs from that peg and so on. That's most common for me anyway since I tend to start lists with a single phrase or word that develops into an entire \"list\" or pegs.\n\nAs for word for word? That's depends on the purpose of the phrase. If I'm reading a book for fun, I don't typically remember it word for word, but rather have a vivid description of the authors thoughts and depict as close to a perfect interpretation of what I read. Now, if its an important document, say a research paper on a topic related subject, then I find that I tend to remember direct quotes almost perfectly.\n\nFormula's I try and use terms that I'll see in the word questions or variable in number equations. For example a Gas Laws question:\n\nIf you have 500ml of oxygen gas at 27C at 86 Kpa what is the volume at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure)?\n\nThe equation is setup as:\n\n500ml  x   101.3  x  273  = New Volume\n\n              -----     -----\n                86       300\n\nNow using pegs I know that I am to convert Celsius to Kelvin and then find the ratio. I know I started at 300K but STP is 0C or 273K so the number decreased which means my ratio must be decreasing. My pressure is 86 Kpa but at STP its 101.3 which means it increased so my ratio is supposed to be increasing as well! Now, this is combined gas laws equation using 2 gas laws: A) as Pressure increases Volume decreases B) as Temperature increases Volume increases. Now I could go into detail with (&lt;/&gt;) symbols like I have in my head to explain how i set up my ratios, but I'll keep it simple:\n\nIf both Pressure and Temperature are rising:\n\nV x P x T (in K)  = NV\n\n     --  --\n     p x t (in K)   = NV\n\nIf both Pressure and Temperature are decreasing:\n\nV x p x t (in K) = NV\n\n    --   --\n     P x T (in K) = NV\n\nNow I know I could go without all the examples and everything, but to show a visual layout is different for me. This is how your teacher sees it and teaches it. This is how I really see it:\n\nV x P=(Z or Y) x T=(S or R) = NV\n\nRatio for P is Z if pressure increases from given value, or Y if pressure decreases from given value. Ratio for T is S if temperature is increasing from given value, or R if temperature is  decreasing from given value.\n(Now to keep it simple and save me some time I kept the ratios as plain variables instead of the actual ratios of t/T and so on).\n\nMultitasking is another strong suit and one that drives people insane. I actually achieve a lot in a little time, but with that being said I'm also a STRONG procrastinator. But yes I do achieve a lot at one time for example most nights I have off I cook since its one of my favorite things. While I'm cooking I do keep my 3 month child entertained since his mother is usually not off work yet and find time to think about my \"problem\" of the day all at once. AS for relying on lecture? Strongly rely on lectures, its the auditory learning that I learn strongest from, as for notes not typically. I have bad handwriting and can usually not write fast enough to take notes and be able to read them. I take mental notes of picture and visual notes, and have an amazing sense of space, size, and dimension in my head so visualizing things in my head is also a strong suit. \n\nNow you take all the craziness from these posts put them in a book, and you could swear I was a double for the Mad Hatter. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400684122", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Look at any open chord on guitar and you'll notice the bassiest note is normally the root. Inversions use a different note that is also in the chord as the bassiest note, and let you get more interesting with what you're doing with your bass movement. \n\nLet's say you're playing some in progression in G and you want to do a 3-2-0 (C B A being the notes) thing on the A string. You *could* stick to what the key says is right which would be to play C major, then B minor then A minor. But maybe that sounds a bit too \"minory\" to you. One of the first inversions people learn on guitar is the G/B which in tab would be x2003x. This would be an inversion because that 2nd fret on A string is a B, not the root of the chord G but the notes are still all that of Gmajor. the notes of a Gmajor are G B D, in the example inverted chord the notes would be x B D G D x so it's rearranged. So now this opens the door to let me instead of playing Cmajor, Bmin Amin, to play C G/B Amin. I get the same 3-2-0 bass movement i was looking for but i can change the sound of what i produce and still stay in the key.\n\nHope this helped, i tried to keep it (semi?) simple. Please let me know if you have any question or if there is anything i can clarify.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400806315", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Man, I hate to sound nitpicky, but so many people misunderstand this.\n\nYour DNA does not determine your traits. It just doesn't work like that.\n\nEach strand of your DNA is made up of little molecules called *nucleotides.* There are four nucleotides in DNA: adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine. We abbreviate them A, G, T and C.\n\nSo a strand of DNA can be represented by a long sequence of those four letters: A A T A G G C A T and so on. (Please note that I just made that up as an example.)\n\nNow, the *reason DNA exists* is to *code* for protein synthesis. The actual sequence of nucleotides in a DNA strand actually represents a series of amino acids that get joined together inside your cells to make a protein. During DNA translation, a bunch of intricate processes happen inside your cells to assemble amino acids (small organic molecules we mostly get from food) into proteins (freaking enormous molecules our cells manufacture) using DNA as a template.\n\nThat's *all* DNA does. It provides the template for protein synthesis.\n\nYou do not have a piece of DNA that makes you tall. You don't have a piece of DNA that makes you fat. You don't have a piece of DNA that makes you smart, or a piece that makes you happy, or a piece that makes you good at tennis. *All your DNA does* is provide the templates for your cells to synthesize proteins.\n\nSo what, exactly, makes you you? Well, it turns out the thing that makes you you is an almost *incomprehensibly* complicated set of interactions inside your body. Your cells make proteins (or don't make proteins) based on your DNA blueprints. The rate at which those proteins are made, and the way those proteins are folded, and the ratios in which those proteins are produced, determine the large-scale structure that is *you.* So yes, you are the product of your genes … but in an *incredibly* complicated way.\n\nWe're just beginning to understand how our bodies work on the most fundamental level. Remember, it was only in *1962* that we awarded a Nobel for the *discovery* of DNA. Not for understanding how it all works or for figuring out all its various interactions, but just for *finding* the stuff! That was just half a century ago. That was *yesterday,* basically.

{"body": "So, you may or may not know that the height of a given note corresponds to the frequency of the sound. The higher the note, the higher the frequency. For example, the A above middle C has frequency 440Hz.\n\nAnother aspect is that notes grow exponentially: the A in a given octave has exactly twice the frequency of the A in the octave below, and half the frequency of the A in the octave above.\n\nMore generally, notes sound good together when their frequencies are an integer fraction of each other: for example, the notes with frequencies N, N * 3/2 and N * 4/3 will sound good when played together, while the notes with frequencies N and N * 1.21446241 will be dissonant.\n\nSo basically, a scale is a series of notes within the same [N; N * 2[ interval that are used together in music because they sound good together.\n\nThe usual way to create notes in western music is to cut this interval in 12 equal parts called semitones. If we call k = the twelfth root of 2 (the number such that k^12 = 2) then the frequency of each note is k times the previous one. And after 12 such multiplications, you are at N\\*2, which starts the next octave. This is called the equal tempered tuning. Using this tuning, several scales can be built, most notably:\n\n* the major scale, by taking the first, third, fifth, sixth, eighth, tenth and twelfth notes.\n    In other words, the notes with frequency N, N\\*k^(2), N\\*k^(4), N\\*k^(5), N\\*k^(7), N\\*k^(9) and N\\*k^(11). For example the usual C D E F G A B is a major scale.\n* the minor scale, by taking the first, third, fourth, sixth, eighth, ninth and eleventh notes.\n    In other words, the notes with frequency N, N\\*k^(2), N\\*k^(3), N\\*k^(5), N\\*k^(7), N\\*k^(8) and N\\*k^(10). For example A B C D E F G is a minor scale.\n\nThe advantage is that it is easy to create more scales: take an existing scale, multiply all frequencies by a multiple of k and voila! You have a new scale of the same type. The inconvenient is that this doesn't actually contain any integer fractions (those we said earlier sound good together), only approximations, so the notes only sound \"approximately good\" together.\n\nOther cultures use other systems to create their notes, and therefore other scales, many of which have the reverse advantages / inconvenients: they contain perfect intervals (integer fractions), but they cannot be transposed to a higher / lower key.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400858237", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 31, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Music theorist here. I'll try my best to explain this.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, Zarlino, in his 1558 treatise, was the first to note that the major third sounded \"happy\" and the minor third sounded \"sad\". He was also one of the first to theoretically describe a triad (a chord). So we know that at least by the middle of the 16th century this association of positive-to-major and negative-to-minor had been established.\n\nIf you go back further it becomes more and more problematic because  triads weren't written about, though they were certainly used (they just didn't understand them theoretically yet). It's also problematic because tuning systems weren't universal and modal practices (the system before tonality) often varied through time and location.\n\nThe oldest Western system of which we are aware is that of the Ancient Greeks. It's where we got our modal names, but they were transcribed incorrectly by Boethius in the 6th century; the modes we know today have almost nothing to do with the original Greek modes. Anyway, the point is that the Greek associations would not correlate and any associations that we do have would have had to have come from elsewhere at a later point.\n\nAnother interesting facet is that the overtone series naturally produces a pure major triad. If you strike a fundamental (C for example) it generates the following overtones: C C G C E G (or 1:2:3:4:5:6). The minor triad is not produced *naturally* and that caused a lot of headaches for theorists throughout the centuries. Rameau attempted to explain the minor triad through *undertones* (going down from a fundamental: C C F C Ab F). Of course, undertones don't actually exist--it's physically impossible. Eventually theorists largely agreed that major = nature and minor = art (that is, human created). The point here is that a major triad might sound more *natural*, less dissonant... and maybe that's why it sounds happier.\n\n**TL;DR: It's largely by association over centuries of use that we connect major to happy and minor to sad, but there could be some explanation in that the overtone series generates a major triad rather than a minor.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400871335", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You may have misunderstood the article and the concept of qbits. The no-hiding theorem states you cannot hide the information contained in an arbitrary qbit in the correlation between two systems. With classical bits   there are encryption algorithms (some very simple) that use a key to turn the original message into unreadable gibberish. An example:\n\nIf you take the words: \"This is a test sentence\" and the key \"crab\", and then overlay the key on the sentence repeatedly (like so):\n\n`C R A B C R A B C R A B C R A B C R A `\n\n`T H I S I S A T E S T S E N T E N C E`\n\n\nThen look at the letters in both strings as places in the alphabet, based at 0, so A is 0, C is 2, T is 19, Z is 25, etc. Then perform modulo 26 subtraction with each letter pair (this basically means subtract the letter in the message from the corresponding letter in the key, and if it goes below 0 wrap back around to 25). I'm not going to do all that by had, but the first few letters of the encrypted message are:\n\n`Q P H` \n\nand so on.\n\nSo, the point is, the encrypted message contains none of the information of the original message. None whatsoever. The key doesn't hold any of the messages information either. The information is contained in the combination of the key and the encrypted message (when you modulo 26 add the key to the encrypted message you get the original), the correlation between the two.\n\nHowever, with qbits, this is impossible. You cannot encrypt quantum information in a way that destroys it except as a correlation between other pieces of information. If you perform an operation on qbits such as the key encryption that makes the original information seemingly inaccessible without an extra decryption process the information actually resides in a qbit somewhere in the rest of the universe (perhaps the qbits \"used\" to perform the operation).\n\nThe \"immortality\" of quantum information is correct, but comes from the no-cloning and no-deletion theorems. And actually, quantum information cannot be created either. So \"you\" won't survive at all. The particles in your body and the quantum states of those particles are changing constantly, and there's really no way to partition \"your\" information off from the information in the air around you. Really all it means is that if you could see and process every quark in the universe you could (in theory, given infinite time and a complete model of quantum mechanics) figure out where everything was a second prior.

And learn your scales\n\nI'm assuming you are looking at ultimate guitar for tabs, the difference between their tabs and chord sheets are, the tabs are basically sheet music for guitar and will be the exact notes played, the chords links will be what chords are being played and you just figure out the rest from ear.

In fact, trying to even the playing fields by making it perfectly acceptable for a woman to be slapped by a man because it's more acceptable for a man to be slapped by a woman is completely ass-backwards. Just no. Stahp.\n\nBy fighting for \"equal rights\", we should be aware that violence against another person is not okay. Period. Male, female, trans, black, white, whatever or whoever. These factors should not play a role in making slapping someone okay.\n\nThere's also the fact that feminists shouldn't be advocating for hitting men anyways. How it's seen as socially acceptable is very negative for both genders.\n\n* For men, being slapped by a woman is often seen as \"justified\" or that \"he had it coming\". It does not matter what warranted the slap, but he probably totally did something to deserve it anyways!\n\n* For women, slapping a man is no big deal. After all, they are the \"weaker sex\", so what's the worst they could do? Leave a little red mark? It also plays into the whole \"women are irrational bags of emotional hormones who can't settle an argument without getting bitchy\" stereotype.\n\nSo really, the whole concept is a double-edged sword for both genders, so we should cut the bullshit and stop justifying hurting others. \"But it's okay because women can't hurt men and-\" No. \"Well, if society turns a blind eye to a man being slapped, then it's okay for me to-\" No. \"Equal rights, equal fights-\" N O N O N O.\n\nThere might be cases where you might have to defend yourself against someone. Only then do I feel it's acceptable to use some kind of force to defend yourself. Walking away before it gets to that point if possible is even a better idea.

AND here is why, my group and I as the good adventurers we are see a hallway with a T crossing at the end, we walk onto the end, and the first thing we hear are two monsters charging, we are fine with it because are mighty barbarian will slay them before there even close! How can I be more wrong, the two creatures are the exact replica's of him. We the group that knows his power, think simultaneously oooowwww f f f f f f. Before we could act they hit the barb and do massive amount of damage over 200 HP! And then initiative,  I regardles of my fear, will do the right thing and delay my self, the summoner summons, our barb makes a full attack stunning 1 and hitting the other for decent damage. I am now, I go onto the other side of a barbarian and try to hit the magic source that created him, I ranged it and did 17 damage. Then it is the clerics turn he heals  Meerko a bit and buffs the group. the not stunned foe is, he hits Meerko our mighty barbarian and he I Sht you not drops dead like Sean Bean in almost every movie he played in(no offense Sean). And the barb continues to hit our cleric, so 1 man down the other nearly I can't get the source down and the summoned creatures are nearly not worth mentioning! The next round the cleric goes out, I nearly can escape and the summoner can escape. So after 3 rounds: 3 down a wounded eidolonless summoner on the run with two rampaging barbarians after him due to invisibility and a escape route he can get to the material plane, but is way up north on the map so we called it good and counted it as a TPK\n\nNot to mention due to some unforseen and misread information on GM's side. I did destroy the first magic source and likely we didn't end up as the glacing on a westeros wedding cake. That said it where fun sessions and loved my character(s) \n\nLast but not least as quoted from our GM: the only way to kill Meerko is to have two Meerko's\n\nSorry for the long post, bad writing and the occasionally swearing, it was a long and rough night!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400914732", "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Say you have just played 50 hours of Call of Duty on Xbox 360, then you pick up some generic aim-down-scope shooter and you move using the A B X Y buttons and you aim with the left stick and shoot with the right stick. This setup would feel clunky as you expect a similar shooter to control similarly, and it doesnt offer as good control as the Call of Duty game does. Other times it is caused by several interactions being bound to one key, being unable to interact with the thing you want, or as you've said, noticable delay in the controls.\n\nUsing Call of Duty on 360 as an example again, people moving to battlefield might that the battlefield controls are more clunky because the controls are similar, but there are small differences because Battlefield requires more things to be bound to buttons since there is more to do/interact with in the world, there is also noticably more delay in the control, and to add to that there is the bullet physics(which I quite honestly think suck), making it more difficult to hit and control your character. Still, Battlefield was smart to make their control scheme similar to CoDs though, because say they had kept ADS bound to Right Stick (like I think they had in BF2) people trying BF might have had more trouble playing the game.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1400926491", "subreddit": "truegaming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

But for example instead of a hydrogen on the pyrminidine / purine it might have a flourine.\n\nThe cell's DNA proof reading mechanisms doesn't recognize this flourine as being a flourine. It thinks its a hydrogen. This is significant because that hydrogen further down the replication line has to be kicked off the structure and moved around. Flourine doesn't get kicked off. If you can't kick flourine off, you can't replicate that strand of the DNA and essentially terminate its genetic replication thus killing the cell.\n\nThe methods for this (base analogues) vary so widely and they're so complex that i'm probably not doing it justice in explaining just how awesome it is. There's something like 20+ steps in creating some of the base that our body uses.

{"body": "This video should help you understand the steps in a major scale.  You really should understand the construction of major scales before trying to understand pentatonic scales.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/c3abZ-aWF_o\n\nAfter you understand this it's just a matter of removing the fourth and seventh degree from any major scale to end up with a major pentatonic scale.  For Example:\n\nC D E F G A B C is a C Major scale.  The intervals between the notes are Tone Tone Semitone Tone Tone Tone Semitone.  You can refer to these as whole and half steps as well.  Now remove the F (the fourth note from the root) and the B (The seventh note from the root).  Now you have a C major pentatonic scale.  C D E G A C.  \n\nLets look at a D major scale now.  The notes are D E F# G A B C# D.  The question now is why are there sharps in a D major scale?  Here's where we go back to the intervals used in a major scale.  Tone Tone Semitone Tone Tone Tone Semitone.  D to E is a Tone, then E to F is a Semitone.  That's not good!  We have to raise it to F#, thus making it a Tone.  Moving on, F# to G is a Semitone (good), G to A is a tone (good), A to B is a tone (good), then B to C is a semitone.  We have to do the same thing now and raise the C to a C#.  Moving on, C# to D is a semitone and we're all good!  Now we have D E F# G A B C# D and the distances (or intervals) between those notes are T T S T T T S.  \n\nFinally lets derive the D major pentatonic scale from here.  All we have to do is remove the fourth and seventh degrees.  The fourth note from the root and the seventh note from the root.  Now we have D E F# A B.\n\nSo that's why there's an F# :)\n\nAnother question is why we remove the fourth and seventh degree.  The short answer is because they are the notes that have the most tension and really want to resolve.

{"body": "First off, pentatonic isn't a mode. Pentatonic is a term used to describe how many notes are in your scale....but that's just me nitpicking. I know what you mean.\n\nYou're in the key of Am. When you get to the E, notice the oddly spanish sounding way it resolves back to the Am. It's because in the E maj chord, the G is raised to G#. In the key of Am the standard notes are the ones in the A Aeolian scale. A B C D E F G...that's why Am and C maj are related...same notes.\n\nBut In an Emaj chord, you have E G# B. You raise the 7th note of the Am scale from G to G# to get a major V chord. \n\nAlso, the D is going to be tricky too. A D maj chord has D F# A so be sure to play an F# in your soloing over the D instead of the standard F.\n\nEdit: you also called the E the major third...which it isn't. It's the major fifth. In A natural minor the chords go  i iio III iv v VI VII   (lowercase = minor, uppercase = major, with the \"o\" is diminished)...so that would look like Am Bdim C Dm Em F G\n\nSuper Double Edit: as /u/ChuckEye stated, this has elements of Melodic minor in it too. I can't specifically label it any certain type of minor because it has elements of all 3 in it. It's not necessarily melodic because of the chromatic bass movement in the first 3 chords listed and it's certainly not explicitly natural with the raised 6 and 7 scale degrees that make for the D major and the E major. And of course it's not harmonic either with the raised 6.\n\nWhat I WOULD label this as is: music. Plain and simple. Figure out the notes of each chord and figure out where they are in the patterns you're most familiar with and noodle around.

{"body": "Well really it came from jazz. The standard A A B A form was revised into what you see now \n\n\"A\" being the verses and \"B\" being the chorus. As far as the solo goes that also comes from the jazz tradition of improvising over the chords throughout the progression. \n\nSo imagine \"A\" is 8 bars of d minor then \"B\" is 8 bars of Eb minor. This is the song \"so what\" by Miles Davis (or impressions by John Coltrane) however jazz artists would usually solo throughout the whole 32 bar form where instead rock musicians would only solo over the first two \"A\" sections and then come back for the chorus an then end the song. \n\nThe idea of the elongated form with different changes and other sections came from big band arrangers making the simple standard 32 bar form into somethin longer that doesn't just repeat like a loop. This meant adding intros outro's and different solo sections, bridges and interludes. This is what would carry over into rock when it started the Beatles are the most obvious example of a band that lies right within the time where jazz started to become rock. They pretty much paved the way for what would eventually be considered standard rock form\n\nThe reason blues was mentioned In the previous section is because it was among the most common type of chord progressions to use when rock was taking off. Blues has existed in jazz forever and has always been a very popular style to play in. And I'm not talking about Eric Clapton style blues, I'm talking about mostly anything that revolves around a 12 bar 1 4 5 progression. There are about a thousand different ways to play a blues.

{"body": "Title: **Dark Times**\n\n\n**Tag**\n\n*We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.*\n\n\n**Genre**: Open World Action RPG\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**Cover Art**](http://i.imgur.com/bPuFJSb.png)\n\n[**Full Cover**](http://i.imgur.com/fGsmWiM.png)\n\n[**Disc Art**](http://i.imgur.com/GJ1K3L6.png)\n\n**Plot** \n\nThese are dark times indeed. It’s been nearly a century since the fall of the Dark Lord Voldemort at the hand of the boy wizard Harry Potter. The Death Knights (formerly Death Eaters) have reorganized under a new master, who namelessly leads from the shadows. The world is still in the throes of war between his followers, and those who believe in wizard equality no matter your bloodline. You are a boy/girl, who just graduated top of your class from one of the eleven wizarding schools around the world (school selection is based on your systems geo-location). Being top of your class in school, your high notoriety has earned you the attention of both the Auror's division of the Ministry's DMLE (Department of Magical Law Enforcement) as well as the Death Knights. Complete requests given by wizards to earn money, and favor with the side they are aligned. Gain fame amoung you peers and climb the ranks of the Death Knights or the DMLE. Become one of the most powerful wizards/witches ever and end the war once and for all. Follow in the footsteps of the Dark Lord, crush the muggle sympathizers and rule as the new dark lord. Fight against the forces and bring about a new era of peace as the savior of the entire world. Or just venture off on your own to tame and train dragons. Make your choice, and become the wizard you were born to be!\n\nThe game weighs heavily on freedom of choice for the player. Seek out a job with the Ministry's DMLE (Department of Magical Law Enforcement) or join the underbelly of wizarding society and become a Death Knight. Players will be approached by members of both sides of the wizarding world, and how you choose to deal with these encounters/requests will change how that group views you, as a friend or foe. A reputation for helping people will make you a target for the Death Knights, while a great enough reputation for evil deeds against others could earn you a spot on the Ministry’s most wanted list.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Opening cutscene**\n\nThe camera flows into the window of a wizarding school graduation. Rows of students fill the hall. Magical decorations are zipping around exploding, making a muffled racket as the head master makes a speech. When they are finished, all the flying, banging and swirling objects in the air freeze in time and space. The room falls quiet and names begin to be called. Students file across the stage and collect  their certificate. The camera pans with a girls face looking into the crowd. Shot of her mother beaming at her from audience. Next, a pan of a boy with a wicked sneer looking out is shown. Cut to his father, dressed in all black, face tattooed with apparent marks of dark magic and a stone expression looking on. An overhead view of the parents, a clear division in the seating between people all in black and those dressed in formal outfits. There is tension shown through cuts of dirty looks back and forth. A slow pan back as the final students are exiting the stage and returning to their seats. The headmaster addresses the students about their role in shaping the future and ends with “What you do from here, is entirely up to you”. Pan up as the decorations resume with fireworks going off and streamers and confetti filling the air. Light through the above window catches the camera and fades to white.\n\n\n**Mechanics**\n\nFollowing the cut scene, the player is placed in the character customization system. Change your characters appearance, choose your clothing, the makeup of your wand (length, wood type, core), and select which major and minor courses of study you had in school (think college degrees). This will determine your starting attributes and abilities. All players with start with a certain set of defense spells, potions, and items (wand, broom, potions book, money)\n\n**A sampling of the available courses of study**\n\n**Dark Arts Defense**: Player has increased attack damage from the get go as well as a few additional offensive spells. Learning of new spells will also come easier to players that choose this course of study. \n\n\n**Herbology**: Player will start with a book of all plants available in the game, their uses, and will have the ability to spot useful plants nearby (similar to Tomb Raider’s Survival Instinct). This could be very useful in a pinch.\n\n\n**History of Magical Artifacts**: Player with start with ability to barter at all item shops. All items wielded by player will have more affect than normal.\n\n\n**Potions**: Player will start with extra various potions, including flu powder as well as extra recipes in the player’s potions book. This selection will also reduce the amount of ingredients needs for all potions.\n\n\nAfter the character customization is complete you are free to explore the world as you see fit. A non-forceful campaign will move forward towards several possible endings as you complete different objectives. You will be able to traverse the world on foot, broom, apparation (once learned), floo powder, and in the rural country side on beast back (once tamed). \n\nSpells can be learned through finding books with the incantation or by seeking out experienced wizards/witches to teach you spells, for a price. Once the movements are learned for each, spells can be set to a quick fire list. Through menu, assign up to 4 learned spells to the A B X Y buttons. When dueling, hold the left bumper and the assigned button to cast while aiming.\n\n**BONUS** Kinect 2.0 will allow you to speak spells in the heat of battle and blast your foes with your words!\n\nFights/duels with any wizard or muggle can be initiated at any point, and you will be challenged through the story of the game. Successful use of spells in combat will enhance the effectiveness of that spell. As you progress through the game towards your end goal of saving or enslaving the wizarding world, new spells will become available to learn. Death Knights will teach you the seven deadly curses, while a Auror can show you how to summon a Patronus and perform healing charms. Know though that practice makes perfect, so don't expect to start beating down Death Knights left and right or storming the Ministry from the get go.\n\nLike spells, potions can be created by using your potions book and gathering ingredients or finding a vendor that's selling what you're looking for. The more times you successfully create a potion, the more potent they will become and the more the ingredients will yield. Potions can be stored in your inventory and assigned to a quick use list. Through the menu, assign up to 4 potions to the A B X Y buttons. Press and hold the right bumper and push the assigned button to use the potion.\n\nSince goblin coins can't be reproduced, you'll need to complete requests, sell the potions you make and the artifacts you find, or just rob people to earn money. Use it to buy new brooms, clothes, food, a pet, books, a house, and more.\n\nThe game will feature fully destructable/repairable environments. Anything and everything will be at the mercy of your magic. Cause chaos where ever you go, or repair the damage left by your duels and wipe the minds of any muggles that might have seen.\n\n\n**Skill System**\n\n\nThe game will feature a trickle progression system for spells and potions. As you start to use your spells, and the more you successful cast them, they will slowly grow in their power and accuracy. A stunning spell that could only knock an enemy back will eventualy be able to petrify them for several seconds.\n\nYou will be able to create different potions by following the instructions in your potions book. The more times you complete a potion, your potion will gradually become more potent. Bought potions will be stronger than yours at first, but if you seek out ingredients and continue to make them, their potency will grow beyond any that you can buy, 2nd only to a Potions major (unless you are one).\n\nThe ability to barter will also grow as you make transactions, allowing you to get better deals. *Note: your reputation will effect a vendors willingness to deal with you. Don't take your Auror ass into a cesspool the likes of Knockturn Alley and expect to receive any bargains*\n\n\nThe master of music John Williams returns to add a magicial foundation to this amazing world. Seemless transitions between exploring and battle themed melodies keep you in the experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What the critics are saying**\n\n\"I yelled 'I'm a wizard' into the headset while sitting next to a muggle....nothing happened\" -Some guy that snuck into the media preview\n\n\"I have died everyday waiting for this game\" - Christina Perri\n\n\"This is exactly how I pictured this world when I wrote it.\" -J.K.

{"body": "Learn music theory! Your future self will thank you. Judging by where you probably are in your guitar endeavors (right about where I was after my first 3 months) I would say the best things for you to focus on right now is learning the different major and minor keys and practicing your scales. A great exercise for right hand-left hand coordination and picking in general is called coils. Running through a scale it looks like this (numbers represent degrees of the scale): 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 6 5 6 7 6 7 8 7 6 7 6 5 6 5 4 5 4 3 4 3 2 3 2 1. It's a pretty simple patter and will be a huge help with your technique. To clear up any confusion here is the first half of the exercise in C major: C D E D E F E F G F G A G A B A B C. Practice this until you can go up and down several different scales fluidly at a decent speed (should take no more than 10 seconds to do the entire exercise).

Many other languages refer to the names of notes in solfege syllables instead. So instead of C D E F G A B C, they would say Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do. A piece in D might be said in French or Italian to be in Re. In modern era musical analysis it's not uncommon to refer to pitch classes as numbers 0-11, with C=0.

{"body": "The musical scale was adapted and developed from what we had in the past to what sounded nice to the composers at different times. The major scale can be brought back to the pentatonic scale which has (in C) C D E G A C, this has no clashes and is characterized by the major third (C to E). This pentatonic scale is something that humans tend to sing innately and thus forms the basis for the major scale.  Adding in the 4th and 7th degrees add clashes and more flavor to the major scale as well as allowing modal movement in music.\n\nThe piano was designed with the C major scale in mind and it was made such that the scale can be played with only white notes. The reason some notes don't have black keys (or half steps between the two notes) is that they are already half steps. This is because of the way the major scale is developed from the pentatonic.\n\nI'll write the major scale in its step fashion form (T = whole tone = two semitone step. \nH = half tone = one semitone step).\n\nMajor\nT T H T T T H\n\nAs you can see with the major scale there are half steps where there are no notes in between.

{"body": "Here's a simple explanation that's suitable for a 5-year-old.\n\nLet's say you have a string and you pluck it.  That string makes a note.  We're going to call that note 'C' (for the 12-year-old in you, these note names came much later, after we already had the notes themselves, but we'll leave that for seven years from now).  Now, *lightly* touch the string in the middle -- exactly in the middle -- and pluck it.  That's C an octave higher!  What happened?  Well, when you pluck a string, it actually makes *a whole bunch* of notes at the same time, but when you touch it at that point in the middle, you make it stop making the note you hear the most, and you get to hear some of the other notes that you couldn't hear before -- but they were still there!\n\nThese other notes follow a very specific pattern.  C, then C an octave higher, then G above that, then the next C after that, then E, then G, then a very flat Bb, C again, D, E, a very flat F#, G, and so on.  All these notes have a name: the *harmonic scale*.  Whenever you make a pitch, you actually get *all* the notes on this scale, though most are way too soft for you to hear by themselves (for the 18-year-old who's majoring in physics: this is not actually true, but it's close enough in most cases).\n\nThe nifty thing about them, though, is that their sound waves *line up*!  That's because the C an octave higher is a wave that's exactly *twice* as fast as the C below.  The G is exactly 3 times as fast, the next C 4 times, the E 5 times, the G 6 times, the flat Bb 7 times, the C 8 times, and so on.  They match up exactly.  So if you play the C in the first octave higher and the G that comes after it, you get a sound wave that's 2 times the low C and another that's 3 times the low C, and they line up exactly as well!  But it gets harder to hear that lining up as the numbers get larger.\n\nSo people have noticed that the C and G have a very interesting sound together because their waves line up.  And they noticed that C and E also have a very interesting sound together (though not as strongly as the C and G).  So when they started to sing together, they would have one person sing a C and the other sing a G, or a C and an E, or eventually even all three together.  When they sang songs, they'd want to use all those notes in their songs.  But there are also notes in between, aren't there?  It would be boring to just sing with those three notes.  So they filled in some notes in between, but there's a problem: the space between C and E is wider than the space between E and G.  You can fit about a note in each, but while you can put it halfway or so between C and E and halfway between E and G, the spaces between them will be weird.  They realized too that while C and G have a relationship called a perfect fifth, where G is a perfect fifth up, there's *another* note a perfect fifth *down*, and that's the F.  That was nice to use too, since C and F have an interesting sound like C and G.  So that note goes between E and G, and it's closer to the E than to the G.  And what happens when you go up another fifth from G?  You get D, which is almost right in between C and E!  And A is a third up from F, and B is a fifth up from E or a third up from G.  There are other ways to make some of these notes too, and they don't exactly match up.  But that's basically it.\n\nThis system is called *just intonation*.\n\nNow, eventually people decided that they were going to make it so that the D was exactly in between the C and the E instead of just sort of in between.  They looked at the notes they had and realized that they could get a pretty good system with 12 equal steps (to the 22-year-old getting a master's in modern music, they actually considered other systems, too, like with 19 equal steps instead of 12, but 12 ended up winning).  This is called *12-tone equal temperament*.  But with the notes they had before, it turned out that some of them were closer to each other than the others.  When they made the 12 equal steps, the distance between the farther ones was two steps, while the distance between the closer ones was just one step (when they made 19 tones, those distances were 3 steps and 2 steps, respectively, but 19-tone didn't catch on at the time).\n\nSo there we go.  The reason for these half steps is that, when they made the scale and adapted it to 12-tone equal temperament, the scale had some notes that were closer together than others.  And the reason for that is because those were the notes that made the best harmonies and the best melodies, according to the Europeans who used them.\n\nNow, why couldn't those half steps be elsewhere?  Well, you know, they really could.  Back in the days of church chant music, they had many different ways of singing the scale.  One of the ways would have gone F G A B C D E F, except whenever they did it, they'd flatten the B so it would be a Bb -- but they didn't actually write that down for some reason.  This is called *musica ficta*.  So if we had used that -- F G A Bb C D E F -- the half steps would have been between A and Bb and between E and F.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401229309", "subreddit": "ELI5Music", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Go ahead and stick with stupid, it's easier after all.\n\nRegarding your o p i n i o n s, I will.  \n\n&gt;He went to Hong Kong . .\nYes he went to the CIA infested Hong Kong and was greeted by a seemingly fake crowd with banners. He must be such a super genius that no CIA field agents or Interpol could detain him let alone mobs that would easily kidnap him and ask for ransom from the US gov't.  \n\n\nGreeted with banners? What proof have you?  He went on Medical leave and hadn't raised suspicion until the story broke. Either you're trying to deceive, not knowledgeable about the back story, or privy to some info I haven't seen.  \n\n\n\n\n&gt; Right. All they've done is repeatedly call Snowden a traitor while propagating the \"leaks\" from the one source the government allows. A few powerpoint presentations marked \"top secret\" don't have me convinced.  \n\n\nA few? Your either trying to minimize or didn't look at the link.  \n\n\n&gt;Again, nothing new has been leaked. All most people are concerned with is that they're being watched and their emails are being read. This has not been news since the mid 1990s.   \n\n\nSticking to the same tired claim over and over isn't going to convince anybody who's actually looked at the documents/read the stories.  \n\n\n&gt;Powerpoint presentations marked \"top secret\" with crude graphics, and official sounding abbreviations may or may not be indicative of real NSA technologies.     \n\n\nMay or may not be?  Do you expect NSA to confirm this for us?  Are you denying Snowden took top secret documents?  \n\n\n&gt;The point is to LET PEOPLE KNOW that they are being watched.  \n\n\nHow is this the POINT? It appears to be just your opinion.  Your assumptions are just that.  \n\n\n&gt;All most people are concerned with is that they're being watched and their emails are being read.   \n\nBefore Snowden what else could people *be* concerned with?   \n\n\n\n&gt;Think about it - they lock up Manning but they can't touch Greenwald, or Assange while Snowden is free to move about giving news interviews.  \n\n\nWhat has Greenwald been charged with? Why shouldn't he be free? Do you expect them to march into the embassy and arrest Assange?  *You* said Greenwald, Assange and now Snowden *seem* to be controlled opposition. It's just your opinion.  \n\n\n\n&gt;Why does the MSM do anything? Simple answer - ratings and agendas. They are passing the message to everyone that they are being watched - this is really to quell dissent, help increase distrust of Russia, and to make sure that people know that whistleblowing will be equated to treason.   \n\n\nWithout any proof it's easy to claim an agenda. Should we believe *you* have an agenda because your post parrots others on Reddit? Are you one of those people Greenwald says Infiltrates the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations? See how easy it is? If we don't stick with the facts as presented we'll be lost in a sea of speculation.  \n\n\n&gt;By all means do so and go about your merry way.  \n\n\nI already said I would.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401308582", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

From what I gathered its a normal plant or living thing in which its DNA or genes have been changed manually. They do it on a very small scale of course. And one video we watched showed how. From what i remember one method was basically an air gun that blast the genes from a different organism into the DNA/genes of another, the scale being so small that the makeup  (base pairs of the G C A U ) get lodged into the original organisms DNA/genes thereby giving that organism whatever traits from the previous organism to the new one. So say you take a leaf or seed of a tomato plant and then get a deep sea jellyfish. You locate the specific gene in the jellyfish that allows it not to freeze in below freezing ocean water.

Looking out the french doors, a shallow valley half covered in sequoia ended in a cliff above a sea of merlot, wind breathing life into the water to transform the crests into silver linings.

Like you said, if I play a song with only notes from the A minor scale, then the song is set in the key of A minor?\n\nAs a general rule. Some songs incorporate key changes or modulation, where it'll be in one key then change to another. Some songs stay more-or-less chromatic, ie. they use whatever notes they want - this tends to be more often true in experimental music because it rarely sounds \"pleasant\". I love it but I'll be the first to admit it can sound fucking rough, haha. But working from reverse as you did in your last statement, yes - with a slight exception. If you were to use only the notes in A Minor you could be playing in the key of C Major, it depends on whether or not you resolve everything to a C or an A. Both have the same notes, though. Don't worry too much about this, it's delving into modes which get complicated.\n\n&gt;About the chords in the scale of A minor, I can see part of the naming convention. A C E is A minor as the first note played in the strum is the A note, but why is it A minor and B D F is B diminished? Perhaps, I need to understand the fretboard better to understand this?\n\nNot so much the fretboard as scale theory. Let's look at the G Major chord that comes from A Minor. It's made up of G, B, and D. These three notes - referred to as the root, major third, and fifth respectively - are found in the A Minor scale, meaning the G Major chord will sound good in the key of A Minor.\n\nHowever, the G Major chord is derived originally from the G Major Scale: G A B C D E F#.\n\nAs an aside, Major and Minor scales (well, all scales) are nothing more than patterns of intervals. All Major scales share the pattern WWHWWWH - W is whole step, ie 2 frets, and H is half step, ie 1 fret - and all Minor scales have the pattern WHWWHWW. If you take the chromatic 12-note scale and apply one of those patterns, starting from a specific note, you'll have that note's major or minor scale.\n\nSo basically what it boils down to is by sheer coincidence the A Minor scale happens to contain the first, third, and fifth notes of the G Major scale - the very same notes that make up the G Major *chord*.\n\nB Diminished works similarly. A Diminished chord is the root, minor third, and flattened fifth of a major scale. So if we look at B Major (B C# D# E F# G# A#), take the first third and fifth notes (B D# F#), change the current major third (called so because it's the **third** note of the **major* scale) to a minor third (same idea, it goes down half a step to D) and flatten the fifth (from F# to F) we have B Dim, B D F. Which, again by coincidence, happens to be within the A Minor scale.\n\nAs you can conclude, these music theory \"rules\" aren't rules at all, but rather explanations. Some arbitrary decisions were made (ie what defines a major scale), but from there on out it's all an explanation of why these chords happen to work together (Going from an A Minor to an E Minor sounds good because all the notes that make them up are in the same set of notes that we've already decided sound good together, ie. a scale!).\n\n&gt;I try to live life by the mantra that \"there is SOMETHING to be learnt from EVERYTHING!\", so please feel free to shower me with whatever you wish to! I am eager to learn! :)\n\nHow some people DON'T live like this is beyond me!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401382167", "subreddit": "rocksmith", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Kass's play style has a lot of choices in it that you can take to be as effective as possible each game. I will go over skill progression, item builds, runes and gameplay tactics/combos:\n\nRunes:\n\nI have 2 kass/ap mid rune sets: \nRune page 1 (AP MID MR): Scaling HP yellows, 4 flat 5 scaling mr blues, hybrid pen reds and AP quints. I use this if their mid is ap\n\nRune page 2 (AP MID NO MR): Same as above except scaling ap blues. Use this when they have 3 or more ad and the mid is ad.\n\nItem Builds:\n\nKass has a few choices as far as builds go but I typically make the same choices each game in the end.\n\nYou finish ROA asap, dont build anything else until its done. Then get Ionian boots next, no exceptions. Once you have these its about the enemy comp, do they have an enemy ap laner with a positive KDA? I would get a neg cloak. If their ap mid laner stomped you and is fed, build that right into an abyssal. Otherwise, finish your core items off with iceborn guantlet. I cannot emphasize hwo important the IBG is. Usually once kass gets those three items, roa, cdr boots and ibg he is an unstoppable perma slowing tank.\n\nIf they have 3 or mroe AD champs AND you won lane against the enemy ap mid then build a frozen heart then get rabadon/abyssal depending on enemy comp.\n\nI highly suggest not following the tear path. Just stay away from it I have not had any success with it.\n\nEssentially the build path goes:\n\nStart: Flask + pots OR Doran ring and pots (if and only if you have a favorable matchup)\n\nFirst back: get that catalyst and dont buy any more pots the flask and catalyst will be enough and if its a DR start you prob dont need sustain.\n\nFinish RoA &gt; Ionian Boots &gt; IBG or AssScepter &gt; FH or IBG (if you got assscepter first) &gt; FH or Assscepter ( dont get the scepter if they dont have much ap though) &gt; Rabadon's &gt; Zhonya?\n\nLet me explain somethign here: once you get ROA CDR BOOTS AND IBG the game is practically over I have had very few games where I buy 2 or more items after that.\n\nGameplay:\n\n* Take Q first against ranged laners and W against melee enemies (fizz).\n\n* Try to use Q everytime its on CD against a laner that you trade favorably with until level 2. (trade favorably means your shield negates their trade) Make sure to cs in between Qs.\n\n* For when you took W, W whenever they are nearby, do an AA &gt; W walk away.\n\n* Level 2: ALWAYS TAKE W at level 2. Dont ever not, even against energy based champs that spam abilities. You WILL oom before level 3 if you do not get W at 2.\n\n* Level 3: Another choice, level Q again if you are still trading favorably with your enemy. E if things are even or worse.\n\n* Level 4: Another choice, if your Q is just losing you trades now because they have most of their kit, start levelling E for wave clear, peel and teamfight power.\n\n* Level 5: Level the same ability from 4.\n\nYou really need me to tell you level 6 skill choice? :P\n\n* Level 7: Max E now. No matter where Q is. Start roaming at 6 after clearing waves. R over the terrain on the map so that you do not go in the river that is typically warded. \n\n* After level 7 Max skills accordingly now R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q.\n\nCombos:\n\nIve noticed a few niches of awesome in Kass's kit.\n\n* First off, get into the habit of Eing FIRST then Qing. Second, wait for your lane opponent to use 1 or 2 of their spells if they dont not have just one spell to doom you (ahri charm) then R in mash keyboard and walk away: R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; AA &gt; W leave. This is the typical harrass. Make sure you dont do this with the enemy jungler waiting.\n\n* Second combo (safe combo): I use this tactic when the enemy has their spells or I otherwise need to be very respectful of their effective range: WALK UP TO THEM &gt; E &gt; Q and &gt; R AWAY from them. This is free harrass, make sure to always w minions to keep your mana up. Do this whenever E is up.\n\n* Third Combo: the CC bait. Does your enemy have a non-instant form of cc? Walk up as close as you can and E &gt; Q or E &gt; Q &gt; walk closer &gt; W. Stay absolutely alert for their signature cc ability because you want to R away as soon as you see it. Doing this can effectively negate the attack because youll be too far away to be caught before it wears off. These things work on just about any non-instant cc, even Lissandra ult you just gotta be fast. Now you have a windowof their CD to re-engage them without their signature ability, because you open with E it is probably almost charged again too (You E, then Q (1 charge), you W (2), they respon with spells (3,4 maybe 5?) You R away (6 and e is up)\n\n* Fourth Tactic: Defensive peel, if youre being chased or see an ally being chased nearby do not be hesitant to give the enemies an E to slow them as you run away. The e is instant and no cast time. I have saved many many teammates using this tactic. Also be aware that if you are playing with a particularly skilled teammate you may be able to turn the tides of the fight entirely\n\n* Fifth tactic: Low health and running from an enemy without cc and you are too oom to r? Try turning quickly for a W to refill mana then R away. This is tricky and tough to master. It is difficult because you have to identify when you are losign the battle sooner so that you can afford to take a hit or two when turning to W.\n\n* Sixth Tactic: The bait. This one is the best. Having less than 15% health in a teamfight almost guarantees a player to try to focus you. When they do let your team peel for you and wait for them to disengage. Once they disengage you R E W Q and walk away. I have picked up so many kills like this because kass has just as much effective damage at 1 hp as he does at 100% hp\n\nLast but not least: You have to either roam to bot everytime the enemy is pushed up or clear waves and wraiths without letting any of your minions get to your turret. You would only NOT roam when you cannot be away from lane due to the enemy having good wave clear. Once mid tower is down however you should always be roaming.\n\nI hope this helped\n\n\nEDIT: OH and summoners. I usually take ignite for a favourable matchup or TP for an unfavourable, even or unknown matchup. Flash always. When I first started maining kass I took heal to help correct mistakes I made such as engaging when the enemy had all spells up\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401386232", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

It will massacre gains from the strongest people, read a long article on it, several even, i read an article that said 80% of men under 30 that plateau havent, they are suffering from overtraining, testosterone (our holy saviour) (god i love it) has a small weakness in its greatest strength, the impulse to keeeep puuushin it. in lifting this can backfire terribly, it can actually cause a testosterone loss effect (probably an evolutionary safeguard to keep alpha males from killing ourselves lol) overtraining can cause fatigue, depression, irritability, excess aggression (not the fun kind) increase chances of injury, and worst of all, plateaus and loss of muscle mass! nooo! i used to, pushed and pushed and pushed more, got nowhere, then i asked a coworker that'd had an exceptional weight training coach in high school what he thought my problem was. he said i think your overtraining, you should lift less often, rest more.  i was like huh? *caveman voice*: but gog lift hard gog get strong so gog can beat other gog. gog lift less gog no strong, other gog beat gog. this made no sense to me. this did not compute. i tried it anyway. lifted only twice that week, high weight low reps used 1/10 the effort i usually put into it, i stopped lifting BEFORE i got tired. n you kno what happened? i got burl as fuck thats what happened. oh god if only i had figured this out sooner. a trainer at a gym had tried to tell me this before and i DIDNT LISTEN! that guy was a giant y didnt i listen!? i broke my previous maxes without getting out of breath, i gained more muscle, and best of all really, i felt better, not just healthier, but more energetic, not fatigued, not irritable, n well just plain felt badass all the time without dips that i had previously experienced.    take a rest, lift high weight very low reps, SLEEP more. and limit how often you lift. LESS IS MORE. MORE IS LESS. use your testosterone to lift the weight... but use your brain to tell your body when it needs to rest. dont succumb to the *push it push it* instinct or the idiots that think its the path to burlness. if your really shaky after lifting your wrong, it means youve completely exhausted your glycogen in your muscles and the workout will register as trauma and inhibit muscle growth. read articles on overtraining and how many young men ruin their workout routine with it.       -hope this helps, godspeed bro  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401455079", "subreddit": "Fitness", "score": -7, "controversiality": 0}

So assuming the original design is the correct scale, you should look at your rendition of it at the same scale. This insures that it is both readable and legible at correct sizes.\n\nI'd check and change the placement of a few things: the series of lines on the right side of \"of the\" are slightly below the center of the text, and it creates unwanted tension. Those lines should also be longer; look at the relationship between the set of lines on the left, and recreate that on the right. The distance between the edge of the sign and the word should be the same in both sets of lines.\n\nThe placement of the letters A R E A inside the diamonds need some work as well. The bottom of the letters are too close to the edge of the diamonds, creating unwanted tension. Bringing the letters up could cause them to look unbalanced, though. You may want to try a few different things for that text; I'm not sure if diamonds is the way to go. It seems odd that throughout the composition you are using lots of curves (ellipses, rounded rectangles, swoosh symbol, etc., and then all of the sudden want to have these really sharp edges of the diamonds.

{"body": "when I was a kid my mom had this acoustic guitar in the living room. She played once and awhile, noting great, basic chords D G C A E. She was at the original Woodstock with the guitar and strap so really it was a piece of history. I'd strum it and she taught me basic chords and how to play puff the magic dragon. My uncle played a bit and taught me Dead Flowers and Take me to the station. Folkey stuff. I always wrote my own songs from day one. It wasn't until I heard Sublime that I really got inspired. Never really heard reggae before that. Now I'm in my 30's and front 2 bands. One is Reggae and the other is Trash Funk Metal. I'm not a great guitarist or anything, but I make hooks that get stuck in your head for days. Some jackass took my mom's guitar on the 4th of july while I was playing warped tour 2001 and blew it up with a firework. I still feel the loss of that guitar once and awhile. I came home to find it in pieces in the street. He later apologized and didn't realize how important it was to me, but he's still a dick.

{"body": "/language\n\nThe heat shimmered and moved in waves down the dirty main street kicking up small dust devils and pieces of old trash between the broken down cars and smashed storefront windows.  Ferguson leaned against the warm, rough wall and dabbed his sweaty forehead with the neatly folded handkerchief before he caught himself and hastily jammed it back in his rumpled, torn Members Only jacket.  He pulled a dirty, frayed sleeve across his forehead to wipe away the sweat.\n\n“Authentic”, he thought, admiring his filthy reflection in the broken store window.  Ripped, faded jeans hung loosely off his waist, a grease stained shirt tail stuck out at his belt, neither of his shoes had laces, a thick gold chain dangled about his neck, and a John Deere gimme-hat was jammed backwards on his greasy head.  The smells of alcohol, drugs, and poor life decisions flowed around him like a sickness.  “How could people live like this?”\n\nFerguson continued to pick his way down the trash and debris strewn street, an old woman in immaculate evening attire leaned against the smouldering hulk of an old Oldsmobile. “Bitch muthafuka get that shit down my friend makes $5000 a week at home ask me how.  HOW!”, she spit at him, taking a long, slow draw on a long blunt.\n\n“I … uh … what the shitty fuck is up with your Dora shit posting kids dude?”, he caught himself and shot back, but she had already lost interest and wandered further down a side street.  “You are soo sooo stoopid”, he heard her yell at a fire hydrant, “L M F A O BEIBER FEREVER!”, before continued out of site.\n\nHis nerves frayed, Ferguson ducked into an empty storefront.  Stepping over the door half off its hinges, “7-Eleven” still barely visible on the dirty glass.  Shelves sat empty except for piles of blowing dust, broken glass and more trash covered the floor, the ceiling show signs of a fire at some point, and the occasional drips of water echoed somewhere deeper inside.  His shaking hand pulled the flask from his jacket and took a long sip.  And nearly dropped it when the voice echoed out, “First! That looks hawt! Where’s mine UR A GHEY??!”\n\nStarting back and stumbling, Ferguson caught himself hard, knocking a shelf over crashing onto the floor.  Mice and trash skittered away.  In the darkness he could make out at least half a dozen people.  One repeatedly smashed his head into the wall, “First!”, called the familiar voice.  The others sat or lay on the ground, mumbling incoherently, “ZOMG F@G”, “Fooking prawn!”, “I love this”, “Shut the fuck up”.  The mumbled chants grew louder and louder.\n\nHe ran.  He ran into the blazing heat.  He ran and he didn’t look back.  His chest heaved and burned, and he ran.  He ran until he stumbled and fell exhausted, kicking up another cloud of whirling dust at the edge of town.\n\nFerguson fumbled madly at his jacket, pulling out a small metal device with a flashing red light, “Control.  This is Ferguson.  Immediate extraction.  Repeat”, he drew deep, dusty breaths, “repeat, immediate extraction.  Long term exposure has resulted in chronic, debilitating brain damage.”  He got to his knees, “Recommend dust off and nuke from orbit.  It’s the only way to be sure.  Ferguson, out.”\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401487094", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; How do I stack roshans?\n\nYou can't. That would be ridiculously overpowered.\n\n&gt; I have really hairy legs. Do I use hair shampoo or body wash on them?\n\nJust water is often enough tbh. Legs are not smelly like armpits.\n\n&gt; How come in pro games, the supports carry gems? Shouldn't the carry take it since they die less,\n\nSupports often use the gems for counterwarding and carries aint got no time for that.\n\n&gt; Is there a max amount of times you can stack a camp?\n\nThe more stacks you get the harder it gets to stack again because the creeps block each other and don; t all leave the spawn box on time. Its hard to go above 3 or 5 groups of creeps.\n\n&gt; Where is the wagamama ta video?\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2ThdNK-0n8\n\n&gt; Is it efficient to leave mid lane to farm jungle camps? When to do it?\n\nIdeally you want to avoidwasting the gold and XP from lane creeps. Usually what you would do is burst the enemy wave with a nuke so you have time to go for runes or farm a jungle camp before the next wave comes. Also, pushing forces the enemy to stay in lane. If he leaves to contest you he misses XP and his tower gets damaged.\n\n&gt; When jungling lifestealer/doom/Lycan is it more efficient to die or get a salve/go back and heal?\n\nDepends\n\n&gt; What is Yung Lean's relationship to sadboys? He always seems to credit them somehow in his youtube videos?\n\nI think there is a song where they spell S A D B O Y S in the middle.\n\n&gt; Any good tips for reducing lag?\n\nTurn on the net graph and see if you can identify what it the cause of lag (bad ping? dropping packets? etc)\n\n&gt; How does the low priority system actually work? I abandoned yesterday and got no low priority?\n\nYou get low prio if you abbandon more than one game in a short priod of time. A single abandon is fine (sometime your net drops, you need to leave due to emergency, etc)\n\n&gt; How do I stay equally leveled and play from behind with Treant?\n\nFarm instead of walking around doing nothing. Be active early game in ganks and counterganks, carry a tp scroll.\n\n&gt; Should I get a mana item like soul ring or skadi to make up for lifestealers mana issues?\n\nProbably not. Try using your spells more conservatively because lifestealers really needs to get midgame damage items.\n\n&gt; Can I disable pings? I ended up abandoning after someone kept pinging me after I died for several minutes.\n\nDid you try muting him first?\n\n&gt; Can I make custom chat wheel commands?\n\nNo. Chat wheel are translated across languages.\n\nThat said, there is  a `say_team` console command that you can bind to a key of your choice and to say a custom message.\n\n    bind h \"say_team hello world\"\n\n&gt; Since lifestealer with brood's ult stacks is vlads worth it instead of other cheap luxuries like blink and Yasha?\n\nVlads is more of a pushing/aura item than a lifesteal one, IMO.\n\n&gt; Should I ever get butterfly on strength/int heroes?\n\nI have seen carry tiny get one every once in a while, to compensate for his low attack speed. Often str heroes would go for AC instead though.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401488412", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This becomes a pretty interesting question when we restrict \"operations\" to [computable operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function). This is what we came up with when we thought about which operations we could in principle (given an arbitrarily long time and memory) perform.\n\nNow not every function is computable. This is because there's [uncountably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set) many functions, but we want to have countably many computable functions. This is because we want our computable functions to be finitely describable. If a procedure has infinitely many rules, then we can never actually complete the procedure, so we don't regard it as computable. And it turns out any collection of things that are each finitely describable is countable in cardinality. What this means is that there are functions that cannot even be precisely specified. This shouldn't be terribly scary, since in the real numbers (computable functions usually work with natural numbers), numbers themselves might require an infinite description to precisely specify.\n\nThere are a lot of characterizations of computable functions, and it turns out these are all equivalent. Three notable ones are [Turing Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), [mu-recursive functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-recursive_function), and [Lambda Calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).\n\nEach of these can be said to have different fundamental operations.\n\nIn Turing Machines, the fundamental operations are something like \"Reading memory cell\", \"Writing memory cell\", \"Moving in memory\", and \"Changing internal state\". For example, given a number written in unary, I might add 1 to it using the following algorithm:\n\nIf in internal state 1:\n\nIf I read a \"1\", Move right in memory\n\nIf I see a blank, change to internal state 2\n\nIf in internal state 2:\n\nIf I read a blank, write a 1\n\nIf I read a 1, stop.\n\nIn lambda calculus, the fundamental operations are function application and function composition. Numbers in lambda calculus are represented by the function:\n\nTake a function f, and a function x, and apply f to x n times.\n\nWe may write the number 5 for example as lambda f. lambda x. f f f f f x.\n\nThen adding 1 would essentially be applying a function one more time to the number you're given.\n\nmu-recursive functions build up functions using the fundamental operations:\n\nConstant functions, which output a particular number for every input,\n\nSuccessor function, which adds 1 to a value,\n\nProjection functions, which return a particular value out of a pair or a triplet. So for example, there's a projection function that takes 4 numbers and outputs the third one.\n\nComposition, which takes a function and plugs it into another function\n\nRecursion, performing an operation some amount of times,\n\nand finally, unbounded search, which returns the smallest value that makes a particular function output 0, or fails to return otherwise.\n\nEach of these collections of operations could in some sense be described as \"fundamental operations\" of computable functions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401557005", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "~~Small~~ rant about logos/logotypes\n\nI'm in high school and used to do logos and overlays for SC2 organizations, really small stuff. I try to educate myself as much as possible about branding, marketing, etc. as to create better logos for clients. The thing that always bugged me—how many teams had similar colors/symbols in their brand, a theme that continues in D I G I T A L S P O R T S nonetheless. \n***\nTeams with blue in the brand/logo—[Newbee](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/6/67/Newbee_logo.png), [CNB](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/3/37/CNB_e-Sports_Club.png), [MYM](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/9/9d/MYM_logo.png), [Rave](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/2/21/Rave.png), [Liquid](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/1/1e/Liquidlogobig.png), [EG](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/1/1a/EG.png), [MVP](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/8/81/MVPlogo.png), [Zephyr](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/b/b7/ZephyrDota.png), [C9](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/8/89/C9.png), [Titan](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/0/04/Titan_esports.jpg).\n\nBlue is such a popular color, due to obvious reasons of it having a positive connotation and how it's VIP status as a primary color allows it to compliment other colors and be vibrant as hell. Some teams obviously it wouldn't make much sense to not have blue in the logo, and others have done a great fucking job at marketing the colors. The best example of the first would be how Team Liquid is called Team Liquid, Liquid=Water. Easy enough. With the later, EG has successfully made #BleedBlue a part of their marketing. \n\nI, through an intense five ~~minutes~~seconds of contemplation, have arrived at the conclusion that it would be easier to brand/market a team with a different color! So here is the [Titan logo](http://i.imgur.com/m5dWEvP.png?1) with some alternate colors. The new [VG pennant](http://static.ongamers.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/22/11049-pennant_vici_large.png) is fucking beautiful. No one else uses green and it works so well to set them apart aesthetically from other teams. You can do so much amazing stuff with it. [Invictus Gaming's Logo](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/6/60/Ig_logo.png) is really nice, but that logotype is horrendous, in fact the second 'i' doesn't even match the width of the connecting G. Rookie mistake. \n\nAside from color use, I don't understand why organizations pick the names they pick or accept the logos they hire (at least I hope they hire professionals) designers to create. DK's logo's outline looks like a rough draft in Illustrator with the red outline not being a consistent weight—not to mention how confusing it is. Alliance's logo looks horrible, maybe that is why they used it. Shit, the entire Dota community can identify [A]'s logo simply due to the amount of threads hating on it when it came out. Troll marketing at its finest. Damn, I hope some people come through and get these organizations to change their logos/brands to be more appealing professionally, especially Chinese/SEA teams. I cry everytime I see the [Orange Logo](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/4/43/Orange.png). Maybe organizers are just choosing designs based off of their preferred World of Warcraft faction or the most popular professional teams, but they need to chill the fuck out and produce some unique *professional* looking logos. \n\nBest logos, imho— [Mousesports](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/7/7a/Mouz_logo.png), [Virtus Pro](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/images/b/b8/Virtus_Pro.png) +2 for Russian team &amp; bear mascot combo, Natus Vincere, Evil Geniuses.\n\nRant over.
