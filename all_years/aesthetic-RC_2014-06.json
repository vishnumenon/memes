{"body": "OK, let's try this example. You're playing in C major (C-D-E-F-G-A-B, the major scale starting on C) and doing a jazz tune and it follows the typical ii-V-I progression. Over each chord you play a basic 1-3-5-7 arpeggio. Well, that sounds good, but we do need to know what scale we're using so we'll apply some theory here.\n\nAccording to standard theory the I and IV chords of a major key are major chords, ii, iii, vi, and vii are minor (well, vii is really half-diminished), and V is a dominant V7.\n\nSo our chords for this progression are actually D minor, G7, and C major. This is because these are the notes (which determine the root of the chord) that correspond to the related degrees of the C major scale (the notes in the C major key are the notes in the C major scale) and the chord tonalities (e.g. major, minor, dominant, etc.) associated with those degrees.\n\nSo, in terms of scale degree our arpeggios will be:\n\n* 1-m3-5-b7\n* 1-3-5-b7 \n* 1-3-5-7\n\nOr, converted to notes:\n\n* D-F-A-C\n* G-B-D-F\n* C-E-G-B\n\nBecause we used the associated tonality, all of the notes magically fall within the set that make up the key of C major. No errant flats or sharps to be seen. This means that our playing is *diatonic* rather than *chromatic*. These are rather complicated concepts in music theory, but in general usage *diatonic* typically means that all of the notes in the scale/chord/arpeggio are in the key (C-D-E-F-G-A-B) while *chromatic* includes all twelve possible notes; meaning at least one note played wasn't in the key. Typically chromatic passing notes are used sparingly to move towards other notes within the key.\n\nNow, for the moment this only works because of the specific arpeggios we played. Let's look at the D minor scale: \n\n* D E F G A Bb C\n\nWell, look at that Bb. That *isn't* in the C major scale, we just got away with using the minor scale because we didn't happen to play that scale degree. That's why this simplified method only works for simple 3-note triadic chords (i.e. bog standard major or minor chords with nothing else fancy in the name) made up of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th of the scale. We didn't use the 6th so it never came up.\n\nThe only degree of the key signature where you can pull that off is the 6th which is the relative minor of each key. So C major and A minor are composed of the same notes and this works perfectly. In this case, for the second we'd need to use another scale that has a minor tonality (essentially, it uses a flatted third degree) the *Dorian* mode fits here. Instead of a flat 6th degree it has a natural 6th so it fits. Finding all of the associated modes is the subject of chord/scale theory, something [I wrote a bit about in this sub the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/26uffg/what_theory_is_most_important_for_bassists_to/chvm8lm) if you're interested.\n\nBut, you might say, we didn't just play 1-3-5 arpeggios, we also had a 7th in there. For every simple triadic chord the 7th of the associated major or minor will work out correctly (OK, again, not really with the vii chord)... except for the 5th degree of the key. That's why we consider it dominant rather than major. The 1-3-5 triad is major, but as soon as we get to the 7th well... look at the G major scale:\n\n* G A B C D E F#\n\nNope, won't work. That F# doesn't fit. But if we play a dominant 7th chord instead that has a flat 7th which will pop the F# back down to an F and suddenly we're diatonic once again. That flat 7th is also the only thing that differentiates the *Mixolydian mode* from the major scale (i.e. the Ionian mode) so as long as you use that you can play up and down the scale to your heart's content without falling outside of the key. So when I said it only works on 1-3-5 arpeggios? I lied. As long as you keep this one aspect in mind you can arpeggiate 7th chords. Just know when to use a Major 7th (e.g. Cmaj7), a Minor 7th (e.g. Dm7), or a Dominant 7th (e.g. G7). Playing 7ths the only difference to worry about is with the 5th degree, it will be dominant, everything else will be major or minor.\n\nWhat this really leads into is a discussion of chord/scale theory and the modes. That's one of the simplest ways to find an associated scale that will fit perfectly within the key. I mentioned above that I wrote out something covering that yesterday in this sub, it's linked above.\n\nHopefully this long, rambling post gives you an idea of not only what \"playing in key\" means, but also *how* you do so while changing chords. In reality chord/scale theory isn't always followed precisely. A good example would be the 12 bar blues where, typically, *every* chord is a dominant 7th (i.e. I7, IV7, V7 or C7, F7, G7) regardless of degree. There it's more important to just play the proper scale for that chord, even if it breaks from the diatonic universe of the key; that way you don't clash with the guitarist playing a chord that uses that b7 while you play a natural 7. This theory is more of a suggestion as to what is likely to sound good rather than a straitjacket of rules that *must* be followed. The classic Q&amp;A of: \n\n\"What do I play?\"\n\n\"Whatever sounds good!\"\n\nis frustrating because it's kind of a non-answer. Theory is the helpful addendum of how to generally find things that sound good. If a song has a note or two that doesn't fit into the key it was probably used because it sounds good despite not being strictly diatonic.\n\nTL;DR: Playing in key means playing the notes that make up the scale the key shares a name with. Theory helps us pick out the best scale/chord/arpeggio where all of the notes will be in key. Sometimes a few notes won't be in the key and as long as they sound good that can be OK too.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1401631267", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 67, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If all these systems are capable of expressing the same functions, then set membership is indeed the most fundamental operation for all computable functions. The example of writing five in the λ-calculus as f f f f f(x) is exactly the way that set theorists (and all mathematicians) define the number five. \n\nIn [set theory](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Zermelo-FraenkelAxioms.html), we have things called *sets* which are basically things that have the potential to contain other sets.  Sets are written with brackets {} so the set of letters in the english alphabet would be {a, b, c, etc}. \nWe can also put sets *inside* other sets. For example you could write any location on earth as the set of two sets, one with a latitude and one with a longitude {{latitude}{longitude}}. But to do this, we would need to be able to represent any number as a set. \n\nTo write numbers as sets, set theorists start with zero. Since zero is so commonly used, we want it to be the simple and easy to write. Since sets are basically just things that can contain other things, the simplest set would be the set that doesn't contain anything. (Called the *empty-set*). Set theorists write this set as {} or ∅ but everyone else writes is as the number 0.\n\n\n \n\n\nThen they define the number 1 as the set of 0 = {0}= {{}}\n\nThen 2 = {0, 1} = {{},{{}}}\n\nThen 3 = {0, 1, 2} = {{},{{}}, {{},{{}}}}\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnd so on and so forth...\n\nWe can formalize this process as a function, like the \"f\" above in the example of the λ-calculus.\n\nThus all of the numbers can be broken down into strings of parentheses and commas. And moving these strings of parenthesis and commas around is all that anyone who does math ever really does, though they come up with more creative ways of writing what they are doing.\nSo the bottom line is that set containment is what most mathematicians would think of as the most fundamental operation, and that sets are the most fundamental *object* in math.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401647620", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

The solutions to that equation are the eigen-values of your matrix. If your eigenvalues are real, then you need to have n of them counting algebraic multiplicity (# of roots including repeats) in order to form an eigenbasis.\n3. For each eigenvalue λ, you find the kernel of (A - λI_n). To find the kernel you can find rref(A - λI_n) and then use that to pick out the right vectors, or you can do it by inspection of each row, take your pick.\n4. If you have n vectors at the end of this (sum of geometric multiplicities = n) then your eigenvectors form an eigenbasis. Woo!\n\nNow what an eigenvector of some matrix A means is that when you multiply A by an eigenvector the result is a scaling of the eigenvector by its corresponding eigenvalue.\n\n[These are interesting applications.](http://math.stanford.edu/~paquin/EigenLabDynSys.pdf)\n\nYou can always calculate determinants using Gauss-Jordan elimination by looking at the steps it takes to find the rref of a matrix. If you multiply by a factor, the determinant gets scaled by the same factor, if you switch rows the determinant changes signs. Say you scale by 1/4 to get A into rref(A), you know (1/4)rref(A) = det(I_n), so det(A) = 4.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401680545", "subreddit": "learnmath", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, it's sub 25 most of the time, but not always. The monsters that take the most time to me are Rust Duramboros and Deviljho, both at ~35 minutes.\n\nIf you want to use Thunder against Jho, Nether Maestral actually has better DPS than Sanctioned Sword, because of more raw and purple sharpness, but I recommend Dirty Graf for that nice poison. My Dirty Graf set is [this one](http://mhag.info/mhtrig/viewset.htm?s=dirty%20graf%20:%20G.B.H.230.1.66.C.234.1.95.A.227.1.95.W.229.2.56.95.L.233.2.95.95.X.1.90.Y.0.1.29.6.0).\n\nI'm lazy and pratically stopped switching weapons, I have been using Struxion Demolisher against almost everything with [this set](http://mhag.info/mhtrig/viewset.htm?s=Unnamed%20Set%20:%20G.B.H.288.0.C.292.3.95.95.95.A.285.0.W.281.3.95.51.193.L.291.2.193.193.X.1.95.Y.0.2.113.4.77.10.0). Agaist Jho it takes almost the same time as with Dirty Graf, but I think I get better times with slime.\n\n**Jho tips**: Abuse meats against him, always bring some tinged meat for paralysis and drugged meat for sleep (with barrel bombs for increased damage when waking him up!), IIRC you can paralyze him twice, not sure about sleep. If you are not using Dirty Graf, also bring poisoned meat for some free poison damage. Bring nullberries to heal from the occasional dragonblight, but if you have evasion+ you don't even need to bother with that since the dragon breath becomes so easy to evade. Go for the head whenever you can, like when you paralyze him, otherwise keep hitting his back legs. When he is enraged he takes a lot of damage in the chest, so try to hit there. And a tip that works for everything, not just Jho: Sharpness is really important for your DPS! You see that in both sets above I have Razor Sharp **and** Speed Sharpening. That allows me to sharpen fast and not so many times, so I can attack as much as possible with purple sharpness (white with dirty graf).\n\n**Combos**: Since you can roll almost anytime mid combo, I usually go for the longer ones. I begin with X X X X X A A A (weapon sheathed) or X+A X X X X A A A (weapon unsheathed), then roll and continue with X X X X A A A. You can position yourself a little with your attacks, so depending on the fight you can use that to your advantage and keep a really big combo, since the roll continues so smoothly to the upward slash. Underwater the combos are shorter, but the idea is the same: X+A X X A A or X X X A A. The fluidity of the combo gets kinda lost when you evade since you cover a long distance, so underwater I just use the combo, stop and start again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401745814", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Some clarification in the edit*\n\nDon't you dare give up on your kid, I swear I will hunt you down and do violence if you let our tremendously unfair system let your child down. \n\nFirst, make sure all immediately dangerous implements are out of every house your kid spends any amount of time at. I mean E V E R Y T H I N G. Guns, ammo, etc. If it's bad enough most chemicals and power tools too, you name it it will have to go. Rent a storage locker if you must. \n\nSecond, all sources of information should be spied on. There will be no privacy for this child until they are in the clear(though let the typical puberty things go, its a rough age to be in). Get all gun themed and related things out, monitor the internet activity, check their room and backpacks for nefarious things (plans to 'blow up' one's school, for instance, ask me how I know). Be as covert about this as possible, though, rationality will come later. My mom searched my bag and found those plans and I got frisked at the principals office.\n\nThird, psych ward. Seriously, it was the most difficult thing for my mom to do, calling an ambulance for a kid that just threatened suicide by holding a broom handle to his throat, but they took me and I was in for a week. The most important lesson from that was that I discovered I was not alone, that there were other people like me, peers of my own age. I even made a girlfriend who tried to hang herself 5 times and was molested in the woods(I think), but she never wrote back.\n\nFourth, be as comforting as you possibly can. it doesn't matter who, you, dad, a family friend, that this child is most attached to, let the kid have all the time they need with that person and make sure they understand what they are dealing with. It doesn't matter if that person doesn't want that responsibility, they must take it on because it can be as simple as the alternative of a dead kid. In my case I was closest to my mom and she was as okay with it as any parent can be.\n\nI am 23 now and I feel so fortunate that my parents - mom most of all - fought tooth and nail to get me the help I needed. It was at that age that I was in a similar spot, I don't think I actually would have been able to succeed in either killing myself or anyone else, I was mostly not in touch with the world around me. From a young age I was an ADHD kid, always disruptive, I bit my friend in 2nd or 3rd grade once because I was happy to see him(I don't remember doing that). later I had an incident where I threatened a class bully with a boxcutter, got suspended most of the year.\n\nThen I hit middleschool.\n\nThat was a nightmare, the worst circle of hell. Time has clouded my own perception, but it breaks my mom's heart to talk about it, so it must have been some kind of indescribable torture that time and a bit of antidepressant have whitewashed. I was a fan of coloring my arms completely with sharpie tattoos(which salt and rubbing alcohol do wonders to remove). I have no idea what order middleschool happened in, nor can I be arsed to sort them out.I went to a psych ward twice, once for suicide the other possibly for wanting to blow up my school or suicide. I suppose I learned that suicide will land you in the nuthouse so I changed outlets to fantasizing and planning a very military style raid on the school. I was trying to cook up all sorts of explosives to which my major impass was a lack of the availability of sulfuric and nitric acids. (again, monitor the internet usage). That also landed me in the nuthouse where a rather inept psychologist/psychiatrist  labelled me bipolar and a psychopath and then prescribed me with antisiezure meds as a sleep aid! Eventually I wound up on welbutrin which has been a blessing. I also was in a program called \"Face to Face\". I don't remember much outside the fact that it was a small (5-6) group of problem children vaguely like myself and we got to talk about stuff, I think it may have been teaching us coping skills. I think that was my turning point.\n\nThen I went to highschool. That may have helped as well since it was a new HS geared towards academics. There were no sports. I ended up being one of 5 white kids in a virtually all African American HS. This allowed me to not feel compelled to follow social norms, I could be whatever kind of white I fucking felt like, and I did. I suppose it was this aspect that cemented me as a human. I also ended up winning the \"most improved\" award at graduation.\n\nMy apologies at the potential disjointed nature of the comment, this is the first time I've really told that story to a wide audience I think. It got better for me. It was a hard road and I've fought like hell, but I made it through. \n\n**TL;DR Don't give up on your kid! Get them every fucking ounce of fight you've got and don't stop until it's done.**\n\nEdit: Perhaps I should clarify things a bit. I started out with things that were done on my behalf when I was at this point in my life. I am not telling OP to do any of these things, I am putting them out there for consideration. I can't tell OP what to do, she's an adult, and I have faith that she will do everything in her power to save her child's life, whether or not she she does any part of what I said. I also understand that there are differences between her child and I, things that didn't apply in my case may apply in Child's and vice versa. I respect my parents and I forgave them long ago for the various measures they took to ensure my safety. They never told me the actions they were taking because I was not rational.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401773235", "subreddit": "casualiama", "score": 8, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "IPv4 addresses are based on numbers from 1.1.1.1 to 223.255.255.255 with some that are reserved for private space like office that don't directly connect to the internet.  If you click on the start button, go to run and type cmd which will open a black window - then type \"ipconfig\" you will see your IP addresses.  It will probably look like the above format.\n\n\nIf you have a wireless router it will probably be something like 192.168.x.x.\n\n\nBut we are running out of IPv4 addresses.  Quickly.  So in the 1990's IPv6 was introduced, but wasn't adopted very quickly.  Folks found bandaids to get around the lack of v4 addresses.\n\n\nWith IPv4 there are about 4 billion IP addresses, which sounds like plenty.  But its not.  Think of every internet connected device you have.  PC, smartphone, tablet.  Now think of television - almost every channel has an IP address now too.  Imagine an IP address for every channel in every television market.  New York city.  Dallas.  Detroit.  Miami.  LA.  Casper, Wyoming.  Then add in video on demand, and every one of those servers has an IP address too.  And every interface that connects every device uses at least two IP addresses.\n\n\nWell, we're running out of bandaids so the world is being forced into using IPv6.  IPv6 uses hexadecimal numbers (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F) instead of \"Normal\" numbers  from 0-9.  So with IPv4 there are about 4,000,000,000 addresses.  With IPv6, you could not only give every carton of milk, every egg and every hamburger its own, unique and disposable address - but you could give every blade of grass on the planet an IP address.  Well assuming you could hook it up to a computer.  With IPv6 you have a total of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses available.  But to get that number into a \"Usable\" format, you have to use letters and numbers.\n\n\nBy \"Usable\" this is my IP address - which looks fairly cryptic 2001:0:5ef5:79fd:380a:2e03:e7f7:fdca.  But for someone with dyscalculia it is a lot easier to read because it is broken into numbers and letters.  I'm not really sure that dyscalculia is exactly what I have, but I tend to see numbers like 68 and 86 as the same number.  And I will stare at them over and over and until someone else looks at it for me and points it out - I will be unable to see the difference.\n\n\n[A really nice ELI5](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ewwrs/eli5_the_difference_between_ipv4_and_ipv6/ca4l1uy) helps explain it a bit better than I can.\n\n\nAnd there is your computer class for the day.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401807541", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If we decide that the center is D, and our scale is major, then the notes we're allowed to use are D E F# G A B and C#.

The shape you call \"C\", in standard tuning is really the notes C E G C E, which is a voicing of the \"C major triad\", which contains the notes C E and G (because they are the 1, 3, and 5 of a C major scale). If you tune the guitar down two whole steps, the notes played by that shape are no longer C E and G, but G# C and D#, a \"G# major triad\", or the 1, 3, and 5 of a G# major scale. This chord in particular does not appear in many common keys because it's difficult to sing in and difficult to play on the piano, so you're unlikely to ever see it ever again. \n\nWould you like to learn a bit of music theory? Remember how I said that the C major triad is formed by the 1st, 3rd, and 5th of the C major scale? We call this chord the **I** (one), or **tonic**. There are other chords in this scale, and they all have different functions. \n\nIf you take the 5th, 7th, and 2nd (or 9th, if you prefer), you get the **V** or **dominant**.  The dominant chord in C is G major.  The Dominant is the second most important chord in any piece of music, because it \"leads to\" the tonic. Go ahead and play an open C chord, and then an open G chord, and then an open C chord again. You should feel a tension when you hit the G major, and a resolution when you return to C. \n\nIf you take the 4th, 6th, and octave, you get the **IV** chord, which is one of two **Predominant** chords, the other is **ii**, the minor chord built on the 2nd. In the key of C, IV is F major, and ii is d minor. The Predominant chord is used to lead into the dominant chord. Go ahead and play C F G C, or C dm G C. \n\nThere are lots of tricks you can do inbetween those chords and leading up to them, but this progression, I ii/IV V I is the basis of all western music since homophony (music based on chords) was invented in the time of Bach.

{"body": "ok well,\n\ni think wukong is actually an easy lane. he doesnt really do much. you can poke him, he has no sustain, if he jumps u im pretty sure you outtrade him anyway (if your cd's are up). even if he uses W you can just back off and run around or juts hammerform Q W the clone as soon as it pops up and you will get the aoe dmg on him anyway. with this matchup its very brawly so you want to be aware of the minions (do not fight wukong+20000 minion army)\n\nYorick is an annoying pick, hes an annoying lane bully with sustain and no escape. basically you want to play this pretty aggressively in the start by harassing him forcing him to focus on csing instead of harassing you to a pulp. when he does unleash loads of ghouls on you its best to run into the bush. in your item build i recommend getting many potions and tear+vamp sceptre early on to give you hp and mana sustain to win out the lane.\n\ni hate nasus too. he farms farms farms farms. even if i kill him many times he can roll over me at lvl 11 with ghost. my best advice is to be aggressive in lane at the start and really punish him, he is pretty weak in the earlygame. when you reach mid/late you have to be VERY careful around him. he can W then ghost and just run you down.\n\nRiven is a skill matchup, some really good riven's have given me trouble, some really bad riven's have not. To fight riven you want to play it pretty passive since jayce is squishy and riven is an assassin. when she jumps on you with Q E Q W combo you want to R then hammerform E straight away, im talking no delay just knock that bitch away. then what can she do? if you did it fast enough you ruined her combo and she didnt even get her W off on you. she has to run back to farming (while her Q E Q just pushed her wave) and allowing you to freeze the lane. in this matchup you need to be careful of your R cd. if you changed from melee to ranged a good riven will notice the cd on your R and jump on you before its up so you have no chance of knocking her back again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401834501", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First, if you're still a student, give some thought to a job that pays more than $150k. Or, make sure to add things to your FM repertoire - you can do OB, simple procedures like colpos, even some basic pain procedures like trigger points. Those could add up. \n\nSecond, $400k is a hell of a lot of med school loans. What happened?\n\nThird, the standard repayment schedule for physicians is 30 years. You don't want to do income based payments after residency, but you DO want to start making payments (on the income based scale) during residency. \n\nFourth, E V E R Y O N E has big enormous loans coming out of residency. It's not a big deal, you'll not even miss the money after a year or two. Just set it on autopay and forget it.\n\nFifth, working for a non-profit doesn't have to mean what you think it means. For example, did you know that the Mayo Clinic is a non-profit? So are lots of big health organizations. Working for a non-profit doesn't mean some inner city clinic in a war zone in LA. It can, but it doesn't have to.\n\nFinally, residency isn't that bad, especially for family medicine. It will be hard for a couple months, then you'll get used to it. Especially with work hour restrictions, residency has never been easier. That's a whole other subject that's not well suited for this discussion.\n\nYou'll be fine. Relax.

{"body": "Everything is ingame time via timers.\n\n - You didn't Q red buff, Missed free ferocity and extra damage on red buff.\n\n - Your not Q'ing level 1. Either do light trades (not highly suggested) or Q some damn minions, get ferocity. Don't wait for a last hit, just Q. \n\n - Level 2 bola strike, I'd prefer to have ferocity then W to heal but we will see how this plays out. It's not a bad pick\n\n - You get the bola, but your still walking up to cs, getting bola while the creep wave is pushing says, hey I'm going to sacrifice cs and let it push to my tower, while trying to pick up a cs or 2. \n\n - You have a trinket ward, you don't trinket ward the bush panth is standing in, then u run past the bush and panth jumps on you.\n\n - Panth all in's you with ignite, you flash, he randomly ghosts. This point you should take note you have a ignite advantage on him in an all in situation which is pretty huge. \n\n - 3:28 in game time, look at all that glorious glorious cs exp and more go to waste. Man don't you wish you missed out on a few cs instead of walking up instead of losing a siege minion + 9 other minions. Talk about a shitty return rate. \n\n - o did I say a siege and 9 minions? That other wave came too so make that a siege and 15 minions. Lost all the melee minions from that, only left with 4 ranged creeps, which 1 melee creep = 2 ranged creeps worth of exp. And you only last hit 1 of the 4 ranged minions You should really do the math on how much gold and exp a siege and 14 minions is worth, quite hilarious.\n\n - And when you returned to try and get those minions, you used your ferocity Q, all that built up ferocity went bye bye. \n\n - 5:30 in game time, 7 cs. We are starting to see a trend. 1:30 = first wave. 42 minions + like 2 siege minions have came to lane with another wave spawned. You have last hit about 15% of the minions that came. Most eaten by tower so you have only like 60% of the exp probably. \n\n - You killed panth at like 4:30, w.e panth was dumb for backing there, dumb for walking through bushes, dumb for wasting ghost earlier, dumb for trying to fight you while you have ignite and he is oom. \n\n - 6:10 AWWW HELL NAH. I DID NOT JUST SEE WHAT I THINK I SAW. This panth walks past your minion wave, jumps on you, and you walk away. When you have Q W and 3 ferocity? Like are we even playing league of legends right now? You step away and then try to turn which you lost all your spacing. Like shit walk up W auto Q, Q ruin his day. And your bola was gonna come off cooldown. This was bad. BADDDDDD\n\n - After that the minion wave hits your tower and your cs goes up 200% to 21 ! See how much farm u get for letting it just hit your tower.\n\n - 7:15 he still spearing you in a bush, it took you walking in circles like 5 times before you realized you should ward it, like you had a trinket and a real ward. Also if you werent behind (note pantheon is really bad farm too and nothing special item wise) I'd walk up and fk him up, your telling me a person disrespects you, Rengar by walking into a bush and trying to fight you? No way in Fuck I would let someone do that to me and live. \n\n - 7:30 o mannnnn 5 ferocity, what's gonna happen ! missed empowered bola. Much usage of that there bola. You kinda stepped up then walked away, I don't know if that's purely cause you knew you missed it, but it kinda leads me to believe you weren't planning to fight panth so its wasted either way. \n\n - Quick note, 0-1 ferocity Rengar is a Kitty. There is nothing to fear, You attack the kitty. Now a 2+ ferocity Rengar is a threat, 2+3 skills = empowered. Also note your not a threat if your 2 stacks and bola/roar is on cd. Leaving yourself at 0-1 usually results in a bad time. (Obv higher stacks is wayyy better especially 4-5. But just know your really weak with only 0-1 stacks) \n\n - Udyr ganks, panth ults away, think of how cool it would've been if you could empowered bola strike him. Also since your voice chatting, tell udyr panth has ghost up.  \n\n - 8:15 I think you used empowered Q, it gets stunned then u hit a creep or something, I rewatched it like 3 times wasn't super sure. But panth chases you, 0 stacks ferocity, can't stun and walk away, can't empower Q and abuse the buffs anymore. Was pretty unsafe to jump on him and empowered Q anyways. Especially since he has the whole shield and stun shield mechanic weakening it. (yes panth is a decent counter to rengar cause of this) \n\n - 8:25 your friend calls you your going to die, to a keen eye I knew he was wrong, but it was close, you were at 16% hp so 1% more and you were dead lol. (if panth farmed better it was a kill) But this was a slight tooting my own horn / proud that you knew you weren't dead, but was very bad you ignited, even if he stunned you your ignite wouldn't have been a kill, was a pure waste. \n\n - Know how I mentioned GJ about your farm shooting up to 21 before? 9 minutes in your farm 25....something broke at the farm and needs to be fixed. \n\n - 10:15 I ain't gonna lie, I spat all over my monitor, You were saving your empowered for a bit, then you empowered E a minion. I was waiting for something like walking into the bush, Jump, wait for him to stun, auto Q E Q W or something like that. Totally didn't expect that. your like scared as fk of this pantheon clearly. You pressed tab before this fight, panth has no kills, has 35 cs to your 26 (both mind you are less then the minions reached lane at 5:30 and its 9 minutes into the game.  Panth is not fed, Panth is far weaker then you at this point, Don't Q his shield, Auto them then Q.  \n\n - 11:30 trainreck. Your jungler says wanna take tower seeing its low, you say sure, you don't even go to tower and let udyr just die. \n\nSo yup! lots of mistakes you can indefinitely improve on, play passive at the start, panth does stomp you early and will \"semi falloff\" You also vs'd a pretty bad panth, there was a lot of capitalization you missed out on.

{"body": "I really like this keyboard. Actuation is a lot lighter than my Leopold, which is kind of odd because they're both supposed to be 45g. I did test my Leopold's keys and found them to actually be 60g. So if this Realforce actually is 45g, then that would explain the difference.\n\nBecause the keys are lighter, I've made a few accidental keystrokes, but I'm getting used to it. I really like the shape of the keys; I first became interested in them with the DSA Dolch sets that have been popular lately, and I spent some time playing games on my Commodore 64 to see how I liked them. The concavity is more pronounced than the C64, and there's no tactile indication for the F and J keys (well, T and N keys, as they happen to be), but it's not as big an issue as I would have expected. The keys are pretty smooth.\n\nIt sounds great. It has a higher-pitched \"thock\" than my Leopold. The backspace key is a lot higher-pitched than any key for some reason.\n\nBuild quality of the board is excellent. I would put it as just a hair above my Ducky Shine 3, as I couldn't detect any form of creakiness. The Ducky still *looks* better, though. I do think the Realforce looks better in person than in pictures, but it's a very utilitarian board, and the top bezel is bigger than seems necessary.\n\nPart of me is tempted to dye the keys black, but I don't think I want to risk it. There's no way to buy the keycaps by themselves, so I would have to replace the whole board if I messed it up.\n\n**EDIT:** I said above that the T and N (née F and J) keys don't feel any different from the other keys. This is false. They actually are more concave than other keys, but they aren't unique in their concavity. S, D, F, J, K, L (R S T N E I in Colemak, for those keeping score) are all deeper than the other keys on the board. What this means is that your first three fingers on the home row all have deeper keys to rest in while in the home row (A and ; aren't deep). I noticed this when I realized that the two middle columns felt different than the others. This is kind of an interesting way of doing it, but it works.\n\nAlso, I find myself often hitting ` instead of Escape.

END \nSUMMARY. \n \n¶3.  DURING A RECENT MEETING, CHILEAN SECOND SECRETARY \nCARLOS GALLO AND HIS WIFE (PLEASE PROTECT) PROVIDED \nPOLOFF AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR MOVEMENTS ON JUNE 3-4 AND \nTHEIR EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF EVENTS AT TIANANMEN \nSQUARE.  ALTHOUGH THE GALLO'S ACCOUNT GENERALLY \nFOLLOWS THOSE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THEIR UNIQUE \nEXPERIENCES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT AND \nCORROBORATION OF EVENTS IN THE SQUARE. \n \n¶4.  GALLO SAID THEIR EVENING BEGAN AROUND 2100 HOURS \nWHEN THEY FIRST HEARD THAT TROOPS WERE ENTERING THE \nCITY.  THE CHILEAN AMBASSADOR WAS HAVING DINNER AT \nTHE DRAGON SPRING MOVENPICK HOTEL IN FAR WESTERN \nBEIJING; THE GALLOS WERE DISPATCHED IN THEIR OWN CAR \nTO ALERT THE AMBASSADOR AND BRING HIM HOME.  TAKING A \nCIRCUITOUS ROUTE NORTH OF THE CITY, THEY DID NOT SEE \nMUCH EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLENT EVENTS TO COME UNTIL \nTHEY REACHED WESTERN BEIJING ON THE ROAD TO THE \nMOVENPICK HOTEL.  THE ROAD WAS FILLED FIVE ABREAST \nWITH MILITARY VEHICLES INCLUDING TANKS, APCS, AND \nTRUCKS FILLED WITH TROOPS HEADING INTO THE CITY. \nONCE THE GALLOS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS DIPLOMATS, \nTHE COUPLE WAS ALLOWED TO INCH ALONG THE SHOULDER OF \nTHE ROAD; MRS. GALLO DROVE WHILE HER HUSBAND WALKED \nAHEAD OF THE CAR ASKING THE MILITARY VEHICLES TO MAKE \nSOME ROOM FOR THEIR CAR.  THEY REACHED THEIR \nAMBASSADOR AND MADE THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR EMBASSY \nIN THE SANLITUN DIPLOMATIC AREA. \n \n¶5.  ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SQUARE, \nTHE GALLOS, AGAIN IN THEIR OWN CAR, DROVE TOWARDS \nTIANANMEN.  ALTHOUGH THEY ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL \nCIVILIAN MANNED BARRICADES AND PEOPLE WARNED THEM NOT \nTO GO ANY FURTHER AS THE ARMY WAS COMING, THEY WERE \nALLOWED TO PROCEED.  THEY EVENTUALLY PARKED THEIR CAR \nJUST TO THE EAST OF THE MUSEUM OF THE CHINESE \nREVOLUTION AND WALKED TO THE SQUARE VIA AN ALLEY JUST \nSOUTH OF THE MUSEUM. \n \n¶6.  THE GALLOS POSITIONED THEMSELVES NEAR THE RED \nCROSS STATION AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS TO THE \nMUSEUM.  **INITIALLY NOT MUCH WAS HAPPENING IN THE \nSQUARE AS MOST OF THE FIGHTING WAS TAKING PLACE TO \nTHE WEST.  BODIES AND WOUNDED, HOWEVER, BEGAN TO \nARRIVE AT THE RED CROSS STATION INDICATING THE EXTENT \nOF THE FIGHTING AND THE FACT THAT REAL BULLETS WERE \nBEING USED.  AS THE MILITARY BEGAN TO REACH THE \nOUTSKIRTS OF THE SQUARE AND SHOTS WERE FIRED IN THE \nVICINITY OF THE RED CROSS STATION, MRS. GALLO DECIDED \nSHE WANTED TO LEAVE.**  THE GALLOS MADE THEIR WAY BACK \nTO THEIR CAR AND DROVE BACK TO THEIR APARTMENT IN \nSANLITUN.  GALLO DROPPED OFF HIS WIFE AND DROVE BACK \nTO THE SQUARE, AGAIN PARKING EAST OF THE MUSEUM. \n \n¶7.  CONTRARY TO THE EXPERIENCES OF MOST AMERICANS ON \nTHE SQUARE, GALLO SAID THAT HE ESSENTIALLY WAS \nALLOWED FREE PASSAGE AROUND THE SQUARE, EVEN WHEN \nSIGHTED BY TROOPS.  HE SAID AT ONE POINT HE WAS \nSTANDING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF CHANGAN JIE, JUST WEST \nOF THE SQUARE, WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF TO THE REAR OF \nTROOPS ENTERING THE SQUARE FROM THE WEST.  HE SAID \nALTHOUGH HE WAS SEEN, THE TROOPS PAID NO ATTENTION TO \nHIM AND HE EVENTUALLY PASSED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS \nTROOP LINES A COUPLE OF TIMES.  ANOTHER CHILEAN \nDIPLOMAT WHO STAYED AROUND XINHUAMEN AT ZHONGNANHAI \nHAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.  GALLO GUESSED THAT SINCE \nMOST OF THE TROOPS WERE FROM THE PROVINCES AND DID \nNOT USUALLY DEAL WITH FOREIGNERS, THEY FOLLOWED THE \nGENERAL PRACTICE OF LEAVING FOREIGNERS ALONE.  HE \nALSO NOTED THAT HE WAS NOT CARRYING A CAMERA. \n \n¶8.  GALLO EVENTUALLY ENDED UP AT THE RED CROSS \nSTATION, AGAIN HOPING THAT TROOPS WOULD NOT FIRE ON \nTHE MEDICAL PERSONNEL THERE.  HE WATCHED THE MILITARY \nENTER THE SQUARE AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY MASS FIRING \nOF WEAPONS INTO THE CROWDS, ALTHOUGH SPORADIC GUNFIRE \nWAS HEARD.  HE SAID THAT MOST OF THE TROOPS WHICH \nENTERED THE SQUARE WERE ACTUALLY ARMED ONLY WITH \nANTI-RIOT GEAR--TRUNCHEONS AND WOODEN CLUBS; THEY \nWERE BACKED UP BY ARMED SOLDIERS.  AS THE MILITARY \nCONSOLIDATED ITS CONTROL OF THE SQUARE'S PERIMETER, \nSTUDENTS AND CIVILIANS GATHERED AROUND THE MONUMENT \nTO THE PEOPLE'S HEROES.  GALLO SAID WOUNDED, \nINCLUDING SOME SOLDIERS, CONTINUED TO BE BROUGHT TO \nTHE RED CROSS STATION. \n \n¶9.  THE TROOPS BEGAN A SLOW ORDERLY APPROACH TO THE \nMONUMENT FROM THE NORTH WITH SOLDIERS ON FOOT \nPRECEEDING APCS.  FROM WHAT HE COULD SEE, GALLO FELT \nTHAT MOST OF THE TENTS ON THE SQUARE WERE EMPTY WHEN \nTHE ARMORED VEHICLES ROLLED OVER THEM.  THE FIRST \nLINE OF TROOPS TO REACH THE MONUMENT AREA, PASSED BY \nTHE RED CROSS STATION AND IGNORED THE MEDICAL \nPERSONNEL AND WOUNDED.  AS A SECOND LINE OF TROOPS \nAPPROACHED, THEY CIRCLED THE RED CROSS STATION AND \nBEGAN YELLING AND THROWING STICKS AND DEBRIS OVER THE \nHEADS OF THE PEOPLE AT THE STATION.  THE MEDICAL \nPERSONNEL PANICKED AND FLED, LEAVING BEHIND THE \nWOUNDED.  MOST PEOPLE, INCLUDING GALLO, FLED TO THE \nMONUMENT AREA WHERE THE STUDENTS WERE GATHERED. \n \n¶10.  ALTHOUGH GUNFIRE COULD BE HEARD, GALLO SAID THAT \nAPART FROM SOME BEATING OF STUDENTS, THERE WAS NO \nMASS FIRING INTO THE CROWD OF STUDENTS AT THE \nMONUMENT.  WHEN POLOFF MENTIONED SOME REPORTEDLY \nEYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF MASSACRES AT THE MONUMENT WITH \nAUTOMATIC WEAPONS, GALLO SAID THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH \nSLAUGHTER.  ONCE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED FOR THE \nSTUDENTS TO WITHDRAW, LINKING HANDS TO FORM A COLUMN, \nTHE STUDENTS LEFT THE SQUARE THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST \nCORNER.  ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE, INCLUDING GALLO, \nLEFT.  THE FEW THAT ATTEMPTED TO REMAIN BEHIND WERE \nBEATEN AND DRIVEN TO JOIN THE END OF THE DEPARTING \nPROCESSION.  ONCE OUTSIDE THE SQUARE, THE STUDENTS \nHEADED WEST ON QIANMEN DAJIE WHILE GALLO HEADED EAST \nTO HIS CAR.  THEREFORE, HE COULD NOT COMMENT ON \nREPORTS THAT STUDENTS WERE AMBUSHED AND SLAUGHTERED \nIN THE ALLEY JUST WEST OF THE SQUARE NEAR THE BEIJING \nCONCERT HALL. \n \n¶11. **LATER THE MORNING OF JUNE 4, GALLO AND HIS WIFE \nMADE THEIR WAY BACK TO THE SQUARE, AGAIN VIA THE \nALLEY TO THE SOUTH OF THE MUSEUM OF THE REVOLUTION. \nHE SAID THAT FOR NO APPARENT REASON THAT ALLEY WAS \nTHE ONLY ONE NOT SEALED OFF.  FROM THE ALLEY THEY SAW \nTROOPS CLEARING THE SQUARE PILING UP LARGE PLASTIC \nBAGS AND DRAGGING THEM TO HELICOPTERS.  THEY COULD \nNOT COMMENT ON WHETHER THE BAGS CONTAINED REFUSE OR \nBODIES.  AT THE TIME, THEY SAID, THEY COULD NOT \nIMAGINE THE BAGS CONTAINED BODIES AND HAD ASSUMED IT \nWAS GARBAGE.  ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT ACTUALLY WITNESS \nANY LARGE SCALE SHOOTINGS ON THE SQUARE PROPER, GALLO \nSAW MANY CASUALTIES BROUGHT INTO THE SQUARE AND DID \nNOT DOUBT THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN BEIJING WERE \nKILLED BY THE ARMY ON JUNE 3 AND 4.

{"body": "Thanks!  \n  \nSo, first off, I did use Illustrator in designing both of these. At this point I normally wouldn't design type in Illustrator, I'd do it right in RoboFont, as it's drawing tools are wayyy better. But, since these two faces are basically made from smaller components and are on such a rigid grid, it ended up working out faster to design in Illustrator and copy/paste to RoboFont.  \n  \nNow, a good place to start for designing your first typeface... I actually think that the project that Pila developed out of is a really solid exercise to begin with. The project is one of Bruce Willen and Nolen Strals' (of [Post Typography](http://posttypography.com)) projects from their *Lettering &amp; Type* book. The basic premise is to design some letters using [these components](http://i.imgur.com/ohZ1dNl.jpg), where the components are placed on your canvas such that there is no overlapping, but you are free to play with scale and rotation of each individual piece.\n\nUsing those restrictive parameters frees up a lot of decision making, and allows you to quickly prototype characters once you decide your general style: wide or thin, tall or short, serif or sans or slab or something else. From there, I would start by then trying to take a crack at putting together the characters H A M B U R G E F O N T S I V. Here's a few examples of work that some of the other students did for this project: [1](https://www.flickr.com/photos/85835984@N02/12254705856/in/pool-micatype2014/), [2](https://www.flickr.com/photos/105680302@N02/12312186184/in/pool-micatype2014/), [3](https://www.flickr.com/photos/115515588@N06/12313441743/in/pool-micatype2014/), [4](https://www.flickr.com/photos/115797293@N07/12314389904/in/pool-micatype2014/), [5](https://www.flickr.com/photos/48316662@N05/12314300813/in/pool-micatype2014/), [6](https://www.flickr.com/photos/109420434@N07/12314113894/in/pool-micatype2014/), [7](https://www.flickr.com/photos/115877241@N02/12321999265/in/pool-micatype2014/), [8](https://www.flickr.com/photos/71327433@N02/12322754494/in/pool-micatype2014/)  \n  \nCouple of book recommendations that are more concerned with type and letterform:  \n- *[Elements of Typographic Style](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/)* by Robert Bringhurst has so much great info, but it's pretty dense.  \n- *[Designing Type](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509)* by Karen Cheng.

I don't know how to use the exponential function properly. How is a straight line the arc of an infinite circle? I understand the area of a cylinder is calculated by 2 x pi x r x h + 2(pi x r squared) but I do not understand how you simplify that. On a more basic level, I don't know why minus numbers multiplied by other minus numbers become a plus. I don't understand Rumanajan's theory.

{"body": "The basic logic of these calculations is simple: any team that does well in world football wins points which enable it to climb the world ranking. \n\nA team’s total number of points over a four-year period is determined by adding: \n\n·   the average number of points gained from matches during the past 12 months;\nand\n\n·   the average number of points gained from matches older than 12 months (depreciates yearly).\n\nCalculation of points for a single match\nThe number of points that can be won in a match depends on the following factors:\n\n•      Was the match won or drawn? (M)\n\n•      How important was the match (ranging from a friendly match to a FIFA World Cup™ match)? (I)\n\n•      How strong was the opposing team in terms of ranking position and the confederation to which they belong? (T and C) \n\nThese factors are brought together in the following formula to ascertain the total number of points (P).\n\nP = M x I x T x C \n\n \n\nThe following criteria apply to the calculation of points:\n\nM:        Points for match result\n\nTeams gain 3 points for a victory, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a defeat. In a penalty shoot-out, the winning team gains 2 points and the losing team gains 1 point.\n\nI:           Importance of the match\n\n      Friendly match (including small competitions):                                           I = 1.0\n\n      FIFA World Cup™ qualifier or confederation-level qualifier:                           I = 2.5\n\n      Confederation-level final competition or FIFA Confederations Cup:                 I = 3.0\n\n      FIFA World Cup™ final competition:                                                         I = 4.0\n\nT:         Strength of opposing team\n\n      The strength of the opponents is based on the formula: 200 – the ranking position of the opponents\nAs an exception to this formula, the team at the top of the ranking is always assigned the value 200 and the teams ranked 150th and below are assigned a minimum value of 50. The ranking position is taken from the opponents’ ranking in the most recently published FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking.\n\nC:            Strength of confederation \n\nWhen calculating matches between teams from different confederations, the mean value of the confederations to which the two competing teams belong is used. The strength of a confederation is calculated on the basis of the number of victories by that confederation at the last three FIFA World Cup™ competitions.\nTheir values are as follows:\n\nUEFA/CONMEBOL             1.00                             \nCONCACAF                     0.88\n\nAFC/CAF                        0.86                            \nOFC                              0.85\n\nTL;DR - FIFA points depend on who you play, in what competition over the course of four years, more points=higher ranking", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401960747", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I am not high tier, but I know a lot about supporting, which you will find helpful i hope.\n\n**1) Know all the supports by heart.**\n\nYou have to be able to know most important cooldowns of enemy support spells. (ex. Leona ulti, Braum ulti, etc.)  Except cooldowns, you should know exactly what champions do. All passives, from spells etc. This is very important.. because knowledge is power.\n\n**2) Aggressive / Defensive Play**\n\nDon't hesitate to ask your ad carry what playstyle he has. If you are an aggresive support like Leona, Thresh, ask him if you want to play aggresive. If his playstyle is Passive, then you just stay in bush and try to zone most of the times. Do **not** force plays just because you want to make plays. If your adc won't respond to your initiation, you will lose hp/mana or give an uneccesary kill.\n\n**3) Timing on Dragon/Buffs/Flash/Wards**\n\nYou know the drill: Drake 6mins, Flash 5mins, Wards 3 mins, Trinket (before lvl9) 1 min - after lvl9 2 mins, Buffs 5mins.\n\nAnother important tip is common sense! If enemy bot lane comes too late in lane then they probably helped their jungler. That means he started blue. If that jungler cannot gank at level 2 then you can inform your team that their jungler probably started red buff (if you are puprle side ofc). Giving that information, could help **your** jungler to counterjungle or steal buffs and then time them to cosntant deny the mid laner the blue buff. Top laner could also ward at the 3+ mins rather than at the 6+ mins.\n\n**4) Zoning in lane**\n\nThis is extremely crucial as you have to know how much damage you can take and give. You have to always look at the trades. As Janna for example you cannot trade effectively. You waste mana and spells. So all you have to do is **protect**. But as Nami you can harass effectively because your spells deal more damage. This is gained by experience, so you have to practice.\n\n**5) Decode the minimap**\n\nThe minimap is one of the most important *food* you can have! It constantly \"feeds\" you information about anything! Learn to understand when you have to go back, ward, ping back, etc. Since you are not farming, you have to *c o n s t a n t l y* look the minimap for these information and act accordingly.\n\n**6) Recall**\n\nAnother very very important thing in bot lane. You just took a kill and you both are with low hp. **GO BACK!** Shove lane fast and recall. Even if you are with half hp, the enemy bot lane will come with better items and can force you back, or kill you. There is no need to stay in a lane when enemies have stronger items even though you have more gold. Also another important rule: **If your ad carry goes back, you go back too. ALWAYS**. Exceptions are: you are behind in levels and need some solo xp, you have to protect the tower at all costs, lane is shoved to their tower.\n\n**7) NEVER forget your role**\n\nYou are the support. Remember that the whole game. Never try to go in and misposition yourself in order to \"do damage\". Even if you have Rabadons on your support (which is bad idea) do not get cocky and confident because you will die. Your role is to **PROTECT**. Stay next to your carries. They need your protection. A dead carry deals no damage. Therefore is your number #1 priority to protect him, no matter what your team tells you. If you think your carries have bad positions then tell them to work on it. Save your spells for when enemy Vi ulties your sweet Ashe. You are cute Lulu and you have to save your W to use it on Vi. Do not use all spells at once to whoever you can. You have to use them wisely.\n\n**8) Dont forget your actives.**\n\nThis needs practice. As a support you have 4 spells. Sure you can cope with that. But you need to be very fast with actives too. You need to be fast when Morgana stuns your ad carry. You have to use Mikaels asap. You need to use Solari and Talisman too. You need to use Twin Shadows and Randuins active too. And use them fast!\n\n**9) Help your carry farm**\n\nIf your adc is let's say Vayne, she will have trouble farming early. So you have to help her. That applies also to a lost lane that is pushed under your turet. You have to know your damage your autoattacks are doing so to help your carry farm easier. That is acomplished also by a lot of practicing.\n\n**10) Know the matchups**\n\nIts important to understad the matchups and the counters. **Never ever ever** pick a support that fits well with an ad carry but you have poor experience with that champion. Do not pick Thresh if you are bad at him only because the teams tells you to pick him. It is better to have a good Janna rather than a bad Thresh. \n\nYou also need to know the counters at bot lane. This may seem funny but a general rule is that bot lane is the lane where supports fight and make plays, rather than the ad carries. So it's a fight against supports. Both ad carries will do more or less the same damege. You are the one who has to think clever and faster than the enemy support and win the lane.\n\nSo learn the counters, read, get informed, practice a lot! For example if enemy team picked Leona (something i see a lot in low tiers) your team is like \"ok gg we lost bot lane\". This is **SO** not true. You can make very easily this Leona useless. And there are two ways to do that !!\n\nOne way is to pick Janna. This needs practice though. You can Q Leona while is is mid-air dashing with her E. You have to be always behind your ad carry but next to him, having your Q ready to go off and look at Leonas animation. Also your ulti can help against Leonas ulti.\n\nThe other way is harass. Leona is a very risky pick. Yes, she is the queen of CC and she is damn strong. BUT !! If Leona is poked too much in lane, she will consider not to engage because she will die. This happens because Leona goes ALL-IN inside the battle in addition to other supports that can help from a safe position. So if you take a support like Karma or Annie, you can poke Leona pre level 3 so you make her useless early denying her the initiation. But be extra careful when she is full hp and with ulti on.\n\nSo learn ways to outsmart the enemy support. Dont worry much for the ad carry early levels cause the support is the one you will have to deal with.\n\nAlso you have to be able **to accept** a \"lost lane\". There are matcups where you just can't do nothing but play safe and hug tower (ex. Vayne &amp; Janna against a Caitlyn &amp; Annie) In such matcups just protect your carry, never waste resourses to make harass and call for the jungler to help if he can.\n\nHope i helped you a bit. There are many other things to know as a support, but the most important is to **love** what you are doing. Support mains are awesome people !!\n\nHave fun &amp; good luck !", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1401962042", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The usual C way of dealing with a mapped lookup is to have an array like this:\n\n    array[] = {234, 768, 122, 775};\n\nSo array[0] returns 234.   If you're smart about your array parsing, you could get it to translate what you want to do.\n\nFor instance, if your frequency values for A B C D E F are 440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490 (not the real frequencies):\n\n    freqlookup[] = {440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490};\n\n'A' is ascii character 65.   So we can do:\n\n    tone(3,freqlookup[letter - 65]);\n\nYou can then follow that A will return element 0 (440), B will return element 1, etc.  You'll need to add some logic for lower case letters, and checking bounds to make sure you stay within the range you want.  \n\nI'm not sure how this deals with octaves, but that could be handled through a two dimensional array, perhaps?\n\nTwo caveats:\n\n1. You can use PROGMEM to store the freqlookup array in flash so it's not taking up RAM.\n2.

Here are some snippets from my last ten months of this work:\n\n# in a small business, you can angle to speak on the phone or personally to the decision-maker.\n\n# businesses that have 'locked-down accounting systems' -- perhaps 7-11 Convenenience Stores or even Jim's Global-Domination Lawnmowing Franchise -- will be too hard for a few years. The impetus will come from inside.\n\n# Big Business isn't gonna deal with us **directly,** and I gotta say larger organisations -- Government Agencies and banks, for example -- are really really really really hard work. I have been on the phone to one Australian Bank for 16 weeks now, and have only got as far as one unanswered email.\n\nH o w e v e r . . . there are ways and means. The 'light touch' might work here. For example, as an exercise, make a list of the five most likely early-adopting companies in your nation. \n\nOne that came to mind a while ago is Jaycar Electronics Australia. Why? Ahem . . . they are a computer and electrical goods franchise that imports massive amounts of their products. So, double whammy: they can cut fiat-currency-conversion costs, and their clientele are tech-savvy.\n\n(This is a good example of why keeping a file of links to recent positive articles about Bitcoin (sigh) and altcoins is well well worth while.)\n\n# Can we find franchises in which each branch makes fairly independent decisions? It would be a triump if, say, the Friendly Coffee Shop branch on the M.I.T. campus -- where every single student now has Bitcoin to spend -- were to undertake a superbly-well-mentored trial acceptance of a crypto. Then we could \n\n[mu ha ha ha . . . launch a bloodless crypto d'etat in the dead of night, and replace Drabcoin with CGB!!!]\n\nSorry. Where was I? We could then foster wider crypto acceptance in other Friendly Coffee Shops.\n\nIn closing, it's what I mentioned above about an 'holistic approach.' If you begin by thinking about how the adopting enterprise will relate to the crypto, then you're unlikely to make major blunders.\n\nThree: please can we discuss at length the notion of 'national chapters' for CGB?? It will be at least six weeks before the global fiat-currency system collapses. Meanwhile, there are so many approaches that can be 'woven' into a fiat-crypto dynamic in a nation: bullion sales, T-shirts, stickers, P-WIP micro bourses, pryptos, and all manner of 'barter-like' arrangements.

{"body": "OK gender examination in media is something I love to do so this will be long!:\n\n-------------\n\n**Female characters/themes:**\n\n* **Buffy, X Files and Xena:**  The 90s was pretty good for female characters on TV!  X Files was the first and pretty groundbreaking because it portrayed Agent Scully as a skeptical, stoic sort of character while Mulder was the more scatterbrained conspiracy believer.  Scully was an inspiration for many women at the time.  Buffy had a huge effect on female characters and Xena's sort of in a league of her own (as in there hasn't really been a character like her before or since).\n\n* **Disney films:** Mulan, Tangled, Ratatouille, Frozen, Maleficent and Hunchback of Notre Dame.  All have great female characters and well written male/female relationships (aside from Maleficent where the focus is strictly female/female).  Mulan is entirely feminist and overtly examines gender roles.  Tangled is good for different types of characters (Rapunzel is simultaneously a nervous ball of energy and a scared fragile teenager, the villain is ambiguous at times).  Frozen and Maleficent have patchy plots but are still perfectly enjoyable and completely obliterate the sexist standards set by previous Disney films.  Ratatouille approaches sexism in job industries and Notre Dame focuses on how three different men all react to one woman.\n\n* **Silence of The Lambs:** is a great film from any perspective but has a feminist element to it as well.  Note how all the men react to Clarice and how she carves a name for herself in a male dominated job.  Note the bad guys obsession and reasoning for it, and note how the female victim reacts to Clarice.  If you wanted to look into it further, there'd be a TON of essays about this film online, it's sort of a film study staple.\n\n* **Alien:**  Ripley is one of the most beloved female characters of all time.  I think she was originally scripted to be a male character but nothing except the name and the person playing them was changed.  So it's a rare example of a woman character written without \"she's a woman!\" in mind.\n\n-----\n\n**Male characters/themes:**\n\n* **Captain America 1 and 2:**  Steve is definitely the most admirable male character in the Marvel universe, and perhaps in recent film history.  I wish more men would idolize him instead of Walter White!\n\n* **To Kill A Mockingbird:** Another example of a man who men should aspire to be like.  Atticus Finch is one of the most iconic men in cinema history and for good reason.  The novel and film are massively important for a number of social reasons, the primary one being racism.  Another important film along the same lines as this would be Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.  At the time of release, interracial marriage had only *just* been legalised everywhere in the States.  Some really good interaction shared by the male characters but overall the film is mostly about racism.\n\n* **Iron Man 3:**  You'd have to watch the others obviously, I just wanted to make a point that this is one of the only mainstream films I can think of that actually examined male anxiety disorders and PTSD in depth and worked him through it to a point of clarity.  To do this with a superhero idolized by millions was quite a bold move IMO.\n\n* **Her:**  A very striking film, will stay with you for weeks.  Deconstructs the [manic pixie dream girl trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl) in a really creative, original way and shows how men isolate themselves by placing women on pedestals then driving said women out of relationships with them because of superficiality.  My favourite film of 2013.\n\n* **500 Days of Summer:**  Similar to Her, takes the romantic comedy and turns it on its head.  You may not like this the first time you watch it but that's the point.  It doesn't just give you what you're expecting to see.  A very interesting, unconventional film.  Both this and Her are examples of how men should N E V E R approach relationships.\n\n* **The Pursuit of Happyness:**  A true story about a man and his son struggling to survive on their own.  A really good story about an honorable, brave man.\n\n* **Brokeback Mountain:**  I've seen this film *cure* homophobia in people.  Takes a non-stereotyped approach to gay men.   Is slow in parts but is meant to show the degradation of key relationships in someone's life when they're not allowed to be their true self.  It wasn't aimed at mainstream audiences so view it as an independent film rather than the large scale Oscar bait the media made it out to be.\n\n----\n\nAnd I couldn't categorize this one but **Pleasantville** is a very underrated film that approaches societal issues to do with oppression, gender roles, racism etc in one of the most creative and interesting ways I've ever seen.  It will make you think about a lot of different things and sounds like what you're looking for. \n\nSorry, I know this is long, I'm partly aiming to become a film critic or journalist so I basically spend my time devouring media.

Before you flame me to death just read the whole post, before telling me how often you slept with my mum. I KNOW THE SZENE BECAUSE I DO THIS FOR MONEY, IN ORDER TO PAY MY RENT / FOOD. I AM SORRY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE LOOSING TO THESE HACKS. IM NOT GOING TO CENSOR ANY NAMES ETC. BECAUSE ALL YOU NEED IS 5 MINUTES OF GOOGLE AND YOU GET ALL THE INFORMATION / NAMES I WROTE DOWN IN THIS POST.\n&gt;\n&gt;Im gonna structure the following text in 9 little chapters.\n&gt;\n&gt;* ELI5 LoL Hacking\n&gt;* CENSORED NAME\n&gt;* CENSORED NAME\n&gt;* Accounts controlled by bots, and the purpose behind that.\n&gt;* Things that are possible with bol-hacks.\n&gt;* Things that are NOT possible with bol-hacks.\n&gt;* What advantages these hacks give you.\n&gt;* What advantages these hacks DONT give you.\n&gt;* What RIOT can do against this\n&gt;\n&gt;**ELI5 LoL Hacking**\n&gt;\n&gt;There are LoL Hacks who do things like AutoSmite, AutoHeal, AutoIgnite and stuff. Most of these hacks are reading memory to get enemys HP, smite damage, ignite damage and stuff. Most of the time this are simple \"scripts\" which gets injected into the game via a hacking client.\n&gt;\n&gt;**CENSORED NAME** \n&gt;\n&gt;Bot of legends is by far the biggest hacking communicty. You have to pay 10$ / Month to use it. Many of the scripts you inject are payed (Between 5 and 20$ usually.)\n&gt;\n&gt;**CENSORED NAME**\n&gt;\n&gt;Leaguesharp or short L# was a big business competition for BoL for about 2 weeks (It had the same features, but it was free). THEN IT GOT TAKEN DOWN BY RIOT AFAIK.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Accounts controlled by bots, and the purpose behind that**\n&gt;\n&gt;So most of you know this, but I´m gonna write it down anyways. Accounts are leveled by a computer who just random clicks / keystrokes to level it to lvl 10 for refferal-purpose (This refer-a-friend thing from riot.) Some Acccounts are leveld to lvl 30 and get sold to people who dont want to spend time leveling their smurf. Some of the bots who controll the account are smarter then others and follow you / heal you and stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Things that are possible with lol-hacks.**\n&gt;\n&gt;Everything which is NOT desicion-making or gameknowledge. As we saw with the cassio script going around, scripts can do:\n&gt;\n&gt;* AutoSmite / AutoIgnite / AutoHeal / AutoUlt-If-it-hits-atleast-x-enemys etc etc.\n&gt;* Auto Harras in lane if hotkey pressed.\n&gt;* Auto combo in teamfights. Basiclly you press SPACE in teamfights and it casts Q W E R perfectly for you. \n&gt;* Dodge skillshots.\n&gt;* Auto say SS and stuff\n&gt;* Auto Ping jungler\n&gt;* Auto Jungle timer\n&gt;* Auto CS\n&gt;* Auto Kiting\n&gt;* showing enemy wards / traps\n&gt;* Display enemy cooldowns for Q W E R D F.\n&gt;* Im gonna link a few videos to demonstrate it.\n&gt;* [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljS7gmRT4y4) - [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aACKwflcmas) - [Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPBydHGl6lc) - [Video 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEkGIGi6pe4) - [Video 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXgjFK1M9-E) - [Video 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYIX8WkroA) - [Video 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akr3U2WDl-o) - [Video 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ggqNTDlXg) - [Video 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cZFbwLaFns) - [Video 9 SHORT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdSDHGokhT4).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Things that are NOT possible with lol-hacks**\n&gt;\n&gt;* MAPHACK.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**What advantages these hacks give you**\n&gt;\n&gt;* Godlike mechanics (faker-level)\n&gt;* Some kind of map awarness because of auto-ss, auto-timer, and showing enemy wards / traps.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**What advantages these hacks give you**\n&gt;\n&gt;* Desicion making.\n&gt;* Gameknowledge.\n&gt;* When to gank / roam / take baron etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;**WHAT RIOT CAN DO AGAINST THIS**\n&gt;\n&gt;The client is named CENSORED.exe and injects lua-scripts and the CENSORED.dll into the game (leagueoflegends.exe).  20 lines of code can detect that. ITS NOT HARD TO DETECT IF THE PLAYER IS USING SCRIPTS / HACKS. RIOT SHOULD IMMEDIATLY DEVELOP A ANTI-CHEAT, AND PERMA-BAN THESE ACCOUNTS.\n&gt;\n&gt;_______________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Thats it for now, class is about to finish, maybe im gonna write down more later. I can go into more technical details if you guys want it. \n&gt;\n&gt;Again: I dont hack, I develop scripts for money-purpose only. I played against my only scripts in soloQ and I lost lane. I am sorry for all of you who are loosing the fun at league-of-legends because of this. If you pay my rent and food, im gonna stop developing scripts. \n&gt;\n&gt;To the mods: Please dont deleate this, this is a big thing and the community needs to know about this.

{"body": "In theory you have to carry yourself out of bronze. I have played in lower ELO brackets and tend to go on huge win streaks with minimal losses in between streaks.\n\nI wouldn't say don't play support though. My go to support for carrying games is Zyra, she's good enough peel for a poor adc and she has the ability to farm if he gets himself killed. Also her plants proc her Frost Queen's Claim gold on hit.\n\nThe lower the ELO you are in the more likely your opponents are to build offensively rather than defensively. This makes it easier for them to snowball but also much more vulnerable to throws and poke.\n\nZyra has some of the best AoE damage in the game in the form of her ultimate, E and Q - then she has some decent sustained damage and crowd control through seeds and plants. On top of that her seeds make you much less vulnerable to camping. Her passive is effectively a 250 true damage piercing bullet, so if you get on the enemy team's nerves enough they will make sure you die in the team fight. If you get all of your abilities off and they dive you over anyone else on your team, you are doing your job. And they will get annoyed by a good zyra. On Zyra I start with W for vision control, this helps prevent picks during invades which I find invaluable. I then prioritize E for damage and more importantly the extended root.  Max R E W Q in that order. My first 5 levels look like W E E Q E.\n\nYou should play whatever you do best at. If you consistently do poorly with the champions you play in ranked, but do well in normal, consider learning new champions. For example Shyvanna, Renekton, and Yorick are pretty easy to play and tend to do well. They win lane by simply being tanky and having good base damages. with the exception of Shyvanna they also have sustain. I main Yasuo (terrible against all three), Rengar (not very good against all three) Kayle (just got hit but is good against Renekton and Shyv) and Aatrox (okay against all three early, then loses if he hasn't farmed well during the first 5 minutes). As you can see, I am at a huge disadvantage in most of my match ups. If I first pack any of these heroes other than Kayle I am at risk to losing lane just by PICKING my go to champions. The lower your ELO though, the more likely your opponent will make mistakes. This means the better you are at a champion, the more likely you can win regardless of whether a pick counters yours.\n\nGold makes anything viable. The way you complete with Renekton is sustain and mixed damage. If you are all physical he will rush sunfire and simply outlast you. If you don't have sustain he will build tiamat and out sustain you and out trade you. Jax is a very good pick against Renekton because post 7 with a vamp sceptre he really can't push you out of lane. If you aren't getting gold it's only going to get worse.\n\nSince bottom lane usually determines who wins games if you learn positioning you can carry from either ADC or Support. Lucian is currently the safest lane \"winner\" to play. I'm a terrible lucian, he has a some unique mechanics. \n\nKeep in mind 89.9999% of people in Bronze are stuck in Bronze because they lack the ability to get themselves out. Still I do believe there are more effective picks at the different levels. Yi for example as a jungler. There's not many reasons NOT to pick Yi, he's one of the most effective counter ganking jungles and also a hyper carrry. He double as a split pusher with one of the best steroids/escape abilities in the game.\n\nSource: Last season I started in Bronze. After like 60 games I was in Gold 5. I jumped like 5 divisions or so and my win per match was rediculous after the first 10 or so wins in a row. Eventually you will run into someone who feeds on purpose, rage quits, or simply never connects. Do not freak out. Do not flame. Simply play, make calls, be positive. I ended up with three accounts in platinum in around 500 ranked games I believe.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402061137", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "After reading the other comments and examining it, here's what I've got:\n\nAs I noted in my other comment, this is clearly from a fan who transcribed it and I wouldn't expect them to have great notation, because they rarely do. I believe the errant note is clearly an F (down from the treble staff), and here's why.\n\n1. It has ledger lines above it. The only reason for those is to reach down to a lower note, otherwise they wouldn't be there.\n\n2. There's a larger gap between the top note (out of those three) than the other two, and since this was notated on a computer that probably didn't happen on accident. If it belonged to the bass staff it would be snug against the E.\n\nReading it as an F gives us the following pitches: F A C E. I've rearranged them into root position for the chord I see: Fmaj7. How does this fit in?\n\nMeasure 75 is pitches G B D E F. I've arranged these into a G7add6 chord.\n\nMeasure 76 is unambiguously F A C E, so it's DEFINITELY an Fmaj7, with a different voicing, furthering the case.\n\n~~Measure 77 is E A B D. I read this as Em7add6. If you want to be super picky it's Em7no3add6 but that doesn't change my interpretation.~~ Mistaken, read CrownStarr's correction.\n\nMeasure 77 could also be Asus4add9 but that breaks the pattern.\n\nTHE PATTERN:\n\nThe pattern I see is simple: It's just a group of jazzy 7th chords. Fmaj7, go to another chord with an add6, then go back to the Fmaj7 and do it again. Do a little glissando thing then do it all over again!\n\nSo based on the treble staff ledger lines, the visible gap, and how it would fit in with the following measures, I'm saying it's an F. A horribly, HORRIBLY notated F.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402063328", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Na.Vi US - Na.Vi EU, will be referred to as US and EU respectively.\n\nEU on dire side, picks are as following: Mirana (XBOCT), Enchantress (Puppey), Sand King (Kuroky), Kunkka (Dendi), Timbersaw (Funnik).\n\nUS on radiant side, picks are as following: Lycan (Sneyking), Disruptor (1437), Tidehunter (Brax), Dragon Knight (Korok), Jakiro (Fogged).\n\nLanes are as follows: Aggro tri lane lane Mirana + SK and a jungle ench, Mid Kunkka, safelane Timber for EU. Offlane Tide, mid DK, safelane Lycan with support Jakiro and Disruptor.\n\nFirst blood goes to ench, Disruptor is the victim. Support rotation by EU, killing DK mid. EU wraps around on the Tide, and kills the Tide, supports are more roaming than anything. XBOCT dies as he goes to check on the bot rune. Ench rotates mid, Dendi misses both torrent and boat, but ends up killing disruptor anyways. Score is now 1 for US and 4 for EU, at 6 minutes in.\n\nEdit: Xboct dies to a glimpse kill in the river again, and Dendi is killed soon after, dragon form is popped, and mid tower goes down to half health. US pressures bot tower, timber rotates down, and ends up killing the disruptor, and Tide soon after as he is found in the river. Jakiro and Tide rotates mid, kills Dendi, Funnik tps in, and the two supports rotates in from EU, Brax with an amazing 3 man ravage, Timber, SK and Ench all dies, Dendi denies mid. Bot tier 1 is taken, glimpse on Mirana and is killed, tier 2 is taken, Timber gets the same treatment, starts pushing tier 3, and ends up taking it even though Timber bought back at 11 mins! US tries to take the rax, but it ends up with a dead DK, jakiro and Tide. Roshan goes to EU and aegis goes to XBOCT. Lycan takes tier 1 safelane. Fight in the dire jungle, Mirana goes down once, SK and Timber as well, but 4 heroes of US goes down, making it a very costly trade. GEEZ SLOW DOWN, I can't keep up, 11-14 at 15 minutes.\n\nEdit 2: Mid fight by EU tier 2, huge epicenter by Kuroky, 4 man wipe, only Lycan survives, Na'Vi transitions into taking the tier 1 tower bot, meanwhile creeps ar epushing bot rax. They continue to push mid, but US picks offs SK, and EU are forced to retreat, and the push right back mid. Puppey caught out, ultis are thrown out, and after a lot of back and forth DK is traded for the Mirana. Such an intense game!\n\nEdit 3: Dire Courier goes down, only carrying observers, but Na'Vi might be out of oberservers leaving them vision less except their tier 2's mid and safelane. Rosh is soon up. 22ish minutes in, rosh is up, EU takes bot tier 1 tower, Lycan goes for tier 2 mid, but it's denied by Dendi. EU goes for rosh, it's scouted by US, US not sure if they want to contest, but they end up doing nothing, Aegis goes to Dendi.\n\nEdit 4: US goes for a smoke through dire jungle, popped by Kuroky, and it's unsuccesful. Immediate counter moonlight shadow by EU, US dusts but it's narrowly avoided, fight develops by the side shop on the dire safe lane, and it ends with all 5 of US goes down, only the supports goes down for EU. 26 minutes in and the score is 16-24.\n\nEdit 5: These guys won't slow down, is this russian doto!?  Another team fight by the dire jungle/mid lane, goes horrible for US. US seems uncoordinated, and they lack the magical burst, and Sneyking is not strong enough. Last 2 t2 is taken down by EU, DK split pushes top and takes down the t2 there, All outer towers are now down. 30 minutes in and the score is 16-27 in favor of EU.\n\nEdit 6: Observer pause by the chinese caster, game is immediatly resumed, but it's not a Finol pause as the game has slowed down, and US wants their next set of items, EU has a firm grip on this game. Daedalus on the Kunkka, Maelstrom on the DK, Deso on Mirana. Kuroky caught out on the radiant side of the map, it transitions in to nothing, except they get to push the lanes out a bit more. Blink on Timber, he already has bloodstone and shivas. Accidental glyph by the radiant, rosh goes to EU and Mirana picks up by the aegis, they can definitely threat highground.\n\nEdit 7: EU's grip on the map is getting stronger and stronger, starving the map, doing what they do best. Koroks tries and cuts waves. Na'Vi dives the mid base, but they are thwarted. Lycan split pushes top and takes down tier 3 tower as EU sieges mid. Tide goes down insta buyback, great ravage and good engagement! US pushes their luck, and it ends up in a 4 man wipe, only Lycan survives. Radiant range rax goes down mid, and US has now all respawned. 19-32 40 minutes in, EU in the driver seat. \n\nEdit 8: Double daedalus on Dendi, bots on SK, Disruptor is taken down in the dire jungle. The King is taken down as Funnik bots in on a creep wave and he is taken by surprise. Ravage on 2, buyback from lycan, no dieback! Supports goes down from EU, Dieback from Korok, and all of US are on the sidelines. GG's are called as the mid rax goes down. EU wins with a score 40-23. Great game.\n\nThere will be no recap of next game, as I gotta go make dinner now, I am very hungry!\n\nEdit 9: Just finished my dinner, tacos if anyone was curious, it's too late for me to start on VG - Fnatic, but Meepo was picked, and surprise, it's not N0tail but the E-God playing him. Next game will be recapped, it will be posted as a reply to this comment, and it's DK - EG , H Y P E B O Y S!\n\nEdit 10: Looks like EG-DK is hidden away, so here's a [link] (http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/27h0jg/the_summit_day_2_match_discussion/ci0v1yu) for it.

{"body": "C O M E B A C K B O Y S! Meepo too stronk! Fnatic wins second game, I'm a happy fan! The 5 way tie dream is real!\n\nH4nni, N0tail and Puppey are casting it, looks to be a very entertaining as well as informative cast. They are foreshadowing the mid draft gg from DK, EG looks to take a very quick and easy win! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nGame is underway!\n\nEG on the dire side, picks are as follows: Mirana (Mason), Shadow Demon (Zai), Dark Seer (Universe), Naga Siren (Arteezy), Rubick (ppd)\n\nDK on the radiant side, picks are as follows: Batrider (Icex3), Silencer (Burning), Lion (MMY), Queen of Pain (Mushi), Enigma (LaNm)\n\nFunniest commentary I've heard in a long time, and this was just the draft! As they said, DK wants to lose really fast, I'm no genius, but it looks like they outdrafted themselves.\n\nLanes are as following: Safelane Mirana, mid Naga, aggro tri Dark Seer, Rubick and SD. Offlane Bat, mid QOP, jungle enigma and safelane Silencer with Lion support.\n\nAggressive smoke movement into the radiant jungle, smoke is popped by Burning, and he narrowly escapes, jungle is warded, Enigma has a hard time. First blood is spilt, and it goes to EG, Lion is the first death. SD rotates top and tries a gank attempt on the bat, but bat escapes. Very fast soul ring on Dark Seer, and it looks like the lane is won for Universe. SD has gone in to pulling. Only lane DK is winning is mid, however Bat hasn't lost yet, as soon as this was wrote, they fail a gank attempt on SD, but it's tuned and bat dies. 2-0 for EG 7:30 minutes, Burning looks to be rushing aghs.\n\nEdit: Sleep arrow + SD gank on QOP is succesful, global used for gank on bottom killing Dark Seer. BLACK HOOOOLE immediatly cancelled by disruption, arrow! 3 dead for DK, Silencer, Lion and Enigma are all dead. Bat gets blink at 11 minutes, Enigma is only a recipe away from mek. Mirana has gone battle build (phase, aquila and soon to be drums). Batrider blink lasso on Mason, Global is used, Mason goes down, Offlane tower goes down. Mirana solo kills Bat in the top lane. Naga and Potm on the top of the net worth board. The two supports of EG goes for a gank on Silencer, they are succesful, however Bat turns it around for a double kill on them, tier 1 mid is denied by Universe. 4-8 with EG leading in kills, 15 minutes in.\n\nEdit 2: Last tier 1 tower goes down for EG. Great fight for EG by the tier 1 safelane tower of DK. Rubick dies, Naga is denied (Relic is bought before death), most of DK goes down, tier 1 safe lane is denied, after Mason solo kills Silencer. Blink lasso on Dark Seer after a 5 man smoke. Global used for a kill on SD by a solo bat. Radiance is now up on Naga, 19 minutes in, DK looks to be losing control of the game slowly. Tier 2 mid is taken by DK, but Arteezy has more space than a thing with a lot of space. Solo kill by bat on Rubick, Tier 2 safelane is taken by EG. Global is used, and Mushi takes down Naga, things are starten to brighten a bit, but it's still a very dark sky for DK. Incoming 5 way tie!? Kreygasm 11-11 23 minutes in\n\nEdit 3: HUGE BLACKHOLE IN THE RADIANT JUNGLE, But still a 3 for 3 trade, with Arteezy staying alive, and he has Manta soon, 3 k ahead of the second on the net worth board. Burning is working towards a refresher. Last outer tower is taken by DK, however I can't help but feel DK's towers are just money in the bank for EG. Defensive global by Burning, and a lot of tps forced top, DK tries to pursue but a couple of ultis are traded, and the 10 second bkb of QOP. Roshan is taken by DK, aegis goes to Mushi on the QOP of Pain. Ppd with the tactical feed. 16-14 in favor of DK 30 mnutes in.\n\nEdit 4: Burning ganked, global! refresher! no second ult, burning goes down! Blackhole is immediatly cancelled by EG, but what is this! 4 man wipe by DK, no one else goes down for DK except the Silencer!? only DS survives! Lasso + Finger on the Rubick, he dies. Arteezy has diffusal. DS with a point booster, looks to be going aghs. Pushing becomes increasingly hard for DK, as they are slowly getting ratted to death, and they only find supports on their smoke trips, this time is no exception, however they get both, but still no objectives. 23-15 in favor of DK 37 minutes in.\n\nEdit 5: Icex3 finds another solo kill on SD, DK is pushing mid, tier 3 is taken down by summons. LASSO on Mason, he goes down, ranged rax goes down, refresh global, rax's goes down! SD goes down, Mushi goes down. DK gaining some footing and are no longer on the complete backfoot. 26-16 in favor of DK 41 minutes in.\n\nEdit 6: Dire courier goes down, with Arteezy's vit booster on it, delaying his heart by 3 minutes. Second rosh goes to DK, aegis picked up by QOP. Beautiful sleep by Arteezy, Burning only gets one ulti off, buyback from Mason, Naga goes down, Aegis is popped, meanwhile bottom rax are taken, and DK is now up 2 lanes of rax, it is starting to look grim for EG, denying us the hope of the 5 way dream, HUUGE TEAMFIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, 4 goes down for EG, and only Lion goes down for DK. GG's are called DK wins! Speculations begins, has EG lost the game on purpose to gain mad rares on bets?! EG and DK gets thanked by the players, as the 5 way tie is avoided, ~~and it's only a 3 way tie between Na'Vi, VG and Fnatic~~. No tie as DK are allowed to pick opponents, and the two remaining teams will be playing each other.\n\nThis game is worth a watch, purely for the hillarious cast by H4nni, Puppey and Big Daddy.\n\nNext game will also be recapped, hope you're enjoying it \n\nEdit 7: Worth noting, there were really no actual analysis of the last game, but I find it funny however, also nice for all the casts not to be \"DOTO is serious fucking buisness.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402077924", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, I've got it. Consider:\n\n    prism :: (b -&gt; t) -&gt; (s -&gt; Either t a) -&gt; Prism s t a b\n\nA prism is basically made up of two functions, a \"constructor\" (`b -&gt; t`) and a \"destructor\" (`s -&gt; Either t a`). The destructor either succeeds and gives you the destructed value, `a`, or else it fails and gives you `t`, which is usually the unchanged value, cast as a different, compatible type with the expected output.\n\nSo suppose we can pull that destructor back out of the prism.\n\n    getDestructor :: APrism s t a b -&gt; s -&gt; Either t a\n\nWith that, we can write the generalized version of `aJoin`.\n\n    flattening :: APrism s t t b -&gt; s -&gt; t\n    flattening prism s = either id id (getDestructor prism s)\n\nNotice how usually we have `s t a b`, but in this case `a = t` so we have `s t t b`. That means that the destructor will produce an `Either t t`, and we can just pull out the `t` without caring which side it came from.\n\nSo there.

{"body": "Python!\n\nWrite a script in python (programming language) that converts from ABC notation to data your your program/arduino can read on the fly.\n\nYou only have the notes ABCDEFG there sharps and flats and their octaves.\n\n[Here is a standard solfege scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge#Fixed_do_solf.C3.A8ge)\n\nThis means you have discrete sets. (NOTE in Abc I don't see cords. I.e. three notes played at once. I only see the ability at any time stamp to play one tone.) Correct me if I'm wrong but that is a big assumption and One I am using below.\n\nLet's write a program then that reads the abc Notation and converts it into tones.\n\nThe only possible inputs are as follows:\n    C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C D E F G A B c d e f g a b c' d' e' f' g' a' b'\n\nalso Spaces and Pipes |\n\nso that is a set of 28 unique notes, 1 for a space, and 1 for a measure break or pipe. so 30 total. Since we expect to see pipes and spaces often lets put those at address 0 and 1 of our array and the rest in order from descending to ascending.\n\nThat gives us or input array. We simply loop through each sequence in the input and convert to the correct tone.\n\n**But wait what about numbers and lengths etc.** Let's skip that for now as that will stay the same. I.e. if it is C3 (3 times base timestamp of sound C we will steed need the time for our tone file.) so let's skip that for now.\n\nWhat are we missing?\n\n* Sharps, flats, etc.\n\nThese are controled by the K field, i.e. what notes are sharp etc.\n\nSo out program now has to loop through each note, compare that note to the K field map (i.e. if K = d what notes are normal, what sharp, and what flat.) then convert to the correct tone.\n\nOK that's going good.\n\nNow the timing.\n\nWe need to use milisecs() and a knowledge or relationship to the M field. i.e. 6/8 will be 1 note is x/seconds long. Then when we see C3, our program checks C vs the K field sharps it or flats it if need be and then takes x/second * 3 for the length to play.\n\nIn the end you would have something very similar to the ABC file but instead of A3, being A and 3 , it would be more literal i.e. [from say this chart.](http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html) so A would be 27.4 herz for say .025 seconds\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402113547", "subreddit": "arduino", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Recently in [his AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/27b1v6/im_tobacco_an_electronic_junk_music_salesmanmaker/) he mentioned that he tends to use his more \"accessible\" material with BMSR and everything else with Tobacco. His music as Tobacco, including this new record, definitely has a loose, \"don't give a fuck\" attitude. It's also insane.\n\n**Tim Hecker - Virgins**: I keep coming back to this record about once a month or so. The effect the music has on me has not diminished at all with repeated listens.\n\n**Amen Dunes - Love**: Very relaxing lazy summer day type music.\n\n**AnCo - MPP**: Strawberry Jam, Sung Tongs, Feels, and MPP are constantly being swapped around as my favorite AnCo album. Usually it's the one I most recently listened to and that means right now it's MPP.\n\n**Parquet Courts - Sunbathing Animal**: I've given this a few listens and it's just not clicking yet. To be honest I'm kind of bored by it. Doesn't mean I'm giving up, I felt the same way about Salad Days and now I'm loving it. Some tracks I do like are Instant Disassembly and Ducking and Dodging.\n\n**Sharon Van Etton - Are We There**: Honest lyrics, passionate delivery, beautiful instrumentation.

{"body": "Why do I love Singu so much? It's pretty simple when you think about it: Singu isn't just the best player in the game, he might just be the greatest guy of all time.

They know how he smells, the essence of his smell is sold in the Secret Shop under the name of \"Beavergasm.\" The very nature of Singu is a mystery. Could he be playing a deeper game than even his creators realize? The answer is YES, he has transcended such boundaries as the D I G I T A L S P O R T S world, and has free will to do whatever he sees fit. However, Singu is filled with such playfulness, such sportsmanship that he does not even use his powers. Why, you might ask? You will never know, for the mind of Singu is not one that is easily read. Singu is such a force of nature in Dota2 realm that nothing can truly touch him, the only thing keeping him bound to the strim at all is his will to exist within the preordained boundaries of the D I G I T A L S P O R T S world. Singu is not only beyond comprehension to us, he exists within a plane of true focus and beauty. Observe his playful laughter, his gorgeous and black hair, his beautiful visage, and most importantly, his eyes. His eyes, like pools of mud, provide the only a glimpse into the true nature of Singu. Do not stare into them. Many good women have gone mad in the attempt. Singu is not just a hero, a formless collection of bits and energy, he himself is the binding that holds the whole game together. Without Singu, the entire confict, the entire game as we know it crumbles. The Dire would fall into the ground without Singu, the river would stop flowing and the Radiant would stop shining without his comforting radiance.\nThese are just of a few of the reasons why I love Singu so much", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402161331", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I have a music degree, and voice was my instrument. It's been a while since I thought about such things, though; I graduated like, 15 years ago and did not pursue music as a career. But I'll see if I can help.\n\n\nKnow your vocal range. Are you a tenor are a bass or an alto or a soprano? You can work on expanding your range, but why kill yourself trying to sing like a tenor if you are a bass?\n \n\nFind a singer you like who sings *in your vocal range*, then sing one of their songs. Why can't you sing like them? What are they doing that you aren't doing? Play around with your voice and try to figure it out.\n\n\nPretend you are an opera singer. A jazz singer, a country singer. What do these kinds of singers do differently that make the styles sound so different? \n\n\nTry not to \"over sing\", but try letting go and singing loudly (while you are alone, in the shower, whatever). Sing for fun. Sing nonsense. Sing as high and as low as you can. As quietly as you can. Hold a note as long as you can. At that point, try *not* judging your voice as \"good\" or \"bad\" or comparing it to anyone or anything. Explore what you can do. If you have trouble doing this, there are exercises and practices about \"freeing your voice\" that you would want to explore.\n\n\nEar training is important. You need to be able to tell if you're singing off key or not, basically! \n\n\nOn guitar, you know that if you put your finger behind the third fret of the E string, you get a G note when you pluck the string. But when you sing some note, you have no reference point unless someone is playing an instrument at the same time. Even then, it's usually a matter of hearing whether what you're singing \"goes with\" what is being played, or sounds off, rather than knowing what notes you are singing. But ideally, you could sing in tune *without accompaniment*. \n\n\nIf you have perfect pitch, then no problem! But most people don't and never will. But you should be able to learn to identify a pitch or two at least. Then you can compare that pitch to others you sing/hear to have some idea what the note is. That requires knowing about intervals. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music).\n\n\nPractice singing intervals. Know when you are singing an interval of a minor third, or 5th, or a minor 7th or whatever. There are mnemonic devices to help you with this. Eg, The first two notes of the \"Star Wars\" theme song are separated by an interval of a 5th, the first to notes of \"My Bonny\" are a major 6th, etc.\n\nYou can use numbers to sing the intervals. Practice singing the intervals 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, (lower) 5 and back to 1 again. Eg: C E G E C G C. Practice singing scales and modes. Practice outlining chords with your voice. \n\n\nRhythm is important. Practice voicing different combinations of notes of different lengths *without* adding pitch: eg, in 4/4 time, \"TAA-ti-ti-TAA-Taa\" would represent a quarter note, two eighth notes, then two more quarter notes. There are exercises to help you do this. Learn what syncopation, anticipation, staccato, etc. are and practice them as well. You may also want to learn a percussion instrument; I found that learning hand drumming helped to improve my rhythmic skills overall, even while singing. \n\n\nOther things are important: breathing, posture, relaxation, learning how to sing using some parts of your body more than others as resonators (eg, Are you focusing your voice through your nose mostly? How about making your chest vibrate when you sing as well? How about the top of your head?).\n\n\nI would recommend learning how to read music a little, at least, if only to make it easier to read the vocal exercises you are trying to practice.\n\n\nThere is a *lot* more to singing that the things I have listed, but in another way, there is a lot less. Many very talented singers never do any of these things. So if you are naturally talented as a singer, I might just tell you to sing a lot. \n\n\nBut if you want to learn more about the kinds of practices I'm talking about, there are many resources available; books, videos, websites, classes, and private or group vocal instruction. For example have a look at this website that I found by Googling \"Vocal exercises\". It looks like it has a lot of good information (even though it looks like it was made in the 90s or something!).\n\n\nGood luck. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402174403", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

We weren't designed to be able to accurately moderate a game of football. Imagine how hard it is to moderate 36 players on a field, sure as hell isn't easy.\n\nThe problem is that the rules aren't really clear and a lot of it comes down to perception. It's not clear cut to what is a free kick or not, unlike in rugby league or soccer it's a bit more obvious usually. \n\nThis is the way the game is, accept it, you will never get 100% consistency in anything that involves humans.\n\nAdding a fine like this (to clarify, I know this is a hypothetical) would just reduce the quality of umpiring in my opinion as it would leave umpires more nervous about making mistakes.

Try both and see what feels right. \n\nAs far as her seeming mana hungry, you're probably spamming your spells too much (I used to have the same problem). Use w if you want to push, q if you're trading, aas otherwise. If you really feel you need the regen, by all means give up a few MR points but you shouldn't NEED to. \n\nAs for skills, it depends on the matchup. If you want to trade early, get q first. If you want to push the lane, w first. As for whether to get a level of e at 3 or a 2nd level of q, that depends on the matchup. If you're against thresh/blitz/morg/leo, it is sometimes worthwhile to get e at level 3 if you are having trouble dodging their skillshots. If they're not playing aggressive or you are fine with dodging them, get a second level of q. I'd say 80% of the time, I go q w q e but that's just preference. \n\nAnother tip is to learn her qs range. If you can catch the enemy right at the edge where it starts coming back to you, it makes it impossible for them to dodge the double damage.

It's not acceptable on any level these days to refer to people of color as \"colored\".  I know you weren't meaning it maliciously, just letting you know.\n\n&gt; acting roles are hired based on a script. They can't \"just hire more minorities\", they have to hire people who fit the roles they are supposed to be filling.\n\nYeah because a [white actress is better suited to a Native American role than, you know, any Native American actresses at all.](http://media.tumblr.com/5a4c43413f5999acd9de0bdd39312f41/tumblr_inline_n2qgttnLc81qajaz9.png)\n\nAnd I'm not saying every single casting director who chose a white actor did it because they were racist, I'm saying the *preference* lies with white people.  Talking about biases and preferences will draw attention to them and make people aware.  The creator of Sleepy Hollow (the tv series) spoke about this (I can't for the life of me find the link now because my bookmarked URL died).  She said she began to look primarily at white actors for all the lead roles.  She realised that if she cast an all white cast, that would leave the minority actors to the role of \"villains\" or \"victims\".  She decided to switch it up and while keeping with Ichabod Crane being a white man with a white wife, she made all the other leads black.  Now that's FIVE BLACK ACTORS with lead roles on a hit tv show on a mainstream network.  Would you believe that's groundbreaking?  Even more than that, the time travel aspect allows for these black characters to educate Ichabod (who is from the 1800s) about history from a modern perspective.  A W E S O M E.  This all comes from the creator being socially conscious enough to understand that not everything has to be done the way its always done over and over again.  That's all I'm asking, is that creators *and* audiences *think* about what they're seeing and creating.\n\n&gt; That's why shows like Everyone Hates Chris have a majority of black people, and shows like Scrubs does not.\n\nScrubs was created by a white dude, EHC was created by Chris Rock and is somewhat autobiographical so obviously EHC was going to cast black people out of accuracy.  \n\n&gt; There are a ton of shows tailored specifically for black people, written by black writers, and have mostly black staff and actors. How is that not \"giving them a chance\"?\n\nCan you list them for me?  Only ones that are currently on air and have decent audience numbers, please.\n\n&gt; It sounds like we have a system that is working pretty well, especially if the shows which do have diverse characters are doing well.\n\nI don't doubt things are progressing in certain areas.  All I was doing was showing that for someone who wanted to know why equal representation was important...here's some reasons why.  Doesn't mean everything is doom and gloom, it just means we need to keep moving in a good direction.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402306659", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "P and NP are types of problems: P are problems which can be solved in polynomial time with a deterministic turing machine, NP are problems which can be verified with a non-deterministic turing machine (if the answer is true). What does that mean? Polynomial time: this means that as the size of the input or problem increases, the time needed to solve it increases by less than a certain polynomial. Polynomials are equations that have powers in them like n^5 (which means n x n x n x n x n, or n times itself five times). In this case, if a problem can be solved in polynomial time, you can always pick a number (in our example, 5) so that for your input size (called n) the time taken to solve it will be less than n^AcertainNumber. Now Turing machines. Turing machines are basically just computers, machines that can do simple things like check if two things are equal, and return an output, such as 'yes, they are equal', or 'no they are not equal' when given inputs. Deterministic Turing machines look like yes/no diagrams, or [flowcharts](http://www.science4all.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/friendshipAlgorithm.png) and this is effectively what computers, but with a lot more junctions. Non-deterministic Turing machines are more like tree diagrams, which start with an input and branch  down, returning a positive output if the diagram reaches a final state like [here](http://www.science4all.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/non-deterministic.png) where the green dots represent the 'true' answer. All problems which are 'P' type problems are also 'NP' type problems. However if all 'NP' type problems ares also 'P' type problems, that is to say P=NP, then this would mean that very difficult NP-type problems such as working out the prime factorisation of large numbers, could be done in a reasonable amount of time with a powerful enough computer. Cyber security relies on these problems being extremely hard to solve, using them to encrypt data, so if P=NP, then this would mean that the data (e.g. passwords) could be unencrypted with a computer by thieves.

{"body": "There are two things called \"Greek modes\" used in *modern* Western music.  They're also called \"church modes\".  In actuality, the real modes used in Greece were different from those used in the church, and they're different from the modern modes!  It's confusing.  And, what's worse, there are two types of modes!  There are jazz modes, which is what you're talking about, and there are modes used as scales, which is what you're not talking about.  Let's talk about them both, though.\n\nIn modal jazz, \"A dorian\" is another name for Am13, and \"D mixolydian\" is another name for D13.  The notes of Am13 are A C E G B D F#, and the notes of A dorian are A B C D E F# G.  Same notes, except Am13 is in thirds and A dorian is in seconds.  The idea is that you *think* of an Am13 chord as an A dorian scale instead of an Am13 chord.  When you're playing in some other key and you get a minor chord in a ii position, you play that dorian scale, which hopefully you already know.  Now, you're probably asking, \"Why Am13?  I'm playing Am!\"  Yeah, well, modal jazz extends the concept of a chord to include all seven notes.  So Am is usually a more extended chord; in this case, it's Am13 because the key is G and Am is the ii.  If it were in Am instead, you'd be playing A aeolian, and the chord would be Am(b13).  Part of being good at modal jazz is knowing which mode to use on a chord from context.  The idea is that all of these notes are in the chord, and \"chord\" and \"scale\" are equivalent because they have the same notes.\n\nIn modern Western music theory, on the other hand, the modes are totally distinct from each other.  Dorian is a minor mode with a raised 6.  If you're playing something in A dorian, that's totally different than if you were playing it in D mixolydian or G major, because the relationships between the notes are all different.  In A dorian, the \"home\" note is A, and the \"home\" chord is Am.  The primary chords are Am, D, Em (i, IV, v).  In G major, the \"home\" note is G and the \"home\" chord is G major; the primary chords are G, C, D (I, IV, V).  They use the same notes, sure, but they come in a completely different way.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402356460", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

You have a lot more freedom with picking your classes. I got an entire booklet of classes to choose from. One more thing, I often hear people from my old public school complaining how high school never taught them how to do things they need to know for adulthood, like loans, taxes, mortgages, ect but my cyber school covered many of these topics.

{"body": "Hi everyone,\n\n**For my part, here are my Feedbacks (based on my own experience and opinions):**\n\n* As stated by a lot of people, i think we need more items. The purpose is to have a way to build and counterbuild depending on the situation and not only have mandatory items for each \"class\". Vartiety will increase metagame and give each play a new flavor\n\n* I suggest to rework the matchmaking system that seems broken\n\n* I suggest to rework some passives ( Vulcan for exemple ) giving them a real purpose. Some gods have passive that either don't help them or either push them into some \"solo\" gaming\n\n* IMO, i think that guardians need some rework ... They are more like big damage dealers whom can sustain damage and take nothing. They should see their flat base damage lowered. For me their purpose is to engage, annoy, survive, create opportunities for the team to seize\n\n* I suggest to rework the Hard/Soft CC system. There are too much CC and when you take them all you are garanteed not to be able to do A N Y T H I N G even if you are the best player, the awesome tank ... There must be some degressive system that prevents for exemple the application of a third snare, the second one taking only half the effect. Also aegis is not usable on hard CC (knock-up, pushes ...) while i think it should, like \"Zhonya's Hourglass\" on LoL. For me, an item that grants you total immunity should be usable at any state.\n\n* I suggest to rework some spells that can penetrate walls. For exemple : Anubis ult can go through walls while geb \"Shock wave\" or Mercury ult or scylla's \"Sic 'Em\" can't go through. Either make all spells go through the walls OR not.\n\n* I would like to see the return of the 5vs5 Siege\n\n* I would like to see a permanent domination game mode ( i love it )\n\nKeep going HiRez. I love smite and recommanded it to all my friends. You are doing a great job and i support you.

{"body": "My god man, so much f*cking drama. Were there any adults involved in this whole process? If so, they should be ashamed of themselves. I refuse to take sides on this admin issue... and that being said, no one should have to.\nMy advice for starting another online community of any sort in the future, ESPECIALLY a DayZ server; \n1) Keep yourself \"above the fray\", don't get so involved with the gen-pop that you start to \"make buddies\" or even make enemies within it. Keep the server and its community at arms length. \n\n2) Find some ADULTS you trust, that have managment experience, know what it's like to lead a team, etc IN REAL LIFE, not just in video games.  Consult with this small council frequently, make sure at least one of them is not part of the community, preferrably someone who doesn't even play on the server but knows their stuff, server mgmt wise.\n\n3) Servers require people's hard earned money be at stake, they don't run for free. This changes the dynamic of the community you're attempting to create and raises the bar for the professionalism the community and the server deserve.  Put policies in place that are hard and fast, black and white and result in pre-set disciplinary action that has been determined BEFORE the server goes live.  BAN first then allow for players to appeal, *NOT* the other way around. This is the internet guys, people live to get online and exploit, *PERIOD*. The  only gaming communities that survive long term are founded by those who recognize this, have zero tolerance for such behavior and prep themselves for it accordingly.  You absolutely can not feel bad for ANYONE on the internet regarding online issues, for the moment you do, the fail cascade begins. (This does not apply to empathy/sympathy for real life events affecting people, don't get me wrong. But there is however, a DISTINCT difference.)  There are PLENTY of other people to fill the slots left empty by any jackasses you ban, DO NOT let internet people convince you otherwise.\n\nLast but not least, \n\n4) If admins insist on playing on the server, ensure they can do so A N O N Y M O U S L Y and professionally.  I would advise against it completely, once again, referring to No. 1) Admins keeping themselves, \"above the fray\" and \"at arm's length\". You CANNOT manage people by being everyone's buddy... period.\n\nAll this comes from my own experience in servers that have lasted long term, my real life career, managing my online community, etc. I repeat, this is only personal experience, take it or leave it.\n\nGood luck to all of you in the future, good times were definitely had amongst the bad and we met many great people.  We will definitely have fond memories of the server that could have been.\n\nTake Care, \n\n-Smitty", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402413536", "subreddit": "Afternight", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

But toneless could just mean that a pitch target isn't associated with a particular syllable.\n\nI just think it's less plausible to analyze a register system as three tones *without* sandhi phenomena, e.g. upstep, downstep, than *with* sandhi. So most analyses of with H are open to a lowered version (aka downstep) and a raised version (upstep) or not; but a H M L three tone system would perhaps have interactions between upstep ( ^ ) and downstep so that ^ M=H or something, but they would have to be specified.

No, you wouldn't have been born the. Damnation! Damnation, hell-fire, and Devils! Well, Descendant, if you're reading this, please see if you can find the pendant and get me out.

God damn but I hate that I had to wake up. I shall try to sleep again. Wish me luck.\n\nMy watch is broken. I can't sleep. This is getting worrisome, why have I not been rescued?

{"body": "Completely unspoiled.\n\nI didn't like it. So many reasons, but I'll start with what I *liked*:\n\n* Sasha! YES! Thank you!\n* the Shauna reveal surprised me. I really thought Alison sent Shauna (well, maybe not, but I could *buy* it) until Ezra woke from his \"coma\" long enough to hyperventilate seeing \"A\". (That's who he THINKS was A? Really? Hey-zeus that was stupid, but anyway) the reveal, while quick, was spooky and great. :)\n\n* **Holden!** &lt;3\n\nNow my dislikes:\n\n* Seems as though Ezra and Alison had a *bit more* of a relationship than Ezra expounded upon. And for *14 year old Alison* to be impressed by Liar Boy just *does not bode well.*\n\n* Alison running through the streets; the girls mace TF out of A; and about 2 DOZEN As pop up. What in the actual FUCK. This should probably be #1, in fact.\n\n* Ninja Aria's at it again! She didn't know that was a real gun or a prop; her ass wasn't THERE when that was explained! But Ninja Aria takes out A all by her lonesome with Genius Ninja Aria's awesomeness. GMAB. Like the other girls would let Shauna get the drop on them so easily, RMDE, and it takes Ninja Aria...\n\n* who is ALMOST as Ninja as Shauna, who leapt in a single bound to the ambulance (which Alison didn't report) Ezra was being rushed to the hospital in. All that ninja crap last season ***was Shauna***?\n\n* Shauna's reasoning: she in da love with da J and wants the V. (Or the D.) Yes LET'S HAUNT NEIGHBORHOODS FOR SHITS AND GIGGLES to get rid of a 4yr \"dead\" girl. Are you *fucking* kidding me? **Was Jenna in on this shit? How about Melissa?** My brain is scrambled.\n\n* Sexual tension between Mr. Hastings and Melissa. UGH! I really thought the creepster was going to KISS his daughter. All because there are two Alisons, I suppose, and boy one is enough, but twins would ruin his marriage for REALZ, but there would be TWO. (I guess that's the secret.)\n\n* Paige GTFO of Mona's A Team, B! Leave, go, get OUT. ISHT! I liked her saying, \"those are names, this is stupid, ya'll stupid, STFU and bye.\" So maybe Paige is just *that into Melissa?* (LMAO) Or is Paige going to be a double-agent? Wouldn't that make Mona the *least* bit suspicious of Pigskin?\n\nAnd I'll just admit I have NO IDEA what's going on. NONE. That Occupy New York gang of As was so stupid I couldn't even, and the NYPD telling hooded figures surrounding 4 scared girls *to scatter* is B O L O G N A.\n\nI'm not a terribly huge Ezria fan obviously, but some shit ...I mean is next week's flashback going to be \"Yes, Ezra gave me the D and I know why you should hit that, Aria! Whoohoo!\" and Alison's memory of their early marriage which isn't legit because Alison was too young. Oh but she HAD A BABY... I'm just picturing this stupid crap and thinking, this might not be the show for me anymore. :(\n\nEither make Ezra good, or bad.\n\nSame with Jenna: is she A too? Then why that big \"forgiveness\" scene in whatever season where Jenna warned the girls it wasn't ever her they had to fear? Was it Mona?\n\nYeah: someone tell me WTF happened tonight. PLEASE!

{"body": "Oh, by the way:\n\nThe entire point of the post was to teach about the diatonic scale. I suppose I should make that clearer in the title.\n\nThe intent is for you to know which chords are in a given key.\n\nThe diatonic scale takes each interval in its respective scale and assigns it a quality, \"major\", \"minor\", \"diminished\" and \"augmented\". They're easily remembered by committing the pattern to memory:\n\nFor a major key (example: C major): Major minor minor Major Major minor diminished\n\nFor a minor key (Example: A minor): minor diminished Major minor minor Major Major\n\nWhen you pick your scale, you know your 7 notes:\nC major: C D E F G A B\n\nYou simply take each interval in the scale and apply the respective quality.\n\nC major diatonic: C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, B diminished\n\nThose are the chords that \"match\" your C major song. They'll all sound good. You usually get your progression from these 7 chords.\n\nTake arguably the most common progression: C - G - Am - F, a.k.a. the I-V-vi-IV progression. By using the C major diatonic you can see that the progression uses the first, the fifth, the sixth and the fourth chords respectively.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402464477", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You'll need to familiarize yourself with the circle of 5ths (google image it) which tells you what sharp/flat notes are in every key. C major whose relative minor is A minor has 0 sharps or flats. C D E F G A B the next key to the right G major (e minor relative minor) both have F# as the only sharp or flat. so G A B C D E F# the next key has 2 sharps and its D major so it's D E F# G A B C# the next key is A major which has 3 sharps so A B C# D E F# G#. you may or may not have noticed by now that its the 7th note that gets sharped when you go the next key, at least when moving to the right in major keys on the circle of 5ths. (you should be looking at it while reading this).\n\nthe TLDR is that i know A major is A B C# D E F# G# and that A minor is A B C D E F G. So if we're talking about A E B C i know that it would be A E B C# if it were in major.\n\nit's very important to know which sharps and flats are in which key. If you start at the top of the circle of 5ths you'll find it goes like this. C major 0 sharps, G major one sharp (F#), D major 2 sharps (F# C#), A major 3 sharps (F# C# G#), E major 4 sharps ( F# C# G# and D#) and so on. Those 5 keys and their relative minors (check circle of 5ths if you cant figure it out!) are the main ones used in guitar music, mostly because you get to keep the most amount of open strings. if you start going to the left on the circle of 5ths, which is very common for brass instruments, you start losing open strings fast which is counter intuitive for guitar playing.

{"body": "I'm pretty new too, but seeing your post made me think this seemed like a cool idea, so I came up with a way to do it that which, while it takes a while to set up, isn't really that complicated. I shared my attempt at it on the steam workshop here if you want to take a look: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=270000316\n\nIn what I made, you can choose to be male or female, have dark or light skin, have dark or light hair, and have blue or red/pink clothes. So the first thing I did was use Game Character Hub to make a bunch of sprites and faces - one for each of the final outcomes you could have, as well as some for when you're in the middle of making your choices. Then I imported all the images into the game, and made actors named things like \"M L D R\" (male, light skin, dark hair, red clothes) so I didn't get them mixed up. I ended up with 28 different actors - the 16 fully dressed ones with hair, and 12 in various states of undress and hairlessness.\n\nThe first thing I did was make it so you start with no one in your party, and an autorun event asks you to choose your gender and skin colour. Then it adds the relevant actor to the party - if you chose female with dark skin, you get \"F D\" - a bald black woman in her underwear. Then it turns on a switch with the same name as the character.\n\nThe next thing you can do is go talk to the hairdresser and choose your hair. The hairdresser event is made out of six event pages total - one that does nothing just in case, four that only occur if the right switch is activated, and one more for after you've chosen your hair (and turned on a self-switch in the process). So continuing in the same game, the event page that's activated by the switch \"F D\" is turned on, and asks if you want dark hair or light hair. If you choose dark hair, it will remove \"F D\" from the party and add \"F D D\" - a black woman who's still in her underwear but now has black hair. It will also turn on the F D D switch.\n\nThen you can go talk to the tailor, who works the same way, but with ten total event pages, since there are eight different actors you could be by this point instead of four. Same thing happens - if you choose blue clothes, he removes \"F D D\" and gives you \"F D D B\", and now you have a blue dress. But instead of having him turn on a specific switch for each combination this time, I just had every option turn on a switch called \"clothes\".\n\nThen when you go over to the name changing man with the clothes switch turned on, he'll let you choose your name. I had him run on a bunch of conditional branches instead of different pages, because what he does is much simpler - he just checks who's in the party and then lets you change the name of that actor. So when you walk up to him as F D D B, the conditional branch of F D D B being in the party runs, and you'll change your name instead of some other irrelevant actor's name.\n\nThe last thing I did once I had set all that up was go back into the database and change all the actors' names to \"?\", so that if you pause during character creation you don't see that your name is a bunch of a letters. This works because in all the events that add certain actors to the party, they're really checking for what number in the database that actor is, not what their name is.\n\nSo in my example you ended up with a black woman with black hair in a blue dress, but you could also get a white man with black hair in a red jacket, or a black man with reddish hair in a red jacket, to name two more out of the sixteen possible combinations. You could use the same system to add more combinations, but the more you add the more sprites and event pages you need. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a more efficient way to do all this, but this way works and isn't that hard to do if you have some patience!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402553655", "subreddit": "RPGMaker", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've had one for a while. My batteries and charger broke in a house flood so I upgraded to the pax and I haven't bought new batteries since. That being said, I'll give you my quick .02 (3)\n\nPros\nLow smell (Heating up in a matter of seconds you can count on one hand makes a big difference. It also it cools off quickly, so smell lingers less too. My pax is very smelly in comparison with a decent boot time and a long cool off time)\n\nSmall\n\nCheap (very good starter vape, price point is likely why you're looking at this one)\n\nYou can mod the box with different types of batteries, water filtration, concentrate adapters and a lot more\n\nAgain mentioning the speedy heat up and cool off time as it's own thing because it's something I found significant that I don't see mentioned in many reviews\n\nUnbeatable customer support and warranty. As for the box; you break it, you get a new one. Period. Doesn't even require you ship them the broken parts as long as you can send a few photos of the damage with a camera to their support team.\n\nSmall bowl makes you conserve weed like a one hitter. Also, it's a vape so you conserve weed on that end as well\n\nAnd of course this is a vape so you get all of the benefits of vaping that include saving weed, smelling less, tasting better, getting different palettes of cannabinoids that are vaporized at different temperatures and not getting the carcinogens that are burnt in a flame. Your lungs will thank you.\n\nCons\nLearning curve is kinda steep for this thing\n\nIt's bowl is small, sharing in large groups can be tedious\n\nBattery juggling can be a B I T C H (keeping track, charging, etc) as can carrying the rest of the 'gear' at times (weed, abv/avb container if you like, batteries (2-4), grinder (or bring it ground), battery charger, extra gear you may buy (they have this neat looking water filtration system for example))\n\nThis thing won't vape as well as a pax or solo or pinnacle (I think that's the name?) which may leave you wanting more, but it's the best portable vape you can get for the cost.\n\nBut these are my opinions. It's a great tool, but maybe not for everyone. Great first vape. I recommend it. Hope I could help!\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402565832", "subreddit": "trees", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "P T P T I \n\n\nP= Pointer Finger\nT=Thumb\nI=The finger next to your pinky \n\nThink of the rhythm in groups of six. \n\n123456133456123456\npractice counting that out loud, and tapping your foot on 1 and 4 for starters. \n\nThe thing that's probably getting you about this pattern is that it starts on 6 with your pointer finger. \n\nHere's how the rhythm matches with the fingers, but first you need to learn a symbol. It's called a repeat symbol. There are two kinds of repeat symbols this one |:     and this one    :| \n\nWhen you read music from left to right and your eye hits this symbol |:   keep going until you see this symbol :|  then go back and repeat from the symbol you skipped. A repeat just shows you where to keep playing something over and over again. \n\nso here we go. Starting from Six with our pointer finger. Oh yeah, don't try this on the guitar yet. Keep reading.\n\n\n6(P) |: 1(T) 2(P) 3(T) 4(I) 5 6(P) :|\n\nnow practice counting out loud, starting with six. 6123456123456\nTap your foot on 1 and 4 \n\n6(1)23(4)56(1)23(4)56\n\nStart slowly, count evenly, if you can't count evenly use a metronome. In fact, use a metronome regardless. Casey used a metronome when he learned too, I'm fairly certain, because 99% of good musicians use metronomes when they practice, or had a period when they were learning that included a whole lot of metronome practice.\n\n\nNext step. counting, and tapping the corresponding fingers on a table or chair. Count out loud, starting with 6, and tap the finger assigned to whichever number you're saying.\n\n6(P) |: 1(T) 2(P) 3(T) 4(I) 5 6(P) :|\n\nNote: Did you notice how 5 doesn't have a finger symbol? That's because the sound initiated on 4 rings through 5. In other words it's a longer note. Sometimes I break things down into simple sounds. To illustrate the longer note, say the \"das\" out loud.\n\nda da da da daaaa da da da da daaaa \n\n\n\nI know I didn't give you the song or whatever, but these things will help you a lot in the long run. Think about it, If you cant count the rhythm, and tap the right fingers at the right time on a desk, how will you ever do it on guitar? \n\nI hope that helps.\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402566691", "subreddit": "TheDearHunter", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Perhaps the single biggest thing stopping you is the fact you are trying, and focused on your effort, and sad about your lack of success.\n\nAny *hint* of desperation, or entitlement, or any of the *totally normal emotions* lonely single people have about their lonely single-ness is 10,000,000x not attractive to others. It's the catch-22 of dating. To be successful, you have to put effort and intent into it, but to be successful, you have to not appear to be doing so.\n\nIf that makes no sense, you are right. Still, it seems to be how it works.\n\nWhen people say \"It'll happen when you least expect it\" really translates into \"When you stop focusing on trying to find a partner, and just fill your life with people and actions you find personally fulfilling, and therefore fill yourself with happiness and positivity, then you are far, far more likely for the statistical crapshoot of finding your partner to happen because you won't turn people away with hints of negative emotions, poor confidence, and otherwise negative energy\"\n\nYou have to be 100% happy in and of yourself, unrelated to being with somebody else or having kissed them or whatever. With the happiness comes personal fulfillment, and confidence, two things that are really sexy in humans (fancy clothes, fancy cars, bulging muscles... can be attractive, but rarely are really sexy the way joy, passion, and confidence are... every have your mind blown when some guy without riches, a hard body, and often with weight or unattractive features always seems to be with women? Bet you the dude is just a happy, confident, outgoing guy and that easily overcomes his other 'lacks').\n\nIf you want to math geek or game it (I'm going to totally nerd here because that makes me happy), to get laid and/or in love your 'job' is to structure your life so that you are as happy with yourself as you can be as much of the time as you can be. You also want to structure your life so you are outgoing and involved in the world, meeting new people and doing new things not as some late-night-bar hunt for a life partner or sexual prey but as a byproduct of doing things you find cool and rewarding. \n\nIt then works like this: I'm happy and confident in myself for myself X% of the time. I'm out and about doing fun exciting rewarding things Y% of the time. When I am out and about, I encounter new people Z% of the time. When I am happy, out, and meeting people there is a ZZ% chance (very small!) they are in the same emotional space, we are both single, and we establish interest or friendship in each other than then leads to romance. \n\nYou chance of landing that first kiss or life partner is thus X x Y x Z x ZZ in any given moment of your life.\n\nEvery other piece of advice you are given is just other folk's approach to maximizing X, Y, Z, and ZZ. Delete Facebook and hit the gym? Proven to increase happiness (X) and attractiveness which affects the likelihood you find a connection (ZZ). Join a team or participate in a play or a cause? Increases the portion of your time out and about doing something fun and fulfilling (Y) and meeting people (Z). More attractive clothing? May make you happier with yourself (X) or increase the likelihood when happy and out and meeting people you make that romantic connection (ZZ). And so forth...\n\nThe red-pill folks who teach Game? Really just ways to affect your confidence and happiness (or appearance thereof) (X), get you out and about and meeting people (Y, Z), and then controversial ideas about how to increase the likelihood of a connection (ZZ).\n\nHere's the final bonus piece of wisdom. If you focus on a life that is happy, fulfilling, and filled with things and people you enjoy, guess what? Even if you NEVER, EVER kiss a person or fall in love or find a life-long relationship you are still busy living a happy and fulfilled life, which is the point really.\n\nFinally, to really drive the point home, I'll note my experience with marriage and then failed marriage and divorce is even after you meet and fall in love you had better STAY happy and fulfilled and outgoing on your own, because if you are not no amount of being in love will keep that love healthy and you attractive to your partner.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402600537", "subreddit": "relationships", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, practice.  Working memory can retain [7 +/-2 chunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two) of information at at time.  What those chunks contain depends in part upon how expert you are.  Here's a sort of crude example.  If you had to recall a string of nine letters in sequence (F B I C I A D E A), you might forget a few.  However, if familiarity on your part allows you to clump the string into a smaller number of units (FBI, CIA, DEA), then you'll have an easier time remembering them and probably have working memory space to spare.\n\nAnother big reason behind familiarity improving working memory function is that practice develops automaticity.  The more actions you can perform automatically without making demands upon working memory, the finer your attention can be within working memory.  For example, automatizing keeping a car between the lines on the road (doing it without thinking) frees up more space in working memory to, say, listen to the radio.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402608225", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Later we discuss it.\n\nDuring the planning some people wanted make this a political protest as well. \nThe reason to protest is quite simple. Our government spent about 11 billion USDs for the World Cup. Since we still have people who can not read nor write, it is kind of obvious there there would be better places for this money to be spent.\n\nThan again, who should we blame ?\n\nFifa ?\nC'mon... They are doing their job. \"We\" wanted a world cup and they must make sure it is going to be a good one. \n\nThe government ? \nHum... that is a good one. But.. wait... We do have a democratic voting system in Brazil and this political party has been in power for more than 10 years. They were elected by the people and there is no doubt the election was fair ( I never voted for this party).\n\nSo I guess those to blame are nobody but.... OURSELVES who:\n\na) voted on them\n\nb) did the first protest against the World Cup 30 days ago, instead of 6 years go when it was decided that we would host the protest. By the way in 2 years Brazil will host the Olympics. Story will repeat itself.\n\nc) stopped protesting and started cheering after the world cup started\n\nAhhh, by the way, just like in most of Europe, there are two kinds of Brazilians: those who like to work and those who don't.\n\nSo in the last 30 days, we had\n\n- bus strike in my city\n- subway strike in my city\n- airport strike in rio de janeiro\n(I actually lost the bet. I thought we would have train strike...)\n\nAnyway, in my opinion the ingress community decided not to strike because:\n\na) less than 300 people play ingress in our city, which is N O T H I N G since we have 18 million people, so whatever message we wrote would have had no practical relevance\n\nb) try to negotiate with 300 people to write a single message against the world cup/government/fifa/anything else. it won't ever happen\n\nc) if b) was possible, after the agreement there would have been a new single player who would be against that and would erase the message\n\nd) since we did something apolitical there would higher changes it would work, nobody would get hurt and we would improve even more the relationship and morale between both factions. we might even go to ingress report which is nice :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402644365", "subreddit": "Ingress", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

And people like that are pricks. They can't just accept the fact that some people like gaming on machines other than a PC, it seems to infuriate them. You always saw Xbox fanboys vs PlayStation fanboys on forums and in the comment sections of the internet slagging each other's machines off and it was pathetic back then. But recently that's taken a back seat to big headed, elitist, superiority complex ridden, delusional, aggressive, insulting, disrespecting, intolerant, moronic pricks who seem to think it's both big and/or clever to call a console gamer a \"peasant\" or other such terms meant to insinuate that the console gamer is somehow an inferior human being. Why can't we all just get along? You will almost N E V E R see a console gamer instigating a flame war against PC users. Pretty much the only time you'll ever see a console gamer insulting PC gamers is when they're retaliating against an unwarranted attack from the loudmouth snob with a God complex.\n\nBy all means you're free to play on PC, and of course you're totally free to express how much you like gaming on PC and the pros it has against console gaming.

Being a fanboy is tantamount to being a retard. To claim that something is shit simply because it's not the one you chose is the height of ignorance. You may not like consoles but they're far from shit as many of the idiotic side of the PC community claim they are. I love games, and PC gamers love games, it should be as simple as that. But the vocal minority  is always there, making their snide comments about how they're the \"master race\".\n\nBut I don't have faith that this will change any time soon.

{"body": "I disagree with the top comment. Before I had all this memorized by note names, here was the formula I used:\n\n**The key to this is to understand fundamentally that all chords are made of major thirds and minor thirds stacked on top of one another (except in the case of a perfect 4th, but ignore that for now).**\n\nTake all the notes in the chord and put them in order by letter. If a chord has more than one of the same note, that note only gets represented once. For example:\n\nE G C E  gets reordered to: C E G\n\nNow look at the intervals in order and try to make sense of them, paying close attention to thirds:\n\nMajor 3rd, Minor 3rd (M3, m3). Okay, that makes sense! A Major 3rd with a Minor 3rd on top always makes a major triad. The original chord is a C major chord with an E in the bass; also known as C major first inversion.\n\nLets do another:\n\nD G D Bb\n\ngoes to:\n\n Bb D G\n\nThat's a M3 and a P4 (perfect 4th). Nope. Not a triad yet! So what do I do? I **take the lowest note and invert it an octave up** and see if the chord makes sense in that context:\n\nBb D G\n\ngoes to:\n\n D G Bb\n\nThat gives us a P4 and a m3\n\nGetting closer, but still not a major or minor triad. Let's repeat the inversion thing with the lowest note again (D):\n\nD G Bb\n\ngoes to:\n\nG Bb D\n\nThat gives us a m3 and a M3. Eureka! A minor triad is always comprised of a major third stacked on top of a minor third. Our original chord was a Gm chord in second inversion!\n\nBut sometimes you have extensions (7ths, 9ths, etc.) or missing notes. This is when you really have to understand the fundamentals of how chords are built. The goal here is to always have a chord built of 3rds all the way up, with a basic major or minor triad in the bass (even if one of the notes may be missing):\n\nE B E G C G\n\nordered to:\n\nB C E G\n\nM2, M3, m3 = could be a crazy complicated jazz chord with two fundamental notes left out, but lets look for the simplest answer first: \n\nB C E G\n\ngoes to:\n\n C E G B\n\nM3, m3, M3 = a basic major chord triad in the bottom plus a b7th note extension. It's a C7 chord, originally in third inversion!\n\nHere's one with a note missing:\n\n F# C F# D\n\nC D F#\n\nM2, M3 = nope, not a basic triad. Let's invert:\n\nD F# C\n\nM3, m5 = uh oh...minor 5...something's wacky...\n\nThere must be a note missing between the F# and the C because chords are always comprised of 3rds, right? And you can always fit two minor thirds into the space of a m5 interval. Are there any notes between F# and C that would complete a D triad? Yep, A; the 5th of D. Let's pretend the A was included:\n\nD F# A C\n\nM3, m3, m3 = dominant 7 chord. \n\nThe original chord was a D7 first inversion.\n\nSo here's where everyone gets so confused about suspended 4th chords in the pop world, and I can'tblame them. Technically, suspended 4th chords don't exist. I know, I'm fucking crazy, right? But traditionally they don't. ..\n\nWhen theory was developed, music was based on voices. Choirs. Figured bass. Four-part harmony.The suspended 4th occurred when a single note from the previous bar stayed suspended an extra beat or two until falling a half or whole step down to where it's supposed to be. It was an effect, and we use it all the time in music today. This suspended note effectively creats a chord that *temporarily* does not contain a third (which is not supposed to happen based on how chords are harmonized and structured). Contextually, this note almost always fell down to where it was supposed to be, so the chord progression almost always went something like Csus4 to C major...F note falling down to E.\n\nThis is important to keep in mind when analyzing chords, because having sus4 chords in music means that sometimes a chord can have a P4 as the first interval in the bottom instead of a 3rd. With this mindset, the only other time a P4 will exist in a chord is in the case of an augmented chord, which is another situation that, for a few hundred years back in the day, was another \"broken rule\" of theory that was eventually accepted as common practice. Thanks be to jeebus that we can use perfect 4ths again...\n\n\n\nHope that makes sense. Just always think in thirds. Eventually you'll have it all memorized and you'll see inversions immediately.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402687644", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Mag die Wiederher- \nstellung der Mainlinie für den Augenblick \nvielleicht Vorteile versprechen, die schon während des \nKrieges eine unterirdische Propaganda unserer Feinde \nder Bevölkerung glaubhaft zu machen versuchte, auf die \nDauer — das lehren die Jahrhunderte deutscher Ge- \nschichte — wird eine solche Trennung mit Sicherheit \nzum Untergang staatlicher und wirtschaftlicher Selb- \nständigkeit der getrennten Glieder führen. Das \ndeutsche Volk ist über alle staatlichen \nGrenzen, auch über die Grenzen des \nalten Reiches hinaus, eine lebendige \nEinheit, und das einige Reich ist seine \nnatürliche Lebensform. \n\nEs liegt mir fern, hier die Weltgeschichte rückwärts \nrevidieren zu wollen und pangermanistische Ziele zu \npredigen. Blutsverwandte Völker, die in vielen Jahr- \nhunderten eigener Geschichte sich das Recht erworben \nhaben, als selbständige Nationalität zu gelten, rechnen \nwir nicht zu den Volksgenossen. Wir denken weder \ndaran, aus Schweizern noch aus Niederländern \nDeutsche machen zu wollen; von den skandinavi- \nschen Völkern annektieren wir nur die Sagen ihrer \nVorzeit und die Dichter ihrer Gegenwart; aber mit \nunseren österreichischen Brüdern hatten \nwir bis zum Zusammenbruche des Römischen Reiches \ndeutscher Nation die gleiche Geschichte. Wir saßen \nmit ihnen in der Paulskirche zusammen, und die \nkriegerische Auseinandersetzung, die statt der groß- \ndeutschen die kleindeutsche Idee verwirklichte, ist für \ndie Besten unter uns immer ein Bruderkrieg gewesen. \nWenn wir uns jetzt wieder zusammenfinden, nachdem \nihnen alle nichtdeutschen Stämme der habsburgischen \nMonarchie die Freundschaft gekündigt haben, so wissen \nwir, daß wir nur eine späte Korrektur an einem Fehler \nder Reichsgründung vornehmen, der die Friedenskonfe- \nrenz ihre Sanktion ganz gewiß nicht versagen wird. \n\nSchon jetzt darf die Deutsche Nationalversammlung \nund darf ich als Leiter deutscher auswärtiger Politik \nVerwahrung einlegen gegen die Unbill, die Deutsch- \nÖsterreich von ehemaligen Reichsgenossen angetan wird. \nDer neue tschecho-slowakische Staat ver- \nletzt das Gesetz, dem er die Selbstentstehung verdankt, \nindem er nicht nur die Deutschen Böhmens und Mäh- \nrens mit Waffengewalt unter seine Botmäßigkeit zu \nzwingen sucht, sondern auch naqh Südosten hin von \nDeutschen bewohntes Gebiet beansprucht. Das öster- \nreichische Schlesien und Gebiete Niederösterreichs, da- \nzu deutsche Siedlungen in den österreichisch-unga- \nrischen Grenzgebieten, will der neue Staat unter seine \nHerrschaft beugen, um seinen wirtschaftlichen Ausdeh- \nnungsdrang zu befriedigen. Selbst auf deutsches Reichs- \ngebiet droht er überzugreifen. Gegen solche Übergriffe \nmuß scharfer Protest eingelegt werden. Über die wirt- \nschaftlichen Bedürfnisse des tschecho-slowakischen \nStaates, die aus der Abgeschlossenheit vom Meere her- \nzuleiten sind, wird ruhig verhandelt werden können. \nDas neue Deutschland hat am Gedeihen \ndes aufstrebenden Nachbarn ein glei- \nches vitales Interesse wie dieser an \nDeutschlands wirtschaftlicher Gesund- \nheit. Nichts würde für das Zusammenleben der beiden \nStaaten schädlicher sein, als wenn ein Volkskörper dem \nanderen jetzt Wunden schlüge, die nicht vernarben \nkönnen, sondern immer wieder zur Vergeltung reizen \nmüßten. \n\nSind wir hiernach entschlossen, ringsumher zu- \ngunsten deutscher Brüder das Recht der Nationalität \ngeltend zu machen, so wollen wir das Recht auch da \nanerkennen, wo es sich gegen unsere jetzige Machtstel- \nlung wendet. Das gilt vor allem für das Volk der Polen.\nWir haben uns bereit erklärt, alle unzweifel- \nhaft polnisch besiedelten Gebiete unseres Reiches mit \ndem polnischen Staat verbinden zu lassen. Wir wollen \ndas Versprechen halten. Welche Gebiete unter den \n13. Punkt von Wilsons Programm fallen, ist strittig. \nEine unparteiische Instanz mag darüber entscheiden; \nbis sie entschieden, gehören diese Gebiete zum Reich. \nNiemand ist befugt, in ihnen Hoheitsrechte auszuüben, \nals der preußische Staat und die Reichsregierung. Die \nleidenschaftliche national-polnische Propaganda hat die \nEntscheidung der Friedenskonferenz nicht abwarten \nwollen, sondern sich mit Gewalt gegen deutsche und \npreußische Behörden erhoben. Verlockt durch die \nleichten Erfolge, die ihnen der militärische Zusammen- \nbruch Deutschlands ermöglichte, haben die Preußen \npolnischen Stammes auf unzweifelhaft deutsch besiedel- \ntes Gebiet übergegriffen, um mit möglichst günstigem \nBesitzstand in die Friedensverhandlungen einzutreten. \nSo tragen sie die Schrecknisse des Krieges von neuem \nin den deutschen Osten, der gleichzeitig von der größe- \nren Gefahr des bolschewistischen Imperialismus bedroht \nist. So verhindern sie uns, die preußischen Ost- \nprovinzen wirksam vor dem gemeinsamen Gegner zu \nschützen. \n\nMan sollte denken, diese Tatsachen müßten aus- \nreichen, um jedem Politiker klar zu machen, daß es die \nerste Aufgabe ist, die preußischen Polen zur Ordnung \nzu rufen, damit sie bis zur Friedenskonferenz von der \nangemaßten Gewalt Abstand nehmen. Sie können sich \nnicht mehr auf Notwehr berufen, denn die neue \ndeutsche Regierung hat die drückenden Sondergesetze\naufgehoben und war bereit, Polen auch in der Beamten- \nauswahl entgegenzukommen. Trotzdem stellen die \nPolen uns als Angreifer dar — man wird wirklich an \ndie alte Lafontainesche Fabel erinnert — , und die En- \ntente unternimmt es, uns Anwendung von Gewalt gegen \ndie Polen in unserem eigenen Lande zu untersagen. Die \nReichsregierung hat diese Zumutung abgelehnt und die \nEntfernung aller bewaffneten polnischen Formationen \naus dem jetzigen Reichsgebiet gefordert. Für jede \nandere Form der Einwirkung, mit der die alliierten und \nassoziierten Mächte Ruhe in polnischen Gebieten her- \nstellen wollen, wird die deutsche Regierung volles Ver- \nständnis haben. Wir sind durch das Waffenstillstands- \nabkommen verpflichtet, Abordnungen unserer Gegner \nzu diesem Zweck Durchzug von der Ostsee nach Kon- \ngreßpolen zu gestatten, und werden die Reise der Kom- \nmission, die sie uns angekündigt haben, in jeder Weise \nerleichtern und unterstützen. \n\nUnser eigener Vorteil verlangt, daß die Haßatmo- \nsphäre, die augenblicklich die deutsch-polnischen Be- \nziehungen vergiftet, noch vor Beginn der Friedensver- \nhandlungen reinerer Luft des gegenseitigen Verständ- \nnisses weicht. Leider können wir nicht vor- \naussehen, daß wir im polnischen Staat \neinen bequemen Nachbar haben werden. \nEs muß und wird unser Bestreben sein, durch sorgfältige \nPflege der gemeinsamen Interessen und durch gegen- \nseitige Schonung der so verschiedenen nationalen Eigen- \nart einen modus vivendi zu finden. Dazu gehört vor \nallem die Anerkennung der polnischen Rechte auf ge- \nsicherten Verkehr mit der Ostsee. Das Problem kann \ndurch vertragsmäßige Regelung der Weichselschiffahrt \nund durch Konzessionen auf dem Gebiet der Eisen- \nbahnen und des Hafenwesens gelöst werden, ohne daß \ndie Reichshoheit über unveräußerliches westpreußisches \nGebiet angetastet zu werden braucht. Wenn Polen ver- \nlangt, daß diese Rechte, wie überhaupt seine staatliche \nSelbständigkeit, unter internationale Garantien gestellt \nwerden, so wird Deutschland nichts dagegen einzu- \nwenden haben, solange darin keine Spitze gegen einen \nbestimmten Nachbarn enthalten ist. \n\nWas den deutschen Polen recht ist, ist den deut- \nschen Dänen billig. Die deutsche Regierung faßt es \nals Pflicht auf, das Selbstbestimmungsrecht den Dänen \nzu gewähren, das sie für die Deutschen verlangt. Nach \nder Entwicklung, die die Dinge genommen haben, hoffe \nich, daß an unserer Nordgrenze ein Vorbild geschaffen \nwird, wie in freier Verständigung, in redlichem Aus- \ngleich langjähriger Völkerzwist zu aufrichtiger, dauern- \nder Völkerversöhnung geführt wird. Das deutsche Volk \nist in dem Wunsch einig, mit dem dänischen in guten, \ndurch keinen heimlichen Groll gestörten Beziehungen «zu \nleben. Das dänische Volk wird gewiß in seiner Mehr- \nheit dafür eintreten, daß Deutschlands Niederlage nicht \nmißbraucht wird, um deutsches Land dänisch zu \nmachen. Wer aufrichtig ein gutes Verhältnis beider \nNachbarländer zueinander wünscht, kann die Gefahren \nnicht verkennen, die die Schaffung einer Ir- \nre d e n t a unvermeidlich nach sich zöge.

{"body": "Die Probleme der Gebiets- und Wirtschaftspolitik, \ndie ich bisher gestreift habe, sind in der einen oder \nanderen Form von jeher der Gegenstand der Friedens- \nVerhandlungen gewesen, mit denen die Kriegsperioden \nder Weltgeschichte ihren Abschluß gefunden haben. \nDie Verhandlungen, die uns erwarten, werden aber \neinen Gegenstand enthalten, durch den sie sich von \nallen früheren charakteristisch unterscheiden. Er spielt \nkeine Rolle in dem Wilsonschen Programm, aber in \nallen Völkern, die an dem Kriege beteiligt waren — und \nwelches Volk der Welt wäre nicht an ihm beteiligt? — , \nverlangen Millionen Herzen, daß diesem Gegenstand die \nernsteste Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet wird, und mühen \nsich die besten Köpfe, an der Lösung mitzuarbeiten. \nIch spreche von der internationalen \nRegelung der sozialen Frage, \n\nMeine Damen und Herren! Wie nach den Stürmen \ndes Reformationszeitalters Friedensschlüsse undenkbar \nwaren ohne Bestimmungen über religiöse Freiheit, wie \nnach den Erschütterungen der französischen Revolution \ndie Frage der politischen Freiheit die Friedenskongresse \nbewegte, so muß nach dem Weltkriege der \nVolksmassen die Frage der sozialen Be- \nfreiung der Arbeiterschaft internatio- \nnal entschieden werden. Man kann diese \nForderung schon auf dem Prinzip der wirtschaftlichen \nGleichberechtigung begründen, denn dieses Prinzip will \njedem Gliede der Völkergemeinschaft auf den Welt- \nmärkten gleiche Möglichkeiten eröffnen. Es würde zum \nNachteil sozial gewissenhafterer und fortgeschrittener \nNationen ausschlagen, wenn es den Ausbeutern mensch- \nlicher Arbeitskraft freistünde, den ungerechten Vorteil \nihrer niedrigen Produktionskosten zur Ausschaltung \nihrer Mitbewerber auszunutzen. Schon deshalb ist es \nein gemeinsames Interesse der Arbeiterschaft aller \nLänder, daß der Arbeitsausbeutung in jeder Form durch \neine internationale Annäherung der sozialen Gesetz- \ngebung ein Ende gemacht wird. Aber das Ziel, das hier \nverfolgt wird, ist nicht nur materiell, es ist edlerer Na- \ntur, ihm liegt der Gedanke zugrunde, die allen Menschen \ngemeinsame Aufgabe, das Leben innerlich reicher und \nvollkommener zu gestalten und nicht inmitten gestei- \ngerter Zivilisation zu Maschinenteilen des Produktions- \nprozesses herabzusinken. Dieser Gedanke hat sich mit \nso elementarer Kraft Bahn gebrochen, daß Kreise, die \nihm jetzt noch widerstreben und ihn durch andere Ideale \nersetzen möchten, seien es Ideale des Händlers oder \ndes Helden, sich schließlich vor der Wucht sozialer \nKräfte werden beugen müssen. Ich denke dabei nicht \nan gewaltsame Entscheidungen, im Gegenteil sehe ich \nz. B. in der Gewaltpolitik der russi- \nschen B o 1 s c h e wi s t e n einen Hauptgrund \ndafür, daß die sozialen Gedanken, die \nin ihrer Bewegung enthalten sind, zum \nElend statt zum Aufstieg geführt wer- \nden. Es handelt sich um friedliche Verständigung \nüber den Weg, den die soziale Entwicklung nehmen \nsoll. Gerade Deutschland läuft hier nicht die Gefahr \neiner zerrüttenden Umgestaltung seiner Verhältnisse. \nSeit Jahrzehnten hat das Deutsche Reich auf jenem \nWege, den alle gehen müssen, bedeutsame Fortschritte \ngemacht. Der Gedanke sozialer Befreiung ist nirgends \nmehr zu Hause als in Deutschland. Das legt uns die \nvornehme Pflicht auf, Frieden nicht zu schließen ohne \nden Versuch, unser soziales Programm international zu \nsichern. Es war eine Verleugnung unseres \nsozialen Geistes, daß die Friedensver- \nträge, die Deutschland mit den Ost- \nmächten abschloß, reinkapitalistischen \nCharakter trugen. Solche Verträge sind heute \nfür jeden Sieger eine Gefahr. Die deutsche Regierung \nist entschlossen, sich bei den Vorschlägen für Friedens- \nbestimmungen über Arbeiterrecht, Arbeiterschutz und \nArbeiterversicherung wesentlich auf den Boden der Be- \nschlüsse der bekannten Konferenzen in Leeds und \nBern zu stellen. Die Fülle dieser Bestimmungen, die \ngewiß für manchen der beitretenden Staaten umwäl- \nzende Neuerungen bedeuten werden, bedürfen zur Ver- \nwirklichung fortlaufender internationaler Kontrolle. Der \nRegierungsentwurf regelt daher die Arbeitsaufsicht \nunter Zuziehung der Berufsorganisationen und will inter- \nnationale Instanzen zur Überwachung und Fortführung \nder sozialen Gesetzgebung einrichten. Geplant ist eine \nalle fünf Jahre in Bern zusammentretende soziale Kon- \nferenz; eine ständige Kommission soll die laufenden Ge- \nschäfte führen und mit dem internationalen Arbeitsamt \nin Basel dauernd Fühlung halten. \n\nMeine Damen und Herren! Dieses große Programm \neiner internationalen Sozialpolitik kann nicht durchge- \nführt werden ohne ein dauerndes, vertrauensvolles Zu- \nsammenarbeiten aller zivilisierten Nationen. \n\nVom kommenden Frieden erwarten wir, daß er der \nWelt in dem von Wilson verkündeten Völkerbund eine \nfeste Organisation schafft, die allein eine solche Zusam- \nmenarbeit ermöglicht. Der Gedanke der Liga \nder Nationen, der kürzlich noch als Traumbild \nideologischer Schwärmer erschien, steigt jetzt \naus dem Nebelland der Utopien in das \nklare Licht der Wirklichkeit, in dem \npraktische Staatsmänner arbeiten. Schon \nhat man in Paris dem kommenden Völkerbund große \nMengen brennender Streitfragen überwiesen, die man \nim Meinungsaustausch der Interessen nicht erledigen \nkonnte. \n\nDeutschland ist entschlossen, an der Ausgestaltung \ndes Bundes rückhaltlos mitzuarbeiten, obwohl die an- \nderen uns nur mit tiefem Mißtrauen zulassen werden, \nund der Bund in erster Linie gegründet wird, um \nDeutschland an der Fortsetzung einer Jcriegerischen \nPolitik, die uns doch völlig fernliegt, zu hindern. Dieses \nMißtrauen müssen wir durch Beweise aufrichtiger \nFriedensliebe überwinden. \n\nEin solcher Beweis wird zunächst in unserer ent- \nschlossenen Abkehr von jeder Rüstungspolitik liegen. \nDie Abkehr wird uns Deutschen nicht schwer fallen, \ndenn kein Volk hat stärker als wir empfunden, wie sich \nder Rüstungswahnsinn schließlich ad absurdum führt. \nSchon aus wirtschaftlichen und finanziellen Gründen ist \nDeutschland darauf angewiesen, eine Rüstung auf das \nMaß zu beschränken, das mit der Aufrechterhaltung der \nOrdnung im Innern und der Sicherung der Grenzen nach \naußen irgend vereinbar ist. Sollten uns, was ich nicht \nannehmen will, militärische Vorbereitungen unserer \nNachbarn künftig zwingen, über jenes Maß hinauszu- \ngehen, so werden gerade wir das als schwere Last emp- \nfinden, denn unsere ganze Kraft an Menschen und Mit- \nteln gehört dem inneren Wiederaufbau unseres Vater- \nlandes. Es wäre ein Irrtum zu glauben, daß bei der \nKonzentrierung der Kräfte auf die friedliche Arbeit im \nInnern die äußere Politik zu kurz käme. Denn eine \nAußenpolitik, die sich auf überlegene Waffenmacht \nstützt, ist zwar eine bequeme, aber meist eine schlechte \nund unfruchtbare Politik. Von mir jedenfalls \nwerden Sie nur eine solche Führung \nder R e i c h s g e s c h ä f t e erwarten dürfen, \ndie nicht alle Augenblicke ans Schwert \nschlägt, um ihre Absichten durchzu- \nsetzen, sondern den Gegner davon über- \nzeugt, daß es sein eigenes Interesse \ni s t , a u f u n sere Absich t e n e i n z u g e h e n. \n\nDie äußere Abrüstung allein genügt aber nicht, es \nmuß die geistige Abrüstung mit ihr Hand in Hand gehen, \nund die Nation, die ihrer Jugend die edleren Ziele zeigt, \nwird sicherlich nicht am schlechtesten dabei fahren. \n\nAlle Differenzen rechtlichen Charakters, die zwi- \nschen uns und einem anderen Volk auftauchen, müssen \nwir in versöhnlichem Geiste behandeln, und wenn sie \ndiplomatisch nicht zu schlichten sind, dem Urteil des \nSchiedsgerichts unterbreiten. Auch auf die Gefahr hin, \ndaß uns einmal Unrecht geschehen könnte; weil wir \nverkannt werden, müssen wir an dem Schiedsge- \nrichtsgedanken festhalten. Daneben werden wir \nuns angelegen sein lassen, für Interessenfragen, die sich \nrein rechtlicher Beurteilung entziehen, internationale \nEinrichtungen zur Vermittlung und Einigung auszubauen. \nEin Vorbild für solche Einigungsämter bilden die be- \nkannten Bryanschen Verträge, die schon jetzt zahlreiche \nStaaten verbinden und sie vor übereilten militärischen \nEntschlüssen zu bewahren bestimmt sind. Der Ausbau \ndes Vermittlungswesens im Völkerbund wird dazu füh- \nren, daß Meinungsdifferenzen zwischen seinen Mitglie- \ndern beigelegt werden, ehe sie die Schärfe angenommen \nhaben, die einen Richterspruch fordert. Ich bin über- \nzeugt, daß die positiven Aufgaben, die dem Bund zu- \nkünftig gestellt werden, sich nur bei fester dauerhafter \nOrganisation werden erfüllen lassen. Daraus ergibt sich \ndie Notwendigkeit gemeinsamer Verwaltungsbehörden \nund einer Art Bundesparlament, wie es von der inter- \nparlamentarischen Union vorbereitet ist. \n\nSchließlich bedarf der Völkerbund gewisser Zwangs- \nmittel, um seine Beschlüsse. zu vollstrecken. Damit be- \nrühre ich einen der heikelsten Punkte, weil der Staat, \nder sich im voraus mit einer gewaltsamen Vollstreckung \nvon Entscheidungen einverstanden erklärt, die gegen \nihn selbst ergangen sind, auf einen erheblichen Teil \nseiner Souveränität verzichtet. Ein solches Opfer kann \neinem freien Volke nur zugemutet werden, wenn es an \nder Exekutive beteiligt ist und auch seinerseits die \nMittel des Zwanges zur Verfügung stellt. In einen \nVölkerbund, bei dem wir ausschließ- \nlich Objekt der Exekutive sein würden, \nwerden wir nicht eintreten können.

{"body": "**--------= = = = M A L A Y O S = = = =--------**\n\nThe Malayos represent the peoples living in the Maritime Southeast Asia, but mainly the Malays living in present-day Indonesia and Malaysia. There were several empires here including Srivijaya and the Majapahit Empire, the Melayu Kingdom (from which I derive the name for the civ, just to make it sound medieval and less ethnically-oriented) which had a far reach. They had conflicts with Indian kingdoms as well as the Khmer and even the Mongols and Chinese and later on the Portuguese. I co-opted the Spanish Supremacy tech for some unique gameplay. The Malayos will have a high emphasis on building forward Bombard Towers in the late game thanks to some very durable Villagers.\n\nThe Malays most important units are:\n\nMaharlika - Their UU, some sort of Infantry swordsman. Don't know which role they'll have yet.\n\nElephant Archer line - 25% cheaper\n\nHalberdier line - Some sort of meatshield for their Elephant Archers and Villagers\n\nSkirmisher line - Anti-Archer purposes\n\nVillagers - This may be where I put the old Spanish UT Supremacy (or at least a toned down version available in the Castle Age). They would be the strongest Villagers in the game, cheap, and armed with anti-building destroying power PLUS they can build Bombard Towers.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;Villagers benefit from Infantry blacksmith techs\n\n* I'm pairing this with the old Spanish Supremacy UT for the Malayos. I don't have specific historical reasoning, but the Malayos are related to the Polynesians and Filipinos, and they all have a reputation for their toughness. So there's that.\n\n&gt;Economic bonus:\n\n* I want an eco bonus that has something to do with expansion and building new colonies.\n\n&gt;Naval bonus:\n\n* The Malays should be one of the few civs to have a direct naval bonus.\n\n&gt;Elephants cost -25%\n\n* This bonus is shared with the Indians and Khmer but the Malayos get the cheapest Elephants in the game. I don't really know much about warfare with Elephants in that part of the world. They were used for sure but I don't know to what extent. In comparison, the Indian kingdoms had many surviving primary and secondary sources that describe the training and capture of Elephants, as well as the size and scope of their elephant armies.\n\nHowever today, the Malay peninsula is home to the highest concentration of Asian Elephants, so there's my justification for this bonus. I would plan for the Malayos have an Infantry Unique Unit, whereas the Indians and Khmer get Elephant UUs (and the Persians get the strongest Elephants but no cost reduction bonus). So the Malayos get the ability to field the most Elephants out of any civ. \n\n&gt;Teams Bonus: \n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Maharlika: \n\n* I still don't know what kind of UU this guy will be. I've been trying to formulate an army for the Malayos but I haven't figured out a good role for him. The Maharlika were a feudal caste of warriors similar to Knights or Huskarls in the Philippines and it was said that they had originally came from Malaysia. Maharlika primarily fought as heavy, shock Infantry due to the rarity of horses in that part of the world. Maharlika comes from the Sanskrit word \"Mahavira,\" which shows the distance of Hindu influence.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Keris: Villagers increased combat skills (less than Supremacy)\n\n* The Spanish Imperial UT is given to the Malayos, and it's available in the Castle Age! This means that the Malayos will have very, very strong Villagers with their bonuses. The Keris sword refers to semi-ceremonial swords carried by the Malay people. In fact many chroniclers of the Malay kingdoms claim that EVERY male citizen carried a Keris with them for religious and ceremonial purposes as well as for self-defense. Even many women carried Keris swords. Punishments were also carried out with the Keris and families could wield the same Keris swords for generations. Analogous swords along with analogous cultural implications show up all over southeast Asia.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Daulat: \n\n* Uhh I read about \"Daulat\" somewhere a long time ago, which is some sort of Malaysian idea about their independence and self-rule but I couldn't find anything about it after that. I'm still working on it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n&gt;Infantry: \n\n* I'm not sure what I would do to the Infantry tech tree, considering that the civ is going to have an Infantry UU wielding a sword.\n\n&gt;Archery: get all techs?\n\n* I want there to be several civs that have all techs and units of one branch. For Infantry, it might be the Teutons. For Cavalry, the Persians. For Siege, the Koreans. For Archery, I thought about the Turks but one of my major Archery Range units is a Meso-only unit known as the Atlatl Skirmisher that is sort of a compromise between the Cavalry Archer and AoE2's Eagle Warrior for the Meso civs. I was going to justify the Turks having Atlatls by coming up with a UT based on the Turkish spear throwing game of Jureed. However atlatl-like weapons are used in New Guinea, and many Malay kingdoms had control of parts of Guinea. So the Malays could plausibly have access to Composite Bows, Atlatls, Handguns, and Elephants. The only obstacle here is the fact that the Malays do not seem to have a cavalry archer tradition. At any rate, I think the Malays will get the Atlatl Skirmisher, anyway, as well as the imposing Elephant Archer. This would make the Malayos the only non-Meso civ with access to the Atlatl Skirmisher.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: no Camels, Cavalier, Light Cavalry\n\n* The Malays should be lacking in cavalry due to the difficulty of raising horses in their mountainous and jungled islands. But they did have horses.\n\n&gt;Siege: no Capped Ram, Onager\n\n* Siege should be mostly lacking since there is very little evidence of Malays using Siege weapons. However they did use cannons and the Malay states that traded with China loved to put tons of cannons on their ships.\n\n&gt;Monks: \n\n* The Malays tended to be pretty open to new religious ideas, at times having their own indigenous beliefs, then becoming Hindu, Buddhist, and becoming majority Muslim, while a sizeable portion of them converted to Christianity during colonization.\n\n&gt;Navy: \n\n* The Malays should have a top notch Navy with most technologies but I haven't really thought much of it yet.  They will get Cannon Galleons, though, and also an extra naval specific bonus. I was thinking a UT called \"Outrigging.\" Outrigger ships have \"rigging\" \"out\"side of the main body of the ship. These are additional \"wings\" that are attached to the ship via multiple poles and float parallel to the ship thus providing extra stability. \n\n&gt;Defenses: \n\n* The Malays were notable for not making use of portable gunpowder weapons but they had tons of them on their ships as well as swivel guns on defenses. So for a civilization with strong Villagers, they should definitely focus on creating Bombard Towers!\n\n&gt;Economy: \n\n* I haven't given much thought to the Malay economy, but they should have crappy Farming due to their reliance on fishing. They should have alot of gold due to controlling trade between China and India.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402692875", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "People shouldn't be commenting if they didnt/don't play H2,  own a scuf to begin with on what they think is hard, easy, fair, and broken. That being said...\n\nI've played claw since h2 when I was around the skill level of 35ish I couldn't get higher without host to make sure a fair game was played with the amount of cheating with mods and standbying going  on. I bought a Scuf around 2 years ago and used it for around a year while messing with the paddles and claw to see what felt better. \n\nThe reason I picked up a Scuf was often in CoD and Halo people would accuse me of having one based on the actions you are able to perform simultaneously with the default layout while clawing (or if maybe there wasnt even a layout available thay made those actions possible without clawing) But personally for me the only thing the paddles did was make it easier on my hands when playing 10+hrs a day because pressing the four buttons with the side of your pointer finger really takes its toll if you play a lot each day. I didn't feel I gained any competitive advantage over playing claw personally so I reverted to using a standard controller that felt good to me and continued to play claw as I had always felt it was the most natural for me ever since h2. \n\nFor someone who doesn't play claw and maybe has a lack of layout options in Halo MCC.. then yes u will be at a slight disadvantage if you can't play claw for a various amount of reasons.. I have really small hands for a guy so that might be why it is easier for me and some people struggle and end up getting a Scuf or using a different layout but as far as a competitive standpoint I think Scufs are fine BUT MACRO CONTROLLERS that automatically execute things such as R R X Y Y R R X perfectly are not okay in my book.\n\nTldr: Scuf vs Claw is comfort preference while a programmable macro controller is an unfair advantage aka cheating.\n\nPeople that don't like to claw and don't have  Scuf will be at a slight disadvantage if there isn't a control scheme that allows you to keep both thumbs on the joysticks while pressing melee and reload.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402705665", "subreddit": "halo", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I disagree with /u/scifihawk27... I think the system we have makes a good amount of logical sense.  I can't fully answer your questions, but I think I can give a good start:\n\n&gt; I am curious why modern system is characterized by such features like 12 notes and separation of notes to \"black\" and \"white\"\n\nIt's really all about diatonic scales.  There are 12 notes in an octave but in western music theory is centered around diatonic scales.  By looking at a diatonic scale, the notes are sequential letters, with some of them being sharp or flat.\n\n* C D E F G A B\n* F G A B♭C D E\n* G A B C D E F♯\n* D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭ C\n\nI think this is actually less confusing than having unique names for each note\n\n&gt; Also, why not all notes have their #-version? This looks the most strange to me.\n\nAll notes *do* have a sharp and flat version.  Look at the key of G♭/F♯... it can easily be interpreted as a flat key or a sharp key:\n\n* G♭ A♭ B♭ C♭ D♭ E F\n* F♯ G♯ A♯ B C♯ D♯ E♯\n\nEither the scale has a C♭ or a E♯, which is are represented as white keys.\n\n&gt; Why is this [diatonic] scale so important? Why not other scale?\n\nFrom my understanding (this could be wrong), there's nothing especially special about diatonic scales other than that's what our ears are used to and that's the way western music has evolved.  Diatonic scales are nice because there are two half steps which gives us a way to orient ourselves in aurally.\n\n&gt; so there is no one simple pattern because of this diatonic scheme: sometimes fifth gives the same color of key as its base and sometimes it changes color.\n\nOnly B♭-&gt; F (it really should be spelled this way instead of A#-&gt;F) and B -&gt; F♯ change colors, the rest are white-&gt;white or black-&gt;black.  But don't focus too much on \"black vs. white\"  When you learn more about music and playing piano, \"black vs. white\" matters less and less and you just start to think in certain keys.\n\nAlso, from a purely practical point of view, if you didn't have black keys, how would you orient yourself on the keyboard?  Where would you find C?  The more I learn about playing piano the more I realize that while it can be unintuitive at first, it really does make a lot of sense when you internalize it.\n\nOf course, I could be biased because I'm fairly good at the current system so I do prefer it over alternate systems that I'm not familiar with.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402758756", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

A melody line of E E F G G F E D transposed down a major third (4 semi-tones) would be C C D♭E♭E♭D♭B♭.  Notice how every note is lowered by 4 half-steps.\n\nNow, the spelling of the notes (is it B♭ or A#?) comes from the key you're in.  The first melody could be in C major and the second transposed melody would be in A♭major.\n\nThis is really all there is to it... and it applies to chords as well.

{"body": "&gt; Why do we need these variations like perfect/minor/major/diminished/augmented\n\nIt's a hard question to answer and I don't know if I can do it fully maybe there's something better in the FAQ for this... but I view it as being a convenient way to think about music.\n\nTake for example the most basic chords... they're all \"stacked thirds\"... like C7 is C E G Bb (C-&gt;E is a major third, E-&gt;G is a minor 3rd, G-&gt;B♭ is a minor third) But musicians just say they're \"thirds\" abstractly, so that's why we say that C-&gt;E is a \"third\" but there are variations... C-&gt;E♭ is a minor third and C-&gt;E is a major third.  So to construct a chord, you \"stack thirds\".  Some are major, some are minor.\n\nA major chord in root position is a minor third on top of a major third and a minor chord in root position is a major third on top of a minor third.\n\nAlso look at something like the comparison of two scales: C major and C minor:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nC D E♭F G A♭B♭\n\nThe first scale degree to the sixth scale degree is always a \"sixth\", but in this case the sixth scale degree is either A or A♭.  So you'd use language like \"The minor scale has a flat 3, 6, and 7 relative to the major\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1402762536", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There are too many to just start listing, it's so hard! Besides a lot of the ones that instantly came to my mind are pretty experimental so I wouldn't even recommend those to the casual listener.\n\nSome semi-unknown, some of these are pretty popular among their own genre but a casual listener still probably has never heard of these, since I don't think they play on the radio.\n\nThe one band that I instantly thought was **Ulver**. Not the most unknown, at least now but they're great. They started out as a black metal band so unless you're into that stuff I wouldn't recommend their bm albums as your introduction to the band. They have huge range, stuff ranging from black metal, electronic, trip hop, orchestral, avant-garde, film scores prog rock etc. They pretty much have a new sound on every album. The best album to start is probably [Shadows of the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9kGpx88MoE). Their most popular album and probably their most well known song. Not my favorite by them but a very good album. I recommend listening to them all. *Perdition City* is probably my favorite, also one of my favorite albums ever.\n\n**Ben Frost's** new album *A U R O R A* is freaking amazing. I still gotta listen to it more but right now, it almost feels like a masterpiece to me. [Here is a sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LJ2X1ZRVmA). He makes experimental electronic music/drone whatever. The album is like a soundtrack to some sci-fi classic that was never made. Speaking of sci-fi classics, Frost also did a new  soundtrack to Solaris with Daníel Bjarnason, it's [fucking beautiful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqCU-a8-eAo)\n\nIf you like **Tim Hecker** or **Oneohtrix Point Never** you should listen to him. You should also listen to those two artists I just mentioned.  I think Frost is gonna be a bigger name soon, at least as big as Hecker.\n\nGonna post some more quickly, I'm too tired to write more. May edit this post later:\n\n[Carpenter Brut](http://carpenterbrut.bandcamp.com) kicks ass. If you like stuff like the music on Hotline Miami soundtrack, listen to this.\n\n[Grails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAnbR2a2IxA) is the best new post-rock band. Influenced more by folk and old prog rather than just copying the Sigur Ros/Mogwai sound like every other post-rock band.\n\n[Ola Podrida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1jbPiEg2m4) is nice, lovely indie folk. Project of the composer David Wingo (Take Shelter, most David Gordon Green movies)\n\n[Holy Sons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLwvtdPSwYM), more folk. Project of Emil Amos from Grails.\n\n[Strand of Oaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yuTL2WAJQs) is brilliant folk.\n\n[Nicolas Jaar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCQpqSqeoMI) is already becoming one of my favorite electronic artists and he's ONLY 24 jesus fuck that guy is so talented.\n\n[Chipper Jones](http://chipperjones.bandcamp.com) is a pretty awesome math/post-rock band with not much stuff out yet, if they continue to release material as good/better as now they're definitely gonna get more known.\n\nOkay I'm too tired to think of more, hopefully this thread will come more active.

{"body": "Well any brand with 28 bands uses UK sizing, but other ways you can tell (say if you're thinking of sizing up in the band to a 30E/F), UK sizing follows a fairly consistent pattern of double letters except it messes up a-c and vowels, it doesn't double a-c or e and it skips the letter I completely. It goes a b c d dd e f ff g gg h hh j jj k kk L LL etc etc. US sizing varies brand to brand, it's super inconsistent and each brand will call the same cup sizes different things, but some clues are if it has the size DDD or skips any of the letters e-g or has the cup size I. Some US websites will take UK bras and list US sizes (I'm looking at you ASOS!) which is frustrating and stupid so I would make a mental note that a UK F is 2 cup sizes bigger than a DD and an FF is 3sizes bigger because US and UK are the same until they get to DD so you can just count up sizes to find what you need. However most sites that sell 28 bands don't do this so it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If it's an Australian brand you'll be able to tell because the band sizes use much smaller numbers, their 6 is equivalent to a 28, 8 to a 30. AUS cups are just like UK except some (but not all brands) skip FF and go straight to G.

{"body": "One thing that confused me at first is that when Allan says \"minor,\" he really means Dorian.  To me, minor means natural minor or Aeolian (A B C D E F G in the key of Am).  A Dorian is A B C D E F# G.  This means to me that he tends to use Dorian as his \"go to\" scale.  communistdaughter45 is correct in that there are some melodic minor (A B C D E F G# in Am) modes happening here--pretty common for fusion players who solo over lots of substitutions.  Maybe some whole-tone runs too.\n\nThe people heavy into theory can explain this better than I can, but in a nutshell, every tone is either in key or out of key.  If you're on an out-of key tone, you probably want to move towards an \"in\" tone, or better yet, a chord tone.  It's all about tension and resolution.  \n\nIn blues(for example), you may begin your solo on the root, then create tension by moving away from it.  Then you can release the tension by coming back to the root, or a maybe a different chord tone.

{"body": "I've been listening to B L A C K I E since 2009, before Death Grips was even a thing. I live in Houston and I've been to tons of this dude's shows. I feel like this dude deserves some attention because he's been doing his thing for almost 10 years now and he has helped this kind of genre that Death Grips is known for get big. People are truly biting his style though. There's even an article where he said that Kanye heard him in the studio. http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/08/between_the_spa.php\n\nIn my opinion, B L A C K I E is more raw than Death Grips. He's not cryptic. He's pretty straight-forward with his lyrics and blunt. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be into Death Grips. I remember at one point I got mad because when Death Grips was getting popular, a lot of people were saying B L A C K I E was ripping them off and shit, even though he's been making that type of music since 2005.\n\nOverall, people should at least give B L A C K I E some props for making this sound popular and the passion he has for doing this for almost a decade. If you're new to him, I suggest listening to his stuff in chronological order. Start off with his first tape (http://blackieallcapswithspaces.bandcamp.com/album/b-l-a-c-k-i-e-ep-2005), and just go from there. He has all his stuff on his Bandcamp.

{"body": "Here is my advice;\n\n1. Try no-zero days. Even if you just get up, put your shoes on and walk a block. Or cooking a healthy meal. Try doing something small each day for your health and hopefully it will help it seem less daunting. \n\n1. Check out support groups if you feel you aren't getting the support you need from your relationships. /r/loseit, /r/xxfitness, /r/fitness, /r/eood are all great sources. Additionally tell your partner *everything* you mentioned here. Tell him how being this way really makes you feel, how it affects you and how you perceive that affecting the relationship (e.g. I am depressed and therefore feel withdrawn). He might not be understanding just how much this is affecting your overall well-being. If you're in the committed relationship you think you're in, then you should start seeing some support. Maybe you could have activity dates like hiking, climbing, walking, biking, swimming, etc. \n\n3. Start small exercising. Try C25K (couch to 5k), if you find the running too difficult, try alternating quick walking with slower walking. Volunteer to walk a friend's or shelter dog. Plop in a DVD, anything. Any type of movement will help motivate you. If you think a full workout is too much, tell yourself you'll do a part (1/4 1/2 whatever); you'll likely find that once you've gone so far, you'll want to finish it. \n\n4. Don't ever reward yourself with food. You are not a doggie, you do not sit/speak for biscuits. Give yourself something that refreshes you, outfits, hair, books, a day off, whatever. With that said, don't ever ostracize yourself for having a cheat day. But make sure it stays as ONE day. Some people give themselves \"cheat points\" for a month. You get a max of 5, and you earn them through hard work and healthy eating (e.g. I stuck to my calories and ran 3x this week, I get 1 point). If you think you could adhere to that type of system then by all means do it. If you think you're the type of person (which I am) that will say well it's just the ONCE after e v e r y meal, then I would forgo this option.\n\n5. Remember that this is a **lifestyle** not a diet. Diets fail, lifestyles do not. \n\n6. Channel your inner 12 year old and keep a diary/journal. Or a blog, whatever platform you're comfortable with. I find that days where I'm not feeling it, going over my highs and lows help put me back in the game. Especially the first few where I told myself I felt worthless and ugly. I'll never, ever go back to that feeling. EVER. \n\n7. In addition to Reddit support groups, check out some fitness stuff on the web. I suggest Fitocracy and/or Nerd Fitness which makes working out kind of like an RPG. Just an extra motivator. Either way you'll meet some cool supportive people. \n\nGood luck!

{"body": "**1.** In terms of the value of the runway presentation in terms of overall score, you have to understand what the angle is that season.  \nSeason 1 was a pilot. It introduced us to what drag is in a very democratic way. Edgy, glamorous, witty, bitchy.  \nSeason 2 was probably the overall \"draggiest\" season that put equal emphasis on C U N T and probably why some of the queens from that season remain the most iconic.  \nSeason 3 was HEAVILY weighted on fashion and runway presentation, allowing Raja a no-brainer win and allowing some of the most iconic performance legends like Shangela, Mimi and Alexsis to play the villains. This is also the season that Carmen got a free pass for half the competition based on look *alone*.    \nSeason 4 was the Uniqueness/Nerve season. Lots of amazingly talented queens like Milan, Kenya, Princess, LaShaun came off like \"filler\" because they didn't fit the brief of the high-camp and highly intellectual side of drag. Other legends like Phi Phi and Chad just didn't have *it* - that thing that launched Latrice, Sharon and Willam to the height of their careers.    \nSeason 5 was heavy on the performance aspect of the show which allowed for sub-par runway to go excused while the more glamorous queens played the villains.  \nSeason 6 was mostly about charisma which meant that strong runway and performance was valued less than \"star quality\". Although I wasn't terribly impressed as much as some others, Trinity is essentially a much nicer Tyra Sanchez 2.0 and yet during Tyra's season she was villified and this season everyone is saying how underappreciated Trinity was.  \nThis is also how you get a very funny, loveable queen with a basic aesthetic making the top 5 and why high-concept yet slightly insecure queens get sent packing early.  \n**2.** I think the judging teams/individuals is done pretty fair as far as I can see. It seems like it is engineered to get rid of the weakest link, despite team performance which I think seems fair-er. The only thing that's suspect is that I believe it's decided on the fly depending on who Ru wants gone that particular week.  \n**3.** I don't think that the unnecessary drama or shenanigans should be removed. As fake, or over-the-top as it is, this whole show is an audition. Like Willam said, everytime you are on stage is a time to shine. If you're surrounded by cameras all day every day, that is your opportunity to sell your brand; your character and I get that. If you get eliminated episode 1 because someone else's storyline was better than yours despite the fact that you did better than you can't be bitter. You had 1 whole episode of national TV to get people googling your name.  \n**4**: I guess I agree with you in that the trailers should only show clips from the first or second episodes, but I don't think we should stop people from speculating.  \n**Conclusion**: I don't mind any of the fake drama, the paved-paths to the final 3, suspect eliminations or anything. It's a TV show. If you go into the show thinking it's a fair contest or that you've got an equal chance to win as anyone else then you're a fool. You need to understand that *this is the beginning of the rest of your life*. You don't have to win the show to *win the show*. It's a nice cheque, but the queens who understand that are the ones who end up doing the best in the long run.  \nMy changes? I loved what they did this season. The intro/teaser was killer, they got some high-caliber queens and a lot of the guys were really hot.

{"body": "Think of it like this.\n\nThere's a master tree that has a shit ton of branches and leaves. The trunk is a list of all bitcoins ever mined along with the wallets (addresses) they were sent to. The branches are transactions, wallet A sent 50 bitcoins to wallet B. Then a new leaf is created showing that wallet B is now in possession of 50 bitcoins, that wallet A sent them, and that wallet A got them from wallets Q R S T U and V. Each time you send a bitcoin a new bit of a branch is added and as well as a new leaf. Each time bitcoins are mined the tree trunk grows a little taller. \n\nNow, when you use a bitcoin client whether it be online or not, you are assigned a wallet. Your wallet is added to the database, and should you lose it all coins inside will be lost forever, because the entire process of sending, receiving and mining is encrypted. In order to send or receive bitcoins your client needs to have the most up to date version of the tree, and cannot do anything without that data, which is around 6 gigs or soemthing like that now. \n\n\nThe economics behind the system work like anything else. Until recently, someone would offer X amount of dollars for Y amount of bitcoins. The seller decides this is a fair offer, and accepts the transaction. This is a very basic economic model, money for goods. Then, people accepted them straight up for goods, Z amount of bitcoins for a hamburger, soda, bicycle, video game, etc. That's how it became a currency, although its still heavily reliant on the dollar and euro, since a bitcoin doesn't hold its own value nor is it based on anything. On one day I may be able to spend 200 bitcoins on a car, on another it may be 204 because the trading rate changed. Unless a country adopts Bitcoins as its official currency, then that will not change. \n\n\n\nIf you think about it economics are pretty arbitrary. John decides he will buy a coke for a dollar. That's how the value is determined. Tim decides $60 per share is a fair price for imaginarycorp stock today because they've been making good profits and made good on all returns to their investors.

{"body": "I'm going to explain it like you're an adult instead:\n\nExtensions above the 7th exist in both classical and jazz, but we think of them differently. In classical, we rely upon something called figured bass, where chords take different form and function based on which inversion they are in. This is strict and formulaic. In classical music, a IV chord is very different than a IV^6/4 chord (IV in second inversion) because of voice leading. In classical, if you want a colorful chord, you would add a 7th to a triad, invert the chord in various ways, and then use tools like like appropriaturas, passing tones, and anticipations to add colorful notes on top of a bass note. \n\nThis is one of the reasons why jazz is hip. The theory comes at it from a whole other angle altogether, and voice leading is basically thrown completely out the window. It is important to point out now that in classical music, the bass note and the root note of the chord are two completely independent elements, where as jazz theory treats them as one in the same. In classical a C^6/3  (C triad in first inversion) still has a C as the theoretical root, but there will be an E in the *bass voice*. This same exact arrangement of pitches in jazz would be called an Em6  chord because in jazz the bottom note is always the root note *AND* the bass note. In other words, in classical theory, the chord would be analyzed based on the triad no matter what inversion it's in (EGC = CEG = C major chord) and in jazz *theory* the bass is always the root (EGC = EGC = Em6 chord). \n\n\nWarning bells are going off for the jazz guys out there...yes...you can still have inversions of these chords in jazz. Of course you can!  But that's in the *performance*...not in the theory or the composition. We're talking *theory* here. Analyzation. The big \"a-ha\" moment with all of this is that you can ultimately achieve the same jazzy chords using both classical figured bass and modern jazz theory. Cool!\n\nBut, basically, when you are talking 9th, 11th, 13ths, you are talking jazz. The wacky extensions didn't show up in classical theory until way later, so for all intents and purposes, we are not having a jazz discussion. Lets add some extensions.\n\n Chords are built of 3rds. If we walk up the scale using thirds, we will end up skipping every even-numbered scale degree. The notes we land on are the possible chord tones, (note that they are all odd numbers) and the extension numbers are based on these scale degrees:\n\n    1   3   5   7   9   11   13\n    C D E F G A B C D E F  G A  B C \n\nAfter the 13th, we start reusing pitches that we've already used, so 13 is as high as it goes. Stay with me.\n\n Again, chords are built of 3rds. But there are two kinds of thirds...major and minor. And as we've already seen, [it's thirds all the way up!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down). If we map out the thirds based on a C major chord extended using the C major scale (I chord in the key of C major), we get the following pattern:\n\n\n      M   m   M   m   m    M\n    1   3   5   7   9   11   13\n    C D E F G A B C D E F  G A  B C \n\nIf we decided to use the full extension, it would be a Cmaj13 chord. [Here is this concept illustrated on a piano](http://www.zebrakeys.com/lessons/advanced/chords/?id=49).\n\nNow that you're completely confused, it's time for some rote memorization! \n\nNo matter what key you're in, or what root note you're building upon, or what scale you are going to use, a major third with a minor third on top is always a major triad. A minor third with a major third on top is always minor triad:\n\n    M - m = Major triad\n\n    m - M = Minor triad\n\n\n\nNow lets add 7ths:\n\n    M - m - M = major 7 chord\n\n    M - m -m = (dominant) 7 chord\n\n    m - M - m = minor 7 chord\n\nNow lets add jazz extensions:\n\n    M - m - m - M = 9 chord (dominant 7 with an added 9)\n\n    m - M -m - M = minor 9 chord (minor 7 with an added 9)\n\n    M - m - m - M - M = #11 chord (dominant 7 with a 9 and raised 11th to avoid dissonance)\n\nAnd there you have it! Sit down at the piano and try it yourself. Build chords and you'll see.\n\nI'm gonna stop here, but I'll leave you with a few bullet points: \n\n* There will only be one of each pitch name in a chord not matter how complicated things get. You can have two C#'s in a chord when it's written on paper or performed, but *theoretically* there will only be one C# in the chord. This same concept goes for accidentals too; there will never be a C# and a Cb (or a C) in the same chord. One C and one C only, no matter what the value.\n\n* If you extend a chord out to the 9th, you have to include the extensions below as well (the 7th)...otherwise it's an \"add 9\" chord. Same with a 13th chord...the 7th, 9th, and 11th must all be in there. If a player sees C13 written on lead sheet, he'll add in the prerequisite extensions when played because they are assumed. \n\n* Borrowed note chords (6 chords, sus chords) are different than extended note chords (9ths, 13ths) in that the prerequisite extensions are not required and that the borrowed notes usually replace a basic note (in a 6 chord the 6 replaces either a 7th or a 5th, for example). Borrowed note chords are meant to be temporary chords that resolve to another chord, and that's the only reason you will ever end up with an even-numbered scale degree within a chord! They are a whole other animal. This was a discussion about extensions only, but I know that bit can be confusing. Borrowed note chords were not covered here, and that's as far as I'll go. \n\n* Extensions above the 7th that create minor seconds (two pitch names right next to each other) are generally to be avoided due to dissonance.  for example, if you go on experimenting and building up complicated chords based on thirds, you will eventually run into a situation  where you will have both a 3rd and an 11th in a chord where the note names are right next to each other. In the case of a C chord, this would put an E and an F in the same chord! that can be really bad! So, there are rules (that I won't go into here) that basically state that if you end up with neighboring notes too close to one another, you have to either raise or lower one of the other notes appropriately, (#11 chord from above) or omit the less important note when performed. Jazz performers end up instinctively doing this as they mature, so omition could almost be considered to have it's own set of rules...it's just part of the art.\n\n* Performance and theory are two separate things. Once you build your Bm7b5 chord, it can be inverted  or notes can be left out during performance for any number of reasons. Plus, your bassist will be walking all over the place, so there's no use trying to predict when the actually B root note will hit anyway!\n\nIf you are confused, you should take a formal class in jazz theory. This stuff is taught to adults at the college level for a reason...there are lots of concepts that I'm breezing over and it takes a basic foundation in classical theory in order to understand.\n\n\nHope that helps.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403016992", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 32, "controversiality": 0}

Indeed, one can be calculated/deducted from the other using the formulae listed above, as can the radius.\n\nWhen you take the derivative of a formula, and that formula relates to a measurement, the derivative will produce a formula for another measurement of the same object/thing, in fewer dimensions.\n\nFor example, given the formula for the acceleration of an object relative to time, one can derive the formula for the speed of the same object at any given time.

Although many people (apparently) do not like this compilation, I think it may be one of my favorite hip-hop albums of all time. 9.7/10\n\n[Caustic Window - s/t LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk7Q7nYJpS8): Aphex at his best, I'm surprised he didn't release this one publicly... 8.9/10\n\n[Death Grips - Exmilitary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89F5fpvwPr0): I always thought this was the weakest release by them but I gave it another go and it may be their second best LP to date. It's a lot different from their other releases, but definitely a good one. 9.2/10\n\n[Interpol - Turn on the Bright Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEL2-ExfkU0): This is slowly becoming one of my favorite albums, it's too bad their other releases aren't this good. It's a very atmospheric \"revival\" post-punk album. 9.8/10\n\n[B L A C K I E - SPRED LUV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgVlyrupu34): A great noise-hop record that may have inspired Death Grips. [The artist also got bashed on /r/cringe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/28aqeo/this_rapper_named_b_l_a_c_k_i_e_performing_in/) 8.7/10\n\n[Aphex Twin - Richard D. James Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kO6poDbsv0): His best album and shows how much creativity and imagination you truly can have in electronic music. Not my favorite IDM record but regardless a, 10/10\n\n[Boards of Canada - A Few Old Tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug0y1ZhdHT0): BoC's first (right?) LP and it is great. Although it isn't their best it's very much worth checking out. Oh, also this album feels like a giant fever dream. 9.4/10\n\n[Food for Animals - Belly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkGZUKwxdjk): A very early and good noise-hop record. A lot more harsh than most noise-hop records, but still very good. 9.1/10\n\n[World end's girlfriend - Hurtbreak Wonderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR5Xnod-7RI): My second favorite post-rock record that has elements of glitch and neoclassical. 10/10", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403033043", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

There is only grit.\n\nSometimes players make a goal. Hitting that sweet 69 tells them that its time to be a pro. And sometimes that works. Other times players notice that if they want to be the winning ball, they must *think* like the winning ball. The learning curve starts to be determined not by time spent, but by time *used.* Time used to learn just how to pull a defender right into their base spike with a last second juke. Time used to memorize just where your teammates are, and where you need to be to secure victory. And Victory? That's just another reason to keep going. To keep winning. To keep giving tips and congrats and \"gg\"s. \n\nSometimes it takes humility to give you an edge. The edge is what most players use to *decide* when they want to win. Even at 30 degrees, players have harnessed the edge to control the grid, obtaining victory in a matter of 48 seconds. It takes team communication, sometimes it takes a little macro work. Sometimes It takes ignoring that troll who wants to engage in lovely conversation over a sip of tea. Sometimes, it takes grit.\n\nSome players want the degrees to tell them they've got what it takes. Some players want the sophomoric feeling of accomplishment obtained from setting their latest flair beside their reddit username. \n\nI'm not going to lie to you, Tagpro can be hard. But why?\n\nBecause some players have the grit. And you're right, those players are usually the ones with high-numbered degrees. They're the ones with the 1:1 game to cap ratio or the 70% win percentage overall, but that doesn't mean that *that's what it takes.* It's up to you to have what it takes. It'll take time, and it'll take loss. Suffering. Depression. Denial. It happens to us all. But that's no reason to quit.\n\nGrit gets us up out of that hole. Grit tells us that we have what it takes to make the opposing team quiver in fear. It doesn't even mean you have to be the N i t r o of jukes. Grit gets us in the game. So, stick around. Witness those crazy moves and ask yourself, *how did he/she pull that off?*\n\nYou've got the dolphin flair coming up. Personally one of my favorites. See if it gives you an edge. Then notice that it doesn't, and it's pointless to try to convince yourself otherwise. You have just as much as it takes to be the best as any Some Ball does, or anyone for that matter. So use the grit.\n\n**TL;DR Degrees don't ever make you better, It's when you realize that people with high degrees (almost) always bring their best game face to the grid.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403082389", "subreddit": "TagPro", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You can find everything in the quick start rules!\nHere is the part copied from the rules:\n\nThe true power of the Vasalli lies in their exquisite array\nof special powers they are blessed with. Those powers\nare called Gifts. Although there are several theories\nabout their origins, the most widespread is that they\nare given by the god Azimoth, thus gaining their name.\nThe Gifts are divided into 4 Gift Trees;\nEach Tree deals with one of the four aspects,\nof which they assume their names and features.\nThe Gifts are various, and they represent\nthe most powerful ability of the Vasalli\narsenal, making them feared opponents.\nC o r r u p t i o n\nThe other side of the coin is Corruption. While\npeople are afraid of Vasalli for their Gifts, some\nVasalli fear them because of the toll they take.\nCorruption is the most dangerous aspect of the\nVasalli and their abilities. It indicates the level\nof taint in their body and blood. It’s a constant\nthreat and a curse in their lives, hanging over\ntheir head and casting shadows on their actions.\nWhen the Vasalli fail to harness their Gifts, the power\ncourses through their body, corroding everything\nin its path and corrupting the body and mind.\nSome Vasalli fear that high levels of Corruption\nwill influence on their minds in a very dangerous\nway. It gnaws on the rationality and darkens their\nminds, exposing them to various derangements.\nOlder Vasalli know it well - that›s why they think twice\nbefore using their Gifts. However, giving resistance to\nsuch powerful gifts is not an easy task. Many Vasalli\nhave already been encircled in Corruption’s grip,\nand their tolerance to its acidic touch has decreased.\n“Absolute power corrupts absolutely» is a motto that\ncan be applied to everyone, but it their case, it is a\nparticular menace which leads to self-destruction.\nM i n d\nB o d y\nI l l u s i o n\nR e a l i t y", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403091445", "subreddit": "rpg", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Three major reasons:\n\n1.) We use non-descriptive names for type variables because longer ones actually increase problems of matching them\n\n    head :: [a] -&gt; a\n\ntells you the element type you get back is the element type of the array. The fact that those variable names are the same is the only thing that matters.\n\n    head :: [element] -&gt; elemnet\n\nrisks the fact that I can make a typo on the name and miss it. Things that now look the same aren't.\n\n2.) Shorter names make 'chunking' a much more mechanical affair. I read `a -&gt; m b` as one thing, for instance, and spot the pattern as something like a Kleisli arrow. With `element -&gt; myMonad element'` I'd likely miss that connecton and/or accidentally drop the `'` I'm using to distinguish the first element from the second.\n\n3.) Short names let us fit the whole type signature in a space where its small enough for you to actually fit what is going on in your head.\n\n    type Lens s t a b = forall f. Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; s -&gt; f t\n\nis very dense, but keep in mind we often pass 1-2 of those into a combinator that spits out another one. So you're often talking lines of code with 12-15 variables floating around. Making each one of those 5x longer takes a signature that is 1-3 lines and it 5-15 lines. The former you can eventually chunk your way through and see how it all connects. The latter is too big for someone to fit into their head.\n\nThe rule of thumb we tend to follow in the Haskell community is that the length of a variable name is commensurate with the amount of your program it will be in scope.\n\nType variables are in scope over a very short amount of code, typically one function definition. Variables bound by lambdas, etc. also have very short lifespans. Seeing where they come from and where they flow to is far more important in the long term.\n\nNow, we do adopt certain conventions to help people out, `m` for monad `f` for functor, `a` and `b` for simple variables of kind `*`, etc. because those are the things that we've found over time matter to figuring out how a piece of reasonably polymorphic code behaves.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403097457", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

WHMs ought to use curaga II/III after each Turbine Cyclone (normal ws).  Can use barthundra just in case his second mode is trigger (it shouldnt!).  Shijin Spiral doesn't skillchain with itself so its good to bring 3 MNKs for this.\n\nShambling Naraka: Must have at least one enfeeble on him at all times.  Have the healer or support do this before anything else.  Dia 2/3, and then anything else you want.  Will shed debuffs after a certain TP move so reapply as needed.  \n\nOrthrus: No fire damage at all, I think he gains huge evasion if receives fire damage.  Have WHM barfira at least, and maybe barparalyzra.\n\nMarolith: No WSs.  If your DDs are good players they can WS during his TP moves.  If they suck, get ready for Tectonic Shift which is an AoE encumbrance.  Can actually outmaneuver this if he does ready Tectonic Shift but you're far away enough to run after the very brief readying period.  Marolith is very weak to thunder and suggested to have a BLM, GEO, or SCH to nuke A F T E R melees have capped enmity.  Have WHM barstonra, barparalyzra.\n\nMonkey/Yztarg: WS from behind, especially when he has his earth-based aura up.  Aura is procced/destroyed by WSing from behind.  If he gets Beastruction off its a likely wipe.  Have WHM use barstonra and barpetra.  WHM should be on top of Calcifying Claw which is a conal/small aoe petra, and erasing max HP down.  DDs might consider using -dt% sets for this especially if your WHM is slow. \n\nDullahan: Players with stuns ought to stun Somethingsomething-Libations tp move, an AoE that gives him an attack bonus.  If he gets that off, have someone dispel it or his other tp moves will hurt.  Has a severe-dmg single target, and a very high dmg AoE that the WHM will have to be ready to cure bomb/curaga IV.  Weak to fire, so have elemental magic nuke after melee has capped enmity.\n\nI think that's all the NMs for Torso 1.  Higher torsos will see other NMs.   On TII, there's an acuex (weak to ice, very high PDT, use formless, bring remedies/on the ball WHM for erases/-nas), a chapuli (weak to ice, uses tons of thunder-based attacks, WS when he WSs, casts when he casts, use barpara and barthundra).  There are more but I haven't done much of anything beyond torso 1.   Suggested setup: WHM 3x DD (MNK for SS &amp; formless preferable) 1x BRD or COR and 1x Elemental Magic (good BLM, /w high MAB and AF Body to -ja all the umbrils and acuex you'll encounter, preferred).

I will go over skill progression, item builds, runes and gameplay tactics/combos:\n\nRunes:\n\nI have 2 kass/ap mid rune sets: Rune page 1 (AP MID MR): Scaling HP yellows, 4 flat 5 scaling mr blues, hybrid pen reds and AP quints. I use this if their mid is ap\n\nRune page 2 (AP MID NO MR): Same as above except scaling ap blues. Use this when they have 3 or more ad and the mid is ad.\n\nItem Builds:\n\nKass has a few choices as far as builds go but I typically make the same choices each game in the end.\n\nYou finish ROA asap, dont build anything else until its done. Then get Ionian boots next, no exceptions. Once you have these its about the enemy comp, do they have an enemy ap laner with a positive KDA? I would get a neg cloak. If their ap mid laner stomped you and is fed, build that right into an abyssal. Otherwise, finish your core items off with iceborn guantlet. I cannot emphasize hwo important the IBG is. Usually once kass gets those three items, roa, cdr boots and ibg he is an unstoppable perma slowing tank.\n\nIf they have 3 or mroe AD champs AND you won lane against the enemy ap mid then build a frozen heart then get rabadon/abyssal depending on enemy comp.\n\nI highly suggest not following the tear path. Just stay away from it I have not had any success with it.\n\nEssentially the build path goes:\n\nStart: Flask + pots OR Doran ring and pots (if and only if you have a favorable matchup)\n\nFirst back: get that catalyst and dont buy any more pots the flask and catalyst will be enough and if its a DR start you prob dont need sustain.\n\nFinish RoA &gt; Ionian Boots &gt; IBG or AssScepter &gt; FH or IBG (if you got assscepter first) &gt; FH or Assscepter ( dont get the scepter if they dont have much ap though) &gt; Rabadon's &gt; Zhonya?\n\nLet me explain somethign here: once you get ROA CDR BOOTS AND IBG the game is practically over I have had very few games where I buy 2 or more items after that.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTake Q first against ranged laners and W against melee enemies (fizz).\n\nTry to use Q everytime its on CD against a laner that you trade favorably with until level 2. (trade favorably means your shield negates their trade) Make sure to cs in between Qs.\n\nFor when you took W, W whenever they are nearby, do an AA &gt; W walk away.\n\nLevel 2: ALWAYS TAKE W at level 2. Dont ever not, even against energy based champs that spam abilities. You WILL oom before level 3 if you do not get W at 2.\n\nLevel 3: Another choice, level Q again if you are still trading favorably with your enemy. E if things are even or worse.\n\nLevel 4: Another choice, if your Q is just losing you trades now because they have most of their kit, start levelling E for wave clear, peel and teamfight power.\n\nLevel 5: Level the same ability from 4.\n\nYou really need me to tell you level 6 skill choice? :P\n\nLevel 7: Max E now. No matter where Q is. Start roaming at 6 after clearing waves. R over the terrain on the map so that you do not go in the river that is typically warded.\n\nAfter level 7 Max skills accordingly now R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q.\n\nCombos:\n\nIve noticed a few niches of awesome in Kass's kit.\n\nFirst off, get into the habit of Eing FIRST then Qing. Second, wait for your lane opponent to use 1 or 2 of their spells if they dont not have just one spell to doom you (ahri charm) then R in mash keyboard and walk away: R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; AA &gt; W leave. This is the typical harrass. Make sure you dont do this with the enemy jungler waiting.\n\nSecond combo (safe combo): I use this tactic when the enemy has their spells or I otherwise need to be very respectful of their effective range: WALK UP TO THEM &gt; E &gt; Q and &gt; R AWAY from them. This is free harrass, make sure to always w minions to keep your mana up. Do this whenever E is up.\n\nThird Combo: the CC bait. Does your enemy have a non-instant form of cc? Walk up as close as you can and E &gt; Q or E &gt; Q &gt; walk closer &gt; W. Stay absolutely alert for their signature cc ability because you want to R away as soon as you see it. Doing this can effectively negate the attack because youll be too far away to be caught before it wears off. These things work on just about any non-instant cc, even Lissandra ult you just gotta be fast. Now you have a windowof their CD to re-engage them without their signature ability, because you open with E it is probably almost charged again too (You E, then Q (1 charge), you W (2), they respon with spells (3,4 maybe 5?) You R away (6 and e is up)\n\nFourth Tactic: Defensive peel, if youre being chased or see an ally being chased nearby do not be hesitant to give the enemies an E to slow them as you run away. The e is instant and no cast time. I have saved many many teammates using this tactic. Also be aware that if you are playing with a particularly skilled teammate you may be able to turn the tides of the fight entirely\n\nFifth tactic: Low health and running from an enemy without cc and you are too oom to r? Try turning quickly for a W to refill mana then R away. This is tricky and tough to master. It is difficult because you have to identify when you are losign the battle sooner so that you can afford to take a hit or two when turning to W.\n\nSixth Tactic: The bait. This one is the best. Having less than 15% health in a teamfight almost guarantees a player to try to focus you. When they do let your team peel for you and wait for them to disengage. Once they disengage you R E W Q and walk away. I have picked up so many kills like this because kass has just as much effective damage at 1 hp as he does at 100% hp\n\nLast but not least: You have to either roam to bot everytime the enemy is pushed up or clear waves and wraiths without letting any of your minions get to your turret. You would only NOT roam when you cannot be away from lane due to the enemy having good wave clear. Once mid tower is down however you should always be roaming.\n\nI hope this helped\n\nEDIT: OH and summoners. I usually take ignite for a favourable matchup or TP for an unfavourable, even or unknown matchup. Flash always. When I first started maining kass I took heal to help correct mistakes I made such as engaging when the enemy had all spells up\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403212178", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Halo: The Master Chief Collection Community Q&amp;A**\n\n--\n\n**Question: Will Halo: The Master Chief Collection be available for download on the Xbox One Marketplace?\n-RRUINER**\n\nAnswer: Yes! Access to the live action digital series Halo: Nightfall and the Halo 5: Guardians Multiplayer Beta will also be available with the digital version.\n\n**Q: What about the new H2A engine for multiplayer? Will the Anniversary maps be included in the Halo 2 rotation?\n-The Little Moa**\n\nA: Halo 2 Anniversary (with gameplay on the six reimagined Halo 2 maps) will have dedicated experiences in Matchmaking at launch. We’ll have more to share on playlist specifics later this summer.\n\n**Q: Can you clarify what's going on with control schemes?\n-The Little Moa**\n\nA: We are currently finalizing control schemes, but we can say that we’ll have universal schemes that work across all games, as well as dedicated control schemes for each game. If you loved Halo 2’s default scheme but play Bumper Jumper in Halo 3, you’ll be able to use these for each corresponding title. \n\n**Q: Will there be updates to the way menus/settings are navigated? For example, being able to change settings in a custom game lobby, etc.\n-Lady Siegecorn**\n\nA: Halo: The Master Chief Collection will utilize a single, unified \"Master Menu\" to manage campaign and custom games.\n\n\n**Q: What version of Halo 2 will be included? Is it \"pre-patch multiplayer?\"\n-WulfwoodsSins**\n\nA: We are making huge investments to deliver a premium experience at 1080p, 60 fps. Having said that, the original game had a lot of dependencies running at 30 fps so we are focusing on making sure Halo 2 plays the way it did “post-patch.” Gameplay will feel the way you remember it.\n\n**Q: How exactly does matchmaking work? Will there be a filter or something that allows me to play just Halo 2 matchmaking? And so on for the other games.\n-GNRL PATTEN**\n\nA: We’ll have more to share on Matchmaking at a later date, but we can say that we’ll have playlists that offer multiple games, as well as dedicated experiences for separate games.\n\n**Q: Will you be adding a spectator mode to The Master Chief Collection?\n-Blurrance**\n\nA: By leveraging the Xbox One platform we’re able to take advantage of Twitch functionality to provide a spectator experience that will allow online players to stream their matches, speedruns, Forge sessions and more. However, there is not a dedicated in-game specific spectator mode. While we understand the importance and versatility of a dedicated spectating system, we’re confident that Twitch functionality will make it easy for anyone to share gameplay at any time while playing The Master Chief Collection.\n\n**Q: How will armor permutations work across all games? Will everything be unlocked from the start?\n-Cpt Obvious2816**\n\nA: We’re still in development, but we’ll have more to share on customization as we get closer to launch. \n\n**Q: How's Backwash from Halo 2 running?\n-Ozzy Onya A2Z**\n\nA: More musky and damp than you even remember.\n\n**Q: How long has The Master Chief Collection been in development?\n-TeK x Fernplant**\n\nA: We started thinking about exactly how we were going to debut on Xbox One several years ago, prior to releasing Halo 4.\n\n**Q: Will Forge for The Master Chief Collection be a 'unified' experience or will there be a separate Forge application for each applicable Halo title?\n-DEEP NNN**\n\nA: We’ll be able to share more about Forge specifics in the coming months. For now, we can confirm that Halo 3, Halo 4, and the six re-mastered Halo 2 Anniversary maps will be Forgeable.\n\n**Q: Is there going to be Join-in-Progress for any of the games?\n-Death31133**\n\nA: Halo: The Master Chief Collection Matchmaking will not feature Join-in-Progress.\n\n**Q: Will Halo: The Master Chief Collection include all the multiplayer maps from Halo 1&amp;2 on the PC?\n-Lx Predator**\n\nA: Halo: The Master Chief Collection features every multiplayer map ever released in Halo 1-4; on console and PC.\n\n**Q: Will each game have their original individual title screens?\n-EmkMage**\n\nA: Halo: The Master Chief Collection has a single, unified “Master Menu” rather than individual title screens. However, we will provide unique experiences for each title that capture the spirit of each original game.\n\n**Q: Will Halo 4 have the complete Spartan Ops?\n-DIABLOxHITMAN**\n\nA: Yes, all of Halo 4’s Spartan Ops missions will be included in the game.\n\n**Q: Who is better at Halo: CE, you or Quinn?\n-Haemorrhage**\n\nA: I am much better than Quinn at Halo: CE. \n\n**Q: Will we be seeing terminals or things like them in the anniversary edition of Halo 2? \n-Theos tou Puma**\n\nA: Yes! Halo 2: Anniversary will indeed feature new terminals where players will have the opportunity to delve deeper into the universe and find key hints about future Halo games and experiences.\n\n**Q: Will there be a PC version of Halo: The Master Chief Collection at some point in the future? \n-Beats By Die**\n\nA: Our current focus is on the release of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Xbox One.\n\n**Q: How will searching for Ranked vs Social playlists work?\n-F U N Z B O B**\n\nA: Ranked and social playlists are something we’re carefully approaching and thinking about. As mentioned prior, we’ll be able to discuss ranking and philosophy in the next few months.\n\n**Q: Could The Master Chief Collection be developed on Xbox 360?\n-xXLJSpartacusXx**\n\nA: We are dedicated to bringing a full and fun experience to Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Xbox One, providing you with dedicated servers, a unified interface, increased visual fidelity, and gameplay running at 60 fps. We do not have any plans to bring the game to Xbox 360 as the game size, enhanced features and technical specifications simply can’t support it.\n\n**Q: Can we still play local co-op and campaign?\n-GravemindX2401**\n\nA: Yes, campaign co-op play will be supported across all four titles, both online and split-screen. In addition, we will be changing to a horizontal view for the split-screen multiplayer for Halo 2: Anniversary. The campaign co-op breakdown is as follows:\n\n* Halo: CE Anniversary – 2 players max, split-screen or online\n* Halo 2: Anniversary – 2 players max, split-screen or online\n* Halo 3 – 4 players max online, 2 players max split-screen\n* Halo 4 – 4 players max online, 2 players max split-screen\n\n**Q: If The Master Chief Collection is purchased digitally, will we still have access to the Halo 5 beta?\n-Bleuprint**\n\nA: Yes! Digital purchasers of the game will have access to Halo: Nightfall as well as the Halo 5: Guardians Multiplayer Beta.\n\n**Q: Will stats from the previous games (i.e., Rank, Armor, Commendations, K/D etc) carry over to the new titles?\n-BaconShelf**\n\nA: Players will be starting fresh in terms of rank, stats, armor, and more on Xbox One. We’ll have more specifics at a later date.\n\n**Q: When will we see more multiplayer gameplay for Halo 2? Also more of the re-imagined maps?\n-kkohler22**\n\nA: We’ll have lots more multiplayer before launch. Keep an eye out during Gamescom in August!\n\n**Q: Will Halo 2 Anniversary offer the old handicap system (minor, moderate, severe) for custom games?\n-Plastic Hassle**\n\nA: We’re still in development, but the goal is to include all original custom game options in each game.\n\n**Q: Can I play as an Elite? Wort wort wort!\n-random king007**\n\nA: As mentioned at the Xbox Press Briefing, playable Elites are back! Halo 2, Halo 2: Anniversary, and Halo 3 multiplayer will all feature the return of playable Elites.\n\n**Q: Will Halo 2: Anniversary have button combos, such as BXR? \n-KitKat The Fox**\n\nA: The original Halo 2 multiplayer and campaign will still have BXR and similar button combos. The 6 new maps are built upon a modified engine for Xbox One, so some of these button combos/glitches will not work as they did in the original. Rest assured, we are working very hard to match the original experience as closely as possible on this engine.\n\n**Q: Which six Halo 2 maps are being remastered?\n-CAVEMANcr**\n\nA: As you know, we revealed Ascension at E3 - stay tuned for news on the other five maps starting this summer!\n\n**Q: In the E3 game demo for H2A we saw the return of a few medals from Halo 4. Were those placeholders or will Halo 4's medals be present in H2A's multiplayer?\n-CAVEMANcr**\n\nA: The gameplay we showed on stage at E3 was a work in progress build, and as you’d expect, some of the items and assets on screen were indeed placeholder.\n\n**Q: Would you guys consider doing community events where you play with the community? \n-About1337Mouses**\n\nA: Absolutely! We’ll certainly be organizing community playdates, and most of us will be online every day this fall! Seriously. \n\n**Q: In Halo: Combat Evolved, will the option to create names only be in LAN mode, or will we be able to do the same on Xbox Live too?\n-MatQmatical**\n\nA: When playing on Xbox Live, you’ll be playing as your Xbox Live gamertag.\n\n**Q: Will you be tracking game statistics for Halo 1, 2 and 3? If so, will they be separate and viewable on Halo Waypoint?\n-Noogatuck**\n\nA: We aren’t revealing all details just yet, but yes, Halo Waypoint will support stats for all games.\n\nEdit- Formatted", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403289408", "subreddit": "Games", "score": 78, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll wait for the big analysis to come in before I place any of these unsure bets, but here's my take on it.\n\nCDEC vs iG - (Abstained) I'll bet on CDEC if they're below 10%. Abstaining from this one myself as the odds feel pretty spot-on. BO1's are unpredictable but CN dota is fairly predictable. If anything I'd give CDEC another % or two in odds.\n\nNewbee vs **LGD** - (Lost)  LGD deserves better odds than this. They don't deserve much better, though. I'd put them at 20%, so I'll toss something their way as it stands.\n\nDK vs DT - (YOLO'd on DK like a moron instead of abstaining, got lucky)  I think the current odds are spot on. DT showed how capable they are today, and in a BO1 I'd give them 25% against any T1 team. I'll either abstain or toss some junk on DT to get the YOLO out of my system.\n\nArrow vs **Invasion** - (Won)I'll probably bet against Arrow. Invasion has been doing well and I've been less and less impressed with Arrow lately - which sucks because ddz is on my fantasy team. I don't know the odds for this one, I stopped trying to guess odds for SEA dota and just go with my gut - it seems to work better.\n\nTongfu vs **Anyone** - (Abstained - didn't wake up in time. Odd's looked awful anyway and I didn't get a chance to see DT earlier)  Never liked Tongfu, and I think they're overvalued in both of these matches. I don't think they stand a chance, even in a BO1. I wouldn't follow me on these though, as I'm probably really biased.\n\n**Mineski** vs Scythe - (Cancelled?) more \"go with my gut\" predictions. Scythe matches lately feel like they're all 50/50, so I just go with the underdog.\n\nArrow vs **Invasion** - (Won. Arrow pls disband) will go with loser of earlier matchup for the value odds. If the loser seemed completely awful I'll just abstain. EDIT: Went with Invasion again. W I S P B O Y S\n\n~~**Empire**~~ vs **Fnatic** - I LOVE IT WHEN EMPIRE IS UNDER 50%. Easy bet IMO - Fnatic is on fire but they're not unbeatable. Empire should give them a run for their money and I think they're a contender to break the rat-gods. I hate bets like this, though, because I'll be cheering against my bet. I CANT HELP IT I HAVE TO BET ON FNATIC BIGDADDY IS A RAINBOW\n\n**Na'Vi** vs rox.KIS - I think this is one of the few times I've seen an undervalued Na'Vi. I feel like they should take this. I might switch this bet based on what other people say though, as I'm pretty uneasy about it right now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403310388", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Well, I won everything today. Pretty simple bets tho. The most difficult one was the last DK vs. Newbee series. It was really a cointoss, but man, I LOVE THOSE DK FANGAYS. They made the odds so good for a bet on Newbee. Much &lt;3 and [](#kappa)\n\nHere are my analyses for the matches of tomorrow:\n\n## iG vs. [LGD.CDEC] | 87/13% | Bo1 - [C O M M O N S L O S T B O Y S]\n\n* No, I don't think iG will lose. So why did I bet on LGD.CDEC? Well, because they are still a decent team (got 5 wins during the TI4CNQ) and I only went for a commons bet worth of just 8 cents or so, which will reward me with more thsn 50 cents, which could be a mythical item or even some good rares. #WorthIt.\n\n## Newbee vs. [LGD] | 88/12% | Bo3 - [C O M M O N S L O S T B O Y S]\n\n* Yes, I know LGD lost a lot to Newbee, and just recently. And yes, I also know that overall their record goes heavily in Newbee's favor (11-2 for Newbee), and that most people will think that the odds are correct because of that record. But I'm not most people.\n* As I said yesterday, Newbee is the number one team in the world imo, as well as in Gosubet's site, but LGD is also a top tier team. They passed through the qualifiers with ease for a place on TI4 and have quite a good chance to reach the top 10 imo. I don't think they can win it, because as I've been saying for quite some time already, their team is VERY predictable and they tend to do the same picks over and over again, while also not thinking about counters often. It happened more than once already; them picking Naix against a Viper already picked; drafting Viper for themselves, and without logic. Still tho, they are a team that knows about decision making and that can come up with good drafts once in a while. They already won a Bo3 with a 2-0 score against Newbee, knocking them out of ESL One. Of course a lot has changed since them, but they've been doing well enough recently (accomplished to beat VG 2-1) for me to think that they can win this series.\n* It's highly unlikely, but still, it's more than just a 12% chance for sure, as their record actually suggests. And as I always bet according to the odds, as I think bets should be done, I will be betting on LGD here, but of course, with just a small value. Since the odds are so good, even a 0.15USD item would give me 1USD in return, which is a lot in comparison. I would call this a low risk-high reward bet.\n\n## Empire vs. (Fnatic) | 48/52% | Bo3 - [E A S Y L E G E N D A R Y I T E M S B O Y S]\n\n* Of this match-up I'm not so sure. I'm always afraid of betting against Empire. They are similar to the ex-RoX.KIS guys, but with only one small but very important difference: they are good. They tend to draft the same strategies again and again; those kind of \"in your face\" type of line-ups, with a lot of initiation from Mag and pushing line-ups, but they actually play those heroes well enough to win even against line-ups that are better than theirs. Also, their line-ups don't have much counters like the RoX.KIS's ones. They tend to draft heroes like Clockwerk, DS, Doom, Bat, Lycan, Invoker, Puck, Mirana, Storm... What is the counter to that shit? Of course you could use doom on Storm, let's say, but of course they draft wisely enough to not get into a situation like that. n0tail also said that he thinks Empire is very predictable, but that they are very strong and difficult to win against, even tho you know what they are gonna do, but we've not seen them play (Fnatic vs. Empire) for quite some time already, so we can't really figure out which team is the favorite going for this match.\n* I really like both teams's play style a lot and think they are both very powerful tier 1 teams, but as Fnatic has been playing some new strategies that I also can't see good counters against so far (they only lost that second game because of some missplays by Excalibur and because they gave Na'Vi a Dire team a Lycan + Enigma line-up -&gt; Free Roshan everytime), therefore I'll probably place my items on Fnatic, but I'm only going for a medium value bet, since I think this could be a cointoss. I'll most likely bet on Fnatic because I think Alliance has better line-ups and strategies overall than both Na'Vi and Empire atm, and after doing so well at the DreamHack finals they still couldn't deal with Fnatic's line-ups, getting beaten up 3-0. These odds need to stay around 50-50 tho. If they get to 55% for a team, I'll most likely bet on the 45% one.\n\n## (Na'Vi.EU) vs. RoX.KIS | 65/35% | Bo3 - [E A S Y L E G E N D A R Y I T E M S B O Y S]\n\n**Yes, it'll most likely be Na'Vi.EU vs. the ex-RoX.KIS squad as posted on D2L, not C9 vs. RoX.KIS like Gosubet says, because I was watching the D2L stream after today's matches and they showed a bracket and the schedule which said C9 vs. TBD would be on the 22nd of June.**\n\n* I would give Na'Vi almost the same odds I gave to EG today. EG is better than Na'Vi for sure, but even tho they were experimenting new strategies and drafts, picking a Brew for mason, they still won against the ex-RoX.KIS squad with ease. As I said, RoX.KIS just does the same kind of timing strategy again and again. Once the clock reaches 30 mins in the game they usually don't have enough late game to win over the other teams. And it's not just because of their drafts, but just because of their players's skills. We could see today that even with a good late game draft they didn't have nearly as much farm as two or three of the EG players. That's just lack of experience. They always were a tier 2 team. I actually missjudged them when I thought they were a tier 1 team for some time during this competitive Dota 2 year. Their problem was not only their drafts, that were always almost the same, but also their players, as none of them is incredibly good, as it's a normal thing for tier 1 teams out there ([A]'s EGM, Bulldog and Akke; Na'Vi's Puppey, Kuroky and Funn1k; Fnatic's n0tail and H4nn1; DK's MMY, BurNing and iceiceice; and so on).\n* I think Na'Vi played enough against the ex-RoX.KIS squad in the past to know how to draft and play against them to win. I gave EG more than 70% of advantage going into that series, and I would give Na'Vi at least 65%. As odds tend to get skewed towards favorites in Dota 2 betting, especially when it comes to well known teams like Na'Vi, Alliance and so on, I'll still bet if the odds get to 70%. More than that, a value bet on the ex-RoXs could work out. Odds are still shifting, so let's see how it goes. People will probably look at Na'Vi's loss against Fnatic and don't bet too much on them. Like always, people underestimating Fnatic a lot, but Na'Vi actually played that series very well, draftwise especially, besides Dendi, who didn't do well at all on all of those matches.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403311712", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

K I S S I N G!\". I know it sounds stupid as an adult but because we were already bullied 12 year olds it was humiliating. One day one of those bullies asked me \"why don't you marry Daniel?\" and I replied \"Because he's fat, black and ugly\".\n\n**I fucking hate myself for saying that**. Like I said earlier, the rhyme was similar to something I'd heard on the TV and I was the weird kid who was always busting out with movie quotes without knowing where they came from. That rhyme was the first thing that came in to my head and I had no filter when I was 12. Also it turned out that Daniel actually did have feelings for me and I'd completely crushed him.

Some of which you could probably eliminate by further considering that All Factors Must Be Represented in the final.\n&gt;\n&gt; EDIT3: Primes from factors versus Composites from factors, T/F indicating rule 1&amp;2 pass.\n&gt;\n&gt; |p|p|p|c|c|\n&gt; |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n&gt; ||||12,16|16,12|\n&gt; |17|-|-|T/F|T/F|\n&gt; |-|17|-|T/F|T/F|\n&gt; |-|-|17|T/F|T/F|\n&gt; ||||||\n&gt; |71|-|-|T/F|T/F|\n&gt; |-|71|-|T/F|T/F|\n&gt; |-|-|71|T/F|T/F|\n\nEDIT4: That's still too many; too confusing. Let's reduce the set more by forcing rule 2 to pass.\n\nIf the prime is 71, then 1020 factors into: 1:(85,12),2:(68,15),~~(60,17)~~,3:(51,20),4:(34,30). Of which ~~(60,17)~~ has a prime and is excluded by part of rule 2.\n\nIf the prime is 17, then 4260 has only ~~(71,60)~~ and that has another prime, hence also excluded by rule 2.\n\nYou have 4 remaining choices, each with 3 options, sub two permutations; and your prime is certainly 71. It's now short enough to enumerate.\n\n|Choice|Option|Permutation|Set(ab,cd,ef)|Rule1 redux|Rule2||\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|\n|1|1|1|71,85,12|GCD=2|pass||\n|1|1|2|71,12,85|GCD=3|pass||\n|2|1|1|71,68,15|pass|pass|&lt;--your answer?|\n|2|1|2|71,15,68|?|pass||\n|3|1|1|71,51,20|?|pass||\n|3|1|2|71,20,51|?|pass||\n|4|1|1|71,34,30|?|pass||\n|4|1|2|71,30,34|?|pass||\n|1|2|1|85,71,12|?|pass||\n|1|2|2|12,71,85|?|pass||\n|2|2|1|68,71,15|?|pass||\n|2|2|2|15,71,68|?|pass||\n|3|2|1|51,71,20|?|pass||\n|3|2|2|20,71,51|?|pass||\n|4|2|1|34,71,30|?|pass||\n|4|2|2|30,71,34|?|pass||\n|1|3|1|85,12,71|?|pass||\n|1|3|2|12,85,71|?|pass||\n|2|3|1|68,15,71|?|pass||\n|2|3|2|15,68,71|?|pass||\n|3|3|1|51,20,71|?|pass||\n|3|3|2|20,51,71|?|pass||\n|4|3|1|34,30,71|?|pass||\n|4|3|2|30,34,71|?|pass||\n\nNow - to verify - you can finish out the list, and check against the Place In PI / rule 3.

{"body": "&gt;Sup redditors,\n&gt;\n&gt;My name is Marco (Known as IGN: Pwnographyz) I'm 17 years old and studying informatics in Germany (I'm also native german so excuse me for some grammatical failures). \n&gt;\n&gt;I played LoL the first time in Season 2 &amp; started playing it excessively in S3. Before I played WoW since the Beta mostly PvP, there I was among the top 50 of the realm in rated battleground and arena (also with **one hand**).\n&gt;\n&gt;So what's up with it: I lost my left Hand in 2011 (about 30mins before 2012) on new years eve due to an fireworks misfire. It had to be removed up to the wrist. \n&gt;I thougt I could never play any games again. THOUGHT. My brothers supported me in every way they were able to. First I equipped me with a new Mouse the Razer Naga which broke in like 2 months by itself with regular gameplay. So i switched to the Logitech G600 a 20 key mouse. It was very hard from beginning to play games like WoW cause I had only my thumb to click 12 keys on the left side which had to be done very fast in games like WoW.\n&gt;\n&gt;I practiced all day long, came better and better. \n&gt;Later I've found LoL which seemed to be THE game which was like created for me. With help of Keys like CTRL, ALT, SHIFT and Space I was able to bind every Key needed to play LoL properly. Those 4 Keys are the only one's Im able to make use of it properly. If I want to press Keys like W It would activate Q A S D E 2.. most of the time also. It's pretty hard to hit those small keys with the top your arm. I first thought I could do this with a prothesis, which wasn't possible cause  I had no feel in that Fingers then, I wasnt able to know so If I pressed the Key now or didnt. So I stayed with my mouse and kept practicing for a long time. \n&gt;\n&gt;I started In Bronze 2 stayed there for a while and made it up to Gold V in Season 3. In Beginning of Season 4 I directly made It to Gold V with my Promotion Series again, reached  Plat V and stucked there for a long time. Now, 1 day ago I finally made It up to Diamond and it feels just great being high ranked in the most played competetive game in the World as a disabled.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I put much effort in writing this Post, I tried to write it grammaticaly correct. I also hope It's readable and don't contains too much mistakes (: (except commas :c).\n&gt;If someone wants to know more specific about me feel free to ask (:\n&gt;I'll try to answer every reply.\n&gt;I thank **YOU** so much for reading,\n&gt;all I wanted to show with this post is that everything is possible.\n&gt;Everything.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**VeryShortTLDR:** Due to a firework misfire on new years eve (2011) I lost my left Hand and finally reached Diamond in 2 Seasons.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Little picture of my mouse and left \"Hand\":\n&gt;http://imgur.com/tmnYQ0z\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**#Had to remove stream link to follow rules.

There are 3 types of basic 7 chords. \"Triad\" means the 3 notes needed to make your chord (C major triad is C E G)\nA major 7 chord is a major triad with a major 7th.\nA dominant 7 chord is a major triad with a minor (dominant) 7th.\nA minor 7 chord is a minor triad with a minor 7th.\n\nWhen you simply say \"C 7\" you are referring to the dominant 7 chord.\n\nCM7 (C major 7) : C, E, G, B\nC7 (C dominant 7) : C, E, G, Bb\nCm7 (C minor 7): C, Eb, G, Bb\n\n\nA minor scale is a major scale with a flatted 3rd, 6th, and 7th.\nC major scale: C D E F G A B C\nC minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C\n\n\nAlso, the chord built off of the 7th interval in a major scale should be diminished, not minor. So in C major, you can use the chords: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim.\n\n\nDiminished means a minor triad with a flatted 5th, so Cdim is spelled: C, Eb, Gb.\n\n\n\nA little more advanced, but worth it to know...\n\n\nThere are three types of diminished chords, one of them a triad, and the other two 7 chords. A dimisnished triad is a minor triad with a flatted fifth. A half diminished 7 chord is a minor 7 chord with a flatted fifth. A fully diminished 7 chord is minor 7 chord with a flatted fifth AND a flatted 7.\nC diminished(Cdim)(C°): C, Eb, Gb\nC half-diminished7(Cm7b5)(Cø7): C, Eb, Gb, Bb\nC fully-diminished7(C°7): C, Eb, Gb, Bbb(B double flat)\n\n\nThe reason for that double flat is this: In a minor 7 chord, the 7 is actually already lowered because a minor 7th is one half-step lower than a major 7. So in a fully diminished chord, the 7 is than flatted again, making a double-lowered interval 7.\n\n\nC major 7 : C, E, G, B\nC minor 7: C, Eb, G, Bb\nC fully-diminished 7(C°7): C, Eb, G, Bbb\n\n\nSorry if this is a lot!

He will abstain from PUGs, and PUBs will be filled with intermittent outbursts of \"I used to be somebody!\" and \"I coulda been a contender!\" from Some Ball 7.  \n\nThis will go on for many moons, and he will go through many different names for his ball as he struggles to find his identity during this period of personal turmoil.  \n\nThen, one night in a PUB, he sees him: N i r t o.  He sobers up almost instantly, a fire now welling up within him.  He must take back his dignity.  He must have his revenge.  He presses escape and changes from his now registered name of \"BBdontHURTme\" to his new identity: R e v e n ge.  (He is also momentarily annoyed at the 12 character limit for his name, but he moves on.)  He will call out to N i r t o and say \"I must break you,\" and N i r t o will be all like, \"whatevs man.\"  \n\nThen, with three some balls at his side, the ball formerly known as N i t r o will guard the flag like he never has before.  Return after return, they pile up, his blue sphere standing in a mire of red splats next to his protected flag.  20, 30, now 40 returns.

He lures N i r t o into a nearby spike field and dances like he never has before.  A juke left, a juke right, a stutter, and then - SPLAT.  A spike has been covered in red.  He breathes a sigh of relief as he strolls in for the final cap.

{"body": "I love your style man.  Very bluesy.  Wooden box 2 definatly showed more guitar talent.  Now, one way to improve your skills is mess around with different variations of chords.  Learn some music theory (if you havent already) and youll know how to manipulate chords to your advantage.  For example, if your main progression is C E F B C, you can play around with it some.  \n1) Use of 7th chords gives some good jazzy vibes.  Instead of the the C chord being C-E-G use C-E-G-B.  It adds a little tension.  Making your progression C7 E F B C7.\n2) Inversion of chords can completely change the sound of the original, making them happier or sadder for lack of better words.  Instead of E being E-G-B, you'll flip the E to the top making it G-B-E.  Now this is still called an E chord, its just inverted (this is easir to understand if you see it written on a staff).\n3)  Octaves can also change the feel of the song.  In wooden box 2, the main chords are up around the 12th fret.  If you know the notes of the guitar, you can move that progression up to the first fret towards the end of the song to give it a darker more mellow vibe.  Its a good trick to use at the end of a song to vary things a little.\n4) Combining the ideas.  These are just a few of the things you can do with chords.  Id recommend really getting into some theory as it will help tremendously.  But youll eventually feel comfortable enough to combine tricks.  So invert a 7th chord.  C-E-G-B becomes E-G-B-C.  Invert it twice!  E-G-B-C becomes G-B-C-E.  The scary part is that these are all called C7.  Again youll see a pattern with these on a staff making them easy to identify.  \n4) Once you get comfortable with this, youll come up with some really off the wall progressions that will make your music something special.  The cliche and boring C E F B C progression becomes C7 E (inverted) F B(inverted) C7 (inverted twice in a different octave)\n\nYoure well on your way, and music theory is the next step.  many people are afraid to learn it and think it will stunt their creativity.  But knowing music theory to a musician is knowing the mixing of colors to an artist.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403631251", "subreddit": "ThisIsOurMusic", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

This has to do with the way power is generated using 3 phases.  This assumes amperage is constant across all three phases...which depends on how the power is consumed.  So 208x20x1.73=7.2KVA  You should then de-rate to 80%...5.7KVA.  \n\n\nThere is also another voltage that has marginal room in a data center, 415v.  You'll still need a transformer to go from 480v to 415v.  Traditional power in a data center is 120v for a single phase, 208v when using two legs of single phase.  If you go with a 415v system, the single phase voltage will then be 240v.  The very cool thing about this is you get 240v off of one breaker.  The unfortunate part is, you do not get any 120v or 208v.  You'll also likely run into issue with things like mainframes, large SAN systems, and such.\n\nNormally I'll run 120v/30amp, 208v/30amp, 208v/30amp/3ph, and 208v/60amp/3ph in my racks...depending on what I'm doing.\n\nKeep in mind, the power you consume...you must also cool.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403669374", "subreddit": "datacenter", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Essentially, in your situation, these \"coders\" are expecting to see similar individuals and subsequently feel a greater sense of unity when they do. You provide an unease because of your diversity and no doubt are treated differently because of this. There are a lot of variables for each individual you come into contact with, but we are just a bunch of meat sacks walking around and reacting to the random things our environment throws at us. By no means am I justifying anyone's actions and am merely saying don't let it get you down. If we could live for another 200 years we might be able to see the change to a smarter and kinder society, but we are where we are and must learn to let go of what we cannot control.

{"body": "Your playing the G major scale but forgetting to start with G, trying it again as G A B C D E F# G and you'll find it sounds very \"in line\" or more accurately \"in key\". But sense  most  of the scale is there we \"want\" to end on G. \n\nBut I think you really want to know is why does it sound good. This is because those notes are all related to the note of G. The major scale is very mathematical. You start on G, cut the frequency in half (double the wavelength or vice versa e.g. Speed of sound [a constant] = frequency x wavelength, this is actually directly related to the length of the string vibrating at the same tension,  as in when you put your finger on a fret), you get an Octave of G, cut it into 2/3, you get a D (it's fifth, hence it's importance), then 3/4. Then take the the D cut that in 2/3 and then in 3/4 and eventually you have a series of note that relate to each other through simple ratios. Our ear can actually hear these ratios (in a concept called dissonance), further more most music you hear also use these ratios so it become common for your ear to expect certain notes to follow one another. \n\nWe find that once we go beyond 12 notes that our ears have trouble determining the difference. \n\nWe also find that the first 8 created this way are the most related to each other and actually sounded good with each other. This is the Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do, (technically I think that is actually the C major scale rather than G, but we could transpose it to G). When we say octave (oct=8), fifth etc, we mean the 8th note of the major scale, the fifth note of the major scale as related to its root also called a tonic, in this case G. Further more we have CDEFGABc, which is the C major scale and we call other notes sharp or flat from the C major scale, by convention. \n\nAt one point we found that the math didn't exactly work out as in if we start on G and derive 12 notes, and we start on D and derive 12 notes, they are almost but not quite the same tones. To solve this we \"tempered\" the scale in a way that our ear couldn't hear much of a difference and we could play in all 12 major keys without retuning the instrument.

{"body": "Personally, I wish the admins would put the vote counts back.  I like them and miss them.\n\nBut there is another side of the same coin that you aren't considering--or at least didn't mention.  Humans simply don't deal well with change.  We're wired not to.  Hell, if, as animals, we weren't adverse to change, there wouldn't be humans.  So we go into a bit of primal thinking: \"When I signed up for reddit, it did x y and z.  Now it does a b c d e f g h i j k and x y.  But z is gone.  Well, if z is gone, how long until they remove x and y?!!?!?\"  That's just how our brains work.  Just yesterday someone told me they think the admins are gonna remove downvotes entirely.\n\nHowever, consider this completely accurate fact: no one ever has created a reddit account because they could see comment scores.  It's not a feature of reddit.  Vote scores?  Maybe.... maybe.  But is that why you created your account?  Was that the selling point?  The fake numbers in the sidebar?  Even being a feature of reddit, no one has ever created an account because of it--**and** that feature isn't really gone.  There's an addon right now that will do the math for you.  And I bet a future version of RES will offer it.  So we're really only left with comment votes... which, again, isn't a feature of reddit.\n\nBut now that it's gone... well, we don't feel as comfortable.  Even though it never having been there wouldn't have changed us creating an account.  If the admins made a mistake, it was not sticking with the **exact change**, nearly five years ago.

{"body": "## **ESL One DAY 02 - Semi Finals &amp; Grand Finals**\n\n**Analyses of the June 29th matches:**\n\n## [EG] vs. Na'Vi.EU | 60/40% | Bo3 - [WON]\n\n* This will just be another massacre imo. EG is on another level compared to Na'Vi atm. Even when Na'Vi was given a Lycan on Dire during their last Bo5 they got crushed, and that's a type of hero that's very difficult to feed and throw with, as we all know XBOCT likes to do, but he still accomplished to do it. And Na'Vi even tried to do their best against EG: shut down Arteezy. It just wasn't enough tho.\n* Last time Na'Vi had the advantage with the odds. This time I think people will get their shit together and give the advantage to EG, but I want less than 66-67% in EG's favor to bet on them. If the odds get higher than that, I'll bet small on Na'Vi or just abstain, as I think it'll be really difficult for EG to lose here, counting that they'll have Fear at the event to help them out after matches, especially with drafts. I don't think the odds will get higher than 66-67% tho, and that's why I'm getting excited. I'll probably bet big on EG again.\n* **Edit:** Odds are fine. Last time these were the odds I gave them, but after EG's outstanding performance I have to increase their chances. And even if I didn't, if I still thought their odds should be 60% going for this match I would still bet on them here.\n\n**Post-Match Analysis:** Again, better drafts from EG won them this series. First game they drafted an early-mid game line-up that could break their enemy's base easily and with no pressure, because both Doom and Furion are horrible defending bases. They went for the early game and won. And on the second game it was the same thing. They saw a Furion and a Chen. All they needed to do was to secure the late game, and with a Tiny + Io + Storm that was almost secured. ET was the only thing left to not let Na'Vi push their base. But really, Na'Vi couldn't do much draftwise at this point, because either ET or DS against AM is great later in the game.\n\n## [iG] vs. Alliance | 45/55% | Bo3 - [WON]\n\n* As I was thinking, people are really crazy about betting on their favorite team. Alliance obviously doesn't have the advantage going into this match-up. These teams have just met again at WPC LAN Finals for iG to win a Bo1 between the two. iG has the information they need on Alliance, and they are a team that does it's research. We could see them with their specific drafts against RoX.KIS at the Starladder 9 LAN Finals and the same happened today against Mouz. It's a team that doesn't underestimate it's opponent, being it just a tier 2 team or one of the top tier 1 ones. iG has been winning against all of the other top chinese teams as of late, while Alliance has struggled to win against C9 at the DreamHack finals this past month and against Fnatic, getting crushed, not only in score, but in each game of their series against the ex-HoN players. This is a Bo3 series and Alliance could as well be the winners of it, but it's just way less likely than 55% imo. I would give this match-up 60% odds in iG's favor, just by how much I was impressed with them recently and their ability to come up with different drafts that I didn't expect them to (even Merlini questioned today if they could play Death Prophet). Alliance already showed that Nature's Prophet is one of their best heroes, as well as the Io + Treant combination that they love so much to do. iG will have the upper hand here imo. Will bet on them with high value.\n\n**Post-Match Analysis:** Just as analyzed above, iG knew Alliance's Nature's Prophet would be a problem, as well as their Io, because of it's split push potential + global map dominance, then they banned those, picked the heroes they wanted and with early game aggression won this series. Even tho they banned the best heroes imo, Alliance's drafts were pretty strong still. For the first game I actually thought it was quite even draftwise and that it would come down to how soon iG could reach high ground, but they did it soon enough. And for the second match I really think Alliance had the better draft. I agree with Envy actually, that iG should've went for the Void offlane, but I guess they were expecting Loda's Silencer and done it right. At the end, it was just better execution and a better game plan that gave iG their win.\n\n## [Fnatic] vs. EG | 22/78% | Bo3 - [LOST]\n\n* If it's Fnatic vs. Na'Vi and Na'Vi as the favorites, for sure I'll bet on Fnatic for this match-up, because of their previous record and Fnatic's ability to just outplay Na'Vi some times. If it's Fnatic vs. EG tho, with S A D B O Y S as the favorites, It'll depend a lot on the odds. I could agree with the current odds for Fnatic just because of the team's current instability, but that would be the minimum I would agree with (35%). Lower than that and I'll bet medium on Fnatic for sure, as I do believe they could come up with different drafts and win this series. Pretty simple bet imo.\n* **Edit:** Of course I'll bet on Fnatic here. The odds are horrible and Fnatic deserves more. Medium value here, even tho I think EG will come out as the winners, as I think Fnatic does have good chances.\n\n**Post-Match Analysis:** I have to say I was impressed with Fnatic's draft and plays. They did better than what I expected against EG. And obviously, EG played their A game AGAIN. Draftwise I don't think EG was that good this time, but at least good enough to still come out as the winners. It was a pretty small loss for me. Only lost a dollar or so, but now I'm betting big on EG, so let's see how it goes.\n\n## iG vs. [EG] | 59/41% | Bo3\n\n* Really hard to either analyse or predict this one overall, because these have never played each other before, but guessing only on predictability, especially after today's drafts by EG, giving Arteezy Tiny and Razor, I'll have to go with EG, because I think they are not only less predictable than iG, but also that they have better drafts overall and players that have better skills individually. iG is pretty consistent and very disciplined tho, and that's why I'm unsure about this one. It should be a great finals series to watch. As the odds will probably be in iG's favor tho, as they crushed Alliance, it'll be even easier to bet on EG. Doesn't matter on which team I'm betting on, it'll be a medium bet. Too risky of a match-up.\n* **Edit:** The finalists are just as expected, but I really think EG deserves better odds, so I'll be going with them for sure. I think they should be the favorites actually.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403813989", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I may be Silver V but im working very hard towards understanding the phases\nof a match in lol. Through a ton of videos, research through forums I have\nbegun to understand this game a whole lot better than i ever previously\nhave. So I will try to share with you some good tips on post lane phase\nplay. \n\n1. The biggest and most important of all is obejectives. This a thousand\ntimes over. If drags up then make an opening however possible to secure it,\ntele for top will help to get down to mid and bot, mid of course is right\nthere. Pressure, getting off a good gank, pushing all the lanes are among\nsome examples in which you can apply pressure before getting into position\nfor drag. If they are going for it and your whole teams up constest it!\nWards are very neccessary in this area, if your mid and support isnt warding\nthe pit see if you can get a ward (best if pink) in that small single bush\nin the river. that would be a good spot. \n\n2. Back on the subject of objectives next in line is pressuring towers and\ntaking them down. If your struggling to find good points to ward this is it.\nlets say your top and you know the enemy team is else where, and you of\ncourse want to take this as a chance to plow some towers. Make sure you ward\nintersecting points in the enemy jungle where your wards can give the\ngreatest impact of vision. doing this will allow you to safely apply serious\npushing power in your lane of choosing, and do so knowing when the enemy is\nplanning to collapse on you. If two lanes are pushed and you're getting\ncollapsed on ping your teammates to push a seperate tower while the enemy\nteam is now focused on you. This is the core principle of map pressure and\ncontrol. you now are single handedly forcing the enemy team to react to you\nor suffer hard in objectives lost. and this allows the rest of your team to\nmake other big plays on the map. This type of control will allow you to\ncarry your team in games.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to shotcall! A lot of people play through soloq just\nbeing quite or raging or using limited pings. These things do nothing for\nyour team, they dont not help you in any form or way. If your capable,\nshotcall for your team! Ping mia's when others don't, warn for incoming\nganks, track jungle timers, ping objectives! Your teammates will quickly\ngrow to see you know what your doing and most games they will begin to\nlisten to your every direction as the game goes on. Huge deal in helping the\nteam to come together and win.\n\n4. Replays! find a day or two break in between your game time to sit and\nwatch your own games, make note of the things you could have done and\ndidn't. Chances at objectives missed, or player mechanical errors, trades\netc. Learn from them, write them down if needed, and be aware of these\nmistakes in your future games to help yourself from repeating them.\n\n5. lasty just enjoy ranked, don't stress your rank. Don't stress yourself,\njust play to have fun and improve. When you do get beat dont get mad take it\nas a chance to question your enemy team on things they did that helped them\nwin, learn from their success. Ask them if they noticed mistakes you made,\nhell you might even find a good duo parnter out of your player interactions.\n\nWell thats my 5 biggest tips. I hope you the best man, I may be silver 5 but\nthe are things i learned from my higher elo friends and extensive research, good luck man, hope this helps you move forward!

{"body": "&gt; Are you really that triggerhappy that you're willing to completely discredit Fnatic as an organization?\n\nI'm not discrediting anyone. I was simply stating Valve invites the players, not the organization.\n\n&gt; Do you seriously think 5 individual players could just up and change their organization, get new sponsors et cetera?\n\nIt depends on the contract the players signed with the organization. Teams have changed sponsors in the past, e.g. Monomaniacs and Speed Gaming.\n\nAnyway, I think you're conflating my post with the previous ones. My only intention was to make the point I first stated and that's it. Saying teams could change sponsors a million times was just to make that point that it does not matter who is sponsoring them when it comes down to playing at TI. I could have also said a group of 5 players could be unfairly dropped by a million different organizations and that would still be the case.\n\n&gt; D I G I T A L S P O R T S IS A MOTHERFUCKING BUSINESS. \n\nYes, and businesses want to make money, which means there are times when an organization may put pressure on players make decisions that may not be in the player's best interest or go against the player's own wishes. That's why Valve is careful to make sure players are being treated fairly by their organization. And that's also why invites are given specifically to the players.\n\n&gt;  That said, we believe we have a responsibility to make sure that all professional players are being treated fairly, both by their management, and by the decisions that we make that affect all of them.

Now to get the chords...\n\nMajor key chords always go: maj min min maj maj min dim\n\nAnd minor keys chords always go: min dim maj min min maj maj\n\nSo the chords for a B MAJOR key would be:\n\n    B   C#m   D#m   E   F#   G#m   A#dim", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403931279", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I grew up not knowing how to read, or how anyone else even managed it, until I was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of 19. I had gotten by undetected for so long because I have perfect verbal memory, and had basically faked my way through most of school. \nWhen we were assigned a book in English, I would get audio books from the library, and then recite them to the teacher pretending to read.\nGetting through tests were the most difficult, because they would ask you to read and write. I'd pretty much always get a flat 0, but would still pass the class overall, because we had practical and verbal tests too.\nWhen I got accepting into my university of choice (by getting friends to help me fill out the application) I failed every class. I was taken into the Deans office and they were very confused as to why I had written illegible answers on the exams. They thought I was playing an expensive joke on them or something. So I explained how I didn't understand written words. \nThey had me meet with a psychologist the following day, and that's how I found out I have dyslexia.\n\nBasically I see certain letters as numbers, and certain numbers as letters. For example the alphabet in my mind: a b c 4 3 f g h 1 j k l 8 n o 6 q r s 7 u v w x y z\nI also write my letters back to front, randomly capitalize some letters and not others, and write numbers back to front. So say the answer to a mathematics problem was 396, I would write the answer as 693.\nI also see words in the wrong places. For example, the sentence might read \"the cat is black\" What I would read is \"The is black cat.\" which makes no sense to anyone, let alone myself.\nI went through a lot of one on one teaching to come this far. Honestly, computer keyboards have been my biggest friend. \nOnce I learned how to read, I fell in love with it. I would rent stacks of books from the library and say up all night reading. I liked mostly the non-fiction section, because it was like this giant wealth of knowledge I suddenly had access to.\n\n**TLDR: had dyslexia growing up, diagnosed with it at age 19, was taught to read and write by university psychologist, loved reading and writing ever since.**\n\n**Update**: A lot of people have been saying that this story seems unbelievable. Just to clarify, I'm from New Zealand, about 80% of my grade in NCEA was from practical and verbal assessments. Only about 20% of our grade was based on written information.

The reason we don't just call it a 2 usually is because its more than an octave above the root.\n\nPlease let me know if i can expand or elaborate on any of this, i love talking theory.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403977494", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not to argue with the diamond comment /u/ambushes posted but heres my pennies:\n\nKass's play style has a lot of choices in it that you can take to be as effective as possible each game. I will go over skill progression, item builds, runes and gameplay tactics/combos:\n\nRunes:\n\nI have 2 kass/ap mid rune sets: Rune page 1 (AP MID MR): Scaling HP yellows, 4 flat 5 scaling mr blues, hybrid pen reds and AP quints. I use this if their mid is ap\n\nRune page 2 (AP MID NO MR): Same as above except scaling ap blues. Use this when they have 3 or more ad and the mid is ad.\n\nItem Builds:\n\nKass has a few choices as far as builds go but I typically make the same choices each game in the end.\n\nYou finish ROA asap, dont build anything else until its done. Then get Ionian boots next, no exceptions. Once you have these its about the enemy comp, do they have an enemy ap laner with a positive KDA? I would get a neg cloak. If their ap mid laner stomped you and is fed, build that right into an abyssal. Otherwise, finish your core items off with iceborn guantlet. I cannot emphasize hwo important the IBG is. Usually once kass gets those three items, roa, cdr boots and ibg he is an unstoppable perma slowing tank.\n\nIf they have 3 or mroe AD champs AND you won lane against the enemy ap mid then build a frozen heart then get rabadon/abyssal depending on enemy comp.\n\n**I highly suggest not following the tear path. Just stay away from it I have not had any success with it.**\n\nEssentially the build path goes:\n\nStart: Flask + pots OR Doran ring and pots (if and only if you have a favorable matchup)\n\nFirst back: get that catalyst and dont buy any more pots the flask and catalyst will be enough and if its a DR start you prob dont need sustain.\n\nFinish RoA &gt; Ionian Boots &gt; Lichbane/IBG &gt; FH or rabadons or abyssal scepter (fh if getting stomped, rabadons if stomping or even, AS if getting stomped by magic damage) &gt; FH or Assscepter or void staff (dont get the scepter if they dont have much ap though) &gt; Rabadon's &gt; Zhonya?\n\nLet me explain somethign here: once you get ROA CDR BOOTS AND IBG the game is practically over I have had very few games where I buy 2 or more items after that.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTake Q first against ranged laners and W against melee enemies (fizz).\n\nTry to use Q everytime its on CD against a laner that you trade favorably with until level 2. (trade favorably means your shield negates their trade) Make sure to cs in between Qs.\n\nFor when you took W, W whenever they are nearby, do an AA &gt; W walk away.\n\nLevel 2: ALWAYS TAKE W at level 2. Dont ever not, even against energy based champs that spam abilities. You WILL oom before level 3 if you do not get W at 2.\n\nLevel 3: Another choice, level Q again if you are still trading favorably with your enemy. E if things are even or worse.\n\nLevel 4: Another choice, if your Q is just losing you trades now because they have most of their kit, start levelling E for wave clear, peel and teamfight power.\n\nLevel 5: Level the same ability from 4.\n\nYou really need me to tell you level 6 skill choice? :P\n\nLevel 7: Max E now. No matter where Q is. Start roaming at 6 after clearing waves. R over the terrain on the map so that you do not go in the river that is typically warded.\n\nAfter level 7 Max skills accordingly now R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q.\n\nCombos:\n\nIve noticed a few niches of awesome in Kass's kit.\n\nFirst off, get into the habit of Eing FIRST then Qing. Second, wait for your lane opponent to use 1 or 2 of their spells if they dont not have just one spell to doom you (ahri charm) then R in mash keyboard and walk away: R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; AA &gt; W leave. This is the typical harrass. Make sure you dont do this with the enemy jungler waiting.\n\nSecond combo (safe combo): I use this tactic when the enemy has their spells or I otherwise need to be very respectful of their effective range: WALK UP TO THEM &gt; E &gt; Q and &gt; R AWAY from them. This is free harrass, make sure to always w minions to keep your mana up. Do this whenever E is up.\n\nThird Combo: the CC bait. Does your enemy have a non-instant form of cc? Walk up as close as you can and E &gt; Q or E &gt; Q &gt; walk closer &gt; W. Stay absolutely alert for their signature cc ability because you want to R away as soon as you see it. Doing this can effectively negate the attack because youll be too far away to be caught before it wears off. These things work on just about any non-instant cc, even Lissandra ult you just gotta be fast. Now you have a windowof their CD to re-engage them without their signature ability, because you open with E it is probably almost charged again too (You E, then Q (1 charge), you W (2), they respon with spells (3,4 maybe 5?) You R away (6 and e is up)\n\nFourth Tactic: Defensive peel, if youre being chased or see an ally being chased nearby do not be hesitant to give the enemies an E to slow them as you run away. The e is instant and no cast time. I have saved many many teammates using this tactic. Also be aware that if you are playing with a particularly skilled teammate you may be able to turn the tides of the fight entirely\n\nFifth tactic: Low health and running from an enemy without cc and you are too oom to r? Try turning quickly for a W to refill mana then R away. This is tricky and tough to master. It is difficult because you have to identify when you are losign the battle sooner so that you can afford to take a hit or two when turning to W.\n\nSixth Tactic: The bait. This one is the best. Having less than 15% health in a teamfight almost guarantees a player to try to focus you. When they do let your team peel for you and wait for them to disengage. Once they disengage you R E W Q and walk away. I have picked up so many kills like this because kass has just as much effective damage at 1 hp as he does at 100% hp\n\nLast but not least: You have to either roam to bot everytime the enemy is pushed up or clear waves and wraiths without letting any of your minions get to your turret. You would only NOT roam when you cannot be away from lane due to the enemy having good wave clear. Once mid tower is down however you should always be roaming.\n\nI hope this helped\n\nEDIT: OH and summoners. I usually take ignite for a favourable matchup or TP for an unfavourable, even or unknown matchup. Flash always. When I first started maining kass I took heal to help correct mistakes I made such as engaging when the enemy had all spells up\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403978654", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I find this is super common and honestly for me when it comes to fights it is ALL about respect. Shouting is a sign of people trying to talk over or beat someone in my opinion, and I make that very clear. I would rather have a week long rational argument than a screaming match, and for me I always start off by explaining this. When you start an open line of calm communication your SO will probably pick up on that. If he starts yelling, just say \"look, I really am tired of the yelling and I am ok with discussing things but we need to talk about it  c a l m l y\" Another thing is that open communication and arguing with someone can happen often, but it shouldn't happen all the time. Pick your battles- if he does lots of things you don't like you have to look at them and say \"can I put up with this for the rest of my life.\" if you can't, talk about it, if you can but don't want to, talk about it! This is also a time to voice your fears about breaking up and evaluate what has gone wrong as of late.

{"body": "**In Lane:**\n\nDepending on who you play (against), there are three things you want to do:\n\nOn Leona, Thresh, etc. you want to engage. See if you can engage the adc, preferably when he's lasthitting (standing still). Works noticeably better if the adc follows up (...), so be sure he's around, not low, and paying attention.\n\nOn Sona, Lulu, Zyra, you want to poke. Find out when it's safe to dish out some damage, and don't take any in return. Damage on the adc is more valuable than damage on the support, so if you and their adc both take away 30% of each other's health, odds are you did well. \n\nThirdly, if they are stronger than you, you can't outpoke them, or you are Braum/Janna, you just want to stand there and react to dives and ganks. (Braum especially pre-6) Don't stand behind your carry though, same height or a bit ahead at all times. Even if you don't threaten to engage, your sphere of influence is absolutely crucial.\n\nAnd don't be fooled; adc's don't have items yet. You do significant damage, be sure to apply it.\n\n**Ganks:**\n\nYou don't have to lasthit, you have the time to have some general map awareness. In other words: Anticipate if you are going to get ganked. Sitting in front of their turret for an extended period of time? Better take that trip to the river.\n\nKeep drake timers and tell your team a minute in advance to be there.\n\n**Wards:**\n\nLight the map up. Place a pink ward in the little mid-river brush (towards midlane, the \"death brush\"), they last forever there. As soon as you have Sightstone, sell your yellow trinket for a red one and use it. Don't forget to upgrade it, especially against Akali, Twitch, Shaco etc. (stealth) If your pink ward gets removed, buy a new one, possibly in a safer position.\n\nYou just forced their adc to back, their turret is already down, and you're too scared to push too deep? Your adc is back, their support is gone? ADC is mid, botlane totally abandoned? All these are situations where your presence in lane is not needed. Don't hang around there and try to get three minions; use that time to walk around, place wards, clear wards, gank mid, ...\n\n**Items:**\n\nWith the gold mastery, you'll want to start gold item of choice, green ward, two pots. It would be awesome not to back before 800g, Sightstone OP. (don't forget red trinket) If you return to lane without Sightstone, buy a green ward. After that, the 500g upgrade to your supp item, then boots. At that point, your very core items are done. Buy a chalice if you need mana, resistances if you need them, upgrade your boots or gold item, ...\n\n**Fights:**\n\nHard to generalize, there are two things you can do. In general, peeling for your carries is never very wrong. Just stun, slow, damage and exhaust anyone who is close to your carries, shield your carry, ... This is advisable if your carries are fed, they have dangerous assassins (Akali, Riven, Fizz, ...), your frontline can deal with their backline, or a combination of these.\n\nAn alternative is to dive and be part of the frontline. The tanky supports play here. With a tank item and a half, Leona can stand some damage, and R E W Q locks an adc up for ages. This is advisable if they don't have threatening assassins, your adc is mobile (Lucian, Vayne etc), or just generally when you get a catch with Thresh hook, Blitz hook, Leona ult etc. Note that you don't have to dive as a tank, you can often peel just as well. All those stuns and slows are equally valuable when they help your adc survive.\n\n**Recommendations for supports to start:**\n\n* **Sona**.  Sona is amazing if you manage not to die. Her Q + passive poke is amazing, she has heals, and a very strong ult. That bit of damage and that bit of heal decide so incredibly many fights.\n\n* If Sona is too fragile, try **Leona** and enjoy being a dick to their carry. Stuns for ages are so strong. **Braum** if he's free to play.\n\n* A last favourite of mine is **Lulu**. You are infinitely busy in teamfights with slow, polymorph, shield, exhaust, ult, plus the five million active items you inexorably build, but the feeling when your adc just won't fucking die because you didn't let them, and you know you won the teamfight with your plays is amazing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1403983789", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you don't understand scales yet, the major scale is a good place to start.  Scales are different from each other because of the placement of the half-steps (H) between notes.  In the major scale, starting from the root, we have a whole step (W) to the second note.  From the root, we have, W W H W W W H.  In the C major scale, the notes would be C D E F G A B C.  There are half steps between E and F and between B and C.\n\nAs for chords, C would be the one chord (I), D would be the two chord (ii), E the three (iii), and so on.\n\nIn the major scale, constructing chords from a root, third, and fifth, gives major or minor chords depending on the root.  When you see a capital roman numeral, that means that the chord is major, when lower case, it is minor.  So the I chord in our scale is a Cmaj, the ii chord is Dmin, iii - Emin, IV - Fmaj, etc.  The pattern for the major scale in chords is M m m M M m dim.  The last chord is a diminished chord and is usually denoted by vii°.  If you have a I IV V progression, that means you are playing Cmaj, Fmaj, Gmaj.  A popular jazz progression is a ii V i, Dmin, Gmaj, Cmaj.

{"body": "Hi, I recently adopted two females and I also encountered problems because they had changed 3 homes and I am not sure how they were treated. One of them bit me the other was constantly hissing. I had never seen a bunny hissing before and it is very sad to see. Well I tried to give them space, sitting down with them, feeding them daily and giving them nuggets using my hand so they smell me. I moved them from a cage to an open space but they were really really scared running all the time. I have now built them them a huge cage and they seem more relaxed. They now (after about a month) let me pet them for a few s e c o n d s which for me is like a miracle! It takes time, just follow a routine, find what they like to eat most, try to speak softly and always greet with food. We are still not very close but I am more positive now.

{"body": "You need to learn the neck. And not start you guitar learning from  \"patterns\" - that may keep you ahead for a short run but eventually you want to do it right - stop being neck-blind - and just know where the notes are. Then you will stop sounding like you are playing patterns and will start making music.    \nSo anyways... I would start with learning several shapes to play MAJOR scales. Get yourself a book like eg. \"Six Essential Fingerings for the Jazz Guitarist\" by Jimmy Bruno. Ignore \"jazz\" part of the title - it is just a basic book to teach you how to play major scales in any key anywhere in the neck. While you are working on this book - learn the structure of the major scale (semitone between 3rd and 4th step and then 7th and 8th step - otherwise whole tone). And do visualization exercises away from guitar: you know the fingering now start it on 6th fret on low E and see if you can name all the notes in the scale - write them down - see if you get proper major scale structure.  Of course you can do it with guitar but point is - that is something you can literally do all the time. After 2 weeks you will have neck memorized. \n\nThen major pentatonic will be obvious.   \nTake major scale and drop 4th and 7th step.    \nSo for C (C D E F G A B C) you get C D E G A C   \nTo get minor pentatonic take a relative minor scale and drop 2nd and 6th.   \nFor C scale relative minor is A minor (A B C D E F G A) and you get A C D E G A.   \nOr if you prefer major an minor pentatonics contain same notes but minor one starts 3 semitones down from major.   \n\nAnd btw. barre chords are good to know but imho they are not too useful unless you play a very very simple rhythm. In the context of electric guitar in a band barre chords are just too rich. So you typically play something smaller. That is just my opinion - many people here disagree. In my band we have good bass player and competent keyboard player - so when I play rhythm I typically play small 3 notes chords fragments without root or 5th, moving around, adding connecting chords, punctuating etc. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404117119", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "You are pretty much correct. If you are learning scales by patterns then yes some of the shapes will resemble the shape of barre chords and the root of the chord will align with the root of the scale shape. This is because to build a chord you actually take notes from the parent scale. So a C major chord has the notes C E G, which are the 1st 3rd and 5th notes of the C major scale. \n\nThere is a learning method called the CAGED system which relates major scale shapes to chord shapes like this. Each chord C A G E and D has a correlating major scale pattern and all 5 of them connect end to end to cover the whole neck. And they connect to/overlap with each other at the root notes. It's worth checking out.\n\nBut in general you want to eventually think of scales and chords in terms of notes instead of shapes. Everywhere on the fretboard where there's a C E G that's a C chord doesn't matter what shape. And everywhere there's a C D E G A those are the notes of C major pentatonic.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404118046", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

I started traveling alone at a very young age without flight attendants chaperoning me. \n\nCons: One day, hopefully far far far from today, when my parents are gone, I won't have any siblings to share my grief with, or any immediate family left.
