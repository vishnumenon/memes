{"body": "Yes, that is correct. A semitone is the minimum space between two notes in the tonal system. C and C sharp are a semitone apart, E and F are a semitone apart, etc. It is a single \"crack\" on the piano. A tone is two semitones. C and D are a tone apart, F sharp and G sharp are a tone apart, etc. Raising the note means placing it up a semitone. G becomes G sharp in A minor, but flats become naturals in a key such as C minor. Raising the B flat in C minor makes it a natural, not a sharp. As a general rule, raising a flat makes it natural, and raising a natural makes it sharp. \n\nWhen you raise the 7th, which in A minor involves changing the G to G sharp, you leave all other notes alone. The natural minor scale is rare because G has little polarity towards A. Raising it changes the order of tones and semitones. G sharp to A is a semitone, which heightens the polarity towards the tonic. We basically raise the 7th to make it lean towards the tonic or tonal center, which reinforces the identity of the scale. In a harmonic minor scale, the interval from F to G sharp becomes a very dissonant augmented 2nd, which should be avoided in classical music. Raising the F to F sharp redistributes the interals back into tones and semitones. Typically, musicians play harmonic while ascending and melodic while descending.\n\nT = Tone and S = Semitone\n\nNatural Minor: A B C D E F G A (TSTTSTT)\n\nHarmonic Minor: A B C D E F G#A (TSTTSXS) \n\nMelodic Minor: A B C D E F#G#A (TSTTTTS)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404226521", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Each triad in the diatonic pattern contains notes from the C major scale. Therefore, each of these triads are said to be \"in key\". As a result, you can play the C major scale over the entire progression and you will end up sounding okay because regardless of which chord in the progression you are playing over, the notes match.\n\nIf you were to play the G major scale whenever it switches to the G chord, it would sound okay, but would sound \"different\" if you stayed in G and played over the other chords in the scale. The G major scale is dominant over the C major scale because in the key of C major, G is the fifth degree. If you look on the fretboard, you'll notice that each interval in the G major scale is a perfect fifth above the same interval in the C major scale.\n\nYou can use any scale that uses the same tones as the C major scale to solo over a C major chord progression. These include the C major scale and the A minor scale along with other scales.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404232467", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

Specifically, in that little bit from 2:51-2:55, she is improvising over the chords: Dm7(9) | Gm7(9) | A7\n\nThe melody focuses around E F G A up to C for the Dm7 bar, then she sings around around the notes F G A Bb for the Gm7(9) bar, and hits a C# at the start of the A7 bar\n\nThis is in line with the implied chord progression\n\nDm7(9): D F A C E (she outlines these notes with her melody, she lands the F at the beginning of the chord, and she ends up on C at the end of her phrase)\n\nGm7 (9): G Bb D F A (same as previous chord, you hear her hit the Bb for the first time in her melody, and the transition note into the next chord lands on the A, which is also the root of the next chord)\n\nA7: A C# E G (she lands on the C# here which causes that \"tension\" at the end of the phrase)\n\nI can't do this for the entire improv but suffice to say she continues this improvisational style based on the underlying harmony. The \"jazzy\" sound is due to her stressing the 9, 11, and 13 extensions of each chord. There is \"basic\" harmony for the song, and certain notes sung along with the basic harmony can create a \"floating\" feeling which is what's going on here\n\njazz heads I know I am oversimplifying this but just trying to help out", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404241038", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You'll need to go ret or holy unless you can find a rated battleground team willing to take a prot paladin. Neither ret or holy are top tier, but they are viable.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll have to say that improving as a player is mostly about having a positive mind set, and so far it seems like you have that nailed. \n\nTo be effective in pvp, you'll want to start keybinding your spells to keys like 1 2 3 4 5 6 f r t g b v c z ect instead of clicking them with your mouse, and using wasd for movement. This really makes a massive difference, especially as melee since if you learn to move well with your mouse pivoting around targets really helps. \n\nFor now, I just recommend trying to start of really simple, taking your time to level to 90 while learning to keybind.

{"body": "I don't think it will jump out at me and be 119 nPr 10, because order within teams doesn't matter and team swapping (which team A and B are swapped to make another permutation) doesn't result in much of a different game. \n\nThere will be overlap if we do this simple solution, an example is if you were to have team 1 pick champions a b c d e and team two pick f d g h i that would be the same game as team one selecting b a c d e and team two selecting f d g h i. \n\nI think if we take this problem into a simpler proportion we can make it easier. \n\nLets look at the digits in base ten, and how many groups with 6 digits can I make where it is separated into two subgroups A, and B, each with 3 digits in them. Any permutation of numbers selected from group A will be the same and any permutation of numbers in group B will be the same, and any swapping of groups (where group 1's A and B are group 2's B and A respectively) is also the same. \n\nSo we first choose the numbers that we are working with, 10 nCr 6. Then, we will choose group A, which has 3 selections and 6 things to select from, this will be 6 nCr 3, because 123 = 321 = 213 etc in our case. Then, selecting group B will be completely dependent upon group A, since the only things we will have left over are the other 3 that A didn't choose, which are only 3 items so there is no change in B after we choose A. Now we have to divide by two to account for the fact that this still allows you to choose 123,456 and 456,123, or the team swap issue. \n\nSo we have (10 nCr 6)(6 nCr 3)/2 or 2100, which is quite different from (10 nPr 6) or 151200. \n\nSo with my method we choose 6 digits and rearrange them in two distinct combinations of 3, this closely resembles the champion selection.\n\nSo, applying this method, we should have (119 nCr 10)(10 nCr 5)/2 or 13405874632778628 (13.406 quadrillion) instead of the large (119 nPr 10) or 386089189424024486400 (386.089 quintillion).\n\nEDIT: Math error :)\n\nThis sounds much more reasonable to me lol.\n\nDon't take it for face value, I study math and stats is my thing (this isn't stats, this is more counting, but you cover probability in stats and counting is in probability), but it feels right.\n\nCounting problems are difficult, so ask your local discrete mathematician to help!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404261452", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Armor shoes are also a good choice against a FULL ad team. \n\n\nMysteries: 9/0/21 or 21/9/0: 9/0/21 is the most common rout and it has some really nice things for ryze including movement speed, higher max mana, mana regen and biscuits to help with laning. \n\n\n\n21/9/0 is what I run however and it is quite strong in that it has a little less damage early but a lot more damage later. It just doesn't give you mana regen, move speed or summoner spell cdr.  I feel the percent pen and % multipliers make it worth it. Another  thing it does is give you dangerous game, spell sword and % ap increase. While ryze isn't an ap character per say he can get up to as high as 2.2 ap ratio with 3 q's (which should happen) and 2 or 3 E bounces. \n\n\n\nRunes: Quints: Move speed, Magic pen, or flat mana. (move speed are recomened by most high level players but I find that I am ether away cleanly or they don't matter cuz I am dead anyway.  Mpen for the win) \n\nReds: mpen, stype points for putting a 1% crit red for that, lol I crit for 80 rather then 40 damage(I don't its a preference thing) \n\n\nyellows/blues: health, health per level, armor, mr and mr/level. \n\n\nCombos: as Mr slykku said the best burst combo is Q-E-R-Q-W-Q with the R going off with the E/Q in mid air. High burst, If you are ahead in gold or just late game vs no defensive items this can one hit a carry. \n\n\nOther  combos include  Q-W-R-Q-E-Q for when you want to snare someone before they can run away.  Q E W Q for when you don't have/want to use ult. And Q E Q R Q W Q or something like that which is your sustained dps combo. You make best use of your passive with it and if you have Spellvamp it is a good one to use against scary bruisers who you know you can't burst down. \n\n\nEnding notes: Spellvamp is really good, ryze is all about positioning/dodging. The expose weakness mastery is bugged and will apply to you if you use it so get it for a free 1% increase. Ryze really needs an initiator or he will eat a lot of damage for doing it himself. Cait/Trist/Maybe kog/vayne are the only champs that can really beat a ryze since they have range and thus they will kit you all to hell. Other champs can just wreck a ryze late game like say jax or fiora but you are tanky, do a lot of damage and are not the champ they should want to kill since you still have a ADC and possibly a mid champ for them to contend with.

They aren't going to understand why you won't go to their bachelor parties unless you're honest with them. You're dead-broke, and you need to lay low for a couple months to get your finances in order.\n\n\nD. Now that the social pressure to be 'doing things' for a couple months is off your back, and you have a built in excuse for anything that costs money, you can dig yourself out of this hole you're in.\n\nE. **MAKE A BLOODY BUDGET**. You really don't have an idea what you spend. It's clear because you listed about $2,700 in expenses and you make $3,800 after taxes. You should be netting $1,100. The money is going somewhere.\n\nF. **URGENCY** You've got some urgent issues. Get caught up on your rent. That's priority number *f'ing* one right now. Go buy a 5lb bag of rice, a 5lb bag of beans, some frozen veggies, and maybe some cheap ground meat of some kind.

If you truly stick with that plan, within 2 months, you should be caught up on rent, and have a checking account that's in the black. \n\nI. DON'T STOP BEING CHEAP. You can realistically get those credit cards paid off by the end of the year, if not the beginning of next year. You'll then have $400 extra dollars a month. $400!\n\n\nBasically you need to completely change your lifestyle. You're spending money like someone who makes 75-80k/yr spends money. And that assumes that the person making 75-80 doesn't save a dime. \n\nUntil you make 100k/yr, THIS IS NOT YOUR LIFESTYLE.\n\nLastly. LA is f'ing expensive man.

{"body": "/u/captainspaz has covered most of it.\n\nBasically a couple of comments really...\n\n\n**Drones:**\nDrones are just that. They are there to provide pleasant background noise in harmony with the chanter. Tuning your drones is usually done once and then just tweaked if necessary during a session. You don't really retune drones while you're playing (it's possible, but not really practical - plus it'd only really be for tweaks if you do).\n\nIt would take some time and probably changing out reeds for the piper to retune the drones from D to a different note (assuming that he drones themselves are capable) - again, not really practical if you want to switch in the middle of something. \n\n\n**Range:**\n\nYou mentioned a three octave range - the pipes only have a two octave range:\n(D E F G A B c d e f g a b c' d') and the top c and d can be quite unstable/unpredictable depending on the quality of the pipes and the piper.\nThe \"typical\" full-keyed chanter will usually have extra keys to play Fnat, G#, Cnat (2nd octave) and Bb.\n\nYou also mentioned the Eb. In piping terms, this is what's called \"ghost D\" it isn't a true Eb - it's just written that way in music sometimes. It has a great and unique sound, but if you want a clear loud Eb, then that probably won't meet your needs.\n\n\n**Chords:**\n\nChords are played on the regulators. Think of regulators as a cross between a chanter and a drone that sticks out of the drone stock. Regs are fitted with keys and when played together form chords with the chanter (or without!). \n\nAs you would've seen in captainspaz's link, regs do have a very limited range.\n\n\n**Stuff for inspiration:**\n\nI hope this doesn't put you off, though - I've heard pipes played with orchestras and they sound amazing.\n\nPlease check out these links:\n\n[Lúnasa &amp; The RTÉ Concert Orchestra live at the National Concert Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW4AYJdOn10)\n\n[THE BRENDAN VOYAGE 10th MOVEMENT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z-3OKzUEDw)\n\nI hope I could help!

{"body": "Hoo boy. This is a big big topic, and there often aren't objective answers. First, just so you know for future googling, the term for what you're talking about is \"fingering\". Also, for ease of talking about it, there's a numbering system. Your fingers are 1-5, 1 is the thumb, and 5 is the pinky.\n\nAs for how to choose your fingering, there are certain guidelines, but really it's an instinct that every pianist has to develop for themselves. Above all else, you should listen to your body, and try to do whatever puts the least tension on your hand and requires the least effort to do. For example, I bet you'll find it more comfortable to use 1 3 5 (thumb middle pinky) on F A C rather than 2 3 5, which is what you were using.\n\nTry a bigger chord, like A C F A with your left hand. Is it easier to play it 5 3 2 1 or 5 4 2 1? Everyone's hands are different to a certain extent, but I'd bet money that 5 4 2 1 will feel easier.

{"body": "If you went in to this movie with any expectations, you're going to have a bad time. That being said, it's probably the best Transformers film since the first one back in 2007. Actually I would say it's better, but the first one was fairly exciting/good as a film to introduce the Micheal Bay transformers universe/characters.\n\nIs the plot &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; R I D I C U L O U S &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;? Yes. Are there GAPING plot holes / IDIOTIC developments (secret jet boots = new LOTR eagles ? ) Yes. \n\nHowever, if you just sit back, and watch the movie, taking it all in, it is quite the adrenaline rush. The pacing and level of effects seemingly accelerate from start to finish with no pause in between. First there is family drama, then there is minor skirmishes of robots v humans, then there is robots v. spaceship AND THEN there is robots vs army of robots AND THEN there is robots vs army of robots AND robots vs spaceship AND THEN there is robots vs army of robots AND robots vs spaceship WHILE riding OTHER dinosaur robots. Finally, to conclude, the robots vs army of robots AND robots vs spaceship WHILE riding dinosaur robots take their fight full fuckin' 3D and climb up and down the Hong Kong cityscape while fighting each other. Then the movie ends (phewf...).\n\nSome high points:\n\n- Lockdown was awesome, character development a little dry, but his transformations/combat was awesome (other than marky mark fucking blocking his swings at the end with zero effort that was retarded). Also him just driving around in car mode usually had some good cinematography. \n- Optimus Prime's new robot model was awesome. Really good looking actually, it's less blocky and awkward than before. \n- SOME of the jokes. Some of them were good. You gotta give it up for the Asian grandmas, it was good comedy.\n- The daughter was nowhere near as bad as Megan Fox in terms of ass shots / cheesy dialogue. She \"took part in the events in a reasonable manner\", and you gotta give Micheal Bay that : he's improving here for sure. The \" 'strayan rally car driver outta fuckin' nowhere\" I guess was necessary as an escape mechanism and a foil for the \"overbearing dad\" trope.\n- The human cast overall was much more competent/entertaining. Kelsey Grammar scenes are usually always well done. \n- The 3D was subtle and not overdone and just kind of made certain characters/effects pop off the screen in a good way, I enjoyed it.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed myself, even with the ~2h40m runtime. I think it's only worth it to see it in large screen 3D / Dolby Atmos theatres as a spectacle unto itself, because it's not the greatest \"movie\", per se.

For example, when doing pushups, I will purposely go as slow as possible during the \"up\" motion. With walking lunges, I'll hold the lunge as long as I can. I believe it has given me much faster results (with the added benefit of really focusing on correct form) than I would have had, otherwise. Proper form is very important. I respect people who do Crossfit (successfully) but it's not for me, because I just kind of view it as an \"injury waiting to happen\" type situation. Weight bearing exercises (bodyweight or otherwise) are *not meant to be cardio*, in my own personal opinion.

{"body": "I main Elise (s3 scrub) and there are three ways to build her- the LCS or 40% cdr build, which is golem locket and ionian boots (and then situational items such as guise, or randuins/veil). Maxing Q then E, this revolves around having, with 40% cdr, a low cd 2 second cocoon. I've found this hard to carry with in yoloqueue as you rely too much on teammates to provide damage while you lock them down. Probably best when you have a champ on your team like a fed vayne, for instance, who you can be a meatshield for. \n\nThe second is the AP bruiser build, which was the norm before Elise's changes a few patches ago, nerfing Q base damage and objective control, while buffing Cocoon cd and making the stun duration scaling. The build is Golem sorc boots rylai liandrys into tank items, which makes you a threat while tanky enough to dive, with some utility from Rylais. The amount of tank items you build really depends on how manmode you play Elise, as she is quite squishy without items. Eg Nightblue (famous streamer) used to go sorcs into straight tank, because he felt sorcs gave him enough damage and he wanted tankiness in the midgame.\n\nRecently I've switched to the ap assassin build and it's a lot more fun. She doesn't have bad AP scalings unlike what some may say, although her midgame isn't that strong as that's when your Q base damage falls off and the % portion doesn't have enough AP to be strong. Build is wraith sorcs dfg dcap zhonyas void. Hilariously fun. In teamfights try and poke with human W, and when a fight starts cocoon someone isolated and use your full combo, which is (assuming human form) E DFG Q W R Q which is ridiculous burst. You can't really initiate a fight on your own, but stay with your AD and wreck divers. \n\nAs far as playstyle goes, I tend to gank a lot early as why farm when you can snowball off kills?\n\nAlso to address the conception that Elise falls off lategame- it's only due to her lack of AOE abilities besides a long cd unreliable W which makes her have less presence in teamfights.\n\nAs far as ganking goes, I feel cocoon works better as a followup than an initiator unless you're a god at landing them. Save rappel for dives, or if need be you can rappel onto an enemy, switch to human and then use cocoon Q W, although this does make you vulnerable and outputting no damage until your ult cools down.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404489086", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "David Baker's guide to jazz ear training [x-post from /r/jazz]\n\nHi all! For the performers among us, this is something you may find useful. David Baker is a major jazz educator/composer/etc, and he wrote a fantastic book called *Jazz Improvisation: A Comprehensive Method for All Musicians*. One chapter of the book is titled \"Developing the Ear\", and is a sequence of ear training exercises for jazz musicians. It's a pretty rigorous fundamental training, but if you really work through and master all of it (not saying I have yet!), then your ear's going to be pretty darn good. I highly recommend the whole book, but this is short enough that I figured I would share it here for people who might find it helpful. Some of them require a second person, and some simply recommend one but could be worked around without one. Enjoy!\n\n***\n\n1. The player should practice singing and recognizing intervals. He should have someone play intervals for him while he names them. He should name intervals and sing them. The player should play a note on his instrument, then name any other note and sing it.\n\n2. He should extend the interval practice by playing a note, then arbitrarily naming eight or ten other intervals — each interval measured from the last interval. Example: play C, say Major 3rd, sing E, say tritone, sing Bb, say Major 3rd, sing D, etc. At the end of a given period of time he should play a note on his instrument to check for accuracy.\n\n3. Next the player should practice singing triads of any quality starting on a common tone. (For example, sing Ab. Then, using that as a root, sing major, minor, augmented, and diminished triads.)\n\n4. Next he should do the sme exercise using the different quality seventh chords. (For example, sing Ab as the root. Then sing major seventh, minor seventh, dominant seventh, and half-diminished seventh chords.)\n\n5. He should now use ninths, elevenths, thirteenths, etc.\n\n6. Next the player should do the triads, sevenths, ninths, elevenths, etc., altering various tones in the chords, e.g., Cmaj9 with a raised 5th, Bbmi7(b9), C13(+11), etc.\n\n7. Using a single note as the axis the player should sing chords in their inversions. Example: Sing Ab, then sing the rest of an E major triad. Now the Ab is the 5th of a Db major triad. Ab is now the 7th of a Bb7 chord. Now Ab is the 9th of a Gb major chord, etc.\n\n8. Next the player should practice all chords and triads in all inversions, ascending and descending. [Note: he includes 9ths and above. For example, for Cmaj9 he writes C E G B D, D E G B C, E G B C D, G B C D E, etc]\n\n9. Next he should practice recognizing the material in exercises three through ten when somebody else plays them; also name the inversion, etc.\n\n10. He must be able to sing scales of any quality (i.e. major, diminished, whole tone, etc.)\n\n11. The player should sing any quality scale starting on any degree of the scale. For example, sing a major scale starting on the second degree or the sixth degree, etc.\n\n12. He should sing the diatonic triads, seventh chords, ninth chords, etc. on the various scales, ascending and descending. Example: the seventh chords of C melodic minor, ascending, are C Eb G B, D F A C, Eb G B D, F A C Eb, etc.\n\n13. He should sing the diatonic triads, seventh chords, ninth chords, etc. starting from any degree on the scale. Example: the seventh chords of C melodic minor, ascending, starting on the 3rd degree, are Eb G B D, F A C Eb, G B D F, A C Eb G, etc.\n\n14. He must be able to recognize any of the material in exercises eleven through fourteen when played by another person.\n\n15. He should sing the diatonic seventh chords built on any scale degree. He should sing all inversions before moving on to the next step. Example: C melodic minor would be C Eb G B, Eb G B C, G B C Eb, B C Eb G, D F A C, F A C D, A C D F, C D F A, etc.\n\n16. I recommend that the player devise other similar exercises.\n\n17. The player should take a bass line off a record, perhaps a blues or other relatively simple tune.\n\n18. The player should move on to more complex bass lines, then to solo lines.\n\n19. Once the player is far enough along to deal with solo lines, I recommend that he dispense with writing the solos down. Instead, he should play and memorize the solos directly from the record. At all times, he should draw on his complete fund of knowledge, using reason and logic to help the hear. For example, if he just recognized a D minor seventh chord he should be suspicious that the next chord might be a G7. he should also suspect a II V7 progression before the final chord of the piece, etc.\n\n20. If possible he should now enlist the aid of another player and play follow the leader. At first he should avoid playing on an actual set of chord changes. He should just play at random and imitate the leader. He should start with brief closely related phrases and proceed to longer, more complex phrases.\n\n21. When the player feels comfortable with number 20, then he should practice his listening technique on a relatively static type of tune: blues, So What, Maiden Voyage, etc. Phrases should be chosen that enable the second player to complete the phrase at the same pitch level as the first player. The first and second players should exchange roles frequently.\n\n22. Next the players should proceed to the question and answer type playing where the answer is duplicated but at a different pitch level.\n\nTwenty-two should also proceed from the simple to the complex. As a daily exercise the player might take for our five different tunes in random keys and play through them very slowly without stopping to correct mistakes. He should strive to hear the interval and/or the position of the note in the scale before he plays it. This also applies to hearing any familiar patterns or chord outlines that live within the tune. This pre-hearing has to take place without distorting the tempo. As the player gains confidence he should strive to play each tune at the correct tempo. The player should make sure the keys he chooses for the various tunes are diverse so as to develop equal facility in all keys. If the player has access to a tape recorder, he should record the tunes and play them, making notes of the intervals or chords most frequently missed. He should then strive to improve his hearing and recognition of these intervals or chords.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/29liyr/david_bakers_guide_to_jazz_ear_training_xpost/\n\nEar training guide for jazz musicians.

{"body": "Sorry for the late reply! I've expanded on all of those topics in the original thread... I'd copy &amp; paste now, but it's the 4th of July, so we're doing the family thing :) But... Height is 5'4, weight fluctuates between 139-129 (now), starting weight was 189. \n\n\nOk, sorry! Here's some info...\n\nThank you! The \"before\" pic is before I even had baby #2... That's a crib in the background in the \"after\" pic, where baby #2 was about 2 1/2 years old. It took me about a year. ( That's the best \"before\" pic I have... Wasn't too fond of cameras at the time! Ya know...) My routine... I sprint, I do Pilates (completely bodyweight dependent, I'm kinda upset that there's *actually not* a subreddit for that!) But check out Cassey Ho's \"Pop Pilates\" for free (!!!) on YouTube. (I swear she doesn't pay me, I bought a sweatshirt from her website, just because all her workouts are available for free... It says \"train insane, or remain the same!\" ) ALL the squats! ALL the lunges!!! Pull ups &amp; push ups. Handstands. I mix it up a lot. \n\n My diet is very high fiber. I like spicy food, so I eat what tastes good to me. A lot of brown rice, chicken, cauliflower &amp; broccoli... And chickpeas. Also, healthy fats like avocado, pecans, almonds, etc. Honestly, if it doesn't taste good, I won't eat it. Spices are magic! Whole grain everything, when it comes to carbs. As long as you avoid an excess of sugar (no! No soda!!!), and keep a calorie/macronutrient sufficient diet, you're good to go! \n\nEdit; I like Fiber One cereals, I do drink milk (skim), I have a love/hate relationship with cheese! I use sharp cheese because I find that I can use less and get more flavor. I am, sometimes, a lazy bish... I'll eat Morningstar stuff on those days. Not because I'm vegetarian, but because it's the healthiest alternative I have at the time. Beans are *awesome*! Cheap protien, and high fiber! I usually restrict my beef intake to... Um, that time of the month when I need the iron. I eat a lot of salad ( gotta be careful when choosing dressings!) with spinach. When I feel the need to mindlessly snack, I go for carrots or broccoli. Sometimes, pistachios, because... Damn they taste good &amp; are the lowest calorie nut. :) just wanted to expand on that a bit more. \n\n\nEdit: And some more info regarding my \"routine\"\n\nI try to exercise everyday. Sometimes, I can't, but that's ok, you have to rest as well! TONS of walking lunges. Jump squats. Handstands, jumping rope, trail running, planks, side planks... I mix it up a lot, so that I don't get bored! I think that's the most important thing, to *just keep moving*. If I did the same exercises all the time, I'd probably be sick of them. I want to get into rock climbing, there's a whole world of stuff to do!\n\nEdit: something else that I do, that *I* have found to be particularly helpful is, when doing any kind of weight-bearing exercise, I go *s l o w l y* during the \"fighting gravity\" phase of the exercise. For example, when doing pushups, I will purposely go as slow as possible during the \"up\" motion. With walking lunges, I'll hold the lunge as long as I can. I believe it has given me much faster results (with the added benefit of really focusing on correct form) than I would have had, otherwise. Proper form is very important. I respect people who do Crossfit (successfully) but it's not for me, because I just kind of view it as an \"injury waiting to happen\" type situation. Weight bearing exercises (bodyweight or otherwise) are *not meant to be cardio*, in my own personal opinion. Especially for people with certain pre-existing physical conditions or people new to exercise.

{"body": "The musical alphabet doesn't REALLY start or end, it loops. Musicians have what we call key signatures, which is kind of like a short hand. For example, in the key of Bb Major (B flat), everytime a musician reads a B or an E, they know to automatically lower it to a Bb or an Eb respectivally. In the key of G major, the F is always an F#. C major is the key with no sharps or flats. Now back to your original question. Bb major and g minor are very similar keys. They share a key signature. The only difference is, the scales start on different notes, but Bs and Es are still flatted. They are \"modes\" of the same key. Their are 7 modes, one for each of the 7 pitches of the scale. What we say the \"Key of C\", we really mean the \"Key of C MAJOR\". The ionian mode (now called the major scale) was not the predominant scale when the music alphabet was created, but the aeolian mode (now called the minor scale) was. A minor is the same key as C Major, and the note that the musical alphabet is based on.

{"body": "In terms of hip-hop acts that sound like Death Grips, Clipping and B L A C K I E are the two that I constantly see mentioned.\n\nFor non hip-hop acts that are similar to DG, the first that comes to mind is Genghis Tron; glitchy, loud, intense.  The first song off their first release is a good place to start; [Genghis Tron - Rock Candy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIxOVBgMP0Y)\n\nSome people may hate this next comparison, but when I first heard Government Plates the more instrumentally-driven tracks (aka 3/4 of the album) often reminded me of Crystal Castles.  And CC definitely share the secrecy aspect with DG - very rarely doing interviews, not letting much be known about their personal lives and so on.  Other similarities include music videos that are often lo-fi, glitchy and weird, occasionally very abrasive music, vocals that are often unintelligible (though typically due to effects rather than being shouted) and some beats that sound similar to DG.  Oh, and both bands have a song called \"Birds.\"  Some tracks to check out; [Baptism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vStjmYxetY0), [Fainting Spells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpkrB3VwZxk), [Sad Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjAdfDrh8v0), [Mercenary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IffPAJC9G9Q).\n\nLastly, back to hip-hop again, Danny Brown sounds nothing like Death Grips but he's unconventional, highly unique, has an interesting (and often grim) background and doesn't shy away from dark and personal lyrical content.  I listened to his music a lot right before or after listening to DG and found that their music complimented each other very well, though your mileage may vary.  If you haven't heard him before [check out the track \"30\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J--rO7FP16U) - he switches back and forth between voices on this track so it's a good introduction to both of his vocal styles and the climax of the song starting around 2:08 is ridiculously good.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404540293", "subreddit": "deathgrips", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

I've also added instructions for installing more mods in the future. \n\nBut wait! That's not all! I added TUMTaRA Revamped, the best map for testing mods. (To access it go to single player and go to custom campaign, select this map and you should be good to go. DISCLAIMER. While some models in the map may appear broken I've thoroughly gone through all of them and tested them myself, they work fine.) The contents of the mod pack are listed down below with links.

{"body": "The example OP gives from Parsifal is:\n\nD A E Cb Gb Db Ab\n\nThe D A and E chords actually function as: E double flat, B double flat, and F flat chords, but are written that way for easier reading. If you wanted to analyze this in Roman Numeral form it would be:\n\nbV bII bVI bIII bVII IV I\n\nHowever, I think that's more complicated than it really needs to be. Essentially, all you need to know is that the chords in the cadence are moving down a 4th each time; its just movement along the Circle of 5ths with passing tones between each chord. Transposed to the key of C, it would look like this:\n\nGb Db Ab Eb Bb F C\n\nOr if you're more comfortable with a guitar than a keyboard, in E it would be:\n\nBb F C G D A E ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404623419", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Cool. I'm studying Materials Engineering. I've just always been interested in religion and philosophy as well. I also think even though we aren't professionals in this field, we can both definitely learn a lot from. I have no intention of scoring debate points or playing gotcha in our arguments. I am just looking for a better understanding of your moral outlook so we can have a more honest and efficient discussion.\n\nFor the moral framework, are you referring to the alien and a b c d e groups? I didn't think that was referring to a moral system. I would really appreciate it if you could summarize how you approach moral problems or what assumptions/methods you use to solve them. I'll do the same below.\n\nI am a Moral Absolutist. That means that I do not think that the morality of an action is dependent upon the perspective of the person doing or witnessing the action, nor do I think intentions can change the morality of the act. Note, I do think intentions can play a factor in what action actually takes place (i.e. Accidental Death vs. Murder). But no matter how good the intentions of the person doing the action, it will not change a bad act into a good act. \n\nNow, I assume you'd also like to know what I base my morality on. There are two types of Law, both of which I believe come from God. The first is the divine law. This covers direct revelation from God, which includes holy writings (i.e. the Bible), and Sacred Tradition. I am Catholic, so I believe that the Church is guarded by God from error when teaching about doctrine and morals. The second is the natural law. This law was written on our heats by God so that we could figure out what acts were moral and immoral. A not-so-religious term for this natural law is conscious. With both the divine and natural law, I believe we can determine the morality of actions. \n\nI know this description is general, but I'm just trying to get all the basic points down first. Please let me know if you'd like to go into further detail about any of the things I said above.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404627317", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Say we're in the key of C major, so our scale will be a C major scale:\n\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\n\nSo if we build diatonic triads (only using notes from the C major scale) from each scale tone we get this:\n\nI   = CEG (C)\n\nii  = DFA (Dm)\n\niii = EGB (Em)\n\nIV = FAC (F)\n\nV  = GBD (G)\n\nvi = ACE (Am)\n\nvii° = BDF (B°)\n\n\nBasically, the roman numerals tell you what degree of the scale the chords tonic is (E is the 3rd note in the C major scale, hence the roman numeral for 3 is used) and the use of capitals or lower case lets you know if the chord is major or minor (iii=Em, IV=F).\n\nYou have to start adding things to the roman numerals when the chord isn't just a major or minor chord. This happens naturally in the major scale when you build a diatonic triad from the 7th, results in a B diminished chord (half diminished if you're build diatonic 7ths, BDFA) so you have to add the diminished symbol resulting in vii°.\n\nOf course, chords are not always diatonic to one key, so it's common to see chords like III7 (E7).\n\n\nHere's a short example of a chord progression using stardard chord symbols and roman numerals:\n\n|C^6         |E^7       |F^       |C^6   E^7(b9) |Am7       |\n\n\n|I^6          |III^7     |IV^^      |I^6   III^7(b9) |vi^7        |\n\n\nUsing the roman numerals you can easily transpose the progression into any key you want, which is why they're handy to know!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404627372", "subreddit": "jazztheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; It's just funny that you defend the blatant hypocrisy that is the idea of a communist state\n\nWhen you say that I'm doing \"*X*\", you should probably quote the part of my comment where I do. Hint: I don't. The notion of a \"communist state\" is an oxymoron: a society cannot be classified as communism if there remains a state and social classes, which the USSR undeniably had.\n\n&gt; that isn't to say a lot or even most of it was. People did in fact have to wait hours in a line for food, because they had no choice to pay for it with the fruits of their labor.\n\nAgain, you should actually quote where I'm saying things that you're attacking, because straw-man arguments usually don't go so well. Point to where I said that there was no waiting for food in the USSR.\n\n &gt; chalk all of the wrong off as \"propaganda\", \n\nWhen it has been empirically and logically denied a multitude of times with evidence from the actual USSR, and the US is still making sure that children learn about something that never existed, or things that have been exaggerated to the point of becoming a living caricature (*DAE* think Stalin killed 50 *m i l l i o n* people?!), it's propaganda. The very definition of the term.\n\n&gt; One of the reasons the soviet union failed was because they tried to use force through a state to achieve it, which made groups that disliked communism say \"hey, these people are exploiting us, let's fuck right off and exploit them back\".\n\nHey man, thanks for giving me a perfect example of the kind of propaganda you've been subjected to. Someone worth talking to will say the following:\n\n&gt;&gt; The USSR did not last because it attempted to mix a largely feudal society immediately with a state-capitalist superstructure, .... (etc)\n\nThe kind of reasoning you've just used is clear idealism: focusing on *ideas*, things that do not exist in the materiality of the world, rather than *material conditions*, which have been shown to one of the key forces in human history, along with class struggle. That is the materialist view, and by focusing on *real things*, you can begin to make accurate analysis. Not state-fed bullshit like *hurr durr authoritarian totalitarian\"....\n\n&gt; hey, these people are exploiting us, let's fuck right off and exploit them back\".\n\nYou don't know what exploitation means, do you? It's not a emotional feelsy term that is attached to bourgeois morality. Exploitation refers to the appropriation of surplus value produced by workers by the capitalists that the workers are working for. Instead of owning the fruits of their labour, at the end of the work day, workers are immediately torn from that labour and it all belongs to the capitalist. The capitalist pays the worker a wage (which is ALWAYS less that the value of the labour performed in that period, otherwise it would not be profitable), and the capitalist has now accumulated the fruits of the workers whilst doing no actual productive work at all. That's what exploitation is.\n\nThe kulaks, wealthy farmers in the former Russian Empire, resisted collectivisation because they were doing reasonably well in the former system. As a result, for example, the famines in the Ukraine, were exacerbated by the kulaks destroying grain and lowering food supplies. That caused thousands of deaths. They were not exploited.\n\n&gt; Then they become lazy, and overuse resources. Because why work when you can just let someone else work for you? Everything happy in communism, woo!\n\nDAE the USSR=communism?!?!\n\nMany socialists would not even classify the USSR as socialist. At least learn something about other ideologies before you go attacking straw-men representations of them.\n\n&gt; Violence is good when it's capitalist pigs on the other end!!\n\nYou think the current system is not violent? What about the workers in Qatar or Bangladesh that are engaging in literal slavery for a matter of a few dollars and cannot physically leave their workplaces, which led to several thousand deaths in Bangladesh because of shitty structural integrity? Seriously, you need to actually evaluate what occurs in capitalism rather than apologising for capitalists, in accordance with the morality you've been trained to follow. Violence is always bad no matter what, amirite guise?\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404730076", "subreddit": "vexillology", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I had a really hard time figuring out houses by myself when I first started studying astrology. I had to track down a professional in my area to help me out! So I'll try to clarify them for you. Once you get it, the chart really lights up!\n\nHouses are the 'pie slices' in the wheel - see how there are glyphs for each zodiac sign on the outside of the wheel with vertical lines on either side, kind of a rectangle/box shape? And the pie slices lie on the inside of those boxes, which delineate houses. Each sign is 30 degrees (which is why each zodiac sign box is about the same size) but the houses' size can change depending on where you physically are in the world. A house will align with a sign, starting with the first house &amp; Rising Sign/Ascendant (many use those two words interchangeably). Do you see the numbers on the inside of the pie slices, right by the circle in the middle of the wheel? That tells you which house the pie slice is associated with. There are 12 houses and each house correspond with a sign, in order, starting with Aries (1) and ending with Pisces (12). That's helpful for interpretation. \n\nSo, back to your chart. Your Rising Sign/Ascendant is in Libra, so your first house is in Libra. Therefore, your 2nd house is in Scorpio, your 3rd is in Sagittarius, your 4th is in Capricorn, etc. There are several different types of house systems (Placidius, Porphyry, Whole Sign) that you can research and use if they work better for you.  To find out what house a planet is in you locate the glyph of the planet (let's use the Moon since that's an easy to see glyph) &amp; find which pie slice. You've got a Leo Moon in the 10th, then. This is where it can get confusing, because your Midhevean is in Cancer but most of the house is in Leo. \n\n&gt;Would you call me more Airy? Firery? Or Earthy? \n\nAstro.com has these handy dandy references on the chart itself in regards to what element/multiplicity is in your chart. It's a 3x4 box on the left - C F M on the top is in regards to multiplicity (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) while F A E W on the left is the elements (Fire, Air, Earth, Water). I would say you are primarily Air, with Earth coming second, Fire third, and Water last. \n\n&gt; How do you determine important trines, retrograde, etc. stuff that people talk about a lot here?\n\nThis is the meat of astrology &amp; it is complex. I would recommend looking at your Top 3 (Ascendant, Sun, Moon) and any aspects made from those points to other points in the chart. Then do your own research! For example, you have your Sun conjunct Venus in Gemini in the 8th. This is doubly important since your chart ruler is Venus, the planet that Libra (your ascendant) is in charge of. Research \"Sun conjunct Venus\" \"Sun in the 8th house\" \"Venus in the 8th  house\" &amp; \"Venus in Gemini\" (I'm assuming you already know about Sun in Gemini). There are tons of sites out there have have basic descriptions of aspects/house placements. Read a bunch and see how they reflect on your past/current experiences. \n\nThere are several different ways to examine aspects. I can go into more detail if you'd like. There's also a literal shit ton of information out there on this topic and many different schools of thought.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, what do you think of my chart in context of a musician?\n\nAstrologically, music is ruled by several different planets/signs/houses. Pisces, Leo and Taurus are the signs associated with music/art. House 5 is associated with art in general - I would also posit that the 12th has a connection to music. Venus &amp; Neptune are associated with art in general (Neptune is the higher evolution of Venus), I also think Mercury could be associated with music because of Mercury's association with the voice. \n\nYour chart doesn't scream artistic to me but that's not the end of the world! You've got your 5th house (creation, children, games, sports) in Pisces (dreamy, intuitive, artistic, empathic) which is an implication of some sort of artistic leaning. You just don't have any planets in Pisces (though there could be a minor asteroid) so the influence isn't as strong as it could be. Sun conjunct Venus would imply artistic leanings too, though it could also be a desire to be around beautiful things more than a drive to create beautiful things. \n\nThe chart is a map not a cage! I was looking at Maya Angelou's chart after she passed and I was surprised because it certainly didn't look like a writer's chart to me. Just an example of how the chart can be miscontrued!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404750347", "subreddit": "AskAstrologers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Robo-Pound\n\nYou have 2 - 2 person teams on either side of a table.\nIn the center of the table there are 6 regular sized cups and 1 large cup.Align the cups with 3 regular cups on either side of the large cup.\nPlace beer about halfway up in the regular cups and fill up the large cup with as much as you want.\n\nEach team has a quarter.  The goal is for one team to make it to the center cup first by emptying each of the 3 cups on one side.\n\nThe game begins by bouncing the quarter off the table to the cup furthest from the center.  If you miss, you have to pass the quarter to your teammate. If you make it, the opponent across from you has to drink that cup.  Here's the catch. While your opponent is drinking you get their quarter and can continue shooting.  They can only get a quarter back by drinking the beer that you made it in and getting it out of that cup. \n\nThe winner is the first team to make the quarter into the center cup, regardless of how many that team made in the regular sized cups.

If you have \"no clue\" how to spell a word, like not even a single inkling, you need to sit down with your kindergarten teacher again and relearn the alphabet and which letters make which sounds. This is what I'm trying to tell you and you're failing to understand. Find me a grade schooler, let's say 8 and up just for shits and giggles. Ask them what letter they think the word \"tiger\" starts with. If they can't even figure out that much, then they're either mentally handicapped, have never spent a single day in school, or have never seen or heard of the alphabet before. So our little 8 year old says \"T\" excitedly. Very good! Now what other letters do you think might be in there? \"Tiger...hmm. I think it has an I next because of the eye sound, a G because it makes the guh sound, and an R at the end because it makes the err sound!\" Outstanding! That's not the whole word though, we'll have to find out the letters we're missing. Now let's open our dictionaries to the T section, since we know it starts with a T. Now narrow that down to the Ti section since we know the next letter should be an I, and let's try and find a Ti word that has a G and ends with an R. Here we go, \"Tiger\". I guess that could be it. What does the definition say. \"A large cat that lives in the jungle!\" That's our word alright. So the proper spelling of Tiger is T I G E R! We did it! If only iUpvote had learned what sounds letters make in kindergarten he could have joined in and helped us too! Yayy, we used a tool to solve a problem. What's another word for that kids? Problem solving! \nNow what about them big bad words like \"pterodactyl\" and \"xylophone\" you ask? Well good thing we got you started on the long complicated road to problem solving! How can we solve this problem? Hmm, we can't use a dictionary, I looked everywhere for pterodactyl in the Ts and just couldn't find it anywhere! I know, let's try something else. I'll just google \"big wing dinosaur\"! What?! First result?' Who knew it started with a P?! Good thing Mr AintGotNaLegsLtDAN taught us to problem solve using things like dictionaries to help us learn how to spell! We'd be lost forever! \n\nTLDR: Human children learn how to spell words they've never seen before by sounding them out.

{"body": "Core items for jungle: feral flare, wits end OR bork. Can start with machete and 2 green wards (not pink+green anymore, darn you riot!) because of his high sustain.\n\nAfter those items i like to get frozen heart and spirit visage and merc (if they got cc, which is pretty much always). Due to his heals he has much effective HP, and getting much armor is better then much health, unless they can burst you, in that care get HP.\n\nSkill order for jungle: W Q W E W R E and then max W first and Q 2nd. 2 points in E gives a lot of movement speed to chase down targets. Dont spam your Q in the jungle, its a waste of mana since you will barely be going anywhere near low health thanks to your passive, machete/wriggles and your W.\n\nBtw, warwick is not completely useless pre6 if he has red buff and the enemy is overextended. People will overextend because they think ww is useless pre6, so make use of that. Red slow + E speed up gives enough stickyness to deal quite some damage, burn flashes and maybe get a kill. BUT you are prone to getting counterganked (and jungled too, so get wards).\n\nWarwick can do dragon quite early, with just a little bit of help. So if the adc/jungler of the enemy dies, go dragon.

{"body": "Let's review the evidence:\n\n**\"There is no physical or archaeological evidence tied to Jesus, nor do we have any written evidence directly linked to him.\"**\n\n**\"Nor do we have more written evidence for Pontius Pilate\"**. Apart from the Pilate stone the writer mentions, Tacitus, Philo of Alexandria and Josephus wrote about him and we know more about his life and personality that Jesus.\n\n**\"by the early second century we know that Christians exist and believe in a Christ figure\"** They B E L I E V E in an Christ figure. Not evidence of historicity.\n\n**\"mentions the deportations of Jews after riots “on the instigation of Chrestus”. There is a possibility that he means a Jew named Chrestus, a not uncommon name\"** So, since the passage could be referring to a Jew, this is not convincing evidence of historicity. Furthermore, Christ supposedly died around 30 CE so how can he be instigating riots in 41-54 AD (the period the passage refers to). The passage makes no sense if it refers to Christ.\n\nThe writer adds: **\"At best, Suetonius supports that Christians were living in Rome in the 50s AD.\"** Exactly.\n\nThe writer mentions Tacitus referring to the trial of Jesus under Pontius Pilate but adds that **\"Tacitus’ information is clearly second-hand,\"**. Tacitus wrote roughly a generation or so after the accounts of the trial in the gospels had been written. The gospels and/or the belief among Christians at that time that Christ had been judged by Pilate could have been the source for that passage.\n\nThe passages in Josephus are contested and are at best inconclusive thus not worth bothering with. The writer says that: **\" For my part, a less sensational version of the text with obviously Christian elements removed is more likely to be original.\"** Why is that likely? \n\nHe then mentions the NT which of course is useless as evidence of anything. He claims that the gospels are undoubtedly based on oral tradition yet Paul, the earliest Christian writer, says that he did not receive his doctrines and teachings from any humans (\"**for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it**, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ\" - Gal 1:12) thus eliminating the possibility of an oral or written tradition going back to Christ. The earliest version of the Q document mentioned in that post, is basically a collection of saying and **doesn't mention Jesus**. They were **later attributed** to Jesus.\n\nThere is no clear reference to a historical Jesus in the **earliest Christian writings**. That's the whole point. I wouldn't expect historians of the time to mention an obscure Jewish preacher, but certainly the early Christians would have done so. They didn't. They believed in a cosmic Jesus, whom they knew only through revelation, who had died and risen in a supernatural realm (**belief in such a cosmic Jesus actually predates Christianity** according to Philo of Alexandria). Other Christians subsequently historicized this Jesus and made him into a real person.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404837397", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's hard to tell what exactly you mean. 'Guttural' is not a term that reliably corresponds to anything in particular, so I'll use the term *uvular*, which is when the tongue makes contact with the uvula, the hanging thing in the back of your throat. French has a variety of realizations of the /r/. Most times you use a uvular fricative, in other words, sound that passes through the tongue and uvula in a rough, obstructed way. This has two realizations: voiceless (pronounced with no vocalization in the throat; in English, /p t k f s/ are all examples of voiceless segments) and voiced (pronounced with vocalization; /b d g v z l m n r/ are all examples of this). French /r/ is usually voiceless after other voiceless segments (e.g. in *litre* 'liter' and *craint* 'fears') and voiced otherwise (e.g. in *livre* 'book; pound' or both in *rendre* 'give back, render'). Occasionally, however, you may hear a uvular trill, which is like a burst of rapid, repeated contact between the uvula and the tongue. My intuition tells me that this happens mainly for emphasis at the beginning of a word, at least when used in dialects where the uvular trill is not the typical realization of /r/. There is some dialectal variation in French that can lead to more uvular trills or apical trills (made with the tip of the tongue) or other variants.\n\nSo while I have no idea about what you perceive as 'guttural' versus 'non-guttural', I hope that this explanation clarifies why you might be hearing different variants.

You can buy the blue orb at the lane shop (so u dont have to go to the secret shop). \n\n2. Forcestaff, u can escape and u can get closer to the enemies to secure the kill. And also gives u int (more mana, more damage with your Q (SPAM IT!!)). \n\n3. Bloodstone. First getthe full ring and then the other 2 orbs. The blue orb is inside your boots, so when u have all the items,you can right click your boots and separte the orb from the boots.

{"body": "&gt; There is no physical or archaeological evidence tied to Jesus, nor do we have any written evidence directly linked to him\n\nUntil the discover of the Pilate Stone, the same was true for Pontius Pilate.  Direct physical evidence from this period is exceptionally rare, and so the lack of it doesn't mean anything.\n\n&gt; They B E L I E V E in an Christ figure. Not evidence of historicity.\n\nWithout the historical Jesus, you have to explain the existence and appearance of early Christianity.  Until you can propose an alternate way this religion came to appear in the forms it did in the early 2nd century, simply doubting Jesus' existence is meaningless.\n\n&gt; At best, Suetonius supports that Christians were living in Rome in the 50s AD\n\nSee my comment above.  You have to get from a mythical Jesus to a historical one, for people living 20 years after his supposed death.  That's an incredibly short time frame, so you actually need to propose something plausible.\n\n&gt; The passages in Josephus are contested and are at best inconclusive thus not worth bothering with. \n\n**One** passage is contested, but historians don't simply throw out evidence when it's tricky to deal with - they face it head on, and make the best arguments they can.  If you reject the Testimonium entirely (a minority position, but a case you can make) you're still left with the reference to 'James, the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.'  Again, you can't just dismiss it; you have to propose an alternative explanation.\n\n&gt; or my part, a less sensational version of the text with obviously Christian elements removed is more likely to be original.\" Why is that likely? \n\nPerhaps because a Syriac copy of Josephus that contains a less sensational version of the text with the obviously Christian elements removed has been discovered.  Unless you have an argument why the passage would have been removed?\n\n&gt; He then mentions the NT which of course is useless as evidence of anything. \n\nThis is my favorite mythicist maneuver.  Oh, there were half a dozen ancient authors that wrote about Jesus?  We can throw all of them out without question.  No; you need to argue that the ways in which the Gospels are unreliable is fatal in ways that are significantly different than the supernatural claims that were routinely made about other historical figures whose existence isn't questioned.  We have biographies of Alexander the Great that mention prophecies that he'd conquer the world - we don't throw them out.\n\n&gt; There is no clear reference to a historical Jesus in the earliest Christian writings. \n\nNope.  Paul mentions that Jesus was executed, that he was 'born of a woman', that he was a Jew, and that he had a brother.  None of those makes any sense except in a historical understanding.\n\n&gt; They believed in a cosmic Jesus, whom they knew only through revelation, who had died and risen in a supernatural realm (belief in such a cosmic Jesus actually predates Christianity according to Philo of Alexandria). \n\nThe only evidence for this is the fevered imagination of non-historian mythicists.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404882821", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Exactly.\n\nThis would be terrible.  But you should try to understand why.  It's not because of the C major.  It's because B and F, being a tritone apart, doesn't give you *any* melodic direction.  Your melody will totally suck because the scale -- just those two notes -- is symmetric and has way, way, way too little intervallic variety.\n\nOn the other hand, incorporating those notes over a C major chord is no big deal.  For example, if you play C, D E F G A B C, with the first C an 8th, the other notes 16ths, and the second C a half, over a C major chord, you'll find that it sounds just fine.  It's a C major scale!  The F and B are passing tones.  No problem!  You don't hear any sort of clash!  And of course, the B is only a dissonance in C major if you're... actually, no, I can't think of anyone who avoided this note in C major because of its so-called dissonance.

{"body": "That's the dumbest explanation of it I've ever heard. If you're playing the chords Am and Em, the listener won't \"interpret it as A minor\", it'll *be* A minor. The key of a song isn't determined by some arbitrary decision made by the songwriter, it's determined by the notes in the chords being played and, more importantly, what note the progression resolves to.\n\nTry playing one bar of Am, one bar of Em and then a C note (3rd fret A string). Then try playing one bar of Am, one bar of Em and then an open A string. \n\nWhich note sounds more \"right\"? Probably the A. That's because the progression resolves to A. Which means the key is A. But with this information alone, we don't know if it's A major or A minor. So how do we find that out?\n\nWe harmonise the chords. This means taking the notes of the chords and building a scale with them. I assume you already know how chord construction works and how to know which notes are in a chord.\n\nHere are the notes of A minor: A, C and E. The notes of E minor: E, G and B. When we put these together, we get A B C E G. If you're familiar with intervals, you might notice this scale has a minor third (the C). This means it is a minor scale. In this case, A minor. Congratulations, you have determined the key of the song. \n\nWhen playing a melody, you can choose any scale that contains no notes that clash with the notes in the chords you're playing over (use your ears). In this case, the most logical thing to do would be to play the natural minor scale, but you could also play the minor pentatonic, or the dorian scale, for example. Note that you can play notes that clash with the chords. This is called dissonance and can add a lot of flavor to your music.\n\nAnd yes, the source you're reading from does seem kinda, err, shit. \"Modal chords Am and Em\"?

This also happens to be the same notes as A major (A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#), but starting on the fifth instead of the 1st. \n\nThen once you pick up on tricks like these it's just remembering the notes on the guitar after that.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404948628", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Care to respond to my altered question?\n\nIt doesn't change a thing.  V7 is a dominant chord.  IVM7 is a major seventh, as is IM7.  In both cases, the fact is that vii0, as a diminished triad, forms part of the V7.  The V7 is heard so often (unlike the other diatonic 7th chords of the major scale, IM7, ii7, iii7, IVM7, vi7, viiø7) that, when you hear vii0, you hear the V7 without the root.  Since vii0 has no fifth, you don't hear 7 as the root of the vii0.  You hear 5 as the root, except that the 5 isn't in the chord, which is why it's a rootless V7.\n\nNow, the reason your brain isn't filling the 5 in is because you're probably not using vii0 correctly.  It's a pretty ugly sound -- in root position!  You usually see it as a vii06, spelled D F B.  Try playing D F B, C E C.  Then, try playing D F G B, C E G C.  It's pretty much the same thing.  The 7 really doesn't work as the root because its primary function is melodic, not harmonic -- it's the leading tone.  There *are* times when it might be OK to use a root position diminished triad, but those opportunities are few.  You'd need a very good reason for that 7 to be in the bass.  The example from music theory class back in college was a sequence, where the bass notes matter.  In most other situations, don't write the leading tone diminished triad in root position.\n\nBy the way, a viiø7 or vii07 (in minor) is often viewed as a dominant 9th without the root.  The D B F A chord usually recalls a G D B F A chord, a G9, and D B F Ab, a common diminished 7th chord (well, used to be), is a G7b9 used generally in minor music everywhere.\n\nAs for examples of the vii0 being used, I really don't have any -- that's because it's usually a less nice version of the V7, especially in pop music where the bass is mostly emphasizing the root position.  But PLENTY of music has V7's.  Second chord of the Beatles' O-Bla-Di, O-Bla-Da, for instance.  The major blues has dominant 7ths on the 1, the 4, and the 5.  Basket Case has V7's.  Weird Al's Pancreas has it.  Pick pretty much any song in major and you'll find dominant 7ths.  Well, any song with an actual chord progression, anyway; four-chord songs don't usually go to the trouble.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404963031", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Its possible that YOU dont saw something like this but the fact is, also in the all loved WoW (and any other game like that) there are huge numbers of bots.\n\nThis WoW Advertisement from the Goldsellers happend a lot during daytime and if Blizz banned them, a new 100 bots already stand in the starting zone waiting for them to make their special group dance that appears to show the URL of their sites.\n\nAnd this is how it looks at the end of the hacker day...\n\nhttp://images.eurogamer.net/2012/articles//a/1/5/1/9/1/0/2/WoWScrnShot_100812_013502.jpg.jpg", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404969989", "subreddit": "WildStar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**--------= = = = K O R E A N S = = = =--------**\n\n\nMy idea for the Koreans is to give them a full Siege tech tree and...not a whole lot else. No civ has a full Siege tech tree in Age of Empires 2 but the Koreans were known for being very innovative and coming up with different weapons. However their land forces were never anything to write home about...at least during the Imjin Wars where they had to get their asses bailed out by the Chinese (and their civilian forces but more on that later). So the Koreans flesh and blood units would be okay up until the Imperial Age where the Koreans do it with Siege.\n\nMost important units:\n\nHwacha - Their Unique Unit now instead of the War Wagon. Instead of having ridiculous Onagers + ridiculous War Wagons, they have no War Wagons but have ridiculous super Onagers that are created from expensive Castles.\n\nCannon - The Koreans frequently used artillery after stealing gunpowder from the Chinese. Anti-Cavalry.\n\nSiege Tower - Anti-Infantry.\n\nBombard - Anti-Siege, anti-building\n\nVillager - Okay so this might be where the old Spanish UT Supremacy goes. The Korean army got the shit kicked out of them by the Japanese so it's up to the Villagers to pick up the ball. Furthermore, the Villagers can repair buildings and Siege, so it would make sense for Korean ones to be extra special somehow.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**UNIQUES AND BONUSES**\n\n&gt;Villagers repair faster?\n\n* This would be a minor bonus for them but it would emphasize their Siege and Towers. In real life, the Koreans had strong defenses and they had various artillery weapons that they would use on those fortifications so what's a bonus that benefits both? This one.\n\n&gt;Economic bonus about trade, the sea, or a strong defensive bonus?\n\n* The Korean economy was nothing special. They relied on agriculture and mining and lumber but they weren't real special at those. Korea does have abundant mineral wealth so mining could work. However the old Stone Mining bonus would have to be paired with something else to give the Koreans a chance to survive early on. In real life, the Koreans relied heavily on oceanic trade with the Chinese, Manchurians, Japanese, and Malays.\n\n&gt;Some naval bonus?\n\n&gt;Team Bonus: \n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Hwacha\n\n* The Koreans didn't have a unit quite like the War Wagon of AoE2. They had a very unique weapon known as the Hwacha, which was represented in AoE2 by giving Onagers extra range.\n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Geobukson\n\n* Turtle Ships! And this time, they're only available in the Imperial Age. I'm aiming to make naval battles more interesting and make them guaranteed to hit the Imperial Age...because that's when the biggest naval battles were fought! AoE2 is historically correct in that it's all about massed Galleys, but it happens tooooo early.\n\n&gt; Unique Tech: No 2nd Age UT yet. Maybe something to do with Hwarangs?\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Righteous Army: Villagers can add power to Siege weapons? Higher HPs? Better combat abilities?\n\n* The populist in me salivates at this idea. The Righteous Army refers to the Korean irregular militia, called up during times of war. They are called \"Righteous\" because they almost always rise up in defense of their nation. I read up about the Korean civilians after the Japanese captured present-day Seoul during the Imjin Wars: the civilians rose up against the occupiers and actively sabotaged their supply lines. Civilians all over the peninsula attacked and harassed the Japanese after their army had been embarrassed by the Japanese. So just like in AoE2 where most of their flesh and blood units sucked, they're also going to suck here, and the Villagers will have to pick up the slack. I wanted Cavalry to tow Onagers to give them extra speed, Archers to garrison in my new Siege Tower units for extra power, and Infantry to garrison into Rams to give them extra power and speed. The Korean Villagers can garrison into all of them to give them extra power. Only Villagers can garrison into Hwachas, however. And they can repair them during combat faster?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS:**\n\n&gt;Infantry: weak in Imperial\n\n* The Japanese beat the absolute shit out of the Korean Infantry in the Imjin Wars. The Koreans practically had no shock infantry.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: crappy\n\n* Korean cavalry has never been particularly powerful, especially since they live in a mountainous region.\n\n&gt;Archery: I don't really know yet.\n\n\n&gt;Siege...ry?: full\n\n* The only civ to have a complete Siege tech tree.\n\n&gt;Navy: ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1404974084", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think I've submitted this story before, but it's been a few years since...\n\n**D O G M O U T H**\n\nI had been out of the dating game for a while at this point. A friend had recommended OkCupid (an online dating app). It seemed decent and so I decided to sign up for it. My profile was atrocious the first go-around. I didn't know what to write or anything.\n\nI spent several months without any bites.\n\nThree months after having my profile, I matched with this girl and we started talking a lot. We spent about a week chatting on OkCupid and then we took it to text. I asked if she wanted to grab some dinner, go see a movie maybe. She said she was interested but declined the dinner part. I thought it was weird but I was desperate for a date. I decided we would go to the drive-in.\n\nBefore I get to the actual date, I'll just preface this by saying she wasn't the prettiest gal in the drawer. She was cute in a gothic kind of way. She had short blonde hair, fair complexion and a sweet smile. But in all of her pics she never once exposed her teeth. *whatever* I thought, she may just have braces or be embarrassed. I used to have braces; I get it.\n\nWe agree to meet at a shopping center. I think she didn't want me to know where she lived. Anyway, I'm wandering this store looking for snacks to bring when she calls me. We end up bumping into each other. I was... [disappointed](http://youtu.be/cdEQmpVIE4A). She looked bigger than any of her pics and she had recently died her hair a dark black. I only mention the hair because it really contrasted with her yellowish complexion. I greeted her and she smiled big.\n\nI need to stop right here because honestly her mouth disgusted me. [Her gums reminded me of a dog](http://www.welcomepup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydneys-Teeth.jpg). I thought to myself *this date better suck or else I'll end up kissing her*\n\nOkay, I've recovered. She's real sweet which is great. I wonder if the date will go well.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nWe get in my truck and we head over to the drive-in. There's a double feature playing; *The Campaign* &amp; *Ted*. Prior to going to the movies, I told her what movies would be playing and she said she hadn't seen them but was interested. That's important. So we find a spot and the movie starts to play. I'm trying to make small talk with her, get to know about her and her life. I felt a little awkward about the whole thing, but I tried.\n\nShe would have none of it. She was pretty tight lipped about everything. At one point she had mentioned she used to live in Seattle and I was asking how she managed to live there. I made a couple jokes like, \"Oh were you like some bank robber or something and you'll have to kill me if you tell me?\" I was trying to be cute. **NOPE**. Her grandma had died and this girl had inherited the money. At that point I realized this date was going to be miserable, but that I would try to salvage as much as possible.\n\nWe're watching *The Campaign* which is a comedy about politics. I try to talk about a few different political subjects, softball stuff like LGBT support, environmentalism, etc. She says she doesn't want to talk about them because she'll just get angry.\n\nFinally, after a brutal hour and 45 minutes, the movie ends. As *Ted* starts up I just tell her I'm tired and that I will drop her off. It's complete silence as I drive back to the market. She gets out, barely says bye and then takes off.\n\nI went and had In-n-Out by myself, so I guess I got that going for me.\n\nTL;DR - Dogmouth.

{"body": "Well the TL:DR is that it sounds good.  \n\nThe long (over-simplified) answer is that in any key you have 7 chords, based on each of the 7 notes of the major scale.  \n\nThink, Do Re Mi, but instead call it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.  And just like Do Re Mi when you get to 8 it's the same note as 1.  In C major (no sharps or flats), this would be spelled C D E F G A B C.  \n\nSimple triads (3 note chords) are formed by playing every other note from the scale at once.  For example, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th note of the major scale make the I chord.  The 2nd, 4th and 6th make the ii chord.  \n\nEvery 2 consecutive notes of the major scale have another note between them, which out of key, except for the space between the 4th and 5th note, and the 7th and 8th note.  These are the black keys on the piano keyboard, with BC, and EF being the half-step intervals in C (no sharps or flats means no black keys, every other key but C has one or more black keys that take the place of a white key).  It's called a half-step when two notes are next to each other without a note in between.  A whole-step is 2 half steps.  \nThe major scale is spelled WWHWWWH.  This is asymmetric, which means that each starting point, all 12 notes, will you give you a unique order of whole-steps and half-steps.  \n\nAs a result, in a major key:  \nI ii iii IV V vi vii^o I  \n\nThis corresponds to 1-3-5; 2-4-6; 3-5-7; from the major scale.  Upper case roman numerals are major chords, lower case are minor chords.  The ^o means it's a diminished triad.  \n\nIf you add 7ths to the chord, you make 4 note chords, by using 1-3-5-7 from the major scale to make the Imaj7 chord, 2-4-6-8 to make the iimin7 chord, etc.   \n\nNow, armed with that knowledge, let's tackle Mary Had A Little Lamb.  \n\nI'll give you a clue, it starts on the 3rd, and is only harmonized with the I and V chords.  Play the melody, then figure out where your C and G chords go, and this goes a long way to understanding basic tension and resolution.  \n\nThe V chord is tension, the I chord is resolution.  The ii and IV chord are also both tension chords, but not nearly as strong as the V chord, and it's very common to see a ii or IV chord setting up a V chord, then going to I.  \n\nHarmonize \"Twinkle twinkle little star.\"  The melody starts on the tonic and it contains only I, IV, and V chords.  \n\nIn jazz the ii chord is almost always used instead of IV to set up the V chord, and ii-V-I's are found in countless jazz standards.   \n\nHopefully you get something out of this post,  \nCheers!

{"body": "Each note in a scale (in this case C major) is labelled with its distance from the root (first note). The C major scale is C D E F G A B C (AKA, all the white notes on a piano). Starting with C as 1, then we get E=3, so E is a third in this scale. As the distance from E to G is the same as the distance from C to E, the interval between E and G is also a third.\n\nOP's confusion comes from the fact that there are actually more notes than just those in the C major scale. In the chromatic scale (white notes and black notes), E is four notes above C, but G is only three notes above E. Although both intervals are thirds, they are different kinds of thirds: C+E is a major third, E+G is a minor third. Notes in the chromatic scale are said to be a semitone apart.\n\nThe \"perfect fifth\" that OP mentioned is the interval you get when you stack a major and a minor third. It is five notes apart on the major scale (hence the name), and seven semitones apart. The problem OP encountered was that they thought that the perfect fifth came from two major thirds stacked together. This would make the interval eight semitones, which is either an augmented fifth (a fifth with a semitone added) or a minor sixth (a sixth with a semitone taken away).\n\nThis is a lot to take in on your first look at theory, but if you go through it with your teacher or find some simple online guides then you will get it eventually. It's worth learning some theory as it makes it easier when you play with other instruments, as it will allow you to change key easier, work out what key you are in (to find a good key for your singer) and what chords to play.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405201040", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I've seen this a lot about APL/J/K and Forth, all languages that I'm very fond of. \nAll these languages are remarkably simple. They can be leaned in a few hours. It can take a little longer to explore all of the implications of what you've learned, but you don't have to do that all at once, and certainly not before you can use these languages to solve real problems.\n\nInterestingly all of these languages are or have been used by non-techincal or casual users at one point or another, to solve some quite complex problems.\n\nYet we professional programmers assert that they are terribly flawed languages that no-one can even read let alone learn. This is nonsense. Though at one point I would have agreed actually learning and using these languages has a way of changing your mind.\n\nThey're not difficult. They are different.\n\nI've heard it said many times that\n\n&gt; Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot. \n\nNow dispite all of the claims that Lisp is weird and unreadable (mostly because the parentesis seem to be in the wrong place) it's not that different from most languages out there now and learning Lisp having already used Python or Ruby or whatever is a pretty dull experience. Don't get me wrong there are still some really beautiful ideas to learn from Lisp, but as time goes by I think this addage is becoming more repeated and less true.\n\nOn the other hand Learning APL/J/K and or Forth was a truly mind destroying experience for a seasoned programmer, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them on this alone.\n\nAre these languages really so unreadable or do they just demand a different way of looking at problems than we're used to?\n\nWhen I have to explain Forth I really try to emphasise that it's a meta-language; you don't really solve problems in Forth so much as you use it to conjure up the language you need. Any reasoning can then occur naturally at the language level rather than requiring any detailed consideration of how information flows between the various words.\n\nHumans are very good at this as it turns out.\n\nThe following example was taken from the core of a ~100 SLOC editor I wrote.\n\n    : c       !mark mark+ ;\n    : i text+ !mark mark+ ;\n    : d             text- ;\n    : b mark-       text- ;\n\n...\n\n    : h .page used# dump ;\n    : s .page used# show ;\n\n...\n\n    : u mark+ ;\n    : e mark- ;\n\n...\n\n    : {  mark@ ;\n    : }  mark! ;\n    : ^  mark* ;\n    : $  mark~ ;\n\n...\n\nBelieve it or not these are among the most complicated definitions and they're expressed in a language for describing the position of the mark in the page/text.\n\nThe following example was taken from the core of an assembler that I wrote\n\n    : prep u #d 8 * lshift  ;\n\n    : used swap ;\n    : slot ;\n    : slots ;\n\n    : code 1 slot  used prep  ;\n    : data n slots used prep ;\n\n    : pack h @ or h !  h+! ;\n\n ...\n\n    : code 09 code pack data pack ;\n\nHere the assembler is implemented using a language for describing instructions. At this point you can stop asking what's being passed to what on and more or less write sentences that are obviously correct, or gibberish. \n\nAPL/J/K are similar, to various extents. J and K more so than APL.\n\nThe implicit flow of infromation between components that characterises these languages is necessary to allow this linguistic reasoning and problem solving. This seems almost obvious to the untrained, but as professional programmers we fail when we try to apply the tools that we learned from other languages... and we don't like it (and reasonably so!).\n\nTrusty tools like procedural decomposition, and design principles and patterns just don't seem to work and we're left with what looks like a symbolic mess.\n\nWe belong to a group of generally smart people so obviously if we can't make any sense out of this then it stands to reason that noone can. Well we're wrong. And I say that as a very proud programmer who was once humbled by having to learn the hard way.\n\nAnother way in which these languages are different is that they're often used interactively and in a more literate way. Here's a good example from APL.\n\nhttp://dfns.dyalog.com/n_life.htm\n\nTo me this looks a lot like a maths paper.\n\nThe actually program is only a small fraction of the actifact and the explaination of the problem is done in plain english, including diagrams aswell as the code. These are not comments.\n\nThis I think represtents an ideal compromise. We're all keenly aware that humans aren't really that good at playing computer but computers also don't want to have to deal with the layers of drivel we introduce to make the code we write \"readable\". \n\nNow we programmers will complain that we don't have time to write this stuff... but we're more than happy to spend 60% of our time writing and maintaining tests in various frameworks that we insist on siting our customers down in front of so they can understand *what* we assume our program should be doing... or refactoring hugely broken piles of code for whatever the latest design fad is... or fucking around trying to encode our human understanding in the type system.\n\nWe waste so much time on this stuff and our peers still can't really understand that simple piece of code we wrote last week. No matter how long we spend in code reviews when we've moved onto the next job they're going to struggle to reconstruct our insight.\n\nIt's not on the page, it's in our heads.\n\nWe try and sometimes we suceed but I'd much rather peer review a versioned APL workspace (or a maths paper) than the hierarchy of 10s of classes spread over an arbitary file structure that make up that visitor pattern that Joe thought would be great way to implement blah, or for that matter these beautiful type signatures that apparently enfoce some obscure constraint that Bob thought was important enough to spend days on. Though of the two I'd much prefer this one.\n\nThe point is that if we don't write this stuff down then this vital context will have to be painstakingly reconstructed by anyone that tries to understand our code - and that includes us.\n\nIt's not in the code, it's in our heads.\n\nThe guys who designed and wrote APL apparently knew this better than most.\n\nAnd context is extactly what You're missing. In the presence of context all of the problems that you raise with APL/J/K vanish.\n\nThese meaningless symbols stand in for and expound possibly deep concepts; some of which may take pages, chapters or books to adiquately explain.\n\nHow do you sum this up in a word?\n\nWhen we write programs the names we choose usually reflect some analogy that we wish to maintain.\n\nA factory.\n\nBut they break down very quickly.\n\nA factor factory.\n\nMoreover we can easily become trapped by these analogies and fail to see the simple solutions. Analogies can be as dangerous as they are useful. Symbols and the rules by which we manipulate them, akin to mathematical languages, can often provide a mechanism for reasoning that doesn't require (but may be combined with) analogies.\n\nThe function associated with the symbol \"-\" in fact has a good many names. Subtraction. Minus. Deduct. [Relative] Difference. Distance. Remove. Take [Away] etc.\n\nEach of those words invokes a context and it's in this context that the mind work to understand the form. If you were to choose any one of these words for the name of the idea you would reduce its applicability by virtue of placing the mind into a specific state (the context).\n\nIt's not that the symbol is meaningless, so much as that it has many meanings.\n\nNow you can go too far with this but there's nothing inherently wrong with this, and when coupled with a good explaination, as seen in the APL workspace or a good maths paper, this use of symbols can be invaluable.\n\nAs to\n\n    a b c d e\n\nI almost didn't bother with this.\n\nSince you've intentionally removed all context then proceeded to raise questions about a b c d and e there's not a lot to say. This makes J seem much harder than it is since from any actual program it's not at all hard to see whether a b c d or e are monadic, dyadic, adverbs or nouns, but it is literally impossible here. I honestly don't know if you really find J that hard or you're just being disingenuous.\n\nPerhaps you could try to explain your point another way? (Without the strawmen please)\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405267296", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

What order are words placed in?\n\nSVO, noun-adj order, adverbs go anywhere.\n\n&gt; Are there any unique letters or sounds? Explain them.\n\nProbably the whole bilabial-velar series, especially the prenasalized /^(ŋ͡m)k͡p ^(ŋ͡m)g͡b/. For letters, the weirdest is probably ‹q› for /ŋ/ — I wanted something easy to type.\n\n&gt; Is there a story behind the language?

Spell out all the chords:\n\n- F: F A C\n- G: G B D\n- Am: A C E\n- C: C E G\n\n2\\. Write out each note that appears in a chord once in alphabetical order. (It doesn't matter where you start in the alphabet, just that they're sorted in order of increasing frequency.):\n\n- A B C D E F G\n\n3\\. Find keys that contain these notes. It will almost always be one of the chords in the progression. You get better at this as you do it more. I'll just say that the two major keys that fit this are F and C. (This means that their relative minor keys, D and A, respectively, fit as well.)\n\n4\\. Decide which chord has the most finality and the key will probably be the one with that as tonic.\n\nDisclaimer: This does not work for all chord progressions, but it does work for many simple ones.

{"body": "Right.\n\nYou have to know the meaning of the symbols \"(\", \")\", \"[\", \"]\", \",\", and \".\" before you can read even the tiny piece of code you gave, just as you have to know the basic forms in APL/J/K before you can read APL/J/K. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that you should have to learn a language before you can read code in that language. The extent to which you don't have to do this is the extent to which the language is similar to the languages you already know.\n\nBeing different enough to require learning does not mean the language is unreadable.\n\n(You should also be weary of what you know; you don't want to know too much since this will limit the changes you can make to internals without breaking your interface. Representation independence is a beautiful property that not many modern languages currently have...\n\nA good example of this at work is how you can't tell the difference between a function and an array in K at the syntactic level)\n\nThe set of operators/abverbs in APL/J/K are fixed and the syntax is very consistant, though it does vary a bit between the three. You do not have to learn every functions in the language like you seem to believe! You only need to learn to recognise a small set of basic forms.\n\nYou will have to learn the functions if you want to be able to understand them when you encounter them... but that isn't unusual. Did you automatically know what flatmap does or did you have to learn what it means!?!\n\nThat these basic forms are just symbols, like the basic functions in these language, is not as big a hurdle as you keep insinsting. You can quickly learn to pick out the important symbols as easily as you do in C.\n\nTo say that you created a language which you claim preserves a lot of what's good about J you don't seem to know it all that well.\n\nYou don't seem to understand for example, that whether a verb is used monadically or dyadicially in J depends on where it appears... because this determines how the verb will be invoked and with what arguments. This is not some property of the verbs definition that needs to be remembered. It's plain to see in the syntax of the language.\n\nYes you do have to consider the rank, as this will have a baring on how verbs apply, but this isn't any more difficult than learning operator presidence rules in X and in truth it's far less arbitary.\n\nBroadly speaking you read right to left. You identify the terms, paying attention to any adverbs, and the you identify the forks or hooks (just a fork with the identity function.) Everything else falls out.\n\nPlease consider the following C program.\n\n    a b c d e\n\nYes this is C. All I've done is what you did; I've replaced the symbols that indicate the structure of the expression with letters. Can you tell whether a, b, c, d, or e is a function, variable, operator, or keyword?\n\nIf (a b c d e) were written in Lisp you still wouldn't have a clue because a may be a macro and then all bets are off.\n\nIn Haskell you need to know the precidents of a b c d and e to determine what is passed to what and in which order.\n\nDo you now see how bad your example is?\n\n\nNow in Forth it's true that if you don't know what all of the words mean you have no idea how the data flows. But again this isn't as big a problem as you'd think since as I already indicated above, you don't program in Forth; you use Forth use it to build up problem-oriented languages, for expressing certain problems, and at this level you don't think about how or what data is being passed between individual components.\n\n\nI do like to look of your pseudo-code and will be looking more into Swym when I get the chance but I don't think it's more readable and maintainable by almost any metric.\n\nBut it must be noted that the APL definition is complete and self contained while the Swym pseudo-code appears to use supporting functions that are not shown here. \n\nAnd again you've taken the APL definition of Life and ripped it out of the context that explains its how and why... I don't know why you keep doing that.\n\n*The whole workspace is the definition, not this one little function.*\n\n\nIt should also be noted that this APL definition of Life is was intentionally brief and you could factor this into named functions. There's is never anything stopping you from using meaningful names in APL, as of course any large APL program will.\n\nThe query language Q used in KDB+ is a problem-oriented language written in K that and provides an English like language that looks remarkably like SQL but has access to the full power of K.\n\nAs with Forth I argue that this is how you should think about programming in APL/J/K - by constructing problem-oriented languages quickly and concisely in the terse base language then using that problem-oriented language to solve the actual problem in a natural and readable way.\n\nThis however takes a whole new set of tools... and I don't think we're quite ready to consider this as a reasonable approach to designing and building large-scale software yet.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405291333", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

It kind of makes the scale sound minor, but not really, because Ab is also a note of the Bb7 chord. Beautiful ambiguity!\n\nSame idea with F(nat). If you start on Eb and bend up to F, both those notes are part the major AND minor scales, and so the listener can't tell; are you in major or minor? In anticipation you draw them in and your solo becomes more interesting.  \n\nCheck out this solo by Larry Carlton to get an idea of what I'm trying to say:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW5MAwRafEk\n\nThis is like a master class on blues, it's got everything.

{"body": "Starting from the top, then.  Most chords are based on a specific formula of 3 notes: The root note, or 1st, a 3rd and a 5th.  These numbers refer to notes in a scale that could be made from the root note of the chord.  So if we start at a C, the C major scale is C D E F G A B C.  So 1-3-5 means the C major chord is C E G.  If we used a C minor scale (C D Eb F G Ab Bb C), we'd get C Eb G which is a C minor chord.  The minor chord formula could also be written as 1-3b-5.\n\nSo the difference between a major chord and a minor chord is that flatted 3rd.  It's only a half step, why does a small change affect how we perceive the chord so much?  Because certain notes sound good together and other notes don't sound good together.  This is called consonance or dissonance.  Major chords and scales are more consonant, their notes sound better together.\n\nSo why do some notes sound better together?  Because of physics.  All of sound is waves, and waves tend to interact with each other.  Think of when you're in a car at a stop light and you have your turn signal on.  If the car in front of you has their turn signal on as well, odds are good they don't blink at the same rate.  Eventually they match up but then grow apart together.  This difference in frequencies creates an interference called a beat pattern.  As sound, it sounds kindof like [this video](http://youtu.be/TrpQX5uKxQY?t=59s) hear how the volume goes in and out? WuWuWuWuWuWu, sort of?  That's a beat.  If the frequencies are at certain multiples of each other they tend to reinforce each other and if they're out of sync they break each other down.\n\nBut that's volume, why does this have any effect on why notes sound good together?  Because of more physics.  This is the Harmonic series.  Think of a piano.  When you hit a key, a hammer hits a string inside the piano and makes it vibrate.  So the wave in the string starts bouncing back and forth from both ends.  [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave) is probably better at this than I can be.  Check out the animated gifs that show the opposing waves creating the standing wave in the string.  What's important is that unlike in the 2nd gif, waves in a string bounce back after hitting the other end, this means that there are several nodes forming at once.  Basically the string is vibrating at all these frequencies at once.  It's weird, but it happens.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDTj6tBnHlA) is good at illustrating that an overtone of a certain fundamental pitch will cause sympathetic vibration in a string with a fundamental pitch an octave higher.\n\nIn fact, this harmonic series is why we make chords from the 1st, 3rd, and 5th scale tones.  If you look back at my first image, you start with C then get another C then a G, which is a 5th, then another C, and then an E which is the 3rd.  So if you make a major chord, all you're doing is playing the first 5 notes of the harmonic series, they work together really well.  But if you go off the 3rd by a half step to make a minor chord, they clash a bit more so it doesn't sound as bright and clear.  You're actually playing a note that interferes with a natural harmonic that is legitimately present in the harmonic series you're hearing, muddling the sound.  But a minor 3rd doesn't sound too awful because it interferes with the 5th harmonic, which is not only pretty weak harmonic but also the actual harmonic is like 3 octaves above the fundamental and the further apart two notes are the harder it is to hear their relationship while you're playing a minor 3rd above the fundamental.  Things like minor 2nd (Jaws theme) sound awful and tense because they directly interfere with the fundamental.  The tritone from the diminished chord clashes more than the minor 3rd because it's not only a half step away from the 3rd harmonic, which is a stronger harmonic.\n\nIs that any better?  I mean, there's a lot more there but it assumes less built in knowledge of music theory and is more explicit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405357632", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;&gt; the C/G is called a cadential 64 chord \n\n&gt;So, tell me if I'm analyzing this correctly. A cadential 6/4 in C Major is the (seventh) I chord in second inversion. It's spelled G-B-C-E. It has the intervals of a major third (G to B), minor second (B to C), major third (C to E); perfect fourth (G to C), major sixth (G to E), perfect fourth (B to E). Is that all correct?\n\nTypically, the cadential 6/4 doesn't have the seventh (B) in it. The numbers 6/4 stands for the intervals above the bass. So you have your bass (G) , a 6th above the bass (E), and a 4th above the bass (C). We can write any chord using this notation. Your normal root position chord could be written as (Root pitch)5/3 and your first inversion chord could be written as (Root pitch)6/3. So when /u/CrownStarr wrote that G/B chord, which reads \"A G chord with B in the bass,\" he could have also written G6/3 (which can be abbreviated as G6), which reads \"A G chord in first inversion.\" \n\nNow, you may have noticed that with 6/4 chords (second inversion chords), you don't name the root the way you do with other inversions. This is because 6/4 chords behave in very particular ways, so we like to name them by their behaviors since that conveys what they're doing a bit better. \n\n&gt;So, I guess this chord just works really was as a terminal predominant. How much of that is due to the dominant tone being in the bass? \n\nYou are extremely close. The dominant tone being in the bass has everything to do with why we call it the \"Cadential 6/4,\" in fact, that dominant note in the bass is so powerful, that it pulls our ears to hear that function. Therefore, the cadential 6/4 is serving a dominant function, embellishing the root position dominant chord, which typically occurs immediately afterwards. \n\nTry playing the following bass line in quarter notes: C F G G C. We clearly hear that C as the tonic, the F as the predominant, and the G as the dominant. We really don't need any other information to tell us that. \n\nNow, play the same progression in the bass, with the following close position chords in your right hand (starting from the lowest \"tenor\" note to the highest \"soprano\" one) E/G/C, F/A/C, D/G/B, D/G/B, E/G/C. All that has done is confirmed what the bass line already told us: our progression is C F G G C or I IV  V V I. \n\nNow, play it again, except this time your right hand plays E/G/C, F/A/C, E/G/C, D/G/B, E/G/C. Everything is the same except for the 3rd chord, which has now become your cadential 6/4 chord. But the arrival of the bass on 5 tells us we are on the dominant function. So ask yourself how is that chord embellishing the motion from the F major chord to the G major chord? Well the motion from C to B is embellished by holding the C over from the previous chord and then resolving it down \"late,\" what we call \"suspensions.\" The motion from F down to D is embellished with a passing tone E. So you can see, a cadential 6/4 chord is a combination of passing tones and suspensions that embellishes the arrival on V that we already got in the bass. \n\nAs for how they're labeled, there's different systems. Some people just use Cad6/4. Other people write the cadential 6/4 as a \"gestalt\" gesture with the V chord that comes after it, ie as V6/4-5/3. The dash tells you that the notes a 6th and a 4th above the bass move down to be a 5th and a 3rd above the bass, which is exactly what happens in the progression above. I really like this label, because I think it captures what the cadential 6/4 does most clearly. \n\nSo a Roman numeral analysis of the chord progression I have above would be I IV V6/4-5/3 I", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405375463", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Medium sized version:\n\nThe game begins with a kickoff. The teams line up eleven across. The kicker kicks the ball. If goes out of bounds, that's a penalty and the receiving team automatically starts with good field position. If it goes into the end zone, the receiving team can take a knee and start at the 20 yard line (touchback). Once in a great while, the kicking team will do an \"onside kick\" where they kick it only a short distance and try to recover the ball. It has to go ten yards. But if they end up with possession, they get to keep the ball.\n\nThe offense and defense now come on to the field. They huddle and the quarterback calls the play which was relayed to him by the coach calling the plays (usually the offensive coordinator) and the quarterback also gives a snap count for when the center will snap the ball. The offense consists of the offensive line, including a center, two guards right next to him, and two tackes right next to them. On one side, usually the right, is the tight end. so it looks like this: T G C G T TE.\n\nThe other offensive players are always a quarterback and at usually at least one or two running backs, and 2-3 wide receivers. There are 11 men to a side. Usually it's two running backs (types of running backs include halfbacks and fullbacks), and two wide receivers. There are different formations that they can line up in such as I, pro set, single back, or shotgun.\n\nThe defense has a defensive line usually 3 or four linemen, including a noseguard who lines up across from the center, 3 or four linebackers, two cornerbacks, and two safeties.\n\nThe offense breaks the huddle and the quaterback starts trying to figure out what the defense is going to do. He might send a receiver in motion. You can have one player in motion when the ball is snapped, but he can't be going forward. The quaterback might change the play at the line of scrimmage. The ball is snapped. \n\nIf it's a run, the offensive line will block to try to make a hole for the running back to go through. The defense tries to get off the blocks, close the hole, and tackle the running back. If it's a pass, the receivers run their routes, the offensive line blocks to try to create a pocket for the quaterback to stand in and throw the ball. On defense, the cornerbacks and safeties try to cover the receivers.\n\n\nIf the offense doesn't get 10 yards or more. it's second down. If they lost yardage or only got a yard or two, or it was an incomplete pass, it's probably a passing down. This means the defense might switch to a pass defense such as a blitz where two or more extra players are going after the quarterback. If the offense doesn't gain a total of 10 yards by the end of third down, they have a decision to make.\n\nThey can go for a first down. If they fail, it's a turnover on downs and the other team takes possession of the ball. They can punt (kick the ball to the other team) and try to give the other team's offense bad field position. Or they can kick a field goal (try to kick the ball between the big yellow uprights).\n\n\nhttp://www.nfl.com/rulebook/beginnersguidetofootball ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405423058", "subreddit": "sports", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

No matter what 'couple' it is casting, if their love for the game and skill shines through, viewers will overlook other things that might be viewed as otherwise glaring. \n\nSimply put, these chinese casters sucked outside the realm of being a couple who were flirty. Now people want to puff their chests out and say how the flirty stuff was what their issue with them was.  \n\nNo, the issue was they sucked. The flirting wasn'T the 'problem', it was just something that did while sucking. \n\nLet me elaborate before you flame me into next week.\n\nThe general feel I get from reading these comments is that kind of behavior has no place on a public cast.\n\nTaigaBlitz wrote\n\n&gt; If the lovebirds can't keep it to themselves on a public cast, then maybe it's time to start looking for a different calling. \n\nSo from this statement, are we do derive that there is now some sort of  ethical line being drawn for casters to abide by? Did anyone watch the EU hub TI4 qualifiers couch stream? There was no shortage of profanity and innuendo tossed, yet this abstract, odd, unscripted cast racked in huge viewership and I don't recall a thread popping up complaining. \n\nWhen you start putting limits on things, you might miss out on good shit. Rather then draw lines and say THEY SHOULDN'T DO X, think hard boys, some of the shit you would find unprofessional - you would turn around and laugh at on another stream.\n\nI think it's important to keep this in mind. Because the censorship will come soon enough. When the add money has gotten hold of all the streams, and the GD is talking like espn sports center all Ps and Qs dotted, yah..I'm not looking forward to it. But I can't blame anyone for coming up on add money and changing shit up.

{"body": "&gt;**If the \"sometimes true/sometimes false\" response is included, the results\nfor girls and boys are 95 percent and 98 percent, respectively, an altogether\nnegligible difference.**\n\n.\n\n&gt;The Wellesley study gives a lot of attention to how girls are behind in\nmath and science, though the math and science test differentials are small\ncompared to large differentials favoring girls in reading and writing.\n\n.\n\n&gt;**As we have seen, however, the evidence suggests that it is boys who\nare suffering an overall academic deficit. Boys do perform slightly better\non standardized math tests, but even that gap is small, and closing. In the\n1991 International Assessment of Educational Progress (IAEP), the Educational\nTesting Service found that on a scale of 100, thirteen-year-old\nAmerican girls average 1 point below boys. And this slight gap is altogether\nnegligible in comparison with the gap that separates American\nstudents from their foreign counterparts. Taiwanese and Korean girls are\nmore than 16 points ahead of American boys on this same test.27**\n.\n\n&gt;**The exceptions were Korea,\nTaiwan, and Jordan. In Korea, 27 percent said that math was more for\nboys; for Taiwan and Jordan, the figure was 15 percent. \"Interestingly,\"\nthe report notes, \"the three countries that were more likely to view mathematics\nas gender linked . . . did not exhibit significant differences in\nperformance by gender.\"2 8 And girls in two of those countries—Korea\nand Taiwan—outperformed American boys.**\n\n.\n\n&gt;**As an equity feminist who wants\ngirls to excel, I see debating clubs as an important tool for teaching\nstudents to be articulate, cogent, persuasive, and forceful. True, adversarial\ncompetitiveness is a part of every debate, and so favoring skill in debate\nmay be made to seem like favoring aggression. So what?**\n\n.\n\n&gt;The report did find that girls are better than boys in computation, a\nrather small consolation in an era of hand-held calculators. \n\n.\n\n&gt;What of the gender gap between American boys and girls in math? As\nnoted earlier, the Educational Testing Service (in its International Assessment\nof Mathematics and Science) found that although thirteen-year-old\nAmerican girls lag a point behind the boys, that gap is insignificant\ncompared to the one between American children and foreign children.\nRecall that the disparity between our boys and Taiwanese and Korean\ngirls was 16 p o i n t s . \n\n.\n\n&gt;Girls in French-speaking Quebec outperform our boys by\n12 points on the IAEP math test. In fact, American boys lag behind girls\nin such countries as Ireland, Italy, and Hungary.7 5 In science the results,\nalthough not quite so dismaying, continue the pattern: American boys\ntrail significantly behind the foreign girls.\n\n.\n\n&gt;**They distinguish between minor violence,\nsuch as throwing objects, pushing, shoving, and slapping (no injuries, no\nserious intimidation), and severe violence, such as kicking, hitting or\ntrying to hit with an object, hitting with fist, beating up, and threatening\nwith gun or knife—actions that have a high probability of leading to\ninjury or are accompanied by the serious threat of injury.**\n\n.\n\n&gt;**As a crime\nagainst the person, rape is uniquely horrible in its long-term effects. The\nanguish it brings is often followed by an abiding sense of fear and shame.\nDiscussions of the data on rape inevitably seem callous.**\n\n.\n\n&gt;Koss\ncounted anyone who answered affirmatively to any of the last three questions\nas having been raped:\n8. Have you had sexual intercourse when you didn't want to because\na man gave you alcohol or drugs?\n9. Have you had sexual intercourse when you didn't want to because\na man threatened or used some degree of physical force (twisting\nyour arm, holding you down, etc.) to make you?\n10. Have you had sexual acts (anal or oral intercourse or penetration\nby objects other than the penis) when you didn't want to because\na man threatened or used some degree of physical force (twisting\nyour arm, holding you down, etc.) to make you?\nKoss and her colleagues concluded that 15.4 percent of respondents\nhad been raped, and that 12.1 percent had been victims of attempted\nrape.9 Thus, a total of 27.5 percent of the respondents were determined\nto have been victims of rape or attempted rape because they gave answers\nthat fit Koss's criteria for rape (penetration by penis, finger, or other object\nunder coercive influence such as physical force, alcohol, or threats). However,\nthat is not how the so-called rape victims saw it. \n\n.\n\n&gt;**Koss and Pollitt make a technical (and in fact dubious) legal point:\nwomen are ignorant about what counts as rape. Roiphe makes a straightforward\nhuman point: the women were there, and they know best how\nto judge what happened to them. Since when do feminists consider \"law\"\nto override women's experience?**\n\n.\n\n&gt;Yet, instead of taking these young women at their word, Koss\ncasts about for explanations of why so many \"raped\" women would return\nto their assailants, implying that they may have been coerced.\n\n.\n\n&gt;**The fourth is\nproblematic, for it includes cases in which a boy penetrated a girl with\nhis finger, against her will, in a heavy petting situation. Certainly the boy\nbehaved badly. But is he a rapist? Probably neither he nor his date would\nsay so. Yet, the survey classifies him as a rapist and her as a rape victim.\nI called Dr. Kilpatrick and asked him about the fourth question.\n\n&gt;\"Well,\" he said, \"if a woman is forcibly penetrated by an object such as a\nbroomstick, we would call that rape.\"\n\n&gt;\"So would I,\" I said. \"But isn't there a big difference between being\nviolated by a broomstick and being violated by a finger?\" Dr. Kilpatrick\nacknowledged this: \"We should have split out fingers versus objects,\" he\nsaid. Still, he assured me that the question did not significantly affect the\noutcome. But I wondered. The study had found an epidemic of rape\namong teenagers—just the age group most likely to get into situations\nlike the one I have described.**\n\n.\n\n&gt;By the\nseventies, women had been granted a great deal of equality.\n\n.\n\n&gt;**Good social theorists are painfully\naware of the complexity of the phenomena they seek to explain, and\nhonest researchers tend to be suspicious of single-factor explanations, no\nmatter how beguiling.**\n\n.\n\n&gt;How a\nfeminist reacts to data about gender gaps in salaries and economic opportunities\nis an excellent indication of the kind of feminist she is. \n\n.\n\n&gt;Since all\nnew professors are required to \"publish or perish\" in the first six years of\ntheir career, the tenure clock ticks away at exactly the same rate as young\nwomen's biological clocks.5 0 Adjustments are called for since this state of\naffairs seriously affects equality of opportunity.\n\n.\n\n&gt;The private sector, arguably,\nhas been more creative with respect to flextime, on-site day care,\nand home office options, and is likely to evolve further, out of economic\nimperative, rather than through the kind of government intrusion favored\nby many of the gender warriors.51\n\n.\n\n&gt;Professor\nBergmann recently surprised some of her fellow feminist (and nonfeminist)\neconomists by opposing a long-standing proposal to include the\nvalue of nonmarket activity, such as housework and child care, in the\nofficial gross domestic product figures. Her reason was revealing: \"Part of\nthe motive [of the proposal] is to lend some dignity to the position of\nhousewives. What I think feminism is about is getting women off of the\nhousewife track.\"5 3\n\n.\n\n&gt;**The new Wolf calls for a feminism that \"is tolerant about other women's\nchoices about equality and appearance,\" a feminism that \"does not\nattack men on the basis of gender,\" one that \"knows that making social\nchange does not contradict the principle that girls just want to have\nfun.\"6 4**\n\n.\n\n&gt;According to the National Institute of Mental Health's Psychiatric\nDisorders in America, the yearly prevalence of depression is 2.2 percent\nfor men and 5.0 percent for women; the lifetime rate is 3.6 percent for\nmen and 8.7 percent for women.7 8\n\n.\n\n&gt;She added that in\nsome of her other studies she had found a similar percentage of men and\nwomen showing signs of affective distress: women have more symptoms\nof depression; men, of antisocial behavior and alcoholism.\n\n.\n\n&gt;**In a 1989 review of the literature on marital happiness in Psychological\nBulletin, the authors conclude, \"For both sexes the married state (vs.\nunmarried) was associated with favorable well-being, but the favorable\noutcomes proved stronger for women than men.\"8 4**\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;**But women are no longer disenfranchised, and their preferences are\nbeing taken into account. Nor are they now taught that they are subordinate\nor that a subordinate role for them is fitting and proper. Have any\nwomen in history been better informed, more aware of their rights and\noptions? Since women today can no longer be regarded as the victims of\nan undemocratic indoctrination, we must regard their preferences as \"authentic.\"**\nAny other attitude toward American women is unacceptably\npatronizing and profoundly illiberal.\n\n.\n\n&gt;\"Women are getting much more honest about looking at men, and about\nleering.

As mentioned in OP, I've got a fear of carbs, so I've never traditionally bulked/cut, just slow and steady.\n\nAs for snatch goals, I've never been properly coached on the lift, so I'm a bit apprehensive to climb too high on that. I've been working more on the muscle snatch than the full snatch, simply because its a bit less technical. I guess ideally a BW snatch would be the goal.\n\nAesthetics to me are pretty important in terms of keeping body comp lean so that my BW ratio's for lifts stay as high as possible. Aesthetic MOVEMENTS, like isolation stuff, is indeed back burner for me over big compounds and/or Oly work.\n\nI swapped to high bar when I re-built my squat from how I learned to \"squat\" in high school, and found my stance to be much narrower than most. This is fine with me, and affords me a good carryover to front squatting, which is nice. I think this also helps with my triple extension a bit for cleans, as I have been making decent progress in both cleans and squatting since really trying to focus on them. I probably just need to pick one target to hit first instead of chasing them simultaneously.\n\nThe GSLP template I picked up was actually A B C A B C, which helped with the boredom a bit, but I still really enjoy the frequency of 4+ days lifting.

{"body": "For Support I'd say pick up thresh and if you get good with thresh you can make a terrible ADC look amazing. Also He offers great peel and a lantern for clutch saves and can throw behind for unexpected ganks.\n\n\nFor Top and Jungle: I would say pick up Jarvan he snowballs extremely hard and is good through all stages of the game. You can first pick him and the enemy won't know if you are going top or jungle and you can pick the favorable matchup for yourself.\n\n\nIf ADC is your least played position I'd suggest to stop playing it in solo que and let others play it to better your chances of winning. Practice ADC in teambuilder so when you support you can anticipate what the AD will do.\n\n\nFor Mid I would suggest Twisted Fate and Orianna both scale well and can farm real good. With TF you have the constant pressure when you go mia post 6 and Orianna farming mid and wraiths will give you a huge lead in xp and cs. Last but not least ori being able to 100-0 most people late game with a god q r w q w gg.\n\n\n\n\nMost importantly you need to pick champions that fit your playstyle. Are you better at catching people? Are you better at teamfighting? Are you better at snowballing your own lane/roaming and snowballing others?\n\n\nOnce you figure out your playstyle pick champions that excel in what you are great at!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405527898", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Diana is a nightmare-tier lane for most melee champs (wanna see me bully renek out of lane?), but that's reversed until level 6 for ranged matchups.\n\nI find the best thing to do is to shove hard with your passive at levels 1/2 while taking their harass with W (start W), when the enemy can't really punish you, and force them to burn a bunch of mana trying to clear the wave, eat a bunch of minion damage, or just slowly watch their tower die.

Don't push R 2 times unless it'll kill something; the cooldown is goddamn forever.\n\nAlso, if you're taking a lot of damage (fucking Ori and Kayle), consider putting 2 points in W before 6, and getting E after (W Q Q W Q R).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405530853", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "IT really depends on who you are playing, but the reality is that assassins are down in this meta so they are harder. Generally though you are looking to pick off key people in fights and then get out. You sort of weave your way in and out of fights finding the best angles and times to pick someone off. Assassins also have specific power spikes where they are really good. Some are straight forward while other aren't. Example Zed's power spikes are lvl 3, lvl 6, lvl 11, lvl 16, and when he gets his first big item (used to strictly botrk), and then again when he completes lw. \n\nAnother big thing to know which just comes with time, is how much damage youcan do at all points. This is huge with assassins because their targets either live or die, and if they don't die, essentially the fight becomes a lot more one sided.\n\nAnother huge thing to learn is when to go for the farm and when to let it go. If you are playing fizz into a syndra, you are probably going to have to let a lot of farm go early levels or you'll get poked out of lane. You have o learn to take what you can get. With Some assassins you can farm easier than others, but it really depends on the match up. \n\nAs far as the mindset goes - assassins are the epitome of taking advantage of your opponents mistakes, keeping track of cooldowns and calculated aggression. You can't blindly all in otherwise you'll probably lose. Take Zed into Syndra (since I main Zed). She just missed her stun? Im gonna e w q w auto e her before backing off so I can set up a kill later for myself. Notice Brand has blown all of his summoners and you have yours up? All in him while dodging the stun. It's things like this that help you set up yourself to snowball you advantages. Once you get an advantage, you need to start helping you team out and snowballing them. \n\nI do this 2 ways. Either I'm constantly pushing to tower while keeping good ward coverage to take off jungle pressure or I'm roaming myself. Either way, the whole point is to try to exert huge amounts of pressure by getting yourself to be a priority target and then pushing towers, dragons, and or taking pressure off elsewhere while not dying. The key that most people miss is the NOT DYING part. People seem to have this mindset that they need to get fed on assassins. Sure it absolutely helps but not if you are 11/11 and have fed their adc kills. They scale harder than you do. I would rather be 3/0 and pushing objectives than 6/6 and their team is fed as well. Of course trading yourself in a teamfight for 1 or two other piority targets is generally a good idea but getting that kill on the support in the enemies jungle and then dying is generally never worth it. \n\nThe Last thing to remember is to pick your battles. I had a game yesterday as Zed where I was playing a 2 exhaust team with a Kayle Malphite Amumu lucian and thresh. There was zero way for me to assassinate lucian or kayle in teamfights with that much cc and peel. I was essentially useless in teamfights depsite being 6 and 0 ( i know, how is that possible against a kayle as zed?!). So instead I told my team I'm going to try to split their team apart by splitpushing and bring down one of their key aoe players where I could 1 v 1 them and easily kill them while my team had a better chance 4 v  than 5 v 5.  I ended up exerting such a huge amount of pressure that I had all 4 or 5 of the enemy team trying to get me while my team ended up pressuring else where. Needless to say we won not because I had kills but because I chose where to fight my battles and where the best place to apply pressure to was. Sometimes it won't always work, but sometimes teamfighting isn't possible and you need to either get picks or apply pressure in other ways to split the team apart. You thrive in 1 v 1 situations and you want to try and look for those situations. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405531505", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "What chords are you playing over? This is a very big part of getting a modal feel. \n\nIn general it comes down to the fact that there are certain chords and intervals that really want to resolve to the major tonic. To make a modal sound you need to avoid those movements and also emphasize the scale degrees that make the mode unique.\n\nSimple example is lydian. It's a major scale with a raised 4th. But if you try to play F lydian over a progression like C F G C (which are chords in the mode) it will just sound like C major because those chords resolve towards C. \n\nFor this reason many many modal pieces use static chords or 2-chord vamps because it's easier to avoid resolution in ionian.\n\nTry playing F lydian over a static Fmaj7#11 chord. The #11 brings in the raised 4th of the lydian scale so it will sound like lydian and you won't have any chord motion destroying your modal feel.\n\nAnother example is miles davis' iconic \"so what?\". The song is in mostly D dorian (m3 m7 make dorian different from major) and the chord vamp is Dm6 Em6 which emphasizes the m3 and m7 of dorian without resolving back to C ionian.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405539910", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Interesting question.  The fifth is almost completely extraneous.  It makes the chord fuller, but it doesn't actually affect the quality of the chord otherwise -- basically, because of its relationship with the root, the fifth is completely *stable*.  So if you're going to drop a note, and there are a large variety of good reasons why you'd want to do that, the fifth is the easiest one to go.\n\nHere's an example.  You want a G7 chord, which is G B D F.  Each note has a job here -- the G is the root and anchors the chord; the B is the leading tone to C; the F is the leading tone to E.  The D doesn't need to go to any place in particular.  But now, imagine that the note in the melody is an E.  The chord is now a G13, which would be G B D F E.  Actually, technically the chord is G B D F A C E, but if you play that, you'll notice that it sounds horrendously ugly.  You gotta drop something!  Obviously, you drop the 9 and the 11, the A and the C, because you didn't want to use those notes in the first place.  What else do you drop?  The D.  The G is important as the root; the B and F have jobs; the D is just taking up a finger.  My favorite voicing for this chord is G F B E.  Try it.  (Try also the b13 version, G F B Eb.)  The E actually wants to resolve down to the D, and usually you don't want to include the note you're resolving to in the same chord.  And the D would change the texture of the chord as well.  G F B E has only sevenths and fourths, but add in a D and it either usurps the root at the bottom or adds a third (D F or B D) or second (D E).  You could add it above the E, but that would sound out of place.  So skip the D.  You have better things to do!\n\nBut you could actually drop the b3 instead, if you have one.  The b3 is also relatively unimportant, and the reason is that it's not a leading tone to anything, just like the fifth.  If you have a tonic minor 7th chord, say Cm7, that would be C Eb G Bb (presumably in a different voicing, but whatever).  None of these notes have any tendencies, unlike the dominant 7th chord which is full of directionality.  You can't drop the C because then you have an Eb major chord, and you can drop the Bb but then you lose the complexity of the minor seventh.  The Eb or G aren't doing much, though, and you can take them out.  This relies on the listener knowing that those notes are in the key, though, so if you're playing C major chords and all of a sudden play a Cm7 without the Eb, nobody will know it's supposed to be a Cm.  But if they are, the Eb doesn't need to be there.  Especially in a Cm9, you don't need it.  Cm9 is C Eb G Bb D.  There are three triads here, C Eb G (Cm), Eb G Bb (Eb), and G Bb D (Gm).  If you take out the Eb, you leave that Eb implied and you still have a minor triad, the Gm, giving your chord a minor sound.  I like the C G Bb D voicing on guitar, personally; it sounds polychordal and I like that.\n\nFinally, you can actually drop the 3 as well in a dominant chord.  It *has* a job, but you may just like the sound of it not being there!  In inversion, G7 is B D F G.  You can easily voice it B F G or D F G, and you still get much of the same effect, though not as richly as with all four notes.  The B tends to the C, but so does the D, just less strongly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405602630", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I would disagree with the \"Legendaries don't win games\" part. The higher cost ones at least seemed designed to be finishers and table turners in one. I had a Drood I was playing where I had the match in the bag. I had 28 HP left and he was down to 9 with nothing on the board. I was dominating. So what does he do? Drops Deathwing, destroys all my minions and discards all his cards. I have 2 cards in my hand and neither are 'get rid of Deathwing' cards. In 2-3 turns he was guaranteed a win JUST by dropping a single card on the bored. A win he was not going to make without it. Anyway, he clicks the end turn button and what would happen to draw for me? Twisting Nether. The only one in my whole deck. I use it and send his I-Win legendary to hell and later won the game. If Twisting Nether didn't draw, he would have won. So everyone forgive me when I say legendaries DO flippin win games on top of flipping the board around in your favor if your opponent can't remove them. They are very v e r y unfair cards to be matched up against.\n\nI think people that defend the argument that legendaries don't win games and are not pay2win cards just don't want to feel guilty about using them and want to justify their victory upon playing them. I especially love the 'use more skill then noob' argument. Playing the piano takes skill. Painting a landscape takes skill. Clicking your mouse is not a skill. Maybe all these people have practiced Mavericking the cards they need to the top of their deck over the course of 15 years and they can always counter legendary threats. I suppose that does take 'skill' and they're not simply delusional.\n\nIf you can remove their legendaries then you stand a chance.

They have interactive sessions instead of just cards and dictionaries, and that helps stick things down.\n\n- Don't get into the /specific/ grammar. Know how sentences are formed (subject+verb+rest, adj goes before or after noun, and how to ask a question should suffice) and major things like the third person rule for verbs in English (have to put an -s, as in eat -&gt; eats) or noun genders in European languages. Exceptions come later on. Also if they use a different alphabet, you might want to try and focus on either the spoken or written language first.\n\n- P R A C T I C E. \n\n- What helps me is association.

The last line is fucking haunting (*Fuck this health thing / Mama, I'm alright...*)\n\n\nEP - Freaks and Geeks\n\nNo fucking contest.  Bino doing him harder than anyone has ever done them before.  Raw, fun, clever, bangin'.  Love it.\n\n\nCamp - That Power\n\nThis track is just... I don't even know what to say.  The things it does for this album thematically are so affecting to me on an emotional level.  What Gets me the most is the way it completely turned my perception of the character presented on the album.  All the insecurity, the grandstanding, the misogyny, the anger, the sadness, the nostalgia, it all made sense with just one line: \"I got on the bus a boy, and I never got of the bus.  I still haven't.\"  Fuck me.  Perfect.\n\n\nR O Y A L T Y - We Ain't Them\n\nNot all that in love with this mixtape, to be honest, but i really dig the hell out of this song.  It doesn't stray too far from Bino's usual \"I'm so different\" fare, but it just goes about it in such a cool, collected way.  In other songs it seemed like he was very much trying to draw attention to how different he was, and here he's just telling you, as simply and as casually as he might say \"hello\" to you after a concert.\n\n\nBecause The Internet - No Exit\n\nI wasn't too hot on BTI either.  Though I did *like* it overall, it just felt like it missed the mark of what it was trying to do in so many spots.  This song though.  Nail on the fucking head.  The instrumental for this track is so eerie and unsettling, sounding like some sort of machine churning and threshing, grinding in perfect dissonance to the stark, muffled drums, and high-pitched, electronic beeps and boops throughout the track.  Then of course there's the lyrics, which perfectly, semi-abstractly represent just how numb and alone The Boy feels at this point in the story.  Which is to say nothing of Bino's delivery: Almost a flat monotone all the way through.  And it works perfectly.  It completely fits the tone and the emotional note of the story.\n\n\nBonus: Centipede\n\nThis is by far my favorite Bino track.  To me it represents that perfect sweet spot between Bino's desire to expand artistically (as demonstrated on BTI) as well as the raw, unfiltered honesty present on Camp.  He manages to, much like on Camp, give you a very real slice of himself in this one song, while still wrapping it in some very impressive poetry, that only makes the emotional impact stronger.  This, to me is Bino's equilibrium.  This song makes me sad that he tipped in the direction he did on BTI.  We only have this and Yaphet Kotto now to remind us of this perfect time.  Ah well.  Maybe it's better that way somehow...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405665362", "subreddit": "donaldglover", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The best way IMO to learn all the chords in the tunings you use and make it stick is to figure them out yourself. It sounds difficult at first, but after you learn a few tricks, it gets easier. Talk to your teacher about tricks, I'm sure they can show you a few. \n\nMain thing is you'll need to learn scales. They're not as hard as they seem at first, but take a little bit of memorization. Then, learn what \"one four five\" means. Basically, it means \"root fourth fifth\" or count up the scale to these notes. In G major, you count up the G major scale (G A B C D E F# G), so it would be root -G (1 G), fourth - C (1 G 2 A 3 B 4 C), and fifth - D (1 G 2 A 3 B 4 C 5 D). So, a \"one four five\" tune uses chords G C and D (usually as a G C G D G C G D G progression). \n\nThen, to make a chord, you use root, third, and fifth. Count the same way. So, G major would be root - G (1 G), third - B (1 G 2 A 3 B), fifth - D (1 G 2 A 3 B 4 C 5 D). Find all the G, B, and D notes in a range of the fret board. Play those together and you're playing a G major chord. Want to play a G minor? Well, just use the minor scale and do the same thing. Root - G (1 G), third - Bb (1 G 2 A 3 Bb), fifth - D (1 G 2 A 3 Bb 4 C 5 D). If you notice, the root and fifth stays the same in major and minor. If you're ever in doubt, just stacking the root and fifth will match pretty much any chord for a given root. So, if you're playing with C and you know the root of C is C and the fifth is F, you can play a C and F note to make a chord that will fit over practically all variations of C (C major, C minor, C7, etc.). If you're playing with a guitar, they will fill out all the other tones to make the minimal chord work.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405694778", "subreddit": "banjo", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

But they close at 2. So you have to start the night at 10 or 11. The people, however, seem very Hollywood. Some of them need to get stomped the fuck out. I felt that it is the most superficial out of the three. People really care about looks, and I felt like most had these gym bodies. People are/seem fake as mannequins. I feel like I am talking to someone, but the person doesn't really care, if that makes sense.  Oh, biggest drag culture I've ever witnessed. And a lot of clubs had Asian nights. \n\n**Los Angeles** (black): \n\nMess.\n\n**Atlanta** (mainstream):\n\n I don't even know if I even saw a white gay in Atlanta.\n\n**Atlanta** (black):\n\n Everywhere you turn, you see a gay guy. E V E R  Y W H E R E. Gayed out. Even if no one in the room admits they are gay, there is a gay man in that room. And that is a huge problem in Atlanta, and if you ever been on Worldstar, you have seen a fight about it. You get two pride parades. And these thirsty queens come from all over the country, and possibly the world, to go to these ratchet as shit gay events. What you do matters a little more than your looks, as people are all about the social ladder there. They have nice apartments and nice cars, but no furniture and no gas. Mess.\n\n**New York** (mainstream): \n\nNew York has the most diverse gay community that I've seen. If you go to a bar, you see all races. There is not as big of an issue with feminine guys as much as I saw in Los Angeles, but not as supportive as Atlanta. Most down to earth community ever. People talk to you just because you are gay here. And the nightlife ends at 4, though our bars are a little more scattered, and the lines are crazy. \n\n**New York** (black and Latino): \n\nWell, watch Paris in Burning and you will see how awesome it is.

{"body": "So. . . \n\nHere we go. I'm a music/guitar teacher. And I usually structure my lessons around my students and their wants/needs/situation/desires, etc. I think everyone should do that. And I don't usually spend too much time on modes especially if the student doesn't care about theory.\n\n**But modes aren't useless.** Modes help you think about tonality.\nWhat we consider the tonal center of a piece and how we arrange the notes around that tonal center influences how songs make us feel. How we perceive music matters. How we construct songs to convey emotions matters. It isn't, or at least shouldn't be, just an empty intellectual task. . .\n\nIf we deny ourselves the idea that 7 notes can be arranged in different ways to achieve different purposes... than we might as well through the idea of major scale and minor scale right out the window.\n\nYou wouldn't encourage people to stop learning about the minor scale. And yet all minor scales have a major scale equivalent. The article talked about the C Major Scale. I assume that the author would advocate that the C major scale is valuable and useful. But if we took the same notes (C D E F G A B C) and changed the tonal center to A (A B C D E F G A) we arrive at the A minor scale (this has to do with the pattern of whole steps and half steps in the \"new\" scale). \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is this. Modes confuse people. I think a lot of this is usually a teacher's faults. A lot of teachers push memorizing the order of the modes and prioritize learning how to spell phrygian over how to use the phrygian mode. They might even try to prioritize memorizing the numbers of relative flat and sharp notes in the modes. That's a mistake when it's learned without context. \n\nBut just because you could misuse or misunderstand modes doesn't mean modes are a waste of your time. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405736164", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

A 1 4 5 tune in the Key of C uses the chords C, F, and G. Songs in the key of C are usually easier to play in a C tuning, but this is not always the case. A lot of times, songs in the key of D are played in an open A tuning (A is the fifth of D).

If you count down 3 semitones from a major, you'll find the relative minor. Works with everything. C major is C D E F G A B C. Count back 3 semitones - 1 B 2 Ab 3 A.

{"body": "Well, people do often offer Pythagoras as the inventor of the Western diatonic scale, particularly citing his method of stacking perfect fifths (i.e. consecutively related 3:2 ratios with octave equivalence). However, my understanding is that his tuning applied specifically to tetrachords (i.e. short four-note \"miniscales\"), and there was some variation at the time in how tetrachords got combined. Sometimes they formed the diatonic scale we know today, sometimes they didn't (probably varying from composition to composition). In any case, it seems as though he designed a method of tuning for a practice that already predated him.\n\nSo, let's not claim Pythagoras as the \"inventor\" of the scale per se;  nonetheless, we can observe that his process works pretty neatly to fill out the span of frequencies across an octave using a simple mathematical relationship. (Overlooking small tuning differences between his ideal scale and the actual temperaments/intonations that we end up using, of course.) \n\nThe basic idea is you start with a pitch--the tonic--and then raise it up  a fifth (i.e. multiply the original frequency by 3:2). Continue raising by fifths (and lower by octaves when necessary) until you get enough notes to fill out the span of an octave from the original. So starting from F gives us F, C, G, D, A, E, B. Arrange those in order and you get F G A B C D E, also known as \"F lydian\". That right there gives us \"2221221\" in terms of whole and half steps; conveniently, that turns out to be the same pattern as the major scale \"2212221\" except it has been \"rotated\" a few positions away. So if we rotate the pattern so it starts on C, we get the familiar major scale of C D E F G A B, which is \"2212221\".\n\nBasically, I think the diatonic scale probably developed originally as one of many scales through a mostly unplanned, \"organic\" sort of process as musicians just used what sounded good to them; but I suspect the ability to justify it mathematically strongly contributed to the diatonic scale's rising dominance in Western tonality throughout history, since Western culture spent such a long time obsessed with mathematical perfection in the arts. So, the reason we have a scale that works neatly with the circle of fifths is precisely because, for cultural reasons, Western civilization began to favor a scale that could be *built* with fifths. (Practically speaking, I'm sure this simplified tuning too.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405781675", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Unless I missed something the focus wasn't on locating evidence of explosives.   \nhttp://www.wpi.edu/Images/CMS/MCSI/2005biederman2.pdf  \n\nYou have to feel sorry for these guys as they don't even know exactly where the steel they tested came from.  The newscasts called the WTC complex a 'crime scene' and the official bodies in charge did everything they could to turn it into a cleanup operation. \n\nFurthermore, where is the FEMA requested followup study?  After all Biederman said \"All of these things have to be explored,\".  I'm not surprised you offer an out of date publication as evidence for no explosives, what else have you got? Meanwhile [Mark Basil](http://markbasile.org/) marches on trying to fill in the gaps left by the multi-million dollar (lack of) investigation.    I am surprised you seem to be unknowledgeable about S U L F U R being an ingredient in Thermite.  Have you contemplated if the sulfur they found was from thermite?    \n\n&gt;No explosive residues found. Nor any \"nano-thermite\" found.  \n\nWas that because they didn't test for explosives?  A spray can of explosive detection costs $3.00. Is a million dollar study available that shows the results of such test?  Seems I remember that such studies were called for in standard fire investigative procedures.   \n\n&gt;The point of the air tests was to figure out what was in the dust to determine how dangerous it was to the people breathing massive quantities of it.  \n\nWe all remember Christie Todd assuring people the air was safe.  What's that got to do explosives? I guess you're arguing that it wasn't found by testing for everything else? That's not testing for explosives. If you had anything *specific* about testing for explosives you'd have copied and pasted it here. \n\n\n&gt;Yes, they tested for everything.  \n\nIf that was the case they would have questions about the [Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe](http://www.benthamscience.com/open/tocpj/openaccess2.htm)  *Volume 2, 2009 - General Articles*  You know this paper was peer reviewed.  As David Chandler said \"It's not getting swept under the rug.\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Why don't you?  \n\nI do believe I asked for a breakdown on how NIST handled the Barry Jennings account. I'll admit I ask because I currently believe they misrepresented it.  If his account was as easy to brush off as you claim NIST would have used the words you use. They do not. I find that suspicious.  But maybe I expect too much from NIST? They didn't use any given subpoena powers and appear to only have preformed an assessment of the buildings performance.  A true criminal investigation would have answered many of the questions the truth movement have asked.  \n\n\nI do appreciate your responses and I have benefited from your wealth of knowledge and supplied links. \n \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405800618", "subreddit": "911truth", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I tried to calculate how many plants there would approximately be and I got 4165 plants. Wrote all this at [7]. I could have made a huge mistake somewhere in the calculations but this is how I counted it:\nAbout 1.5 meters is the width of one lamp at the ceiling, and one \"block\" is about 3 meters wide (width of two lamps). See image:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/45ZMiHL.jpg\nThere are 8 blocks in a row, so 8 * 3 = 24 meters is the width of one row's growing area.\nI assume that the picture is taken approximately from level of cameraman's eyes, so the height of plants are about 200-220 cm. You need about 15 gallon pot for that. 15 gallon pot's diameter is 16 inch or 40.64 cm.\nIt's hard to say what is the width of one plant, but if the pot is about 15 gallon you could fit approximately 49 plants in one row (2400 ÷ 40.64 = 59 pots without gaps between them, but let's assume that gap is about 50 cm = 8 * 50 = 400 cm. (2400 - 400) ÷ 40.64 = 49). I've counted the area like this:\n    \n    x x x x x x x x ...\n    x x x x x x x x\n    x x x x x x x x\n    x x x x x x x x\n    x x x x x x x x\n    x x x x x x x x\n    x x x x x x x x\n    x x x x x x x x\n    \nHowever it's quite likely that plants are in following shape (maintenance lanes):\n    \n    x x  x x  x x ...\n    x x  x x  x x\n    x x  x x  x x\n    x x  x x  x x\n    x x  x x  x x\n    x x  x x  x x\n    x x  x x  x x\n    x x  x x  x x\n    \nSo every third row is empty. And how many rows are there? You can't say that from OP's picture because you can't see whole room. But let's count the area we see:\nThe length of one block is about 10 meters, see image (About 3-4 times 3 meters): https://i.imgur.com/VQK1VgX.jpg, flawless logic.\nWe can see that in the picture there are at least 6 blocks (image: https://i.imgur.com/kPxxqpd.jpg).\n6 * 10 = 60 meters is the length of visible area in the picture. And since we know how much plants you can fit in to 24 meters (49), we can use it to calculate how many there are in 60 meters: 60 ÷ 24 = 2.5, so 2.5 * 49 = 122 plants in 60 meters without maintenance lanes. With maintenance lanes (30% less plants) 85 plants.\nSo the room is 60 meters wide and 24 meters deep: 49 * 85 = 4165 plants approximately in OP's picture.\nWould like to know how much there really is so I know how badly I made my calculations.

{"body": "Shit like this really pisses me off. While the first one *might* be able to be argued as a mechanical issue due to a lack of proper service (when we find out what the hell actually happened), this second one is probably the world's most inconvenient and worst coincidence. C O I N C I D E N C E. While it can also be argued that Malaysia has not handled the initial situation in the greatest way, I like to think they're at least doing the best they can given the situation. What happened the first time has quite literally never happened before. There was no precedent with what to do because it has never happened before to set a precedent. Now the second one. It reallllllllly irks me when people blame Malaysia Airlines for that. I'm sure they're terribly sorry that the huge missile shot at them from 33,000 feet below them out of nowhere hit them. They had literally nothing to do to stop it. That air space was open. While it was maybe not a great idea to fly there, it was open and other planes were flying it too. Two other airlines were within 25km of them and it EASILY could have been either of them. Malaysia Airlines is one of the best airlines in the world and now people want to avoid them like the plague. It's a horrible tragedy and I think it's also pretty damn awful for the entire country of Malaysia considering that's their flagship carrier as well. They were trying to recover from the awful thing that happened 4 months ago and now they have a second thing - completely out of their control - making everything so so so much worse than it already was. I am incredibly sorry for all of the families who lost loved ones in both tragedies, but I think it's obnoxious to not consider the loss to Malaysia as a country as well. There's no need to kick them while they're down. /rant", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405839954", "subreddit": "travel", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not really, no. Again, this is something that is *usually* correct, but not always. The tonic chord of the progression can happen at other places than the first chord and the only way to really tell a key exactly is to look at all the chords and see which key they fit in. Other than, of course, using your ear and finding the chord that feels like \"home\" within a progression.\n\nAn example of a progression with a non-tonic starting chord could be something like this: \n\n    ii - vi - ii - vi - IV - V - I\n\nThese (roughly) mean the scale degrees which the corresponding chords are built off of and would in C be : \n\n    Dm - Am - Dm - Am - F - G - C.\n\n Even though it doesn't start off on a C Major chord, notice how at the end the progression resolves nicely to the C Major chord because we're only using chords within the key of C major (as well as doing a very common IV - V - I cadence at the end).\n\nThen there's modulation and atonality and a whole mess of other shit, but learning basic chord theory is not that hard and there's lots and lots and lots of free material on it on the internet. It's really easy to grasp if you play piano or even guitar or something, I'm not really a piano guy myself.\n\nEdit: To elaborate on this point, chords are constructed from a scale, which is what the *key* is referring to. Say if we are in C Major again, the C Major scale consists of these notes:\n\n    C D E F G A B (C)\n\nNow can assign scale degrees to these, which just tell us what position in the scale they have:\n\n    C D E F G A B (C)\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8/1 \n\nAll chords in C Major are constructed from these 7 notes. A simple chords is the triad, which is constructed of 3 notes: The root, the third and the fifth. So to make the first chord in C Major, we start on C, take the third, E and then the fifth, G. That makes a C Major chord. Now let's try it on D and we get the notes D F and A. Despite coming from the C Major scale, that makes a D minor chord! Now repeat for all scale degrees and you'll have all the chords of C Major. So finding the key is looking at all the notes in the chords and see what scale they fit into.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405884263", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Cata heroics were a joke in so many ways, frankly. This may require a bit of explaining.\n\nAnd let's get this out of the way: I've never had a problem completing Cata heroics when they were current, but I and my upper echleon raiding guild got tired of them within the first week after Cata's release.\n\nFor one thing, they made things 'hard' again by giving monsters the ability to instagib you or the tank if you screw up, which was okay to tedious. By 'okay', I mean that it was managable when the application actually fit tBC modes (most instagibs were telegraphed and easy to avoid, and all boiled down to positioning or the healer being on the ball, but more on that later), and by 'tedious', I mean when the game decided to lag or glitch or not work (You moved out of Corobus's AoE, or your healer is having slight frame problems? GUESS WHAT, YOU'RE DEAD!) OR the game the boss/encounter required CC or interrupts, but your party make-up doesn't have enough or the right CC to stop said things because Blizzard still couldn't decide if all classes needed these essential things (boss is enraging? If you don't have a druid, rogue, hunter in your non-guild PuG group, you're fuuuucked!).\n\nAnd let's not forget, Blizzard borked up classes and roles royally. In no particular order:\n\n* Overall they added so much stam and health to normal gear to compensate for burstiness in PvP because they were still trying to legitimize Arena as  [D I G I T A L S P O R T S](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/e/e3/Dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_05.mp3) (hint: it failed so laughably hard they're still trying to fix the damage they did in that particular instance of balancing *today*), with reasoning that it would help mitigate the high damage in PvE for everyone in PVE due to many (bad) healing changes. Because, as mentioned before, monsters would instagib and DID instagib far more frequently it didn't fucking matter how many hundreds of stamina you had in comparison to your ~300 or so actually good stats. You died and you died like the dog you were.\n\n* Oh the lovely stat inflation on secondary stats (Armor Penetration, Critical Strike rating, etc) because of those stamina changes, too. You went from reasonable, translatable numbers to hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of a particular stat for a fraction of a % increase in your stats, with it being infinitesimally smaller because the only stats that actually mattered were Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Spirit. In some cases things were so horribly balanced that items with higher secondary stats than base stats on slightly higher ilevel gear from heroics lowered your damage or overall healing.\n\n* Hell, while I'm on the subject of gear and the badness of Cataclysm heroics, Cataclysm heroics only gave out blues and blue-quality items. In tBC and Vanilla, bosses in max level content would have slight higher chances of giving alright purples statted for particular roles (dungeons sets and whatnot) that would last awhile, while end bosses in heroics in TBC would have a gurantee'd drop for epics as a sort of reward for sticking it out for the full duration. With Cataclysm, not *only* were you awarded shitty heroic-tier statted blues that would be upgraded the moment you set foot in a raid, but the specific blues were just slightly upgraded versions of said heroics 80-85 level gear. There was litterally no point in getting this gear because it was virtually *all the same* with 50 more of x stat (or 300 for what little that mattered as said earlier), and a metric ton of more stamina. AND because some of these heroics were already 84-85 in level, there was literally no semblance of an upgrade whatsoever.\n\n* The other, ulterior of doing heroics was also implimented badly, which was the Badges of Justice/Justice points ordeal. With Badges of Justice in tBC, they gave you badges/currency to buy slightly off purples from badge vendors in case you had trouble getting into raiding OR use it to buy things like resist gear, and in Wotlk that was upgraded/taken further to give perfectly serviceable off-gear that was good for the last tier of raiding for that patch (which people bitched out), both making sure that Justice at least had their uses. In Cata they took this system and made it so that you would have a cap on the total amount of Justice you could hold AS WELL AS making it so that you needed to hover around that cap to buy *anything* AS FUCKING WELL AS making it so that heroics didn't give a servicable amount of JP. In edition to everything else, anything and everything you needed to do for heroics was just meaningless.\n\nKeeping in mind, that's just the infrastructure-based nitpicks. The class related problems were faaaaaaaaaaaaar worse.\n\n* Tanks in Wotlk were overpowered in heroics for a number of reasons, of which being making it so that gear from the last tier was easier to obtain over the last last tier (this was a problem with all 3 roles). So in Cata they decided everyone should have Active Mitigation (basically, you press a button, you are now tanking, but without that button duration stuff *good luck son*). What they didn't forsee is that a tank can and will die to everything bosses will throw at them if they are, for some reason, stunned or silenced before they can cast their active mitagation. They also soak up so much more damage than even in tBC days that your disorganized pug would die and die often on trash, before getting to the boss that would have loot that basically useless. On top of this they made threat harder for tanks to generate, so mobs went wild because of lack of player threat utility.\n\n* Oh and healers, which is oddly only 1 of the 2 bad healing changes they made. Healers, due to overgearing, never really had to cast in heroics in wotlk (or tbc, depending on what you were) once you past that point of no return, so they aimed to fix that. So they upped the mana costs on everything and made Spirit more important, which was alright. But somehow someone at Blizzard was put in the out corner and had to take it out further on healers, so they decided to change every healing class and role to have the exact same spells as 1 of them (the Holy Priest, everyone having the HoT, the small heal, the big heal with a long cast time, and the big heal with a short cast time but costs 4x as much mana as the other big heal), varied only in their AoE heals (all of which ws nerfed heavily), and cut mana regen as well as making so that \"healer\" gear was heavy in said cut mana regen, but not in int for healing power or maximum mana. Healers went from \"usable\" or \"overpowered, but usable\" to \"I'm working just to keep the party alive no matter how easy the encounter is, and need to hold the party after every encounter because I ran out even with proper management.\" And if the healer was instagibbed, because Blizzard also weakened their personal protection by a ludicrous amount, the party was doomed.\n\n* The OTHER healing change is that gave every class in the game a way to heal themselves, but made it so that every class in the game had to RELY on said self healing (and the insane nerfs to healers for PvE content was made to reflect this gating). The problem with THAT is that most self healing required a class resource that wasn't always readily available, or required someone like DPS or tanks to stop dps or tanking. The healing effectiveness per class was variable, and it lead to things like Rogues outhealing the entire party because their self healing, because it worked on a % and had 100% uptime. Due to \"wanting people to conserve mana\", too, if you were a class that used mana at the time you were SoL.\n\n* As mentioned before, they also tried to make utility used more in heroics (like interrupts and CC) without actually giving all classes said interrupts, cc, or even threat reduction, and actually nerfing or removing most classes (even healers!) ability to cleanse most status effects. Blizzard forced CC usage on groups that could seldom use CC (and with inconsistent cooldowns, Mage poly having non and retpally repentance and shammy hex being on 1 minute cooldowns, even if they \"miss\"), status effects on groups that probably could deal with instagibbing dots because they were an effect the healer could no longer dispel (and if they could, it has a 15 second cooldown now so the person who's not the tank or healer is fucked if 2 more get it, or the party is doomed if the tank AND the healer get it), and interrupts on groups with 20 or 30 second interrupt cooldowns between them with no way to coordinate how to use them in game (I was in a guild I was in a vent server, and even then lag would almost cost everything at times).\n\n* DPS was changed to tBC levels of inconsistency, which annoyed almost everyone. Our Warlock was pulling 20k in all blues while everyone else was struggling to keep up or pass 15k. AoE damage also got nerfed (with high enough ear in wotlk you could zerg passed groups while spamming AoE, but again: with strong enough gear), so encounters that had legitimate AoE would be needlessly problematic no matter how many much we could do.\n\nAnd [Blizzard's official response to all this bad design](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2053469)? Lolgetbetter. Even if we were the cutting edge raiders, even if had evidence supporting that this shit was legitimately awful.\n\nAnd then when they realized they they had lost almost a mill sub to this nonsense a weak later they nerfed *everything*, and then compensate for their bad class design changes by lowering the health of everything in heroics, giving tanks a 300% threat gen buff and added stamina buffs, heavily improved mana regen and healing effects across the board. [**THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE XD**](http://wowpedia.org/Patch_4.0.6).\n\nSo yeah...heroics in cata weren't hard. Just bad.

A mistake like that was made before and his eye had met with certain body part, of a very horny devil. It had not been pleasant. Looking back, it made him shudder, the situation had been even more unpleasant for the girl he was about to fu--   “Hrey, hrold it. Im hear “ Poof! Tiny angel had appeared on his shoulder, opposite to Tiny devil. Clearly… drunk? Could they do that? Are they allowed to do that?  \n\n\n“And as we can see—Alex are you even paying attention? “ It startled him, hearing his name in between the slurred words from tiny angel.   “Yes. Yes of course I am Steve. I was just deep thoughts on the matter. Do go on “   “Yhear, id like to go on. On. On his face “ Tiny angel pause. Looked over at Tiny devil, then up at Alex   “With my cock“ he added, and then burst out laughing, at his own joke. “As I was saying   “ Steve went on, pointing at the thin blue line “It’s clear that the marketing departments stunt… “   “Hrey. Hrey Devil “ Tiny angel was yelling, drowning out Steve “Youh, uh, youh wanna do it? “   “What!? “ Tiny devil reeled backwards, as if offended.   “Whell yhea, what the hell, ihm having an exsicsten… escisc... a crisis. Ihm drunk. I dhont whanna be a fucking vhirgin fhorever “ Tiny devil gave a short pause. No way, Alex thought. Please don’t accept, he thought harder. Praying that he had a psychic link to them, or something.   “Why the hell not “ Tiny devil said, unintentionally dismissing Alex’s silent prayer, as Tiny devil made his way across Alex’s neck. “So it’s my professional opinion that we must establish an intimate relationship with our customers, one based on mutual trust “Steve said, all the while the personified paradigms began making out, hardcore.   “We have to get down and dirty in this campaign. Work on hands and knees. Truly “ Steve held his breath, always with a flair for the dramatic pause.   Meanwhile Tiny devil had pushed Tiny angel to his knees “Rise to the occasion “ Steve finished, as Alex to his horror, saw Tiny devil sporting a massive erection.    “We’ve seen the slogan. We know the slogan. But it’s time to really start pounding it into the minds of our customer base, and even seek out clientele, we never knew we could reach   “ Alex found himself almost hypnotized by Tiny devils forceful rhythm. The diametrical oppositions moans of pleasure became indistinguishable from Steve’s ceaseless synergized droning. But still, Alex tried to act, as if nothing was wrong. “That way we can achieve even further ORGASM OH GOD IM ALMOST THERE but we must remember that FUCK ME HARDER YOU DEVIL UARGH so we can really SPREAD MY BUTTOCKS AND REACH DEEP YOU FUCKER or we might see this increase, turn into a SLAP ME HARD—“ Alex felt like fleeing. But it was almost like high school all over again, if he stood up, the whole room would see his boner. Tiny devil started pounding harder, which only made Tiny angel pleasure screams louder.   “Stop fucking around ” Alex slammed a fist into the table. And they all looked at him. Tiny angel, still with Tiny Devil inside of him. . Steve the jerk, Stella the hottie, Jake the scammer and Rick the boss. Oh no. It became too obvious he had said that out loud. Alexs eyes darted around. Oh god. This was it. He was done for.\nUnless…   “You all know what I’m talking about “ Alex started. No one knew what he was talking about. “Uh. Yes. Stop f u c k i n g around. We. Uh. All know that… “ He drew a blanks. Wait no. The Cogs in his head was working at high capacity. Actually this was perfect.   “We all know Jack has been stealing from the company, why nobody has said anything, is beyond me “\n\n\nLater, after two police officers escorted Jack out of the building, Alex sat in his office. “Are you guys finally done? “ For two hours he had been staring at the ceiling, trying to shout out all sound, stemming from the shoulder fucking.   “Well. Yhea. “ Tiny devil answered, exhaling cigerrate smoke. “By the way, nice save back there. Very well done “   “Fuck you “   “Technically we’re extensions of your personality, so you already did “ Tiny angel answered. “Fuck you too “ Alex said snapped back.   “Technically “ Tiny devil said “You already did “", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1405985640", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'm finally starting to get to use some of that knowledge from all those books I read.

For example, you would be able to count up the D string starting first fret going d sharp, e, f, f sharp, g exc. \n\nHowever for some reasons, notes B and E don't *technically* have sharps (don't ask me why). When I say technically, I mean that F is also E's sharp. Confusing right? Don't worry about that bit. All you probably need to know for now is that \"There don't BE no sharps\" meaning while playing guitar (as well as other instruments) B and E don't have sharps. \n\nSo to TL;DR your question, the fret in between F and G is F sharp, which is a half step between F and G.

Yet, with Destiny, I am finding that I rarely get about 3.0, usually I am in the low to mid 2's, or even less.  Here are some simple tips to get you started, things that you should be aware of while playing ANY shooter.  Hopefully these will get you started so you can learn the ropes.\n\n* 1) **Put emphasis on \"Wins\" over \"Stats\".**  This is a fundamental mindset that you must get into and truly champion to get better at the game.  Your statistics simply do not matter.  When you shift the mentality to, \"How do I win?\" from \"How do I increase my statistics?\", you will find that you start to play objectives more intelligently, and you have a heightened awareness of what is happening and what needs to happen.\n\n* 2) **Find a team to play with.** Playing cooperatively with others will help you build communication skills in-game and also teach you the fundamentals of strategy in the game.  Where are the hot-routes, where are vantage points, where is the quickest route to the point, and where are the least traveled areas?  Having a smart and strategically oriented team can do numbers on the enemy.  If you play with others that are better than you, you will adapt and get better as well.\n\n* 3) **When playing, focus on \"What would I do if I was the enemy?\"** When you start thinking ahead of the enemy, you will be ready to stop them. It won't take much mental preparedness to set yourself ahead. If you are capturing an objective, don't be afraid to step out of it if you feel like enemies are incoming.  Rather than let them know EXACTLY where you are standing, take a quick vantage point, confuse them and wipe them out!\n\n* 4) **Be prepared.**  Store an arsenal of weapons, keep a wide variety of tools at your disposal.  Snipers are nearly useless on Shores of Time but will be your best friend on First Light.  Take advantage of your situational awareness and defend corridors, or doors.  If you know a door is the pathway for enemies to get to you, take some cover and dig deep with your sights lined up.  So many battles are lost to \"who drew their sites up first\".\n\n* 5) **Be patient and play conservatively.**  This is a strategy that I used A L O T when I was first learning how to play competitively in shooters. Playing defensively is a skill that everyone should learn first. The less you need to move, the better.  When you are moving, you are an animation in a still sea of architecture. You are easy to spot, easy to predict, easy to defeat.  Be patient, instead, let your enemies come to you. There will ALWAYS be people on your team who are playing aggressively for objectives, but there is a fine art to playing effective defense.  You can be just as effective as attackers on your team by getting defensive kills and keeping objectives under your control.\n\n* 6) **Don't be predictable.**  Being predictable is your worst enemy. If you are always in the same area, always doing the same thing, or always using the same weapon, you will be nothing but an easy killstreak for a skilled player.  When skilled players get into a match, they are closely watching what players are doing, what their reactions are, what their playstyles are. I keep a mental log of who is doing what and how they play in my head during a match, and I adapt my strategies to that.  If you are sitting in the same area, doing the same thing, being predictable as a rock in the sun, I will make you pay for it.  Don't make yourself an easy kill!\n\nHope this all helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406049936", "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi. I was the Lead Artist on this and did some level design. I would like to apologize for the 'Can't Wait to Be King' level. I actually didn't do any work on that level, but it has quite the history. The monkey puzzles started out a lot harder and were made simpler. But then there was talk of making it so you couldn't die on that level. Making it a just for fun, puzzle level and I thought that was a stupid idea and campaigned heavily against it. In retrospect I was wrong, that would have been more fun. Also, we never could figure out why, on that level only, sometimes you wouldn't make jumps it looked like you should have. The programmers went to extraordinary lengths to figure it out and even made the mechanism that detected if you caught the edge much more robust, but still messes up.\n\nIf you don't know the code to get to the cheat menu are the names of the two lead programmers. Barry did the SNES version so go to the options menu and type B A R R Y. For the Sega Genesis the lead programmer was Rob, but being from the UK he hated the way us yanks pronounced his name. He claimed we made it sound more like RAAB, which is the cheat code R A A B.\n\nAlthough I did work on just about everything, the stuff that I primary created were all the the titles, menus and UI, Pride Lands, Elephant Graveyard, Simba's Exile and the Pride Rock. \n\nTrivia: James Earl Jones returned to record the line... wait no that's not right. I was gonna say that he re-recorded the line \"Everything the light touches is our kingdom\" to \"your kingdom\" as we had moved that bit to after Mufasa had died. But I just watched a play thru video and it comes right after Pride Lands and is \"our kingdom.\"  Was it another line we change? I know there was something because it was a big deal that James Earl Jones, the most expensive voice actor in Hollywood at the time, came back and did it for free.\n\nOkay, here is another one. The Bug Toss bonus game (Yes, a Kaboom clone. We were all old school gamers.) We only had 6 months to do the game to make it out in time for the movie's release. This meant starting before the contract was officially signed as it had to go back and forth to lawyers and such and the process takes quite awhile. Disney really wasn't supposed to give us anything until the contract was done, but everybody realized that we had to start ASAP so they did what they could. We got a cassette tape of music that included some other things that were pretty cool such as the Electric Street Parade music (which was available anywhere back then, but you can get now) and early Aladdin music before they completely changed the story. It was Aladdin and his brothers and lots of stuff about high Adventure. Anyway, they also gave us composite cards with stills from the movie. One of them was the background we used for the Bug Toss game. If you watch the movie you'll notice that it is actually the root that Pumba gets stuck under when Nala is chasing him.  Disney was worried that people would notice this and it would be confusing. We explained that nobody would care.\n\nEdit: Obligatory thanks for the gold edit.

{"body": "no problem man, I was actually in your same boat. I started playing guitar in 2010 and ended up at berklee in 2012. I've never met anyone here who's only been playing a few years like me, but granted i absolutely became IMMERSED in guitar and played all day every day, unemployed and uninterrupted from the time i started to my application and audition. I would say i picked it up abnormally quickly, but that just goes to show if you're good you're good, years experience doesn't matter too much and the metronome is ALWAYS your best friend. love the metronome. and dont doubt yourself either, practice hard and give it a shot no matter what if thats what you wanna do, can't hurt. \n\nAs for scales, wether you go to music school or not, as a player you should introduce yourself to the concept of modes, and then way later modal music.\n\nI don't know how advanced your music knowledge is but just in case im going to try and explain things as if you don't. I'm sure you know \"major\" and \"minor\", but it kinda breaks down into each MAJOR key has it's own \"Relative minor\" key which is really just the same MAJOR scale starting on the sixth note in it, or the sixth degree.\n\nThat's where the concept of key signatures is important, because there are sharp and flat notes in different keys.\n\nC major - C D E F G A B C | A minor A-B-C-D-E-F-G. \n\nA Major - A B C# D E F# G# A | F# minor F#-G#-A-B-C#-D-E-F#\n\nI show you this to solidify the idea that by starting on the sixth note, you're changing the scales formula thus giving it a different sound, but you're using the same notes as in the parent key, not just continuing letters. The Key signature of A Maj/F# minor has 3 sharps, F# C# and G#, while C major and A minor have none. A is the \"relative minor\" or \"Aeolian mode\" of C maj. F# minor is the Relative minor to A Major, and so on. But that brings me to the next part. \n\nThere are seven of these modes. One for each degree of the scale, all using the same notes contained in the parent major scale. I'll use the key of C to show you.\n\nC- Ionian mode (1st degree, just the major scale you know and love.)\nD - Dorian mode (2nd degree)\nE - Phrygian mode (3rd)\nF - Lydian mode (4th)\nG - Mixolydian mode (5th) \nA - Aeolian mode (6th, also known as relative minor)\nB - Locrian Mode (7th)\n\nSo just to make sure you understand, G# locrian scale in the key of A Major would be G#-A-B-C#-E-F#-G# (see above)\n\nPoint being, learn these. For serious. And try to learn to play them as many ways as you can if you wanna play lead guitar, like three notes per string, connecting at the octaves so you can play three octaves of each, etc. \n\nBut as for parent scales or whatever, Theres major modes, theres Harmonic minor modes, and melodic minor modes. same concept, just different starting formula. theres more sets of these, but these are the ones i use the most and i believe to be the most common. \n\nI hope that helps a little bit, im a little baked so im sorry if it doesnt make sense. I know that concept was weird wrapping my head around early on trying to teach myself. maybe it saved you or someone else some trouble. \n\nAs for tuition, fuck man it's not pretty. somewhere in the $36,000 range. but there is financial aid programs and all kinds of scholarships.

{"body": "* Hi mate. He is using ascii characters in his name. You can enter them manually using alt+199 which gives you Ã, and alt+251 which gives you ¹ - you have to type the number pretty quickly on your numpad whilst holding down alt. So to type his Hacker2 name, in the TA console you would type alt+199 alt+251 H a c k e r 2 alt+199 alt+251 and you should then see Ã¹Hacker2Ã¹ on your screen.\n \n* He is also abusing the font in TA, where O &amp; 0 look very similar.\n \n* The only time the special characters are shown properly in Tribes is on the end of match scoreboard, and within the console if he talks or uses voice commands. They will just appear as squares on the mid-game scoreboard. He is getting smarter now though and trying not to talk, and he is leaving matches just before the end so he is not on the scoreboard. I do not know any console commands where you can see a list of players in the server in the console instead of the scoreboard - I am not sure TA has one.\n \n* He also, so far, has only used those 2 special characters. He may start using others in the future. If he does, all you need to do is make a note of the special characters and google the codes for them. I have created a text file on my desktop with his recent names in so if he joins again I can just copy+paste them into the console when using the kick vote command. I found this list helpful:  http://www.theasciicode.com.ar\n \n* Hope this helps.\n \n* Cheers\n\nI should also note his name appears with the ascii codes in the server browser when checking which players are in a server.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406219108", "subreddit": "Tribes", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Think about one moment, not against C9, which had broken a game, in which you would have acted differently. E.g., in group stage, when you realize that you've made a mistake. What would you change?**\n\nOh, I'd change a lot! I'm always up for aggression. pushing. I think, that in my team has the best players for each role. So, we can play any heroes, So, why don't we push all the three lines? Then just snowball and exterminate them everywhere we can. I don't why we don't play so, I would like to perform such style. \n\n**So, you agree that aggressive dota dominated this tournament? And you didn't adapt though it's your origin style.**\n\nI didn't say aggressive, I said early aggression with lane domination in order to guarantee easy pressure, push. Yes, partially it's our dota, but be also took some ideas from EG and DK. I still consider them as two strongest teams at the tournament. However, they placed 3rd and 4th, so, my mistake. Or, just coincidence of some facts. Simply coincidence.\n\n**Okay. Top-8 is 5 Chinese teams, 2 American and 1 European, I guess. Does it mean that Euro scene is far behind Chinese? Or just bad luck?**\n\nIt's hard to say. I wouldn't say that European or Chinese scene is behind. That all depends on many factors. Europe trains with Europe, China - with China. hey progress with different speed and in different directions. Something like this. \n\n**Okay. In the beginning of this interview you said \"players were\". I mean...Will it be a roster changes? How do you think, do you need changes to... **\n\nWhat do you mean \"players were\"? \n\n**You said one phrase. You answered \"There w e r e good players in my team\". I meant, for that moment.**\n\nYes, I got it, but...\n\n**continuing this topic: does team need changes?**\n\nYes, tough question. But to be honest... \n\n**Why so compromising? C'mon. I can tell you what kind of info is out there, about roster and stuff. Of course, you decide it and so, however, the reasons are. How do you think... can this roster live or it needs fresh blood? Maybe, you want to play with someone new, maybe, you're tired on international communication, maybe, you want to speak Russian all the time?**\n\nI'm not bored. But people get tired of each other, it's okay when you close for a long time, even live together. So, the atmosphere is not the best, especially when you don't reach expected results.So you either come to a conclusion or depart. In our case - I don't know yet. It's hard to play in such atmosphere, we don't understand each other, don't listen to each other. We don't have the same unity as 1,5 year ago, I guess. So, it's complicated, I don't know what to answer.\n\n**Okay, I won't be torturing you, official announcements will show everything. So, just few questions.**\n\nYou said it's hard to win in American pub. Tell us why, is the level that high? I think, American pubs have lower skill than Europeans and that's why it's hard to win. If you have high raking and you come to America, play with them, it rarely gives you players with high raking. Or it's just a few of them. So, you have to play with guys with low raking. I feel like 5000 raking here is like 4000 in Europe. Maybe, it's my mistake, however. So, it's hard and not interesting, at least, for me. It's impossibru to win, it puts 4500-4600 in your team.\n\n**And you?**\n\n6200-6300. And guys against you are 5200, 4800. And it's random. Ranking or not, people play differently. E.g., guy with 4700 is worse than 4300. Or worse in this particular game or so. Dota-ranking doesn't show anything. But players are pretty weak and it's difficult to play. If you don't play a hero that can win alone, you depend on your team, which means, on random. \n\n**Okay. 7-8 and 9-10 places, pretty big gap in prizes, 450 thousand. Of course, you'd be more upset if you finished lower. Do you agree with such distribution and in general, what about this TI's format?**\n\nFormat? What do you mean?\n\n**Holding system. One group, so many games, docking matches, such play-off?**\n\nI like more TI2 and TI3 format. Two groups, more teams go to winner's bracket. And you don't go to grand final after two games, at least three. More intrigue, struggling. NewBees had to wait two days for grand final. It's not cool that on first day the whole upper bracket was over. It's not good for viewers. And for players... well, for NewBee it's okay. And the difference between top-8 and top-9 - it's okay. I don't see any bad thing about it. It's nice for 9-14 to get at least some money. Plus, they get a lot of sweet memories, travelling and so on. The International gives you unforgettable impressions. The little difference between top-8 and top-6 is fine for me too. And at all, between 3-4-5-6-7-8 difference is not that big. But it's hard to tell, cuz when you're in top-4 - it's very cool. Big gap between top-2 and top-1. I'd shoot myself if I placed top-2, really. It is hard to realize how close you were, but you lost. I enjoyed my prize for 8th place, actually. \n\n**Okay, about you personally, two more questions. How do you like this TI? A lot of people, fans. Did you have some free time or everyone is trying to catch you?**\n\nNo, I had almost no free time, only during the group stage. That was the best time. All players together in hotel, almost on the same floor. We just walk, talk, - We had our own computer club. - Incubator-gaming. We played ping-pong, kicker, watched some shows and so on, nice atmosphere, we had a nice time there. No one bothers you. But then... When we moved to Westin Seattle, at Key Arena, that was very hard. Everyone stops you, they want something from you. You get exhausted. Wake up at 6, move on at 7, the whole day you move, come back at 9-10. You have to fall asleep and the next day everything repeats. So, as players we... Well, for me it was hard to enjoy this tournament as much as group stage. Everyone wants something from you all the time! \n\n**How many e-signatures did you give?**\n\nAlmost all, very quickly.\n\n**How many in total?**\n\n1000, if you believe rumors. Maybe more. But they were flying. If there are 17k people in Arena, 1000 is not that much, actually. And some players want something from you. And some Olegs (interviewer's name) too.  Someone promised 50 signatures for Olegs - Name Olegs... So, if those signatures aren't played on Na'Vi's resources, you know, whom to blame. Everyone thinks the same, just want to take... - \n\n**But you promised, promised us!**\n\nYou promised ZeroGravity\n\n**How do you want to rest? I know that family came to you here, that you'll stay in America for a bit.What are your plans for America and later, what are you going to do?**\n\nI fought with Goblak.  \n\n**I see it.**\n\nYou haven't seen Goblak. Goblak is a special guy. I said to him, \"You are a green Humpty-Dumpty\", and he got mad and threw my card at me. \n\n**It was card?**\n\nRight here. Luckily, not in the eye! I said to him \"Nice shot!\". The next day, I decided to start a fight. I said, \"You are an awful green Humpty-Dumpty\". And he punched me, right here. \n\n**Did you hit him back?**\n\nI almost did. \n\n**Couldn't jump that high?**\n\nI locked him in the toilet.\n\n**Okay...**\n\nThat was tough. I'll go around the America, but for a few days I stay here, in Seattle. I don't know where exactly, but yes, my family stays here and we're going to have a rest. \n\n**The last question. Goblak. I wanted to ask you, was his analytic convenient for you to get and was it useful?**\n\nI'm thankful to him, he helped us a lot. We could have not reach even 8th place without him. He knows dota as back of his hand. He has a lot of knowledge, experience, he could gave all the info about our mistakes right after the game. Constructive critique, without personal attachments. He could tell anything to everyone. That helped us a lot, though I have a feeling that Clement wasn't listening to him at all. He agreed on some things but then he did them his way. So we can't blame Arthur in our fails. He's done his best, so, I'm really thankful to him. \n\n**Would you like him to continue to be Na'Vi's coach? Or analytik?**\n\nOf course, it's nice to have a guys who helps you, but we need to listen to him, actually. Not just look at him. But he's not likely to agree, he wants to play. He wants to come at TI5 and win. Okay, I guess, we should finish now. \n\n**Last words, shoutouts to all your fans who couldn't make it to Key Arena. Something for them.**\n\nShoutout to everyone, thanks for your support, I'm surprised, I thought, people would flame in the internets about our loss.\n\n**They did.**\n\nI don't know, in my VK or Twitter I had only positive, 90% positive messages. It was really nice to read such supportive messages. I even wanted to go home and start training again! So I'm thankful, it's very sweet, support us. We'll try to please you with our further results.\n\n**We'll hope. Thank you for an interview, it was Dendi.

{"body": "Basically my friend, it's about the thought of \"Jihad\". If you dig Islam's history and go deeper, you'll see that in the beginning; muslims were soft, and tolerated against any kind of people. But as time goes by, people want to spread Islam because of the Prophet Mohammad's Last Words. But people forget that Mohammad just made a call and he attracted attention and converted them into Islam. So, easily I can say that it is about characteristic features. I am muslim too but i have some kind of secular side which, i don't care about people, their thoughts, beliefs or rituals, but most of my people, Turkish, can't get any critics positively even if they are positively. They get these as an insult. \nAbout ISIS; totally a terrorist organisation shows sect cleansing and jihad as their goals and kill people. Unfortunately this region is a fucking swamp and it is hard to expect someone good, someone who can change the world by discussions and negotiations. If you compare European or American muslims with Turkish muslims, you'll see that Turkish muslims are way more protective than any other as i mentioned before \"Characteristic features\". \nSome other \"sub causes\" might be the sayings in Quran (or words of Mohammad not sure). Quran says (or Mohammad not sure) that \"Apocalypse won't happen until the Islam rules the world A G A I N.\" And Islam says that \"This world is just an illusion, only the afterlife is eternal.\" So hardcore muslims and most of the sufis prefer dying than living. But what happens when you die? You will sleep until the apocalypse. This might be a cause.\nAnd another one is rise of the antisemitic waves through the Islamic world. I hope it is enough \nTLDR; Jihad, characteristic features, geography and historical events and also the wrong exposition of people.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406299664", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I do this sort of thing in SuperCollider for fun, and have drawn a lot of inspiration from Andrew Sorensen. I'm aware that some of his performances are more pre-prepared than others, but it is completely possible to improvise this way, and it's really not all that complicated. A scale can be defined by a list of seven numbers. An arpeggio can be defined by under ten, as can a chord progression.\n\nIt only takes a few lines of SuperCollider/Overtone/Extempore/Impromptu/JavaScript code to combine those intelligently and have an instrument or two play them.\n\nWant to generate a sequence of MIDI notes that represents triad arpeggios over an infinite series of descending 5ths in C major?\n\n&gt;midiNote=[0,2,4,5,7,9,11][((beat/4).asInteger*3)%7]+[0,2,4,5,7,9,11][[2,0,4,0][beat%4]];beat+=1;\n\nThis becomes: E C G C A F C F D B F B G E B E etc...\n\nYou could then write...\n\n&gt;while(midiNote&lt;desiredNote) midiNote += 12;\n\n...to invert the arpeggio on-the-fly to center itself around a note value in a particular register. You could even set desiredNote with a controller to physically control melodic contour.\n\nFrom what I've seen, Andrew Sorensen's live coding is, for the most part, a pretty straightforward programmatic expression of the same kind of music theory concepts used by musicians to write/embellish chord progressions and/or improvise over them.\n\nYou might be interested to know that Andrew Sorensen has stated that he practices his live coding on a regular basis by improvising over other musicians' recorded music. I try to stay up to date on what he's up to because (IMO) he is easily the most talented musician/programmer doing this sort of thing. I often find myself disappointed by \"live\" computer-music acts, (either by their lack of authenticity, quality, or both) but as far as I can tell, he's the real deal. He is also the author of both [Extempore](http://extempore.moso.com.au/) and [Impromptu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au/links.html), which are similar to SuperCollider.

The \"unfixable paying gap\" can be fixed if women were more open to choosing other jobs. It is completely illegal for a woman to be paid less than a man who has the same exact job as her.

{"body": "The other explanations of this are great; I'll explain it my way just in case. This is really important fundamental stuff to theory, so make sure you understand it 100% and ask lots of questions! We love questions here ;)\n\nLooking back I went a little overboard, but there's plenty of good stuff to learn from it!\n\nHere's my attempt at an explanation of all the things you need to know to answer your question. First, there are major and minor versions of scales and chords(among others, but we don't need those right now.)\n\nThe C scale you're thinking about is the C Major scale.\n\n It has the notes C D E F G A B C.\n\nIt *does* have a D chord in it, but not the D Major chord(Which is the one you're thinking about D F# A.) It has the D Minor chord, which is D F A. Notice how the F# was lowered a half step to make it F Natural.\n\nEvery(with exceptions, which we won't get into) chord has a root, a third and a fifth. We get these notes from the scale. For instance, the C Major chord has the root(1) the third and the fifth of the C Major scale.\n\n[C] D [E] F [G] A B. Chord tones are highlighted.\n\nHere's the same for D Major.\n\n[D] E [F#] G [A] B C#. \n\nNow, what if we build a chord on D, but we use the C major scale instead?\n\nC [D] E [F] G [A] B C\n\nWe get that D minor chord we talked about earlier. Notice that the only difference between the major chord and the minor chord is that the third is lowered a half step from major to make it minor. This holds true for all chords!\n\nC major: C E G\nC Minor: C Eb G\n\nBb Major: Bb D F\nBb Minor Bb Db F\n\nA Major: A C# E\nA Minor: A C E\n\nNotice that we don't just add a flat, we lower the note a half step. So if you have a sharp, like in the A major chord, then the note becomes natural.\n\nLike the others have described below, we can make chords off of every note in a scale!\nBecause CrownStarr already did it in C, I'll do it in F Major\n\nF Major F A C\nG Minor G Bb D\nA Minor A C E\nBb Major Bb D F\nC Major C E G\nD Minor F A C\nE Diminished E G Bb\n\nNow if you look at the one in F and the one in C, you'll notice that the same positions in the scale have same quality!\nSo, we can make some statements from this. Also, before I go on, typically we describe chords with roman numerals. Some people aren't familiar with these, so I'll list the ones we use, 1 - 7.\nI or i\nII or ii\nIII or iii\nIV or iv\nV or v\nVI or vi\nVII or vii\n\nCapitalization is determined by the chord quality. Major or Augmented(adds a plus) = capital. Minor or Diminished(adds a circle) = lower case\n\nAugmented looks like this III+. Diminished looks like this viio.\nNow, back from that tangent, we're making a statement about chord qualities of the major scale. These will apply to all 12 of our major scales!\n\nThe I chord is always major\nThe ii chord is always minor\nThe iii chord is always minor\nThe IV chord is always major\nThe V chord is always major\nThe vi chord is always minor\nThe viio chord is always diminished.\n\nNote that this only applies to major scales. We can also do the same thing to minor, but we'll save that for another day.\n\nSo to answer your question, no, D Major doesn't fit in C Major.\n\nHowever, we can make it fit by altering the C Major scale. This is a little out of the scope of this post, but I'll go over it quickly just for fun.\n\nIf we just throw out the F Natural in the C major scale and replace it with an F#, we've altered the scale. So now the scale is C D E F# G A B C.\nAs a composer, you can just throw out notes if you want. However, most of the time, you'll get a sound you don't want. So let's justify this(because if you check out that scale it actually doesn't sound bad, there's a reason too!) What if we took a C scale and played it with the key signature of another scale? \n\nThis is called a Mode. Where we take a scale and start playing that scale on a note other than the first. But wait, didn't I just say that we were playing one scale with the key signature of another?\n\nCheck this out.\n\nIf we take our G Major Scale (G A B C D E F#) and start it on C instead of G, we get the scale that looks like this:\nC D E F# G A B C\n\nWhich is exactly the scale we want, C major, but with a D Major chord in it.\n\nWe took the 4th Mode of G and played that. It's called C Lydian mode.\n\nI'll stop there for now, to keep this from being an even bigger wall of text, but if you want to know more about Modes, try googling \"Music modes.\"\n\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406499179", "subreddit": "askmusicians", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm gonna take a crack at explaining this outright to you!\n\nSo, a scale is just a collection of notes. We have different kinds of scales that have rules to them, but a scale itself is just a collection of notes. Essentially, we get keys from scales (or vice versa depending on how you look at it)\n\nFirst and most importantly, get a guitar scale sheet of the internet. That will help you so much. Seriously. This is the best piece of advice you WILL EVER RECEIVE IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR LIFE. A scale sheet makes life easy ;)\n\nAlso, learn to read notes. Only learning from tabs is like trying to learn to speak a language without being able to read it. You can only get so far that way ;)\n\nThe scale sheet should list out the notes of all 12 major scales for you. Extras are nice, but as long as the scale sheet has all 12 major scales, it's good.\n\nSo anyways, back to the whole explanation thing.\n\nLet's look at a major scale. C Major because it's easy.\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nIf we look at the intervals between notes it's\nW W H W W W H\nW = Whole Step(2 half steps) H = Half Step\n\nNow let's look at another scale like F Major\n\nF G A Bb C D E F\n\nLook at the intervals again. It's\nW W H W W W H\nThe same intervals as C major! So you see where I'm going with this!\n\nEach major scale is constructed by starting on a note and then executing that pattern of intervals.\n\nNow, how do we get key signatures from that? It's really simple!\n\nJust look at your scale and figure out what it's got in it.\n\nC major has no sharps or flats, so it's key signature is empty!\n\nF major has one flat(Bb) so it's got one flat in it's key signature.\n\nNow if you look at your scale sheet for a while, you'll notice that flat's and sharps always appear in a certain order.\n\nFor instance(With exceptions we won't talk about right now) You'll never see and Eb without a Bb coming before it. It works the same with sharps. You'll never see a C# without and F# before it!\n\nSo, we have this magical little tool called BEADGCF. It gives us the order of Flats and Sharps. Write down BEADGCF on your scale sheet. Then on your mirror. Put a notification in your phone to pop up every 15 minutes for the next 2 months with BEADGCF in bold letters. It's important;)\n\nRead it forward and it's the order of Flats. Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb.\n\nSo, to have a key with an Ab in it, you need a Bb and an Eb as well.\n\nRead it backwards and it's the order of Sharps.\n\nF# C# G# D# A# E# B#\n\nSo to have a key with E#, you'll need F#, C#, G#, D#, and A# to come before it!\n\nNow that's handy by itself, but it doesn't stop there. BEADGCF also helps us name keys.\n\nHere are two rules:\n\nThe second to last flat names the key. \n\nA half step above the last sharp names the key.\n\nMemorize those.\n\n So if you have a key with Bb, Eb, and Ab, it would be named Eb because the second to last flat names the key.\n\nIf you have a key with F#, and C#, it's called D because a half step above C# is D.\n\nThere are two exceptions F, which is the key with one flat and C, which has neither.\n\nIf you use your scale sheet enough, this stuff will become second nature.\n\nSo, we've related keys and (major)scales. Every scale has a key which determines what notes go into the scale (Bb as apposed to B Natural for example.)\n\nNow for the chord scale part, I actually already posted another similarly sized text wall [here that explains that well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askmusicians/comments/2bos0n/scales_vs_chords_with_notes_outside_of_the_scale/cj9grbh)\n\nDon't forget to ask question if you need clarification!

You can't sail by safely anymore, and if you make it into next week, you need to bring the same energy you brought into this with you. None of that Rainbow Connection bullshit. 8/10, some good moments but you are using jump cuts, this should be *faster*\n* **Gemini**: ~~Thank god, the inflated red wig isn't fuckin here~~ I'm glad last week wasn't a false flag towards your improvement. It's not the so much so much that we've normally seen from you, but hell, if you're doing it right you don't need so much so much. The thing is, you're still a little behind in motion and relative unstiffness to your competitors, and we're nearing the point where if people can't bring it at the same levels consistently, they're gone. I know you have more in you, and I know that you're building towards it. I want to see you move forward, partially to piss others off because I enjoy human misery, and partially because I know you're talented as hell. 6/10, go into the tinychat sometimes, it is sooooo much easier to emotionally destroy people once you know what's going on in their lives.\n* **Dor**: ~~Because when you can't succeed as yourself, be someone else~~ I'm so so glad we have someone impersonating UEH. I'm upset you were the only impression of a season one contestant, but beggars can't really be choosers. The thing is though, the arms and mouth got a little sloppy at times, which pushed it over the edge from a good impression to a great impression (#Shablablabla), but I think that's also going to get you in trouble from voters this week, who may or may not know what a UEH is or what it tastes like (grapes). It may have been an intentional stylistic thing, but being off like that intentionally is a bit of a gamble, especially at this point where you're either the best or the worst out of everyone. 7.5/10, and you were worried you'd be terrible at this.\n* **Harper**: ~~Harper, you can't be a princess, princesses are virgins~~ So we've got our ~Technological Woman~ (sorry Erika) gunning for the title. The synch was a little off on my video, but I'm assuming that's indirectly the fault of all the hoops you jumped through for the birds. Could have been more visibly strained on the high notes, but you're everyone's favorite bad girl princess with an entirely custom look and this was a great entry. 8.5/10, funny and super cute, which I'm sure is the first time someone's described you with those words.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406525617", "subreddit": "LSFYL", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let me preface this by saying that I am a plat V Aatrox Main (Jungle), so what im saying may not work at higher skill levels.\n\nHere is my lolking: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/39296916\nMy ign is : ExHamster\nAdd me if you want any in game help, although im on vacation until the 13th Aug, so I wont be able to play until then.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nHere is the most important thing about Aatrox: He has absolutely terrible base stats for a fighter, and only decent scaling, so if you do not abuse his sustain and go too ham before you acquire sufficient items, you will get rekt very very hard. (I learned this the hard way, losing lane 3 times in a row to various top laners in GOLD II)\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nHis closest analogue champion is Xin Zhao, they both have slow, sustain on 3rd AA, AA speed ups, and a knock up, and are very apt at setting up ganks and tanking damage in team fights. However, you should NEVER play like a Xin; in lane, Xin straight up facerolls with his EWQ combo against most top laners, most of his DPS comes from his monstrous Q, and how effortlessly he sticks to his targets with his E; in the Jungle, Xin wants to do buff, small camp, buff and gank straight away due to his strong level 3. He alone can burst down a mid laner or a squishy top down to little more than half health from a single combo and he absolutely thrives in the early game, unless he fucks up or tanks a turret shot, there is no way for most junglers to even counter gank.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nAAtrox on the other hand, is kind of a bitch early game due to his extremely poor health pool. In lane, he HAS TO poke his opponent down before going on them, unless you get an early lv 2 of course, in that case, level QW and make sure you Q onto your opponent with a proc of W; in the Jungle, he wants to farm up until at least level 4 and with 2 points in W before he can put up a fight against most of the popular pool right now, if he gets counter ganked by like a pantheon or get caught by a lee, or elise, or udyr, or nocturne at level 3, he loses almost 100%.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nJungle:\n\n\n-- His clear speed is about the same as that of Xin's, not great, but faster than at least 30% of the pool. He makes that up by having infinite sustain so he has to back only when he wants to.\n\n-- His ganks are great, dont really get better after level 5, when he gets 2 points in E, but his counter gank early on is really bad unless against non-evelynn AP junglers.\n\n-- His dragon killing power is really bad, you cant just buy a pink and sneak it early like Nasus, Vi, Yi, Jax, WW, Fiddle, Nunu.etc At least a 70% HP support is needed to trade tank with you if you want to kill it before level 9 ish.\n\n-- His transition to late game though, is one of the best in the game, ill detail it below.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nRunes: AS RED, AR YELLOW, MR SCL BLUE, MS QUINT. (I prefer mid game oriented runes, AAtrox can be used to very aggressively gank right after double buff, but only safe versus weak ap junglers)\n\nMasteries : LOLKING me, its a page called ADJ\n\nSkills : W Q W E E R, then Max E, then W, then Q, taking points for R at 11 and 16. (the early second point in W almost doubles your sustain)\n\nJungle path: ALWAYS do Blue, Big Wraith, Wolves, Small Wraith, Golems, Red. DO NOT drink a pot before you kill the big lizzard, only drink your first pot after it dies. Gank after red.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nWhy this?\n\n1) it helps you avoid that awkward rush to top lane at level 3, which you would lose to most popular junglers. Tell your top to ward at 2 45.\n\n2) This way you can avoid getting red -&gt; red counter jungled effectively, even if you lose that red, your exp would not suffer too much either, and if you keep your red, you can get much more use out of it as almost everybody are most cautious at from 2 45 to 3 30 when most junglers make their first move and would play safe enough so that ganking is not worth it in alot of cases.\n\n3) A full clear gives the most exp possible, averts your weak early game where base health matters the most, and with your sustain, you can choose to stay in your jungle if you have a strong mid laner and get 6 before the second buff spawns. (a little taxing helps, 90% of the time you are able to either hold a lane for a wave or push a wave to T1 after you get a successful gank) This allows you to bully the enemy jungler/mid away, and or just kill them. Even though the Jungle has 1 shopping trip on you, the 2nd tier of jungle items are farm oriented and provide merger combat efficiency, between your passive and you having an ult on him, the fight is usually pretty 1 sided.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nItem Build:\n\n- Standard jg item 4 pot\n\n- Get razor first, then a pink. KEEP A PINK ON MAP AT ALL TIMES, NO EXCEPTIONS\n\n- Finish lantern, get tabi, buy sweeper. (Tabi over Merc unless enemy has no proper ADC or has 4 AP)\n\n- Buy either Sunfire or Banshees depending on the following: Sunfire if AD top **and or** STRONG AD JUNGLER, (Dont care if top is rumble, if you are going up against a Xin, get sunfire or get rekt at dragon fights and lose 1000 gold), otherwise get Banshees going against double or triple AP\n\n- Afterwards, if losing or even, get whatever you didnt get from the 2 items mentioned before, if winning, get the mini Hydra for 1900 gold. (Why not BORK? Because you are jungler and junglers are poor, the major power spike for Bork comes at 3200 GOLD when you *finish* the item, before that its just 3 taken item slots and a weak sauce slow, where as with Hydra, the power spike comes much cheaper and gives you more burst which is preferred as melee due to kiting issues) [MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS GET 1 TANK ITEM BEFORE MORE DAMAGE, I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, you need to itemize against at least 1 source or damage, or else by the point you reach \"oh fuck im squishy, it would be too late to build both\"]\n\n- Why not Randuins over Sunfire? a) Sunfire helps you farm faster. b) it looks cooler\n\n\n--------------\n\n\n\n\nokay i have to go to bed now, ill finish this guide if there is enough interest as it takes me a long time to type all of it out", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406560352", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

If a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; single sector fails on the hard-drive, how much will be lost?  Do the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; programs deal with read errors without crashing?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right now Attic will detect a checksum mismatch and abort. You will need\n&gt; &gt; to explicity --exclude the damaged files to continue beyond that point.\n&gt; &gt; fsck/repair functionality is at the top of my list for 0.11. But since\n&gt; &gt; Attic repositories contain no redundant information even a single bad\n&gt; &gt; sector will result in some data loss. Depending on the actual location a\n&gt; &gt; single file might be destroyed but it could also kill an entire archive\n&gt; &gt; or even the entire repository if you are extremely unlucky.\n\n&gt; My latest tests have revealed some bad behaviour.  I did the following:\n\n&gt; mkdir test-errors\ncd test-errors; touch a b c d e f g; cd ..\nattic init test-errors.attic\nattic create test-errors.attic::1 test-errors\ncp -a test-errors.attic corrupt.attic\nemacs corrupt.attic/data/0/2  [change last byte to X]\nattic list corrupt.attic\n\n&gt; When I ran the last command, attic *removed* the data file data/0/2.\nThat's the only data file in this case, but when I did a similar\ntest for a large repo with many files, attic removed *all* of the\ndata files when just one byte was changed in one file.\n\n&gt; The thing that really surprises me about this is that \"attic list\"\nshould be a read-only operation.  If there is some corruption, nothing\nshould be deleted unless the user explicitly initiates a repair of\nsome sort.  For example, the error could be transient, and you wouldn't\nwant an entire repo's data deleted because of this.\n\n&gt; I have attached my repos, but this has happened almost every time I\nhave tried changing a byte in any repo, so it shouldn't be hard to\nreproduce.\n\nIt's from February and there were no further responses in the thread.

{"body": "So, if you want a secure cipher, you should not be doing anything by hand, you should be using a computer. However, if you like using hand ciphers for whatever reason, then you should use something that is actually secure, not Vigenere. For extremely short messages with long keys, there are some hand ciphers that can still be reasonable secure, even against computer attack, because such short messages are below the \"unicity distance\" at which they would become crackable. The German [ADFGVX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher) is the most secure hand cipher I'm aware of. Today, it is crackable by computers, but it does require a fair amount of ciphertext. So, for very short messages with a long key, it's secure.\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to make a field cipher more secure. \n\n1) Drop all vowels except leading, lagging or other indispensable vowels: \"Drp all vwls excpt ldng lgging or othr indspnsble vwls.\" \n\n2) Use acroynms, codewords and other abbreviations and substitutions as much as possible. If you are a field agent of some kind, this should be second nature.\n\n3) Use some commonly-agreed upon book to provide key-material. Something widely available... Bible, travel guide, hotel guide, etc. Every 50 characters or so, change the key (the unicity distance of English text is as low as 28 characters). \n\nTo slightly increase the entropy of the key, use the first letter of each word, rather than every letter. &lt;-- \"tsiteotkutfloewrtel\". To increase the entropy a little bit more, rearrange the key as follows:\n\n    T S I T E O T K U \n    T F L O E W R T E\n\nThen the key becomes: TTSFILTOEEOWTRKTUE. After encrypting 50 characters, reseed your ADFGVX table and keep going.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a *lot* of work. But if for some reason you absolutely must encrypt messages by hand, the above method is effectively unbreakable - even using computerized methods - assuming you'll be sending a very small total amount of text.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406593751", "subreddit": "crypto", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Because J all functions are operators, and it is focused on being easy to write, it is harder to read:\n\na b c d e is a sentence that is not guaranteed to include any nouns (data).  If e is a noun, then d has to be a function, but it can be a verb, adverb or conjunction.  If d is a verb, then if c is a noun, it is an argument with e to d.  If d is a conjunction than both c and e are arguments, and both can be nouns or verbs, and the result of d can be any function or noun.  All of this needs to be determined before you can think of what b could be.\n\nNaming is super important as an aid, but the library doesn't do much except use caps for constants, settings and near-constants.\n\nFor a long program I would use Proper case for other nouns, but I dont remember the last time I did so.  Its more likely to use names as part of the data.  An exception is settings, often boolean.  I word these as isResult or allowBooleans.\n\nSome long descriptive verb names, I would use PascalCase, but most verbs and functions are all lower case.  Part of the reason, is that a candidate PascalCase verb might be just as easy to use as 2 verbs.  Modifiers (adverbs and conjunctions) I sometimes capitalize the last letter.\n\nAnother tool for telling what is what is whitespace.  Only nouns need distinguishing punctuation.  Use 1 space between verbs, and use either 0 (if allowed) or 2 spaces between modifier bindings (ie use 2 spaces after verb phrase that ends in adverb, or 2 spaces after right argument of conjunction.  If you turn conjunctions into adverbs by grouping the conjunction with its right argument with parens, then you can use the clearer 0 spaces to the rest of the verb phrase, and 1 space following it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406604351", "subreddit": "dailyprogrammer", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

[**Move notation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Move_notation) of article  [**Rubik's Cube**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's%20Cube): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Many 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by [David Singmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Singmaster) to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \"Singmaster notation\".  Its relative nature allows [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *F* (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n\n&gt;* *B* (Back): the side opposite the front\n\n&gt;* *U* (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n\n&gt;* *D* (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube\n\n&gt;* *L* (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n\n&gt;* *R* (Right): the side directly to the right of the front\n\n&gt;* *ƒ* (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *b* (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *u* (Up two layers) : the top side and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *d* (Down two layers) : the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *l* (Left two layers) : the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *r* (Right two layers) : the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *x* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *R*\n\n&gt;* *y* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *U*\n\n&gt;* *z* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *F*\n\n&gt;When a [prime symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol\\)) ( ′ ) follows a letter, it denotes a face turn counter-clockwise, while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. A letter followed by a 2 (occasionally a superscript ^2) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. *R* is right side clockwise, but *R'* is right side counter-clockwise. The letters *x*, *y*, and *z* are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When *x*, *y* or *z* are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees.\n\n&gt;The most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \"w\", for \"wide\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of *Rw* is equivalent to one of *r*. \n\n&gt;For methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods) there is a generally accepted \"MES\" extension to the notation where letters *M*, *E*, and *S* denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm. \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *M* (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)\n\n&gt;* *E* (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)\n\n&gt;* *S* (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F\n\n&gt;The 4×4×4 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (*F B U D L R*) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (*f b u d l r*) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parenthesis (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (*Rr*)' *l*2 *f*' means to turn the two rightmost layers counterclockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer counterclockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.\n\n&gt;An alternative notation, [Wolstenholme notation](http://www.topaccolades.com/notation/rubikscube.htm), is designed to make memorizing sequences of moves easier for novices. This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants. The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A and I for clockwise, counterclockwise and 180-degree turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU′R′UL′U′RU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Rubik, ^the ^Amazing ^Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik,_the_Amazing_Cube) ^| [^Rubik's ^Cube ^group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_group) ^| [^Optimal ^solutions ^for ^Rubik's ^Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_solutions_for_Rubik%27s_Cube) ^| [^Rubik's ^Cube ^in ^popular ^culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_in_popular_culture) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjbknaw) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cjbknaw)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406682474", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Go magic pen instead of Hybrid pen on certain champs like Fiddlesticks and sometimes Elise.\n\nFiddle's damage, sustain and clear mostly comes from Drain and Crows, so it's way better to go flat magic pen on him.\n\nI like to gank as soon as possible with Elise, so I run mag pen and AP quints to maximize the damage from the e q w r w q combo. This leaves you with a bit less sustain, but if you're using spiderlings to tank camps, that shouldn't be too much of a problem.\n\nIf the enemy team is kind of tanky, it's better to go hybrid on Elise because your combo probably won't kill people and you'll have to use AAs and your spiderlings. Spiderlings benefit from armour pen, so run hybrid when you're expecting longer teamfights.\n\nI don't play a ton of jungle, but I usually play WW, who runs hybrid pen (when maxing W, otherwise go with AS). Even though he deals primarily magic damage, his early clearing is reliant on the AS buff from his W, so having hybrid pen gives him faster clear time.\n\nFor seals, go armour or scaling armour depending on whether you're an early or late game jungler. e.g. Elise goes flat armour, WW goes scaling.\n\nFor blues, scaling MR is the best way to go because you won't be encountering much magic damage before they level out with flat MR glyphs. I've seen people use AP glyphs for extra damage on inherently tanky/drainy champs like WW and Fiddlesticks, but I find that this makes you too vulnerable to a powerful mid like Xerath or Fizz who rushed Haunting guise + Sorc shoes. You can also run 6-9 CDR glyphs for 5% CDR and a total of 8.75-11.22% CDR with masteries, but I also find that this leaves you pretty vulnerable unless you rush big MR.\n\nMarks, seals and glyphs tend to be pretty standard (pen, armour, mr), but I feel that jungle quints tend to be more based on the champion and your masteries. Generally, champs that need AP scaling run AP (Fiddleshits, Gragas), while champs who don't need AP run a variety of quints depending on the champ/masteries.\n\nFor example, Elise can run AP quints, or she can run mag/hybrid quints, or she can run Spellvamp quints, or she run movespeed quints. AP quints give her more damage if she rushes mag pen (sorc's, guise) while mag pen quints gives her more damage if she rushes SotSW. Spellvamp quints help her sustain in the jungle and when ganking from low health while move speed quints help her gank and move from camp to camp more efficiently.\n\nCompare that to WW, who should run either hybrid pen, AS or move speed quints; hybrid pen for maxing W, AS for maxing Q and movespeed against early-game junglers. \n\nWhen in doubt, Hybrid or AP quints are usually your best bet, as every AP jungler benefits from them.\n\nYou should check out www.probuilds.net and watch some streams to see what the pros use for specific champions and why; usually they'll give an explanation in stream if someone asks them why they do what they do.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406746012", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In grappling with the problem of evil in the world, St. Augustine suggested that:\n\n&gt;God judged it better to bring good out of evil than not to permit any evil to exist.\n\nAnd during Easter [**we say**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_culpa) \"O' happy fault that earned for us so great, so glorious a Redeemer\".  For by what seemed so great a tragedy--the \"Fall of Man\"--God brought forth riches beyond our wildest imagining.  \n\nThe greatest evil ever the Earth did see, greater than homicide or fratricide, greater even than regicide...*deicide*, whereby we crucified the Lord of Glory (cf. [**1 Corinthians 2:8**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+2%3A8-9&amp;version=RSVCE)), turned out to be the means  of our Redemption, according to which we could attain the glorious freedom of the children of God.\n\n     No eye has seen, nor ear heard,\n       nor the heart of man conceived,\n     what God has prepared for those who love him.\n\nAnd yet we must never ***do*** evil (or *plan* evil) that good may come. (cf. [**Romans 3:8**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+3%3A8&amp;version=RSVCE))\n\nFirst, [**because**](http://youtu.be/vrlTeoFcf-Q?t=37s) \"even the very wise cannot see all ends,\" but second--*and maybe more importantly*--because we who have *died* to sin can live no *longer* in sin. (cf. [**Romans 6**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206&amp;version=RSVCE))\n\nYou say that you *only* had self gain in view when the series of sins you committed culminated in the sin which worked to the benefit of someone you feel justly *deserved* it; and that said-benefit was an entirely unforeseen consequence of your [self-serving] actions.  \n\n&gt;hypothetically, if I had my time over again, I would repeat the sin(s) as it benefited someone deserving a lot more than it hurt others.\n\nI think if you had it to do over again, and if you had in view the happy consequence that resulted by accident the first time, the happy consequence wouldn't result.  \n\nThe first time through, you say you were acting self-interestedly.  You had your *own* ends in view, and you worked, I assume, to bring those ends about through your actions.\n\nHere's what I think.  \n\nI think if you had it to do over again, *knowing what you know now*, and you went ahead and did everything you did before, just so your one friend could benefit again in the same way...I think that friend wouldn't benefit.  I think circumstances would be *so changed* by your new intentions (to benefit that one person) that your actions would necessarily be changed.  You might even be directly responsible for *greater* evil than you had (perhaps somewhat innocently) done the first time around.  Because the second time there would *be* no deceiving yourself.  The evil you did would be intentional.\n\nSo I think you can be truly sorry for your sin/s, and truly sorry for the hurt you caused others, *and yet* be happy--g e n u i n e l y    h a p p y--for the *good* that God was able to bring about from the evil you intended.\n\n&gt;Truly sorry to hear about your apartment. Hope you are somewhere better now\n\nThank you.  Yes, I am.  That was a long time ago.  New Year's Eve 2004/2005, I think.\n\nI know exactly what you mean, though, when you say that you really didn't think the things you were doing were wrong--*or you were deceiving yourself*.  We can justify pretty much anything to ourselves when we're trying to get what we want.  \n\nI did some really horrible things in my life--things that I still regret.  Because after the fact, you know, after the whole thing had blown up in my face, when the drive to get the thing I wanted had faded into the background, everything I justified as necessary and deserved and *just*, was revealed in an entirely different light.  I just hurt so many people.  But I was always only just following my heart!  \"How could I do *otherwise*?\"  ;-)\n \nI could tell you the stories.  Suffice it to say, all but one involved sex.  The other one...power and creative control.\n\nI've since apologized, like a recovering alcoholic, to everyone (*almost* everyone) I hurt.  The one's I haven't contacted, I'm just afraid the sheer act of re-entering their lives to say \"I'm sorry\" would be more hurtful than just leaving it be.  Plus, they've got their own lives now.  And it's been a long time.\n\nI guess the best advice I could give you about that is, when you realize you've hurt someone, tell them you're sorry before life gets away from you.\n\nI misjudged you.  I guess that's a risk here on Reddit.  A lot of times I wonder what it'd be like if I actually had the opportunity to know some of the people I dialogue with in person.  And it's easy to forget that every single person in the world has to live their own life--no less significant to them as mine has been to me.\n\nI remember when I was about four year old, I realized in a very startling way that no one else would ever look at the world through my eyes.  And that I would never see \"me\" as everyone else sees me.  And that everyone else had the exact same experience of being \"themselves\" in a way that no one else can ever be.  \n\nAnd though I realized that over three *decades* ago, and even though I remember that moment as if it was yesterday, it's still a total mind trip to think about.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406773581", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Not only that, but yeah, you might be initially spending $200 less on your airfare by going with them. However, keep in mind, that NOTHING is free. You hear me? N O T H I N G. Carry on? $. Checked bag? $. WATER? $. Everything costs money - above what regular airlines cost. It might end up costing you more than the Lufthansa or whatever flight did in the first place. It's the Spirit/Ryanair story with a different name on it. Maybe a little better than Ryanair, but you get my point. Not to mention that Norweigan stranded an entire plane of passengers at LAX not too long ago for two days.\n\nMake sure you know what you'll have to spend before buying a ticket on Norweigan because paying $200 more up front might actually save you money.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406792061", "subreddit": "travel", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I can only speak for JoJo since that's the one I'm following.\n\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure starts off kinda like a period drama. Victorian Era, rich family, but due to circumstances an antagonist is introduced and accepted within the Joestar family who wants to take over their riches because he's dead set on that goal.\n\nHowever once the supernatural aspect kicks in its style really ramps up as a well becoming much, much more \"bizarre\" and disturbing for the sake of it. It becomes more centered around action, but the action is more composed of dramatic tension and character interactions.\n\nThe ultimate appeal of JoJo is it's ***style***, it makes the drama so overblown it becomes ridiculous within itself, yet is used effectively. Color pallet swaps, dramatic narrator, flamboyant seiyuu's shouting, the postures of the characters, the moving letters like \"S P O O K Y\" and \"M E N A C I N G\" add even more flavor this the dramatic action. Think of it as a satire of old school action with MANLY MEN DOING MANLY THINGS! Because JoJo is exactly that, it does it in such an overblown style, yet is very self aware and exploits it as best it can. Pure unadulterated entertainment, there's nothing deep and meaningful about it, it's, again, overly muscular men shouting and punching each other.\n\nThe first arc, Jonathan and all the other characters fight for their *honor* above all else. In the 2nd arc the stakes are raised by having our more anti-hero like protagonist Joseph \"saving the world\".\n\nIf you like battle shounen, this is among the best you can pick up.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406807858", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Hi, First 'reddit' post from me so go easy!  I would look at office 365 as an option, but depending on what you want to do with it and what server capacity you currently have and support, you could go for an on premise option using SharePoint Foundation (which is no additional charge over Windows Server).  Obviously, building environments using Standard and Enterprise versions, and adding Web Connectivity come at an extra cost.   \n\nAlthough not a comprehensive list, things to consider;\n\nWhat functionality will you be using (to dictate edition, significantly, cost!)\nWhat Hardware do you have (Windows 64 bit servers required, as well as SQL server recommended)\nWhat expertise do you have on site (and what capacity do they have to support SharePoint)\nMost importantly, overall IT strategy.  As stated in the post, SharePoint is a huge product, so is there scope to get additional benefits from your implementation?\n\nAssume your prices are from a vendor?  Or have you brought in a consultant (freelance / part of an organisation) to price this up, and does this include their work?  The key thing to remember, SharePoint fills many roles (in terms of seperate RMS, CMS, DMS etc. it is actually not that expensive!), but I would need to get an idea in more detail of what you are looking to do with it to provide much more guidance.  For example, 50 people sharing files is one thing (which yes it is on the steep side), but if you are running a mission critical system for your 50 users and 25,000 clients who collaborate with you, then no it is actually pretty reasonable!)Can you either post a private message back, or email me (I am on paul.r.williams @ h o t m a i l . c o . u k obviously without spaces).  \n\nOn licensing, I am a SharePoint Technical Architect and SME, and not a license expert, but I do not believe you can use your 2013 license for 2010.  Upgrading, again I have done a few of these (2003 - 2007, 2007 - 2010, 2010 - 2013) and it all depends on the implementation.  However, if you are moving from a PoC (proof of concept) type site, I would guess you have not built mission critical apps in there, and a standard upgrade from 2010 - 2013 is actually pretty straight forward (2007 - 2010 could pose a challenge, but there were more fundamental changes in that upgrade!)\n\nI hope that helps", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406808578", "subreddit": "sharepoint", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

As a previous post, check and code is registered as safe in the web config file.  Assuming the 2 working sites are part of the same web application, I guess this is less likely (as they would fail too?)\n\n2. Again as stated, updates and such often require PS Config (the deployment often just updates the assemblies and the like, without paying much attention to the content!) so ensure this is run if needed.  Again, I would expect the 2 working sites to also fail\n\n3. Permissions - this might be as simple as the user not having permission to do something (or the workflow not having permission), or could be related to files being checked out and locked?\n\nHope that helps, but I am interested to see how this plays out for you!

CSJx wasn't exactly under the radar before the merge, either. L e 0 consistently spewed out whiny bullshit until the merge. \n\nBeating SwK (and 228th as of last night?) in 8man RHoD matches is the closest to relevance CSJ has ever gotten. You do have to keep in mind, only few groups can handle the tactical dynamic change from 12v12 to 8v8. 8v8 has barely been practiced by anyone other than 10 months ago, so things are bound to be a bit more random. \n\nAs for strongest individual players? Sure, I'll give Khan Ignotus and MechB a tip of my hat, but the CSJx guys are weak. E n e r g y is the best one out of all of them, which makes it easier for them to field more good players in an 8v8, rather than a 12v12 which I don't think they have the team cohesion for.\n\nMaybe the ERLL gimmick works against some teams and PUGs.

{"body": "Don't put words in my mouth, I made no mention of Morphling's lore. To me, the set appears to be low quality and doesn't fit the theme of the hero (a formless mass of living water) well. There are ways of sticking close to a hero's theme without eroding the art direction. \n\nFor example, the Treants of Nature's Prophet. The first cosmetics for the Treants were [Call of the Dendrochron](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Call_of_the_Dendrochron) and [Flowering Treants](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Flowering_Treant), both still sharing wooden bodies with the original in question. After that came along other designs that replaced the tree-like creatures with plant creatures, like the Hallowed Horde, Shroomling, Shroom Thing, and the Living Nelum, still using plants found in forests with a twist. Others stuck to the tree theme, like the Evergreen Stalker or the Bonsaiko. \n\nWhile those themes might get old, the idea of what a Treant can look like without looking uncanny is still prone to evolution in a positive and organic looking matter (no pun intended). \n\nInstead of using plants or different types of trees, Edit: (Three workshop contributors apparently, Tiffany 'Arty' Boother, Bruno 'Belkun' Monti, and h a y e s) had the brilliant idea to move past that by creating a wooden effigy of a forest animal, the deer. That set is the [Father of the Forest set](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=239769577), which is coming in a future chest. \n\nHowever little I may be capable of designing or appreciating all the Treant cosmetics I named, the workshop and Valve's own Treant designs have demonstrated it is in fact possible to create new types of cosmetics for heroes that look as if they naturally belong within the game. Hell, even Morphling has cosmetics waiting in the workshop that are driving future cosmetics for the hero away from armor sets to pieces of ice (Era's Morphling set). \n\np.s I really like buying good looking hats ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406833409", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
