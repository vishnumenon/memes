{"body": "Here is compilation from couple older posts I wrote when sbdy asked about improvisation and modes....   \n--------------------------------------------\nGood start is to learn major scale in several keys - get eg \"Six Essential Fingerings\" by Jimmy Bruno. Yes you DO need theory - without it you can establish some bag of tricks - eg pentatonic licks for blues. But if you are faced with new song you are essentially flying blind.    \nSo start with major scale in several keys AND in several areas of the neck. Try to learn note names on fretboard in the process.    \nNext step would be constructing and playing simple 3 note diatonic chords based on steps of major scale (eg for C major: Cmaj, Dmin, Emin, Fmaj, Gmaj, Amin, Bdim). Learn to play such triads all over the neck - using previously learned scale patterns.    \nAt this point you should be able to tackle simple major/minor type of progressions. For any chord in the progression you locate the triad form on the neck in the position closest to you current one and then elaborate on that triad adding notes from major scale.     \nLater learn major scale modes (esp Dorian and Mixolydian).   \n\nI am NOT in favor of starting with pentatonic - simply because people get stuck in a hopeless rut - they learn couple pentatonic patterns and desperately try to make them sound \"good\" usually by playing a lot of notes. \n-----------------------------------------------------------\nGet yourself a book that would spell out how to play major scales (same as Ionian mode) - for example \"Six Essential Fingerings\" by Jimmy Bruno.\n\nMany books teach modes in following way:   \n1. take major scale - that is Ionian mode eg. C D E F G A B C = C Ionian    \n2. start on 2nd step eg. D E F G A B C D = D Dorian     \n3. start on 3rd step eg. E F G A B C D E = E Phrygian    \n4. start on 4th step eg. F G A B C D E F = F Lydian    \n5. start on 5th step eg. G A B C D E F G = G Mixolydian        \n6. start on 6th step eg. A B C D E F G A = A Aeolian        \n7. start on 7th step eg. B C D E F G A B= Locrian        \n\nWhile it is true that Dorian mode is the same as starting major scale on second step (and NOT \"sliding it up\" as you describe\") better way to think about modes is following:   \nLydian - sharp 4th (major scale + #4)   \nIonian - all natural  \nMixolydian - flat 7th  \nDorian - flat 7th +flat 3rd (major scale with flatten 3rd and 7th)  \nAeolian - flat 3rd + flat 7th + flat 6th  \nPhrygian - flat 3rd + flat 7th + flat 6th + flat 2nd  \nLocrian - flat 3rd + flat 7th + flat 6th + flat 2nd + flat 5th  \n  \nLydian and Ionian are major modes (natural 3rd and 7th).  \nMixolydian is Dominant mode (natural 3rd but flatten 7th)  \nDorian, Aeolian, Phrygian and Locrian are all minor modes since they have flat 3rd.  \n  \nYou play Ionian or Lydian over major chords.  \nYou play mixolydian over 7th chords (G7 etc).  \nAnd you play the rest of the modes (Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian and Locrian) over minor chords - and the way you chose them is by examining for the presence natural or flatten 6th, 2nd, and 5th either in the chord itself or the melody note. Or perhaps in the chord preceding the current minor chord. So it is NOT a trivial choice.  \nBut rules are:  \nMinor chord but 6th is natural =&gt; Dorian  \nMinor chord but 6th is flatten and 2nd is natural =&gt; Aeolian  \nMinor chord but 6th and 2nd are flatten and 5th is natural =&gt; Phrygian  \nMinor chord but 5th is flatten =&gt; Locrian  \n  \nI would start from learning Dorian and Mixolydian modes - they are very close to pentatonic scales.   \nFor example:    \nG Mixolydian = G A B C D E F   \nG Major Pent = G A B D E   \nD Dorian = D E F G A B C   \nD Minor Pent = D F G A C     \n\nPractice those modes as following - for G Mixolydian record loop like eg F C G G.   \nFor D Dorian vamp like Em7 Dm7 Em7 Dm7.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406855140", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 27, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Modes are names for some different types of eight-note scales.  Learn the major scale first, it is just another name for the Ionian mode.  If you play the same notes of the C major scale (C D E F G A B C), but start, end, and put emphasis on D (treating it as your home or \"root\" note), it becomes the Dorian mode and music composed with this emphasis on D will have a different feel than the C major scale.  You can do this with any of the eight notes in a major scale and there is a different greek mode name for each root.  If you start, end, and put emphasis on the A, you get the Aeolian mode, which is commonly known as the A minor scale (the natural minor scale to be specific, there are a couple other variations of the minor scale but they aren't modes.)\n\nI'm taking the Coursera Fundamentals of Music Theory course right now, and the video lectures for Week 1 and 2 explain scales and modes pretty well (it's only about an hour and a half of video.)

Shouldn't be more than 7 moves, maybe 8-9 if you get something fingertricky. A good white cross in this case would have been x' L D R F' U r' D2. You should also plan the whole cross before starting the solve. There are lots of exercises for this, the most useful are not limiting yourself to 15 seconds and solving the cross with your eyes closed.\n\nPair 1: Your first seven moves didn't really accomplish anything. You should have done something like U R U R2 U2 R for this pair.\n\nPair 2: You basically did a y2 when you should have just used your left hand. Also too long, this pair should have been done as U y' L' U2 L U L' U' L\n\nPair 3: Unnecessary rotations and again, way too long. I would have done the red/green pair here using R' U R U2 R U' R' which sets up the green/orange for a nice U' R' U' R. However if you are dead set on doing green/orange first then you should have done R U' R2 U2 R U' R' U' R. Don't use sledgehammer either.\n\nPair 4: Obviously you shouldn't have done all the U moves at the beginning, but even without them this pair was too long. Should have been U2 L' U2 L U L' U' L\n\nOverall f2l notes: This is where you need the most work. You have two main bad habits. **1**: Randomly removing edges/corners from slots just to get them in the top layer, where you then have to perform long algorithms to solve the case you've created. Whenever you remove an edge or corner from a lot, you should do it in a purposeful manner than sets up a 3-move case like R U' R' or R U R'. Notice the difference between how you removed the orange/blue corner in the first pair versus how I removed the orange/blue corner in the first pair. Also note in my example for pair three that when I removed the red/green corner I intentionally pair it with its edge. Taking an extra second to contemplate your options is better than just doing random moves. Also, taking a temporary slow down in your times now will make it much easier for you to make progress once this sort of thing becomes second nature. **2**: You don't seem to know what to do when the edge and corner are next to each other. In the first, second, and fourth pairs you wasted 3-4 moves breaking up adjacent corner/edge pair in order to set up cases you know, instead of just doing the easy optimal alg. General rule of thumb is that if both the corner and edge are in the top layer it should only take you 7-8 moves to solve the pair. The wiki has a lot of good algs for all of these cases.\n\nLast layer: Well obviously you should learn 2-look last layer but that's not really a pressing concern yet. You should use a real U-perm though, either R U' R U R U R U' R' U' R2 or M2 U M U2 M' U M2 and the mirrors. I don't know if you use any other bad algs, but improving the number/speed of your last layer algs is an ongoing process that you should always be working on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406868585", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Here are a few examples:\n\n•is it more likely that your parents give you gifts, or that magical fairies that live at the polar regions employ tens of thousands of elves to create toys and deliver them all over the world in 24 hours?\n\n•is it more likely that JFK was shot by a crazed former military nut-job, or a worldwide conspiracy between thousands if people has been able to keep quiet for **FIFTY YEARS**?\n\n•~~is it more likely that I have shit myself, or that the prosecution has planted fake doggy doo I'm my trousers?~~ *wait....no...bad example*\n\n• finally: is it more likely that my client suffers from NPT (a sickness we all see *EVERY DAY* in this beautiful kingdom, or that he is part of some global conspiracy to \"end all organizations by requesting Karma\" (which would be silly in general.)\n\nClearly, there is am easy answer: **NECKBEARD-POTTYMOUTH-TOURRETTES**\n\nI move on.

{"body": "Those three chords are all diminished 7 chords. The last image is just a common symbol used to represent diminished.\n\nSo what are diminished 7 chords? In a minor key, the dim7 chord is the seventh chord formed starting from the **raised seventh** in harmonic minor. For example, in the key of A minor (A B C D E F G with the G raised to a G# to form harmonies), you can take every other note starting from G# and form a diminished chord, the vii° chord. That would be G# B D F. If you compare this to the V7 chord in C major (G B D F), you'll see that this diminished chord is just a V7 chord with the root raised. (This is especially useful in Jazz because a diminished 7 chord can be substituted for a dominant 7 chord, but the reason is a little bit more complicated.) You'll see in the first example that the Ebdim7 follows immediately after a D7. That's because the Ebdim7 and D7 are basically the same chord in that context.\n\nDiminished chords are special because they're symmetrical. They're formed with a root, a flat 3, a flat 5, and a *double* flat 7. Let's try applying that formula to a chord starting with A:\n\n**A C Eb Gb**\n\nOkay cool. Now let's try it from C:\n\n**C Eb Gb Bbb**\n\nThe Bbb is enharmonic to A. So that's really **C Eb Gb A**\n\nNow how about from Eb\n\n**Eb Gb Bbb Dbb**\n\nThe Bbb is A, and the Db is C. So that's really **Eb Gb A C**\n\nNow from Gb\n\n**Gb Bbb Dbb Fbb**\n\nThe Bbb is A, the Dbb is C, the Fbb is Eb. That's **Gb A C Eb**\n\n___________________________\n\nOkay, so what's happening here? Those four chords have the same notes. The dim7 chord is made of four notes, each a *minor third* apart. That means that the chord is the same no matter which note is your root. That also means that you can use that dim7 shape and move it up or down *three frets* to make the same dim7 chord. That Ebdim7 chord is fingered in the same way as the Adim7 chord because they *are* the same chord. The difference is that the bass note (often just covered by the bassist) will be an Eb for the Ebdim7 and an A for the Adim7.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406911687", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm going to repeat what I said about heroics in an old thread here.\n\nAlso, your name is a reference to awesome and I love you.\n\n====================================================\n\n* Overall they added so much stam and health to normal gear to compensate for burstiness in PvP because they were still trying to legitimize Arena as  [D I G I T A L S P O R T S](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/e/e3/Dlc_stanleyparable_announcer_idle_05.mp3) (hint: it failed so laughably hard they're still trying to fix the damage they did in that particular instance of balancing *today*), with reasoning that it would help mitigate the high damage in PvE for everyone in PVE due to many (bad) healing changes. Because, as mentioned before, monsters would instagib and DID instagib far more frequently it didn't fucking matter how many hundreds of stamina you had in comparison to your ~300 or so actually good stats. You died and you died like the dog you were.\n\n* Oh the lovely stat inflation on secondary stats (Armor Penetration, Critical Strike rating, etc) because of those stamina changes, too. You went from reasonable, translatable numbers to hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of a particular stat for a fraction of a % increase in your stats, with it being infinitesimally smaller because the only stats that actually mattered were Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Spirit. In some cases things were so horribly balanced that items with higher secondary stats than base stats on slightly higher ilevel gear from heroics lowered your damage or overall healing.\n\n* Hell, while I'm on the subject of gear and the badness of Cataclysm heroics, Cataclysm heroics only gave out blues and blue-quality items. In tBC and Vanilla, bosses in max level content would have slight higher chances of giving alright purples statted for particular roles (dungeons sets and whatnot) that would last awhile, while end bosses in heroics in TBC would have a gurantee'd drop for epics as a sort of reward for sticking it out for the full duration. With Cataclysm, not *only* were you awarded shitty heroic-tier statted blues that would be upgraded the moment you set foot in a raid, but the specific blues were just slightly upgraded versions of said heroics 80-85 level gear. There was litterally no point in getting this gear because it was virtually *all the same* with 50 more of x stat (or 300 for what little that mattered as said earlier), and a metric ton of more stamina. AND because some of these heroics were already 84-85 in level, there was literally no semblance of an upgrade whatsoever.\n\n* The other, ulterior of doing heroics was also implimented badly, which was the Badges of Justice/Justice points ordeal. With Badges of Justice in tBC, they gave you badges/currency to buy slightly off purples from badge vendors in case you had trouble getting into raiding OR use it to buy things like resist gear, and in Wotlk that was upgraded/taken further to give perfectly serviceable off-gear that was good for the last tier of raiding for that patch (which people bitched out), both making sure that Justice at least had their uses. In Cata they took this system and made it so that you would have a cap on the total amount of Justice you could hold AS WELL AS making it so that you needed to hover around that cap to buy *anything* AS FUCKING WELL AS making it so that heroics didn't give a servicable amount of JP. In edition to everything else, anything and everything you needed to do for heroics was just meaningless.\n\nKeeping in mind, that's just the infrastructure-based nitpicks. The class related problems were faaaaaaaaaaaaar worse.\n\n* Tanks in Wotlk were overpowered in heroics for a number of reasons, of which being making it so that gear from the last tier was easier to obtain over the last last tier (this was a problem with all 3 roles). So in Cata they decided everyone should have Active Mitigation (basically, you press a button, you are now tanking, but without that button duration stuff *good luck son*). What they didn't forsee is that a tank can and will die to everything bosses will throw at them if they are, for some reason, stunned or silenced before they can cast their active mitagation. They also soak up so much more damage than even in tBC days that your disorganized pug would die and die often on trash, before getting to the boss that would have loot that basically useless. On top of this they made threat harder for tanks to generate, so mobs went wild because of lack of player threat utility.\n\n* Oh and healers, which is oddly only 1 of the 2 bad healing changes they made. Healers, due to overgearing, never really had to cast in heroics in wotlk (or tbc, depending on what you were) once you past that point of no return, so they aimed to fix that. So they upped the mana costs on everything and made Spirit more important, which was alright. But somehow someone at Blizzard was put in the out corner and had to take it out further on healers, so they decided to change every healing class and role to have the exact same spells as 1 of them (the Holy Priest, everyone having the HoT, the small heal, the big heal with a long cast time, and the big heal with a short cast time but costs 4x as much mana as the other big heal), varied only in their AoE heals (all of which ws nerfed heavily), and cut mana regen as well as making so that \"healer\" gear was heavy in said cut mana regen, but not in int for healing power or maximum mana. Healers went from \"usable\" or \"overpowered, but usable\" to \"I'm working just to keep the party alive no matter how easy the encounter is, and need to hold the party after every encounter because I ran out even with proper management.\" And if the healer was instagibbed, because Blizzard also weakened their personal protection by a ludicrous amount, the party was doomed.\n\n* The OTHER healing change is that gave every class in the game a way to heal themselves, but made it so that every class in the game had to RELY on said self healing (and the insane nerfs to healers for PvE content was made to reflect this gating). The problem with THAT is that most self healing required a class resource that wasn't always readily available, or required someone like DPS or tanks to stop dps or tanking. The healing effectiveness per class was variable, and it lead to things like Rogues outhealing the entire party because their self healing, because it worked on a % and had 100% uptime. Due to \"wanting people to conserve mana\", too, if you were a class that used mana at the time you were SoL.\n\n* As mentioned before, they also tried to make utility used more in heroics (like interrupts and CC) without actually giving all classes said interrupts, cc, or even threat reduction, and actually nerfing or removing most classes (even healers!) ability to cleanse most status effects. Blizzard forced CC usage on groups that could seldom use CC (and with inconsistent cooldowns, Mage poly having non and retpally repentance and shammy hex being on 1 minute cooldowns, even if they \"miss\"), status effects on groups that probably could deal with instagibbing dots because they were an effect the healer could no longer dispel (and if they could, it has a 15 second cooldown now so the person who's not the tank or healer is fucked if 2 more get it, or the party is doomed if the tank AND the healer get it), and interrupts on groups with 20 or 30 second interrupt cooldowns between them with no way to coordinate how to use them in game (I was in a guild I was in a vent server, and even then lag would almost cost everything at times).\n\n* DPS was changed to tBC levels of inconsistency, which annoyed almost everyone. Our Warlock was pulling 20k in all blues while everyone else was struggling to keep up or pass 15k. AoE damage also got nerfed (with high enough ear in wotlk you could zerg passed groups while spamming AoE, but again: with strong enough gear), so encounters that had legitimate AoE would be needlessly problematic no matter how many much we could do.\n\nAnd [Blizzard's official response to all this bad design](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2053469)? Lolgetbetter. Even if we were the cutting edge raiders, even if had evidence supporting that this shit was legitimately awful.\n\nAnd then when they realized they they had lost almost a mill sub to this nonsense a weak later they nerfed *everything*, and then compensate for their bad class design changes by lowering the health of everything in heroics, giving tanks a 300% threat gen buff and added stamina buffs, heavily improved mana regen and healing effects across the board. [**THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE XD**](http://wowpedia.org/Patch_4.0.6).\n\nSo yeah...heroics in cata weren't hard. Just bad. Really, really bad.\n\n==================================\n\n[Original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/2b7yae/things_wildstar_has_taught_me/cj3ne3y)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406952228", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Four players take the role of military leaders (each in a mecha) where your power up is calling in squadrons to help you on the battlefield. The number of forces and the type of vehicles that arrive depends on how many reinforcement points (RP) you've earned. You slowly earn RP over time for merely surviving, you'll earn RP for making kills, or you can also earn RP at a reduced rate for the kills your AI allies make. It's a totally valid strategy to to hang back and let your forces do the fighting for you, though a good balance of attacking and hanging back is the key to winning. There's also a pirate NPC faction that will appear throughout a battle to try and sway the war in their own favor. You'll experience a number of different formations and strategies the pirates use to attack. Ambushes (attacks from all sides), a single line (attack from one side), pincer attacks (attack from two sides), supply convoys (high RP and ammo refills), VIP transport ships (killing the VIP awards Max RP), or even the dreaded cruiser blitzkrieg attack. Players may need to team up because the pirates can win the battle too. These different events mix up the gameplay, but they also add RP into the battle so that battles naturally escalate in troop intensity over time. We'd like to have the game out by the Fall, but it really depends on how our Steam Greenlight situation goes.

{"body": "well the whole idea of it, that it says there are 4 cognitive functions: T F S N, is a bit lacking. Obviously your brain has more cognitive functions than that. Doing math is a function. Reading is a function. Comparing things is a function. Recalling memories is a function. Reacting emotionally to scenarios is a function. You get the idea, if we try to list all the function of a brain we'd be here a while.\n\nMBTI tries to treat T F S N like they are the atomic functions. As if every other function is some weighted combination of these. Or if personality is some weighted combination of them. And of course there's  E/I, and some rules for excluding certain functions based on the top two, and a rule that the top two have to be opposite temperament.\n\nBut that's a lot like a religious belief, I think. To say \"someone is 50% Ni, 27% Te, 10% Fi, 5% Se, 4% Ne, 2% Ti, 1% Fe, 1% Si\" and that this explains why they like fantasy or like to be in control of the situation, or why they like to have 4 or 5 plans and be efficient. People who fit this type TEND to have those traits yes, but it's just an observation not an explanation. I think it is very similar to saying \"there is a god who created the universe\". Yes there is a universe and it has some order to it. Yes the universe had to be created in the first place. But how does that prove a god did it? It's the same thing with MBTI. (God is like the functions). Yes people tend to favour certain brain modes or cognitive functions over others. Yes people tend to either keep to themselves or conform with everybody else when being in these brain modes. But that doesn't mean there's a \"T\" section of the brain or an \"N\" section of the brain. Just because it looks like there is, doesn't mean there is. I don't think anybody has seen a specific \"T\" part of the brain (there's the analytic part and the emotional part and those are separate, but something specifically for collecting facts and putting them together, no, that seems to be some sort of effect of all of the brain combined). Nor have they seen a god. It just looks like \"God\" or \"T part of the brain\" exist, but that's an oversimplification of reality. It's more complicated than that, and our thirsty brains are too eager to drink the sweet empty calories of a simple explanation rather than prepare a more elaborate meal that takes time to digest but feeds our curiosity more effectively.\n\nSo anyways hopefully this stupid rant has somewhat of a valid comparison and shows why MBTI isn't really scientific.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1406963678", "subreddit": "intj", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1st lesson:  How to hold a pick, the parts of the guitar, where/how to fret a note.  How to read chord charts. How to play G, D, A, E open chords.  Whole note strums.  Practice switching between two chords.  If time, 12 bar blues in A and D with whole notes.  Practice the 12 bar blues with whole notes for the week, working on getting each note to ring out properly, and working on timing and eventually speed.\n\n2nd lesson:  Review the chords and the 12 bar blues.  Pick two songs that follow the 12 bar in A and D.  Play along with these songs.  Introduce half note strums, and try to play the songs using half notes.  Teach Em, Am, and C chords.  Teach the progression D Em G A and G Am C D.  Have them practice these progressions with whole and half notes, and keep practicing the 12 bar blues.\n\n3rd lesson.  Review previous progressions.  Introduce quarter notes and play progressions and 12 bar blues with quarter notes.  Show list of major scales for the keys C D E F G A and B.  Explain that the 12 bar blues always uses the I IV and V of any key.  Explain the previous progression uses the I ii IV V of any key, which is a common progression.  Quiz the student what the 12 bar format would be in the key of G, play along with a 12 bar song in G.\n\n4th lesson:  Review 12 bar blues in A D and G with whole, half, and quarter notes.  Teach 1/8th note stums and try to jam along.  Same with the I ii IV V progression in D and G.  Teach the I vii IV V progression in G.  Explain that the I IV and V are usually major chords, while the ii and vii (and iii) are usually minor chords.  Quiz the student, is there E or Em in the key of C etc.  Find some more easy progressions (I iii vii V in C) and strum along.\n\n5th lesson:  Review all known chords and progressions as well as the theory behind them.  At this point, you could learn more chords like Dm, F, B and Bm.  Explain that F, B, and Bm don't have open notes, so they are movable.  If a song uses a chord you don't know yet (like C#m), you can just move one of the movable chords up the neck until you've find the right chord.  This way you can play almost any major or minor chord in any key.  Practice keys/progressions using these movable chords (like I ii iii IV in A) and find songs that use these progressions.\n\nLesson six:  Introduce TAB, or standard notation if you want.  Teach some fun riffs that follow the major scale (Green Day's \"Warning\", Bob Marley's \"Stir It Up\", Bill Wither's \"Lean on Me\", Ben E King's \"Stand by Me\" etc).  Show how the notes of the major scale generally match up with the notes of the chords (the riff in \"Warning\" plays an A note over an A chord etc).  Explain how to make triads by harmonizing the major scale, so the student knows what notes are in each chord.  Quiz the student - what notes are in C.  Is there G or G# in an E chord etc.  Help them match these notes to the notes on the fretboard.\n\nedit - this is a bit messy obviously.  I just wrote it up in about 20 minutes.  I'm a guitar teacher, and my lessons follow a similar flow to this, but most students only get 30 minutes per week and they don't get everything down perfectly each week, so this is often spread out over several months.  I also focus a little more on songs for most people, so they don't get bored with all the theory etc.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407016043", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

To be honest, the 280 is going to pretty similar, the 280x and above are going to start to have notable bottlenecks. \n\nKeep in mind, you don't lose performance from a bottlenecl, you just don't gain as much as you could. Getting a powerful GPU that'll bottleneck now and upgrading the CPU later is a perfectly valid buying plan. The problem with bottlenecking is that it's often a symptom of an unbalanced system, and often indicates that you could should be spending money elsewhere.\n\nThe R9 280 and R9 270x both might have very small bottlenecks with the i3, but there's both good purchases for the long term.

Everything about this tournament was poor, except for the play, which was good, but lacked the proper casting needed to make it enjoyable for the viewer. I have nothing against either Trump or Hafu, but casting tournaments requires an added layer of wisdom and energy combined, which understandably isn't Trump's thing, but at times led to some awkward (dead air), and made the experience lessened to an extent of what it could be. \n\nThe Gaara vs Tides game 4 was a great example of what I mean by the casters lack of chemistry with each other.

{"body": "I can understand why it is difficult for one to take the hadith and run with them with out understanding its sciences and what they actually mean in their real context. \n\nI can help you understand. So Qur'an has never been altered or changed. It exists wholly in the copies that were spread out by Uthman. \n\nWhat you seem to be confused with missing verses or different recitations. I can assure you. There are no missing verses. The confusion stems from not knowing the fact that Qur'an was revealed in 7 different recitations. What that means will take some time to explain to someone unfamiliar with Arabic. Written originally did not contain vowel markings. These Markings have become essential for the correct pronunciation of words, which can be up to 7 different pronunciations. So what do we mean by pronouciations and Arabic and vowel markings. For example the word Malik in the Fatiha of Qur'an is writing M A L I K in ENGLISH. A and I are vowels. In Arabic, It is Written M L K. Vowel Markings can give it a number of pronunciations. But only certain Vowel markings can make it in to a work for eg. M O L A K doesnt not make sense, it isn't a word, an when written MLK in Arabic, an Arabic speakers knows where the Vowel Markings go because that is how the language is spoken. Similar rules apply to other Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Aramaic. A hebrew speaker reads hebrew with out the vowel markings because of having knowledge of the language. If you don't know the language and don't have knowledge of it but are taught how to read it, You can easily mess up a pronounciation. So, Different Pronounciates of the Qur'an that are still considered authentic would be  the base work M L K. Then the vowels would be added M A A L I K, this pronunciation means King, another Pronounciation is M A L I K , this pronounciation means Owner, The word in The fatiha is used as follows, Maaliki yaumiddeen, King of the judgementday). It is also acceptable to pronounce it as Maliki yaumiddeen(Owner of the Judgement day). It doesn't take away from the skeleton(base word) of the text. Which to this day are preserved in the Mushaf UL Uthmaan, a Dated original copy which belonged to Caliph Uthmaan(ra). But it doesn't change anything else either, as Muslims belief Allah(swt) is the Owner and king of Judgement day. \n\nSahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 61, Number 514 :\nNarrated by 'Umar bin Al-Khattab\n\nI heard Hisham bin Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle and I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Allah's Apostle had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, \"Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?\" He replied, \"Allah's Apostle taught it to me.\" I said, \"You have told a lie, for Allah's Apostle has taught it to me in a different way from yours.\" So I dragged him to Allah's Apostle and said (to Allah's Apostle): \"I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven't taught me!\" On that Allah's Apostle said, \"Release him, (O 'Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!\" Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Allah's Apostle said, \"It was revealed in this way,\" and added, \"Recite, O 'Umar!\" I recited it as he had taught me. Allah's Apostle then said, \"It was revealed in this way. This Qur'an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you).\"\n\n\n\nSahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 61, Number 509 \n\nNarrated by Zaid bin Thabit\n\nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), \"Umar has come to me and said: \"Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the! Qur'an (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur'an be collected.\" I said to 'Umar, \"How can you do something which Allah's Apostle did not do?\" 'Umar said, \"By Allah, that is a good project. \"Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.\" Then Abu Bakr said (to me). 'You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur'an and collect it in one book).\" By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur'an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, \"How will you do something which Allah's Apostle did not do?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"By Allah, it is a good project.\" Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. So I started looking for the Qur'an and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is: 'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa' (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur'an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with 'Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of 'Umar.\n\n\n\nWith out understanding the proper context, hadith can be powerful weapons in the wrong hands. I hope you were simply unaware and not someone looking to cause trouble here. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407130515", "subreddit": "islam", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I've learned a lot of stuff from her playing style , and I actually like how she commentates while streaming. I have NO idea what happened during the tourney, even analysis in some cases was sub-par. The typing and constant giggling made it too non-serious in a bad way (you can be funny, but not just giggle randomly).\n\n* I do not watch Trump as I mostly like to chill and have a laugh on streams, and he is too \"serious\" for my taste. Altho I really liked his analysis on the tourney. He talked when he had to, and gave good insight. Could improve? Yeah, but I'm also considering this as his first time doing it and it was good enough.\n\n* Everyone knows how chat goes when there are 20k+ people watching. I didn't mind the bot instabanning on nudes, dongers, ascii and shit, as it normally just breaks the chat. What I actually disliked was the mods that were doing the regular modding that they do on Hafu's chat regularly. I forgot to save the screenshot but hell , they were even banning when people were saying \"T I D E S B O Y S\" and 10 minutes later when Tides won a match a TWITCH STAFF MEMBER said the same... They really acted like dicks trying to mod something that was obviously unmodable, challenging the chat and doing stupid bans over anything they didn't liked.\n\nI'd really like to see both commentating again, but probably with someone else. Frodan for example would be a good caster that can team up with both of them, because he really knows how to kill silent moments and come up with real game questions that would have improved the casting overall by a lot.\n\nSorry for bad englando, not my main language.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407150965", "subreddit": "hearthstone", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

O português é só meu quinto idioma.\nEu ara estou com 18 anos e estou no meu segundo ano na universidade.\n\nQuase! UtilíSSimas, com dois \"S\". \n\n18 anos é a idade que eu tenho agora, e você fez em me sentir muito preguiçoso! hahaha Com essa idade e já sabe tantas línguas, isso é sinceramente incrível. Meus parabéns!\n\n&gt;Empecei com espanhol (o meu tercer) há cinco anos em Grade 9 (em Canadá, a escola primária e secundária têm 12 grados juntos). Assim andava, ensinando-me idiomas, até o fim do meu ano de Grade 12 (houverem exames muito importantes), e nunca empecei com nenhum mais depois de eu começar a universidade (comecei no meu segundo, não primeiro, ano, porque pude saltâ-lo (correto isso?)) à excepção dum pouquinho de árabe e turco.\n\nTercer, em português: terceiro. Grade = série. Empecei = comecei.\n\nUma nota sobre o sistema educacional aqui no Brasil: aqui o sistema é parecido com o dos EUA (pelo pouco que conheço dele): 9 séries no ensino primário (normalmente chamado de Primeiro Grau), e mais três séries no secundário (Segundo Grau).\n\nA forma gramaticalmente correta seria \"Saltá-lo\" (a letra A também nunca leva o acento ^ . As únicas letras que aparecem com esse acento são o E e o O). Apesar disso, o verbo saltar se usa apenas com o sentido de \"jump\" (E, em alguns lugares do país, usa-se para indicar que desceu do ônibus, por exemplo, \"Saltei do ônibus em frente à padaria\"). Com o sentido de \"skip\", normalmente se usa o verbo \"Pular\", apesar de ele literalmente também significar \"jump\". Vai entender hahahah (Vai entender = go figure, caso não conheça a expressão).\n\n&gt;mas achei que português foi estupidamente fácil (essa é uma expressão inglesa - não significa que português seja estúpido senão que é ridículo o feito que pude aprendê-lo tão facilmente) porque já havia aprendido espanhol.\n\nNão se preocupe, a expressão \"Estupidamente X\" para significar \"Muito X\" existe em português também :D\n\nE sim, português e espanhol são muito parecidos. Inclusive, nas fronteiras do Brasil (todos os países ao nosso redor falam espanhol), é comum haver o que chamamos de \"Portunhol\", uma mistura das duas línguas que ocorre especialmente em áreas onde o comércio entre os países é forte. Por exemplo, muitas pessoas aqui visitam o Paraguai por haver lá uma vantagem de preço em relação à aqui, devido a moeda paraguaia ser desvalorizada. E os lojistas de lá não deixam uma pequena barreira linguística impedir nenhuma venda haha :D\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407199103", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I can tell you it's not limited to English:\n\n&gt;#9\\. Chat – to spell or not to spell\n\n&gt;The main principle of spelling in chat is that it must be alternative; in many cases, the\nspelling is phonetic, but often the pronunciation behind the spelling is also alternative.\nTo illustrate the range of phonetic/orthographic variation, I have listed just a few\ndifferent versions of hello, which are commonly used as an opening greeting. It is an\ninternational word, in Danish hallo or halløj, in Greenlandic aluu. However, in these\nexamples, it is not always clear exactly which language is being used in each case…\n\n&gt;&gt;hellow, haløø haløø, alow, aloooorw, haloo, harlorv, halloor, haarlååår, aloor,\nhaloorsuaq, halunnguaq, haløøg, haløjsa, ½løgza,^4 haløjsan, aløj, alu, aluu,\naluut,\nhaluu, haluukkut, ½luukkut, aluukkut, alunnguakkut, halaai, halajjj, arlarj,\nhalaarj, halææ, alææ…\n\n&gt;It is a characteristic feature of the international Short Messaging Service (SMS)\nlanguage to use alternative letters and substitute symbols for letters, syllables, and\neven words. This is done partly in order to save key strokes and space and partly\njust as innovation. ASCII characters and other symbols are frequently used in chat\nas well, and the use is to a great extent international. As a matter of course, Greenlandic\nchatters master these spelling principles:\n\n&gt;     (6) a. r U busy ‘are you busy?’\n&gt;         b. Me2 ‘me too’\n&gt;         c. @ngut for angut (nickname) ‘man’\n&gt;         d. Ka3ne for Katrine (girl’s name; 3 = [tʁi])\n&gt;         e. 9v for Nivi (girl’s name; 9 = [ni], v = [vi])\n&gt;            etc.\n&gt;including the use of z for s:\n&gt;\n&gt;         f. zuu for suu ‘yes’\n&gt;         g. takuzzer for takusser ‘see you’\n&gt;Prosodic and emotional information is given by letter repetition, use of capitals, etc.:\n&gt;\n&gt;     (7) a. igguuuu for iggu ‘sweetie’ [emphatic]\n        b. ILUMOORPUTIT ‘you are right’ [loud]\n&gt;\n&gt;and emotional information is given by smileys and emoticons:\n&gt;\n&gt;     (8) a. Halaarj :o) ‘hello’ [+ smiley = happy]\n&gt;         b. Hey tamassi *S* ‘hey, everybody’ [+ emoticon = smile]\n&gt;\n&gt; ----\n&gt;\n&gt;4\\. ½løgza and ½luukkut are Greenlandic expansions of ‘hello’ or ‘hallo’. ½ is pronounced [hal]\nin Danish, so ½løj (from Danish ‘halløj’ from ‘hello’) is a common rebus-way of spelling in chat.\n\n--[Jacobsen (2009)](https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/tsl.86.16cha/details)\n\nEdit: Actually see also [Non-verbal signalling in digital discourse: The case of letter repetition (Darics 2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695813000330):\n\n&gt;Abstract\n\n&gt;This study focuses on the interactional functions of non-standard spelling, in particular letter repetition, used in text-based computer-mediated communication as a means of non-verbal signalling. The aim of this paper is to assess the current state of non-verbal cue research in computer-mediated discourse and demonstrate the need for a more comprehensive and methodologically rigorous exploration of written non-verbal signalling. The study proposes a contextual and usage-centered view of written paralanguage. Through illustrative, close linguistic analyses the study proves that previous approaches to non-standard spelling based on their relation to the spoken word might not account for the complexities of this CMC cue, and in order to further our understanding of their interactional functions it is more fruitful to describe the role they play during the contextualisation of the verbal messages. The interactional sociolinguistic approach taken in the analysis demonstrates the range of interactional functions letter repetition can achieve, including contribution to the inscription of socio-emotional information into writing, to the evoking of auditory cues or to a display of informality through using a relaxed writing style.\n\nEdit 2: and from [Crystal (2006)](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/english-language-and-linguistics-general-interest/language-and-internet-2nd-edition)\n\n&gt;Issues of feedback and turn-taking are ways in which Netspeak\ninteraction differs from conversational speech. But Netspeak is\nunlike speech also with respect to the formal properties of the\nmedium – properties that are so basic that it becomes extremely\ndifficult for people to live up to the recommendation that they\nshould ‘write as they talk’. Chief among these properties is the\ndomain of prosody and paralanguage15 – phonological terms\nwhich capture the notion of ‘it ain’t what you say but the way\nthat you say it’ – as expressed through vocal variations in pitch\n(intonation), loudness (stress), speed, rhythm, pause, and tone of\nvoice. As with traditional writing, there have been somewhat\ndesperate efforts to replace it in the form of an exaggerated use of\nspelling and punctuation, and the use of capitals, spacing, and\nspecial symbols for emphasis. Examples include repeated letters\n(aaaaahhhhh, hiiiiiii, ooops, soooo), repeated punctuation marks\n(no more!!!!!, whohe????, hey!!!!!!!!!, see what you started????????\n??????????), and the following range of emphatic conventions:\n\n&gt;      all capitals for ‘shouting’:         I SAID NO\n&gt;      letter spacing for ‘loud and clear’: W H Y, N O T, w h y n o t\n&gt;      word/phrase emphasis by asterisks:   the *real* answer\n\n&gt;15\\. Crystal and Quirk (1964), Crystal (1969). Emoticons have been called ‘the\nparalanguage of the Internet’ (Dery, 1993), but they are not the same, in that they\nhave to be consciously added to a text. Their absence does not mean that the user lacks\nthe emotion conveyed. In face-to-face communication, someone may grin over several\nutterances, and the effect may be noted. In Netspeak, a ‘grin’ emoticon might be added\nto just one utterance, although the speaker may continue to ‘feel’ the relevant emotion\nover several turns. There is also no guarantee that the person who sends a ‘grin’ is\nactually grinning at all – a point which also applies to abbreviations used: how many\npeople are actually ‘laughing out loud’ when they send LOL?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407204200", "subreddit": "linguistics", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Each have a slightly different sound when played over each of the chords, so play around with them and figure out which you like.\n\nI should note that if you want to sound really \"close to home\", and hit as many as the chord notes as you can, you can play Am pentatonic over C chords (all 3 notes in C chord are in Am pentatonic), Dm pentatonic over F (same reason) and Em pentatonic over G (again, same reason). Reason is that each of the pentatonic's root is the 6th interval of the root note in the chord.\n\nIf you want to change key from C to G major, you'll have the progression G C D G with the Am, Bm and Em pentatonic minor scales. \n\nTLDR: Given a key, you can play the minor pentatonics for the minor chords in that key (2nd, 3rd and 6th degrees from root key, assuming major key).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407240153", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I do it with my mates all the time, but we play for shits and giggles and lose a shitton of games doing silly shit. Yet if we really want to win, we just tryhard, i.e. have a proper draft with a tactic in mind, then execute the tactic to a T. \n\n&gt;My recommendation is to adjust the balance so that the team with one or two really weak players is pitted against a team with a lower overall MMR.\n\nNo, all this would achieve to have a similiar youperson come here tomorrow complaining about getting thrashed by a team with 4 2kmmr players geetig carried by a 7k mmr demi god.\n\nI do not often say this about valve, but I think the matchmaking algorithm is pretty good,a ll things considered. Most of the complaints about matchmaking here on reddit simply boil down to a very simple:\nG i t g u d\n\nEDIT:\nJust looked through a bunch of your matches you posted, and tbh, I think it is your draft, none of them really make sense, it just seems to be that everyone is just picking whatever they feel like. This is fine if you can win like that, and many people do, yet this is clearly not working for you. Why compound the problem of having subpar players by having a supbar draft on top of it? Your top brood game for instance. What were you expecting? There is no synergy, no gameplan (that I can see anyway), all I see is 5 random heroes.\n\nWhat you want to be doing is going for strong and EASY lineups.\n\nMirana SD is strong, but I would never give that combo to \"bad\" players and expect anything but disaster.\n\nI would give these bad players the oh so popular CM jugger combo lane, heroes that are all pointy clicky and can't really fuck up to the point of trolling your own team (see SD for that)\n\nYou also want to have a dominant ganking mid, since bad players fail their lanes for silly reasons all the time, so you want a way to counteract that. So you generally do not want an OD farming up his sheepstick RO mid.\n\nAlso have some sort of plan, people focus too much in individual skill and \"big plays\" and not enough on a plan. Do you want to push early? Do youw ant to turtle up and farm? Do you want to have gank oriented game? Are there any timings you want to meet?\n\nLast but not least, stick to something and get good at it, don't be bouncing all overt he place, have the same players play the same 1 or 2 positions, focussing on 3 or so heroes for each position with a similar gameplan each game.\n\nTo give you an example, when I play with my mates we play an aggressive early game focussing on putting the enemy on the backfoot by roaming, dewarding and ganking. The goal of this earlygame is to get several blinks a forcestaff and a mek up as major items. We aim for about 15 minutes for these major items to come out. At this point we transition into heavy pushing with the aim of snowballing on the towergold.\n\nA typical draft for us would be something like:\n\n&gt;Enigma mid getting a blink\n\n&gt;Furion woods getting a mek\n\n&gt;Timber offlaning getting a blink\n\n&gt;Gyro safelane with a cm support\n\n\nIs this the best lineup possible? Probably not.\nDoes it fit into our gameplan? Yes, very much so. Good early game aggression that transitions well into big fights around towers.\nDoes this mean we always win? Of course not.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407276606", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A good amount of blues is based on a '12 bar blues' progression. This type of progression is a pattern of certain chords in whichever key you chose, particularly the I, IV, and V chords. The pattern is typically:\n\nI I I I   (Four bars of I)\n\nIV IV I I  (two bars of IV followed by two bars of I)\n\nV IV I I   ( one bar of V, one of IV, the end with two of I, or alternatively, sometimes the last bar can be an additional bar of IV)\n\nJust in case you, or others don't know what this means, the I, IV, and V chords are chords rooted on the 1st, 4th, and 5th note of the scale of the key you've chosen. For example, in the key of C, you'd have the following major scale:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nIn this key, the 1, or 'tonic' of the scale is C. The 4, or 'subdominant' chord, is an F, and the 5, or 'dominant' chord is a G. \n\nto put this in the form of your 12 bar blues progression (aka I-IV-V progression), you'd end up with these twelve measures of music:\n\nC C C C \n\nF F C C \n\nG F C C\n\nyou'll probably notice that if you were to play this progression using, say, simply 4 equal quarter note length strums per bar, that the rhythm will sound instantly familiar, and very bluesy. \n\nFor a simple melody structure on top of your rhythm, you can feel free to mess around however you like in the minor pentatonic scale of the key you chose, in the case of this example, C minor pentatonic, and anything you do will sound pretty good most likely. \n\nHowever, if you'd like a typical blues-y structure to follow, a ubiquitous one is the following melody structure. Think of your 12 bars as three sections of 4 bars each. \n\nFirst 4:\nplay a line of melody over the first two bars. Follow this up by resting for 2 bars. \n\nSecond 4:\nPlay the same thing you did on the first 2 bars again. \nRest for another two bars. \n\nThird 4:\nPlay a variation of the first melody for two bars. \nRest for the final two bars. \n\nNot trying to promote myself or toot my own horn or anything, since there's nothing really to toot, I just coincidentally happened to have these on hand because of a coursera music class i did for fun, here are some simple examples of the 12 bar blues structure/melodies:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tyler-edwards-21/blue-guitar-blues\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tyler-edwards-21/12-bar-blues\n\nAnd of course, a classic and famous example:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1QRTHHlJ-I\n\nPretty simple stuff, all things considered, but provides a vital backbone to many blues songs over the decades. Mess around with it as much as you like, and have fun :)\n\nEdits: Formatting\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407284908", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There is absolutely a different technique.  In fact, there are several dozen techniques used to approach a marching snare here in the US. As there is in a a million other things, there are several ways to accomplish the same thing. Hence why some people might use the same across instruments.\n\nWhen asking to learn marching snare drum technique, you're going to get a severe overload of information, and quite possibly conflicting if you talk to many people (which is okay with an open mind). Marching snare drum (and other marching instruments) is a massive rabbit hole of research annd practice due to drumcorps, as many groups work with members and staff of DCI/DCA groups. In fact, two of my friends (one is an old student) are currently finishing up a season with the Madison Scouts, and I couldn't be more proud. So when you ask about what you need to learn to pick up marching snare, my answer is \"it depends.\" It depends on where you plan on playing, what you plan on playing, and how far you plan on going.\n\nTo begin, I recommend learning traditional grip (as most snare drum lines today still play that way). But when you're learning, be sure to realize what motions your hands/wrists need to be doing to successfully manipulate the stick. In the way I teach, your right hand should hinge off the two main wrist bones (like a cupboard door or something), and your left hand should rotate around the two main wrist bones (a motion similar to opening a circular door knob). Next, the left stick should be resting on or near the ring finger nail, and your index on top, leaving your bird finder hanging out. Right hand should grip the stick at the balance point evenly with thumb and index finger, wrapping the rest of the fingers on the stick (loosely, but firmly). Then incorporate the wrist motions described earlier. \n\nAfter you get the hang of what the hands and wrists need to be doing, start playing something easy and slow. I recommend \"8 on a hand.\" It's just eighth notes straight for eight measures, alternating hands each bar (R R R R R R R R, L L L L L L L L, etc). What you want to be watching out for is rebounding the stick and controlling the stick. Do this for several hours to really get the feel.\n\nAnd before you ever play a note, make sure you are using a metronome. Snare drum lines have to train themselves to play like everybody else. EXACTLY like everybody else. Assuming best conditions, it's still nearly impossible. So the common (and most reasonable) solution is to train each player to interpret time as closely to machine perfect as possible. It's also ideal fro drum set players too. All the pros use a \"click track\" of some kind. \n\nAnyway, that's my input on beginning snare drum, should you choose to ignore it or use it. There are several other opinions and methods, but mine is vague enough (although seemingly detailed) to scoot you in the right direction. I hope this helps you out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407334522", "subreddit": "drumline", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Obligatory Erik Naggum:\n\n\n\n\\* ; ; ; h e l m e r . . . &lt;assembl...@t-three.com&gt;\n&gt; I have been slowly learning lisp over the past year and have had someone\n&gt; mention to me that I should learn perl, for jobs etc.\n\n  the unemployed programmer had a problem.  \"I know\", said the programmer,\n  \"I'll just learn perl.\"  the unemployed programmer now had two problems.\n\n  having a job is not unimportant, but if knowing perl is a requirement for\n  a particular job, consider another one before taking that one.  this is\n  true even if you know perl very well.  life is too long to be an expert\n  at harmful things, including such evilness as C++ and perl.\n\n  I once studied perl enough to read perl code and spot bugs in other\n  people's programs (but later gained the wisdom that this was not an\n  accomplishment -- spotting a bug in a perl program is like spotting the\n  dog that brought the fleas), but I don't write in it and I don't ever\n  plan to use it for anything (part of my new position is quality assurance\n  for the systems I'm inheriting responsibility for, and part of any\n  serious QA is removing perl code the same way you go over a dilapidated\n  building you inherit to remove chewing gum and duct tape and fix whatever\n  was kept together for real).  also, very much unlike any other language I\n  have ever studied, perl has failed to stick to memory, a phenomenon that\n  has actually puzzled me, but I guess there are some things that are so\n  gross you just have to forget, or it'll destroy something with you.  perl\n  is the first such thing I have known.\n\n  this is your brain.  this is perl.  this is your brain on perl.  any\n  questions?\n\n&gt; If I learn lisp well will I be able to do what people do with perl[?]\n\n  no, you won't.  however, there is a very important clue to be had from\n  this: what people do with perl is wrong.  perl makes a whole lot of tasks\n  easy to do, but if you look closely, you will see that those tasks are\n  fundamentally braindamaged, and should never have been initiated.  perl\n  is perhaps the best example I can think of for a theory I have on the\n  ills of optimization and the design choices people make.  most people,\n  when faced with a problem, will not investigate the cause of the problem,\n  but will instead want to solve it because the problem is actually in the\n  way of something more important than figuring out why something suddenly\n  got in their way out of nowhere.  if you are a programmer, you may reach\n  for perl at this point, and perl can remove your problem.  happy, you go\n  on, but find another problem blocking your way, requiring more perl --\n  the perl programmer who veers off the road into the forest will get out\n  of his car and cut down each and every tree that blocks his progress,\n  then drive a few meters and repeat the whole process.  whether he gets\n  where he wanted to go or not is immaterial -- a perl programmer will\n  happily keep moving forward and look busy.  getting a perl programmer\n  back on the road is a managerial responsibility, and it can be very hard:\n  the perl programmer is very good at solving his own problems and assure\n  you that he's on the right track -- he looks like any other programmer\n  who is stuck, and this happens to all of us, but the perl programmer is\n  very different in one crucial capacity: the tool is causing the problems,\n  and unlike other programmers who discover the cause of the problem sooner\n  or later and try something else, perl is rewarding the programmer with a\n  very strong sense of control and accomplishment that a perl programmer\n  does _not_ try something else.\n\n  it's not that perl programmers are idiots, it's that the language rewards\n  idiotic behavior in a way that no other language or tool has ever done,\n  and on top of it, it punishes conscientiousness and quality craftsmanship\n  -- put simply: you can commit any dirty hack in a few minutes in perl,\n  but you can't write an elegant, maintainabale program that becomes an\n  asset to both you and your employer; you can make something work, but you\n  can't really figure out its complete set of failure modes and conditions\n  of failure.  (how do you tell when a regexp has a false positive match?)\n\n  a person's behavior is shaped by the rewards and the punishment he has\n  received while not thinking about his own actions.  few people habitually\n  engage in the introspection necessary to break out of this \"social\n  programming\" or decide to ignore the signals that other people send them,\n  so this is a powerful mechanism for programming the unthinking masses.\n  rewarding idiotic behavior and punishing smart behavior effectively\n  brainwashes people, destroying their value systems and their trust in\n  their own understanding and appreciation of the world they live in, but\n  if you're very good at it, you can create a new world for them in which\n  all of this makes sense.\n\n  to really destroy any useful concepts of how software is supposed to work\n  together, for instance, the best possible way is to ridicule the simple\n  and straightforward concepts inherent in Lisp's read and print syntax,\n  then ridicule the overly complex and entangled concepts in stuff like IDL\n  and CORBA, which does basically the same thing as Lisp's simple syntax,\n  and then hail the randomness of various programs that output junk data,\n  because you can easily massage the data into the randomness that some\n  other program accepts as input.  instead of having syntax-driven data\n  sharing between programs, you have code-driven glue between programs, and\n  because you are brainwashed perl idiot, this is an improvement, mostly to\n  your job security.  and once you start down this path, every move forward\n  is a lot cheaper than any actual improvements to the system that would\n  _obviate_ the need for more glue code.  however, if you never start down\n  this path, you have a chance of making relevant and important changes.\n\n  that's why, if you learn Lisp and become a good programmer, you will\n  never want to do what people do with perl.  as such a good programmer,\n  one in five managers will notice that you solve problems differently and\n  will want to hire you to clean up after the perl programmers he used to\n  be mortally afraid of firing, and you can push any language you want at\n  this point -- just make sure you can find more programmers he can hire\n  who know it and always keep your code well-documented and readable -- you\n  do _not_ want to make any other programming language appear as random as\n  perl to any manager.  perl is already a \"necessary evil\", but still evil,\n  while other languages don't have the \"necessary\" label, so if you screw\n  up, it will hurt other programmers, too.  this problem can always be\n  minimized by simply being good at what you do.  few perl programmers are\n  actually good at anything but getting perl to solve their _immediate_\n  problems, so you have an incredible advantage if you're a good Lisper.\n\n  I'll concede, however, that it is very important to be able to understand\n  what perl programmers do.  if you don't understand what they are talking\n  about, you won't understand what they are actually trying to accomplish\n  with all the incredibly braindamaged uses of hash tables and syntactic\n  sadomasochism, and you won't be able to see through their charades and\n  \"just one more hack, and I'll be there\" lies.\n\n  here's a simple rule to use on perl programmers.  if a solution is clean\n  and complete, it will immediately look like a tremendous amount of work\n  to a perl programmer, which it will: writing code that does the right\n  thing in perl is incredibly arduous.  this is the only positive use for\n  perl programmers.  like a really bad horror movie, where the evil guys\n  have no redeeming qualities whatsoever and will hate anything beautiful\n  or good, a true perl programmer will have a strong emotional reaction to\n  any really good solution: there's no way he can improve on it with his\n  perl hackery, and the very existence of his expertise is threatened.\n\n  then there are good programmers who know and use perl for some tasks, but\n  more than anything else know when _not_ to use it.  they are _very_ rare.\n\n\\#:Erik\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407352273", "subreddit": "programmingcirclejerk", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Mine is cookie dough:\n\nLong ago, when MandingoIsMyIdol was just a small child, he visited his aunt's house during the summer. Now first, let me tell you about the climate over there. It's often dry, hot, and during that time of year, everything outside of weeds is dead or close to it. My  aunt is quite the character. At this time, she was married to her third husband, and had two girls. They were a bit older, more cunning, and devious than I was at this time. I believe it was easily into the 100's on that particular day. My aunt's husband was away for the weekend, so the house was left to the five of us. Right as we all finished lunch, we had noticed the A/C had been shut off. Much to my dismay, there was nothing my aunt could do about it, even after numerous calls to her provider. She decided then that it was a good time to go into town to buy groceries for the following days, leaving me alone in the house with my bitchy cousins. Another thing about my cousins: they are spoiled rotten. Before my Aunt left, they begged and begged if they could make a batch of green sugar cookies. Don't ask me why they wanted them green, I assume they were just intrigued with food coloring. She caves and ends up giving them the recipe. Then, her dumb ass leaves. So, they were left alone to make the cookie dough. All seemed well as they proceeded throughout the process. However, before they poured it, they decided it would be a good idea for me to take part in the nonsense. They convinced my younger and more gullible self to eat a couple spoonfuls of the delicious green sugary goodness. While I was young, I didn't realize the risks that came with eating such a large dosage, and in the next five minutes, my bowels would begin to rue my previous decisions. Everyone in the room heard the magnificent rumbling of my stomach. And as I ran to the nearest bathroom, I could hear the echoes of my cousins' cackling bouncing off the walls. If I could sum up the following hour in one word, 'nightmare' would be closest to reality. Soon after I entered the box of despair that was the bathroom, I realized how much of a mistake it was:\n\nThere were no windows.\nThe A/C was out.\n\nDefinitely worst of all: \nThe toilet was broken. \n\nLet's just think about that for a second. \nB R O K E N\nOhhhh yes it was as broken as my heart and my digestive system at that moment. So as my bottom half is spewing out molten green lava, my cousins are outside having the time of their lives, laughing and enjoying the fact that poor MandingoIsMyIdol is suffocating on a figurative shitstorm possibly as soupy and thick as the smog in Beijing.\n\nThose fuckers locked me in that room. \n\nWith no way out, and nausea starting to get the better of me, I looked around for something other than a toilet to vomit into. \nI then spotted the trashcan, dumped the contents on the floor, and regurgitated my weak little soul into my only source of containment. I asked The Lord above, \"Why?\" And tried to answer the question myself. My dumb cousins probably used bad eggs or milk or something, but that wasn't the point. The point was that an army of shit equivalent to the power of gandalf the white and the riders of Rohan were charging full speed down helms deep and out of my poor, burning asshole; and my esophagus had suddenly transformed into the violently erupting Mt. Doom. Unfortunately for me, no battle was won in my colon, or my esophagus that day. I didn't have a Frodo and Sam. Not even close. My cousins finally unlocked the door after they heard my aunt arrive home, and I soon emerged from that room a POW freed from gaseous captivity. And like that POW, PTSD from the regurgitative swamps of that prison keep me from looking back and eating such dough again.

{"body": "I don't like renewal one bit, mostly because of the PvM changes. I have a lot of opinions about how Ragnarok PVP can be completely balanced, but until the game is open sourced, I won't really get into it because it's just wishing for something that will never happen. For PVP renewal is okay, but overall a step in the wrong direction. I quit PVPing and doing WoE long before this change was made.\n\nI was on iRO Chaos, in the Deity guild. My IGN was V i v i d (Sniper) and I played a lot of other alts too - I'm mostly known for the Lord Knight George Costanza, which was a 99 AGI 99 DEX clashing spiral Knight based on a party with a 130 INT bard. I'm also known for the scholar Wikipedia and my bard Harpsicode. Here's a few links to some of my YouTube uploads:\n\n[One of my matches at RWC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyqwkGEYnvk) - I'm the farthest guy on the left sitting at the edge of the table when you first see the the camera man panning over team USA. If you're familiar with Deity, Vince Jadefrost is directly to the right of me (he's sitting to my left).\n\n[Leveling my sniper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKdbEBSwcMw) - This is by far my most popular video, despite me spending literally 10 minutes making this video (I just mashed up a few mediocre clips of my leveling strategy and posted it, got instant 100k pretty much)...\n\n[Killing Valkyrie MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6by8P0T6-Y) - Valkyrie eventually got harder, but during this time we were allied with the DC guild to kill this MVP since they needed us and we wanted to have a large advantage over the other competition. I literally killed this MVP every 8 hours for 3 months straight, except when the spawn time fell during a WoE.\n\n[Leveling up George Costanza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cYUGatziDM) - I leveled this Lord Knight only on MVPs. There was a bug where Clashing Spiral would stun mobs for 1 second, even if they were a boss. 100% of Lord Knights before George Costanza couldn't do clashing spiral more than once per second, because they didn't have enough AGI to reduce their animation delay enough. His DPS was absolutely crazy on these bosses, and he could keep them stunned forever, meaning we didn't need to have a tank or DPS or any crazy Ice Wall + ME / Safety Wall setup going on. Not sure how familiar you are with high-end MVPing but it essentially comes down to abusing game mechanics as much as possible to win as fast as possible, which we were really good at.\n\n[George Costanza as a Super Swordie!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTm8kghLj0I&amp;list=UUVLcXLtMn8DaGmEA_cTxocw) - Before he was a Lord Knight, George Costanza was a level 98 Super Swordie, and he owned face.\n\nIf you want to watch my other vids, you can check them out here - https://www.youtube.com/user/sheepiroth/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=list", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407380605", "subreddit": "gaming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "There is a safe in Bruce Wayne’s bedroom. Inside the safe are all of Batman’s goodies. The keys to the Batmobile, all of his badass gadgets, and billions of his parents hard-earned bucks.\n\nYou are a thief and you would like to break into Bruce Wayne’s safe. \n\nBut there is a catch: the safe doesn’t have a traditional key. Instead there is a grand piano in the room.\n\nIn order for the safe to be opened, Beethoven’s *Moonlight Sonata* must be played on the Grand Piano. Every note must be played perfect, in the the exact order that Beethoven wrote them. Or else the safe will not open.  The piano is capable of outputting any series of notes, but there is only one correct combination of notes to get the desired outcome. (This is just like the string of digits in my above example! You can send an infinite number of different digits to the CPU, but only one 714 digit sequence will print the world “Hello!”)\n\nNow, there are thousands of notes in the *Moonlight Sonata*, and each note is comprised of 3 smaller strings. (You may not know this, but when you strike a piano key, a hammer inside the piano hits 3 or so strings at once, resulting in one combined perceived note.)\n\n\nSo if you were a particularly masochistic thief who had all the time in the world, the most painstaking and basic way to get the safe to open would be to pop the hood of the grand piano, and start plucking strings. Three at a time, thousands and thousands of times in the correct order.\n\nThis would be like manually telling the monitor which pixels to turn black in order to create the word “Hello” on the monitor.\n\nThere has got to be a better way.  This would be exhausting, and the chances of you screwing up are practically inevitable if you are required to perform 10,000 operations manually without missing a single one.  (Remember, if you mess up even once, the output will be garbage, and the safe will not open.)\n\nSo it would be helpful if instead of having to hit three strings at once every single time, you could make a device to start hitting three strings at once.\n\nFortunately this is exactly what the black and white keys on the piano do! You strike one key, and a hammer inside hits three strings that are commonly bundled together. This is what makes a piano different than a harp or a dulcimer. Instead of hitting the strings directly, you press a white or black key, and the innards of the piano do a lot of the legwork for you.\n\nThe black and white keys are exactly like machine code! Convenient groups of commonly used operations!\n\nBy switching to using the black and white keys (machine code) instead of plucking the strings directly (0’s and 1’s) you have diminished the amount of notes you have to manually play by a third! You now only have to perform 1,000 notes! You can now lower the Grand Piano lid and play the *Moonlight Sonata* like a normal person via the black and white keys.\n\nUnfortunately, you have no idea how to play piano yourself.\n\nFortunately, your partner in crime is a Concert Pianist!\n\nBut there is a catch.\n\nThe Concert Pianist is blind. You are going to have to tell him which keys to press, one by one.\n\n\nSo in order to read the sheet music to the Concert Pianist, you are going to need to name all the keys.  A will be the first key on the piano. B will be the second key on the piano. C will be the third, and so on and so on.  Since there are 88 keys on the piano, you are going to need to borrow a few more symbols to use as letters, such as # or pi. So then you can encode any melody into a language that the blind pianist can understand.\n\nThe first line of Mary Had A Little Lamb would read something like: [E, D, C, D, E, E, E](http://youtu.be/BEum1Qt7hB4?t=33s)   The Blind Pianist would understand your instructions to srike the Fifth Key of the Piano, the Fourth Key of the Piano, the Third Key of the Piano, the Fourth Key of the Piano, the Fifth Key of the Piano, and then the Fifth Key of the Piano.\n\nWhen he hits those keys, the innerworkings of the piano does the legwork of hitting the dozens of strings inside: and ultimately you will hear the melody of Mary Had a Little Lamb\n\nTo save time, you could simplify these instructions to the Blind Pianist by condensing them to a single word: Edcdeee  \n\nThe entire content of Mary Had a Little Lamb would read:  Edcdeee ddd egg edcdeee eddedc.\n\nWhy that is practically English! \n\nThe Blind Pianist is like the Programming Language. He is able to convert plain English into Machine Code!\nThe last thing you need to know is that the names for the notes/operations on the piano are completely arbitary. Yes, the first line of Mary Had A Little Lamb can be encoded as:\n\n\t\t\tE d c d e e\n\nBut it could just as well be called  \n\n\t\t\t&amp; % $ % &amp; &amp; &amp;\n\nOr\n\n\t\t\tHELLO Cout &lt; Cout HELLO HELLO HELLO\n\nor any other set of symbols as long as it was agreed upon that\n\n\t“HELLO” will always = the fifth note on the piano\n\t“Cout” will always = the fourth note on the piano\n\t“&lt;“ will always = the third note on the piano So back to Batman’s safe\n\nYou are able to input a string of raw English grammar to the Blind Pianist (“Edcdee”)\n\nThe Blind Pianist is able to convert the English into Machine Code.  (playing the black and white keys)\n\nThe Piano Itself accepts the Machine code and knows which strings to strike (0, 1)\n\t\t\n\n\nAs long as you are super careful with this index of definitions, you are able to input the English correctly to the Blind Pianist (The entire text of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata)  The single correct melody will emanate from the piano strings, and Batman’s safe will open! \n\nYou have essentially used English to find a specific, long sequence.\n\n And as I described briefly in my computer monitor example, every problem can be reduced to finding a single super long number. \n\n\n**Fellow computer scientists, please excuse my broad generalizations...It is very difficult to communicate to non-CS folks how abstractions can be built on top of abstractions on top of abstractions**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407381410", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The age I was when I had my first crush was about 10 years old. It was a girl named Lilly. Lilly was brown haired, green eyed, and was a little tall for our age. I don't know why, but I liked that she was tall. Lilly was very smart, she had almost all advanced grades, only some proficients (this was back in elementary, so they had minimal, basic, proficient, and advanced instead of A B C D and F) and she was in student council. To try and get her to like me, I attempted to smarten myself up, unfortunately, that didn't work. So instead I joined student council and sat next to her during my first meeting.\n\n\n\nRight before the meeting started I tried to talk to her, but I couldn't think of anything to say. So the meeting started without me being able to really get her to her to talk to me. During the meeting we talked about normal things, it was so long ago that I don't remember too many details, but I do remember that we were talking about a fundraiser the school was having. It was a cookie dough sale, cause who doesn't love cookies. \n\n\n\nEvery time they were talking about other things, Lilly would raise her hand and she had great ideas everytime. She even suggested the great idea of a school store (we didn't have one at that time, don't know how many schools had one). She could have been leading the council with absolutely no help of adults, and it probably would have done even better. So the council went on talking about more ideas and such, but I wasn't paying attention, I was looking at Lilly. At the end they told everyone that they would give out cookie dough order forms next week.\n\n\n\nEveryone was leaving to go home, so I tried to talk to Lilly again, and words actually came out those time. I ended up walking home with her, and we talked the whole time. She was a lot more interesting than I had previously thought. She sometimes volunteered with her mom at an animal shelter in the neighboring city. Lilly was an over all amazing girl, and i would be lucky if she would end up even liking me a little. \n\n\n\nFor the next couple days me and her talked a whole bunch, we were becoming good friends. I learned alot about her in those couple days, more than most people learn about their friends in a month. She had a rough child hood, almost all her family was dead, then her parents died in a car crash. She was lucky she was adopted and not just stuck in the system. Her adoptive parents were really into aquatic animals and she loved spending time in water. Lilly was even lucky enough to have an I ground pool in her backyard!\n\n\n\nI was able to get a seat next to her again at the next council meeting, it was about 2 months after my first meeting, and they talked about the sales from the cookie dough fundraiser. They sold a lot more than they expected so there was no need for another fundraiser for a while. There was a new kid who joined council and was introduced to us, his name was Donovan. \n\n\n\nDonovan had become Lilly and me's new friend, and unfortunately she had started liking Donovan more than me. Now that i think back, Donovan was a better kid than me, so I don't exactly blame her for liking him, but I was angry at the time.\n\n\n\n\nDonovan and Lilly were so close to dating that I essentially was a third wheel. Lucky me, Donovan's dad got a great new job in a different state, so he moved away. It was back to me and Lilly, and it was obvious she had started to like me. We spent alot more time together and a lot of times she had gotten really close to me. I eventually got to date her, I even got my very first kiss from her!\n\n\n\nYou may have experienced a something similar, but here is what completely sets mine apart from all others. While I was at her house, we were watching a movie, this was during the two of us dating. I had leaned in for a kiss, but before she kissed me, she said she needed something. When I asked what she needed, Lilly told me to read the first letter of each paragraph , and it was about then that I realized that Lilly was a 5 story crustacean from the Paleolithic era!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407388520", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

For what would it avail thee should I recount the deeds of those whom I indeed may know, but thou not? Thou knowest well how I keep me from all Taint of Fable, or any Word unproven and undemonstrable. First then I speak of Lao-Tze, whose word was the Tao. Hereof have I already written much unto thee, because His Doctrine has been lost or misinterpreted, and it is most needful to restore it. For this Tao is the true Nature of Things, being itself a Way or Going, that is, a kinetic and not a static Conception. Also He taught this Way of Harmony in Will, which I myself have thought to show thee in this little book. So then this Tao is Truth, and the Way of Truth, and therefore was He Logos of His Aeon, and His true Name or Word was Tao.\n\n\n&gt; 70: Βϟ.\n\n&gt;DE GAUTAMA.\n\n&gt; (Of Gautama)\n\n&gt; Whom Men call Gotama, or Siddartha, or the Budha, was a Magus of our Holy Order. And His Word was Anatta; for the Root of His whole Doctrine was that there is no Atman, or Soul, as Men ill translate it, meaning a Substance incapable of Change. Thus, He, like Lao-Tze, based all upon a Movement, instead of a fixed Point. And His Way of Truth was Analysis, made possible by great Intention of the Mind toward itself, and that well fortified by certain tempered Rigour of Life. And He most thoroughly explored and Mapped out the Fastnesses of the Mind, and gave the Keys of its Fortresses into the Hand of Man. But of all this the Quintessence is in this one Word Anatta, because this is not only the foundation and the Result of his whole Doctrine, but the Way of its Work.\n\n&gt; 71: Βρ. \n\n&gt;DE SRI KRISHNA ET DE DIONYSO.\n\n&gt; (Of Sri Krishna, and of Dionysus)\n\n&gt; Krishna has Names and Forms innumerable, and I know not His true Human Birth, for His Formula is of the Major Antiquity. But His Word hath spread into many Lands, and we know it to- day as INRI with the secret IAO concealed therein. And the Meaning of this Word is the Working of Nature in Her Changes; that is, it is the Formula of Magick whereby all Things reproduce and recreate themselves. Yet this Extension and Specialisation was rather the Word of Dionysus; for the true Word of Krishna was AUM, importing rather a Statement of the Truth of Nature than a practical Instruction in detailed Operations of Magick. But Dionysus, by the Word INRI, laid the Foundation of all Science, as We say Science to-day in a particular Sense, that is, of causing external Nature to change in Harmony with our Wills.\n\n&gt; 72: Βσ. \n\n&gt; DE TAHUTI.\n\n&gt; (Of Tahuti)\n\n&gt; Tahuti, or Thoth, confirmed the Word of Dionysus by continuing it; for he showed how by the Mind it was possible to direct the Operations of the Will. By Criticism and by recorded Memory Man avoideth Error. But the true Word of Tahuti was A M O U N, whereby He made Men to understand their secret Nature, that is, their Unity with their true Selves, or, as they then phrased it, with God. And He discovered unto them the Way of this Attainment, and its Relation with the Formula of INRI. Also by His Mystery of Number He made plain the Path for His Successor to declare the Nature of the whole Universe in its Form and in its Structure, as it were an Analysis thereof, doing for Matter what the Buddha was decreed to do for Mind.\n\n \n\n&gt; 73: Βτ. \n\n&gt;DE QUODAMM MAGO AEGYPTIORUM. QUEM APPELUNT JUDAEI MOSHEH.\n\n&gt; (Of a certain Magus of the Egyptians, whom the Jews call Moses)\n\n&gt; The Follower of Tahuti was an Egyptian whose Name is lost; but the Jews called Him Mosheh, or Moses, and their Fabulists made Him the Leader of their Legendary Exodus. Yet they preserved His Word, and it is IHVH, which thou must understand also as that Secret Word which thou hast seen and heard in Thunders and Lightnings in thine Initiation to the Degree thou wottest of. But this Word is itself a Plan of the Fabrick of the Universe, and upon it hath been elaborated the Holy Qabalah, whereby we have Knowledge of the Nature of all Things soever upon every Plane of By-coming, and of their Forces and Tendencies and Operations, with the Keys to their Portals. Nor did He leave any Part of His Work unfinished, unless it be that accomplished three hundred Years ago by Sir Edward Kelly, of whom I also come, as thou knowest.\n\n\n&gt; 74: Βυ. \n\n&gt;DE MAGO ARABICO MOHAMMED.\n\n&gt; (Of the Magus of the Arabs, Mohammed)\n\n&gt; Behold! In these Chapters have I, thy Father, restricted myself, not speaking of any immediate Echo of a Word in the World, because, there Men being long since withdrawn into their Silence, it is their One Word, and that Alone, that resoundeth undiminished through Time. How Mohammed, who followeth, is darkened and confused by His Nearness to our own Time, so that I say not save with Diffidence that His Word ALLH may mean this or that. But I am bold concerning His Doctrine of the Unity of God, for God is Man, and he said therefore: Man is One. And His Will was to unite all Men in One reasonable Faith: to make possible international Co- operation in Science. Yet, because He arose in the Time of the greatest possible Corruption and Darkness, when every Civilisation and Every Religion had fallen into Ruin, by the malice of the great Sorcerer of Nazareth, as some say, He is still hidden in the Dust of the Simoom, and we may not perceive Him in His true Self of Glory.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, behold, o My Son, this Mystery. His true Word was La ALLH, that is to say: (there is) No God, and LA AL is that Mystery of Mysteries which thine own Eye pierced in thine Initiation. And of that Truth have the Illusion and Falsehood enslaved the Souls of Men, as is written in the Book of the Magus.\n\n&gt; 75: Βφ. \n\n&gt;DE SE IPSO ΩΙ ΜΕΓΑΛΩΙ ΘΡΙΩΙ, ΩΙ ΛΟΓΩΙ ΑΙΩΝΟΣ CUJUS VERBUM EST ΘΕΛΜΑ.\n\n&gt; (Of Himself, The Great Beast, the Logos of the Aeon, whose word is THELEMA)\n\n&gt; O my son! me seemeth in certain Hours that I am myself fallen on a Time even more fearful and fatal than did Mahommed, peace be upon Him! But I read clearly the Word of the Aeon, that is A B R A H A D A B R A, wherein is the whole Mystery of the great Work, as thou knowest. And I have \"The Book of the Law\", that was given unto me by Him thou wottest of; and it is the Interpretation of the Secret Will of Man on every Plane of his By-coming; and the Word of the Law is T H E L E M A. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" Now because \"Love is the law, love under will.\" do I write this Epistle for thee, that thou mayst fulfil this inmost Will of Mankind, making them capable of Light, Live, Love and Liberty by the Acceptance of this Law. And the Hindrance thereunto is but as the Shell of its Egg to an Eaglet, ad Thing foreign to itself, a Protection till the Hour strike, and then — no more!\n\n---\n\n&gt; 120: Δο \n\n&gt; DE RECTO IN RECTO\n\n&gt; (Of Virtue in the Worthless)\n\n&gt; Now also then I bid thee use all filial Diligence, and attend to this same Word in the Mouth of thine earliest Ancestor (except we adventure to invoke the Name F U  -  H S I) in our known Genealogy, the Most Holy, the True Man, Lao- Tze, that gave His Light unto the Kingdom of Flowers. For being questioned concerning the abode of the Tao, he gave Answer that It was in the Dung. Again, the Tathagata, the Buddha, most blessed, most perfect and most enlightened, added His Voice, that there is no Grain of Dust which shall not attain to the Arhan. Keep therefore in just Balance the Relation of Illusion to Illusion in that Aspect of Illusion, neither confusing the Planes, nor confounding the Stars, nor denying the Laws of their Reaction, yet with Eagle's Vision beholding the One Sun of the True Nature of the Whole. Verily, this is the Truth, and unto it did also Dionysus and Tahuti and Sri Krishna set the seal of their Witness. Cleanse therefore thine Heart, o my son, in the Waters of the Great Sea, and enkindle it with the Fire of the Holy Ghost. For this is His peculiar Work of Sanctification.\n\n--Liber Aleph", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407435443", "subreddit": "occult", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In the original problem, you are given a key and that key's hash when run through the hashing algorithm. The actual algorithm itself is unimportant -- don't dwell on it. What is important is that the hash translates to the index of the array, and we can already see collisions. We also know that we are going to use linear probing, so we know how to resolve these collisions.\n\nHere's an example. Let's start by placing the keys that we know will collide first:\n\n    [0][1][2][3][4][5][6]\n     L  N  A  H  W  C  Z   (Insertion order: Z L A H N W C)\n     L  N  H  A  W  C  Z   (Insertion order: Z L H A N W C)\n     Z  N  A  H  W  C  L   (Insertion order: L Z A H N W C)\n     Z  N  H  A  W  C  L   (Insertion order: L Z H A N W C)\n\nHowever, because these keys can be inserted in any order, there is still the possibility that we start with W, and place it at index 3. We can get an entirely different hash table this way. For instance, let's say we inserted the keys in this order: W A H C L Z N. The resulting hash table would look like this:\n\n    [0][1][2][3][4][5][6]\n     Z  N  A  W  H  C  L\n\nI hope that's enough to set you on the right path.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407458367", "subreddit": "compsci", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wow - 5 hours focused on just these topics? No wonder you are frustrated. But I applaud your dedication! Your SD is lucky to have someone so dedicated to her well being on her side. \n\nSo questions...did the school ask you to have the children ready by knowing their ABCs and numbers 1-20? And whether or not it is school requested, what does this mean exactly? Is it know the alphabet song only, or is there recognition of letter shapes having meaning and sound also?  Is she pairing counting with tangible numbers of objects or written numbers, or is is merely counting? Also, how intellectually stimulating was her life with her mom?\n\nI ask about the detail, because some of these goals are benchmarks for a kindergarten curriculum (I used Illinois for example, but all states should be similar. http://www.isbe.state.il.us/earlychi/pdf/iel_standards.pdf ). She has a whole year to learn these things through a variety of methods, and even to catch up if she starts out behind. Also for now, the alphabet and counting are likely abstract concepts for her. It is totally normal for kids to make mistakes when they are just parroting back songs and sequences of words. \n\nIf you've recently gotten full custody too, she is likely still getting adjusted to the change. She might be overwhelmed in general. Also, if she didn't have an educationally stimulating environment before  the custody change, this all will be brandy new to her. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend that you cut both of you some slack! Her inability to retain info at this point is not a reflection on you :) and 5 hours of drilling at once...if you're this frustrated, her little 5 year old attention span must be completely tapped. \n\nHave her watch Sesame Street or other educational programming. Spend no more than 20 minutes at a time on a topic, and when you do,  make it fun. Do a letter-related art project: cut out the letters in her name from construction paper and have her glitter them. Hang them on a wall on a string with clothespins and every day, once, spell it out \"S A R A H - Sarah! That you, lovebug!\" And leave it at that. Count things out loud whenever you can in a casual way so she can learn by observation. Count her grapes at snack time. If she can only count to 10, count to 10 twice and then to 20. Or do 4 groups of 5 even. Or count pieces of cheese. Or blocks or teddy bears. You get the idea. \n\nThe point is, you can only did so much in a few weeks. You've both already been through so many changes recently that are potentially overwhelming on their own, so just let go and let it be what it is for the moment. Make learning fun and casual for now, and give school a few weeks before you, in collaboration with her teachers, take her for testing. Talk to her teachers and let them know your concerns for now so they can be aware and later provide insight. \n\nYou are clearly on your SD's side and dedicated to her success. She is lucky to have a dedicated, strong stepparent looking out for her. But you don't have to - and likely can't! - fix it all overnight. Don't wear yourself out, try to make learning fun, interactive, less of a chore, and give it just a little more time and space :).

{"body": "You could make a \"key\" that is one solid strip of plastic that is see-through to IR.  That is to say, it is 100% \"holes\".  But you make them in such a way that you can easily attach blocking parts.  If you can get access to the physical key and know where the holes are, you can just block the right parts.  \n\nFrom one of the pages linked below, one way to find the holes is to hold it up to a flashlight.  The holes will create little red dots on the surface below, at which point you can take a picture and go fabricate a key on your own time.  Just as effective as taking a picture of a normal tumbler lock  key, but you  have to pay special attention to perspective so you get the distances between holes correct.\n\nAlso, the middle strip is completely \"open\" as one person in the links stated, which seems to help identify the hole locations.  He also stated these keys encode 24 bits of information.  Assuming all of that's  true, the top and bottom strips each have 12 possible hole locations.  Depending on what is meant by the middle being completely \"open\", when you shine a light through it, you might actually see 12 dots.  That would make recreating a key from a picture far easier.  \n\nIf you made a key that had a \"rail\" of sorts for the top and bottom strips, you could create a key on-the-fly with up to 48 blocks of plastic that block IR or are transparent to IR.  However, another person lower in the comments noted that these keys become unreliable after a year or so, and blamed wear and tear on the plastic parts.  If that's true, having 12 blocks of plastic on top and bottom might actually screw up the sensors.  It's hard to say.\n\nImagine a shaft kind of like this:\n\n    | i i i i i i i i i i i i \n    | =======================\n    | ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;\n\nWhere the 'i's and ';' are little spikes that can lock in an IR transparent or IR blocking block.  The '='s are the center shaft that are all IR \"holes\".  \n\nThere's many possibilities, but since these types of locks seem to be discontinued I'd say it's moot speculating.  All of these ideas I thought up happened on the spot in the here and now, though.  If I had my hands on an actual system that I could test, I'm sure I could come up with a nifty way of breaking them in a week or so that would be relatively quick to do in-person.\n\nI think one thing that people forget when it comes to breaking locks is that the thing breaking the lock isn't required to look or function like the thing that opens the lock.  Torsion wrenches, diamond  picks, etc don't look anything like keys but they can pop tumbler locks in seconds.  A soda can doesn't know your MasterLock(tm) combo but it could pop one open in seconds(I think newer MasterLocks are designed so this isn't as effective, but w/e).

{"body": "Circa 5th or 6th grade. \nMy 'girlfriend', if that's what you could call it, at the time was/is beyond beautiful and to say I was a bit nervous to kiss her would be downplaying my nervousness on an astronomical level. Now, as bf/gf, we thought we were in love and would be together forever and all that bullshit, although we would rarely hang out outside of school/school events, we would talk ALOT. We talked about kissing every now and then, but didn't want our 'first' to be in school because, you know, the mood wouldn't be right.. \nSuddenly a wild school dance appears! \nWe decided to go together and by go together, I mean meet each other there and awkwardly avoid one another until we are forced to interact. This dance was a classic, in that, all the guys stuck to one side, all the girls were on the other and you had a few random weird kids dancing by themselves in the middle... After a few drinks of punch, everyone started to relax a little and dance - around this time, rumors were flying everywhere that tonight would be the night I would kiss my girlfriend, whom I have only said a total of 9 words to that night. With everyone asking me if I have done it yet,  I started to become extremely nervous and my friends began to get me pumped and just 'go in and do it'. So after getting some much needed support from my friends, I went up to her and asked her to dance to a slow song. She agreed. We were dancing for a little, most of which is a blur, due to the fact the only thoughts running through my head were 'holy fuck' 'don't mess this up' 'you gotta do this, be a man' 'holy fucking shit' 'is this real?!'. Being the extremely smooth guy that I am, I tried to talk her up and tell her how good she looked and all that shit.. As the song grew closer to an end so did my boyhood - a more upbeat song came on and I honestly thought I blew it (not yet!), she turned around to begin grinding on me, her face and mine basically brushing against each other and I grew a pair and closed my eyes and went for it...Now, let me advise everyone that you should never close your eyes on your first attempt of doing..well, anything - because let's be honest, it's probably not going to end well.. Back to the story, so I closed my eyes and went in for the kiss only to find my lips meeting the point at which the cheek begins to curve in the neck - in case you are wondering, no, this was not my intentions, I am just t h a t big of an idiot. Stunned, I really didn't know what to do, but thankfully she was extremely awesome and turned around and we began to go into a full make out session. Seconds felt like hours. After said session, we just looked at each other, smiled, then walked our opposite ways. I felt like a million bucks completely forgetting that I completely whiffed on my first attempt. My friends basically watched the whole thing happen, but seemed to miss me missing and were curious as how it went. After spilling the details and being king of the dance for making out with the hottest girl in our grade, her and I's mutual friend came up to me laughing, asking if I 'missed' because my gf had just told her I did. I denied everything, but she said my gf said I was a great kisser besides the fact I missed. I was like...well, fuck, but fuck yeah! We dated throughout school and if it weren't for me moving to another state - the possibility of us being together today is, well, I would say extremely high. Only 3 people, including myself, know I missed and thankfully it never reached the ears of my classmates - I would have been mortified. It was amazing and I wouldn't change it for the world and I am happy to now share my awkward 1st kiss story with all of reddit..

That probably didn't make much sense so I'll elaborate. The steps are all the major notes (not sharp or flat) on each string in the first position (by that I mean first three frets). Once you name a note, let's say low C then find the closest note below it that is a string, A, and count up to it, since A strings sequence is open-second-third and C is two notes higher than A (because the alphabet) then C is two steps above A or third fret on the A string. This probably sounds really tedious and it is but once you memorize the steps for each string and each strings name you will begin to internalize the process.

{"body": "An important thing to consider here is that if you want to play modally, you'll need to keep the tonic in mind. In fact you might want to keep the tonic note in the bass as much as possible, or use a chord progression that will imply that note as tonic. So for example, you could play E Phrygian (E F G A B C D E) over a C Major chord, and it would still just sound like a C Major scale with different starting and ending notes because the chord is still implying the C as the tonic note. If you really want it to sound like E Phrygian, you would play the notes over an E minor chord, because E is the tonic of E Phrygian, which is a type of minor scale.\n\nAlso, modes in general didn't really click with me until I actually tried applying it to my instrument, which happens to be the guitar. Regardless of what your instrument is, I think this exercise should help you get a grasp of the concept. \n\nTake a major scale, let's say C major just to keep it simple, but really it could be in any key you want. Play one octave (again, just to keep it simple) of the scale up and down normally, starting and ending on the C note and get the sound of that scale in your head. \n\nNow, using the exact same set of notes, start on the second note, D in this case, and play through the notes of the C major scale until you reach the D an octave higher, and then play the same thing in descending order. You should've played the notes D E F G A B C D, which is the mode of D Dorian. Even though you're using the same notes that are found in C Major, you're using D as the tonic so the other notes will relate differently to the D note than they would in C Major, and this produces a different sound. \n\nNext, go up to the third note of the C major scale, which is E, and play through the notes of the scale starting from the third note to the E an octave higher, up and down. That's E Phrygian, which is another type of minor scale with an \"exotic\" flavor.\n\nYou can keep going through this process for the rest of the modes. Just use the exact same notes found in the C Major scale, and start and end on a different one of those 7 notes each time. Modes like this that share the same set of notes are called relative modes, in pretty much exactly the same way that A minor is the relative minor scale of C major.\n\nThe relative modes of C Major are as follows:\n\n1. C Ionian/Major (CDEFGABC)\n2. D Dorian (DEFGABCD)\n3. E Phrygian (EFGABCDE)\n4. F Lydian (FGABCDEF)\n5. G Mixolydian (GABCDEFG)\n6. A Aeolian/Natural Minor (ABCDEFGA)\n7. B Locrian (BCDEFGAB)\n\nAeolian, Phrygian, and Dorian are different types of minor scales.\nIonian, Lydian, and Mixolydian are different types of major scales.\nLocrian is a type of diminished scale.\n\nThere are also parallel modes, which refers to modes that share the same tonic note but don't necessarily share all the other notes like relative modes do. Parallel modes come from different keys. So the parallel modes of a C major scale would be something like this:\n\n1. C Ionian/Major (C D E F G A B C) - key of C major\n2. C Dorian (C D Eb F G A Bb C) - key of Bb major\n3. C Phrygian (C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C) - key of Ab major\n4. C Lydian (C D E F# G A B C) - key of G major\n5. C Mixolydian (C D E F G A Bb C) - key of F major\n6. C Aeolian/Natural Minor (C D Eb F G Ab Bb C) - key of Eb major\n7. C Locrian (C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb) - key of Db major\n\nThat's ordering them in the same way we would find the relative modes of a scale, but I find with parallel modes it actually makes more sense to order them using the circle of fifths. Check it out:\n\n1. C Locrian (C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C) - key of Db major\n2. C Phrygian (C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C) - key of Ab major\n3. C Aeolian (C D Eb F G Ab Bb C) - key of Eb major\n4. C Dorian (C D Eb F G A Bb C) - key of Bb major\n5. C Mixolydian (C D E F G A Bb C) - key of F major\n6. C Ionian (C D E F G A B C) - key of C major\n7. C lydian (C D E F# G A B C) - key of G major\n\nPay attention to the notes in each one of those modes. You'll notice that to get from one mode to the next, all you need to do is change one note by one halfstep, or semitone. So you can actually try this out yourself on your instrument. Keep a C as a droning bass note, and then play through each one of the modes in that order--Locrian, Phrygian, Aeolian, Dorian, Mixolydian, Ionian, Lydian. You will only need to change one note by a halfstep to switch from one mode to the next, so it should be fairly easy to play and remember the parallel modes like that.\n\nAlso, I have an Excel document I put together recently that outlines all the modes in all keys, in the order of the circle of fifths. In addition to the names of the modes and their notes, I've also included the parent major scale, parent minor scale, diatonic harmonizations, and more. I've gotten a lot of great feedback about how well-organized and detailed it all is--there's a lot of color-coding, and it's all set up in a table that you can filter and search. It could be helpful for those just trying to learn the different modes, but also as a helpful tool for those who want to look for interesting patterns which are made readily apparent here for more advanced players and composers to explore. If anyone is interested, PM me and I'll be happy to send the file over via email.\n\nHope that helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407633755", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

And all it's really doing is allowing less time per elo gained. Also would stop from having so many smurfs if you always maintained your highest gained, and made re-calibrating your elo something crazy like 100 games. \n\nAnd ya like ranked per champion, something through the client to watch it.. reworks would reset the ladder.

{"body": "A guitar's tuning is what notes the strings are tuned to. The \"standard\" tuning is E A D G B E, it's what the vast majority of guitarists play in. It's how 90% of all guitarists play their chords and music in general.\n\nHowever, alternate tunings exist. Open tunings, like open G (D G D G B D) or open D (D A D F♯ A D), are called open tunings because without fretting the guitar, the notes form a complete chord. This allows you to make complete chords with one finger, which you can't do with standard tuning. Of course, it's a lot different, and you can't do a lot of things that you can do in standard tuning. But there's a lot you CAN do in open that you can't in standard, get me?\n\nAlternate tunings are great. Led Zeppelin's Kashmir is in an alternate tuning. 90% of Keith Richards' guitar playing is in open tuning. Playing in open also allows you to play slide guitar, which is a whole new beast, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRnzBm1wNFo) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Dhz90oJXo).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407670038", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "2011 in my opinion (i'm going down the wiki page for released albums and only talking about what I listened to so there will be missed albums, especially in metal and hardcore)\n\nThe Decemberists' The King is Dead. Their worst album, okay.\n\nAdele's 21 is a classic.\n\nIron &amp; Wine's Kiss Each Other Clean is an awful album.\n\nPJ Harvey's Let England Shake is a fantastic album. \n\nRadiohead's King of Limbs is a swing and a miss IMO but I'm not a big Radiohead fan in the first place.\n\nREM's Collapse Into Now is a pretty good album as far as middle aged rockers go.\n\nLupe Fiasco's Lasers isn't great.\n\nThe Dodos' No Color is their second best album but I swear I'm the only person who cares about The Dodos.\n\nPanic at the Disco's Vices and Virtues was too clean IMO.\n\nPanda Bear's Tomboy is a chill af album. I rather enjoy it.\n\ntUnE-yArDs' w h o k i l l is really great. \n\nFleet Foxes' Helplessness Blues isn't as great as their debut but it isn't bad by any stretch.\n\nTyler, the Creator's Goblin is mixed I guess. I like it for the most part and wouldn't say it's bad. \n\nFoster the People's Torches is really fun. \n\nThurston Moore's Demolished Thoughts is as good as an acoustic album by a noise rocker could ever be.\n\nDeath Cab's Codes and Keys is really not good.\n\nYou better not be saying Battles' Gloss Drop is a bad album.\n\nBon Iver's Bon Iver, Bon Iver (god that sounds ridiculous) is better than For Emma Forever Ago.\n\nBeyonce's 4 has some great tracks.\n\nJay and Ye's Watch The Throne has some bangers but is really uneven.\n\nMaking Mirrors by Gotye is a underrated work of art.\n\nTha Carter IV has 6 Foot 7 Foot and that's about it.\n\nI love Vows by Kimbra. \n\nThe Rip Tide by Beirut is nowhere near his heyday's material and is mediocre at best. \n\nRelax by Das Racist is bad.\n\nStrange Mercy is St. Vincent's worst album IMO which means jack shit because I still love it.\n\nHurry Up We're Dreaming by M83 is magnificent. \n\nMylo Xyloto by Coldplay is not as bad as their newest album but isn't as good as they've been. \n\nLulu. no words. Lulu is only what it is.\n\nBlue Slide Park by Mac Miller is not good. \n\nTake Care by Drake and Camp by Gambino were released on the same day. One is great the other is bad. You know which is which.\n\nDo you even 50 Words for Snow???? That album is straight gorgeous.\n\nUndun by The Roots is amazing.\n\nEl Camino by The Black Keys is pretty good.\n\nI would not say that 2011 was a particularly bad year at all.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407692180", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

My rune setup is 9 hybrid pen, armor and health seals, ap per level glyphs and Ms runes. Items are Doran health potx2 and trinket - tear - haunting guise - boots -  archangels staff -  sort boots - rabaddon - lichbane - whatever final item you need. At level 7, you can clear the caster minions with and e + r. This gives you mobility early on which is kog's weakness. It might seem risky not having mres but of their ap carry catches you anyway, you're gone. Skill order is w e e w e r max r then max e then max q. The 2 levels of w gives you safe poke early and it extremely helps you last hit from a distance. Maxing q after e gives you burst in case someone dives on you. Lichbane is, for obvious reasons, more burst which you can get pretty fast and it gives you much needed mana. \n\nI'm on my phone answering this so if you have other questions just message me.

Uniques i covered. i keep 2 of my best of each cosmic rings and medallions but i trash the useless medalions. keep one of each uru, keep sentinal appendages and relics ect. i stop picking up most common rune types after they reach 30+.\n\n5)most people will spend a few million rolling these, personally i spend 6 million on my bp and 1 on this char. This one is all luck based.\n\n6) Efficiency is king.

This is extremely character based teleport aoe chars do great lq runs melee are usually great boss grinders.\n\n9)https://forums.marvelheroes.com/categories/iron-man   change is good.\n\n10)HE is capable of good damage the problem is it is no easy feet, he is as squishy as he would be in a comic. Enchantments can be transferred for 100k and they (helas) make up a s substantial part of your dps.\n\n11)Now this is a hard one. It is all about priorities, if your crit chance is above 38% you will want crit damage but as a general rule damage is king. as for rolls you can google most items to see what they roll.\n\n12) join a good supergroup, r vengers are nice people ive played with them if you are on during australian times i could add you to A N Z A C. \n\n13) if it isn't yellow or you are searching for a very specific purple to make yellow leave it on the ground its not worth wasting time on it. i always pick up artifacts they sell for a fair few credits.

{"body": "Sure.\n\nMy hotkey setup is made by going into a normal hotkey scheme and changing almost everything, since it is meant to be grid like, but take advantage of the thumb as well.\n\n* Buildings and units are the usual q w e r t setup, with the exception made that making a drone is d, so I don't accidentially make drones when selecting lavae when I play zerg. I have the \"enable conflicting commands\" (or something like that) turned on, so I can use c for both cloak and decloak for ghosts and banshees etc. \n\n* Spells are z x c like in grid. This is a thing I have considered changing so they could be either qwe or sdf. I haven't found a good way to do it however.\n\n* Attackmove is on a. I moved this from the grid default t, because hitting a with the pinky leaves your other fingers in better positions for doing stuff than I feel hitting t with the index finger does.\n\n* Control groups: Now this is where it gets interesting. I have 1-6 normally bound, but 7-9 is bound to alt+qwe for select, alt+shift+qwe for create and shift+qwe to add to. While this requires a 2nd keypressed (hitting alt with thumb), it takes advantage of the thumb and you can move your hand less. I have at the moment 0 bound to ½(left of 1), I have experimented with TAB and caps lock too, I have not decided what is best atm.\n\n* Camera commands. I have bound location 1-4 to f1-f4 and idle workers to f5. Location 5-8 I have  bound to alt+shift+asd to create and alt+sd to select (the last I select with a side mouse button)\n\n* Space is unbound (I have been thinking of uses for it, but have not come up with any, if you have suggestions I'm listening :D. Atm I am considering rapid fire feedback) and I have removed the left windows key from the keyboard.\n\n---\n\nThis is my setup as it is now. It is by no means perfect, and the core is in theory superiour because it takes advantage of more of the keyboard. The reason I don't use the core was I can't get used to hitting both ctrl+shift with the thumb, my pinky isn't very precise, and my hand is quite small. But for anyone trying to get a real efficient setup I would recommend trying out the core.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407754316", "subreddit": "allthingsprotoss", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There is a way to optimize a team using PCA, and I was thinking a lot about this method a few months back. It is not too complicated, but requires a dataset that I do not have access to.\n\n1. This is the hard part; we need a list of the most commonly played Pokemon in the metagame, let's say Smogon OU. Let there be N pokemon. You essentially need a N x N matrix of matchup values, which indicates how well or poorly pokemons match up against each other in a 1v1 setting using typical non-gimmick movesets. How these values are assigned is the difficult part. The best way is probably by assembling a panel of 10 high level pokemon players and asking them to vote on each of the matchups.\n\n2. Next we can use principal component analysis (PCA) to find the 6 orthogonal vectors with the largest percentage of variance. Orthogonality is important in this step because you don't want multiple pokemons serving the same function (bulky water, bulky ground, dragon type DD). Simply take the amount of projections of the 6 principal components on the original N pokemons, and find the 6 pokemons with the the largest sum of projections. Or you can find the top 10-12, and perform human selection instead. If you follow these two steps, you will generate a non-role overlapping team that is a decent mathematical answer to your question.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407766034", "subreddit": "stunfisk", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

There is like half the amount of parking they actually need, so if you're going to a school function (such as meet the teacher night) you either show up thirty plus minutes before the event or you don't get a fucking parking space.\n\nGetting out of the school parking lot in the morning is a lot like playing a very dangerous game of Frogger and every day I pray to God I don't have an accident. \n\nThe intersection where I need to turn left in order to go home is also very very dangerous. Not only are they doing a shitload of construction, but there's no protected turn left. So you basically have to pull out into the middle of the intersection and pray to god nobody hits you as you run the red light in order to turn left. The cops KNOW this happens...I've seen them sit there and watch person after person do it. I hate that turn because when we first started having to go that way (there's a back way, but I'm unfamiliar with it), I would sit there waiting patiently for the line of oncoming cars to have a big enough gap for me to turn. Sometimes for up to half an hour or more with people leaning on their horns and making rude gestures behind me and it freaking terrified me.

{"body": "So I wondered into the grocery store, looking for something to munch on during the raid (yes, I am a Warcraft geek) that evening. Decided to to look for something healthy for a change and wandered into the fruit and vegetable section. There it was, a five pound bag of roasted and salted peanuts on sale for $1.99. Score! So much for healthy.\n\nFast forward to raid time. I pulled out both bottom drawers of my desk, one bag containing peanuts the other side is trash. I commence to snacking. Typical raid, bunch of people late, more trash talk than playing, arguing, fighting, etc. W R A T H guild at its finest as usual. Not me, I have turned into a peanut munching machine. At the end of another clusterfuck of a raid I notice the trash side is over flowing and the other bag is looking depleted. I feel lead in my gut as I realize I have just eaten three pounds of peanuts. I then lay down and call it a night.\n\nI awake in pain as my alarm clock goes off. Between the pain and the thought of having an accident I am scared to get up. Having no choice in the matter I start to get up and go to the bathroom, moving quickly, I notice I am a little dizzy. So here I am, still dizzy and on my throne. Nothing. I push and squeeze. Nothing. Well the saying goes, \"Shit or get off the pot.\" \n\nI grabbed a seat at my computer. My stomach has another bit of pain as I see that bag of peanuts. I'm worried now as I seem more dizzy. My insides are in pain. I am not off to a good start of the day. I have a friend that used to chat with every morning that was going to nursing school. We start chatting, I tell her I not feeling good and just general BS. I have crush on her and want to ask her whats up with being dizzy (my head is swimming by this time) but I don't want to explain the entire situation. Suddenly I start blacking out, I remember holding on to both sides of the chair trying to stay upright. It passes after a minute or two. I get up and stumble back into the the bathroom.\n\nSomehow I make it. I am now successfully on the shitter, but blacking out again. Fortunately the wall is close to the toilet, so I have the sense to rest against that so I don't fall forwards, I stay upright with asshole aimed at the water. Things are going dark as I feel the first jolt of pain. TURD INCOMING!!! It was big, it was painful, it was rock hard and surprising fast moving. I am pretty sure I heard/felt it hit bottom. I wiped, it was clean. No turd smear, blood or intestines. To say I was relived is an understatement. Best of all I felt fine, the dizziness and the pain in my gut was gone. I was pretty sure a freight train had just went through my asshole, but other than that, I was good. \n\nWell except for the whole flushing thing, that didn't go so well. Plunger not so much either. The snake managed to finish the job.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407814552", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I work at a 7 degree slant, usually, but it really depends on you. To do this, you'll need proper guidelines. I'm not entirely sure how you prepared yours, since you've either erased it or used a guideline sheet beneath your paper to do this practice piece. Most of the time, I use the latter method, with the guideline sheet underneath the paper.

{"body": "Man... most of these answers are just ridiculously overtly complicated or wrong. Not to be an ass, but, I need clarification.\n\nAre you talking about going from a C major chord (in the key of C) and using an E major chord? \n\nAre you talking about using the same chords as you would be in E major as you would be as C major?\n\nI'm assuming it's that first one.\n\nWell, I'm not entirely sure if you're familiar with it, but do you know about the *harmonic scale?*\n\nTo really know about the harmonic scale, you need to know what a leading tone is, and its function. I'm assuming you know what a tonic is.\n\nBasically, the leading tone is the note a semitone (a half-step) down from the tonic. It's B in the key of C, it's F# to G, it's G# to A, etc etc. In major keys, you will always have a leading tone.\n\nThe leading tone is important, because having a leading tone in your chord makes it really, *really* sound like it wants to resolve back to that tonic. That's why the G chord (GBD) transfers over to the C chord so well - it has the leading tone in it.\n\nNow, that's great and all, but the problem is when you get into natural minor keys. You're missing a leading tone. Look at Am\n\nA B C D E F G\n\nNotice how, between G and A, there are two whole semitones. This is natural minor. Harmonic minor raises the 7th up a half step, to create a leading tone.\n\nSo that becomes\n\nA B C D E F G#\n\nAnd now you've got a leading tone in a minor scale.\n\nIn my experience, if you're using an E major in the key of C, you're going to be going down to an Am chord. So for example, a chord progression of C, E7, Am, Am is really popular with the kind of pop music I like.\n\nLook at the notes of E. It's, \"E, G#, B.\"\n\n**Basically, you're borrowing from C major's relative harmonic minor (A minor).** \n\nDoes that answer your question adequately?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407840627", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Try resolving that E major chord into an A minor chord. :)\n\nThen try turning that into an E7 chord before you turn it into the Am.\n\nSo with leading tones, let's work again in the key of C. If you build a chord off of the leading tone in C, you get a B diminished chord. Cool thing about that is that, out of all of the chords in the key of C, that is the one chord that *most badly* wants to go to C. \n\nSo what do we learn from this? Diminished chords want to resolve to a major (or minor) chord a semitone up.\n\nSo let's go back to that G chord. G transfers really well over to C, because G is the \"dominant,\" and it includes the leading tone. Bdim is also a really good way to resolve to C (the only reason it's not used as much is because it can be *too* dissonant).\n\nSo we know that a G chord is made up of G B D. We know that a B chord is made up of B D F.\n\nI don't know if you know this, but adding the 7th onto a dominant chord is *really* common. So that G chord turns into a G B D F. Not only is it already the dominant (and it has that sexy leading tone that gives you a really strong resolution), it also contains all of the tones from the B diminished that resolve nicely to C! You also get really smooth voice leading, because that F wants to go and resolve to an E (because they're only a semitone apart and they want to resolve).\n\nNow we can take those same concepts into A harmonic minor. Add the 7th onto the dominant chord (which in this case is E major), and you get an E7. It'll sound a lot more strong than a regular E major chord, and it'll add some cool flavor. I always use my 7 on my dominant if I'm in a minor key, but really, you're the composer, so that's up to you. I like the sound, other people may favor it less.\n\nSo, \"what chords will sound good with it\" is a pretty good question.\n\nLet's look at the definition of a chord.\n\nhttp://www.musictheory.net/lessons/40\n\n\"They are created with a root, a third, and a fifth.\"\n\nI mean, yeah. My composition teacher taught me that it's actually a third stacked on top of another third. That's the \"correct\" way to think about it. But don't worry about that right now! Knowing that they're created with a root, a third, and a fifth is good enough for right now.\n\nSo if we've got a C major scale\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nWe can start on *any* note, and create a triad off of that. For example:\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A B C\n\nC major. Obvious, right?\n\nC **D** E **F** G **A** B C\n\nWe also have a D minor chord.\n\nC D E **F** G **A** B **C**\n\nAn F major chord!\n\nYou can find out every single collection of chords in a C by building a scale, and then looking at every other note in it. Forgive me if you already know this but I'm trying to set a foundation for my next point.\n\nSo, basically, as long as you keep to these chords, it's going to sound great. Though you're going to hear some chord progressions are more popular than others, and some are just blatantly going to sound better. And you're going to ask why. \n\nMusictheory.net is an amazing tool, in my opinion, if you've got an instructor. It doesn't explain things in the easiest way unless you've already got a really solid foundation of music. It could be that, or my ADHD. Either way, take a look at this.\n\nhttp://www.musictheory.net/lessons/57\n\n(Here's the lesson for the term \"cadence,\" which is super important for chord progressions: http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/55 )\n\n(Here's the lesson for \"circle progression,\" though it's not as important in my opinion: http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/56 )\n\nIf you get lazy, skip to the bottom of the \"Common Chord Progressions\" lesson, and just click on the very bottom line that reads, \"It should be noted that the charts do not have to be followed strictly...\" etc. Up will pop a chart that should be easy to read for you, of how chord progressions are supposed to work.\n\nIf you don't understand those symbols (I, ii), they're all SUPER easy!\n\nhttp://www.musictheory.net/lessons/44\n\nGood luck!

{"body": "Woops! Yeah: G A *A#/Bb* C D E F G ;) Good catch!!!\n\nI don't know much \"hip-hop guitar\", as such, but I do like guys like Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) which are good at playing \"non-scales\" on top of unorthodox chords and riffs. \n\nOn the early records, he tried to more or less mimic a DJ's scratching on a guitar by using lots of neat little tricks and effects. He used things like allen wrenches to smack and slide on the strings, octaver and pitch-shift pedals to mimic police sirens, a push-button kill switch to get a very choppy/staccato, cut in/out effect (Buckethead even has one built into his signature model Les Paul). Morello also did some drop-D tuning to get a \"thicker\", \"chunkier\" tone. \n\nWhile he definitely does use some \"real\" scales for the solos, he was also just as interested in making a cool, funky noises/sounds any way possible. It wouldn't work in most other styles, but it fits in perfectly in Hip-Hop and other, more modern and fundamentally \"electronic\" styles of music where the old \"rules\" of Chords and Scales are bent, if not thrown out entirely. \n\nCheck out guys like Jon 5 and Buckethead are a couple of other \"shredders\" that are great at playing along with very non-guitar oriented music too.

{"body": "geez dude. just delete and repost haha.  \n  \nchords, definitely chords. Start with G C D A and E. (B &amp; F are bar chords, and will be too difficult to start). Learn the shapes, memorize them.   \n  \nFocus on your finger position and technique. Only \"fret\" (press down on a string) with your finger tip, so you don't accidentally mute a surrounding string.  \n  \nPractice switching between chords. Maybe do simple chord progressions, like G - C - D and say \"hey, that sounds like _____ song.\" Feel like a badass for accidentally learning \"semi-charmed kind of life\" or any AC/DC song.  \n  \nYou should also make it a point to memorize the names of your strings - EADGBE  \n  \nNext, learn a simple major scale. Use google. Practice running this scale at different positions on the neck, using the appropriate fingers (don't just slide your first and middle finger around).  \n  \nI neglected to mention holding your pick. Don't hold it like a bitch (samuel L Jackson voice so I don't sound like a misogynist). Practice strumming, work on your rhythm. Use a metronome and strum chord progressions.   \n  \nLearn how to make bar chords. B and F, finally you can play every basic chord! A trick - when you press your first finger down to bar all 6 strings, roll it back toward the tuning pegs a bit to flatten it and press harder on the strings. Not getting enough pressure on the bar is usually the biggest challenge.  \n  \nLearn how to do power chords.  play seven nation army.  \n  \nlearn to mute your strings.  \n  \npractice alternate strumming patterns and rhythms.\n  \nNow you know your chords, go look up tabs on ultimate-guitar.com - start with easier songs, but songs that you like. Play along. Sing too, be able to play a few songs on your own. Play for your friends or mom.  \n  \nKeep playing scales. Learn some new ones. Learn a blues pentatonic scale for some basic solo/noodling.  \n  \nWork on alternate picking.  \n  \nFind some blues chord progressions and play along, attempt to noodle out some solos. Do this often, even without a backing track. Just noodle and get comfy with the neck.  \n  \nStart learning more complex chord voicings.   \n  \nGo after harder songs to learn.  \n  \ndip a toe into finger picking. alternate bass notes with your thumb. pick out some chords.  \n  \n\n  \nthat's a few things in a somewhat chronological order\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407877720", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Normally people that call us are refugees, you know, because the clinic'a name is the [City Name] Refugee Health Program... This lady calls me and from her voice it's clear she's pretty distressed.  She called asking if Dr. \"Smith\" (not actually, but a similarly generic Caucasian name). I said that Dr. Smith did, and she asked for an appointment.  \n\n\"Are you a refugee mam? We only see refugees at this clinic.\"  \n\n\"OH FUCK ME, now I'm being punished for being too long in Canada!?\"  \n\nNow at this point my heart is still going out to this poor woman.  She's obviously been through a lot.  \"We'll figure this out, I'll stay with you till we get this mess sorted.  Okay, so we have several doctors in this area accepting new patients.  How about Dr. Pate?l\"\n\n\"I DON'T WANT A FUCKING DOCTOR WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH!\"\n\n\"I'm sure Dr Patel speaks Eng--\"\n\n\"YOU'D BE SURPRISED?! HAVE YOU mET HIM.  HIS LAST NAME is 'Patel'\". She practically spits the name.\n\nNow, in this part of the city there are a lot of different ethnic minorities, and most MDs here do not have a white-sounding name\".  So I read more doctors accepting new patients \"Dr. Moradi?\"  \"NO!  WHAT PART OF SPEAKS ENGLIsH DO you not understand?\"  \"Dr. Jones?\"  \"That's one, I want at Lear two more, just in case!\"  So I keep reading names but there's not many dr's with names like\"jones\" on the area.  She reluctantly accepts a \"Dr. Ramirez\". And by the time she hangs up I feel like I need a shower...

{"body": "Okay sure assasains are coming back into meta, but this is how you'd play the match up. It's extremely simple. \n\n1. Get barrier on AP Kog\n2. Luckily, both of you power spike at level 6. Also luckily, Kog has range advantage against most assassins and thus can bully them in lane early. You also out trade the likes of Ahri for example, at all times of the game as long as you don't play like an idiot and walk into her.\n\nAt level 6, you might be thinking, 'oh my god it's over now zed hit level 6!'. Don't sweat is bro. Unless it's Kassadin/Syndra (one of which just got wrecked in the patch notes), you can still win your lane by outplaying them. All you have to do is use your range to your advantage, harass with e and r. If you're smart, you'd have build tear chalice against an AD caster/assassin anyways. Coupled with blue buff, the match up is so easy it makes me upset to see people question how to possibly lane against them. It's also to the level of people thinking LeBlanc countered Syndra (when she was good), when everything about Syndra's kid fundamentally renders LeBlanc useless, besides a Q, or Q R which could be coupled by a Q E W ignite R by Syndra. \n\nI'm going off on a tangent, but people down vote my posts when the reality is they have almost zero clue how to lane, even though they think they do. The reality is, there is so many match ups inexperienced players get completely wrong in their head. \n\nThe problem with Kog laning against Assassins isn't about the assassins themselves, but, only if you are not a good laner, or if you get ganked and kill by the jungler is the match up bad for you (barring a couple horrible matchups ie a Kassadin who builds properly)\n\n------------\n\nIt's not to take shots at you or anybody, but people down voting my post above sets off a big red light in my head that the majority of the community is inexperienced in terms of mid lane matchups, or have yet to experience or learn to play the hero. It has nothing to do with me being more intelligent, or being a good learner or whatever some people like to attach to LoL ranks for whatever reason. **The reality is the only thing (not really the only thing, some people have different goals) that separates two players from one another is how much experience they have. In no way am I trying to be an elitist, in fact I want you to think of me as nothingness, but there are certain people on here who give false advice, because they are not as experienced, and THAT'S OKAY. However, often times you will find the true answers/reasons related to LoL with more down votes than up votes because the people who understand at the higher level of play are in the minority and thus as a group express their opinions at a lower rate! haha**\n\nIf I could give one tip to someone (and for all I know, you may be a fantastic player so I am not talking directly to you) when it comes to League of Legends, it's that there is almost always more to a situation than at face value. I know what will happen to this post because of what I stated earlier, and that doesn't bother me, but if I break through to anyone who wants to become a better player, that'd be pretty cool to me.

{"body": "The real book would teach you to play jazz in a round about way. If you devoted a week to each song in there and just flooded your brain with jazz you'd start playing in a similar style. Jazz has always been a grass roots movement. And if you really want to learn to play jazz, learn to lay back for swing tunes. Be just slightly late, and don't count eighth notes as 1/2 a beat. It's different, in swing charts you treat them like 1/3 2/3, with the accentuated note being 2/3.\n\nAnd the best way by far to learn jazz is to go to a jazz club and ask to play with some of the guys. They'll give fantastic information, they'll give shit information, but most importantly it'll train your ear. And they'll help correct your articulation. Help you make sure that you're placing accents where they should go stylistically. \n\nIn short, the real book is a great tool. But if you really want to learn it, dive in, start learning Miles Davis solos by ear, try some Thellonious monk on for size, learn the heads, pay attention to patterns, and don't feel dwarfed by a Dm7b9#11 or a Bdimb7. While they're complex, you pick them up with time. \n\nAnd just as an example for how to decode those chords, because they're intimidating, lets take that Dm7b9#11. Alright, so we have D minor first, that means we have D F A and C in the chord. That's I III V and vii. But there's some added meat. The b9 and #11. Well, b9 is really just a bII, or #I up an octave. So, that means you can add in Eb anywhere you feel comfortable with it, most try to avoid half steps, they're usually not comfortable in a chord, but they do have a place in jazz occasionally. And the important dirty augmented 4th, or #11. This note adds another tritone to the chord. There's already one from 3 to 7, and now we've added one from 1 to #4. This adds some incredible meat to the chord and it sounds incredibly jazzy. The note in this particular instance would be a g#.  \n\nSo, we have a choice of notes we're given. The standard D F A C as well as Eb and G#. Now, as a jazz guitarist you have to prioritize notes. We're limited in ways that pianists are not. We don't have ten fingers for unique notes, so we usually let the pianist get the root and the 5th. We want the 3rd and 7th for sure. That's a meaty tritone. And we have a b9 and #11 in there. Those notes are critical, the arranger wrote them in. Luckily for us, b9 to #11 is a perfect 4th. This means that if we want to hit all of those notes we can look at the fretboard and see that we need Eb, Ab, f and C. Eb Ab and f are easily taken care of, go 6th fret on the 5th 4th and 2nd strings. Then add in the C on the 5th fret of the 3rd string and you're golden. 2nd finger 5th string, 3rd finger 4th string, 1st finger 3rd string, and 4th finger 2nd string. Bam, you've got a super jazzy b9#11 chord and it's not nearly as daunting as you'd have suspected.

{"body": "Reason 1: Multiple shapes to make connections to higher octaves without shifting hand position.  Play the first shape (index == root) on the fifth fret of the G string.  Now, you end on the note C, with your pinky on the 10th fret of the D string.  To smoothly connect into the next octave, you can use the ffcp shape with pinky as root and play from where you are.\n\nReason 2: Good transitions.  If I am playing over a C F C chord sequence in a song, I can play ffcp index shape scale on the fifth fret of G, then ffcp pinky shape on the tenth fret of G for my F scale.  This will share many of the same notes as the C scale you were just playing over (in fact, share all but the B which has been flatted to Bb for the F scale).  If you had shifted up to play index shape on the tenth fret of G for your F scale, you would have used some notes that are higher than what you were playing.  Sometimes that is useful, but  sometimes not.\n\nReason 3: Good tone.  Sometimes playing a scale using index root shape means you are playing further up the fretboard than you might like.  Mandolins do tend to have better tone on the lower frets.\n\nHope this helps in motivation.  Ultimately, you'll probably find reasons all your own after you know the four shapes.  Don't try to economize on your learning by learning just one shape; knowing more about scales will be better in one way or another.\n\nGood ffcp exercise for getting all four shapes: Play the circle of fifths in the fourths direction, with minimal hand shifts.  That is, play the C major scale with index shape at fret 5 of G.  Now we are going to play the major scale with root of the fourth note of the C scale (that is, F major scale).  To keep your hand shift as small as possible, use the pinky shape based at fret 10 of G.  Continue playing the fourth note of the scale until you get back to a C major (iirc, the C major you finish with will be middle finger shape based at fret 5 of G).  You may have to back off to the fourth scale note below the root you started with.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407940630", "subreddit": "mandolin", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Instead, it uses jh›na to\nprovide the trio of right mindfulness, right effort, and right view with a\nfoundation for developing all the path factors to an even more refined degree so\nas to lead to total release.\nJh›na can provide this foundation because the act of mastering strong\nconcentration changes many of the basic dynamics within the mind. As you find\nmore and more that a solid happiness can be found by subduing all greed and\ndistress with reference to the world, your search for happiness focuses less on\nthe world and more exclusively on maintaining mindful concentration at all\ntimes. Your desire to produce and consume happiness becomes more focused\nright here. And because the mind in concentration is so clear and bright, right\nview can watch this desire and its results more clearly as they occur. In this way,\nconcentration provides an excellent basis for exposing the processes of\nfabrication (saokh›ra)—the intentional processes by which the mind shapes\nexperience—as they occur within the levels of concentration itself. When you\nfinally come to realize the limitations even of concentration, right view together\nwith right mindfulness and right effort develop dispassion for the process of\nfabricating it. Because fabrication depends on passion and desire, this dispassion\nputs an end to all fabrication. And with that, the mind is released.\n[In the fourth jh›na:] “There remains only equanimity: pure &amp; bright,\npliant, malleable, &amp; luminous. Just as if a dexterous goldsmith or\ngoldsmith’s apprentice were to prepare a furnace, heat up a crucible, and,\ntaking gold with a pair of tongs, place it in the crucible: He would blow on\nit time &amp; again, sprinkle water on it time &amp; again, examine it time &amp; again,\nso that the gold would become refined, well-refined, thoroughly refined,\nflawless, free from dross, pliant, malleable, &amp; luminous. Then whatever\nsort of ornament he had in mind—whether a belt, an earring, a necklace,\nor a gold chain—it would serve his purpose. In the same way, there\nremains only equanimity: pure &amp; bright, pliant, malleable, &amp; luminous.\nOne discerns that ‘If I were to direct equanimity as pure &amp; bright as this\ntoward the dimension of the infinitude of space, I would develop the mind\nalong those lines, and thus this equanimity of mine—thus supported, thus\nsustained—would last for a long time. One discerns that ‘If I were to direct\nequanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the\ninfinitude of consciousness... the dimension of nothingness... the\ndimension of neither perception nor non-perception, I would develop the\nmind along those lines, and thus this equanimity of mine—thus\nsupported, thus sustained—would last for a long time.’\n“One discerns that ‘If I were to direct equanimity as pure &amp; bright as this\ntoward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind\nalong those lines, that would be fabricated. One discerns that ‘If I were to\ndirect equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness... the dimension of nothingness... the\ndimension of neither perception nor non-perception and to develop the\nmind along those lines, that would be fabricated.’ One neither fabricates\nnor mentally fashions for the sake of becoming or un-becoming. This\nbeing the case, one doesn’t cling to anything in the world. Not clinging,\none is not agitated. Unagitated, one is totally unbound right within. One\ndiscerns that ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is\nnothing further for this world.’” — MN 140\nRight mindfulness plays a consistent role in this process—not only giving rise\nto concentration and maintaining it, but also reminding you of the framework,\nmotivation, and duties of right view: to examine the results of your\nconcentration for any traces of stress and, when finding them, to abandon their\ncauses through the subtlest level of right effort.\nIn this way, even after they have directed all the other factors of the path to\nright concentration, the trio of right view, right mindfulness, and right effort\ncontinue to work in harmony to bring about total release.\nEven after attaining total release, arahants continue practicing the four\nestablishings of mindfulness. However, having completed the path, their\nmotivation for practicing right mindfulness has now changed. Because they have\nnothing more to add to their attainment—and are now totally disjoined from the\nobjects on which mindfulness is based—their fully developed mindfulness finds\nthese four establishings a natural place to settle.\n“Even those who are arahants—whose effluents are ended, who have\nreached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true\ngoal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who are released\nthrough right gnosis—even they remain focused on the body in &amp; of\nitself—being ardent, alert, unified, clear-minded, concentrated, &amp; single-\nminded, disjoined from the body. They remain focused on feelings in &amp; of\nthemselves... on the mind in &amp; of itself... on mental qualities in &amp; of\nthemselves—being ardent, alert, unified, clear-minded, concentrated, &amp;\nsingle-minded, disjoined from mental qualities.” — SN 47:4\nSN 54:11 makes an even stronger claim for the concentration of mindfulness\nof breathing, which MN 118 equates with right mindfulness: Not only do\narahants practice it, even the Buddha used it as one of his favorite meditative\ndwellings.\nThen the Blessed One, having emerged from seclusion after the passing of\nthree months, addressed the monks: “Monks, if wanderers of other sects\nask you, ‘By means of what dwelling, friends, did Gotama the\ncontemplative mostly dwell during the rains residence?’: You, thus asked,\nshould answer them in this way: ‘It was by means of the concentration of\nmindfulness of breathing that the Blessed One mostly dwelled.’ ...\n“For whatever one rightly speaking would call, ‘a noble dwelling,’ ‘a\nbrahm› dwelling,’ ‘a Tath›gata dwelling,’ it would be the concentration of\nmindfulness of breathing that he, speaking rightly, would call, ‘a noble\ndwelling,’ ‘a brahm› dwelling,’ ‘a Tath›gata dwelling.’\n\n“Those who are learners, who have yet to attain their hearts’ desire, who\nstay resolved on the unexcelled security from bondage: When the\nconcentration of mindfulness of breathing is developed &amp; pursued by\nthem, it leads to the ending of the effluents.\n“Those who are arahants, whose effluents are ended, who have reached\nfulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal,\ntotally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who are released through\nright gnosis: When the concentration of mindfulness of breathing is\ndeveloped &amp; pursued by them, it leads to a pleasant abiding here-&amp;-now\nand to mindfulness &amp; alertness.” — SN 54:11\nThis means that right mindfulness functions not only as a factor of the path,\nbut also as a pleasant pastime for those who have fully developed the path and\ntasted its ultimate fruit.\nPañcasikha the gandhabba: “Just as the water of the Ganges runs together\n&amp; harmonizes with the water of the Yamuna, in the same way the path of\npractice leading to unbinding is well-promulgated by that Blessed One for\nhis disciples. They run together, unbinding and the path of practice.” — DN\n19\nThis doesn’t mean that right mindfulness is identical with unbinding—after\nall, as Iti 90 points out, right mindfulness is fabricated whereas the realization of\nunbinding is not—simply that the practice of right mindfulness is compatible\nwith a mind that, through the realization of unbinding, is totally unfettered by\ndefilement and free.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407951299", "subreddit": "RightMindfulness", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's how I think about it.\n\nYour major scale has 8 notes, including the octave - I'll refer to them as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. The major scale is the first mode, Ionian.\n\nMode Two is Dorian. To play that, you take the major scale you have, but start from note 2:  2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2. Then Mode Three is Phrygian, so you start from note 3: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3. And so on and so forth.\n\nSince all of those use the same notes, they're all in the same key. so C Major is C Ionian, and if you start from the second note, D, and play through the C Major scale until the next D, you have D Dorian. Then E Phrygian. And so on and so on.\n\nThat's for playing different modes in the same key. For playing different modes with the same root, but in different keys, you have to compare the notes - for instance, C Major is:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nBut C Aeolian is:\n\nC D Eb F G Ab Bb C\n\nso you know the relationship between Ionian mode and Aeolian mode is b3, b6, and b7.

You can choose either or but whatever you decide it looks best if you cut off the ones in between.\n\nNow with the AD Clay connect the body and legs but extend the torso. He will look freakishly Tall but by doing so he will be much more stable when placed in the soil. (( picture on my instagram ) http://instagram.com/ganda_kris ))\n\nWith the torso dry go a head and begin to make the vines. I found it unique to twist them as your placing it on the pop.\n\nNow you can go crazy and even add in facial structures such as cheeks and eyebrows but thats all up to you!\n\nOnce all AD Clay Procedures are done go ahead and paint him! Highlight as you go it will definitely make him pop (no pun intended)\n\nWith the moss I suggest not throwing it on there instead start with the trunk. Choose the best looking pieces of moss, map it out and super glue it on! Continue this process. You can have vines hanging off his hand or overflowing onto the pot! GET CREATIVE!\n\nHave Fun and just know he will need Water Sunlight and lots of Love! \n\nIt was fun making Baby Groot Jr but Ill never forget running around with Jay trying to collect all the materials. Then spending the days ahead sculpting and finishing him. We both worked really hard and absolutely love our end result. * High Five for Team Work *\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407968417", "subreddit": "Art", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ehhhh...\n\nThey're separate, first of all.  We're talking about common practice music here, so they don't usually just repeat the same chord movements over and over like in pop music today.  Of course, going down a second isn't unheard of; going up a third is actually pretty rare, and going down a fifth is cadential while going *up* a fifth (or down a fourth) is kind of like an inverse cadence, and it especially happens when the music gets to the IV.  Movement by a third is actually fairly uncommon, though.  The favorite common practice progression goes like this: I - ii42 - V65 - I.  Ignoring the numbers for now, which refer to inversions, the root goes up a second, down a fifth, down a fifth.\n\nActually!  Let's analyze some Bach.  This should give you a nice picture of what's preferred.  Keep in mind, here, that the reason for these preferences is that, in a way, they feel most natural.  Going up a second builds tension, while going down a second doesn't move the progression forward.  Going down a third feels like falling naturally, while going up a third feels like moving to an unrelated chord.  Going down a fifth is cadential and resolves the primary tension of tonal music.  Going up a fifth actually builds tension, which is usually fine.  Going down a fourth, which is equivalent but sounds different, releases tension in a different kind of way.  These are obviously generalizations, and there are times to do things differently!  But here's the harmony to Bach's Prelude I in C from the Well-Tempered Clavier:\n\nC - Dm7/C - G7/B - C - Am/C - D7/C - G/B - Cmaj7/B - Am7 - D7 - G - Gdim7 - Dm/F - Fdim7 - C/E - Fmaj7/E - Dm7 - G7 - C - C7 - Fmaj7 - F#dim7 - Abdim7 (\\*) - G7 - C/G - G7sus4 - G7 - F#dim7/G - C/G - G7sus4 - G7 - C7 - Fmaj7/C Dm7/C - G7/C - C\n\nTwo weird things here are the Abdim7, which is the pattern Ab F B C D and it's not entirely clear that it's actually an Abdim7, and the third to last measure starts like an Fmaj7 and ends like a Dm7.  Also, the dim7 chord is rootless.  It makes the most sense to think of the root as a major third below.  The root of a Bdim chord, for example, could be a G, in a G7b9 with the G missing.  The issue here, of course, is that a dim7 chord is symmetrical, so there are four possible roots it could have.  Anyway, root movements:\n\nu2 - d5 - d5 - d3 - d5 - d5 - d5 - d3 - d5 - d5 - (Gdim7 as A7b9 with no root) u2 - d5 - (Fdim7 as G7b9 with no root) d5 - d5 - d5 - d3 - d5 - d5 - = - d5 - (F#dim7 as D7b9 with no root) - d3 - **weird motion to weird chord** - **weird motion to G7** - d5 - **u5** - = - **weird motion to F#dim7/G** - **weird motion to C/G** - **u5** - = - d5 - d5 d3 - d5 - d5\n\nSo, other than a few motions up a fifth and some chords that should be seen as entirely rootless, nearly everything follows the rule!  The weird chords are that Abdim7, which is actually similar to an augmented 6th chord in some ways -- it's not actually; it's just similar in usage -- and the F#dim7/G, which is actually known as a common-tone diminished 7th (ignore the pedal G).  I'd say that these progressions are pretty typical.  It's worth noting that both times the harmony went up a fifth it was from tonic to dominant, and the voice leading went from second inversion to root position, which itself can be thought of as resolving a tension.\n\nDo you believe the rule now?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407976148", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Nice question!\n\nLet's start by trying (and probably failing) to define what a mode actually is.  People use the word to mean many things!  One definition is that a mode is a scale that you get by taking another scale and starting it on some note other than the one it usually starts on.  For example, the C major scale is C D E F G A B C.  The third mode of C major would be starting C major on the third note: E F G A B C D E.  We call this new scale the E phrygian scale.  The C major pentatonic scale is C D E G A C.  The third mode of this scale is E G A C D E, which is kind of weird and doesn't really have a name, but the fifth mode, A C D E G A, is also called the A minor pentatonic scale.  So, in this definition, a mode is just a way to get a new scale from an old one.\n\nWhen people talk about \"the modes\", they're usually talking about the modes of the diatonic scale (the major scale).  That would be the first mode, ionian or major, the second mode, dorian, the third, phrygian, the fourth, lydian, the fifth, mixolydian, the sixth, aeolian or natural minor, and the seventh, locrian.  All of these modes are used in music to varying degrees.  Common Practice Period music -- that's European \"classical\" music -- tends to stick to major (also called ionian) and minor (which is not one of the modes), but modern music and folk music from all cultures uses many different scales, including the modes (dorian and mixolydian are especially popular in European folk music) and scales that don't even use the tunings we have but use tunings in between, like Arabic maqam music.\n\nBut there's also a thing called modal music, and this is not the same as simply music that uses these modes.  This is a different definition of mode.  Here, a mode is a style of making a melody, using specific musical gestures and stopping on certain notes, without much of an emphasis on traditional tonality.  I can't really provide examples of this, unfortunately, but before people used scales -- including the modes we've talked about -- they had a different system.  Look up Gregorian chant; they used modes known as church modes.  I'm much more familiar with Jewish modes, personally.  The Arabic maqam system is also in many ways modal.\n\nDo the modes have moods?  Sure.  Every scale has moods.  Major, minor, whatever.  Just don't say that major is happy and minor is sad.  This is not even close to true!  It heavily depends on the culture.  Some cultures sing dirges in major and wedding songs in minor!  And if you play major slowly, it can be melancholy; if you play minor quickly, it can be exciting.  But usually *diatonic* modes are dark or bright depending on how many flats they have.  If you take all of the modes of the major scale and transpose them to C, you can put them in order.  From brightest to darkest, they're lydian (#4), ionian (all naturals), mixolydian (b7), dorian (b7 b3), aeolian (b7 b3 b6), phrygian (b7 b3 b6 b2), and locrian (b7 b3 b6 b2 b5).\n\nI mentioned earlier that minor is not one of the modes.  But aeolian is minor, isn't it?  No, it isn't!  Are you familiar with harmonic and melodic minor?  *That* is minor.  In minor, the chords are from the harmonic minor and the melodies are from the melodic minor.  If you're in Cm, you'll almost never see a cadence going Ab Bb C with the chords Fm Gm Cm underneath, because you use G instead of Gm and you use A B C instead of Ab Bb C when you're going up.  Modern composers like to write in aeolian, but that's not minor!\n\nHopefully that clears it up.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1407993522", "subreddit": "ELI5Music", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*edit: I was just checking over the EAAN wikipedia article and had some thoughts about my assertion that his terminology is confused and full of problems. It would be better to start with his own words. Regarding Epiphenomenalism:*\n\n&gt;*if this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be invisible to evolution\"\n\nNo, in that way of thinking beliefs are abstracts of physical systems. The \"belief\" that you're about to die *is* the physiological state of the brain and nervous system and therefor is not \"invisible\" to evolution.\n\n____\n\n&gt; Apart from, you know, the reasons Plantinga offers which you have done nothing to counter.\n\nA lack of a substantive argument from Plantinga. He starts with arbitrary probabilities. His argument is steeped in terminology which is not well defined or completely erroneous in the context in which it's used. He's appealing to intuition, not knowledge and consensus -- because there is barely any knowledge or consensus on the way many of the terms he uses operate on this subject.\n\n&gt;No one said it was.\n\nPlantinga did. That's his argument: P(R|N&amp;E)\n\n&gt;Certainly seems to be. For example believing that if I'm travelling at u and throw a spear at v then it will travel at u + v is a false belief, but a very useful one.\n\nYou're misunderstanding me. I said it isn't necessarily there, there has been no sufficient case made. We only know that v1+v2!=reality because we've made observations beyond the scope of that useful and intuitive, however wrong, theory. The crux here is that **E V E R Y T H I N G** we hold to be true is probably in the exact same boat, we just haven't made further discoveries to tease out those details yet.\n\nThe Newton V Einstein comparisson exemplifies this well. Newtons ideas work but have limits. According to Plantinga's line of reasoning, Einstein's theories help show that Newton was wrong except that Einstein is *also* wrong about some things. i.e. his theories still have \"problems\", just like Newtons do. We're just chasing out tail looking for perfect knowledge when it doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;It certainly seems like we do, viz. comparing the proposition's claim to the way the world is.\n\nYou cannot proceed in doing that without assuming truth values based on the demonstrable utility of various principles and theories.\n\n&gt;He does? Where?\n\nIt is implicit in the false-conundrum that he's created. v1+v2=reality can't necessarily and absolutely be considered false, just as newtons laws of motion are not false.\n\nThis ignorance is what happens when people don't know anything about the philosophy of science, and Plantinga doesn't, as most people don't. The definition of a scientific theory is completely incompatible with Platinga's argument. \"Truthiness\" of scientific theories is provisioned by the specific observations and context in which it was developed. They are neither \"true\" nor \"false\".

{"body": "* \"How can a note like C have different frequencies? What makes a C a C then?\"\n\nEver hear men and women singing the same tune together? The women will almost certainly sing it \"higher\" than the men, even though the \"notes\" are the same. What's happening is that the women will be singing notes that are double the frequency (in Hz) of the notes the men are singing. So the women might sing an A at 440Hz whereas the men sing an A at 220Hz. A note that's double the frequency is an octave higher, which is a term you may have heard. Basically, the note names (CDEFGABC, etc.) repeat every octave, the higher C double the frequency of the previous C, etc.\n\n* \"If different instruments both play an A 440, why does it sound different?\"\n\nWhen an instrument plays a note, it isn't actually one frequency that sounds, it's actually the note itself plus a whole load of other, higher frequencies (called harmonics, basically). Each instrument has its own structure of harmonics, based on the material itself, how the material is excited, etc. A 440Hz \"A\" on the piano shares a fundamental tone with a 440Hz \"A\" on a violin for example, but the relative loudness of the harmonics are completely different, giving a different quality to the tone.\n\n* \"How does the whole note, half-note, quarter-note work if there isn't a set amount of time fixed to it (e.g. 1 whole note = 2 seconds)?\"\n\nSometimes it works pretty much like you suggested, although rather than saying \"1 whole note = 2 seconds\" the speed is specified as the number of quarter notes per minute (generally). Once you have the basic pulse (quarter note most often, but not always) then the rest all follow relative to that (so you can play 2 eight notes in the same time as it takes to play 1 quarter note, etc.)\n\n* \"If two musicians play the same piece on the piano, shouldn't it sound the same both times (assuming no errors). Aside from being error free, how is one musician a better performer than another?\"\n\nThe fabled \"spaces between the notes\"! Very subtle changes in timing, loudness, gaps between notes, etc. can all change the overall performance. It's easiest heard by example of course, but listen to 2 different classical pianists for the same piece on youtube or whatever and you'll find differences in all of these areas and more. As an analogy, 2 photos of the same image could look drastically different, despite both being \"error free\".\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408033167", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

Of these 500 monks, the most backward is a stream-\nwinner, not destined for the planes of deprivation, headed to self-awakening for\nsure.”\nThen the Blessed One addressed the monks, “Now then, monks, I exhort\nyou: All fabrications are subject to decay.

{"body": "It's an easy way of navigating a 2-5-1 and an essential part of the Bebop language. If you think of jazz as a language, its english counter part would be something like \"The truck is red\" or \"the dog runs fast\". At this point its been played so many times by so many people that its become a cliche but try having a conversation with out using the words \"The\" \"is\" \"red\" or \"runs\".\n\nIt should be noted that the scale degrees that you used in the title aren't correct for the function of the sequence. A better way of looking at it would be 2 3 4 5 3 1 2. So in C major that would be D E F G E C D. Across a 2-5-1 progression (Dm7-G7-Cmaj7) its built to put the most important notes of the chord on the downbeats and ends on the 9 of the I chord which is a much more interesting place to end than the 3 or, god forbid, the 1.\n\nAs for the origin, no one knows who the first person to play it was but if I had to guess I'd say it stems from the early days of the bebop era when guys like Bird and Dizzy started [pushing the tempos to ridiculous extremes](http://youtu.be/AMuItUv9xZc) (can you count how many times its played in this tune? It's alot.) and they needed something quick, easy and decent sounding to play over the tune. And since the only way to learn how to play jazz in those days was to listen to the records and emulate what you heard, it became part of the jazz vernacular.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408035665", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 42, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, reading through the other replies, I feel like you've only gotten fairly technical answers. Here's an ELI5 version:\n\n&gt;How can a note like a C have two different frequencies? What makes a C a C then?\n\nA C is a C because of it's frequency- middle C is 261.6 Hz. A C played at a higher or lower note is still a C because it's *harmonic*. When you play a middle C and a high C together, you can hear the harmony- the waves of sound line up with each other and amplify the sound. A middle C and an A would not do so.\n\n&gt;If different instruments both play an A 440, why does it sound different?\n\nBecause of the *timbre* of the instrument. A string instrument, such as a violin or cello, works by causing a string to vibrate and then reverberate through to hollow body of the instrument. This produces a certain quality that we perceive distinctly as a stringed instrument, due to the shape of the sound wave. This is why the waves in /u/LondonPilot's image look different. \n\n&gt;How does the whole note, half-note, quarter-note work if there isn't a set amount of time fixed to it?\n\nThere is a set time, though. To truly begin at the beginning, you have to start with the structure of written music. Music is made up of *measures*, which in turn are made of of the notes. The way the measure is divided into said notes is dependent upon the *time signature*. The time signature denotes two things- one, how many beats there are per measure, and two, what that beat is a division of. \n\nThe most simple time signature is 4/4. This denotes that there are four beats in the measure, shown by the top number, and that each beat is a quarter note, shown by the bottom number. Now the musician knows that there are four quarter notes per measure. To determine how fast the quarter notes should be played, (s)he will reference the *tempo*. This is the speed of the song, and can be shown in two ways:\n\nExactly: The tempo can be written as an exact speed given in beats per minute, with each beat being one quarter note.\n\nApproximately: The tempo can have an acceptable range specified (i.e. 120-132 BPM) or is can be written as an Italian word. The main tempo denotations are as follows:\n\nPresto: Very Quickly\nAllegro: Fast\nModerato: Moderately\nAndante: Slowly, walking speed\nAdagio: Very slowly\n\nIt is up to the musician or the conductor to determine where in these ranges to play. \n\nA whole note is four quarter notes, a half note is two quarter notes, a quarter note is a quarter note, an eighth note is half of a quarter note, and so on. \n\n&gt;If two musicians play the same piece on the piano, shouldn't it sound the same both times (assuming no errors. Aside from being error free, how is one musician a better performer than another?\n\nFantastic question. This answer has many parts. There are many aspects to playing an instrument that do not involve errors or the lack thereof. For one, posture. Proper posture can make a mediocre musician into a good one. It allows for faster, more precise movements, and more confidence and volume control. \n\nAlso, the dynamic is important. The dynamic of a piece refers to it's volume. A good musician can play a piece straight through, no errors- but it's all at the same volume. After a while, it would all start to sound the same. A great musician uses the dynamics indicated by he composer and makes the piece come to life. The music takes you by surprise when it becomes loud, and make you fall silent and hold your breath when it becomes quiet.\n\nMusicality. This is the flavor that each musician puts into a performance- an accent on a certain note, holding a while note for a bit longer than written to increase suspense, or ending sharply when it's not specified. \n\nThe beauty of classical music is that each musician performs it differently due to their impression of the piece. The one who is the best is the one who plays it with feeling and emotion. \n\nLet me know if I didn't answer something as thoroughly as you'd like, or if you have any other questions. :)\n\nEdit- numbers are hard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408040351", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A lot of music theory can be difficult to understand, since a lot of it really only makes sense in the context of writing music. basically, a key is a group of notes (usually 8) that have a certain sound and follow a certain predetermined formula. For example, C major contains the notes \nC D E F G A B C\nthese are 8 specific notes out of the 12 in an octave that achieve a certain sound when used with one another. I think the major scale is pretty neutral sounding, though it's definitely happy. On the other side, there's C minor, which is\nC D Eb F G Ab Bb C\nThis has a distinctly sad sound to it. How you get the notes is a different formula than the major scale, and doing so yields a different sound.\n\nNow, the hardest part to understand about keys is how say, C major sounds different than F major. Theoretically, the F maj scale has notes in the same order that follow the same pattern, just bumped up a few steps in pitch. The differences are very subtle, and it takes some experience to tell the difference. I personally just stick to C maj and C min when I write my tracks, because I really can't hear a difference myself. \nI hope this made some sense, but it probably didn't. Theory is hard to grasp, especially from an academic standpoint. My best recommendation is to not worry about it too much. Always keep in mind that theory came AFTER music, not before.

{"body": "I guess I will give you all an update on my job-hunting saga: \n\nI had my phone interview yesterday with a company that would be an excellent fit for me. I think it went extremely well! The hiring manager said that she would get back up with me in the next week. So I was REALLY excited about that, but then *another* job (I thought this ship had sailed a lot time ago since it took several weeks to get back to me when their supposed hire date came and went without a call), called and asked for a phone interview, which I scheduled for this coming week. \n\nI was over the moon about all that.  The second job didn't have nearly the responsibility that I'm used to/looking for, but it would be a \"foot in the door\" for a very difficult field to get into. So I was all caught up weighing those two positions and how I felt about them.\n\nThen yesterday, I got an alert saying that a job matching my qualifications had been posted, and when I opened it the page, my jaw hit the floor- this is E X A C T L Y the job of my dreams. I mean absolutely the job that I dream of at night, and everything that I have worked for. \n\nAnd I fit the qualifications. I was blown away. Problems:\n\n1) I technically fit the qualifications, but I know that there are people with *way* more experience than me and higher degrees (a Ph.D/Ed.D) applying for this job. I was told this by my mentor, who knows at least one person who will likely apply for it.\n\n2) If I was to be considered, I wouldn't know until after the 28th. This is a problem if I get one of the other two jobs between now and then. I'm not sure what the protocol is here.  What if by some crazy chance, I get an interview for my dream job, but I've already started another job? \n\nI love the company that just posted this job. I believe so strongly in what they do and the people they work with. I've been to their seminars, stalked their facebook page, and spoken with the director. This job is literally everything I've ever dreamed of. I know something like this will probably come around again some day, but I just have to at least try.\n\n:( / :) ???", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408119590", "subreddit": "femalefashionadvice", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Two people can have different standards of \"clean\" and different levels of fuck giving about whether their house fits that definition. In my experience, its usually women with a higher standard of cleanliness and fuck giving about meeting that standard. For example, a wife and husband could agree that husband will clean the bathroom. Husband cleans it, and its basically clean, but wife finds x y z a b c wrong, \"you didnt scrub the shower drain hard enough\" \" the sink still has that cloudy ring from the soap\" etc, a bunch of shit husband and frankly most people wouldnt notice or care about but that take tons of extra time and effort. \n\nAnd then there are examples where the standard of clean cant even be articulated. Every year ive watched my parents try to decorate for holidays, which imo would be a fun activity but my mom turns into a chore. How the fuck should my dad know how she wants it decorated? Why does this HAVE to be done past the point of it being fun? My point is that in my observation, women often build up irrational resentment towards their so for not meeting a chore criteria they cant even articulate. This is the type od behavior trp means when they call women irrational. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408133643", "subreddit": "PurplePillDebate", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The concept behind Pythagorean tuning is that the ratio 3/2 is the best ratio ever. In modern terminology, when two pitches are in the ratio 3/2, we call it a perfect fifth. To fulfill our quest for perfection, we want to construct a scale using only perfect fifths as the building block. If we start at C, we can put a perfect fifth above it: G. And again, a perfect fifth above that: D. If we keep going we get:\n\n* C G D A E B\n\nHere's a small problem, the note a fifth above B is F#. It's not the end of the world, but let's try to fill in the other naturals before getting into sharps and flats. We'll go back to C, and this time add the note a perfect fifth *below* it: F. Now we've got all the natural notes. That's it! We constructed the diatonic Pythagorean scale.\n\n* F C G D A E B\n\nNow you're probably wondering what the difference between standard equal temperament (ET) and Pythagorean tuning is, if that's all there is to it. The secret is that in ET, perfect fifths aren't truly as perfect as they could be. They're actually just a tiny bit flatter. So close that it's nearly impossible to hear the difference, but flatter all the same. So the G in Pythagorean tuning is actually a tiny bit sharper than the G in ET. However, because each ET fifth is tuned a bit flat, when we stack fifths up like this, the further around the circle of fifths we go from C, where we started, the flatter the ET note is compared to the note produced by stacking pure Pythagorean fifths.\n\n    C is identical in both tunings\n    G is imperceptibly sharper in Pythagorean tuning\n    D is another tiny notch sharper\n    A is sharp enough that a keen ear might notice\n    E is sharp enough that the medieval musicians who used\n      Pythagorean tuning did not consider C-E to be fully\n      consonant.\n    B is even sharper than that\n\n    F, however, is below C, so it comes out flatter rather than\n      sharper. It's directly adjacent to C, so it's only as flat\n      as G is sharp though.\n\nAnd that's it. Basically, Pythagorean tuning is the process of stacking fifths until you have all the notes you want. I didn't do sharps and flats, but they're added just by appending sharps after B, and putting flats before F--of course the further they are from C, the more different they will be from their ET versions!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408143755", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The answer is simple but very deceptive if you don't already know some basics.  I'll try to make this as easy as I can.\nFirst, you need to understand some terms:\n\n\nScale degrees = the sequence of pitches in a scale.  I.e 1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n\nInterval = the distance between two pitches.\nThese are built out of half steps and have their own numbered names:\nRoot or unison = starting pitch \nMinor second = 1 half step from starting pitch\nMajor second = 2 half steps\nMinor third = 3 half steps\nMajor third = 4 half steps\nPerfect 4th = 5 half steps\nDiminished 5th (or tritone) = 6 half steps\nPerfect fifth = 7 half steps\nMinor sixth = 8 half steps\nMajor sixth = 9 half steps\nMinor seventh = 10 half steps\nMajor seventh = 11 half steps\nPerfect octave = 12 half steps\n\n\nAny major chord is comprised of a root, a major third, and a perfect fifth.  \n\n\nAny minor chord is comprised of a root, a minor third, and a perfect fifth.\n\n\nAny diminished chord is comprised of a root, minor third, and a diminished fifth.\n\n\nLet's start with the C major scale:\nc d e f g a b   (I.e. All the white notes on a piano)\n\n\nNow let's add numbers to show the scale degrees:\nc d e f g a b\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nStart on the first scale degree c\nSkip over the second and go to the third scale degree = e\nSkip over the 4th scale degree and go to the 5th = g\nc e g\nHey! That's a c major chord!\nLet's use intervals instead of scale degrees:\nRoot = c\nMajor third = e\nPerfect fifth = g\n\n\nOk, so what if we start on the second scale degree= d \nadd the 4th scale degree = f\nAdd the 6th scale degree = a\nNow Lets look at the intervals instead:\nRoot = d\nMinor third = f\nPerfect fifth = a\nd f a\nHey! That's a d minor chord.\n\n\nOk let's start on the third scale degree\n3rd scale degree = e\n5th scale degree = g\n7th scale degree = b\nUsing intervals,\nRoot = e\nMinor third = g\nPerfect fifth = b\ne g b\nHey! We got another minor chord, e minor.\n\n\nStart on the fourth scale degree = f\nThen the 6th degree = a\nThen because there are only 7 degrees we go back to the first one = c\nUsing intervals:\nRoot = f\nMajor 3rd = a\nPerfect fifth = c\nf a c\nWoohoo we got an f major chord\n\n\nIf you continue in this fashion, you'll see we end up with the chords\nC-Maj\nd-min\ne-min\nF-Maj\nG-Maj\na-min\nB-dim\n\n\nI sincerely hope this helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408150498", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

I really hope you get this worked out.\n\nBitrate: 1165_ *calculate bitrate for other settings by multiplying W x H x FPS x 0.10 / 1000 = bitrate needed (per SDK)\n\nCBR: Yes_     CFR: Yes_       CBR Padding: Yes_ Custom Buffer: No\n\nMinimize Network Impact : No  (unless you notice lag in your game due to bandwidth issues)\n\nVideo Downscale Resolution: 910x512_              Filter: None_        FPS: 25 (24 wont hurt either at your resolutions)\n\nProcess Priority: Normal_      Scene Buffer Time: 700 (unless you have audio issues, you can set to 400)\n\nCPU: Very Fast (can also try Superfast to see if that helps CPU)\n\nAutomatic Low latency Mode: No  (do not bind to interface)\n\nI really hope you get this resolved and maybe something in here will help. Good luck!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408163818", "subreddit": "hitbox", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My mom's real father was a psychotic schizophrenic who raped young girls. No one knew until one day when the cops showed up at their door to question him. He was arrested. My mom says that her younger sister always use to cry every time he walked in the room, and no one knew why. They had an idea after he was arrested. He didn't spend long in jail and when he got out he came by the house every day, banging on the doors and windows screaming to let him inside. One day he came when no one was home except my mom. She was around 7 when this happened and out of her 2 sisters and brother she was the most outspoken. She started yelling back at him and told him to go away instead of hiding which infuriated him more to the point where he broke in through the basement. He raped her and told her that if she ever told anyone he would kill her and the rest of the family. She never told anyone, I found out about 3 months ago in a family therapy session by accident. Her mother, her two sisters, her brother, and my dad don't know. I'm the only one who knows. \n\nBut that isn't all of her crazily family history. Her brother had epilepsy, and possibly some sort of mental disorder that he never got diagnosed for. My mom and her 2 sisters had bedrooms upstairs and there was a door at the top. Apparently, he would sit outside of the door knocking saying he wanted to come in and \"play\" in the middle of the night. (He was much older then them, 16 when they were 4-10). He would flash them his genitals when my grandma wasn't around and would chase them around the house with a knife. Every time he was accused of doing something bad he said he was just \"playing\". Then the very last straw was during the summer. My mom was 11-12 years old. Everyone was outside doing whatever including the family dog. Out of nowhere her brother stopped the lawn mower and went inside. He came out of the house with a leash in his hand and got the dog. My mom says she was sitting in a tree when this happened reading a book and didn't even notice until it was to late. Apparently her brother got the leash for a different purpose than to just tie the dog up to get out of the way. He tightened it, stood on it, and then ran the dog over with the lawn mower multiple times.\n\nIn front of his 3 younger sisters and mother. Sounds like a psychopath to me. He was sent to a mental hospital and died at the age of 22 from his epilepsy. I don't think that's such a bad thing, considering he most likely would've raped/murdered people if he hadn't.\n\nBut the most fucked up thing- which may not seem fucked up to you guys is what happend wayyyy later in her life. After my grandma divorced her first husband, after her son died, years later she found a man and got remarried. This man loved and treated her daughters like his own and made my grandmother extremely happy. They built a gorgeous log cabin which I have fond memories of going to and everything seemed normal. When I was around 6 years old my grandma had to have open heart surgery. My mom's sister, the oldest, lived in Boston and had to fly in for support. Everyone else was at the hospital and my aunt and my grandpa were at the house picking up some spare clothes. Apparently, the grandpa I knew was a disgusting motherfucker too. While my GRANDMA was IN THE MIDDLE OF GETTING OPEN H E A R T surgery, my grandfather was at his house asking his 35 year old daughter if she would like to have sex with him. \n\n\nSo I was 6 at the time and I didn't find any of this out until years later. I always wondered why I wasn't allowed to see grandpa anymore and why grandma was heartbroken. My aunt didn't tell anyone for 6 months. The night it happened she got on a plane (without speaking to anyone), went back to boston and had a mental breakdown until she finally told my mom 6 entire months later. The only reason she did was because she was afraid that he would try something with me, his only grandchild in the area. They eventually had to tell my grandma, which my mom says was the most heartbreaking experience she's ever gone through.\n\nAnd then he left, and never came back. My grandma who was a diabetic stopped taking her medications and eventually in a way committed suicide. But she really died from a broken heart.\n\nAn extremely true and frightening story which has always made me wonder; can you really trust anyone? The people who are in your lives for 20-30 years all of the sudden become your biggest nightmare.\n\nAnd for anyone wondering, my mom's real father left the state, got remarried and had 3 other children. About 2 years ago my mom got a message on facebook from her half-sister saying that her father finally told them about his 3 other daughters and wanted to see them before he died. My mom didn't go see him, but my mom's youngest sister did. His wife, his kids, his entire family had no idea about his entire past, and they still don't. \n\nHe died without his \"new\" family knowing any of his secrets. And I wonder sometimes if that's a good thing or not. I don't think I'll ever know.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408242527", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Have you encountered this situation:\nYou want to attack an enemy location, hatch an elaborate plan featuring multiple ruses, protocols, codenames and outcome scenarios, discussing all this extensively with your squadmates, doing 1on1s and making sure every link in your chain is at its strongest, all while the defenders bore themselves do death at their position, because they were already set up half a year ago.\n\nThen maybe \n\n**A N Y T H I N G  , LITERALLY ANYTHING AT ALL**\n\nis right for you.\n\n* Move into enemy territory\n* Engage contacts\n* Treat the wounded\n* Actively participate in the mission objective\n\nAsk your local bored TvT defender if doing **ANYTHING, LITERALLY ANYTHING AT ALL** is right for you, today!\n\n\n\n**COOP**: \n\nTek, Charlie Rifleman or something\n\nAs i said in TS, im not mad that i got shot, im mad that it took so long. We spent what felt like half an hour setting up fireteams and radios, stieglitz(SL) was going \"IDGAF lol just maek radio chan xD\" and we were like \"rifleman radio, cant do custom\". Then the team colors, which also took like a million years.\n\n We moved out, had no idea what was happening. then we went to the depot, nolux,stieglitz,and Dtron were asploded by a vehicle, someone threw a grenade. I swapped my rifle for one with a proper scope and GL attach, grabbed some medsupplies,no defib tho. \"nah its gonna be fine\" i said to myself, packing more GL rounds. we try to get into a vehicle and move out approximately 11 aeons later, after Stieglitz redid the fireteam colours (because of arma).\n\n We drive around for a bit until blue FT gets out near a bridge, and then gets horribly destroyed in the classic \"cowboys ride through a deep canyon\" scene. I lie on the ground for 15 minutes, explaining the medical system in sidechat, until someone with a defib arrives and jolts me back to life.\n\nWe gather the survivors and head into a compound. We call out a few enemies, the vehicle moves in, locks its turret on a building 5 metres away and sprays it for a solid 5 minutes. Meanwhile, our rag-tag bunch of misfits sits in a garage and administers bloodbags. When no orders for our subgroup(not really a FT) come in, I decide to move near the BTR. I spot a few american corpses on the ground in the aforementioned BTR-sprayed building, and start looting. As it turns out, there is still enemies alive inside the little concrete hut that this building was, despite all the lead puncturing. I die horribly.\n\nAs a spectator, I mainly make seagull noises and do attack runs on the survivors.\n\n\n\n**TvT**:\nHostage Mission was fun, if drawn out. Mainly because of our CO, Socks and their antics. Blufor apparently engaged Drunks FT in a building and were horribly murdered like pigs. We won.\n\nFOB attack was the most boring tvt i have ever seen. No scope, not a single medkit, no radio and a million bandages, despite picking medic. Didn't know what was happening, didn't see a single enemy the whole round and lost.\n\nMartin and Ivan was a bit tricky because we had no admin at first, but still the mission with the best design by far. People move into a zone, engage enemy, move out, done. Simple, fast, elegant, working as intended. The only thing I would change is driving+safe start. Either one would suffice. 10mins+5mins spent driving is way too long for the average match length.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408318840", "subreddit": "ProjectMilSim", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

When I look at this picture I notice the detailing on the suit pocket square and the top of his tie/shirt collar area look really clean and just seem to pop more than the rest of the image for some reason.. you need to find a way to spice it up a little bit because this polygon style has done alot so to add your own little tweak or thing would be cooler\n\n1 more thing... if you look closely / zoom in it looks as if your purpled tinted white background is seeping through your portrait.. not sure if this is intentional but it would do a great service to your work to clean that up and make sure all shapes are leaving no space between\n\n1 1 more thing.. The spacing between D R A K E is not consistent, the top of the K is also the wrong color (it should be black no?.. I guess i could see it being weird to just have a small line of black coming off his head like that so i could see why u might've kept it white)\n\n\noverall, its a cool portrait for the style that it is but I just dont find it (polygon style) that interesting unless it has some tweaks to it. It doesnt even have to be anything exotic.. just a way to fit it on a background better and make it more visually stimulating .. I'm sure you'll figure something out eventually\n\nsorry if u didn't want a crit.. i just know when I post shit I made I usually would wont people to point things out n talk about it beyond \"ahh yeah soo coool\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408332325", "subreddit": "HipHopImages", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Here's the hypolydian on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypolydian_mode).  It looks *just* like C major, doesn't it?  It isn't.  It's based on F, and it includes notes down to the C below and C above.  An example of a song in hypolydian would be Happy Birthday in F.  The notes are C C D C F E | C C D C G F | C C c A F E D | Bb Bb A F G F.  The low note is C and the high note is c, an octave higher.  In the authentic lydian mode, the low note is F and the high note is f an octave higher.  Basically, the authentic mode goes from 1 to 1 while the plagal mode (the hypo mode) goes from 5 to 5.  Note also that Happy Birthday in F uses a Bb, while the lydian mode we all know has a B natural.  In medieval music, they were both used.  It wouldn't have made sense to transpose the hypolydian mode; it was from C to C, and maybe it had a B natural or maybe it had a Bb, but it was still C to C.\n\nAs should be apparent, the modern conception of modes is quite different from the medieval version!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408403802", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The straw man fallacy at work, ladies and gentlemen!\n\n&gt;That's a very strong claim, but then you follow it up with a caveat which can be stretched to allow even very tenuous connections between wars and religion. \n\nYes, because I know not all wars are caused by religion.

It's my argument, so I get to tell you what it is. All of the words in my argument matter. I worded it in the manner I did because it presents an accurate representation of my argument. Words mean things.\n\n&gt;This is clearly a pointless exercise\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;IDGAF if it's written by a rabbi\n\nI know, but the source of a claim is important in measuring the claim. You suggested that any claim I make would have untoward anti-theist bias because I am an anti-theist, which, by the way, commits an appeal to motives. If you are to be intellectually consistent, then you would also have to hold the position that a blog post by a Rabbi would have untoward theist bias because he is a theist, though still fallacious reasoning.\n\n&gt;this article is in-line with the mainstream understanding\n\nThis is an example of both the argumentum ad populum and faulty generalization fallacies.

{"body": "Minerva sounds like an excellent way to make higher education accessible to thousands of international and/or impoverished kids as well as older adults looking to get an education. I'm very pleased to see that they're incorporating learning and memory research into their teaching style, I completely agree that the lecture style of teaching needs to be reformed (or even replaced.)\n\n\n\nThat having been said I find the idea of Minerva tremendously overblown and unoriginal. Most of the article seemed to simply drone on and on about the horrors of the traditional state schools with lecture halls filled with hundreds of students, as though this were the only type of university in existence. To cut straight to the point the article seemed completely oblivious of the existence of small liberal arts universities like the one I currently attend. I couldn't agree more that the lecture method of teaching is overrated at best, but this is not a new problem. At any liberal arts college you will get the same thing Minerva is offering - small discussion based classes, breaking up into smaller groups, having to argue a point, short pop quizzes, etc. while also getting \"The College Experience\" that everyone else has been talking about. I was also bemused by the point they made about pop quizzes being chaotic IRL, requiring paper and pencil, and a long time to sort through. In a class I took recently we had a system where everyone had a printed piece of paper with the letters A B C D on it, with each letter occupying a different colored block. At a couple points during the class the professor would ask a multiple choice question with 4 possible answers (you guessed it - A,B,C,D) and each student would then fold the paper over the expose the letter they thought was the right answer and would raise their card. This allowed the professor to quickly assess the answer that most people thought was correct as well as allowing her to easily group us with people who answered differently so that we could discuss our different answers. Alternatively, other classes required you to buy a \"clicker\" that was basically the digital equivalent of the ABCD cards so that professors could ask a multiple choice question to the class and then quickly assess who was saying what. The point of all of this is that while I agree the lecture style is deeply flawed, *solutions already exist.* I fail to see how Minerva is any better than a small run-of-the-mill liberal arts college. And while liberal arts colleges come with a prohibitively high sticker price (often $50,000/year or more,) I cannot name a single person at my university that actually pays sticker price or even anything close to it, thanks to generous financial aid. \n\n**TL;DR Minerva is great for opening higher education up to more students but strikes me as overblown given that small liberal arts colleges do everything Minerva does while also giving you the college experience**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408412162", "subreddit": "Futurology", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

Honestly, if I had it be exactly what I wanted, it would literally be no experience whatsoever. Just the flip of a switch from not knowing what Zen is talking about to knowing. No fanfare, no crazy light shows, no great death, just going \"oh, I get it now\" and then being able to read the koans and know exactly what they are trying to say, and laugh about how silly it all is, and being able to help other people that want to see it too.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nAll I know about enlightenment is that I will know it when I see it, and there won't be any question about it. This is really all I want, so that I can know that I am done with it. Seeing normal consciousness, even in the moments where nothing is added or subtracted, has not so far accomplished this knowing it when I see it. This is the only reason that I think there must be something more (or less) to it\"\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nit takes so long to sort out, you have m I s s e d&amp;nbsp; t h e&amp;nbsp;  b o a t and in the next life times you are down as a cane toad for three hundred generations ! :o)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----------------------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"I saw something several years ago and it went away but also didn't go away.

I kept going along and it continued to surprise me with new insights, but there was always something missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nI don't know what it is.

{"body": "Things to consider within the rules. Aside from looking for creative ways to gain advantage.\n\n\nFa l l i n g\n\nA fall from a great height is one o f the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end o f a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6.\nThe creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\n\n\nS u f f o c a t i n g\n\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\nWhen a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.\n\nH i d e\n\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.\n\nH e l p\n\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\n\nU n s e e n A t t a c k e r s a n d T a r g e t s\n\nCombatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking\nin darkness. \nWhen you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.\nWhen a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.\nIf you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\n\nG r a p p l in g\n\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one o f them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.\nUsing at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\n\nSh o v in g a C r e a t u r e\n\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one o f them.\nThe target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.\nYou make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)\n\n\nSo some quick ideas that spring to mind:\n\n*throwing someone off a cliff, a balcony, a flight of stairs, a big or an over sized foyer step.\n\n*dragging someone into the water and drowning them\n\n*knocking someone prone and having the group kick them when they are down\n\n*dragging someone to a dark corner harboring a hidden ally", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408483424", "subreddit": "dndnext", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; If you have the time to explain to me how monoidal categories work\n\nLet's figure it out!\n\nHere is [Monoidal from category-extra](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/category-extras-0.53.5/docs/Control-Category-Monoidal.html#t:Monoidal):\n\n    class (Associative k p, HasIdentity k p i) =&gt; Monoidal k p i | k p -&gt; i where\n      idl :: k (p i a) a\n      idr :: k (p a i) a\n\nIt's a bit abstract, so let's instantiate `k` with `(~&gt;)`,  `p` with `(,)`, and `i` with `()`:\n\n    idl :: ((), a) ~&gt; a\n    idr :: (a, ()) ~&gt; a\n\nAh, so it's a language in which there is a special `i` which, unlike arbitrary variables, can be freely introduced or eliminated. So what else is special about `i`? Here is what the `HasIdentity` constraint has to say about it:\n\n    class (PFunctor p r t, QFunctor p s t) =&gt; Bifunctor p r s t | p r -&gt; s t, p s -&gt; r t, p t -&gt; r s where\n      bimap :: r a b -&gt; s c d -&gt; t (p a c) (p b d)\n\n    class Bifunctor p k k k =&gt; HasIdentity k p i | k p -&gt; i\n\nAgain, things become much clearer when we instantiate `k` with `(~&gt;)` and `p` with `(,)`. Plus a bit of alpha-renaming for extra clarity:\n\n    bimap :: (a ~&gt; a') -&gt; (b ~&gt; b') -&gt; (a,b) ~&gt; (a',b')\n\nWe didn't learn much about `i`, but at least we know that `p` is a binary type constructor whose values can be manipulated element-wise. Something like `(,)` or `Either`. What else do we know about `p`?\n\n    class Bifunctor p k k k =&gt; Associative k p where\n      associate :: k (p (p a b) c) (p a (p b c))\n\nWow, this one is really unrecognizable in prefix form. Our usual infix instantiation allows the name `Associative` to make a lot more sense:\n\n    associate :: ((a,b),c) ~&gt; (a,(b,c))\n\nI am quite surprised to see that the other direction, `coassociate`, is a member of a completely separate class which isn't required by `Monoidal`.\n\n    class Bifunctor s k k k =&gt; Coassociative k s where\n      coassociate :: k (s a (s b c)) (s (s a b) c)\n\n    coassociate :: (a,(b,c)) ~&gt; ((a,b),c)\n\nAnyway, now we're starting to see why `Monoidal` is named that way. It's a category `k` with a type-level operator `p` which is associative and which has an identity element `i`, just like `mappend` and `mempty` from `Monoid`. The major difference is that `p` is at the type level, and that the associativity and identity equations use `k` instead of `(=)`.\n\n    idl :: ((), a) ~&gt; a\n    idr :: (a, ()) ~&gt; a\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408500996", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[3x3 for the last seven days](http://i.imgur.com/esETox3.jpg). \n\nHaven't really found anything super exciting during the past week so have mainly been digging through backlog and listening to old favorites. But I'll mention some new things I'm passionate about. \n\nFrom the 3x3: \n\n**Colin Stetson - New History Of Warfare Vol 1**\n\nHaven't really listened to anything by this guy before, but have been eager to get into him and decided to start with his debut. Really interesting, experimental saxophone music. This album feels very raw and a bit abrasive at times, with half the album consisting of longer tracks, making up the bulk of the album and being the most interesting parts of the album, with shorter songs playing out between the 7-8 minute tracks which mostly favor more orthodox and a bit calmer instrumentation. It's a really cool album and Stetson is definitely a unique artist that I highly recommend. \n\n**The Caretaker - An Empty Bliss Beyond This World**\n\nAnother interesting album that I can't decide if I like or find incredibly pretentious. The whole album sounds like the kind of stuff you'd hear playing somewhere down in Rapture. Every track is a lo-fi filtered version of typical early 20th century music. Everything is instrumental and pretty homogenous, but it's still a cool album and the downsides aren't off putting enough for me to not be able to listen to it front-to-back and enjoy it. \n\n**Half-Handed Cloud - Flying Scroll Flight Control**\n\nGot this recommended to me in an AOTY discussion. This guy is signed at Astmathic Kitty and there are tons of similarities to Sufjan, what with all the religious themes and the overall folk-sound to it. Every track however is around the 2-minute length, and while I first though it would hamper the album's quality and make it sound rushed and disjointed, it still feels very solid and you quickly forget the fact that the songs are actually incredibly short. Would recommend if you're looking for something similar to Sufjan. \n\nThen I'll make a shoutout to something not on my 3x3: \n\n**B L A C K I E - Imagine Yourself In A Free Natural World**\n\nOne of my favorites this year so far and I have no idea how to describe this album. It's kind of free-jazz, but that's just the base of the album and I have a hard time seeing how someone would like this album just from being a fan of free-jazz. Anyone else around who's listened to it and feel like discussing it? Dropping a link to B L A C K I E's bandcamp where the album is up for streaming [right here](http://blackieallcapswithspaces.bandcamp.com/album/imagine-your-self-in-a-free-and-natural-world-2014).

{"body": "Diamond V Orianna main here.\n\nSo here's the thing: early game, Xerath is just *better* than Orianna. If you trade with him whenever he tries to poke, you'll deal more damage, but you'll also waste much more mana than him, specially because of his passive. And as soon as you run out of mana he'll just dominate the lane.\n\nThe solution is: don't bother trading. The best thing to avoid his poke is to keep your ball on yourself most of the time to benefit from the added MR, and shield whenever he uses his Q. You'll take minimal damage, and if you follow /u/Straikkarr126's tip, he'll have to choose between doing very low damage to you or farming creeps.\n\nAlso, a better way to dodge his Q: whenever he starts casting it (before the telegraph, when he just changes his stance) start walking left or right and only change direction when the telegraph appears on the ground. Most of the times the Xerath will try to compensate for your movement and shoot the skillshot ahead of you, making it easier to just stop and dodge it.\n\nAlso, like /u/Magnus77 said, get boots earlier than usual (even before the chalice if you don't have gold for both).\n\nThe situation will change whenever you get your first blue buff. From then on you should try to poke him with your Q (keep the ball next to him and try to hit him on EVERY cooldown). Don't bother using your W, since it will probably be at a low level and the damage it deals doesn't compensate for the mana cost. If you have your chalice (or parts of it) and keep only spamming Q on him, you shouldn't run out of mana, but you will make his life hell.\n\nIf then he tries to trade with you, do a Q W E combo (making sure to put the ball slightly behind him so that E also deals damage) and keep auto attacking him until your shield goes away.

{"body": "Leblanc is very versatile in her play style. The thing is you need to understand that you need to get an early lead and then snowball this lead by providing significant pressure throughout the map.\n\nI typically go the normal dfg/sorcs/void/death/zhonyas then usually banshees after. The reason I go banshees is because without the silence, you are prone to a lot more cc abilities and banshees can allow you to finish the combo and get out before getting stunned.\n\nTeam fighting is difficult. Focusing on just the carries can be good but you often blow your own positioning and die before you do much. You can often start fights peeling with your e and waiting for a misstep from an important carry.\n\nI learned a lot honestly by just watching vods of faker playing Leblanc in both solo queue and ogn. His decision making and the tactics he uses will honestly improve your gameplay tenfold if you start to understand why he did certain things. There was a specific game that I found extremely helpful and changed the way I play Leblanc but unfortunately I'm on my phone and can't remember which.\n\nWhat I learned though is you don't have to kill someone. You don't need to make the fantastic plays to kill the carry. Instead look to just provide lots of pressure by constantly jumping in and doing a q-e then instantly going out. Or w q r e and press w as you e so the chain extends and hits them while putting you back to safety. What this allows you to do is provide killing pressure and make them back off turrets and such giving large advantages.\n\nBasically, push lane opponent out of lane. Find their jungler. Kill them or force them out. Kill other lanes or atleast force them out. Team fights look to peel and provide quick bursts to opponents before fight happens to provide killing pressure and so on.\n\nIdk how helpful this is. I use to play a lot of Leblanc this season but haven't much since silence nerf. It created a lot more difficulty playing her and made match ups favor the opponent. However her damage is still incredibly high and can easily win games still.\n\nEdit: ask more specific questions and I can try and help", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408593970", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

C and G in the melody. what chord could we apply that has both those notes? i'm going to go with an D#6. but you could go to, say a Bb9#5.\n\nthe Dmin-notes over this chord are F E. we go through the same thing but try to get some continuity from the last chord we chose. i'm going to put a G#9 under the F melody note and for the E a C#m7. now we have a nice jazzy II6-V9 i7, with a cute little borrowed chord.\n\nobviously i used a pretty condensed example, most songs are going to have more than 2 notes per chord. the point is you can get as liberal as you want with the harmony, the idea is to maintain the integrity of the melody to begin with. \n\ncontinue on with this until you're happy with what you've got :). let me know if you need any more explanations. i found it kinda difficult to explain without any manuscript, frikin sibelius 7 takes too long to load up. \n\ni had fun with this so i finished the chord progression, probably still needs some work\n\n|C--G--F--|E -----| F------A----G  :||  \n\nD#6 - G#9| C#m7 | F#m^  Faug Bb9:||\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408617211", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Tom and Ben were originally the frontmen in rival bands in their hometown. Higham was jumping around on stage making heavy metal while Fletcher was thrashing out melodic grunge rock.  Higham then started producing tracks solo – just him and his guitar. Fletcher, too, started putting his solo songs on SoundCloud. Tom and Ben are neighbours. So, after stumbling across Fletcher's music online Higham suddenly thought he could start making music with &amp;quot;that lad across the road&amp;quot;.

{"body": "A preface to this... most R&amp;B tunes will have 7ths (or 9ths, or sometimes 11ths and 13ths) in all of their chords.  Like with jazz, often when you're talking about chord progressions for this type of music, it's almost implied that any given chord bigger than the label.  Something like ii-V-vi-I in the key of C won't just be Dm-G-Am-C.  It's much more likely to come out at Dm9-G7b9-Am9-CMaj13#11 or something.  At the very least it will be Dm7-G7-Am7-CMaj7.   The extra colors you add are a matter of preference and style.\n\nSo the other parts to get are the quick shortcuts for the types of 7th chords.  m7 would refer to a minor 7th chord like Dm7.  dom7 refers to a dominant 7th.  When written, it's the one without any other marks like G7.  Major 7ths are the other ones usually as something like CMaj7.\n\nSo when I say dom7#5, I would mean (in the key of C) A7#5.  Basically a an a dominant 7 with the 5th raise.  You're moving from an Am7 to an A7#5.  So instead of the chord being A C E G it's A C# E# G.\n\nYou can actually find this in an open position by just playing an A7 and adding a finger to the high E string moving it up to E# (F).  \n\nYou should look into some moveable voicings for m7, dom7s and Maj7 chords.  I'm sure you can find some \"jazz\" lessons online that will help you get started.  There are  several moveable  shapes both with and without barres for these chords.  But also be aware that you can almost always throw a 9th on top of any of these chords as well and it work, especially in heavier jazz or R&amp;B.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408765039", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Early on you just wanna farm, push hard enough to keep him in lane, and not let him snowball so the lack of damage isn't a problem at all. I will then finish Zhonyas and by this point you are pretty much impossible for him to zero out and you provide way more presence in team fights and extended fights. Try to convince your team to group and stick together. \n\nI turn the glacial shroud into Frozen Heart usually 3rd or 4th item. People think it's stupid cause it's rare but everything in it synergizes well with Orianna (You won't have any Mregen without Athenes so the big mana pool is good).\n\nNote: With a talon mid, the enemy team USUALLY has a really AD heavy team which is why I do this. If for some reason they end up with like Amumu jungle, ryze top, and zyra support...you may want to steer clear from THAT much armor stacking even vs a talon.\n\nThis strategy should work fine vs a Zed too.

Dsus2 just has the notes D E and A.

You can also play a D minor pentatonic scale (D F G A C E) over the D7 because those notes are the 1, #9 (a b3 when there is also a 3), 11 (a 4 when there is a 3), 5, 13 (a 6 when there is a 7), and b7 of D7. Those are all fair game over a dominant 7 chord. You wouldn't want to play all of the notes in D minor though.

{"body": "Tetrachords are essentially tools for teaching scales: they are more useful for learning the basics than for actually writing/playing music.\n\nA tetrachord is like a scale, but only half as long: it has only 4 notes instead of 7. Most familiar scales are made up of two tetrachords joined together.\n\nFor example, the most important tetrachord is the \"major tetrachord\" that consists of two whole steps &amp; a half step (WWH). So, for example, C D E F and F# G# A# B are two examples of the major hexachord.\n\nYou can build a major scale by combining two major tetrachords, separated by a whole step. For example, to build the E major scale: \n\n**(1)** build a major tetrachord starting on E: E F# G# A\n\n**(2)** go up a whole step from the last note (from A up a whole step to B)\n\n**(3)** build a new major tetrachord starting on the new note: B C# D# E\n\n**(4)** put the two tetrachords together for the major scale: E F# G# A B C# D# E\n\n\nYou can build other scales using different combinations of tetrachords. For example, the natural minor scale is a minor tetrachord (WHW) plus a phrygian tetrachord (HWW) a whole step higher. Thus D E F G (minor tetrachord) plut A Bb C D (phrygian tetrachord). \n\nOr another example: you can build an octatonic (or \"diminished\") scale by combining two minor tetrachords a *half*-step apart. For example D E F G (minor tetrachord) + G# A# B C# (another minor tetrachord) is an octatonic scale.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408832535", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Add one ability to a keybind and hit a dummy with it until it feels normal.  Then add more, maybe a defensive cooldown to Z or X etc.  It's going to be like building a house, you need to make a foundation first.\n\nI can promise you that keybinding will improve your gameplay dramatically once it feels natural.

Take for example racing sports, they're called motorsports and their competitors are called \"race car drivers\" or \"riders\". They don't really try to pass themselves off as athletes in the traditional sense but they do have much more athletic bodies and fitness levels than many of the \"e-Sports athletes\". Not only that but folks seem to forget that \"e-Sports\" is a marketing ploy from day one. You really think old school gamers gave a shit to be recognized as playing a sport or a game? Nah they didn't they just wanted to macro hard or frag newbs. Back in my day we called them competitive gamers that happened to play e-Sports. It is funny how DoTA2 makes fun of itself in the \"eSports\" scene by calling it  D I G I T A L SP O R T S. \n\n\nNow, as for chess? I've seen chess mentioned on ESPN from time to time but that is because the game of chess has been around forever and the rules haven't changed since forever. Meanwhile the rules of League keep dramatically changing from month to month. BTW the rules of league are the balance cycles. I remember IronStylus once comparing the longetivity potential of League to another 5v5 game with a map that hasn't changed in a really long time; basketball. Same difference there though, basketballs rules haven't changed dramatically in forever. Cool thing though that although League has its bugs/wonky mechanics here and there, Basketball has its bad calls.

All students had music classes including music theory and choir. \n\nWhen my buddy gave me the scantron I start thinking to myself \"OK I'm fucked for this test\". But 5 seconds later I'm come up with the best cheat sheet ever. I get my music staff paper book out and start writing notes of a song down. Let's call this song Beautiful History Song. I turned all the scantron answers in to notes on a treble clef staff! It was great. I knew that my history teacher knew zero about music theory. I left that music sheet paper out on my desk for the entire test. The history teacher actually came over during his walk arounds, picked up the music paper and goes \"what's this?\". I am scared shit because I'm thinking he may know more than I gave him credit for. \"Music theory\" I said. He puts it back down on my desk. I got a 93 on the history test :-D\n\nThank you for knowing nothing about music theory Mr. Donahue. \n\nTlL; DR got answers from scantron and put them on to music staff paper to create a cheat sheet.

{"body": "Because of tonics. C major and D Dorian have the same notes, but they don't imply the same tonal center. The tonal center is the note of resolution. It's usually the root of the first chord of the musical phrase and usually the end chord of a section. Also the resolution in the melody on that last chord usually goes 2-&gt;1 or 7-&gt;1. So in A minor it would be G-&gt;A or B-&gt;A, in C major it would be D-&gt;C or B-&gt;C.\n\nA C major progression could be C D E G(with B or D in the melody) over and over until it reaches the cadence and then it would be C D G(with C or D in the melody) C (and C in the melody).\n\nA D dorian progression could be D E G C (with C or E in the melody) reapeting over and over until you reach the cadence then it would be D G C (with C or E in the melody) D (with D in the melody).\n\nSo as you can see they use the exact same chords, the only thing that changes is the order and the melody. It's where it begins and where it ends that decides the tonic. Also the D Dorian progression I showed is just an example, usually you want to avoid V-&gt;I (G-&gt;C) movements where I is not the tonic because otherwise it strongly implies that I is the tonic, even if in this case, we want D to be the tonic, not C.

Fee, *The First Epistle to the Corinthians*, p. 699ff:\n\n&gt; Although these two verses are found in all known manuscripts, either here or at the end of the chapter, the two text-critical criteria of transcriptional and intrinsic probability combine to cast considerable doubt on their authenticity.\n\nHe also lists in a footnote the manuscripts in which these verses have *somehow* managed to float to the end of the chapter; \"D F G 88* a b d f g Ambrosiaster Sedulius-Scotus, thus the entire Western tradition\".\n\nIbid.:\n\n&gt; Either (1) Paul wrote these words at this place and they were deliberately transposed to a position after v. 40; or (2) the reverse of this, they were written originally after v. 40 and someone moved them forward to a position after v. 33; or (3) they were not part of the original text, but were a very early marginal gloss that was subsequently placed in the text at two different places.

One can give good historical reasons both for the gloss itself and for its dual position in the text; but one is especially hard pressed to account for either option 1 or 2 had the other been original.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1408987674", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "We use \"mode\" in several different ways.  It's weird.  One way we use it has it mean nothing more than \"a scale derived from another scale by starting at the nth note\".  So the third mode of the major scale is the phrygian scale.  In that usage, \"mode\" and \"scale\" are pretty much interchangeable, but \"nth mode\" has the added technical definition of being a way to derive another scale.  The other way we use \"mode\" has to do with how we approach melody, and this one has somewhat less relevance in Western music.  While a scale is a collection of pitches, \"mode\" also includes how those pitches are used, melodic gestures and harmonic clichés, characteristic cadences, etc.  We don't have such formulaic music in our Western tradition from the Common Practice Period, but we *do* have it in folk music and especially in earlier church music -- and some less Western traditions, like the Ashkenaz Jewish tradition and the Arabic maqam tradition, still have it in full force!  There were eight church modes, four of them loosely analogous to some of our modes of the major scale and the other four their plagal variant.  For example, the dorian mode was D E F G A B C D -- though the B would end up flat quite often, and the C might end up sharp on occasion if the B was left natural.  Its plagal counterpart was the hypodorian mode, which was A B C D E F G A, but the D was still the tonic.  So the range of either mode was about an octave, but in the authentic mode, the octave goes from tonic to tonic, while in the plagal mode, the octave goes from dominant to dominant.  An example of a popular song today that's in a plagal mode is Happy Birthday.  If you start it on C, the range is from C to C, but the tonic is F.  These modes would be for liturgical use, so there might be a reciting tone as well -- the leader might read a passage in this mode; he would start at the initial note, get to the reciting tone, hang out there for a while, then do some ornamentation and end at the final note, the tonic.  This was sometimes the dominant, but it could be the mediant (3rd) as well.\n\nThese modes are actually quite different from how we view music today, which is a lot more free.  When music was a primarily vocal melody, the range was necessarily quite limited, and harmony was practically non-existent.  As harmony came into use, these modes fell into disuse.  They're almost completely unnecessary in instrumental music.  But the Jewish liturgical tradition still has a soloist-based vocal core, so prayer modes are still a useful concept -- different modes, with different melodic motifs and different scales, are used for different services.  The Ahavah Rabbah mode, for instance, is used for Saturday morning prayers and is based on the phrygian dominant scale (1 b2 3 4 5 b6 b7 1).  Technically, this mode doesn't repeat at the octave -- it's 6 b7 1 b2 3 4 5 b6 b7 1 2 b3 -- but unless you've rather deeply studied chazzanut, the art of the chazzan, the cantor, you will have never even heard these different notes -- the 6 in the lower octave and the 2 and b3 in the upper.  Most of the time, the low note is the b7 and the high note is the 1 and that's it.  Instrumental music uses the Ahavah Rabbah scale normally, without the non-octave-repeating extensions, often modulating to the harmonic minor mode on the 4 or the Ukranian-dorian (dorian #4) mode on the b7.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409004733", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can abuse his early game. A lot of people have mentioned merc treds, Zhonyas, or Banshees. These are good items, as they do negate a lot of his damage, however the best way would be to hit him hard early.\n\nIf you see a Veigar playing Farmville with his q, go after him. That is his main source of damage in lane. Also, his w and e have longer cooldowns early (14 seconds or so on his stun) so use that to your advantage. They also eat his mana hard early on. If you can bait out a stun and avoid it early, then he is very vulnerable. Once he uses a q to hit a minion, jump him. You may burn a flash. \n\nAlso, do not push the lane too hard against a Veigar. He is not terrible at farming under tower, and he can just hang out free from danger, unless you have skillshots, or are someone like Fizz who can avoid skills or tower shots. \n\nIf you see Veigar being smart, and using his q to harass, do not allow him to harass you without hitting him back. He is slow, and squishy. A Veigar will normally always q a cannon minion, as that give him 2 ap instead of 1. Use that to your advantage. He qs the cannon minion, jump him. Or, make him choose between harassing you and that nice cs + ap. \n\nAlso, his q does about 90 to 100 damage (depending upon his AP) at rank 1. It can stack up over time. \n\nOnce veigar gets DFG, he will burst most anyone, so try to make it so he gets delayed building that as long as you can. You can potentially do this by roaming. He is slow, so he will not be able to follow that well. Also, he cannot really shove the lane, so put him under tower and roam. Odds are, you can pick up a kill or two on bot. From there, you can take tower or drag. Then, you have put your team ahead. And you have only missed out in a few minions worth of CS. I think that trade is worth. Or, if you get kills on him early, you are not only succeeding but making him fail at the same time. \n\nThink of his power spikes as well. He will level his skills normally in this order: q e q w q r (then whatever else he likes. Normally maxing r then q then e then w)\n\nAlways try to abuse his weaknesses, poor early game, squishy, slow, and only one disengage, which is amazing in its own right, can be avoided. \n\nI am only B1/B2 so take this with a grain of salt, however, I do enjoy the master of evil and these are a few ways I have seen people really give me a headache.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409025194", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

If you only play the scale and don't emphasize the correct notes, you won't hear any differences. That is why playing the chord makes the mode stick out better. \n\nLet me explain the piano exercise a bit better. Maybe it will help.\n\nYou start with Ionian. You hold Cmaj (C E G) with your left hand, and an octave or two higher, you just play at a normal/slow pace, C D E F G A B. Play around with them, play random notes, play them in order, etc. The notes that sound best on right hand would be the chord tones (C E G).\n\nThen you move on to Dorian. You hold Dmin (D F A) with your left hand, then you play D E F G A B C with your right, as before.\n\nYou keep on moving one white key higher in the same fashion until you reach C again.\n\nAnother exercise which was a bit harder for me (not so experienced on piano) is to switch it a bit: instead of keeping the notes the same, we keep the root the same. So we go from C Ionian to C Dorian to C Phrygian, etc.\n\nSo basically left hand always stays on Cmaj, and you start with C major scale. Then you play C Dorian (C D Eb F G Bb). If you're unsure what the notes are in each mode, you can check [this](https://www.basicmusictheory.com/topic/mode) out. First column you can click on C for each mode and find the notes.\n\nI'm not sure how eloquent I was in explaining all this, but just try to follow the steps.

Sure you could do the mission twice in half the time, but you have to consider all the down time in between both missions. When you factor that in, you're actually making less per minute. We can also see that the pattern declines when you take longer than 6 minutes thus earning you less money per minute.\n\nOther tips that I can generate based on this info.\n\n* No longer is it optimal to drive to the location of a job before starting it. When you have to drive to the location in either case, it's best to drive there after starting the mission so that time spent goes to earning more cash.\n\n* If you are aware of your time spent on a mission, sometimes it may be better to wait an extra 30 seconds or so to increase your payout to the next tier. It depends on what that .2% more is and if it's worth the time. Since there is no way to tell in-game, this will require outside effort(stopwatch or something)\n\n* If you need to AFK to take the dog out or use the restroom, you could always afk at the end of a mission right before finishing it to stretch your time. It's kinda cheesy and I would only recommend this if you're playing solo. Beware that you can get booted for AFK'ing for too long.\n\nAll in all, just do all missions or just your favorite/most enjoyable. It doesn't matter if it takes a long time since you'll still be fairly compensated. This is basically my take on the new payouts and I'm enjoying the mission variety without feeling disappointed about payouts. \n\nThanks OP for the great and informative post.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409065053", "subreddit": "GrandTheftAutoV", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "For those having trouble following:\n\n\n\nKatarina leaves base and pops an AP/CD pot heading toward the five enemies. She flashes in but at a distance to the enemy group, presumably to avoid pre-planned hooks and cc. She then initiates with a Bouncing Blade (Q) to Ezreal and follows that up with a Shunpo (E) which teleports her to Ezreals location while dealing more damage.\n\n\n\nOnce at the location she invokes a quick Sinister Steel (W) dealing Aoe Damage to surrounding enemies and immediately proceeds to cast Death Lotus (R). This causes Ezreals death which engages Katarina's passive and reduces the her cooldowns by 15 seconds, making her Q,W, and E available again. \n\n\n\nShe then throws a Q at Thresh and an E to Mundo. This kills the Mundo and provides another CD reduction of 15s thus giving a 'free' shunpo. She then hits another W for AoE damage. \n\n\nWith Eve, Thresh, and Graves being the only ones left she then shunpo's to Eve, killing her with the magic damage and causing another reset which allows her to finish off Thresh with another W. \n\n\n\nWith 4 kills now completed her passive ensures her  ultimate is now back off cooldown and it is just the assassin Katarina and her prey Graves, both at about half health. Kata, of course, finishes the final kill off with the standard Q E W R combo and recieves the glory of the Pentakill. \n\n\n\n**EDIT:** Calculations for keyboard actions per second (aps) show the entire event from her initial flash to Graves death happened in 4 seconds, from 0:23 to 0:27. With 13 keyboard presses for the special moves that means the player was performing at 3.25 (k)APS. This would not be directly comparable to actions per minute for the player as maintaining that level of kAPS is not expected in this game and this is more burst action than sustained action. But to get a grasp of the level of speed that is around 195 APM if kept up. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409069438", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A triad is basically the simplest conception of what a chord is in Western music, which is the kind of chord you get when you stack two intervals on top of each other, almost always \"thirds\" (either major or minor). As a guitarist, you may not have that much direct exposure to a \"raw\" triad because we usually end up playing extra copies of one or more of the three notes in a different octave.\n\nMaybe another way to think about it (and the way that I personally prefer) is like so: a triad is often composed of the first, third, and fifth notes of some scale or another. In the case of C major, that would be C, E, and G, derived like so:\n\n    v   v   v \n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n    C D E F G A B C\n\nOn your guitar, those notes could be represented by the chord fingered x320xx.\n\nNow, the \"quality\" of that triad (whether it's major, minor, diminished, or augmented) has to do with the relationships between the frequencies of those notes. If you were to count the number of frets (representing half-steps) between those notes in our example above, you should find a distance of 4 frets (or 4 semi-tones, corresponding to the interval we call a \"major third\") between the C and the E, and a distance of 3 frets (or 3 semi-tones, corresponding to the interval we call a \"minor third\") between the E and the G. That particular pattern happens to correspond to what our culture calls a \"major\" triad, or more generally a major chord.\n\nNow imagine another triad, this time derived from an A minor scale:\n\n    v   v   v  \n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n    A B C D E F G A\n\nSuch a chord might be fingered 532xxx on the guitar.\n\nIf you were to count the relationship between those notes, you'd find the relationship to be reversed from the major chord: A to C is 3 semitones (a minor third), and C to E is 4 semitones (a major third). That pattern gives us what we call a \"minor\" triad/chord.\n\nOne other useful thing to note is that not only do you have the two \"thirds\" intervals happening, you have the interval between the two notes that are separated most widely (the A and the E in our second example here). Those two are separated by 7 semitones (called a \"perfect fifth\") in both major and minor triads. There a couple of other types of triads too, but for the sake of simplicity I'll leave them out for now. Suffice it to say that a \"triad\" is basically a chord that you get when you stack two thirds on top of each other.\n\nSo, with all that as a basis, you may ask \"what happens when I add another interval of a third to my chord?\" Well, that's what a seventh chord is. Let's do the scale thing starting on G this time, but still working from C major in the sense that there are no sharps or flats:\n\n    V   V   V   V\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n    G A B C D E F G\n\nWe get GBDF, or xx0001 on the guitar. You can add extra copies of some of those notes on the unused strings there and get the \"classic\" G7 voicing, 320001.\n\nThis particular kind of 7th chord (the one called just *X*7 instead of *X*m7 or *X*maj7#5 or some other nonsense like that) is a \"dominant\" 7th chord. It's defined by its shape in that the first three notes are a \"major\" triad (that's a major third with a minor third on top) with an extra minor third on top. The intervals you get measuring up only from the bottom are:\n\n* G to B: A Major Third\n* G to D: A Perfect Fifth\n* G to F: A Minor Seventh\n\nAnd there are lots of other permutations there, each one of which has its own name and function. Plus, you can keep stacking extra thirds on top until you get to \"13th\" chords, at which point you run out of letters in the scale and we have to think up more creative names for the chord types.

{"body": "One thing that may be confusing you is that on guitar many notes are doubled or tripled when playing chords.    \nFor example Em: 022000 = E B E G B E   \nFrom a theory point of view Em chord (triad) is simply: E G B   \n\nChords that relate to certain scale are easily built by taking a note from a scale and then every other note following it. \n\nFor C major scale C D E F G A B C    \nthe triad (3 note) chords are:   \nC E G = C major triad - written as C (scale steps are 1 3 and 5)   \nD F A  = D minor triad - written as Dm (sometimes D-)   \nE G B  = E minor triad - written as Em (sometimes E-)   \nF A C = F major triad - written as F   \nG B D  = G major triad - written as G   \nA C E = A minor triad - written as Am (sometimes A-)   \nB D F = diminished triad - I will skip it for now     \n\nMajor chord have perfect 5th (7 semitones) and major 3rd (4 semitones) in them.   \nFor example C triad - C-G is perfect 5th. C-E is major 3rd.   \nMinor chord have perfect 5th (7 semitones) and minor 3rd (3 semitones) in them.   \nFor example A minor triad - A-E is perfect 5th. A-C is minor 3rd.   \n\nThe 4 note chords are:   \nC E G B = C major 7th - written as Cmaj7 (scale steps are 1 3 5 7)   \nD F A C = D minor 7th - written as Dm7 (sometimes D-7)   \nE G B D = E minor 7th - written as Em7 (sometimes E-7)   \nF A C E= F major 7th - written as Fmaj7     \nG B D F = G dominant 7th - written as G7    \nA C E G = A minor 7th - written as Am7 (sometimes A-7)   \nB D F A= B minor 7th with flatted 5th - Bm7b5 - I will skip it for now         \n\n\nSo what is the difference between \"major seventh\" chord like eg Cmaj7 and dominant 7th chord like G7.    \nLetsay you want to builf Gmaj chord.    \nYou would take G major scale: G A B C D E F# G and take 1 3 5 7 steps:   \nGmaj7 = G B D F#   \nand comparing to:    \nG7 = G B D F    \nyou see that the F# (7th in Gmaj7) was flatted to F.   \nBecause of that G7 chord does not belong to G major scale but rather to C major scale.   \n\nWhy dominant seventh chords are important? - because harmonically (withing usual Western major/minor system) the create strong tension toward resolution to major chord - eg. G7 resolving to C (or Cmaj7).    \n\nIn blues dominant 7th chords can often used statically - without resolving to related major chord.

{"body": "What they've done is offered you the opportunity to make things easier for yourself by limiting the keys to specific notes. The website starts off this way by limiting you to a set number of notes that sound nice together, such that no matter how they are arranged they sound harmonious (I'm not musically knowledgeable enough to say the precise name of the scale they use, but it's comprised of A B D E F#, possibly just selections from the A major scale? idunno).\n\nIn other words, if you highlight all 12 bottom bars, you have the full range of 12 notes available. The sequencer they have offers 16 notes, which gives you a whole octave and 4 more. This is probably purely so that you have a square, because it gives you 16 notes down as well: 16 semiquavers to make up 1 bar/4 beats in 4/4 time.\n\nBasically, what you can do very easily, and what I did with yours, is limit what you put down to an A major chord (I think they start with A rather than C, which is standard). What the sequencer does is loop the notes so that  horizontally the squares give A then C# then E, then A then C# then E again an octave up - and so on.\n\nThe 'minus' and 'plus' buttons allow you to shift the base/initial octave lower and higher.\n\n^(Apologies to anybody who actually knows what they're talking about musically.

I ain't sayin it's flat true, that we go to hell when we die.\n\nam sayin we got telepathy, which ain't nothing weird if you think about it, you'd expect we did, if you were an electronics person.\n\nbut that little tiny deal, telepathy, coupled with everything else known, especially that life and the world ain't got no duty to comply with our little expectations, reality don't have to obey our ideas, our ideas have to conform to reality, right?  how far you gonna get if you think you can just jump in your car and drive to Hawaii, right?  spose all the way if you're living on Hawaii, but you know what I mean.  want in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up fastest.  you know this as well as me.\n\nyou have telepathy.  it's so goddam unpleasant, you'll gnaw your tongue from the pain if it manifests.  you couldn't successfully live.  so the ones who tended to live had more and more wall between their consciousness and the rest of the world, mentally speaking.\n\nI don't influence that.  ain't learned how to influence what I pick up or the answers.  reason ancients did and dorks still do is because of the ego, survival.  easy to externalize and think it's some god or devil or some shit, alien maybe, talking to you, and easy to get egotistical if you survive the initial onslaught.\n\nbut so you don't see flagrant telepathy much these days.  those able to tune out better could concentrate better.  outcompete the more conscsiously telepathic.  ain't like I can shut it off, so it's like some scary , s c a r e y motherfucker, angel, devil, demon, god, my dead relatives, whatever, talkin to me all day.  all.  day.\n\npeople, I can tune out, I expect just like you can.\n\nthis.  this ain't so easy to tune out.\n\nperiod, ain't fuckin around, ain't lyin, ain't kiddin-  from where I sit, it strongly looks like we go to 'hell' when we die, and if we don't do something, we'll be in hell a miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiighty long time.\n\nwish it was different.  but I could wish I had a ....in fact I often have, wished I hadda pound of twenty different killer buds.  never changed the fact that most of the time, I ain't even got a bowl to smoke.\n\ngood chance we go to hell when we die, open to all the pain in the world.  lotta websites, including this one, where you can pretty quickly find shit make you sick, what people do to each other, and that's just some of all of the pain in the world.\n\nain't my doin.  i'm just describing what's happened to me, and tellin you what I think it means.\n\nbut im doing it from more knowledge than jesus or the pope or mohammed or the fuckin Buddha, any of them, even hawking or sagan or that smarmy fuck gets on here, Tyson.\n\nI take it serious.  sure wish other folk would too, we could maybe get our shit together and check this crap out, but ain't nobody getting it.\n\nI think it's so fuckin sucky, people just won't let themselves understand.\n\nonly one thing im promising.  if we all end up in hell together, and im able to, im gonna put some ...im gonna make hell just as bad as I can, cuz fuck errbody else, I done tried fuckin tellin ya.  nothing but contempt or more polite disbelief, ridicule, shit like that.\n\nwish I could grab the world by the fuckin neck and go HEY FUCKHEAD, MIGHT BE WE GO TO HELL, MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE OUGHTTA FUCKIN CHECK INTO AND YOU MIGHT REGRET IT MORE THAN WE EVEN HAVE WORDS FOR IF WE DON'T.\n\nbut I don't know how to do that.\n\ntelepathy is.  means hell has a very good chance of existing too, just the way it is.\n\nI don't pm, I just talk in public, but I can check back if you still wanna chat.\n\nyou be good, amos.  id smoke bowls with you just on the strength of the name alone.

{"body": "**--------= = = = B Y Z A N T I N E S = = = =--------**\n\nIn Age of Empires 2, the Byzantines were designed as a strong Imperial civ. In real life, they started off as the strongest regional power but got weaker and weaker and weaker as time went on. I wanted to depict that fact. I also wanted to depict the Byzantines' overall strong army. In AoE2, the Byzantines have bad Siege but in real life that would have been one of their strengths.\n\nMost important units:\n\nKataphraktos - No fucking clue, but I want to make the Kataphraktos seem like a fast moving Siege weapon. Maybe the Kataphraktos will lose the anti-Infantry thing but do splash damage.\n\nTrebuchet - The Byzantines pretty much invented the medieval Trebuchet. Their Trebs will be cheaper and fully upgradeable and in fact will be the only useable Siege weapon in the Imperial Age.\n\nHalberdier - I want the Byzantines to be forced to rely on common units. Halbs are the most common military unit and are not very offensively strong but are a meatshield that can protect Byzantine Siege weapons through the age. In Imperial, the Byzantines will have to use Halbs and faster healing Monks to stall out their enemies and provide the anvil to the Kataphraktos' hammer...somehow.\n\nMonk - As a throwback, the Byzantine Monks will be the best at healing their buddies. The Monk is another common unit.\n\nVillager - Somehow the Villager will be useful to keep up the theme. Maybe they'll be building extra strong walls and towers? This will depict the Byzantines as being desperate. Commoners were the most important factor in defending Constantinople from the Turks.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**UNIQUES AND BONUSES**\n\n&gt;Bodyguard line +33% attack speed\n\n* This is a stronger version of the Japanese bonus applied to one unit. The Bodyguard line is not very offensively oriented but Byzantine ones are. They will have high defense AND high attack, just lacking a bit in speed. In real life, Byzantine Infantry was the best in the world when properly deployed and trained, seeing as how they were descended from the Legions. The Byzantines will be lacking in offensive techs like in AoE2 to make up for their attack speed.\n\n&gt;Aging up costs -15% or maybe Feudal Age costs -33%\n\n* The idea is that the Byzantines will have no strong eco bonus and be pretty slow but able to quickly advance and take advantage of new techs in each Age, especially Siege in the Feudal Age. The historical basis for this bonus is that the Byzantines never really experienced a Dark Age, and they were always \"ahead\" of their contemporaries.\n\n&gt;Buildings +10/20/30% HPs?\n\n* Same exact bonus as in AoE2.\n\n&gt;Siege units cost -15%\n\n* This applies to ALL Siege weapons. The Slavs bonus from Age of Empires 2. The Byzantines, however, do not have much in the way of Imperial Age upgrades and they do not have Petards. So they aren't a huge Imperial Age powerhouse like the Slavs are. Anyway, every Byzantine deployment featured catapults and ballistas. The Byzantines nearly invented every Siege weapon depicted in Age of Empires 2.\n\n&gt;Team Bonus: \n\n&gt;Unique Unit: Kataphraktos: splash damage cavalry?\n\n* I have no idea how to make the Kataphraktos more unique.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: Schism: \n\n* A reference to the schism between the eastern and western Churches, leading to a much more unique identity and bad times for the Byzantines.\n\n&gt;Unique Tech: \n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n**TECH TREE EXCLUSIONS:**\n\n&gt;Infantry: full, but miss offensive techs\n\n* Similar to how in Age of Empires 2, the Byzantines will lack my equivalents of Blast Furnace and Iron Casting but get everything else. So their Pikemen and Great Swordsmen will be alright when making use of their attack bonuses but bad otherwise.\n\n&gt;Cavalry: offensive techs missing\n\n* If it were up to me, Byzantine Paladins in Age of Empires 2 would have Bloodlines but miss Iron Casting. Anyway, the Byzantines should get all the units but not all the techs.\n\n&gt;Archery: no Arbalister, Atlatl, Elephant\n\n* So crossbows weren't used much by the Byzantines. Byzantine chroniclers described French crossbows with awe, so they weren't very common. Byzantines didn't have Atlatls or Elephants, but I was thinking of somehow giving them Atlatls because they used staff slings which would be a stronger version of the weapons the Slingers and Skirmishers use.\n\n&gt;Siege...ry?: no Capped Ram, Onager, Siege Tower, Cannon, Bombard, Petard\n\n* Byzantine Siege sucks in the Imperial Age like in Age of Empires 2 buuuuut it's pretty great up until then due to that cheapness.\n\n&gt;Navy: Really great all game somehow\n\n* Byzantines had dominance of the Mediterranean Sea at the outset of the Middle Ages and even repelled Turkish naval attacks up until Constantinople fell.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409294053", "subreddit": "thebattler", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Not just for the so(n) situation, but for gl(n), see http://www.mathem.pub.ro/bjga/v18n2/B18-2-an.pdf (and the sources they cite therein).\n\n&gt; do you have any idea what does this mean for non-orthogonal matrices with positive unitary determinant, ie. SL(n) (or in my case a subgroup of SL(n) )? Can something similar be shown?\n\nBe careful with language, I think you mean a matrix with a **unit** determinant --- a \"unitary matrix\" means \"a matrix whose complex conjugate transpose is the inverse matrix\".\n\nLets try it! Consider an N-by-N matrix \"close to the identity\", i.e., may be written as M=(I+epsilon*X) where \"epsilon\" is a small number, etc.\n\nWhat defines SL(N)? The property det(M)=1. We can recall properties of the determinant (or look it up on Wikipedia) that det(I+epsilon*X)=1+epsilon*tr(X)+(terms involving epsilon^2 ).\n\nBut we wanted det(I+epsilon*X)=1. That means tr(X)=0.\n\nSo X belongs to sl(N) if and only if tr(X) = 0.\n\n**Exercise:** If U(N) is the set of unitary N-by-N matrices, i.e., matrices M such that M^† = M^-1 (where M^† is the [conjugate transpose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_transpose) of M), then what is its Lie algebra condition?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409322843", "subreddit": "learnmath", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The superficial answer is that computers really like powers of two. There are two possible values a bit can be, one nibble = 4 bits = 2^2, one byte = 8 bits = 2^3, one word = either 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, or 64 bits, depending on the CPU (most computers have either 32 or 64 bits per word, my graphing calculator has 8 bits)).\n\nIf you use units that aren't powers of two, you either end up wasting memory or wasting processing power. Let's say that I have some data which takes up only 6 bits. If I have an array of those, and lay them out one at a time, I'll get something like this in memory:\n\n    A A A A A A B B B B B B C C C C C C \n\nHowever, like I said, computers are good at working with powers of two. For example, lets say that I was using a computer with an 8-bit processor. That means that each \"chunk\" of memory is 8 bits long:\n\n    A A A A A A B B | B B B B C C C C | C C . . . . . .\n\nIf memory is split into blocks of 8, that means that in order to retrieve the value of 'A', I have to get the first byte and ignore the last two bits, to get 'B', I have to retrieve _two_ bytes and lop off the ends, etc. So, paradoxically, it'd be more efficient to have some wasted space and store my data like this:\n\n    A A A A A A . . | B B B B B B . . | C C C C C C . .\n\nI don't _need_ all the bits, but the alternative is decreased speed and performance. However, note that we haven't _actually_ wasted any space in the long run. We have two extra bits per data, true, but overall the entire array ends up taking 3 bytes of memory either way.\n \nUnfortunately, I can't really answer the question as to why computers favor the number 2 and powers of 2 in general. I can handwave and say it has something to do with hardware/binary/two options being easier to deal with then multiple, but these kinds of low-level details aren't really my forte. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409323971", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 88, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;  that's just me making sure that when there is a revolution and people are attacking a corporation, \n\nNo- the corporation initiates violence (attacks people) to enforce their opinions of property.  The public practices self-defense, not \"attacks.\"\n\nI have explained this to you repeatedly, &amp; at this point (if you continue to spam me while not understanding that) I'll just have to assume you're illiterate.\n\n&gt; I mentioned regular civilians and workers \n\nI debunked that.  Stop the spam.\n\n&gt; So you're saying when workers attack their exploiters\n\nSelf-defense != attacks.\n\n&gt; but if exploiters attack workers violently it's statism?\n\nInitiating violence to claim territory which you use to exploit others is the standard form of statism.\n\n&gt; [Various rants confusing self-defense with aggressive exploitation]\n\nJust reread my previous replies until you understand them.\n\n&gt; Where did I say the powerful among the public overpower the weak? \n\nIf someone is enforcing their opinions, it's the powerful overpowering the weak.\n\n     P e r i o d.\n\nDeal with that reality, or be dishonest &amp; denial.  Choose one.\n\n&gt; If someone violently attacks someone else without the means of self-defense, then that person is still considered sane \n\nThat would include you, from the perspective people you want the state to govern.\n\n&gt;  thanks for ignoring my point on how Orwell was in favor of [\"rehab\" prisons]\n\nThat's not a point.  I don't believe whatever Orwell believes, and you didn't even quote him.  If he did claim alleged  \"rehab centers\" weren't prisons he'd be lying.\n\n&gt;  And if they weren't practicing anarchism what were they practicing?\n\nIf they had prisons the anarchism (a peaceful society without violent hierarchy) had ended, or had not been achieved, and they were practicing statism.\n\n&gt; If you only want freedom for yourself and not others \n\nComplete reading failure.\n\n\nWhat I said *endorsed* the same freedom for everyone.\n\n&gt; No I want the rest of society to control the rest of society. \n\nAgain, that's dishonest language.  The truth is in a conflict the strong are violently overpowering the weak.  That (statism) is what you support.\n\n&gt;&gt;  Any group of violent people (even a tiny number) who violently govern the rest of society would be the state.\n\n&gt; Historically that's never been the case. \n\nI'm explaining what a word means.  History can not disprove such.\n\n&gt;  You don't know if Joe was provoking the attack before seen in the video\n\nI obviously meant the camera showed the first violence, not suddenly turned on mid fight.\n\n&gt;  you don't know what the relationship is \n\nIt's irrelevant.  \n\nWhat matters (when determining who attacked) is who initiated violence first.\n\n&gt;  Plus if you need a camera to prove this, would that mean there would be cameras everywhere watching your every move in your said society?\n\nThe public's cameras, phones, security cameras, etc.  Not the state's cameras.\n\n&gt;  think the only solution when it comes to figuring out who's guilty in an attack is figuring out the main intentions. \n\nIf someone punches someone else, their intentions are shown on the tape (to punch) and no quack is needed.\n\n&gt;  my point is people can use the term \"self-defense\" as a justification to kill someone for their own pleasure.\n\nThat wouldn't be self-defense.\n\n&gt; He wasn't shot for self-defense\n\nNo one knows if TM initiated violence because there wasn't a camera.

{"body": "If you have the time and money, sign up for drum lessons for a few months. Tell your instructor you want to focus on rhythmic fundamentals. \n\nIf you already have a complete comfortable understanding of beat divisions (triplets, sixteenth notes, etc) then you should work things out on paper. \n\n5 quarter notes could also be 10 eighth notes. Remove some of the down beats and now you have an interesting 5/4 rhythm. Add some sixteenth notes, remove some strums, etc. It's very helpful to do this on paper or on programming software, since the rhythms can very often feel unnatural. \n\nLearn to count odd rhythms as well. It feels strange but it helps enormously.\n\nHere's an example. Ten eighth notes would be counted (and strummed) as follows (d = down, u = up)\n\n    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 +\n    d u d u d u d u d u\n\nLet's remove a few eighth notes. How about we take away + of 1, the 3, and + of 5. We won't strum them, but we will still count them. The counts in ( ) will be counted VERY softly, and the strums in ( ) will completely miss the strings.\n\nWe're left with this\n\n\n    1 (+) 2 + (3) + 4 + 5 (+)\n    d (u) d u (d) u d u d (u)\n\nKeep in mind that most strumming patterns will stick to the rule of DOWN strum on a DOWN beat (1 2 3 4 5), and UP strum on and UP beat (the \"+\"'s).\n\nIf 16th notes are present, then you'd change all the eighth notes to down strums and use up strums for the e's and a's of the 16th notes.\n\nIf some of this stuff is above your head, then just go research rhythm fundamentals on wikipedia or elsewhere.

{"body": "&gt;No- the corporation initiates violence (attacks people) to enforce their opinions of property. The public practices self-defense, not \"attacks.\"\n\nIf the corpoation initaes violence from the geto(before the revolution) then why not attack it during the revolution, even if at that brief moment its not attacking you or your comrades? Also the thing about capitalism is there must be a minoirty rich and a majoirty poor. If there was global class mobility the rich would have issues maintaining power, money and prodcutivty. Therefore they \"protect themselves\" by maintaining plutocracy. In the proespective of the plutocrats, if the workers rebel, they would send roit police to defend themselves.\n\n\n\n&gt;I have explained this to you repeatedly, &amp; at this point (if you continue to spam me while not understanding that) I'll just have to assume you're illiterate.\nI mentioned regular civilians and workers\nI debunked that. Stop the spam.\n\nNo you didn't. You just made the assumption that everyone is rational enough to pick long term benifits over pointless sentimental attachment/tradition. And if people were this rational the world would probbably be a better place. But sadly a lot of people are fucking stupid can care about how something looks, over what it actually is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Initiating violence to claim territory which you use to exploit others is the standard form of statism.\n[Various rants confusing self-defense with aggressive exploitation]\nJust reread my previous replies until you understand them.\n\nI agree that is a form of statism, but the word \"self-defense\" doesn't mean shit. Its an excuse anyone can use really. Ideally if you figure out the intetions of others then you can determine what is and isn't self defense.\n\n\n&gt;Where did I say the powerful among the public overpower the weak?\nIf someone is enforcing their opinions, it's the powerful overpowering the weak.\n P e r i o d.\nDeal with that reality, or be dishonest &amp; denial. Choose one.\n\nEven in the society you beleive in people would be enforcing their opinions to overpower the weak. As you refused to reply to my point. What if one person wants to make a change in society that negaitavly effects someone else? If that person cant make the change you are taking their voice away and in tern you are a statist. If their opnion can be implamented in society, something has to happen to the person who is negativly impacted, which would eventually require violent force, which is statism. However what if there is a majoirty vote that makes the descions(maintaining socalist values of course)  along with  inclusive ideas on how both people could have a compromise? Is that violent statism?  \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;That would include you, from the perspective people you want the state to govern.\n\nInsanity isn't subjective. Pick up a psychology book foo! &gt;:/ \n\n\n&gt;thanks for ignoring my point on how Orwell was in favor of [\"rehab\" prisons]\n&gt;That's not a point. I don't believe whatever Orwell believes, and you didn't even quote him. If he did claim alleged \"rehab centers\" weren't prisons he'd be lying.\n\nHe joined the millita army in cataliona in which he most likely was involved with detaining someone in a rehab centre, for them to get better and not ruin other peoples lives along with their own. If he didnt do that, its stupid to debate  he wasn't working and befriending millita men/women who did do that. If he opposed it I'd like to see the qoute of him saying he wasnt in favor of rehab centres. \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;If they had prisons the anarchism (a peaceful society without violent hierarchy) had ended, or had not been achieved, and they were practicing statism.\n\n1:Stop using the word \"prisons.\"Prisons are a place people go who are later forever trapped in poverty. Rehab centres help the society and the offender. \n2:do your reasearch. You don't know shit about the histoical examples of anarchism therefore you shouldnt talk. \n\n\n\n&gt;Complete reading failure.\nWhat I said endorsed the same freedom for everyone.\n\nI interprated what you said as freedom only for one individual. Now that we are on this topic what exactly do define as \"freedom\"? And if you are going to say people doing whatever they want, then how do you make sure no one wants to assume power? \n\n&gt;No I want the rest of society to control the rest of society.\n&gt;Again, that's dishonest language. The truth is in a conflict the strong are violently overpowering the weak. That (statism) is what you support.\nAny group of violent people (even a tiny number) who violently govern the rest of society would be the state.\n\nWho exactly is the strong and the weak in a direct democracy? In the given decion the majoirty of voters who agree on one thing are strong and a minoirty who agree on  the opposing side are weaker, but how can there be consistent rulership? Also remind me again who is being violent? The people are discussing how they want society to be run and the minoirty that disagrees will have to submit to the rule. If they don't an inclusive democracy(lack of better words) would be implamented and a compromise would be made. The only violence that would exist would be against people who are being violent(not out of self-defense) or are robbing others. \n\n\n\n&gt;I'm explaining what a word means. History can not disprove such.\n\nNo you're explaining the possibility that people could form a state once anarchism is implamented and I'm saying that has never happened in history. \n\n\n&gt;I obviously meant the camera showed the first violence, not suddenly turned on mid fight.\n\nYeah, that doesn't anwser the context behind the fight. Bob could have attacked Joe because Joe admitted he killed Bob's friend Dave. And when a bystander watches the video they would think Joe was the innocent one defending himself.\n\n&gt;you don't know what the relationship is\n&gt;It's irrelevant.\nWhat matters (when determining who attacked) is who initiated violence first.\n\nIn that case, when the Japanese bombed Purl Harbor, it justifies America bombing Heroshima. Yeah if this point was true, then discovering who is guilty and who is innocent would be a pecie of cake and there would be no point of some form of court system to determine who is and isn't guilty. Yeah people are not that simple. Which is why intension matters way more then who made the first attack. \n\n\n\n&gt; The public's cameras, phones, security cameras, etc. Not the state's cameras.\nthink the only solution when it comes to figuring out who's guilty in an attack is figuring out the main intentions.\n\nSo anyone priveldged enough to own such equipment is going to carry that stuff around them everywhere they go in order to prove to everyone who is and isn't guilty? Let me guess, it's the victim's fault for NOT having a camera on them and as a result the attacker goes unpunished while the victim suffers? Also what if the attacker makes the first move but the camera is only turned on whenn the victim defeneds themseleves? What about lies through omission(someone purposly doing that) \n\n\n&gt;If someone punches someone else, their intentions are shown on the tape (to punch) and no quack is needed.\n\nNo, not really. Please elaborate how that's true. \n\n\n\n&gt;That wouldn't be self-defense.\n\nYes I know. See, there's  this thing called lying....\n\n&gt;He wasn't shot for self-defense\nNo one knows if TM initiated violence because there wasn't a camera. But the other guy was an asshole, which is clear.\n\nWitnessses claimed he was not harming Zimmerman. I guess you are right in the fact that there's no way of knowing, based off the information provided. The witnesses could have just been somehow swayed by someone to say TM was innocent. However, if there is evidance to suggest George Zimmerman is either a rascist or has extreme trust issues or had some sort of hatred towards TM for whatever reason (all can easily be examined by psycologists and any other mental-health proffesionals) then we would know his intensions and the bullshit \"self-defense\" line wouldnt be used.

Dock såg jag på värsta språket med Fredrik Lindström och han meddelade att det var inte bara på Lidingö (vilket jag för övrigt aldrig har bott på) utan även i Göteborg, Bohuslän, Värmland och några andra ställen man sade sjuu. Alltså, man säger sju allra längst fram i munnen om jag ska beskriva det. \n\nOm man går på [Wiki](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sj-ljudet) så uttalar jag nog mina sj-ljud längst fram i munnen,med tungspetsen nära tandvallen. Eftersom jag dock vare sig är finlandssvensk eller norrlänning så kan det uppfattas som snobbigt om man är stockholmare. Dock byter jag snabbt som blixten beroende på vilket sällskap jag är i :-). Det ska påpekas att jag t o m i gamla filmer från \"Igelkotten 3 år\" och dylikt, byter sj-ljud beroende på om jag talar med mamma eller pappa, mormor eller farmor.
