I was waiting for coming home all day because I would be able to free myself of the heavy load waiting inside of my belly. \n\nOn the way home the issue became more and more pressing.

{"body": "The fact is, there is no real proof that many antidepressants actually work.  The most popular class of these drugs are SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) (ie Prozac).  A recent [study](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/depression-caused-lack-serotonin-study-article-1.1923921) showed that serotonin may have little to do with depression levels.  So this \"side effect\" may simply be the drug *not* working.\n\nThere is also the issue of switching drugs, like going from an SSRI to an \"atypical\" type like Wellbutrin.  Nobody really seems to understand the levels of the hormones and chemicals involved, so tapering off/stopping to start a new drug can be problematic.  Bottom line is: drug companies make a L O T of money peddling antidepressants to people.\n\nEDIT: Seriously reddit?

{"body": "The Neapolitan Subdominant is just a chord.  If you're in C major, that chord would be F Ab Db, which is the first inversion of the bII chord, the chord on the b2 of the scale -- the Db.  I don't know why it's called Neapolitan.  Maybe it was popular in southern Italy at one point in history and the name stuck.  That name, however, doesn't mean anything with regards to current geography.  People from all over use and have used this chord, including Mozart, who was certainly not from Napoli.\n\nNow, I don't know what it means for a chord to be standard, but I have a guess based on /u/CrownStarr's response.  If you're in C major, the notes in C major are C D E F G A B, and the \"standard\" chords would be the triads in the scale -- C major (C E G), D minor (D F A), E minor (E G B), F major (F A C), G major (G B D) and G dominant 7 (G B D F), A minor (A C E), and B diminished (B D F, which is really just G7 without the G).  Additionally, if you're in C minor, the notes (for chords) are C D Eb F G A Bb/B C.  The \"standard\" chords are the triads in this scale -- C minor (C Eb G), D diminished (D F Ab), Eb major (Eb G Bb), F minor (F Ab C), G minor (G Bb D), G major (G B D), and G dominant 7 (G B D F), Ab major (Ab C Eb), and Bb major (Bb D F) and B diminished (B D F, which, again, is G7 without the G).  There are some other auxilliary chords that come up.  When you're in a particular key, you usually expect to hear those chords \"standard\" to the key, and anything else is somewhat surprising.  The Neapolitan chord, which is, in C, a Db major chord in first inversion, has a Db as its root, which has a special relationship to the C that is not present in any of the other chords.

{"body": "Ah, so you say, strength, dexterity and skill through training are no object, eh?  There's nothing physically impossible about following up two shots by grabbing a bolt with each of your pinkies and loading the crossbow in the opposite hand with that bolt.  Difficult as fuck to get the leverage and strength needed to load the crossbow with such an awkward grip in such a short time?  Sure!  Physically impossible to do within 6 seconds?  I can't imagine how it could possibly be so.  The task is being performed with mechanical energy and gripping forces supplied by the human body.\n\nWhat about other improbabilities?  The Sentinel Feat allows someone to hit any size creature in such a way as to stop them from traveling more than 5 feet for 6 seconds while not hindering their abilities in any other way.  Oddly specific don't you think?  Shouldn't it cause them to be stunned, or prone?  Surely they should be at least dazed or something?  Lower AC or Dex save for a turn?  Gosh, the physics of this situation are hard to reconcile.\n\nLet's look directly at the other effects of the Feat in question.\n\n&gt; C r o s s b o w E x p e r t\n\n&gt;Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:\n\n\n&gt;• You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.\n\n&gt;• Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.\n\n&gt; • When you use the Attack action and attack with a one- handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded hand crossbow you are holding.\n\n\nThis Feat allows someone like a Rogue to do the following in 6 seconds.\n\n1. Move up to their speed.\n2. Open a door.\n3. Fire a shot at no penalty.\n4. Hide\n5. Reload their Crossbow.\n\nBut wait, it gets better.  It also allows a 5th level Ranger with Horde Breaker to shoot and load the same Heavy Crossbow three times within 6 seconds.  An 11th level Ranger could shoot the same Heavy Crossbow at up to 9 targets while running their speed and taking an additional shot for good measure!  A 2nd Fighter/11th Ranger could use an Action Surge to shoot a single Heavy Crossbow ***Nineteen*** times within 6 seconds!\n\nSo where is the line?  At what point do we draw the line and say \"No, you're just not AWESOME enough to pull that off, better get a magical crutch to help you.\"\n\nThe problem with realism based rulings like these is that you set a barrier beyond which creativity does not apply.  Perhaps the imagery doesn't exactly **jive** with you, but they likely jive with somebody.  Why force the players to have such limited scope in the flavor of their characters for the sake of your own ideals?  What is lost in saying \"ok\" to a spot of creativity or flavorful fun?  As far as the game mechanics are concerned everything checks out, it all simply comes down to whether you take that gleam in your players' eye and allow it to flourish in it's fancy or snuff it out like so much real life dirt.\n\n-------\n\nI take on this role that you might have an avenue in which to maintain your human nature away from your comrades.  I understand how sacred the Gamespace is to many DM'S and am all too aware of how easily a single persons ideals can start to slowly eat away at the players' creative agency.  It's basically IMPOSSIBLE to even consider backing down when contested in your own space, so I do it here so that some of that rigidness might be softened before you return to your group.\n\nI implore you.  Explore what you have to gain from allowing creativity or \"cool\" to trump realism.  Perhaps you're very disciplined and things won't go/haven't gone very far.  Perhaps these ramblings will only serve to further strengthen your resolve as an avatar of \"No\".  I suppose I'll never really know.\n\n*\"In a world made of magic and imagination, those who are the most real are valued the least.\" - Pretentious Internet Guy*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409669098", "subreddit": "dndnext", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think I can explain Coltrane's first big innovation in jazz structure properly. Let's take a scale: C D E F G A B C. A standard jazz chord progression goes ii-V-I, which would be in this case.. D-G-C. So a song's overall structure will, in some way, reflect D-G-C, even if other stuff might fall in-between. And we mostly stay within the key of C.\n\nWhat Coltrane realized is that each chord can serve as a pivot on the key structure, and that the ii-V-I structure can be chained/looped. So in D-G-C, when we hit G, Coltrane said, \"why isn't this the new ii?\" If G is the ii, then the tonic is F, and ii-V-I on F looks like G-C-F. You can keep doing this forever until you form a full loop, because guess what a ii-V-I on G looks like? A-D-G. And that will lead you straight into D-G-C.\n\nbasically, he took a very simple idea and made it into a VERY complex one that essentially opened up the entirety of the musical scale and all possibilities within every possible song... ever.\n\nIf that's not musical enlightenment, I dunno what is. Great analogy, honestly. And it's not possible to really understand or operate in until you are very well-trained in classical music first. At the end of it all, though, you can just as easily said that Coltrane came in and declared, \"To play in key, you have to realize there is no key.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409694896", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Parking is expensive and over-crowded on campus. \n\nFinally, I can't stress this enough: **Be careful who you rent from in Stillwater.**  Because housing near campus is so in-demand, there are tons of slumlords who exploit that by jacking up rent on crappy properties, don't maintain upkeep, and will swipe your deposit citing fraudulent lease violations.

{"body": "some of the most important things in my opinion for TB are first of all skill build: E Q E W W W W E E R R and stats only exceptions would by if you know they will try to dive you under tower than you an get earlier ult but generally its better to get skills that let you farm faster or if the enemy have something like a radiance hero you might want to skill up Q later instead of stats. the thing about this build is you use W all the time to farm lane and jungle and/or push towers. Since the nerf its not as effective anymore to just run at towers no matter what and push the only times you want to push is either if you have team backing you or if you know enemy is distracted. So unless you are pushing you use your hero and 1 illu to farm jungle and 1 illu to last hit in lane which with the maxed W build and a few items isnt as hard as it seems. so item build should most times be something like boots qb into aquila a bracer or wraithband and into yasha if you get all the above items you farm the woods insanely fast and if uncontested bring down towers equally as fast. After those core items its preference but I like to go travels and sange just beacuse its cheaper than manta and it makes you faster and more survivable early on. MS is important for many things it lets you push safer since even if enemy has a blink if you see a tp you run so fast that by the time the tp in you are miles away and it lets your illusions have more range so you can farm further away camps and lanes. For play style my approach is push towers only if you can see enemies or if you have back up unless you just push with illusions and stay back with your hero but try to have your travels off cooldown and once you have 1-2 core items if you farmed fast you will probably be stronger than any enemy heros so dont hesitate to join fights. In fight though dont go too balls deep you have illusions that deal massive damage and high range there is no need to go in too close. one of the traps for TB players is they try to go in cuz they want to use ult and Q but both q and ult are super low range so its most times retarded to rely on them. One nice thing that many times works for me as tb is once i have travels and sy my ms is so high that I am just insanely mobile so I like to go for some flanks and catch out their supports in the back lines if you have 2 illusions up and u walk behind something like an SS you will 3 shot him guaranteed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409765334", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If it matches your friend's last name - they're the \"De Carlos\" - then you go into the house. In Javascript terms:\n\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; Mockingbird_Lane.length; i++) {\n        if(Mockingbird_Lane[i] === \"De Carlos\") {\n            go_in();\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n \n1. You start at 0 Mockingbird Lane (`i = 0`); \n2. you check the name on the mailbox to see if it's your friend's family (`if(Mockingbird_Lane[i] === \"De Carlos\")`);\n3. if it *is* your friend's house, you go in (`go_in()`) and stop searching (`break`, which tells the `for` loop to stop cycling); \n4. if it's not you move up to the next house (`i++`) and repeat the process; \n5. and you don't go past the end of the road (`i &lt; Mockingbird_Lane.length`).\n\nYou've found your friend's house! She lives at 22 Mockingbird Lane. Let's check the state of our program right now:\n\n    i == 22\n    Mockingbird_Lane[i] === Mockingbird_Lane[22] === \"De Carlos\"\n\nAt this moment, since `i` is equal to 22, saying `Mockingbird_Lane[i]` is the same as saying `Mockingbird_Lane[22]`, and `Mockingbird_Lane[22]` is equal to `\"De Carlos\"`. In other words, the De Carlos live at 22 Mockingbird Lane.\n\nNow that you've found your friend's house, she asks you for a favor; she's having a barbecue, but for some reason the invitations she sent to the next five houses up the street from her never got there, so she'd like you to go and ask them to come to the barbecue, and she'd like you to start with her own house just to make sure she's got a copy of the invitation. So you go out, and one by one, you ask each family to go to the barbecue. Here's our Javascript version of the scenario so far:\n\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; Mockingbird_Lane.length; i++) {\n        if(Mockingbird_Lane[i] === \"De Carlos\") {\n            go_in();\n            for (j = i; j &lt; i + 6; j++) {\n                barbecue.invite(Mockingbird_Lane[j]);\n            }\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\nIn that inner `for` loop:\n\n1. You start with your friend's house (`j = i`);\n2. for each house you visit, you invite them to the barbecue (`barbecue.invite(Mockingbird_Lane[j])`);\n3. you move up one house each time (`j++`);\n4. and you don't go more than five houses up the road (`j &lt; i + 6`). \n\n(Why not `j &lt; i + 5`, if we want to go five houses up? Because `i + 6` is the first house you *don't* want to go to, so you're keeping `j` less than that. You could also write it `j &lt;= i + 5` and it would work the same way.)\n\nStarting with the De Carlos' house, you invite each house in the next five houses to the barbecue. Two houses in, our program's state looks like this:\n\n    i === 22 // i is still 22, your friend's house\n    Mockingbird_Lane[i] === Mockingbird_Lane[22] === \"De Carlos\" // It's still your friend's house\n    j === 24 // it started at 22, and we've gone up two houses since then\n    Mockingbird_Lane[j] === Mockingbird_Lane[24] === \"Owens\" // The Owens live two doors down from the De Carlos\n\nOnce you've gone up five houses, since you kept track of which house was your friend's (with `i`), you can go back to your friend's house for the barbecue.\n\n(You should really make sure your friend invites the nice folks at 1313, too. But that's a different program.)\n\nNow that we've metaphorized, let's go back to the original code.\n\nJust to be sure we're clear on how accessing strings works, if `text = \"Hello world!\"`, then:\n\n    H e l l o   w o r l  d  !\n    | | | | | | | | | |  |  |\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n    text[1] === \"e\"\n    text[7] === \"o\"\n\netc.\n\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; text.length; i++) {\n        if (text[i] === \"E\") {\n            // If we find it, add characters up to\n            // the length of my name to the array\n            for(var j = i; j &lt; (myName.length + i); j++) {\n                hits.push(text[j]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n1. Start at position 0 with a new iterator called `i` (`i = 0`);\n2. if the letter at position `i` in the string `text` is \"E\", then move to the inner loop:\n    1. Start at position `i` with a new iterator called `j`;\n    2. add the letter at position `j` to an array called `hits` (`hits.push(text[j])`);\n    3. increase `j` by one (`j++`);\n    4. keep going as long as `j` is less than `i` plus the length of `myName` (`j &lt; (myName.length + i)`), then move back to the outer loop.\n3. if the character doesn't match, or once the inner loop is done, increase `i` by 1 (`i++`);\n4. and keep going as long as `i` is less than the length of `text`.\n\n(Notice that we don't have a `break` here. Unlike the example above, we want to keep going even if we've found a match.)\n\nDoes that make more sense?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409853765", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "1) amusement that's not deflection. I'm the only amused person here clearly the right opinion.\n\n2)It was an insult that resulted in a compliment. It was a nasty complex way of saying the exact same thing you did to the gentleman. My intent was clear eh.. yet when you detailed it you still misunderstood.\n\n3)in order for me to be a pot and him to be the kettle. His claim he formatted his paragraph incorrectly. I advised for him to double check that fact. He was insulting this attempt at grammar(kettle) I was ARROGANTLY stating he wasn't(Pot), and should double check to make sure with the added slight of the people who say so are smarter than him which ended being true literally anyway. Thusly I stated a secondary notion and since we have two separate notions theirs no pots and kettle in the world that can make sense of your idiom.\nJust to make sure you can understand this I will break it down simpler for you.\n\nKettle = improper formatting(actuality  is not)\n\nPot = It's not improperly formatted (actually isn't)\n\nPot calling the kettle black is acusing somebody of the same thing you did. He did not check his message to know he had form to his function. However I did. Now that sounds like two separate actions to me how about you.\n\nNow if I had poorly formatted my accusation and than accused him of being poorly formatted as well. Than you would have been accurate in the idiom you choose. You see it was a direct contradiction. How you used the idiom in this case simply doesn't make any actual sense no matter how much you want it to. Education is valued by the individual, but doesn't guarantee understanding, and clearly you choose short term joys of pot and booze. You might want to put out that fire in your brain smoky.\n\nHe was telling anybody to do anything, which is what you said I did do. Two separate things. In your defense they make pots and kettles in all different colors these days with them rarely being black but commonly being a polished metal finish with no coloring\n\n4)Avoiding the issue is a bit over stating my attempts at humor. Heres whats funny about this statement. I said \"Wrong... I am the specialists person ALIVE! just so we are clear :D\". Than you responded \" Yes, use sarcasm do avoid the issue, what can go wrong?\". You say this with sarcasm...roflmao...THATS LIKE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK!!!\n\n5) You say \" Again, I don't have an esteemed insight on grammar. I have knowledge on it. It's not hard to fain knowledge. You study and learn. You should try it sometime. \". Are you being hypocritical on purpose or am I missing something :/ You realize of course that insight = knowledge in advance, It's basically saying the same thing. You have insight into grammar/ You have knowledge into grammar = Same damn thing! \n\nAlso I didn't actively look you up I don't deny this I don really understand what you getting at with telling me this. Though I would add this. I didn't need to ready very far to get the perception that everything you said wad negatively reflecting on other posts intelligence and or human intelligence in general. ech a hem douche ops did I divert again. o wait you point wasn't valid after all so I couldn't be diverting guess that just leaves my making a case for you being an asshole :D \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1QCbXCezNc\n\n6) Aw man your so gullible its cute! Now if you don't take that negatively its not an insult :D The fact I feel insulted is I was aware of your own brand stupidity. You are simply looking for an excuse to lay out the biz but cant stomach it when somebody does to you what you clearly seem to think you do so well to others. Take that mister E D U C A T I O N ! ! !\n\nAlso it will get drowned out in the sea of Reponses on this thread. I honestly have to thank you I thought I was educating something all super cool like only find out I was being a fool. I CAN admit my short comings. Does not change the fact you started to insult me and have grossly been insulting through out the entirety of every post you made course you where just innocently suggesting I improve my education. \nI know we have derailed the topic. O no the forum Nazi's will soon be on our trail. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409857693", "subreddit": "h1z1", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "But why is radiation causing mutation? is what my fellow users haven't answered yet. First, we have to introduce the concept of [electromagnetic spectrum](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg). Stuff like light, heat, sound and such, are waves. Depending the length of the wave from peak to peak (look at the image of the above link), is the energy that this phenomena holds. As you can see, there are several wavelengths,*e.g.* X-ray length 0.000 000 001 meters (minuscule, ain't it?!), visible light length around 0.000 05 meters, radio waves (the ones radio stations use for transmissions) length 1 000 meters.\n\nNow, DNA is a molecule formed by some building blocks, and there is [distance between them](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/Rp_K_5IavqI/AAAAAAAAClI/9GdTDazv-oQ/s1600-h/figure+19-14.jpg) (nm stands for nanometer, which is the millionth part of a metter: 0.000001 m). In dark blue, light blue, red and orange are represented the four building blocks of the DNA: Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), Thymine (T) and Adenine (A). This blocks are called nucleotides and they're made of some minor molecules, a) [a five carbon sugar ring](http://www.eastcentral.edu/programs/deoxyribose.jpg) (black balls are the carbons, reds are oxygens and yellow are hidrogens), b) a [nitrogenous base](http://doonup.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Nitrogenous-Bases.jpg) and c) a [phosphate](http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/images/204phosphate.gif). Between all this sub-blocks there is also distance between each atom, **here is where radiation comes in**.\n\nUltra-Violet radiation has a wavelength similar to that of the distance in the bonds of the molecules in the DNA, so it can [damage it](http://www.spartanwatertreatment.com/sitebuilder/images/UV_DNA_Destruct-378x205.jpg). \n\nNow, I'll explain what a mutation is and it is very simple. DNA has a given sequence of nucleotides, it can be literally any sequence, lets bring something up, but I'll use colours instead of the nucleotides, hmmm...\n\n* Red, red, blue, red, green, yellow, green, red, green, blue, yellow, red. Or: **R R B R G Y G R G B Y R**\n\nA mutation would be any change in this given sequence. Something like this:\n\n* ***B* R B R G Y G R G B Y R**\n\nNow it is a different sequence. This is a mutation at the most simple level. But losing or adding something to the sequence can alter it, and would be a mutation as well. **Any change that happens to a DNA sequence is a mutation**.\n\nSolar radiations contains all the wavelengths shown in the first picture (link above), although the electromagnetic properties of Earth are deviating some of them at an extent (mostly the ionized waves -waves with electrical charge), some are filtering and reaching us. Some of this filtered radiation if UV radiation. As some of my fellow have explained you *cells have self-repairing DNA-damage systems*. But it isn't a perfect system, most of the mutations will keep on existing. \n\nFinally *phew*, I would like to add that not all mutations cause something in your body. The DNA is written in a code, known as [genetic code](http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/genetic-code.jpg). This code is based in groups of three nucleotides (any given combination of A C G T, like AAG), each combination can be translated inside the cell to synthesize an aminoacid that will be the building block of a protein. For example, the AAG codes for Lysine. But not all of the DNA codes for something, some regions are there to create biochemical environments that replicating, regulating, repairing molecules can detect or are there but we don't how if they do something.\n\nI hope you now understand why radiations affects DNA, what is a mutation and how DNA works.\n\n\n**TL,DR**: Some types of radiation have the energy to alter the structure of the DNA, sometimes causing it to change. Mutations are any given change in a DNA sequence. Some mutations are repaired by the own cell, some don't. Not all mutations cause changes, some are silent.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409906459", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;The difference, and it's important, is that Bavarians and Prussians spoke the same language,\n\nThere are plenty of precedents were multiethnic states functioned over a long period of time without requiring one dominant *cultural* language. In fact, before the advent and at the beginning of the nation state, many of today's regions which are now subsumed within a nation state were far less homogeneous in their language. In fact, it usually went the way that a nation state was established and only then a common language or dialect was enforced, for example (the pinnacle of centralisation) France with the Parisian culture/dialect. Contemporary examples include India and China. I do not see why English cannot take the same role in Europe and why a homogeneous cultural language is required in the first place.\n\n&gt;not to mention their common history in East Francia and later on in the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nHow exactly would this have affected the identififation of the common people with nationalistic ideas when their usual frame of reference didn't exceed low double digits km? Such 'common heritage' might have been utilised to manufacture a national identity, but this is a - to say the least - conscious efforts on those creating the national identity. It is in fact the usual way of going about things, compare the utilisation of the manufactured 'Gaullic' heritage of France during the late 18th early 19th century. In our case, this artificiality is highlighted by the fact that plenty of states who were both under Francian and HRE rule are now parts of separate national states (e.g. northern Italy and the Netherlands).\n\nIn addition, again in the case of Europe, there is plenty of shared loss and history to be used to form some kind of identity. \n\n&gt;Same thing in the US where english was imposed and where the Amerindians kept being pushed west. \n\nEnglish wasn't imposed at all. There never has been any official legislation and there is [none now](http://answers.usa.gov/system/templates/selfservice/USAGov/#!portal/1012/article/3206/Official-Language-of-the-US). English became the most commonly used language via a natural development, but only in the last century. German, for example, was in heavy use right up to the American entry into WWI.\n\n&gt;And in the end, what lead Prussia and Bavaria to become one under the same flag or the different US states to do the same were not only the common cultural ties and agressive policies of the government but also, you guessed it, war. \n\nI agree that a common enemy, or let's say competitor, usually leads to a more unified approach to things. Let me just spell it out for you what this means in terms of the EU: **R u s s i a**.\n\n&gt;However, if you think people with different languages, different customs, different philosophies, different interests etc. will all come under the same flag for a Federal Europe which, in the end, would only be giving more power to the current most powerful country in Europe (currently Germany but tomorrow it might be the UK or France for demographic reasons), you're dreaming.\n\nYou've got an interesting view on federal states. Do you see California or Texas dominating the US, seeing as they are the most powerful US states? Ontario or BC dominating Canada? Bavaria commanding all other 15 German states? A federal state can be one of the most beneficial power structures for local governments.\n\nTo see this, let's take a step back and think what a federal state means. It is nothing but a description of one part of the governmental - not the political! - structure of a state: territories with variable degrees of autonomy, local governments, and a central government with a variable degree of power. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nSo, no, I am not in fact dreaming if I think that such a structure can be used to govern Europe. I would even go so far and say that the EU already is a federal state with a, in some respects, very weak central government (the lines towards confederacy are fleeting).\n\nA federation tells you nothing about the political system (compare the American vs. the Russian one), the way power is distributed (in particular state vs. central government) and a lot of other choices.\n\nWith respect to this, a federation might be the best choice of any government for a culturally heterogeneous crowd, simply because it allows for a very flexible power structure which can be adapted to ultimately respect the wishes of the local governments.\n\n&gt;Also, I'm against this system because I find it totally undemocratic. \n\nAgain you confuse two concepts. A federation has nothing at all to say about how power is *attained*, only how power is *distributed*. It can be a strongman, as in the case of Putin. Or it can be a reasonably well functioning democracy, as in the case of Germany. \n\n&gt;All nations have a veto which is rubbish. \n\nWhere exactly in the EU does this happen? AFAIK it's not the case with Lisbon that any single nation can veto anything it wants.\n\n&gt;Small nations are over represented in a parliament which has no power anyway \n\nWhich is a symptom of the particular way power is attained in the EU's current form. That parliament has no power is simply false: it can essentially veto any new EU commission and any legislation presented to it. What the EU parliament lacks is the right to initiate legislation. However, parliament steadly grew in power, the latest being the fight to elect the Commission president (which it won).\n\n&gt;and France and Germany have one member each at the Commission which is as much as small countries with 5 times less in terms of population. \n\nWait, I thought federations were dominated by their strongest members? Cheap shots aside, this is simply how the EU has decided it wants to prevent strong countries from dominating the field. I won't argue for or against it, but I'll just say again that it is simply one way of doing things. We could as well do it differently, and the only thing preventing us is political will.\n\n&gt;But then, this was made in order to be undemocratic with just some democratic paint on top.\n\nThat's just an ideological statement. Either back it up or I'll just assume you want it to be true.\n\n&gt;Basically, not all nations are democratic, but all democracies function in a nation-state model. Take out this model, and you take away democracy. \n\nI don't see how this conclusion follows from anything you've written so far. To me this seems to be an entirely separate issue. Please elaborate on this.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1409913077", "subreddit": "europe", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Just wanted to say that if you don't see me around a lot, I've been having a really rough couple of weeks, especially the past two nights, and I have to admit that depression has finally caught up with me again. I've been holding it off as long as I could, and I'm really proud of myself for that, but there's no denying it's here again. Last night was particularly bad, but there came a point where I thought, *stop. It is okay to be sad, it is okay to be tired, it is okay if all you do tomorrow is get out of bed. You don't have to be Wonder Woman every minute of every day.\"* I don't have a fabulous resume and I don't have friends to hang out with, but that doesn't mean I have no skills and that doesn't mean that no one loves me and that doesn't mean I have no reason to wake up in the morning. There is nothing wrong with being kind to myself and taking one little step at a time, doing what I can when I feel like I can. So this morning I woke up and instead of thinking, \"you need to get up and get A B C D E F G done today or else you're a failure\", I thought, \"get up when you're ready, and you don't have to do anything you don't have the energy for.\" And I think that has made all the difference in the world, being gentle... So far I've gotten out of bed, cleaned 1/4 of the carpet that needs cleaning, knit a few rows on my sweater, had lunch, spent time helping Huggabutt with his box problem, filled/run the dishwasher, and put away a load of clean laundry.  Later I'm hoping to do more carpet, put away clean dishes, fill out a few job applications, throw some towels in the wash, glue some stitch markers together, and watch a movie with the boyfriend; but if some of it doesn't get done, that's a-okay, too.\n\nShoutout to everyone else who struggles with depression. When you're at your worst, just remember that there are people out there who have dedicated their lives to saving others, from doctors to therapists to psychiatrists to emergency response. There is nothing wrong with asking for help, and they would love nothing more than to help you when you need or want it.\n\nShoutout to /u/wmichaelis for reinforcing the thought that I have more friends than I sometimes think I do.

{"body": "&gt; Hitboxes, especially Russian ones are over preforming significantly. \n\nIdunno, felt like they were performing exactly as they should when I was getting blasted apart just a few minutes ago.\n\n&gt; Some German tanks are missing significant amounts of armor. The Panther had a 100MM matlet along with another 100mm of the turret behind it totaling to 200mm, not including slope. The same applies to the Tiger 1(which faces IS-2s because that is balanced). The Jagdtiger had an area without armor so a T-26 could kill it but that was fixed 4-5 months into the game. Are Russian tanks missing any armor? Nope.\n\nThat does need addressing. But they are...albiet a bit too slowly...doing so.\n\n&gt; Mixed battles are the epitome of poor balance. It's a just air lawn mowing ground. Combine this with Russian (historically correct) dominance in CAS and low level air, YaK-9 fighters doing better than any other single engine German bomber, Gaijin's refusal to fix the JU-87 G1's 37MM's, Gaijins stupid decision to remove air brakes from the D5, or at least not giving a variant and bombers able drop bombs onto pinpoint locations makes this game shit. Remove planes until you can actually balance the game.\n\nCombined arms are why I refuse to give RB Tanks an honest chance. I played a couple matches and it just wasn't fun. I want to play a game of armored combat, not a game of 'who can best hide from the ground attackers whizzing around farming L O D S of E M O N E on tank kills virtually unopposed?\n\n&gt; Russian domination in most tiers. Reserve tanks are relativly balanced, with HVAP ammo for Germans and Russian 45MM one shots. T-50 and the early T-34's then come in and dominate. T3(BR 3-4) with early long barreled 75MM's of the Germans and the high mobility of the Russian tanks with slightly lower firepower(SU-122/KV-2 is a dif story). That would probably be the only tier that is closed to being balanced. Every tier after that favors the Russians. PnZ 4H's and G's facing the IS-2 with it's ability to ohk at any range, impenetrable armor and decent mobility make it extremely under tiered. Panthers occasionaly face T-34/85's, which favors the Germans somewhat. But for the most part, Panthers face T-44's which out class it in every important aspect. They also face SU-100's and tanks that can use post war shells, while the second Panther needs a 0.7BR increase because it has access to APCR. That's just fucking stupid Gaijin. The only tank that can reliably kill T44's only have one spawn. T5 is just blatant Russian domination. Cold War soviet tanks against German tanks that were never implemented. The only tank that stands a chance is the Jagdtiger, which only gets one spawn.\n\nI don't see much of this. Part of it may be because I'm at ~3.7 BR in both nations(I do own a Tiger I but I don't use it as I've nothing else in its BR to bring with it, same story with my KV-1 ZiS 5), part of it may be because I play AB exclusively. But I haven't seen much Russian bias. If anything I'd say the German KwK40 L/43 shell is a bit too incindiary, as it's infuriating to burn down before you have a chance to hit the button for the extinguishers(Why do we even have these if this is the case, hrm?)\n\nI will say that Germany needs early heavies. Right now the Russians get a heavy at BR 3.7, and in doing so, pretty much can command the outcome of battles. Often the KV-1 L-11 is simply indestructible, none of hte opposing tanks can kill it, so parking one in each cap circle means match is over. Even one KV-1 in such a match can permanently sway the tide. I think if the Germans had an early heavy....let's be realistic it'd have to be a captured KV-1 that players can grind rather than buy with gold as historically the Tiger was their first...that might not be as big a deal. At the very least they should put the captured, upgunned KV-1 premium at BR 3.7 as well. My PzIV Ausf F2 has the same gun and is at that BR, my KV-1 L-11(Which is the basic vehicle pre-mods) is at BR 3.7, so I see no real issue with putting that particular premium there. And it would solve this very problem.\n\n&gt; Maps are shit. Utter steaming piles of shit. I would rather shove a 152MM shell down my urethra than play on most maps. Kursk is okay, but is very boring as the game is decided by who controls the largest hill. Also, the German AI gun emplacements were placed behind a hill so they can't engage anything, while Russian AI AT guns often snipe across the map.\n\nOnly map I truly don't like is Jungle. It doesn't matter what I do on that map I cannot squeeze a good game out of it. I like Carpathians but I do feel it could use some serious work. A cap's dip on the south side needs filling in, the north spawn should be shifted a bit closer in general, few other things. Karelia with a single cap point that isn't A can go die in a fire, otherwise I like it. Ash River is okay but there's a couple points where annoying little bastards can park and snipe with impunity.\n\n&gt; Spawn balance is trash. Every tank should get 2 spawns as Heavies already have a disadvantage compared to mediums. Allow us to pick one tank slot and one slot for air or SPAA. Why does the Jagdpanther only get one spawn when the SU-122P, which is just as good get 2? Why does the Su-152 get one spawn when it's only advantage is a low range derp gun?\n\nWe start giving heavies two spawns we're going to see the same problem we saw in the air with B-17s...at least in the early BRs. So unless you want every match you play to be nothing but KV-1 spam...\n\n&gt; It's pretty much pay or give up as you get into T4 research. There was no need to nerf RP gains. If Gaijin want money, they should make a good game.\n\nEasy to fix. Leave Premium gains right where they are, boost free gains up. Right now if I make 1,000XP in a match it says I'd have made 2,000 with premium. Close that cap by boosting free XP, such that the same performance would have made me 1,500XP.

{"body": "There's some nice stuff here. In particular the types seem about right. However your overall design comes off as a bit awkward to me. \n\n* The unwrap in `exit_to` is scary because it works on the assumption that the user has checked that they've got a valid room seperately. Really, the check and the move should be merged into a single fn that yields an Option&lt;next_room&gt;.\n\n* The Option you use to track state in `enter` also strikes me as awkward. Especially since you just unwrap it at some point in the loop under the assumption that ever invalid input will trigger a continue. I think it would be better to not `continue`, but rather to `match` on the Option and just do nothing if it's still None.\n\n* Your \"game\" loop is vaguely spread across `main` and `enter_room`. It also leans heavily on the fact that traveling between rooms is *all* you can do, even though Command's design permits future behaviours.\n\n* `enter_room` is fairly monolithic.\n\n* Your match on the Command can be collapsed into a single branch for `Go(dir)`.\n\n* You consider invalid input and impossible actions to be equivalent.\n\nHere's my redesign of the code with some key comments tossed in:\n\n    use std::io;\n\n    enum Command {\n        Go(Direction),\n    }\n\n    #[deriving(PartialEq, Show)]\n    enum Direction {\n        North,\n        East,\n        South,\n        West,\n    }\n\n    struct Exit {\n        direction: Direction,\n        target: uint, // the room number; a uint because we use it for indexing\n    }\n\n    struct Room {\n        description: String,\n        exits: Vec&lt;Exit&gt;,\n    }\n\n    impl Room {\n        /// exit_to handles a user trying to exit in a given direction,\n        /// if they can exit in that direction, then the next room is yielded.\n        /// Otherwise, None is yielded\n        fn exit_to(&amp;self, direction: Direction) -&gt; Option&lt;uint&gt; {\n            self.exits.iter()\n                      .find(|e| e.direction == direction)\n                      .map(|e| e.target)\n        }\n\n        fn is_escape(&amp;self) -&gt; bool {\n            self.exits.is_empty()\n        }\n    }\n\n    /// Handles game state and \"running\" the game\n    struct Game {\n        rooms: Vec&lt;Room&gt;,\n        cur_room: uint,\n    }\n\n    impl Game {\n        fn new(rooms: Vec&lt;Room&gt;, cur_room: uint) -&gt; Game {\n            Game {rooms: rooms, cur_room: cur_room}\n        }\n        \n        /// Get the current room of the Game\n        fn room(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Room {\n            let cur_room = self.cur_room;\n            &amp;self.rooms[cur_room]\n        }\n        \n        /// Given a valid command, act on it\n        fn handle_command(&amp;mut self, command: Command) {\n            match command {\n                // If more commands get added, this should be split into a separate fn\n                Go(dir) =&gt; match self.room().exit_to(dir) {\n                    Some(room) =&gt; { self.cur_room = room; },\n                    None =&gt; { println!(\"You cannot go {}\", dir); },\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        \n        /// Print a description of the room, and some valid actions\n        fn describe_room(&amp;mut self) {\n            let room = self.room();\n            println!(\"{}\", room.description);\n            println!(\"\\nWhat do you do?\\n\");\n        \n            for exit in room.exits.iter() {\n                match exit.direction {\n                    North =&gt; println!(\"* Go (n)orth\"),\n                    East  =&gt; println!(\"* Go (e)ast\"),\n                    South =&gt; println!(\"* Go (s)outh\"),\n                    West  =&gt; println!(\"* Go (w)est\"),\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    impl Iterator&lt;()&gt; for Game {\n        /// This is the game loop.

If you find some music you like and transcribe it, you can see how other people have solved this problem.  You'll notice that some voicings are particularly nice and some aren't.  My favorite voicing for a G13, for example, is G F B E (and for a G7b13, G F B Eb).  You could technically fill in more notes, but then the voicing becomes too thick.  You have to ask yourself what you want in the chord and what you want the relationships to be, and the answer may depend on your mood that day as much as on anything else!  If you really like the sound of the major 7th, like I do, you'll try to work that interval into your chords.  I like the G F B E voicing for G13 because of that major 7th between the F and E.  If you're feeling ugly, you could try G E D F or G E B D F or whatever you want, with the ugly minor 9th between the E and F.  Different notes will contribute differently.  How would you voice a Dm9?  I sometimes do D F C E and sometimes D A C E, which has a different feel.  Basically, chords are not as simple as their symbols.  Dm9 could be many different things.  If you're writing music or playing off of symbols, you get considerable latitude in determining which of those things Dm9 actually will be in your music.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410046471", "subreddit": "ELI5Music", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I ran up against this problem myself when I was trying to work out stress in Hudson. I have three different vowel grades, and had already reached the reasonable limit of diacritics in the process of marking them. The grades are Long [â ê î ô û], Short [a e i o u y] and Schwa [è] which is in a grade by itself. I call them grades as opposed to lengths because the Long and Short grades are not distinguished by length, but rather by pronunciation. That is, Long is /ɑ ɛ i ɔ u:/ while Short is /a e ɪ~i o u y/.   \nSo, how do I mark stress? It's somewhat difficult, considering that Long vowels often receive stress, and they already have diacritics. I played around with different orthographies to accommodate this, but I eventually settled on **making a single, hard-and-fast rule for where stress falls and then sticking to it.** The rule for stress is as follows: the first Long vowel in the word receives stress, unless there are no Long vowels. If there are no Long vowels, then the first Short vowel receives stress. Schwa is never stressed, and [è] and [y] can never be long.

Make things clear about what you both want and understand and respect each others wishes...SAFELY.\n\nHaving a baby is not the end of the world like many abortionist supporters might argue. You learn to adapt and overcome like many challenges in every human beings walk of life.\n\nBUT (big but here) lets also face the reality that you have to be willing to face that challenge or you surely will fail. I am no anti abortionist, but its no doubt abortion is a bad thing for certain reasons that often are overlooked.\n\nThe main point though: do what you have to do to be a human being. Please your natural instincts. But be aware that this is real and this isnt a joke. That girl is partly your responsibility. Dont let the female manipulate you into a false sense of security that shes on that pill. Until you see with your eyes on a daily basis and talk to her on a daily basis about it, a l w a y s use contraception prevention methods. Everyone is different and if you were to knock up this girl, it may not work out so well like the way mine did.\n\nI went off on a tangent of advice like I needed to share from my experience of what if scenarios because i feel you are in a similar situation as i used to be, but I again want to reiterate:\n\n\n\nCONTRACEPTION PREVENTION\n\nJust do it.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410134479", "subreddit": "sex", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"Rape is something that happens all the time.\"\nAnd murder, apparently, does not.\nAnd people apparently condone rape while they don't condone murder.\nExcept that everyone's reaction to rape jokes says the exact opposite. In fact, it says that they consider rape worse than death. They're actually participating in the same culture they oppose by supporting the narrative of \"damaged goods.\" Once you've been raped, you might as well have been murdered, because rape is so H O R R I B L E you cannot move on from it, you cannot joke about it, you cannot say anything on the topic other than state the obvious \"rape's bad mmkay\" which forever pollutes the minds of rape victims and forces them to remain in the emotional flux of trauma.\n\nRape is a crime. It is a crime because we do not condone it. \"Not harsh enough tbh\" comment says exactly that nobody condones rape. But a joke ABOUT rape isn't the same as rape, just like a racist joke isn't the same thing as a lynching -- these cultural Marxists should appreciate Zizek's bit about racist jokes in the Yugoslav army, where once the soldiers felt comfortable enough to share jokes about each other's ethnicities, they actually were expressing post-ethnic solidarity. It's actually terribly sexist and offensive to assume that women cannot move on from rape enough to take a joke about it from a person ignorant about their background. The world doesn't have to walk on eggshells because something awful happened to you, and no one deserves death because they're flippant about other people's tragedies -- at worst, they deserve the same flippancy when they suffer tragedy. But then, again, you're still a participant in selective empathy, which is also selective sociopathy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410194357", "subreddit": "SRSsucks", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

We have fires. We have really big holes in ground. You see those holes? We dug those holes, with shovel. And you can too if you know shovel.\n\nCome get to know shovel in new Gulag paradise in beautiful wasteland of Siberia. Come see Siberia's only tree, on our first Gulag field trip. We do one a year and we visit Siberia's tree. We even have gas lamp to warm your hand. Come dig frozen ground with shovel until you fall to hands and knees and dig until fingernails fall off, screaming for your life, cursing Stalin-\n\nAhem. You know what Gulag stand for? Grateful Underlings Living Affluently, Guy. The guy added by me because Gula doesn't work. Hi, guy, we know Gulag have bad wrap in the world. We know this. We have radio here. But listen to this T E S T I M O N I A L from Miles. He come here after parents brutally murdered by regime, and brought here to follow dreams of shovel and ice:\n\n&gt; I don't know why I'm alive anymore...\n\nThank you Miles, you really sell us. Heh, heh, heh. Now, you may wonder, what about accommodation. Well, we have much accommodation. Tents, tents, tents. You like tents? This is the capital city of tents. We have: orange tent. Yellow tent. Tent made of Tundra grass. Tent made of clothing. We even have Rasputin (no relation to Rasputin) working on building yurt out of raw material. Hey, Rasputin, how is the yurt going? \n\n&gt; Good. \n\nAh, thanks Rasputin. As you see we have much going here. We even have economy in Gulag, compared to best prison economies of entire world. In Siberia, much of resources are scarce. But most precious commodity is toilet paper. So, if you can smuggle toilet Paper across border, you are Bill Gates of toilet paper economy. Especially if you can find the bag with cats on front of bag. That is best toilet paper, it is so soft. \n\nNow let me reassure you if you still happen to have last thoughts about coming. There is more, so wait. If you morse code now, we save for you not one tent, not two tents, but three tents for your family and friend to come to Siberia. Wait! I even throw in night in Yurt once Rasputin is done with construction. All you need to bring is strength, toilet paper, and will of Mountain Lion to survive in tundra. \n\nTo find us all you need to do is turn left at tree if coming from *America*. If coming from other way, turn right at tree. Follow trail of dried blood for 473 miles. \n\n&gt; Yes comrade?\n\nNo, Miles, I meant distance. Follow trail and see sights of Siberia on way to Gulag. We even have stick with sign on it narrating best sights and place to take photos. Even try silly wood cutout of Stalin where you put face in hole of Stalin's face and take photo. \n\nSo come. You are convinced now. Come to Siberia and Gulag timeshare. Get to know shovel. You come here now. No more waiting.

{"body": "&gt; Right now I only play her top, rush Trinity Force, go tank from there. If I happen to get some kills, I may even buy another attack item. My runes are AS quints, AD reds, Armor yellow's, MR blues. Masteries 9/21. Skills : Start with Q, W, E, max R, W, E, Q. If I have the upper hand on lane, max E before W.  \n  \nTrinity Force is very good to rush on her almost every time. Alistar is a big exception there though because if you go trinity he can just harrass you down and then kill you. You cannot allin him because of his ultimate and because of his disengage. Against Alistar you need to go BOTRK.  \nDo you build anything before the Triforce? Because IMO you should always go 2 dorans blades before that for more sustain and health.  \n  \nGoing Tank after the triforce is often not enough damage. As Irelia you want to kill the enemy squishys in teamfights superfast. BORTK as 2nd item gives you chasingpotential, more burst and more dps. Tankiness doesn't really help when you allin an adc, because if the adc decides to hit you instead of running he should be dead immediatelly anyways.  \n  \nYour runes should be fine, if you have trouble lasthitting go AD-Quints as well.  \nMost people go 21/9 on Irelia because the Offense tree is just way better than the defense tree if you can make use of it.  \n  \nYour lvl1-skill should not be the same every game. Against ranged champions with a lot of poke you want to start Q so you can lasthit without getting poked too much (for example against nidalee). If you are against a passive laner you should start W for easier lasthitting and to heal any damage you might take (for example against mundo). If your enemy might allin you lvl1 you should go E to stun him and disengage or Q to jump to minions as an escape (for example against darius).  \nMaxxing R W E Q is good, don't ever max E over W, the 0.25 seconds stun is a bad trade against the sustain and true damage you get from maxxing W.\n  \n  \n&gt; Can I use Irelia as an assassin mid lane? Can I jungle with her? If so, which item should I favor?  \n  \n\nIrelia as a midlaner has a problem because she usually has to chase down her targets to kill them what is hard in the midlane because the lane is so short and you get under the enemy turret easily.  \nJungling Irelia is very risky because you have a hard time farming the jungle. Until you get some levels in W it takes you forever to clear camps so you usually have to gank a lot. And if there are no good lanes to gank you just fall off and dont get the money you need (Irelia scales very well with items, without items she is a deadweight)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410281222", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;  I do understand that the bass will always follow the root note of the chord. ( The bass being on the left hand and the chord being on the right hand, right? )\n\nNot really.  A bass line is simply a melodic line (one note after another) in the lower registers.  The notes in the bass line can be any of the notes from the chords in your chord progression, it doesn't have to strictly follow the root notes of the chords.  One reason for not using just the root notes is for smoother voice leading, i.e. smaller interval movements between notes.\n\nLet's take a common I -&gt; IV -&gt; V -&gt; I chord progression in C for:  C (C E G) -&gt; F (F A C) -&gt; G (G B D) -&gt; C (C E G) chord progression.\n\nYou could then use this for a bass line with the smoothest voice leading: C -&gt; down three semitones to A -&gt; up two semitones to B -&gt; up one semitone to C.\n\nOr, you could go: C -&gt; up 5 semitones to F -&gt; up two semitones to G -&gt; repeat G.\n\nThere's also no requirement that the notes for your bass line come from the chords being played on the right hand (or any other instrument part).  What this actually does is gets you different total chords or extensions.  For example, say you're playing a C chord on an instrument and play a B in the bass line.  The total of notes is then C E G B for a Cmaj7 chord.\n\nSome further notes:\n\n1. If you're really looking tolearn to play piano then you're going to need to get a full sized keyboard, preferably with weighted keys, and even take lessons if you're really serious about it.\n2. Beginner pieces typically will have the left hand notes following the roots of the chords being played in the right hand.  This is to make things easier to grok, not because of any musical requirement.\n\nRegardless, when writing music just play whatever sounds good together on whatever instruments and stick to the key when starting out and you really can't go wrong.  There are no rules requiring certain notes in the bass line based on what's being played elsewhere, just understand that choosing notes from outside of the other chords can change the total chord quality or even the what the chord actually is.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410286673", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

(And, having heard it now, wow—unexpected use of Suzanne Vega's \"[Tom's Diner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLP6QluMlrg)\"!)\n\nBut so you know, yes, Bm would be the v, or B major the V in the key of E minor. Em scale = E F# G A B C D E. So the diatonic chords (chords using the notes of the scale) are:\n\n    i = Em = E G B\n    ii° = F#dim = F# A C\n    III = G B D\n    iv = A C E\n    v = B D F#\n    VI = C E G\n    VII = D F# A\n\nBut there's a thing called \"Harmonic Minor\" where you also have the major 7th, so it can sound good for the minor v chord to be a major V chord, particularly at the end of a section, right before going back to the i. B major to Em.

{"body": "As I raised the fish to my mouth to take a bite from its still-flapping body, I saw the first one. Taking advantage of my shocked stillness, the fish wiggled free from my fist and plopped back into the water. \n\t\nIt didn’t look much different than we do, that figure that stood on the other side of the water hole. Bipedal, two arms and legs, two eyes. Everything was basically the same, but there was a subtle difference that made the creature before me send shivers down my spine. It stood around nominal height, but its arms and legs were slightly too long, its chest too much broader than the rest of the torso. The proportions of the thing were too off. It’s eyes were just too far apart and just too sunken back in its too-large head. It’s ridgeless, too-large-nostrilled nose rest above a mouth that stretched too long across its jaw. Looking at the creature, frozen in my crouch at the water hole, the only word that came in my mind was “too”.\n \t\nThe thing looked around itself, holding an odd, long device in its hands. It was, no doubt, a weapon. As the creature observed its surroundings, its eyes fell upon me and stopped. For a long while we just stared at each other, it’s too-round-eyed stare holding me in my spot.\n\t\nKnowing one of us had to break this terrible silence, I slowly stood to my full height and held my arms out to the side, showing this thing that I was unarmed. It seemed to understand my gesture, as it lowered the weapon it held and began to move towards me.\n \t\n“Who are you?” I asked as it approached, my voice seeming to be detached from myself.\n \t\nThe creature lifted its wrist and brought it to its mouth. It began to speak in a harsh, odd tongue into the bracelet it wore upon the hand. In response, another voice issued from the manacle in the same language. \n \t\n“I’m not afraid of you,” I said, unsure if I were trying assure the creature or myself. “Mostly curious.”\n \t\nThe creature pointed at me and said something that ended on a raised inflection. A question.\n \t\n“I do not understand,” I responded, shaking my head. “Do you understand me?” The confused look on the thing’s face told me it did not.\n \nIt pointed to itself and issued a word that sounded something like “Cape-den-purse”. \n\n“Is that your name?” I asked, pointing at it. “Cape-den-purse?”\n\nWith satisfaction, the creature nodded vehemently and then pointed at me, putting on a face of exaggerated confusion.\n\nUnderstanding what it was asking, I pointed to myself and said, “Forrest.”\n\n“Forrest?” the thing asked, making sure it had gotten what I was trying to say, and I nodded.\n\n“You come from space?” I asked, performing gestures as I asked: pointing, making a walking motion with my fingers, and finally pointing to the sky.\n\nThe creature nodded again. It pointed to the ground and then spread its hands out, as though flattening a piece of paper.\n\n“You came to….” I didn’t really understand the last part of its message, but decided it wasn’t particularly important. “Are you hungry?” I asked it, pointing towards my open mouth and then to my stomach.\n\nThen, from behind the creature, from the over the hill I saw another begin to come to the clearing. It carried a much larger weapon in its hands. When it saw me it began to shout in that harsh language of theirs and pointed its device at me. As it did so, more and more of the creatures began to come over the hill. Some came on foot and others in strange, wheeled creations.\n\nThe first creature, the one I thought of as Too, conversed with the second, who had arrived at Too’s side, for a moment and then turned to me. In its eyes was a sad look as it raised its weapon towards me.\n\nI shook my head furiously, waving my hands at the creature, begging it not to use the weapon on me, but it was to no avail. A flash and explosion came from the end of the creature’s weapon, and I felt something penetrate my neck. \n\nAs I fell to the ground in pain, the first and second creature began to move towards me. My vision was blurry and I felt extremely tired as they began to manhandle my body, picking me up and carrying me towards the rest of the arriving creatures.\n \t\n“Taak eet toe thee larb,” the second creature croaked as it and Too handed me off to another of the things, and as I began to drift into unconsciousness, I made out an emblem on Too’s clothing that bore strange markings that looked like this:\n\nU N I T E D S T A T E S O F A M E R I C A : C O L O N I Z A T I O N P R O J E C T.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410381852", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Electricity is the movement of charge. It doesn't matter which charge we track, all it matters is that some charge will move, or appear to move. It turns out that electrons are the mobile charge carriers, and they happen to carry negative charge. The concept of an electron hole is the positive analog of that, in that you can visualize it as this \"hole\" moving down the wire, rather than the electron itself.\n\nImagine if you dig a series of holes on the ground - say, 10 holes in a row. You put 9 bowling balls in them, leaving an empty hole in the middle:\n\nX X X X X O X X X X\n\nNow let's say you move an bowling ball from an adjacent hole on the left to occupy that empty hole. Right after you've done that, this is what you see:\n\nX X X X O X X X X X\n\nNotice that even though we've moved a physical bowling ball to the right, if we look at _holes_, it looks as if the hole has moved left. So if I don't care about bowling balls, and I only look at these holes, I can absolutely say that the hole is moving left - and I wouldn't be wrong. I can keep doing this:\n\nX X X O X X X X X X\n\nX X O X X X X X X X\n\nSo I can model my whole exercise as \"moving bowling balls to the right\", or \"moving holes to the left\". Both is valid if all we want to do is examine how this ball/hole-in-the-ground system changes over time.\n\nThis is how the idea with electrons and electron holes works. You can track the movement of negative charge, or the movement of positive holes.

{"body": "&gt; It's not sloppy, well, at least not in concept. Putting objects in a fixed-size grid is a totally legit way to address this and lots of games do the same.\n\nThis actually makes me feel much, much, much better.  It was just the solution I came up with, and so I assumed had to be wrong.  \n\nThe way it currently works is the ObjectHandler has a .getObjectsAtLevel(pntPos, intLevel) function that returns an array of objects.  The intLevel says which \"grid\" level to search.  So let's pretend that X is the character, S are the grids being searched, and N are grids not being searched.   \n\nIf you call .getObjectsAtLevel(0) it just searches the current zone:  \n\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N N S N N N\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N N N N N N\n\nAt level 1, it searches the surrounding grid:  \n\n\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N S S S N N\n    N N S X S N N\n    N N S S S N N\n    N N N N N N N\n    N N N N N N N\n\nLevel 2:  \n\n\n    N N N N N N N\n    N S S S S S N\n    N S N N N S N \n    N S N X N S N\n    N S N N N S N \n    N S S S S S N\n    N N N N N N N\n\nSo on and so forth.  The idea being that if you don't find what you're looking for at one level, you keep expanding your search.  But this is part of what I mean about it being exponential.  \n\nBut the other problem is, if a ton of objects congregate in a small area then you get that exponential cross-checking as well.  \n\n*Edit:  Oh, and another little niggle that's just been bugging the hell out of me that I don't have a good solution for.  If an object moves from \"Level 2\" to \"Level 1\" at the exact same time that the \"searcher\" is expanding their search from \"Level 1\" to \"Level 2\", the object will be missed entirely.  I've never actually* ***seen*** *it happen, and I know the odds have to be exceptionally rare, and even if it DID happen, the end result would just be that one in 200 workers makes one \"bad\" decision once, but it drives me bonkers knowing it's there.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410444379", "subreddit": "gamedev", "score": 25, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From Wikipedia.\n\nAccording to the chemtrail conspiracy theory, long-lasting trails left in the sky by high-flying aircraft are chemicalor biological agents deliberately sprayed for sinister purposes undisclosed to the general public.[1] Believers in the theory argue that normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly, and contrails that do not dissipate must contain additional substances.[2][3] These arguments have been dismissed by the scientific community: such trails are simply normal water-based contrails (condensation trails) which are routinely left by high-flying aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions.[4] Although proponents have attempted to prove that the claimed chemical spraying does take place, their analyses have been flawed or based on misconception.[5][6]\nBecause of the widespread popularity of the conspiracy theory, official agencies have received many inquiries from people demanding an explanation.[2] Scientists and government officials around the world have repeatedly needed to confirm that supposed chemtrails are in fact normal contrails.[7]\nThe term chemtrail is a portmanteau of the words \"chemical\" and \"trail\", just as contrail is a contraction of \"condensation trail\".[8] Believers in the conspiracy theory speculate that the purpose of the claimed chemical release may be for solar radiation management,[2] psychological manipulation, human population control, weather modification, or biological or chemical warfare, and that the trails are causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems.[1][9][10] Contrails are formed at high altitudes (5–10 miles or 8–16 kilometres) and if any chemicals were released at such altitude they would disperse harmlessly and fall many hundreds of miles away, or degrade before touching the ground.\n\n\nFirst fifteen references.\n Fraser, Stephen (2009). \"Phantom menace?

{"body": "DO NOT BUY SAO JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE ANIME!!!\n\nThis subreddit has a real hard on for SAO and constantly lies to people about the negatives of the game, you need to be told some very important points before purchasing that game.  The translation is very very bad and if you do not like broken english, mixed placement of conjunctions and confusing speech patterns you will hate SAO.  The game was translated by someone that TRIED to learn English and either did a bad job or never finished schooling, and was not double checked by a native speaker.\n\nThe games relationship system is also a horrible joke and is more of a boring job then anything else.  Lastly the game takes place outside of the anime, you will understand what im saying if you watch a trailer on SAO HF after watching the first half of the anime.  For some this is a positive and for others due to characters that have no business being in the first half of SAO its a bother.\n\nNow that the circlejerk is over and you finally know the downfalls of the game, ill list the few positives.  The combat is just like an MMO so if you like WoW combat you will probably like SAO.  It is KINDA like Y's but its a much more watered down and poor quality version imo, with only a slight improvement in more combos.  The amount of \"\"loot\" you can get from map points is nonexistant compared to Y's, but its there.\n\nThe bosses are the only positive thing about SAO to me, I find them enjoyable but O N L Y because I played either healers or tanks in WoW, and SAO boss fights are a test of aggro control.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410465572", "subreddit": "vita", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Give people a sheet with a single notation and three algorithms. Don't pressure them, just ask them to recite the algorithm from memory to you when they feel comfortable with it. Time how fast everyone memorizes the algorithms and see how the notations fare against each other. You don't even need a cube to do this project. If one does particularly well, you might even be able to make a case to change modern notation. **Be sure to have a decent sized pool of data. Don't only time five people if you want to be taken remotely seriously. Also don't time cubers as there will be an unfair advantage.**\n\nOn a side note. Don't do anything unscientific.

{"body": "This is a very interesting problem and I'll illustrate the main difficulty of analyzing the situation. If you know what the [square-cube law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law) is you'll have the right idea. The square-cube law loosely says that when you make something larger it will be relatively weaker, so you’ll need to make it wider to offset this. This leads to an important conclusion right off the bat. If we want to maintain everything as similar to the small Jaeger we’d either have to live with a larger but weaker Jaeger or one that’s as strong but end up being much thicker.\n\nFirst we need to define the problem in some way. We are given a small size Jaeger, perhaps a human-sized model that we can use to test all the equipment, software and so on. The Jaeger will have certain proportions, will be made of certain materials and will have certain engineering margins built into all the subsystems. If you want to make a bigger Jaeger that will have those three constrains, the task will be impossible due to the square-cube law. Arguably, the engineering margins are the most important aspect of the project, so we keep those the same. We're not going to cut corners here! Secondly, coming up with new materials is very difficult and we'd need a lot of time to develop them. It's not impossible but we want to build a bigger Jaeger right now. It's not enough to just reconfigure the material in some clever way because we could have already done this for the smaller version and make it stronger, leaving us in the same situation. The least important aspect is the aesthetic one - proportions. Since we can’t have it all proportions will have to go.\n\nWe have a law now - if you want to build a bigger Jaeger with the same underlying engineering, it'll have to look differently. We can be more specific. The new Jaeger will be chubbier and have even thicker legs. The idea is that the head will grow larger, and will need to be supported by a larger neck. Similarly, the longer arms will need to be relatively thicker at the top to support the expanded hand-size. All these body parts in turn will have to be supported by an even larger torso. Finally the legs will have to be even larger still.\n\nBut what is the square-cube law? The strength of an object is proportional to the cross-sectional area exposed to the weight supported by the object. The mass of an object is proportional to the volume of the object itself. We can imagine a box supported by another box of the same size. Now, we make the top one twice as large on each side. Its volume expands by a factor of 2^(3). We try to do the same with the lower box – we make it twice as tall at first. The weight it can support is proportional to the cross-sectional area and this area needs to be 2^(3) times larger. However since we only have two sides in this cross-sectional area, each side needs to grow by a factor of sqrt(2^(3)) = 2^(3/2) = 2.82... The bottom box is now a crate of sides 2.82 x 2.82 x 2. It has expanded to handle the new load. This is basically what will happen if we build a larger Jaeger to the same specifications as the old one. \nLet’s start the analysis. We have Jaeger Junior (JJ) and we want to make Jaeger Senior (JS) k times taller where just for example we’ll have k = 2 since we don’t want a Jaeger that is just a little larger. We want one that is must larger.\n* JJ’s head has dimensions h x h x h. We want to make Jaeger senior (JS) of height k times larger and blow all the body-parts up to the right dimensions. The new head will have dimensions kh x kh x kh. Its mass is k^(3) h^(3). When k = 2, each side is 2 times wider and the mass is 8 times larger.\n\n* The neck of JJ has dimensions a x a x h (some new h here). The area is a^(2) supporting mass of h^(3) (the head). Here a = h^(3/2). JS's neck wil have dimensions A x A x H. H = kh by definition of the problem. This new neck has cross-sectional area A^(2) supporting a head of mass k^(3)h^(3). Thus A = k^(3/2) h^(3/2) = k^(3/2) a. So A is not just ka as you would expect from a proportional object. It is instead k^(3/2)a. This is not much larger but the effect grows larger as we go lower towards the legs. The new neck will have mass k^(3/2) x k^(3/2) x k = k^(4) times larger than the original one. With k = 2, this leads to a neck with side 2.82 times wider (just like the boxes earlier in the post) and mass 16 times larger.\n\n* The next thing to consider is the arms. We'll go faster through some of these calculations. We start at the hands. They will be k^(3) times heavier, so the wrists and thus forearms will need to have side k^(3/2) times wider, just like the neck.. Now the upper arms need to support both the hands of mass m1 and the forearms of mass m2. In the new one we have M1 and M2. The new mass supported is k^(3)m1 + k^(4)m2. This compound expression makes the next part tough to deal with unless we make a simplifying assumption. We'll ignore M1 since the factor k^(3) is much smaller than the k^(4) factor (when k = 2 at least). Thus the upper arms need to support a mass k^(4) times larger than originally. Thus each side of the arm needs to be sqrt(k^(4)) = k^(2) times wider. This means that the upper arm will be k^(2) x k^(2) x k =k^(5) times heavier. With k = 2, this means that the upper arms will be 4 times as wide as originally and will weigh 32 times more.\n\n* Next is the torso. We could continue the above analysis but things wouldn’t be so realistic. Instead, we consider that the torso is usually the heaviest body part and the arms, head and neck won’t make a huge difference. We can assume that the torso is similar to the upper arms in that it supports a mass k^(4) larger than before, making it proportionally similar to the upper arms – k^(2) times wider and k^(5) times heavier.\n\n* The legs get a bit ridiculous. They have to support a mass k^(5) times larger than before, so they have to be sqrt(k^(5)) = k^(5/2) times wider and will weigh k^(6) times more than in the small Jaeger.\n\nThe simplifying assumption was to ignore the chain of body parts and just look at the immediate body-part that need to be supported. We've essentially UNDERESTIMATED the true size of things. Since the torso will most likely be the heaviest body part, followed by the upper legs, we can probably get away with estimating that the new Jaeger will be k^(5) to k^(6) times heavier than the original one if all the engineering margins need to be maintained. The thing I omitted is that even if we made Jaeger Senior in this manner there are some hidden considerations that we didn't look at that make things even more difficult. The new Jaeger will have to walk, run, jump, fly, rotate, etc. Those dynamical tasks lead to new constrains. For example rotation gets more difficult by a power like k^(2) for an enlargement of size k on each side (due to how moments of inertia work). The Jaeger will have a tough time turning around as fast. Enemies would have to run around k times longer to get behind the new Jaeger, so that's a big plus. Because of this our Jaeger will be about k times slower to turn around to intercept enemies relatively speaking.\nDynamically speaking, the new Jaeger will have the right parameters and margins while standing, the proportions will be horribly off, and still it won't be able to run, jump and turn as well, so it won't be as good of a fighting machine.\n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/LTsw679.png) is a sample schematic illustrating what happens if k = 2 using the above analysis.\n\n**TL;DR: The Square-Cube law dictates that things will get out of hand quickly if we want to make a much larger Jaeger.

Their matches were gone. They were lost in the dark.\nBill was scared . . . plenty scared. The conversation he'd had with his father in his father's shop kept coming back to him. There's nine pounds of blueprints that just disappeared somewhere along the line . . . My point is that nobody knows where all the damned sewers and drains go, or why. When they work, nobody cares. When they don't, there's three or four sad sacks from Derry Water who have to try and find out which pump went flooey or where the plug-up is . . . It's dark and smelly and there are rats. Those are al l good reasons to stay out, but the best reason is that you could get lost. It's happened before.\nHappened before. Happened before. It's happened — \nSure it had. There was that bundle of bones and polished cotton they had passed on the way to Its lair, for instance.\nBill felt panic trying to rise and pushed it back. It went, but not easily. He could feel it back there, a live thing, struggling and twisting, trying to get out. Adding to it was the nagging unanswerable question of whether they had killed It or not. Richie said yes, Mike said yes, so did Eddie. But he hadn't liked the frightened doubtful look on Bev's face, or on Stan's, as the light died and they crawled back through the small door, away from the susurating collapsing web.\n'So what do we do now?' Stan asked. Bill heard the frightened, little –boy tremble in Stan's voice and knew the question was aimed directly at him.\n'Yeah,' Ben said. 'What? Damn, I wish we had a flashlight . . . or even a can . . . candle.' Bill thought he heard a stifled sob in the second ellipsis. It frightened him more than anything else. Ben would have been astounded to know it, but Bill thought the fat boy tough and resourceful, steadier than Richie and less apt to cave in suddenly than Stan. If Ben was getting ready to crack, they were on the edge of very bad trouble. It was not the skeleton of the Water Department guy to which Bill's own mind kept returning but to Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher, lost in McDougal's Cave. He would push the thought away and then it would come stealing back.\nSomething else was troubling him, but the concept was too large and too vague for his tired boy's mind to grasp. Perhaps it was the very simplicity of the idea that made it elusive: they were falling away from each other. The bond that had held them all this long summer was dissolving. It had been faced and vanquished. It might be dead, as Richie and Eddie thought, or It might be wounded so badly It would sleep for a hundred years, or a thousand, or ten thousand. They had faced It, seen It with Its final mask laid aside, and It had been horrible enough — oh, for sure! — but once seen, Its physical form was not so bad and Its most potent weapon was taken away from It. They all had, after all, seen spiders before. They were alien and somehow crawlingly dreadful, and he supposed that none of them would ever be able to see another one\n(if we ever get out of this) \nwithout feeling a shudder of revulsion. But a spider was, after all, only a spider. Perhaps at the end, when the masks of horror were laid aside, there was nothing with which the human mind could not cope. That was a heartening thought. Anything except\n(the deadlights) \nwhatever had been out there, but perhaps even that unspeakable living light which crouched at the doorway to the macroverse was dead or dying. The deadlights, and the trip into the black to the place where they had been, was already growing hazy and hard to recall in his mind. And that wasn't really the point. The point, felt but not grasped, was simply that the fellowship was ending . . . it was ending and they were still in the dark. That Other had through their friendship, perhaps been able to make them something more than children. But they were becoming children again. Bill felt it as much as the others.\n'What now, Bill?' Richie asked, finally saying it right out.\n'I d-d-don't nuh-nuh –know,' Bill said. His stutter was back, alive and well. He heard it, they heard it, and he stood in the dark, smelling the sodden aroma of their growing panic, wondering how long it would be before somebody — Stan, most likely it would be Stan — tore things wide open by saying: Well, why don't you know? You got us into this!\n'And what about Henry?' Mike asked uneasily. 'Is he still out there, or what?'\n'Oh, Jeez,' Eddie said . . . almost moaned. 'I forgot about him. Sure he is, sure he is, he's probably as lost as we are and we could run into him any time . . . Jeez, Bill, don't you have any ideas? Your dad works down here! Don't you have any ideas at all?'\nBill listened to the distant mocking thunder of the water and tried to have the idea that Eddie — a l l o f t h e m — had a right to demand. Because yes, correct, he had gotten them into this and it was his responsibility to get them back out again. Nothing came. Nothing.\n'I have an idea,' Beverly said quietly.\nIn the dark, Bill heard a sound he could not immediately place. A whispery little sound, but not scary. Then there was a more easily placed sound . . . a zipper. What — ? he thought, and then he realized what. She was undressing. For some reason, Beverly was undressing.\n'What are you doing? Richie asked, and his shocked voice cracked on the last word.\n'I know something,' Beverly said in the dark, and to Bill her voice sounded older. 'I know because my father told me. I know how to bring us back together. And if we're not together we'll never get out.'\n'What?' Ben asked, sounding bewildered and terrified. 'What are you talking about?'\n'Something that will bring us together forever. Something that will show — '\n'Nuh-Nuh-No, B-B-Beverly!' Bill said, suddenly understanding, understanding everything.\n' — that will show that I love you all,' Beverly said, 'that you're all my friends.'\n'What's she t — ' Mike began.\nCalmly, Beverly cut across his words. 'Who's first?' she asked. 'I think\n\n***8 \nIn the Lair of It / 1985*** \n\nhe's dying,' Beverly wept. 'His arm, It ate his arm — She reached for Bill, clung to him, and Bill shook her off.\n'It's getting away again!' he roared at her. Blood caked his lips and chin. 'Cuh-Cuh-Come on! Richie! B-B-Ben! This tuh-time we're g-g-going to fuh-hinish her!'\nRichie turned Bill toward him, looked at him as you would look at a man who is hopelessly raving. 'Bill, we have to take care of Eddie. We have to get a tourniquet on him, get him out of here.'\nBut Beverly was now sitting with Eddie's head in her lap, cradling him. She had closed his eyes. 'Go with Bill,' she said. 'If you let him die for nothing . if It comes back in another twenty-five years, or fifty, or even two thousand, I swear I'll . . . I'll haunt your ghosts. Go!'\nRichie looked at her for a moment, indecisive. Then he became aware that her face was losing definition, becoming not a face but a pale shape in the growing shadows. The light was fading. It decided him. 'All right,' he said to Bill. 'This time we chase.'\nBen was standing in back of the spiderweb, which had begun to decay again. He had also seen the shape swaying high up in it, and he prayed that Bill would not look up.\nBut as the web began to fall in drifts and strands and skeins, Bill did.\nHe saw Audra, sagging as if in a very old and creaky elevator. She dropped ten feet, stopped, swaying from side to side, and then abruptly dropped another fifteen. Her face never changed. Her eyes, china-blue, were wide open. Her bare feet swung back and forth like pendulums. Her hair hung lankly over her shoulders. Her mouth was ajar.\n'AUDRA!' he screamed.\n'Bill, come on!' Ben shouted.\nThe web was falling all around them now, thudding to the floor and beginning to run. Richie suddenly grabbed Bill around the waist, and propelled him forward, shooting for a ten-foot-high gap between the floor and the bottommost cross-strand of the sagging web. 'Go, Bill! Go! Go!'\n'That's Audra!' Bill shouted desperately. 'Thuh-That's AUDRA!'\n'I don't give a shit if it's the Pope,' Richie said grimly. 'Eddie's dead and we're going to kill It, if It's still alive. We're going to finish the job this time, Big Bill. Either she's alive or she's not. Now come on!'\nBill hung back a moment longer, and then snapshots of the children, all the dead children, seemed to flutter through his mind like lost photographs from George's album. SCHOOL FRIENDS.\n'A-A11 ruh-right. Let's g-go. Guh –Guh-God forgive m-me.'\nHe and Richie ran under the strand of cross-webbing seconds before it collapsed, and joined Ben on the other side. They ran after It as Audra swung and dangled fifty feet above the stone floor, wrapped in a numbing cocoon that was attached to the decaying web.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410513681", "subreddit": "UnderTheDome", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "***9 \nBen*** \n\nThey followed the trail of Its black blood — oily pools of ichor that ran and dripped into the cracks between the flagstones. But as the floor began to rise toward a semicircular black opening at the far side of the chamber, Ben saw something new: a trail of eggs. Each was black and rough-shelled, perhaps as big as an ostrich– e g g . A w a x y l i g h t s h o n e f r o m w i t h i n them. Ben realized they were semi-transparent; he could see bla ck shapes moving inside.\nIts children, he thought, and felt his gorge rise. Its miscarried children. God! God!\nRichie and Bill had stopped and were staring at the eggs with stupid, dazed wonder.\n'Go on! Go on!' Ben shouted. 'I'll take care of them! Get It!'\n'Here!' Richie shouted, and threw Ben a pack of Derry Town House matches.\nBen caught them. Bill and Richie ran on. Ben watched them in the rapidly dimming light for a moment. They ran into the darkness of Its escape-passage and were lost from sight. Then he looked down at the first of the thin-shelled eggs, at the black, mantalike shadow inside, and felt his determination waver. This . . . hey guys, this was too much. This was simply too awful. And surely they would die without his help; they had not been so much laid as dropped.\nBut It's time was close . . . and if one of them is capable of surviving . . . even one . . . \nSummoning all of his courage, summoning up Eddie's pale, dying face, Ben brought one Desert Driver boot down on the first egg. It broke with a sodden squelch as some stinking placenta ran out around his boot. Then a spider the size of a rat was scrabbling weakly across the floor, trying to get away, and Ben could hear it in his head, its high mewling cries like the sound of a handsaw being bent rapidly back and forth so that it makes ghost-music.\nBen lurched after it on legs that felt like stilts and brought his foot down again. He felt the spider's body crunch and splatter under the heel of his boot. His gorge clenched and this time there was no way he could hold back. He vomited, then twisted his heel, grinding the thing into the stones, listening to the cries in his head fade to nothing.\nHow many? How many eggs? Didn't I read somewhere that spiders can lay thousands . . . or millions? I can't keep doing this, I'll go mad —\nYou have to. You have to. Come on, Ben . . . get it together! \nHe went to the next egg and repeated the process in the last of the dying lieht Everything was repeated: the brittle snap, the squelch of liquid, the final coup de grâce. The next. The next. The next. Making his way slowly toward the black arch into which his friends had gone. The darkness was complete now Beverly and the decaying web somewhere behind him. He could still hear the whisper of its collapse. The eggs were pallid stones in the dark. As he reached each one he struck a light from the matchbook and broke it open. In each case he was able to follow the course of the dazed spiderling and crush it before the light flickered out. He had no idea how he was going to proceed if his matches gave out before he had crushed the last of the eggs and killed each one's unspeakable cargo.\n\n**10 \nIt / 1985** \n\nStill coming. \nIt sensed them still coming, gaining, and Its fear grew. Perhaps It was not eternal after all — the unthinkable must finally be thought. Worse, It sensed the death of Its young. A third of these hated hateful men — boys was walking steadily up Its trail of birth, almost insane with revulsion but continuing nonetheless, methodically stamping the life from each of Its eggs. \nNo! It wailed, lurching from side to side, feeling Its life-force running from a hundred wounds, none of them mortal in itself, but each a song of pain, each slowing It. One of Its legs hung by a single living twist of meat. One of Its eyes was blind. It sensed a terrible rupture inside, the result of whatever poison one of the hated men-boys had managed to shoot down Its throat.\nAnd still they came on, closing the distance, and how could this happen? It whined and mewled, and when It sensed them almost directly behind, It did the only thing It could do now: It turned to fight. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410513809", "subreddit": "UnderTheDome", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "As a professional guitarist (and guitar teacher.) I would like make a couple suggestions on the subject of tackling theory for guitarists.  \n\nUnderstanding chord progressions and how they interact with each other is a great stating point to theory for guitarists.  The relationships of these chords lay out nicely on guitar and are great indicators of what scales relate to them.  Unlike Piano or other more traditional instruments, guitar players have discovered traits and ways of seeing music on the fretboard that is unique to the instrument.  If you've been playing 5 years, you might as well use the tools you've been building to understand the next layer of your musicianship.  \n\nTheory is a way of understanding and communicating what we think sounds good.  Building your sonic vocabulary and assigning that vocabulary names is what it's all about.  Here are a couple exercises that I think help tremendously:\n\nPick a scale.  How about the Major scale (Ionian mode).  Play it in G in 2nd position. (G being on your low string)  (G A B C D E F#).  Next, go up a 4th from there. (After all, most songs move in 4ths.  Handy on several levels).  C.  Play C Major (Ionian) (with C being on your low string to maintain the same physical pattern on the fretboard) Move up a 4th.. F.  Play Ionian.  Etc...  Eventually you will hit them all.  (Try to maintain the same pattern, as this will allow you to visualize the note relationships as well as hear them). This process can be as passive (just play the shapes and repeat) or active (identify every note and interval as you go along) as you feel comfortable with.  It's a great exercise at any level and builds practical playing tools while understanding the relationships between the notes.   If that's easy, pick the next mode (Dorian, Phrygian, etc...) and do the same thing.  \n\nThrough this, you will learn the cycle of 4ths, the Ionian mode in every key, and will improve your technical chops at the same time.  \n\nAnother exercise (depending on where you are in your studies) is to start analyzing chord progressions.  Start by identifying root notes of chords and identify the interval in relation to the key.  If the song goes G C Eb D7, you you'll go I IV bVI V7.  (There are different ways of notating depending on your informations sources, but you get the idea). Some progressions are super simple, and some songs are easy to play, but that doesn't always mean the analysis is simple.  Start with picking apart what you know and naming all the things you already do.  Oh yeah, PLAY the chord progressions as you're doing this.  Music is about sound and you want to HEAR these relationships as well. \n\n\nThose are just a couple places I would start.  This is theory with the practical guitar player in mind.   Notice it's all about understanding the relationships between notes and chords and PLAYING them as you do it.  If it's in concept only, it will limit your ability to apply what you are learning.  \n\nI hope that's helpful.  Feel free to contact me if you need more!  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410538210", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "INB4 I didn't proof read so theres probably lots of typos\nI feel like I have valuable information to this subject. Last summer I picked up my first MOBA ever, league of legends. After the entire summer of, playing about two to three games a night I felt as though I was proficient at the entire game. I.E. I could play all lanes with two or three characters, understood builds and the importance of objectives. Where as this summer I mainly played only street fighter (my first fighting game outside of playing when i was very young) And now after spending just about the same amount of time playing street fighter this summer, I feel like I can only really play a single character effectively. So i guess you could say I was a MOBA player who went to a fighting game, and I must say, learning the fighting game is much, much, much, much more difficult. I found the fighting games to more difficult to learn due to the fact that i had to learn stick motions and timing for the move to come out and hit my opponet. So I've had to learn to bait people into different situations so I can then execute the correct motion and then do the move. In contrast, while learning a MOBA, I only needed to learn how to bait the opponent and then hit them (be it a skill shot or an auto target spell). While both took skill and strategy, the fact that I needed to time out my stick motions and range and bait perfectly to hit the opponet made doing special moves more difficult than casting spells. Then on the side of, what do I do after my spell/special move hits? In league of legends (IN GENERAL, NOT SPEAKING IN TERMS OF TOP TIER PLAY JUST MEDICORE/ADVANCED) you can simply cast Q W E R (or whatever combo clearly works the best) all in succession and you'll at least do a decent amount of damage and maybe kill your opponent in lane. Then you either advance in lane towards the other tower or retreat towards your own (or possibly bait into a gank) Where as in Fighting games, if you throw out your special move, you have to then watch to see if it is blocked or hits, or is stuffed/ over prioritized by their move. then you must react accordingly to the situation with either trying to link into a combo or defending or gaining position. You cant simply rattle of all of your spells and be done. \nTo me, these things make it more difficult to lear fighting games in contrast to mobas. Sure there are more aspects to argue like the difficulties of team fights, dealing with synergy of your team mates in lane, build orders, when to push when to retreatetc etc but these are all common sense things. Example (oh shit someone on our team died and its now 4v5 probably shouldn't team fight)where as in fighting games there are far more opportunities for mind games and in depth capabilities of each fighter (combos, styles, ults)  I believe those seemingly simple  aspects make fighting games much more difficult to grasp learn master and execute.\n\nTL;DR/Final thought Played league last summer, played USF4 this summer. Learned whole game of league in one summer, learned one character of usf4 in one summer. Casting spells is easier than timing out special moves; Knowing what to do with your character is easier in MOBAS than in fighting games. I think that fighting game players would learn MOBAS faster than the other way around aka MOBAS easy to learn Fighting games difficult to learn so the fighting game players would not loose as badly to the moba players as the moba players would loose at the fighting games\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410601747", "subreddit": "Kappa", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Entiendo tu perspectiva, pero parece que obvias un concepto importante: en Podemos tienen prioridad (o deberían) las personas que menos medios tienen, ya que es de justicia social. Por desgracia no todos los ciudadanos nacemos iguales: hay personas que simplemente por nacer en un lugar determinado han podido disfrutar de una posición económica desahogada, y ello les ha permitido tener más medios (dinero, contactos) para poder pagar mejores estudios, academias, hablar más idiomas, montar negocios, optar a puestos de trabajo, etc. Por el contrario hay muchísimas personas que ni siquiera han podido optar a ello, y si han podido, por ejemplo, tener algo de formación (a veces ni siquiera comparable a la que la gente con buenos ingresos puede comprar) ha sido gracias a mucho esfuerzo y sacrificio. Ello se traduce en que (por lo general) las personas con más medios no tienen problemas para colocarse y disfrutar de una buena vida, algo casi imposible para las personas con menos medios.\n\nResulta lógico entonces que los compromisos adquiridos por los portavoces deban ajustarse a esta realidad, y beneficiar a los que menos medios tienen sobre los que tienen más. En este sentido por tanto parece justo limitar los salarios, con el fin precisamente de que los motivos que impulsan a alguien a presentarse como representante no sean el dinero o el reconocimiento social, sino la voluntad de servicio al pueblo. Es un inconveniente que a alguien que gana bastante más de 2000 euros al mes este hecho no le compense económicamente o laboralmente, pero como han dicho existen muchas formas de participar y colaborar en las asambleas, algunas incluso más imprescindibles que el hecho de representarlas. \n\nTambién me gustaría recordar que esa misma justificación (se \"pierde dinero\" al meterse en política) fue la dieron los del PP para justificar el pago en negro de sobresueldos. Y que la conexión empresario - alcalde ha dado lugar a un sinfín de tramas de corrupción urbanística.\n\nPor tanto pienso que es razonable que se planteen estas medidas para prevenir lo anterior, asumiendo que dichas restricciones responden a razones de justicia social y prevención de la corrupción. Esto no es una empresa privada donde dices \"¿Me pagas menos de lo que cobro ahora? Pues lo siento, no me compensa\" (lo cual denota un interés prioritario sobre la voluntad de servicio al pueblo, que es el dinero). En este caso sería algo más bien como: \"Tengo que renunciar a X e Y por aportar mi trabajo y mi tiempo a esta iniciativa, pero lo hago porque creo en esto. Y si tengo que dedicarme a tiempo completo a ello, pues obviamente necesito un sueldo para vivir. Si mi vocación es superior a las restricciones adelante (aunque pierda dinero o no gane tanto como podría), si no buscaré otra forma de ayudar\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410609226", "subreddit": "podemos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sure.\n\nYour analogy is, I think a really helpful one. If you see notes (letters) as the building blocks of alphabets (scales) and words (chords) as representing a meaningful (harmonious) selection from an alphabet (scale), that helps me to explain an a non vague and evasive way what I mean.\n\nI think people learn often heuristically - that is, on the fly, in quite a haphazard 'whatever happens to come first' kind of way. In my experience, a lot of guitarists (not all, but most) tend to approach their learning from simple songs based on open chords. Often, they begin to become curious in regards to more chords, (see OPs bonus question), and often scales come next as they become more competent and their working conceptual model grows more sophisticated.\n\nInfant children, or language-novices tend to learn words, and then sequences of words, to get what they want and need, long before they worry about alphabets or dictionaries. This is why I thought it would be most helpful to emphasise CAGED's application in regards to five simple chord shapes and how they fit together and can be moved around.\n\nYou construe CAGED as a 'scale learning system'. So from your perspective, if I'm understanding you, the system is misapplied in a somewhat backwards manner if it is used to *then* learn chords. Fair enough.\n\nI see it as a set of inter-related concepts and rules-of-thumb which have great explanatory power, and the flexibility to be used as a means to a great many ends. It *can* be used as a conceptual key towards a certain goal, and indeed scales are often the final part of the puzzle.\nYou still, as you suggest, need to essentially learn by rote how to actually play C A G E and D. But it does provide a 'key' - a helpful mnemonic  that says there are a total of five shapes, the order in which they fit together, and a conceptual skeleton which is robust enough to then encompass more advanced ideas.\n\nIf that doesn't clarify, or is too rambling, I have to sign off at this point as this is as good an explanation as I can give.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410626557", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Since there are so many different things you can do, even with three balls, there is no single progression from one trick to the next up a ladder, but rather a whole variety of different things that you can work on, and as you are able to do them, each one will open up new possibilities, and various combinations of them will also open up new possibilities.\n\nThat said, there are a few good places to start. Fundamentally, there are two major axes of variation in patterns; the *types* of throws and catches, and the *pattern* of throws and catches. Each one of these can be broken down into a few different subtypes of variation; for instance, for any throw, you can vary the throw, vary the catch, vary the hold, vary the path that you throw the object. There are also some types that take place entirely in the plane in front of you, some that involve moving around your body, and so on.\n\nFor the *pattern* of throws and catches, there are also two main subtypes. One is the pattern of the throw/catch variations that you use; you could do every throw and catch with the same variation, but you can also do the variation with just one side, or with just one ball, or in more complicated patterns. The other is the pattern of which hand is throwing and catching which ball at which time. This type of variation has its own notation, know as *siteswap*, and patterns that are primarily based on varying this are frequently known as siteswaps.\n\nOK, that all got very abstract very quick, let's get back to what you should work on next. Generally, the very first variation that you learn after the basic three ball cascade is the outer, or over the top throw. To learn it, think about how you normally juggle the cascade. Each time a ball is coming down to one of your hands, you generally move that hand towards the middle of your body, and throw the next ball underneath the first, up to the same height. In order to do this throw, you just reverse that. Instead of scooping inwards, and throwing under the incoming ball, you scoop outwards, and throw over it.\n\nNow, to learn this throw you can use several different patterns. Just like with learning the normal cascade, you can start with just one ball. If you throw just one ball in a cascade pattern, it makes a figure 8 (or ∞ is a better description). When juggling one ball with an outside or over-the-top throw, you still juggle an ∞, but you are catching on the inside, and throwing on the outside.\n\nWith one ball it's pretty boring, and pretty hard to get a feel for it, so you can move up to two balls. Now you'll see better why it's sometimes called \"over the top\". You throw one ball to the other hand, and then instead of scooping inwards, you scoop outwards and throw over the top of the incoming ball. Practice that a few times.\n\nNow move up to three. Here's where you start to be able to do different patterns. At first, you'll just start by throwing a single over the top throw in the middle of the pattern, then go back to juggling a normal three ball cascade. Once you can do that reasonably consistently, you can get into some more interesting patterns. The first is to throw every third throw as an outside throw. That means it will be the same ball thrown over the top every time. It can help to have two balls of one color, and one of another, to more easily see what you're doing. This trick is commonly called \"tennis\", as that one ball that is constantly being thrown over the top is reminiscent of a tennis ball continually being hit over the net.\n\nNext up is to do the outside throw as every other throw. This means that it will be the same hand doing the throw every time. In order to keep both of your hands at a consistent level, it's best to remember to alternate which side you practice with. When you throw an over the top with the same hand every time, you'll notice that your pattern no longer crosses; one hand is always throwing over the top, the other always underneath, moving around in a shape like the outline of a bean. This pattern is known as the \"half shower\", as it looks similar to a shower, and has the same property that the balls loop around without crossing, but is lower and slower.\n\nThe next thing to try is doing every throw as an outside throw. This is known as a \"reverse cascade\", as the balls follow the same ∞ pattern as in the regular cascade, but go around it in the other direction, as if you took a video of a regular cascade and played it backwards.\n\nWhew! That was a good number of patterns to get out of just one varied throw. Now let's talk about one of the other types of variation; the variation of which hand throws which ball at which time, or siteswap.\n\nWhen you throw the normal three ball cascade, each time you throw a ball, it will cross over to the other hand, and be thrown again three beats later. Let's call the balls A, B, and C, the hands R and L, and we'll number the beats. On beat 1, you throw ball A with your right hand, R. Beat 2, throw ball B with your left hand L. Beat 3, C with R. Beat 4, A with L. I'll line them up below to make it more clear.\n\n    Beat  1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    Hand  R L R L R L R\n    Ball  A B C A B C A\n\nBut what happens if instead of just throwing across to your other hand, you throw back to the hand that's throwing? Well, then you don't need to throw with the other hand, as there's nothing coming in, on the next beat. But you will need to throw again with the same hand two beats later, to make room for that hand to throw the first ball again four beats later.\n\n    Beat  1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    Hand  R L R L R L R\n    Ball  A b C b A b C\n\nI've put \"b\" in lowercase here to indicate that you don't throw it, you're just holding on to it.\n\nNow, that diagram is a lot to write out, and contains a lot of redundant information; the beat and hand columns never change, and we don't really care much which ball is which, just how we need to throw them. So let's add and extra line that describes, on each beat, when that ball will next be thrown.\n\nCascade:\n\n    Beat  1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    Hand  R L R L R L R\n    Ball  A B C A B C A\n    Throw 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nTwo in one hand:\n\n    Beat  1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    Hand  R L R L R L R\n    Ball  A b C b A b C\n    Throw 4 2 4 2 4 2 4\n\nSince there's nothing else that needs to happen in the left hand here, you can just hold on to the \"2\", you don't need to throw it. This comes in handy in a lot of later tricks, when you can use that time to move it around in interesting ways.\n\nSince this repeats, you can just abbreviate it as the shortest repeating sequence. The cascade can be abbreviated as \"3\", two in one hand as \"42\".\n\nNow, the interesting part comes when you combine them. Once you've learned how to do two in one hand, and two in the other, you can alternate between that and throwing a crossing throw: 423.\n\n    Beat  1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    Hand  R L R L R L R\n    Ball  A b C B a C A\n    Throw 4 2 3 4 2 3 4\n\nThis one is more interesting. You now have one ball that's crossing back and forth between your hands (ball C, which is always thrown with a 3 throw), and the other two balls staying on the same side, A and B, alternating between being held and being thrown with a 4 back to the same hand.\n\nSo, these are what I'd recommend working on next. Over the top throws, and the different patterns of them you can do. And then work on your first siteswaps, 42 (two in one hand, just hold the ball in the other), and 423 (alternate between that and a crossing throw).\n\n(split in two due to comment length limit)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410633071", "subreddit": "juggling", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

I would say this graphic shows a very accurate representation of cup volumes on a 28-30 inch rib cage (this is a small petite rib cage size with little fat) up to about an F cup. I mention the rib size because cup size without rib measurement is meaningless. Then it gets a bit wonky. Mostly cause cups in that range are measured differently by country and manufacturer. Assuming that the chart maker is referring to EU sizing (AA B C D DD E F G H I J K), I would say that the girls from G to I are larger than their corresponding cup sizes. The would more likely be H, JJ and K respectively. With the K cup girl being closer to a L, all in UK sizing (AA B C D DD E F FF G GG H HH J JJ K KK L LL).

{"body": "''We use our time wisely, getting our work done so that we can become something, because we are not enough; we must be victorious and stand apart from the rest. Time is money; linear time is valuable, it can bring us success in the future. In circular time there is no future to bring success, nothing stands apart but stands together as a whole, and time is a tree that makes leaves instead of money. Our pride and bravery is now recognized as cowardliness, fear of relation, and we stand there looking stupid in our uniforms, holding our weapons up against an opponent that isn't there. Our opponent morphs into a friend that has been supporting us and keeping us alive the whole time. ''\n\nHe puts it beautifully. There is no enemy, there is no linear time to bring us success, to make us a 'spiritual being' or 'enlightened' or whatever Word (that's all they are, words/images/symbols) you prefer. \n\nYou're chasing 'Nirvana' as one chases a new car or a new house, as one chases the horizon, yet stating that it's something completely different, something beyond 'time'. \n\nSo instead of it being a physical career, jobs, promotions, etc., it's now a spiritual career? Do this and that, get your promotion, and next time you'll have it better, always this 'next time', never now, today, or even this life, just this 'next', we're always 'almost there'. Or better, it's just like a school, study this, do your homework, memorize this for the test, pass the test, forget all you memorized, and you'll get out of this hell hole soon enough. \n\nYour enemy, your 'animal mind', has indeed been keeping you alive this whole time, and it isn't dumb as you make it out to be. You now (I assume) are not threatened, so are you punching the air or kicking the walls? Of course not, that would be stupid, as there is no threat. Do you need to repeat to yourself that there is no threat? Of course not, why would you?\n\nThe very simple reason why people are angry and do all the things that they do is because they're never good enough; religions have been bombarding us with 'original sins', 'beasts', 'demons', and all these things we must take care of, otherwise we're not good enough, we're always in this race of trying to be better, of trying to be good, and so we get frustrated, we can never enjoy anything, how could we, we're so filthy. \n\nWe can't rid ourselves from this guilt, this burden, otherwise we would be no better than the common fool; which is actually pretty rare. Suffering is valuable, we need it. \n\nAgh, there is so much I want to say, but words are so very limited, and writings even more so.\n\nI don't see this 'animal mind' you speak of, that everyone speaks of (even though they use different terms for it), what I do see is people trying to Fix it, trying to purify themselves from this original sin that they supposedly have, using every religion and every scripture available, doing this that and the other, even though they say that you must be 'childlike'. I don't see any child doing this, do you? Well, I'm actually wrong on that, since people are now trying to enforce guilt on children, already convincing them that they are not good enough, that they're just filthy savages unless they suffer like the rest of us, and that they must get jobs, be spiritual, etc. otherwise they're not god enough (yes, god enough).  \n\nYou say you are not your mind, I'm sorry, but you indeed are your mind, not even 'your mind', just 'mind'.\n\nIf I tell you that you are the mind, who will object? It would be you, mr. Mind. Why are you trying to disguise yourself as a 'spirit', or an 'eternal being'? The very concept of existing, of being this \"I\", is of the mind, after all, they're just words with images that you carry around.\n\nWhen you say 'spiritual being', what image appears? The word 'spiritual' followed by some sort of light? And what about 'eternal being'? The empty dark space? Those are just words and images, you're trying to become a word and image. What I'm saying is pretty obvious if you take the time to just ponder about it. Those are words images, those are literally just words and images. Really, just words and images. Really, soul, spirit, eternal being, just words and images. Words and images. One more time, words and images. This thing that you imagine to be purified from the mind is just a word and image. Yet again, words and images, all of them. 'SP I R I T U A L - B E I N G', 'S O U L', 'E T E R N A L - B E I N G', just words, and consequently images. Let me misspell that for you, 'S U O L'. Words and images. just words and images.... \n\nWhy do we have all this objection in being just the 'M I N D'? There's plenty of self-help books that are saying the exact same thing; separate yourself from your fears, your anxieties; let go of your ego, as if people were not them. Who is it that wants to let go of what? Who is it that wants to become a better what? \n\nOur very speech reinforces this illusion. We use 'I think', as if there was something different than the thought, the spirit (again a word and the image that follows) that thinks. They are not separate, there is not an 'I' and the action of 'thinking', 'thinking' is 'I'. They are not two, not even one.\n\nI could go on as there's still much more to cover, and I will, just state your objections to this and I'll be glad to clarify it even further. \n\nEven then, forgetting the mind, what about the balance and evolution. Must we not remind ourselves of the journey we made from worm to man? Must we not remind ourselves from the balance?\n\nThe problem is that you'll always be carrying limited knowledge, because that's what knowledge is, limited. \n\nIf you say that you'll feel good, be good, based on the knowledge of the balance, you're saying that you'll feel good based on something limited. \n\nJust look at the weather, as the author says, there will be sunny days and rainy days, and I agree, but how will you ever know when sunny days and rainy days will turn up? \n\n\"Well it's been raining a lot, so a sunny day is bound to turn up\", except you will never know for certain, and it might not even turn up, there may be a severe climate change all of the sudden, an ice age or a global warming, how will you know? So now your security is based on something totally unpredictable. It's like taking an umbrella based on the weather forecast, they are right sometimes, and many many times they're wrong, there's just no way of knowing for certain, there are far too many variables. \n\nYou can't attach yourself to anything, not even knowledge, no matter how much time you take to memorize and look at your precious symbols, as they will always be limited, just like your list of opposites attests.  \n\nAbout evolution, why would you need to remind yourself that you were an infant, a teen, an adult, etc.? I mean, yes, it's good to know where you came from, but will that actually change you? In what aspect?\n\nNot to mention that you will only carry an image of it. You think 'evolution' and then what? You think of the worm/bacteria making its way to a human and that image you carry is the truth? \n\nSo you need to carry the correct images in order to pass this eternal test?\n\nThis covered a lot in just one sitting, so I'll again be awaiting replies. Just remember, I am not your 'enemy', I am not trying to prove myself better or more 'enlightened' than you, this is not a game, this is not a joke, this is not about the prettiest words and what sounds right, but what is.\n\nThank you for your time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410734827", "subreddit": "truthcontest", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Just leave it out. ~~Their classes on cinematography, lighting, photography and screen-writing opened my eyes to the amount of stories that could be told.~~(Sounds cheesy.)\n\n~~MAPS allowed me the opportunity to work as the~~(While at MAPS I studied under XX as the XX for projects XX and XX - Minus the 'Name' \"stuff\" Just label it with a capitol or italics.) ~~cinematographer for ‘Chrysalis,’ a short film detailing a young woman’s battle with anxiety and her partner.~~ For my work on Chrysalis, I was awarded the 2013 MRC ~~$3,000~~(nobody cares about the amount) Student Encouragement Award from the Australian Cinematography Society.

Never do this. It looks like you don't have enough to do. The girl in blue, hair looks bad, second photo you made her arm humongous(any woman who sees this will leave your site knowing you can't work with their heavy body parts), You photoshopped her roots and it's obvious(I hope that's what you did, because some of the shopping on her hair is pretty wacky), her poses are all bad. She's obviously a friend and not a model. She has trees coming out of her head. The rest aren't even portraiture. They are documentary of an event. So you have no portraiture at this point and it should just be removed.\nEvent| Move the event photos here. First two photos just show a building. The third actually shows patrons more clearly. But nobody is dressed, and they are all walking away. This looks like you waiting outside the arena and took a photo of people leaving a game. It then leads into a guy making a smug look, putting his hoody on, likely to hide from you? I don't know. Girl dancing on what seems to be an incredibly uneventful dance off. And her arm looks super weird. Next is some guy yelling? I don't even know. One guy dancing by himself. The guy behind him looks like he wants to end his life. All he's thinking is, I could be at home drawing more XXX hentai, but instead my friends convinced me to come here. So, only about 3 photos for event photography actually make it. The rest are gone.\nLandscape| Just remove it. You aren't promoting yourself as a nature photography. Everyone and their mom has seen these exact photos of another beach on another sunset time frame. Everywhere. Ever.\nGraffiti | Remove immediately.\nPet photography| Are you doing pet photography too? If not remove it. This isn't an I've done these 17 types of photography site. It's your business model. No respectable night club will ever hire you because of dog photos. It might make them think less of you though. These photos will only hurt you. Remove.\nMisc| Misc = I like this photo, but I don't know what to do with it. Remove all.\nSpots| Maybe I can see sports fitting into sports bars, whatever, but these aren't great shots. It's an indoor court with like, four people kicking a ball around. Looks like practice? Remove. Also shooting through grates - makes you look like a stalker unless it's done with finesse. Regardless sports photography never looks good from birds eye, outside of super special situations. Ground level only.\n\n**Ok well, that pretty much guys everything you have. You need to now contact local bars in person during business hours (not operating hours, business hours during the day) and ask the managers if you can come to their club and document for them for free so you can get the practice. You will photograph the patrons having a good time and deliver the files by the next business day. That last line is not an exception. Ever. They want their photos before you even take them. If you are a procrastinator, find a new field to shoot in.\n\n---\n\nContact\n\nOk, your physical address and location is on your about page. Your portrait is also on your contact page. This is backwards. Also showing your portrait gives away the little hidden chance you had at them not knowing you are the person in the portraits you are showing.\n\nFirst name last name should be combined to *name*\n\nThere shouldn't be a social media drop down on the menu item, it should just be listed as such. Remove the share buttons. Remove the comments are closed.\n\nYou have follow me! And share links.\n\n---\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy policy, you should condense this into your contact page and put it in pdf form. Nobody wants to read a legal disclaimer, they want to look at photos. And maybe hire you.\n\n---\n\nI just looked at 10 bars in your area and looked at their photos. All 10 had their own watermark. You might see photographers using their watermark on their site, but that's it. Putting your mark on their photos for their site = no business. Period.\n\nI'm going to make this last bit short and to the point, because it's literally all you need to do...\n\n1. Buy some sort of strobe attachment like a ring flash or whatever. Make sure it widens the source. [This](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1061/5146178548_ca172bf12a.jpg) looks like shit.

If you can make them look good with almost no lights on, you can do it at a club.\n\n2. Practice with your friends at a bar.\n\n3. Find a few bars to let you work for free until you produce good results.\n\n4. Do not promote yourself until you've done steps 1-3. Do not pass out your card, fliers, wing dings. When you shoot and people want your photos, tell them they will be on the bar's facebook page tomorrow.\n\nIf you can't do those simple things, you will never get going.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410750502", "subreddit": "photography", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "First, you keep using the fact that I'm using all of these \"shared accounts\" and that's where my weakness lies.\n\nI am using one shared account. As I've said twenty times, my iCloud account is separate. There is only one shared account for purchases. \n\n&gt;but you SHOULD take a big step back and take a 3rd person view of your own beliefs/behaviors and ask:... \"Is what I'm doing the BEST approach?\"\n\nUhhh... Yes. Because you have provided not even ANECTDOTAL examples as to WHY I should \"take a step back\" and review. NONE.

Ludicrous. It's a fucking AppleID, it's not a CIA asset.\n\n&gt;Again.. I'm not judging you,.. please do whatever you think is best for yourself... but if/when bad things happen (and on a long enough timeline, they will)... make sure you're fair about pointing blame.\n\nMmmm, yeah you are. Your entire position is based on judgement. And it's the worst type of judgement, because you have entirely Z E R O basis for it. \n\n&gt;This hack had nothing to do with AppleID's. It was a social-engineering weakness that exists in any system. (Google, Facebook, Twitter,.. etc..etc..)\n\nYou're just proving my point. I took a weak example of evidence, to maybe push some type of integrity towards your argument, and you turn it around by pointing out that it had nothing to do with Apple, which only results in your weak argument being even weaker.\n\nI'm done. I've already concluded that you were just saying a bunch of vague bullshit without evidence to illustrate a problem that doesn't exist. I was trying to pull out the basis of your arguments, but you have provided none, despite the burden of proof being on you. \n\nAt this point, if we continue, it'll just be an infinite number of comments with me begging you to provide evidence, and you repeatedly refusing to provide none.

That way, you can do set up moves to swap pieces around without affecting any other areas.\n\nThis guy is using a layer by layer method with 7 algorithms that move a lot of shit around at a time to accomplish very little. Tracking pieces when there are 6 or 7 pieces being used as buffers (ie they move around without actually contributing to the solve, only 1 or 2 pieces are positively affected) would be mind numbingly difficult.\n\nAlso, in blindfold solving, taking that long would actually be extremely negative. Blind solving uses triggers to memorize the order in which to do algorithms in the form of letters. The longer it takes to execute a trigger, the easier it is to forget the order of the 16+ triggers he would have to be using. Memorizing triggers like A E F G H I Q M O P B D G E K F B A and keeping that sequence fresh in your mind for THREE MINUTES is really hard.\n\nMost blind solves also have longer memorization stages than execution stages. If a real blind solver took 3 1/2minutes to solve, odds are there was about 2ish minutes of memo and just over 1 minute of solving.\n\nSo there you go.

{"body": "Wow, you already figured out a key (and relatively advanced) element to the strategy!  That was pretty fast too, we only put keys out in the wild a day ago.  Have you been playing all night? :p\n\nYes, there are two types of offense (call it Burst and Normal, or B and N) and two types of defense (lets call it Absorb and Sturdy/strong, or A and S).  You want B to fight their A, and N to fight their S.  Flipping it around, you want S to fight their B, and A to fight their N.  We'll write an article on our blog about this at some point.\n\nWhen all of these elements exist in the random set of units, it creates dynamism.  Players can move around getting elements of A B N S and shift their strategy depending on what their opponents weaknesses are.  This can sometimes result in some pretty late tech choices.  (By tech, I mean buildings that produce red, blue, and green resources.)\n\nSomething really interesting to me about this \"moving around\" business is that really high Elo players (much higher than me) seem to store gold a lot more often than me.  They may even hold 4, 5, 6, 8 gold on a turn to wait and see what I do.  This is kind of counter intuitive (in a game where every gold matters) and something that seems to separate really pro players from new and intermediate players.\n\nOf course, all of this is only an abstract, strategic concept.  Players still have important tactical considerations as well.\n\n***\n\nThat being said, I think we only disagree on the meaning of the word \"metagame\".  Metagames generally refer to simultaneous decision making.  In that context, there might be a \"metagame\" (more players on average choose rock in rock paper scissors, or most people choose hunter decks in Hearthstone, for example) that can influence your decision making (what RPS to throw, what deck to queue with.)\n\nAs for the bot, the bot is very temporary right now, and will not challenge a player that is familiar with the game.  But as I understand, fairly decent bots will come pretty soon (if I had to guess, a month-ish, but don't quote me on that).  As a player becomes an expert though, only humans can be very challenging, because the game is theoretically hard for computers to be good at anyways.  I guess this is probably a good thing though, because if you are high enough Elo, you won't be matched versus a bot, unlike games like Hearthstone which have severe problems with that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410780311", "subreddit": "Prismata", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "tl;dr crazy box is B R O K E N. Like really. Here's my take on how this run works -\n\nSo there's two types of gel dispensers in this game, paint drips (or something), and paint bombs. Drips instantly paint any surface they touch, but bombs are actually physics objects and can be pushed around and deflected if you're realllly careful. So the beginning of this video is just trying to paint as much as possible of the ground, because this gel dispenser uses these deflectable bombs. (For comparison, all the other gel dispensers in crazy box are drip dispensers.)\n\nThere's some odd gel boosting in chamber 2, I don't really know how it works but it seems to involve crouching and uncrouching against the wall.\n\nThe person spends like five minutes trying to jump on the railing. I don't know the specifics, but it probably involves a little almost-surf against the railing to gain a teeny bit more height. After that it's pretty much parkour and gel boosting to the gel pipes. More gel bomb deflecting, and then bouncing to the stucklaunch area.\n\nSo stucklaunching works when you get stuck somewhere, in this case near the pipes. The game tries to push you out of the pipes, but fails. All these small \"pushes\" get to add up, because it tries harder and harder to free you. When you do get pushed out, you get to keep all of the speed.\n\nClimb across the final chamber's invisible ceiling and ta-daaa, instant world record.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410820408", "subreddit": "Portal", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have an awful memory, and yet I never forget my scales. How? The trick is that you only ever need to memorise one scale: the major scale. Every other scale can be constructed from that.\n\nThe natural minor scale is the same thing, but starting on scale-degree 6, the harmonic minor is the same as the natural minor, but with a raised 7, the various modes are all constructed from major scale, starting on a different tonic, certain middle eastern/etc modes are constructed off of the harmonic minor scale starting on different tonics (sometimes with an altered note or two). \n\nYou get the gist. All the scales interrelate, and as long as you know the relationships, you don't need to memorise all the notes of all the scales, just the intervalic content of a single scale, and how it relates to other scales.\n\nOther than this, if you really want to name the notes quickly (outside of their intervalic construction), the trick is to memorise the relationship of various keys. The way to do this varies on the type of memory you have. If you're a visual learner, it may be simplest to just memorise the circle of fifths as an image. Most people would struggle with that however, so most people come up with mnemonics for it.\n\nPersonally, I remember the order of sharps as \"Father Chales Goes Down And Ends (the) Battle\", and the order of flats as \"(the) Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father\". Now this is enough if you remember that the circle is constructed with fifths clockwise and fourths counter-clockwise, as you can count in fifths/fourths around from C to any key to work out the number of sharps/flats, then apply the mnemonic to know what they are.\n\nYou can shorten this process however, in a number of ways. Firstly, if you begin the order of sharps mnemonic from F = 1b, and count clockwise, that will give you the correct order of keys up until B = 5#s. The same can be done with the mnemonic for the order of flats to get the other half, starting from Bb = 2bs and counting counter-clockwise, adding 'b' to the letter dictated by the mnemonic up until Fb = 8bs. You must however remember that where the mnemonics cross at Gb/F#you should respell this mnemonic's keys as their enharmonic equivalents (ie: Bb Eb Ab Db Gb B E rather than Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb)\n\nThis is all rather complicated to remember though, so I personally find it easier just to come up with new mnemonics starting from C = 0#s/0bs.  I use \"Covetous (and) Greedy Dictators Accept Easy Bribes\" for sharps, and \"Cowards Fear Blamefully Elevated Angelic Digits\" for flats, but you must remember that all the letters in the second mnemonic relate to flat keys, other than the C and F (ie: C F Bb Eb Ab Db, rather than C F B E A D).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410823001", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Why do you care if people think you're gay because of how you look...\n\nOh. Oh so it's like that. Well you know what bro?  If you're so chicken you can't even handle people merely thinking you're Gay &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;trade; when were out here serving style on a plate every day then *you don't even deserve to wear our label, you little bitch*. We make *you* look bad? No u! NO. U. You make us look bad! No you don't get to wear our label.  No cool clothes or tasteful decor for you! No sexy hair cuts or scarves for you! *and don't you even think about those brown brogues and that bicycle basket or so help me god*. Oh, you want incense and Persian rugs? F U C K Y O U. Aww, you want one of those little gay dogs because you happen to find them cute and they're easier to look after? PISS OFF. NO LITTLE GAY DOG FOR YOU. You little piss monkey. \n\nNo you don't deserve to wear our label, you couldn't pull it off anyway! \n\nSeriously though, I know the pressure to subscribe to these boundaries and not open yourself up to vulnerability, but honestly the only true answer is to stop worrying about what people think. That's all you can do. \n\nYour problem: you are worried people will think you are [INFERIOR] (and btw you should be flattered if people think you are gay because everyone knows we have the best style and are often way sexy so no fuck you it's a compliment and how dare you) \n\nThe solution: stop worrying whether people think you are [INFERIOR] and trust in yourself, lead by example, and show them that their opinion is of no relevance or importance to you and has no impact on you or your life and you dress your damn avatar on your damn game how you damn well want because you are your own person, and you just don't *care* if they think you're gay or weak or whatever. You just don't care. \n\nIn order to pull that off, you have to show that you are not such a \"pussy\" or a \"faggot\" by refusing to even *acknowledge* their stares or comments or jokes or jabs or their hilariously chimp-like attempts to undermine your masculinity in order to remedy their own silly insecurities by showing that you are secure in yourself and have the confidence and courage to continue to express yourself how you wish in spite of their judgement, without constraints and without succumbing to pressure from people who are jealous you aren't as worried about the opinions of others as they are, and do not have to bottom feed your confidence and validation in your masculinity by bringing down other men like some cowardly mutt, and do not care if people think you gay because you know being gay isn't something to be ashamed of. \n\nI used to go out looking very \"gay\" and still do though I also often just wear jeans and tshirts, suits etc. Guys would always shout shit and jeer at me but it was just like so what? It's a coat. Get over it. You just have to shake it off. Not so easy when they throw dip, but you still just shake it off. \n\nIt's nothing to do with my actual sexuality, just the stereotype that the only men who dress outside the standard boundaries of acceptable clothing were often gay because gay men don't have to worry about being seen as gay if they live as openly gay, which brings me to my second point: if more heterosexual men were \"metrosexual\" there wouldn't be a stereotype that the only men who aren't afraid to deviate from these boundaries are gay men, so people assume you're gay because heterosexual men don't express themselves in that way as often as gay men do. If they did, they wouldn't assume you're gay. \n\nSo I think it's important to lead by example\nby showing that you have strength and merit in your self confidence and individuality and reluctance to censor yourself because of irrational cultural norms and you don't fear the consequences of breaking these rules and getting \"gay bashed\" (even if you aren't gay) or stared at our laughed at or made fun of or having beer cans and vegetables thrown at you. That's the price you have to pay if you want to be fabulous in this greyscale world! That's the only way as a society we can collectively improve these things; through leading by example and taking the heat so we progress to a stage people don't have to worry about being seen as \"gay\" or \"metrosexual\" because everyone is over it \n\nOr come to Europe. Most guys these days are \"metrosexual\" here to the extent I'm starting to get pissed off because I keep hitting on heterosexual guys by accident every damn time. \"Metrosexual\" was a thing like 15 years ago, noweredays it's more about how confident you are in your own masculinity. So in a weird way instead of showing you're masculine through traditional symbols and behaviours you show it by proving how unafraid you are of *not* being seen as masculine. It's all about how you carry it off and if you can take the jeers and the stares. It's some next level shit... \n\nSnoop Dogg gets his nails done but he pulls it off. Why? Because he doesn't *care* what you think, Snoop wants a manicure so Snoop is getting a manicure. Snoop doesn't give a shit about your stares or your comments or your jokes about his manicure. Snoop wants a manicure, so he's having a manicure. He doesn't have time for your pussy ass problems. \n\nAnd that's what it's about really, the new name of the game is about how secure you are in your masculinity, not traditional symbols of masculinity or femininity like tshirts and flamboyant clothing or sports and manicures but your confidence in your ability to gain respect by opening yourself up to vulnerability through the breaking of culturally defined rules of appropriate and inappropriate expression depending on your gender. \n\nIt's about your security in your own masculinity, not what you do to merely appear or feel masculine. It takes balls to open yourself up to vulnerability in that way, to wear flamboyant clothing when you're a man or shave your head when you're a woman, but only a coward would be so terrified of the opinions of others they censors themselves and constrict themselves and become a chameleon or invisible just in fear of the jungle itself and whatever predators are out to get them and have to prey on easy targets in packs to feel alpha, and when you understand this, you understand who the \"real men\" really are ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410890280", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yeah again mostly trials riding, maybe that was misread as t r a i l s. For trials 22x16 is considered huge, most people rock 20x18. It needs to have the right ratio for pedal kicks or trials is extremely difficult. I use a 26 which is big for trials, \nAnd what is this rpm, you mean the wheel? How is that relevant to the gearing? I have a speed trap by my house, I can pedal to about 25 mph, I think the top I've hit is actually 24. That's on a flat street. I don't use suspension either because it's sloppy and bouncy and terrible for trials. I have a hard tail with front shocks and a full sus but I don't use them since I got the trials bike, it feels a million times better than any other type I have ridden. There's no real big downhill trails near me just lots of small hills so I've never come to a situation where I've found myself out of pedal while off road. Maybe it just works out on my terrain? Idk, but I can usually blast past the full sus guys that ride there as well as the team that practices there.  They all wonder why they can't keep up and I tell them it's because those bikes are too heavy and don't handle and they look at me like I'm crazy.  I've been riding motocross since I was 8. I know what suspension should feel like and how to handle a big bike but the suspension bikes feel like total garbage to me, try tuning the suspension and it's still crap compared to dirt bike parts. Id rather have none. Same deal with the shifters, until they invent an internal system that doesn't constantly break, I won't be using it. \nIt's not that the derailuer themselves don't work, it's just that you can't ride a rough trail and expect to to not be broken off half way down. I've snapped two 1/2\" thick steel tensioner a this year hitting rocks, had they been derailuer a idk how many I would have gone through.

But I didn't know how this sort of restriction in the example problem would alter the formula because I still feel like I don't have a complete grasp of the whole concept or else I'd be able to figure how this alteration (no boys can stand together) would affect the formula, but I can't quite see how it does. \n\nBut I wrote it out manually and actually got 144 as the answer. \n\nb g b g b g = 3! * 3! = 36\n\ng b g b g b  = 3! * 3! = 36\n\nb g g b g b   = 3! * 3! = 36\n\nb g b g g b   = 3! * 3! = 36\n \n\nso that would be 36 *4 = 144\n\nSince the girls are allowed to stand next to each other, just the boys aren't, I added the two other cases.

{"body": "It was a cold, dark morning when Jay Haynes pulled up to Green Oaks Cemetery. Two years ago to this day Jay's only child, Luke, was found dead in his college apartment. Luke's death had remained a mystery with no suspects or clues for the detectives to go on. \n\nThe grieving father jammed his keys into the car door and locked it. He turned and started his walk towards the site where his son lay buried. With his head facing down, his feet dragged him closer to the burial site. He mustered what courage he had and looked towards his son's grave. \n\nJay stared curiously at the grave. Obstructing his view was a woman on her knees. She was wearing a red football jersey with a large white 6 printed on the back. The letters H A Y N E S were written across the upper back of the jersey. \n\n\"Who are you,\" Jay gasped. There was no response from the stranger. \n\nHe tried again louder this time, \"Who are you?\". \n\nThe woman moved positions and sat on her backside with her legs crossed Indian style. \n\nJay racked his brain for an answer to who this mystery woman could be. He thought, \"Did Luke have a girlfriend in College? He must have, who else would be wearing his high school football jersey.\"\n\nHe crept closer towards the grave and stopped. From where he stood now an outstretched arm could reach the woman. \"Where did you get that jersey,\" he questioned.\n\nThe woman croaked, \"From Luke, where do you think?\" She turned around and faced Jay. \n\nJay's eyes locked onto hers. Staring back at him were aged eyes and a wrinkled face much older than his. The lady was old enough to be Luke's grandma. \n\nThe woman placed her hands on her knees and pushed herself into a standing position. She stretched both arms towards the sky and sneered something in Latin. \n\nIn an instant her body turned a glowing red color and began to smoke. Not the kind of smoke you would see from a fire, but more of a magical mist. Her body vaporized and the clothes that hung from her body fell into a lifeless pile of fabric at the foot of Luke's grave.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410907685", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No need to apologize.  The context you provided helps me to try to explain it in a good way, because weather is taught differently for forecasters vs. pilots vs. farmers vs. whoever.  You've got a lot of factors at work here and I think anyone can use a good rudimentary background.  So I'm going to end with the simple explanations, but the beginning here may help you focus your questions.\n\n----------\n\nThe atmospheric pressure is quite literally only a measure of the weight of the entire atmosphere in the vertical column above you.  Fluids (liquids and gasses) want to have a constant pressure distributed evenly and will so naturally.  The difference between high pressure and low pressure areas is that high pressure areas have more air and low pressure areas have less air, so these have to come from outside sources.\n\nSince the atmosphere has a given constant thickness (not quite true but for our purpose it's close enough), the reason for the 'highs' and 'lows' is that temperature differences change the density of the molecules in the atmosphere.  Back to the temperature differences, these all come from Land/Water, Night/Day, Atmospheric Layering, Latitudinal.\n\nSo here we come back to what you said.  High pressure is generally colder - with more molecules closer together in the vertical column of air above you.  Low pressure is generally warmer with less molecules further expanded in the vertical column of the atmosphere.\n\nLet's take a look at the Florida/Georgia vs. the Atlantic Ocean.  In the summer time, the land heats quickly and the ocean heats more slowly.  So in the summer the land is relatively warmer than the water.  With no other influences, the land will have low pressure, and the Atlantic Ocean will have a huge high pressure.\n\nIn fact, we call this summertime high pressure over the Atlantic the [[Bermuda High or Azores High]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores_High).  It's not perfectly over all the water, but is in principle exactly what we described.\n\nAt this point we have highs and lows all over the place containing uneven densities and temperature and these are physically next to one another.  Fluid Physics wants to redistribute this evenly both mass and temperature wise (moisture, too!), so you have a movement of the air in its best attempt to balance the equation: This is **Wind**.\n\nWind wants to go from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure to even things out, but it's not that easy.  We have a rotating planet and friction near the ground is especially high as well.\n\nThose frictions from the Coriolis Effect cause the turning of the winds that circle clockwise around a High Pressure system and they are counter-clockwise around a Low Pressure system (note: northern hemisphere only!)\n\nFor basic purposes these systems are mostly moving air that's on the ground and pushing or pulling it along the ground from one area to another to balance the columns of air.  There is some rising and sinking in the centers of the low and high pressure like you've seen in diagrams, but it's relatively small compared to the N S E W movements of the winds.  The up and down circulation is extremely important for events like rain and clear skies, but wind wise, the only time the upward and downward winds are even comparable to the cardinal direction winds is in convection, like thunderstorms or days with cumulus clouds - which I'm sure you've been cautioned about in aviation.\n\nThe movement of the high and low pressure systems is directly related to the upper atmosphere physics and boundaries like the coastline, or mountain ranges, or even latitudinal lines.\n\nBecause these systems move, they can pull air from long way away - like that Minnesota type system.  Notice that it's not NEARLY as cold once it gets to Georgia.  It's the same air that was in Minnesota (relatively speaking), but its moved over warmer ground further south (latitude effects) and mixed together with some of that warmer air along the way, the system is relatively cold - but not Minnesota cold.\n\nWhew.\n\nI think I've summed up all your questions in the most roundabout but hopefully helpful way.  Of course, you'll have plenty more, but I hope that I've helped.

Helpful specially if the monster moved a little or pushed you away.\n\n- Like different weapons, you can delay your attacks during a combo but only to a certain point, otherwise you may get stuck in the recovering animation. This also applies to rolling.\n\n- After certain attacks, such as the level 2 charges' uppercut, you can roll sideways, as long you are holding the direction you want to roll to.\n\n- Using level 2 charges' uppercut is the best way to KO a monster, since it deals 40 KO damage, after the 50 KO damage from a golfswing, but this one requires you to finish a pounding combo or successfully land a golfswing on the head after a spinning attack. Most monsters have an initial limit of 100 to get KO'd.\n\nEDIT: \n\n- While charging your hammer you are immune to low level wind gusts (like the ones Qurupeco causes when starting to fly) and low level current pressures (like the ones Gobul causes when charging at you).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410972520", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

Other than the composer wanting that note to be natural and notating it, is there any instance where you have to have a natural? \n\nin other words when you're writing out the scale of g major it would be G A B C D E #F G.

The official Date is October 25th and the donation button on http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com is updated with the current donation page. \n\nWhile the Pink colour is a representation for October for Breast Cancer Awareness - I want to point out that the funds from the event will be going towards support for all types of patients suffering with Cancer and also towards research to find a cure. When I set up the fundraiser - I requested this specifically from the Canadian Cancer Society.  I also know that a portion of the funds will be directed towards the International sector- for those wondering why we chose the Canadian Cancer Society all these years. \n\nIf you are interested in volunteering for the event still - we have another planning meeting this weekend at 1pm Central Time on GWEN Ventrilo \n\nWe will be following the meeting with a promotional CHARR Day in which we will be giving out over 1000 gold on behalf of Winkle Tinkle ( A player from Henge of Denravi) So encourage players to meet up in Black Citadel around 4pm Central with their Charr :) \n\nthanks again for supporting the event and if you have any questions or need the GWEN Vent info or have some donations - my ingame info for Guild Wars 2 is ( Yailith.4056)  \n\ncheers,\nRhonda aka M A L I B U Barbie", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1410998611", "subreddit": "Guildwars2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

To make a note sharp you raise it by a half step, and doing the opposite would make the note flat. You can also raise a note by a whole step.\nEx: C to C# is a half step while C to D is a whole step. \nThere is a such thing as a B# and E#, though these names are used less often as the spaces between B to C, and E to F are half steps. So \"sharping\" these two notes would land you on the same pitch as C or F respectively.\n\nWhat do the scales have to do with this?\nMajor scales all have the same spacing, meaning that the amount of steps between each note in the scale is the same no matter what key the scale is in (or what letter the scale begins with). \n\nThe spaces between each note in a major scale is always 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 as this is the most pleasing pattern for the ear to hear.\nBut a scale can only hold one of each note name.

{"body": "Well, been playing dota since circa 2006... as many of us dota 1 players, when HoN and LoL came along, i decided to give them a try, just for the change of pace. HoN was a different atmosphere, situated in the same universe, but with nice change of graphics and some new heroes, however it didn't last long. LoL was a completely different thing. I started playing it when the game was released, played for about 20, 30 matches and couldn´t feel any good similarity or even a small afondness with the game...maybe because i didn't enjoy the no-deny mechanic, or that (whatever its called) page of runes and the worst was the blink/wv for every hero. At the time, i couldn´t see how that game could become competitive, oh boy was i wrong. I don´t know how they became the millionares of this esport industry, followed by a massive horde of casual/tryhards, but they did something right. However, when that slasher thread came up, followed by a later \"they cant stream whatever\", i dropped every last of drop of respect i had for this company. I didn't have much to begin with, but that is just playing low and cheap. I guess the mass will never learn, and by upvoting threads by 'respect' (they didn´t have any for us competitors) is surely NOT the way to go, it is actually supporting a dull profit centered (my main language is not english, therefore i don't know a good term for this) that does not even need our viewership whatsoever.

Most businesses have exclusivity contracts, from programming to home \n\nBusiness cases are much much different, a company offering products attempt to sign a exclusivity deal with purchasers by offering incentives(think dell or lenovo). Companies vie for these contracts, it isn't leverage. This is an employment contract or at least seems like an employment contract. Exclusivity in an employment contract makes sense, but not when its aimed at the representative company. for example if you consider the player to be a entity being represented by a lawyer(team, eg or dignitas) essentially you are saying the lawyer cannot have concurrent clients which pose no conflict of interest other than being in direct competition with the company who offers the contract.\n\nTo me this is the definition of cornering the market using unfair tactics and poses a threat to the possibility of an open market. The LOL model of esports seems to work for them. However the LOL model also places more importance on the team rather than the player. Which is another matter all together. Regardless, my point being I see this as more of an issue rather than the simple business sense you have tried to portray it as. I understand the effective policies of a successful business but human assets are different and creating non compete clauses for companies representing the asset should be unethical and more importantly represents a lack of confidence in your own product.\n\nEdit: S O     M A N Y    M I S T A K E S\nalso this is my personal view I could be wrong. Convince me, at least show me how I am wrong. Also in anticipation i will say this is mostly geared towards the organisations restriction, player restriction I understand, it is an employment contract which regularly includes non compete clauses which honestly are fair enough.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411083494", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh man, without a doubt... the time I thought I took magic mushrooms. \n\n**TL;DR - Never trust people in Florida.**\n\nLet me explain.  \nSo I've taken shrooms before. Lots. But in Louisiana. However, I moved to Florida some years later in an attempt to get my life together, which went horribly awry to say the least. Had family there that helped me get on my feet. Of course the first thing I do after getting a job and an apartment is try to score drugs, like any natural idiot that hasn't learned his lesson yet. I'd venture to say, shrooms are not that kind of drug, but it speaks to the mindset involved here. \n\nSo I'm welding in a hot factory and the creepy guy that always looks spaced out, well he and I get into a discussion about tripping. He mentions that he knows a good place to get shrooms, and I'm like \"oh hell yes, I will pay\". He offers to give me some for free. I did not reply with \"no thanks\".\n\nSo he comes into work some few days later and tells me to meet him at his car during lunch break. I do. And he presents to me a gallon sized Ziplock bag full of fresh mushrooms. I inspect them, notice a few things that are different than what I was used to coming across in the cow fields of Louisiana back in the mid to late '90s, but throw caution to the wind using the completely fabricated and ridiculous line of fucked up logic that went something like, \"Meh, I guess shrooms look different here\". I stashed the bag in my car and eagerly awaited clocking out. During a fucking work week, mind you. \n\nSo I get home, first things first, scarf like 5 caps. These were monsters too. Yep. Tastes gross. Everything checks out. Wait 45 to an hour, nothing happening. \"Might need to take more.\" and that's what I do. Another 5 or so. And it is at this moment when I feel the nausea. But not the kind of nausea I'm used to. The kind that sends me to the bathroom at kinda 100 miles an hour so I don't shit myself on the way there. \n\nI hit the toilet, and while my ass is playing the role of a fire hose in some fucked up alternate dimension, I start projectile vomiting. All over the place. Shit is going down. And vomit is going out. Intense pain in the stomach... and a lightbulb goes off... \"hey, this ain't normal\".\n\nSo I get on the land line and 911 in a hurry. I tell them I think I ingested poisonous mushrooms, send the docs quick. Ambulance rolls up about I don't know when later, and I walk out to greet them. The EMTs get out and I explain the situation. And these motherfuckers think I'm just tripping. It literally took me at least 10 minutes to convince them I needed to go to the ER pronto. Finally, they let me in the amby and hook up some vitals stuff and then they realize, yea this guy has something else going on here. BP seriously low, etc. \n\nOn the ride to ER, I'm just getting sleepy. I guess my body is just starting to say, \"you know what? Fuck this. I quit.\"  \nThe next thing I remember, I have no shirt on, am in the ER with shit all attached to me, and I'm signing random papers (I had no insurance at all), then a nurse comes up to me and asks me to describe the mushrooms. I do. She goes away. Comes back some time later. Tells me my liver/kidneys/can't remember are at risk of failing because I ate a very serious poisonous mushroom(s). \n\nThen the worst part. They give me an ultimatum. \"get your stomach pumped, or drink this here milk shake\".\n\nWell fuck, I don't want no stomach pump. I'll have the milkshake!  \nOnly, the milkshake was black and made out of pure charcoal. The stipulation was, if I could not drink what amounted to a 48 ounce fucking big gulp full of liquid coal barbeque briquettes, I'd get my stomach pumped. So I got to it. \n\nLet me tell you something right now. Opt for the fucking stomach pump. I ended up vomiting gross charcoal shake back into more charcoal shake then drinking my own charcoal vomit just so I wouldn't have to get my stomach pumped. Laying there shirtless and bony, like some sort of fucking starving 3rd world homeless fuck making a meal out of the worst vomit he'd ever had, enthusiastically, just because he didn't want tubes down the inside of his body. \n\nEventually I got it all down and things settled. That period of torture was then followed by family members visiting me and looking p r e t t y fucking disappointed in me. \n\nNever again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411096956", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Getting OHS --&gt; HT resets is pretty fun.\n\n* Try using the charge skill so your next skill activates faster\n\n* Don't forget to be always casting Triumphant Shout and Tenacity so your mana is always up\n\n* Additional to your dodge, you can also use Leaping Strike and Charge to quickly get away from danger\n\n* Remember to use Dash so you have a better mobility allowing (for example) position yourself behind a boss or quickly follow him when he jumps/runs/etc...\n\n* (When soloing) Try grouping up mobs because you have AOE skills and it should speed up grinding\n\n* You should try to position yourself behind the boss so you'll deal more damage and get back crits\n\n* When you see a red eye flashing from boss, try using any of your stuns (Kick and Stunning Backhand) to interrupt them. \n\n(With Stunning Backhand, try having Overhand Strike off cooldown because if you do Stunning Backhand you will be a bit in an animation lock, but if you do Overhand Strike after it will cancel the animation lock)\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411136341", "subreddit": "TeraOnline", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Another clumsy fucker here. \n\nSome of my kid's favourite bedtime stories were Stupid Ways I Hurt Myself. He'd ask for them all the time, and crack up. \n\nWhere shall I start... \n\n* Age 2: swinging on the garden gate. Decide to hold on right near the hinge, gate swings open, top joint of right pinky gets mashed to hamburger. (it healed *amazingly* well, just two fine scars)\n\n* Age 5 or so, when I was forehead-high to a doorknob. I was standing against a door, trying to prevent someone from opening it. They shoved, and I still have a 1\" scar in my hairline. \n\n* Age 10: Moving house, putting some stuff in storage. I was carrying the stand for a dressmaker's dummy; basically a long pole on feet. Naturally, I held it aloft and chased my dad with it like it was a trident. Down a long, doorway-lined corridor. The feet caught on a doorframe, the pole stopped in a hurry, I didn't. Took a hefty chip out of three teeth. \n\n* Age 12: People coming to visit, I was tasked with doing the dusting. In the course of dusting a lamp, I squirted glass cleaner directly onto the lightbulb, which promptly shattered. I was very responsible, unplugged the lamp, swept up the glass, vacuumed the floor - all that was left was to remove the jagged stump of the lightbulb so I could replace it. Which I did with my bare hand. Got a pretty nifty lumpy scar on my finger to this day. \n\n* Age 13: Playing in the park with my sister - we had a tennis ball, and came across a picnic table. We took it into our heads to play a form of ping-pong, using the flat of our hands as paddles. I have approximately zero hand-eye coordination, and so ended up missing about 20 returns in a row. And I got *angry*. At the tennis ball. I was going to teach that fucking thing a lesson it would never forget. So I tossed it up, leapt into the air and S M A C K E D it down with every ounce of my strength. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, I have approximately zero hand-eye coordination, and the ball didn't hit the tabletop. Instead, it it the leading *corner* of the table, and bounced back towards me, rocketing skywards straight into my balls. I lay in the foetal position for a very long time, while my sister stood over me incapacitated with laughter. \n\n* Age 15: the park near us had a sort of maze of 4\" treated-pine logs sticking out of the ground. Naturally, I was too cool to walk on the ground, so I climbed up and walked along the tops. Lost my balance, fell, and took the corner of a log on the corner of my eye socket. Missed the eyeball by about 1/4\". Still have a lump on the bone there. \n\n* Age 16: found a huge magnifying glass, went out on a summer's day to see if it would work as a burning glass. It was really effective; out of curiosity, I focused it on a tiny chip of gravel, to see if it would melt. Nothing happened after a couple of minutes, so I gave that up. Picked up the piece of gravel, which melted a patch of my thumb. Not my proudest moment.\n\n* Age 18 or so: At the gym, they decided to pull the mini-tramp out for warmups that day - everyone ran up, bounced off it onto the gym mat, rinse and repeat. I was a fucking idiot and decided to try some 'trick' jumps. Landed on the mat in [this](http://myfiveminuteyoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PTOW-78.1.jpg) position, accompanied by a loud crunching noise from both knees. Was out of action for a while after that... \n\n* Age 23 or so: On holiday visiting my uncle, who lives on a tiny island in the English channel.  We went for a tour round the coast, and ended up in a pine forest. Walking around, tromping through the shin-deep pine needles, we came to a steep hill. My brother and uncle took the little steps down cut into the hillside, whereas I thought it would be far more fun to run down the hill itself. So I started running, and picked up a huge amount of speed - my feet could barely keep up. As I ran, I remembered we were on the coast and yes, that grey patch dead ahead of me was the crawling sea at the bottom of a 50-foot cliff, with lots of interesting jagged rocks to land on. There was absolutely no way to stop in time, and my turning circle was a lot bigger than the space I had left. Only one thing for it: reach out, veer hard to the right and attempt to catch a pine tree.  I had full-body carpet elbow for a week. \n\n* Age 25: Was cooking, reached into the cupboard without under the stove to get a pot out, right at the back. Caught my hand on something very painfully, realized I'd managed to get it wedged in the gap between the galvanized iron stove enclosure set into the counter, and the splintery edge of the hole in the countertop that it was set into. Fucking jesus, this hurts.  Okay, don't just yank it away, or you'll rip the shit out of it. Push *up*, push *back* slowly the way you came, then lower it down. Easy does it... gah, that hurt. How badly am I cut, ffs? Pull my hand out, no blood. Then what was... oh. *OH*. I hadn't caught my hand on a sharp edge, I'd brushed it against the underside of the stove element, which was on.

{"body": "I wrote a piece (mostly) using the whole tone scale.  The synthesized recording is crappy, but you can listen to [Bytes for Two Trumpets](http://offtonic.com/music/brass.php#bytes) and see what I did.\n\nWhile the scale doesn't produce a tonic, you can pick a note to be the center and mold your tunes around it.  The standard diatonic scale, in contrast, is not symmetric, but even there you can pick any note to call the tonic.  If your diatonic scale is C D E F G A B and you pick D as your tonic, you have the dorian scale.  If you pick G, you have the mixolydian scale.  Similarly with the whole tone scale, except you get a whole tone scale no matter what note you pick.\n\nMy favorite way of looking at the scale, in C, would be C D E F# (G) Ab Bb C.  The G isn't really there (though I use it in Bytes), but you can see how this scale actually makes sense.  If you cross the F#/Ab line, you're in ambiguous territory because F# to Ab is actually a diminished third rather than a major second, but otherwise, you're in a relatively stable tonal context.  You have your major chord C E, which doesn't have the G but you don't really need it anyway, and the F# (the lydian note) and D are your beautiful major color tones.  Ab Bb C is a great borrowed cadence from minor, and the Bb is also the mixolydian note.  You can use F# instead of G much of the time, actually, because the F# is kind of like a suspension towards the G.  If you watch old comedy movies on USA, the intro always has the main kid on a bicycle going around the town with a quirky (for the time) rhythm that replaces the 5 with a #4.  You can even put that in the bass.  Instead of going 1 - 5 - 1 - 5, you can go 1 - #4 - 1 - #4.  What you're really missing here, though, are other tonal chords, because you have no 4 or 5 for a dominant or subdominant.  You'll have to rely on other chords for this.  The bVII is a good replacement for the V.\n\nThe idea, though, is to experiment.  Use clusters, because why not?  Do whatever you want.  But stay away from scales, because there's really nothing interesting about the whole-tone scale when played as a scale.

{"body": "I'm often in agreement with you, but here I have a different preference: I don't like types to be encoded in names.\n\nThere are several reasons I keep concrete type hints out of names:\n\n* a simple name should convey intent, rather than implementation\n* reading and mental noise\n* types can change... having to reflect types in the name can impose resistance to such changes, or be ignored leaving a mismatch\n* types are not always simple, and then things can get confusing when deciding on a prefix or reading and misinterpreting because you trust what you or someone else \"encoded\" in the name\n\nThe name, in a context, should be enough to give a working-understanding of the value, without tagging types. And often this name-in-a-context carries more information than the type explicitly encodes: such as unit-vector, versus arbitrary vector, or an index as opposed to any integer. You don't name normal vectors `vN` do you? I prefer just `n`. I'll also use `n` in unrelated contexts as non-specific integer, or natural number. `i` can be fine as an index, but if there are other integers around, maybe `idx` or `index`, but `iIndex` is noisily redundant in my mind.\n\nThe last place I worked was C++, of course, and used similar prefixes as part of our guidelines. Distinguishing member variables is certainly valuable, much like prefixing globals, really. And enumerators, since it's so easy to assign an arbitrary integer -- the 'e' prefix adds some discipline-level safety. But beyond that seemed of dubious net-worth.\n\nMy current environment is a bit different though. In OCaml, I never tag a name with type. I rarely have any types explicit at all! But a lot of types are polymorphic or functions anyway. A name is sufficient, in general. When I need to know a type, I ask the editor.\n\nYou might think this is horrible in comparison, but since I have a general orthographic matrix function handy:\n\n    let orthographic_asym l r b t n f =\n      let dx = r -. l in\n      let dy = t -. b in\n      let dz = n -. f in\n      { mx = { r = M33.of_diagonal (2./.dx) (2./.dy) (2./.dz);\n               t = { x = -.(r+.l)/.dx;\n                     y = -.(t+.b)/.dy;\n                     z =   (n+.f)/.dz } };\n        wa = Vec.null;\n        w  = 1. }\n\nSome people's eyes will bleed, sure. But the \"`+.`\" and similar tell me (and the compiler) that the operations are on floats. I made an unusual choice to compose geometric types: so 4x4 matrices are actually a 4x3 matrix with a \"w\" vector, and the 4x3 is a 3x3 with a \"t\" vector, and the 3x3 is, of course: x,y,z vectors.\n\nWorking with matrices in this nested record form is not the most performant for full matrix multiplies, and it takes extra memory, but it's really handy for working with the subcomponents, which is pretty common! I think it makes a lot of code clearer too -- reusing vector and 3x3 matrix code.\n\nI find it interesting that we both kept similar operations explicit. I just tried (for the second time, I'm sure) writing it with vector ops, and it's more succinct, but seems to lose something by turning the inputs into corner-vectors and working with them.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411330643", "subreddit": "gamedev", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Is that realistic?\", that's a useful, interesting post. \n\nPosting something like this:\n\nA e I o u\nB c d f g h j k l m n p q r s t v w x y z\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nIs not a post.

So why should a list of sounds be enough?\n\nIf you want help, you have to do more than say \"here, tell me something?\" You have to ask questions, or explain what you're trying to do, or show neat creative bits you added, and why they're neat and creative to you. THEN you can ask what we think in a generic sort of way.\n\nDo you see what I'm saying? I'm not saying ban phonology posts. I'm saying ban posts that are nothing but a list of phonemes and generic / trivial questions. At the same time, ban any other list of x followed by \"what do you think\".

{"body": "You are a master of irrelevancy and obfuscation in a lost cause, I'll grant you that. Your approach is self-conclusory and completely anti-science. Anybody going through all the comments will conclude that you are an idiot. Your high water mark so far has been your attempt several comments back to somehow link gravity with significant time dilation (it exists, but on a nanosecond basis for Earth) which I ignored for the witless logical ruin that it was. **I've demonstrated with overwhelming evidence that Krypton was a high gravity, high atmospheric pressure planet.** Your knowledge of Krypton is as limited as your knowledge of H'Raka. Here's even more evidence from the official MOS novelization that you reject:\n\nKrypton itself soon followed. Vast tectonic plates buckled, venting mountainous sheets of glowing ejecta into the upper atmosphere and beyond. Continents crumbled and seas boiled over, as the planet's contaminated core built to a critical mass. A series of global detonations overcame the **tremendous gravity** that held the planet together.\n\n...\n\nThe rocketing vessel passed through an asteroid belt, successfully avoiding any collisions with the orbiting space debris. Then it arrived at **the third planet from the sun-a medium-sized blue world** distinguished by two ice caps, expansive oceans, and several continents, as well as an atmosphere conducive to organic life.\n\nElectromagnetic signals, radiating from the planet's surface, indicated the presence of a rudimentary degree of technology\n\n**The planet's gravitational pull was significantly lighter than Krypton's**, but proved sufficient to capture the approaching starcraft. Ceramic heat shields boiled away as the ship entered the atmosphere, blazing through the upper reaches like a falling star.\n\nch. 6\n\n\n---\n\n\nch. 14 - \"Jor-El\": \"Earth's gravity is weaker\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n\"It's nothing,\" she insisted. \"I just… when you were a baby, I used to lay by your crib at night, listening to you breathe. It was hard for you at first. You struggled. And I worried all the time. The doctors thought it was asthma, but **your father and I knew the truth. You were adapting to our world.\"**\n\nch. 16\n\n\n---\n\n\nClark's shoulders slumped. For the first time since learning to fly, he felt trapped. Was this what **Krypton's terrible gravity** felt like? He wished his human father was still alive to counsel him.\n\nch. 20\n\n\n===\n\n\nSuperman tested his shackles again. Straining beyond his limits, he ripped one loose, freeing his right arm. Jax-Ur's sunken eyes grew wide. **Coughing painfully**, he staggered out of the lab as quickly as he could manage. He clutched the stolen blood sample to his chest.\n\nch. 22\n\n\n===\n\n\nSuperman prayed he was right. **He took a deep breath of the escaping air, filling his lungs, and dived though the breach into space.** Momentum carried him away from the Black Zero and he let Earth's gravity pull him down toward the planet below. His telescopic vision locked onto the glowing escape pod as he pivoted and shifted direction, taking off in a controlled dive.\n\nch. 22\n\n\n===\n\nZod staggered to his feet, shaken and off-balance. Burning gasoline blazed across his cape and he yanked it angrily from his shoulders. His **force-helmet** was cracked and sputtering, deformed by its collision with Superman's fists. Unable to maintain its integrity, it began to dematerialize.\n\nZod blinked as he tried to bring his vision into focus. He stared at his hands in bewilderment.\n\nSuperman could guess what he was seeing-the same shifting electromagnetic spectrum that had overwhelmed Clark as a small child, the world ablaze with disorienting colors, the deafening cacophony of a million amplified sounds.\n\nFinally Zod's helmet dissolved in a shower of sparks, **leaving his face and lungs fully exposed to Earth's atmosphere. Gasping, he reeled away. He threw his hands over his ears in a futile attempt to muffle the sonic barrage. He choked on his words as he glared furiously at his foe.**\n\nch. 24\n\n\n===\n\n\nHardy fell to the ground. Gasping in surprise, he saw Superman take the fight to Faora. He grabbed her flickering helmet with his bare hands and ripped it off her.\n\nThe effect came quickly. Faora shrieked and dropped to her knees on the pulverized blacktop, clutching her ears and squeezing her eyes shut. The icy beauty of her face was contorted by agony. It was as it she was being barraged with flash-bang grenades. Sensory overload incapacitated her.\n\n\"You feel that, Faora?\" Superman said. \"We're not on your ship anymore. We're on my world.\"\n\nForcing her eyes open, she tried to focus them on her assailant. Tears streamed down her face as she struggled to rise. Her hands flailed blindly before her, as though she could barely see.\n\n\"Savor it while you can,\" she hissed. \"You won't win. For every human life you save, we'll kill a million more.\" She raised her voice until it was loud enough for Hardy and all his men to hear. \"In a few days' time, they will all be dead.\"\n\nch. 22\n\n===\n\nThe dropship touched down on the tarmac. Segmented limbs served as landing gear. A valve slid open and a solitary figure emerged in a haze of heat vapor. Clearly female, she wore an intimidating suit of jet-black armor. Jagged fins added to the uniform's fearsome aspect. A space helmet, **with a visor that consisted of an opaque force field**, concealed her features-even from his X-ray vision.\n\nch. 20\n\n===\n\n\nShe walked briskly across the runway toward Superman; confidence echoed in her every step. She saluted him with military precision and activated a control on her armor. Her visor went transparent, revealing the striking feature of an attractive female with short dark hair and icy brown eyes. Like Jor-El, she could easily have been mistaken for human.\n\n\"Kal-El,\" she addressed him. \"My name is SubCommander Faora-Ul. On behalf of General Zod, I extend you his greetings.\"\n\n... Faora knew she had the upper hand. She turned the visor opaque once more, hiding her cruel smile **behind a faceless forcefield**. \n\nch. 20\n\n---\n\n\nFaora removed her helmet. She took a deep breath of the ship's **pressurized** air.\n\nch. 20\n\n---\n\n\nSuperman struggled to overcome this unexpected weakness. His head throbbed painfully. His limbs felt like rubber. His vision blurred. Sudden chills alternated with feverish hot flashes, while pressure built within his ears. He heard Lois calling out from what sounded like miles away.\n\nch. 20\n\n===\n\n\nSwanwick tried to fathom what he was seeing.\n\n\"Nuclear, chemical, kinetic-no known weapon can cause that type of damage,\" he said. Then he turned. \"What've they hit us with?\"\n\n\"Looks like some kind of **gravity** weapon,\" Dr. Hamilton theorized. He called up what he referred to as a \"gravity map\" of Metropolis. Most of the city and outlying boroughs were rendered in orange, indicating regions of normal gravity, while a circle centered on the Kryptonian ship edged into blues and greens.\n\nThey watched grimly as the circle steadily expanded.\n\nHamilton toggled to another screen. A similar graphic depicted the same destructive phenomenon at a location in the Indian Ocean, where the other segment of the ship had come to rest on an insignificant island.\n\nA cross-section of the Earth, extrapolated from seismic readings, showed pulsing \"gravity waves\" ping-ponging back and forth through the planet's interior, from the island to Metropolis and back again, growing in intensity with each volley.\n\n\"It's working in tandem with their ship,\" Hamilton explained, indicating the anomaly on the island. **\"Somehow they're increasing the planet's mass.** Clouding the atmosphere with particulates.\" A look of realization dawned on his face. \"My God, they're terraforming.\"\n\n\"What?\" Captain Farris didn't recognize the term.\n\n\"Planetary engineering,\" Swanwick translated. He'd read enough science fiction to be familiar with the concept. \"Modifying a world's atmosphere and topography.\n\n**\"They're turning Earth into Krypton,\"** he added.\n\n\"But what happens to us?\" Farris asked.\n\n\"Based on these readings,\" Hamilton said, \"there won't be an ‘us.' If this keeps up, **the increased gravity alone will crush our internal organs**.\"\n\nSwanwick had no reason to doubt the scientist. This was more than just an enemy attack. The human race was facing extinction.\n\n‘How long do we have?\" he asked.\n\n\"In Metropolis?\" Hamilton performed some quick calculations. \"A few hours. **Maybe a few weeks for the rest of the planet. After that, Earth won't be able to support human life.\"**\n\n\nch. 28\n\n---\n\n- M A N   OF    S T E E L™ T H E   O F F I C I A L   M O V I E   N O V E L I Z A T I O N First edition: June 2013\n\n**Kneel!

{"body": "1. The relationship of the intervals between the notes changes the sound.  Just because C Major is C D E F G A B C and A minor is A B C D E F G A doesn't mean that they sound the same.  Just like chords, scales and modes are given their character by the notes which change in them.  In the case of major to minor, A minor has the intervals of a flatted third, sixth and seventh when looked at from the major scale.  In other words, it's the order in which the notes are played that makes the difference.\n\n2-3. It's absolutely not arbitrary.  The answer to this question ties into question 3, so I'll answer it here as well.  Every chord in a key has its own mode attached to it:  \n\nI - major/ionian \n\nii - dorian \n\niii - phrygian \n\nIV - lydian\n\nV - mixolydian\n\nvi - aeolian/natural minor\n\nvii - locrian\n\nSome notes in each scale will not be acceptable other than a passing tone over a chord (with the exception of the IV chord.  Everything works if it's diatonic.)  The reason for this is that say, the 4th scale degree of the major scale will clash and sound extremely dissonant over a I major chord due to it being a half step above the chord tones.\n\nQuestion 4 (since reddit keeps reformatting it to 1 again) No.  Every chord needs its own mode for proper melody.  Some notes are interchangeable, but that gets complicated quickly.\n\nBonus: Don't ever let someone tell you that modes are useless because nobody writes \"modal music\" anymore.  Not only is this false, but it's also missing the point of modal use in modern composition in the first place.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411481138", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "with regards to meditation (or in general, a behavioral system that urges people to spend less time being disturbed by the world, so to say), yeah, i think you got the gist of it, what i dislike about it. i actually touched upon it in a paper i did at the master level. to me, it's actually fairly complicated what goes on when people doing these activities experience what they do and maintain the idea that this is preferable to any alternative.\n\nmoving on to the next part, you're losing me again. it gets far too ethereal and metaphorical for me. i mean, i'm not adverse to using poetic language myself, but it has to be backed up by solid words too.\n\ni guess i'll settle with saying that... well, i'm not convinced, neither that meditation is any sort of unique practice, nor that the supposed machination of said practice does what it does. there's been a lot of attention in recent years to it, but there's less willingness to break it down and analyze it in detail, which leads me to believe the investigators are being dishonest (without being aware of it), focusing on narrow aspects in their studies of it.\n\nand now, right here, i'll have to insert an objection: \"certaing buddhist meditators\" were most certainly _not_ \"the first phenomenologists\". _phenomenology_ is a tradition founded by husserl. do not confuse with whatever general notion of the word that you may or may not have in mind. and the philosophical system has _nothing_ to do with \"deepening and expanding\"... what philosophers need in this regard is _concentration_ and _hard work_.\n\ni get from the last part that you probably just meant what i'd call \"first-person perspective\" (which is indeed a key figure in phenomenology). funny you should mention peirce (_and i do mean_ ***p e i r c e***), who i've also spent some time on - funny too, in the sense that there's a certain compatibility between \"peircianism\" (i won't say \"pragamaticism\", because as far as i'm aware he wasn't even sure of that label himself) and phenomenology. however, the important thing to note about peirce is that some parts of his system are entirely obscure, which makes it hard to figure out what's going on.\n\nthat being said... dualism is terrible. you might be able to speak of a spectrum, but it would be a spectrum of _language_, it wouldn't be an ontological one. the whole trick is to have what we speak about make sense, when we start putting it into models. and dualism _never_ make sense, when attempted as models. they get more and more intricate and complex over the years (from like, descartes and onwards), but they never become solid. phenomenology goes in another direction, insisting in starting from the first-person perspective (there it is again), and not simply jumping out into the third-person without skipping that first important step. heuristic or not, dualism should be doomed, banished, eradicated, what have you... it really is a defunct holdover from older times.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411492660", "subreddit": "InsightfulQuestions", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I thought it would be nice to date some deaf girls for a change so I was dressed up all classy in my jeans, buttoned up shirt, and hair combed slickly to the side.  I headed out to the bar where the Deaf Night Out event was being held at.  Somewhere on the 6th street in Austin.  My first time for Deaf Night Out but not for the 6th street.  After all, I'm only thirty five years old and I deserved some fun.\n\nI was already tinkering my glass mug with the new friends at my table.  Three guys and two girls.  They kept on signing about how cheap those drinks were and how the night is so young.  I had an eye for this hot deaf girl sitting next to me and she kept on tapping on my elbow for me to look at her, listen with my eyes about her classes.  She had brown hair, brisk curls, brown eyes, nose with fine wrinkles every time she laughed, constantly showing her teeth as she broke in laughter. She had a cute little scar running from her eyebrow up to her forehead. Her name was Stephanie.  She asked for my name sign and I gave it to her.  She replied, \"your name sign is very familiar, have I met you before?\"  I just shaked my head.\n\nShe kept on signing stories and taking a big swallow full of drink.  Sometimes she would lean on me and laugh at jokes from others.\n\nI felt that the world's night was right until her boyfriend showed up.  Well, how did I know? She introduced him to me, \"This is my BF.\" She spelled BF then J...E...R...R...Y and showed me his sign name.  My stomach turned over and I wasn't really liking my drink anymore.\n\nAbruptly, I got up and headed outside. There were some wildflowers oddly placed along the sidewalk as I made it around into the alley to take in the cool fresh air. It was tough for me to take it all in.  I guess I was not ready for this kind of emotions along with the alcohol.   I liked her so much but I hated the feeling that she was never available.  Maybe I fell too hard for her and now it's hard to know that I can't have her.\n\nI had to lean over after my stomach has taken its sour turn, I vomited.  Dizziness and nauseous swam around my head then I had to go down on my knees.  Then I fell over and passed out. \n\nI woke up and saw that it's broad daylight; that I am still on the ground in the alley.  As I got up to survey the surrounding, buildings were not taller than I expected.  I turned around and realized that there aren't any skyscrapers anymore. At least none were over 5 stories tall and I could clearly see the capitol from where I stood.  I made my way to the street and saw that there were many old vehicle but they looked brand new.  I could make out some '80s models moving along the street.  People walking, dressed as it was '80s too, staring at me as I stood there looking around.  Was it a movie set that I woke up in middle of?  Or, I laughed to myself as I thought this, did I time travel?\n\nI reached into my pockets and discovered that I still had my iPhone, few twenty dollar bills, and a receipt from Walmart with the current date.  The twenty dollar bills were worthless here because it's printed with the future years. I saw a magazine stand further down the street and made my way over to there.  As I walked over, I noticed that there were some drastic changes along the streets and the buildings.  The Frost Bank Tower, Austonian and other towers were nowhere to be found as I looked around. Just wide open blue sky with some clouds.\n\nI grabbed the newspaper and saw that it was September 1983.  It wasn't September 2014.  I checked my iPhone and it had the date of September 23, 2014.  Only had 7% of battery left and no signal.  I turned off the iPhone for now.\n\nMentally, I pictured where the Texas School for the Deaf campus is located and I aligned myself toward the Congress street.  As I walked along, I approached few strangers.  All of them rejected to me as soon as I mentioned that I am deaf and in need of assistance.  Of course, we didn't have deaf rights before the 1990s.  ADA laws, TRS, and couple of more that were developed after the beginning of '90s.  Or maybe those strangers were just plain rude. I didn't care - I just kept walking.\n\nAs I made across the bridge on the Congress bridge, I turned around and looked back. I could see that the Texas State Capitol stood out right out at the end of the Congress avenue.  And that the buildings, surrounding the capitol, did not loom as heavily as it did in 2014.\n\nI arrived at the TSD entrance and approached to sign with the security guards.  They let me pass in just because I was deaf and capable of using America Sign Language.  I wandered around and discovered that they were getting ready to leave off to Arkansas for a football game.  Of course! That's where I was born! Arkansas.  I walked by some nice garden of wildflowers and I plucked a white colored blossom and stuck it in my shirt's pocket.\n\nI approached an adult, middle 40s, in a decent shape, wearing a golf cap, and inquired in sign language about if I could have a ride back to Arkansas on the bus.  He was very warm and friendly, he asked about where I was from and if I knew anyone from Arkansas. I mentioned some names of the teachers from Arkansas School for the Deaf that I remembered from my childhood. He knew who they were and was glad to tell his female assistant that I'm welcome to ride along. \n\nI found a seat near the front of the bus and sat to wait.  I watched the football players getting on the bus, many scarcely teenagers, some with acnes, most scrawny and few muscled, synchronized rhyme of getting on the bus to sit.  Few girls got on the bus as well.\n\nThen I saw a little girl walk along on the sidewalk with an older woman. She had that little scar from her eyebrow to the forehead.  I had to get off the bus quickly to meet with her.  When the older woman looked at me, I pointed at the child and then used Stephanie's sign name.  She nodded then I bent my knees down to look at her.  Stephanie asked, \"Who are you?\"   I gave her my name sign and signed \"I have a flower for you,\" then grabbed the white flower from my shirt and gave it to her.  She took it and struck it into her shirt's pocket.  I asked about the scar on her forehead.  She explained that she accidentally fell off a bench when she was out for a walk with her mother.  I only smiled as Stephanie and the older woman walked away.\n\nI turned around and saw another boy coming but he was interrupted by a coach. The coach was displeased with this kid about the way the kid had not been responsible. He denied the accusations and then the coach just walked off.  I was astound at the way the coach handled the situation. I waited at the bus for him to get on the bus.  He quickly introduced himself as Jerry Covell and then I told him, \"You should learn to stand up for yourself some day.\"  He nodded and signed, \"You're so right.\"  I followed behind and took my seat in the same spot on the bus. \n\nThe bus begun to move after the coaches and the bus driver got on the bus.  I was excited to return to Arkansas. Maybe I will run into some old faces and be able to unravel some mysteries of my unique situation.\n\nCoach signed to everyone when we crossed into Arkansas that we would be having a short detour to meet up with one of his old friends in Malvern.  It was two hours before we got to Malvern and pulled into one of gas stations. I was shocked at how much Malvern had been in the early 1980s.  My ex wife was born here and grew up here. I wondered if I should go over to where she grew up but I realized that her family has not moved here to Malvern just yet.  But I took a look around and took in the small town that had grew into a larger town.  Walmart and its small strip malls weren't there as it was in 2014. Just plain dusty field next to the interstate 40.  Finally this man, that the coach was expecting, arrived and sat at the picnic table.  I stared at him for a bit.  He was familiar but I could not place where I have seen him before.  Then I remembered that it was 1983. My mind clicked.\n\nI rushed off the bus and ran toward him.  I told him, \"I know you! You're Ed Bosson?\" and used his name sign.  He looked at the coach and then back at me. He signed, \"Do I know you?\" I said, \"No I'm certain you don't but I know you. You're the man who invented the VP.\"  \"VP? What's that?\" And I spelled out, V I D E O P H O N E then he shaked his head like he didn't understand what I was talking about.  I said, \"Oh you know webcams that are used for computers.  You would figure it out how to network up those webcams across internet, I N T E R N E T, and then deaf people can sign to each other on the monitors, M O N I T O R S.  You know what I mean?\"   Then just as he answered next, my cloud of mind cleared away and I realized how young he really was and that it was 1984.  Internet wasn't invented yet.  Computers were still at the early stages of its own era. Then I realized I have ruined the future by revealing what would happen in the future.  \"I still don't know what you're talking about,\" he signed to me.  I apologized and then walked back to the bus.\n\nCoach wasn't happy with me as we made our way to the deaf school in Little Rock.  I must have embarrassed him by being the crazy stranger who may have had a mental issue.  I was glad to step off the bus and look around.  Things have changed since 1984.  I could see that they haven't expanded the Vocational building, that they were under construction to build the KidCo building, and that there weren't enough parking spots for the vehicles.  There were many big building missing from the Little Rock skyline as well.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411504814", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sure man.\n\nI will give you a crash course right here.\n\nDo you know the major scale? You really, really should because it is the basis around which all theory is built and the reference point for all musical vernacular, like \"flat 5\" etc.\n\nIt is the old do ri me fa so la ti do.\n\nOkay, so we'll use the C major scale: C D E F G A B\n\nEver hear about the \"relative minor\"? If you count through C major to the 6th note, it is A. And everyone knows that the 6th note is the \"relative minor\". I will demonstrate: Play a C major chord and play a few notes from the C major scale over it, and it will sound just like a major scale. Now, play an A minor chord and play the C major scale over it. Suddenly those same notes sound sad, etc. That is because the C major scale = the A minor scale! Same exact notes, but the chord underneath changes it from a major scale to a minor scale.\n\nEach note in the major scale works the same way - they tell you what mode your major scale would be if you were playing it over different chords. \n\nHere are the modes in order of appearance:\n\nIonian (this is the major scale) - Play the C major scale over a C major chord, and it's Ionian, the major scale in the key of C.\n\nDorian - This is the 2nd mode. In a C major scale the 2nd note is D. So if you play a C major scale over a D minor chord, it's Dorian in the key of D.\n\nPhrygian - This is the 3rd mode. In a C major scale the 3rd note is E. So if you play a C major scale over an E minor chord, it's Phrygian in the key of E.\n\nLydian -  This is the 4th mode. In a C major scale the 4th note is F. So if you play a C major scale over an F major chord, it's Lydian in the key of F.\n\nMixolydian - This is the 5th mode. In a C major scale the 5th note is G. So if you play a C major scale over an G major chord, it's Mixoydian in the key of G.\n\nAeolian (the natural minor) - This is the 6th mode. In a C major scale the 6th note is A. So if you play a C major scale over an A minor chord, it's Aeolian in the key of A. This is the one everyone learns.\n\nLocrian - This is the 7th mode. In a C major scale the 7th note is B. So if you play a C major scale over an B diminished chord, it's Locrian in the key of B.\n\nBut why?: because *chords are built from scales*. Take the same C major scale: C D E F G A B. Now, to harmonize the scale into chords, we \"stack 3rds\", which means we use every other note. So, starting from C, we use C, E and G to build the first \"triad\". That is where chords come from. If we continue starting at each note and stacking 3rds on them, we get every chord in the key. And you will find that you end up with C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor and B diminished. \"But why are some chords major, some minor and what the fuck is a diminished?\" Play an E major chord in the usual way. Now make it minor. See how you lifted that one finger? What you did was flatten the third. You need 3 notes to make a chord: the root, the 3rd and the 5th. If the 3rd is flattened, it is a minor chord. When you stack the major scale in 3rds to make chords, some have the flat 3rd, some don't. And you always get the same pattern: major, minor, minor, major, major, minor and a diminished. The diminished chord has a flat 3rd *and* a flat 5th.\n\nNot coincidentally, the modes follow the exact same pattern of majors and minors, because it is all intrinsically related. \n\nNotice this: only the 1st, 4th and 5th chords in a key are major. This is the \"1, 4, 5\" that blues and most other American music is based around. \n\nThe change from the 5 to the 1 is the strongest in music. In theory terms that I won't delve into at the moment, the 5th is known as the \"dominant\" chord for that reason. The 4th is the sub-dominant. \n\nIn western theory, there is only one dominant chord per key, and that is the 5th. It has a major 3rd and, if you keep stacking 3rds, it also has a flat 7, that sweet bluesy sound. Not coincidentally, the Mixolydian mode also has a major 3rd and a flat 7th, which is why it sounds great over a dominant 7th.\n\nBlues breaks the rules because it often has 3 dominant 7th chords in a row! So theory wise we can treat all 3 chords as the 5. That is why Mixolydian sounds cool in a blues. Blues also breaks the rules because it mixes major and minor tonalities, often in the same phrase. We play minor notes over major chords, etc!\n\nI hope this made sense. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about this shit. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411585192", "subreddit": "bluesguitarist", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, that is correct. When you are breaking into a new cycle, you only solve one piece. Just like how in Old Pochmann when you break into a new cycle you solve no pieces. \n\nI'm just going to assume that you use M2/OP.\n\nAlways remember: one 3cycle = two 2cycles \n\nDoing a 3cycle of corners, for example, has the *exact same effect* as doing two Y perms with Old Pochmann. Put in another way, 3style works in the *exact same way as old pochmann*, except two targets are shot to by one alg.\n\nYou can easily see this. If you use Old Pochmann corners to shoot to two targets, you end up with a 3 cycle. For example: \n\n\n*D* R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R *D'* (shoot to FLD)\n\n*D'* R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R *D* (shoot to BRD)\n\nThis is exactly the same as the 3cycle UBL-&gt;FLD-&gt;BRD that you would use in 3 style [R'UR,D2].\n\nSo say your memo in a solve is ABCD [break into new cycle] EFGE. (Your memo would be the same as if you were doing OP, i.e. break into a new cycle by memoing random unsolved piece and make sure to come back to that piece)\n\nIn OP you'd shoot to A B C D E F G E one-by-one, using a Y perm to shoot to each letter\n\nIn 3style you'd just shoot to AB CD EF GE. Same thing, just one alg shoots to 2 targets.\n\n(When I talk about Old pochmann corners in this post, it could be any 2cycle method: M2/R2/OP edges etc)\n\nYou can also use old pochmann/M2 parity to solve 3 style parity (although there are more advanced methods). At the end of the solve, when your parity method necessitates that you shoot to just one piece (The last \"odd\" piece), you just revert to OP/M2, since you can't just shoot to one piece using 3style.\n\nI hope this helps...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411593307", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The door to my office had been locked for 5 hours now letting no one but my secretary briefly at 2:17pm for the afternoons post and the cleaning lady, who despite my shaking hands and polite dismissal simply just could not leave a room uncleaned. Habit, i guess. Precautions had been made. The gym towel, pulled from out my bag, rolled up, had been laid at the bottom of the door pushed tightly against the small gap beneath to halt any aroma passing under. Air vent was covered completely with an old shirt, stuck on with the tape i had taken from the supply closet on the way into the office. The windows had not been opened since this whole saga began and rubbish bin empty, unused for weeks now and pushed under the desk. The precautions had all been made, now nothing but the usual could be accounted for. \n\nI had not eaten that day, it felt like after last time this was the best thing to do, my stomach rumbled in disagreement. I admit having cheesy beans for a lunch meal if you can even call it a meal, wasn't the best choice when assuming a position of stealth later that evening. How was i to know that just as assuming a position on all fours, crouched over getting so close to the source of the scent that it was going to creep back up on me, or out of me rather and well completely contaminate the room, mission over, aborted. Another chance ruined. \n\nI had showered, clean and kept hydrated throughout the 9-5 day, avoiding any stench of serious body odour, which is quite an impressive feat for those wearing a suit all day in a barely air conditioned office block. It had been several minutes since the clanging of the cleaners keys had echoed down the long corridor, towards the office space of the neighbouring company. Finally, I was alone, secluded in the darkness. \"Friday 26th, this is the one\" i said, it only ever happened on fridays, i knew it just needed to happen once more, this time with my guard up and even if i couldn't prove it to anyone else, i would be sure of my own sanity.\n\nMy anxious head raised ever so slightly with the only tool i had useful, on high alert, twitching and pointing to the mouldy tiles of the ceiling above. A deep inhale flared the nostrils wide taking in the familiar smell of this room. The black hairs that were stuck inside created a maze for the oxygen following the pathway of the nasal passage carrying a slight essence of lemon, the only unusual smell lingering. Given that the mist of odour the cleaner had sprayed into my room after finishing hoovering belonged to a bottle of yellow colour, i felt it was accounted for. I exhaled out my mouth, lips pressed together leaving a small gap for the air to escape. \"I'm not mad, I am not mad\" I mime with my lips, gently whispering the phrase into the empty room, as if trying to convince my conscience that what i'm doing would be considered sane to other people in my position.\n\nSat motionless, i wait, wait for the moment to once again reoccur, wondering if it would be the same as the 3 previous events. My mind wanders as i control my breathing pattern, if there really is the supernatural, if ghostly beings of some kind do exist, why this? Of course the impossible nature of being able to interact through touch, sound, but smell, that has never been discussed and why would it? \n\nThe clocks hand strikes 8pm, i reach into the second draw of my desk. Still the room is motionless. As i struggle to carefully tease the large box out of the draw, I gaze upon every possible gap and entrance convinced that this time, this time there simply was no way exterior interference would get in the way of justification. I placed the box on my desk and closed the draw. A plain black box, not used since i was 17 years old one sleepover with friends at my parents house. Opening it up and letting the dust crawl out after being trapped in the almost air tight space for so long i use my fingers to brush aside the dirty powder left by time to reveal the scattered title \"Yes, No, Ouija, Mystifying Oracle\". It was a long shot i knew and unsure if it even worked with a singular person but heck, it was worth a try. \n\nAfter setting up, my hand slightly shaking rested a single finger upon the pointer with the letter A selected. At first, nothing happened, moments passed and more than anything i felt silly by the whole situation. But then it began, it was happening again. My nosed twitched, the scent of the room was changing, but not yet quite clear and almost in synchronisation with this change my finger started darting around the board uncontrollably, so fast it had taken me by surprise and i could not keep up with what was being spelt. I scribbled down letters P U were the first i was sure, i missed one with the excitement as it darted around to L, M and Y. The smell was becoming stronger, i was sure of a force in the room now, a force trying to communicate with me finally in conversation. The last word was a long and writing down the letters with the pen in my weaker left hand meant i really hadn't manage to catch it all F I N G E.. but the pointer had come to a stop suddenly on the \"Yes\" before i'd caught the last letter. I had barely been looking at the paper so engulfed in the experience of what felt like possession but referred to the scribbled mess beside me. I took a deep breath in as my eyes adjusted to the darkness of the faint letters on the page. Almost suddenly, my gag reflux went into overdrive at the somewhat mouldy cheese, eggy flavour that had run down by nostrils right to the back of my throat. A taste and stench so poignant that it was certain to have derived from something beyond the dead. \"What the hell is that sme..\"\n\nI picked up the paper that my eyes had momentarily left and held it to the desk lamp to see what i had written down to make sense of this obscure moment of seeming madness. I glanced back at the Ouija board, still with the pointer resting on \"Yes\" then back at the poorly jotted down letters on the paper and though unfinished, formed one sentence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"PU..L MY FINGE..\"\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411611113", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The sequence will repeat after 64 numbers.\n\nFor example\n\n* At 20, calculate like this: 20 * 5 = 100; 100+7 = 107; 107 &gt;= 64 so subtract 64, 107-64 = 43; next number is 43\n\nThis particular scheme will work if you replace 7 with _any_ odd constant.  You can also change the power of two to make it a bigger one, e.g., 256.  There are other, better multipliers than 5; for example, 53 and 13 are “good”. The multiplier must satisfy the rule that (m-1)/4 is an integer.  (For a 256 modulus, 115 is a good multiplier.)\n\nIf you read up on LCGs, you can find the rules for the constants and figure out other ones that are relatively easy to do in your head. Many people believe a non-power-of-two is a good idea, and for computing it in your head, it won't make any difference.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411667387", "subreddit": "algorithms", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry for replying so late\n\n- games\n\nI had to state clearly in the post that I was not referring to games (or very, very performance critical apps). My bad.\n\n- mixed solution\n\n    var instance = new Object(required, required, { options });\n\nI don't understand the mixed solution, it's not logical: if having an hash as an argument is an anti-pattern then I shouldn't have an `option` hash argument at all. Otherwise if it's fine to have an hash as an argument, I'd make a step further and have all the arguments in a hash. \n\nThus the logical conclusion is using a tuple (i.e. positional arguments). Good luck with:\n\n    new Person('Giulio', 'Canti', null, null, 40, true);\n\n- `new` operator\n\nIf you don't like optional `new`, use always `new` or don't implement that snippet. Personally I use always `new` because, as someone pointed out, makes more clear in the code the intent of instantiate a new object. However I wanted to show a way to make `new` optional, if someone is fine with that or need it.\n\n- JSON deserialization\n\nObviously the `json` variable contains an object (via JSON.parse). What I'm referring as \"free\" is avoiding to write a `deserialize` function for all your models (and to be clear I write a ton of models in my code, so for me it's a huge benefit). Besides, the generic function `struct` can be easily modified to hydrate arbitrary nested structures (showed in a post a few days ago).\n\n- Positional and named arguments\n\nTheoretically I don't see differences. Tuples and hashes are two ways to express the same concept:\n\n    a cartesian product of sets (A x B x C x ... )\n\nwhere an optional parameter is represented by a set containing `null` and `undefined`:\n\n    optional string = {all the strings} U {null} U {undefined}\n\nIn the case of tuples you access by index, in the case of an hash by name. In math we use always tuples but\nwe have also short definitions. In the real world, when you have to tackle dozens of properties (some of which optionals) and nested structures I prefer hashes. However if you are fine with tuples, go with it.\n\n- Readability\n\nAgree with Bummykins comment\n\n- \"Don't make optional parameters part of your constructor\"\n\nI like to work with immutable objects and usually I add an `Object.freeze` at the end of the constructor to make\nthe object a value object: all the informations must go through the constructor, no setters.\n\n- **Documentation and IDE support**\n\nIn the last code snippet I used an array\n\n    var Person = struct(['name', 'surname']);\n\nto keep the article short, but a better solution would be an hash (again! :) name -&gt; type\n\n    var Person = struct({\n      name: Str,\n      surname: Str\n    });\n\nand then store that hash in such a way that runtime code, documentation tools and IDEs can retrive the meta info, and implement static or runtime type checking.\n\nThis is what the tcomb library is trying to achieve.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411676418", "subreddit": "javascript", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "...I hate people using capital letters for specific numbers rather than sets. Not your fault, it's what you've seen.\n\nSo anyhow, you normally write (n C k)p^(k)q^(n-k) where (n C k) is read \"n choose k\".\n\nAnyhow, in your notation N is not a set, it's a number. If you're wondering what you're looking at though, I can help you.\n\nSay you flip a coin n times: Then you have a string of n characters, each of which is either H (with probability p) or T (with probability 1-p, or q) independent of each other. Further, you know that you have k Heads.\n\nSo if you're looking at (8 C 4), then you have an 8-character string with four heads and four tails. (H H H H T T T T) is one example, as is (H T H T H T H T). Note that how you wrote it, in braces, denotes an unordered set. Parentheses imply that order matters. And there are (8 C 4) different orders: Take 8 slots. Choose 4 of them to put Hs in. Ts fill the rest.\n\n(Side question. For exactly 3 ones, it's (4 C 3)(1/n)^(3)(1 - 1/n)^(1), where you have n sides on the dice. If you allow at least 3 ones, then you need to add the term (1/n)^(4).)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411693437", "subreddit": "learnmath", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

[**Tuning systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning#Tuning_systems) of article  [**Musical tuning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical%20tuning): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; A *tuning system* is the system used to define which [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone), or [pitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music\\)), to use when playing [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music). In other words, it is the choice of number and spacing of [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) values used.\n\n&gt;Due to the [psychoacoustic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics) interaction of tones and [timbres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre), various tone combinations sound more or less \"natural\" in combination with various timbres. For example, using [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music\\)) timbres:\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* A tone caused by a vibration twice the speed of another (the ratio of 1:2) forms the natural sounding [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave).\n\n&gt;* A tone caused by a vibration three times the speed of another (the ratio of 1:3) forms the natural sounding [perfect twelfth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_twelfth), or [perfect fifth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth) (ratio of 2:3) when octave-reduced.\n\n&gt;More complex musical effects can be created through other relationships. \n\n&gt;The creation of a tuning system is complicated because musicians want to make music with more than just a few differing tones. As the number of tones is increased, conflicts arise in how each tone combines with every other. Finding a successful combination of tunings has been the cause of debate, and has led to the creation of many different tuning systems across the world. Each tuning system has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses.\n\n&gt;There are many techniques for theoretical comparison of tunings, usually utilizing mathematical tools such as those of [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) and [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory).\n\n&gt;It is impossible to tune the twelve-note [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) so that all [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music\\)) are \"perfect\". For instance, three \"perfect\" major thirds stack up to 125/64, which at 1158.9411 cents is nearly a quarter tone away from the octave. So there is no way to have both the octave and the major third in just intonation for all the intervals in the same twelve-tone system. Similar issues arise with the fifth 3/2, and the minor third 6/5 or any other choice of harmonic series based \"perfect\" intervals.\n\n&gt;Many different compromise methods are used to deal with this, each with its own characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages.\n\n&gt;The main ones are:\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Just intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation)\n\n&gt;&gt;In just intonation, the frequencies of the scale notes are related to one another by simple numeric ratios, a common example of this being 1:1, 9:8, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 5:3, 15:8, 2:1 to define the ratios for the seven notes in a C major scale. In this example, though many intervals are pure, the interval from D to A (5:3 to 9:8) is 40/27 instead of the expected 3/2. The same issue occurs with most just intonation tunings. This can be dealt with to some extent using alternative pitches for the notes. Even that, however, is only a partial solution, as an example makes clear: If one plays the sequence C G D A E C in just intonation, using the intervals 3/2, 3/4 and 5/4, then the second C in the sequence is higher than the first by a [syntonic comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_comma) of 81/80. This is the infamous [\"comma pump\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_comma#Comma_pump). Each time around the comma pump, the pitch continues to spiral upwards. This shows that it is impossible to keep to any small fixed system of pitches if one wants to stack musical intervals this way. So, even with *adaptive tuning*, the musical context may sometimes require playing musical intervals that are not *perfect*. Instrumentalists with the ability to vary the pitch of their instrument may micro-adjust some of the intervals naturally; there are also systems for adaptive tuning in software ([microtuners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtuner)). Harmonic fragment scales form a rare exception to this issue. In tunings such as 1:1 9:8 5:4 3:2 7:4 2:1, all the pitches are chosen from the harmonic series (divided by powers of 2 to reduce them to the same octave), so all the intervals are related to each other by simple numeric ratios.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Pythagorean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning)\n\n&gt;&gt;A Pythagorean tuning is technically a type of just intonation, in which the frequency ratios of the notes are all derived from the number ratio 3:2. Using this approach for example, the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale would be tuned to the following ratios: 1:1, 256:243, 9:8, 32:27, 81:64, 4:3, 729:512, 3:2, 128:81, 27:16, 16:9, 243:128, 2:1. Also called \"3-limit\" because there are no prime factors other than 2 and 3, this Pythagorean system was of primary importance in Western musical development in the Medieval and Renaissance periods. As with nearly all just intonation systems, it has a [wolf interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_interval). In the example given, it is the interval between the 729:512 and the 256:243 (F# to Db, if one tunes the 1/1 to C). The major and minor thirds are also impure, but at the time when this system was at its zenith, the third was considered a dissonance, so this was of no concern. See also: [Shí-èr-lǜ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C3%AD-%C3%A8r-l%C7%9C).\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Meantone temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meantone_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;A system of tuning that averages out pairs of ratios used for the same interval (such as 9:8 and 10:9). The best known form of this temperament is [quarter-comma meantone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-comma_meantone), which tunes major thirds justly in the ratio of 5:4 and divides them into two whole tones of equal size – this is achieved by flattening the fifths of the Pythagorean system slightly (by a quarter of a syntonic comma). However, the fifth may be flattened to a greater or lesser degree than this and the tuning system retains the essential qualities of meantone temperament. Historical examples include 1/3-comma and 2/7-comma meantone.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Well temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;Any one of a number of systems where the ratios between intervals are unequal, but approximate to ratios used in just intonation. Unlike meantone temperament, the amount of divergence from just ratios varies according to the exact notes being tuned, so that C-E is probably tuned closer to a 5:4 ratio than, say, D♭-F. Because of this, well temperaments have no [wolf intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_interval).\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;The standard twelve-tone equal temperament is a special case of meantone temperament (extended eleventh-comma), in which the twelve notes are separated by [logarithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) equal distances (100 [cents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music\\))): A harmonized C major scale in equal temperament (.ogg format, 96.9KB). This is the most common tuning system used in Western music, and is the standard system used as a basis for [tuning a piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_tuning). Since this scale divides an octave into twelve equal-ratio steps and an octave has a frequency ratio of two, the frequency ratio between adjacent notes is then the [twelfth root of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_root_of_two), 2^1/12, or ~1.05946309.... However, the octave can be divided into other than 12 equal divisions, some of which may be more harmonically pleasing as far as thirds and sixths are concerned, such as [19 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament) (extended third-comma meantone), [31 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament) (extended quarter-comma meantone) and [53 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53_equal_temperament) (extended Pythagorean tuning).\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Syntonic temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;A tuning system that subsumes the Pythagorean and meantone tuning systems, and many of the equal temperament tuning systems.  For example, of the [regular temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_temperament), \"equal temperament\" is the syntonic tuning, in which the tempered perfect fifth (P5) is 700 cents wide; 1/4-comma meantone is the syntonic tuning, in which the P5 is 696.6 cents wide; Pythagorean tuning is the syntonic tuning in which the P5 is 702 cents wide; 5-equal is the syntonic tuning, in which the P5 is 720 cents wide; and 7-equal is the tuning in which the P5 is 686 cents wide. All these syntonic tunings have identical fingering on an [isomorphic keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard).  So do many irregular tunings such as well temperaments and Just Intonation tunings. \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* Tempered timbres\n\n&gt;&gt;A timbre's partials (also known as harmonics or overtones) can be tempered such that each of the timbre's partials aligns with a note of a given tempered tuning. This alignment of tuning and timbre is a key component in the perception of consonance,  of which one notable example is the alignment between the partials of a harmonic timbre and a just intonation tuning. Hence, using tempered timbres, one can achieve a degree of consonance, in any tempered tuning, that is comparable to the consonance achieved by the combination of just intonation tuning and harmonic timbres. Tempering timbres in real time, to match a tuning that can change smoothly in real time, using the tuning-invariant fingering of an [isomorphic keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard), is a central component of [dynamic tonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_tonality) (*ibid*., Milne et al., 2009).\n\n&gt;Tuning systems that are not produced with exclusively just intervals are usually referred to as *[temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament)*.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* Natural overtone scale, a scale derived from the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music\\)).\n\n&gt;* [Slendro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slendro), a [pentatonic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale) used in [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia) music.\n\n&gt;* [Pelog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelog), the other main gamelan scale.\n\n&gt;* [43-tone scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Partch%27s_43-tone_scale), created by [Harry Partch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Partch), an American [composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer).\n\n&gt;* [Bohlen–Pierce scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohlen%E2%80%93Pierce_scale)\n\n&gt;* [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_scale), [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_scale), [delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_scale), and [gamma scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_scale) of [Wendy Carlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Carlos).\n\n&gt;* [Quarter tone scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_tone_scale).\n\n&gt;* [Thirteenth Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Sound)\n\n&gt;* [19 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament)\n\n&gt;* [22 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_equal_temperament)\n\n&gt;* [31 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament)\n\n&gt;* [53 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53_equal_temperament)\n\n&gt;* [Schismatic temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schismatic_temperament)\n\n&gt;* [Miracle temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_temperament)\n\n&gt;* [Hexany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexany)\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Musical ^temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament) ^| [^Just ^intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation) ^| [^Equal ^temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) ^| [^Syntonic ^temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_temperament) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckteoyl) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ckteoyl)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411763546", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok. So lets put that into this theme: Harmony.\n\nHarmony is important becuase this is when you aren't just working on a craft, but you are learning a language, so approach it in 2 ways. Building vocabulary and increasing grammar or harmonic language.\n\nVocabulary - learn new stuff\n\nLearn new chords and chord voicings. [Use this chord generator](http://guitar.to/folder/guitar.html) Learning a new chord is a click away. Just make sure you can make each note clear before moving on yada yada yada.\n\n\nGrammar - what's in stuff and why stuff works.\n\nAs you learn new chords, get familiar with the major scale and convert the notes to scale degrees (numbers 1 to 7 with the root being 1)\n\n* C D E F G A B makes a C major scale\n\n* 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  are the scale degrees, so a C major chord (C,E,G) contains 1,3, and 5.\n\nSometimes there are numbers in chords to give you more information about the chord quality.\n\n* Major 7 chords contain the 1,3,5, and 7. (C,E,G,B)\n\n* any nuber in a chord more than 7? Don't know what that means? Just subtract 7 and \nthat's the note they want you to add. That \"C (add 11)\" chord? 11-7=4. Add an F to the C Major chord\n\nFinally, as you learn more about the grammar and new vocab, start dissecting your favorite songs and see why its so awesome to go from B minor 7 to G13 (or whatever your favorite chord progression is)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411780744", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Starting a new comment for what might lead to the solution.  I believe the solution lies with [nim multiplication](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/2125).  Hopefully this lets you decide 8x8 by computing the nim value of 8x1 and nim-squaring it.  It's not too difficult to show by case analysis that Player 2 wins 8x1, so its nim-value is 0.  So this would suggest Player 2 wins 8x8.\n\nAlthough this is by no means a guaranteed winning strategy, the following might work:\n\n* Find a winning strategy for Player 2 on 8x1.  \n* For each play of Player 1, respond in the *same column* with the 8x1 strategy.\n\nYou just need to show that even with \"unavailable\" squares in the column, there will always be an appropriate response.\n\nNote that this \"strategy\" can be used to show Player 2 wins every 4xn board.\n\n**Edit**: Ok, so I believe this strategy works for Player 2 to win on an 8xn board (and is easily generalized to a (4m)xn board):  \n\n* Label the rows, in order, A a B b a A b B  \n* Every time Player 1 plays, Player 2's response is in the same column and on the row of the capitalized letter of Player 1's row (e.g. if Player 1 plays in a row labelled a, Player 2 plays in a row labelled A). Note that one capitalized row option will be eliminated by Player 1's play, so there is a unique response for Player 2.\n\nI'll leave the proof of the correctness of this strategy as an exercise.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411874571", "subreddit": "math", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You were taught to do it backwards, amd add things like say 1 to 86. The way you were taught it gives you this ability. You probably could have been taught the alphabet the same way, but why? It's mostly useless, and if for some reason you need to use alphabetical order every two seconds for a job or something, you'd learn it in an hour or two anways.

{"body": "Oh boy, this is one I've got a bunch of nominees for!\n\nAs far as indie goes, one I barely see mentioned at all would have to be the brilliant debut-album **Gist Is**, by the band **Adult Jazz.** It's a phenomenal indie-pop record with influences coming from all over the place, with a bit of jazz, a bit of indie, a bit of folk, and even a bit of math-rock at a part in Pigeon Skulls (or atleast I think it's that track). Probably my favorite indie-release so far. They sound a bit like Alt-J, mainly because of the singer Harry Burgess nasal voice. Here's **[Spook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMbkn0R-Jw)**, my favorite track, and [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2I9OzYfk0) the full album on youtube.\n\nThen there's **[Fuck Off Get Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfPXY6mtq4U)** by Efrim Menuck of Godspeed You! Black Emperor's side project **A Silver Mt Zion**. It's without a doubt one of the best albums this band has put out, and it's a much more eventful album than other Gy!Be releases. Highly recommend to both those of you who already are fans of Gy!be, and also to those of you who haven't been able to get into them.\n\nAnd then we have the new **Kishi Bashi** record, that I think is a bit more well known but one that I rarely see mentioned on this sub. It's called **Lighght** and I'd argue that it's a monumental step up from his debut **151a** which was a pretty boring record outside of a few great singles. Not only does Lighgt flow better as an album, but there are also a bunch more memorable tracks like, **[Carry On Phenomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJj0ZEDWcsY), [The Ballad Of Mr Steak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDiv7VGY4Pw)**, and **[Philosophize In It! Chemicalize In It!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZutRhiFmHM)**. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a catchy, fun, indie-pop record from this year.\n\nBut that's just the indie-part of this year, there's ton of other great lesser known albums. The new **[B L A C K I E](http://blackieallcapswithspaces.bandcamp.com/album/imagine-your-self-in-a-free-and-natural-world-2014)** record is one of my biggest surprises for instance. It's a chaotic free-jazz influenced record by a guy who's been compared to Death Grips for a bunch of years now. \n\nThere's the fantastic **[Bon Voyage](http://sport.bandcamp.com/)** by punk/emo/hardcore band **Sport**. I'd call them a less lo-fi Cap'n Jazz with a bigger hardcore vibe and a lot more screamed out vocals. I love the melodic guitars on this one.\n\nThere's the sophomore relase from **[Modern Baseball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne-YkM0ozgk)** which I think is an improvement on their debut, but that just seems to be me. Your Graduation however is a fantastic track and will probably be one my favorite tracks of 2014 when we reach December. \n\nThere's stuff like **WLFGRL** by **Machine Girl** which is a fantastic break-beat album for those of you into Venetian Snares, there's **Melting Sun** by **Lantlôs** which is kind of reminiscent of last year's Sunbather, and there's **So It Goes** by **Ratking** which is one of my favorite release as far as hiphop goes this year.\n\nAnd that's just scratching the surface, there's tons of great albums out there if you know where to look! Most of these are still well-known enough to have gotten positive reviews by p4k and TheNeedleDrop, a positive metascore, or reached the top 50 of other review-sites. There's even more in share-threads on /mu/ or places like this thread.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411934026", "subreddit": "indieheads", "score": 26, "controversiality": 0}

In your case;\n\nG Major is: G A B C D E F#\nAnd G Lydian is: G A B C# D E F#\n\nSo your G Lydian scale is actually a D major scale (same accidentals) that happens to start from G (instead of D).\n\nAnd the major scale has the greatest pull. What I want to tell you is that if you are not careful, using the above G Lydian pitches, your chords might take you to D Major; which might not be what you want. While trying out chord progressions with the G Lydian pitches, some progressions will pull you strongly to D Major, and you should be mindful of that.\n\nImagine D major as the huge sun that pulls everything towards itself, but you want to use one of the modes derived from its pitches, namely the G Lydian mode and hang around there. If you don't pay attention, the D Major can pull you onto itself without you noticing how you managed to get there (for instance, try Em, A, then D; wow you are magically (almost) in D major). If you want to stay around the Lydian sonority, make sure you perceptually keep your root note as G and not something else.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1411938253", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

I know that a certain subculture uses quotation marks in that case, others use t h i s (relics from the typewriter era), others capitals. It is actually an interesting topic.

Could aswell be glass or air or 'A'nnything, realy.

Why is the rest set? Because of how radiation works. It travels a max of 4 blocks. If it hits the casing, radiation is turned into heat. A higher temperature increases fuel burnup and in turn reduces fuel efficiency. Gelid Cryotheum has the highest efficiency. Meaning youll want the most of your absorbing to be done by cryotheum. Resonant ender, however, has a higher value for absorbtion*efficiency. Making it perfect for the last spot. Where its the last chance to absorb radiation annyway.\n\nWhy do I mention this? Well, because I think making an algorithm for the center core (the X's) would be very interesting! I have no clue how to do that myself though...\n\nIncase your curious, I got quite an extensive [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1df7-8OqdOeWppfr1xZsV5eFqBWUeGGvtyQ6e1agJN2s/edit?usp=sharing). \n\nFor a 15x15x7 reactor I got a design with: Efficiency = 137500 RF/mB, output = 24200 RF/t, NR Rods = 105, NR Colomns = 21.

I will just use the other to get back on the boat, so I haul myself back to the boat, put my arm up on the footsteps, and j u s t when I put all my weight on that arm to get up, the wind changes and sends the boat speeding forward, tearing up my good arm on the grip tape you normally stand on, and twists the rope around my arm so, yeah you guessed it, the rope tightens around my, now totally ripped, arm.

{"body": "Disclaimer: I'm only about half finished with this game.\n\nLana, the bad:\n\nI can't stand the character because her appearance and mannerisms match that of your standard JRPG kawaii girl trope. (Why are you always winking?! Are you having a fucking stroke?) Those characters usually warrant little more than eye rolling and quiet tutting when they show up in other Japanese games, but that's because they kind of come with the territory in most JRPGs. If this were a Final Fantasy game she'd have probably been fine, but against the backdrop of LoZ where those sorts of female characters tend to be the exception rather than the rule magnifies all of her tropy traits to the point in which they're almost unbearable. Apart from the character itself, her spellbook move set is strange and can be very frustrating. When I was first forced to use her it seemed like I couldn't get consistent results from most of her combos. Sometimes a set of walls would appear then fly forward into a clump of enemies either killing them or at least knocking them a considerable distance, but more often than not they'd just stand there for a moment before evaporating for no apparent reason. At no point in the first battle did I figure out exactly what contexts the various combos needed to be used in to get them to actually work all of the time and this being a Dynasty Warriors game, the only instructions you're gonna get are along the lines of \"hit A A B B B!\" I'm sure that within a week or two there will be comprehensive guides which will outline exactly how all of her moves work, but at the time nothing of that sort was to be found. (Regrettably, I'm sure that many of those guides will come complete with a little treatise about how she's just the best and cutest character \"evar\" and that people like me who don't like her are somehow mentally, morally, and genetically deficient. Oh well.)\n\nLana, the good:\n\nIt took me a while, but I more or less figured out how to pull off her spellbook combos. I still occasionally summon a bunch of giant walls or books (or whatever) only to have them disappear without doing anything, but for the most part I am able to get them to work and they do dish out excellent AoE and ranged damage. After her first mission she gets a \"Deku Spear\" which seems less powerful than the spellbook (or at least it does after you've upgraded the spellbook a little) but is much faster and more forgiving in close combat. After a while she stopped talking so much and I was able to tune out her various prancing animations and hyper-girly gurgles enough that she was more or less tolerable to play with. \n\nThe bottom line for me is this: she doesn't feel right in a LoZ game, but once you get over the initial annoyance of having some kind of lolicon fantasy character traipsing through Hyrule and figure out her somewhat confusing combo tree she is fairly useful.

{"body": "Okay I'll try to sum up \"following the chord changes\" as simply as possible.\nBasically you have a set of changes lets just make them really simple..one measure of G..one measure of C..and one measure of G\nSo now you say okay we gave a G triad (triad is just three notes) so you think okay heres my G scale.. G A B C D E F# G.. and find the 1st 3rd and 5th note of the scale because those are the notes that make up a triad. So now you have G B D. So you do the same for your C scale and end up with C E G. Now those are your chord tones and are \"key notes\" you wanna hit. So you throw on a backing track and when the rythm section is playing the G chord you use your notes that you figured out to be in said chord. So we are using G B D. Also you can use any other notes from that G scale which would be known as passing tones. And of course you could technically play whatever you want but some notes sound better or worse than others and that's when using your ear comes into play. So now the rhythm section switches to the C chord and you switch your set of notes to ones in the key of C highlighting your chord tones which are C E G. So in real terms you would have a chord progression with a whole bunch of chords and you would just play notes in those chords while the rhythm section plays those chords.

Maybe this will help you out:\nDorian works great over a ii V I because it is entirely en-harmonic (from the key).\n\nLet's say we are in the key of C. You see a ii V I (Dm7 G7 Cmaj) and decide to play D dorian. That scale has D E F G A B C in it - the same notes as C ionian (a C major scale). You haven't actually switched scales if you've been playing in C already! In fact when it hits the V chord you have played mixolydian, and when it his the I you'll be playing ionian - without changing scales. When the tune goes to the Em you are playing phyrigian, etc... This is without deviating from a C major scale!\n\nNow, the application of a C major scale over the various chords in C is essentially practicing modes - each has it's own melodic context and should be practiced individually and within the context of a progression.\n\nWhen a progression deviates from an en-harmonic chord structure (chords are no longer in the key of the tune), the first step is identifying which key center is being used, even if is for one chord or a series of chords. You are correct - very often they will be ii V I's in new keys, but often they are not. They may be iim7b5 V7b9's of minor keys, or secondary dominants of others, etc. But the first step is FIND THE KEY CENTER.
