A R C A N A B O Y S\n\n***[Rave(68%)]*** vs. MVP.H6 \n\n* Rave won most recent matchup 2-1 2~ weeks ago, has overall games and series advantage 2-0-1(4-2)\n* Rave should take this, odds are closer to 75/25 imo. I feel confident enough to place a large bet on them since its bo3. Hotsix might take a game off of them, but Rave should take 2/3.\n\nMonkey Spanner vs. ***[PokerFace(71%)]***\n\n* Monkey spanner is complete ass. I'm surprised odds are this favorable in a bo3. I'd expect more along the lines of 20/80. \n* Mksp is one of the better t2 korean teams, but still PokerFace is way better than they are. If they lost this bo3 I'd be pretty shocked.\n\nZephyr vs. ***[Rave(70%)]***\n\n* Odds are closer to 20/80 or higher even maybe. ZephyR recently lost mr sexy bamboe and are playing with purge again. This lineup is just lackluster at the moment. \n\n* \"Rave is so hot right now.\" - Mr. Mugatu\n\n***[Fnatic(67%)]*** vs. Power Rangers\n\n* Fnatic looked pretty damn impressive today despite throwing a completely won game against VP. PR looked pretty bad as of late, but can definitely win this series. If fnatic goes over 75%, switch to PR.\n\n***[Empire(71%)]*** vs. Aftershock\n\n* Why does aftershock deserve 30% against arguably a top 10 team? Can someone enlighten me?\n\n***[Virtus.Pro(60%)]*** vs. Kompas Gaming\n\n* These odds are kind of whack. KPG should be 30% or lower imo. Sure they're capable of beating a top tier team, but they don't deserve 40%...\n\n***[Virtus.Pro]*** vs. Empire(57%)\n\n* Empire historically has VP's number and odds are quite favorable. VP has been playing well but so has Empire for the most part. At least since they kicked mag. *UPDATE EDIT* Switching to VP, knowing that Empire is still playing with Mag and is missing one of their other players.\n\n***[Virtus.Pro.Polar(52%)]*** vs Fnatic\n\n* Fnatic still getting used to playing with each other, and this is so close to 50/50? I'll take VP.P here. \n\nShadows of the Past vs. ***[compLexity(55%)]***\n\n* Complexity has shown decent games recently, specifically the series vs SNA.They probably should be favored, but how much? I'd guess 40/60. I might just abstain this one since they're lower tier teams and I'm not confident in their consistency. \n\nGood luck everyone!\n\nswitched to VP&gt;EMPIRE!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412135315", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I didn’t watch the whole video. \n\nI didn’t have to. The pertinent information the producer is trying to convey is right up front. People are spending money to support the development of a game.\n\nThere is only one thing wrong with this.\n\nWhen Chris Roberts expresses a need for capital for development, those who are in the game playing community and are interested in such a game should provide it, with no expectation other than the finished game itself (and maybe a few physical nick nacks such as dog tags etc). \n\nUnfortunately CR is not selling just the game, he is selling game elements. He can try and label it anything he wishes, but it still will give an initial advantage to some players over others (particularly before the PU comes out - could be many years). We don’t know how long it will take to earn a ship such as an Idris, it could very well be years (also think about the availability of different ships even for people with ready credits – there could be bidding wars, with many left out).  All that circulates is rumor about time to earn a constellation.  A week... Is that 168 hours of playing time, or the 21 hours (3 hrs/day) that is actually pretty hard to slip into a real life. Even the term “A week” isn’t heard that often anymore, could it have increased?\n\nIf CIG had better intentions, they would sell nothing more usable within the in game universe than ship skins (and other visual only analogues).  \n\nP E R I O D .\n\nBut they don’t. They sell equipment that is usable (or sometimes not usable – which leads to other complaints), and they let peoples imagination run wild with the possible ‘things they can do’ (and that statement is important) with their virtual belongings. No matter what importance (or lack thereof) CIG give the items, it will always be human nature to ascribe value to items that others say have none. The easy analogy to this is art, eye of the beholder and all that. But this art (game ships) do more than just sit on the wall, and therein lies the problem.\n\nI’m fairly certain that CIG would not have risen *nearly* as much funding as they did, if they only sold $250 t-shirts with the proceeds going towards development.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412148414", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In a bit more detail, consider (as usual) the simplest example of the C major scale. The notes are:  \nC D E F G A B (C D E F ...)\n\nWhen we make basic chords, we make triads; we take three notes, leaving one in between each. That gives us the following chords:\n\n* C E G\n* D F A\n* E G B\n* F A C\n* G B D\n* A C E\n* B D F\n\nAll that remains is then to figure out what kinds of chords these are. (All have the first note as the root, so we have some C chord, some D chord an so on.)\n\nAs mentioned by Benjabenja, the chords are, in order: major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminshed. (When the scale you're in is a *major* scale.)\n\nThe reason for this is the intervals between the notes. C to E is a 4 semitone distance (C#, D, D#, E), while D to F is only 3 semitones (D#, E, F), for example. 4 semitones is a major third, while 3 semitones is a *minor* third.\n\nSo all in all, you find: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim.  \nThe way I remember this is that the I, IV and V chords are major (easy to remember since I-IV-V is so common), the vii chord diminished, and the rest minor.\n\nIf you do this in a natural minor key, you get a different set of chords (i: minor, ii: dim, III: major, iv: minor, v: minor, VI: major, VI: major).  \nIn harmonic minor, you get yet another set, and so on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412260260", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Quitting can be really hard, it's not easy for me. It's one of those things that you need to commit to 100% - just throw yourself into it - in order to succeed. To use an analogy, when I'm playing rugby I've always known that the way not to get hurt is to commit to the tackle 100%, and to throw away my fear. It sounds counterintuitive but if you don't, that split second of hesitation puts the other man that little inch in front, and he's running that fraction of a second faster, which equals me getting knocked on my ass. It's been the same for me quitting. I tried once, and failed, because I didn't throw away my bong because it cost me a lot of money. That made it that little bit easier to go back. I didn't stop hanging out with people who expose me to it either. It probably seems like a weird analogy but if you don't go in as hard as you can then your chances of success are lowered. Don't participate, even though there is pressure to do so. If you really want to quit, throw out your fear and drop e v e r y t h i n g that you associate with weed.

You are making this a LOT more difficult than it needs to be - and I can tell you're missing some key observations in the process, like the fact that 'C' is the third scale degree of the Ab Major (a flat), not A Major (a sharp scale), which is why we see flats in C Phrygian rather than sharps. \n\nHere's a helpful little \"guide\" to modes that I really enjoyed.

For me this is just unbelievable, a historical document and an impressive testimonial against war. \n\n&gt; Historic Stereo-Recording from 1944 with Walter Gieseking as soloist and Arthur Rother and the Großes Berliner Rundfunkorchester. 2009 we can celebrate the 65th anniversary of stereophonic tape recordings. So I thought it might be interesting to upload a few recordings that Mr. Helmut Krüger made at the RRG in Berlin in the early 40´s with the AEG-Telefunken K7 stereo tape recoder (Krüger was nicknamed by his radio colleagues Krüger-Krüger, in witty reference to his habit to record everything in stereo). \nAfter the soviets brought the complete RGG-archive to Moscow in 1945 unfortunately from the hundreds of Stereo recordings only a handful found their way back to Berlin. And in a very bad condition. \nThe over 60 years old tape was transfered directly to digital equipment w i t h o u t any processing.

{"body": "[Watch and admire Leonard Bernstein's wonderful description](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt2zubHcER4)\n\n\nWestern music is made of super-tonic intervals (twice the frequency of a pitch) and very concordant middle notes, called dominants (3/2 the frequency).  \n\nIf you had a harp string, it would play really well against a harp string of similar pitch, or one half the length.\n\nBut there's a middle string at 3/2 which also combines really well.\n\nBut hey, that note that is dominant to a tonic could be it's own tonic in its own sequence of tonic, super-tonic and have its own dominant.\n\nFractions of these notes work against the original tone as well.  sub-tonic or sub-dominant.  twice or 3/2 the length.\n\n1. So you have a note.  Call it a tonic (do)\n\n2. Go up to most concordant note,  supertonic (do').  \n\n3. Make a dominant note over the tonic (so)\n\n4. Make a sub-dominant below the tonic (fa)\n\n5. Go a dominant over a dominant (re)\n\n6. Do a dominant-dominant-dominant to get la', so do a sub-tonic of that to get la\n\nso there's these 5 distinct notes in increasing pitch  do-fa-so-do'-re-la-do''\n\nYou could do super and sub tonics of each of these.  I mean, make a bunch of re's and la's and so's  \n\nBy earballing\n\ndo, sub-re, sub-fa, so, la, do', re, fa, so', la', do''\n\nso, really there's this language of 5 notes and their super and subtonics.  do, re, fa, so, la do'\n\nHey, guess what, this 5 note scale is called a pentatonic.  It's not THE pentatonic.  Ever look at the circle of fifths?  Let's call it a circle of dominants.  and 5 notes in a row make up a pentatonic (f c g d a -&gt; a c d f g) \n\nThese notes aren't evenly spaced.  Someone could find in-between notes by listening to hear similar gaps.\n\nSo a bunch of people sing and make instruments based on this pentatonic scale.  They find there's more magical notes in those gaps.  If you made a pentatonic scale based on each of those notes, you'd find 8 distinct notes to make an (bam!) an octave.  If you made octaves with those 8 notes, you would flesh out a language of 12 notes.  Or you would find some stray notes REALLY close to each other to sound the same, but sound weird together.  This is where the tempering type comes in.  Western musicians chose to stick with the 8 notes (a-b-c-d-e-f-g) and space them with those in-between notes.  If you did the dominant-subdominant magic on a particular note, like a, then a g scale would have notes that line up, but some sound horrible.  That's because the spacing isn't 12 perfect gaps between the tonics.  to compromise,  instruments do just that, make 12 notes equally spaced.  There's deviation, but it makes it easier to play an 8 note scale starting with any note and the gaps being even.\n\nWhen starting to write down music and play together, they people decided a certain A should have a certain pitch (440Hz).  \n\nTL;DR, western musicians over time realized there are natural-sounding tones between a tonic and supertonic.  Through trial and error, they worked it into a nice-sounding 8-note scale based on 12 even divisions. \n\nOK, I'm tired.  The 5th step in an 8-note scale is the dominant, the 4th is called the sub-dominant not because it's below the dominant, but because it's a dominant below the tonic.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412471418", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

However, I would still appreciate it if you could read through it and clarify the questions I have contained within the text.\n\n\nHey dude! Thanks for the response.\n\nI am still getting confused however. Do you think you could help walk me through a solve? \n\nI am using the scramble R2 U L D B for simplicity (same orientation as the one in the tutorial I linked)\n\nSo I start by examing A. I see that it is an orange sticker that points to N. This piece is also the buffer piece itself. I shoot the piece to L. However, am I supposed to shoot the piece to L because the sticker at A points to a piece in the buffer area, or because the piece itself is the orange, black, green piece? \n\nRegardless, I shoot to L. Examing L, I see it points to W. Examing W yields F. Examing F yields L. What do I do here now? The orange green black piece is in that spot. I think I still shoot it there, then find another chain, but I am unsure.\n\nGoing under my previous hypothesis, I am going to shoot to L then start a new chain. I start by examing B, which points to M. This is a twisted piece. I shoot back to J to fix the twist.\n\nNow I start another cycle (I believe there are unsolved pieces).\n\nThe top front left piece is also twisted. I untwist it with D, R.\n\nThe bottom left front piece is also twisted. I untwist it with H, S.\n\nThe bottom left back piece is also twisted. I untwist it with T, O.\n\nAm I done at this point? What do I do for the top back left piece? Will the buffer automatically go there? I am really confused about interactions with the buffer piece.\n\n\nEDIT 2: I just tried this scramble: U2 R2 D2 L D R F' \n\nThis was my move pattern: M U L F V Z W \n\nI ended up with 2 pieces not swapped (an O move), but I thought I covered everything.

But I don't think that's going to make a very big difference, it's just going to take lots of time practicing to really internalize the scales.\n\nOne exercise I like to do to internalize this sort of thing is to pick some kind of continuous pattern and play it over the changing chords/scales. For example, say you just do an ascending scale over Dm7b5 (F melodic minor) - G7alt (Ab melodic minor) - Cm (C melodic minor):\n\n          Dm7b5       |       G7alt          | Cm\n\n    C D E F G Ab Bb C  Db Eb F G Ab Bb Cb Db   Eb F G A B C D Eb\n\nThe idea is that you keep the interval pattern going continuously, while adjusting the notes to match the changing harmonies. You can do more complex patterns, like this (descending):\n\n          Dm7b5       |       G7alt          | Cm\n\n    G E C Ab F D Bb G  Eb Cb Ab F Db Bb G Eb   C A F D B G Eb C\n\nThose were all just continuous streams of notes, but you could add rhythms in too.

I really like the G G F F C format they are going for, not the traditional PG SG SF PF C (then again I do not believe in traditional positions). They also need a elite rim protecter and a elite wing defender. In my belief, you need one each to be a real championship team. Bledsoe can guard any guard in the league, but they need a proven BIG wing to guard Lebron and Durant. They have young guys you can be those elite defenders which is something to be excited for. I really like where they are taking the team with this positionless approach (which more team are doing, or going to be doing) and run-and-gun mentality.

{"body": "Ok, so, to be totally honest, I don't think any of my conlangs are developed enough to really use for communication (mostly in the areas of vocabulary and derivational processes, as they are all functional and relatively complete from a grammatical standpoint). At this point, my most fleshed out conlang is Hhotakotí. Although I don't think it's ready to be spoken *just yet*, consider this somewhat of a preview to see if it sounds interesting at all.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Phonology**\n\nHhotakotí's phonology is relatively simple, with a fairly average sized inventory of 24 phonemes and all (C)V syllables. It has four contrasting oral vowels /i u a ɒ/ and four nasal vowels /ĩ ũ ã ɒ̃/. It has a voicing contrast on it's obstruents, but no nasal contrast (though nasals occur as allophones of the voiced stops before nasal vowels). It's consonant inventory is as follows: \n\n/p b t d k g/\n\n/ts s z ç ʝ ħ h/\n\n/l j w/\n\nStress is phonemic in Hhotakotí, and a stressed syllable can have one of two tones, high or low.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Grammar**\n\nHhotakotí is agglutinating, highly synthetic and almost exclusively suffixing. Verbs are conjugated for person, tense, aspect, negativity, and evidentially, with evidentially also conveying much of what mood does in European languages (leading me to calling the category *Evidentially-Mood* in my grammar).\n\nThe language has 10 cases, indicated with post-particles. It has an active-stative fluid-S morphosyntactic alignment, meaning in the argument of an intransitive verb may be marked like ether an agent or a patient depending on the volitionality of a particularly action.\n\nNouns have less complex morphology. A noun can take a \"qualifying\" affix, which can indicate possession, definiteness or acts as an interrogative (\"what thing\") or demonstrative (\"this thing\").\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nObviously, this is just an overview, but if you're interested I'll post my grammar somewhere (I'm not really sure *how* to do that, but whatever).\n\n**Examples**\n\n**Jancuzílin tsi zi tsohhíihhaihha Hhotakotíkitsau san?**\n\n/ʝãçuˈzílĩ tsi zi tsɒˈħíiħaiħa ħɒtakɒˈtíkitsau sã/\n\n[ʝãxʷuˈʑílĩ tɕi ʑi tsɒˈħíiħɑi̯ħɑ ħɒtakɒˈtícitsau̯ sã]\n\n    Jan-cuzí-lin tsi zi  tsohhí-ihhai-hha Hhotakotí-kitsau   san\n    want-INT-2   2   ACT know-FUT-NMZ     Hhotakotí-language INACT\n\n*Do you what to learn the Hhotakotí language?*\n\n**Ùbiduntsainyo pahhukíhhu zi puàuzunwaban hhu co tsan Hhotakotí zi páwugu ya ba jau basáiku gítsu ba san.**\n\n    Ùbi-dun-tsain-yo pahhukí-hhu zi  puàu-zun-waban  hhu co  tsan Hhotakotí zi  páwu-gu        ya  ba  jau basáiku gítsu ba  san\n    say-HSY-PST-3    person-old  ACT sing-RES-3.POSS old LOC be   Hhotakotí ACT brother-sister dog GEN COM child   fish  GEN INACT\n\nThis is from the as yet incomplete Hhotakotí origin story, and means, roughly:\n\n*I've heard that the elders, in their old songs, say that the Hhotakotí are the children of the fish and the brothers and sisters of the dogs.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412553288", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The Romance languages are what is called a [dialect continuum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum). This is actually quite common throughout the world with related languages. What this means is that you have a series of languages, which for this example we'll label with letters *A B C D* and so on.\n\nIn a dialect continuum, speakers of A can understand speakers of B, and have a slightly more difficult time understanding *C* speakers. C speakers meanwhile understand D, but may not be able to understand *F* and *G* speakers all that well. Meanwhile a speaker of language A may have no hope at all of understanding *G*.\n\nWhat happened in the Iberian Peninsula is you had this sort of *A B C D E F G H I* gradual shift from dialect to dialect, but then over time as nations and borders changed, one country ended up ruled by *A* speakers while the neighbouring country became officially *D* speaking, and the next modern country over became *I* speakers, usually as a result of that being the language of the rulers when things were taking shape. You can imagine *A* as representing modern European Portuguese, *D* as Castillian Spanish and *I* as Parisian French, with Catalan and Occitan being *F-G*.\n\nThis is of course a simplification. There are other factors in this kind of situation. For example if a language displaces another, the earlier language in the area may have influence as a [substratum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_\\(linguistics\\)). Additionally there are things like [language contact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_contact) which have a similar effect. This can explain a lot of discrepancies that aren't really addressed by the continuum situation, for example the [spread of certain pronunciations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttural_R) between language families.\n\nedit: If this sort of thing interests you, head on over to /r/linguistics and you'll find a lot of related discussions", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412645684", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

Ryze has no skillshots and doesn't require amazing cooldown management, you just go into a fight and hit Q E R W and mash your hand on qweqeqweqweqweqweqweqewq while running around afterwards. \n\nThe thing about draven that makes him difficult is axe management, he has to run around and catch his axes to do large damage. He also has a like of escapes, he has good peel and his W is good for dodging skillshots, but he doesn't have any blink or dash spells as a mid-range adc who is squishy, ryze is not squishy. \n\nI don't think my previous comment deserved to be downvoted (assuming you are the one who did it) because of disagreements with my views on ryze. I clearly stated what could have been done better and how it wasn't precise calculations, it was just a challenger playing ryze, which is quite clear.

{"body": "\n**Part 3:** Now its time to get into things (take my puns as you will ;P)\n\nAlso the longest in depth part (again sorry XD)\n\nWhat i want you to do is go buy a [peach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19McuaPKjI8), pear, or plum (Peaches and plums work best but if you don't like them hopefully you like pears as i feel their shape is ideal as well, apples don't quite cut it).\n\nfind the little crease it has and go in as if you were going to eat from that spot.\n\nyour lips should wrap around it and your tongue should begin to make soft contact.\nnow take a bite and notice how you try your best to suck up the juices and move the piece you bit off into your mouth. (we **aren't** biting the vagina just stay with me)\n\n\nthis crease can be treated like that of the vagina, your lips go around it softly (not engulfing her outer labia just resting on them accommodating her size) your tongue will then move within your lips, gently sucking at it to create pressure. Like how you move the piece into your mouth i want you to use that pressure when moving around her inner labia and such. sucking up the juices feels good to her just dont slurp! (try to keep the noises to a minimum when you start to get her there she doesn't want it spoiled by a terribly funny noise!)\n\n\nEating a lady out is fun and a form of creativity, I like to imagine how it would feel or where i might find more sensitive nerves and muscles.\n\nHer clit is where its going to feel great but try to figure out just how much pressure and attention she wants there, **also DON'T start there!** after reading this and applying it I think you will begin to understand what i mean, its not bad its just there is another way to start it out to get a better ending.\n\n\nNow that we got those out of the way some pointers and good examples of things to try.\n\nLearning to love eating a girl out and desiring to be good at it are going to get you half way there, the other half is learned good movements and listening to her body.\n\nEvery time i think of going down, I salivate in the same way as when someone offers me some sour skittles. this salivation makes everything great for the lady, my mouth never goes dry and she gets the perfect smooth tongue (no dry cat like tongue! avoid that like the plague!)\n\nthe key about salivation however is to allow yourself you do it in spurts hold it in your mouth and allow it to flow when you feel its getting a bit dry as you move, you want to moisten her along with her fluids not flood the gates! getting it all over wet can be uncomfortable for some woman so choose an amount of wetness and after you finish feel free to later ask her if it wasn't tooo wet, if it starts to go down her ass she may get distracted and feel gross you want to avoid this of course. keep in mind also that if she is standing and your on your knees or she is sitting on your face or 69-ing with you feel free to messier as the fluids are able to spread out more and get away from her ass and drenching the sheets under her.\n\nThe entire vagina is sensative and welcomes your tongue, around the outter labia, between the labia pairs, around the clitoral hood, down the urethra, and along the fourchette (that bottom \"lip\" of the opening of the vagina)\n\nlearning to navigate it smoothly and with varying pressure allowing your self to stop and suck on her is a good way to warm her up.\n\nother fun ways to really get her going, writing the alphabet along her clit and hood with light pressure, really exaggerate the intersections of certain letters like X Y B G things like that, allow words that are circular like D G P to go around the clit while letters like E F H L J go beside it and around the edges. If you know cursive maybe play with that as well ;P creativity is a blessing! lastly two other things for this link up your letters don't stop the movement after finishing so instead of A B C D you want ABCDE going from where you stopped on one letter and moving into the next. Don't be afraid to stop at any letter you choose to do something else, if she doesn't seem to like it move on, if she does maybe write all the letters again but backwards or upside down.\n\none of my favorite starter moves after i have her warmed up and i have explored her with my tongue is to treat her clit like its a dripping drop on an ice cream cone,\nturn your head sideways and drag the side of your tongue with it [curled slightly](http://imgur.com/tqYN93a) from her opening or urethra up across her clit. when you get underneath her clit apply a bit more pressure as if to lick it up and as you glide over the clit try to lift her hood a little bit playfully. I personally do this once or twice to tease her and release a few waves of pleasure.\n\nafter you have her warmed up there are a few things ive learned about sensing her body's pleasure and how to use that to navigate your tongue as you try to learn what she wants from you.\n\nHer hands, if she has her hand on your head your where she wants you to be, stay there!\n\nto find rhythm, speed, and pressure move a hand to her lower stomach or the bottom of her thigh as if your holding it up a bit for support, these two areas are not only comfortable to her as you press on, but they also allow you to feel her muscles as she squeezes her inner muscles. her lower stomach is the ideal place to feel from as the closer she gets the tighter she should flex and the longer she will hold her muscles. If she doesn't like your hands in either spot or you don't feel like putting your hands there because they are busy with other things you can watch her breathing and her stomach for tensing up. if you have your fingers in her you will be able to feel her contractions and be able to use that as well to know what is feeling good. \n\nMoans and panting are good signs but not the tell all be all of how it feels, sometimes she will lose her self in concentration on how good it feels and could stop breathing for a while (lol this is fun to see ;P). Silence is hard to tell often times if it is good or just not really cutting it so pay attention to her facial expressions her breathing and her body cues, if her hands grip at anything this could be a good sign just make sure you aren't hurting her by slowly doing what you did again with a bit less pressure, if you get the cues like its still good then great if she pulls away or winces you may want to pull away from that again as it could hurt (too much pressure) or she may be too sensitive to that still.\n\n\nonce you find her way of explaining that what your doing is what she wants through her body, you want to stay there and keep going until she climaxes! \nit could take a while, and like running a mile sometimes you may need to slow the pace slightly or extended your stride to make sure your keeping up a good strong pace to finish the mile. you can speed up slightly with a little more pressure to tip her over the edge however keep in mind that if you start this you could get really tired and it may cause you to stop at the worst moment, use that wisely and as a last means to get a great climax for her as you run low on strength. Also a quick word about sucking some girls really like it others say they dont care for it, i usually will give a bit of pressure always and for those who like it alot i will finish her buy sucking mildly as i lick her clit.\n\nthe mouth cupping the vagina is superior to just licking with the tongue, since your tongue is still in your mouth and you have a better range of motion/speed/pressure with out having to use as much effort. Not only that but when you know shes close or if she starts to grind against your face (fuck thats sooo nice!) you can use your head or jaw to asist in the motion of your tongue or her thrusts!\n\nAfter she climaxes, personally i like to gently slow down get away from the clit and hood and maybe kiss her labia, mound and tummy or one or two licks from bottom to top very lightly to clean up the mess a bit ( and my way of saying thank you for the ride ;P)\n\n\n**No TL;DR for this section as its very detailed and if you cant stop to read that, your on your own**\n\n\n**This could have been much long as i could include eating out while fingering, 69-ing and face sitting!**\n\n**Lastly if you want me to find the articles ive read and the videos ive watched to learn more id be more than happy to share!**\n\nThanks for reading and i hope i helped you lovely people to learn something more about going down and doing it with passion!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412672092", "subreddit": "AskMen", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*(respondo tmb a la pregunta de /u/CyberJIT )*\n\n##Simplificando mucho (un ELI5+tl;dr):\n\nUn canje de deuda es decirle a alguien que tiene deuda tuya (bonos, prestamos bancarios, facturas impagas (aka deuda flotante), etc.) \"dame el papelito que dice que te debo y te lo cambio por otro papelito que dice que te debo\"\n\nA grosso modo, la deuda tiene 5 grandes características: \n\n1. Principal (o capital, cuanto te debo)\n2. Interés (cuanto rinde el principal)\n3. Cuando vence la deuda\n3. Jurisdicción\n4. El orden en el que cobras (esto es útil si pensás que va a quebrar tu deudor). ^tiene ^un ^nombre ^especifico, ^pero ^no ^me ^lo ^acuerdo ^ahora.\n\nEn un canje de deuda agarrás deuda que tiene tal combinación de (1;2;3;4;5) y la cambias por otra que tiene tal combinación de (1;2;3;4;5). Dependiendo de como negocies, el contexto, tus habilidades, tus preferencias haces tal o cual cambio. \n\nEntonces, al juzgar cada canje, **tenes que tener en mente cual es el contexto del gobierno**, ¿está desesperado? ¿tiene otras opciones? ¿que prioriza? ¿futuras emisiones? ¿patearlo para adelante? ¿volver a los mercados?¿quiere obtener una \"victoria\" simbólica? y un largo etcétera.\n\n------\n\nTe pongo 3 ejemplos:\n\n***MEGACANJE***\n\n&gt; La argentina quería llegar al \"deficit\" cero (recordar, por ejemplo, Lopez Murphy) porque estaba sobre-endeudada. El gobierno estaba subiendo los impuestos (tablita de machinea, impuesto al cheque), tratando y bajar los gastos (igual, son politicos, así que mucha más garra le ponían a los de los impuestos) \n\n&gt; Dado que la argentina estaba endeudada hasta la manija, pagaba mucho en concepto de intereses . Quería, el gobierno, bajar los gastos en intereses.\n\n&gt;&gt;   De ahí le sale la idea de agarrar los bonos que está pagando hoy y cambiarlos por bonos que tienen un periodo de gracia y, por lo tanto, empiezan a pagarse después.\n\n&gt;&gt;  Ahora, como carajo hacés para decirle a un tipo que tiene derecho a cobrar al día de hoy (y está cobrando al día de hoy) que le vas a dejar de pagar y volver a empezar a pagar en 5 años? Y... le prometés que le vas a pagar más.\n\n&gt;&gt;  Lo que hicimos, entonces es tráiganme sus bonos, que tienen un principal de usd X y rinden Y %, dénmelos.  Yo se los tomo a X, ahora les doy  bonos que empiezo a pagar (periodo de gracia) en un par de años y tienen un principal de X y rinden Z % con Z mayor a Y y W mayor a X. Habría que ver bien los datos para ver si cargaron más en el capital o en el interés o como hicieron.\n\n&gt;&gt;  **Así, aumenté la deuda pública, pero la patee para adelante**. Si estaba ahogado financieramente porahí me da el respiro que necesito, a costo de mayores cargas futuras. Igual fue al pedo, porque entramos en default al toque.\n\n\n\n***CANJE 2005/10***\n\n&gt; Agarramos bonos que no se estaban pagando (justamente los del megacanje) y les decimos. Loco, la verdad es mucha guita. Yo hace 2 o 3 años que ando bien pero no para tanto.\n\n&gt; &gt;Haceme un recorte del principal (aprox 65%) , te sigo pagando una tasa altísima, te pago dentro de los 10 años (que es relativamente corto), lo seguimos haciendo bajo jurisdicción de EEUU\n\n&gt;&gt; Si no querés, yo sigo sin garparte (y le garpo a los que aceptan). Y sabé que, como mi economía anda bien, no estoy para nada apurado por arreglar eh\n\n&gt;&gt; **queue the holdouts**\n\n***CLUB DE PARÍS***\n\n&gt; Esto también fue un canje (también de deuda en default), pero de prestamos bilaterales (aunque negocian como un bloque los acreedores)\n\n&gt; En el momento del acuerdo, a diferencia de 2005, queríamos arreglar rápido para volver al financiamiento internacional (recordar que pagamos juicios del CIADI sin sentencia, fue Kiciloff al FMI a presentar el nuevo IPC, etc). \n\n&gt;&gt; Arreglamos un cronograma de pago a 5 años (muy corto), y pagamos unos intereses punitorios como del 8% anual (altísmos, sobre todo para prestamos bilaterales), pero **lo sacamos en 2 patadas (y sin la intervención del FMI)**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412714387", "subreddit": "argentina", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Do you know the major scale? You really, really should because it is the basis around which all theory is built and the reference point for all musical vernacular.\n\nIt is the old do ri me fa so la ti do.\n\nOkay, so we'll use the C major scale: C D E F G A B\n\nEver hear about the \"relative minor\"? If you count through C major to the 6th note, it is A. And everyone knows that the 6th note is the \"relative minor\". I will demonstrate: Play a C major chord and play a few notes from the C major scale over it, and it will sound just like a major scale. Now, play an A minor chord and play the C major scale over it. Suddenly those same notes sound darker, etc. That is because the C major scale = the A minor scale! Same exact notes, but the chord underneath changes it from a major scale to a minor scale.\n\nEach note in the major scale works the same way - they can tell you what mode your major scale would be if you were playing it over different chords.\n\nHere are the modes in order of appearance:\n\nIonian (this is the major scale) - Play the C major scale over a C major chord, and it's Ionian, the major scale in the key of C.\n\nDorian - This is the 2nd mode. In a C major scale the 2nd note is D. So if you play a C major scale over a D minor chord, it's Dorian in the key of D.\n\nPhrygian - This is the 3rd mode. In a C major scale the 3rd note is E. So if you play a C major scale over an E minor chord, it's Phrygian in the key of E.\n\nLydian - This is the 4th mode. In a C major scale the 4th note is F. So if you play a C major scale over an F major chord, it's Lydian in the key of F.\n\nMixolydian - This is the 5th mode. In a C major scale the 5th note is G. So if you play a C major scale over an G major chord, it's Mixoydian in the key of G.\n\nAeolian (the natural minor) - This is the 6th mode. In a C major scale the 6th note is A. So if you play a C major scale over an A minor chord, it's Aeolian in the key of A. This is the one everyone learns.\n\nLocrian - This is the 7th mode. In a C major scale the 7th note is B. So if you play a C major scale over an B diminished chord, it's Locrian in the key of B.\n\nBut why?: because chords are built from scales. Take the same C major scale: C D E F G A B. Now, to harmonize the scale into chords, we \"stack 3rds\", which means we use every other note. So, starting from C, we use C, E and G to build the first \"triad\". That is where chords come from. If we continue starting at each note and stacking 3rds on them, we get every chord in the key. And you will find that you end up with C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor and B diminished. \"But why are some chords major, some minor and what is a diminished?\" Play an E major chord in the usual way. Now make it minor. See how you lifted that one finger? What you did was flatten the third. You need 3 notes to make a chord: the root, the 3rd and the 5th. If the 3rd is flattened, it is a minor chord. When you stack the major scale in 3rds to make chords, some have the flat 3rd, some don't. And you always get the same pattern: major, minor, minor, major, major, minor and a diminished. The diminished chord has a flat 3rd and a flat 5th.\n\nNot coincidentally, the modes follow the exact same pattern of majors and minors, because it is all intrinsically related - the chords in a key are built from those parts of the scale.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412767522", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi!\n\nDiamond 4 Ryze main here, with 73% winrate as Ryze (: \n\nI'll write a really quick guide for new Ryzerinos, my style of playing is slightly different from that of most Ryze guides on the internet, but here it goes-\n\nI personally believe that Ryze is the most broken champ in the game. His item build enables him to become super tanky while also dealing a shit-ton of damage. This means that if the enemy team focuses you during a teamfight, they're going to take way too long to kill you and your teammates will screw them over. If they decide not to focus you, you can just steamroll over everyone and enjoy free gold.\n\nThat said, I also personally believe that, contrary to popular belief, Ryze is a really strong champ throughout the whole game. What I mean by this is that he's ridiculously strong early game. and mid game. and super broken late game. \n\nOf course, Ryze is only this ridiculously strong when he's in top lane - he gets shat on by many midlaners in the game (Xerath, Ziggs, Lux). What makes Ryze so effective vs many top laners is the fact that you can abuse your range to the maximum. Your skills are highly spammable so you can pretty much harass any melee champ that dares to come near the minion wave, every single time. Your ability to trade is unmatched, since your combos + auto attack weave is just ridiculously strong.\n\nI generally have 2 different set of runes when I play Ryze - what rune set i choose depends on the enemy top/jungle composition. If they have a mix (say Elise/Renekton) I run MR glyphs, armor seals, MPen marks, and health quints. If they're double AD, I run a general mix of armor glyphs, armor/health seals, mpen marks, and HP quints (if you want to see runes/masteries for yourself, here's my na.op.gg - http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Dongo+Dunderson)\n\nI generally like to run health runes over MS runes because 4.5% movement speed, I personally believe, is useless anyways, since good kiting will always keep you in a safe yet aggressive range of the enemy top laner. If you want to trade better though and always have an health advantage over the top laner (and thus pressure the shit out of him), health is the way to go.\n\nI like to run 4/7/19 masteries, for dem extra cooldowns and defense and such. Again, you can check it out in my na.op.gg link.\n\nWhen in lane, I start aggressive harass from level 1. Every time you cast your spell, you should weave in an auto-attack in there. So Q&gt;AA&gt;W&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA&gt;E&gt;AA&gt;Q and such. Mashing your keyboard is a pretty bad idea sometimes (your spells can actually cancel your animation, so for example if you cast W too fast right after casting Q, the Q just wont cast at all and Ryze will just be standing there dancing) so you have to be pretty patient and ride the rhythm. Your bread and butter combo pre-6 is Q W Q E Q, assuming that the enemy is in range. if they're running around a lot and staying out of range of your spells, QWEQ is better for a quick burst.\n\npost-6 spell combo, every single time, is Q E Q W Q R Q E Q W Q. Weave them Q's in there. You probably won't need to weave in auto's every single time, but they help. this combo ensures that you get the maximum number of Q off in your combo.\n\nIn the laning phase, I like to maximize Ryze's damage output - I start off with a mana crystal and 2 pots. I generally like to back at either 700 gold, 1100 gold, or 1435 gold, depending on how much you're CS'ing, how much harass you're receiving, whether you're winning or not, etc etc.\n\nFor 700 gold - complete tear and buy 1 mana crystal\n\nFor 1100 gold - complete tear and buy 2 mana crystals\n\nFor 1435 gold - complete tear, buy 2 mana crystals, and boots\n\nNow you effectively have a lot more mana, and these are the only mana crystals that you'll need all game. I like to upgrade those 2 mana crystals into Catalyst crystal and Glacial shroud ASAP, and then continue my build there - if the enemy team is AP heavy, build Rod of Ages first. If they're AD heavy or you have a strong AD laner in your lane, build a frozen heart.\n\nIn team fights, I usually like to wait until the teamfight has somewhat started. When it does, I activate R and go 100% TSM Amazing (at least I got chicken) and run teh fuck in there and focus down the ADC and APC. Forget the tanks man, they can't do anything to you - you're the Ryzerino.

{"body": "It's pretty much what note everything resolves most comfortably to.\n\nA good practice though is this:\n\nIn C major, the notes of the scale are C D E F G A B.\n\nTo make a basic major/minor triad (three note) chord you take a note, miss the next letter, take the next note, miss the next letter and then take the last note. Lost? Hopefully this example will make more sense:\n\nThe first triad (three note) chord you can make uses the notes C (skip the note D) E (skip the note F) G.\n\nC E G make a C chord. (it would have to be Eb instead of E to make it a minor chord but Eb isn't in the key of C, got it?).\n\nFollowing this pattern the next basic triad chord starts from D so miss a note, pick F, miss a note, pick A.\n\nD F A make a D minor chord (F would have to be F# to make a major but DAT AINT IN DA SCALE. GNOME SAYIN?)\n\nFollowing this pattern from all seven notes and you'll find this pattern of chords:\n\nMajor, minor, minor, major, major, minor, minor 7b5.\n\nThis pattern is used for all major scales.\n\nWhere am I going for this? Look for patterns: if you have an A major chord and a B major chord in the chord progression then that's the fourth and fifth notes of the scale you're using (using the pattern I just wrote down, two major chords are next to each other only twice in the pattern) So if B major is the fifth, E major is the root. Therefore the key is E major.\n\nIf this doesn't make sense let me know, hope it helps. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412790198", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "At a given point in a track, the track can generally be thought of as being \"in\" a given chord, and all the notes playing anytime within that period are either recognizably related to that chord or are conspicuously not related. So you can have a melodic line where no two notes ever play at the same time, but all the notes in that short section of the passage come from that chord.\n\nIn the first little passage section (about 0:00 to 0:05), the melody notes go:\n\nA A F G D F F F F F G D \n\n...while there's a D on the left hand. Well, the basic triad notes for Dm are D, F and A. See how the melody is based around those? The only outlier is G, and having that in there just makes the next D stronger. So this section is based around the Dm chord.\n\nThe next section (roughly 0:05 to 0:08) is:\n\nE E C D A C C C C C D A\n\n...with I think an A on the left hand. See the pattern? The \"chord notes\" for this section are A, C, and E which come from the Am chord. Again, there's one non-chord tone (D), which makes the next note sound a little heavier IMHO.. \n\nI hope this helps clear things up a bit! The idea is that the chord notes aren't necessarily played together, but they'd form a chord if you did play them together, so you can still look for the pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412864854", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A couple tips for adding units to your control groups\n * When going for an attack, build a proxy pylon to warp in units close to the battle\n * Have your production facilities on a  hotkey and rally them to your proxy pylon, so when non warpgate units come out, they go to that pylon\n * When you warp units in at your proxy pylon, add them into your control group right away, as well as any non warpgate units that are there\n\nAs others have mentioned, at this level(I'm silver myself) you just want to focus on making stuff, worry less about the micro. Your opponent is just as bad as you, so if you have the bigger army, you will almost always win. Some amount of micro is good, like focus firing threats, using forcefields to split an army or blink to get on the high ground, but worry less about blinking individual stalkers back, and use it more as a tool to get to the high ground, or get really close to siege tanks to take them out quickly. But don't forget to keep making stuff the whole time. It's better to let 2 stalkers die and warp in 6 more, then to sit and micro them, lose them all and your advantage\n\nYou can use keyboard shortcuts to make life easy, for example holding ctrl and clicking a unit will select all of that unit type on screen, so you can warp in a bunch of stalkers, ctrl+click one of them, then shift+control group button to add them in. You can be done that before they're even finished warping in and get right back to the battle\n\nCamera Keys are helpful for this as well, i have cameras on caps lock and tab, i can set one of them for my proxy pylon and the other for wherever the battle is taking place, so i can switch out, warp in units and be back to the battle right away\n\nI might recommend looking at a custom hotkey layout like the core or the grid. I use a variant of the core called The Chameleon(Meant for laptops) which puts the hotkeys in logical and easily accessible spots. To give you an example, my control group are bound to, from 1 to 0, 4 5 6 e r t d f g b so i put nexii on 4, production on 5 and upgrade on 6, then use e d f for my army. Unit skills are bound to s and w(and x if needed) and attack is still a. So with this setup i can change army, attack, use skills, and jump to cameras without moving my hand. The only thing i need to move at all for is to hit 5 to select my warp gates. This can also help some with micro, for example, it's good to have colossus on a separate control group sometimes, so you can keep them behind the rest of the army\n\nIf you want to practice, i can send you my bnet name later", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412869704", "subreddit": "allthingsprotoss", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In the book 'Sled Driver' about the SR-71, he talks about how towards the end of refueling, the weight would make it so the aircraft was too slow in military power, so they would have to fire one afterburner and fly the plane crabbed.  Crazy to think about.\n\nHere's the passage:\n\n&gt;I was accustomed to being on the boom for just a few minutes to top off i n\nfighters. In contrast, SR-71 refuelings took fifteen minutes or more which could\nseem like an eternity. This time was needed because the airplane took on a n\nincredible amount of fuel. During a normal refueling w e usually received over\n11,000 gallons. This changed our gross weight by 70,000 pounds a n d caused a\ncorrespon d i ng change i n the center of gravity of our a i rcraft.\nAt the slow 300 knot range i n which we were flying to refuel, the feel of the jet\nbecame sluggish as the SR filled with fuel. At these gross weights a n d slower\na i rspeeds, the SR-71 became thrust limited during the last few minutes of refueling.\nIn m i l itary power, we would start to fall off the boom. A disconnect was highly\nu n d esirable since the jet was less responsive now a n d to reconnect was more\ndifficult. It also meant wasting time on the refueling track a n d this could affect our\novera l l mission timing. The solution was to light one afterburner with careful\nfinesse. The fine art of pulling the throttle ever so slightly up a n d just into the\nm i n i m u m burner range was h a n d ed down from one generation of SR pilots to the\nnext. The SR is the only a i rplane I know that required the use of afterburner to stay\non the boom.\n\n&gt;Using one afterburner caused another problem: asymmetrical thrust. Some pilots\nused a little rudder to handle the yaw. Others left the rudders alone, flew sideways,\na n d looked out the front quarter panel to see forwa rd. The quarter panels were\nlocated on either side of the windshield. Only the left quarter panel was wired for\ndefogging so we always lit the left burner to yaw right so we could use this feature if\nneeded.\n\n&gt;The most exciting moments on the refueling track were normally reserved for\nthose fi n a l few m i nutes in afterburner on the boom with a very heavy jet. Once I\nselected m i n AB a n d the TEB dumped in, there was a pause, then the airplane\nlunged sideways a n d started to charge up the boom. With the left burner sta bilized\nin min AB, I control led our fore and aft position with right throttle. With this method,\nthe pilot controlled the a i rplane by leading the power inputs. It was l i ke flying a\nfreight train because the a i rplane's i n ertia caused a lag between throttle input a n d\na i rcraft response. It wasn't uncommon a t this point for the di rector lights to\nresemble a pinball game, flashing from end to end as the fore a n d aft movements of\nthe jet caused conti n u a l changes in relative position. I had to ignore the d irector\nl i ghts, grit my teeth, a n d ca l l on every bit of my experience to get to the end of the\nrefueling track with a full tank.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1412969434", "subreddit": "MilitaryPorn", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It was a great event but not epic. \n\nI wasn't at location so can't speak about that part. \n\n**What ESL did well:**\n\n- Redeye. \nHe is just a pleasant professional person that comes of as more knowledgeable than he is but still humbly considers himself a noob. However put him in the middle of the analyst desk. He is the host and should have the majority of the attention as he is the moderator of the conversation. Doesn't matter if he is the least knowledgeable about the game. \nHonestly Redeye is in my opinion the best thing that has happened to the Dota 2 esport community in recent times. \n\n- Waiting times between games. It's really pleasant when you have a timer telling you *exactly* how much time there is until the next game and I believe no break were longer than 10 minutes. Perfect for toilet breaks or just any breaks really. And *every time* the timer hit 0 the \"T-mobile analyst desk\" appeared, so satisfying. \n\n- Production. \nSeriously, well done guys behind the scene. Everything looked professional. The advertisement rolled on well. The music played well a faded perfectly about 10 seconds before the action started no matter what. The names of people and their team winning predictions were up within mere seconds. Even the F E N C E which gave me and others a nice chuckle. The picture was crystal clear on my stream at least and there was minimal clutter in game. Just overall really well done. \n\n\n**What ESL did less well:**\n\n- Computer problems. \nYou can't stand responsible for the early server problems and I don't blame you but there is a reason twitch chat made IBUYSHIT popular. I can understand it being a sponsor and you stand in their mercy a bit. But it really took away from the immersion in many games with the constant pauses. And the pauses were *long* with minimal explanation what was going on except filming the player with the problem and the support guy. Some insight would be nice. \n\n- Too few \"event experiences\". \nThere were like two matchmaking episodes and one actionslacks interview(which was less good) and that was it for the two days? Improve on this and make it feel like a bit more of an event and get personal with your crowd. You can't really lose on that to be honest. Also barely any player interviews. I really like short player interviews where you get to learn about the person. Not generic *how do you feel about the game* sports questions. Those are fine but add player interviews, don't have to be that long just a bit more personal. Dreamleague has done this fairly well before I think. \n\n- djwheat. \nI might get a bit of slack about this but I don't think djwheat fit in too well. I know he's a bit of a legend in esports and especially with the sc2 scene and MLG I believe before they stopped doing sc2 events. He is a good interviewer because he can talk and know how to get good questions from people and how to handle people like iceiceice. But I personally thought it was fairly easy seeing through that and it looked like he wasn't that passionate about the game, he did seem like he would rather be somewhere else some times. \n\nI think that was about it about my honest thoughts and opinions about the event with a little more meat to it than \"this was epic\", \"this was shit\". Just some friendly constructive criticism :)\nOne last thing. I think two days was a bit short. One more day would have been awesome. Mainly because overall the event was well put together and I sat through it all, good times on the day for a Swede too.\n\n**Fluff**\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with American advertisement haha. Are your ads like that? Really, what the hell was that Pizza hut ad? I couldn't stop laughing about how stupid it was everytime it came on. And the T-mobile ad, it basically was just some generic footage of teens at a festival and then they just said \"We are better than the competition\", oh really now. \nAnd that ibuypower ad made no sense, a meteor falling down with some dude looking weird and bringing home a computer that looked like the ps4?

And the reason for this is simple: I have no idea what I'm doing anymore. I don't know what specific chords I play or what versions of them I try out, but I know very well when something sounds good and when something doesn't. \n\nIt's easy to get stuck in the patterns we are used to, like the infamous, awesome sounding but a bit tedious Am F C G, or my other favorite Bm A G F# with that bluesy tune to it. But as soon as music becomes stale it's dead. So how do we keep it fluid and flexible? Retune your guitar, learn a new scale, try a different kind of rhythm or just switch to 6/4 instead of 4/4 - we all have our methods. But try the tuning I mentioned, I'll guarantee that you will find some new sweet licks and scales that you haven't tried before. If you're out of ideas just play it as if it would be a pentatonic scale on a regular tuning - it sounds amazing and it's so easy to improvise from.

So the odds are ***actually*** better for Cloud9! :o\n\nSo to all of you that are gloating about the odds being skewed in the favour of iBP, **you're WRONG!** Cloud9 was the \"correct\" bet in this case.\n\nSince iBP just took Cache, they now need **W W W**, **L W W L W** or **W W L W**. Again, punching in the numbers (0.4^3 x 0.6 x 3^C^2 + 0.4^3 + 0.4^3 x 0.6^2) gives a total of 0.22528, or **in other words, a 23% chance of iBP taking the game.**\n\nSo, as soon as the first game is won, suddenly the odds are looking significantly better for iBP.\n\nNow that they secured the first two wins, the odds are now at 0.4^2 + 0.4^2 x 0.6 x 2^C^1 = 0.352, or a 35% chance of winning.\n\nIf you were to play the odds, Cloud9 would have been the better bet by a 4% margin, but having said that iBP have a momentous lead in the odds department since they took the first map.\n\nOf course, this doesn't factor in mental preparation, momentum and aim etc...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413050507", "subreddit": "csgobetting", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Dear sir, \n\nI think you are highly intelligent (sarcasm not included). That's not the problem here. The problem isn't how smart you are. The problem is how you ignore what is actually happening the real world. You're stuck in book world where you learned all this \"stuff\" from and then act as if it can apply to the real world that the rest live in...the university mentality kills creativity and thinking.  Evident by your application of who drains taxes by using emergency rooms. Under the assumption the uninsured are citizens and not understanding that it's mainly illegals. \n\nThe problem is that the fact that illegals are a tax drain goes against your \"feelings\" of how they should be treated. This has created a weird double standard that you don't care to correct. \n\n&gt;What, you insisting that things were true because you imagined them to be, and refusing to change your mind when presented with any evidence to the contrary?\n\nI'm sorry, what are you talking about? I gave evidence to every single thing I've offered. YOU, however, have not. \n\nSo don't put that in your pipe and smoke, because that's probably why you can't seem to grasp how you are who you can't stand in this conversation, since you're the one doing everything you're accusing me of.\n\nGovernment is not needed in our lives as is. Or why would the creation of this country and the branches of government be done in order to create a system that would gridlock any creation of new laws? That's why each are equal in power, none is more powerful than the other. There was supposed to be gridlock. There was supposed to be NOTHING done. Why have another kingdom? As you want it that's exactly what it would be called. \n\nI'm glad when you said Government's useful that you listed why. Well done using feelings and I THINK again. \n\nYes, because when President Bush was in office the left was so pleased with all he did and never, ever complained. \n\nPresident Obama is self centered douchebag. Evident by his speeches.

They are not a care facility. I'm sorry you don't get that, but that makes a HUGE difference in how they're ran. Same with the Government. \n\nWhich is why neither are necessary in all aspects of life and the former is never necessary in any aspect of life. \n\nI don't care if it was right, left, up or down, any form of health care is stupid when it's a tax and then takes from the good to give to the stupid. \n\nYes it does. \n\nAnd now to prove you wrong. \n\n[Bankrupt hospitals](http://www.managedcaremag.com/content/bankrupt-hospitals-england-turn-private-sector)\n\n[Fat costs a lot](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/obesity-bankrupt-nhs-warning)\n\n[the old cost a lot, too](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10387187/NHS-faces-bankruptcy-over-ageing-population.html)\n\n[Doctors are controlled by government more than their own knowledge](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2661970/Death-bureaucracy-As-learn-NHS-bankrupt-read-excoriating-attack-managers-senior-consultant.html)\n\n[Crazy people cost a lot](http://www.oecd.org/health/uk-needs-to-tackle-high-cost-of-mental-ill-health.htm)\n\nHigh costs with not a lot of good turn out is pretty sad. Considering you claimed government involvement makes things better. Over there it has made things worse and Doctors don't like being doctors. Great job in backing a terrible idea. \n\nNot to mention in the UK they use ambulances as taxis. Oh, drunk? Call an ambulance, they can't say no. What a great use of medical transportation.\n\n[Canada ranked last....](http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/canada-ranked-last-among-oecd-countries-in-health-care-wait-times-1.1647061)\n\nI believe individuals have the best knowledge on how to handle their own lives and that they should be able to do so in all aspects of their life. \n\nGovernment need not be involved. \n\nYou know what would happen if this were actually true? Gay marriage would be okay. But because Government entangles itself in everything, this has made what liberals claim to care about an actual issue when it never should've been. \n\nLess government, more freedom for those that claim to want it, but you really don't want that. You are part of that liars club that want to control people and their choices.

I have two good spots for pub noobs that has a &gt;50FB rate in the first minute  \n- Soul Ring. You get this 100% of the time on techies  \n- Either Tranquil boots or bottle (you can mana boot if you go bottle). You need something to sustain your HP when you consonantly use SR  \n- Void stone -&gt; Eul  \n- Situational ForceStaff here. If you know what you're doing you can skip Eul if you have bottle. I rarely go for FS.  \n- Extra void stone (if you don't go FS)  \n- Aghs. You should finish Aghs in 35m. (90% of the time I have SR, Tranq, Eul, VoidStone, Aghs)  \n- Make either AC if no one plans to, Scythe or Shivas  \n- Sell SoulRing for Mystic Staff then make Scythe or Shivas.  \n- You should be 6 slotted. You can sell boots for BoT. BuyBack isn't too great on techies but isn't terrible when you have aghs\n\nPlay techies in safe lane (or mid with bottle). Pull and try to last hit creeps. If you really want to try, plant a mine and try to get LH on two neutral creeps. In lane you plant a mine in front of their face so they're scared to walk there. It's mostly a ~~mine~~ mind game. If you think you can kill 2-3 lane creeps plant a mine to do it.\n\nAfter pulling consider stacking big creeps. If a ward is up grab the bounty rune. Its a good idea to get to lvl 6 ASAP so consider not pulling too much and being in lane. 4 mines for FB, 4 level 4 mines to kill most heros in first 20m. A fair rule of thumb is 4mines for 0-20m then another mine every 10m. (0-20m=4, 20-30m=5, 30-40m=6 etc).\n\n5 Remote mines to kill heros. 6 if you're underleveled (ie should have lvl 2 or 3 ult but dont). Once you have aghs you only need 4 remote mines to kill. \n\nI like putting mines in front of enemies towers because they never expect it. About 5seconds walking distance. After planting 2 I don't hide and I will detonate+suicide if someone comes at me. I like to eul, double click mines (cause you cant use normal skill hotkey) and detonate then suicide. If I plant all 5 I just detonate. \n\nFarming in forest sucks since 6.82 so either farm small camp, satyr or don't bother. Skill build I typically go Q E E Q Q Ult Q W E E Ult W W W. If you don't plan to suicide you can skip the 2nd E for a W. \n\nOnce you have aghs you can teamfight. Just plan statis traps (W) and barrels (ult). When you guys enagage you can either back or stand on traps and throw your ult+detonate for heavy damage. You have pretty decent throw range once you get aghs.\n\nAfter taking T2 tower I like standing uphill near T3 and drop traps at the side + 4 ult (usually have aghs by then). Then I throw barrels downhill between myself and T3 tower ramp.

It turns out while those numbers are important, really, they are meaningless because of the situation. \n\nThe largest problem facing the kids is organization. While Pikachu is greatly outnumbered, it only has to focus on getting away from the children, which after a few quick warning bolts, it can do no problem. We know that Pikachu is faster than Ash, and can outdistance him, and he is in better physical condition than the 7 year olds. It is not a stretch to assume that once Pikachu has the lead, it will maintain that lead.\n\nThe children, however, will have trouble organizing into a coherent group, and while there might be a few that chase after Pikachu, their numbers would be meaningless. Even if they start with Pikachu surrounded, it can use its agility and double team coupled with the previously mentioned warning shots to quickly break any circle formed. \n\nSo really, if we are honest and realistic, the kids don't stand a chance. Pikachu will manage to escape, hid someplace high, and evade capture. \n\nTL;DR Kids don't stand a chance.  \n", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1413148347", "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

Starting from each note in the major scale, take the notes a third and a fifth from that note to form your triad. In C, that's C major (CEG) D minor (DFA) E minor (EGB) F major (FAC) G Major (GBD) A minor (ACE) and B diminished (BDF)\n\nStep 3: Learn seventh chords from the major scale.

You can turn any chord into a dominant 7 chord (like that G7 chord) if the next chord in the progression is up a fourth or down a fifth.

{"body": "From my reading in the past that I'm too lazy to properly cite, my understanding is that this is a common misconception. Burn pain is **extremely** intense and will often require some pretty hardcore amounts of some serious medication just to make the pain manageable. It's not uncommon to treat the pain to a manageable level and call it good enough, just because of how heavily the use of opioids is required - and I've never heard of anything short of opioids doing the trick. Burns *really*, **R E A L L Y** hurt, and they hurt even worse when you're treating them, but using excessive amounts of opioids can raise tolerance which just puts the patient in an even worse position where patients can start developing pain responses to non-painful stimuli and existing pain is only amplified, requiring - you guessed it - more opioids.\n\nBut still, the guys on the ambulances will just fill you with so much fentanyl that you will either a) not feel pain anymore or b) not really be aware of or care about the pain anymore. Fentanyl is *extremely* potent and fast acting and has a very short lifetime in the human body which makes it perfect for this use on the way to the hospital for your morphine and treatment.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413178870", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From music theory point of view chord is sequence of notes that usually has no repetions.    \nEg. C major chord is simply C E G.    \nOn a guitar you can still play C major as C E G eg.    \n875xxx or x320xx or xx1098x etc    \nJust play three strings and don't play the rest.  \n \nHowever most people will play C major as eg.   \n332010 = GCEGCE    \nit is still C major just with some notes doubled an octave higher.   \nOr 3355533 = GCGCEG etc etc    \n\nAs far as how to construct chords... one class of chords can be constructed by taking a scale and picking every other tone from scale starting on a certain degree. These are called diatonic chords.    \nFor example for C scale if you pick 3 notes you get:   \nC E G = C   \nD F A = Dm  \nE G B = Em   \netc.     \nIf you pick 4 notes you get:   \nC E G B = Cmaj7    \nD F A C = Dm7   \nE G B D = Em7   \nF A C E = Fmaj7   \nG B D F = G7   \netc    \n\nOne more thing - chords can be \"inverted\" so C E G, E G C and G C E are all C chord.    \nSometimes inversion can also be called by a different name....    \nFor example Am7 = A C E G    \nBut inversion is C E G A and that can be also called C6.      \n\nAs a general remark - start thinking in terms of NOTES that are contained in a given chord - it will make your guitaristic life much simpler - rather than memorizing shapes of chords - since you can ALWAYS make up chord forms s as you go and they will sound harmonically correct as long as right notes are in - you do not have to replicate exact fingering.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413184001", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh, and why am I so quick to say \"you need maintenance\", and imply that something about you is wrong?\n\nBecause by cold, hard, rationality, that's the most reasonable assumption: the vast majority of people who are not you, are having sex a lot. You are not having sex at all. This can be because there is something wrong with everyone else, that causes them to somehow miss noticing you, or there is something wrong with you. Assume that the probability of something being wrong with a person is P. P can be any value you choose. The likelihood of \"something is wrong with everyone else\" being true is P x P x P x P x P ... x P for millions or billions. P is between 0 and 1, so the result of multiplying all those Ps together is very very small, effectively zero. The likelihood of \"something is wrong with you, a single individual\", is, however, just P, which is significantly bigger than zero. Therefore, proceeding on the assumption that the problem lies with you is the most reasonable course of action.\n\nBut let's assume that somehow, against all odds, there really is nothing wrong with you -- your worldview, your social conduct, is somehow better than the prevailing culture, and there is indeed something wrong with how everyone else is acting. If that's true, you have a difficult decision to make: What do you value more, being right, or having sex? (For the record, in my own case I honestly believed, and somewhat still believe, that my worldview and social conduct *was* better than what my surrounding culture considered normal. I believed that I was less cruel, more logical, and more compassionate. I had to make this hard choice too, and chose to compromise. It was initially very difficult.)\n\nSo yeah. You're the one who needs fixing, even if you're already perfect. (But even if you do think that, you have to admit that you're probably operating on flawed observations.

{"body": "These creatures are strange. Something about their pale skin makes me cringe. It has been three moons since they arrived in a big grey thing that pushes the air away from it and into the trees. They want us to leave our home. \n\nMy name is Karichi. I have lived for 70 seasons. I am the daughter of the chief of my village, Nikitina. He has put me in charge until him and the warriors come back from this season's discovery. He will not find me when he comes back. He will not find any women. \n\nThe pale things have a healer who can speak a similar language to ours. He said we have three moons to prepare to leave. It has been three moons, and I am not prepared at all. \n\nNone of us are. \n\nWe step out onto the ground a long time later. Many of us are still amazed from the adventure we just had. We saw the world from the view of a bird, and we watched our tiny little island shrink away forever. \n\nI try to remain strong as I look to the pale faces for guidance. I am still the leader, and I will need to put on a false face for my people. I nod reassuringly to Tiko, who is to my right. She is my fathers brothers daughter, and she is with child. She looks as scared as I feel. \n\nThey lead us into a wall that slides into a giant smooth rock. The scent stabs my nose. It's so sharp and unpleasant. There are white fluffy cloth tables inside the large rock. The healer pale face leads us each to our own and tells us to lie down. He asks us to remain calm as another pale face tries to stab me in my arm. I jump, but I know I am powerless against these people. I have no choice as I fade into the darkness. \n\nI awake slowly. My vision is very blurry as I open my eyes. There are many pale faces around me. They notice I am awake and the healer man walks towards me. \n\n\"You are safe. My name is James. Are you their leader? \n\nI nod reluctantly towards him.\n\n\"Come with me\"\n\nWe walk for a long time, weaving like a basket through many walls. He finally stops at a door that has letters in a combination I don't understand. It says:\n\nM O R G U E\n\nWe walk in and he goes over to a table like the one I slept on. He pulls away a sheet and I see Tiko's lifeless body. Her chest isn't rising and falling. I speak for the first time since my journey.\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"She is weak, unable to fight in our battle. We need strong young soldiers\"\n\n\"We will not fight. We are ladies\" I lie. \n\nBecause we will fight.\n\nWe will fight the pale ones. For Tiko and her baby. For my father. For our home.\n\nWe will fight. \n\n\n*Sorry if it's too abrupt or if there are formatting issues, I typed this on mobile*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413220534", "subreddit": "writingprompt", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Use chord extensions! Lots and lots of them. Create triads out of the extensions and create melodies out of them! Here's a little explanation if you care to read it:\n\nEach chord has a scale associated with it and each scale has a chord associated with it, scales and chords are just different ways of suggesting a certain collection of notes. For instance, the C major scale:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nNow, a C major chord up to the highest extension:\n\nC E G B D F A\n\nSee, they're the same notes, just rearranged a bit. If you start thinking this way it really frees up what you can do melodically. Something that I think is cool is creating triads out of the chord extensions and writing melodies based off of them. So over a C major chord you could play a C major triad (yawn), an E minor triad (little better), a G major triad (ooh, pretty), a B minor triad (woaah whaaatt), or a D major triad (where are we??). You'll notice I used chords with an F# instead of F natural, this is very common over major chords and sounds much better than using the natural 4. \n\nIf you want to branch out even more you could use each of these triads' corresponding pentatonic scale over the same C major chord. \n\nNow once you're familiar with your extensions over major, minor, and dominant chords, you can fool around with them. Say your chord progression is Dm G7 Cmaj. Over the Dm chord you land on the fifth of the chord, A, and hold it over to the G7 chord. Without even changing your melody note, you've transformed it from a boring fifth to a beautiful ninth, just by moving the harmony underneath it! If you keep holding that A over the Cmaj chord you get a sixth, a very colourful extension. I mean you probably want more than one melody note per three bars but it's something to keep in mind. Experiment with extensions and see what you can come up with. Hope that helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413222505", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It's vaguely similar to using &lt;k&gt; for /z/, it's going to cause a bit of unnecessary confusion.\n\nNow for &lt;u&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if instead of /ʌ/ you meant &lt;ə&gt; or some other schwa sound; depends n accents a lot, additionally the &lt;e&gt; might not be /ɛ/ so much as /e/ I can't really tell the difference between the two to well; and depending on your accent etcetera...\n\nBut presuming I've more or less correctly worked out what phonemes you want;\n\n/æ ɛ ʌ ɔ ɪ / &lt;a e u o π&gt; -&gt; &lt;a e å o i&gt;\n\n/aɪ oʊ æj ju/ &lt;i ø δ λ&gt; -&gt; &lt;ai ou ei yu&gt;\n\n\"long e sound in steam\" probably /iː/ (the ː indicates length, but the English notion of length is different to the IPAs notion; due to a long list of sound changes that have happened to English...) \"long o sound in book\" probably /ʊ/, \"long o sound in poop\", probably /uː/ (or maybe even /ʉː/! but lets ignore that)\n\nSo for these: /iː ʊ uː/ &lt;í u ú&gt;\n\nGiving you \n\n/æ ɛ ʌ ɔ iː ɪ ʊ uː/ &lt;a e å o í i u ú&gt;\n\n/aɪ oʊ æj ju/ &lt;ai ou ei yu&gt;\n\nAlthough many will probably suggest that &lt;å&gt; is out of place, but hey **don't feel you have to do anything I have said**, I'm ust trying to give some suggestions.\n\nAdditionally if you really wanted /aɪ oʊ æj ju/ to be written with just one letter; perhaps &lt;ä&gt; for /aɪ/,  &lt;ö&gt; or &lt;ō&gt; for /oʊ/ (that might just be /o/ anyway...), &lt;ä&gt; for /æj/, as for /ju/ maybe even something like &lt;ȳ&gt;.\nThere are lot's of different diacritics to choose from; personally I suggest trying not to use too many different ones; and regardless of what you use and where maybe even create a short history for them even if it's just that &lt;ae&gt; -&gt; &lt;ä&gt;, &amp; thus have &lt;ae&gt; quite rare now. Try and have the same diacritic do the same thing, so umlauts fronten back vowels (but leave them rounded), or macrons lengthen a short vowel - possibly raising it as well for a larger difference etc.\n\nAlso don't be afraid of digraphs; although depending on your syllable structures they may need more thought. Oh and also ambiguity isn't bad, although in a language where Stop+Stop is always illegal &lt;kt&gt; is pretty clearly whatever phoneme you choose, NOT /kt/ :)\n\nAll the best and if you haven't already please have a look through the language creation kit etc! :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413250013", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

As an American, I would L O V E for our government to spend billions and billions and billions of dollars to solve our own problems. I can't even imagine what life would be like if our government truly cared about the citizens it worked for, instead I have to settle for what life is like being ruled by a government that cares about getting more votes, and more money. Why do we REALLY interfere? i think it's because whatever country we're talking about, there are people here from that country and the politicians want their vote or their contributions. sure there are economic and military reasons, but everything they do is poll tested and marketing driven, it isn't done to benefit the U.S. citizens. We don't want to be in Mexico... come on man it's a shithole, nobody wants to be there. sure you have some cheap drugs and nice beaches and they're great to visit but otherwise most of us would much rather be here. The corruption in Mexico is insane. People say it isn't a culture thing but it sure does seem like it when you're in the middle of it.

If SAO sells it wont do anything but hopefully get us a better translation for the next game in the series, as well as guarantee us the sequel will get localized no problem.\n\nAlso \"These\" games is an interesting term you use, I didn't like SAO because it has obvious flaws that made it unplayable for me.  Your point that just because I did not like it does not make it overhyped is ignorant and short sighted, I never said \"I think its bad therefore overhyped\", I said \"It is a game with tons of flaws and there are way better alternatives therefore its overhyped\" which is correct, the game is ok but not hype worthy.\n\nNot to mention the translation NEEDS to be pointed out to people because all too often people like you praise it and bash anyone that dislikes it and avoid or downright lie about the issue of its shit translation.  I dont care if your localization budget is a fucking potato, you dont put out shit like this without being willing to get some hatred and backlash, and you dont stand up for companies that do this just because you feel for them and want more of their content.

The main topics you'll want to look into for a beginner on a Mandolin are probably the scales and the circle of fifths.\n\nBut I'll try to summarize what's relevant to this discussion...\n\nBasically it has to do with scales and at some point it's arbitrary how we decided to name each pitch (since the pitches have physically nothing to do with the letters we give them). You need a standard to start with. For some reason C major is the standard. Its scale is CDEFGABC. The major scale is made up of half steps and whole steps (whole = two half steps) in the pattern W W H W W W H. If you put the letters in there you get C [W] D [W] E [H] F [W] G [W] A [W] B [H] C.\n\nA whole step gives you room for a sharp/flat note in between the letters, but a half step doesn't leave any room for that, so you end up with the fact that there is nothing in between E-F and B-C.\n\nEvery other scale is based on this scheme. I'll pick one of the more \"complicated\" scales to demonstrate that the same pattern holds, and also because there's something interesting there.\n\nGb major and F# major are actually the same scale (Gb=F#), but in a different written key (which means they sound the same but when reading/playing you think about them in a different way).\n\nGb major:\n\nGb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb (Gb major has 6 flats, the only note that isn't flat is the F. You can make any pitch flat or sharp, even if it's the same pitch as another note, so Cb=B in the same way that F#=Gb). You'll see that the major scale pattern still applies.\n\nF# major:\n\nF# G# A# B C# D# E# F# (F# major has 6 sharps, with only B natural. If you look above, you'll notice that all of these pitches are alternate names for the other scale.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413351734", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Each of the voices makes perfect sense, but the middle chord has both an F# and a Gb!  However, that would be silly, because the upper note is actually an F#, the leading tone of G, which happens to resolve down to F instead of up.  Still, you *could* write it as a Gb.

{"body": "A long time ago they introduced cards into the game. The cards spelled out \"S 4 L E A G U e\" and if you got one of each you could exchange them for a unique skill with a negligible stat boost and a re skin (Golden metallic, surfboard anchor, black wings, etc.). Well some hackers figured out how to duplicate cards. You would need a minimum of 4 cards but it would take your most common card and change its value to all the others. So if I had 32 \"e\" cards then it would change all my cards values to 32 so I could receive 28 skill capsules. When they first introduced the card system it was a lego block. And there was no capsule chance bullshit involved. We could get a whole bunch of lego blocks and sell them for 7,500 PEN. I got one shitloads of PEN at that time.\n\nThere was also this hilarious glitch when they changed the code of capsules. If you got an Esper arcade capsule you would be able to open it infinitely because it never got rid of the capsule after you used it. Tons of bans were apparently handed out after that. Took them two months to finally hand out bans and they only banned the people use used to it make 100,000+ PEN. \n\nHonestly I would rather have the hacks be as they are now. Some guy who has 20 more HP than he should have is way better than the old super speed god mode hit you from across the map bullshit in Iron Eyes. \n\nNowadays hacking is super hard to spot and not very game breaking at all unless you play in beginner channel. Everyone is decked out in premium gear so its pretty balanced now. Cause if everyone has premium, then no one is premium.

{"body": "Let's start with RAID 0 and RAID 1. The Wikipedia article on standard raid levels explains this pretty well but I'll give a rundown \n\nIn raid 0 the data is split evenly between two disks. So if your data can be split into sections a1,a2,a3 and so on, it will right a1 to disk 1, a2 to disk 2, a3 to disk 1,a4 to disk 2 and so on. Basically it gives you double the write and read speeds since the hard drives work simultaneously and only have to deal with half as much data each. However, if one of your drives dies, all your data is lost. So you get faster read write speeds, but more risk of failure. \n\nIn raid 1, we have two disks and we write the same data to both. This has no effect on our performance, good or bad, but it provides redundancy. If one drive fails then you still have all your data. Please note that this is not a replacement for backing up your pc, since things like spilling coffee on your computer tends to cause both drives to fail ;). So raid 1 gives you redundancy, no effect on performance, but it cuts the size of your storage in half. 2 1tb drives in raid 1 have a total space of 1tb, since everything is written twice. \n\nRaid 5 is the next common level (if you're wondering about raid 2,3,4 you can look them up but they're generally not used, and for good reason). Raid 5 is a best of both worlds kind of thing. It requires at least 3 drives, but you can use any number of drives. Let's say that our data can be split into sections a b c d and so on. Each section can be split into subsections. For example, a can be split into a1 and a2 (up go n-1 if we have n drives). So on drive 1 we write a1. Then on drive 2 we write a2. Then on drive 1 we right b1 and we write b2 on drive 2 and so on. Our 3rd drive (or more generally our nth drive) is the parity drive. So after we write a1 and a2 to drives one and two, we would write ap to drive 3. Ap is calculated base on a1,a2,( and a3 and so on if we have more drives). Why have this ap? Well if we lose one drive, we can calculate what it's value was using ap and all the other a's. The same goes for the b's, c's, d's and so on. This gives us redundancy like raid 1, a performance boost like raid 0 (actually better than raid 0 since we have even more drives). Generally if we have n drives in raid 5, we get a speed up by a factor of n-1, a storage size of (n-1)*(size of each drive) and we can lose a drive without losing any data (again, not a substitute for regular backups!) so if you have 4 1tb hard drives, you get 3 times the read and write speeds (technically writes are a little slower than 3 times as fast since we need to do calculations for the parity), 3 tb of storage and one level of redundancy. \n\nThere's also raid 6, which is basically like raid 5 but with 2 parity drives (so you need at least 4 drives for this). IMHO that's overkill for personal use (though raid 5 is kinda already overkill ;)). \n\nAnyway, if this interests you I encourage you to research this.

{"body": "Let's start with RAID 0 and RAID 1. The Wikipedia article on standard raid levels explains this pretty well but I'll give a rundown \n\nIn raid 0 the data is split evenly between two disks. So if your data can be split into sections a1,a2,a3 and so on, it will right a1 to disk 1, a2 to disk 2, a3 to disk 1,a4 to disk 2 and so on. Basically it gives you double the write and read speeds since the hard drives work simultaneously and only have to deal with half as much data each. However, if one of your drives dies, all your data is lost. So you get faster read write speeds, but more risk of failure. \n\nIn raid 1, we have two disks and we write the same data to both. This has no effect on our performance, good or bad, but it provides redundancy. If one drive fails then you still have all your data. Please note that this is not a replacement for backing up your pc, since things like spilling coffee on your computer tends to cause both drives to fail ;). So raid 1 gives you redundancy, no effect on performance, but it cuts the size of your storage in half. 2 1tb drives in raid 1 have a total space of 1tb, since everything is written twice. \n\nRaid 5 is the next common level (if you're wondering about raid 2,3,4 you can look them up but they're generally not used, and for good reason). Raid 5 is a best of both worlds kind of thing. It requires at least 3 drives, but you can use any number of drives. Let's say that our data can be split into sections a b c d and so on. Each section can be split into subsections. For example, a can be split into a1 and a2 (up go n-1 if we have n drives). So on drive 1 we write a1. Then on drive 2 we write a2. Then on drive 1 we right b1 and we write b2 on drive 2 and so on. Our 3rd drive (or more generally our nth drive) is the parity drive. So after we write a1 and a2 to drives one and two, we would write ap to drive 3. Ap is calculated base on a1,a2,( and a3 and so on if we have more drives). Why have this ap? Well if we lose one drive, we can calculate what it's value was using ap and all the other a's. The same goes for the b's, c's, d's and so on. This gives us redundancy like raid 1, a performance boost like raid 0 (actually better than raid 0 since we have even more drives).

Death Grips made it popular in the indie circuit, Kanye took that style, reworked it so that it made sense in his oeuvre, and made it palatable to a mainstream audience, thus introducing the music listening world at large to this style of music. He didn't invent it but he made it his own and got other people to get into it.\n\nHe's effectively opened the door for newer more ambitious works to come in his wake and that's really all you need to be considered groundbreaking.

{"body": "Hi there! Saw that nobody commented so I guess I will go first. I will tell you what i think of your logo through 2 lenses; design only; and the design compared to other bands that your logo will be comoared to.I didnt look at your profile page initially. \n\nThe b&amp;w logo is pretty boring and confusing. I see the name clearly, but the lettering on top uses an overlapping technique that plays with a white stroke to make the letters readable, but the bottom is completely spaced out. To me, it would be like just writing \n\nWings \nD e n i e d.\n\nAlso i am not sure what is going on with the curved lines coming from the letters. What is significant about the lines? Why are they in that direction? Should they make a shape or are they more of a tribal element? This is what potential fans will think when they see your logo.\n\nPersonally, I really like the typeface you used for the band name, i would just change the spacing thing. Make them all overlap or spread the top out. I am not sure if i would drop the shapes on the E and on the ends of the W and S, but they do stick out unconfortably. \n\nNow, on the poster i see that you were touring with some heavier bands so if I have never heard of you and I am going to see (headliner band), but i see your name on the poster, I am going to look at your logo. Your logo should tell potential listeners about you. Band logos are tricky because you have to make a statement about how you sound, through your logo to draw in fans. Look at other bands logos that you associate with and see the elements they incorporate. \n\nAlso you might consider having a symbol. To use a band youre probably familiar with, Periphey has a certain typeface they write their band name in. Also the circles and the 3 dots, along with just the letter p can all be used to reference their band. This is good for brand recognition as well as marketing purposes. For your band, maybe you have some actual wings (overused, i know) like being severed off the name of your band. Or maybe you have a secondary logo of a W and a D. These are all things i would think about when you decide to redesign.\n\nAnd if you are getting big, i would consider redesigning sooner rather than later.\n\nThats just one internet person's opinion. Hope it helps. Also will be checking out your music now as well.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413432590", "subreddit": "design_critiques", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

They successively nerfed Her again and again and now she exists in a half way place between support and skirmisher. \n\nShe's picked in LCS because she's a \"safe pick\" she can defend herself against lee sin etc and other strong early junglers while providing early pressure. \n\nHowever in solo queue you will really have a hard time having an impact in the game. The change to ancient golem really hurt her and the continuous nerfs to her overall damage so now she exists where she struggles to make an impact because she can't build all the things she needs, she has to choose between boots: cdr boots (utility) sorc shoes (dmg) and merc treads (skirmishing / counter ganking). As it stands she really needs all three to actually be viable. \n\nAlso to boot she has no real late game impact. In LCS she has great catch potential with cocoon but let's be honest the follow up is instant in LCS and coordinated. It isn't in solo queue. \n\nAfter 25 minutes you are a walking cocoon. As for the \"high skill cap\" it's a bit of a myth tbh she takes longer to learn than other junglers yes but as soon as you can cycle through her combo your good. \n\nIf you do choose to learn her (she might be very good in new season because of item changes AND elise takes zero dmg in the jungle so can counter jungle really well) I would go cdr tank. It's more forgiving and will help you learn faster. \n\nThe main thing you need to learn are : when you hit a cocoon it is aa q w r w q. It can be done all within the stun time even at rank 1. The other thing is resetting turret aggro with rappel. And in team fights landing key cocoons is key but even more so is tanking AND getting them to waste as many key cooldowns as possible with rappel. \n\nHonestly though it's not worth the hassle ;p if u want early aggression go kha if you want utility go j4 and if you want dmg and utility tankiness go vi.

{"body": "Hi, good questions.\n\n&gt; why do you call the added note a b7?\n\nBecause it is b7 (minor seventh) above the root. You can use this terminology with any note, for example the \"b7 of A\" is G, the \"#4 of A\" is D# and so on.\n\n&gt; And just to check, do you mean Db7 = Db F Ab B ?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; I figured out that only one pair of notes in key forms a tritone\n\nYes, each major key contains only one tritone. This is why whenever we hear a tritone we immediately start thinking about the one key center that has this tritone.\n\n For example, if you're playing in C, and all of a sudden you play the chord **C7** (C E G Bb) with its tritone E Bb, it signals to the ear that you're about to transition to the key of F (the \"key of that tritone\"). Also notice that Bb is the one note that's different between the F major and C major scales; that's another way of thinking about how this tritone \"signals\" the key shift. \n\n&gt; why wouldn't F6 (IV6) be more common? Especially if we considered dropping the near-to-B 5th for F A B. Couldn't we get the same idea with I-IV6-I or something?\n\nI have no scientific proof of the following, it's just my observation, but when people hear clusters of notes our ears automatically try to \"untangle\" those clusters into stacks of notes separated by thirds. Our ears are really good at deducing the roots of chords even if those roots are buried in the middle voices of chords.\n\nJust as an example of this. If I played D F G B your ear would 'untangle' that into G, B, D, F and identify it as a G7 with G as the root. Even though G was in the middle of the chord.\n\nWhen you play F A B my ear untangles it as B, (missing D), F, A. In other words you have \"reinvented the wheel\" :P your chord is vii° and it does indeed lead to I.

{"body": "\"Despite our extensive coverage of harassment in the video game world, including a widely read piece by Brianna Wu, we haven't spoken out against GamerGate until now. We covered the more egregious examples of harassment mentioned above. We spoke to police departments and victims. But we didn't condemn the banner under which much of this hatred flew. And when inclusion in said mob is exactly 10 keystrokes away from anyone with a Twitter account — # g a m e r g a t e — it's not only hard but actually impossible to distill that mob's wishes down to any one thing. So we didn't. We were, and I specifically was, paralyzed by indecision. How do you condemn a mob without drawing attention to that same mob? For many of our staff, myself included, GamerGate presented enough of a perceived danger that we were scared for ourselves and our families. (Notable fact I remind myself of often: There are 14 children among the Polygon staff, including two under the age of 1).\n\nIf you consider yourself a GamerGate moderate, and are genuinely concerned with ethics in journalism, then I have some perhaps surprising news for you — you'd be hard-pressed to find a more interested party than the games press itself. Topics of ethics and disclosure are ... err, were frequently discussed on the GameJournoPros message board, of which I was a member. Disagreements were often the norm. Enough people had a differing view that someone shared the board's contents with a particularly one-sided journalist (who proceeded to publish the unedited logs, with email signatures and phone numbers for some members intact). Are critics of the list aware that journalists have \"conspired\" in this way for, literally, over a century? I live in Philadelphia, home of the Pen &amp; Pencil Club, a similarly private social club for journalists that's been in existence since 1892. This is where journalists from the Philadelphia Inquirer, a newspaper that won 17 Pulitzers in 15 years, would get drinks with journalists from competing papers and discuss, what else? Work.\n\nThe existence of familiarity among the games press is an issue, but not for the reasons GamerGate would argue. It's an issue insomuch as it inhibits new and diverse voices from joining the fray — I myself was taken to task by many of the people being attacked now over just this issue when we launched Polygon, and you know what? They were exceedingly right. But this isn't just an issue in the gaming press; it's an issue in journalism everywhere. Read this update from BuzzFeed's Ben Smith on how one of the fastest-growing media companies is tackling this challenge.\n\nSo yes, we take and have taken accusations of ethical impropriety seriously, and still find the accusations from GamerGate wanting.\n\nThis brings us to StopGamerGate2014, a hashtag started by freelance writer Veerender Jubbal on Tuesday night in response to the growing wave of threats against women in the industry. It quickly trended on Twitter. Indeed, some of the people who've spoken out against GamerGate, both using the StopGamerGate2014 hashtag and otherwise, have filled a vacuum that sites like Polygon left, helping to make people comfortable speaking out against the abuse. Andy Baio discusses this here and points out that, for supporters of GamerGate who've yet to recognize the toxicity of their platform, their \"best hope is that the silent are secretly on their side.\"\n\nSince Polygon launched in 2012, we've worked hard — thanks to the efforts of our tireless moderation team — to engender a safe space for our readers, writers and contributors. We have zero tolerance for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia ... any type of harassment or trolling on our site, which is laid out in our written community guidelines. While we've addressed aspects of the harassment that exists around it, we've been silent on GamerGate specifically. That ends today.\n\nVideo games are changing, and it's incredible! New technology, new devices, new marketplaces, new players — this is all transforming the entire world of video gaming under our collective feet. It's growing bigger. It's becoming more inclusive. This is a win-win scenario. Did you love The Last of Us? I don't think we'd have seen a character like Ellie just five years ago. What about The Walking Dead, a game with an African-American lead and a nuanced view of race?\n\nVideo games are capital \"C\" Culture now. There won't be less attention, only more. There won't be less scrutiny. There certainly won't be less diversity, in the fiction of games themselves or in the demographics of their players. What we're in control of is how we respond to that expansion, as journalists, as developers, as consumers. Step one has to be a complete rejection of the tools of harassment and fear — we can't even begin to talk about the interesting stuff while people are literally scared for their lives. There can be no dialogue with a leaderless organization that both condemns and condones this behavior, depending on who's using the hashtag.\n\nAttacks from the likes of Jack Thompson or Leland Yee only strengthened the resolve of gamers and unified our collective culture. But attacks from inside that same culture have led to worldwide media condemnation, a toxic dialogue and violent threats. People don't feel safe in their own homes. No need to jump at shadows of conspiracy or collusion, GamerGaters; you've already unearthed the most damaging force in video games today.\n\n— Christopher Grant, editor-in-chief\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413609576", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Work out how bad it is from that.\n\nyou can't work out how bad it is from that.  you must also include the 20% vat tax.  the  price you pay for petrol, which is double the going-rate by the presences of over 100% taxes.  and of course, you have to factot in the marshall money which was used as a foundation for it all, and which made the nhs even sustainable.  \n\n&gt; NHS is excellent for most people tbh, just check out surveys completed by brits that have used the service in the last 6 months. \n\nbritish cancer survival rates are a joke: cancer is still very much a death sentence in britain.\n\nanecdotal evidence: never once in my life have i ever met a woman bent over with osteoporosis in her late 40s, or her fifties, or in fact in modern times in the us.  i have seen women in such a state in the uk.  in fact, your caution signs to indicate 'elderly crossing' features bent over in half women.\n\nmore anecdotal evidence: i have never in my entire life in the u.s. come a cross a woman suffering with post-natal depression.  i have not only come across them in the u.k. i've met many women who suffered from it, but several who have been in the throes of post natal psychosis.\n\nstill more anecdotal evidence:  while living in britain a couple of years ago, i developed a somewhat painful condition in my hip.  soon it felt like my bones were rubber in that hip area and i started to limp funny.  i went to the doctor, very concerned.  was told i was just getting old.  knew that was wrong but didn't know what else to say, but then again i was going to the us in a couple of weeks.  was getting off the plane, going through customs and a man came up to me and said he was a doctor, but just an opthamologist, but nevertheless knew i had rickets from the way i was walking.  told me i needed to get to the doctor immediately.  an   o p t h a m o l o g i s t.  \n\nanother bit of anecdotal information: went to the doctor with what i knew was a strep infection.  reiterated verbally what was in my record: i am severely allergic to penicillin and its derivatives.  dr. told me he was going to give me something that was not a derivative, i said it was.  he said he was the doctor.  i took it and went into anaphylactic shock.  it was a penicillin derivative.  \n\nanother anecdote: friend was cutting up a chicken for dinner, sliced her hand to the bone, we called emergency to find out where to go.  was told the nearest nhs was closed, was told to drive to x location which was open.  drove there with friend's hand spurting blood through a terry cloth towel, with friend going white.  get to x location and it closed.  make frantic phone call and was told to go to y location.  get to y location, it was closed.  another call, told to go to our nearest location, which we did, and it had been open all the time.  total mileage = @75 miles.\n\nanother anecdote: @15 years ago, a childhood friend, married to a brit and living there, developed a tumor in her breast.  nhs told her she needed a radical masectomy of both breasts, which she could get in THREE MONTHS!!  she went to the u.s. and had a lumpectomy, a surgery unknown to the nhs at the time.  and that was it.  \n\ni have more, but let me just say, a user survey derived from a population whose culture inculcates 'mustn't grumble' doesn't impress me much.  look at the stats on cancer, check out the availability of surgeries when youre over 70, checkout the number of specialists in neurology, or cardiology across the entire country, and not just in london.  hell, just check out the number of nutritonists available to the average village.\n\n&gt;We have libraries in pretty much every town and city. We also have libraries that travel around and shit.\n\ni've seen those libraries; they are mostly what we would refer to as 'romance novels' and fiction.  and dvds.  and ?  in my town of 12,000, there is like zero anything else, and at the most 1500-2000 books.  without a laptop, a student really couldn't do any real research in the library using what few reference books exist.  you can not rely on your local library to provide you with non-fiction in the news, works on politics or current affairs.  \n\n&gt;Litter collection...... may have a point here. We do have our bins collected weekly though.\n\nyou have large bins collected weekly mostly empty, and from what i can tell, minimal if any  kerb recycling.  in california, it is fairly average to recycle everything - and i mean everything from the curb, including electronics, motor oils, batteries, as well as all paper, metals, plastics, in order to generate zero actual waste.\n\nbut that really wasn't my point.  there is no, as far as i can tell, municipal maintenance which attends to the massive amount of street litter in any town of any size.  parks littered with sandwich cardboard, cans, bottles ... and most appalling, chewed gum stuck any and everywhere.  i would think the high taxes would be able to cover some clean up, as well as some landscaping.  \n\n&gt;We have the safest roads in the developed world. Signage is excellent.\n\nu.k. auto deaths per million miles driven = 1.7\nu.s. auto deaths per million miles driven = 1.4\n\nsignage is not excellent, not in the countryside anyway.  it is unlit, and while charmingly victorian with iron posts, is completely useless until you are on top of them, and in a rain, cannot be seen at all.  and in the absence of cctv in the countryside, drivers frequently flaunt the laws, and drive recklessly.  it is no pleasure to drive in the britain.\n\n&gt;Education is excellent, I believe we have the most universities in the top 200 per capita. We are of middling rank before university. Something we are working on.\n\nbased on educators rankings across the world, of the top ten universities, 2 are british, 8 are american and the ratio doesn't change much in the top 100.  and again, anecdotal, and as a university prof.  i am troubled by the training i see walking into my classroom.  \n\n \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413671712", "subreddit": "MURICA", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; i - bVII - bVI - V, or sometimes more rarely as vi - V - IV - III. \n\nYou mean iv - bIII - bII - I, right?  The phrygian dominant mode is unstable, sure, but the I is the I.  I don't know why you'd call it III or V.  And those keys are only common when played on guitar because they're easy on guitar, but I usually fit my key to the group I'm writing for.\n\nI personally think that progression is a bit clichéd.  I've written it quite a bit, especially when writing Spanish music, because it's *so* Spanish, but I think it's so Spanish that it's become a cliché for Spain, along with Flamenco-style guitar.  But one thing you can definitely take from this progression is that awesomeness that is the Spanish scale.  It's the 5th mode of minor, both in harmonic and melodic forms!  F minor is F G Ab Bb C D E F Eb Db C Bb Ab G F, right?  The chords are Fm, Gdim, Ab, Bbm, C, Db Eb/Edim, Fm.  Well, when you're in the Spanish scale in C, the scale goes C D E F G Ab Bb C Bb Ab G F Eb Db C, with the chords being C Db Eb Fm Gm7b5, Ab, Bbm, C.  In particular, the bottom 4 notes go C D E F Eb Db C.  One of my favorite parts of playing in this mode is that I can write Eb Db C over a C major chord and enjoy that conflict between the Eb in the melody and the E in the C major chord.  By the way, the Spanish scale should be thought of as an alteration of *phrygian dominant*.  So the lower 4 notes of C phrygian dominant would go C Db E F E Db C.  The C Spanish scale raises the b2 on the way up and lowers the 3 on the way down, so it becomes C D E F Eb Db C, but the \"natural\" form is C Db E F.\n\nWhen I'm writing in this mode (or, more often, phrygian dominant), I don't use the full Andalusian cadence too much because of how clichéd it is, but I do use V - I progressions quite frequently.  The nice thing about this mode is that there's no V chord, but there are dominant equivalents.  bII and bvii are the main ones, but they're all really variations on the Vø7 chord.  In C, the bII is Db F Ab, the bvii is Bb Db F, and the Vø7 is Gm7b5: G Bb Db F.  The Db and F are leading tones together, the Db going to C and the F going to E.  Note that these three chords basically have the same notes.  When writing the bII chord, unless I'm writing the Andalusian cadence, I usually lower the 5th to be the #4 (not b5), so in C it would be Db F G.  This resolves to C E G, in very characteristic Spanish style.  In this way, the chord is an incomplete inverted Gm7b5, and the voice leading is very smooth.  To get to the I, you can even combine two of these and make one into a predominant chord.  The ii - V - I pattern in major becomes, in phrygian dominant, bII - Vø7 - I.  There's not a lot of motion there, since bII is a dominant equivalent chord, but it still works.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413672658", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In graphics, 8-bit refers to the amount of bits per pixel. 8-bit means the image is limited to a 256 color image palette. Animations (like the refraction in the water) was done by animating slots in the palette. In this instance the image is a gif, so it's 8-bit. 24bit images have 1 byte per color per pixel, so 0-255 for each channel. This is how hex-colors in HTML/CSS works; 00-FF represents 0-255, so `#FFFFFF` is white because each channel is set to 255 (max). (Hex is based on 16, so 0-9 A B C D E F instead of 0-15). New monitors and graphics cards often support more than 24-bit colors; the new ones are often 30-bit or more. Won't fit in with the whole decimal thing as well (which is why I would say that it should be RGB(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) instead; a value between 0 and 1 which would support deep color without new implementation) \n\nOn computers, the amount of bits refers to the word length of the CPU, meaning how big integers it can work with at a time. A 8-bit processor can only handle a number between `0 - 255` for every instruction (ignoring negatives for simplicity's sake), 16-bit `0 - 65 536`, 32-bit `0 - 4 294 967 296` and a 64-bit `0 - 9 223 372 036 854 775 807`. It has nothing to do with the amount of RAM it can address, although that can be an indirect consequence. For instance an 8-bit CPU addresses more than 256 bytes of RAM by splitting a 16-bit address into two; low-bits (the first 8 bits) and high-bits (the last 8 bits) and use that as an address. A 16-bit processor typically has 20 bits of addressable space (apparently because the inventors at the time felt 4 GB was too much and 64k was too little), it was sectioned into a scheme referred to as segment-offset (SEG:OFF). 32-bit computers (contrary to popular belief) can actually address much more than 4GB RAM using a technology called PAE (Physical Address Extension) because the memory model is virtual via Protected Mode (and not flat, or \"real\").", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413734194", "subreddit": "gifs", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Learning a little music theory will go a long way for you, but I understand that it takes a lot of time and energy, and it can be pretty boring in the beginning.\n\nBasically, if you look at a piano, you start at C, then all the white keys go D E F G A B and back to C.\n\nThis the scale for the key of C Major. If you start on D, then E F# A B C# D\nthe notes F# and C# are black keys - also called accidentals.\n\nWhen I say to make sure your melody is in the same key as the song - what I am really saying is, in most western music, a song has a key, and ALL OF THE NOTES THAT ARE PLAYED are limited to that key.\n\nSo, for example, if you are in the key of D, you should not play a regular F or a regular C - you are always supposed to play F# and C#. If you make sure that you do not play notes outside of your key, the song will generally sound like it \"belongs\".  Once you get the hang of this, you can bend the rules and play an off note here and there for color - but that is a rare exception.\n\nAlso, you can change keys within a song, but from that point forward - all new notes should obey the new key. There are also strategies on how to change keys and make it sound good, but that is an advanced music theory topic. For now, figure out what key you are in. You can do this by looking at the notes of your song, and plugging them into this calculator: http://www.scales-chords.com/scalefinder.php\n\nHowever, if it can't determine your key, its probably because you are not IN a key.

{"body": "Nobody but the players can change things. You need to unionize in some way. Unfortunately, the reason tournaments are unprofessional is because the players themselves mostly remain unprofessional and on the level of teenagers. Nobody takes teenagers seriously. I'm sorry to say but it's true. Would you take the demands of SingSing seriously. What's he gonna do? Say \"OH MY GAAAAAWD\" and suddenly you'll pay him and treat him well?\n\n\nThe only way to sort Dota out is to demand a level of professionalism and enforce standards on players, admins, organizers, managers. None of this casual crap - as fun as it is, at the moment it makes this whole thing look like a teenagers house party or more like a kid who just won the lotto. Yeah, you guys are living the dream and travelling the world (be happy) but this isn't some Kontiki tour. \n\nAt the moment we're at this strange intermediate stage. We have a veneer of high quality production and tournies but it's only a veneer because people can look at pretty overlays and shout \"THEY'RE ALL DED\" and think this means E-Sports is professional now. But it isn't. Constant delays, players drama, admin drama, shady organizer drama, never starting on time, never any communication when matches delayed, no good communication, players not getting paid, hosts/casters sometimes being untrained idiots and get to their position through le reddit popularity rather than an actual talent etc etc etc.\n\nAnd what makes it worse is the pandering to the epic may may memesters. As much as I enjoy spamming Twitch chat, it ends there for me, but for others it's almost like their life sitting there hoping for RTZ to type \" X X X B O Y S\" or some shit. So you have a vocal minority of twits making up the viewership - leading people to think that this gig can never be top tier professional because it's viewers want shitty low level may may's.\n\nOf course, I understand it will be hard to raise the level of professionalism without a leader. This is where Valve needs to step in, though unfortunately I get the feeling that GabeN is really hands off in that regard which is strange but he is a billionaire so he knows his business decisions better than I do. But someone needs to step in and demand a much higher level of professionalism. That means absolute set rules across all organizations, all tournaments, all players. And when people fail to meet them, the viewers must also vote with their feet. \n\nThis type of shit would never happen if Dota were played and organized by 40 year olds. They wouldn't stand for it. I'm not saying video games make you a kid. But sitting streaming all day \"living the dream\" takes you out of reality somewhat - it takes you out of the professional zone and you all just sit around like buddies at a house LAN. Everyone will benefit a lot more if things get sorted out properly. It will take a year or so, and in that year there will be much drama, but on the other side of that it will be lovely... But it needs the players to stand up. Unfortunately, I don't think they will.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413786985", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ap kog main here in season 3. He is pretty strong but there are numerous factors why he's not as strong as he used to be, notably the nerf to his r damage. While on paper, it doesn't seem a lot but early game, every bit of sustained damage counts. You will still be a monster come level 16 and wave clearing is very easy with him once you hit lvl 7 but he just lost a lot of early pressure which is almost non existent to begin with. No roaming power, extremely blue dependent, the list goes on. \n\nIf you still decide to play him though, I believe there are two ways of playing him: r spam mana/cdr/mpen build or lichbane build. The former makes use of tear, chalice, liandry and maybe rylais. The latter, the one I'm more used to, build tear, guise then an Ap item, lichbane after. It's a lot more risky but it gives you a spammable burst which still puts you in a relatively safe distance because of  the range of your bioarcane. \n\nRunes : hybrid marks, hp seals or armor (depending on lane) Ap per lvl glyphs and Ms quints. \n\nMasteries: 21/0/9 (moves peed and mana focused) \n\nStarting items: dorans ring 2 reds and trinket. \n\nSkill: w e e w e r Max r, max e, max q. \n\nItems: tear boots haunting guise sorc boots rabbadon lichbane then itemize depending on what they have. \n\nFlash and ghost. \n\nThis setup allows you to clear caster minions at lvl 7 with e+r combo. I used to run roa in place of the haunting guise and you can do this if you're having mana issues until you at least get a feel how he works. Your job is to poke the enemies even before a clash happens, just like how nidalee was. Once you have your lichbane, you will then need to weave your r with auto attacks so always be aware of your positioning. \n\nDone on my phone so if you have questions just message so I can try and help out more when I get on my computer.

{"body": "&gt; Ear training, how would I do that?\n\nHere's a great list of jazz ear training exercises that get progressively more difficult, taken from David Baker's book *Jazz Improvisation*. Some of them require a partner, but sometimes you can modify them to be done solo. This'll help you enormously with transcribing as well.\n\n\n***\n\n1. The player should practice singing and recognizing intervals. He should have someone play intervals for him while he names them. He should name intervals and sing them. The player should play a note on his instrument, then name any other note and sing it.\n\n2. He should extend the interval practice by playing a note, then arbitrarily naming eight or ten other intervals — each interval measured from the last interval. Example: play C, say Major 3rd, sing E, say tritone, sing Bb, say Major 3rd, sing D, etc. At the end of a given period of time he should play a note on his instrument to check for accuracy.\n\n3. Next the player should practice singing triads of any quality starting on a common tone. (For example, sing Ab. Then, using that as a root, sing major, minor, augmented, and diminished triads.)\n\n4. Next he should do the sme exercise using the different quality seventh chords. (For example, sing Ab as the root. Then sing major seventh, minor seventh, dominant seventh, and half-diminished seventh chords.)\n\n5. He should now use ninths, elevenths, thirteenths, etc.\n\n6. Next the player should do the triads, sevenths, ninths, elevenths, etc., altering various tones in the chords, e.g., Cmaj9 with a raised 5th, Bbmi7(b9), C13(+11), etc.\n\n7. Using a single note as the axis the player should sing chords in their inversions. Example: Sing Ab, then sing the rest of an E major triad. Now the Ab is the 5th of a Db major triad. Ab is now the 7th of a Bb7 chord. Now Ab is the 9th of a Gb major chord, etc.\n\n8. Next the player should practice all chords and triads in all inversions, ascending and descending. [Note: he includes 9ths and above. For example, for Cmaj9 he writes C E G B D, D E G B C, E G B C D, G B C D E, etc]\n\n9. Next he should practice recognizing the material in exercises three through ten when somebody else plays them; also name the inversion, etc.\n\n10. He must be able to sing scales of any quality (i.e. major, diminished, whole tone, etc.)\n\n11. The player should sing any quality scale starting on any degree of the scale. For example, sing a major scale starting on the second degree or the sixth degree, etc.\n\n12. He should sing the diatonic triads, seventh chords, ninth chords, etc. on the various scales, ascending and descending. Example: the seventh chords of C melodic minor, ascending, are C Eb G B, D F A C, Eb G B D, F A C Eb, etc.\n\n13. He should sing the diatonic triads, seventh chords, ninth chords, etc. starting from any degree on the scale. Example: the seventh chords of C melodic minor, ascending, starting on the 3rd degree, are Eb G B D, F A C Eb, G B D F, A C Eb G, etc.\n\n14. He must be able to recognize any of the material in exercises eleven through fourteen when played by another person.\n\n15. He should sing the diatonic seventh chords built on any scale degree. He should sing all inversions before moving on to the next step. Example: C melodic minor would be C Eb G B, Eb G B C, G B C Eb, B C Eb G, D F A C, F A C D, A C D F, C D F A, etc.\n\n16. I recommend that the player devise other similar exercises.\n\n17. The player should take a bass line off a record, perhaps a blues or other relatively simple tune.\n\n18. The player should move on to more complex bass lines, then to solo lines.\n\n19. Once the player is far enough along to deal with solo lines, I recommend that he dispense with writing the solos down. Instead, he should play and memorize the solos directly from the record. At all times, he should draw on his complete fund of knowledge, using reason and logic to help the hear. For example, if he just recognized a D minor seventh chord he should be suspicious that the next chord might be a G7. he should also suspect a II V7 progression before the final chord of the piece, etc.\n\n20. If possible he should now enlist the aid of another player and play follow the leader. At first he should avoid playing on an actual set of chord changes. He should just play at random and imitate the leader. He should start with brief closely related phrases and proceed to longer, more complex phrases.\n\n21. When the player feels comfortable with number 20, then he should practice his listening technique on a relatively static type of tune: blues, So What, Maiden Voyage, etc. Phrases should be chosen that enable the second player to complete the phrase at the same pitch level as the first player. The first and second players should exchange roles frequently.\n\n22. Next the players should proceed to the question and answer type playing where the answer is duplicated but at a different pitch level.\n\nTwenty-two should also proceed from the simple to the complex. As a daily exercise the player might take for our five different tunes in random keys and play through them very slowly without stopping to correct mistakes. He should strive to hear the interval and/or the position of the note in the scale before he plays it. This also applies to hearing any familiar patterns or chord outlines that live within the tune. This pre-hearing has to take place without distorting the tempo. As the player gains confidence he should strive to play each tune at the correct tempo. The player should make sure the keys he chooses for the various tunes are diverse so as to develop equal facility in all keys. If the player has access to a tape recorder, he should record the tunes and play them, making notes of the intervals or chords most frequently missed. He should then strive to improve his hearing and recognition of these intervals or chords.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413845522", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No, because the 7 letter system is designed to match what we think sounds good. Almost all western music that is widely popular uses the major scale (or a related mode) which has 7 notes arranged in the pattern of the white keys of the piano (C D E F G A B). The point of the 7 letter system is that any such scale has 1 of each letter name (so, for example, A-flat major has Ab Bb C Db Eb F G). If we had only 6 letter names spaced in whole tones, that would actually make it *more* complicated to represent the scales that we actually use.\n\nThe point is that the chromatic scale (12 notes per octave) is less musically relevant than the diatonic scale.

{"body": "I've done this at least a dozen times now and have just hosted my first cocktail party in my home last Saturday so I have a lot of thoughts about efficiency.  I'll try to be concise and hopefully it will help.  There's lots of questions I have that may help me offer more specific advice.  \n\nTo answer your question, as many have said, throwing out the shaker (or mixing glass) contents when you're done into something (like a bucket or trash can) is ideal, as is having water to rinse a little.  I use a 3 gallon beverage dispenser that I keep behind me when I'm working.  I fill it with warm water which helps a little bit more to get egg white residue and bits of herb leaves off the cold metal shakers.  The only time I don't throw out the contents, which is very rare, is if I'm low on ice (plan for more than you need, like /u/ericatha said), and only do it with a similar or same cocktail, and strain out any left over liquid before you make the second cocktail.  That should be a last resort.  \n  \n\nQuestions + commentary for you:    \n\n* Are you handling money at the bar for drinks?  If you can avoid it somehow, that will increase your efficiency.  I have done this by tickets or poker chips and having a separate area where people can buy drink chips/tickets.  This is can be a big time killer if you are the only person at the bar and trying to make drinks while remembering what people ordered and closing out other people.  \n* Do you have an actual bar (only ask because you wrote \"bartending\" so to speak) or do you have control over the place you're serving?  This can impact efficiency, but you may not have any choice.  I have had good experience keeping a specific cooler for ice for drinks.  Keep other things that need to be cool in a separate one to not accidentally get something in the ice that will go in all the drinks.  \n* How many cocktails were you thinking for the menu?  Selecting depends on the crowd.  Is this a vodka/cran and whisky/ginger crowd or is this a Last Word and Corn and Oil kind of crowd?  Or maybe the menu is already set by the host of the party?  Some groups gravitate towards vodka and if you have mostly whisky drinks on the menu you could be under prepared.  My experience has been to pick at least one of each spirit (one with vodka, one with gin, one with whisky/bourbon, one with a rum etc) and that seems to work well most of the time.  I have put more complicated things on a menu as well as not much variety if I know the crowd and have a better idea of what people are going to want to drink. \n* Is prebatching or a punch an option?  If so, do it.  It has saved me and seriously increases efficiency.  Like others have said, it is a great way to save time.  Punch is nice too if you have a way of serving it; it looks pretty and is super easy to ladle some in a glass over ice.  For prebatching you can do it one of two ways.  (1) I usually make a liter of a cocktail with no dilution.  Then when I get an order of the menu for a Boulevardier, I pour 3 oz of the prebatched liter into a mixing glass of ice, stir and strain.  (If you're picking one with citrus juice, add it right before the party starts not days ahead of time.  Or you could just keep it separate and add when you mix.) (2) You can dilute it when you prebatch and then keep it cold.  Then you just pour out however much you are serving into a glass and garnish.  \n* List of tools you have or need?   This will depend on the menu.  I typically keep 2 mixing glasses and 2 shakers in use.  Two mixing spoons at least.  Garnish tools (peeler, channel knife), muddler if you need it, jiggers.  Look at the post by /u/hebug and check out that set up, it's pretty damn good.  Simple and efficient.  Having backup tools are helpful too in case something breaks, which is unlikely but it happens.  \n* When shit gets real busy, remember to breathe and look around and have fun.  If you are in a good mood and happy with what you're doing, even when you have 2 drinks in progress and 8 more in line, it will show and people will enjoy their experience of watching you make things for them and other people.  And you'll probably get some more tips.  \n* Having a towel in your belt behind your back is absolutely a m a z i n g.  Again, depending on the crowd and how busy you are and what the menu is, you're hands are probably going to get very very messy.  \n*  Always have a few drink ideas in your 'back pocket' that are off menu with the ingredients you have.  People ALWAYS come up and say \"surprise me\" or \"just make me anything\" or \"what do you drink\".  Having something off menu will help make them feel special, maybe give you some more tips and will impress people with your skills.  \n\nI can write more later if you have more questions or want more info as most of this was typed furiously during my lunch hour.  Hope it helps!  I wish I was here on this subreddit years ago when I started taking this hobby to the next level.  Maybe I'll post my battlestation this week now that I have it set up!  \n\nCheers!  \n\nedits for grammar and adding forgotten info...\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413916421", "subreddit": "cocktails", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; So all your saying is that it's not guaranteed or even likely that you get the exact sequence of M M H M M H?\n\nSort of.\n\nI'm saying that with a 65% of dodge, on any particular run, say HLM Day 1, you do not actually dodge 65% of shots.  The number can be way less or it can be way more.  If you were to log ever shot you ever took over every run you ever made, then yes, you would see that you dodge about 65% of shots, but all those other runs don't matter on this particular HLM run.\n\nOn it's own, this info doesn't really matter and it's purely an academic exercise, but there is frequently a debate on this sub about armor vs. dodge.  Most of the pro-dodge support I see equates 1 pt of dodge mitigation to 1 pt of armor mitigation, but they assume that dodge mitigation is the same 65% on every run, which it is not.  You'll see this phrased as \"65% of shots will miss\" or something like that.\n\nPeople then see these arguments, don't properly evaluate the math, and fail to realize that 65% only applies in the aggregate, across all runs, and not to any specific heist.  You can never count on dodging 65% of shots at any particular moment in time.  Sure, you'll *probably* dodge them, but there is no guarantee.  \n\nYour second paragraph does this sort of thing explicitly.  This is the kind of math I'm talking about:\n\n&gt;Anyways, if it takes X shots to go down with a suit then you're basically talking about needing X/.35 shots to bring you down on average. Compare it to Y which is the larger number of shots needed to break armor and down you in an ICTV or whatever.\n\nBecause it compares 1 unit of something that works 65% of the time to 1 unit of something that works 100% of the time.  What happens on average is irrelevant to *this moment in time*.  You're effectively mixing units.  \"X/.35\" is an average.  \"Y\" is a hard value at this particular moment in time, which is what is important when you are getting shot at *right now.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413925468", "subreddit": "paydaytheheist", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh dear. I leave for the day to go care for my Aged P., and this is what I return to?  I did not mean to start a brawl. Civil discourse anyone?\n\nI brought this up as I saw the word used incorrectly in three posts that I read in one morning.  I was in a hurry, but it appears I should have phrased this post differently.  I love words and language. This post was not about enunciation as I was commenting on the regular use the word written as skiddish in this sub.  My intent was not to criticize people for using the word, but rather to educate them as to the correct word.  What makes me sad about the prevalence of that word is that I feel that it is more than a misspelling, but rather a case of having learned the word incorrectly.  That would mean the users probably do not relate the word to skitter, and doing so would give more nuance to the meaning of the word. Knowing the roots and origins of words adds so much.  Consider the example below of free rein/reign.   Creates an entirely different visual, does it not?  I thought that maybe some people might find it interesting to learn what the correct word is.\n\nI like to use words correctly.  And if I am not, I don't mind someone kindly pointing my error out to me.  I don't think constructive criticism has to sink to a competitive, insulting, condescending, name calling, superiority challenge that seem to be part and parcel of many Internet forums.\n\nConsider this.  If someone tells you that they just had their new dog \"spaded\", what is your reaction? Do you cringe a little inside?  Think a little less of them, or at least of their grasp on vocabulary? Or can you gloss right over the mistake, assume they have never seen the word in print or heard it used correctly, and not have it bother you the least bit? Or are you somewhere in between?  For this example, let's go with a reaction of, \"Poor dear.  I can't believe they don't know that word.  How embarrassing for them.\"\n\nSo, if you were that \" poor dear\", would you rather be spared the embarrassment of having your mistake pointed out to you, or would you appreciate being taught the correct word?  Of course that answer might depend on whether your \"teacher\" said, \"Good for your for being a responsible pet owner! You might find this interesting...Did you know that that surgical procedure is called a spay...S P A Y, so when it has been performed the past tense is spayed...S P A Y E D?  So \"spaded\" actually has an extra \"ed\" on it...and how is your pup recovering?\"  or, \"You had your dog spaded?! Whatcha do, hit her on the head with a shovel? Idiot!\"\n\nBut my point is, can we not consider the possibility that if someone points out that we are misusing a word, perhaps they think they are being helpful and that we may even appreciate it rather than just getting angry and defensive?\n\nExcuse me for going off a bit..

In computing gradiants it has to basically compute dC/dW (deriv of cost function wrt weight matrix) over all minibatches and average the results.  dC/dW itself is computed from an outer product and while computing it in gnumpy one has, at intermediate stages, an M x n x m matrix (assuming W is n x m).  Taking e.g. M=1000, n,m~200 would give ~160 mb a layer which is a lot of GPU memory.  Taking smaller minibatches (e.g. 100) and the GPU does not seem faster than my CPU.  I think in principle one could hand-code the GPU code to not use this much extra memory by looping over the minibatches and computing a running average of dC/dW but doing this via gnumpy it turns out to be slower than doing it on the CPU.  I suspect that in computing dC/dW gnumpy has to allocate a lot of GPU memory and this counters any speedup one gets from the GPU but since my setup seems to be a completely standard one I'm a bit frustrated that I can't get more mileage from the GPU.\n\nWhile there are many details to my problem my question is more about how one avoids excessive memory allocation at intermediate steps in gradient computations for minibatches on the GPU.

It’s a land bridge between Turkey to the north and Egypt to the south. If you look on a map, however, in the near exact middle of the nations that comprise the Levant, guess what you see? Come on, guess!  It’s Israel.\nWhen Barack Obama refers over and over to the Islamic State as ISIL, he is sending a message to Muslims all over the Middle East that he personally does not recognize Israel as a sovereign nation, but as territory belonging to the Islamic State.\nNow you know why Obama says that he has no plan, no goal, and no stated aim for dealing with ISIS.But he does have a plan, and it’s a really nasty, diabolical one. Obama’s plan is to drag his feet for as long as he can, doing only the bare minimum that Congress forces him to do. His “plan”to buy ISIS as much time as possible to make as many gains as they can.\nListen as Obama and his press secretary and the spokesperson for the State Department and his Joint Chief's of Staff painstakingly spells out the letters\nI-S-I-L so there is no doubt in your mind:\nAnd it’s working.\nThe Islamic State has garnered millions of dollars, a vast cache of weapons, and in their latest forayhave captured Syrian fighter jets and now 12 commercial passenger planes. With each passing day that Obama fulfills his stated aim of doing nothing, the Islamic State grows by leaps and bounds. The ultimate goal, of course, has not changed and will never change.\nThe ultimate goal is the destruction of Israel.\nNow you know a little bit more why Obama chooses his words so carefully, and what’s really in a name. Shakespeare had it right.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1413998529", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is very situational, and I will try to explain.\n\n**Lina Support - Fiery Soul**\n\nAs a support, there is a fine line between Lina as a nuker and Lina as a semi-carry. If you're playing a true support Lina (the kind where you're ~5 levels behind your carry), then I do not put my 2nd point into Fiery Soul until I have the proper items. At the beginning of the game, you are a nuker. This is what I would do until level 11:\n\nW Q Q W Q R, Q E W W R\n\n...which is very normal, right? Now it depends on what items I have. If I'm a poor support and still only have boots + 1 utility item (Force/Eul/Blink), then I will level: + + + + R (+ is stats), keeping that value point into Fiery Soul and that's it. I'm still just a nuker who's meant to hit and run, and I don't have the survivability to take advantage of my maxed rank Fiery Soul. Having stats here is useful because you 1) may survive enough to get another Q off to kill someone 2) still have brown boots and need the extra mana pool.\n\nNow, if my team is doing well and I have quite a bit more farm, such as Phase Boots + Drums, and it looks like I will transition into a semi-carry faster than normal, then I will level: E E E + R. Fiery Soul on Lina is NOT to be ignored, but you should not blindly max it in the wrong situation. Avoid the Reddit hype train and have the courage to level stats when needed.\n\nOther examples include Sven support (you don't need cleave early) and Wraith King support (you need mana early and don't need crit early). To a lesser extent than Lina, as a core Juggernaut going Aghanim first I do not level my crit until I get another damage item. The early pushing power from ward is very useful and so are the stats.

Which means, I'm okay for a sad ending... as long as its good.\n\n####SPOILERS BELOW\n\nLike at the end of **D E A T H N O T E**. When Kira finally dead. I didn't want him to die... but it felt just right. That mother fucker had it coming. And look at DEATHNOTE now. Everyone raves about it. Its become a legend. A mark of excellence. A seal of approval. A standard of greatness. And you can watch it over and over again, from beginning to end and still love it.\n\nOn the other hand... look at **D E X T E R**. The Showtime show about a serial killer. After 8 seasons, that mother fucker got away. He lost nothing... Nothing that really mattered to him... his life. And that ruined the whole premise. He was supposed to get caught. He was the mastermind that was suppose to lose everything at the end. He was supposed to die a horrible death. But due to greedy fucking ~~pigs~~ producers and horrible writers he didn't get what he deserved. And now I am forever angry at that series for wasting my time. I will think twice if not thrice before I watch a show on Showtime ever again.\n\n---\n\nThe thing with Kishi is... people call him a troll for his plot twists. But he foreshadows everything he does.

[**Move notation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube#Move_notation) of article  [**Rubik%27s Cube**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s%20Cube): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Many 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by [David Singmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Singmaster) to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \"Singmaster notation\".  Its relative nature allows [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *F* (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n\n&gt;* *B* (Back): the side opposite the front\n\n&gt;* *U* (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n\n&gt;* *D* (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube\n\n&gt;* *L* (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n\n&gt;* *R* (Right): the side directly to the right of the front\n\n&gt;* *ƒ* (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *b* (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *u* (Up two layers) : the top side and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *d* (Down two layers) : the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *l* (Left two layers) : the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *r* (Right two layers) : the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *x* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *R*\n\n&gt;* *y* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *U*\n\n&gt;* *z* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *F*\n\n&gt;When a [prime symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol\\)) ( ′ ) follows a letter, it denotes a face turn counter-clockwise, while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. A letter followed by a 2 (occasionally a superscript ^2) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. *R* is right side clockwise, but *R'* is right side counter-clockwise. The letters *x*, *y*, and *z* are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When *x*, *y* or *z* are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees.\n\n&gt;The most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \"w\", for \"wide\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of *Rw* is equivalent to one of *r*. \n\n&gt;For methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods) there is a generally accepted \"MES\" extension to the notation where letters *M*, *E*, and *S* denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm. \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *M* (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)\n\n&gt;* *E* (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)\n\n&gt;* *S* (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F\n\n&gt;The 4×4×4 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (*F B U D L R*) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (*f b u d l r*) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parenthesis (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (*Rr*)' *l*2 *f*' means to turn the two rightmost layers counterclockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer counterclockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.\n\n&gt;An alternative notation, [Wolstenholme notation](http://www.topaccolades.com/notation/rubikscube.htm), is designed to make memorizing sequences of moves easier for novices. This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants. The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A and I for clockwise, counterclockwise and 180-degree turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU′R′UL′U′RU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Rubik's ^Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) ^| [^Speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) ^| [^Rubik's ^Cube ^in ^popular ^culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_in_popular_culture) ^| [^Cube ^\\(algebra)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_\\(algebra\\)) ^| [^Rubik's ^Cube ^group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_group) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+clh9nw2) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+clh9nw2)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414037237", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It doesn't take into account \"playing better\", it's explained on the right hand side.\n\nThe basic logic of these calculations is simple: any team that does well in world football wins points which enable it to climb the world ranking.\n\nA team’s total number of points over a four-year period is determined by adding:\n\n·   the average number of points gained from matches during the past 12 months;\nand\n\n·   the average number of points gained from matches older than 12 months (depreciates yearly).\n\nCalculation of points for a single match\n\nThe number of points that can be won in a match depends on the following factors:\n\n•      Was the match won or drawn? (M)\n\n•      How important was the match (ranging from a friendly match to a FIFA World Cup™ match)? (I)\n\n•      How strong was the opposing team in terms of ranking position and the confederation to which they belong? (T and C)\n\nThese factors are brought together in the following formula to ascertain the total number of points (P).\n\nP = M x I x T x C\n\n \n\nThe following criteria apply to the calculation of points:\n\nM:        Points for match result\n\nTeams gain 3 points for a victory, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a defeat. In a penalty shoot-out, the winning team gains 2 points and the losing team gains 1 point.\n\nI:           Importance of match\n\n      Friendly match (including small competitions):                                                    I = 1.0\n\n      FIFA World Cup™ qualifier or confederation-level qualifier:                             I = 2.5\n\n      Confederation-level final competition or FIFA Confederations Cup:                I = 3.0\n\n      FIFA World Cup™ final competition:                                                                    I = 4.0\n\nT:         Strength of opposing team\n\n      The strength of the opponents is based on the formula: 200 – the ranking position of the opponents\nAs an exception to this formula, the team at the top of the ranking is always assigned the value 200 and the teams ranked 150th and below are assigned a minimum value of 50. The ranking position is taken from the opponents’ ranking in the most recently published FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking.\n\nC:            Strength of confederation\n\nWhen calculating matches between teams from different confederations, the mean value of the confederations to which the two competing teams belong is used. The strength of a confederation is calculated on the basis of the number of victories by that confederation at the last three FIFA World Cup™ competitions (see following page). Their values are as follows:\n\nCONMEBOL 1.00\nUEFA 0.99\nAFC/CAF/OFC/CONCACAF 0.85\n\nhttp://www.fifa.com/worldranking/procedureandschedule/menprocedure/index.html)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414064512", "subreddit": "soccer", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

(Even if you do, it's from reading psych texts, not from experience, am I right?)\n\nWhat about how quickly you react to change in stimulus when you're drunk?\n\nAs I see it, we only perceive time relatively, and even that, only when our brain is in healthy (sober) working condition.\n\nRealistically, when we do something like swing a bat to hit the ball being thrown at us, we know when and how to swing through (painstakingly) learned *relative* predictions of where the ball will be, and when.\n\nHow could we be encoding these time-dependent sequences in a way that's somehow constant? We have no internal reference clock and no way to timestamp memories. All we have is a semi-flexible \"*most* neurons can fire an action potential *approximately* every 5ms\". It's safe to say the timeliness of a given sequence of events must be learned in a way which abstracts us from this.\n\n&gt; A sequence, to me, is like a rubber band that can stretch and shrink while maintaining proportionality.\n\nAgreed. To the HTM, this proportionality might be learned in higher levels: A B C is a different sequence from A A A A B B B B C C C C to some extent, similar only via proportion (as you said). A bear moving in slow motion would look very strange to us indeed (and wouldn't activate the same response as a bear moving at full speed).\n\n\nMy question is:\n&gt; There are some deterministic rules in the way sequences change relative to one another...\n\nWhat do you mean by this?

I think it's important to remind yourself the pain and hurt that person could be going through before generalizing EVERYONE to be \nsuperficial that has a \"certain look\". Does that make sense in a way?\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of teenagers like yourself. Going through the same exact \"I'm better than you\" mentality. The difference between you and them is you have noticed. That's huge! You want to change that about yourself! I can tell you, with confidence, you will not have these thoughts forever. You won't be \"growing out\" of it, but rather transforming into the person you want to be. It just takes self-awareness, different surroundings, and sometimes even a close friend to slap you on the back of the head every once and a while. \n\nI'll leave you with this- nothing stays the same forever. Damn man, I think you're pretty fucking awesome regardless of your IQ. That's not what I judge a person on. It's the hustle and effort to be better every day (in my book). So keep it up.

{"body": "I feel as though you took my 'targeted for a younger audience' point too seriously. Yes, I recognize that many adults watch these shows, that does not change *the target audience* of said show. I am over 20, I rewatch sponge bob square pants simply for nostalgic purposes, other people don't usually find the jokes I do in it funny, because I saw it as a child and loved it. So a show *can have* viewers that are not their *target audience*. But that doesn't change the **fact** that less adults watch these shows than children. Wether or not it has to do with the 'fans' or not, I don't know, but it is a fact that more younger people watch anime, as opposed to older people. It has nothing to do with being a 'child', or an 'adult', or being a 'grown up with responsibilities' if that makes you feel any better about my statement. \n\nI also don't avoid anime's because of the stigma, I avoid most after giving them a chance, just because I don't enjoy the same medium of TV that you do doesn't mean I'm ignorant, I have given most anime's that I haven't already seen once a chance. And to be honest, I dislike almost every style of anime out there. The most 'anime' thing I watched was avatar, which I loved, but that was only for the story, I would've rather had a realistic adaptation if I had the choice.\n\nI also recognize that they can do MUCH more fantastical things in an anime as opposed to real, actual, filming. That doesn't, however, change my mind that I'd RATHER see realistic magic dragons and Ice demons. I would rather see a realistic dragon, over a cartoon one, 10 out of 10 times.\n\nHonestly, I do know what I'm talking about, because I'm talking from my own personal experience and that of all my friends and family. I know people who LOVE anime, and who have convinced me time and time again to 'just give X Y Z a chance', and I, personally, have had the same experience almost every time. Oh, and by the way, thinking someone 'doesn't know what they're talking about' simply because they don't agree with one medium of entertainment you enjoy, is very close-minded. \n\nEDIT: words", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414162169", "subreddit": "asoiaf", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Study the measure pictured: http://imgur.com/3Xvh77K\n\nAt the time (late teens) I could count it that fast, but that is not really helpful. You need to feel it rather than count it. One way to do this is to treat each duple or triple as one beat, the triple being stretched.

(edit: this is the case, see einvala's post for details)\n\nHope this helps. I also recommend the study of \"Variations for Trumpet\" on the album \"Autumn\" as even more interesting in that there are a variety of meters (5/4 to 32/8) and are not at such a rapid pace.\n\nOf interest is that my former wife is an accomplished composer and composition teacher (now retired) and some time back she had a very gifted composition student who went on to MIT to do who knows what brilliant thing, but he was all or part Greek (or perhaps eastern European, its been a while).

{"body": "Another interesting facet may be the thinking of it in terms of poetic feet/stressed musical beats.  \n\nFor example, if we imagine C D E F G as ascending quarter notes, we will tend to want C and E accented, since they fall the first and third beats of the measure.  G will also be accented too, since it's on the 1 of the next measure.  (perhaps not coincidentally this will outline a nice C major chord).\n\nFor musical variation, later we can play this row as D E F G C (moving C to the end).  The \"feel\" will be vary different, since our tendency to emphasize 1 and 3 will stress D, F, and C, giving us a C sus chord or Dminor7 over C - it will sound different.\n\nI wonder if a clever poet could do something similar; treat poetic feet as quarter/eighth notes and move the words to match the stresses.  Stressing the first and third beats would give us **I** love **YOU**.  Moving \"I\" to precede the downbeat (to come right before the strong \"1\") would give us i **LOVE** you.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414321818", "subreddit": "musicandpoetry", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This really hits just about every solid point I wanted to bring to the table for you.\n\nTo iterate further a little, women are like cats in the sense that they can smell what you're thinking from a mile out.  I used to be in a similar scenario to you - not quite to the same degree, but I would always focus on how a female was perceiving me rather than just being in-the-moment and enjoying the interaction like I would with my guy friends.  I totally relate to where you said they just start to 'weird out' when you kind of show some affection / flirtation.  Then I would see my herp-a-derp friend end up with a phone number or two and be left astounded.  This is because when you're thinking of how you're being perceived, you're not focused on the interaction and the conversation, and thus provide a sub-par or par experience overall; whereas if you were just in-the-moment, you'd probably crack a few good jokes and make her laugh.  Women L O V E to laugh - who doesn't?\n\nOn top of bettering yourself; and please do take to heart everything /u/MigraineMcAwesome said about that because it is entirely true and I can tell you this from first-hand experience, just BE yourself.  When you interact with females, try and act the way you would as if you were interacting with your male friends - obviously mind yourself and remember she is a lady, but when you hang with your friends I'm sure you're laid back and just enjoying the moment, rather than thinking about how they are perceiving you, or thinking about flirting with them, etc.\n\nMy point is, don't get caught up in the idea that you're talking to a female.  Just be yourself - and doing this will be very easy if you begin to improve on yourself (and improving on yourself does not mean just getting into / staying in the gym) because you will have more things to project forward, more things to connect with others in general about, and will have a higher self-confidence.  Not to mention, the more you fill your idle time with, the less you're sitting around dwelling on your faults.\n\nLastly, stop LOOKING for a relationship, or a dating partner - in doing so you're looking for something outside of yourself to fill an endless void.  This is the downfall of the vast majority of relationships in today's day and age - the fact that people struggle with being alone and are not willing to accept that you don't have to be with someone to not feel alone.  The only source of your happiness can be your own SELF, because if it is anything or anywhere else, that happiness can be taken from you.  When you really love yourself, people notice - you're just very happy, pleasant to be around, and have a good character in general.\n\nSo love yourself, and laugh a little.  And remember dude, don't take life so seriously.  It's not like any of us make it out alive.  ;)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414341394", "subreddit": "howtonotgiveafuck", "score": 29, "controversiality": 0}

What is with the narcissism on reddit (er: social media) that gives you the compulsion to let us know you are walking out the door? Far be it for you to contribute to a community before you deem it lost without cause. Over half of your post is related to them using click bait titles when every person on the channel, Phil, on the SF channels, Phil on his own channel, and all of them in lots of other forms of media have r e p e a t e d l y stated that they don't want to cover this kind of drivel, but that's what brings the views and as much as you might believe that your glowing presence is enough to keep the lights on and people fed at that office, I'm sorry to tell you that just isn't the case. Looking for proof? Go watch the \"top videos\" compilations from last December in which Joe and Elliot openly mock the fact that Miley was like 3/5 of their top watched videos. Its possible you don't understand the fact that businesses are in place to make money and that some times that means doing some of what you don't want to do to fund the stuff that you do want to do. Seems like maybe what you should be considering is how can you make the videos that you like on their channel more profitable. Do you share the videos on the SF channels that you like? Do you comment and give constructive or at least any feedback on the videos to the hosts on youtube?  \n  \n  \nBack to the contribution, I see that you have been on reddit for about 2 years and that in said time you have posted in this sub exactly zero times before today, but don't let that stop you from throwing stones at the hosts to pick more 'interesting' content. Interesting is relative, and you give no frame of reference for what you want them to cover or not cover, no reference to what you have liked vs what you havent, no tangible feedback at all, just bitching.

{"body": "The easy answer is - smoke weed. But seriously, I play bass so composing from a bassist's POV is something entirely different than guitar. But when composing, First, I choose a slower tempo (depends on the mood I want to set), compose very easy straight drums (kick/hihat snare/hihate kick/hihat snare/hihat 4/4 pattern) and just jam to them. Messing with different chord patterns and  sounds is a must. I'm trying to create/find very interesting riff progression. When I have some basic structure coming out, I try to expand on that. mostly using minor, harmonic and melodic scales. Then, I rework the drums so the bass and drums are locked in together (this is the hardest part, creating good drumline locked in with the bassline). Then I just add some melodies and it's near finished. Then I play and toy with the song to see if it can be improved. Sometimes, I do smoke weed during some or whole part of the ordeal. But if you decide to smoke, compose both stoned and sober. Sometimes when you're stoned (or on drugs generally), you think you can compose a maestro piece but then you sober up and discover that it's utter shit.\n\nProtip: you might or might not downtune your guitar. That depends solely on you and the sound you want to achieve. You can play some heavy funeral shit even on a guitar E A D G C e, if you're creative.

{"body": "To learn to get the music out of your head into a form that others can understand, you need to first recognize the music that is in your head.  The way to do this is to start very simply.\n\nI am going to assume that you understand the basics of a major scale, essentially that there are 7 tones in the major scale and then an octave above the first tone.  Think of the C scale on the piano:  CDEFGABC.  Each of these pitches can be assigned a number that corresponds to the degree of the scale.  It's pretty straightforward:\n\nC=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, A=6, B=7, C=8 (or 1 again)\n\nStart with the simplest tunes you can, such as \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"  Since you play a bit of piano, you can picture the C scale as you do this exercise.\n\nEach note of the song corresponds to a number of the scale.  The notes of \"Mary\" in the key of C are:\n\nE D C D E E E \n\nD D D E E E   \n\nE D C D E E E E D D E D C\n\nExpressed in numbers, the song is:\n\n3 2 1 2 3 3 3\n\n2 2 2 3 3 3\n\n3 2 1 2 3 3 3 3 2 2 3 2 1\n\nYour task is to learn how to create a number map like the one above for any song that comes into your head.  And you can do that by working on identifying the numbers of melodies all day when you have a few spare brain cycles, like driving or riding a bus or standing in line.  \n\nThink of simple songs that you learned in the past, like \"Jingle Bells\", \"Happy Birthday\" and the like.  And work out the numbers in your head.  Don't use the piano or a guitar or any instrument.  Force yourself to work the tunes out in your head, so that when you play what you have figured out, you are certain that you will be playing the right notes the first time you play it.\n\nDo this daily for several months and you will gradually develop the ability to recognize the music in your head, which you can then translate to any medium you want for others to play or listen to.\n\nThe more time you do it, the better you get.  You can get to the point where you \"hear\" in your mind's ears an entire composition, bass lines, inner voices and all the harmonies.  Remember that Beethoven was deaf for many years, yet still composed brilliant music because he could hear it in his head.\n\nI have been doing this all day for many years.  It is how I occupy my mind when bored, such as standing in line.  Instead of being irritated that a bar is playing Glen Campbell's \"Rhinestone Cowboy,\" it becomes a chance to work out the numbers.

{"body": "First off Tides I want to clarify that I stated that CONTENT PRODUCTION is your teams main source of income, not the deck tech videos specifically. I understand that most sports business models rely heavily on sponsorships, however the reality is that most of your money comes from Reynad streaming (that is content production) the few sponsors you guys do have arent going to sponsor you over the long term if you arent promoting their products to others on stream (that is content production). So when I said content production was your team's main source of income that is what I was talking about not the Youtube videos specifically, the bottom line is that if Reynad doesnt stream consistently with his high viewcount/donations your team WILL run out of money sooner than later; the sustainability of TS hinges on CONTENT PRODUCTION at this time.\n\nAs far as pitchforks? Get real kid, I didnt start this thread I simply have the top rated comment on here because I am speaking a popular opinion that others might not be able to articulate as well. I have watched your stream starting back in January on your 1st or 2nd day IIRC, I cant even remember it was so long ago. I have watched your stream since before you were even on TS and you were running Alarm-o-God and other Druid troll decks. I never said I didnt like your stream, I simply pointed out some short comings I saw with it.\n\nAs far as your contractual obligations and what you \"signed up to do\" I have no clue about that, and I admit as much. Notice in my OP I stated that some of this might rest solely on Reynad's shoulders for not clearly outlining what the content production expectations are. With that being said any content you produce for the team helps, even if the YT vids arent pulling in a lot of bank right now, every piece of content you contribute gets you more fans, and exposure. 10,000 views per day equates to $1,000-$1,500/mo so if all TS members were each producing 1 video series each week, and streaming 30+hrs per week, and everybody was promoting the site and YT channel on their streams...? Yeah the channel would blow the fuck up I dont think 100k views per day would be out of the question within a few months... but that is not even what my OP was about, it is about the mindset and the attitude.\n\nIt is not about the money, its about the attitude and the work ethic. Do you show up to work every day because you have too? Or do you show up and do the best job you can because you take pride in your work and your team? Your comments ITT have put that on showcase Tides, no one is flaming you just consider that.\n\nAs far as this being \"none of our business\", as fans and supporters of the team we have every right to voice our concerns and opinions about the team even if we dont have perfect information. I certainly wasnt trying to flame you, I was just trying to speak my opinion about stuff I see. \n\nIn closing I want to thank you for your response to my post, when I wrote it I didnt think you would even see it. I will still continue to be a supporter of all of the TS members, including watching your stream, and I will continue to spam T I D E S B O Y S, G A A R A B O Y S, PJSalt = R eynad (no space), and PogChamp Hyp3d Kreygasm in the chat at every casted event you guys are at.

{"body": "If you're looking for something **Twilight Struggle**-esque that will work for more players, /u/Keilfer suggested some good ones. Allow to expand a bit. Some of these games do not qualify as true card-driven games (CDGs), but they use cards to push the actions along, and I don't think you're asking for strict categorical taxonomies anyway.\n\nYou both should try **Washington's War** (originally published as We the People before being revamped). It's a 2-player card-driven wargame but it introduces the point-to-point system with Go-like strategic qualities along with troop wintering. Mark Herman, the author, was the inventor of the CDG system, and although he would be the first to tell you that many people have improved upon his ideas more than he could have expected, his work is always looking into because he has stayed active in game design.\n\nTwilight Struggle is nearly perfect, but if you're looking for variety, starting with Washington's War will add a few new mechanics that will bring you up to speed on heavier games.\n\nThe **COIN series**, envisioned and populated so far by the inestimably brilliant Volko Ruhnke (and his comrades) is just fantastic. COIN games play from 1–4 people, and may provide the opportunity for you to play with more people without having to find a full complement of 5 or 6. \n\nEach player has slightly to somewhat different asymmetric actions that he can take and different goals to accomplish. That means the COIN games are 1 v. 1 v. 1 v. 1 (as many games are), but not only are your resources and strengths different, the mechanics for each player are different. That means you have to understand how your faction works and get to know the others factions well enough to know what to anticipate and how to thwart their activities.\n\nCombine this asymmetry with the fact that the games use a modified CDG-system. Instead of holding a hand of cards, the players draw a next card together and the order of the faction symbols on top tells you which player goes first that round. Mind you, only 2 of the players will play that round, and players who played in the previous round are ineligible from play in this round unless they passed. So, the card may read A B C D but A and C may be ineligible because they went last turn. It's therefore B's turn to take a powerful operation and D will probably get to take a less powerful action. Let's say B goes but D passes. On the next turn, A, C, and D are eligible. The card shows D, A, C. This time D goes first, A passes, C goes second, and B is in eligible. On the next turn, A and B can play but C and D cannot. And so on and so forth...\n\nEach card not only allows for operations points but also events. You can play one or the other, but since all the players share the same card, the action the first eligible player takes determines the type of action the second can take. So you end up strategizing based on tactical order but also based on whether you can perform the event or whether, if you don't how that will allow the other players to play or not.\n\nVolko's games are extremely well-designed and the rules are as short as you can make them without them being unclear. They are also typically unambiguous, but they are parsimonious and do not really give you a sense of how to strategize. You'll read them and think, \"Okay, but what do I do now?\" Best to read through the playbooks and work through them with your friend informally before trying to involve other players. You'll be more effective at teaching them that way.\n\nIf you start with COIN, start either with **Andean Abyss** or **Cuba Libré**. AA is the first and slightly simpler than the rest. CL is somewhat trickier because it is on such a small map, but the size of the map means you'll not have as many choices and will therefore learn the system faster with more player interaction. \n\nOnce you learn one, the others come easily. **A Distant Plain** is beautiful and instructive to the modern person. **Fire in the Lake** is poignant. Look for the next ones coming up, **Gallic War** (about the Roman conquest of Gaul) and **Liberty or Death** (the American Revolution). A special note on Fire in the Lake: Volko worked with Mark Herman to produce it, so the pedigree of this CDG is especially high.\n\nRegarding Ed Beach's masterful games, **Here I Stand** and **Virgin Queen**, he tried to take his absolute love for Europe in the period of the first half of 16th century that grew out of playing an old Avalon Hill Game, **A Mighty Fortress**, and remake what AMF should have been into a far better game. Here I Stand (HIS) takes all of the competing and totally orthogonal interests of six great powers and makes a stunningly brilliant CDG out of them. None of the players play the same way (cf. the COIN system), but each has a hand of cards with powers that may help or hurt him based on which faction he is playing. The Ottomans are trying to rush to take victory in Eastern Europe and on the seas before the Hapsburgs can stop them. Meanwhile, the Hapsburgs are powerful but playing a two-front war. The English are mired in Henry VIII's proclivities. The French are trying to increase culture. The Catholics are trying to destroy the Reformation, and the Protestants are trying to win debates before actually turning into an army of their own. What Ed Beach discovered in his historical research is that all of these important events that you think are separate from history class all happened within a tight 80 year period. The conquistadores were invading the Americas will Ottoman Janissaries were strengthening their hold on Constantinople.\n\nNo player in HIS plays the same way at all. Your considerations and mechanics as the Pope are completely orthogonal to what you do if you are Henry VII.\n\nVirgin Queen is the historical sequel and in some ways should not be played until you've played HIS. You certainly could, and VQ is brilliant, but it's better to start with HIS because HIS is *slightly* simpler.\n\nYou may enjoy Chad Jensen's **Combat Commander** series. They provide a way for a few players to strategize battle on a relatively small hexboard using a card-driven system. They are popular games because they play fluidly. Two-players only.\n\nOn the note of two player games, if you like Twilight Struggle, you should also enjoy **1989**. You might also enjoy **Labyrinth** (Volko Ruhnke's game before the COIN series). It looks a lot like TS but it is fascinatingly more complex and drawn in on itself. Volko's **Wilderness War** combines an early look at the French and Indian War. CDG + point to point system, much like Washington's War. And Mark Herman's own other very famous CDG, **Empire of the Sun** combines hex-based wargaming with CDG. It is due for a reprint. Worth looking into. Finally, if you're interested in WWI, consider looking into **Paths of Glory**. Even though published in 1999, it is still #40 on Boardgamegeek.com's list for a reason.\n\nThere are a few 3-player card-wargames coming out that promise to be interesting. Keep your eyes on **Triumph and Tragedy**, which will pit the Allies vs. the Nazis vs. the Communists in WWII Europe. And **Churchill** will be a 3-way game of subtle negotiation.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414496591", "subreddit": "boardgames", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First off, I think the tonic of the whole song is G major. After the end of the chorus, play a G major chord and everything is resolved very nicely. Therefore I wouldn't call the \"root chord\" an A Dorian or A minor. The notes in the scale might be the same as G major, but the bass note sounds most resolved when it lands on G. Your ears might disagree\n\nDorian is similar to Aeolian except for the 6th note, the first 5 notes are both \"minor sounding\" that's right\n\nLydian and Mixolydian start off \"major\" (first 3 notes), that's right\n\nI think what you're calling \"C major\" is the chord the piano plays in the bar that the bass starts off on G. If you listen to the notes that the bass plays, you'll hear it essentially playing over G major, including the F#. I could have also written the Am9/G harmony as CMaj7(#11, 13)/G or even Gmaj7 (11, 13) but those both look really odd.\n\nFrom the A Dorian, if you take the 3 5 7 notes of that scales, you end up with C E G which is indeed a C major sound. But the presense of the F# in the bassline, even as a passing tone, means that we're don't really have  \"pure\" C major here.\n\nTherefore, I called it Am9 to simply highlight the slight variation between the previous chord.\n\nBar 1: A B C# D E F# G A (A Mixolydian)\n\nBar 2: A B C D E F# G A (A Dorian)\n\nThe reason why this \"works\" is because there's actually very little variation between the two bars.

{"body": "With the flourishes in the right hand, the best way I've found to practice them is to do something like this:\n\nStart with middle C with your thumb, then play the octave above that with your pinky. Jump up an octave and do the same thing: your thumb plays the note your pinky just played. Now play a rhythm that's essentially a dotted 8th note with the octave up being a 16th note - C . . C C . . C - all the way up. Make the downbeat note as short as the other note, and try not to accent the \"thumb note\": make it as even and smooth as possible with the pinky articulation. Use your shoulder, arm, and wrist to avoid tucking your thumb under (remember: your elbow doesn't have to move much for your hand to move far). Start slow, repeat, then speed up gradually.\n\nThen you can start adding notes in between. Start with adding a G -- C . G C C . G C -- then an E -- C E G C C E G C -- and now you're getting to a smooth C Major arpeggio. Now expand that to all major chords, minor chords, chord inversions, major and minor sevenths, diminished chords, whole tone lines, and whatever else you can cram in between your thumb and pinky. Again, try to do this without accenting any one note (especially what you'd play with your thumb) over others.\n\nAs you get faster, stop thinking so much about the individual notes, as you'll begin to automatize the finger motions, and start thinking about the entire flow of notes up and down. Now you can start accenting the bottom and top notes, and integrating crescendos and decrescendos into ascending and descending lines.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414526483", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Love the hero, but I don't play it much in Pubs because you struggle to translate snowballing into a win.\n\nYou should win most 1v1 lanes reasonably. Don't feel pressured to get kills, often just suppressing an enemy is enough in mid to buy time. Skill 1-1-4-1 if against a ranged hero, 2-1-4-0 if against melee / TA. The extra point in dagger at level 3 allows you to really crank up the hurt on a Pudge or Magnus, spam it with bottle. Taking Ulti at level 6 is often quite redundant - it only does 25 more damage than Scream lvl 4 but costs a LOT of Mana.\n\nThere are 3 main ways to play in my opinion:\n\n* Orchid Rush: This is the build I do the most and is very successful. Sit mid, bottle, magic stick, brown boots, quarterstaff, quarterstaff&gt;Rest of Orchid. Do not rotate aggressively before you have Orchid, then rotate a LOT. Carry TP after the quarterstaff's, you do have *some* power in turning skirmishes but **DO NOT DIE.**\n\n* Stats and Hex: This build is more flexible and better in games where you need Hex for Evasion or a BKB hero who doesn't care about Orchid, as well as games where the enemy has more burst damage and lockdown or just lacks squishy heroes to feed off of with Orchid. Go Bottle, Wand, Treads, double Null, m a y b e Veil, then Scythe of Vyse (Ulti Orb first). This build gives amazing stats, strong damage and Hex is utterly outstanding at every phase. Because of it's greater cost and harder buildup (as well as the fact you can't snowball as well) *rushing* Hex is very rarely appropriate. With this build you can be active faster than naked Orchid, but only really come online later.\n\n* Dagon: This build is only effective in games where you are with a stack that includes your supports, the enemy has low HP heroes, or you are simply balling totally out of control and want to repress the enemy heroes. If you can be assured that your team will put effort into securing your snowball and is able to reward it and take advantage of it, a super fast (9 mins or less if totally rushed with Bottle and Boots) Dagon can totally take over a game. Do not do this in pubs, it is fun but rarely translates into a win if your team won't push properly or plays greedily.\n\nWhatever you choose, Item 2 is almost always BKB. If you went Orchid, going back for Dagon can be acceptable if you snowball very strongly, but BKB is still a priority.\n\nLots of people build stupid items on QoP that either have very low game impact or are so incredibly situational that they are practically wasted. Linkens is a good example, unless you want to Linkens someone *else* BKB is almost always better. In a similar vein Aghs is usually totally pointless, the additional damage is a joke. The CD reduction is ok for skipping creep waves and ratting, basically, but you will rarely get to use the spell on cooldown - even when skipping waves. Too much mana.\n\nI have occasionally build Aghs after Orchid or Hex, but only in games where we are losing and need to push creep waves out. Don't rush Aghs, ever.\n\nYour role as QoP in the mid and lategame is to initiate teamfights by disabling a single target with Sheepstick, or catch split pushers and out of position supports. If there is a Furion or Tinker in your game make it your personal mission to make his life hell. Early game don't blink in, walk in and Shadow Strike. Keep Blink to chase and escape. When you have Hex or Orchid, THEN you can blink aggressively, Blink&gt;Item&gt;SS&gt;Ulti&gt;Scream.\n\nQoP's animations have quite a lot of backswing, particularly Dagger and Ulti. When you Dagger in lane, spam right clicks almost as soon as the animation starts or the back swing can cost you the extra hit the slow gains when harassing.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNotable matchups:\n\n* Against TA buy your own sentries if you have to - don't go to lane without them or she will disjoint dagger with Meld.\n\n* Against Puck force Phase Shift with Right clicks then dagger, avoid getting silenced when you can. Scream AoE is slightly larger than Rift AoE, abuse this if you can.\n\n* Against Invoker and SF get really aggro really early, dominate them, stand between them and the creeps. At around levels 3-5 they will be able to force you back but level 1 cold snap is quite pathetic compared to shadow strike, razes too (especially if he has nearly no souls).\n\n* Against Razor go 0-2-4-1 and save blink to break link. You shouldn't need to start with boots.\n\n* Against OD, stay far back. Snipe the odd last hit here and there, but if you move up to the creeps he will Astral you, deny the creep, you get 0 exp and it's a 16 damage swing. \n\n* Against Pudge cackle maniacally, it's almost a free win lane.\n\nHope that helped.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: \n\nQoP is a strong split pusher lategame because she is so hard to catch. Hide in trees, abuse blink, you can usually kill whoever they send to stop you if they are alone and if you take up 2 heroes you are winning the trade anyway - even if you get no buildings directly. For this, Necrobook, Shivas, and (VERY lategame if you have a lot of Int) even Manta are useful.\n\nRight-Click items are strong on QoP but only after BKB. Mjoll takes the crown, Mael is a strong farming steroid and cheap and QoP's low base attack time makes attack speed items very strong on her. For this reason and her general fragility, AC is also not bad on QoP. Skadi is good if you just need HP or a BKB penetrating slow, Satanic if you think you need to buy a rapier (those games happen and a ranged hero with Blink makes quite a good rapier carry), and MKB lets you be more flexible with positioning because you can attack uphill and from weird angles.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414550339", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

If the OP's house is old enough, that one outlet could be on the same circuit with another bathroom, the garage and the outdoor outlets.  Also, they could all be on 14 gauge wire. OP probably shouldn't plug a vac in that outlet.  Hair dryers might seem a little tired.  Here is an online [voltage drop calculator](http://www.lexproducts.com/technical-help/voltage-drop-calculator/) that appears to use the formula: Voltage Drop=(2 x L x K x I)/CMA.\n\nEdit:  An inspector knowing a house was built prior to 1996 or 1997, could use that 20 amp load in a bathroom outlet to scare a homeowner into hiring an electrical contractor to fix the \"problem\".  Naturally, the home inspector would recommend a particular electrical contractor(for a kickback).  An actual problem would rarely occur.  Plug in 1200 watt hair dryer w/calculated apparent 287 feet of 14 gauge wire = 15% voltage drop or 102 vac at outlet.  Takes longer to dry hair. Maybe hair dryers don't last as long.  Two bathrooms on that same 14 gauge wire.  Run two hair dryers at max at the same time.  Breaker trips pretty quick.  No damage done.  Have to wait for breaker to cool, before using one hair dryer this time. Bad would be plugging in two hair dryers at the same time and not turning them up to max  With two hair dryers running on the same 15 amp circuit, a continuous 15 amps through the breaker is possible.

{"body": "It's because Western music contains 12 distinct \"notes,\" or half steps. A half-step up is considered a \"sharp\" (so from A up to A#) while a half-step down is considered a \"flat\" (so from B down to Bb). If you are familiar with the theme from Jaws, this is arguably the most famous musical rendition of simple half-steps \"Duh-dum. Duh-dum. Duh-dum duh-dum...\" etc.  \n\nWell, two half-steps equals one whole-step. Sing Mary Had a Little Lamb. This song is comprised of three whole steps. Except our standard musical scale of seven letters, A B C D E F G, that happens to be arguably most pleasing to the ear tonally, does not divide evenly into our 12 musical notes or half-steps. The result is that while A and B are a whole step apart, B and C are only a half-step apart, and while B to C, C to D, and D to E are whole steps, E and F are only a half step apart. F to G and G to A finish the whole steps. Now, since a \"sharp\" is just a half-step up, you can have an \"E-sharp\" - it's just F.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414610120", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Take your pick. (- Qw_ER_tY -)\n\n* If all else fails, a nice keyboard faceroll does the trick (just look at Taiwan's top 50 CtB players)\n\n***\n**POLISH**\n***\n**Your name must either start with the opening bracket or a letter, no motherfucking exceptions** \n\nPoland names are pretty standard, most of the them are actually usernames for what they should be defined as. You really can't go wrong making a Polish name, but make sure that the name isn't too long (unless you are WWW or a select few others.)\n\nStart with a capitalized letter or make the whole thing lowercase\n\nPoland names are nice...\n\n***\n**CHINESE**\n*** \nYou can either: \n\n* Take some old meme and a dash here and there\n\n* Mash your face on the punctuation section of your keyboard once you have figured out who your eternal waifu is\n\n* Type gibberish\n\nIf none of these work for you, make sure that your own name isn't in a middle ground of characters i.e. it needs to be too long or too short. You can fix this problem with underscores.\n\n***\n**FREEDOMNESE**\n***\nYOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER THE FUCK NAME YOU WANT, THIS IS THE LAND OF THE FREE MOTHERFUCKER \n\n***\n**FRENCH**\n***\nI TOOK A FRENCH COURSE FOR TWO YEARS, AND I REMEMBER FUCK ALL FROM IT\n\nBUT IT DOESNT MATTER, BECAUSE FRENCH NAMES ARE ACTUALLY ENGLISH\n\nThey're pretty much nice, proper and formatted names. Nothing much else to say, they are not retarded! :D\n\nIf you're really struggling to think of a name\n\n1. Think of two vowels (e.g. o and e)\n2. Take a bit of your favourite word (take part of the word antidisestablishmentarianism, or just \"Anti\" )\n3. Throw in the vowel at letter intervals  3 and 4 (i.e. Anteio)\n4. Et volia, your new French name\n\n***\n**CANADIAN**\n***\nYeah, above. Just don't make it look retarded. Usually the two-word deal is good. Canadian names are double nice!\n\n***\n**BRAZILIAN**\n***\nJust don't make it BRBRBRBRBR HUEHUEHUE (don't remind me of my TERA days -_-), that's about it. Most names of brazillian top 100 players also have first letter capitalized so if you want to be pro, gotta follow the pros.\n\n***\n**REST OF WORLDNESE**\n***\nA normal name will suffice, however you must go through 1 or more categories\n\n1. A character from your favourite anime.\n2. Your Waifu.\n3. Your previous online handles.\n4. A noun.\n5. A random word.\n6. A odd or prime number at the end.\n7. A persons name i.e. Bill46\n8. Your Weeaboo name e.g. Cowboy Takarada or some shit (that isn't mine, I don't have one :P)\n9. One letter from each of your harem members (order it from most ship-worthy to least ship-worthy)\n10. Something you saw in the sky.\n11. Lick a battery, and write down what you think it tastes like, once you have 5 words, take the first and last letters and write then down in order of the words. \n\n12. A \"thing\" from your favourite video game e.g. pippilover442\n\n13. Take two frying pans and bang them repeatedly outside the street, the ID tag of the first cop that shows up is now the first half of your number name. When you get taken into custody because you assaulted him with your two pans, make a record of the time you arrive. Now you have your second half.\n\nAnd don't forget the most important, unscrupulously detrimental part of making your name, like holy shit im this far down in this stupid post and I haven't properly stated it...\n\n**Don't**\n\n**Forget**\n\n**BRACKETS**\n\n***\n**TL;DR: just write something, man...**\n***\nWELL THAT'S ALL FOLKS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414640962", "subreddit": "osugame", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}

Letter grades are A B C D F, possibly followed by a + or −. Their numeric values are 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0. There is no F+ or F−. A + increases the numeric value by 0.3, a – decreases it by 0.3. However, an A+ has the value of 4.0. Do not use a switch statement as this is outside of the AP subset. Also be sure the program works for uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n&gt; Sample run: Enter a letter grade: B− Numeric value: 2.7\n\n&gt; **Use a class Grade** with methods **calcGrade** and **getNumericGrade**. **Also include the class below called GradePrinter to run the program**. Be sure to add a few more comments.\n\n---\n\nYou need two classes, one being written, and the other you need to create.  Let's assume you're not allowed to use packages, your code should look something like this:\n\n\timport java.util.Scanner;\n\n\tpublic class GradePrinter {\n\n\t\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\t\tScanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Enter a letter grade:\");\n\t\t\tString input = in.nextLine();\n\n\t\t\tGrade ltrGrade = new Grade(input);\n\n\t\t\tltrGrade.calcGrade();\n\n\t\t\tdouble numGrade = ltrGrade.getNumericGrade();\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Numeric value: \" + numGrade);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tclass Grade {\n\n\t\tGrade(String input) {\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tvoid calcGrade() {\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tdouble getNumericGrade() {\n\t\t\treturn 0; // '0' provided simply so that the program won't throw an error\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nYou are essentially supposed to fill in the blanks for the `Grade` class so that when `B-` is the input the output is 2.7 (as a test case), your program should allow all possible letter grades with accurate outputs for the requirements provided with an ample amount of comments.  Additionally you are not allowed to use the switch statement and output should work for both lowercase and uppercase input.\n\nSo there's the skeleton for your code, let me know if you need more guidance.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414649303", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My story is about Bob.  I met him post-hire for the first time in North Vegas, driving to a customer.  He was a new PM and he's trying to Take Control from day 1.  We're talking and he says, \"please wait a minute, I need to set J straight and how to communicate to customers.\"  He types away an email on his phone (s l o w l y) and then resumes his convo with me.\n\nA minute later, he goes \"Oh shit!, I sent that email to the customer!\"  Thus began about 2 months of the same ironic ~~nonsense~~ fun from him.  I didn't have to work with him too directly but a lot of other people did and he couldn't have alienated them more thoroughly than if he'd planned it out in detail.\n\nNear the end of his tenure, the office manager goes on holiday to England and there's a complete breakdown in the office over Bob.  Office manager returns and half the office insists that he MUST be fired.  \n\nOffice manager organizes an office-wide meeting to talk things out and it totally backfires.  People immediately launch into several deeply personal attacks on poor Bob (who really deserved it, but not Chinese Communist sit-in-the-middle-of-the-room style).  \n\nBob says that he won't stand for he, gets up and leaves the room.  This was actually the only upstanding thing I ever saw from him.\n\nNext day, he emails office manager, basically demanding vengeance.  Office manager fired him since otherwise, 1/2 the office would quit.\n\nIt was a dramatic week :).\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414695302", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This completely passes over the whole point of ethics, which paradoxically, consists in denying the value of individuals in order to promote a greater good. Nice try though, perfect response for upvotes from the majority of other redditors who frequent this subreddit who, like you, have no actual grasp of philosophy, or indeed, any ability to distill general propositions into more universal ones. This kind of response is the anathema of philosophy, but hell, upvotes right? I'll give my personal analysis of your argument:\n\n1. Promotes absolute egoism and the herd mentality - 70%\n\n2. Overlooking the fact that everyone, no matter how they may be considered by others, at least possesses a modicum of value - 100%\n\n3. Overlooks the fact that ethics extends to all individuals, whether they possess value or not - 100%\n\n4. Overlooks the fact that this 'value' as construed by your fine self is a form of value entirely dependent on contingent factors, whilst presupposing that said contingent factors will not change or indeed have any possibility of changing - 100%\n\nAll in all, the work of a buffoon, and one who has no grasp of philosophy. You might have read some Nietzsche, hell, maybe even some Rand, so that gives you the right to effectively call others worthless. I myself will note that you don't possess any degree of self knowledge, or indeed psychological profundity, else you might realise that said contingent value might at some point be expressed in one such as yourself, because it is by definition contingent, and thus caused by, liable to, and brought about by change. But again, that could never happen right?\n\nHave a downvote. Welcome to /r/philosophy, where the motto is 'leave the philosophy to the philosophers and destroy the trolls.' But again, you're neither, just a moron. Enjoy your stay.\n\nEdit: If you had seriously read and grasped any work on normative ethics, then you would fully understand that immoral agents are, in any coherent normative ethical theory, to be equally considered as equal in value to moral ones. That is the entire point of normative ethics. Lao Tzu sums it up nicely: 'The Saint is a Saint because he is good. He is good towards good people; he is also good towards bad people. He is good to all.' Further: 'What is a bad man? A good man's job.' Of course, on the basis of your utilitarian garbage - Fully expressed as: 'If they're not ethical then throw them in the mincer' - You fail to overlook the outstanding hypocrisy of such a position. 'Let us meet immorality with immorality'. But again, you aren't a philosopher, else you'd realise the logical consequence of holding such a position - Any society founded on it would ultimately become as worthless as those condemned. \n\nIn stark opposition to your particularly fine argument therefore, I posit that this collection of assertions made by yourself is in fact total garbage, with nary a whiff of consistency or indeed moral validity. Assume for a moment that God existed. Then assume again that he fills the role of the Good Shepard... What kind of conclusions can we draw? Does any of your argument tend towards compassion, beneficence, forgiveness or sympathy? No, it does not. So where's the morality? Where's the notion that bad men can be made good? Isn't that the entire fucking point of moral philosophy, irrespective of Socratic argufying? What a load of shit. But again, the people upvoting you are equally as guilty in advocating such a profoundly hollow and dimwitted philosophy. Unless of course, they're simply playing the part of the jester for mischief and little else - Which would make you the joke, unfortunately. \n\nIf you had even read Plato, you would have grasped the notion that bad men are bad because of ignorance. Which is, if innocent and possibly naive, infinitely more forgiving than the drivel you've spouted in order to justify, seemingly, some very-possibly misguided notion of self-worth. If you had any sense of real self-value, you'd understand that actual self-value stemmed not from contingent factors, but from that which does not change. Timeless acts. Such acts can be committed irrespective of time and place, or even moral disposition. You might argue that 'worthless people' are incapable of performing such acts, but that's a *petitio principii* - The fact that they can perform such acts and are always capable of doing so completely nullifies your argument. Which gives all people, irrespective of what they may have been or what they may be, a modicum of value. Unrealised perhaps, but realisable - And forever this remains. Does one crush a flower which sprouts in shade because it will not grow in sunshine? No, because that would be an act of beastliness and not morality. \n\nSo where does that leave you? Resting on a notion of self-worth which entirely depends on that which is ever-changing and at the whim of the hands of fate. Not precisely the soundest position from which to assail the worth of others, but there again, would you, when advocating such a position, truly understand that? Probably not.\n\nEdit 2: I forgot to mention that your account of 'personal value' does not in fact take into account any notion of moral redemption or salvation from past evils. Socrates would argue that people who have been evil know best how to do good. So where does that leave you? My advice would be not to post trash. Maybe go read some philosophical books, instead of cobbling together some egoistic claptrap under the facade of utilitarianism and positing it as 'ethics' in a philosophy forum. \n\nIf you seriously proposed this in a real forum of philosophers you would be hooted out of town. I'm not one for scholasticism, but in this case I'd agree. I'd rather read someone giving a consistent interpretation of Plato's theory of the good than this rubbish. I'd rather hear a child speak on the subject - They at least wouldn't be condemning a cross-section of humanity as 'worthless'.\n\nMoral: If you eliminate a certain set of errors, chances are you will open up a path to a new set of them which you will be unable to see the folly of because there was no comparison required to do so. I believe Nietzsche said much the same thing. \n\nG A R B A G E\n\n'Some people will never be able to accept that a person can be worthless' - No, but a philosophical argument can be, and yours pretty much is. All the same, I don't say you shouldn't be the recipient of moral action because your arguments are bad, I just think you're an idiot. This naive psychology is what gives many such popular posts on /r/rphilosophy an air of scholarship and wisdom. On the contrary, they betray the general disposition of the subreddit as a whole, which is to say, one that is not altogether indicative of intelligence and/or wisdom. But again, upvotes! If philosophy were a popularity contest then the folks like you would probably have earned laurels ages ago, and the 'major problems' of philosophy would have been 'solved', or at least, addressed in a way that 'sounded good' to the majority of participants. Note the word 'participants' here. However, fortunately enough for the spirit of man - and thus mankind as whole -  there exist fellows like the ireful Schopenhauer, the discontented Nietzsche, and the benevolent Lao Tzu who upset your plans at all turns for transforming philosophy into a prom and the halls of truth into a gala. Well done! Give me Tolkien and the ruralistic libertarianism of Old Albion; the soft-hylozoism of the Secret Fire of Arnor, and the fucking didactic moralisms of an old geezer in a hat over this fucking trash. It has worth, it has value; yours does not. 'We must do the best we can as we may', as opposed to 'Kill the killers' - If you had any grounding in Eastern philosophy you would have realised the vanity of such a position, but again, you don't, so it doesn't matter. Such philosophy springs up like weeds where there is no self-knowledge or wisdom to stem its advance. Pity, because real philosophy begins where prejudice takes leave. Ah, but you did not know that! You thought philosophy was supposed to corroborate prejudice, am i correct? And in so thinking, you did not perceive that all real progress - in intellection, science, aesthetics - stems from the contention and contradiction of pre-existing norms - and prejudices! But that is the *economic politics* of thought, you see - There are those who seek to bolster their own interests through the espousing of doctrines which corroborate and justify their own interests. These are the enemies of human progress, simply because they seek to sit on their laurels, even if said 'laurels' contribute nothing to man as a whole. Then there is the bold thinker, who seeks to say something new simply because it has not been said. If it is false, then what matter? At the least it is at least as honest as the one who asserts things in order to justify himself. On the other hand, if it truly is something new and groundbreaking, it heralds the ascent of something new and hitherto unforeseen in the world of men.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414709966", "subreddit": "philosophy", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
