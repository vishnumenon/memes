{"body": "I have reduced my collection down to about 40,000 cards and they are all sorted by color and then alphabetically (multicolor/hybrid are treated sorted by ally then enemy pairs, shards, wedges, 4 color then 5 color, then alphabetically). In almost every case, I do not keep more of 4 of any card unless it is a true staple, then I will hold on to 8 or 12 (Lightning Bolt comes to mind). If I own more than that of a card and it is playable, it goes into my trade binder.\n\nI also got rid of my \"rare\" binder and just have a trade binder which consists solely of my extra *playable* cards (Standard, Modern, Legacy, Vintage and Commander), all of which is available for trade and I keep track of my weird want list in it.\n\nIt took me about two weeks to get everything in order while sorting in front of the TV for a few hours every night, previously they had been solely by color. Sorting was easy on the coffee table since colors were done, so going alphabetically was using a 4x6 grid of:\n\nA B C D E F  \nG H I J K L  \nM N O P R S  \nT U V W XYZQ\n\n(Almost no cards start with Q, X, Y, or Z.)\n\nOnce they were sorted by first letter, I went back through each stack to alphabetize them, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be since Magic seems to reuse a lot of the same letter sequences in each color. For example, in Red F, odds are good you're going to have Fire and Flame taking up a majority of the slot.\n\nI find it much more useful with deck building because I never have to look elsewhere for a card when completing a playset. If I need 4 Brainstorms, I got Blue &gt; B, instead of something like blue &gt; Ice Age, then Mercadian Masque, then weird secondary products before finding 4 of them. The rise of secondary releases like Duel Decks and half new/half old core sets made me switch from sorting by color and set.\n\nAll of my cards are stored in a retired library catalog, so I don't need to worry about shifting cards much since I intentionally left space for 100-150ish cards in each drawer and the whole thing is less than half full.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414877852", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's why. \n\n**Items;** this is assuming that you build Ryze the same as 99% of the population, with\n\n* Archangel Staff\n\n* Rod of Ages\n\n* Frozen Heart\n\n* Void Staff\n\n* Mercs / Tabi / Sorcs (depends on the game, honestly)\n\n* Banshee's Veil or Spirit Visage\n\nFrozen Heart is 100% core on Ryze. 20% CDR, Mana, and Armor; which he needs as a short-ranged champion. He's going to eat auto attacks, he needs armor, and as he builds Rod of Ages, he needs armor to back up the health.\n\nSpirit Visage isn't my personal favorite on him; I prefer Banshee's Veil; again, Health/MR for resistances and survivability, and the passive Banshee's shield is one of the most powerful passives in the game, especially on a champion who is prone to being locked down and kited like Ryze is.\n\nVoid Staff is actually part of my core build on Ryze; but it's one of my 2 damage items, total. Ryze just doesn't NEED damage items beyond that. (Archangel and Void are mainly for damage, and while Rod of Ages gives him great damage, it also gives amazing tank stats and sustain with it's passive)\n\n**In general,** I will agree that 21/0/9 heavy AP/Mana \"Offense Ryze\" can work... but it's risky. You are incredibly easy to lock down, knock back, kite, and you WILL take damage getting into the enemy team. Having the health/armor/MR/shield from defensive items means that you can walk into the enemy team with impunity.\n\nAlso, remember this; Ryze scales INCREDIBLY hard. Almost no other champion scales as well as he does, besides the Infinity champions. His damage output is ridiculous, even with a mostly tank build. In all honesty, it doesn't matter most of the time if it takes you 5 seconds or 2 seconds to kill an enemy; they are going to die. I would rather get the enemy 80% of the time and live 100% of the time, than try to go in and instakill the enemy but get killed doing it.\n\n**Masteries;** we go deep into utility (9/0/21 or 4/5/21) for the laning phase. We play Top Ryze, so we get denied most blue buffs; and we're relatively weak in laning phase, so we need that extra sustain, movespeed, and mana regen that we can get from Utility. The bonus 5% CDR and Summoner Spell CDR doesn't hurt either.\n\n* Math time; 5% CDR from Offense, 5% CDR from Utility, 10% CDR from Q, 20% CDR from Frozen Heart. Perfectly 40%. (This is also another reason I don't like Spirit Visage; the CDR is a wasted stat, and the passive health/lifesteal/spellvamp boost isn't that necessary, as you shouldn't NEED the lifegain to live during fights.)\n\nIn addition; most of the Offense masteries we might think about taking (Mental Force, Arcane Mastery, Arcane Blade, Archmage) all deal with having AP; which Ryze doesn't really NEED. Sure, you get AP on him through Archangel Staff, Rod of Ages and Void Staff, but you aren't stacking DFG/Rabadons like some other AP Mages. I would rather get MS, Cooldown Reduction and sustain than a tiny bit of lategame damage.\n\n* Sidenote, if you get stupidly fed on Ryze, try buying a DFG. It's hilarious. DFG into Q R Q E Q W Q will instagib most champions.\n\nPersonally, these are the masteries I would run, depending on my lane opponent.\n\n* 6/0/24 http://puu.sh/cAqWh/39dd1e40be.jpg\n\n* 9/0/21 http://puu.sh/cAr1j/319d787cab.jpg\n\n* 4/5/21 http://puu.sh/cAqZL/5ba7328783.jpg\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414948931", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Doing so generates a new coin; thus, as more transactions are made, the difficulty of creating new coins increases greatly, ensuring that there is a method which approximates \"work\" that allows for them to be generated, but that someone can't easily generate an infinite amount and drop the value of the currency overnight.

Let me start at the beginning, bear with me, it's a bit compicated!\n\nEvery note has a name, one note is higher than the other. You've got these notes: A B C D E F G and then A but it is one octave higher (it is the same note only higher).\n\n Then you also have half-notes in between them, notes in between the whole notes: A Ais (half a note higher than A) B C Cis D Dis E F Fis G Gis.\n\nYou've also got note ladders. You don't use every note i just described in one note ladder, but, for example in a G ladder you use G A B C D E Fis G. \n\nNow, if you're gonna write a song, you need some structure, or else it will be a hassle to compose and it just won't be fun to listen to. So you take one key (mostly, sometimes they change halfway but don't worry about that). \n\nThis key, for example the G key, is the base of your song. Every note played in a song that's played in G will belong in the G key, so it will consist of the notes G A B C D E Fis G, and sometimes other notes but for simplicity let's just assume that only the notes mentioned above are used. That's the skeleton of your song.\n\nStill with me? Wanna learn more? No? I'll still go on if that's okay,\n\nYou also have something like chords. Chords are a conbination of notes. A G chord can consider of for example G B and D. See that those notes fit into the G key (G A B C D E Fis G)? \n\nYou can also have a combination of chords played after each other to make a song. Ever heard of the [4-chord song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I&amp;spfreload=1)? It's a string of chords so damn catchy it's been the key (hehehehe) behind the succes of a crapton of hits.\n\nThese chords, viewed from our G key (G A B C D E Fis G) are the following chords:\n\nG D Em C, and the chords can consist of these notes;\n\nG: G B D\n\nD: D Fis A\n\nEm: E G B (Em stands for E minor, let's not go into detail now, what you gotta remember is that minor chords sound sad).\n\nNotice again that every note mentioned above fits into the G key. Cool right? If you learn more about music you'll notice that it's actually math. I like to see this whole key system as a [mandala](http://www.mandala-4free.de/kostenlose-Mandalas/Mandala-002.png) (mandala is tibetian for \"universe\"). It's a cycle. You have a base, you circle around alot and create awesome stuff, but it all fits into each other and it all connects to the base. I love music.\n\nSo there you have it. A key is sort of the skeleton for a song, the base of creation of your musical fantasies. I hope this was a bit understandable?\n\n**tl;dr** a song consists of notes, a key defines which notes you use so that no matter what you do, the notes sound cool when played together.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414983694", "subreddit": "radiohead", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; The thing is, the piece sounds more like it's in a minor key... although is there any way of knowing for sure?\n\nFor sure, no.  But in this case, it's obviously E minor.  Look at the underlying harmonies.  In particular, the end of the piece is an E minor chord (well, it's missing the third, but whatever).\n\nBy the way, the minor key is actually three scales in one!  There's the \"default\" (natural) minor scale, 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 1, which is what's in the key signature.  There's the harmonic minor scale, 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 7 1, which the chords mostly use.  And there's the melodic minor scale, 1 2 b3 4 5 6 7 1 going up and 1 b7 b6 5 4 b3 2 1 going down, which is what melodies use.  In E, these are:\n\nE natural minor: E F# G A B C D E\n\nE harmonic minor: E F# G A B C D# E\n\nE melodic minor: E F# G A B C# D# E D C B A G F# E\n\nHarmonic minor really only means that music in minor has a major V chord.  You're in E minor, so this means that you'll see B major chords (B major is the V of E).  This is almost always true in minor.  So since you're seeing all these D#'s from the B major chords, it's really *awkward* to go from C to D#.  That's a really big step.  So you'll see a lot of C#'s instead so that the step to the D# isn't too big.  Melodic minor seems that it goes up one way and down another, right?  But in reality, it can go up and down both ways, depending on the chords.  If there's a D# in the chord, you'll usually see the C# next to it, not C natural.  If there's a D natural, you'll see a C natural.  If there's a C natural, you'll see a D natural.  If C#, you'll see D#.\n\nIf you look at the music, you'll see that it uses the D# and C#, though it also has that really big step in the third measure from the D# down to the C natural, which is a little unusual as I mentioned.  The music is really clearly focused on the E.  That's how you know it's in E.  The C# and D# make that focus stronger.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414993380", "subreddit": "Learnmusic", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

They knew I couldn't go fast in the tree so they taunted me by skipping and laughing whistleing, just to let me know that in the end they had no doubt that they would get me. I leap to the next tree, almost missing. They follow me from tree to tree.\n\n\"Hey boy, you better stay still!\"\nBANG! ZZZZING!\n\nI jump into the next tree but not before I let out a pathetic whimper. The bullet grazed my arm, taking out a nice chunk of flesh. I quickly rip off some cloth from my prisoner grabs and tie it off. Blood leaves a trail. I let the pain subside then I move on to the next tree. Tree after tree,  shot after shot. Non got me though, I assume they are now just fucking with my head, trying to scare me or get me to fall. I haven't yet. \n\nI finally get to a tree strong enough to climb higher. I climb it, adding another ten foot gap between me and my tormentors.\n\nI look down at my hunters. Four of them, surrounding me, guns trained on my torso. \n\n\"Come down and play like the good little boy that you are! Come onnnnn, please little boy! I just want to TASTE YOU! WAHAHAHAHAH!\"\n\nThere goes that laugh again. This bastard is crazier than the prisoners being forced here.\n\nI here a snap... What was that. I turn around and look up. I see nothing. Wierd\n\nSnap... snap... I twist my whole body, ready to defend myself if necessary. Nothing again.\n\nSNAP... I hear one right behind me. I twist again but again find nothing. What the hell is going on? I look down to focus back on my tormentors.\n\n\"What the...\" I suprisedly exclaim. My four lovely tormentors lay dead on the ground, a sharp stick sunken deep into the three companions skulls. The fourth one, my main tormentor, had his head smashed completely in, most likely from the bloody rock laying where his head was previously. \n\nFour other prisoner are hunched over the bodies. One of them was tall and bulky looking, his whole body a rippling mass if destruction. He was searching the main hunter. The other three where searching the other dead men. One of the prisoners, a Spanish looking fellow, wielded what looked like a bow made out of reeds and a smoothed stick. The other two were holding some more sharpened spears, and after pulling the spears from the three bodies and cleaning them, they each held three spears, placing two of them on each of their backs and keeping one on hand. At a closer look I could tell that they were twin. All of a sudden they all look up.\n\n\"Are you going to come down or do we have to come up there and get you ourselves?\" The large one bellowed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1414994929", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The most broken up until like even diamond is camping lanes as a jungler. It's more effective in low elos but essentially in low elos if you camp a lane the enemy laner tells their jungler to go fuck themselves and they go afk or feed. Camping like a lane where your ally is Fizz or Zed or a Lucian or Ryze or Darius or even a Yi, someone who can single handedly carry. If you camp that lane you not only get your carry fed but their laner gets so pissed off that they rage at their jungler so their jungle will either not gank or give into pressure attempt a 2v2 in which it's a double kill for you. Splitpushing in low elos is broken, people have poor map awareness so it's fairly easy in bronze, just buy wards and ward their jungle and get a good split pusher like Nidalee and just hard push to their inhibitor. Anything that can really make someone rage is amazing against low elo players, if you play Ryze and Q W E Q them every single time they go for a cs to the point they can't cs, they'll usually get inpatient and try to kill you or try get cs and die. \nSo seeing as splitpushing and camping a lane are so god damn effective, Shaco is by far one of the best champions in solo queue right now.

{"body": "&gt;This record might also be her, but I'm not sure. The father and mother's name are almost the same and it would make sense since Germans usually end up going by their second name. It's also only a year off from the census records birth date.\n\nCould you please post an imgur picture of the record? I am German, but I don't have access to ancestry. (Simply makes no sense for me and my research.)\n\nAlso, Germans don't have fixed first and middle names, so you are incorrect. Germans usually don't go by middle names, because they don't have any. Most older Germans have a string of names, ranging from 1 to 6 names. Out of these names the so-called \"rufname\" (call name) is picked, it can be at any place in the row of names. This call name is what is generally called first name in English, but strictly and legally speaking the full string of names is the first name. Their order should also not be changed. This causes a problem with English sites and their set-up with first and middle names, because the name that is first in the string of names shows up as first name / call name. \n\nFor example, my ggfather name is Andreas Gustav Friederich Gruss. His call name is Gustav, so to distinguish his call name I would either underline it as it is traditionally done, mark his call name with a star or type it differently. Like so: \n\nAndreas G u s t a v Friederich Gruss\n\nAndreas *Gustav* Friederich Gruss\n\nAndreas Gustav* Friederich Gruss\n\nAndreas GUSTAV Friederich GRUSS\n\nSee that I am not changing the order of the names no matter what? It annoys me to no end when sites with the English set-up insist calling my ggf Andreas Gruss simply bc Andreas is first in the row when his real name (call name) is Gustav.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415070445", "subreddit": "Genealogy", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't quite follow. You should definitely have an implementation for `ListIterator` assuming that you're using the `ArrayList` as your post claims, since the implementation is part of Java's standard library.\n\nAnyway, here's the code that you posted, formatted sanely (ALWAYS use braces around conditionals and loops or put the body on the same line):\n\n\titer = aList.listIterator(3);\n\tSystem.out.println(iter.next());\n\tprint(aList, iter.nextIndex());\n\n\t// ...\n\n\tpublic static void print(List&lt;String&gt; aList, int cursorIndex) {\n\t\tif (aList == null) return;\n\t\tint counter = 0;\n\t\tListIterator&lt;String&gt; iter = aList.listIterator();\n\n\t\twhile (iter.hasNext()) {\n\t\t\tif (counter == cursorIndex) System.out.print(\"| \");\n\t\t\tSystem.out.print(iter.next() + \" \");\n\t\t\tcounter++;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif (counter == cursorIndex) System.out.print(\"| \");\n\t\tSystem.out.println();\n\t}\n\nSo, you pass `aList` (`[A,B,C,D,E,F]`) with the cursor index being 4.\n\nInside `print`, we get the iterator from the beginning of the list (the `aList.listIterator(3)` stuff doesn't affect this at all). We then iterate through this and print out the vertical bar when we encounter the cursor and the element of the list. The conditional outside of the loop doesn't do anything unless the cursor happened to be the last index, in which case you'd get a vertical bar at the end of the list.\n\nSo for your input, you'll get: `A B C D | E F` as output, since `cursorIndex` is 4 and thus counter must be incremented 4 times (but the bar won't be printed until after the fourth element).\n\nIf we called `print(aList, 6)`, we'd get `A B C D E F |`", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415074959", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Your skill order for 1-6 will be W Q W Q E R, meaning that you're almost incapable of ganking until at least level 5. \n\nThe advantage to this playstyle is that you can provide a decent initiation for your teammates, do tons of damage, and blow up the enemy back line pretty easily. On the downside, you lose map pressure pre-6 and if you die while fed your team is worse off than if you built more as an initiator. \n\nThe second style is as more of a bruiser. W Q E skill order allows you to gank early (although you might have to flash). You'll want to get Nashor's Tooth, RoA, Zhonya's, Abyssal, Sorc Shoes or Mercury's Treads, and your SotSW. With this build, you do far less single-target damage but you won't melt instantly upon entering a fight.

{"body": "I'm going to assume you are talking about SQL DBMSs.. In SQL every row occupies a single contiguous space in the disk, but they aren't added to the disk in the order they are added to the table. Not necessarily, that is.\n\nFirst you need to understand the concept of **indexes**. Indexes are sorted lists. However they are actually B-trees, which is basically a sorted list where each item of the list is another sorted list.\n\nA graph of a B-tree is something like this:\n\n    A\n    --Amanda\n    --Amelia\n    B\n    --Beck\n    --Bob\n    --Buddha\n    C\n    --Carl\n\nImagine you are looking at a phone list. When you search for a phone number, first you try to find the initial letter, then you look at the first name in each page so you can narrow down how many names you have to look at individually. B-trees work the same way.\n\nIn SQL databases you use an index to make look-ups in a certain column faster. What it does is copy-paste the data of the row in another place, the index, in a sorted way. When time the data of an indexed column changes, its position on the index may have changed too, so it has to be removed and reinserted in the index, which is a cheap operation for small pieces of data like integers but rather expensive for strings.\n\nSo now you know indexes are copy-pasted data from the table that is sorted in an easy to search way, right? What does that have to do with the layout of the table?\n\nIn SQL the **clustered index** is an index that contains all the data of the table, however not all of it is necessarily sorted. The sorted part, the index, comes first in the B-tree form, then its followed by the rest of the columns in a contiguous way. By default the clustered index's \"sorted part\" is created with the primary key of the table. If the primary key changes the whole row has to be moved around in the disk to its new sorted position, plus, just like normal indexes, that may mean a lot of rows are \"shifted forward\" to make room.\n\nConsider the diagram:\n\n    A C D E F\n    A C B E F &lt;- D changed to B\n    A C C B E F &lt;- copied what's after B's new position one space forward\n    A B C B E F &lt;- copied B to its new position\n    A B C E F F &lt;- copied what's after B's old position one space backward\n    A B C E F &lt;- deleted duplicate\n\nBecause it's such a costly operation the primary key is should be a value that never changes. However, if a new key is added it has to be sorted and possibly inserted in the middle, which would result in the operation above. That's why primary keys are usually an auto-incrementing integer. Since auto-incrementing indexes are always one value higher than the last one the rows are always added at the end of the index, no \"shifting\" of data is necessary.\n\nThat's basically how it is.

I and many supporting Gamergate believe this should have been disclosed or that Grayson should have recused himself from writing this article.\n\nOf course there was a friendship during the lead up to the article, Mr. Bain. Totilo wants his reporters to be friendly with game devs, to make human connections with people (living breathing human beings) on the inside of the industry. That's how sources work -- he explained this all to you. And also, NEWS FLASH: sexual relationships are unpredictable and can escalate quickly, so when you say so-and-so was too close to his subject when he wrote about her, you are now in the realm of assumption. [Maybe he should have recused himself? Maybe not](https://s-media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/cd/50/60/cd5060bdac1d4eab166c0f31f600e1e3.jpg) -- not your call to make when we don't have any reason to be cynical.\n\n&gt;After 10+ articles were released in the course of one day, claiming \"gamers are dead\" and using hurtful and incendiary language to condemn the identity of many innocent people, #Gamergate exploded, after the term was coined by actor Adam Baldwin. \n\nHonestly, shit like this is just sad at this point. I can understand the impressive lack of reading comprehension required to misinterpret those articles to such a degree, but come on... the Baldwin tweet linked to a horrid Quinnspiracy video. This \"consumer revolt\" was misogynist from the start, straight up.\n\n&gt;In the course of this, Anita Sarkeesian released her latest video and inserted herself into the discussion. \n\nHer fault! Her fault she got those rape, death, and bomb threats. Her fault for, [as you put it](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sd042v), enabling their behavior! Not like she was a target *before* this whole thing started for years or anything.\n\nMr. Bain, lets not forget how you [inserted yourself](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s4nmr1) into this whole shitfuck before it was even a \"consumer revolt.\" I bet you ZQ really appreciated you having a nice, objective conversation about her sex life with your 300k+ twitter folllowers. **E T H I C S**\n\n&gt;They raised money for anti-bullying causes after Gawker employee Sam Biddle, tweeted to his tens of thousands of followers that he endorsed the bullying of nerds.\n\nAre you kidding me? Does someone need to literally explain to you that he was joking? Rhetorical question the answer is yes -- so I'll do it. He's joking. Nobody will ever seriously \"endorse bullying,\" not even [uber-jock Sam Biddle.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UeyN-r_lEz4/UQAgvgoF_qI/AAAAAAAAG3c/uQltVx0jBwE/s1600/ogre-nerds.gif) Jesus Christ. That's why it's so hilarious that one of GG's crowning achievements is getting Adobe to proclaim that they do not, in fact, support bullying. You did it, guys!\n\n&gt;Do we honestly believe this is an organized effort to drive women out of the industry? If that were true, why on earth would the targets be a controversial Youtube critic and two practically unknown indie developers? Wouldn't people be trying to drive out women of note in the industry who work at major studios and have real influence over the direction of games? If this is a harassment campaign aimed at driving women out of gaming, it is the single most unsuccessful one in the history of mankind.\n\nYeah, because that's how abusers and predators work! They target the strongest, most powerful people -- after all, they're the easiest to victimize.\n\nBTW John I'm being sarcastic. The reason they target indie devs and feminist critics is because these women have had gigantic targets on their backs for years and have little legal means to defend themselves. All it takes is a 4chan thread or, more recently, something you (you specifically) say to set the sexist harassers off.\n\n&gt;A group called GamejournoPros with a large number of \"competiting\" journalists allegedly colluded to blacklist a journalist called Alistair Pinsof and also discussed sending letters of support and gifts to Zoe Quinn, clearly not realising the wall that should exist between subject and journalist.\n\nThe Pinsof guy clearly broke rank with his own employers and put them at significant legal risk. They fired him and it later got out to the industry the kind of employee he was. If one of your employees put you at risk, Mr. Bain, what would you do if you saw him applying to work for your peers like MundaneMatt and InternetAristocrat?\n\nAlso, GJP -- one guy said \"maybe we should get a gift.\" Other people said \"no that's not a good idea.\" There was initial disagreement, discussion, and resolution. Isn't that a sign of success? If you could point to a specific instance of collusion or corruption, since it's all in writing, that would be great. Spoilers: you can't!\n\n&gt;However, if you need real proof that this is about ethics, you need only look at the following. The Escapist, Polygon and Kotaku all revised their ethics policies soon after this began in direct response to it. IGN and various Youtubers have either published ethics codes or intend to do so. If this wasn't about ethics, why would you do that?\n\nBecause everyone is tired of this. Everyone is tired of the harassment, the disgusting misogynist (and oftentimes anti-semitic) rhetoric and propaganda coming from GG. Tired of your bullshit. I know I am. And if it takes adding bare-bones ethical guidelines to shut the Gators up, then great.

{"body": "&gt;This doesn't make the scale magically minor, so I'm confused by your response...\n\nIt sounds like you are confused about tonal harmony in general.  I guess it is a losing battle trying to clear up the guitar magazine level confusion that goes on in /r/guitar, but it really bothers me that this self-sustaining cycle of misinformation about music fundamentals exists in the guitar world.\n\nThe tonality of a musical piece (the key) has two characteristics; A tonal center (tonic, root, pitch center, insert synonym here) and a collection of notes.  \n\nTo use your example:\n\n&gt;If the song was in E minor, he could take his major scale shape, and play it over the relative major position, which is G. It would still contain the same seven notes of the minor key, however, he would be using his major scale shape, which was OPs concern to begin with.\n\nWhat you have described there is 100%, objectively and unarguably playing in the key of E minor.  A 'major scale shape' played starting on G consists of the notes G A B C D E F#.  That gets us the collection part of the tonality, but not the tonal center.  The way the notes are presented in the music creates the tonal center.  If the key is E minor, as you stated, then the music has used the above mentioned collection of notes and defined the tonal center as E, hence E minor.\n\nThere is no musical meaning in the positions chosen to play that collection of notes on the guitar.  If that collection of notes is used with a tonal center of E, then it is E minor.  No magic there, just basic music fundamentals.\n\nWhich goes back to your previous comment:\n\n&gt;Whether the music is major or minor is irrelevant.\n\nIt is absolutely relevant.  It determines which collection of notes is chosen.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415135449", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It comes with time really. Expose yourself to it a lot, try to find tricks and patterns, and things will become automatic. \n\nOne trick that helped me speed up the process of thinking about chords was just internalizing a pattern consisting of every other note in the C  major scale. C E G B D F A C E. Every diatonic triad and seventh chord in C major is in that pattern. If you know what quality all of those chords are, you can change the quality by changing one or two notes. For example, I thought of Cm7 by thinking CEGB and then flattening the 3rd, E, to Eb. Now that I've done it enough, I don't need to use that shortcut to spell Cm7--I just know it off the top of my head. Same with chords starting on a sharped or flatted note. Gb7 is Gb Bb Db Fb. Since we know G7 is G B D F, just flat each of those notes to get Gb7. \n\nSo a fifth from F is just the third note in an F triad. F A C. It's C.\n\nThe notes in G7 are G B D F. A sus chord means that you're using a 4 instead of a 3, so that B is raised to a C, making it G C D F.

Because it lacks a third, it does not have a specific tonality, so a progression based around it can be major or minor in nature.\n\n\n        Dmaj: D E F# A B C#\n    (diatonic: Major minor minor Major Major minor diminished)\n        \n        Dmin: D E F G A Bb C\n    (diatonic: minor diminished Major minor minor Major Major)\n\nI like the sound of Dsus4 - B min , so I decided to make this little progression in D minor. Right now I have a Isus4 - vi, so I need something that wants to resolve (cadence). The V is a solid choice, so let's make that the next chord. The V is dominant, so we'll make it a dominant 7.\n\nFollowing these steps, we have:\n\nDsus4 - B min - A7\n\n                Dsus4     B min      A7       A7\n        e :|: ----10--------7---------5--------5--------- :|:\n        B :|: ----10--------7---------5--------5-------- :|:\n        G :|: ----12--------7---------6--------6-------- :|:\n        D :|: ----12--------9---------5--------5-------- :|:\n        A :|: ----10--------9---------7--------7-------- :|:\n        E :|: ----10--------7---------5--------5-------- :|:\n    \nThis is getting good, but we can change chord flavors to make it even more interesting. Instead of using a bland Bb min, we can lift our pinky from the 9th fret, D string and place it on the 9th fret, high E string. This will turn our Bb min chord into a more flavorful Bb min9 chord.\n\n                Dsus4     B min9     A7      A7\n        e :|: ----10--------9---------5-------5--------- :|:\n        B :|: ----10--------7---------5-------5--------- :|:\n        G :|: ----12--------7---------6-------6--------- :|:\n        D :|: ----12--------7---------5-------5--------- :|:\n        A :|: ----10--------9---------7-------7--------- :|:\n        E :|: ----10--------7---------5-------5--------- :|:\n\nNow, we can decide on a strumming pattern.

{"body": "I'm going to quote a few things from the balanced trainers forum. There's a ton of drama there so take it with a grain of salt. (Each paragraph is a different person).\n\n\"Let's remember that Gary Wilkes wrote a couple clever articles on facebook and next thing you know you have everyone friending him. Again he is a promoter of BSL. Now go and look at his training and its hardly stellar but within a few weeks he got placed on a podium and was suddenly presenting at the IACP conference.\"\n\n\"If this were boxing the term we would be using is \"Paper Champion\". That is basically someone who is a champion that has never accomplished anything because they were always set up to fight people of little or no talent. You have people writing a few articles and the masses nodding their heads. So these people then get a platform.\"\n\n\" I wanted to get clarification on Mr. Wilkes, and wrote the organization I belong to which is the IACP, I didn't get a response and time passed. As a business owner I have to be very careful about public statements, as taught in business school, \"Discuss in private, and agree in public\". I forgot the purpose of the forum. As an IACP member with professional status, I was blown away to hear that Mr. Wilkes was speaking at our conference. Really? Mr. BSL, why? Are his contributions to the dog world so enormous, we can forget the fact he leads the BSL band wagon? I don't think so. Do politics out weigh our values? With all the great minds in the dog world, why gamble on a figure like Gary Wilkes? It raises some personal decisions.\"\n\n\"The IACP should be A S H A M E D of choosing this guy to speak at their function. Forget his idiotic outspoken views against certain breeds that shall (for once) remain nameless - this guy is at best unremarkable as a trainer. If the IACP considers this guy to be of such high merit that he is presenting at their annual conference - a flagship event, no less - then they should just drop me a line and I can put them in touch with at least 5 engaging, charismatic, informative and educated canine behaviour professionals from Australia that will make their heads spin.The silver lining in this is that if the IACP considers Wilkes to be the business, then here in Australia we are truly world class at what we do and how professionally and skilfully many of us approach this craft.I had been eyeing off an IACP membership recently, but that idea is definitely off the boiler at this point.\"\n\nMost people have more of a problem with him because he has said some rather nasty things about pit bulls and BSL, which is a whole different can of worms. If you read his training methods, they are actually not that innovative. Most of his entertaining writing is tearing other people apart rather than introducing something new or explaining something in a ground-breaking manner. \n\nSuffice it to say he is a \"controversial\" figure. I will not say whether he's good or bad because I honestly don't know. But I do think he has an agenda, as much as he likes to criticize positive trainers for being ideologues.

These are compliments, dammit!\n\nI know this isn't a final mix, but if it was, I'd say the acoustic winds up arm-wrestling with the vocal.  Which is bad;  the most intriguing aspect of this song is the vocal.  The harmonies, especially on the second chorus, are lovely.  \n\nI'm not sure I would say this has two choruses.  I think what you're referring to as the first chorus is more of a second verse.  It doesn't deviate enough from the first verse to be a proper chorus.  I only say this because I think you'll find yourself in songwriting quicksand if you think of it as a chorus.  As I hear it the structure is A A B A (kinda) C \n\nHere's what I would do:\n\nAfter the B (time spent alone),  cut out the return of the opening chords and go right to the start of the build at 1:19 with the drums.  Then the chorus suddenly becomes well epic-er.\n\nI don't think the stuff after the chorus works.  Or rather, I think something could work better than what you've got.  I myself would repeat the chor progression of the chorus but without the vocals, and have a lead guitar play some kinda counter-melody to the sung chorus vocal.  Then you could pull a Neil young and go into a very very long solo from here, or just a short kinda solo.  I think of guitar solos as the Greek chorus of rock n roll:  they should provide another perspective on the song, a kind of commentary.  \n\nAfter the guitar bit, I'd repeat the chorus, but drop everything out once you sing \"along\" and sing the \"before you're gone\" a Capella.

{"body": "Revelent Sled Driver passage:\n\n&gt;I was accustomed to being on the boom for just a few m i n utes to top off i n\nfighters. In contrast, SR-71 refuelings took fifteen m i n utes or more which could\nseem like an eternity. This time was needed because the airplane took on a n\nincredible amount of fuel. During a normal refueling w e usually received over\n11,000 gallons. This changed our gross weight by 70,000 pounds a n d caused a\ncorrespon d i ng change i n the center of gravity of our a i rcraft.\nAt the slow 300 knot range i n which we were flying to refuel, the feel of the jet\nbecame sluggish as the SR filled with fuel. At these gross weights a n d slower\na i rspeeds, the SR-71 became thrust limited during the last few m i n utes of refu eling.\nIn m i l itary power, we would start to fall off the boom. A disconnect was highly\nu n d esirable since the jet was less responsive now a n d to reconnect was more\ndifficult. It also meant wasting time on the refu eling track a n d this could affect our\novera l l mission timing. The solution was to light one afterburner with careful\nfinesse. The fine art of pulling the throttle ever so slightly up a n d just into the\nm i n i m u m burner range was h a n d ed down from one generation of SR pilots to the\nnext. The SR is the only a i rplane I know that required the use of afterburner to stay\non the boom.\n\n&gt;Using one afterburner caused another problem: asymmetrical thrust. Some pilots\nused a little rudder to handle the yaw. Others left the rudders alone, flew sideways,\na n d looked out the front quarter panel to see forwa rd.

{"body": "Hi there! I like to consider myself a Riven main; she's actually the reason I started playing league haha. Here's some answers and tips to help a fellow Riven player.\n\n&gt; Is it good to E Q Q Q AA W or should I initiate with Q jumps and just try to hit the third Q for the knockup?\n\nI generally engage with EQW. The stun prevents an escape unless they bust their flash the moment you EQ. It's also better to AA between each Q because of her passive. However, you honestly don't really need to know how to do that unless you have the rest of her combos down. For trading, usually EQAAWQAAQ and then E away. For an extended trade, maybe a kill, I do something like E-R-Q-AA-Q-AA-R-W-Q-AA. It's really situational. The reason you can do these combos fast is because of how easy it is to cancel Riven's animations with her other abilities. I can't really explain it, because I'm better at executing it, but there's tons youtube guides for it. \n\n&gt;How do you play against ranged top     \n\nDon't ever pick Riven into Ryze. He has a lot of CC and a LOT of damage that's annoying to play against. I normally start either Doran's Shield or Doran's blade, depending on how I want to play. Most ranged top laners are rather squishy, and you can abuse that early. \n\n&gt;And how is playstyle in general?\n\nRiven's not much of an initiator, she's more of a figher/assassin who waits for others to engage first. Pick off the squishy ADC or APC, or anyone else who managed to straggle behind. In a teamfight, Riven is better to walk around and flank them, instantly killing the squishies. \n\nShe's also a brilliant split pusher, because of her dueling and outplay potential. They're going to NEED to send someone after you and she can easily 1v2. \n\nAsk me anything if you have questions, but watch some BoxBox videos since he's an amazing Riven. He can show you the true outplay potential of Riven lol.

{"body": "&gt;the 5 different types of images\n\nThere are only 5 different types of images?\n\nReshape does what it sounds like - it reshapes a matrix.  In that line, the idea is to convert the M x N 2D image matrix to a M\\*N x 1 1D vector, multiply that by another 1 x 3 1D vector representing the colormap, resulting in a M\\*N x 3 2D matrix.  Then use reshape() to convert that to a M x N x 3 3D matrix of the right size for displaying the image.  \n\nYou could get the same result by using repmat() to repeat the colormap vector in the M and N dimensions into a M x N x 3 matrix, then using element-wise multiplication of that on a M x N x 3 repeat of the 2D image data (again using repmat(), but along the 3rd dimension) but matrix multiplication + reshape() is faster.  \n\nGraphics objects in MATLAB are nested.  For example, axes are often children of figures, which makes the figure the parent of the axes.  We can use the handle of an object directly to address it, or we can find that handle by looking at the 'Parent' or 'Children' property of the child or parent object, respectively.  Since you record the handle for the axes but not the image itself in the handles structure, the code looks in the 'Children' property of the axes to find the handle of the image, which is a child of the axes, and then deletes that.  \n\nA gif stores image information as an array of values that do not correspond to colors on their own, but rather refer to values in a colormap or look-up table that is part of the .gif format.  In one image that I had and one that you had we actually had images that looked the same (black objects on white background) but the colormaps were opposite.  That means that if we looked only at the values in the image matrix they would be opposite of one another (black was a high value in my image but a low value in yours).  To correct for this the information in the colormap was needed, which is what the extra 'if' statement is for in the GIF format case.  The code in that section will only work in the specific case of B+W or grayscale images, but in this case it works.

{"body": "&gt;\"We're at the play now,\" said Amy to Sonic even though she was surrounded by people who were neither of them.\n\n-\n\n&gt;The play eventually started, and it was just as gay as you thought it would be. There was singing and songs but otherwise it was just like the Christmas Story always was. Mary got a letter from an angel saying she was going to have a baby, but she did not want to have the baby at home because the King would not let babies vote, so Mary and Joseph rode bikes all the way from London to Jerusalem. When they got to there, the hospital was full, so they went to a barn and had the baby in there, and it turned out to be the legendary hero Jesus.\n\nThis story sounds a lot better than the original...\n\n-\n\n&gt;The bomb exploded with a huge explosion, like a bunch of horses made of fire running through the place. Suddenly people did not really care about the play anymore because the place was full of fire and could kill you.\n\n-\n\n&gt;People were leaving and not helping the other people get out, but the lunch lady who had ears but was deaf was running into the auditorium and carrying women and children back out. The lunch lady lived in Mongolia by herself as a child and became very strong from carrying trees back from the frozen forests to the villages that she traveled between so now she could carry stacks of people. Since she was deaf all of the noises that the fire was making did not bother her because she could not hear.\n\nI think this lunch lady is the most badass character in this entire fic. \n\n-\n\n&gt;Chapter 15: Killer on the Looce\n\n&gt;AUTHOR'S NOTE: I wrote this chapter on a TRAIN!\n\n&gt;Shadow and Silver ran ahead into the school but Sonic stopped to go to the bathroom, and he took an enormous, bad-smelling poop. Sonic knew he must be very emotional because this poop was so big that when he tried to flush the toilet, the big poop log just folded in half and clogged the toilet easily while looking like part of a really fat pretzel that you would get at the mall, not like the little ones in bags from the supermarket. Sonic just said, \"Forget it,\" and ran out of the now very stinky bathroom and after Charmy Bee.\n\n-\n\n&gt;One room that Sonic looked in was the Art Room. It made Sonic remember having Art class with Charmy Bee. Charmy could not control his gay urges like everyone else and used all the colors in every picture, where like Sonic just used blue and Amy just used pink and other people were also normal like that. Sonic thought about how this was and that it was still surprising that Charmy could do something like this.\n\n&gt;Shadow went into a room, among other rooms, that was the Car Fixing Room. Shadow remembered about how he had Car Fixing class with Charmy and how Charmy was really terrible at fixing cars because it was not in him to do something that was like a man would do. Shadow thought it was weird how Charmy could now do something that was so manly like killing.\n\n&gt;And one room that Silver ran into was the Gym Room, where Silver one time had Gym class with Charmy Bee. He remembered how Charmy was positively the worst at sports and being an athlete, so it made him wonder why Charmy could do something that was actually doing something, like killing.\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"I have heard this smell a million times before!\" said Amy to Rouge, who could say this because she was Sonic's GirlFriend, meaning that she has been around Sonic pooping. \"This smell is Sonic's poop!\"\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"Use your special move while you can!\" Amy knew what Rouge was talking about so Amy used her special attack.\n\n&gt;Amy shouted \"Girl Blood!\" and opened her legs and a stream of blood shot at Charmy.\n\nno no no noNON NO N ON O NO N ON O NO O N O N O NO NO NO\n\n-\n\n&gt;This shows you that you can be cool by being smart (except if you are a nerd ass).\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"Also, Knuckles is having trouble with grades. Now that he has become a baby, he has not turned in any of his homework or tests and he is going to fail High School and get kicked out if he doesn't do them.\"\n\n-\n\n&gt;Sonic picked up Knuckles and Knuckles Jr and put them in his backpack and went to the rest of his classes and then went home. Sonic got home and opened his backpack and took Knuckles and Knuckles Jr out and put them on his bed.\n\nHE KEPT INFANTS IN HIS BACKPACK FOR HALF THE SCHOOL DAY\n\nDID HE LEAVE IT OPEN\n\nI DON'T... HELP\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"Okay then,\" said Knuckles to Sonic. \"When we are alone and not being held by Rouge, we like to practice kissing on each other. It is technically okay because I am Knuckles Jr's dad and a dad is allowed to kiss his baby.\"\n\n&gt;\"Cool,\" said Sonic. \"Show me.\" So Knuckles and Knuckles Jr got very up close to each other and kissed each other in a really good way. It was okay because they are father and son and also both brothers and that is allowed everywhere, and it is not illegal, even if they are both babies now. The two of them kissing looked like two big not sexual caterpillars pushing themselves together. It was not a sexual kiss, but it was a big, gold medal kiss anyway.\n\n&gt;\"Wow, I can tell you are both going to be romance experts when you grow up,\" said Sonic. \"I would ask you for tips but it would probably then be against the law.\" Sonic asked them to kiss one more time, and they did, but Sonic videotaped it this time so that he would know how to kiss Amy even better next time they kissed, which would be when she gets out of dentetion. Then they all had a root beer and talked about which girls are the hottest.\n\nFUCK NO NONONONO NO NO NO IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE DEAR GOD SAVE ME\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"Weak pussy!\" Knuckles Jr laughed because he was kidding, but Sonic did not think it was that funny and gave him a look that was like he just took the pickles off Sonic's hamburger that he pacifically asked for pickles on. In addition, Sonic really liked pickles.\n\n-\n\n&gt;Since she was deaf, when she talked, it sounded weird and kind of like Big the Cat, where you think she is retarded but she actually is not, and it just because she is deaf so everything she says sounds totally wrong. It sounded more like \"Wad id id, chodran?\" than normal language. Big the Cat was actually retarded though so it was different.\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"No, that is not how you thank me,\" said the lunch lady. When the lunch lady lived in Bangladesh as a young woman she learned about the ancient tradition of Sex Thanking and she explained it all to Sonic.\n\n&gt;\"So you want me to give you sex with my mouth?\" said Sonic to the lunch lady.\n\n&gt;\"Yes, because it is ancient tradition. It is not slutty,\" said the lunch lady, who was also really tall.\n\n-\n\n&gt;Sonic opened his mouth and chewed on the lunch lady's vagina really hard like Pac-Man running into the bottom of one of the ghosts nonstop. She was totally quiet while he did this, but she was beating on the ground and making huge holes like meteors and even hit a tree nearby and it broke in half because she was so in love with Sonic's abilities. Sonic nibbled on her outer vagina and it tasted like a birthday cake. His penis even popped up during this like a meerkat looking out for its family on Meerkat Manor. He kept on going closer into her vagina and making sure to get every part of it on the way down like a window washer in New York City washing windows but instead it was her vagina, so it was sexy. Sonic also kissed and sucked on her vagina like he was trying to appreciate the secret sauce in the lunch lady's roast beef sandwich without opening the sandwich. Sonic even used his tongue and scooped eggs out of her vagian that were made during the female reproduction process. He kept going further into her vagina until he was able to fit his entire head in.\n\nLORD HELP ME \n\nSAVE ME\n\nGOD SAVE THE QUEEN\n\nI CAN'T\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"Stop it!\" shouted Sonic. \"Stop doing this!\" Sonic was sick of hitting his head into Vector's penis. It was beginning to leave a mark, and it was embarrassing to Sonic to have someone else's penis mark on your head. \"This better come out before school,\" said Sonic, rubbing the mark Vector's penis left on his forhead.\n\n-\n\n&gt;Knuckles Jr glided across Vector's semen like a baby speedboat and did a roller coaster turn and flew up on to Vector. \n\nWHAT IS HAPPENING\n\n-\n\n&gt;\"Where did you get a Charmy robot? Is Eggman involved? This could ruin things for everyone, don't you know!\" said Sonic back to Vector like a ship sending a message to a different ship.\n\nThe similes in this are fascinating, js. \n\n-\n\n&gt;\"When you begin to do crimes, you become dark, and I have now become darker than Shadow! I made friends with Al Qaeda and they made me a Charmy robot using Osama Ben Laden's technology!\"\n\n-\n\n&gt;Sonic scratched his balls and held on to Knuckles Jr while Tails flew down fast again. Sonic's balls dragged behind him in the sky and then they went down to the bottom of the ground and Sonic's diseased balls smacked right into Vector's face.\n\n&gt;\"NOOOO!\" screamed Vector as Sonic's balls smacked into his mouth and nose and eyes like a plastic bag full of pudding. Vector looked into the sky and made an asshole face for the last time and then he turned into stone and then turned into dust and was now dead.\n\n&gt;\"I can be glad for ones that my balls are very poisonous,\" said Sonic as he looked at the pile of dust that was Vector before he died and did some squinting. \"He is dead and everyone is ok now.\"\n\n-\n\nThat was chapters 14-18.

You only see that kind of capability in the huge full tower cases. What would the dimensions of a case like that be in L x W x H? I'd imagine it would have to be pretty tall or pretty wide.

{"body": "I was flying back from India after spending a couple months there this summer.\n\nI want to note that on the 6-hour drive *to* the airport, I'd felt some motion and altitude sickness, and maybe some dehydration, but nothing much had happened.\n\nAfter boarding, I watch a Bollywood movie, it was pretty good. So I eat some of the airplane food, and let me tell you, United does *not* know how to make Indian food. It was completely unpalatable. But it was also the first of only 2 meals I'd get over 20 hours of flying, so I ate it.\n\nMistake. \n\nI took a nap, and woke up in the middle of the \"night,\" meaning that pretty much everyone on the plane was asleep, too.\n\nAnd I have to shit.\n\nI mean, I have to shit really. Really. Bad.\n\nSo, clenching my anus tighter than a vice grip, I climb over the two people in between me and the aisle, slip on one of them, and plant myself face-first into the armrest of one of the chairs in the central seats. I then make my way to the bathroom, trying to play it off, like how cats do when they try to jump onto the counter and misjudge the height.\n\nI get in the restroom, pants down, sit on the toilet, and unleash the holiest of holies. I mean, there was a little plug of solid waste holding it all in, but after that, this was just a thick brown liquid jet of assjuice flowing like the Ganges out my rectum. Every few seconds the stream would stop, and I'd be greeted with an enormous ball of gas. It sounded like machine gun fire and artillery shellings, but the war was only just begun.\n\nI felt something coming up my esophagus. I could feel it rising up, like some sort of chunky snake slithering its way up my throat. I opened my mouth and burped, which sent another gushing burst of old muddy water forth from my ass, but then the air stopped in my throat. There was... something... there.\n\nI don't know how many of you have spent a lot of time in this situation, but an airplane bathroom isn't structured right for what I was going through right then. I needed to barf in the sink, but the firehose that was my anal cavity was still putting out the unholy hellfire of half-processed indian food.\n\nSo I did what anyone else would do, and stood up.\n\nI didn't vomit, I wouldn't say it was vomit. You know how when you open a can of something that's been frozen, and it just kinda, slides out, but retains the can shape? I'm trying to communicate this perfectly, here. A gelatinous can-shaped chunk of airplane food slit right out of my mouth and into the bathroom sink. It jiggled a little bit. \n\nMy ass was spraying all over the walls. And that's when the nosebleed started.\n\nI instinctively reached for the paper towels, which meant my ass-spray was directed at another wall, but then I vomited again--more liquid this time, and all over my hands. I was worried that the inside of my nose would get infected with the vomit. So I start trying to hock it up, you know, like, how you can vibrate your soft palate and kinda suck it back down? And then I tried blowing it out...\n\nWhich meant there was now blood, vomit, and shit covering everything.\n\n**E V E R Y T H I N G.**\n\nAnd then it all stopped. With a whimpering squeak, all was quiet on my southern front.\n\nI plugged my nose with some tissues and spent the next half-hour cleaning the restroom. Then I went to sleep again.\n\n**TL;DR** Don't fly United.\n\n*Edit: Wow, 3 Golds. Didn't expect that when I hastily typed the story out this morning... As I've replied to other commenters: yes, it's real. I've told the story to family and friends several times since returning, and it always puts people in a good mood. Glad I was able to do the same for y'all. This was the July 5th flight from Delhi to Newark, so it was before the Ebola outbreak, in a place where Ebola doesn't exist. I cleaned very well, but that's just basic human decency. Also, I don't really blame United for all of it. But things had also gone wrong with them in the Newark to Delhi flight (in a way that they should have a better policy for), so I don't like them as a company anymore.*", "gilded": 3, "created_utc": "1415288513", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2858, "controversiality": 0}

Now I'm not saying we shouldn't do what the bible says, but it seemed stupid to me.\n\nSo it is hard for me to like my family when I don't have the same views as they do.

Our hero /u/MrNitler almost accomplished this if it was not for the suprise summoning of skeletons that blocked the hook - our second hero fell under the safety of the Radiant middle tier one tower.\n\nIn the third game our hero, 5 man carries pls. - LPQ warrior fought valiantly but died in the tree clearing on the cliffside of the Radiant middle tier one tower. The deaths were premature in all aspects.\n\nKillingmonster5 Played as our fourth hero. Our hero placed blue eyes in the dire forrest scaring away the hard and a middle creep camps from gathering neutrals. Our Overlord resorted to presuade an Ogre Frostmage. Ice armor was cast which protected many innocents. The battle was fierce and our Overlord's defeat was imminent. Alas the pudge accidentally fiddled with the courier and lost his life a second time whilst saving the defenseless beast.\n\ni RKO BABY SEALS was our fifth last hope, the battle ws fought valiantly by both sides. First blood was spillt and drunk by the patched-together beast in a skrimish that left the victor almost dead. Our Overlord suprised our hero with a Dagon and scored second blood, However, since Our Overlord is vegan, no blood was drunk but instead, reintroduced back into the earth from which it had came.  in the end, the Radiant middle tier one tower fell and our Overlord emerged victorious despite any possible objections from our hero.\no\nOur 5th hero, IO lost in what could only have been regarded as a premature game - before the 9th wave spawn. Still, valiant Effort IO!\n\nOur 6th heo is me, I lost because 2.8k mmr scrub and r[A]t doto. Shameful display.\n\nOur seventh hero is Wang(TM) who promptly lost after it was discovered that our Overlord had bought a dagon. This was not before first blood was drawn by our hero which in all probability tasted like cranberry juice.\n\nOur eight hero was Peter Loew, the supposedly omniscient observer just had to go get a toothbrush and consequently missed the ending. However, our Overlord emerged victorious.\n\nOur Nineth hero was The square root of oldskool. The battle was short, our Overlord emerged victorious. Again, the supposed omniscient observer missed the action as it prooved hard to google \"how to make the square root sign on reddit\"\n\nOur tenth hero was Terrible with a blade. All that can be said was that a Pudge opening up with a null talisman does not bode well. Our Overlord electrocuted our hero with a dagon and thus emerged victorious.\n\nOur eleventh hero HAYW1RE fought valianty but lost his second life on a cliff.

{"body": "I would highly recommend trying out Matrice's build: 3 Wraith bands, Yasha, Quelling Blade and BoT by 14-15 minute mark. \n\nTo get to this, skill illusions over metamorphosis. My build looks like this: E W E W W R W E E Q R Stats until lvl 23 Q Q Q. My starting items depend on the lane I'm going to. If I go to the side lanes, I start with 8 tangoes, 5 gg branches, and 1 salve on courier (which can be dropped on ground near trees or near T2) as that gives me best survivability in lane and from ganks. If Im going mid I would go for Wraith Band and 4 tangoes. Then Work on getting 3 wraith bands, followed by quelling blade, boots and finally Yasha. \n\nNow, to get to BoT in under 15 minutes, you will have to push towers. With the recent changes, there are a lot more glyphs to defend against T1s. So, go to a side lane, threaten the T1 until they glyph + TP, then keep ur illusions in the lane and move to jungle. While in meta form, clear out 2-3 camps including the small one and go back to base to heal up. TP to the other lane and now wait till you get meta, and then push the tower there. What normally happens is you will have heroes fighting in or near the mid lane, or near the other side lane as you were just there. And, their glyph will not come back before you get your meta form, so you will easily get this tower. Getting last hit on the tower gives a big influx of gold, and using that, you can easily farm BoT before 15 minutes.\n\nAfterwards, convert the yasha either into SnY or Manta. I normally convert it into SnY if I can actually finish these 6 items before the 15 minute mark and if I have to teamfight a lot in the next 10-20 minutes, so I have SnY by 18-20 minutes and then fight or push tower. If I feel like ratting is the only way to win (everyone except you has been feeding their hardcarry continuosly) then I go straight for Manta and keep split pushing.\n\nAfter SnY/Manta, I always go for Skadi, as Skadi is your signature item. After Skadi come the situational items: BKB if the enemy has a lot of spells or MKB is they get evasion and such. Make sure you get atleast one butterfly towards late game.\n\nYou can also get one point in Q in laning stage to either setup or secure kills as teh 2s slow is really useful.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415350449", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(Skip to edit number 2 at the end if you don't want to read much and just need a single source)\n\n&gt;Do dialects have to be mutually intelligible to some degree?\n\nNope.\n\n&gt;What is the difference between a \"Language\" and a \"Dialect\" ?\n\nThere is no objective real universal distinction. Any two speech varieties that have known common ancestry can just as scientifically be called dialects as easily as calling them languages. The line is drawn entirely by other sociopolitical motivations. While mutual intelligibility is often used as a justification, it's not a good one for universality or objectiveness, since it's almost impossible to objectively judge the mutual intelligibility of two varieties for a number of reasons which I'll skip over here but can expand upon if needed. However one issue is that mutual intelligibility doesn't take into account dialect continua, which are very common. Imagine A B C D and E are related languages in communities that are in a line from point A to point E.  A speaker of B can understand A and C, and D can understand E and C, but a speaker of E cannot understand a speaker of A. This is a dialect continuum, and it's a very typical situation. It's not hard to get two varieties of a single language that cannot understand each other without using some other form of communication, like a third speech variety.\n\nSomeone's going to reply to you with a quote about \"an army and a navy\" but this is also probably going to be misinterpreted, and still isn't a good determiner, since there are many languages which we call languages that lack any sort of political power behind them. A language is not simply a \"dialect with an army and a navy\".\n\nScientifically there is no difference. Any way that the distinction is made is entirely extralinguistic. My favourite explanation of the very flexible distinctions as as follows:\n\n&gt; A *variety* is any body of human speech patterns which is sufficiently homogeneous to be analyzed by available techniques of synchronic description and which has a sufficiently large repertory with broad enough semantic scope to function in all normal contexts of communication.\n\n&gt; A *language* consists of all varieties which share a single super-posed variety having substantial similarity in phonology and grammar with the included varieties of which are mutually intelligible or are connected by a series of mutually intelligible varieties.\n\n&gt; A *dialect* is any set of one or more varieties of a language which share at least sone feature or combination of features setting them apart from other varieties of the language, and which may appropriately be treated as a unit on linguistic or non-linguistic grounds.\n\n* from Furgeson, Charles A. &amp; Gumperz, John J., *Linguistic Diversity in South Asia*, International Journal of American Linguistics, 1960\n\nI know a number of people who only ever use \"variety\" because it feels less loaded, and then they don't have to get into arguments with non-linguists about the difference between languages and dialects. \"Variety\" is just really convenient for that.\n\nBut again, objectively, there's no scientific difference. It's really just a matter of convention, and the terms are used interchangeably within linguistics.\n\nSources:\n\n* Furgeson, Charles A. &amp; Gumperz, John J., *Linguistic Diversity in South Asia*, International Journal of American Linguistics, 1960\n\n* [Dialect, Language, Nation.

{"body": "Not OP but I've had good success with swain. In lane you want to run e w q e e r e w e max q max w and r when you can for abilities. Items are situational, but start dorans ring, then rush rod of ages. You can throw another dorans in there as the passive synergizes perfectly with yours.\n\nIn lane, he's all about mana management and predicting movement. You want to make sure you're never sitting at full mana for any length of time. Whenever you can, hit him with an e and an auto. The e hits hard for a targeted attack and the auto receives the damage boost. You get a huge power spike with r and catalyst which gives you the health and mana sustain you need.\n\nFor all ins, try and predict where they will be with your w, then follow with everything. If you need the slow to hit your w, feel free to use it. When you move towards them, they tend to move directly backwards away from you which gives you an idea of where to place your w. You can also throw your w down when they go to last hit. If you hit that, your sustain with your r and amplified damage will win any trade. If you miss it, back off and keep farming.\n\nDefensively, you want to save your q for all ins or disengages. It can devastate junglers coming for you or enemies as they try and escape. It's on a low CD as well, so use it early in an all in. You can also use it to last hit under tower as that is the toughest thing for swain to do. They shouldn't try and dive you under tower since that's suicide for them.\n\nA nice trick to use as swain is baiting an engage when you have catalyst and are about to level up. Since you do a lot of aoe, you can bait the engage and naturally level up during the trade when you kill a few minions with your ult/w. That gives you additional health and makes the trade even more lopsided.\n\nTL;DR - Pre 6, poke with e and an auto. Post 6, poke with e and an auto. Place w based on where they will be.

Vareide, born with the gift of being European\nChad, born with the curse of being madly obsessed with coffee cup related computer programs\nCayorion, born with the gift of power over land\nSterling, born with the gift of charisma\nAnd Pentaclam, who could never set foot on land, for it would fall beneath him\nAnd with the five children came five realms\nChad and Vareide became partners and lead the realm of MCSG\nCayorion lead the realm of Factions\nPentaclam lead the realm of Spleef\nSterling lead the realm of Mineplex\nAnd last, Aubron lead the realm of UltraHardCore\nWhile Graser10 made all of his children to be equal, he liked Sterling the most. He became attached to Mineplex, and babied it, leaving his other children to build their empires alone.\nThe realm of MCSG grew quickly, fueled by the great messenger, AntVenom. Droves of new players, formed from the sons and daughters of the children of Graser10 eagerly emigrated to MCSG. Chad and Vareide became the richest children.\nThe realm of Factions grew almost as quickly. However, after centuries of great popularity, copycat realms began to appear everywhere, and Factions became nothing but a slew of rambunctious city-states. Czar Cayorion's throne was usurped, and his famous name fell into obscurity.\nSpleef became wildly popular, though it did not remain one realm. The traditions of Pentaclam and the realm of spleef spread far and wide, people swept the ground out from under each other for sport, earning great reward upon victory. But, like Czar Cayorion of Factions, Pentaclam was forgotten, and he too tumbled into obscurity, never to be spoken of again.\nMineplex, backed by the great Graser10 himself, rose to ultimate power almost immediately. For King Sterling could afford the greatest nobles money could buy. Mineplex became a monarchy, and all members of the kingdom worshipped the great King. However, this was short lived. Enter the slick, keen, hip Captain Jordan Sparkles, a sailor who traveled through all of the realms. He finally landed at Mineplex, and his hipness mesmerized the citizens. Sterling was soon forgotten, and Captain Sparkles became the idol of Mineplex.\nAs for the last realm, it's growth has slown to a crabwalk. Aubron tried everything, he utilised the Reddit mountain range, started a great crusade called WMC, but nothing seemed to work. The realm of UltraHardCore was dark and quiet, for nobody wanted to come to a realm where there were no cures, no vaccines, not even natural healing. But then, a local miner named Mr. Boulderfist found a wondrous mineral! It flashed in the starlight, glimmered like a diamond. It had the color of a beautiful flower. A great Doctor who called himself the great Master of Power was fascinated by the new mineral. He studied the new \"gold\", and found something that he had never seen before. He discovered that this \"gold\" had similar properties to that of the famous \"full hunger syndrome\" that healed people of all other realms. MOP tested the gold out, fusing it with a regular Apple. What emerged was truly fantastic. An apple, laced in gold, that affected people's health...POSITIVELY! He immediately confronted Aubron, and the newly named Aureus Pupillam was distributed all around UltraHardCore! People heard of this, and tourism in UltraHardCore grew enormously!The realm of UltraHardCore thrived after that! The flow of tourism was enough for the natives to make an honest living, but not many had heard of UltraHardCore. It was a small realm, both in size and population. Sterling and his minions, Spu and Chiss, did their best to hide the fact that UltraHardCore existed from anybody who lived in Mineplex. By this time, Sterling, Chad, and Vareide had begun to suck tourism from the other realms, turning the realm of Spleef into a barren wasteland, visited by only the Nostalgic. Pentaclam had nowhere to go, so he accepted a job in MCSG. Factions shrunk significantly. But Sterling dared not deal with UltraHardCore, for he feared his citizens would leave him! Graser10 watched intently, and he was shocked to discover Sterling's treachery! So, he felt sympathy for Aubron. Graser10 created a man by the name of Dbz Fan. Dbz Fan descended upon UltraHardCore, and everyone loved him. His fame came to the point where everyone would say \"Dbz Fan Knows Best!\" He was their saviour! The tales of the great and mighty Dbz Fan were too great even for Sterling to hold at bay! People learned of his greatness, and new following flocked to UltraHardCore from the other realms. But then, a disciple of Dbz Fan said unto him, \"Every time I say Dbz Fan I end up short of breath! Would it not be more appropriate for you to go by the name \"Dibzcraft?\" And Dbz Fan loved his new name. He was known as Dibzcraft everywhere.\nHowever, as time went on, people began to find stories of the great Dibzcraft too unbelievable. The flow of people from the other realms came to a halt, and there was nothing even the great Dibzcraft could do to fix it. Andso the realm fell into a great depression. Crime was everywhere, the justice system was overwhelmed with cases. Great gangsters such as Awalk98, Slutty Cow, IplayCOD2, Cyiclo, TWhelan, and ProfessorRetro emerged. The Justice Commitee imprisoned them all, but they began to imprison the innocent by mistake, and people began to fear for their freedom. To make matters worse, Graser10 had stolen the great idea of the Golden Apple and given it to Mineplex, and the ruler of UltraHardCore, Aubron, had been assassinated by a gangster. The leaderless land needed a new ruler, a fair ruler. So, a well liked man by the name of Climbed started a campaign to run for Leader of the land. However, he had an opponent. Another more political man, Bergasms, had entered the race. The men were neck and neck in the race, people didn't know who to choose! But in the end, Climbed emerged victorious. There was a great celebration, and Climbed swore that he would fix the horrible depression. Despite his failure to be elected, Bergasms had enjoyed the competition thoroughly, and befriended Climbed. He grew to become Climbed's right hand man, and they worked together to create a safer UltraHardCore!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalso tommysx best pve x d x d LOL hahahahahahahaha dae thedogstarlp4committee?!?!?!??!!?/1/1/1/1 \n\n\naslo host me cutrclean now u haha xd nvm cutclean SUCKS IF U HOST IT U DONT LIKE GRASERN OKOKOKOKOK????\n\n\n\n\n\nI turn fucking green and rip my shirt off.

{"body": "Sorry for the delay.  Just got off work....\n\nFirst, I'll admit up front that \"Better\" has a lot of subjectivity built into it.\n\nNext, I'll point out that I'm not an expert in this area.  So I could be argued otherwise.\n\nOkay, there seems (to me) to be two different popular methods of translating the bible.  Either \"word for word\" or \"thought for thought\".  And different translations may mix these up.\n\nAlso, translators may, or might not, include their reasoning behind the word or thought that they used, and they might, or might not, quote the original word or sentence being interpreted.\n\nI've only used the NIV, the NKJV, the NASV, the Good News version, and of course the KJV.  So I don't have comprehensive experience.\n\nBut what I've found with the NET is that it is more translated thought for thought, and the translators have included more notes on their translation than any other bible I have, or have flipped through.  I find their translator notes to be fascinating, and they have taught me a lot more than I've learned from any of my past pastors, or from the Christian apologetics books that I read.\n\nThe translator notes seem honest to me.  And comprehensive!  For example, here's the translator's notes on the *pericope adulterae*:\n\n&gt; 1tc This entire section, 7:53-8:11, traditionally known as the pericope adulterae, is not contained in the earliest and best mss and was almost certainly not an original part of the Gospel of John. Among modern commentators and textual critics, it is a foregone conclusion that the section is not original but represents a later addition to the text of the Gospel. B. M. Metzger summarizes: “the evidence for the non-Johannine origin of the pericope of the adulteress is overwhelming” (TCGNT 187). External evidence is as follows. For the omission of 7:53-8:11: Ì66,75 א B L N T W Δ Θ Ψ 0141 0211 33 565 1241 1424* 2768 al. In addition codices A and C are defective in this part of John, but it appears that neither contained the pericope because careful measurement shows that there would not have been enough space on the missing pages to include the pericope 7:53-8:11 along with the rest of the text. Among the mss that include 7:53-8:11 are D Ï lat. In addition E S Λ 1424mg al include part or all of the passage with asterisks or obeli, 225 places the pericope after John 7:36, Ë1 places it after John 21:25, {115} after John 8:12, Ë13 after Luke 21:38, and the corrector of 1333 includes it after Luke 24:53. (For a more complete discussion of the locations where this “floating” text has ended up, as well as a minority opinion on the authenticity of the passage, see M. A. Robinson, “Preliminary Observations regarding the Pericope Adulterae Based upon Fresh Collations of nearly All Continuous-Text Manuscripts and All Lectionary Manuscripts containing the Passage,” Filologia Neotestamentaria 13 [2000]: 35-59, especially 41-42.) In evaluating this ms evidence, it should be remembered that in the Gospels A is considered to be of Byzantine texttype (unlike in the epistles and Revelation, where it is Alexandrian), as are E F G (mss with the same designation are of Western texttype in the epistles). This leaves D as the only major Western uncial witness in the Gospels for the inclusion. Therefore the evidence could be summarized by saying that almost all early mss of the Alexandrian texttype omit the pericope, while most mss of the Western and Byzantine texttype include it. But it must be remembered that “Western mss” here refers only to D, a single witness (as far as Greek mss are concerned). Thus it can be seen that practically all of the earliest and best mss extant omit the pericope; it is found only in mss of secondary importance. But before one can conclude that the passage was not originally part of the Gospel of John, internal evidence needs to be considered as well. Internal evidence in favor of the inclusion of 8:1-11 (7:53-8:11): (1) 7:53 fits in the context. If the “last great day of the feast” (7:37) refers to the conclusion of the Feast of Tabernacles, then the statement refers to the pilgrims and worshipers going home after living in “booths” for the week while visiting Jerusalem. (2) There may be an allusion to Isa 9:1-2 behind this text: John 8:12 is the point when Jesus describes himself as the Light of the world. But the section in question mentions that Jesus returned to the temple at “early dawn” (῎Ορθρου, Orqrou, in 8:2). This is the “dawning” of the Light of the world (8:12) mentioned by Isa 9:2. (3) Furthermore, note the relationship to what follows: Just prior to presenting Jesus’ statement that he is the Light of the world, John presents the reader with an example that shows Jesus as the light. Here the woman “came to the light” while her accusers shrank away into the shadows, because their deeds were evil (cf. 3:19-21). Internal evidence against the inclusion of 8:1-11 (7:53-8:11): (1) In reply to the claim that the introduction to the pericope, 7:53, fits the context, it should also be noted that the narrative reads well without the pericope, so that Jesus’ reply in 8:12 is directed against the charge of the Pharisees in 7:52 that no prophet comes from Galilee. (2) The assumption that the author “must” somehow work Isa 9:1-2 into the narrative is simply that – an assumption. The statement by the Pharisees in 7:52 about Jesus’ Galilean origins is allowed to stand without correction by the author, although one might have expected him to mention that Jesus was really born in Bethlehem. And 8:12 does directly mention Jesus’ claim to be the Light of the world. The author may well have presumed familiarity with Isa 9:1-2 on the part of his readers because of its widespread association with Jesus among early Christians. (3) The fact that the pericope deals with the light/darkness motif does not inherently strengthen its claim to authenticity, because the motif is so prominent in the Fourth Gospel that it may well have been the reason why someone felt that the pericope, circulating as an independent tradition, fit so well here. (4) In general the style of the pericope is not Johannine either in vocabulary or grammar (see D. B. Wallace, “Reconsidering ‘The Story of the Woman Taken in Adultery Reconsidered’,” NTS 39 [1993]: 290-96). According to R. E. Brown it is closer stylistically to Lukan material (John [AB], 1:336). Interestingly one important family of mss (Ë13) places the pericope after Luke 21:38. Conclusion: In the final analysis, the weight of evidence in this case must go with the external evidence. The earliest and best mss do not contain the pericope. It is true with regard to internal evidence that an attractive case can be made for inclusion, but this is by nature subjective (as evidenced by the fact that strong arguments can be given against such as well). In terms of internal factors like vocabulary and style, the pericope does not stand up very well. The question may be asked whether this incident, although not an original part of the Gospel of John, should be regarded as an authentic tradition about Jesus. It could well be that it is ancient and may indeed represent an unusual instance where such a tradition survived outside of the bounds of the canonical literature. However, even that needs to be nuanced (see B. D. Ehrman, “Jesus and the Adulteress,” NTS 34 [1988]: 24–44).\n&gt; sn Double brackets have been placed around this passage to indicate that most likely it was not part of the original text of the Gospel of John. In spite of this, the passage has an important role in the history of the transmission of the text, so it has been included in the translation.\n\nCan you see... they don't have a problem using Bart Ehrman for a reference!  Dr. Ehrman *is* a bible scholar, but his works are often shunned by Christians because they weaken (or destroy, in my opinion) a literal interpretation of the Bible.\n\nAll of this, plus it is free to give away, AND it has an awesome interface that lets you jump around in the Bible as easily as I can jump around in Wikipedia, and it is no wonder that I call it \"the best\" - even if it is my own opinion.\n\n[Here's a link to the online version of the NET bible](https://bible.org/netbible/).\n\n[Here's a link to the Kindle version \\(with notes, for $4.99\\)](http://www.amazon.com/Bible-First-notes-Biblical-Studies-ebook/dp/B002V1I4I6)\n\n[And if you want a free Kindle version, you can get it without notes](http://www.amazon.com/Bible-Noteless-Biblical-Studies-Press-ebook/dp/B0010XIA8K).

{"body": "We were thought the alphabets first, of course, and did the for 2 weeks. We were thought like we were 1st graders and we didn't mind, as hard as learning the language is. It's quite easy once you get the rhythm, literally. From then on, kanji would only be your problem. You have to study and read it constantly to be good at it. Even native Japanese people don't know every kanji word out there! But they do know the \"generally\" used ones, about 2000+ unique characters. \n\nFor the the alphabet, I'll try to explain how I memorized (\"cheat\") it. The phonetics of Hiragana and Katana is the same, the only difference is how to write it. In English, we have the vowels A E I O U. In Japanese, the order is different. Remember A I U E O. Write on top of a piece of paper A I U E O horizontally. On the left side, vertically, this: (below A) KA SA, TA NA HA, MA YA RA, WA N. Say it in your head multiple times until you know it by heart because that is basically the whole Hiragana/Katakana alphabet.

{"body": "The process jazz musicians typically go through when playing tunes is as such:\n**Call a Standard** - They usually have well known chord changes, a corresponding style, and key. You can be given a [lead sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_sheet) if you don't know the tune but can read sheet music.\n\n**Set a tempo** - give your band mates a few glances conveying something along the spectrum of \"Hey isn't this great, I really trust all of your musical abilities and let us all fall into this song and have some real fun\" to \"I swear to God if you motherfuckers fuck this up right now during this song I am gonna piss shit all over you.\" This sets the tempo. After which you...\n\n**Count off the tune** - which can be done many ways. You can count \"1, 2, 3, 4\", you can give the drummer some bars up front, You can improvise something over the changes of the final four bars of the tune, you can play a non-metered cadenza, you can orchestrate a complicated intro that you give to the band to sight read where the count off is the saxophonists' inhale. Be creative with your count offs! This is likely the first and only lasting impression of the piece you are about to play.\n\n**Play the head** - Based on how you feel, how memorable the original melody is, and how well you can sight read, you read the ink on the lead sheet at the previously set tempo. This is \"Playing the Head\". Many great improvised moments have happened playing the head, as mentioned in this sentence.\n\n**Play some solos!** - After you have played the head, you start playing solos. Solos are subjective, but many people have come to an agreement that most solos that are pleasant to listen to:\n\n* Pull from the melody as a guidance for improvising.\n* Have a story-like build and release.\n* Maintain the chord changes of the tune by outlining them within your solo. i.e. if the chord is Amin9, or A-9, or Am9, or even an A minor 9 chord, you should but thinking about how the note you have found yourself landed upon can get you to the notes A C E G &amp; B. Once that chord (likely) changes to a D7, or a D dominant 7th chord, you look to make your way to notes within THAT chord, so D F# A &amp; C. Many paths have already been etched within these two chords, find the ones that move you the most and try to recreate it. This is called cheating, stealing, and thievery. All of which must be reconciled with while learning jazz, so they are natural starting points.\n* (For rhythm section players) **MAINTAIN THE FUCKING FORM.** This means if its a 32-bar AABA \"rhythm changes\" (a common chord progression many melodies have been based around) in Bb (a common key) Then you better be playing something outlining:\n \n||:I-vi-|ii-V-|iii-vi-|ii-V-|v-I-|IV-viib5-|iii-vi-|ii-V-|I-vi-|ii-V-|iii-vi-|ii-V-|I-iii-|IV-V-|ii-V-|I---|III7---|----|VI7---|----|II7---|----|V7---|----|I-vi-|ii-V-|iii-vi-|ii-V-|I-iii-|IV-V-|ii-V-|I---:||\n\nOr if you are playing \"So What\" in D it would be:\n\n||:i7---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|bii7---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|i7---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----:|| \n\nDon't you dare lose the form while you reconcile your lack of total understanding and inability to maintain a true spiritual real world awareness through all times. Channel the nervous breakdown into your respective instrument.\n\n*For soloing instruments i.e. trumpet, sax, etc.*\nAfter you have finished your solo begins the true jazz test, how you **Project Yourself Experiencing Your Other Band Members Playing!** Just look to greats like Charlie Parker and Miles Davis if you are questioning the importance of this skill. Watch yourself listen to jazz in the mirror until you have perfected your desired projection. This skill is vital in tempo setting.\n\n**Rhythm section solos-** After all the instruments everyone actually wants to hear solo, we all throw the drummer and bassist a bone and let them indulge in musical hackery for hopefully no longer than a chorus apiece. After this we..\n\n**Play the head out** - This part doesn't matter, you lost everyone's attention during the bass solo.\n\nAnd that is how jazz musicians play tunes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415413321", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 62, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The notes are aligned like they are due to the fact that we use a chromatic keyboard. Chromatic entails all 12 notes, one after another going up in pitch. Somewhere around the 15th century, we decided to make the C major scale (the white keys) the scale pattern that is easiest to play on a keyboard instrument. \n\nBecause of this, we need 7 white keys and 5 black keys. Starting with C, it would go:\n\nC D E F G A B\n\nThis leaves off C#/Db, D#/Eb, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, and A#/Bb. These 5 notes take the place of the black keys on the piano. These notes are just as important as the white keys. They would look like this:\n\n \nC^C# D^D# E F^F# G^G# A^A# B\n\nIf you'll note, there is no sharp or flat note between E and F. This is due to using the C major scale, as Nine_Cats mentioned. While there is a note E#, that note sounds the same as F (likewise, Fb is E, pitch wise). If we were to add these notes as keys the keyboard would become incredibly cluttered (and why would you want multiple same pitched keys next to each other?). This would be why it looks like black keys are missing.\n\nVery good question. I wish I could say why we chose C major for the white keys, but if we were to do, say, A# major/Bb major as the key for the white keys the pattern would be the same. That is what Nine_Cats talks in his post (half steps and whole steps are another way to look at it, all 12 chromatic places next to each other would be HHHHHHHHHHHH. A scale is WWHWWWH, which visually looks very similar to a keyboard).\n\nedit, need to reformat... and got the date wrong", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415465920", "subreddit": "piano", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, so you probably know that a music staff has 5 lines, and that each line and every space between a line has a different note. Without any sharps or flats notated, every note would be what's called a \"natural\" note, i.e., A B C D E F or G; no sharps or flats. If you play it on a piano, you'd only be playing white keys. \n\nNow fortunately, all the white keys sound very nice together; it happens that they are all in the key of C (or A minor). But, there are still 5 other notes which can be used, so to notate them, we have to put a sharp(#) or flat(b) before them, indicating that the note that's on the same line as B, for example, is actually a Bb. This is called an accidental; a bit of a misleading name since it can be quite intentional.\n\nWhen you have an accidental, it lasts for the entire bar. So if you're writing in the key of C, but you decide you want to have someone playing a Bb for an entire bar, you only need to put the accidental once. If you want to go back to playing a B in that bar, you need to put the natural sign (♮) before it.\n\nMusic often has key signatures, which show up as a group of flats or sharps right after the clef. Say you're writing in D major (which has the notes D E F# G A B C#), you'd put two sharps to indicate this. Since you'll be using F# more often than F, the key signature indicates that every F will be an F# unless it's specifically notated as a natural.\n\ntl;dr: without accidentals, you can only notate 7 notes out of the 12 available in each octave.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415507911", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You know, even though all they're doing is rubber-stamping out Magento/Wordpress with custom CSS skins, but still, be prepared for it.\n\n6) You're going to have to work harder than anyone else to do what you want to do and it's going to be a total fucking cunt especially if you're having to target smaller businesses and especially if you don't live in a very densely populated area.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415536387", "subreddit": "web_design", "score": 22, "controversiality": 0}

All major scales are constructed with this same pattern, but C is the only one that you don't need a sharp or flat on.  \n\nAn easier way to think about it is on a piano, you can play the c major scale by just playing the white keys sequentially, starting at c.

{"body": "I don't quite agree with the other people here, so I'm going to talk less about theory and more about history.\n\nWe derive our scales from ancient Greek music, but the Greeks didn't have scales, they had modes. Imagine your C major scale. It goes C D E F G A B C right? Well, a mode is essentially just a scale that starts on a different note in the same key. So the Dorian mode goes D E F G A B C D. This is followed by the Phrigian, Lydian, Mixolydian, and Aeolian (minor) modes. It is believed that these modes were named for the places that they were most common in.\n\nWhy were modes the standard instead of scales? Well, for a very long time, instruments were made to play in only one key. Even pianos were made with all white keys and tuned to the key that they were meant to be played. \n\nNow, you probably already know that every fret on a guitar represents a half-step. That's how western tonal music works. After the initial invention of modes and scales, it was found that, between octaves, there are only 11 half steps. Well, the pattern of notes that were being played were already named and established, so they took that C major scale (and all the modes associated with it) and found the fitting half steps to be between the E and F, and the B and C. So rather than changing the entire system for a new discovery, they made due with what they already had.\n\nThat's why there's no standard E#, Fb, B#, or Cb.\n\nNow, if you get into the science behind this stuff, B# and C are completely different notes, (actually, every differently named note is a completely different note) but modern instruments are made to kind of compromise, so that what we hear is \"close enough\" to perfect tuning.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415553599", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "ANY beast of the appropriate size category is rules legal, in 5th edition. 3rd had restrictions on going too big or too small that fell away as you leveled, but 5th says nah, that's too complicated. The only restrictions are the beast's CHALLENGE rating. Since a flea would have a Challenge rating of 0 (0 xp), it's both perfectly allowed by rules and also very good playing as its smart thinking. You WANT your players to play smartly.\n\nHere's the relevant rules for wild shaping, from pages 66-67 btw (sorry about the god-awful formatting that copy pasting does):\n&gt;Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to\nmagically assume the shape o f a beast that you have\nseen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain\nexpended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can\ntransform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At\n2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast\nthat has a challenge rating o f 1/4 or lower that doesn’t\nhave a flying or swimming speed.\nBe a s t S h a p e s\nLevel Max. CR Limitations Example\n2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf\n4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile\n8th 1 — Giant eagle\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number o f hours\nequal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then\nrevert to your normal form unless you expend another\nuse o f this feature. You can revert to your normal\nform earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You\nautomatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to\n0 hit points, or die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of\nthe beast, but you retain your alignment, personality,\nand Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You\nalso retain all o f your skill and saving throw proficiencies,\nin addition to gaining those o f the creature. If\nthe creature has the same proficiency as you and the\nbonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the\ncreature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has\nany legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n• When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit\npoints and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal\nform, you return to the number o f hit points you had\nbefore you transformed. However, if you revert as a\nresult o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage\ncarries over to your normal form. For example, if you\ntake 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit\npoint left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as\nthe excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form\nto 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\n• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or\ntake any action that requires hands is limited to the\ncapabilities o f your beast form. Transforming doesn’t\nbreak your concentration on a spell you’ve already\ncast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that\nare part o f a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve\nalready cast.\n• You retain the benefit o f any features from your class,\nrace, or other source and can use them if the new\nform is physically capable o f doing so. However, you\ncan’t use any o f your special senses, such as darkvision,\nunless your new form also has that sense.\n• You choose whether your equipment falls to the\nground in your space, merges into your new form, or\nis w orn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,\nbut the DM decides whether it is practical for the new\nform to wear a piece o f equipment, based on the creature’s\nshape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change\nsize or shape to match the new\nform, and any equipment that\nthe new form can’t w ear\nmust either fall to the\nground or merge with it.\nEquipment that merges\nwith the form has no\neffect until you leave\nthe form.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415581370", "subreddit": "DnD", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I'll try to articulate this but I don't have it fully formulated in my head yet:\n\nNolan's recent films going back to TDK, seem to suffer from what I will term \"Idea-Bloat.\" He seems to bite off more than he can chew in terms of narrative, characters, and themes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing at all, BUT concomitant with the Idea-Bloat is a tendency for Nolan to cut corners with characterization and plot.\n\n[I totally agree with your assessment of Interstellar as a BIG movie. Contra other moviegoers, I appreciate a director swinging for the fences and will be much more forgiving of a film's weaknesses in light of the sheer audacity of the director.]\n\nSo some of the criticisms I enumerated may be small in and of themselves but together they add up to weak storytelling. \n\nYou seem more willing to connect dots that I believe are Nolan's responsibility to connect (we can agree to disagree) but your response to some of my criticisms is for you to s t r e t c h on Nolan's behalf. \n\nFor example, if you are going to depict a palpable tension between Coop's adult children, I should know from whence that tension comes because the storyteller put it in the story. You seem perfectly willing to suss that out for the storyteller, hence your theory that they had different world views, etc. etc. but you are really just kinda guessing...\n\nAnd I am NOT a dumb lazy moviegoer that needs things explained. (Although I will say Nolan often has characters give TONS of exposition in ungainly ways...) It's the opposite of Chekov's storytelling axiom that if you mention there is a rifle on the wall, it better go off later in the story. In Nolan's case, the rifle goes off at some point, but he skipped mentioning that it was on the wall in the first place. This is just as problematic from a storytelling standpoint as mentioning the rifle and it never goes off.\n\nSo Nolan needs there to be tension between Murph and her brother and her sister in law to ratchet up the dramatic intensity of Murph figuring out that the \"ghost\" was her father but that familial strife is never explained or earned, it just shows up.\n\nNitpicky? Maybe, but that sort of thing happens all through his movies lately.\n\nAnd here is an even bigger example of that that is in no way nit picky because it is the climax of the entire movie: PLEASE explain how Nolan made it perfectly believable that adult Murph would realize that when she was a little girl, the books were being knocked off her shelf by her father from another dimension in the future. (Let that sink in a second.)\n\nHow does Murph arrive at that conclusion? How the hell would any human being come to that conclusion? I get that Nolan NEEDS her to figure that out, but once you get past how \"cool\" that is, if you think about it for even two seconds, there is no way (especially a way that is earned narratively) she would come to that conclusion. None. For me, that is weak storytelling and Interstellar is rife with that sort of thing.\n\n(Also, I asked my son about the use of the camera angle on the left side of the ship. He said, \"The one Nolan used a million times?\" But I'll reserve judgement until I get to see it again but I'm tellin' ya he used that same shot A LOT!)\n\n[[Hard for me to believe you didn't notice the bombastic score :) ]]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415581441", "subreddit": "movies", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hmm I'm liking all your ideas. As for the vowels, the only reason there are so many is in order to follow the chart of semi-radicals. How about we introduce the idea of tone? Rather than have ten vowels, have the set /ä i ɯ~u e o~ɔ [ə]ŋ/, written &lt;a i u e o [è]ng&gt;, but have /ä i e/ and /o/ have two possible tones. /u/ and /[ə]ŋ/ are always low tone. The tones will be written low: &lt;a e i o u èng&gt; and high &lt;á é í ó&gt;. This is based simply on what we have now - I additionally propose adding two rows to the chart in order to give /u/ and /[ə]ŋ/ an extra tone option each. This brings the vowel catalog down to size *and* makes it more Asian. As for aspirating consonants, doubling the unvoiced version is fine (so &lt;k p t&gt; become &lt;kk pp tt&gt;) - that's actually what's done [I believe] in certain Korean romanization schemes.\n\nAs for a palatal nasal, you calling it \"not exactly the smoothest final nasal\" gave me an idea. What if, at one point in the language's development, it *did* have one, but it became a dental over time, hence its isolated position. \n\nAs for representing /ɕ tɕ dʑ/, I am completely in agreement. I was thinking &lt;š č ž&gt; myself, though ž in my mind implies /ʑ/ without the stop. \n\nI agree. I propose a rule that only unvoiced and unaspirated stops (k t p) can come at the end of a syllable, and these are automatically pronounced as unreleased.

{"body": "The mala is a useful tool.\n\nIt's used for the recitation of mantra, which have associated meanings, and function like a prayer which can bring about positive states of mind and feeling, and lessen negative ones.\n\nThe mantra is anchored in a meaning, for instance \"Om Mani Padme Hum\", has the meanings of \"Om\", \"Mani = Jewel\", \"Padme=Lotus\" and \"Hum\".\n\n\"Om\", is made of 3 syllables, \"AH\", \"Oh\" and \"Ma\", which are symbolic of the three different bodies, the mind body, consistent of heart-mind, the speech body, and the action body.\n\nThe \"Mani\", the jewel, held at the heart of Chenrezig, is symbollic of Bodhicitta, the Awakening heart, Compassion, love and kindness for beings, selflessly and abiding in equanimity.\n\n\"Padme\", the lotus which arises from the mud, is symbollic of the stainless nature of enlightenment, beautiful, the understanding of emptiness, impermanence, interdependence, causation, karma, motivation.\n\n\"Hum\" seals it in the mind, the pure nature of buddha-mind which each being possesses. It invokes the grounded, pure and clear, clean nature of the mind, like when the sediment in a pond settles, and it is just still water.\n\nSo every recitation of \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" should serve to unite compassion and wisdom, transform our impure body, speech and mind, and set us a purely motivated buddha-nature.\n\nIf we recite \"Om Mani Padme Hum\" with no meaning, we might as well say \"A B C D E F G\", for that has 6 syllables also. or \"I A E O U and sometimes Y\".\n\nIn fact one mantra \"OM A RA PA TSA NA DHI\", are the first 7 syllables of the ghandarian alphabet, but somehow that is translated to the ultimate wisdom of Majushri, or of Yamantaka.\n\nSo the mala's main purpose is for reciting mantra, and anchor in enlightened heart-mind and those qualities, free from negative mental states, afflictive emotions-kleshas, self-centeredness, attachment, hatred and greedy desire.\n\nThe method is just counting. In the tibetan tradition you say it by counting each bead, pulling it toward yourself, generally with your middle finger and your thumb, and you recite each one, contemplating it's meaning, ultil you get back to the guru bead.\n\nIn the Tibetan tradition you stop at the guru bead and do not cross it, instead turning the mala around and counting it again. Sometimes there are counters to keep tracks of how many 1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s, 10,000s, 100,000s, 1,000,000s of times you've counted.\n\nGenerally you wear it on your left wrist, why? I'm not so sure. Much like why I'm not really so sure about why 108, or intervals of 27, or 7, and the like. People have all kinds of explanations.\n\nYour mala should be treated as a sacred object. Generally simple. Monks will wear ones made of wood, with a simple tassle, and not much ornamentation. You do not want to grasp and cling to your mala. It is impermanent, selfless, interdependent. There is nothing to grasp to.\n\nThat being said some monks also have malas of amber, or gemstones, or other things as well, because they carry different connotations.\n\nI'm wearing a rose-quartz mala, not because of some crystal mumbo jumbo, but because it's light pink color, with little spacers of red, remind me of a compassionate, clear and pure, gentle love and compassion, kindness and empathy and care, punctuated with strong feelings of genuine loving-kindness and metta for beings.\n\nI have a simple wood mala given to me by my teacher with a simple tassle, and it reminds me of the love and kindness of my teacher, it reminds me to practice, and of monkly - discipline.\n\nI have a metal mala a yogi gave to me, which is ornamented with silver vajra and bell, and a sharp silver purba, with frighteningly bright red string, which reminds me of the yoga, the energy, the will, the courage, the strength, we sometimes need in our practice.\n\nAnd so I use them interchangeably. I feel on most days I need to work on being loving and disciplined. That I focus to much, and grasp to trying to be wise or knowledgeable, or powerful.\n\nBut my dog died recently, and my grandpa is dying. So sometimes I need that Vajrapani like will to be the foundation of strength that is needed for my mourning family. So that they can fall apart and have me there with diamond-strong care for them to hold them up.\n\nFor a first time mala, simpler is better, develop a relationship with it, develop a relationship with mantra. Use it like the tool it is.\n\nAt the end of the day, you don't need a mala, the Buddha didn't use a mala.\n\nYou could join your hands and say \"May I be loving today to those who need it.\", genuinely and heartfelt, and this would mean more than tens of millions of empty mantras.\n\nIf you use a mala, use it correctly. Treat it with respect. Do not take pride in it, do not grasp to it. Use it for the diminishing of negative qualities, and the development of positive ones.\n\nUse it to be the person you need to be for the sake of others, and for the sake of yourself.\n\nI hope this was some help, sorry for being so long winded.\n\nOm Muni Muni Mahamuni Shakyamuniye Soha\n\nOm Mani Padme Hum\n\nOm Wagi Swari Mum\n\nOm Vajra Pani Hum\n\nOm Vajrasattva Hum\n\nOm Ah Hum\n\nGate Gate Paragate Parasamgate Bodhi Soha", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1415642667", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "score": 37, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Think of this.  One Million years from now humans invent a tool that they look through and it displays flat slides of spacetime fabric as 3D images for every moment that has ever existed (like us looking through a view master http://childhoodrelived.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/view-master.jpg) of all of time.  They look through these images to see where they came from.  Who created their species.\n\nAs they look through the flatten slides of all time they realize they can affect them with gravity.  Over time they realize they actually had a hand in creating themselves in a way.  They see that the human species almost died but an advanced species helped save them by using gravity to manipulate spacetime to create a wormhole to a solar system where their planet exists and that they got to the planet they are on via that wormhole.  But there's more.  While viewing through time they also see that humans couldn't figure out how to manipulate gravity in a way that would allow them to leave Earth in mass.  They conclude there is a paradox that exists.  They couldn't exist unless humans knew how to manipulate gravity, humans don't know how to manipulate gravity, somehow humans must learn how to manipulate gravity or they couldn't exist.  This is where Cooper comes in.  They see that if they set up the variables needed Cooper does the rest and resolves the paradox. They guide NASA via gravitational anomalies and Cooper realizes he is guiding himself.\n\nNow lets say the humans of our conceptualized future did't invent a machine, but just over a million years we evolved to a point that we just understand and perceive spacetime in the same way that we currently understand 3 dimensions of L x W x H.  We can touch the 4th and 5th Dimensions, see them, flip through them like a books pages and utilize gravity to alter them.  We can flip ahead or back.  There is no present except for what the observer flipping the pages is experiencing that moment with endless observers viewing from other times viewing him/her.\n\nSo instead of people inventing something they just over a long period of time begin to perceive the spacetime dimension.

They are fundamentally the same, with the third interval varying depending on which chord you play. Let's break it down further:\n\nCmaj chord: I - III - V\n\n* The first degree, the I, is the root note. This is the note that determines which chord is being played.\n\n* The third degree, the III, is the mediant. This is one of the notes that determines the tonal quality of a chord (whether it is major or minor).\n\n* The fifth degree, the V, is the dominant. This note is the same in both the major and minor versions of the scale. It just \"strengthens\" the root note.\n\nCmin chord: I - iii - V\n\n* This chord has the same first and fifth intervals, but lowers the third interval a half-step (E ---&gt; Eb). This one change is enough to make the chord sound \"sad\" in nature.\n \n \n\n---  \n\n**7 CHORDS**\n\nChord | Intervals | Notes\n---|---|----\nMajor7 | I-III-V-VII | C-E-G-B\nMinor7 | I-iii-V-vii | C-Eb-G-Bb\nDominant7 | I-III-V-vii | C-E-G-Bb\n\n       Cmaj7    \n        e -------------------------8------------------------\n        B -------------------------8------------------------\n        G -------------------------9-----------------------\n        D -------------------------9------------------------\n        A -------------------------10------------------------\n        E -------------------------8------------------------\n\n       Cmin7    \n        e -------------------------8------------------------\n        B -------------------------8------------------------\n        G -------------------------8-----------------------\n        D -------------------------8------------------------\n        A -------------------------10------------------------\n        E -------------------------8------------------------\n\n       C7    \n        e -------------------------8------------------------\n        B -------------------------8------------------------\n        G -------------------------9-----------------------\n        D -------------------------8------------------------\n        A -------------------------10------------------------\n        E -------------------------8------------------------\n\nThe seven chords are flavorful and very useful in blues and jazz contexts. Because they contain 4 distinct notes instead of 3, they have a touch more flavor to them. If you take a standard progression, Am - C - G - F, and transform it into seven chords, Am7 - Cmaj7 - Gmaj7 - Fmaj7, it will sound \"jazzed up\". These are important to learn.\n\nCmaj7 chord: I - III - V - VII\n\n* The first three intervals have already been explained above. \n\n* The VII (major seventh), the note that makes this a separate chord, is very important. Take a look at the \nCmaj and Cmin scales above: three notes change when going from major to minor: the third interval, the sixth interval and the seventh interval. Here, you're adding the MAJOR seventh, so it's a MAJOR 7 chord.\n\nCmin7 chord: I - iii - V - vii\n\n* The idea here is similar. You changed the MAJOR third to a MINOR third, and added the MINOR seventh. It's a Cmin7.\n\nC7 chord: I-III-V-vii\n\n* This one is a little different. It's minor AND major in tonality. Seems sort of conflicting, doesn't it? There's a specific reason that it possesses extra tonality, and I'd be glad to go into that if asked.

AFAIK he doesn't kill you, but he disables your flashlight which allows Foxy to kill you instead. He's also super annoying and the one you hear saying, \"hi!\" and giggling on night 2 onward.\n\nFor the Marionette - if you hear \"pop goes the weasel\" start playing, it's already too late and you're prob gonna die.\n\nFoxy 2.0 appears in MANY different camera views just hanging from the ceiling, etc. It can also appear with other animatronics, particularly Chica and will attack from a vent or the main hallway.\n\nBonnie 1.0 will just auto-kill you if he reaches the office. The mask won't fool him unless you wear it while he's outside.\n\nThere's also a couple more things hinting to the security guards or phone guy being criminals/murderers and that's what sets the animatronics off. Firstly is that sometimes between nights you will briefly be placed into the old freddy fazbear restaurant/stage next to Bonnie and Chica who will grow increasingly suspicious of you as Freddy and turn to face you:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/tMhBdJS5_iE?t=7m27s\n\nThere's also this death minigame that plays if you are caught by Freddy 2.0 while wearing the Freddy Mask:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/9dtmbgNtTAc\n\nWhile you are playing as Freddy a robotic voice spells out \"S A V E T H E M\" as you chase the marionette to a blood present.\n\nThere's also the call for the start of night 3 where the phone guy talks about mysterious happenings outside the pizzeria that you shouldn't concern yourself with. It seems very subtly hinted that there may be another murder spree happening in the area around the pizzeria, but that's just my inference. Here's the dialogue:\n\n\n\"Oh hey and before I go, I wanted to ease your mind about any rumors you might have heard lately. Ah, too many local stories come and go and seldom mean anything. I can personally assure you that whatever is going on out there, however tragic it may be, has nothing to do with our establishment.

You could ignore them and just focus on the chord tones, for example, or you could harmonize them with passing tones of your own inside your melody.

And of course the stove is covered with bacon grease, which is invisible to him. That's what we're dealing with at our house. :)\n\nBut I wouldn't categorically have a problem with him cooking steak in the middle of the night.

So you sit in your house all the time cause ypu can't go out.

C minor is C D E^b F G A^b B^b (the ^b indicating a flat) - so the third, sixth, and seventh notes are lowered. This changes the sound of the scale, and to our Western music-accustomed ears, this makes it sound \"sad.\" In other musical traditions - Indian, Chinese, what have you - other models are more common. In Semitic music, for example, Phrygian (don't worry about this word, for now it's just a name) mode is more common, and to them, it sounds \"happy,\" despite Phrygian mode sounding \"sad\" to people used to Western music.\n\n[This](http://youtu.be/Nz0b4STz1lo?t=4m17s) part of The Planets suite by Holst is mostly major.

Immediately (within a half second) I do H C C C C to queue my villagers. Then I immediately build a house with one, chop wood with the other two while waiting for my sheep to come under my TC, and simultaneously plant several flag marks for my scout to explore so he can do so without me being forced to manually watch him. \n\nThis whole process takes under 20 seconds and it's just one example. You need to always know where your next villager is going and what his job is. You can't just half ass it and expect to see results. Study the experts, watch recorded games, and write down their villager orders and their build order etc. For example villagers 1-6 on sheep, 7-10 on wood, 11 builds a mill while loom is loading, then lures boar, 12 on berries, 13-14 on boar (lure 2nd boar), 15-16 on gold, 16-18 wood, hit feudal, etc. I made some of those sequences up but you get the point.\n\n Then practice vs. the computer and once you hit castle quit and restart etc, constantly striving to improve your time. I've gotten a 14:40 castle with knights using the Mongols by trying dozens of different methods and finally figured out which worked best.\n\nAlso, especially on maps like Arabia, use your houses and buildings as walls. Wall your base off ASAP so you don't get flushed or raided with knights from a fast castle. Always explore in circles with your scout so your line of sight looks like a circle that keeps expanding.

{"body": "[This is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6urYCQk_Xw) by slahser (6k mmr or something) on a slightly different playstyle for huskar.\n\nHere's my take on it, though:\n\nHuskar is a great hero, with his near-immunity to magic damage and ridiculous attack speed at low HP. His DoT from Burning Spears is insane, and his dunk is great against high HP enemies. However, he is very easily counterable. Do not pick Huskar when the enemy has 2 or more counters.\nThese counters include:\n\n* Disable-heavy lineups, especially BKB piercers (Bane, Beastmaster, Doom etc)\n\n* ANY pure damage nuke (Bane again, Omniknight, OD, Lina with aghs)\n\n* Physical burst damage (Dazzle, Slardar, etc)\n\n**Skill Build:** You almost always want to max Burning Spears first and Berserker's Blood second, taking the ult at 6. But you don't want to level your ult again at 11, since it only offers an increased slow duration. Instead, max Inner Vitality, and max the ult after.\n\nIt should look like this: W E W E W R W E E Q Q Q Q R stats R.\n\n**Early game:** You'll want to be in a lane you can farm safely, so go either safelane or mid. Then use your orb to win lane hard. Manually casting Burning spears lets you attack the enemy without drawing creep aggro, and the DoT will make most enemies afraid to come near you. But don't ignore last hitting - getting your own farm is just as important as denying farm to your enemy. I usually go brown boots into armlet, but you can get phase boots first. Either way, Armlet is your first major purchase. If you're snowballing and your team doesn't have one, an Urn is an option, but usually you can stay healthy between ganks with your Q and your lifesteal. Early game is when you're strongest, after getting level 8 or 9. So make sure you're active during this time. Gank the enemy carries to keep their farm behind, and get kills on their supports when you can. Most squishy supports will die from 4 or 5 burning spears once it's maxed.\n\n**Mid game:** Your options open up a bit at this point. You'll want to strike a balance between ganking, farming, and pushing. And once you have armlet, the only other core item you need is Helm of the Dominator. For your next item decide between Haleberd, BKB, and Satanic, depending on whether you need a disable, spell immunity, or more durability. Aghs is also an option if you need the extra ult damage and mobility in fights (since it reduces cooldown to 4.) With good armlet toggling, you can also SOLO ROSH by level 11 or so. Don't forget to do so if you get the opportunity. Check the slahser video if you want to see how to do it.\n\n**Late Game** Hopefully you've more or less won by this point since Huskar isn't the best late game carry. But you'll definitely want to have your helm upgraded to Satanic by now. Make sure you don't go in first in teamfights. Huskar is very durable, but having the entire team's focus is a great way to die. Use your ult as a secondary initiaton or counter initiaton. Play like a carry, not like a Clockwerk or Tidehunter.

{"body": "Once upon a time, Walmart was not such a bad place.  The shelves were full of things you’d want to buy.  The floors were clean, bright and shiny.  The people were mostly happy and normal.  Slowly the stores degenerated until they reminded me of pictures of stores in the former Soviet Union.  Long lines of dour faces, limited items on the shelf, and you just new that everyone was getting screwed.\n\nBut it’s the little things that tell the story best.  I can venture into almost any other store in town and someone greets me in a friendly fashion.  Smiles on faces and a pep in the step.  Friendly banter among the employees can be overheard.  Not so in Walmart.  The visible employees shuffle about like zombies on some nameless mission.  A somber faced person pushes a broom on a floor that will never be clean.  A stock person pushes things around on a shelf that will never be full.   Serious faced manager types with radios and clip boards scurry frantically about trying to find The Thing That Is Lost.  And the cashiers: bink, shuffle, bink, shuffle, bink, shuffle.  Do they hear that all night when they sleep?  Their eyes are glazed, their faces slack; no fear upon them for they have seen Despair and lived.\n\nThe store near me did a major upgrade and remodeling.  New shiny floors that look like polished dinginess.  How do you do that?  How do you make dingy and depressing shine?  But it does.  It’s bright and shiny and dingy.  Highly polished dirty.  Someone must have spent time and effort to achieve such dystopia.   \n\nThe pharmacy, all spiffied up a few weeks ago, looks like a well dress woman with an ornate hair do after a long day chasing toddlers in a breezy park.  Everything still works. . .  but small pieces are missing, the new counter is a bit . . . uneven.  The corner moulding isn’t on all of the corners anymore.  And like a twitching eye indicates a person on his last nerve, a long fluorescent light flickers above the not so tidy and fresh line that separates the customers from their prescriptions. \n\nThe quality of the merchandise has greatly diminished.  Once, I would buy Wrangler jeans or perhaps Faded Glory jeans for work.  Back in those days, the purchase would last a year of weekly washing before the holes would appear.  Now, however. . .  The belt loops go first.  They come out of the dryer no longer attached to the pants.  Then the pockets shred on the inside so that they really aren’t pockets anymore.  And the back pockets, where the wallet goes, comes up with holes that let the color of the undies show through.  What once lasted a year goes in a third the time.  Funny that denim purchased from Costco doesn’t do that. \n\nOnce upon a time, I would shop a Walmart and get everything I needed for my family for the week.  Now, half the things on my rather mundane list aren’t on the shelves, or are in some odd “Great Value” brand that really isn’t quite as good as the name brand and only a few pennies cheaper.  \n\nSomething odd I noted as I pushed my new, non-rattling, dull-grey cart towards the line at the single checkout lane - here they restrict the self service lines to 10 items or less - which makes the line at the single open register all the more demoralizing.  Shutting me out of the self service isle was the last straw.  If I have to stand in line at the cigarette isle when Wheezy Wilkins tries to get the deaf cashier to get him the Marforofgh foddies lyts for the fifth time and then tries to pay for it with his barely legal “girlfirend’s” SNAP card, I’ll kill myself.  There is very little worse than watching some zombie shuffle though another million items only to be thwarted by the dreaded incompetent customer trying to pay with government assistance, cash, and fifteen dollars in coins and thirty five pages worth of coupons plus every newspaper in the county (price match!).  But I digress.  The manager of the store and the district manager (they had name tags!) were in the building dressed in black, three piece suits - the kind that remind me of an undertaker or an old southern Baptist preacher at a funeral.  All the employees shuffle around like the dead, the dying, or the doomed, so I thought it was very fitting that the management was dressing the part.  The whole experience though, was a bit odd.\n\nThe clearest sign of. . . well I really don’t know what, is an attractive red headed cashier who was trying her damnedest to remain human in the land of the zombies.  Her hair had been well groomed when she arrived, but now, hours into her shift, the pins and berets were fighting the good fight, but losing.  Her make up was once just right, but now, looked worn and faded.  Upon her blue and Walmart Yellow smock was attached a spider pen that screamed:  “I am a person!  I have a personality!  I give a shit!”  And though she smiled and it did reach the top of her face, the lights above quickly sucked the joy from her face and it was a bit insane to watch her smile and then the smile fade and the she smiled and it faded, and again, and again.  As I watched her deftly and automatically bink-shuffle her way through the four items I was buying, I wondered:  How does it come to this?    She seems a nice girl with a pretty face and appealing curves.  Does her employment here speak of some dark secret or crime or some hidden defect?  I pondered the injustice at the very notion that such a hell is made by humans for humans and then I noticed this upon her smock:  A name tag anonymous for its similarity to all the millions worn by Walmart employees, but now solely hers.  Her name stuck to the generic Walmart employee badge by letters pulled off a sticky letters page undoubtedly sold in the crafts department, was spelled K E L L   and off to the side, in lower case, in a different font was the y.  \n\nIt’s the little things.  The floor is polished, but looks dingy.  The merchandise is what ever cheap crap squeaked by QA.  The newest and best is dull and grey, and the remodeling lasts as long as a 21st birthday bash.  It’s her name, fucked up by Walmart, and on display for all the public to see.  Why?  What does it say to you when your employer won’t even bother to get your name right?\n\nThat’s why I shop at Walmart as little as possible.", "gilded": 1, "created_utc": "1415850070", "subreddit": "news", "score": 172, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here was my theory on the whole thing, and some copy pasta from the OP.\n\nSo I think many have established that FNAF2 is a PREQUEL to the first game:\n\n1. Phone guy is still alive.\n\n2. Why are there old animatronics in FNAF2? There were 3 restaurants. The first one before the first game and the second game. This one was home to the classic animatronics. After that place shut down it was rebuilt into the 2nd games Freddy Fazbears Pizza. Sno the withered ones from the first pizza place in stayed in the parts room in Freddy's Fazebears Pizza FAFN2.\n\n3. You received a check dated 1987 on the 5th night of FANF2, and got paid even less. This would obviously be inflation taking effect in FANF1 as you were paid more. \n\n4.The check in the second game has the date of 11-12-87 on it. The first game mentions the “bite of ‘87” and the second game makes no mention of the bite of ‘87, so the bite must have happened during or after the events of the second game.\n\n5.The calls mention the name of the old DINER (not pizzeria) called something like Fazbear’s Family Diner.\n\n6.A call mentions that someone has stolen a golden Freddy outfit. Also, the cops are beginning an investigation by night 4/5.\n\n7. NO DOORS. Why would they take the doors away when reopening? They didn't. The doors were an added addition for your protection in FNAF1 AFTER the incident in FNAF2.\n\n8. The FNAF1 restaurant is incredibly tight on money. Hence the cutting of the power and in my opinion less pristine building. Most likely due to lawsuits and owing money to families from the incidents.\n\nMy theory:\n\n --The source of the killings mentioned in FNAF1 was an employee  who lured and kill children in FNAF2--\n\n In FNAF1, if you looked closely or zoomed in on some of the camera views of the hallways, you could see articles on the walls talking about missing children from the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant. One states:\n\n'While the suspect has been charged, the bodies themselves were never found.'\n\nand \n\n'Two local children were reportedly lured into a back room during the late hours of operation at Freddy Fazbear's pizza on the night of june 26th. While the video surveillance identified the man responsible and led to his capture the following morning, the children themselves were never found and are presumed dead.'\n\nAnd this next one talked about the biting of '87:\n\n'After a long struggle to stay in business after the tragedy that struck there many years ago, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza has announced that it will close by year's end'\n\nThe statements mentioned here are happening during the nights of FNAF2 if you listen carefully to Phone Guy and what he says. I believe on the third night Phone Guy tells you to 'not believe the rumors' etc. My theory is that Phone Guy was getting flak and being accused because his restaurant was missing children (who we now know were murdered). \n\n'The bite of 87 took place after the 6th night. Jeremy, the nightwatchman you play, is told he'll be working the day shift and that that day is a birthday. Jeremy Fitzgerald is also the name of a real life stunt man who had an accident occur during a scene and smashed the front of his skull into a wall, similar to how the bite occurred to someone's frontal lobe.' -Anonymous correction (thanks!)\n\nWho was bitten? YOU I suppose.  I think it's safe to assume that an employee had his head bitten off.\n\n --the murderer was an employee, and the animatronics knew it--\n\nThroughout FNAF2, when you are killed and lose, you often see a minigame. One entails you controlling Freddy, and feeding the children with cake while a child sits behind the building crying and unable to get in. As this passes a car rolls up and a mysterious man gets out and murders the kid. In another minigame, you are foxy, funning out and playing with the children in a party, over and over. Finally, you do it once more and you arrive to the children and they are dead.\n\nIn yet another, you are controlling the marionette doll and 'giving life' to dead children by giving them presents and then putting animatronic heads one them.\n\nIn all of the minigames you repeatedly hear \" S A V E T H EM \" spelled out. ALL the minigames include the murder of children and the theme of saving them from this mysterious man. The animatronics (including the marionette) have a sense of protection toward the children\n\nThe marionette has powers to 'give life' and I believe that the marionette is taking the souls of the murdered children and having them control the animatronics as an attempt of revenge against the murderer and adults in general. \n\nPhone Guy even says one night that the animatronics just... stare at adults... but they're fine with children. \n--ON THE 5TH NIGHT THE RESTUARANT IS ON POLICE LOCKDOWN--\n\n﻿During the Phone Guy message, he states that the restaurant in on lockdown. But interestingly enough he says, 'we may move you to the day shift, I believe that it became (pause) avaliable...' Phone Guy even states he's going to contact the previous owner to find names (for the police).\n\nSomebody was on day shift, and all of a sudden amongst all the police activity he's gone.\n\nI think this could only mean one thing, and that's whoever was on day shift was arrested on suspicion of murder! I believe this to be the murderer who the lured kids as previously mentioned.\n\nThe source of the killings in my opinion HAS TO BE an employee possibly wearing the golden Freddy suit to lure and kill children. I wont say WHO because I just don't know. . The marionette took the souls of the murdered children and 'gave them life' by putting them in control of the animatronics, and the animatronics then took revenge on the murderer. It only makes sense the animatronics would attack other adults too, as they are children murdered by an adult.\n\nEDIT: So I realize that saying the man who got his frontal lobe bitten off is the murderer, is saying basically saying Jeremy Fitzgerald (you) would be the murderer. Some like that theory, some don't. We do know it was Jeremy Fitzgerald that got his lobe bitten on day 6, and I believe the murderer (one of them atleast) was arrested the day before.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415867145", "subreddit": "fivenightsatfreddys", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Even Ronald's death was used to facilitate the story, and we'd only had that one episode to let him grow on us.\n\n&gt;Sarah was significant to Sam, though. The whole point of her character in S1, is she was one of the first (female) characters to stand up to the bad things happening to her and refused to sit back and let the boys risk their lives for her.\n\nExcept the bad things weren't happening to her. They were happening to people she knew or cared about. She wasn't in danger, in fact they likely used Evelyn's death to motivate *her*. But that doesn't support your narrative, so let's ignore her friend that died to the ghost.\n\n&gt;God, she was the first love interest who didn't exist solely to be a love interest. They could've continued that theme they established by letting her live or overcome Crowley's suffocating her. It was a cheap way to garner sympathy and make Crowley look scary, by using a known fan favourite whose ENITRE POINT was that she survived where so many didn't. Like I said, context is everything.\n\n\nThey didn't use it to garner sympathy or make Crowley scary. They used *all the deaths in that episode* in order to give them a purpose to confront Crowley. Otherwise it would have been a continuous circle of looking for him, like they had with Azazel. All of the deaths in that episode were a means to that end, including Tommy's.\n\nHell, we can use a similar male character and use your attempts at metaphor on him.\n\nVictor Henriksen, the first enemy turned ally of the series. He expressed complete skepticism towards Sam and Dean. But he was won over by the proof and took a stand to correct the mistakes he'd made. He was developed so much in that episode and was even comforted by Dean in saying that none of his chasing was his fault. He went through an existential crisis while still helping to fend of demons and keep the officers at the station from dying needlessly(like all the other *male* officers). And in the end he could have been left alive, it seemed like he would be; he was all set up to move on with his life. But they had to bring Lilith in to kill him.\n\n\n&gt;You can take your pseudo-intellectualism and shove it, **the show is sexist**, way too many people involved in the show agree with me, I provided in-show and out of show examples, that all contribute to the overall toxic atmosphere Supernatural has created for itself over ten years. C O N T E X T.\n\nBolded so you know what your issue is. **If you think the show is sexist then say that it's sexist.**\n\nRather than saying:\n\n&gt;&gt;Supernatural use the act of killing female characters to further the plot for the male characters\n\nSay something along the lines of:\n\n&gt;&gt;Supernatural's sexism(or misogyny if you'd prefer)\n\nYou're making a point where you have none and attempting to stretch it for an entirely alternate conclusion from your initial point.\n\n*If you can't understand that, I am done with this conversation.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415867868", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here's my opinion, from a Carnatic perspective. The short answer: Ar/Av are only indicative, and their ability to successfully represent a raga varies from moderate to low. It is not necessary for a raga to have a Ar/Av.\n\nThe long answer: One thing to remember is that Aroha/Avaroha (Aarohanam/Avarohanam in Carnatic) is an attempt to concisely capture the essence of a raga. The operational words being 'concise' and 'essence'--which are mutually contradictory objectives.\n\nAll attempts to create Ar/Av are therefore doomed to be reductionist. In the best case, the raga is simple enough to be thus captured. For instance, Hamsadhwani, has Ar/Av of 's r g p n s/s n p g r s'. There doesn't appear to be any other raga which uses these notes, and the raga doesn't have too many 'vakras' or crooked progressions, and so the Ar/Av is sufficient to capture the essence.\n\nBut representing more complex ragas in an Ar/Av becomes rapidly more complex, and what is usually done is to capture the 2-3 salient movements of the raga in the Ar/Av. This leaves out many of the lesser 'pakad's of the raga, but is still helpful for identification of the raga.\n\nIn a few cases, the Ar/Av *does* capture the raga fully, even though there are other ragas using the same notes. For instance, Kadana-kutuhalam is a raga with an Ar of 's r m d n g p s' and Av of 's n d p m g r s', and this is enough to identify the raga fully because of the peculiar progression (this raga has been created by Muthuswamy Dikshitar, allegedly from  chords of a British military band).\n\nOn the other hand, people have given up even trying to create an Ar/Av for ragas such as 'Sindhubhairavi' which uses 10 of the 12 positions of the chromatic scale, and it would be enormously difficult to squeeze these into a single Ar/Av.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415887070", "subreddit": "icm", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If you do \neverything right you are going to be king of the world, either in your \nown world or in the real world. Please read the disclaimer at the end of \nthis text.\n\nNow, let's get to action!\n\nThe basic formula for cocaine starts by purchasing or making tropinine, \nconverting the tropinone into 2-carbomethoxytropinone (also known as \nmethyl-tropan-3-one-2-carboxylate), reducing this to ecgonine, \nand changing that to cocaine. \n\n  Succindialdehyde. This can be purchased, too. 23.2 g of succinaldoxime \npowder in 410 ml of 1 N sulfuric acid and add dropwise with stirring at \n0* a solution of 27.6 g of sodium nitrite in 250 ml of water over \n3 hours. After the addition, stir and let the mixture rise to room temp \nfor about 2 hours, taking care not to let outside air into the reaction. \nStir in 5 g of Ba carbonate and filter. Extract the filtrate with ether \nand dry, evaporate in vacuo to get the succindialdehyde. This was t\naken from JOC, 22, 1390 (1957). To make succinaldoxime, see JOC, 21, \n644 (1956).\n\n  Complete Synthesis of Succindialdehyde. JACS, 68, 1608 (1946). In a 2 liter \n3 necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition \nfunnel, is mixed 1 liter of ethanol, 67 g of freshly distilled pyrrole, and \n141 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Heat to reflux until dissolved, add \n106 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in small portions as fast as reaction \nwill allow. Reflux for 24 hours and filter the mixture. Evaporate the \nfiltrate to dryness under vacuo. Take up the residue in the minimum amount \nof boiling water, decolorize with carbon, filter and allow to recrystallize \nin refrigerator. Filter to get product and concentrate to get additional \ncrop. Yield of succinaldoxime powder is a little over 40 g, mp is 171-172*.\n\n  5.8 g of the above powder is placed in a beaker of 250 ml capacity and \n54 ml of 10% sulfuric acid is added. Cool to 0* and add in small portions \nof 7 g of sodium nitrite (if you add the nitrite too fast, nitrogen dioxide \nfumes will evolve). After the dioxime is completely dissolved, allow the \nsolution to warm to 20* and effervescence to go to completion. Neutralize \nthe yellow solution to litmus by adding small portions of barium carbonate. \nFilter off the barium sulfate that precipitates. The filtrate is 90% pure \nsuccindialdehyde and is not purified further for the reaction to create \ntropinone. Do this procedure 3 more times to get the proper amount for the \nnext step, or multiply the amounts given by four and proceed as described \nabove.\n\n  Take the total amount of succinaldehyde (obtained from 4 of the above \nsyntheses combined) and without further treatment or purification (this had \nbetter be 15.5 g of succindialdehyde) put into an Erlenmeyer flask of \n4-5 liters capacity. Add 21.6 g of methylamine hydrochloride, 46.7 g of \nacetonedicarboxylic acid, and enough water to make a total volume of 2 \nliters. Adjust the pH to 8-10 by slowly adding a saturated solution of \ndisodium phosphate. The condensate of this reaction (allow to set for \nabout 6 days) is extracted with ether, the ethereal solution is dried \nover sodium sulphate and distilled, the product coming over at 113* at \n25 mm of pressure is collected. Upon cooling, 14 g of tropinone \ncrystallizes in the pure state.\n\n  2-Carbomethoxytropinone. A mixture of 1.35 g of sodium methoxide \n(this is sodium in a minimum amount of methanol), 3.5 g of tropinone, \n4 ml of dimethylcarbonate and 10 ml of toluene is refluxed for 30 min. \nCool to 0* and add 15 ml of water that contains 2.5 g of ammonium chloride. \nExtract the solution after shaking with with four 50 ml portions of \nchloroform, dry, evaporate the chloroform in vacuo. Dissolve the oil \nresidue in 100 ml of ether, wash twice with a mixture of 6 ml of \nsaturated potassium carbonate and three ml of 3 N KOH. Dry and evaporate \nin vacuo to recover the unreacted tropinone. Take up the oil in a solution \nof aqueous ammonium chloride and extract with chloroform, dry, and evaporate \nin vacuo to get an oil. The oil is dissolved in hot acetone, cool, and \nscratch inside of flask with glass rod to precipitate \n2-carbomethoxytropinone. Recrystallize 16 g of this product in 30 ml of hot \nmethyl acetate and add 4 ml of cold water and 4 ml of acetone. Put in \nfreezer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Filter and wash the precipitate with cold \nmethyl acetate to get pure product.\n\n  Methylecgonine. 0.4 mole of tropinone is suspended in 80 ml of ethanol \nin a Parr hydrogenation flask (or something that can take 100 psi and not \nreact with the reaction, like stainless steel or glass). 10 g of Raney \nNickle is added with good agitation (stirring or shaking) followed by \n2-3 ml of 20% NaOH solution. Seal vessel, introduce 50 psi of hydrogen \natmosphere (after flushing vessel with hydrogen) and heat to 40-50*. \nAfter no more uptake of hydrogen (pressure gauge will hold steady after \ndropping to its lowest point) bleed off pressure and filter the nickle off, \nrinse out bottle with chloroform and use this rinse to rinse off the nickle \nwhile still on the filter paper. Make the filtrate basic with KOH after \ncooling to 10*. Extract with chloroform dry, and evaporate the chloroform \nin vacuo to get an oil. Mix the oil plus any precipitate with an equal \nvolume of dry ether and filter. Add more dry ether to the filtrate until \nno more precipitate forms, filter and add to the rest of the precipetate. \nRecrystallize from isopropanol to get pure methylecgonine. Test for activity. \nIf active, skip down to the step for cocaine. If not active, proceed as \nfollows. Stir with activated carbon for 30 min, filter, evaporate in vacuo, \ndissolve the brown liquid in methanol, and neutralize with 10% HCl acid in \ndry ether. Evaporate the ether until the two layers disappear, and allow to \nstand for 2 hours at 0* to precipitate the title product. There are many \nways to reduce 2-carbomethoxytropinone to methylecgonine. I chose to design \na Raney Nickle reduction because it is cheap and not as suspicious as LAH \nand it is much easier than zinc or sodium amalgams.\n\n  Cocaine. 4.15 g of methylecgonine and 5.7 g of benzoic anhydride in 150 ml \nof dry benzene are gently refluxed for 4 hours taking precaution against \nH20 (the 2 should be on a lower level) in the air (drying tube). Cool in an \nice bath, acidify carefully with hydrochloric acid, dry, and evaporate in a \nvacuum to get a red oil which is treated with a little portion of isopropanol \nto precipitate cocaine.\n\n  As you can see, this is quite a chore. The coca leaves give ecgonine, which \nas you can see, is only a jump away from cocaine. If you can get egconine, \nthen dissolve 8 1/2 g of it in 100 ml of ethanol and pass (bubble) dry HC1 \ngas through this solution for 30 min. Let cool to room temp and let stand \nfor another 1 1/2 hours. Gently reflux for 30 min and evaporate in vacuo. \nBasify the residue oil with NaOH and filter to get 8.4 g of methylecgonine, \nwhich is converted to cocaine as in the cocain step above.\n\n  Below is given a somewhat easier method of producing tropinone by the \ngeneral methods of Willstatter, who was instrumental in the first synthetic \nproduction of cocaine and several other alkaloids. After reviewing this \nmethod, I found it to be simpler than the above in many respects.\n\n  Tropinone. 10 g of pyrrolidinediethyl diacetate are heated with 10 g of \ncymene and 2 g of sodium powder, the reaction taking place at about 160*. \nDuring the reaction (which is complete in about 10 min) the temp should not \nexceed 172*. The resulting reaction product in dissolved in water, then \nsaturated with potassium carbonate, and the oil, which separates, is boiled \nwith dilute sulfuric acid. 2.9 g of tropinone picrate forms and is filtered.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415893301", "subreddit": "DarkNetMarkets", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A lot of what makes chords in this genre (and really any genre) sound really cool are **suspensions/additions.**\n\nLook at the chord progression in the drop of Alesso's \"Silenced By the Night\" remix.\n\nThe chords are as follows (I will use Roman numeral chord notation, as is common practice, if you don't know it yet, learn it). \n\nIV vi V V I vii IV IV. Each chord lasts for four beats.\n\nI don't know what key this song is in off the top of my head, but for the purpose of this it doesn't really matter, lets just say its C major. \n\nThat means that the IV chord is F major, the vi chord is A minor, the V chord is G major and the vii chord is B diminished. \n\nA typical F major chord is spelled: F A C\n\nA minor: A C E\n\nG major: G B D\n\nB diminished: B D F \n\nSuspensions are when you change one of the notes in the chord, typically changing the 3rd or the 7th to something else. \n\nFor example, a cool **suspension** of an F major chord (being used as a IV chord in C major) would be changing the A to a G. So instead of F A C, you now have F G C. This gives the chord a different sound, and sounds good in a higher register. \n\nAn example of an **addition** is adding another note to a chord to make it sound different. \n\nAn example of this could be a G major chord (being used as a V in C major). A typical G major chord is G B D, but you can add other notes for more flavor. Try adding the 9, in this case its the note A, but play it above the other 3 notes, spelled out in order: G B D A. Don't use the A immediately after the G, use the one in the next octave. \n\nTaking these ideas, add or suspend notes in the chords you use in your songs. If you just keep using the same plain 3 note chords, of course it will sound plain. \n\nThis is something you really need to practice on your own, I would highly recommend doing it on a piano and being able to name and spell each chord you play. \n\nI will list some different chords you could try for the drop of this Alesso remix instead of the plain three note ones, and spell them. \n\nPlay these chords with the left most note being the lowest pitch, and ascending upward in order.\n\nIV - F major sus 2 - F C F G C\n\nvi - A minor sus 4 - A E A D E \n\nV - G major add 4 - G D G B C G\n\nV - (repeat from before, or try switching the C out for a D for this measure)\n\nI - C major add 9 - C G C D G \n\nvii - B diminished add 6 - B G B D F G \n\nIV - Repeat from before, experiment with changing some of the notes.\n\nIV - Repeat from before, experiment with changing some of the notes. \n\nI hope this helps.\n\nPS thanks for the gold. Please ask me about music theory if you have any questions, I see a lot of misinformation or things not explained the way they should be around here and I'm happy to help.

{"body": "Adding a \"bass\" note would more commonly be considered a different voicing of a chord. It is only an addition if the note you are adding does not already exist in the chord. \n\nIf you have C E G and you want to add another C an octave down, that's just a differently voiced chord of the same type. Not an addition. Does that make sense?\n\nReally, the lowest note matters, but so does every other note. It's hard to say that any note is more important than another except for the root, but the root does not have to be the lowest note in the chord. \n\nThe more important thing to focus on here is the chord itself, what type of chord is it and how are you voicing it? There are many ways to voice even a simple C major chord.\n\nA C major chord is a C major chord no matter how you order the notes.\n\nRoot: C E G\n\n1st inversion: E G C\n\n2nd inversion: G C E\n\nAlthough the lowest pitch is changing, it is still a C chord by spelling. In EDM you will not often run across deliberate and obvious 1st or 2nd inversions often but it does happen. \n\nThe best advice I can give is to tell you to sit down at the piano and write out some chord progressions. Simple stuff just like the Alesso drop will do just fine. \n\nTake any 8 bar progression like this: \n\niii IV vi V I V IV IV\n\nTry playing it with just normal three note chords in different keys until you find one you like, or just pick one. Then once you have a key you like, figure out what chords you want to use. Do you want to use additions and/or substitions? Big ass power chords? Obviously you can do whatever you want, **BUT:**\n\nDO take the time to deliberately decide a specific voicing for each and every chord in your song. Don't just decide you want a D minor chord and leave it at that. Play around on the piano or loop your synth in your DAW and move/add/subtract notes until you have exactly the chord and chord VOICING that you want. \n\nChord voicings make a world of difference. \n\nTake a Cmaj7 chord (basically a C major chord with the 7 on top, B).\n\nC E G B. Play it. Sounds pretty standard, no? \n\nC G C E G B. A bit more powerful with that lower C G fifth in it. Awesome. Still a Cmaj7 chord, just voiced differently -- in this case, more voices. \n\nG B C E G (the 2nd inversion of a Cmaj7 chord, the 5 is the lowest note). Here, the B and the C being so close together makes a cool dissonance. The root note, C, is not the lowest note. It can still be considered a Cmaj7 chord. \n\nYou could even try something whacked out (but still just a Cmaj7 chord with a different voicing) like:\n\nB G B E G B C. Sounds crazy, but it still can technically be considered a Cmaj 7 chord. Or a 2nd inversion E minor chord with an added flat 6 (the C). \n\nThe same spellings of notes can be viewed differently, and form a different chord. \n\nFor example, \n\nC E G would most always be seen as a C major chord. \n\nBut, given the proper musical context (in this case, something in e minor) C E G could also be considered a second inversion E minor chord where the B has been suspended up to a C.\n\nYou won't just learn how chords work over night, you really have to sit down and practice working with them and KNOWING them, and appreciating all applicable contexts the chords could exist in. Then pick out your favorites and get a record deal or something. \n\nI kinda got way off track here and went on a tangent. \n\nTo answer your question more concisely: The root note is more important, but it does not have to be the lowest note. Learn about chord construction, chord inversions and the concept of \"spelling\" chords. A chord can have many different voicings. \n\n**The voicing of a chord, the timbre of the instrument(s) playing it and the musical context it is placed in are what makes the chords interesting, not just the chord type.**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415907419", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

I'm going to think about these {n/d} things more. \n\nI still can't see what's wrong with my tiling of the plane with {8/3} star polygons; I sketched something like this: \n\nFirst, the shape is \n    \n     1 4 \n    \n    6 7 \n    \n    3 2 \n    \n     8 5 \n\nwhere I join the numbers as ordered; then I represent this shape by cross\n\n    X\n    XXX\n    X\n\nNow I am going to line up lots of these things: \n\n    \n    X O X O X O X O \n    XXXOOOXXXOOOXXXOOOXXXOOO\n    XR OS XR OS XR OS XR OS \n    RRRSSSRRRSSSRRRSSSRRRSSS\n    RX SO RX SO RX SO RX S\n    XXXOOOXXXOOOXXXOOOXXXOOO\n    X O X O X O X O \n\n(I hope that is clear, I have coloured these with \"X\", \"O\" \"R\", \"S\", so you can distinguish them.) \n\nThere are nearly no edges that meet in this arrangement, but there are the edges where crosses of one row meet crosses of the next row. (so these are all vertical, eg, in the third row, they look like X|R O|S X|R O|S X|R O|S X|R O|S ) (Also every line you think ought to be covered is covered once, apart from the above, and apart from the places that look like: RRR:SSS:RRR:SSS:RRR:SSS:RRR:SSS (: means the vertical line there is missing) \n\nThen you draw the same thing again, and superimpose it, putting the central sqaure of each tile of the second copy of the above over the square holes left in the above diagram.  (and so the : of one pattern fall where the | of the other are, so everything works out.) \n\nTo me it looks like this is a three fold covering of the plane by {8/3} gons, with 5 meeting at some verteces, and 2 meeting at some others.  Is there something wrong with this tiling, or did Coxeters proof only apply when all the vertices are the same degree?  \n\nHelena \n\n*****\n\n Oh; I just realised I am making edges meet up where they are not supposed to probably. Whoopse! But is it interesting to ask about doing this, ie, viewing each section of an edge as a separate edge? ie, saying that where an edge crosses  another edge, that divides the edge up (even though strictly speaking it is just one edge, if you say an edge is something between the vertices of the original polygon (octagon in this case) Or does it just become a triviality if you're allowed to do this? \n\nHelena \n\n*****\n\n On Fri, 12 Dec 1997, Helena Verrill wrote: \n\n&gt; Oh; I just realised I am making edges meet up where they are not supposed to probably.

You can certainly draw some nice repeating patterns of octagrams, but to form a \"tiling\" they should meet in twos along each edge, the way tiles do in ordinary (non-starry) tilings. Now you can certainly start to make a tiling {8/3,8} like this, by putting 8 octagrams around each vertex. But if you continue, always putting 8 octagrams around each new vertex, you'll find that it just goes on getting denser and denser, and ultimately each point gets covered infinitely many times. A drawing of it would be very black! \n\nThis is what happens in the plane for every starry possibility, unfortunately. If you like, you can count these infinitely dense tilings {a/b,c/d}, which exist whenever b/a + d/c = 1/2; but I don't find them very pleasing. \n\nI think that what you did was just find a few of the octagrams in {8/3,8}, by not continuing across some of the edges. This is a bit like tiling part of a floor with hexagons in the {6,3} manner, but leaving some places untiled. \n\nThere ARE interesting starry tilings using regular polygons of different orders. For instance, there's one that has two octagrams {8/3} and one square {4} at each vertex. The thing you're describing sounds pretty much like that, too. In fact maybe the untiled places were just the squares of that tiling - in which case you should go back to the tileshop, buy some square tiles, and plop them in! \n\nJohn Conway \n\n*****\n\n I haven't yet followed your long message about the supposed starry tiling made up of octagrams {8/3}, but let me write a quick answer \n\nWell, maybe don't try making too much sense of what I wrote before; I realise there were some other mistakes too :(, and now all I can come up with are infinite tilings, just like you say. Seems pretty obvious this is going to happen, I guess, in this case, from root(2) being  incomensurable with 1; I'm afraid my previous message conveniently forgot  this (maybe someone who doesn't believve in root(2) can come up with a  finite tiling.) The only way I can get to fix the tiling is to add in  squares, like you say. oh well. \n\nHelena \n\n*****\n\n Supposing I wanted to do tilings with all the same starry tile, and to get it to work (as a finite cover) I distorted it, (like  I did by mistake); what happens? Looking again, I think that with  the particular \"bad\" tiles I used before, I get a 6:1 covering.  Suppose I take successive convergents to root(2), and use them to draw  a thing that gets closer and closer to a regular {8/3}; then I should be able to get tilings of the plane that are sucessively more dense; is there any sense in which I can claim these converge to the  infinite tiling with the regular {8/3}? Is this worth bothering to try? Is it a waste of time? What is the best way to think of these things? I'm having quite a bit of trouble drawing them; have to think quite carefully about what's going on (though actually, I think there is an easy way to describe the tilings with these irregular {8/3} things.) Generally, how do you think of tilings by star polygons? (suppose I make them all regular, but I'm allowed more than one kind) \n\nHelena \n\n*****\n\n Hi! \n\nOne way to think of your tilings is in terms of a riemann surface or a many-sheeted cover of the plane. Imagine that the centers of the {8/3} tiles don't all coincide on the plane, but are separated vertically. At each vertex of a tile is a sort of spiral ramp made up of it and its adjacent tiles. \n\nThe problem with this way of thinking is that eventually the top of the spiral has to glue to the bottom, which is physically impossible. It's hard to build models or draw pictures of, too. However, it makes it a bit easier to picture the \"infinitely many\" {8/3}-gons if they're not all trying to ocupy the same space. \n\nGood luck! \n\nHeidi B. \n\n*****\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1415957609", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 71, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**B L A C K I E - Imagine Yourself In A Free Natural World**\n\nOne of my favorite releases from this year. Not sure if it fits the bill for free jazz, even though it definitely is free jazz instrumentally.\n\nB L A C K Ì E is a rapper/producer from Houston, who's made a name for himself creating music in a similar vein to Death Grips, albeit much more abrasive, with harsher vocals, and more distorted and disjointed instrumentals. His latest release from earlier this year, Imagine Yourself In A Free Natural World, takes a very different turn from his otherwise, almost hip-hop based works. This record is made up of three tracks, in which B L A C K I E is screaming his lungs out on top of wild, chaotic, and unreasonable instrumentals that could consist of anything between a trumpet and a flute since you can't really tell over all the distortion and mayhem.\n\nAgain, not sure if it fits the bill incredibly well, but I had to nominate it anyways.

{"body": ":D\n\nTo be fair, I'm just submitting my first paid tweak, so I'm not exactly known for my consistent updates... yet.\n\nAnother thing I found interesting was while most of the time, people in this sub blame kids for making the sub worse, all three of the devs you mentioned are kids. /u/benr783 is 12, and /u/Codyd51 and I are juniors. I think a potential reason for that is that we (or at least I) don't really care about making a lot of money. As a kid, I have lots of free time on the weekends and breaks, and I choose to develop tweaks because I think it's fun. So much so that sometimes I feel like working on a tweak instead of hanging with my friends, which is probably not good lol. But whether or not I'm making money, I want to make this stuff. I just feel that if a tweak takes a lot of work, I should get some compensation for it. But if I couldn't submit a paid tweak, I would put just as much time and effort into it as a free tweak because I enjoy it. When people do it more for the money than for the fun is when DRM gets nasty, support/updates are lacking, and updates are paid. This community is not the place to start a profession as a developer, but it's a lot of fun (personally, I love showing my friends \"Look what I did\" *shakes phone and it starts snowing* \"it's a snowglobe!\" and I am especially proud of my new tweak Reddit Screens since it's mostly my own work, not a variation of another project).\n\nSo in a sense, it's kind of backwards. Here, kids can make great devs. Obviously, that doesn't mean adults *can't*. I mean, look at G R A T E G O D S /u/rpetrich and /u/saurik, and other small, active, and awesome adult developers like /u/cpdigitaldarkroom.

{"body": "Seventh chords. Take the same concept in that 5th video (I ii iii IV V vi vii°) and add one more note.

Because of this, if you have a chord that is followed by another chord whose root is a fifth lower, you can turn that first chord into a dominant 7 chord. For example, let's say you have the chord progression Em - Am - D7 - G. You can replace the Em and Am with E7 and A7 because they are resolving down a fifth.\n\nAlso, diatonic theory doesn't really apply for the Blues.

{"body": "alright just gonna drop a bunch of ET tips and hopefully they hit the money on your end.\n\nmy ET inspiration is iceiceice. he goes for a W E W E W E W E Q Q R Q Q R stats R build, maxing spirit first, followed by natural order, 2 levels of stomp, then ult at 11. i will sometimes deviate from this and get 1 point in stomp earlier if happen to have a skill point and i'm in a situation where i need it. i really believe that ET is one of the offlaners who should stay in their lane until 10-15 minutes and until they get their levels, especially if they are doing a good job of contesting the safe laner's farm. this is even more important when mimicking iceiceice, who goes for brown boots, soul ring, midas, tranquils as the core he gets from lane. he often gets the midas around 14 minutes, i find this isn't too unattainable and really shines through nowadays with all the long games.\n\nas for farming that midas on time and efficiently, here's something i almost never see done: farming the wave one creep at a time with spirit. too often people will just cast the spirit on all the creeps when one or two are low, but this is a waste. it's much better to cast the spirit so that it is only touching the creep you're trying to last hit, and then walking it onto the other creeps as they become low enough to last hit. sometimes you can get every creep in the wave if you're lucky. this is less effective if your goal is to hit all 3 enemy heros with your spirit and then whack people, so you can pick and choose your tactic.\n\nalright some assorted stuff, lvl 2 stomp will give you enough time to cast your ult in most situations as long as your dumb team doesn't wake them up. once you get lvl 3 and 4, if you hit the sleep it should be quite easy to land a good ult. i like to get a euls, it increases your move speed (tranquils + euls + spirit buff = fast hero + spirit) and you can euls, spirit then sleep and almost always get someone. it allows you to catch people overextending and really punish them with the long sleep.\n\nsome advice for hitting good stomps later in the game: don't treat spirit and stomp like they're the same spell. a lot of ETs will throw the spirit where they want to stomp, and will chain them together immediately, hoping that the spirits sudden appearance will give them enough time to get the sleep off. think about the spirit though, what is the most jarring part of it? it's the initial pass through your hero, causing damage and noise. that's when people are most likely to react and walk away from it. if the enemies are pushing my base, i find MUCH better success by casting spirit, walking it through a few heros, putting it somewhere important and letting it stand there, the enemies think i forgot about it and then suddenly i start stomping. or even better, walk it a bit further away than where you're going to want to cast, and then as it starts to return to you with its special animation you cast the sleep. people really never expect that.\n\nalright i think i covered most of the important stuff. ET is a really amazing and underrated hero who can offer a ton of control to a team, and his natural order armor can allow you to make short work of plenty of otherwise-invincible heroes. super funny against void in particular since you can stomp in the middle of his chrono and hit pretty much the entire thing. good luck to you!\n\noh, and as for your specific question about microing the spirit and stomp, i am 99% sure that you can cast stomp from either your hero or your spirit, so no need to click and change who you have selected. the way i control it is i have 1 as my hero, 2 as my spirit, and maybe 3 as both but i rarely use that if it's the case. so my normal \"cast spirit, move spirit, stomp\" micro looks like this:\n\nw, 2 (to select spirit, if i remember right it doesn't do this automatically), right click movement path, press q when stomping. speaking of spirit movement paths, make sure to hit those neutral creep camps for extra damage (and gold if you hit em enough without them getting pulled) or to walk your spirit down the lane into the next camp coming. you can really surprise your enemies with how hard you hit if you get a big spirit buff.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416073857", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Instead of focusing on the chords, work out the melody on your synth or piano and memorise what notes are what in the acapella melody. From there work out what key it's in, and from the key you can find out what chords to try. If one note is A in your melody, look for chords that have an A in them to play underneath as a basic starting point \n\n\nFor example say our melody is an A note sustained for 2 bars and then a G and F for one bar each totalling 4 bars. From these we can work out chords that sound good under the notes by using the note the vocalist is vocalising as a starting point. Whether the key is major or minor will affect which chords sound good and which chords we use. C major and C minor will have different chords because the 3rd and 7th notes are flattened by a semi tone in the minor scale \n\n\nSo the notes in our melody are A, G and F. With the note A we can try A major/minor (**A**C#E**/A**CE) or F major (F**A**C) or D major/minor (DF#**A**/DF**A**) and so on. These are good options for trying chords to go with our melody. \n\n\nSo let's say from our melody of A, G and F and the original background chords we work out our melody and it's original chord progression  is in C major. The notes in C major are C D E F G A B C (if we know the notes of the key or the formula you use to work out the notes of a major or minor key we can figure out what chords to try much quicker instead of playing by ear) \n\n\nFrom this we can work out our melody uses the 6th, 5th and 4th notes of our scale/key. The chords in C major go C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major/dominant, A minor and B minor/diminished (C Dm Em F G Am Bdim). I like to use numbers when thinking about music, so no matter what key I'm working in it won't be C D E F G A B C or F G A Bb C D E F or whatever in my head, it will always be I II IV V VI VII VIII or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, so in the context of our melody C is 1, D minor is 2, A minor is 6 and so on \n\n\nWe can visualise it easier like this:\n\n\nI   ii   iii    IV  V  vi  vii\n\n\nC Dm Em  F  G  Am  Bdim\n\n\n(capitals represent major, lower case minor)\n\n\n\nSo by using numerals and memorising the forumula to construct major scales/keys (tone tone semitone tone tone tone semitone) and how to construct major chords (1st, 3rd and 5th notes of the respective scale, simply flatten the 3rd by a semitone to make it the minor chord) we can visualise it all much easier and there's no need to memorise all sorts of different keys and chords because you have a system which converts every key to an easily understandable model \n\n\nSo from the chords you provided, starting on G as the \"home\" chord, ending on D and having an Em immediately suggests the song is in G major. This is because G (I) is the first chord, and D (V) is the last chord and is dominant, which resolves a lot of tension and sounds good when going back to the starting chord of G. Em would logically be the 6th note/chord of the G major scale. We know this because we know the G major scale consists of Gmajor, Aminor, Bminor, Cmajor, Dmajor/dominant, Eminor and F#diminished.... or G A B C D E F# G. If we use numerals, your chords are converted easily to V iii Vi V (capitals represent major, lower case minor)\n\n\nStraight away we have a selection of basic chords to try which we know will work with the notes in our melody because we can work everything out quick and have memorised scales and chords and the formulas for constructing each and we understand how they all work together\n\n\nIf there's 4 bars in the key of C major and our melody goes A (2 bars) G (one bar) and F (one bar), we can use a chord progression that goes F major (F**A**C) [1 bar], A minor (**A**CE) [1 bar], E minor (E**G**B) [1 bar] and D minor (D**F**A) [1 bar] because all those chords have the notes in our melody as they are sung.\n\n\nSo the melody is supported because the chord contains it along with other 2 different notes which add harmony and texture. If I have a chord progression of C major, F major and G major, I might use the middle notes of those chords for my melody (E, A and B) to add diversity and thicken out the harmonic content \n\nIn your chords you have G (GBD) Cadd9 (CEGD) E minor (EGB) and D major (DF#A) so those are notes you can start at, and the chords you can try are G major, A minor (ACE), B minor (BDF#), E minor (EGB) and if\nyou work out the notes in your melody you can work out which chords will sound good at which parts \n\nThe chords for your track if it's in G major are\n\nG major (GBD), A minor (ACE), B minor (BDF#), C major (CEG), D major (DF#A), E minor (EGB) and F# diminished (F#AC) \n\nso give them a go! \n\n\nIf you know your theory and have memorised how to construct scales and chords, we can know straight away whether a chord should be minor or major and go from there, but if you trust your ears you can figure out what works without much theory, and once you can find a chord progression that works you can build on it and make it more interesting with 7ths or other extensions and tweaks \n\n\nSo my advice is to work out the melody along with the chord progression, and using that work out what key it's in. Once you know what key it's in you can write down all the chords in the key and the notes that are used to construct them, and from there you can work out interesting chord progressions that work great with the existing melody but are totally different to the original progression or backing track in rhythm, melody or harmony. I'd also recommend studying theory and training your ear to recognise intervals and chord progressions so you can work out how to harmonise and find chords that work quickly and easily \n\nedit: yeesh I knew this sub had a phobia of theory but at least I'm trying to help your game here.

{"body": "Ember is by far my favorite and one of my best heroes in the game.   http://www.dotabuff.com/players/111816306\n\nMy tips in no particularly ordered matter:  \n\n1.  Run up with flameguard on against almost any mid.  If they try to fight you your autos + flameguard will outdamage almost any hero.  Getting a stout can help with tanking creeps if they get a better block.\n\n2.  Keep your ult at level 1 until level 24 and 25.  I recently started doing this and I like it much more.  A pretty typical build would look something like this E Q E Q E R E Q W W W W Q Stats....24/25 getting ult.  Of course my build differs on the games.\n\n2.  You don't need drums.  People say ember is a hero that \"needs drums.\"  Bullshit.  Don't play stupid.  Your biggest issue is with fast CC and silence, and high physical/true damage.  If they don't have any of those you are practically invulnerable.\n\n3.  Stacking BFs always works for me - crit helps a lot if you can get it fast, but honestly, so do multiple BFs.  If I get a sub 15 min BF (not too hard if you kill your enemy laner) consider buying another fast BF before crit.\n\n4.  I hardly ever build BkB, and if I do it's as a sixth item.  If they have silences I like manta because it has stats ember needs (tankability, move speed, and small damage bonuses).  The active is great for splitpushing with battlefury.  \n\n5.  Keep remnants somewhere safe, like the fountain.  Keep a TP on you and split push your heart out.  If they don't have huge counters to you/don't absolutely catch you out of position you are nigh impossible to kill when splitting.\n\n6.  Learn your W + Q combo.  If you can't do it without thinking, go practice in WTF mode vs the jungle.  \n\n7.  Skadi is an incredibly under appreciated item on ember.  It makes him very tanky and slowing everyone on their team with a sleight of fist is a huge.  \n\n8.  If you are comfortable with it and have a good defensive team, rapier isn't terrible with ember.  I think I've lost 1? game with an ember rapier, whereas I've easily won 7 + with one.\n\n9. If they pick Viper, ask to go safelane.  You will never win that lane unless the Viper is terrible.\n\n10.  If they have a midlaner with good phyiscal damage, consider an aquila.  Even if they don't - consider one.  I think it's better than drums on ember.\n\n11.  Don't be stupid.  Unless you are really fed you can die incredibly easy.  If you are playing against a void/similar carry \"poke\" at them with your abilities.  Don't commit unless your team isn't retarded.\n\nAny more questions ask, feel free to add me if you want.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/VirulentWalrus", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416085465", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you can, quick cast every skill. \n\nHere's my guide on how to play him, it is a bit different than how people normally plays it (people usually get aghs first, i get blink first). \n\nSkill build should be Net -&gt; Poof -&gt; Ult -&gt; Poof -&gt; Poof -&gt; Geo -&gt; Poof -&gt; Geo -&gt; Geo -&gt; Ult -&gt; Geo -&gt; Net -&gt; Net -&gt; Status (until full) -&gt; Net. \n\nBasically, by level 7 you want to have maxed out poof, ultimate, one level in net and one level if geo. Then max out your geo. Then raise your net to level 2/3. Then go status all the way, then net after that. Take ult whenever available.\n\nMy keybind is Q W E R (all quick cast) for all the skillz. Z, X C V G T for items. Spacebar for main meepo, 1 for selecting all meepo, 2 for second meepo, 3 for third meepo, 4 for fourth meepo, 5 for fifth meepo and 6 for selecting all meepo besides the main one. \n\n**HOW TO PLAY HIM**\n\nGet ring of regen, a tango and run to your lane (Meepo can be in any lane, but if you're new I suggest go duo lane or tri lane). Prioritize safety, you do not need to farm much but just... Don't die. \n\nOnce you're level 3, here's the tricky part. You have two Meepo. One of them stays in lane and farm as usual. The other one, pull the small camp every now and then. After pulling the small camp, stack any big camp. So you're now doing three things: farming from lane (Meepo 1), puling the small camp (Meepo 2), stacking big camp (Meepo 2). Practice this.\n\nOnce you're level 7, take both of your meepo to the stacked big camp (if you're good, you can have 2 camps that are stacked to three). Each camps need 4 poofs in order to be killed. So, double poof one camp, then run, then double poof it again. This way, you'll take minimal damage. \n\nYou should have your blink dagger at the latest by 12 minute. This includes tranquil too. \n\nOnce you're level 10, it's ganky ganky time. Leave two meepo in your lane, then roam with the main meepo. Gank mid or something. You're looking for a hero with a small HP, bonus points if they're a carry (SF, Sniper, Bounty Hunter etc etc). Get into blink range to them without being seen, then just do the blink poof combo. Your damage potential is huge. Do this again and again until the laning phase kind of fades away.\n\nYou're farming heroes and creeps now, looking for Aghanim Scepter. You should have this item latest by minute 23 (you can aim for minute 18 if you're doing really well). By now, the laning phase kind of fades away. They will start to enter pushing mode, rat, or roaming to force fights or whatever. You can do pretty much anything now, here are some things that you can do:\n\n* Continue ganking heroes as usual. Be careful though, at this stage of the game they would more likely have back ups.\n\n* Farm the jungle. To do this, assign each meepo clones to each big camp, then when they arrive just poof with each meepo clones and let them fight. You will still roam with main meepo looking for ganks. \n\n* Do a solo rosh. I recommend you to blink from the secret shop to do rosh, in order to avoid being detected by wards. Then just attack rosh will all 5 Meepo. Tank damage with one of your meepo until it have half a health, then alternate meepo. To alternate the 'tank', you simply pull away the previous meepo 'tank' and make another meepo to be closer to Roshan. Remember, Roshan will always attack the closest target. Do this until Roshan dies. Usually the enemy won't be expecting a meepo soloing a Roshan, so I usually do it as it is free gold, exp and aegis. \n\n* Farm multiple lanes. Meepo can quickly farm multiple lane. Each wave of creeps will die in two poofs. So, assign two meepo for each lane you want to farm, then when there's a wave of creeps just double poof them and you're good. Poof out immediately if you sense that it is too dangerous to farm there. You will still use your main meepo to roam and look for gank. \n\n* Farm ancient. Run out of jungle camps to farm? No safe lanes to farm? No more rosh? Well just do ancients then. Make all of your meepo attack the ancient while still roaming with your main meepo. \n\nDo a combination of these and look for the next item. This is up to you and your chosen build. My usual item progression goes like this: \n\nTranquil -&gt; Blink -&gt; Aghs -&gt; Skadi (best EHP item for meepo) -&gt; Pipe of Insight (reduce magic damage) -&gt; Boots of Travel -&gt; Ethereal Blade (best status item for meepo)\n\nI recommend you to follow this build, as it suits well with my guide. But if you want to try something new (Scythe is an amazing item for ganking, or maybe some people prefer to build Manta) then sure. \n\n**THINGS TO PRACTICE IN LOBBY BEFORE GOING TO ACTUAL MATCH**\n\n* Blink poof combo. This is a must. This is the very basic combo of Meepo. You must be fluent at this before you can play Meepo. There are some very odd Meepo build that doesn't use blink, but I've tried them and they're usually not good at all. \n\n* Healing all meepo. When you have at least three Meepo, then you can do this. Let's call these Meepo as Meepo A, Meepo B and Meepo C. Teleport Meepo A to base with a TP scroll, then poof Meepo B into it. When Meepo A is full, poof Meepo A into Meepo C, and poof Meepo C into Meepo B. Once Meepo B is full, poof Meepo B to Meepo A. Then when Meepo C is full poof it to Meepo A. Now you have all three Meepo health and mana full. Of course you can do this with more than 3 Meepo.\n\n* Level 3 laning phase. This is also core. Try to lane with one meepo, and do jungle stuff with the other meepo. The jungle stuff is as follow: stack any big camp by second 52/53 (depends on the camp). After you stack, go to the small camp, and then pull the camp one the time is appropriate. After killing the small camp, go immediately to the previous big camp, and stack again when it is 52/53. Repeat process.\n\n* Solo Roshan. Cheat your way to level 17, buy and aghs, blink and tranquil. Then if you want to be more realistic, set the time to minute 23. Blink-poof into Roshan from secret shop, then start practicing your alternate tanking method. Try to make the damage all equally distributed to all the Meepo. \n\n* Farming jungle. Cheat your way up to level 17 and get aghs and tranquils. Assign each clone meepo to each big camp. Poof once with all of them, then just wreck every camp on that jungle. Not that hard to learn. \n\n**OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n* After minute 50, Meepo is usually not that effective anymore. Remember, Meepo is not a hard carry. If you think that you can't fight the enemy straight up anymore, then just rat dota as hard as you can with Boots of Travel. \n\n* Do not lose hope if you do not reach your farming target. Meepo can easily catch back up on farm. He can farm multiple camps, lanes and heroes ffs. Just, do not lost hope. Even if you're getting your blink at early minute 20s, or your aghs by minute 28. Your chance of winning is still pretty big. As with all games in Dota, anything can happen, but if you lose hope then it is all over. \n\n* If you're getting ganked, do not immediately try to escape. Try to make plays (which is fucking cool). For example, poof one meepo into the ganked meepo, poof the ganked meepo out and poof all other meepo to the fight, effectively turning the gank around. Or maybe, do the healing all meepo technique (explained above) when you're being ganked, making it seems like you have infinite mana and HP and it seems pretty OP. \n\n* This build relies on ganking. Farm heroes AND creeps. Other build (who usually build aghs first) usually rely on farming jungle and lane much faster.\n\n* There are other build such as support Meepo (n0tail build), farming Meepo, rat Meepo, or ganking meepo (this one). You should try them all! \n\nGoodluck in playing Meepo!

{"body": "There is one very *slightly* gamey mechanic that makes it a hair of a hair better to send in 2 groups of 20, at least in the early game. Cavalry start out more powerful than infantry, right? Well, although they can flank pretty far, you can end up in a situation where your cavalry on the flanks kill what's in front of them and then be left to just sit there. But if you send 'em in 2 groups of 20, the game fills out the center first so you'll actually get cav mixed with your infantry. For example, in a 40 stack with 16 infantry, 8 cav, and 16 cannon (for instance), if you send them in all at once your front row will look like:\n\n    C C C C I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I C C C C \n\nBut if you send it in as 2 groups of 20 your front row will look like:\n\n    C C I I I I C C I I I I I I I I C C I I I I C C \n\nSo you'll be able to hit more with cavalry for longer. It's not much of an advantage, but if you're *reallllly* concerned with min-maxing, this is the way to do it.\n\n**Note**: I almost forgot to mention, to get this to work you have to send the stacks in one day apart.

But NOTHING from it reaches just the knee of this giant composition..\nTo learn some early Beethoven sonata, it takes me few days(weeks). This piece, I've been studying for like year and half, and still felt like driving a 5000horsepower MonsterTruck when playing this finally..\nAnd in fugue, I got nicely lost on one of these bloody thrills pasages in the middle and somehow jumped straight like 2 pages further.. (I think many people did not notice anything, but there WERE like 2 pages missing.. That's why I don't post Fugue on Youtube :), but the rest is there if somebody interested..\nBut on the otherhand.. Within last 4 years, I've heard many many records on Youtube, also listened to Sokolov live here in Amsterdam playing it, and well... how to say that - EVERYone struggles playing this piece. E v e r y o n e.. Sokolov as well.. I know very well how he plays - I listen to him every year here, and that guy mostly plays uncompromising perfect.. Here - so many mistakes (of course masterfully hidden), but it just shows that even Sokolov has a huge respect in front of this piece..\nThe version which I personaly consider \"the ultimate\" is one of the Gulda's life performance.. I think it comes from Beethoven days (in Bonn??) .. anyway, old b&amp;w video.. you can find it..\n\n(here is just my version, sorry for spamming with that here.. Just if you wanna see me sooooooooooooooooooooo small in front of Beethoven, here is the best chance..\n1.and2.\nhttp://youtu.be/V_2zKNZ5lIc\nand 3.+crazy bridge to fugue..\nhttp://youtu.be/_XK-ZJjzdQI\n(with extra shreding as well... :p ) )\nxxx\nBut you know, my teacher was right in one thing.. he was telling me: \"If you will be able to learn this, than \"most\" of the other compositions won't take you any long time to learn.. \" and I must say, he was true..\nCompare to this, Beethoven's early sonata  looks like walking in the park with 2 fingers in both noseholes.. \n:)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416139947", "subreddit": "classicalmusic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So this is going to be odd, since I'm [linking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku_p_Dx7kHE) to a japanese video, but what we need is just the first a i u e o part. e has two pronounciation, but for the purpose of this...comment, lets just follow that pronounciation. Sorry for the kindergarten approach, but apparently this works for young children whose first language is not malay. (No, not a teacher. I heard of it somewhere. I think.)\n\nWith some exceptions, all syllables rhymes with the japanese pronounciation. we'll ignore the second e for the next bit. Pick a melody.\n\nSing!! \n\n    a i u e o\n    ba bi bu be bo\n    ca ci cu ce co\n\nc is pronounced with english's 'ch' sound. g is hard g. the vowel pronounciation is consistent all the way to z. ignore q, x and v. the point is just to make the sounds familiar. Just sing until it doesn't feel awkward.\n\nthe second e pronounciation rhymes with the english word fur. try to minimise the r. . there's 3 more vowel sounds ai, au and oi. ai and au rhymes with eye and cow. Oi...you have to ask a local to make that sound. There's no english equivalent at all. \n\nTo recap of the vowels, 'a i u e o' to sing, the other e, ai and au should be familiar if you speak english and oi you have to hear to reproduce. luckily they're not that common. How do you choose which e pronounciation? A very general guide is if they're on the second syllable or is the single first vowel its the Japanese sound, if they're on the first syllable its the fur sound except for consonant+e+m, but e+m on the first syllable uses the Japanese sound, and there's a lot of words that are exceptions. sorry.\n\nSo you can make the vowels and consonant+vowel sounds. there are also consonant-vowel-consonant for example\n\n    bang (bangsal)\n    bing (bingkai)\n    bung (bungkus)\n    beng (bengkok)\n    bong (bonggol)\n\n    tan (tanda)\n    tin (tindan)\n    tun (tunduk)\n    ten (tentu)\n    ton (tonton)\n\nJust follow how they would sound in English while being mindful of the vowel pronounciation. \n\nVocab and grammar-wise? you still have to read and speak.

{"body": "This goes back to the time when U and V were actually the same letter; so, in fact, were I and J. This is what the classical Latin alphabet looked like:\n\nA B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z\n\nBut in handwriting, it looked a bit more like this:\n\n*a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u x y z*\n\nNotice that in the capital letters, there is no J or U; and in the cursive letters, no *i* or *v*. Instead, you had the following capital/cursive pairs: I*j* and V*u*. So the name \"Julius\" would, in Latin, be carved in stone as \"IVLIVS\", but written by hand as \"*juljus*\".\n\nThese letters could be used as vowels or consonants; so the letter \"I\" as a vowel had a sound like the \"i\" in \"sit\", and as a consonant a sound like the \"y\" in \"yes\"; the letter \"V\" had as a vowel a sound like the \"u\" in \"put\", and as a consonant... well, it was either like our \"w\", or like our \"v\". The smart money is on \"w\", but there were no tape recorders in those days so we can't be sure. But a word like \"*uacuum*\" might have been pronounced \"wack-woom\", and explains why our word \"vacuum\" has two Us in it. The phrase \"*uenj ujdj ujcj*\", which we usually spell \"veni vidi vici\" (\"I came, I saw, I conquered\") might have been pronounced \"wenny weedy weeky\" or \"wenny weedy wee-chee\" (again, we can't be sure).\n\nWhen the Roman alphabet was used to write other languages, those other languages often had sounds that didn't exist in Latin. Sometimes they added extra letters (for example, the letters Ð and Þ, which are still used in modern Icelandic), sometimes they put two or more letters together to make a new sound (for example, our TH).\n\nFor some languages, a new letter was created by doubling the letter V -- so VV; or, in cursive, *uu*. Hence the name, \"double-U\".\n\nBut additionally, the letters I and V were \"split\", to make two versions of each -- originally, one for the vowel and one for the consonant. So the letter I*j* was split to make Ii for the vowel and Jj for the consonant (which in modern English is now pronounced differently -- in modern German it's still pronounced like our Y); V*u* was similarly split to make Uu (vowel) and Vv (consonant).\n\nThe W took on the form of the V, but we kept the name \"double-U\". This is actually appropriate, because the English \"w\" sound is, in effect, a very short \"u\" sound.\n\nLanguages like French didn't originally have this letter, because it wasn't needed -- except for writing foreign words, like \"le weekend\". But since the W now looks like two Vs, the French called it \"double-V\".\n\nIncidentally, although you might not think it, the sounds of \"W\" and \"V\" are, phonetically, very closely related. Native English speakers can hear the difference so clearly they don't realise how similar they are; many Germans, however, find it very difficult, and often confuse the sounds, saying \"wiolin\" instead of \"violin\", for example. Both sounds are also very closely related to \"U\".", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416151845", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 219, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Im a Plat 3 mid laner, I have something like a 67% winrate on Karthus over about 35 games, and as long as Fizz gets banned I never have issues. I initially picked him up because he is a counter to Yasuo (none of his spells are affected by windwall) and after the nerfs to Yasuo just kept playing him. Exhaust is my new favorite mid spell because of Karthus; in the league of assassins and AD mids, it just outperforms ignite so often.\n\nThe easiest matchups for Karthus are Yasuo, Zed, and Jayce. He is even with Syndra in lane but outperforms her late game, beats Orianna in lane but Shockwave is the best spell in the game so they are even late. Fizz can go in AND out without using summoners, which is what lets him mess with Karthus so well. Karth loves dive-happy assassins who must all-in, because Exaust and 2 Q hits usually deals more than any assassin is willing to take, especially because they are on Defile the whole time. Plus every enemy lane has to play with the mindset of having -250 HP after Karth gets 6, so there is less chance of your bot or top losing an engagement.\n\nYou say its down to the enemy mid to push, but Karthus outpushes EVERYBODY. I have fought TF's and taken their tower before they touch mine. The trick is to use your AA's for the safe CS and Q for the long ones + harass instead of Q for safe AND unsafe CS like most new Karthus players want to do.\n\nIdk, the current balance of Karthus means he REALLY needs items to do damage with Defile and Requiem, so it is more impactful IF you shut him down (Rather than S2 Karthus who could still outdamage your mid even after losing lane). His damage is rather fixed at all stages, hence most items you buy are tanky (My build is Tear ROA Seraphs Zhonya's Void GA, with Sorcs early and Mercs late), and because you are Karthus you have a big target on your head that says KILL ME BEFORE I KILL ALL OF YOU, but it doesn't do anything to try and kill a tanky Karth, he can probably live and if he doesnt W Q Q Q R is easy as hell to make happen.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416166556", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Modes are actually not as complicated as it seems. \n\nIf we were to spell out the A Dorian mode you'd get A B C D E F# G A. Well, provided you know that a key works in a series of whole and half steps, you see that spelt as W H W W W H W. All major scales follow the WWHWWWH series of steps, and A Dorian, being a major scale, is no different. It's the same as a major scale and if you look at the actual notes ABCDEF#G you may notice that it shares all of its notes with a major key. To play in a Dorian mode you start with your major key, let's say the key of G major and you simply base your playing off of the second note in the G major scale. The G major scale is GABCDEF#, A Dorian is ABCDEF#G. you just shifted up a whole step. The A Dorian mode is just you using the notes of a G major scale to play in A minor. If you wanted to play in a Mixolydian mode you look at it just the same only instead of basing it around note 2 of a major scale you focus on the 5th. In G major you'd be playing a D Mixolydian. \n\nWhen you're playing your run of the mill major scale, you're actually playing in a mode. It's called ionian. G Ionian is exactly the same as G major. So, you've been using modes, you just didn't know it. \n\nAs for how to implement them, that gets very in depth pretty quick. It's not that hard to understand, it's just getting a foothold. Then it all just comes with time. Not to mention the spillover. Once you understand some chord theory the whole world of modes is opened up to you and it's up to you to refine it. \n\nHope I explained it well. To recap, A Dorian is exactly the same as G major, you're just accentuating the A instead of the G. D Mixolydian is the same way, but with the 5th.

{"body": "So if we're talking modes I'm going to assume you've got a decent understanding of a major scale (if you don't please correct me). If you do, congratulations! You've got one mode down (the Ionian mode). So in C it looks like this:\n\nC D E F G A B (C)\n\nAnd our interval relationship (W for whole step, H for half step) is:\n\nW W H W W W H \n\nCool? now let's look at a minor scale, or as it's also known: the Aeolian mode. In it's easiest to understand form it starts on A. \n\nA B C D E F G (A)\n\nNow it's important to note that I picked the natural minor scale, the harmonic and melodic versions both play around with the relationship between the sixth and seventh scale degrees to give us different semblances of the half step ending that we're used to, but that's not super important right now. Our interval relationship for the natural minor scale is:\n\nW H W W H W W \n\nNow hopefully you've noticed that our C major and A minor scales are composed of the same notes. This is because A is the relative minor of C, which is another explanation. What's important about this for modes is that by emphasizing another note in the scale (in this case A) it sounds like it is the root of the scale. \n\nSo what if we do this with the second note of our C major scale? \n\nD E F G A B C (D) \n\nW H W W W H W \n\nThis is called the Dorian mode, and it's used a lot like natural minor with a raised sixth. Again, same notes as C major, we just emphasize a different one. So the seven modes come from emphasizing a different note in the scale. That's the basic premise. As long as you keep the intervalic relationship the same, you've got the corresponding mode in whatever key you want it in. So C aeolian looks like this:\n\nC D Eb F G Ab Bb (C) \n\nAnd C dorian like this: \n\nC D Eb F G A Bb (C)\n\nThat's the basic idea of modes, from there it's mostly about learning how to use them. For example Phrigian (emphasizing the third note in a major scale [so from E to E on the white keys of a piano, or: \n\nE F G A B C D (E)\n\nH W W W H W W])\n\nis typically what you think of if you play an E major chord and then an F major bar chord on the first fret back and forth. It's used in a lot of flamenco music. It's distinctive because of the half step between the first and the second notes (but not to be confused with Locrian (B to B on white keys, very rarely used because it's a strange one), and C Phrygian looks like this:\n\nC Db Eb F G Ab Bb (C)\n\nAnd Lydian (emphasizing the fourth note of a major scale [F to F on white keys:\n\nF G A B C D E (F) \n\nW W W H W W H])\n\nis what the Simpsons theme is based on. It sounds like a major scale with a sharp fourth, which sticks out to our ears. \n\nMixolydian is the only other one I haven't mentioned, it'd be G to G on a piano: \n\nG A B C D E F (G)\n\nand it sounds like a major scale with a b7th. \n\nSo basically the modes are a method of playing with tonality and creating moods based on emphasizing a note in a scale and tinkering with the intervalic relationship between notes. Let me know if I can answer any questions for you, modes are pretty tricky to wrap your head around. I look at it as kind of like doing an accent when you're talking. Same basic building blocks (assuming you're still speaking English), just a slightly different flavor for effect.

And yeah, I'm actually confused why the sheet music is calling the chord D/A when there isn't a major third (I checked).\n\nAnd as a guitarist, if I'm figuring out some chord progression, would I need to know if one of these chords are inverted? Would that affect my ability to correctly identify things like what key the progression's in for example?

{"body": "**I played twice against Theude**, right before he qualified for the EU Blizzcon qualifiers (which he could not attend to). The first time, I was a hunter that was running out of gas in the late game VS his priest. But right when the situation was desperate and his board way stronger, my webspinner got me a KING KRUSHUUU who won me the game, leaving him in shock.\n\nThe following day, I faced him with my Deathrattle Priest against an aggro mage he was testing, consisting of cheap burst and very few minions. I felt in danger near the end, but it was a pretty easy win overall. I tried to add him after the game to tell him that was me who got the King Krush the previous day and surprisingly, he accepted the invite and answered a couple questions. I still have him on my Friends' list. \n\nFunny anecdote: at Seat Story Cup, during his semi finals, he got a notification that a friend of his got Van Cleef out of pack. The chat went wild spamming V A N C L E E F B O Y S for a minute. That lucky guy was... me. I was the star of Twitch chat once in my life.\n\nMore recently, **I played against Amaz**. I was on Hunter and him was on Priest. He played a very weird one with Faceless manipulator and other weird stuff I can't remember. I have a screenshot of me dominating the game, but the following two turns he managed to clear the board and proceeded to control the late game.\n\n**I also played against Logan** of Viagame cup.

{"body": "Sadly, there are a number of reasons behind it all. As previously stated, back in the day arcades were king, people spent hundreds of dollars in the form of quarters for extra lives, continuing, etc. Secondly, FaceBook was once expected to be an even worse failure than MySpace. Now, they have gazillions of daily users. Over the past few years during the FB lifeline + the passing of Steve Jobs from Apple, we got everything from Angry Birds to Candy Crush. The mix into the scenario the explosion of World of Warcraft. Way too many kids, with no maturity or comprehension of the financial costs to their parents. Mix into that, in a single generation, we've gone from the Atari 2600, 22.8kbps dial-up modems, and AOL to the Occulus Rift, PlayStation 4, and broadband Internet. Sadly, way too many parents didn't have to deal with the difference between handwriting and a typewriter. In our generation, technology has gone through a faster tech explosion greater than what happened with industry in the Industrial Revolution. It is way too easy for any talented 10 year old these days to get their hands on a parent's credit card, and most of them know more about sex than their grandparents know much less their parents. If you look at it all together, in-app purchases is no real surprise. You think Candy Crush as being a \"horrible\" cash grabbing hoe, you seem to easily forget arcades, or more recently *cough* World of Warcraft. From 6 year olds to grandparents have spent thousands of dollars buying fictional magical \"special\" swords or mounts. The real trick with dealing with the issue is IAP. There are a few simple rules of thumb to keep in mind. First, if a game is available as both free and paid, try out the free version before your decide to buy it. Secondly, take reviews off everywhere from the iTunes Store to Amazon and in between, take the reviews with a grain of salt. My best friend's older sister is an advertising executive. She's handled advertising from every company from Pepsi to Toyota. She said you really shouldn't believe what you think you read much less think you see. There are multi-billion dollar advertising companies out there, with massively large sized departments, paid to do nothing but put out \"user\" reviews from \"real\" customers. Third, before you spend a penny on buying any game or buy any in app purchase, take a second. Look at the app description. If the game has no existing direct contact information to contact support, or has a broken non-existing support site, or is only in an unknown from foreign language, or hasn't been updated even once in the past 6 months, use the brains God gave you. Don't buy it. Just because \"supposedly\" there are \"thousands\" of supposed players make a game constantly in the top 20 games on the store for months, take a minute. Investigate the developer, the producer, support services, etc. I know I know, *ugh* is is so hard to do..... Seriously? Stop being lazy and stop wasting money. Even if you think you can't live without Candy Crush, and Angry Birds, trust me, you'll be thankful after doing as tiny bit of work before deciding to spend your money. If the dev or producer has a modern, easy to use, quick response support time from a real person (not some sort of generic form letter). If the app gets frequent updates. If the paid/pro version had zero advertising. If they actually respect you, and respect your privacy. Then you have found some real gold worth your money. If not, you are throwing money away. Unless you happen to be loaded with cash (I am fully disabled on a very limited income) in which case, I'll give you my contact information so you can throw all the money away you like my way, instead of some fictional magic sword bought inside a game/app. But, simply, stop being lazy and stop being impatient. Use your brains. There are many respectable game dev that truly care about their players. Heaven forbid you spent $4.99 or O H M Y Goddddddddd!!!!!! spend $9.99 or $19.99 for an game, everyone needs a place to live, food to eat, and deserve being paid for the hundreds to thousands of hours spent on game development. If you actually keep a tally of every in app purchase you or one of your kids spends, you'll see after just a few weeks, that \"free\" game will cost you $50, $75, or $100 or more. By comparison, spending $4.99 initially with no other costs....

This is partially why some people can hear a difference between an aluminum and a gold CD, SHM cds, a pressed cd and the same exact data on a burned cd, etc. even though the data contained between disc A and B is exactly the same. Also why people can hear differences between different players with digital outs.\n\nAccurately ripping the PCM data and reading it from file based storage ensures bit perfect transmission to the conversion stage every single time, as there is more data redundancy upon transmission and also much more robust forms of error correction in transmission than methods devised in the 70's/80's. (Not to mention also a helluva lot more convenient)\n\n\nHigh quality DACs do perform better as there can be linearity issues at lower levels approaching the noise floor of 16bit audio, that's however more of a problem with older converters.\n\nConsider than in say, a $200 CD player, the DAC stage may account for maybe $50 of the production cost, (being generous) whereas a $200 standalone DAC had a considerably higher amount of money and engineering focused on solely doing that one job- converting 10100001 to G A B C D E F. It's almost like comparing the phono pre-amp built into an Lp-120 and an inexpensive standalone Pre-amp.\n\nAdd in the convenience, and the ability to playback higher resolution files wherever applicable - it's a clear winner.

My code still runs in places since this was all key infrastructure work. No, I won't tell you what it was. \n\nIn my time, NO ONE WANTED TO DO COMPUTER SCIENCE. NO ONE. \n\nOnly people like me who were mathematically inclined, and drifted to the computer centre to run simulations in Fortran. There were NO computer science jobs. NONE. Get it?\n\nTen years go by, and you can cut to 1996. What do we have here? The entire western world freaking out over Y2K. Tens of millions of lines of garbage code written in Cobol, and not enough people to go through it painfully to find the problems. How do you think the \"mass recruiters\" etc got their start?\n\nYou don't need computer scientists to deal with this kind of stuff. \n\nWhat we did was teach the CFO in US companies that there was money to saved by moving grunt work abroad and the bloody IT boom was born. Hell, mass recruiters don't even want to hire CS people, as they're high maintenance. They want low quality duhs who they can train to do the minimum necessary stuff to keep their high volume low margin businesses running.\n\nSince mummy and daddy have discovered thanks to these companies publicity machines that there are secure jobs to be had in volume in this low end \"IT\" jobs, we now have a problem that this \"industry\" is full of \"engineers\" with zero logical and mathematical skills, who only know how to google copy/paste code from StackExchange.\n\nDeve Gowda, many are his faults, but some years ago he questioned why some Indian companies were signing up for so much land in and around Bangalore and other big cities.

{"body": "Alrighty, well i havent played with mants on for some time, but heres a few good all around tips that'l improve your chances of survival from raiding parties:\n\n* Walls, 2 block tall walls, will save you from mants, goblins, ogres, bears, whatever, it'l help, 4 is a good height, but takes awhile to do, so i dont bother with that high. A nice perk of walls, is it cuts off SOV[Sight Of View] from the outside world, in turn, even if you dont manage to catch the scout, if they can't see ANY of your gnomads, or they see you, they wont find you. but when they do, they will storm the door! Which leads to my next tip.\n\n* Training 24/7 at the doorway, if not 24/7, ALWAYS at night time, why night? because you wont know whats gonna come at you, if its a day raid, you can prepare, at night, its now or not at all.\n\n* Doors, Doors are the greatest cheap, early game defence you will ever get, if you want your guys to last days, door every doorway possible, thanks to a update a few months ago, doors have a durability now, so yay! you can use doors as a good way to slow them down, i recommend stone doors simply because there easier to make and it fits realistically. \n\n* Now that we covered doors and training, lets talk of your entrance, i recommend this:\n\nX = Wall\n\nO = Open Space(Air)\n\nD = Door\n\nX X X X X X D X\n\nX O D D D D O X\n\nX D X X X X X X\n\nX O D D D D O X\n\nX X X X X X D X\n\nWhat this will do, is when they come, and im sure they will eventually, it'l make them have to break down every single door, you can extend this, shorten it, whatever, it'l really help you early game until you can get a proper doorway with traps and mechanisms! \n\nHope this helps", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416334503", "subreddit": "gnomoria", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[ayy 3x3](http://i.imgur.com/kmy2Oyt.jpg)\n\n[last fm](http://www.last.fm/user/Fatumdes)\n\n**EDIT:** I'm bored at school so I'll put in some more commentary and stuff to explain this explosion of 10/10's.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Shit imma do favorite songs for each album. Still bored AF.\n\n* **Big K.R.I.T - Cadillactica:** So yeah this is my new AOTY, knocking You're Dead! off the throne. Like, this album has 0 wack beats. None. Nada. There's not a single song that I'd skip over, not a single song that feels like filler or like it shouldn't be here. This album to me is what I'd kinda imagine CuDi sounding like if he was more confident and just kept rapping after AKnC instead of going with the more artsy singing stuff. Great album, definitely recommend.  10/10 \n\n * **Favorite Songs:** [Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmuHEl-tCas), [Cadillactica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIeuw1Ce5pk) and [Saturday = Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J207eco5gFk)\n\n* **Danny Brown - XXX:** Dick jokes, colorful delivery, great beats. Touched on this last week, but this album has really been growing on me. Danny in general really has. Pac Blood is top 3 modern hip-hop songs for me. \"The Shakespear of the 16's/Dipping my ink pen\" is just disgusting, and that fucking hook holy shit.  10/10 \n\n * **Favorite Songs:** [Pac Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjIpHoXcihI), [Monopoly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj0jiEIyT24) and [30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J--rO7FP16U)\n\n* **J Cole - Friday Night Lights:** Soulful stuff. J-Cole in general is really good, but all of his stuff is way too safe for me if that makes sense. There's a great post on /r/hhh that explains my issues with him, but I'm too lazy to look it up. 8/10 \n * **Favorite Songs:** [Villematic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbM4-RgOI8A) \n\n* **The Roots - Illadelph Halflife:** My favorite Roots album. Not gonna explain to you guys why it's so good, because I want you guys to find out on your own, so just listen to it. 10/10\n\n * **Favorite Songs:** [Episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvb9jB1gGI0), [Concerto Of The Desperado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBpsGtC7za8) and [The Adventures in Wonderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9_lbusFRI8)\n\n* **Frank Ocean - Channel Orange:** DAE Andre 3000's verse on Pink Matter? Nah seriously, I'm not a big R&amp;B fan but this album is super duper good. It's accessible, has great guest verses and not a single bad song imo, hence the 10/10.\n\n * **Favorite Songs:** [Sierra Leone,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGDYx0yMoVg) [Super Rich Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVGa9PuzMBg) and [Pink Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spvGL58EFjc) \n\n* **Run the Jewels - RTJ/RTJ2:** ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ F U C K B O Y S ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ 10/10\n\n * **Favorite Songs RTJ:** [Run The Jewels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfuCLp8VEng), [Banana Clipper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elafeeA3QFE) and [Sea Legs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GAIkESrQr0)\n \n * **Favorite Songs RTJ2:** [Jeopardy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSU15Q1m_1E), [Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-eyupWGfS8) and [Love Again (Akinyele Back)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BKj_P296E4)\n\n* **The Roots - Things Fall Apart:** The Roots' breakthrough album. It's really fucking good, jazzy stuff with great drumming. Probably the better album than Illadelph from an objective point of view, but Illadelph just sounds better to me personally. Still a 10/10, y'all should listen to this album.\n\n * **Favorite Songs:** [The Spark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSh9IGI-8h0), [Adrenaline!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN_3ylqka3Q) and [Don't See Us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49lm-oJowU)\n\n* **OutKast - Stankonia:** This album is a lot more electric than their previous efforts. Like, I had a really hard time getting into this album because it was so radically different than the typical OutKast sound I got to know and love and because it is so all over the place. Now that I have listened to it a couple of times it's definitely an album I find myself loving. Still a 10/10 tho because it's OutKast. \n\nMy current tier list for Outkast albums is like this:\n\n**S-Tier:** Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Aquemini\n\n**A-Tier:** Stankonia, ATLiens\n\n**B-Tier:** Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\n\n**C-Tier:** Idlewild\n\n* **Favorite Songs:** [So Fresh, So Clean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5AfjAXcBXY), [Ms Jackson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3USQRmVy0uc) and [B.o.B.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaFygeknae8)\n\nAlso, GY!BE is coming to the Netherlands in April.

{"body": "&gt;     we admit 20 percent less black students than is representative\n&gt; \n&gt; and correct it (the quota isn't necessarily arbitrary)\n\nSo what determines what is representative and what isn't? The parent population \"population of country x\"?  \nThat seems odd to me. Is it really in the university's best interest to mirror the population distribution of its country instead of admitting only those students best suited for an academic career (regardless of their ethnic background)?  \nThis is my thought process: There are 6 hypothetical applicants for 4 available degree positions at the university. 3x ethnicity A and 3x ethnicity B.  \nFor this degree math skills are important. The 6 applicants all have different aptitudes when it comes to math. From best to worst they rank in the following order: A B B B A A.\nSo naturally one would assume that A, B, B and B get admitted.\n\nBut it turns out the population distribution A:B is 3:1. As a result the As receive favored treatment. A, B, A and A get admitted. So in order to fulfill the quota, the university rejected two candidates that would have been much more eligible for their course of studies!\n\nThis is all coming from a completely oblivious central European, so please excuse my cultural ineptitude.

Los que empezaron esta rivalidad en gran parte fueron ustedes, tratando de sacarnos del server, tratandonos como \"f u c k i n g   b e a n e r s\" todo el tiempo.

Tal vez no haya sido así con todos, pero con la mayoría si, por lo menos desde mi punto de vista. La solución a esto es que de una puta vez se acabe el racismo, la manía que tienen de relacionar constantemente una persona de habla hispana con los d d o s, con h a c k s, con que son malos y todo eso, gran parte de la comunidad cambiaría en todo aspecto si se empieza por esto, pero muchos siguen creyendo que la solución es sacar a los \"b e a n e r s\" de nuevo.

{"body": "Great speech delivered by a passionate and professional (did I use that word for a 16y old?) speaker. Exactly right for the occasion. She has been accused of using only common-place statements, that everybody can support.  But she is not there to deliver a business presentation with statistics. Instead, she is there as a symbol and as an inspiration for others to support her cause of education and emancipation. Her speech is her personal declaration of independence. She establishes herself as strong and articulate, not silent and weak. She is quite the opposite of the scared victim her opponents want her to be. She raises her voice to be heard, quite literally. Listen, I'm back!\n\nIt's amazing how naturally she speaks in front of the crowd as if she never did anything else. Enunciation, pace, volume, pitch, almost perfect. Note how she keeps eye contact. She communicates with everybody in the room and beyond. She knows that the world is watching. Compare that with those sterile teleprompter speeches by Obama and the like. Note how skillfully she modulates the contrast between pairs of words. Light - Darkness, Voice - Silence, Pens - Guns (she even manages to convey the feeling of fear in this one word). High volume for one, low voice for the other. Almost tender for words like child, mother, father or together/togetherness. Her application of strategic pauses is  p e r f e c t. People  l i s t e n  to her. She commands respect, she creates suspense, people wait for her words. Note her addressing the secretary general at 10:30. He reminds me of a school boy called to order. The anecdote with the boy and the book, \"...they think that god is a tiny, little conservative being...\". Note how she accelerates the pace within these few sentences to highlight the mere monstrosity, \"send girls to hell for going to school\".\n\nObviously, Malala Yousafzai knows how to work the audience. Despite her young age she is an absolute professional. She had given many speeches and interviews before the attempt on her life. There are many examples of her eloquence on youtube, you realize her capabilities even without understanding the language. She is even experienced enough to cover up the fact, that half of her face is paralyzed (at least at the time of this speech). Half of her mouth is of no use to her. You have heard it. Have you noticed it? Listen to her O's and I's.\n\nNow, of course, the question comes up, are these her own words? This perfectly structured speech from the first warming up the crowd through enumerating all the people she wants to thank to the powerful last statement, Education First. The speech comprising ~20 well placed different rhetoric devices? I don't know. But there are hints. In interviews she and her father talked about her writing the speech for the UN. Well, that is no proof. But if you listen to interviews where she speaks without manuscript and keep an eye on the wording and the rhetoric devices, there are many similarities. I think it's very well possible. My guess is that she wrote at least the draft manuscript and then they worked on it together, why not.\nBut whoever wrote the text, she delivered the speech with amazing grace and surprising professionality.\n\nHer messages?\n\n* I'm not your victim, you can kill me, but I will come back stronger than you can imagine (Yes, Obi wan Malala ;) ).\n* My god is the god of all beings, and he is tolerant and merciful.\n* Peace cannot be accomplished by more war.\n* Only education can provide sustainable peace.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416436362", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

What I decided is it's probably more trouble than it's worth.\n\nWhat thylacine222 suggests *is* a general solution, just as a pattern rather than a single function. Any partial application can be represented by wrapping original function in a new one with fewer arguments. This wrapping can always be handled using a wrapping function, but you need different wrapping functions for different patterns of partial application.\n\nCurrying works because it's a convenient special case - the wrapping function is the application operator `$`. But if you want all patterns of partial application to be supported, you need a more general notation - one that can't exploit being a simple special case.\n\nLamda just isn't that bad a notation for expressing a pattern of partial application...\n\n    \\b d f -&gt; fn a b c d e f\n\nThe notational overhead isn't much more than repeating the three arguments that you don't want to apply - listing the arguments you want to keep as arguments. Sure lambda is more general than that and not optimized for this, and you can invent slightly more concise notations, but is it really worthwhile?\n\nHow often do you need this?

{"body": "Hey man,\n\nWall of text...pas sur par ou commencer.\n\n36 ici.  Pas marie mais pas celibataire.  Comme toi j'en suis sur, tout le monde au tour de moi se marie (depuis plusieurs annees maintenant!), a des flots et oui, divorce (deja!).  J'aimerais pouvoir te dire que tu vas rencontrer l'ame soeur et que la vie va peter des fleurs, mais ce n'est pas certain, et personellement c'est une notion en laquelle je ne crois pas vraiment.\n\nAu courant de ma vie, j'ai vecu / sorti / couche avec A B C D E F G H I J K L M et je suis presentement avec N.  Plusieurs de ces relations se sont etirees sur plusieurs annees.  Toutes les filles etaient differentes; different format, differente nationalite, differente histoire, different buts.  Il semble qu'il n'y ait pas de formule magique.\n\nPersonellement, il y a 10 ans quand ma relation with ehhh mettons E s'est terminee dans un bain de larme, de tricherie et de mensonges, j'ai pakte mes p'tits et crisse mon camp.  J'ai roule jusqu'a ce que je manque de route.  L'idee derriere ca n'etait pas seulement de changer d'air (crisse que j'avais besoin de changer d'air!) mais aussi changer de job, entendre parler de d'autre chose que des calisse de cheveux de Veronique Clouthier (et du crisse de niaisage politique) et de vivre des experiences que les gens que je connaissait n'avaient pas vecu.\n\nA 36 ans, je ne suis toujours pas sur que la personne avec laquelle je suis presentement est \"la personne de ma vie\".  Beaucoup de mes chums, entre 32 et 42 ans, sont celibataires et divorces, certains recemment.  Il semble qu'il n'y ait pas de formule pour \"Ne pas passer le reste de ta vie tout seul\". En d'autre mots : peu importe qui tu rencontres, les chances sont bonnes, particulierement de nos jours, que tu ne passe pas toute ta vie avec cette meme personne.  C'est un \"combat sans fin\".\n\nPersonellement, je trouve ridicule (s'cusez) de considerer que le but de la vie est de trouver \"l'ame soeur\" et de \"faire des flots\".  Il y a plus, beaucoup plus, et c'est completement faux de penser que tu gaspilles ta vie ou que \"tu es un loser\" en etant celibataire et sans enfant.\n\nSi le vide est fait au tour de toi, peut etre que tu as du travaille a faire.  Apres mon move j'ai compris que \"nobody gives a flying fuck about your opinions\" et c'est une notion que je partage avec les gens qui ont de tres fortes opinions; c'est ben beau les opinions et les convictions, mais c'est tanant en crisse quelqu'un qui ne peut pas se la fermer avec ses opinion souvent sous-informees (99% des gens ne peuvent justifier leurs opinions).  Avoir une opinion c'est aussi facile que d'avoir un flot; pas besoin d'info, pas besoin de training, bang pis ca fait l'affaire.  Pourquoi je parle de ca? Parce que ne pas donner ton opinion a la moindre occasion et ecouter a la place va t'ammener tres loin.  \"Ta yeule, pis ecoute\" est une lecon que tout le monde devrait comprendre; ca aide entre amis, et ca aide dans les relations de couple.  J'ai compris ca dans la trentaine.\n\nQuand je suis parti, j'etais avec la fille parfaite (du moins je pensais dans le temps).  Ca m'a pris du temps avant de passer par dessus, mais 10 ans plus tard, ayant pris du recul, je comprend que c'etait une relation de marde, et la fille etait parfaite parce que **je ne connaissait rien de mieux**.  Pourquoi en gras? Parce que ca s'applique a n'importe quoi.

By sequentially feeding these word vectors into a recurrent neural network, one which also keeps an internal state vector of similar dimension, one can then extract word vectors in sequence which represent words in some other language. The neural network learns to translate sequences like X Y Z into A B C D (where X Y Z might be English and A B C D might be French).\n\nThe image captioning technique is basically the same, but instead of feeding in a sentence, you feed in an image to a convolutional neural network (a different variant of neural network structure) which outputs the initial state vector encoding features and objects of the image. Then you feed this state vector into a recurrent neural network which unpacks it sequentially into the word vectors in a particular language, such as English.\n\nThese word and sentence vectors seem to be becoming the most plausible mechanism for how thoughts and concepts are represented in the brain. The book How to Build a Brain http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0199794545 argues from the side of neuroscience and large-scale brain simulation that these high dimensional vector representations are sufficient for simulating several human level behaviors at much smaller scales in supercomputers.\n\nThe image captioning and language translation with neural networks is coming from the computer science area. These two areas, neuroscience and computer science seem to be converging on a similar model, which demonstrably is approaching thinking.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416460558", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I got to plat in season 4 (twice – as I dropped out after a bad streak of trying different stuff, played warwick solid for ~10 games was back in plat) using warwick and found him incredibly strong. Part of the reason he’s so strong is the cooldown on his ultimate (which has unfortunately been nerfed, but he’s still very strong). His late game is immense. Rushing a Wriggles lantern first item is definitely core, followed by (personal preference)  boots of mobility or Ninja Tabi / Mercury Treads were required. I prefer Mobi’s for a rounded off game.\n\nYou level W Q E Q Q R Q E Q E  E (skill order R &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; W) and rush through the jungle. I used to buy machete 4 health pots until I realised this is ABSOLUTELY pointless. Im not sure about the new jungle but I will be testing this to confirm, ive played him on teambuilder on the new minions and its no different, not sure if the jungle items change anything, I doubt it. I actually started getting machete’s – one health pot, one mana pot, then a ward. Because you never use the health potion ever, unless you’re unlucky to get ganked early and need to catch up a bit. You never die. You’re always on full health. \n\nAfter feral flare / boots you want to focus on how your game is progressing. If you are lucky to get an early kill before 6 or and apply pressure you can then move onto going for a wit’s end (if you have a strong AP enemy composition) or blade of the ruined king ( for a HP stacking tanky team ) – I actually found myself favouring Wits end as the sustain from BoTRK is not really essential – you already have enough sustain. \n\nIf you are behind you focus on CDR and tankyness. Glacial Shroud is absolute king for first item unless you have a full AP enemy composition. If you do, rush Spirit Visage. Once you have shroud I tend to either complete frozen heart, or go for spirit visage (if you are struggling for health, see who is doing most damage towards you and build accordingly). I tend not to die much, because warwick is so goddamn tanky and strong.\n\nUse your ult carefully to pick off enemies and constantly roam, constantly apply pressure. You should plan a gank accordingly with your ult cooldown, as soon as its up you need to use it somewhere on the map, so constantly look around for opportunities. With the new jungle you will need to keep an eye on timers for dragon and buffs too. This is essential but very easy.\n\nI cant honestly see your playstyle changing, don’t be a warwick who lives on just farming – you need to use your ult as much as possible and remember how strong you are once you ult someone, you get a lot of sustain and survival. Also late game with a feral flare and BoTRK or Wits end you delete carry’s who don’t have QSS or any armor/MR.\n\n\nedit: forgot to mention, dont build any more damage other than feral flare (or the new version (devourers?)) and wits end or botrk. you should always build tanky and cdr and just become that immovable object that ults people and runs away laughing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416497270", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "It wasn't the most mature stage we ever made, but my friends an I had fun in a dick-shaped custom level. The shaft had two elevators that led to the top, and the balls were a \"safe zone\" where we could beat the shit out of each other. Basically, the only way to win was to hurt someone so bad they ricocheted all the way up the shaft. Players usually went 600% to 700% before this happened. The top of the balls were donut blocks, so when items fell on them, it would cause an opening in the \"safe zone\".\n\nAfter awhile, we found we just liked this set up because it was a sort-of \"cage match\". The layout was something like this:\n \n            B     B      \n          B         B    \n            B E   B      \n            B |   B      \n            B | ^ B      \n            B v | B      \n            B   | B      \n      B D D B   E B D D B\n    B                     B\n    B B       B B       B B\n      B B B B B B B B B B\n\nB = Block\n\nD = Donut block\n\nE = Elevator\n\nThe \"hooks\" built into the shaft made it a lot more challenging. Like, the two at the head were a saving grace; if you got caught in them while bouncing up, you were saved, unless you had so much momentum that you bounced out. Likewise, the little dips at the bottom of the balls caused people to spend a lot of force ricocheting back and force. Besides that, if you were at the top, you could pop out and activate the donut blocks, putting everyone in danger.\n\nHonestly, the design turned out to be brilliant.

{"body": "It's not controversial. There are some people who want to claim it is, but they are mostly philosophers, not mathematicians. Mathematics, as opposed to philosophy, is not driven by controversy. It's people on the fringes of mathematics who would like to present a philosophical problem as a mathematical one, and unfortunately those are often the loudest.\n\nThe Axiom of Choice asserts the existence of certain sets, which are often impossible to construct in any explicit way. The most common way of putting it is as follows: If you have a collection of non-empty sets, then it is possible to *choose* an element out of each set. \n\nOf course this collection could be too numerous for this choice to reflect any kind of mechanical intuition of the physical act of choosing and picking, so it would not make sense to actually build a machine to carry out such a choice. In that sense the consequences of the axiom may seem paradoxical, as they may contradict a certain intuitive physical model of mathematical objects. \n\nNevertheless, this axiom is needed for some very basic conceptual reasons. Here is an example:\n\nSuppose we have non-empty sets A and B. Then the *direct product* A x B is the set whose elements are pairs (a,b), with a in A, and b in B. For example, if A = {1, 2, 3} and B={9, 10}, then (3, 9) is an element of A x B. In fact we have\n\nA x B = { (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 9), (3, 10) }.\n\nWe could do this for three sets A, B, C instead of two, and we would get a set A x B x C whose elements consist of triples (a, b, c). We could indeed make such a definition for any number of sets. In fact given any collection of sets A_i, indexed by i in some indexing family I, then we could define the simultaneous direct product of all of them. Its elements would be indexed families (a_i) of elements, with each a_i an element of the set A_i. The Axiom of Choice simply says if the A_i are non-empty, then this direct product is also non-empty: it has at least one element.\n\nWe require the Axiom of Choice to be able to talk about direct products in a uniform way without worrying about how large the indexing set I can be. Without the Axiom of Choice, many proofs in mathematics would need to be modified to avoid talking about such large direct products. Often one can avoid using this axiom with some technical acrobatics at the cost of great loss of conceptual clarity.\n\nOf course one may want to also consider systems of axioms without the Axiom of Choice, if one has in mind models which require more explicit constructions of the objects considered. By far most mathematicians don't require the possibility of such constructions for every object they consider, and so they are content to work in ZFC, the standard system that includes Choice.\n\nIf one wants to get philosophical about the nature of *existence* there is always something to argue about. One may debate the meaning of the word and have opinions about what exists and what does not, but this is assuredly not mathematics. \n\nObviously, the existence of infinite sets is not a new concept in mathematics. The set of all natural numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, ... } does not exist in the same sense as the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} does.  The existence of the former is more potential than concrete. For most purposes however, the distinction is irrelevant.\n\nIt is in fact a very common mathematical technique to entertain the existence of objects that are at first paradoxical, violating intuition, but which have conceptual benefits. Early examples are the number 0, negative numbers, and complex numbers. At various points we have enlarged the collection we admit as acceptable mathematical objects, numbers in this case. This allows us a larger space of possibilities in which to make mathematical maneuvers, and often it lets us deduce things about the original smaller set of objects. \n\nThere have always been people who object to a new piece of mathematics because the theory ceases to describe a certain model they have in mind. They often take the view that mathematics must describe a particular absolute existence. Any resulting controversy is in the end either about philosophy and the notion of existence, or it's a power struggle over who gets to decide what others should be allowed to think about. Neither of these concerns are mathematical.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416543309", "subreddit": "math", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

[**Move notation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Move_notation) of article  [**Rubik's Cube**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's%20Cube): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Many 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by [David Singmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Singmaster) to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \"Singmaster notation\".  Its relative nature allows [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *F* (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n\n&gt;* *B* (Back): the side opposite the front\n\n&gt;* *U* (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n\n&gt;* *D* (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube\n\n&gt;* *L* (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n\n&gt;* *R* (Right): the side directly to the right of the front\n\n&gt;* *ƒ* (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *b* (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *u* (Up two layers) : the top side and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *d* (Down two layers) : the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *l* (Left two layers) : the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *r* (Right two layers) : the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n\n&gt;* *x* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *R*\n\n&gt;* *y* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *U*\n\n&gt;* *z* (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on *F*\n\n&gt;When a [prime symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol\\)) ( ′ ) follows a letter, it denotes a face turn counter-clockwise, while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. A letter followed by a 2 (occasionally a superscript ^2) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. *R* is right side clockwise, but *R'* is right side counter-clockwise. The letters *x*, *y*, and *z* are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When *x*, *y* or *z* are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees.\n\n&gt;The most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \"w\", for \"wide\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of *Rw* is equivalent to one of *r*. \n\n&gt;For methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods) there is a generally accepted \"MES\" extension to the notation where letters *M*, *E*, and *S* denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm. \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *M* (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)\n\n&gt;* *E* (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)\n\n&gt;* *S* (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F\n\n&gt;The 4×4×4 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (*F B U D L R*) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (*f b u d l r*) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parenthesis (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (*Rr*)' *l*2 *f*' means to turn the two rightmost layers counterclockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer counterclockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.\n\n&gt;An alternative notation, [Wolstenholme notation](http://www.topaccolades.com/notation/rubikscube.htm), is designed to make memorizing sequences of moves easier for novices. This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants. The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A and I for clockwise, counterclockwise and 180-degree turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU′R′UL′U′RU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Rubik's ^Cube ^group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_group) ^| [^Optimal ^solutions ^for ^Rubik's ^Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_solutions_for_Rubik%27s_Cube) ^| [^Layer ^by ^Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_by_Layer) ^| [^Impossiball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossiball) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cm90cov) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cm90cov)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416585175", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, so... There really isn't a way for me to give you a \"quick overview\" of the classes.  Each class has so many abilities it would be impossible without me listing every ability of every class.\n\nThat being said, here is probably the most important ability (or maybe two abilities) to watch out for when fighting another class.\n\n**Warriors:**\n\nIntimidating Shout - fears you\n\nShield Wall (Wars with shields only, so if you see a warrior switch weapons, get ready for them to pop this) - reduces damage taken by a lot, switch targets\n\n**Paladins:**\n\nDivine Shield - switch targets (you know this one)\n\nAvenging Wrath - RUN!  Short damage increase buff, better to run and let the buff wear off.\n\n**Hunter:**\n\nFeign Death - KEEP ATTACKING!  Just because they're laying on the ground doesn't mean their dead.  You will lose target of them for a second, but find them again and keep attacking.\nA hunter will try to kite you, so keep Seal of Justice on to stop them from running.  Spam Emancipate!\n\n**Rogue:**\n\nVanish - They will vanish and go invisible.  Try to guess where they are running and stay on top of them till they're dead.\n\nCloak of Shadows - 90% magic resist, just wait till it wears off, but always stay on top a rogue so they don't get away.  Just auto-attack until this wears off.\n\n**Priest:**\n\nMass Dispel - Will remove your Bubble if they're glyphed into it, which any self respecting priest would be.\n\nPsychic Scream - Another fear.\n\n**Death Knight:**\n\nAnti-Magic Shell - absorbs 75% of all magic damage.  You don't necessarily have to switch targets, but keep in mind this will stop a lot of your holy damage.\n\nArmy of the Dead - summons a bunch of minions, just ignore the minions and find the DK and kill him.\n\n**Shaman:**\n\nCapacitor Totem - An air totem (blue) that charges for 5 seconds and stuns all enemies around the totem.  Just watch for them to drop the totem and either kill their totems or run!\n\nEarthbind Totem - slows you\n\nJust generally destroy a shaman's totems whenever he/she drops them.  This is one of their main sources of power and deleting totems will significantly decrease a shaman's usefulness and survivability.\n\n**Mage:**\n\nIce Block - stops all damage, switch targets\n\nInvisible - they can go invisible, try to stay on top of them like the rogue.  This doesn't last forever though, so keep a sharp eye out and pick them up when the invis ends.\n\n**Warlock:**\n\nPets - their pets do various things (cc, dispel, etc.), better to murder them quickly if you're in a 1v1 situation.\n\nFear - they can fear you for up to 8 seconds I think, this sucks.\n\n**Druid:**\n\nCyclone - makes you immune, but you can't cast.\n\nRejuvenation - a powerful HoT (healing over time) spell\n\nBear Form Bash - they can stun you in bear form, and I think cat form but it's a different spell\n\n**Monks:**\n\nFists of Fury - 4 second stun\n\nSparring - they can parry attacks from the front.  30 sec CD\n\nRoll - they roll away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**General PVP Tips:**\n\nRebind your A and D keys to Strafe.  You don't need to be able to turn using the keyboard.  That's what your mouse is for.\n\nBind Q and E to spells, have as many binds as you can.  I bind Z X C V G Q E R T Y to spells.  Learn these binds, make them muscle memory, you should be able to play with your interface hidden (alt+Z).  Shift+any/of/these/keys are also great binds.\n\nGo to the Targeting section, and rebind Tab to \"target next enemy player\" instead of \"target next enemy,\" this way you're not always picking up stupid pets.\n\n[http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/retribution-paladin-pve-dps-macros-addons](http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/retribution-paladin-pve-dps-macros-addons) is a great place to get macros and add-ons.  In particular, the \"Mouse-over\" cast macros are hugely important.  You can cast a spell without switching a target.\n\n/focus - learn to focus a target, and then set up focus cast macros, like cast Hammer of Justice on my focus target (more useful for arena) so that you can stun the healer without having to switch targets\n\nThe less you have to switch targets the better!!!\n\nOBJECTIVES!!!! are way more important that just doing damage or healing in any BG.  Objectives win games, always always always prioritize objectives.  You get WAY more honor for winning that for a few measly kills.\n\nDuel, a lot!  This is the best way to practice.  For added pressure, bet gold on duels.\n\nAlmost every class has an interrupt now, so this should be your strategy whenever you need to cast flash of light; start casting, hit esc real quick.

In other words, you alternate refreshing layers. If you layer two 720p screens, offset by the pixel gap, then drive each at 60Hz \"refreshed at staggered intervals\", now you've got an effective spatiotemporal resoution of 1440p@120Hz.\n\nAt Oculus Connect, John Carmack talked about doing this on a single display using the old-school method of interlacing (alternating scanlines), i.e. refreshing O lines one frame and X lines the next:  \n\n     O O O O O O O O O O O O\n     X X X X X X X X X X X X\n     O O O O O O O O O O O O\n     X X X X X X X X X X X X\n     O O O O O O O O O O O O\n     X X X X X X X X X X X X\n\nThe article suggests alternating between pixels of two panels that are \"interweaved\" at the hardware level (i.e. pixels of panel X peak through gaps between pixels of panel O):  \n\n     O O O O O O O O O O O O\n     OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX\n     OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX\n     OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX\n     OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX\n     OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX\n      X X X X X X X X X X X X\n\n\n\nIf you update X and O at the same time, you get double the resolution of either panel on its own. If you alternate updating X and O, you *still* get double the resolution for half the work.\n\nYou can certainly see traditional interlacing.

{"body": "It wasn't the most mature stage we ever made, but my friends an I had fun in a dick-shaped custom level. The shaft had two elevators that led to the top, and the balls were a \"safe zone\" where we could beat the shit out of each other. Basically, the only way to win was to hurt someone so bad they ricocheted all the way up the shaft. Players usually went 600% to 700% before this happened. The top of the balls were donut blocks, so when items fell on them, it would cause an opening in the \"safe zone\".\n\nAfter awhile, we found we just liked this set up because it was a sort-of \"cage match\". The layout was something like this:\n \n            B     B      \n          B         B    \n            B E   B      \n            B |   B      \n            B | ^ B      \n            B v | B      \n            B   | B      \n      B D D B   E B D D B\n    B                     B\n    B B       B B       B B\n      B B B B B B B B B B\n\nB = Block\n\nD = Donut block\n\nE = Elevator\n\nThe \"hooks\" built into the shaft made it a lot more challenging. Like, the two at the head were a saving grace; if you got caught in them while bouncing up, you were saved, unless you had so much momentum that you bounced out. Likewise, the little dips at the bottom of the balls caused people to spend a lot of force ricocheting back and force. Besides that, if you were at the top, you could pop out and activate the donut blocks, putting everyone in danger.\n\nHonestly, the design turned out to be brilliant.

They had some clutch kills, and what really impressed me was their flexibility. Rather than constantly attempting to flip the spawns, they realized when the attempt was futile and immediately switched strategies to flooding hill. The only thing that worried me today within their HP game was their rotations; OG seemed to constantly be having to break hills due to late rotations.*\n\n*The CTF, however, was heartbreaking. Prior to OT, there were a couple of flag pulls where OG could've played slower and cleared out various areas of the map, but it was mostly fine. In the second half of OT, however, OG was just unable to stay alive off of break. They immediately went two down at Pool-side, and Nade was forced to make a play with the flag. This too would've worked, had Denial's flag runner not escaped or if Zooma hadn't warrior-ed Scump for the return.*\n\n*The final map was just useless as OG had yet to play it as a team. Overall, I think Columbus might come down to who is most comfortable with S&amp;D and comes up with the most effective strats, as it is currently the only gametype that will appear twice in a BO5.*\n___\n[](#14info) *Scump will be playing in the 3v3 1nD Tournament with BoZe and Ricky later tonight, but I will be unable to do a recap.

Don't overlook this as a poorly set up guitar will discourage you. \n\nMake sure the stings are light enough to fret without too much discomfort, but heavy enough to move the top. I use 12 gauge on my working guitars and 13's on my practice stuff. What I mean by move the top (if you don't know) is the soundboard. The top of your acoustic is a soundboard. The strings vibrate the board and the vibrations are amplified in the chamber by the board. If you strings are too light it'll take more effort to get the top \"moving\" or vibrating in a way that produces a round tone. \n\nNext, learn 5 chords. C A G E D (learn the G with your pinky on the G and ring on the D, it just sounds better). Practice switching between them, making sure not to lift your fingers off the board more than you need to. In other words, don't let your fingers fly up in the air when you switch chords. Its VITAL that you practice this way from  the very start. I can;t tell you how many guys that have been playing for decades come to me because their poor finger posture has put an artificial cap on their playing. Its hard to get right a a beginner, but 10X as hard to unlearn as a veteran player.

{"body": "Are you playing chord progressions or individual chords? If you're playing chord progressions, the notes you can sing over the chord depend on which chord you're playing in the context of your chord progression. Since you don't know music theory, I'll try to give you a short explanation/example.\n\nThe most common chord progression in pop music is some kind of combination of I, IV, VI-, and V (these are the chords in most pop songs). It's okay if you don't understand the roman numerals, but if you were playing in the key of G, these chords would be equivalent to G major, C major, E minor, and D major. \n\nNow, each of these chords in the key has a \"chord scale\" which is a group of notes from the key of G. In the chord scale, you'll have chord tones and tensions, which are notes you can sing, and avoid notes, which are notes that typically won't sound good if you sing them, though you may get away with them if you use them in passing. Onto the chord scales, if we're playing that progression in G:\n\nG major takes an Ionian chord scale composed of the notes\n\nG A B C D E F# \n\nChord tones: G B D (the ones you've already figured out, the main notes that compose the chord)\n\nTensions: A E F# (short for \"extensions\" of the chord. These notes work because they are a whole step up from a chord tone).\n\nAvoid note: C (this note doesn't usually work because it is only a half-step up from a chord tone (B) so it clashes).\n\n\nC major would take a lydian chord scale composed of the notes\n\nC D E F# G A B\n\nChord tones: C E G\n\nTensions: D F# A B\n\nNo avoid notes.\n\n\nE minor would take an Aeolian chord scale composed of \n\nE F# G A B C D \n\nChord tones: E G B \n\nTensions: F# A D \n\nAvoid notes: C\n\n\nD major takes a mixolydian chord scale composed of\n\nD E F# G A B C \n\nChord tones: D F# A \n\nTensions: E B C \n\nAvoid note: G \n\n\nWith this basic info, I think you can figure out which other notes to sing over other chords you're playing. If you have any question, let me know. Also, if you search for chord scales on the internet, there is a lot of information. I have only given you very very basic stuff assuming you don't know music theory, but there are lots of more explanations and deeper meanings to all of this. \n\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416639405", "subreddit": "singing", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It depends what you mean by \"seeing\". \n\nEven from a human perspective, we do not really 'see' three dimensions. For instance, when you look at a plane, you can see the *whole* plane.

You just assume it's there. \n\nBut if you assume 'seeing' as 'understanding', there is no problem with that. Computer programs deal with many dimensions all the time. For instance, if you consider a point, it can have several dimensions. A 3D point has `x y z` but you can add anything you want. A point with a colour could have coordinates `x y z r g b` (for red, green and blue), and it would be a point in six dimensions. Those dimensions do not influence each other. Many algorithms consider attributes of objects as separated dimensions, as soon as they are continuous and you can modify one without modifying another.\n\nIt would probably possible for an AI to discover new dimensions in our universe as well, but it's more perceiving than seeing.

This, however, has little to no significance; the greatest impact it can have is OG possibly dropping to 3rd in the pro point standings if JusTus wins in the finals. The true factor for seeding is in tomorrow's 10K. Below, I have my own personal reaction to the 2K, particularly their match against FaZe.*\n\n* *I'm not worried about the HP; Aches, who was host, dropped 56 and Apathy and Censor live much closer to him than the OG guys do.*\n\n* *The S&amp;D was a bit frustrating, considering how many rounds were choked. Overall, much of it was just bad timing. They clutched up in the Ascend CTF, capping the game-winning flag with less than 15 seconds remaining. The sole flaw I saw in their gameplay on that map was how slow they played in a stalemate at the end of the first half. With the ridiculous amount of lanes that there are on that map, sneaking for a return is the smarter play, in my opinion.* \n\n* *The Uplink was extremely close. OG put themselves in a hole early in the second half, because of attempted sneaks. They eventually tied the score up at 8, but were juked by Apathy for a last-second score.

{"body": "&gt; This is because if the Factory their working with has quality control then it applies to all their compounds, I know some here are under the misconception that Factories are some how able to produce some compounds at some points of the year and not others but its simply not the case.\n\nWhile I do agree with you that quality control applies to all compounds. This also applies to tren and anavar. Although anavar is not as expensive as fluoxymesterone, it is still one, if not the most faked compounds their is. Weather that be because the distributor is ripping us off or the factory is ripping the distributor off, it is still commonly faked and harder to synthesize.\n\n&gt; 4 Companies, LMR, QR, CR and Ganabol the main competitors in the Industry each with a 1g sample of the SAME compound and no mention of the test when ordering from them. Label them A B C D and do NOT tell the tester which is which or anyone else for that matter and after the testing comes back reveal all.\n\nAssuming you do not homebrew the cost of just 1 gram of fluoxymesterone ranges from $35-$55. So your are paying roughly $100 for 1g and shipping per distributor. And that is if they even let you order just one gram, which I highly doubt. So you're in $400 at this point. Pay for testing and your at roughly $700. By all means if you have the funds to do that please let me know and I will get you in contact with the tester. Otherwise, we will be testing anavar and the more expensive compound.\n\n&gt; Actually, here is a solution to the entire thing. Automatic melting point testing:-\n\nYeah that would be nice if it wasn't $8,000. But again, by all means if you have the money please go ahead and buy it and help out the thread.\n\n\n\nI am not trying to be a dick, but you have to understand, this isn't something that you can just do. There is no safe way to go about this. Ordering 1 gram from a distributor is pretty obvious something is going to be getting tested. Also, many people here don't use fluoxymesterone. They use anavar and tren and as far as I am concered, I want to make sure those are legit as they are the most often faked/bunk right now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416682528", "subreddit": "Steroidsourcetalk", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not sure if you have that right... Streetcars were originally mixed in with traffic, both pedestrian and automobile. \n\nChicago, 1910: http://www.lib.niu.edu/2001/iht9101258a.jpg \nTwin Cities: http://youtu.be/ectN2KTwMSM?t=2m30s \n\nFor Atlanta, I'm sure it's a bit of a right of way and a budget constraint. On the scale they want the ATL Streetcar (along the BeltLine corridor and beyond), it wouldn't be feasible to have an entirely separate transportation infrastructure through downtown. It's actually hard enough just to carve out what space they have in the street given the dense power lines, cable, water, all the utilities needed to fuel downtown. \n\nI saw a similar segregated rail in San Diego, and from an urban perspective, it doesn't make for a vibrant pedestrian experience. The parts of their line that were integrated with traffic weren't as noticeable. You need to keep it integrated when you A) have relatively narrow streets B) the desire to have a project actually completed on a sustainable, workable timeline and C) want to preserve the sense of place and scale of a walkable, historic place (ie not widen roads and have expensive mechanical shit all over your streets)\n\nCheck this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trams_in_Vienna  When I was there, there were very few cars on the streets in Vienna. People park and ride and walk in the dense part of town. \n\nWe sure are shit aren't Vienna. But for ATL, we keep our pedestrian life, we have this streetcar option for people sans auto... It'll work. It'll expand. And our town's idiot drivers, who we all wish would learn s o m e t h i n g, will learn or be hit. That is nothing new. It's happened since the dawn of the streetcar. So much so that you can google street cars and see some have triangular features or scoops on their fronts so that cows or people fall into that instead of being smished. \n\nHere's more stuff. good stuff. context: I should have just said this- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYcx3n4Xq8 ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416714604", "subreddit": "Atlanta", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The other replies in this thread have made some great points, but no one has mentioned the fact that typically a modulation from relative major to minor will actually be to the harmonic minor rather than the natural minor. Meaning that the 7th scale degree is raised to make the V chord major and the vii a diminished chord. Meaning that in the case of C major vs. A minor, C Major will go C D E F G A B and A Minor will go A B C D E F G#. The harmonic minor is used a lot for rhythm playing as it really lends to strong V-i cadences that will give a more definitive minory sound. As for lead work the harmonic minor will sort of give you a middle eastern feel which can be fun, and when used correctly, very metal, but if you're looking for really beautiful, rounded minor lead work try the melodic minor scale which ascending is the natural minor with a raised 6th and 7th scale degree, meaning A B C D E F# G#, but descending is the natural minor, meaning A G F E D C B. Solos and leads in melodic minor can be really tricky but can sound very full and more complex than they actually are. \n\nHope that is helpful and not hindering, at any rate. trust your ears more than the theory.\n\nTl;Dr- Modulations from relative major to minor will typically raise the seventh scale degree, at least.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416730538", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You sound *exactly* like me and the experience I went through getting my degree, so I'll try to tell you the same things I would have told my younger self, if I could, and in the end helped me to get it together and finish my degree.\n\n* Your goal is *to get a good grade*. That's the alpha and omega, that's what's left when you're done with the semester. I know, it sucks horribly. You love math and you love getting lost in some problem and studying it on your own, and *understanding* what you're being taught and all the subtle implications and all that, but in the end they're going to seat you in front of a table and give you a piece of paper, and grade what you write on that paper using a number, and that number is what matters in the end. You can gain a superb theoretical understanding of 50% of the course material, or 100% for that matter, but unless you can solve that exam, no one will f'n care.\nOf course it's important to actually learn and understand what you're doing, and it's the best and most enjoyable part and kind of why you went into this in the first place, but you need to be judicious with what you pour your comprehension efforts into. There is simply *not enough time* to really sit down and t h o r o u g h l y understand everything. Everyone else isn't smarter than you, they're just more eager to shrug and memorize. Understand what you can, because of course it's better than to memorize; but if some fact defies understanding, and you suspect it can be distilled into a \"bottom line\" that can be retrieved from memory during the test and just used without any insight as to why it's true, go ahead and memorize. *If you have time later* you can backtrack and try to understand it better. There's always going to be *that one theorem* that, if you allow it, will take up two whole weeks of your time to finally understand properly, and the understanding of which will have marginal, if any, contribution to your ability to perform well on the test.\n\n* Practice makes perfect. When you go into a test you don't have the privilege of soaking in everything for the first time, taking in all the novelty, toying with things in your head to get an idea of what's going on. You may end up forced to do this with some elements of the problems you're being given, but by god, it is not something you *want* to do. Of course, questions on the test may have novel elements that weren't in any of the HW or previous exams and so on, and nothing will prepare you for those. This is exactly why you want to spend your time in the test making sense of *them* and not something that was in HW1 and you could have skipped past in 5 seconds if you had done HW1. Do you want to be given 3 linear equations to solve and spend 10 minute soaking in the concept of a linear equation and how it works? No. No, you don't. When you go into the exam you want everything to be familiar - the more familiar, the better. You want to have been there and to have done that.\nWhich is why you should *solve exams from previous years*. HWs are also helpful and may end up being crucial, but exams from previous years are the \"big fish\", they make all the difference, especially(!) if they're by the same professor. During the last stretch, 2 weeks before the exam or so, find previous exams and start solving them, to get a taste for what you're even going into. Solve it. Solve as many as you can. If you're stuck, try for 30 minutes or so and then ask for help. Keep moving forward.\n\n* Aim to be familiar with the whole of the course material as early as possible. A theoretical understanding of the material is *necessary*, but not *sufficient*. The experience solving the type of question you'll be asked is what'll ultimately be sufficient. But you won't be able to properly internalize the questions, the answers and the explanation if everything is new to you and you just met all those concepts for the first time last week. Familiarity with all the concepts and their relations is *crucial* to make best of your \"last stretch\", solving-questions phase. The more time you've spent becoming familiar with them, and the earlier, the better.\n\nThe path to success is not to \"go to class, review notes after lecture, go to office hours\" and check off the to-do list of every chore that might possibly help you. Of course it would be amazing if you had enough time and/or motivation to do everything you possibly could to succeed - but you don't, and that's OK, you're human. The idea is to find the few things that are actually *effective* in getting you ready for the exam, and invest your (finite, valuable) time in doing those things.\n\nOf course, while all of this was good advice for me, it might be horrible advice for you.

{"body": "There are two English pronunciation rules going on here: \n1) all vowels except for \"ee\" and \"oh\" are pronounced as \"uh\" (the fancy linguistics ten for this sounds is \"schwa\" fyi) in unstressed syllables (e.g. record \"REH-kuhrd\" vs \"ruh-KORD\", atom \"A-tuhm\" vs atomic \"uh-TAW-muhk\")\n\n2) \"uh\" in undressed syllables is often pronounced as \"ih\", especially in American English, especially west of the Rockies, and especially next to or between the sounds: t d l r n s z sh ch and j. There are really interesting reasons that those sounds trigger the change and not other sounds, but basically it's because to make those sounds you have to have your tongue closer to the \"ih\" sound than to the \"uh\" sound. \n\nSo because the -land suffix is always undressed (very few suffixes attract stress in English) and comes between an l and an n, it will be pronounced as \"lind\". \n\ntl;dr: English just works that way, and it's not just that one suffix\n\nSource: I'm a PhD.

{"body": "And you are incredibly ignorant and a conspiracy skeptic if you think that, as someone who has worked for just as many years in retail in the past I can confirm that the vast majority of items on sale are not \"inflated over the last month\" but in fact items that mostly fall into one of the three catagories:\n\n1. they either have sat in inventory not selling for ages (For instance gamestop selling the vita memory sticks for 19.99/16Gb just to get rid of the fuckers instead of the usual 35.99-59.99 which has been their price for years).  These items are usually never sold and so they use them as \"door busters\" to lure in potential customers.  Often these are incredibly dirt cheap because otherwise they have to throw them away or return to factory for a lot less then they would have gotten at the price they are listing.  These are almost always losers for the company.\n\n2. Like some Walmart sales selling large TV's and laptops that are sometimes inflated but in the end the sale is still a few bucks off the original uninflated prices (89.99 from an inflated 199.99 is still cheaper then a probably 99.99-149.99 price).  These items never last, and are almost always the first to go by people that stood in line for hours to get them (These are the items we give tickets out for on average, because we KNOW they will sell out instantly).\n\n3. Places like staples putting old sku's on sale to get them out of the warehouse (Often the case on their chairs, desks and laptops).  These items can or can not be losers for the company, but they are replacing the shelf space with other items so they HAVE to be removed no matter what the cost.  These are the items that are usually low on stock even for those waiting in line.  You will N E V E R find these by mid January for a very good reason, they no longer exist in inventory more often then not.\n\nAnything that happens to not be sold during black friday or christmas sales are more often then not returned to the factory or put back on sale again often in clearance which is what you are mentioning as mid January sales, but it is very rare if not impossible to find these specific items on sale mid January because these sales do their job, their almost fully out of stock by then and you are more likely to get screwed over for waiting then getting them cheaper.\n\nIf you want something ultra specific with no alternatives or generics like a Vita memory card, you will NOT find it mid January if its on sale during black friday, because inventory will be so incredibly low they will have to restock, and by then they will not be selling it cheaper unless its out of their inventory in which case the rare few left might sell...but Gamestop is not going to stop selling vita products so you HAVE to get it on black friday if you want it that cheap without clearance hunting.\n\nYou have never worked a big retail store as you have claimed, because it is incredibly rare to find the same laptops, TV's or other electronics that were on sale during black friday because all of the \"dumb fucks\" you mention bought them all up already.  Obscure things or things people really dont care about might make it through the sale, but its a lot less common they dont.\n\nHonestly if you are going to open your stupid mouth on matters that you know nothing about please do it elsewhere, not on a public forum.

Player is not allowed to manually equip blueshirts - they are created and equipped automatically. Related Foundry upgrades still apply.\n\n4.

{"body": "Welcome to our fair city! \n\nSurfaceThought has most of it covered, but I'll offer a few tidbits: \n\nMost of the year, you can ride your bicycle pretty much anywhere within a 2-miles radius of Old Town and CSU faster than you can travel in a car or on the bus.\n  \nAlso, bikes, breweries and the outdoors are a huge part of the culture here, so even if you're not into those things yet, prepare to be assimilated. There are SO many things to do and people to meet, it can get a bit overwhelming. Boating, tubing, hiking, bicycling, guns, climbing, disc golf, running, etc...all within 20 minutes.\n\nIf you're a drinker and like the social / bar scene, it is critical to your survival that you familiarize yourself with taxi, MAX, bus, and bicycle options to get home. There are four different police agencies with overlapping jurisdiction in the Fort, and the amount of DUI enforcement conducted here is **significant**. CSU Police, State Patrol and Larimer County Sheriff's Office all have county-wide jurisdiction, and Fort Collins Police within the city limits. All four agencies run dedicated DUI enforcement officers, and they are e v e r y w h e r e. Drive safely and sober, you'll be good to do.\n\nFOOD! There is a huge diversity in restaurants, with tons of different options, some open until 3 or 4 in the morning. Regardless of your tastes, there's seemingly something for everyone. Some of my favorites are Tasty Harmony, 415, Lucilles, Krazy Karl's, Choice City, Sri Thai, Big City, LaLuz, Snooze, Publick House, Hog Wild, etc...\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, happy to help!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416857804", "subreddit": "FortCollins", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This post really needs to be higher up. Melee 2.0 essentially made mashing E way more prominent, half the combos in the game are literally E E E E E E E with sometimes pauses in between and direction inputs but it still barely has any variation. At least with the old system you could time your 'charge' attacks while moving so that you could land your strike by the time you reached an enemy. This was much more rewarding to a player and actually engaged the player better since they had to think about timing and their distance to the enemy.\n\n\nNow players are essentially just mashing E as fast as they can which is just plain 'hack n slash' (prove me wrong). Pause combos are terribly implemented, especially with the fact that attack speed mods like fury/berserker shorten that pause window which ends up messing with the player's timing windows completely. I'll never understand how people still think this system is less mindless than the old system.\n\n\nThe only reason people disliked melee 1.0 was because everybody ONLY used charge attacks and chose heavy weapons every single time. This wouldn't have been such a problem if charge dmg wasn't so much significantly higher than normal attacks along with the fact that the charge time, swing time and charge dmg itself could be improved even further with mods. Now it is the complete opposite where players choose light weapons over heavy weapons with builds soley based around pure damage over channelling mods. Heavy weapons base dmg was buffed yes but that doesn't solve anything in relation to melee 2.0. All they really needed to do was buff the channelling multiplier to make them viable again.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416894121", "subreddit": "Warframe", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\n\n\nVoid Wars is a StarCraft 2 modification focusing on a further diversified game play experience. A revamped economy system, which gets players out into the map and away from home bases, creates new game play strategies centered on simultaneous micro battles all over the map. Numerous units no longer require gas for production and a players choice in terms of the ratio of minerals vs gas to be harvested also creates more dynamic unit composition options.\n\n\n\nWebsite: www.glhfgg.com\n\n\n\n1) What region do you play in?\nUSA.\n\n2) What time zone are you, and what hours are you available?\nCentral, most of the time.\n\n3) What are some methods of contact(msn, skype, AIM, etc..)?\nSkype, Facebook, and email\n\n4) What are you doing for this project?\nDesigner and will be able to do a fair share of the coding. Mostly need help to get the economy system stuff going and I'll largely be able to take it from there.\n\n5) What roles do you need filled?\nStarcraft 2 map making/scripting is all.\n\n6) What do you have done on the map up to this point? Please try to include images or videos.\nNone. I have been modding other games for years, need that intro nudge to get around the first corners and things will flow from there.\n\n7) A description of the project/team itself so people know what they're getting into.\nRead Below.\n\n8) How much time are you willing to invest in this project per week?\nNumerous hours. I do not think this project will require more than a week or 2 out of another coder where I would have consistant tasks, then maybe a few tasks here and there till completion a month or 2 later. \n\nGeneral Game Play Modifications\n\n\n\nThe gas cost for StarCraft units is going to be changed. Low tech units will cost no gas and higher tech units will cost a lot of gas. This will diversify and make more extreme the unit combos and unit ratios in the game.\n\nDefense Structures are stronger in general. Each player starts with default defense structures near their starting point. Probably use the Point Defense Drone for Terran game start defense structures.\n\nGive to additional spell casters the Time Warp spell. 2 types of Time Warp style spells: One that slows movement and another that slows movement and slows the rate of fire to 2/3 of original rate. Spell caster units to be determined.\n\nAdd time warp counter spell to remove the Time Warp spell. Like EMP would do it and some other spells (not decided yet). Possibly give the EMP ability to a Zerg and a Protoss caster unit.\n\nSupply Depots, Pylons and Overlords to offer 2x supply count.\n\nNumerous tier 1 upgrades do not cost gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerran Specific Modifications\n\n\nMarines, Marauders and Reapers will cost no gas but Ghosts will still cost gas.\n\nSiege tank mode cannon fire will be like throwing a Widow Mine attack at the enemy and will cost more. Add slow spell area of effect to Siege tank round.\n\nThor is slightly slower, stronger, higher damage output with a quicker rate of fire. Anti-Air area of effect weapon to apply a slow spell to enemy units.\n\nMake Ghosts and/or BC's a detector unit?\n\nThe Armory will require a Supply Depot as a prerequisite and the Factory will require the Armory as a prerequisite.\n\nBC and Thor to require Fusion Core.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtoss Specific Modifications\n\n\nZealots, Stalkers and Sentries will cost no gas but Templars will still cost a lot of gas.\n\nAdd Protoss teleportation to Warpgates. Think of each Warpgate as functioning like a Nydus Worm. Make Gateways/Warpgates lower in hit points and make the upgrade to Warpgate cost Minerals and Gas.\n\nZealots are 2x cost, attack 2x faster and move slightly more quickly at game start.\n\nUpgrade at Twilight Council to increase the sheild hit points of Zealots.\n\nAn upgrade as a prerequisite to building the Stargate can be researched at the Cybernetics Core.\n\nAn upgrade as a prerequisite to building a Robotics Facility can be researched at the cybernetics core.\n\nPylon Defense Shield - Pylons to offer shield armor for units within service radius like what the sentry offers, consider including the graphic for this. Other options are having the field appear when a Pylon is selected or having the field only go active when a unit is within its radius and the unit is being attacked.\n\nThe Colossus moves slower, does more damage, fires more quickly, adds a slow spell from its attack and is more costly.\n\nNo limit to Mother Ship Core or Mother Ship unit count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZerg Specific Modifications\n\n\nHydra and Roach require no gas but Banelings will still require gas to be morphed.\n\nUltralisk attack to add an area of effect slow spell onto enemy units.\n\nMay have to make Hydra a tier 1.5 unit due to the impact that the economy system will have on game play.\n\nQueen to move off-Creep without speed nurf (just like any other Zerg unit).\n\nTier 3 upgrade at the Hydralisk Den to again increase the range of Hyrdas.\n\nBuild Time for Lair and Hive is doubled.\n\nBuild Time for Spire is doubled.\n\nMake Zerg air units only produceable from larva that are produced from a Spire.\n\nZergling speed upgrade costs no Gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomy System\n\n\nSupply Line\n\nA Supply Line brings Minerals and/or Gas from the edge of the map to a Command Structure (Command Center, Nexus or Hatchery) that is placed in a Supply Zone location.\n\nSupply Zone\n\nThe location that a Command Structure must be placed to receive resources from a Supply Line.\n\nControl Point and Control Points\n\nA circle of power along with a turret can be captured by occupying the circle of power with a friendly unit. This gives the player \"Control Points\" as a resource. Control Points regulate the rate that worker units enter the map with resources. Each Supply Line can reach a max rate of workers. The circle of power holds a specific unit to it so the player cant move the unit off the control point by accident. The defense structure next to the circle of power will have a button to deactivate the held unit function and another to switch out the circle of power holding unit.\n\nExample.\n\nA player has 3 Control Point locations occupied. Each control point location offers 5 control points for a total of 15 Control Points as a resource for the player. The player has 1 Supply Line running which requires 15 Control Points to run at maximum rate. Each Command Structure offers 5 Control Points. Each worker unit then enters the map at the minimum amount of time allowed for a supply line.\n\nThe resource score board would read 20/15 for the Control Points resources. Meaning 5 control points resources are not being used yet and the supply line is running at maximum rate.\n\nNow the player builds a second Command Structure at the Supply Zone of a different Supply Line. This would take an additional 15 Control Points to fully run at max rate so the Control Points score board would read 25/30 (5 for the Command Structure plus the original extra 5). Then what happens is the time between \"all\" workers entering the map would be reduced by the ratio of 25/30 no matter how many workers are on each supply line.\n\nWorkers auto bring supplies to the Command Structure at the Supply Zone and do not have to be purchased. When the player wants the worker unit in the game then the player purchases the unit from any Command Structure. Meaning, the Supply Line workers are never player controlled, but can be killed but will be auto replaced via the time of the next turn for a worker unitto enter the game from a side of the map.\n\nWorkers carry more resources per trip; something like 50 minerals or 50 gas per trip (to be balanced).\n\nThe number of workers per Supply Line can be increased either to bring in 3/2 as many workers bringing Minerals or for 1/3rd of the workers on that Supply Line to bring in Gas.\n\nExample 1.\n\nIf 20 workers per minute are on one Supply Line this would be a worker entering the game every 3 seconds. Upon upgrading the Supply Line to bring in additional Minerals it would go to 30 (the 1/3 increase)workers per minute or if the player upgrades to have the Supply Line to bring in Gas it would then be 20 workers on Minerals and 10 workers on Gas.\n\nExample 2.\n\nFor instance a gamer can make the choice to go all Minerals on their initial Supply Line then on a second Supply Line upgrade the Supply Line to bring in gas, then make a choice about a third Supply Line if they want additional gas or just additional minerals. A Supply Line can be upgraded back and forth also. If a supply line was bringing in only minerals with 30 workers per minute, the player can choose the gas upgrade and switch it to 20 on minerals and 10 on gas, then again, back to all minerals if desired (each time paying for the upgrade which is not very costly, nor takes much time. Above each Command Structure on a Supply Line visual text should indicate the current functional status of the Supply Line.\n20 Worker units delivering Minerals per minute. (non-upgraded)\n30 Worker units delivering Minerals (After Mineral Upgrade)\n20 Worker units delivering Minerals and 10 Worker units delivering Gas (After Gas Upgrade)\nBut use the Mineral or Gas icon, not the actual word.\n\n\n\nTo participate in the development of this mod please contact me at the email address listed below.\n\n\n\nBy SomniumTheater\nSteelRain on Battle.net\ns t e e l r a i n 4 e v a @ g m a i l . c o m\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1416914553", "subreddit": "GameMods", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

And finally, if you have strong cc, such as Renekotn W, you weave that into your combo to distinguish any retaliation. Of course, this is all in a M v M matchup.

{"body": "I really hope the box system continues, I have never participated in one as of yet, but I love the idea! And I don't want to see it go away. \n\nI like all of the ideas in here, but my favorite are the ones pertaining to box inventory verification. Every box transaction should be forwarded past the curator, in my opinion. Like, if I receive the box, and decide I want to take A B and C, worth $40, and replace it with D, worth $40, I should inform the curator and wait for his OK before mailing. That way, if let's say I decided instead to take A B and C worth $40, and replace it with D E F G and H worth $35, plus some samples, he can decide whether the rarity or the quality of the items is worth the cost cut, or more than likely he would tell me to either add more value, or put everything back the way I found it and forward the box untouched to the next person. \n\nIt's seems like an obvious decision, you wouldn't take more than you put, or fill the value with numerous small low value items, but some people may wrongly think that it is OK, and the curator could stop that before it even happens. \n\nOn a side note, I have one concern I would like to mention, as a new member. On the front page of this subreddit, there needs to be a clearly defined \"rules\" link in the sidebar. I eventually found the rules, through lots of searching, but u was tempted to ask publicly. I didn't, because I felt it was rude and I knew they were somewhere. Others might not feel the same way, and will either clutter the sub with posts asking questions or will be put off and leave. \n\nThat's my second concern, I feel we need a more thorough explanation of how this system works, I had to do a lot of reading to wrap my mind around the fine details that are probably obvious to those who have already participated or have been here awhile. Reading is fine, and encouraged, but again I feel that a better explain will help the newcomer experience ;) \n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, I truly only mean to help, not criticize, I hope that's conveyed here. \nI enjoy the idea of this box sub, and I can't wait till I have my turn!

{"body": " - **What role does she play in a team composition?**\n  \n\n  \nZyras role in a team composition is usually a support however she does excel in mid lane. She's used as a support due to her great poke and high kill potential at level 6. Her role in a team fight is to usually peel for the carry and poke the enemy team down. She can also be used to initiate however that's only if the team is lacking initiation as if she initiates it may not be very safe because she'll need to be pretty close to the enemy team. When she's playing as a support, she is very squishy. Probably one of the squishest supports I've played with. She often falls victim to lanes which have Nami as Nami can heal up all her poke + harass back herself whilst having great CC. Leona also excels against Zyra but only if the Zyra isn't poking enough.\n    \n\n - **What are the core items to be built on her?**\n  \n  \nWhen playing her as support, I build: AP support item, Mobi boots, Sightstone, Liandries, Morellonomicon, Zhonyas/Deathcap/Void Staff. Late game I sell the support item for Zhonya/Deathcap/Voidstaff. Usually void staff if I haven't already got it.    \nI usually stick with Mobis because I love the movement speed. I sometimes get Sorcerers boots instead when I opt to get Twin Shadows. This is when we are often lacking vision and the enemy is often MIA. If our team lacks damage, I usually get Deathcap instead of Zhonyas. I get Zhonyas when their team is heavy AD or have really good all ins for example a Malphite/Amumu/Leona.\n\n  - **What is the order of leveling up her skills?**\n  \n  \nOrder of levelling is usually situational. If invading then I'd go E&gt;W&gt;Q for the first 3 levels. Maxing order would be R&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;W. I often do this with maybe an extra point in E sometimes. If I seem to be landing a lot of my Grasping Roots in lane, I often choose to put another point in it for the increased snare duration. However with Q your poke becomes a huge annoyance. E&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;R is what I often go for in those cases. Even maybe leave one point in Q until level 7. When not invading or if our jungler is starting at another buff, I start W for the vision in their jungle to look out for any potential invades. I then choose to level up Q or E depending on who their and our bot lane is. If they have a strong level 2, I'll level E. If we have a strong level 2, I'll level E again. If it's a not so all in level 2 then I'll choose to max Q and harass them.\n\n  \n - **What are her spikes in terms of items or levels?**\n  \n  \n\nHer power spikes come at level 3 and 6. She gets stronger plants at level 6 when you use your W with your ult. She also does ridiculous amounts of damage when her Q has been maxed. Finishing Liandries is a huge power spike for her because her plants also proc the Liandries on hit effect. \n\n  \n\n - **What champions does she synergize well with?**\n  \n\n  \nZyra goes well with most ADCs. She goes well with ADCs who have good burst, such as Corki. Her W E W Q combo followed buy Corkis burst usually burns a summoner or forces the enemy our of lane. She's also great with ADCs who have good CC such as Ashe/Varus due to the great kill potential at level 6 if both players chain CC correctly. She's also great with Ezreal and Caitlyn due to their poke. Zyras poke + the poke of Ez/Cait will leave your enemy usually on low health as all of them can poke safely under tower too.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417008883", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The metric stress question has been quite fully answered, so let's just talk about the vowel system in general.\n\nWe have the Classical Latin vowels, 5 short and 5 long (plus the *sonus medius* of libet/lubet, but let's just pretend it's not there, for now!): a e i o u ā ē ī ō ū. Vowel length is phonological, e.g. *malum* is different than *mālum*.\n\nWe don't know how Latin speakers actually performed this length distinction. We do know, however, that this difference was described (so perceived) as a difference of time, with long vowels lasting longer.\n\nWe do know, however, that when length distinction disappeared in the course towards Romance languages, the vowels did not simply merged (with the exception of *a* and *ā*). Altough Romance languages underwent further variation, in the reconstructed Protoromance vowel system:\n\n* Latin short vowels became open vowels;\n* Latin longs became closed;\n* open high vowels (short i and u) merged into closed middle (long e and o)\n\nThis led to a 7 vowel system: a, open e, closed e, i, open o, closed o, u; such is still today in Italian.\n\nThe fact that this qualitative distinction is present in all Romance varieties could be a sign that it was ancient, that is, Latin vowels were different both in length and in openness, roughly like in German, but speakers described that difference only with length.\nWhen speakers stopped caring about pronouncing long vowels a bit longer, they kept pronouncing them closed, so we shifted into a qualitative system.\n\nFor instance, let us imagine the history of *pilum*, accusative of pilus \"hair\"\n\n* We start with /ˈpɪlʊm/, with a short (and open) i, contrasting with pīlum /ˈpiːlʊm/ \"javelin\", (with a long and closed i)\n* at some point length distinction does not matter anymore: pilum and pīlum constrast just for openness: /ˈpɪlʊm/ and /ˈpilʊm/.\n* the Romance vowel merger pushes down the short i, so we have /pelo/, the Pan-Romance form for \"hair\". (while *pīlum* gave /pilo/).\n* Romance languages further evolved. Here I mention Italian, because it lengthens stressed vowels in open syllables, thus It. *pelo* is ['pe:lo], with a long vowel descending from a Latin short!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417047006", "subreddit": "latin", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Tonicization is just a mini modulation.  It's where you make a chord the tonic (I chord) for a moment.  It usually involves a secondary dominant, but other than that could almost be called a borrowed chord.\n\n********\n\nAs far as minor keys go, there are three minor key variations commonly used:\n\nNatural minor (sometimes called Aeolian mode): uses only notes that could appear in the relative major.  A minor: A B C D E F G\n\nHarmonic minor: same as natural, but the 7th note is sharped.  A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G#\n\nMelodic minor: sharp the 6th and 7th notes, but flat them again as you come back down the scale.  The jazz version of this scale ignores the reflatting of notes.  A melodic minor: A B C D E F# G# A G F E D C B A\n\nMost classical pieces use melodic minor, and use the sharped 7th to make the V chord major.  It started as borrowing the stronger dominant V chord from major, but at this point it's just the scale that's used in minor classical pieces.  Some folk musics also use this scale/chord.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417060537", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I primarily played her as Support. I used her in S2 before her huge nerfs to her plants and started to pick her up after Spellthief's edge got introduced. I played her on my main from Plat 1 up to Dia 1 (Mofl III EUW) and on my smurf from Gold 3 to Dia 1 (Leto Atreides II TR) with &gt;60% winrate above plat and &gt;75% in plat and gold. I have around 200 games with her this season (2/3 of my games in ranked)\n\n---\n\n- What role does she play in a team composition?\n\nShe plays the role of a control mage with huge amounts of soft cc peel for your adc in lategame. Also her normal itemization offers her the ability to deal huge amounts of dmg to tanky champions. \n\nShe is extremly effective in a teamcomp without another main source of magic dmg (ad mid/top) which allows her to use her flat pen she gets to deal even more dmg. Without the need from other roles to buy MR for the enemy you can either deal nearly most dmg in your team (over time with your poke) or they have to build MR that starves them from gold they could use for better stats otherwise just to counter the support.\n\n\n\n- What are the core items to be built on her?\n\nEgde + 4 pots -&gt; SS -&gt; Frostfang + boots -&gt; \n\nFrom here there are 2 options depending on your gold on back and your need for either more dmg or more peel:\n\n1. more peel: FQC + Sorcerer Boots -&gt; Haunting Guise -&gt; Liandry's Torment\n\n2. more dmg: Haunting Guise -&gt; Sorcerer Boots + Liandry's Torment -&gt; FQC or Rylais (FQC is more efficient against dash/jump champs and Rylais against Bruiser with no/little gapcloser also for better dmg and hp you should get Rylais)\n\n- What is the order of leveling up her skills?\n\nFrom lvl 1 to 7: Q W E Q Q R Q\n\nAfterwards you max Q until you are close to end laning. As soon as teamfights start out and your are not longer in lane poking E is slightly stronger than Q so you should start maxing E as soon as you think your laning phase is close to end. \n\nIn short: R&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;W for laning; R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W for teamfights. \n\n- What are her **spikes** in terms of items or levels?\n\nHer spikes are lvl 2 when you get your plants. This spike doesn't offer you much safety but allows you to deal huge amounts of poke (usually the time to poke as much as possible)\n\nLvl 3 is her safety powerspike. You got E now. Your poke is a little big weaker now and you should tune it down a bit so you have enough mana left on lvl 4 to poke with lvl 2 Q. \n\nlvl 6 is a nice power spike to double the strength of your plants in a fight with your ult and if you get it off fully you can easily kill an adc with a full combo. \n\nThe next power spike is Haunting Guise + Sorcerer Boots where you will have huge amounts of magic pen.\n\nWhen you get up to your Liandry's (usually around 21 min as rush without sorc boots or 24-27 min with other items) you become a beast. You will deal huge amount of dmg in a teamfights and should look to use this power spike to get some neutral objectives that won't destroy your plans (bad towers). I would advise not to tower dive with that power spike because a huge part of your dmg comes from oyur plants at this point and the tower will focus them over minions.\n\n- What champions does she synergize well with?\n\nAdcs with a minimum level of safety on their own. You won't really be able to safe an ashe in lategame against a row of champs due to the fact that most of the peel you offer is slow or snares so corki, graves, lucian, cait with small dashes (also vayne but i hate her early and think it is a waste of zyras early game potential) work great. Your adc should have a midgame power spike so you are able to use your powerspike around 20 min to full potential. \n\nAs for the hole teamcomp I would say as low magic dmg the better. You won't need really any additional peel for your adc if he is a bit mobile so I would prefer more offensive champs in the other roles.\n\n\nFor additional things:\n\nI wrote chain of posts about my way to play her already in this sub: http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/243pzv/ask_a_diamond_bot_lane/ch3dh3s\nand I started a guide with the basic information:\nhttp://www.solomid.net/guide/view/128774-zyra-build-guide-support-by-mofl", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417084351", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, I've had a similar question when I started out. All these people think they're being very smart by repeating \"practice\" but honestly, you aren't helping. Yes, everyone knows you need to practice but do what? Drag a line in Illustrator back and forth a million times? Ignore them.\n\nThe short answer to this question is that no one really knows. A more helpful answer to this question is figure out what the craft is all about. You are in the business of visual communication, which means you need to learn the essentials of visual communication. Having an art background helps hugely, as drawing/painting trains your eye but I'm mildly biased as I have traditional fine arts background.\n\nDon't look at software. Illustrator, InDesign, whatever-next-thing -- they're great for making deadlines. Not good for studying design. You're looking for essentials of visual communication. Basic thing is: a line is never a line, a point is never a point, a rectangle is never a rectangle. They're metaphors. In fact, well.. nevermind. You're looking to study things like visual rhythm, proportion, contrast, laws of Gestals. Essentials of everything you see.\n\nSee this             -    -   - - -    -? This is visual communication Those lines are connected by proximity and visual rhythm.. There is AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SPACE between those lines; I mean look at them with a microscope, you can fit civilizations between those lines. They mean something. But that's semiotics. Google semiotics.\n\nAIGA is a good place to start. If you're wondering, AIGA is a 100-year old design association that has changed the landscape of visual communication forever. I mean these are the guys that know what they're doing. Ivan Chermayeff and Thomas Geismar have received AIGA medal, Jan Tschichold too. Next time you see a Chase logo? AIGA was somewhere around. So now that I've established that, here are the links you need to read:\n\nhttp://www.aiga.org/standards-professional-practice/ -- these are the standards of professional practice, a designer version of Hippocratic oath so to speak. Read them, they're good.\n\nhttp://www.aiga.org/guide-whatisgraphicdesign/ -- what is graphic design? Brief description of visual communication field categories.\n\nhttp://www.aiga.org/guide-designersneedknow/ -- here's the one you wanna really get into.\n\nOne of the most important things you need to know if you want to succeed in the field is typography. Typography is important. Let me rephrase that: t y p o g r a p h y i s i m p o r t a n t. Letters are fucking everywhere. Buy, borrow, find, steal, or somehow get access to these books:\n\nThe New Typography by Jan Tschichold, original in German 1928. Weimar Bauhaus style, need I say more? If you don't know what Bauhaus is, find out. \n\nThe Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst.\n\nGrid Systems in Graphic Design/Raster Systeme Fur Die Visuele Gestaltung by Josef Muller-Brockmann\n\nGo on, my dear friend, and you shall discover a world for yourself that you have not known yet. A jungle of signs. Be courageous and take risks, be patient but want things now, be intelligent but be stupid.

{"body": "I understood what you are trying to show with your diagram, but you seem to not be acknowledging that \"to perform merge sort means that you sort data as you merge them\".\n\nLet me clarify the answer: \"Your server must sort the data while merging.\" This is the only way to get the correct results. **Even if the clients return the results as sorted data, the server must still sort them when merging.**\n\nHere is a small use case to help you understand:\n\nData to sort: q w e r t y u i o p a s d f g h j k l z x c v b n m\n\nNumber of workers: 3\n\nTo make sure the work is balanced, each workers will receive 26 / 3 =  8 items to sort (with one of the workers receiving more than others).\n\n* worker 1 gets: q w e r t y u i\n* worker 2 gets: o p a s d f g h\n* worker 3 gets: j k l z x c v b n m\n\nAfter workers finish sorting, they give back:\n\n* worker 1: e i q r t u w y\n* worker 2: a d f g h o p s\n* worker 3: b c j k l m n v x z\n\nNow, time to merge. As obvious in this case, we cannot just combine the results as they are, otherwise we get:\n\ne i q r t u w y a d f g h o p s b c j k l m n v x z\n\nand it is not the right way of doing merge sort. To merge properly, you need to iterate through the elements and compare then see which element must go in the merged result first (i.e. sorting as you merge):\n\n* worker 1 and 2 merged: a d e f g h i o p q r s t u w y\n* worker 3: b c j k l m n v x z\n\nand then, repeating the same step (which you said you want in recursion), the data must output:\n\n* worker 1 and 2 and 3 merged: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nNow, on my very first feedback, I suggested a possible way of avoiding the sort on server (i.e. just merging by concatenation), if you are interested in visualizing this solution I will show you how it is done.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417236337", "subreddit": "cpp_questions", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm sorry if your feelings were hurt. That wasn't my intention.\n\n&gt;it would have been nice if you just read the thread\n\nI did read the thread, and your explanatory text too. And things are certainly clearer there. But the sub I submitted this to is called /r/titlegore, not /r/threadgore. Again, I'm sorry if this upset you.\n\nI'm glad you found four people who could offer you some comments. But if you'd wanted more technical, historically- and theoretically-informed answers to your query, it would have been better to formulate your question more precisely and clearly.\n\nNow that I understand more of what you were getting at, perhaps I can offer some guidance:\n\n(1) Modern Western pitch-naming derives from a system that has its origins in ancient Greek music theory and was applied in Medieval times (using the labels Γ A B C D E F G a b c d e f g aa bb cc dd ee) to a diatonic system that had no chromatics in it (or chromatics that were only introduced during performance, not in notation). So our modern system of using letters (A B C D E F G) originated when that's all that was needed, nothing in between.\n\n(2) As chromatic pitches made their way into Western music, the easiest way to indicate them was as alterations of the diatonic pitches that were normative at the time. So they would write two kinds of B: a \"hard\" B (which was written like a squared lower-case b, and eventually became our modern natural symbol) and a \"soft\" b (which looks like a regular lower-case b, and eventually became our modern flat symbol). \n\n(3) Probably the earliest example of a unique and equally differentiated label (what I assume you mean by \"serious\") for a pitch outside the original diatonic system is the use of H for our modern B-natural and B for our modern B-flat. This still persists in certain Germanic countries and languages (hence the use of titles like [Fugue in H](http://www.amazon.com/Fugue-Minor-G27-G-Haendel/dp/B0012O7NSU) for a piece in B and [Sinfonie in B](http://www.di-arezzo.co.uk/multimedia/images/barenreiter/couv/ba04695.jpg) for a piece in B-flat. While B and H look unique these days, they still evince their origin as variations of the letter B.\n\n(4) Raised pitches were indicated by an X (and variations on it) as a kind of \"crossing out\" of the diatonic pitch, to be replaced by the chromatic one. This X eventually became our modern sharp symbol, and -- like the flat -- is evidence of the a priori referential status of the diatonic pitches in Western musicians' minds at the time.\n\n(5) The very term \"chromatic\" belies the prejudice that there are normative pitches (A B C D E F G) and colorations of them (like F#). And for hundreds of years, this was a rather accurate representation of the hierarchy between diatonic and chromatic pitches.\n\n(6) With the rise of transposition, specifically moving the tonic to pitches other than C, the diatonic collection of pitches was no longer tied only to the pitches A B C D E F and G. For example, in the key of D major, a C-sharp is diatonic but a C-natural is chromatic. But the letter-name symbology, and even the very structure of the keyboard (on the organ, clavichord, harpsichord, piano, and other similar instruments) remained entrenched in Western musical thought and practice, giving certain pitches a more normative status and making others dependent on them.\n\n(7) Some musicians have developed systems to represent the twelve unique pitch classes (C, C#/Db, D, etc.) with labels devoid of prejudice towards diatonicism. The most widely used is [integer notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class#Integer_notation), in which C is labeled 0, C# or Db is labeled 1, D is labeled 2, and so on. In this way, for example, a whole-tone scale starting on C can be represented as 02468T (with \"T\" for 10) and a whole-tone scale starting on A would be 9E1357 (with \"E\" for 11) -- no \"chromatic\" notation necessary. This is widely used in theoretical writing about non-tonal music (in scholarly books and articles), but as far as I know has never been used successfully as a means of notating music for performance.\n\n(8) When it comes to pitches \"in the cracks\" between the traditional 12 pitch classes (i.e., pitches not on the traditional keyboard), most notational systems still use a normative vs. altered approach, which gives more primal status to 12-tone equal temperament over microtones. [Here's one example](http://www.rpmseattle.com/of_note/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_QT_scale2.png). Would these be examples of classifications you call \"not serious\"? \n\n(9) There have been attempts to label microtones without using staff notation, since staff notation is clearly prejudiced towards diatonicism. [Here's one attempt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class#Other_ways_to_label_pitch_classes), but even that seems to view the 12 equal-tempered pitch classes as normative (0, 1, 2, etc.) and microtones as measured from them (2.4, 5.1, etc.). \n\n(10) There have been scattered attempts at creating non-hierarchical systems, to avoid the very prejudice you've alluded to. Frequency is one method (C=261.1Hz; a quarter tone above that is 269.2654651Hz; and so on). None of these has caught on to any significant extent, mostly because they are so foreign from the systems that Western musicians have been steeped in for their entire musical lives.\n\nHoping this helps!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417292328", "subreddit": "titlegore", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

(there is no set of rules explaining what is necessary it is subjective to you and how you think it sounds) I use a lot of automation on EQ, filter cutoffs, and volume. i tend to feel as though it sounds weird to have one certain element start randomly when you reach the next part of your song...hence i bring it up quietly in the previous part so that when it is fully introduced it doesn't sound so randomly placed there. i also use a lot of sweeps, upfilter fx, and downfilter fx (i.e. white noise that progressively gets louder, but never goes above the loudest element in the song) \nanother more intermediate effect is to take the first note of a synth or vocal and put it into a new file and export it as it is and then put it into your track and reverse it completely. this builds up to the note from nothing and sounds pretty darn swell.\n\ni hope this helps....i should make a video as this is a lot to explain.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417296629", "subreddit": "edmproduction", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Okay... I'll tentatively agree that it's easier for your average woman to get laid than your average man. You still haven't even approached an answer to why women having sex is a bad thing, or something we should assign a moral value to. Plenty of people do plenty of things that are easy, all the freakin' time. There is nothing inherently wrong with doing something simply because it is easy.\n\nA woman having sex is not a bad thing. In fact, it could be a good thing. A wife having sex with her husband is always good.\n\nThat said, slutting it up (i.e. a woman having copious amounts of sex, casually, with multiple men) is bad **if done on a large scale.** In other words, things become bad only when most women embrace casual sex, which is happening today. When this happens, the sanctity of motherhood is threatened, and society begins to crumble because those slutty women do not make good mothers.\n\n&gt;But let's say there is, for the sake of discussion. Okay, women are the gatekeepers of sex, so we shame the ones who are poor gatekeepers. Men are the gatekeepers of commitment, right? Do we shame male serial monogamists? Why or why not?\n\nSociety does not shame male serial monogamists the same way. If you'd like to create a campaign for that in the name of equality, be my guest. Nevertheless, women do find it a turn off when a man is willing to commit too readily. Or, if they don't find it a turn off, they at least label him as beta bux, since that is all he is acting like.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, this argument totally ignores the point made in the OP. Surely you can agree that there exist some men who have an easier time finding sexual partners than some women. Picture a hot, tall, sexy, rich, alpha, dominant, well-dressed, buff dude, then picture a slovenly, hairy, obese, smelly, poorly-dressed woman with a horrible personality **(I'm trying to put this in terms that will resonate with you)**. Do you honestly believe the man here is going to have a more difficult time getting laid than the woman? If we can agree he isn't, doesn't the whole framework fall apart for this set of individuals?\n\nThe bolded part, i.e. the snark, is unnecessary. I agree that in this particular example, the man will have an easier time. I am discussing the norm, not the exceptions.\n\n&gt;I've never met a \"slut\" who felt entitled to a certain category of men, or really anything relationship-wise. Sure, most people hope to find a partner they're happy with. I don't think there are nearly as many women out there as you think there are who would \"freak out\" at the suggestion that they are not owed a certain type of relationship simply for existing.\n\nI currently attend a liberal 4 year university. I've met girls like this. We have different experiences.\n\n&gt;\"A lot of women\" as defined by...? Yourself? Based on what? Personal experience? I won't argue that attractive men probably receive better treatment from both genders (as do attractive women), but it's not nearly as black and white as you make it out to be. \"Creepy\" behavior crops up mainly when someone continues to press themselves/their unwanted advances on an unwilling recipient, so it makes sense that less attractive men would earn the label more often, given that their advances are less likely to be welcome. That said, people across the whole spectrum of looks can be (and are) called creepy when their behavior warrants the term.\n\nScientific studies. The OKCupid study revealed that most women don't find most men attractive at all. Those that are attractive are in the top 20% of looks, statistically speaking. [Source](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/)\n\n&gt;Sooo... many more than 20% of men actually qualify for the top 20%? Or are you admitting that there really is no such thing as a real Top 20%?\n\nNo. There is a such thing as top 20%. But a particular woman's top 20% could be the entirety of the universal top 20%, or 18% of the universal, 2% tailored to her preferences, or 10% of the universal, and 10% tailored to her preferences.\n\nConsider a set of twenty men, labeled A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T. Woman X finds A B C T attractive, but are turned off by D through S. Woman Y finds A B C D attractive, but are turned off by E through S. Woman Z finds A C D S attractive, and the rest unattractive.\n\nIn this hypothetical, X, Y, and Z are all attracted to men A and C, women X, Y *exclusively* are attracted to B, C, women X, Z *exclusively* are attracted to no men in common, and women Y, Z are *exclusively* attracted to man D. \nHopefully, this better illustrates the picture I'm trying to paint. When people on TRP say women \"fuck all the same guys\" we don't mean it so literally.

{"body": "The two big factors are that people naturally \"copy\" how people around them speak, and languages change naturally over time (just compare how you talk compared to your grandparents).\n\nSay we have 10 settlements (A-J) spread along a big long valley and all founded at the same time by people who speak \"Language X\".\n\nA B C D E F G H I J\n\nThe way of speaking in each of them changes over generations and, because they're separate from each other, the changes are different in each. If you travel from A to B, you'll still understand people fine because you're town is close to it, there's a lot of contact and so you're use to their terms. If you go further towards J then the difference becomes more and more pronounced until, by the time you reach J, it becomes very difficult to understand what people are saying.\n\nThen, two kingdoms form: A-D unite with A as the capital, and E-J unite with J as the capital. Because A and J are the centres of government, trade and education, their way of speaking becomes what's called the \"prestige variety\" - it restricts how much the way of speaking in the other towns changes because the people there need to understand their government, and because they want to speak the people in the most important city. This means that D and E, which both used to have similar ways of speaking, start to diverge more as D emulates A and E emulates J.\n\nOnce a country is formed, whatever the prestige variety is is the variety that gets called a language. The dialect spoken in the capital is declared to be the correct one, and all the other ways of speaking across the country just get referred to as \"dialects\" or \"accents\".\n\n\"Language\" is a political thing really, and there's a saying that \"a language is just a dialect with an army\". Portugal was settled by Galician speakers but, when it became it's own kingdom, they took ownership of their way of speaking and made it so that the Galician spoken in Portugal was now called \"Portuguese\". Croatian and Serbian are almost completely mutually intelligible and used to be referred to as being part of the same language when Yugoslavia existed but, since becoming separate states they're considered different.\n\nIt happens the other way around too: the dialects of Basque spoken in the Basque Country are sometimes so different that speakers of one can't understand the other. But, because it's one country (albeit not an independent one) they are all referred to as one language.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417367743", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well. I, too, hate slow pacing, e.g in mangas like Nisekoi(1 or 2 major things happen during last 100 chapters(out of total 150))\n\nI read Onani master too. Enjoyed it. Also enjoyed simular mangas like GE, Ichigo 100, Kimi no iru machi(Read it in ongoing from 200th, i guess), Suzuka. If I read all of the manga that i read ongoing, i would fucking kill myself.\n\nSo the advice is- don't read ongoings. =) It's too painful to find L I T E R A L L Y   N O T H I N G week after week.\n\nAnd there is the other thing - I don't have much entertainment, so i read what i entertain me even a little, even if sometimes it sucks. If i read about 10 or 20 chapters, it often means that I will continue to read it to the end(exceptions are mangas with suuuper slow pacing or pure Slice of Life(i dropped Zetsubou sensei and just read last chapters for the ending because 300+ chapters of SoL is beyond me.) )\n\nTate no yuusha is a LitRPG, i.e. a piece of literature about a world where your life is a game: you have stats, you can level-up, etc. The idea is fresh for me, the MC is real and likeable, main lead is also likeable, there are no OVERCOMINGS (have no idea if there is such word in English, just modified it like in my language. Means a situation where MC overcomes something that her normally can't, while bleeding, dying or whatever ), like in Fate/SN. The pacing is okay, plus it's translated 1 chapter per day, not 1 per week. It doesn't suffer much from \"Grinding\" dicease that strikes almost every litRPG-like piece of work(Mahwa \"Gamer\" is infected, hope it's gonna be okay soon...).\n\nI don't think that something is unique about WNs, it's just that one particular WN caught my attention. I also don't see errors, considering that this WN was apparently written chapter/day (on the site with raws the dates follow). Tate no yuusha also has a LN that's beeing written, but i don't care. WN translation has advanced far further than in LN, so i'll be reading WN.\n\nP.S. https://www.mangaupdates.com/mylist.html?id=417744&amp;list=read\nThis is my manga list. Half of this stuff is just manga that i read if it comes out. Half- manga that i really wait for every week.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417373517", "subreddit": "visualnovels", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't know much about the senses outside of vision, so I'll have to stick to that. The answer here is highly limited parallel processing.\n\nAttention is a very big area of cognitive research, both in psychology and neuroscience, and has dominated large parts of vision research. The whole idea behind attention is that we evolved a system which will reduce the information coming in from our eyes into a much more manageable quantity of information. We can't process everything that we see, and it wouldn't be beneficial to process absolutely everything coming in (all those not-moving things in the corners of the room right now don't need to be processed).\n\nThere is still a lot we don't know about attention. We don't know *what* attention is, really. We know that there are certain stimuli that seem to be preferentially processed (sudden onset bright lights, for example), and we know that if something is relevant to a goal then it is special (ever look for a tomato in the fridge and have your eye caught by every red container?). We don't know what the mechanism is that makes this so.\n\nThe next issue in this is that we don't know *when* attention does its thing. There are a lot of steps from the world hitting your eyes to you making some kind of response to this information. For a long time, there was a debate about whether attention happens early (at visual perception) or late (at response selection). What seems to be the case is that attention is flexible, and will process a lot of stimuli when demands are low, and process less stimuli when demands on the attention system are high (so-called load theory).\n\nSo, what are some actual numbers? In terms of how many things we can attend to at any one time, four is kind of the agreed upon number for [visual working memory](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v390/n6657/abs/390279a0.html). This is the number of items or features (components of items) that you can keep in visual memory and work with. This number will change with the complexity of the individual objects.\n\nThere is also a limit to the rate at which we can process information. This is borne out most clearly in an experimental paradigm known as the [attentional blink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_blink). In these (very dull) experiments, participants view a stream of letters. These appear for very little time, and there is usually little or no time between the letters. The stream could be something as simple as:\n\nV A B T K L H J U V L A\n\nThe participants task would be something as simple as pressing a button every time they see a vowel. Pretty easy. If two vowels occur close to one another in time, there is a high chance that the second will be missed by the participant. That is, if you see a vowel, A, and another, E, occurs within 500 ms of the first, there is a high chance that you won't \"see it\". The thing that is important about this experiment is that this is not a failure of your eyes to receive the letter and process them, but of your attention system to notice and process the letter. While there is still a lot of debate about what the AB actually tells us (is it attention? is it visual working memory? where in the visual processing stream is it happening?), it is a nice example of a temporal limit. If you slow down the letters or you increase the space between the two vowels to be greater than 500 ms, then the AB disappears. The important thing to take from this is that even when working with single items, we can be overwhelmed if two *important* items happen together.\n\n[Here's an excellent review on the topic](http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/marois/Publications/Marois_Ivanoff-2005.pdf).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417387402", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}
