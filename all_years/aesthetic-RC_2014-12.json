{"body": "Here is the proper way to think about modes. \n\nIf I say to you \"X major,\" that means the major scale which *starts on X.\" So \"F major\" is the major scale that starts on F. It is:\n\n    F G A Bb C D E F\n\nSimilarly, if I say \"X Lydian,\" that means the Lydian scale which *starts on X.\" We're not concerned, at the moment, which major scale this is connected to. We just want the scale to start on that note. So \"F Lydian\" is the Lydian scale which starts on F:\n\n    F G A B C D E F\n\nOkay, but I though Lydian was the 4th degree of the major scale. Where does all that fit in? Let's look closer. If we check out F Lydian, we'll notice that it had no sharp or flat notes. C major, you probably know, also has no sharp or flat notes. So what we can say is that F Lydian and C major have all of the same notes, but they start in different places. \n\nThis shouldn't be new to you, because you've probably come across this before. For every major scale there is a natural minor scale which uses those same notes. We call this the relative minor. The relative minor to the key of C is A minor. They are related. \n\nThis is the same sort of relationship that modes have with the major scale. F Lydian is *related* to C major. F is the 4th degree of C major, and that's where the whole \"Lydian is the 4th mode of major\" bit comes from. So if I say that Dorian is the second mode of major, it is just a way to outline how those two scales are *related.* Knowing that Dorian is the 2nd mode might help me remember that A Dorian and G major (Ionian) are *related.* They use the same notes, but start in different places. G major is G A B C D E F# G and A Dorian is A B C D E F# G A. \n\nSo now what about your question. You asked what scale to use to play \"Lydian over F major.\" This is an ambiguous question, and you correctly identified one of the two most likely options. If you mean you want to evoke the Lydian mode over that chord, you would okay the F Lydian scale. This uses all the same notes as the C scale. If, however, you were in the key of F major and wanted to play in the *related* Lydian mode, you would be in Bb Lydian. Bb Lydian is related to F major. So you would okay Bb Lydian. This uses all of the same notes as F major, and is not, as you asked, Bb major. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417419586", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I pick 7 teams to win at fixed odds (With the exception of maybe boosting low odds higher with a -1 handicap). Lets say these teams are A, B, C, D, E, F &amp; G. I then pick the 3 I like the most as they are the 3 that will be in all 5 bets. I then rank the remaining 4 in order from 1 to 4 with 1 being most fancied/likely and 4 being least fancied/likely. For arguments sake, lets say A, B and C are the most fancied then 1-4 are D, E, F Then G. (Selection G tends to be an outsider. In my sunday games it was Southampton to beat Man City at Home @3.25)  \n  \nWith a £15 stake I then back:  \n  \n* ABC Treble with £5  \n* ABCD 4-Fold with £4  \n* ABCDE 5-Fold with £3\n* ABCDEF 6-Fold with £2  \n* ABCDEFG 7-Fold with £1  \n  \nThis means as long as the treble wins (Assuming you picked odds at close to Evens like 1.7 to 2.35) you win profit. Each extra team adds a bonus payout. Obviously if you put £15 on the 7-Fold you'd win HUGE, but the point is that the lower folds are safety bets for some letting you down (AS LONG AS THE 3 IN THE TREBLE WIN.) You may also want to back some money on a 4-fold of DEFG, in case you hit the bonus bets but 1 or more of the treble lets you down.  \n  \nOn saturday I doubled up and had £30 on. I won my Treble AND my 4-Fold so won £170 return. Then backed Half the amount I used in the example (£7.50) but Toulouse lost 3-1 after going a goal up and they were in the Treble so I didn't win anything even though other games won. I then backed £15 on Sunday and A B D E all came in but C was a late KO so I backed the draw and loss with £5 each to cover the original stake and when C went 1-0 up backed £10 on the loss and £30 on the draw to secure at least £100 profit. They won so all my 3, 4 and 5-Folds came in. Southampton had already lost so the 7-Fold was off, but ROma beat Inter 4-2 (In a VERY TENSE game) so the 6-fold won also giving me a return on all 4 bets at £377.

{"body": "Yep, modes can directly imply triadic harmony.   For a lot of Western music, there are only two sets of modes that you need to worry about: modes of the major scale, and modes of the ascending melodic minor scale.  Stack each mode in thirds, and you have the harmony implied by that mode.  \n\nFor example: \nC Lydian, stacked in thirds: C E G B D F# A (Cmaj13)\n\nSelectively choosing the extended harmony produces simpler chords: \nC E G B (Cmaj7)\nC E G A (C6)\n\nThe opposite is true and more practical, actually.  Usually, you're given a chord, say C7#11: C E G Bb F#.  \n\nLogically fill in the notes in between, and you have the fourth mode of the G melodic minor scale: C D E F# G A Bb\n\nSo, this is what they mean by practicing your modes (so many hours in the practice room...former music major here).  Handy for jazz and pop writing, improvising, etc..    And there is plenty of literature out there about it.

{"body": "I get that everyone has their own opinions and whatnot about music. Really, I dig. But that doesn't mean we can't open up a dialogue. That doesn't mean we can't bat ideas around, see if we can't open ourselves up to a new perspective we might not have considered. And it certainly doesn't mean that I don't get to tell you just how spectacularly wrong I think you are.\n\nIt's a disservice to 2010s music to focus on top 40, and especially when you focus on the more explicitly milquetoast artists in that realm. It's all well and good to pick a past-his-prime Jay-Z or mom-folk Mumford and Sons but that's a bit of an easy way to prove your point. I suppose if you did try a bit harder it wouldn't be quite so easy to contradict Janelle Moane's space opera funk or Justin Timberlake's hypnotic, paced R&amp;B jams. Or, heck, if you're clamouring for some verve and passion in your top 40 it's incredible that Yeezus passed you by.\n\nBut even putting that aside, this period will be defined by its underground artists. We're in a period right now where the creators have been given an unprecedented amount of power and influence which, once upon a time, belonged to the labels and the academics. The audience response to niche or avant-garde projects has brought indie right to the front of the discussion, and for good reason.\n\nScott Walker's \"Soused\", Leo Smith's \"Great Lakes Suites\", Swans' \"To Be Kind\", Mark Kozelek's \"Benji\", Dean Blunt's \"Black Metal, Dan Bodan's \"Soft\", Fennesz' \"Bécs\", Iceage's \"Plowing Into the Fields of Love\", Pharmakon's \"Bestial Burden\", Timber Timbre's \"Hot Dreams\", Flying Lotus' \"You're Dead!\", Jakob's \"Sines\", Ben Frost's \"A U R O R A\", Andy Stott's \"Faith In Strangers\", Perfume Genius' \"Too Bright\", Final Fantasy's \"In Conflict\", Shabazz Palaces' \"Lese Majesty\" I could go on and on and on.  I have pages of this stuff.

And these aren't some buried, arcane nobodies I had to dredge up to make a point. These are all powerful, influential records with an established following in academia and the music loving community. Oh, and they all came out in the past 11 months. Music these days is on a goddamn fucking roll, if you ask me. I am actually giddy with excitement, that's how good music is treating us these days.\n\nI feel like you're just cherry picking the shallowest artists and making the shallowest observations to fit your narrative.

You can settle with Michele's or Kuhla's buffs if you don't have him.\n\nA Spark buffer - Elza, Bordebegia, Raydn ... basically anyone with 70% buff.\n\nAn ignore defense buffer - Zephyr, Raydn, Dilma.\n\nNow the formula should be:\n\n2812 x (1.0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.2 + 6.2) x (1.5 + 1.25 + 1.25 + 2) X (1.5 + 1 + 1) x (1.5 + 0.7 + 1)\n\n= **1776284.16 damages.**\n\nS, LS1, LS2 = 0 because you don't have stats sphere or LS that boosts attack.\n\nP = O = 0.5 for Brute and Ores.\n\naBB = Ultor's buff = 1.2.\n\nBB = 6.2 (Rowgen's SBB modifier).\n\nC = Crit damage modifier = 1.5 base + 1.25 + 1.25 from 2 Maxwells and + 2 from Geldnite Axe.\n\nE = Elemental weakness = 1.5 base + 1 + 1 from double Maxwells.\n\nS = Sparks = 1.5 base + 0.7 from spark buffer's + 1 from Heavenly Bud.\n\nThat's it.

{"body": "Nja, högersossar finns det nog gott om t o m i ledningen (Damberg tex) men de verkar sakna Persson ledaregenskaper (säger för övrigt inte att alla de egenskaperna var goda, men man visste ju var han stod...). Sen tror jag det finns en del vänstersossar ute i landet. \n\nMen det verkar som om ett av S största problem just nu är att de inte kan få fram karismatiska ledare. Damberg och Andersson tex i all ära, men de märks ju knappast. Palme, Lindh (ja, hon skulle ha blivit nästa ledare om inte Mijailovic bestämt sig för att hämna Natos bombningar) och Persson var ju personer som tog plats, som syntes. Carlsson väckte också respekt, fast från ett annat, mer lågmält håll. Löfvén och Sahlin däremot måste man ju titta på flera gånger för att notera. Och det ger avtryck dels i folks förtroende, och dels i S politik. Säg vad man vill om de tidigare S-ledarna, men man visste ju vad de ville. Bara att vara tydlig ger faktiskt intryck, ett visst förtroende. Det inger *inte* förtroende att osäkert stå  och titta på Romson och undra om man gör rätt. \n\nJag är faktiskt väldigt besviken på Löfvén. Jag var lite förtjust i honom att tänkte att det här kan nog bli bra. Nu känns det lite som om han har svikit mig  -trots att jag inte är sosse. Jag misstänker att det finns gott om s-väljare och sympatisörer som härbärgerar liknande känslor.

{"body": "Well I think it's very important to first and foremost learn what keys are.  Everything in music will be much much easier if you understand your keys.  Start with just C major.  Learn the notes (C D E F G A B) and the chords (C Dm Em F G Am Bdim) and use **only those notes and chords** at first to write your song/riff.  This is just a way of simplifying things when you first start out because in practice songs don't adhere to this strictly, but it's a solid foundation to build on.\n\nI understand you're a guitar player but it might be in your best interest to get a very simple keyboard because I personally found that learning scales / keys was easier on keyboard than guitar even though I started out with guitar for many before I started keyboard.  Of course you don't *need* to, you can learn scales on guitar just fine, but I find the visualization on piano to be very helpful.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417530221", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From my experience, this is at the discretion of the draftsman, and whomever you work for may have an established standard. \n\nA teacher once advised me that it is most convenient to draft rooms by wall centerline, such that the contractors can use any width of wall they need, should certain material not be available, or something along those lines, such that the layout of the rooms remains virtually the same regardless of wall thickness.\n\nWhen I had to do floor plans in college they had us draft the rooms by wall centerline and then offsetting those lines half the wall thickness to establish the walls. \n\nI think that addresses your first question, and I think the matter of your second question is a little arbitrary. Visually, the longer length of wall of a room is going to be the longer dimension.

{"body": "*It reminds me of this:*\n\nFour months ago, Puppey uncovered a secret. When in an old Ukranian bookstore, he found a used book with Hielo de la Rana\" on the cover. When he opened it up... A bright light burst forward.\nDendi sat at the computer fidgeting. He had celebrated 2014 new years with his babooshka days earlier, and still was hung over from all the bubbly Ukranian juice he drank. Puppey drafted Brewmaster for him again. He had done his best to win mid, but he couldn't face up to EGs drafts. Puppey no longer explained himself. KKy and Funn1k noticed something as wrong as well, but Xboct was clueless.\nThey still won games, but it wasn't the same. Dendi sometimes read on the internet that NaVi was saving their strats for TI4. Well if they were, that was news to him! But Puppey had been withdrawn the past few months. He no longer made eye contact, and spent all his time in his room with this old musty book. He kept muttering to himself, and constantly looked tired.\nWith TI4 coming up, Xboct was trying to put the bottle away. Ever since his girl left him, Vodka was the only thing that dulled the pain. He didn't care about Dota2 anymore, or being rich. But his team was depending on him, and if he could just get to 8th place then at least he wouldn't have to worry for another year or two about money. He could spend all his time inside with the Vodka. But now he had to put it down. The past few weeks were a blur, but he remembered losing lots of Dota2 while hungover. He wasn't sure if it was because he wasn't playing as well, or NaVi was no longer drafting well. But one day he saw someone playing a lifestealer, and a wave of memories came back to him. \"Was that.. Was that once me?\" He thought to himself. No, it couldn't be. I only ever play Brewmaster and Doom.\nDendi was sitting on the toilet, while his teammates were in the hotel room in Seattle. The TI4 grand final was in 30 minutes. Somehow NaVi had made it to the final match, and was preparing to go up against IG. Dendi wanted to win, but knew he didn't have a chance. The previous ga\nFrankoharris: me Puppey drafted Brewmaster, Razor, Skywrath Mage, Whisp, and at the last second had even drafted a bloodseeker. No one thought they would win that match. But halfway through RTZ felt really homesick, and paused the match to call his mom. By time he got off the phone with her it had been 75 minutes, and EG had forfeited the match. NaVi won by dumb luck.\nDendi felt sick. He wanted to start a new life in America, and he needed this money. But Puppey hadn't slept in three days, and just kept muttering to himself. He left the bathroom and saw Xboct crying with a mixture of vodka and throwup on his chest. He pulled him up, and woke Puppey who was sleeping on the floor. They didn't need to win, just play. Second place was worth something. And no one would say that Dendi lost mid, even if NaVi lost.\nKKY walked on the stage at Key Arena. He glanced at Dendi, who looked depressed. IG was fresh and crisp, and ready to play. Xboct was still drunk, and Puppey falling asleep on the computer. Whatever miracle had brought them this far seemed finished. Second wouldn't be so bad, but after all the sweat and tears he had put into this game it hurt to see his teammates sick and depressed. But dota would do that to a man. The body can only take so much of D I G I T A L S P O R T S.\nAs they sat down, they briefly heard Tobi shouting, before the soundproof door was closed. The draft was beginning. Suddenly Puppey's eyes looked milky white, and he was fully awake. This change in temperament seemed to sober up Xboct. Dendi sat staring at the screen, anticipating a failed draft. Puppey banned Antimage and Spirit breaker -- was he even trying anymore? Over the next four turns he drafted Keeper of the Light, Crystal Maiden, and Chen. Dendi tried to say something, but Puppey was muttering these strange sounds to himself.\nSuddenly Dendi realized he was born for victory. It had never been so clear. Out in the crowd of Key Arena everyone was confused, was Puppey throwing the game? But the crowd noticed that half the crowd had become dead\nFrankoharris: silent, and their eyes began glowing blue. \"YOUR TURN TO PICK\". Puppey drafted Omniknight. Suddenly one viewer began chanting \"NA NA NA.\" Soon every Navi fan was chanting \"NA NA NA TUS TUS TUS\". Others began hooting and screaming. One teenager wearing a NaVi hoodie took his pants off and began shitting on the ground screaming. Some of the Navi Fans kept chanting, but others were stripping naked and screaming. For the fifth pick Navi chose blank. There was no fifth hero. Only four heroes. IG was not aware of what was going on outside, but had drafted a strong draft built around tanky cores like Doom and Dragon Knight.\nWhen the game began KOTL, Omninkgiht, and Chen each walked to the Roshan pit and began chanting. Crystal Maiden was sacrificed to Roshan. Each hero then began to disintegrate, and their essence entered Roshan. What many people do not know, is that Roshan was a fallen angel who was turned evil. But the pureness of Kotl Chen and Omniknight restored his soul. Roshan became a massive winged angel, with a glowing titanium sword three times his size. Kinda like the Final Fantasy sword-- you know-- the big awesome one-- yeah that sword, fucking sick.\nIG began to sob and beg for mercy. Puppey walked into their booth and gave them the gift of a quick death. With a small handwave their souls left their bodies. Puppey then walked into the center of Key Arena, where a mass of chanting and sweating screaming Navi Fans were working themselves into a frenzy to glimpse their lord.\nPuppey looked at them all, his liquid milky blue eyes radiating light. No one said a word for what felt like an hour.\nHe finally opened his mouth and said: \"I didn't want to give away this draft in the qualifiers, otherwise they would have banned the holy trinity of heroes. I was saving my strats for TI4\"\nHe then looked at the littlest Navi fan and gave a wink.

{"body": "This happened very recently, I was 14. (Now 15.) My dad suffers from depression and has a bit of a short fuse. I also have depression and a bit of social anxiety. On to the story.\n\nMy dad had bought himself a tablet. It wasn't anything fancy like an iPad or a Surface, it was a cheap little $40 tablet, an Azpen A700. He'd been using it as an eReader, but had knocked it off a table accidentally. As a result, there was a crack across the screen. \n\nMe, being the curious and tech-minded little shit I am, wanted to see what the damage was to see if 1) it was still usable and 2) it could be repaired. As I'm walking up to him, he F L I N G S the tablet at the corner of the room, as I jump back in shock (How could ANYONE think it's a good idea to treat technology like that? And he works in IT...). He storms off to attempt to cool down, as I pick up the poor tablet to see what happened. Screen had completely spiderwebbed and the casing actually split apart.\n\nDad comes back to see me handling the tablet, and shouts at me for picking it up. (In his defense, he'd wanted his damage to be where it was so he could deal with it completely, since it was his fault. Understandable, but not forgivable thanks to what happened next, which kinda scarred me...) I hand it to him and start crying, apologizing, \"I just wanted to see if there was anything that could be done\". He takes the tablet and walks into another room, I collapse on the floor crying. He hears me and comes back and shouts at me \"STOP CRYING!\" \n\nI try to talk through my tears and explain that it's impossible for me to stop crying while I'm being shouted at, I'm sorry! He shouts at me to stop again, and walks off finally. I flop into the faetal position and sob for a while (Felt like a minute but it might have been 10.) I go outside (this was during early summer and it was a cool evening, about 60-70.) and walk around a bit to try to calm down, which works. \n\n\n\nAbout a week or so later, he bought himself a replacement tablet (Upgraded but cheaper, Azpen A727 for $20.), and apologized profusely to me. I also bought my own A727 the next day! Ironically, his tablet still lives to today, while mine was laid to rest after I'd also dropped mine. I now see why the crack would have made his tablet unusable, the digitizer was damaged with the screen and no longer responded to touch input.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, it really affected me and so I really remember the small details. Even though I'll probably get buried, so I don't know why I bothered posting, but ah well.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417567826", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The people replying to you are all trying to explain how you can change a 'normal' number to a binary one without much reasoning. I thought i'd try and make the idea of binary as a way of counting clear, rather than how you just turn a number into binary. \n\nIf you go back to how we teach children how to write down numbers, it's commonly done quite simply. For a number from zero to nine we just use the numerals (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) on their own. This is  way of saying how many 'ones' we have in our number. \n\nWhen we get a number from ten to ninety nine we use a second digit in our number. This leading digit now tells us the number of 'tens' in terms of our numerals. As we reach the limit of ninety nine, we have to introduce a third digit we have 'hundreds' also, after that 'thousands' and so on. \n\nTo break it down, we can say that any number **abcd**, where each letter indicates a separate numeral from zero to nine, means;\n\n**abcd** = a x 1000 + b x 100 + c x 10 + b x 1\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI use a bold font to represent a number that isnt just a x b x c x d, but uses *abcd*, as our numerals to form a number when written. \n\neg, for a=1, b=7, c=5, d=8\n\n**abcd** = 1 x 1000 + 7 x 100 + 5 x 10 + 8 x 1 = 1758\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nA more tidy way to write this is to use powers of ten. That means that ten is just 10¹, a hundred is 10², a thousand is 10³ and so on. Also be aware that 1 is 10°. Then we have;\n\nabcd = a x 10^3 + b x 10^2 + c x 10^1 + d x 10^0\n\nIt becomes clear now that the power of 10 corresponds to the position of that numeral in our number notation. In this way we can continue to introduce more numerals onto the front of our numbers, meaning we have another power of ten for that digits value. For a number with 7 digits, then we go from 10^7 down to 1.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo where does this bring us for binary? The normal system that I just described is called base 10. The base of a counting system, or notation if you want to look at it like that, gives you information about how many numerals you have, and as a result what your 'ones', 'tens', 'hundreds' ect are. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBinary is base 2. So we only have the numerals 0,1. So to count zero or one, we only need single numeral. This is still 'ones' because 2° also gives 1. \n\nTo count from two to three we must introduce another numeral so we have now **ab** = a x 2^1 + b x 2^0. The 2^1 is what before was our 10^1, the 'tens'.\n\nIn this way you arrive at the following. This is a 4 bit example. Meaning that there are only 4 digits to our number, and they are each either 0 or 1. I use i,j,k,l, and italics to distinguish the base 10 normal number **abcd** from the binary one *ijkl*.\n\n*ijkl* = i x 2^4 + j x 2^3 + k x 2^1 + l x 2^0 = **abcd**\n\nThis is probably a bit confusing at first. So for example, the binary number 1010. \n\n*1010* = 1 x 2^4 + 0 x 2^3 + 1 x 2^1 + 0 x 2^0 = 16 + 2 = **18**\n\nWe can also convert numbers back to binary fairly easily too. Because we know that you either have one or nothing times the various 2^4 type terms, you are able to take a base 10 number, and subtract each 2^4, 2^3 or so term in sequence, provided there is still a bit of the number left. \n\nFor a larger number example. 78, into an 8 bit number. So the highest power of 2 is 7. \n\n2^7 = 128, 128 &gt; 78, begins with a 0\n\n2^6 = 64, 64&lt;78 gives a 1 \n\nWe continue with the remainder of 14\n\n2^5 = 32, 32&gt;14 gives a 0\n\n2^4 = 16, 16&gt;14 gives a 0\n\n2^3 = 8, 8&lt;14 gives a 1\n\ncontinue with remainder of 6\n\n2^2= 4, 4&lt;6 gives a 1\n\nContinue with remainder of 2\n\n2^1= 2, 2=2 so gives last 1\n\nContinue with remainder of 0 (means remaining digits are 0)\n\n2^0 = 1, gives 0. \n\nSo we got that **78** = 1 x 2^6 + 1 x 2^3 + 1 x 2^2 + 1 x 2^1 = *0100 1110*\n\n\nSo now we've put a number into binary, but why is that useful? It turns out that operations such as addition and multiplication act in the same way as our normal number, but you 'carry' a digit over whenever they add to more than 1. These however turn out to be really easy operation to make a computer do for us. There's no problem in reading no electrical current as a 0, and current as a 1. When computers or operation systems are refered to as 16, or 32 bit, what it means is that they can carry out instruction, such as addition ect, using a binary number with 16 characters, or 32. \n\nHopefully that's helped point out how binary is like our own counting system, but you only have a 0,1 instead of 0-9. And how this impact the value that we read from each successive digit in a binary number. It might just be more confusing, but I tried to give a bit of understanding to the whole base 2 thing.

{"body": "Songs are rarely in one key - but rather have \"key centers\". In your case you have part of the song that is in key of C major and part of it is in key of A minor.    \nNow people usually refer to A minor as related to C major. And on one level it is. Take C major scale and build diatonic (scale specific) chords on each step:   \nC E G = C   \nD F A = Dm   \nE G B = Em   \nF A C = F    \nG B D = G   \nA C E = Am    \nB D F = B diminished tried   \nC major scale contains A minor NATURAL scale ( A B C E D F G) in with its related chords - tonic Am, subdominant Dm and dominant Em (C, F and G are tonic, subdominant and dominant chords of C major).    \nAll (well almost) western music is based on the concept of tonic and resolution back to tonic - usually it is dominant chord (G or more typically G7) resolving back to tonic (C or C6 or Cmaj7). In case of major scale that resolution is strong - there is natural tension between G chord to resolve to C. \n   \nHence if you play a song that has melody that is  based on A natural minor scale then you use is Em as dominant to resolve back to Am.   \n\nProblem is that it is not a very strong resolution - note  B -&gt; note C is fine (halfstep) but note G -&gt; note A - the whole step does not create enough tension.    \n   \nThat is why there are different minor scales - not just natural A minor:   \nA B C D E F G    \nbut also harmonic minor:   \nA B C D E F G#    \nin this case you will allow for stronger G#-&gt;A resolution.   \nNote that if you build diatonic chords for this scale you will get:\nA C E = Am as tonic, D F A = Dm as subdominant and E G# B = E as dominant.    \nAnd that is what you see in your song = portion of it uses C major scale and another portion uses A harmonic minor scale = hence E and not Em is in the progression.   \n\nFor all the theorists - I have no formal musical education so if I made a shortcut somewhere I would appreciate corrections.    \n\nLast but not least - to avoid large interval between F and G# another minor scale is sometimes used - A melodic minor that:    \nA B C D E F# G#    \nIn this case subdominant chord will be D not Dm.   \n\nAlso not that A melodic minor scale looks almost exactly like A major scale except 3rd is flat (C no C# like in A major). So simple way to create melodic minor scale is to lower 3rd. To create Harmonic minor you need to lower 3rd and 6th.

{"body": "Gonna edit in links when I'm off mobile. It's been rough for the past week, with finals and all. Listening habits have changed to reflect that, so more long-form stuff and less death/black (with a couple of exceptions). \n\n**[Aldebaran - Embracing the Lightless Depths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3pxjaR_KN0)**\n\nReally incredible funeral doom, headed up by Tim Call (who runs Parasitic Records). Focus is less on riffs and more on drawn-out, crushing tones. The record is structured as two 20+ minute tracks with three interludes interspersed, but the interludes are incredibly interesting. The opening of \"Forever in the Dream of Death\" is basically perfect. \n\n**[Inexistenz - Erfundene Welten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4nPpaRS4Dc)**\n\nEastern European DSBM, in the style of the classics. Drawn out production, melancholy guitar lines, reminiscent of Gris or Sombre Forest. Not incredible, but it has moment of greatness, especially the opening track. \n\n**[Warning - Watching From A Distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42S17rDYZuc)** \n\nThe album of the week thread inspired me to revisit Warning's other album. I'm reminded just how much better it is than The Strength to Dream. Every track (except for Bridges, which still has its moments near the end) is perfectly executed trad doom. This record is probably my favorite doom record. It's exemplary of the genre, and it's damn good. \n\n---\n\nAs for other stuff I've been listening to whole studying, I have to mention **Ben Frost - [A U R O R A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gig7e5lwOE)** and **[By the Throat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43YG2bsEQtM)**, two incredible noise/industrial albums. I've grown to really appreciate Frost and the things he does with sound. Incredible soundscapes and phenomenal textures. Also been listening to **Pan Sonic - [Oksastus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_XmsZ3YJ1M)**, a live recording of the noise legends performing in the Ukraine just a few days before that country got thrown into turmoil. Finally rounding out the list is **Lustmord - [The Monstrous Soul](http://lustmord.bandcamp.com/track/primordial-atom)**,  an archetypal dark ambient album and one of Lustmord's best. The use of negative space on this record is *incredible*. You can hear little nooks and crannies in the music, and it's almost like Lustmord is placing sounds in space instead of recording them.

{"body": "\"I got it! I got it working!\" shouted Polly Audevart, whose short hair, goth clothing and technological skills earned her the nickname \"Punky Overdrive\".\n\nEveryone in the dormitories ran towards her room.\n\n\"Careful with the curtain!\" she shouted. The curtain that covered her room door wasn't actually a curtain. It was made of a copper mesh. The whole room was covered in a copper mesh.\n\n\"What's the curtain for?\"\n\n\"It's a Faraday cage. Prevents interference from reaching the room. It's also protected with several spells. It took me months to get the spells combination right. I'll pass you the scrolls when I get done here.\"\n\n\"What about the batteries?\" asked one.\n\nPunky gave a small kick to a huge contraption that was near her desk. Two huge stone tubes came out of it. Covered by another mesh, two big cables came out of the stone tubes, which led to yet another contraption. At the end, there was a standard electric plug.\n\n\"So there's a DC converter in there that takes a standard DC input and converts it into AC. I got it calibrated from home. The DC comes from a simple thermocoupler. Converts heat to electricity.\"  \n\"And what gives it the heat?\", one asked.\n\n\"A fire spell.\"  \n\n\"And how does the wifi work?\"\n\n\"Well, it's experimental... see that little smartphone over there? Which contains a lot of TV noise?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we see it.\"\n\n\"It's a rudimentary video codec that converts the wifi signals into visual output. It uses the camera as input, so it works just like a transceiver. Instead of radio waves, which can't work here, it uses light.\"\n\nPunky grabbed an orb from her black leather backpack. She put it next to the smartphone's screen. \"I have the other one locked in a trunk at home. Same set up. And... go.\"\n\nShe pressed her laptop screen's F5 key, and everyone went silent. Like a secret magic ceremony, everyone took turns to see the wizardry that Punky Overdrive had just managed to perform.\n\nGlowing in the dark, like the light of an Expecto Patronum driving away dementors, Polly's laptop drove away everyone's speech.\n\nThe six colored letters on her display said it all.\n\nG O O G L E\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417711550", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 87, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Smudging:\nThere are many different ways on how to smudge. Some people do it in a very precise way and some people do it in a way that is more personal to them. I'm not a precise, ritual like person so I kind of do what feels natural to me. Here is a website that talks about smudging http://www.taosherb.com/store/sacred-herbs.html if you want to be more technical.\n\nFirst off: buy a smudge stick. There are many different kinds, but I stick with sage with lavender. You can find these at a metaphysical shop or online if there aren't any near you. You don't need an abalone shell or feather (I actually heard that using an abalone shell is taboo but who knows). But you should have a fire proof bowl of some sort to catch any ashes.\n\nI start at my altar. Before cleansing I like to take a couple of deep breaths and relax maybe even meditate a bit.  I light candles for my deities and actually use those candles to light my smudge stick (that is more for symbolism) and ask for their help in banishing negative energies. \n\nI start to walk around my room clockwise with the lit smudge stick (and the fire safe container underneath it), focusing on the corners of the room. You can just use your hands to move the smoke or simply raise the smudge stick to the corners. I usually say something like \"May all negative energies in this home leave and only positive remain\" again, you can say a prayer or whatever comes to you at the time. While you're smudging it is important to visualize the negative energy being chased away by the cleansing smoke and to be relaxed and continue your deep breathing throughout.\n\nI also like to focus on windows and doors. For a window, I like to say something like \"May this window let in the sun's healing rays and the moon's cleansing light\" while outlining the window frame and making an X over the window. For doors, I like to say something like \"May this door open for the positive beings in my life and remain closed for the negative\" while outlining the door frame and making an X over the door.\n\nYou all of the corners in the room (even in the closets!) before moving on to the next room. Continue your deep breathing &amp; visualization. If your smudge stick goes out, thats okay just relight it. Go around your house clockwise until you're back at your starting point. You can say something here to end the smudging, whatever feels comfortable with you and put out your smudge stick. BAM! You just smudged for the first time!\n\nSigils: \nI don't have as much experience with sigils but I know how to make one for protection. Simply choose a phrase that matches what you want such as: protect me from negative energy of others\n\nThen take out the repeating letters until you're left with : p c m a i v y h s \n\nBreak those down into basic shapes/lines. For example the m would be broken down into l \\ / l \n\nMake a design with those shapes until you find one you really like. Meditate with your design, concentrating on putting that intent into the sigil. You can now carry a piece of paper with you with this sigil on it, draw this sigil on yourself, create a protection bag of herbs and stones with the sigil painted on the cloth etc. \n\nIf you have the sigil written down, etc and you find no more need for it you can burn it or bury it.

{"body": "The Zero Handoff stuff is just marketing and only suitable for a residential environment.  As soon as you read up on how it's implemented it will be obvious that it doesn't scale well.\n\nThat said UniFi can be a really solid solution for the price point if you know what you're doing in terms of AP placement and channel distribution.  I recommend setting 2.4 GHz to half power so the range is closer to 5 GHz then place based on that.  Your best bet is also to match the 3 non-overlapping 2.4 channels to the first 3 HT40 5 GHz channels so you don't need to worry about 2.4 vs 5 GHz inconsistencies as much.  Then spot add an extra AP for density that's 5GHz only (you can disable 2.4 in WLAN config) on the 4th HT40 channel for locations where you have users clumped up.\n\nThe controller software is pretty solid when you run it on Linux (Ubuntu LTS works great).\n\nFor a small business the stuff works great.  I've done testing with the controller hosted centrally as a \"cloud\" service for APs at several locations and it works really well.  The AP control channel is all HTTPS so they can phone home to your controller through most NAT firewalls without any special consideration (unless you filter outgoing traffic).  Much easier than building a VPN just for remote AP management.\n\nI also think the EdgeRouter Pro and EdgeSwitch pair up with UniFi nicely.  Sounds like a pretty solid solution for the environment you described.\n\nEDIT: For AP placement you want to stagger channels to mitigate co-channel interference.  \n\nFor example your cells would look something like:\n\n    1st floor:\n    \n    A B C A B C\n    C A B C A B\n    \n    2nd:\n\n    C A B C A B\n    A B C A B C\n    \n       Channel Assignments\n    -------------------------\n            A    B   C    D\n    2.4     1    6   11   --\n    5       36   44  149  157\n    \n    D = Density Coverage (e.g. add in conf. room)\n\nYou'll need to survey the environment to know how far apart to place APs and account for loss through walls etc. but a good starting point would probably be to look at having them spaced 50-100 ft. apart if you have an open floor plan.\n\nOne of the reasons I go into this is that unlike most controller-based wireless systems UniFi doesn't have any dynamic channel selection or power level adjustment.  They don't even support DFS so UNI-2 of the 5GHz spectrum is off limits.\n\nTL;DR if you put some work into it and engineer the environment correctly it will work great.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417722674", "subreddit": "networking", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Denumerable and countable have (almost) the same meaning in math - since countable, as we've defined it, includes finite sets, denumerable is often used to mean countable and infinite (like the natural numbers, integers, etc). A set S is denumerable if there is a bijection between S and N, the natural numbers.\n\nOkay, so you prove Z x Z is countable if you find a function f : Z x Z -&gt; N, that is, each pair of integers (a,b) maps to a natural number, such that each unique pair maps to a different natural number. I already gave an example of a function mapping the elements of Z. This method, using an explicit function assigning each pair (a,b) to a unique natural number, is the most basic way to show that Z x Z is countable, because it uses nothing more than the definition.\n\nBUT, if you are asked to show it is denumerable, instead of giving an injection f : Z x Z -&gt; N, f must be a bijection. This means that f is injective and surjective. In simpler language, this means that f is \"one-to-one and onto\" - each pair of integers maps to a unique natural number, AND for any natural number n, there is a pair (a,b) such that f(a,b) = n. \n\nIn general, to show that two sets have the same cardinality (number of elements) you show there is a bijection from one to the other. For example,   I have 5 fingers on one hand; I can make a bijection from my fingers to the set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } by mapping my thumb to 1, index finger to 2, etc. This shows I have as many fingers on one hand as there are elements in the set, which is 5.\n\nWe use this notion of bijection for infinite sets too, where it gets sort of weird, because if we can show a bijection between two infinite sets, we say they have the same number of elements, even when one set seems intuitively \"bigger\" than the others. For example, the function g(x) = x/2 gives a bijection between the even natural numbers and the natural numbers, so we say the set of even natural numbers is the same size as the set of natural numbers N, which is weird because the even natural numbers are a _proper_ subset of N, i.e. every even natural number is an element of N, but not every element of N is a natural number.\n\nSince the function I defined in my first answer, f : Z -&gt; N is in fact a bijection and not just an injection, you can use that function to show that Z is denumerable, i.e. same size as the natural numbers. So we know that Z is denumerable.\n\nMoving on to your questions: last time I said that the Cartesian product of any finite number of countable sets is countable. In fact, the Cartesian product of any finite number of denumerable sets is denumerable too. Since Z is countable (and denumerable), and Z x Z is a finite Cartesian product (finite because we are taking the product of 2 sets, not infinitely many sets), then Z x Z is countable (and denumerable). When I said \"any finite number of countable sets\", I mean there are finitely many sets in the product, like A x B x C, not A x B x ... (never ending product). You were right that Z is infinite, but we are only taking the product of finitely-many copies of Z.\n\nThe [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set) is pretty good.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417795999", "subreddit": "MathHelp", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hello there current heroic progression dk tank here to provide some insight.   So with the dk tank they are pretty easy to use .  There are really good at self healz witch will take some stress off your healers.  There isn't really a rotation because tanking is so situational .   We're the blood dk really shines is in its ability to self heal for a ton and of course we are the cool down kings.  We have cool downs for any situation and most of them are really strong .  Blood tap is an amazing skill . Basically only costs 1 blood rune and you take 40% less damage for 3 seconds. Lemme tell you that is a game changer . And also one of the most over powered cool downs ( In my opinion) anti magic shield is just way OP.  Right now I can think of us having I think 6 cool downs for dmg mitigation . Not counting and trinket procs/ uses or bonus armor pots.   So with that being said don't decide on warrior just yet.  Take some time and research the classes .  I've played warrior pally and dk tank and dk by far gives me the most piece of mind and confidence.   Good luck with your tanking stuff and don't forget WE HAVE COOL DOWNS FOR E V E R Y T H I N G", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417813550", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I've got 7 giant linemen shoulder-width apart firing off the ball, and 3 backing them up, pushing against the tide.  I admit that there could be some penetration... but it's not going to be up and down the line.  The RB would have to be able to find the weak spots along the line - or even just add his weight against the line (along with my other giant back).\n\nDon't think safeties crashing the box will do much.  If you have safeties at all - you'd be pulling people off the line.  That gives my 7 offensive linemen the ability to double team your DT's... and then I could have a 350lb lead blocker with a head of steam coming through any gap.  \n\nMy base offense is going to look like this:\n\n   O O O O O O O\n O                     O\n\n           o  O\n\n\nIf you're playing a 4-3, and you just have 4 guys on the line.. I'm going to be able to push these guys off the line *every* time.  It won't even be a contest.  If I see you weak on the inside... I'll have my 3 big backs push right up the middle.  \n\nIf you stack DT's in the middle - how many DT's are on your team?  5 at most?  Then I can run off tackle and just hold the ground in the middle.\n\nHow long will it take for your entire team to be sucking air?  Especially if I'm forcing you to try to penetrate my wall or even not get blown back.\n\nPlus - I'm going for it on 4th and 1 or 2... in my offense 2.5 yards per carry will be enough to get a first.  4 ypc is over achieving.  3 is a good goal.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417819852", "subreddit": "NFLRoundTable", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Alright, you asked for help on 3 of my most played champions, so this could get long.\n\nOrianna is simultaneously incredibly simple and infinitely complex. Her basic lane can mutate; she is considered the safest pick by most pros because there is no situation she cannot overcome. If you are just learning her or already feel confident on her, Q max is the highest rewarding skill build because the lowered cooldown lets you reposition your ball for more zone control, as well as more DPS. If you are in danger of being killed early (Leblanc, Talon, Fizz) E Q E is not bad by any means and will make you incredibly tanky against early trading assassins. Your HP will stay high while their mana pool goes low, and you can CS with autos while the ball stays on you to amp your defensive stats. W max is pretty much considered the noob build, but it is actually the highest instant burst build, so if you have a jungler that wants to gank but cant be relied upon for high damage early (Shaco is a good example of this), Q E W W W is not bad. You can put the ball on your jungler to nuke from farther range than normal; tether range is 1175, and Dissonance extends a little bit beyond that.\n\nAs far as build, Ori burns mana faster than almost everyone, so a fast Athene's is the best build in every situation. You might consider a Seekers vs Zed or Talon, especially if they killed you once already, but finish Athene's before any other major item. Then Deathcap + Void Staff for damage vs all targets, then Zhonya's + Guardian Angel for staying power in fights and the potential for a teamfight outplay (Dying for GA leashes the ball back to you, if the enemies pile on they are liable to get mass Shockwaved &gt; Zhonyas &gt; teamfight over). In terms of gameplay you might consider not smartcasting Q to ensure you get better positioning. I've played enough to know it by instinct, and I also just love smartcast because i play with higher ping than most players, so the faster i cast the more likely my shit hits. When moving around the map with max build + blue buff, Q in front of yourself then W for speed to get the entire diameter of speed buff. When your ball is on an invisible ally, it is also invisible, so Rengar, Shaco, and Twitch all make decent initiators in the jungle/river. Remember, don't save your ult too long, if you can snag a key target like the APC or ADC, fire at will, your burst will either kill them or set them up to be killed by an assassin or fighter. However, a 5 man ult is probably the most devastating teamfight spell in the game, it often results in a clean ace and a game won, so keep an eye out for potential god Shockwaves.\n\nAlright, I really could go on about Ori, but lets take the next one: Ziggs.\n\nHis play patterns are a little more one dimensional, but his damage is undeniably among the highest for instant AoE in the game. Your primary objective in early lane is to get Athene's and keep the enemy under their tower for 15 minutes, using your ult to support bot/dragon fights or to save towers from being pushed. It is next to impossible to ult a target and get a hit if they can see you cast the ability and see their champion on the same screen.\n\nMake sure to use your passive pretty much on CD, either for harass or push. Ziggs has better level 1 trading than almost every other AP champion because he gets 2 nukes, assuming he can land the Q's. Speaking of, Q is mostly an anti-minion spell, but if the enemy steps too close to their own creep you can often drop it in such a way that they are instantly damaged. The AoE damage is higher than the AoE for impact, so practice landing sneaky bombs, but don't expect to get a kill except under your own tower or with a hard CC gank like Maokai or Vi.\n\nLate game your job is to spam Q at the enemy ADC and APC and force them to spend their time dodging your shit instead of standing and dealing damage. If they ever hesitate or mess up, you knock off a quarter of their HP, and if not, they are probably zoned from dealing damage to anyone squishy. Use Satchel Charge to protect yourself and Hexplosive Minefield to protect your ADC from incoming bruisers, or to wall off a jungle path entirely. It lasts a long time, so dont be squeamish just casting it for zone control. Use your ult directly on top of targets that have just eaten hard CC (Leona ult, Amumu ult, Wukong ult, ect) to ensure at least a side hit if they flash, and a full hit if they dont. Ziggs full hit ultimate is almost always going to get him a kill. DO NOT try to hit moving targets, especially those with easy-access mobility (read: everyone).\n\nBuild Ziggs exactly the same way you build Orianna, except boots are less of a priority. Ive found myself with just brown boots and Athene's Deathcap Void at 35 mintues in more than once.\n\nAlright, Viktor. He is 100% sleeper OP and will get you a billion LP if you play him properly.\n\nFirst, Q got massive buffs with the 100 range bonus, letting him deal all his damage without getting kited. The AA followup is a little harder to use, but VERY powerful, especially for nuking overconfident melee champions. W is one of the best AoE zone control spells in the game, on par with Hexplosive Minefield and Lucent Singularity. The stun is as long as Sona ult and the AoE is just a bit lower than Command: Shockwave. It makes you nearly impossible to gank without enemy jungler blowing Flash + Vi or WW ult or some other such BS. It is hard to use offensively, but under the enemy tower (which is where you will find yourself quite often) you can use it to zone melee champions off their CS or force them to take heavy nuke damage from Q and E.\n\nDeath Laser gets its own paragraph because this is make or break for playing Viktor. If you can it it EVERY TIME you will never lose lane, and rarely games. It does about a billion damage with the upgrade from Hex core (98% AP ratio! 1400 effective range! 8 second cooldown! IMBA!). With level 7 and Hex core 1 you can insta-clear the ranged creeps + harass the enemy with a single spell. Build some Mpen and some AP and this spell starts to deal 1/3 or 1/2 of an enemy's HP bar. Viktor can legitimately kill targets with just Q AA E in the late game if they neglect MR. Under tower it is brutal poke, and if you catch a few enemies with your Sona/Ori ultimate W, you can take all of their HP away.\n\nChaos Storm should be treated exactly like Tibbers in terms of when you cast it, but you NEED to take an active role in steering the thing, because most enemies react to it by flashing or using other movement spells, and you need to be moving it from the instant it spawns to keep up and dive under towers with it. Late game try to blast a squishy with ERQ AA Ignite (this will kill anyone who isn't a tank), then drive it around to whoever is closest to you to scare them off or kill them. Viktor is better at brush instagibs than anyone else in the game, including Annie and Brand and Veigar because his build comes online WAY earlier, and excepting Veigar's Q and Cassiopeia's passive, he can get the most AP in the game.\n\nBuilding Viktor is interesting. A lot of people will tell you Lich Bane is core, but I don't find that to be the case. MY build, which has given me an almost infinite number of won lanes with Viktor, is Dorans &gt; Boots &gt; HexCore1 &gt; Sorcs &gt; Haunting Guise &gt; Void Staff &gt; HexCore2 &gt; HexCore3&gt; Zhonya's &gt; Deathcap &gt; Liandry's OR sell for Abyssal or GA. My runes are 14 MPen and 45 AP at level 18. At level 11 with Sorcs HG and HexCore1 you have over 200 AP and 44 MPen + 6% from masteries, meaning targets with 47 MR take true damage from all your shit. Oh boy is this stupid. Nobody can duel you, nobody can tank your damage, and nobody can kill you because of your combination of defensive CC, shielding, and range. Roam bot and dive tower like a madman, force dragon fights then win them, steal enemy buffs with your jungler, or just murder the enemy mid on ult CD. His ONLY bad matchup is Syndra because his cooldowns limit his ability to push AND trade with that imba whore, and because her stun outranges almost all his skills. Nerf Syndra 2014!\n\nMan I could go on, if you have specific questions feel free to ask em. Ori got me to Plat all the way back in S2, Ziggs was my safety pick for all of S3, and Vik is something I pull out when I want to frigging murder people, and when I won't get dove by Vi's bullshit or outranged by Syndra's.\n\nEDIT: you asked how to not get blown up so easily, and the answer is runes and practice trading without drawing minion aggro. On Ziggs and Orianna, run Flat Armor Seals and Flat MR Glyphs, with Hybrid Pen Marks and Flat AP Quints. Viktor is a little more aggressive, you can play like Annie where you dedicate yourself entirely to killing or bullying the enemy out of lane and your tank comes from just dealing more damage than the enemy can, as well as properly timing Q to block incoming nukes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417825214", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I'm **AstroSteps** and I produce melodic music as well as Melodic Dubstep, Melodic Future Bass, Melodic Drumstep, Melodic Mogolian Throat Yodel (lol no)\n\nI decided to make music because I wondered out how did they made these kind of amazing music. \n\nI don't prefer a DAW, you can use any DAW out there as long as you can do it right and use your ears right :)\nI use Ableton and FL Studio\n\nMy inspirations are Laszlo, Virtual Riot, Seven Lions, Xilent, Au5, Fractal, Trivteca, Rameses B, Rezonate\n\nMy Social Medias:\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AstroStepsOfficial)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AstroStepsMusic)\n* [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/astro-steps)\n* [Instagram](http://instagram.com/astrosteps)\n* [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/AstroStepsMusic)\n\nMy fave of my own tunes:\n\n#1 will be my newest EP! [H I D D E N EP](https://t.co/Kg9vCl18Ma)! It is full of dark and melodic emotions, will be out on 12.12.14 (Dec. 12. 2014)\n\n#2 Is my Progressive Trance called \"[Satellites](https://soundcloud.com/astro-steps/astrosteps-satellites)\". I submitted this to mosnstercat and they liked it but they are not interested to release it, this also reminds me of good old vibes.\n\n#3 My heavily remixed Electro House called \"[Vortex](https://soundcloud.com/astro-steps/c0nvexity-vortex-astrosteps-remix)\" even though this sounds so classic, it still makes me happy :D\n\nThanks for reading this and thank you! have a nice day :D\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417853203", "subreddit": "Monstercat", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I just finished my Top 50 Albums and Top 100 Singles for my blog a few minutes ago so I'll bite. If you're curious about the rest of my picks for the Top 50, I'll leave a link to my [chart](http://i.imgur.com/2KfnGHO.jpg) for it. \n\n**9 Favorite Albums ([Link to a chart](http://i.imgur.com/IrrW6ZH.jpg)).**\n\n* **[Sun Kil Moon - Benji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBNdOTu2Wn0)**\n\nYou all know it. The only time I've been this moved by a record was when I first heard Pink Moon. Sun Kil Moon writes his songs like short stories, starting out with mundane events (mostly eating at Panera Bread) then suddenly twisting the knife with some gut wrenching death of a friend or family member. This is probably my favorite album from this decade.\n\n* **[Sport - Bon Voyage](http://sport.bandcamp.com/)**\n\nFantastic post-punk mixed with emo by a French band. Not a lot of depth to it but it's one of the best records I've heard this year, just catchy, perfectly executed, and all around great.\n\n* **[Swans - To Be Kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSdTBGhDSg)**\n\nYou know this one aswell. I think I still prefer The Seer and Soundtracks, but this one is really great aswell. More blues-rock influences than before, lots of focus on rhytm and not so much on Christopher Hahn going nuts on his steel guitar.\n\n* **[B L A C K I E - Imagine Your Self In A Free Natural World](http://blackieallcapswithspaces.bandcamp.com/album/imagine-your-self-in-a-free-and-natural-world-2014)**\n\nCrazy free jazz instrumentals with a guy channeling MC Ride from Death Grips screaming his lungs out on top. Experimental, noisy, and clearly very abrasive. A big recommend for anyone looking for something tough to stomach.\n\n* **[Bing &amp; Ruth - Tomorrow Was The Golden Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI4qwas1KrQ)**\n\nVery pretty ambient focused around piano. Sounds a lot like a more eventful Music For Airports. It can get a bit samey but that's mainly becacuse all songs are made to flow into eachother, working as interludes quite often. \n\n* **[Hundred Waters - The Moon Rang Like A Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-8Oa2t4Ro)**\n\nNot sure how to describe this one. It's kind of folk-y, but with one foot in witch house almost, with the mesmerizing female vocals and the bass heavy tracks here and there. Most songs try to sound different than the others but they're all very somber and truly comfy.\n\n* **[D/P/I - MN.ROY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzimsE8_DKg)**\n\nGlitch album with a few noisier tracks. This guy has an immense ear for detail and while some tracks may sound like he just placed them under the knife and chopped them into incoherent bits, it all comes around and truly feels thought out to the smallest fraction of a beat. \n\n* **[Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbMy-mXMH-0)**\n\nYou most likely know this one aswell. El-P and Killer Mike come together once again and in a much bigger bang than last time. Beats are more varied this time around and the album as whole feels more thought out. Only downside is I miss the comical lyrics of the first one. \n\n* **[Inga Copeland - Because I'm Worth It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pse2TOVAkT8)**\n\nKnown for her work with Dean Blunt when they both were working together under the Hype Williams moniker. This one heavily outshines Black Metal, Dean Blunt's 2014-release. It sounds a lot like Blunt's music, taking cues from tons of different musical genres while aiming to stay experimental and outside of the box. And she totally succeeds.\n \n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\n* **[Julie Byrne - Rooms With Windows And Walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOiGKtBBK9I)**\n\nGreat lo-fi folk record that reminds me a bit of Groupers music. Very lush and dreamy, and Byrne's voice sounds like something that would make great freak folk, reminding me a lot of Natalie Rose Lebrecht's Warraw.\n\n* **[Sólstafir - Ótta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kttuUZTn6o4)**\n\nIcelandic band making a mix of post-punk, post-rock and metal. Inspiration comes from all over the place and sounds like a \"rougher around the edges\"-Sigur Ros.\n\n* **[Adult Jazz - Gist Is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_AIF9NstTk)**\n\nOriginal indie pop with a big focus on timbre, atmosphere, and being pretty. Heavy focus on exciting instrumentation and the singer Harry Burgess goofy voice instead of being memorable through choruses and verses.\n\n* **[Dean Blunt - Black Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfwPziK-SA)**\n\nI love Dean Blunt's music. Love pretty much everything he's put out. But this one isn't even close to his other pieces unfortunately. Too disjointed. It feels directionless. Other albums have been grounded in a certain theme or atmosphere, this one is supposed to be a transitional period into working with Joanne Robertson but it just falls flat and feels like a collection of b-sides Dean had lying around somewhere. Still a honorable mention since I feel it's one that needs to be brought to more people's attention, and it's the most acclaimed Blunt's gotten from many sources who didn't enjoy his music previously.\n\n* **[DVA - Nipomo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blAyeMyvE5M)**\n\nCute and original sounding music. Not sure how to genre-describe it though. It sounds juvenile, exotic and foreign. Like being on vacation in a city you've never been to and seeing the kids running around and playing. Do I sound like a child molester now? That wasn't the point at all. It's a charming record though, that's what I love about it.\n\n* **[Jucara Marcal - Encarnado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18p5_PiPk8E)**\n\nCool math rock from Brazil. I really do think they could have used a bass and some drums to fill out their sonic pallette a bit more but this is still really great. I'm not a math rock coneisseur so I'll avoid saying too much about it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417895033", "subreddit": "listentothis", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Wow DPDragon, u really got it twisted &amp; wrong ! \n\nYes, everybody knows the fire marshall / venue owners inspects venues for events in general, telling organizers the estimated safe capacity.  Not just EDM events.  \n\nWhat lies you talking about ? the 2014 EDC LV attendance numbers @ 134k ? It's been said from Pasquale himself + several local Vegas news websites.  Or the lies about the speedway 131k number ? Check the facts here @- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway .  Nobody needs to lie about anything, your getting it twisted &amp; your wrong.  You can check the facts &amp; sources by researching or check out the factual links provided.\n\nYour like the type of person that says there's only 1 way to do things general.  And those stuck up math people in highschool / college saying only 1 way to do things.  Anybody who thinks differently is wrong &amp; stupid.  That's the furthest thing in the truth.  There's ALWAYS more then 1 way to do things, by thinking creatively.  Lots of different ways.\n\nI've been to all the EDC LV since it first debuted here.  Before that, I went to EDC on &amp; off when it was in San Benardino in 2003 NOS center and LA 2008-2009-2010 &amp; several other Insomniac Events.  Your talking to a long a term veteran raver here, not a rookie &amp; newcomer like lots of newbies nowadays with festivals in general with festivals getting more popular each year.\n\nAgain you getting it twisted &amp; wrong again DPDragon, never said anything about making more stages since there's already a shit load.  To quote myself \"Lots of ideas they could explore\", didnt say it will happen.  Said brainstorming thinking of I D E A S.  Since the maintage is hard to get into &amp; reaches full capacity way too easily &amp; early on, they *could* expand the grounds for Kinetic field, and maybe move 2-3 stages or so right outside the speedway.  \n\nYeah Coachella, Tomorrowland had successful 2-day weekends.  EDC LV will too if it goes that route.  Your wrong about Ultra part being a complete failure when it went 2 weekends.  The answer is both, Yes &amp; No.  It's successful in the sense that it sold out both weekends quick BUT failure when it went to back to 1 weekend. The main reason why, was cause of the ridiculous atrocious cost &amp; charge of the 2nd weekend &amp; prime location of it being in a major metro area &amp; downtown Miami.  They paid a whopping insane 3.4 million to the venue in 2013, that's crazy, and takes out way too much profit.\n\n\"According to the Bayfront Park Management Trust, Ultra paid the city about $1.3 million in 2012 for the venue and $3.4 million for 2013, the first year Ultra grew to six days of music.\n\n“We had to charge them more because it was two weekends,” said Timonthy Schmand, the trust’s executive director. “It’s as simple as that.”\n\nSource - www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article1953189.html#storylink=cpy\"\n\nFestivals expands grounds all the time, EDC did it in 2008, 2009 2010 when it was at the LA coliseum.  In specifics, they moved the circuit grounds (2nd main stage) to bigger areas.  In 2010 it moved to a massive entire parking lot right outside the coliseum near the arena.  Plenty of other festivals have expanded grounds throughout the year all the time, to meet demand &amp; handle the capacity.\n\nIt's really odd &amp; wrong when you say there's ONLY 1 way to fill a market and properly expand a music festival and the answer = automatic 2 weekends.  Like they can't get creative &amp; figure out other ways ? Like festivals in general have been doing in the past each year, they figure things out.\n\nThere are two ways to handle EDC 2016 record breaking crowds.  1. expand to two weekends OR 2. expand grounds.  Just throwing ideas out there.  The main stage gets super packed wayy tooo easily early on &amp; unable to enter, so they could expand that.  NOT make new stages since there's a lot already, but move some just right outside.  Again IDEAS, don't get it twisted.\n\nYou guys think thought it was crowded in 2014 ? Lmao it's about to get much worse in 2015, 2016, and the future, like packed like sardines in a can worse especially at the mainstage Kinetic Field.   It will be interesting to see how Insomniac decides to handle the unprecedented, record-breaking crowds each year,  in the future.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1417916641", "subreddit": "electricdaisycarnival", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

In major 7+ you add the 7th, but it's one semitone upper than in normal major 7. For example in C7+ you have C E G B (not Bb). The bass should be playing the root note in those chords to keep the root stable.

{"body": "Like most other people have said, I've always admired you, think you're hilarious, etc. But I was disappointed that someone, who is clearly smart and strongly identifies as a feminist, hasn't seemed to get beyond the \"white-girl feminism\" movement. People have called you out several times regarding various issues, but I can't recall you ever acknowledging your actions or apologizing in any way. I would give someone the benefit of the doubt because hey, maybe they never heard about it, whatever. However it has been widely publicized and criticized in the media (ex: http://yourfaveisproblematic.tumblr.com/post/49073936527/amy-poehler), celebrities have publicists who let their clients know about any potential issues/controversy surrounding them so they can repair any damage(s) before it spreads all over the internet. So let's be real: you obviously know that people have been calling you out. It's just upsetting because you seemed to be a pretty progressive person, and prior to all of this I truly respected and admired you/your work. But after your actions (and your lack of acknowledging those who criticized them) it made me feel a little betrayed by someone I looked up to, particularly by your marginalization of woc despite your outspoken views on feminism. Not to mention the brownface, cultural appropriation, the disrespect towards the LGBTQ community, sizeism, etc. But the icing on the cake is how whenever you've been directly questioned about your actions, you STILL continue to dismiss and silence us, in a pretty insulting way to be honest. For example, this educated, enlightened response: \"Poehler asked about the criticism over SNL not having an African-American female cast member: Ugh, I don’t want to talk about this. Pass.\"  \n\n???\nR E A L L Y\n???\n\nWhy would you behave that way, especially since you've gotten on your soapbox to proclaim how feminist you are numerous times? The hypocrisy is pretty astounding and inherently anti-feminist, to be honest. \n\nObviously I'm going to be realistic and understand that an opinion from some anonymous girl commenting on reddit isn't going to make you lose any sleep at night, but I figured I figured I would just send it out to the universe anyway. \n\nPS http://dearwhitefeminists.wordpress.com/\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418015408", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

I did not watch any of these games and I am only basing my thoughts on the bracket results.  \n**Things to note**\n\n\n* In the 3rd/4th place decider, ig was 2-0'ed by tongfu. They were using a random standin at that time but from this day until chuan comes back, BurNIng will fill in his shoes. [source] (https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=781004828632467) I have no idea how the roles are gonna be today but don't expect burning to be able to fix iG's internal issues. **Be wary of betting on iG, don't just hop in to hype trains.**  \n* CDEC has been performing well these past few months and seeing that they took a game off of Newbee in the finals indicate that they are not slacking off.  \n*  LAI took game 2 from tongfu but their recent performance is unknown since I could not find any vods and the whole tournament is under trackdota's radar due to not having an ingame ticket.  I believe /u/KingOfGambling watched the game though so you can ask him.\n* Speed Gaming's recent performance is yet to be known but they did defeat Vici and CDEC in the starladder groupstages with a strong 2-0 standing at the moment.  \n* LGD and HGT both got 2-0'ed by iG and Newbee respectively.\n\nSo in the end, my bets would be:  \n**LAI**&gt;Speed (small)    **WON**  \nLGD&lt;*HGT* (abstain or small on hgt)  **ABSTAINED**  \niG&lt;**CDEC** (medium)  **WON**  \n**Speed**&gt;Magneto (medium)  **WE FOCKEN LOST**  \nhope this helps  \nEDIT:  \n**mYi**&gt;denial (small or abstain) i hate 7ckingbad and his slardar picks.

I think odds should be more in favor of lajons but after AS won against M A N N E R E D B O Y S yesterday and lajons losing to hr which in their own right is a decent team, album sheet got a 10% boost in my opinion.  **WON**  \nM5 vs duza **ABSTAINED**  \nWent 3-1 today with 3 abstains.

{"body": "Yeah I think he plays that prelude very fast and straight through because it's a lousy piece. Not one of JSB's better efforts. Hehe, but well that might be part of it. But a couple of points: although it (again, the prelude) is fast and busy, it is actually not very hard for a basically competent pianist who can do running notes and arpeggios, just because of how it's constructed. It seems like he finds it a bit uninteresting, and is eager to get on to the fugue. He brings it to a close very nicely, as he usually does with any piece with a very nice ritard, and the ritard usually gives you a clue that he's been taking the piece seriously.\n\nHe does a little crescendo and decrescendo on some of the arpeggios to bring them out, but it's very straight. Maybe rushed, but not exactly. But everything leads *right* into the next thing, ever the slightest making room for some dramatic announcement of the next arpeggiated figure, right? Why is he doing that? But I do think you can guess that that is his point. Somehow.\n\nSo if that's the point, what does it mean? He most decidedly doesn't bring out the top slurs at :24 in the RH, for example. Why? And that whole piece is :42 seconds. Very short. It goes through these various chords and what not, keeping the *perpetuum mobile* going without a breath, to a nice little finish. Not bringing out moments of \"lightning\", sparks or fire: very flat, like a harpsichord in terms of volume and evenness of volume. But no agogic (or dramatic holding back and stops and what). So you can see one thing: he's serious about keeping it straight through with only the slightest shaping. \n\nThe reason is this, and he does this a lot: the piece itself holds the secret to itself. You don't have to bring some things out, they do it by themselves. It comes into focus when you realize that the notes themselves are doing it, and they don't need editorializing or mood enhancement. But getting on that wavelength is hard, it seems to me. \n\nWhy doesn't he shape the arpeggios? Why should he? They shape themselves. I think that might be his point. You don't have to shape some things because they have so much shape already. When the performer gets in there and starts adding and ADDING and *ADDING* and **ADDING** to make..it..all...reach...some....big........**M O M E N T**, does that actually detract? \n\nSo what if the wavelength to get on is not Gould at all, but Bach? What if it weren't even Bach, but what Bach was seeing, in the music?\n\nI know there is a way of hearing this, and I hear it at times, at other times it's harder for me to get. That's my theory for now.\n\nHave a nice day. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418067203", "subreddit": "classicalmusic", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay let's break this down. Being in a key means that we can recognize one note (or chord) as being the tonic. So if we're in C, C is the tonic (our home base). When we are in C major, we have a fairly limited number of very common scale degrees at our disposal: C D E F G A B. Deviations from these notes can be thought of as foreign to the key of C major.   \n\nWhen we are in a minor key we have two more notes that are at home within that minor key. So in C minor we can have: C D Eb F G Ab Anat Bb Bnat. Notice how we have two forms of scale degrees 6 and 7 available (we have two types of A's and B's). Depending on the melodic or harmonic context within a piece in a minor key different versions of scale degrees 6 or 7 need to be used. The \"three types\" of minor scales are in essence just shorthand for some of these contexts. They do not represent different expressions of a minor key (we have the same tonic triad) but just different places during a piece in a minor key. SOoo the harmonic minor scale could be thought of as a shorthand for how minor-key pieces deal with V chords. The melodic minor is shorthand for how to smoothly ascend from scale degree 5 to 8 AND descend from 8 to 5. The natural minor is for babies. These don't express different keys. They just rehearse different aspects of a minor key.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418071657", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh, those are just house rules. I do actual Homebrews.\n\nExample: [Land Raider Apollo](http://i.imgur.com/GvBUBhA.jpg). My Answer to the Terminus Ultra (which I always thought looked kinda goofy). Standard Land Raider 300points, 0 transport capacity. Armed with a single Turbolaser Destructor, co-axial Autocannon, and sponson Heavy Bolters or Heavy Flamers (for +5Points from he H.Bolters). Special Rule \"Overload\". if your to-hit roll is a 1, roll an additional d6. On a 2-6 the weapon has fully drained its capacitors and cannot fire its turbolaser on the next turn. On a 1 the capacitors have overloaded spectacularly. Destroy the Turbolaser and deal an immediate penetrating hit to the vehicle.\n\nI also have my [Contemptor Talon](http://i.imgur.com/2UKGnp5.jpg). From back in the days when Dreadnoughts could fit in a Rhino, but Terminators couldn't fit in a Land Raider. They felt like they needed some rules. So they're \"Olympia Pattern\", developed by the Iron Warriors with assistance from the Squats to miniaturize the Dreadnought's reactor systems. They were intended to accompany battle brothers into bunkers and other confined spaces during breaching actions. They're S5 with 12/11/10 armour and the \"compact chassis\" rule, which allows them to enter transports as infantry, counting as 10 models.\n\nSome I never got around to building or converting. Like my Ork Krash Pods. Ork Drop pod (so 3HP 12/12/12 armour BS3 for the grot perma-wired into the controls) transport 20, scatter it as normal on arrival. If a double is rolled for the distance the transported unit takes D6 S6 AP4 hits, otherwise they take D6 S4 AP- hits. If it scatters onto an infantry unit (friend or foe) resolve it as a Tank Shock in which the affected unit *must* make a Death or Glory attack. If it scatters onto a vehicle (friend or foe) resolve it as a ram against the affected vehicles side armour. If it scatters into impassable terrain reduce the distance by the minimum amount required to avoid the terrain, and immediately resolve a S10 AP2 hit against the Pod's front armour. During the movement phase the Pod may relocate with short bursts of it's retro rockets. Pick a spot anywhere within 12\" of the pod. Scatter 1D6 inches from that point, as though it were first entering play.\n\nI also did up rules for certain historical characters. Even converted these three though I never got around to painting them, or figuring out a decent price point for Amberley, maybe around 100 points?.\n====================================================\nCommissar Caiphas Cain......................... 100\n\n\t\tWS BS S T W I A Ld SV\n    Caiphas Cain\t6  4  3 3 4 4 4 10 4+\n\nUnit Type: Infantry (unique)\n\nWargear:\nCarapace Armour, Laspistol, Chainsword, Frag &amp; Krak grenades\n\nSpecial Rules:\nIndependant Character\n\nTactical Savvy - While many Commissars demand unflinching forward movement from their subordinates, Cain however recognizes that this is often the best way to get his followers (and, more importantly, himself) killed. As such he is more than happy to dive for cover or carry out a \"rearward tactical redeployment\" as the situation dictates. His legendary status ensure that such maneuvers are, if not strictly panic free, at least organized and his unit will recover from these actions more easily than most. As such Commissar Cain has the And They Shall Know No Fear special rule. Aditionally Commissar Cain may choose to fail any leadership test he is called upon to make.\n\nStern Talking To - While his position as Commissar empowers Cain to carry out summary executions he has gained a reputation for not exercising this power unless no other option is presented to him, prefering to use its threat to encourage his followers. As such Cain has the Summary Execution special rule, but if the re-rolled morale test is passed then no models are removed.\n\nNearly Fearless - Cain has faced and survived every horror the galaxy and the warp can throw at him, and even when experiencing gut twisting terror can put on a brave facade, unless he is faced with one particular foe. Commissar Cain has the Stubborn rule as long as your opponent is not using any units from Codex:Necrons.\n\nMeatshields - While Cain realizes living troops are better at keeping him alive than corpses, when push comes to bolt round he's quite happy to let some hapless guardsman take a bullet in his stead, and will often position himself to make sure this is liekly to be the case. Any unit making a Look Out, Sir attempt for Commissar Cain will automatically pass their attempt.\n=============================================================================\n\nGunner Ferik Jurgen........................ 80\n\n\t\tWS BS S T W I A Ld Sv\n    Gunner Jurgen\t3  6  3 3 2 3 2 7  5+\n\nUnit Type: Infantry (unique)\n\nWargear:\nFlak Armour, Lasgun, Meltagun, Frag, Krak, and Blind Grenades, Melta bombs\n\nSpecial Rules:\nIndependant Character, Hatred(Orks)\n\nLoyal Adjutant - Gunner Jurgen has been attached to Commissar Cain for the majority of his career and will rarely be far from the Commissar's side. You my only field Gunner Jurgen in an army which also includes Commissar Cain.\n\nPsychic Blank - Jurgen possesses the rare Pariah gene, rendering him immune to all forms of Warp sorcery. Gunner Juren and any unit he joins automatically passes any Deny the Witch rolls they are called upon to make, no psyker within 6\" of Gunner Jurgen may take psychic tests, and no daemon within 6\" of Gunner Jurgen may take invulnerable saves.\n\nNeed for Speed - Gunner Jurgen has a reputation as a bit of a madman behind the controls of a vehicle. If he is embarked on a transport which is neither a flyer nor skimmer then that transport may move an additional 1d6\" at Combat or cruising speed. However, Jurgen may never use the fire points of such a transport.\n\nDedicated Transport:\nGunner Jurgen may purchase a Modified Salamander Scout as a dedicated transport (See Imperial Armour Vol 1, Second Ed. page 81) for 70 points. In addition to its normal stats this vehicle will have Transport 2 and a pintle mounted Heavy Bolter.\n\n==============================================================================\n\nInquisitor Amberley Vail.....................\n\n\t\tWS BS S T W I A Ld Sv\n    Inquisitor Vail\t4  4  3 3 3 4 2 10 3+\n\nUnit Type: Infantry (Character)\n\nWargear: Power Armour, Power Fist, Heavy Bolter with suspensor field, Displacer Field, Digital Weapons\n\nSpecial Rules:\nIndependant Character\n\nInquisitorial Guile - Inquisitor Vail prefers to best the enemies of the Imperium through less direct means when possible, and even when forced to take to the field her machinations will typically mean there is a considerable number of resources already in place to support her activities. An army including Inquisitor Vail gets +1 to any attempt it makes to sieze the initiative, and may add +1 to a reserves roll once during the game.\n\nSuspensor Field - A rare piece of technology typically reserved for the most elite units, such as the Death Watch and Inquisitors. Inquisitor Vail's Heavy Bolter is treated as Salvo 2/3.\n\nDisplacer Field - A piece of Archaeotech not even fully understood by the Mechanicum of Mars, it detects incoming enemy attacks and then uses a micorscopic teleportation generator to move it's wearer out of harms way. Inquisitor Vail has a 4+ invulnerable save, if this save is made then immediately roll a d6 plus a scatter die and move the Inquisitor the number of inches indicated on the d6 in the direction indicated on the scatter die. If a hit is rolled you may choose the direction. If this would put the inquisitor in impassable terrain move her the minimum distance required in any direction to be placed legally. If this would put her within 1\" of an enemy unit, the Inquisitor is immediately considered to be in close combat with that unit. If this places her within 1\" of a friendly unit, she is considered to have joined that unit.\n=====================================================\n\nI also wrote up rules for an \"Imperial Fist recruitment cadre\" gang for Necromunda back in the day. Basically one Space Marine, up to 2 scouts, and a whole mess of juves. I lost the rules ages ago, but I never really got a chance to try them out.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418108663", "subreddit": "Warhammer40k", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If the formula for damage that way is simply multiplicative, then any percent increase to those can essentially be applied anywhere along the line, with exception to crit multiplier since that is more complicated (but in this case favors % dmg increase, but crit chance favors speed so its a balance). For example, (dmg x 1.1) times ( speed ) X X X X X will always be greater than ( dmg ) times ( speed x 1.04 ) X X X X X. Is there a reason this is incorrect to assume? I can't see how the numbers ever favor 4% cast over 10% dmg.\n\nEdit: After a little thought, I could see speed being more valuable in pure crit change builds (such as faster attack being more valuable for cast on crit) because of how crits are more efficient at adding status effects it seems. For example, freezing pulse seems to freezes enemies constantly after activating a crit shrine. I'm rather new though, so still confused why it is favored. :P", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418115010", "subreddit": "pathofexile", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My 'ideas' were purposefully ridiculous (except MAXes in a dance-off, totally down for that) - however I still think timers on bases are not the best available mechanic we could implement.\n\n\n\nLooking at your flow of combat, there is no reason to specify the inclusion of timers as a way to allow Force B to reclaim the base from Force A.\n\n\n\nAs for some serious ideas; \n\n\n\n--having all consecutively held 'domination' sites (like in the old days, you might have points A B C D E F etc etc) in a base should flip it over to your team. The twist is that once allies/special vehicle/destroyable object leave the capture zone, the point/site flips back to neutral. The other team would have to take back *all* those sites/points to flip it back, and as the now attackers, they would be forced to move out and be free to counter. So I'm basically proposing an infinite capture timer that leaves either team free to guard/attack/patrol without relying on an arbitrary 'stand here being useless for 5 minutes' mechanic.\n\n\n--make bases have ridiculously multi-tiered defenses; multiple shield gens, staggered capture points, dynamic defender spawns, etc. That's your inbuilt timer. The best bit is, it's not arbitrary, so the small squad will have to wait only as long as it takes to get the job done, just as it would with a zerg. Like defending an Amp station with the multiple shield generators, but with more. Dynamic defender spawns implies that defenders spawn points fall back as their defenses fall. This maintains the distance between spawn and objective.\n\n\n**TL:DR** I cant agree that arbitrary wait timers are the solution to staggering base captures.

{"body": "I play guitar in one of the bands you mentioned (The Bulletproof Tiger).\n\nI can put together a tab of my parts for any song you'd like. Send me a message on our facebook https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Bulletproof-Tiger/105169339763 and we can figure it out. I have been meaning to get some tabs out there so might as well start.\n\nAll of our songs are in standard tuning (well I tune a full step down, while Corey plays in standard). We don’t use any open tunings because it is a pain to manage live, results in too many broken strings and downtime on stage. Standard is just logistically easier (unless you have a guitar tech and a stable of guitars) and really anything that can be done in an open tuning can be done some other way in standard anyways. \n\nAs far as gear goes - nothing special required, in fact i think that the typical clean math rock guitar sound is really just a loud clean tube amp. We don't use compressors or anything like that. I play straight through a fender bassman, though sometimes I flip on a tubescreamer for some extra dirt. Of course delay in the odd section. \n\nIn my experience reverb tends to make that staccato tapping sound quite muddy, especially when playing alongside another guitarist. So we avoid reverb entirely, aside from those ambient sort of delay-ish parts where it defines the sound.\n\nI think we both use our neck pickups exclusively while tapping because it seems to thicken up the notes a little. My bridge pickup is especially shrill to my ears so I almost never use it. (That ice-picky sort of treble tone becomes excruciating after a while so I always like warmer tones).  My amp is a pretty bassy amp even with the treble cranked so no real thought goes into my amp settings. I just crank every knob to 10 and it seems to work for me. But generally I would say you want to go for warmer bassier tones.\n\nAs far as technique goes - it takes a while to build the finger strength and control for tapping, but it is essentially not a difficult technique at all once you put in the time to do so. It is certainly much easier than sweep picking (at least for me). \n\nI think when practicing just try to focus on strength and control over speed. Once you have that strength the speed will develop on its own. Support your tapping hand with your thumb on the top of the guitar neck. \n\nTry to do something interesting with your other hand (aside from just holding a chord). Tapping with one hand while holding a chord with the other sounds nice, and definitely has its place (I do it in quite a few songs!) but for practicing I think it is immensely more helpful to practice tapping different patterns with both hands at the same time.\n \nTry splitting a chord up into its pieces and assigning the notes to each hand and then playing with different rhythmic patterns. \n\nLet’s say a Cmaj7 for instance. Try playing the C and the G with your left hand (index and ring finger) and the E and the B with your right hand (index and middle finger). Maybe your left hand will play a pattern like C G G C, C G G C, C G G C etc. while your right hand plays E B E B E B etc. So if you were to play this your pattern would look like C E G B G E C B , C E G B G E C B etc.\n\nThis will kind of help get you used to playing two different patterns at the same time. To practice this further further switch up the pattern a bit, add in some additional notes, change octaves etc. Just get creative and challenge yourself to play things that feel weird and confusing. Definitely shoot for patterns in an odd time signature like 5/4 or 7/8 etc. Maybe come up with two different patterns based around complimentary chords and then practice switching between them (in two different time sigs and slightly different tempos!).\n\nI don't know if I'm a very good teacher but this is how I started out with experimenting with tapping on the guitar, so hopefully there is something in there that will help you. \n\nAnd like I said I have been meaning to tab out some stuff so if you hit me up with a song you want to learn I'll throw something together for you.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418157406", "subreddit": "mathrock", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

HOWEVER, odds sitting at 75/25 is so bad for BO1 betting. probably abstaining\n\n* (BO1) VG vs **LGD** **LOST**\n \nboth VG and LGD are the top chinese teams in the scene right now. in a BO1, i feel that both teams can take games off each other. if VG wins iG (which they probably should) and the odds further shift in favour of VG instead of the current 66/34, i think a value bet on LGD is smart\n\n* (BO1) **MVP.P** vs TM **POSTPONED**\n\nF L A I R B O Y S. MVP.P won me like $60 value in 2 games yesterday. i won't be doubting them much. also, ohaiyo is said to be leaving the team as well, so i'm not sure if the team is still that strong as well. there's also another post where there were announcements for a Malaysian Mineski team? (still rumor i guess) so i don't really see much in TM's future. also, their record in SLXI isn't that good either\n\n* (BO1) IMG vs **LAI** **LOST**\n\nLAI is doing quite decently after their slump, beating both Speed and iG quite easily. i don't mind betting on them if odds are decent\n\n\n\nEDIT1: bad draft by LAI omg\n\n* (BO1) **LGD** vs iG\n\nLGD managed to salvage a losing game against HGT (so good). they're looking highly motivated for SLXI. i think they should take this if iG does not buck up. HOWEVER, i'll bet depending on odds. if they win VG, the odds are bound to rise. \n\n* (BO1) **VP/Empire** vs xGame\n\nxGame has absolutely no chance of getting top 4 unless top teams throw. BUT odds are shit. won't bet if i were you\n\n\n\nNOTE: Empire has announced that Solo has left Empire and they'll be using ALOHADANCE as a support stand-in\n\n* (BO1) **NaVi** vs HR\n\nwhat's starladder without NaVi?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418165023", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Eventually his scaling can throw things out of proportion. \n\nAs for Kennen, if he uses his e to run, he doesn't have it up the next fight as it has a 10 second cd. He uses majority of his energy on this, leaving little to continue trading. He can poke with auto's all he wants, Riven's hurts more. It's rare to find a Kennen that can react quick enough the first time he faces you against the e q w q comboing harass trick. The last time I played this matchup he couldn't get the timing right until his third death. At that point the game is almost already over.\n\nFor Teemo, most of them just can't move that fast, it's literally impossible... He has no escape, but walking, you can get past his auto range with e q w and then combo him... If he blinds you, you just wait it out, it's more simple than you think.\n\nEvery Renekton I've faced in months has been obliterated by me. I just engage withing the creep wave or counter engage. He loses the trade due to my shield dropping his w damage, and him having nothing else to really follow up with in damage. I can often get my w off just before his w hits me forcing him to stay till i'm no longer stunned and take more minion aggro.

{"body": "I'm by no means an expert on any of this, I've just spent plenty of time looking into things like this myself. It kind of depends on which direction your extending the range of your bass. If your extending upwards you shouldn't really have much of an issue, but if you're extending downwards you're probably also going to be needing a rig update. To my knowledge there's really only one or two bass cabs you can get that will accurately reproduce a low F#0, bring the Greenboy Fearful 1515/66/1 and the Greenboy Fearless 215. Though however you can go the Nolly (from Periphery) route and keep to 10\" speaker cabs and focus on pushing mids really hard and not worrying about the bottom end on stage as much. \n\nWhen it comes to the actual instruments I think a 7 string could be useful, as you'd more than likely in a tuning like F# B E A D G C which is basically the absolute lowest you can go to the top range of what many consider \"standard bass range\". Much of this is personal preference though. Myself I'm interested in a 6 string, as I'm more interested in extending my bass to lower frequencies and not higher ones. \n\nFor brands of basses to look at, again I honestly think there's only one decent choice when it comes to extended range basses - Dingwall. Basically the lower tuning you go to the longer your scale length should be (unless you're going for flabby, then stick to standard scale), and Dingwall bases give you that with multiscale necks going from 37\" to 34\". However Dingwall only makes up to 6 string models, so if you're set on 7 strings you'll have to look elsewhere. \n\nThis info is just what I've gathered myself from reading forums and talking to different people, so don't assume its all the absolute truth or anything...its just the information I've got right now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418220020", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I figure training hard to make all inversions fast and easy in my muscle memory maybe is overkill at this stage?\n\nI personally don't think it's overkill.  If it takes 2-3 seconds to form an inversion that means you just need to practice it a little bit each day.  Something I'd do a lot when I started was start at the lowest end of the piano, with a root position C chord, then go up the keyboard with inversions: Root, 1st, 2nd, root, 1st, 2nd, ... until you get all the way to the highest notes.  Then do that for F, G, Am, Dm Em.\n\n&gt; When i try to teach myself another scale to play on, it feels like a separate entity where i have to memorize new stuff and new numbers in a new context\n\nThat's understandable, though over time they start to meld together and eventually the difference between the keys is not much more than just where you place your fingers.  Still focus on one key for a while then when you get comfortable playing a little simple song and the scale, try a key that only adds 1 sharp or 1 flat.\n\n&gt; I wonder now with the internet age and how easy it is to just google the right chords to a scale, memorizing them is what really good players do? and not something that really make my hobby play better?\n\nEven a hobbyist would be *greatly* benefited by internalizing scales and chords.  Trust me... you might be able to get somewhere just by looking things up but you'll be vastly better off if you internalize/memorize.  You shouldn't have to look up the chords and notes in a scale, you should be able to *derive* them.\n\n&gt; How do the good pop players do it? is it assumed that you can call out any key and they know the chords in it plus the roman numerals?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\n&gt; Its just when i look at the charts and what i have to memorize it feels very messy and almost rainman like to be able to memorize all the scale notes\n\nI know the feeling.  It gets easier though, really!  You're just gonna have to trust me but if you put in just a little bit of time and effort daily you will make progress.  I once felt the same thing but the fog cleared eventually!\n\n&gt; How do hobbyist do it? Are there rules or some logic to keep it in the back of your mind for long periods of time?\n\nYes, there are tricks... for example, don't memorize notes in a scale (at first).  Memorize intervals that apply to ALL scales.  A major scale is:\n\nW W H W W W H (W=whole step, H=half step)\n\nThen all you need to know is the first note and you can figure out every other note.\n\nDon't memorize the note in every chord (at first), just memorize that a major chord in root position is a major third followed by a minor third.  A minor chord is the opposite.\n\n**It just takes time.  It may seem impossible right now but give it a few years and you'll be singing a different tune**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418246041", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I would actually that scales are one of the most important facets of jazz. Chords and scales are inherently connected, and that chord-scale relationship is the foundation for almost the entirety of jazz theory. \n\nTo develop a stronger understanding of jazz theory, the first thing that anyone should do is learn how to read chord symbols. Learn that an F7 has an Eb, not E. Learn what #11 or b9 means. This is the foundation of jazz's harmonic language. From there, an understanding of the chord-scale system allows you to begin learning appropriate scales for for different chords.\n\nFor example, if you see F7(#11), the inclination for a younger musician may be to play a major scale since it's a major chord. However, the chord tones in the scale are F A C Eb (G) B (D). Our scale constructed from this chord looks like this:\n\n* F G A B C D Eb\n\nThis is the lydian dominant scale. It's also a mode of C melodic minor. It's also one of the more commonly-used scales in jazz over dominant 7th chords. (In jazz theory, the natural 4th or 11th is rarely used. In its place, the #11 is used.) This scale creates a very different sound than the major scale. The major scale, to be frank, would have just sounded wrong.\n\nThat was a lot of words, but the point remains that scales are incredibly important to jazz theory.\n\nAlso, in response to OP's post, modes can be hard, but they're still important. For me, it was helpful to learn by their alterations from a parallel scale. For instance, I think of F lydian as F major with a raised 4th scale degree, not as a C major scale starting on F. But that might not be helpful to you. Stick with it, they really do just take time to understand.

{"body": "Could there be intelligent life outside of our solar system? Yes.\nWithin our galaxy? Probably not.\nEven in the past? More likely but still probably not.\n\nI came to that conclusion by realizing that if space-faring intelligence had ever developed in our galaxy within the past few billion years, they would have proliferated throughout the galaxy and we'd know by now. Even if they could only expand out from their home system at .1c using propulsion akin to Project Orion, that species would likely colonize the entire galaxy within a few million years and be detectable by another alien race 50,000 ly away long before that. \n\nSigns of intelligence could be mass-engineering projects, wave transmissions, nuclear blasts, and the like. Radio waves may not be detectable unless sent in highly narrow and powerful bursts but we should at least receive gamma ray signals from nuclear detonations. Humanity alone in the past 60 years has detonated over 2,000 nuclear warheads in tests alone. Each test is like a flare gun being fired at the speed of light to any other technological civilization in our quadrant of the galaxy. If many other civilizations existed. I'd think that at least a few of them would be harnessing the energy of nuclear blasts, either for war, propulsion, or terraforming. There's no way that every single other possible civilization decided to skip over nuclear technology.\n\nA common argument as to why there are no nuclear detonations that we can detect is that the aliens are peaceful and thus have attained a much higher standard of morality. The problem with this argument is that it comes into conflict with how life reaches the point where it could even contemplate the idea of morality. For a species to take over a planet, it and its predecessors must have been in competition through natural selection. In the darwinian reality that we and the rest of the universe exists within, pacifism means death. Even plants develop traits that protect them over time from predators such as poisons and barbs and help them crowd out other competitors. A species that survives via evolution isn't going to be one that cares for a \"Prime Directive\". Not only that, but the idea that \"peace, love, kindness, and altruism\" are the highest virtues is not only an incredibly anthropocentric one, but also a very Christian-centric one as well. Moral relativity being what it is, chances are, another alien species that has become space-faring did so by subduing or destroying all of its competition. Also, before someone mentions \"but the Amish are proliferating just fine and they're the most pacifist people on the planet!\", let me remind you that the 300,000 or so Amish and other assorted pacifists(I'm looking at you Western Euros) in the West are guarded from harm by the most powerful military on the planet and the world's second largest nuclear arsenal. Even Switzerland, one of the most peaceful nations on the planet assumes a stance of \"armed neutrality\". The phrase \"if you want peace, prepare for war\" is an apt one.\n\nNow you have those who say \"But look at how many stars there are! There's simply too many in our galaxy for aliens not to exist! It's just too improbable!\". The problem with that argument is that it trivializes just how many different circumstances and adaptations had to occur before we became space-faring. Here's a list of some of the \"Great Filters\" I can think of off the top of my head:  \n  \n1. We need a stable star in a stable part of the galaxy.  \n2. The system around the star needs to have a decent amount of heavier elements such as iron, nickel, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and silicon.  \n3. Some of those elements must coalesce into a rocky, terrestrial planet within the \"Goldilocks Zone\" of the star.  \n4. Water must exist in abundance as a stable medium for chemical reactions along with the essential ingredients for life(C H N O P S).  \n5. A string of amino acids and proteins that could process other molecules had to come into existence somehow(perhaps lightning strikes hitting the primordial soup and creating the first lifeform).  \n6. One of the first molecule-processing lifeforms would have to be able to reproduce itself.  \n7. The primordial soup must be abundant so that this protocellular life could thrive and proliferate.  \n8. The planet would probably need to have a large moon to keep pumping its iron-nickel core. Without the liquid metal core, the planet won't have a magnetosphere and thus most of the lighter gases necessary for life such as nitrogen and oxygen would be blown off over time by solar wind. Not to mention that the surface of the planet would be constantly bombarded and sterilized by solar flares and cosmic radiation.   \n9. Life then needs to evolve to the point where one of the cells discovers photosynthesis(as opposed to just chemosynthesis).  \n10.. Some of those lifeforms would have to survive the inevitable \"Great Oxygenation Event\" that occurs after the introduction of photosynthesis, the oxygen in the atmosphere would then form an Ozone Layer which would further shield life from radiation.  \n11. The atmosphere must be thick enough to provide decent protection from solar and cosmic rays that would otherwise sterilize the planet's surface but also not enough to smother life in the crib ala Venus.  \n12. The cells would then have to go from being merely prokaryotic to eukaryotic as well.  \n\n[Continued in Reply]", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418318749", "subreddit": "space", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Mentioning I'm d4 currently since I disagree with the flair removal and feel like pointing out my views from my elo range. \n\nSeems like a nerf, W is just not the ability you want all your effects on. It's single target % damage instead of potential AOE from Q. They have the chance to use an escape when your Q hits so you can't follow up with W while your E is a shorter slow makes it hard to catch up to W if this occurs. \n\nMy friend played it jungle a few games, It felt really useless while I praised the older sej in season 4 to be pretty underrated in the jungle. I don't jungle but whenever I saw it used it was pretty effective and gave a bunch of utility and hard engage that was easy to follow up on. \n\n- AP sej I tried, It's not horrible, The problem is they didn't change her Q, it costs a ton of mana and the cooldown is still the same long amount that reduces cd in level. So there a really awkward mix of, Do I level Q so I can actually move around and be useful or Do I max W since it hurts more even though the skill kinda sucks. \n\nThe E which was the core of AP sej got changed to 6 seconds compared to 11 seconds. Which is essentially half the original cooldown. 2 new E's does more base damage then the old E. The AP ratio didn't change so compared to .5, you get 1.0 in two casts, so technically it got buffed with extra base damage, more scaling, and potential of 3 second slow instead of the original 2.5. This is ofcourse based on damage over time, The old one provided more flatout burst and a longer immediate slow which helped the team chase the enemy down for a quick 5 second ACE. \n\nBut while that sounds interesting for the E, It also completely cripples her gameplay. With the new E if you R E Q W your probably going to be in a situation where you can't quite apply frost again to continue your E, so this feels really un-optimal, especially since your not going to kill anyone since your burst is gone. The biggest problem is with old Sej you got the beauty of landing your ultimate, them being slowed/stunned for 1.5+ seconds then combo with E for a 4.0-4.25 second slow which was really crazy on AP or Jung. But if you land your ultimate, you want to spam your E to take advantage of it's cooldown, so in theory of damage output you have to cast it immediately, so instead of the 3.0s slow, your really just looking at 1.5-1.75. Then comes what you want to do next, do you Q in? I feel it's very hard to just Q in now since you need it to re-apply frost so there an awkward time where you kinda want to stay back. But by this time the ADC used an escape already so you won't even have a window to Q them. Then it goes all the way back to the 2nd skill you leveled, did you ignore maxing Q so you only have 1 Q in a team fight, or did you ignore W and your overall burst is suffering. \n\nI feel Riot overlooked too many things on her, they focused too much on clear time that they just gutted her and have way too many numbers/ratios making absolutely no sense to me. I don't think Sej being in the middle of a team fight swinging around her flail is going to be a playstyle that will ever be desired. I don't get scared when an Amumu has his W up near me, it's strong and definitely better then sej W, but its more of an annoyance over a threat. \n\nTL:DR - I'd be shocked if jungle sej is viable, AP sej has potential but some numbers don't add up on Q / W. AP sej you have to do some really un-optimal stuff to accomplish stuff thats probably not worth your time.

{"body": "Whoever this barcode is is very good about hiding his hacks. He's either toggling or using limited hacks or purposefully throwing games to make it seem less suspicious but there are definitely times where it's quite obvious. \n\n[This](http://sc2replaystats.com/replay/1113057) game is the most revealing. He does not scout once (except for some random 'fake' scouting around his 3rd which is very late and wouldn't really be catching much of anything, which leads me towards the idea that he is doing certain things to hide the hacks) and yet he goes 1 gate robo FE and goes THREE immortals before an observer vs a blink opener he never scouts. You N E V E R do that. He would straight up lose to DTs and he had no information that I wasn't doing so. He also knew the oracle that went into his base was fake without any scouting since he didn't react to it at all.\n\nAlso upon seeing a few stalkers to the left of the map with another random \"scouting\" probe he concludes that there's a proxy stargate there and warps in and sends stalkers right to his main mineral line while leaving his immortals at the front. All with the only information he had was that there were a few stalkers on the map.\n\nNot sure if he's toggling or only has production tab hack or whatever but it's pretty obvious that he's hacking in some way or another.\n\nThe blink hack in Carnage's game were pretty obvious. He was blinking back single stalkers while having all of the selected.\n\nI don't necessarily blame the admins since they were last minute volunteers and got put under a heavy burden so it's not really their fault. They did the best they could and with the tournament already having lasted for a while it's hard to go back multiple series to have everything get played out. I personally think it would have been better for me and Carnage to play first to see who would play vs Astrea but I'm guessing due to time constraints they had to just bump me up. \n\nJust all unfortunate shit and better to just move on =/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418355532", "subreddit": "starcraft", "score": 162, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I guess that means something, but as far as +MP items go, they always are a multiplication of 10 and in most cases either a full hundred or few hundred and fifty. That's an extremely easy math for Thoth.\n\nWhen it comes to Warlock Sash and Ethereal Staff, I actually never heard of a person taking into account how much power would they get from ES based on WS stacks. ES is usually bought to provide that huge HP spike, while also giving some Magical Power. Full WS vs empty WS gives 6 Magical Power difference with ES. That's like not even worth counting. That's 15%-25% of a mage's level 1 basic attack with no items.\n\nFrom my point of view having basic math done on screen is useless. It's like these two extra buttons UI rework gave us (\"shift\" to move mouse cursor, \"tab\" to see stats). Buffs can be taken when You're not looking at them and You can't expect everyone on Your team to remember timers, while there's no reason a person allowed to play this game (based on age restrictions) should always be able to do basic math.

{"body": "Man, I wish you lived in my town. I'd have you come to my music store and show you some stuff.\n\nBasically, you need to think more like a drummer, not so much as a [style] producer. No drummer likes playing the same beat or riff without variation, so they'll find ways to add to or subtract from patterns to make them more interesting. Go on YouTube and watch how they play, and start simulating things you find interesting in your sequences.\n\nHere are some specific tips that might help:\n\n- Listen to funk and groove drummers for inspiration. They're constantly finding interesting ways to bend a groove. Even if you're producing right-down-the-middle House or Trance, you need to be listening to James Brown, Medeski Martin &amp;amp; Wood, Booker T and the MGs, Parliamemt Funkadelic, and many other funky bands. Listen, learn, and simulate.\n\n- What they use is generally referred to as  syncopation: accenting subdivided notes that aren't on the downbeat. You can vary the lengths between them. For instance, everything rhythmic breaks down to 2s and 3s. Well, 3+2+3+2+3+3=16; those could be 16th, 8th, or 1/4 note chunks that make up a long phrase that lines up with a 4/4 groove.\n\n- Start writing grooves that don't repeat every 4 counts; instead, every 8 or 16 counts.\n\n- When listening to non-electronic music, listen for drum fills. Even static 4/4 beats have different fills at the end of every 4 bars or so.\n\n- Try to write melodic, chordal, or bass rhythms that don't line up with the drums. Use the techniques above, and you'll start expanding rhythmic relationships between instruments/sounds.\n\n- Go minimal: start with a simple repeating kick-snare beat, but alternate slight accenting kicks, snares, hats, etc. every other measure, or every 4th measure. Apply larger pattern thinking - A B D C or A B A C etc - to those little variations.\n\n- Don't forget about auxiliary percussion - congas, bells, hand drums, tambourines, tablas, cajons, bongos, and so on. These will add color and texture to otherwise \"boring\" beats. \n\n- Something I always enjoyed doing was layering drum parts. I'd have a static main beat going, but add another one for texture - different drum kit, much funkier beat, processed with a filter or other effect - and mix it underneath the main beat, and with less compression. This can be lots of fun if you use loops with different feels, like one straight and one swing; look up the song \"Época\" by Gotan Project on YouTube.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418411468", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have a Spanish Mastiff, which is a common breed in it's native country and pretty rare elsewhere. \n\nI've known several, through friends and acquaintances. The general consensus is that they are very peaceful, dozy and friendly during the day and change completely at night; when they bark, are alert, mobile and will not allow anyone onto the property. I've been told the same thing again and again by those who have them and my vet confirmed the science behind their nocturnal habits, which I found interesting.\n\nOur Stella is definitely most active at night, both winter and summer. She barks. Oh, does she bark... Sometimes at distant goats or dogs but most often I have no idea what the heck she is barking at to the degree that it has become a family joke. She patrols the property at night, seeking out different positions to do her barking from, as she is right now as I type. She also enjoys seeking out different vantage points, where she will lie down to chew on something or doze.\n\nShe does not enjoy being indoors; her interludes in the house are brief and mostly to satisfy her exploratory nature. She prefers to be out in the open. She eschews use of the kennel (a purpose built tiled room that always houses a comfy bed, toys and water) and prefers to curl up on the porch even when it is storming. This is the same dog, who, as a pup, would stand fidgeting through my towel-drying her thoroughly after being out for a walk in the rain... only to walk out into the rain again and lie down on the ground to chew on a stick.\n\nStella is a very sweet natured and tolerant individual. She does things in her own time, at her pace (Stella time, I call it) which is invariably somewhat slower than those around her. Her \"sit\" is not immediate but it is constant. She knows to come when I call her, but again, this is not necessarily an immediate response and if there is something she feels she should investigate - well that takes priority, of course! When she does come running from across the meadow she is a sight to behold. \n\nShe does not really enjoy training generally but she does respond positively to short sessions, with minimal repetition where things happen in slow motion. The last few weeks I've been getting her used to the new Dogloo which she wanted nothing to do with, initially. It has been a very s l o w and steady progress, where every day there has been a tangible (albeit small) improvement. There have been no short-cuts or \"Eureka!\" moments, but she has not relapsed once. \n\nStella is large, heavy, strong - and fast when she runs. I'm amazed by her agility and sure-footedness climbing the rocks and mountainside; seeing her pounce or leap always astonishes me - a feline movement befitting a far smaller, lighter creature. She has rear double dewclaws which help her as she climbs, grips or corners. She is attracted to livestock and I am looking forward to getting a couple of lambs of our own so she can loll around them, which seemingly is one of her great wishes in life.\n\nHere are some pics: \n\n- [With a cuddly toy](http://i.imgur.com/eMFhmnJ.jpg?1)\n- [Playing chase](http://i.imgur.com/j2UBemt.jpg)\n- [Posing with her brosie](http://i.imgur.com/reidlPl.jpg)\n- [Filmstrip: at play](http://i.imgur.com/U4YViuF.jpg)\n- [She's quite decent at \"fetch\"](http://i.imgur.com/q5HLmWK.jpg)\n\nIt's after nine, dark and windy now and I'm heading out for some Stella-time. When we were out this afternoon she was totally chilled and relaxed; she'll be ready to party now. ; )\n\nWhen I get back I'll add a couple of pictures from this week if you're interested and describe her playing style, which I left out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418414898", "subreddit": "dogs", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Speaking of which, here comes one now.\n\nA weary looking man walks over and hands me a clipboard with the same stupid phrase I've come to know by heart.\n\n\"Will you please read this aloud to confirm you aren't a bot?\"\n\nI know the procedure.\n\n\"There's nothing that makes me more happy than visiting the ExxonMobil-BurgerKing-Smirnoff-SixFlags-IKEA chatroom!\"\n\nHe takes away the clipboard without a word.\n\n\"Please follow my link to H O T N S E X Y S I N G L E S dot com to find available women in your area!\"\n\nBefore he walks off I ask him if he could please check out the woman screaming about hot and sexy singles to make sure she's not a bot. All he does is mutter almost silently and shuffle away in a different direction.\n\nI remember a little bit after they first came out with this, people were just being people on here, acting just like anyone would on the street. I mean of course you had your assholes, but at least it still felt like social interaction back then. Hell, it was more than just that when I first got on here. I made friends! I met the woman who would eventually become my wife! Now whenever I log on to the same server as the one she's on, she changes servers.\n\n\"Please follow my link to H O T N S E X Y S I N G L E S dot com to find available women in your area!\"\n\nMore and more lately I've been tempted to click that link. And I'm afraid, but not of the consequences, but of how much realer the possibility of me going through with following the link is. I think I'm changing. I think. But then maybe it's everything around me that's changing and I just can't keep up. Everything used to be so good and now I don't know what to blame.\n\nMy son seems to have fun when he's on here. I'm not sure. I never get to talk to him since he's on the under 18 servers. I never really get to talk to him even when I'm not logged in, because then he usually is. Thinking about all this makes me miss him. Maybe it's about time to log out. I close my eyes and do so.\n\nI always forget about the goggles. The sensations and feelings in that reality seem so genuine that to come back by removing a pair of VR goggles from one's face just feels like taking your first breath in the world, all over again. I look around. I'm in my living room on the couch and it's dark outside. I hear the dog barking. How long has he been barking? I turn to my left and see my wife sitting right beside me, motionless, looking into the abyss but blinded with those goggles. My legs feel weak and I put my hand down on the nightstand next to the couch to help myself up.\n\nAs I'm walking to the kitchen to feed the dog dinner I inspect my hand. It's covered in dust. I hear him whine as I start to wash my hands. I hope it wasn't my turn to feed him this morning.\n\nAfter I give the dog food I walk upstairs to my son's room. I give the door a knock but receive no answer. Again a moment later and still no answer. Finally I open the door to find him on his bed with those goggles on. I put the blankets over him and sigh as I turn off the light.\n\nWalking back downstairs my legs finally feel like they're back to normal. I stop in the middle of the living room and gaze at the woman I love. Or the woman I once loved. I'm not sure anymore these days. I sit back on the couch right next to her and put my goggles back on. I reach my hand out until I can force her hand into my grip. Then I log in.\n\n_________________________________\n\nThis was my first story here, so I'm open to any praise, criticism, etc!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418416831", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

For example. the key of c has C D E F G A B as the notes, but the second chord, D, is played D F#.  Since F# is not part of the C scale, it can be a bit confusion.  If you know that D is the second note in the C scale, you would look to the diatonic mode structure to determine the 1st, 3rd and 5th note in the D diatonic scale to figure out that the D chord is made from D F# and A.

I can email the people who will trash your post and have them give me your IP, and with your IP, your home-address.

Aggressive ambient that rewards multiple listenings;\n\n3-Bryan Ferry, [Avonmore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rBYFhPMvNk): Ferry back on his romantic crooner persona (as in Avalon) with a beautifully sounding album full of genius musicians (Johnny Marr among them); his voice adapts perfectly to the cadence and vaporous feel of the songs;\n\n4-[Shellac, Dude Incredible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StooJzxAfrc): it's exactly the same thing Shellac does. Precise guitar work, angular melodies, no-frills drums and direct lyrics;\n\n5-[Run the Jewels 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-eyupWGfS8): concise, clear-sounding, masculine without overcompensating, nice hooks and beats; best rap album of the year;\n\n6-[Ex Hex, Rips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeKu2U61QMM): a simple pop guitar album that works;\n\n7-Aphex Twin, [Syro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUAJ8KLGqis): a bit too pretentious in its oh so obscure titles but the variety and good taste of the beats and meshed sounds make it an exciting record overall.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418485289", "subreddit": "LetsTalkMusic", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey I remember you! That sounds really nice, I can't believe you ever thought that wasn't good enough.\n\nThis is a great foundation. This is a much healthier sound. What do you do to warm up? I think you should try some exercises that stretch the dynamic range of your voice. I think you used vocal fry because of the relative breathy quality of your voice. I'm going to make some recommendations based on that.\n\nShout like you're yelling (not screaming) across an entire football field. You feel that kick of air? Try singing a simple staccato exercise trying to capture that feeling (C E G E C on [a] for example, changing keys and going up). All of this is getting you to create full closure in your lower range. Right now, your vocal folds are letting air pass through them without vocalizing on them. I want you to try and use every molecule of breath in your singing. This is not a permanent goal, but a useful tool when people are using too much breath for their sound. \n\nRight now, I think that getting balanced phonation in your lower range is the most important thing you can do. Try and keep your abdominal wall engaged when you sing. Don't keep it rock hard, let it expand to breath in, but activate it when you sing. This will open up a new range of dynamics for you, and it may sound ugly to you at first. Be open to change.\n\nExercises for you: Yelling, staccato \"yelling,\" then doing the same exercise focusing on activating your lower abdomen, and connecting the notes together in a legato pattern.\n\nGreat work, keep it up!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418549446", "subreddit": "singing", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Always good to have a bra extender around for the first few wears if needs be.\n\nYeah this is the larger cupped cheska http://cdn.bouxavenue.com/SupplyImages/100311_01BL_0_FR_680x918.jpg\n\nI'd say Boux Avenue's bands run 1/2 to 1 band size tight, so if I had a bit more money, I'd get another 30F to use as my \"have eaten\" or \"it's that time of the month\" bra.\n\n28FF should be 60H if it goes A B C D E F G H, it's best to count up to 8 whenever you look at a brand's cup progression. Generally the letters only change after D though.\n\nNever use 85b.org by the way - I swear it's like the bra fitting antichrist\n\nSo with Aimerfeel, they only go from 30 bands and up to a UK 30FF. You could always get a 30F from them and take the band in if you're good at sewing.\n\nShirohato seems a bit better... makes me want to try one of their 30s!\n\nThank you for finding these companies!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418598147", "subreddit": "ABraThatFits", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Opps sorry I messed up big time there. As for the landing the golden blooms there are a few things I can suggest. First as Kyx says in those linked videos ( I love the guy he is super nice and has pretty useful tips ) there is a trick he uses to land his golden marks/blooms and that is he loads up the combo hes going to do and on the golden mark smash of any combo he actually presses the last button of the smash and lags just a little before letting go just slightly and that helps him get off the golden marks. \n\nI've personally tried his method and while it does actually work I don't enjoy that type of play. I actually hold down the smash button all the way through and let go at the right time based off experience and can do it with concentration almost every single time. It's just about experimenting with different method and having experience with your Lynn. \n\nIt might sound confusing but I'll give an example of how he does it with the highest power smash but this applies to all of them:\nL- left mouse click, R= Right mouse click\nHe presses L L L L R &lt;--- does this quickly and then takes his hand off the mouse and presses R and holds it just for a half second or less and lets go to do golden smashes.\n\nI like to just do L L L L R R-holding until I know its right based on experience and watching my character. \n\nBoth work ~", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418623005", "subreddit": "Vindictus", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Oh man, haha- well you got me, i DID think of the word Alzheimer's, and the fact that it exists.\n\nI do not however think that was the only goal.

{"body": "Went to Vegas with one of my Army buddies. We went up to the rooftop pool to get wasted at a summer party. This buddy is a very awkward skinny shy country dude that I had to talk into going. He's from a small town and joined the Army at 18 and had never seen much of the world except Iraq. Anyway these two f u C k i n g amazing super model looking women get on the elevator with us. They are holding drinks and giggling and seem like they are having a good time. Then one says out of the corner of her mouth to the other one \"Look at this something something loser\" and the other one slowly turns to look at my farmers tan skinny buddy and they both start laughing their asses off. I'm real protective of this dude-he saved my life in Iraq- I watched him just shrink down in embarrassment. \n\nI say to the girl- \"You know one day soon your going to run out of your good looks and all you'll have is your fucked up personality\" She instantly got pissed off and spun around with her finger in my face \"You don't know me! You know nothing about me ASSHOLE!\" and spins back around and again decides to talk shit to her friend \"I can't go anywhere with out some little dicked asshole starting shit\" So I say \"All dicks are little to a worn out whore\" and then the worst thing happened-her friend laughed at what I said and covered her mouth to keep from laughing harder. This made the girl get so upset she spun around and threw her drink on me and slapped the fucking taste out of my mouth :) I laughed saying \"uh oh the truth hurts huh?\" She started crying. The drink got all over her as much as it did me. \n\nSo the elevator opens and standing there is 20 people that were waiting for the girls. The girl busts out of the elevator just crying her ass off covered in her drink. Everybody looks at me like I assaulted the chick. All of these people are gorgeous women or tall beer commercial looking dudes. They say \"Whats wrong Courtney?!\" She storms off pointing at me and crying \"This guy called me a whore!\" So in less than 5 minutes I was having a great time in Vegas and the next thing I know my buddy and I are in a fight on the roof of a fucking hotel knocking over plants and shit. These Ken barbie doll looking dudes came from everywhere. A Vegas security guard shows up and breaks up the fight. One of the dudes is bleeding out of his nose all over the fucking place. I had dirt from one of the potted plants all over me. Chicks were screaming -dudes were bellowing-it looked like a fucking bomb went off. My normally shy buddy is amped up like no tomorrow and won't shut his mouth taunting all of em. The original asshole chick is yelling to the security guard \"These guys are starting fights!\" So the security guard asks me and my buddy to get on the elevator with him and he escorts us to the security office. On the way down we tell him what happened and he sees the perfect red imprint of the girls hand on my face and thank god he fucking laughed.\n\nThat night we see the dudes and shake hands. We all get drunk playing roulette and laughing our asses off talking about the fight and roaming around Vegas and the strip clubs. They were actually some really cool guys.\n\nThe next morning we woke up hung over and my hand felt broken from punching and my buddy has a swollen eye. He looks at me with this big grin and says \"That was the best fucking night of my life\" \n\nHow did I fuck up socially? You never call an intoxicated pretty girl a whore in public who is surrounded by dudes.    ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418629282", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Or true fans feel that No Buses is truly a better song and better represents Arctic Monkeys style at that point in their career. Liking a song more or less has nothing to do with how big of a fan you are, it's down to taste. So don't say by preferring No Buses you're a 'casual' fan, doing so makes you a musical elitist, and immediately downgrades your voice to one that no one is going to listen to. Too Much To Ask is a great song, but it lacks variety, and the lyrics are overrated within this community, and the fanbase at large. No Buses is a twist on a love song, written in classic Verse Chorus V C B V C structure but in a way that you don't notice, and when you compare that to the output of WPSIATWIN, which was all about breaking traditional structure, this song is proof of talent and achievement. That's why I believe it's a better song, and that's my opinion. Don't tell me this makes me less of a fan.

{"body": "Here are some things I would work on with respect to the composition.  Obviously composition is a subjective and creative endeavor, so only take the parts of my advice you want, if any. \n\nThe chord progression seems to go Major 1, minor 6, Major 4, minor 6, Major 1, and then it repeats, starting at 1 again. Except sometimes you leave off the Major 1 at the end. \n\nFor one thing, I think it's disorienting to switch back and forth like that. For another, in this sort of progression it feels much more natural to end the phrase on the more dissonant minor 6 and start over on Major 1, so it catches me off guard when you leave on the Major 1 at the end. So I would stick to 1, 6, 4, 6, repeat. (This would also be a bit repetitive for me, but there are plenty of songs on the radio that are just that repetitive.)\n\nYour melody also seems to fluctuate closely around a theme for the whole song. I would stick to a fixed melody for this piece (probably with different parts, A B A B C A B or something). You could commit to improvising over the whole thing, but that only works if its super interesting improvisation, which your melody is not at this point.\n\nIn order to make the melody really grab the listener, think about dissonance and resolution in respect to the chord changes. Usually you want to start off easy, and then, with some ups and downs, build dissonance of the melody until it becomes TOO MUCH TO BEAR! and then resolve on the Major 1 chord. Basically just like sex. It's great if you can make the overall structure of a song follow this sort of pattern as well. \n\nI hope you find some of that helpful. Good luck.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418665202", "subreddit": "RateMyAudio", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I personally have purchased thousands of dollars of makeup for myself, girlfriends, sisters, moms, and aunts. I now when I purchase these items for myself and others, I get commission because the company that I am now a partner with, shows me thanks by paying me commission for my loyalty. Now my friends have the opportunity to buy from me or become their own partner and create their own business.\n My brand is youniqueproducts.com/sirmakeup\n I use Facebook, Kik, Twitter, Craigslist, Instagram, etc. to spread my brand. To give everyone I meet an opportunity to get to know my company and an opportunity to say “yes”. “Yes, I want to be part of your business, your passion, your vision”. To get started you go to my site youniqueproducts.com/sirmakeup and join my team. My investment was the same as yours will be $99.00 ($113 with tax). You will then sign up for your own Younique website that you can refer friends, family, clients to. You receive in the mail a few days later $200.00 worth of makeup that you can use and sample to get a feel for our product. I just thought to myself, that $100 is a tiny investment if I can believe in myself to be more, to be my own boss, and be a mentor to those who don’t want to wake up and drive to a job they don’t love or want to do. True wealth is done by creating a life that makes you happy, I am happy when I can be helping others become more, strive for more, and create something that they are proud of. When you sign up I will be your sponsor, I will be here collaborating on ideas on how to get leads and create talk tracks on how to make your emails, tweets, and posts more enticing. Sales…. To stay an active part of the company you have to sell $175 worth of good every 3 months. So that is one $15 sale per week. You will get paid in about 3 hours after every sale. You will receive a Younique debit card where all commissions will be paid to. Bet on yourself, surround yourself with great people, and help others find happiness Sir Makeup Youniqueproducts.com/sirmakeup sirmakeup@gmail.com Twitter @sirmakeup\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418705867", "subreddit": "smallbusiness", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Jag tycker mest att det är en onödig kommentar från vänstersidan, men dom gillar ju att förena sina grupper genom att sprida ilska (medan SD förenar med rädsla). \n\nDet är klart att jag använder flyktingens perspektiv. Det är liksom lite nivåskillnad i lidande mellan flyktingar och folk som växt upp i Sverige. Om det sker exempelvis en våldtäkt där en invandrare är gärningsman så ser jag inte detta som ett resultat av invandringen. Skulle jag krocka med en tysk husvagnsfamilj och bli rullstolsbunden så ser jag inte heller detta som ett resultat av turismen. Sen är det klart att jag förstår den utsattes perspektiv, men min lösning på problemet är inte nödvändigtvis att färre kommer hit. \n\nGällande den långsiktiga effekten så kan man hitta båda goda och dåliga exempel på hur väl vår integrationspolitik har fungerat. Jag lever inte i någon fantasivärld där jag tror att allting är perfekt som det är, SD finnas i riksdagen av en anledning. Två goda exempel skulle jag säga är chilenare och iranier men alla flyktingströmmar har sin unika utmaningar och de som kommer hit kommer därför ha olika förutsättningar.

{"body": "**Day 1 Predictions**\n\n\nWe come to the Gabba for the second test with Australia leading the series 1 nil. This time we are led by the cricketing deity and sex God Steven Peter Devereux Smith. His elevation to Australian test captain is no surprise as it has come on the back of a strong campaign from the community at /r/cricket. We did it!\n\n\n*Toss*\n\n\nOh my does Captain Smith look stunning in his blazer. Strangely India have also promoted Rohit to the captaincy. The coin goes up. “What What What” is Rohit’s call. In 140yrs of test cricket this is the first time someone has ever called a “What What What”. No one knows what to do. The umpires confer, using KFC Hotspot they bypass the phone a friend option and go for the 50/50 chance to remove two options. It leaves us with (a) Award the toss to Australia (b) Award the toss to Australia. The toss is awarded to Australia.  \n\n\n*Session 1*\n\n\nOut stroll the openers, Warner and Grandpa Rogers. His form has been scintillating but this pitch is tough to bat on first session, Warner struggles, he reaches his 50 in the first session at a very sluggish run a ball. Naturally Rogers is dismissed before he reaches 20, surely he has to go. Who is his batting coach? Chris Martin? Twatto the front pad LBW master walks out, he’ll probably get an LBW here. First ball is LBW, so plumb the entire definition of plumb is changed in the Oxford dictionary. Plumb (n) Anytime Twatto is hit on his front pad. Out walks Steve Smith, Millions of girls around the World collectively gushed in anticipation of Steve Smith at the crease. A quick 20 ‘rain’ delay ensues. Tubs recalls that time his fujitsu broke on Day 2 at Adelaide and Brayshaw is off with the fairies. He compiles a nice 30 before the lunch break. Australia head into the break at 2-222. Warner on 152 not out.\n\n\n*Lunch Break*\n\n\nIf you’re gonna have a wank today now is the time to do it. The cricket show is still fucked and Slats is definitely under the influence of at least 13 different drugs. It really looks like he tried to toke up at the pitch last night, its greener than anything on the market.\n\n\n*Session 2*\n\n\nFirst up we have Healy, Tubs and Brayshaw in the commentary box, CH9 is taking the piss. Warner decides to unleash dispatching Sharma into the people numerous times. Which Sharma you ask? All of them! Rohit is bowling pies. We have a streaker!! Some old mate couldn’t help himself, wait its Conner!! The lure of those pies was too strong. Top kek and fair play to the lad. Warner soon brings up his 200, but shortly after he gets out. Now we have Shaun March, some of the best cover drives in the World when he is in form, when out of form he cant hit it off the square. Finally we have a commentary box change, in come Slats. It’s just Slats. Smith and Marsh take Australia to the tea break at 3-568. Not a bad effort.\n\n\n*Session 3*\n\n\nThe first ball back Smith blocks it, but he finds the middle of the bat and it goes flying right towards the Australian dressing sheds. It’s going straight towards Siddle, oh fuck he’s dropped it again and its falconed him again. Another *Sidder* put down. Smith declares after this 1 ball to give Australia 27 overs at India before stumps. Tubs lets us know that the 10 minute change of innings goes for 10 minutes. Cheers Tubs. Smith is quite frankly feeling generous to his teammates and decides they deserve an extra 4 days off before Christmas, he decides to end to the game on the first day. For the first time in his life he ups his effort to 50%, opening the bowling with himself his first over is W W W W W W. India are 6-0. To give them a few runs he lets Brad Haddin bowl the second over, Hads can barely land the ball, it’s never easy bowling with keeping gloves on. All up there are 68 no balls and 43 wides in his over. India take 236 from his over. Smith is fuming at Hads, naturally Smith goes W W W W off his next four balls and India is bowled out for 236 in 2.4 overs. Sent straight back in Smithy once again opens the bowling and once gain goes  W W W W W W. This time Hads is made to stay as keeper, he instead brings on TWATTO, a most economic bowler who never takes wickets. 0 0 0 0 0 0 as expected. Smith again takes W W W W from his over. He ends with match figures of 20-0. The greatest figures ever in the history of test cricket.\n\n\n*After play*\n\n\nCH9 is now left with 4 days to fill in on their schedule. They decide to treat the fans who have had to put up with ch9 commentary. They air the tv series ‘Round The Twist’ for 4 days straight. It results in the highest ratings in ch9 history. What a top show.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418771466", "subreddit": "Cricket", "score": 110, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Helium has a lifting force of 1 gram per liter. So if you have a balloon that contains 5 liters of helium, the balloon can lift 5 grams.\n\nA normal balloon at an amusement park might be 30 centimeters (about 1 foot) in diameter. To determine how many liters of helium a sphere can hold, the equation is 4/3 x pi x r x r x r. The radius of a 30-centimeter-diameter balloon is 15 centimeters, so: 4/3 x pi x 15 x 15 x 15 = 14,137 cubic centimeters = 14 liters.\n\nSo a normal amusement park balloon can lift about 14 grams, assuming that the weight of the balloon itself and the string is negligible.\n\nIf you weigh 50 kilograms (about 110 pounds), then you weigh 50,000 grams. Divide your 50,000 grams by the 14 grams per balloon and you find that you need 3,571.42 balloons to lift your weight. You might want to add 500 more if you actually would like to rise at a reasonable rate. So you need roughly 4,000 balloons to lift yourself if you weigh 50 kilograms, and you can adjust that number according to your weight.\n\nLet's say that instead of going to the amusement park, you go to an army surplus store and buy one 3-meter (about 10-foot) balloon. It can hold:\n4/3 x pi x 150 x 150 x 150 = 14,137,000 cubic centimeters = 14,137 liters\nIt would only take four of those to give you the same lift.\n\n[Source](http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/question185.htm)\n\nIn short, it's definitely possible, but you'd have to do it on a day with no wind or you'd wind up in Oz.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418795011", "subreddit": "CrazyIdeas", "score": 301, "controversiality": 0}

I didn't watch the game but from what I've read many people considered their play very throwy. Was it a ploy to get to Loser Bracket?, saving strats/etc? Or simply an outdraft/outplay by MVP.P? Rave took FD yesterday 1-1, and only lost on the back of some solid Meracle plays.  Based on effort alone Rave seems like they are putting more forward.\n\n\nTheir last two encounters have gone in Rave's favor 2-0, and 1-0 against Invasion\n\nRave seem like the favorites going into this, and have good odds in spite of this. However the Keckimba factor is there for Invasion\n\nIn the first draft they got Ember Spirit for Keck, they have a 44% win rate with him. \n\nIn the second game they draft 4 hereoes (with exception of ogre) that they have 70-80% win rate with, including a Medusa for Keck that he's 6-2 on. \n\nI need to watch the last games, or maybe somone can inform me why people thought they threw the match before I make my final decision on this one\n\n\n* LAI\t33%\tvs\tLGD\t67%\tBO2\ti-league\t\n\nLGD have taken the last 4 matches against LAI. LAI recently took an upset against iG (with burning) in a game that went an hour , fairly close , but it was his first game with the team. LAI are the underdogs in this match, but LGD has a history of beign upset.\n\nHowever this is  Bo2 which skews the odds, LGD is already far too high to bet on, personally I will pass this game.\n\nRules of group stage of i-league China qualifier:\n\nPro group is divided into two groups. Each group will do a single round robin of BO2 (1 win = 1 point). The team with most points in each group will qualify directly. \nIn the event of a tie, the deciding criteria are:\n\nA) head-to-head record between the teams, and otherwise\nB) amount of time spent in games against teams of the same ranking\n\nSo you would think LGD would treat every match equally but its LGD who knows\n\n\n* MVP.P\t54%\tvs\tFD\t46%\tBO3\tSL\n\nYesterday MVP.p 2-0 Invasion, FD 2-1 Rave.  Their last two matches, have been split, MVP.P taking FD in a Starladder match. FD seem so reliant on Meracle that i think a team like MVP.P is coordinated enough to realize their match up and shut him down. I didn't watch the full matches last night but it seemed like Meracle was taking apart Invasion in team fights.\n\nMVP.P are on a 9 game winstreak right now\n\nThis is still a winner's bracket game, so the loser still has a chance so keep that in mind\n\nThis bet seems fated on the performance of Meracle  vs QO\n\nThe loser will face the winner of Rave/Invasion\n\nAgain, I need to watch the games from last night to inform my bets further\n\n\nThose are the SEA games for later tonight, if I have time I'll do another write up on all the EU games tomorrow", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418796483", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hm, there were several:\n\n**1. Twitter terror/bomb threat in NYC for one of our major television clients:** It was memorable because of the sheer number of tweets used to communicate this threat, and the fact that nobody at the client's end knew what to do. I had to ring about 5 different people (bearing in mind it was the early hours of the morning in the UK), getting them all out of bed.\n\n**2. Anything involving the popular marine entertainment themepark:** Their PR team would regularly shoot themselves in the foot with the status updates they'd post being all cheery and happy, and we had to censor any mention of a certain film or how marine life were treated. So any critical comments were deleted ... of course, that was then commented on by the original commenters too (and usually along the lines of \"How much are they paying their army of slaves to DELETE MY COMMENT?! Do they have nothing better to do all day?!\" or \"If I spell the word l i k e t h i s it'll get through the filters!\" Hah, no).\n\n**3. Heineken dog fighting images:** People kept circulating these images of a dog fight club in Inner Mongolia, on Facebook. There were massive Heineken banners in the background which were there from a corporate promotion event the night before (the venue was a nightclub and had failed to remove the banners at the time the photo was taken). Naturally, *as you do*, people assumed Heineken were sponsoring the dog fight. Any dog fighting images had to be sent to Heineken. There were *a lot*. \n\n**4. Murder attempt on a popular British TV audition show:** A young man rather stupidly posted on their Facebook page that he would be outside the stage door, armed with a samurai sword, an assault rifle, and grenades. Naturally, we called it in and the police attended. It turns out he was actually at the stage door -- with all of the stuff he said he'd bring -- waiting to kill a contestant. I never found out what happened after that.\n\n**5. A popular TV show involving a fictional doctor leaking all over the Internet:** We were asked to try and contain the leak. Pretty much impossible when it's all over the Internet. It was devastating to see certain selfish fans posting on the Facebook page all the spoilers though, ruining other fans experiences (we used to delete the inflammatory spoilers as fast as we could).\n\nSo yes, quite a few memorable experiences. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418826162", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, they aren't interchangeable (speaking of 3/4 and 6/8) but they are *very* similar. Some music uses both at the same time, with some people putting a strong beat every two notes (3/4) and others every three notes (6/8). So they aren't the same because they have different feels and purposes, but they are, mathematically speaking, the same because they have the same number of eighth notes. I think something that might be helpful here is the concept of strong and weak beats. Here's 3/4, where s=strong and w=weak:\n\ns w s w s w\n\nHere's 6/8:\n\ns w w s w w\n\nThe 3/4 is conducted on every two eighth notes. So literally the conductor would give three beats a measure, whereas in 6/8 he would give TWO beats a measure - one for every three eighth notes. You can apply this concept of strong and weak beats to every time signature/meter. For example:\n\n4/4 - s w s w s w s w. Four strong beats.\n\n5/4 - s w s w s w s w s w. Five strong beats.\n\n3/8 - s w w. It's a less common meter and almost non existent in pop music, but there is one strong beat a measure with the conductor giving one beat every three eighth notes.\n\n3/2 - s w s w s w. It's counted the same as 3/4 because it has the same number of strong beats, but it's counted in *half notes*, not quarter notes, indicated by the 2 on the bottom.\n\nAre you understanding it better? Rule #1 is that they're not fractions - they're just a way of communicating how many (top number) of what kind of note (bottom number) to count every measure.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, while every meter has strong and weak beats, different tempos give different ways of counting them. At slooooooow tempos, it's not uncommon to count *every* note of 6/8 instead of just every three, but the feeling of strong and weak beats is still there.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418829200", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Nothing glaring~~.\n**EDIT, after recounting and re running my shift, I now come up with ICESKY, with a shift of 19 without changing any data ordering**.\n\nDay 1: Total: 16 X’s White: 7\n\nDay 2:          10 White: 2\n\nDay 3:          12 White 12\n\nDay 4:          26 White: 9\n\nDay 5:          18 White 0\n\nDay 6:            6 White: 0\n\nSo I used 16, 10, 12, 26, 18, 6 = P J L Z R F, then shifted 19.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418835389", "subreddit": "holidaybullshit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Paul shifted down a gear in his Jeep as the group of four explorers approached this unusual landmark, each of them with eyes widened and jaws lowered in disbelief. \n\n\n“Is this some kind of sick joke?” Paul asked. \n\n\n“It looks so authentic, like something out of a Christmas film”, Erin replied. \n\n\n“Yeah, a horrific, sadistic Christmas film…” Paul muttered. \n\n\nThey sat there parked in silence for a few minutes as they gazed at the abandoned civilization. There was a fence made of giant candy cane posts and strung lights that surrounded the area for miles. Inside the fenced area there were numerous buildings made of what appeared to be gingerbread and candy. There were faded tracks in the snow of all shapes and sizes, some appeared to be human and others were clearly the print of a reindeer or similar animal. \nPaul shook himself back into clear consciousness and began to drive slowly toward the entrance. They drove under an archway that read “The N r h P le”, everyone still silent and motionless. The Jeep began to approach what seemed to be the main building. \n\n\n“I suppose this is the workshop” Doug said. \n\n\n“You don’t think that this is really… you know… do you?” Erin asked in disbelief. \n\n\nDoug stumbled over his words, “No… well, I… I… it just seems too ‘authentic’. Who would have taken the time to do this!? How have we not heard of or seen this before? IF this truly is the North Pole, if this is really ‘Santa’s Workshop’, then where the hell is everyone?” \n\n\nBrock, who had remained silent since the discovery, was the first to get out of the Jeep. He slowly walked toward the door of the workshop. He noticed that the front door was comprised of two doors, one for a normal (if not obese) person and one for a very small person. He chuckled. Reaching out his right hand he began to turn the handle and push the door open with severe caution. The door creaked as he edged it open. The others stayed in the Jeep, waiting out Brock’s actions before deciding to follow. Stepping into the unlit workshop he heard a very faint groan coming from the corner of the main room.\n \n\nBrock stopped. \n\n\nThe groaning continued for a moment and then a man, struggling to speak, asked, “Annalina… is that you?” \nA rush of emotions and thoughts run through Brock’s mind. “This can’t be happening”, he said quietly. \n“Is someone in here?” Brock asked. \n\n\n“Yes, young man. Please come over here and help me up.” the voice responded. \n\n\nBrock fumbled around the dark room as the lights turned on. He looked over to the corner and saw a man dressed in red robes, a red hat, red pants, and black boots stumbling trying to stand. He rushed over to help the man stand up. Brock perched the man against his shoulder and walked him over to a chair to sit him down.\n\n\nBrock stood there for a moment and stared at the man. His beard and hair were long and as white as snow. His boots had a faded word embroidered on them that read “K. Kringle”. The man looked weathered, severely aged, and distraught. \n“This is too real, too weird…” Brock whispered as he handed the man his canteen. \n\n\nThe man spoke again, “Brock is it? Ah yes, you've been on the Nice List for years. I’m sorry that I haven’t come to visit.” \n\n\nBrock shouted at the man, “How the hell do you know my name!? What the hell happened here? What is all of this shit?”\n\n\n“Perhaps I need to modify your standing on my list, Brock.” \n\n\nThe others heard the shouting from outside and rushed into the workshop. As they came into the room Brock was standing, facing a man who was collapsed in a chair. \n\n\n“Santa!” Erin yelled. \n\n\n“What the fu…?!” Paul muttered. \n\n\n“Ahh Paul, you were always teetering between the Naughty and Nice List.” ‘Santa’ said. \n\n\nPaul stepped back, “Brock! How does this man know my name?” \n\n\nBrock stumbled across his words and moments later stuttered a response, “Paul… I think this man is the real Kris Kringle.”\n\n\n“Of course it’s Santa! Look at him! Look at this place! He knows our names! It’s Santa!” Erin shouted. \n\n\n“Ho ho ho, Erin, you were always one of my favorite children to watch over.” The man started to regain his strength and charisma. “I believe I owe you all an explanation, though I never thought anyone would find me here.” \n\n\n“Shit yeah you do!” Paul exclaimed. \n\n\nErin punched Paul in the arm, “Paul, shut the hell up and let Santa speak!” \n\n\n“To start off, I am Santa, around here I was known as Mr. Claus and sometimes even St. Nicholas. The Misses always used to call me Kris.” Santa explained, “My legend began a few hundred years ago when the world was a much more simple and wondrous place. You guys know the story and for the most part it’s accurate. I used to deliver gifts to all the good girls and boys on the Eve of Christmas. I had eight reindeer and for a short while a pesky little bastard named Rudolph. This place used to be so jubilant, so full of life, especially with all of the elves running around with Christmas joy. The best part of this place was Mrs. Claus, I called her Annalina. She was the light of my life, the reason I woke up in the morning and tried to provide everyone with joy and happiness. Beautiful… she was so beautiful.” A look of desperation came over Santa’s face as he stopped speaking. \n\n\nThe four explorers stood there, each of them desperate for more information but none of them knowing how to respond. \nMinutes passed as Brock finally spoke, “Santa… what happened? How could the place you've described be the same place that we saw today?”\n\n\nSanta stared at him in deep thought. Moments passed before he could finally muster up the words. \n\n\n“Brock, the world changed. The people in the world became more self-involved and many people stopped believing in joy and happiness. Many started to lose themselves in their work, others became obsessed with what they wanted instead of what they had. My last Christmas was 40 years ago, I’ll never forget it. I received more Christmas lists than I could fulfill, each one longer than the next. My elves tried so hard to make quota that year for nothing brought them more joy than to see each child get everything they wanted, but we fell short. Every child did get presents that year but none of them got everything they asked for. That’s when the letters started to come in. One of them stuck out among the millions that were sent.\"\n\n\n*Dear Santa,* \n\n*Why? I was a good boy this year. I did most of the chores that my mom asked me to do. I didn’t lie too much and I treated my sister nicely most of the time. You only sent HALF of the toys on my list! I know my list was long but who cares? You’re Santa! You’re supposed to give me what I want if I do my part to be good, and I was! Well guess what, Santa? I’m going to spread rumors around my school and tell everyone that you’re not real! That you’re a fraud! I hope by this time next year that no one believes in you! You’re stupid and selfish!* \n\n*Don’t bother coming next year, there won’t be cookies or milk and if there is, it will be poisoned. Bitch.*\n\n*-Timmy*\n\n\n\n“There were many letters like this but this was the one that ended Christmas, and thus began the decline of the North Pole. Without the joy that children bring on Christmas morning, the elves perished. The reindeer could no longer fly without Christmas spirit, leaving them feeling unable and incompetent, they stopped eating and each one passed away a few months later. Annalina couldn't handle the aftermath of that Christmas, seeing the elves and reindeer die took a toll on her and she took her own life. After I found her remains, I thought of ending my own life… but I couldn't.” Santa was in tears at this point, stumbling over every word. \n\n\n“I’m so sorry, Mr. Claus. For what it’s worth I believed in you as a kid.” Brock muttered. \n\n\nThe other three explorers stood still, tears streaming down their faces. \n\n\n“Santa, we’ll help you rebuild. We’ll do everything we can to bring back the joy and happiness of Christmas.” Erin said. \n\n\n“I suppose we could try to… you know… help you.” Paul said reluctantly. \n\n\nSanta quietly responded, “You guys would really do this… for me?” \n\n\nDoug quickly replied, “Of course!

{"body": "[5x5](http://i.imgur.com/y2XsrW5.jpg) \n\n[PotatoFam](http://www.last.fm/user/PotatoFam)\n\n**Cam'ron - Purple Haze** - Everything about this album is amazing. Skits are hilarious. Beats bang. Cam's a lyrical monster. Easily one of my favorite albums.\n\n**Cam'ron - Come Home With Me** - Not as good as Purple Haze, but it's got Oh Boy so I can't complain. Beats are still on point and Cam's still pretty lyrical, but he just sounds a little less agressive, which is why I don't rate it as high.\n\n**YC the Cynic - GNK** - Interesting project, First of all, this dude's voice sounds exactly like Hopsin, but what he raps about is very much different obviously. This whole project revolves around the theme of gods and space, and every beat on here is spacey sounding. Plus almost every song on here has some sort of throwback to a classic, which I enjoyed. I'd definitely recommend giving this project a spin. \n\n**Busdriver - Fear of a Black Tangent** - About as good a project as Perfect Hair, which is in my top 5 AOTYs. Beats on here aren't as creative, but Busdriver doesn't sing at all. It's just straight bars, which I thoroughly enjoyed. If you liked Perfect Hair, give this a listen.\n\n**B L A C K I E - GEN** - I actually enjoyed this B L A C K I E project. The other two I heard just sounded like random noise, but this one had a direction. And a lot of emotion as well. It helped me realize that through the shouting and anger that I heard on his other projects, that B L A C K I E is human too, as cheesy as that sounds. Selfishness Of Evil Men is an amazing song. \n\n**DangerDOOM - Mouse and the Mask** - I think I'm starting to like this more than Madvilliany. Danger Mouse's production on here just suits DOOM so well. Plus a Cee-Lo, GFK, and Talib Kweli feature? Fuck yeah. \n\n**Aesop Rock - Skelethon** - One of the best releases of 2012, if not the best. The production on here is absolutely amazing. That coupled with Rock's flows just makes for a great project. \n\n**D'Angelo - Black Messiah** - Best R&amp;B album I've heard in a while. Doesn't quite live up to Voodoo, but I think it may slightly surpass Brown Sugar imo. I personally find it absolutely insane how D'Angelo doesn't sound like he's aged a single day on here, despite it being 14 years after his last album. \n\n**Rage Against The Machine - The Battle of Los Angeles** - Decided to start getting into RATM and this blew me away. Zach's presence on the mic is fucking heavy and the beats compliment his emotion really well. Reminds me of a less modern Death Grips actually.\n\n**Death Grips - The Money Store** - Overall the last two weeks, I've become a Death Grips fan. Partially because I started browsing /mu/, but also partially because I've just been getting more intrigued with experimental stuff like clipping, Shabazz Palaces, and Ratking. The Money Store is actually fantastic. There's not a single dip in quality in a single second of any song. Just 41 straight minutes of MC Ride going crazy overall hip-hop/electronic/punk infused instrumentals. Really hyped for Jenny Death.\n\n**A Tribe Called Quest - Midnight Marauders** - One of the greatest albums of the 90s, plus the first one I've bought on vinyl. The beats weer extremely ahead of their time and Q-Tip just rides the beats smooth as butter. \n\n**D'Angelo - Voodoo** - Never not in the mood for this. Everything about this album is so polished and clean. Every blemds together so well. I will admit that I don't pay attention to most of the lyrics though.\n\n**Run the Jewels - Run the Jewels 2** - This album has become so popular that it's now cool to hate it. It's impossible to browse /mu/ without seeing someone call it \"memerap.\" Despite this bullshit, I really like this album. The beats are nice and dimensional and both Killer Mike and El-P do solid jobs on the mic, albeit nothing spectacular. Oh My Darling and Close Your Eyes will both be in the running for my SOTY.\n\n**Ratking - So It Goes** - Still haven't fully gotten into this album yet. Everything sounds right and the emcees sound solid, but it just hasn't clicked yet.\n\n**The Roots - Illadelph Halflife** - So god damn smooth. Black Thought does kinda just an average job on the mic on this album compared to the others imo, but it's fine because the music aesthetics are fucking great. Only issue I have with this album is that it's too long. I normally get bored before finishing it. \n\n**The Antlers - Hospice** - Anyone here a fan of this album? I don't get it. I couldn't understand the singer's voice often and sometimes random noises just appeared. Apparently it's supposed to tell some sort of deep story but idk I just don't get it.\n\n**Purity Ring - Shrines** - Decided to give Purity Ring a look after loving her feature on 25 Bucks. She sounds about as I expected. Kinda boring though. This whole project sounded kinda flat with not enough diversity in sound.\n\n**D'Angelo - Brown Sugar** - Oh god more D'Angelo. Don't judge me I've just been in the mood. \n\n**Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon** - This things a god damn experience. It feels wrong to rate individual songs on here. This thing should be viewed as a whole project.\n\n**Busdriver - Perfect Hair** - Love this album. Wrote up about it before, but I do like nearly everything about it. Even the singing, although I prefer his rapping. This album may have my favorite instrumentals of the year also.\n\n**Led Zeppelin - IV** - Sounds stupid, but I just finally got into this thing. Don't really like the first sing too much, but the rest of it is classic. Especially Stairwat to Heaven. I don't think it's possible to dislike that song.\n\n**Death Grips - Exmilitary** - Not as good as TMS, but still solid. Not as much of an electronic influence. Beware is GOAT Death Grips song though.\n\n**J.Cole - 2014 Forest Hills Drive** - Not as good as Born Sinner imo. Some cool beats, some decent rapping, but overall nothing hooked me unlike Born Sinner. \n\n**Milo - Things That Happen At Day** - So far my favorite Milo project. Kinda nerd-rap, but whatever I dig it. Really love the spacey beats and nostalgic feelings.  Plus the references. \"Dragonball Z wasn't worth watching till Cell came\" gave me a good laugh.\n\n**clipping. - CLPPNG** - The album that hooked me on experimental shit. Daveed's a monster on the mic and the beats are (mostly) great despite how weird they can be at times.

{"body": "I'd like to describe my solution to The [Edge Matching Tile Puzzle]\n(http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ip1gj/10082014_challenge_183_intermediate_edge_matching).\nIt's a program that searches through all possible arrangements of tiles on\na regular 3x3 grid and finds an arrangement that satisfies some\nconstraints. I chose to do the solution in BASIC for C64, as I have not\nprogrammed on that computer before and was interested in how was that\nspecific BASIC different from others. But that could also mean that people\nhere might not be able to read a solution in that language and so an\nexplanation can help.\n\nMy solution was limited and only handles board size 3x3. That is what could\nbe improved in future. Here I will describe only my original 3x3 solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to place square tiles that have colors C M Y K c m y k\nat their edges. For example:\n\n    -C-\n    k Y\n    -M-\n\nFirst, we look at how the available tiles are stored in memory. We get 9\ntiles\nas an input from user. Each of the tiles can be rotated, giving four\ndifferent shapes that can be placed. For example, these are the shapes\nof one tile:\n\n    -C- -Y- -M- -k-\n    k Y C M Y k M C\n    -M- -k- -C- -Y-\n\nWe have 9*4=36 shapes. In the rest of the program we will be interested\nwhat is the color on some specific edge of a tile so we represent the\ntiles as four arrays N(), E(), S(), W() indexed by numbers 0-35. The\nconvention is that numbers 0-3 correspond to 4 orientations of first tile,\n4-7 is for the second tile and so on.\n\n    tile 1   tile 2   tile 3    ... tile 9\n    0 1 2 3  4 5 6 7  8 9 10 11 ... 32 33 34 35\n\nIf we want to know what colour is at the north side of tile 3 when it is\nnot rotated, we look at value N(8). For tile 3 rotated by 90 degrees, it\nis at N(9).\n\nNow, to make the check that colours match easier, we asign numbers 1 2 3 4\nto colours C M Y K and we assign numbers -1 -2 -3 -4 to colours c m y k.\nThen we can check that shape 4 south edge matches shape 8 north edge like\nthis:\n\n    S(4)=-N(8).\n\nThat is, the colour number has to be inverse on edges that are touching.\n\nIn the program this data preparation is done on lines 5-13. You can see\nthe test for matching edges at lines 62 and 63.\n\nThat is the data of the available tiles and their colours, now let's move\nto\nthe representation of the board. We use an extended board with extra top\nrow. So, while we only work on a 3x3 board, in memory we actually have a\n3x4 board. The extra top row is there only to simplify the program as now\nwe are guaranteed that each cell of our board has an upper neighbour. We\nnumber the cells 0-11, the cells 0 1 2 are the dummy cells and cells 3-11\nform the board of our solution.\n\n    ---------\n    |0  1  2|\n    |3  4  5|\n    |6  7  8|\n    |9 10 11|\n    ---------\n\nThe board is represented as three arrays, T(), G() and TR(). First, T()\nhas for each board cell the index of the shape placed there, always\nwithout rotation. That is, if tile 1 is placed there, the value will be 0,\nif it is tile 2 the value will be 4, and so on. In essence, T() holds\ninformation of which tile is placed at that cell, with the convention\nthat the number is a multiple of 4 (as we have stated above how one tile\nproduces four shapes in different orientations). The array G() holds\ninformation about the rotation to be applied to that tile and is a number\n0 to 3. The array TR() is the tile with rotation, and is obtained as a sum\nof T() and G(). You can see this on line 60.\n\n    60 TR(P)=T(P)+G(P)\n\nNow we have described all the essential data structures, so let's move to\nthe search logic. There is a variable P that points to the place in grid\nwhere we have to put next tile. Initially, P points to 3 (as 0-2 are dummy\ncells). We have a loop that tries all tiles on that place (see lines 50,\n51, 66 and 67). Inside that is a loop that tries all possible rotations\n(see lines 53, 60 and 65). Inside both loops we test that the newly placed\ntile fits on northern and eastern edge to what was already there (lines 62,\n63 and 64). If the tile fits, we increase P and recursively run the search\nroutine, now from the next place P. If that search fails, the procedure\nreturns and we continue trying other combinations on the previous place.\nIf, on the other hand, P has value 12, then we have filled the whole\nboard and we print the output and end the program (see line 30 for this\ntest).\n\nThat's about the core logic of the program. And in the final remarks, I\nhave one question to the community here. I have noticed that solutions in\nlanguages like Python or Ruby are usually more discussed and preferred. So\nmy question is, does anyone find any value in it when a solution is posted\nin a language that is not commonly used? (Except for brainf-ck, such\nsolutions are always fun, of course :-) ).\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418898437", "subreddit": "dailyprogrammer", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I could probably spend all day and figure out my top 100 of the year if I put some thought into it, but instead I'm just going to state my #1 album of the year, and also what I now consider to be the best vaporwave album of all time: ['アマテラス' by t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者](https://telepathtelepath.bandcamp.com/album/--19)\n\nI don't think I've ever heard a bad Telepath song despite his prolific nature, and more often than not his music is amazing, out of this world. It was hearing his music, along with a few others, that really took my curiosity in vaporwave from a passing interest into a life-changing exploration into the new possibilities of music that it has become for me today - and that I am ever grateful for. I think like Intedjekt mentioned earlier in the thread, his '現実を超えて' (Beyond The Reality) album could be seen as the epitome of vaporwave, and I would say that album is a hugely important Telepath album and probably my 2nd favourite of is.\n\nBut アマテラス (Amaterasu) really just felt like a whole year's worth of work clicked into place from him, and took a p4k-style 9.8 for Beyond The Reality to a 10.0 with Amaterasu. With each listen, I've grown to love the album more and more, and the time just flies by every time I listen to it.

{"body": "I was raised by an Ayn Rand fanatic.  And considered myself an Objectivist for that reason until my early twenties.  I know E V E R Y position you have because I used to be you.  And then I came to realize something very simple -- almost embarrasingly simple: I make the money and have the life that I do now make because people in the past were willing to fight for a 40 hour work week (considered forcing employers unfairly at the time) and fight against child labor (also considered FORCIBLY taking options away from employers) and civil rights (FORCING businesses to serve people they didn't want to) and because people built roads (paid for mainly by FORCED taking of taxes) and because we have free education (taken FORCIBLY) and on and on.  And I also realized that kindness and care are more important than my own (perceived) individual right to every penny I earn (which is a strange concept since this is entirely sanctioned by government).  And not only more important morally, by in fact, it makes everyone richer and more peaceful (see the scandanavian countries again).  The thing is, Americans will never accept super high taxes like the scandanavians do -- and I accept that as a sad reality (although given how appalling our American representatives are, perhaps there's an argument to be made that it wouldn't work IN OUR mean country).  But maybe you should just ask yourself why the Scandinavians in general like their system.  Very few are rushing here for political asylum.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418935476", "subreddit": "vermont", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The vast majority of the time, the singer is singing notes related to the *chords* of the song. For example, a G major chord is made of notes G, B and D.

These are of course generalisations; folk music influences classical, which influences folk as you trace back through the history of both. *Chromatic* harmony (3rd paragraph) was introduced by neo-classical composers of the early 20th century, but was popularised by the blues, and really expanded upon by jazz.\n\nAs pop music is a great melting pot of all that came before it, there are no rules, but you are most likely to find chordal tones in a pop song, followed by the less likely modal tones, followed by the least likely chromatic tones.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418948683", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Definitely check that one out. If you're a fan of her stuff with Dean Blunt then this will most likely be right up your alley. I mean, even Pitchfork put a track from that record on their top 100 Tracks. \n\nYeah it's a bit rough around the edges. I loved the abrasive tone though, and it truly feels honest when B L A C K I E's shouting his lungs out. My only real complaint is that it does get a bit samey and the two long tracks are a bit too long. They don't really accomplish anything that they couldn't have done in five minutes less. Also the last track feels out of place and kind of forced when the opener starts of so strongly lyrically (if you can call the monologue that).\n\nI might aswell add two other unique acts that I haven't seen get enough attention on the internet. First there's the plundercore act [Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAzvSZhWMAY) who's an Asian producer that fuses Nujabes with Dilla via samples. He's got a huge output and a lot is hit and miss, but some tracks are incredibly beautiful and some are technically impressive. Pitchfork hyped him up for a while but he was quickly forgotten about.\n\nThere's also one of my absolute favorites of this year. Emo/post-punkish album from a Lyon-based band. Second favorite of the year and probably my most played of the year. Not much depth to it but I can't stop playing this one.

{"body": "For most weapons, you want four V polarities, and two dashes. This lets you put just about any combination of mods on any weapon. Each weapon is going to be different, and somewhere in the modding process you might decide certain mods appeal more to you, so you go a different direction. Over all, it's all about personal preference. \n\nIn the case of the Dread you want to add two Vs and two dashes. This gives you the V V V V ~ ~ combination you want. Ideally, one row needs to be all Vs going from left to right, and then the second row needs to be dash, blank, dash, blank. This lets you mix and match your elements in any combination. In this build you'd only need four forma. On the other hand, to do this same build on the Braton Prime you'd need six forma since it has no polarities to speak of. \n\nSo.

{"body": "My realization of how this works came from actually studying scores to see how composers did it, because terms like \"borrowing\" (while technically accurate) are quite vague until you actually know what you're looking for in a piece. \n\nLet's take C Major and its chord classifications.\n\n     C D E F G A B C\n     CEG, DFA, EGB, FAC, GBD, ACE, BDF\n      I    ii  iii   IV   V    vi  viio\n\nAny scale has a series of relative scales that \"share\" common features. We don't call them \"relative\" scales. We call them \"parallel,\" meaning by generic letter, they are ordered in the exact same way, letter by letter. The \"parallel\" minor of C Major is C Minor. By generic letter name, they are ordered in the exact same sequence:\n\n     Major: C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C\n     Minor: C  D  Eb F  G  Ab Bb C\n\nOf course, these two scales don't contain the exact same \"pitches,\" which makes them distinctly different. We in fact \"lower\" the third, sixth, and seventh pitches of any major scale to end up with the parallel minor. And this is all we get from this concept, right? Nope!\n\nThese scales have more parallel scales associated with them - our MODES:\n\n     Major:      C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C\n     Lydian:     C  D  E  F# G  A  B  C\n     Mixolydian: C  D  E  F  G  A  Bb C\n\nOur Minor scale also has relative... oh, I'm sorry, I mean \"parallel\" scales specific to it:\n\n     Minor:    C  D  Eb F  G  Ab Bb C\n     Dorian:   C  D  Eb F  G  A  Bb C\n     Phrygian: C  Db Eb F  G  Ab Bb C\n\nMind you, there are other ways people teach modes, but the way I USE modes, thus pulling notes from outside the key I'm in at any point, is the exact same as the concept of \"parallel\" scales. And this just scratches the surface, since major, minor, and their modes are also applicable to any kind of chord.\n\nSay I have a chord, CEG, and I really like how the F# sounds in my melody when I hit this chord but don't understand why it works. It's really simple - CEG basically gives us the major quality (just like in the C Major scale) so any related... err, \"parallel\" scale to C Major will fit the chord. The F# fits because C Lydian (parallel to C Major) shares so much in common to C Major. We could be in Bb Major, end up with a C Major chord (secondary dominant) in the progression, and drop in an F#. It doesn't even matter what key you're in, so long as the chord you're using (whether major or minor) uses pitches from one of its parallel scales. \n\nEven THAT doesn't completely cover everything we can do with the 12 pitches of the tonal syntax. We have \"function\" in each key that unites chords within one key to chords in a related... doh! \"PARALLEL\" scale. Check out our chords for Major:\n\n     CMaj Dmin Emin FMaj GMaj Amin Bdim CMaj\n       I   ii   iii  IV   V    vi  viio I\n\nCheck out our chords for Minor:\n\n     Cmin Ddim EbMaj Fmin Gmin AbMaj BbMaj\n      i    iio bIII   iv   v    bVI  bVII\n\nLet's also take one of our parallel scales for minor, our C Phrygian scale: \n\n     Cmin DbMaj EbMaj Fmin Gdim AbMaj Bbmin\n      i    bII  bIII   iv   vo   bVI   vii\n\nFrom these three parallel scales, we can construct a \"Supermajor\" key like so:\n\n     C Db   Eb  F  G Ab  Bb\n     I bII bIII IV V bVI bVII\n\nWe simply \"substitute\" the bII for our ii, our bIII for iii, bVI for vi, and bVII for vii^o to get this sound. Listen to the Fellowship theme from Lord of the Rings (the one where the Fellowship of the Ring leaves Rivendell to begin their journey). This is achieved because we don't have to preserve the diatonicism of any one key as long as we preserve the \"functional logic\" of the progression. As long as we use any related... DAMNIT, \"PARALLEL\" chord... ugh! from a parallel key in the same functional way, our key is still preserved. Our tonal center (or sometimes the expectation of it) remains, even when we pull chords from parallel scales, as long as we preserve the logic of the progression. \n\nSimply put:\n\n     CMaj FMaj Dmin G7 CMaj\n     I    IV   ii   V7 I\n\nAnd this:\n\n     CMaj Fmin Dmin DbMaj CMaj\n     I    iv   ii   bII   I\n\n... are functionally equal. Both preserve the order of function as each chord progresses to the next. So, this is yet another way in which we can end up with notes from \"outside\" our key. And this is also incomplete, because chords relate to each other by common tones. I don't even need to \"match\" my roman numerals to preserve function, either. \n\nIt's important to understand that chords within a single key are quite \"relative\" to each other - each chord is related in some way to another within a key by \"common tones.\" These are notes that chords share in common, so with CEG, we see that ACE and EGB relate to CEG. Both share E in common while one shares C and the other shares G. It's not a far stretch for us to keep some tones common and manipulate others, say, by moving them by a half-step. CEG and AbCEb still share C in common. CEG and EbGBb still share G in common. \n\nPreserving a common tone preserves the connection of our parallel scales. A single tone in common with another can be all that's needed to preserve the connection of any chord to any other chord, regardless of how it might function within a progression. There is plenty more to be said, but I've given you more than enough to chew on for now. \n\nI'm sorry it's such a long explanation, but you weren't really asking a very simple question and my comment is already overwhelming. At the very least, I hope this sets you on the path to understanding how it all works. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418958577", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

You guessed it, C major scale.\n\nLet's conjure up the three most important chords that pop music nowadays likes to use: I - IV - V (tonic - subdominant - dominant). \n\nWhat are these chords in the key of C major?\n\n    I  = C-E-G\n    IV = F-A-C\n    V  = G-B-D\n\nBut we want these chords to be in D dorian mode right? What we do next is to use these chords but add the D in the bass, so that our ears are tricked into believing that the tonal center is D, and **not** C.\n\nSo essentially we now have:\n\n     C/D (C major triad with the D in the bass)\n     F/D (F major triad with the D in the bass)\n     G/D (G major triad with the D in the bass)\n\nOr if you want to think in lead sheet symbols especially if you're a guitarist:\n\n     C/D = D9sus4\n     F/D = Dmin7\n     G/D = Dm6sus4\n\nNow let's come up with a rad chord progression! I think the best sounding one is the IV-V-IV-I, just because I like to have the seventh chord in root position (Dmin^7) first, just to establish that the tonal center is D. \n\n        Dmin7       Dm6sus4     Dmin7       D9sus4\n    ||: F/D . . . | G/D . . . | F/D . . . | C/D . . . :||\n\nYou can definitely use other chord progressions. Try experimenting!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1418964577", "subreddit": "indonesia", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can always start with a general pattern, create a lot of words, and then work backwards from words you like and come up with a more precise pattern later.\n\nAt any rate, I do like doing more complicated things, I find it interesting. Old Azen's syllable structure, for example, is (copied from my ConWorkShop pages):\n\n(C(j)|Sr|Fl)V(:)(j)(C|NS|rS)\n\nwhere S is a stop: /p b t d k g/ (or, in the case of the coda, /t͡ʃ/)\nand N is a nasal: /m n ŋ/\nand F is a fricative: /s h/\nand /j/ never both precedes and follows a vowel.\n\nTo break this down into plain English, a typical syllable consists of an optional consonant for the onset, a vowel, and an optional consonant for the coda. The vowel may be either long or short, and may be either preceded or followed by the glide /j/ (but not both).\n\nThe onset may alternately consist of a stop followed by /r/, or of a fricative followed by /l/. The coda may alternately consist of /r/ followed by a stop, or of a nasal followed by a stop or t͡ʃ (which starts with a stop anyway). However, not all nasals are allowed for all stops! The nasal matches the point of articulation for the stop. Therefore, /mp mb nt nd nt͡ʃ ŋk ŋg/ are all allowed, but something like /mg/ is not.\n\nAll consonants are allowed in both the onset and the coda. A syllable will never have the form SrVrS. FlVl is OK, though. (for example, **hlal** (to break a bone))\n\nThere's also gemination for consonants, only allowed between vowels and only if the preceding vowel is short.

Wanted to pick Taeja over Classic but needed a protoss, and Classic will probably see lots of play time. Flash goes without saying. Bomber is a really solid pick for 5 points. Losira is a little iffy but he's showed strong play recently enough at HSC and in the qualifiers for HSC, so I think it's a reasonable 3 point gamble. Cure finally started to show how good he really is last year, and I trust him to continue.

{"body": "**1. Thou - Heathen**\n\nThis one has been at the top of my list basically since its release. It does everything right when it comes to doom – glacial pace, titanic riffs, and crushing atmosphere. Combine that with anarchist leanings and tremendous songwriting ability and you have the latest record from a band that’s peak of their form. The standout track to me is “Into the Marshlands” – the riff that shows up about halfway through is absolutely monstrous and it encapsulates everything I love about the group – it’s driving, bruising, and incredibly heavy but you still get a sense of arcane purpose from it. On top of that, the lyrics really hit home. Despite this not really being a facet of songwriting that I look for in metal, some of these words really resonated with me, especially in a year where I became more politically aware and increasingly hopeless about the state of my society. *We are the stone that starts the avalanche/We are the cough that spreads the plague/We are the spark that lights the inferno.* [GOOD SOUNDING] to the max. \n \n**2. Swallowed – Lunarterial**\n\nI loved this record just because it was so fucking weird. As sort of a counterpoint to Heathen, I couldn’t understand any of the lyrics here, and I’m fairly sure they aren’t even in English. But that honestly doesn’t matter, because the sound of Lunarterial is just straight up fucking strange. It sounds like an acid trip gone wrong, it’s got noises where there shouldn’t be noises, and it’s imbued with an alien quality that makes it seem otherworldly. It’s crazy and demented, and it’s got the riffs to back it up. I love the death/doom overlap, and the parts of “Black Phlegm” that slow things down are mesmerizing. The ending of “Libations” is killer – noise rock meets death metal meets psych all wrapped up in a terrific riff and a swingy beat. Really unique record, and after dozens of listens I haven’t gotten tired of it yet. \n\n**3. The Body – I Shall Die Here**\n\nThis record actually scared me. I suppose I shouldn’t expect any less from The Body, but they are one of the few bands that really have the capability to be unsettling. The Haxan Cloak’s production job is stellar, and this record is probably more of a collaboration than the title suggests. As someone who listens to plenty of dark ambient and noise, this is the perfect melding of the two styles – it’s not derisive towards either one (lookin’ at you, Full of Hell &amp; Merzbow), and it balances the electronic scrapes with sludge heft perfectly. On top of that, you have The Body’s general preoccupation with suicide and self-harm, though not in the DSBM-esque sense, where it sometimes comes across as comical. The self-loathing on this record feels tangible, as if it’s right next to your ears, poisoning your mind in addition to warping your senses. A truly unnerving listen, but equally fascinating. \n\n**4. YOB – Clearing the Path to Ascend**\n\nRiffs upon riffs, followed by some more riffs, and then a few more riffs. Yob fucking rule. This record has the potential to be their best work – it hasn’t really had the time to sink in for me yet, so I can’t really compare it to their other works, but holy fucking shit. Even on its own it’s monumental in scope, yet still feels intimate. Most of Yob’s albums deal with Zen Buddhism in one way or another, but this one is a little bit more in your face about it – there are quotes by Alan Watts (the intro to the record has a terrific sample of him saying “It’s time to wake up.”) and each track deals with various aspects of reality and its constructs. “Marrow” is probably the best closing to any of the albums on this list. \n\n**5. Blut Aus Nord – Memoria Vetusta III: Saturnian Poetry**\n\nI actually thought there would be more black metal on my list. I’m sure I’m forgetting more than a few that deserve it, but this is one that really really stood out to me. BAN took a few cues from their Cascadian friends without going full WITTR, and it really, really paid off. This is how “atmosphere” should be done. It’s not overbearing, it doesn’t take precedence over the songwriting, and most of all it doesn’t obscure the riffs. This record is mind-bendingly good. I normally don’t go for any sort of “melodic” black metal, but this really hit the mark. They even went into choral ode territory. It’s fucking great. \n\n**Honorable mentions**: I’m sure some of these deserve to be on the year end list, and if I’m being honest, I picked the 5 that stood out to me at the time of this writing, and it’s by no means an accurate or exhaustive list. \n\n•\tOld Man Gloom – The Ape(s) of God – Holy fucking shit yeah these are great, but it’s only been out for a month and I haven’t really had the time to let them sink in.\n\n•\tDead Congregation – Started with hype, remained at constant hype levels, didn’t really affect me as much as it did some others here. But damn if that riff on “Serpentskin” isn’t totally fucking rad.\n\n•\tIndian – From All Purity – Another really grimy sludge record that probably deserves a spot on the list. It’s fucking great, go listen to it.\n\n•\tFister/Primitive Man split – More sludge. Sludge is good, sludge is great. Cut lengthwise, not across.\n\n•\tBen Frost – A U R O R A – This is actually my album of the year, but it’s not metal so it’s not on the main list. It’s hypnotizing and entrancing and I love every second of it.\n\n•\tRaspberry Bulbs – Privacy – It’s not quite Bone Awl, but it’s damn good and it scratches my punk itch. \n\n•\tKall – s/t – I don’t listen to DSBM unless I’m in a bad mood or feeling depressed, but this record struck me a really unique in the way it manipulates black metal forms and played with the textures we would normally hear.\n\n•\tSymptom – Caverns of Katabasis – RIFFS, FUCKING RIFFS FOR DAYS (and some piano) BUT THEN MORE RIFFS. It’s fucking awesome, JT is a monster.\n\n•\tDeath Fortress – Among the Ranks of the Unconquerable – Yup. There it is, I knew I forgot a black metal release somewhere. It’s fucking [GOOD SOUNDING]. Don’t sleep on it. \n\n•\tTeitanblood – Death – Yeah it’s Teitanblood, they’re doing their thing. This didn’t really resonate with me as much as I assumed it would. Weird as it is, I loved the slow-burn ambient part that makes up a lot the closing track. That was fucking cool, but it wasn’t really an integral part of the record. \n\n•\tTriptykon – Melana Chasmata – A few incredible tracks, a few filler tracks. I actually really dig Tom Warrior’s voice. He’s got a fantastic range and he basically pioneered the vocal style of most extreme metal. Very solid, but not groundbreaking in the same way Eparistera Daimones was. \n\n•\tWrekmeister Harmonies – Then It All Came Down – God damn it this list is getting really long. I enjoyed a lot of shit this year. This drone release really took me places. I love the way that the tones feel grounded in the physical (maybe that’s due to the metal influence) rather than the Hecker-esque ethereal tones that are becoming more popular.\n\n**Superlatives**\n\nAlbum(s) that didn't appear on your list but was probably played more than most: *Darkspace III IIIIIIIIIII*\n\nAlbum(s) that you could't get into despite multiple attempts and desire to be apart of the hype: *Ecdysis* - the first track was so good and then the rest of them were just meh\n\nMost Overhyped: *The Serpent and the Sphere* - basically what amounts to a victory lap for Agalloch, boring as hell.\n\nMost Overlooked: *Abalam* - Hexis fucking rips. End of story. Can't believe I barely saw them mentioned.\n\nAlbum you didn't know came out until looking at this thread: *Spiritual Independence* - Time to go buy it I guess\n\nEasiest Pick for Instant Metal Cred: Deafheaven put out a new song didn't they?\n\nFucking hell this was a huge mental exercise. I’m sure I forgot a ton of shit, feel free to reply to me and tell me how garbage my list is and let me know why X album does/doesn’t deserve to be there. I hate making lists.\n\nEdit: I forgot Godflesh and Gridlink. I suck.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419085816", "subreddit": "Metal", "score": 41, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Gone through this list so many times that it's getting kind of dull to write it since there's only so many different ways I can describe these records. Doing my top 9 since my 50 would take far too long. I still need validation for my taste though so I'll write it again.\n\n**[9. Inga Copeland - Because I'm Worth It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pse2TOVAkT8)**\n\nVery nuanced album taking cues from lots of different places, minimal tech house, industrial etc. Would have expected something more in the vein of her and Dean Blunt's Hype Williams releases but this one blows most of those out of the water. Advice To Young Girls is terrific I mean even Pitchfork liked this one, which I didn't expect since they haven't been too big on her or Dean Blunt's music previously. Blows Black Metal out of the water aswell.\n\n**8. [Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbMy-mXMH-0)**\n\nIn my opinion a step up from the first Run The Jewels. El-P spits better, beats are more varied, beats also go fucking hard. Just which there was more comical value to the lyrics like on the first album and many of Killer Mike's songs (which song is the one where he raps about having a tiny dick or something?). Is it the best of the year? Hardly. Is it *one* of the best of the year? Hell yeah.\n\n**[7. D/P/I - MN.ROY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzimsE8_DKg)**\n\nVery cool glitch record with a lot going on. Kind of hard to digest at first playthrough but I'll be damned if this wasn't one of the most interesting releases of the year.\n\n**[6. Hundred Waters - The Moon Rang Like A Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-8Oa2t4Ro)**\n\nThis one was incredibly quickly forgotten about in my opinion. Have barely seen this one mentioned at all these last few months which I think is a shame since it's a perfect blend of witch-house with more folk-ier, almost slow-core music. Nicole Miglis' has an absolutely gorgeus voice and it's all so comfy. \n\n**[5. Bing &amp; Ruth - Tomorrow Was The Golden Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri5h_vMGmH8)**\n\nPiano-focused minialism at it's finest. Super pretty and incredibly relaxing. Don't think I've found anything that sounds as gorgeus as this record does this year.\n\n**[4. B L A C K I E - Imagine Your Self In A Free Natural World](http://blackieallcapswithspaces.bandcamp.com/album/imagine-your-self-in-a-free-and-natural-world-2014)**\n\nAbrasive, noisy, harsh, tough to digest. Imagine Your Self In A Free Natural World is an angry kid screaming his lungs out over 15-minute long free jazz pieces. If you're looking for experimental, angry, chaotic, and \"in your fucking face\" then this is what you need in your life.\n\n**[3. Swans - To Be Kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSdTBGhDSg)**\n\nThey've done it again. To Be Kind might be their most accessible record to date but it's still god damn great and up there as one of their best releases throughout their career. Who thought Gira would amount to two albums like The Seer and To Be Kind after reuniting the band? I sure as hell didn't. Swans blew me away once again and from what I've heard at their live show, they're bound to blow me away yet again once their next LP drops.\n\n**[2. Sport - Bon Voyage](http://sport.bandcamp.com/)**\n\nEmo of the year. Lyon-based band makes American sounding emo that takes cues from more modern post-punk releases pulling the catharsis to 110%. Very melodic and with a ton of replay value. \n\n**1. Sun Kil Moon - Benji**\n\nAlbum of the year, and maybe even my favorite from this decade so far. It's just so heartfelt, honest and beautiful. Won't write too much about this one since you all know it. Haven't been this touched by an album since I first heard Pink Moon. It's hard to find this sincerity and this much melancholy and sadness packed this tightly on an album, but Sun Kil Moon nails it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419098591", "subreddit": "indieheads", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Mi dispiace per il ritardo, ma devo rispondere a tanti!\n\nComunque, brevemente:\nsembra una cazzata, qualcosa per cui, forse, le altre persone non starebbero male.\nMa io, da marzo 2014, ho avuto un periodo assolutamente di m e r d a. \nSono stata lasciata dal mio ragazzo per colpa dei suoi genitori.\nCosì, all'improvviso, dopo che mi sono trasferita da Roma (studiavo lì ma ho avuto seri problemi con l'uni) nella sua città, in Campania.\nI suoi non l'hanno presa bene, non so perché, e tutt'ora mi ritrovo a starci male.\nNon riesco a \"chiudere\" totalmente con lui. Io ora studio in Campania e abito nella sua città.\nI suoi amici ormai sono miei amici, mi sono sistemata molto bene e sarebbe davvero, davvero brutto dover chiudere le cose col mio ex ed uscire nuovamente tutti in gruppo. Lo vedrei sempre. Lo vedo per andare all'uni. Non è cosa staccarci, anche perché abbiamo comunque un bellissimo rapporto, che non si può evolvere perché ha paura di essere sgamato dai genitori (sì, fanno casino se continuiamo a sentirci, come se io fossi un mostro! Bello eh?)\n\nDa quel mese ho seri problemi d'ansia/panico, mi sento male per TUTTO.\nNon riesco a stare calma per nulla. Se non c'è lui al mio fianco mi sento morire.\nA casa dai miei non torno perché non sto bene con loro, nonostante voglia loro bene. Ho bisogno dei miei spazi e qui, attualmente, sto bene. Mi piace la città, ha costi bassi (tra vitto e alloggio) e la gente è simile a me, non come nel mio paese natale.\n\nMa in ogni caso, sento tutti distanti. Forse sono io che non mi sono ancora amalgamata bene a loro? Fatto sta che non riesco a vivere senza il mio ex.\nMi è sempre vicino, sono grata a lui di questo.. Ma è ovvio che il mio cuore voglia di più. A me continuerà a piacere sempre, non smetterò mai. Perché non ci siamo lasciati perché non ci piacevamo più, ma per colpa di altre persone. Quindi per motivi non \"seri\", insomma, nel senso che sono fattori esterni.\nE ciò mi fa malissimo. Mi fa sentire inferiore, un mostro..\nPerché dopo due anni di relazione succede questo?\nPerché proprio quando mi sistemo vicina a lui, devo ricevere un palo del genere..?\n\nPiù passa il tempo e più ho paura del mio futuro. Non voglio saperlo, perché so che farà male. Lui mi abbandonerà completamente, magari per un'altra donna che ai genitori andrà bene. E questo mi ucciderà, lo so.\nHo già avuto comportamenti anomali di autolesionismo.\nMa fortunatamente non è stato nulla di che. Lui è stato lì ad aiutarmi in questo momento.\nE' un controsenso.. Sto male PER lui ma sto bene se c'è lui.\nLa mia testa scoppia. Non so più a cosa pensare.\n\nE questa cosa degli attacchi di panico/ansia mi sta facendo delirare.\nSto avendo pure problemi di soldi, a gestirmeli da sola, ma preferisco digiunare qualche giorno che chiedere altro ai miei, che già fanno tanto. Ma gestirseli da soli è davvero difficile, soprattutto se non ho un discount dalle mie parti in cui fare la spesa, quindi devo farla \"a costo pieno\".\nPeccato che, durante questi mesi e questa \"depressione\", ho preso 10 chili. Mi sono rifugiata nel cibo spazzatura. Non cucino ormai da mesi. Continuo a mangiare trash. Se mi guardassi dall'esterno mi prenderei in giro per ciò che sto facendo.\nSO cosa sto facendo. Ma non riesco a smettere. Non voglio perderlo, anche se mi fa male questa situazione.\n\n...ma forse è anche colpa mia che mi sono fatta prendere dalla depressione e non sorridevo mai in sua presenza. Cercavo sempre la sua compagnia. Gli rompevo le palle ogni giorno, ero morbosa. Gli davo fastidio. Ma ha comunque continuato a starmi vicino.\nForse, se avessi resistito a quel dolore e avessi sorriso, lui sarebbe tornato con me e avrebbe avuto il coraggio di lottare contro i suoi.\nMa evidentemente gli ho fatto perdere quel poco di interesse che aveva nell'ultimo periodo prima di separarci. \nEd è tutta colpa mia. E, realizzando ciò, mi sento ancora peggio.\nMa per \"riparare\" a questo, sorriderò anche se mi sentirò morire. Mi sono stufata di mordermi la goda girandomi attorno. Ho perso una probabile possibilità.\n\nMeglio stare male dentro e tenersi tutto per sé. Anche se boh.. ormai è tardi. Ormai non tornerà più da me.\n\n..quindi che senso ha continuare? Mi sta infettando tutto nella vita. Sto perdendo la voglia di seguire i corsi all'uni. Sto perdendo la voglia di uscire di casa. Mi chiudo in camera e, dopo giorni che non esco, mi rendo conto di quanto sia sporca e di quanto lo sia io. Mi sveglio, alle 16 e mi sistemo. Sistemo camera. Me stessa. Penso di stare meglio.. E poi ci ripenso di nuovo. E di nuovo il periodo di hiatus.\n\nScusate per il romanzo. Ci sarebbe molto altro da dire, ma per ora non mi prolungo.\n\nSe avete domande, rispondo molto volentieri. Questa è la mia situazione, questo è ciò che penso.\nMi scuso in anticipo se sto deprimendo molti di voi &gt;_&lt; sono davvero una pessima persona; ero solare ed allegra, gentile con tutti. Ora sono tutt'altro.. Perché ho permesso alla mia vita di dipendere da una persona e ora ne sto pagando le conseguenze.\nAlla fine, sempre colpa mia è.

{"body": "Let's talk about structure! Let's talk about stress pattern! Let's closely examine the meter and rhythm of a free verse poem (said no one ever)! Yes, this poem--like many in the imagist tradition--eschews flowery language in favor of \"direct treatment of the thing,\" as if they were members of the Basho school of haiku. Yes, this poem is a return to the true lyrical tradition of Sappho (poems of personal life) as opposed to the epic tradition of Homer, Milton, et. al. (poems of grand public figures). But, beyond the historical context, there is a quiet genius in the structure. Williams himself argued, years later, that the imagist movement \"failed\" in part because it lacked a structural component. For his part, he tried to remedy this through the invention of the stepped triadic line (Google it, it's a thing). Anywho a rough outline of the stress pattern of the poem looks like this: i u i u / u i / u i u/ u i u // u i / i u i u u / i u / u i u // u i u / i u u i u / u i / u u i (i for stressed syllable and u for unstressed). Please excuse the lack of formatting; I'm on mobile. This is not definitive by any means. You could make arguments, for example, that \"icebox\" should be two stressed syllables instead of stressed-unstressed. Without going into too much detail, look at how unassuming and humble this poem is! So many unstressed syllables--it practically begs to be whispered. You don't even have to dig deep to notice how many lines begin with the/that/and. Why would he do that? Perhaps to mimic everyday language. Perhaps to speed us through the poem. Perhaps to draw attention to what really matters here. You'll notice that in the few lines that begin with stressed syllables, those words are \"I\" \"you\" and \"saving.\" This then is what matters: the relationship between the you and the I; the intention to save and the denial of that intention. What an intimate poem, a regular Hills Like White Elephants, if you've read your Hemingway. But the actual genius is that the syllabic structure reinforces the thematics. The syllables are as unassuming as a note stuck to the fridge. The stresses are often buried in the middle of the line, even held off till the very end, as if to hide their shame.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419108955", "subreddit": "Poetry", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

I don't care if I only get the usual salad or pasta dishes, variety is out there (and sometimes not.... but hey, it's still out there). Also, meat has made me feel groggy for y e a r s and more indecisive.\n\nThis used to be a weight loss thing for me, but then I grew to seeing it as a better life choice.

Invoke EMP when you are level 4.  Once you have 3 in Wex, Invoke Tornado, and use EMP - &gt; Tornado liberally.  Don't roam for ganks until you get Orchids.  Carry a TP to countergank with Tornado - &gt; EMP (use this order when you have 4 in Q) whenever your lanes are in trouble.  \n\nOnce you have Orchids, Invoke Cold Snap and then Ghost Walk and roam for ganks if they have fragile heroes.  If they are grouping up, just have Tornado - &gt; EMP ready and push as 5.\n\nMost Invoker players will build something bad like Sheep, but you need physical damage.  If you are doing well, the other team will all build BKBs, so you need to be able to do damage through spell immunity.  You are also bad and pushing towers, so you need an item that helps with that.  What fits both of these requirements?  Desolator!  This also makes you able to solo kill almost anybody if you catch them while Ghost Walking, and lets you take rosh quickly.\n\nAfter Desolator, build whatever utility item your team needs.  Sheep is good, Shivas or AC are great, and Skadi is good vs BKB heroes.  Get a Diffusal if you are vs an Omni, and get MKB if you are against WR, Riki, PA, Brew, or Butterfly.  Always keep your orbs in Wex for MS and AS.\n\nIn fights, your early game combo is Tornado &gt; EMP &gt; Cold Snap.\n\nLategame, your priority should be Tornado &gt; EMP &gt; Deafening Blast &gt; Meteor &gt; Ice Wall &gt; Cold Snap.  If they have BKBs, use Blast to kill them before they pop BKB.\n\nDon't worry about being flashy or trying to use all 10 spells.

{"body": "I just read Brasso's comment and please dont do that... He does not know how akali works. Most important thing is to survive until 6. Not just survive but get the same xp as your opponent. Trust me, you should almost never go Dorans shield 1 pot. If I was playimg against you, I'd just never stop trading with you until you have to back and I'll get that xp advantage. As akali you want to level up 6 at least at the same time as your opponent. Dont be affraid to ask for ganks pre-6. If you get a kill pre-6... Oh boy. Akali can snowball really hard. I usually start either cloth armor 5 pots (vs range) or long sword 3 pots (vs melee). Then build on the bilgewater (not revolver since her passive gives her spellvamp with AD a and bilgewater has an active) into hextech. You usually farm with Q until 6. Dont be afraid to smoke to get the 40 gold minion. If you smoke, most likely, your opponent will back off. Probably scared of your jungler. Wards with Akali are important since a counter gank will be in your favor. Max order : R Q E W. Once you hit 6, you have to wait for 2 stacks. One can work too , but with 2 stacks, youll probably get a kill or a flash. The Q spell does a lot of damage so dont just Q R E R R. Wait for the other Q spell to be available. But if your enemy is low enough, dash again without the mark and kill him. Dont forget you get an extra dash after killing an enemy which makes tower diving pretty easy. Dive, kill, get the extra dash, dash on an enemy minion outside the turret. Heres the combo when you hit 6. Since the mark lasts 6 seconds and the Q cooldown is lower. The best thing to do is throw a Q. Wait 4 seconds (to have the second Q ready). R, autoattack (activates the mark), Q (mark a second time), E (activates the second mark). This way, with one dash, youll get 70% hps of your enemy. You can then active bilgewater, wait for the 3rd Q. Dash and kill. Once you get 2/3 kills with akali the rest of the game is easy. Build Hextech/Sorc boots/Zhonya/Lich Bane (if you want to burst hard), etc. Akali has insanely high base damage which makes her really strong without any items. You can also go for abyssal if needed.

{"body": "Your thread is kind of old but I stumbled across it looking at some redditor's comment history. Just want to say that in order to make this move, you'll want to understand your instrument on a really really basic, mechanical level, where you start to understand what each note in a scale can bring to a song, and you can literally hear the note in the song before you play it so you know it's right.\n\nFor example, it doesn't matter what scale it is, I know that one half step and then one whole step down from the base chord is going to be the minor chord. one whole step down from that is the unresolved chord (in a C scale it's  G for example, or Bmajor in an E scale) and then one down from that is kinda like my chill out, contemplative, resty chord, which interacts very well with the base chord (C scale this chord is F, E scale it would be Amaj).\n\nOnce you start to get an imagery, a color, or a feeling from each note in the major scale, it doesn't matter where the base chord is or what key you're playing in, the shit is all the same, it just has a different mood depending on what key you're in. \n\nIMO, the BEST way to learn how to do this is to improv jam with friends. Improvisation is a self-teaching tool that can lead to new creations, deep knowledge of your instrument, and lots of fun and entertainment.\n\nTell your friend with a guitar to play the same 3 chords in the same rhythm over and over again. Jam out to it. See what sounds good with each chord. Arpeggiate the chords on your bass as he strums them on guitar. Now add in some accent notes that are not in the arpeggio for the chord. Build structures in your head, repeat them, but have one variable note that changes each time you get to it's spot. For example when someone is strumming Am, F, G... play these notes\n\n(Am) C C C C B B G G ... (F) C C C C B B F F (G) C C C C B B E E\n\nThat's just an example, make up new structures and make 2 variables, or just come up with patterns in your head for each chord and play the pattern when he plays that chord. DO whatever you want! The strumming guitar is like your blank canvas.

St. Vinnie's set was mindblowing as expected but this was when I really fell in love with Herndon. I knew about her before this but I didn't get her until her set. wow. \n\n(2) The Decemberists at Boston Calling - one of my favorite bands of all time, their first show as a band in a few years (the drummer had cancer for a little while), it was magical\n\n(3) Kitten opened by Kitty (fka Pryde) - Kitty is the biggest dweeb of a performer I've ever seen, she spent most of the show sitting down on a couch hugging a MLP doll and forgot some lyrics but, y'know, it worked, I enjoyed her set, space-y rap/singing, like an American S A D B O Y 2004. Kitten, however, is the most energetic performer I've ever seen. I swear, that woman does not stop moving. She's wild. She's a magnetic performer. She's also really talented and makes really good music, new wave-y synth rock. \n\n(4) Modest Mouse at Boston Calling - performed all their biggest hits and a bunch of deep cuts and some new (at the time) material, good stuff, crazy crowd\n\n(5) Little Daylight - Baby Chvrches but better (that's right i said it), really fun synth pop, just a wildly energetic show\n\n(6) Charli XCX for Sucker- would be higher but I was not a fan of the openers at all (Femme and Elliphant, worst openers I've seen for her, considering the other two times it was Little Daylight and Kitten), she played all her Sucker material a few months before we heard the album and it was really cool \n\n(7) White Lung - this show was just at a bad time, it was at a college bar in a college town the day after basically all of the college student apartment leases end so everyone was exhausted from moving so the crowd energy was bad. Mish Way is insane though so they still put on a good show. \n\n(8) Tegan and Sara at Boston Calling - music 10/10 stage banter 10/10 a lot of fun, Tegan and Sara are a great live band. \n\n(9) Andrew Jackson Jihad - Christmas Island material, angsty teenaged nerds everywhere, AJJ moshpits are the weirdest, fun though\n\n(10) Tigerman Woah! - bluegrass punk band actually the best just a bunch of stupid fun [i mean check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9lTU5peSoE), is [this](http://youtu.be/DD-6IG4P96Q) not great?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419412662", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They are just numbers at the right look 0.0565063049684609843096834 then, you see why I am the Zero.\n\nCheck this out, put a 0 in front of any number you count. 2 million = \n\n02000000 &lt;---- 2 Million and 0 incrementation goes to the right for elevation purposes. 0 always remain at the beginning or you can use a false number...\n\nI L L U   M I N A T I\n\n1 2 3 4  5  6 7 8 9 1              0 { Eleve }\n\nThe Illu takes 4 digits... the 5 is the Illusion complete, for the Minati to start to bleed. Or the Illumination to be received. At the 5th sense. I have 10, eleven and also 12. \n\nSo you say, you can write Illuminati with 10 fingers, and they all count a 0 as well, restart the count and at 5 you get the illusion done, the circle, the open perfection the 3.14 that happened to be 3.5, the 4... the almost perfect... the scientist trait, the almost happened, they cannot reach certainty. With me they can... where's my Lab people?\n\nThat's why they go do what I transmit first, being the last one who proves anything like I did with Peter means I receive it first, as the last one I not only laugh as the last one, but provide and make sure all other shit copying at the right happened after I gave the Signal.\n\nSo I am always first for I am the last, it means I take in charge all these who during the middle stole my 0dayz or copies of my magnitude thinking, which is an IQ around 210 based on Ein. \n\n210 and continue expanding, I think my brain is around 20% usage, but I don't believe it... I think Einstein had 14% usage, people usually dig 3% to 9% depending on their opening and expansion among Neuronal Connectivity. \n\nThis due to higher receptors being alarmed and lighted, like bulbs under such magnetic mini camp, you can light anything at any time. We don't care too much for memory, as I said... who wants to remember 2 years wasted in this hell with all these bitches that don't take action watching.\n\nNow I have to set a meeting point again :( And I don't like that... Domiciliary please. \n\nAll Newspapers and Media are paid in here, increment their Sin Debt, like if there was anyone else in the World providing this quality papers on the Morpheus try at being nice.\n\nI am not nice Morpheus, I am Neo and you got me in a room with no ability to abuse the Matrix commerce and Gear. \n\nMatrices or Bulbs, Vulva's ... are a complex machine of creation. Starting with  Pi too, we give form to humans inside the Belly of the Mother Carrier. \n\nThe Matrix is a work of art, the power to incubate a child during 8-9 months is something really infinite... you're awake once you are born that's right it takes around 2 years for you to notice you're even born. Nervous system for the Fetus to feel anything at all? Around 6-7 months. So you can digest and provide secure abort at -3 months for not giving a bad quality to the newborn. \n\nAlso, retards are born out of bad practices during the pregnancy... so don't blame the President for his new body after dead. I say, the Matrix is the highest work of Art... even if I want to build some Wings based on Aerial Birds and design, I think the Matrix and the Vulva of the woman surpass anything we have ever seen in Nature.. the ability to give birth to people while my other half dead is in Zion... is just amazing.\n\nSo I am half dead, I died 2 years ago in a Motorcycle accident, you have been watching Jesus using the machine while I was half him. After such impact I became half dead, and half of me is in Zion that's why I can phone the Trinity... and half of me is in here that's why I can battle so many agents of change and environmental agents of dust. \n\n\nPi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~R", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419421259", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It's damn near perfect (if Birdman wasn't on We'll Be Fine, it'd be 10/10, easily), and the atmosphere is just godly. 9.5/10\n\n* **Sucker** by Charli XCX - This was... disappointing. The only songs I've been replaying recently are Boom Clap and Need Ur Luv, albeit both songs are really good. 5/10\n\n* **Untrue** by Burial - First time of listening, I can definitely see the appeal of this during the winter. 9/10\n\n* **Singles** by Future Islands - It's pretty good, but nothing holds up to Seasons. 8/10\n\n* **Kaleidoscope Dreams** by Miguel - This is better than channel ORANGE (no I didn't listen to this for the first time). 10/10\n\n* **Third** by Portishead - I've been meaning to get around to this, especially after listening to Belong to the World by The Weeknd. Pretty solid throughout. 8/10\n\n* **Nirvana** by Sam Smith - I've been really coming around to this, especially with the live version of I've Told You Now. The only shit song on here is Money On My Mind. 8.5/10\n\n* **We're New Here** by Gil Scott-Heron - Really good remix album. 9/10\n\n* **In the Aeroplane Over the Sea** by Neutral Milk Hotel - doievenneedtosayanything/10\n\n* **On Avery Island** by Neutral Milk Hotel - This was a little disappointing, but that's acceptable because this was their debut. 7/10\n\n* **The Voyager** by Jenny Lewis - Surprisingly solid album. 8.5/10\n\n* **What's Going On** by Marvin Gaye - 10/10\n\n* **In the Lonely Hour** by Sam Smith - Pop AOTY. His voice is smooth as fuck. 8.5/10\n\n* **Black Messiah** by D'Angelo &amp; the Vanguard - AOTY, bar none. Funky as fuck, it met every single expectation I had for it and still blew me away. 10/10\n\n* **Voodoo** by D'Angelo - Easily a classic. 10/10\n\n* **Some Nights** by fun. - I think I'm one of the only people who prefers this over Aim and Ignite. The first half is a bit iffy, but the second half is killer. 8.5/10\n\n##Album Of The Year:\n\n* D'Angelo &amp; The Vanguard - Black Messiah\n\n##Top 5:\n\n* Ben Frost - A U R O R A\n\n* Swans - To Be Kind\n\n* YG - My Krazy Life\n\n* Sam Smith - In the Lonely Hour\n\n##Some Other Albums That Were Really Good:\n\n* Run the Jewels - Run the Jewels 2\n\n* St. Vincent - s/t\n\n* Hozier - s/t\n\n* Travi$ Scott - Days Before Rodeo\n\n* J. Cole - 2014 Forest Hills Drive\n\n* Flying Lotus - You're Dead!\n\n##More Albums That Aren't As Good As The Ones Above But Are Still At Least 8/10:\n\n* Mary J. Blige - The London Sessions\n\n* Taylor Swift - 1989\n\n* FKA Twigs - LP1\n\n* Damon Albarn - Everyday Robots\n\n* Freddie Gibbs &amp; Madlib - Pinata\n\n* Future Islands - Singles\n\n* The War on Drugs - Lost In The Dream\n\n* Jenny Lewis - The Voyager\n\n* Azealia Banks - Broke With Expensive Taste\n\n##Albums I Should Probably Get Around To:\n\n* Mac DeMarco - Salad Days\n\n* Sun Kil Moon - Benji\n\n* Iceage - Plowing Into the Field of Love\n\n* Cloud Nothings - Here And Nowhere Else\n\n* Sharon Van Etten - Are We There\n\n[Really pitiful 5x5 for the year](http://puu.sh/dHMYY/f3e33cc93f.jpg)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419432348", "subreddit": "lewronggeneration", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Take that back. Chi Explosion is my heroin. \n\nOn a serious note, I run Healing Elixirs on every fight except for Ko'ragh, Twins and Bracken, where I run Diffuse Magic. Ko'ragh, I take it so that I can stand in the Suppression Fields while the adds die (plus the adds deal Arcane damage). Twins, I take it for the Blaze stacks, as I tend to take a couple when running Phemos out for whirlwind (Resolve FTW). Bracken, obvious deal.\n\nBecause our other tank is a Blood DK, I'm stuck with the bitch job of dealing with Mark.

Use Transcendence: Transfer to get away while boss is casting Mark. Place another Transcendence clone before running back in.\n\nPhase 4: Just run the fuck away.\n\nWe tend to vary out swaps, but it tends to be around 10-13 stacks.

(at least for me)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe jump scares\n\n\nI barely hear about the jumpscares in half life 1. but honestly they are there, but they aren't that scary, because by now where all used to it. i remeber one of the 1st enemies in the game would bang on a door, and you can see its dinting it. and your just thinking \"WHAT THE FU** IS ON THE OTHER SIDE!\" and then you see this small alien thing, you don't know anything about this creature, but it must be killed. and guess what this exact thing happens in doom 3.\n\nV V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V V \n\nIn doom 3 when you 1st meat a pinky, you walk into this room and press a button, then you get a cutsence of a pinky running into the room outsides yours and then boom back to gameplay and all you can do is wait, while it bangs on the door. eventually it gives up. and for a few seconds your like, \"okay... what now? did the game bug? OH CRAP!\" you see it run and brust through a window, and is now trying to bite one of your body parts off.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Good Npcs/ getting information\n\nIn both games the good npc give you information on what to do next, but they both don't relay on that to be the only way to send information both games trust your smart enough to work out what and how to do things, and infact there are very few good npcs in both games, don't belive me go play them again theres not as many stops to talk to npcs or cutsences for that matter. so doom has more, but they pretty quick. while doom dose give you a small prompt to tell you what to get, it doesn't tell you where it is. while in half life you will see power offline, a maybe a map on the wall of the area that your looking for. to help you on your way.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni could go on, but i think thats proves my point, that they kind of the same.\n\nplease keep in mind i like both games, i just find it silly that most people think that doom 3 isn't like the original half life at all. even though there's so many things the same. and honestly i think doom 3 is one of the better kind of new title out there. just because it doesn't make me feel stupid playing it.\n\nIf you read all this, YOU SIR ARE AWESOME! and sorry for the spelling mistakes. my English despite it being my 1st and only language is really bad.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419632973", "subreddit": "Doom", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\nSection 7. [**Systems for the twelve-note chromatic scale**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning#Systems_for_the_twelve-note_chromatic_scale) of article  [**Musical tuning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical%20tuning): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;It is impossible to tune the twelve-note [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) so that all [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music\\)) are \"perfect\". For instance, three \"perfect\" major thirds stack up to 125/64, which at 1158.9411 cents is nearly a quarter tone away from the octave. So there is no way to have both the octave and the major third in just intonation for all the intervals in the same twelve-tone system. Similar issues arise with the fifth 3/2, and the minor third 6/5 or any other choice of harmonic-series based \"perfect\" intervals.\n\n&gt;Many different compromise methods are used to deal with this, each with its own characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages.\n\n&gt;The main ones are:\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Just intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation)\n\n&gt;&gt;In just intonation, the frequencies of the scale notes are related to one another by simple numeric ratios, a common example of this being 1:1, 9:8, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 5:3, 15:8, 2:1 to define the ratios for the seven notes in a C major scale. In this example, though many intervals are pure, the interval from D to A (5:3 to 9:8) is 40/27 instead of the expected 3/2. The same issue occurs with most just intonation tunings. This can be dealt with to some extent using alternative pitches for the notes. Even that, however, is only a partial solution, as an example makes clear: If one plays the sequence C G D A E C in just intonation, using the intervals 3/2, 3/4 and 5/4, then the second C in the sequence is higher than the first by a [syntonic comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_comma) of 81/80. This is the infamous [\"comma pump\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_comma#Comma_pump). Each time around the comma pump, the pitch continues to spiral upwards. This shows that it is impossible to keep to any small fixed system of pitches if one wants to stack musical intervals this way. So, even with *adaptive tuning*, the musical context may sometimes require playing musical intervals that are not *perfect*. Instrumentalists with the ability to vary the pitch of their instrument may micro-adjust some of the intervals naturally; there are also systems for adaptive tuning in software ([microtuners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtuner)). Harmonic fragment scales form a rare exception to this issue. In tunings such as 1:1 9:8 5:4 3:2 7:4 2:1, all the pitches are chosen from the harmonic series (divided by powers of 2 to reduce them to the same octave), so all the intervals are related to each other by simple numeric ratios.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Pythagorean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning)\n\n&gt;&gt;A Pythagorean tuning is technically a type of just intonation, in which the frequency ratios of the notes are all derived from the number ratio 3:2. Using this approach for example, the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale would be tuned to the following ratios: 1:1, 256:243, 9:8, 32:27, 81:64, 4:3, 729:512, 3:2, 128:81, 27:16, 16:9, 243:128, 2:1. Also called \"3-limit\" because there are no prime factors other than 2 and 3, this Pythagorean system was of primary importance in Western musical development in the Medieval and Renaissance periods. As with nearly all just intonation systems, it has a [wolf interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_interval). In the example given, it is the interval between the 729:512 and the 256:243 (F# to Db, if one tunes the 1/1 to C). The major and minor thirds are also impure, but at the time when this system was at its zenith, the third was considered a dissonance, so this was of no concern. See also: [Shí-èr-lǜ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C3%AD-%C3%A8r-l%C7%9C).\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Meantone temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meantone_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;A system of tuning that averages out pairs of ratios used for the same interval (such as 9:8 and 10:9). The best known form of this temperament is [quarter-comma meantone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-comma_meantone), which tunes major thirds justly in the ratio of 5:4 and divides them into two whole tones of equal size – this is achieved by flattening the fifths of the Pythagorean system slightly (by a quarter of a syntonic comma). However, the fifth may be flattened to a greater or lesser degree than this and the tuning system retains the essential qualities of meantone temperament. Historical examples include 1/3-comma and 2/7-comma meantone.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Well temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;Any one of a number of systems where the ratios between intervals are unequal, but approximate to ratios used in just intonation. Unlike meantone temperament, the amount of divergence from just ratios varies according to the exact notes being tuned, so that C-E is probably tuned closer to a 5:4 ratio than, say, D♭-F. Because of this, well temperaments have no [wolf intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_interval).\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;The standard twelve-tone equal temperament is a special case of meantone temperament (extended eleventh-comma), in which the twelve notes are separated by [logarithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) equal distances (100 [cents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music\\))): A harmonized C major scale in equal temperament (.ogg format, 96.9KB). This is the most common tuning system used in Western music, and is the standard system used as a basis for [tuning a piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_tuning). Since this scale divides an octave into twelve equal-ratio steps and an octave has a frequency ratio of two, the frequency ratio between adjacent notes is then the [twelfth root of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_root_of_two), 2^1/12, or ~1.05946309.... However, the octave can be divided into other than 12 equal divisions, some of which may be more harmonically pleasing as far as thirds and sixths are concerned, such as [19 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament) (extended third-comma meantone), [31 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament) (extended quarter-comma meantone) and [53 equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53_equal_temperament) (extended Pythagorean tuning).\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* [Syntonic temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_temperament)\n\n&gt;&gt;A tuning system that subsumes the Pythagorean and meantone tuning systems, and many of the equal temperament tuning systems.  For example, of the [regular temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_temperament), \"equal temperament\" is the syntonic tuning, in which the tempered perfect fifth (P5) is 700 cents wide; 1/4-comma meantone is the syntonic tuning, in which the P5 is 696.6 cents wide; Pythagorean tuning is the syntonic tuning in which the P5 is 702 cents wide; 5-equal is the syntonic tuning, in which the P5 is 720 cents wide; and 7-equal is the tuning in which the P5 is 686 cents wide. All these syntonic tunings have identical fingering on an [isomorphic keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard).  So do many irregular tunings such as well temperaments and Just Intonation tunings. \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* Tempered timbres\n\n&gt;&gt;A timbre's partials (also known as harmonics or overtones) can be tempered such that each of the timbre's partials aligns with a note of a given tempered tuning. This alignment of tuning and timbre is a key component in the perception of consonance,  of which one notable example is the alignment between the partials of a harmonic timbre and a just intonation tuning. Hence, using tempered timbres, one can achieve a degree of consonance, in any tempered tuning, that is comparable to the consonance achieved by the combination of just intonation tuning and harmonic timbres. Tempering timbres in real time, to match a tuning that can change smoothly in real time, using the tuning-invariant fingering of an [isomorphic keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard), is a central component of [dynamic tonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_tonality). \n\n&gt;Tuning systems that are not produced with exclusively just intervals are usually referred to as *[temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament)*.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Numerary ^nexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerary_nexus) ^| [^Fundamental ^frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency) ^| [^Quarter ^tone ^clarinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_tone_clarinet) ^| [^Mersenne's ^laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne%27s_laws) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cn645d1) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cn645d1)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419635702", "subreddit": "makinghiphop", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Weapon directives are okay, even that you need one battle rifle with scout rifles and get a battle rifle. It should encourage people to try different weapons instead of using orion only etc :) Also the progress in this is fine, because on each tier you need one more weapon on your arsenal, so with kills and medals you should get enough certs to buy next weapon.\n\nYou had some nice points on vehicle directives, like flash scout radar. On MBT you don't have halberd as one directive, while in my opinion it should be, like in harasser it is. Sunderer and galaxy directives are what I think when looking well balanced vehicle directive, because enough support tasks and contains also killing. MBT, lightning and harasser have more aggressive role, which is good. Valkyrie should also have scout radar as one option also like flash suggestion, maybe ESF also in that matter.\n\nOn infantry directives then. LA and infiltrator were my first masters in this type, they were just killing, but also recon as infiltrator, which gave some change to play. Overall those were good showcase how the classes could be played, like I was first time using SMG on LA and it wasn't so bad :) Those had nice synergy with weapon directives. Force recon came with these directives, because some overlapping tasks, like vehicle destruction. It was also nice practicing with quick knifing, more concentrating on headshots, and Q Q Q Q spam (awareness as galaxy pilot was nice tip for this ;)\n\nBefore directives I was playing mainly medic so I had revive and healing ribbons done. Killing was in my nature, but shielding was something I need to learn. After those saviors were only one left, because medic kills as Miller VS were quite rare. It was good that people in yell chat told me how saviors work, but most difficult on this was to change my aggressive play style more passive, because I was the one who need to be saved :P After staying behind, specially with MAXes, I started to get saviors in good rate. It's nice that as support class you need to kill steal for directives :)\n\nEngineer is in same state as medic imho. Sticky spam was required, only one turret auraxium for me to go. Explosives are like force recon, comes with other, but some frag spam in good spots like C-4's, only one mine auraxium for me to go. Objective support is also in same state, just need to hack terminals and overload to get last ribbons. I have been leading my small outfit squads and also some public new player friendly squads. Mostly players gets kicked from public squads, but on these I try to teach them to follow and communicate, ask and play is our motto on these :) I just need to run more platoons, which requires some friends to be online to lead other squads. Also those mentorship ribbons, newer players seems to stick as \"killer classes\", but some listen or have seen videos about how to get certs fast at early stage :) It seems that I only get beacon spawns with my outfit friends, because most \"pubbies\" just press E on death screen and ignore beacons after that change.\n\nIt's quite rare that I pick HA or MAX so progress on those directives are slow, but they seem to be in okay shape. Specially when vehicles and base turrets provide kills now. So at some point you might see me punching amp station turrets while attacking and bring those flashes more ;) It's better to be Air Deterrence than Air Kills :)\n\nMaybe one addition to MAX so it's nicer to be medic is to get \"Being saved\", so it makes MAXes to go first and rely on teammates. Instead of requiring punching, you just need to take damage for your team. But maybe this would be too easy to achieve even with large amount.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419676493", "subreddit": "Planetside", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Watching it.\n\nYour **early game** is actually pretty fine, if Rubick wasn't so super passive you'd get more kills on the Timber.\n\nThere's a point at **12 minutes** where you're left completely alone at top tower for a few seconds and are pushing with creeps. You didn't turn on the Aquila at all.\n\n**19 minutes:** after you finish off the bot T1 tower there's a short fight that breaks out to your left. You just kinda run into the fray and suddenly there's a Slark in your face. You also have a lapse of control because you take your mouse off the action to level up a skill when you should just Ctrl+W.\n\n**23 minutes:** you just finished your MKB rush. You have 853 hp vs a Slark+Bristle team, and all your mobility is just Phase Boots. For this 5400 gold you could've had an SnY (mobility and all around good stuff) + beginning of something else. Or you could have a Shadowblade+Yasha to help with more survivability (you have an Abaddon to clear the dust debuff, and you can get a Manta from the Yasha). And you don't need the true strike at all.\n\n**25 minutes:** Pudge blink+hooks you. Abaddon immediately proves useful and removes the dismember. If you had more hp than 850 you'd last slightly longer and possibly even survive the fight.\n\n**28 minutes:** you immediately buy another Demon Edge even though you lack attack speed and health to live in fights.\n\n**30 minutes:** which is immediately proven in the next fight when you just kinda die to Slark in 2 seconds from full HP. Granted, Sniper is inherently weak to Slark, but you should at least try to get some survivability.\n\n**34 minutes:** in the same place yet another fight breaks out, and your team is already visibly C R U M B L I N G. The best part is how you panic around for the first few seconds of the fight, doing nothing, but running in place. You also don't notice the Slark coming in from the left side, showing himself on a ward. Cue teamwipe. Luckily for you, the enemy creeps are nowhere near your base, so the Pudge and Slark deal no damage to your empty rax.\n\n**36 minutes:** disable the stupid \"camera to hero on respawn\". You could've easily wasted a TP by porting to fountain. Also, no shrapnels were thrown that day. You might've panicked and forgotten, but fighting on low ground vs a Slark you've just let him escape your Assassinate alive because you let him regen for that split second by not providing any vision uphill.\n\n**38 minutes:** you're now down one lane of rax, and buy an Ogre Club. It's way too late for a BKB, and it's not gonna help anyway. With a measly 1400 hp the Slark will just basherino your face in while invincible, and the Pudge will just blink+dismember you to make sure. After you die your team has no damage left.\n\n**40 minutes:** you deal nice damage and kill off the Bristle + Pudge, but the tunnel vision gets you and you're quickly mauled by the Slark who just kinda walked around the whole fight to get you. You also wait forever to throw out the Shrapnel when the fight starts.\n\n**43 minutes:** you just bought a Mithril Hammer that you don't have a slot for. Either finish the BKB or save for buyback, it's late game already, and you deal respectable damage so 2 lives is better than one where you might never even get to use that BKB.\n\n**46 minutes:** overall okay fight, you're really unlucky that the Slark managed to survive on 200 hp. But then you blindly chase into highground and eat a completely unnecessary gale in your face. Instead you could've just backed and tried to help your team fight the Slark and Pudge.\n\nThen you just kinda lose to megacreeps.\n\nI also don't really get your skillbuild: there's no reason to max Take Aim first when their whole team gives no fuck about your range. Slark will jump you every fight, Pudge can Blink/Hook you, Timber chain, Bristle will just man up and run in your face, and Venomancer has 4 teammates to do it for him.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419704667", "subreddit": "TrueDoTA2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

It made things a lot easier. \n\nJust the other day I had sequestered myself in my dark quiet bedroom and was trying to stop my attack from ramping up any further. Deep, rhythmic breathing sometimes helps (when I can remember to perform my panic-reducing techniques), but this time I could not tell how quickly or slowly I was breathing; my sense of time was just totally unmoored from any objective sense. I started breathing out the alphabet song:  \n\n(Exhaling) \"a b c d e f g\" \n\n(Full inhale) \n\n(Exhaling) \"h i j k lmno p\" \n\n(Full inhale) \n\netc. \n\nI did this dozens of times until the panic subsided and relaxation set in.

It's nice to see that your reviews and other posts now get much more attention than a few months ago. You really deserve it.\n\n&gt; But that all comes with practice...\n\nYour reviews already make me practice a lot more than I usually do. Part of the problem is that I never have to write anything in english IRL and I'm mostly a lurker on the internet. I have no problem with understanding  english (I even think in english quite often even though it isn't my first language) but I'm not confident when writing/speaking english. That's what I get for learning a lot of it on the internet.\n\n&gt; ... while I still say that I'm looking to improve within my \"Prologue,\"\n\nThen I'll give you some more feedback :P Have you ever thought about changing the structure of your reviews? I like the way it is but some parts sometimes feel disconnected. I'm mainly talking about the 'characters' section. I'm not sure if it would be an improvement but I think you could write a bit more about them in general and focus less on individual characters.

{"body": "Hi all. Yes this  sounds excatly like misophonic hell. \nConcrats, you have very extreme &amp; cool opportunity to learn astonishing stuff about very ancient brain areas in really concretic, life changing way. I just had my very first misophonia-free christmas (since I was 7 years old). It was so much worth sweat&amp;tears of learning reverse. \n\nI want to start here; it is 100% involuntary (=this is NONE of your fault, though it's really common to feel guilt/ashame). \nIt is changeable, as you actually already know; it is possible to learn new trigger, right? And it does vary; does it feel the same if person doing the trigger sound is stranger/ your parent / partner / co-worker. Or if it happens when you are trying to focus / when you are relaxed / knowing you will have to stay there / knowing you have the way out.\nMisophonia is not something you have, it's actually something you do, and it's getting worse because you know only one way to do it.  you are capable of learning other way, too :D \n\nOur limbic system is there to keep us alive. Simple as that. No \"what if\"s or guesses, it just tags e v e r y t h i n g as a danger when happened simultaneously with something. It feels like rage because it gives you access to your power to do whatever it takes, no matter how horrible, to get safe from thing that you actually are afraid of. Trigger is just a trigger and it means life-treathening danger to you at the moment, though this hasn't actualy been the case in the last decades or however long you've been doing this lost loop. \n\nSo there is starter event. It is very likely you have no conscious memory of it at the moment. Feeling rage means you are so afraid you can't even get to feeling afraid. Moment you first tagged for example eating sound as a part of a danger was from your amygdala-point-of-view death treath. It is very likely you are digging in to trauma when releasing sounds from their current meaning. Also it may be something thats not that bad from adults point of view; social treath lights up the same area than physical / sexual / spiritual danger does. Feeling of being humiliated is death treath, too. \nIt's there and you can solve it no matter how old you are. There's no time in that area of brain. Just staying alive. You have successfully already survived so you ARE ok, though you may still suffer about it. \n\nSo about this involuntary very well learned really important reaction. How do you erase something designed to keep you alive? \n\nIf you sense, let's say, a tiger. You can see it, smell it, hear it, and it clearly is a danger to human. Adrenaline will take over and push you in to rage/panic/ flee. But if you are in a zoo? Whats the difference? you can still see, hear and smell it, but running wont kick in. \nour alert-system does hear what cognitive side has to say, though it doesnt get to do the final decision. \n\nAbout sound trigger everything you do at the moment of being triggered will effect how you do when it happens the next time.\n\nNow here is what you have done to keep it accidentally going and spreading; when triggered your thoughts probably go \"oh not again!\" / \"I should be able to do this!\" / \"why can't i do this!\" / \"I am goin to FAIL everyone at 5pm when it's time to eat\" etc. \nI GET the frustration. I was misophonic 14 years (from age 8 to 22) and numerous plates got killed by fast uncontrolled get-outs. You need to learn to forgive &amp; let go of doing this. It has been the very best&amp; safest way to go though the world and you'll learn to be thankfull of flexibility of human mind. even if it pushed \"you\" you away and neverminds your feels to just keep on breathing.\n\nWhen triggered change this first; Instead of hitting your head on the wall say \"THANK YOU, you horrible chewing gum for alerting me about stuff that truly was dangerous! You do so great with survival, being this triggered and all. Good thing i am now safe here, nothing treathening my life atm.\" I noticed the change in 2 weeks, and after 6 weeks or something like that I started to feel very capable of staying in situations only slightly if all triggered. By the time I realized what I had just done with my brain and that it's never really coming back, I cried few hours and it felt like laughing. Best thing ever and I've done some really cool stuff but nothing as emotionally huge as  this. \n\nDon't take my word for it, try it for yourself.\ntrain alone in your home in total control of your surroundings. Find a trigger from youtube and then watch one whole second of it with sounds off/ youtubeslow.com whatever makes it as mild as possible. So that you can get slightly triggered but stay in control of you conscious stream. Thats the area where you can push new experiences to that exact path in brain. Take your time. Baby steps. Be really kind to you. You've done so great already :)\nGood news is you can't fail this. Every situation where you get triggered IS brand new. \nFor the beginning this will be rollercoaster. It only means you are doing something right. Trust me, it's worth it.\nif you have a partner / close friend willing to help you train your brain, the better. You can take video of them &amp; practice with that. or do it live. i'm not going in detail but I've done some hysterical yoghurt stuff with few people.... :D Do this with people you TRUST.\nJust be  creative. you  can't fuck it up. just experience. When you succesfully collapse present moment TO old paths you will notice the difference in response. \n\nAs an ex-misophonic, when I very first times sat in a table eating with others with no ear protection/coping acrobatics I felt very strange. like, if you have ever been very high around people that are sober and you decide: \"ok! The important thing now is to act normal\" and sit there like an alien and hope no-one notices you feel like a first-timer. Fun times. \n\nI got out. Ask me anything.\n\nHere's stuff written by a professional. http://www.owenparachute.com/misophonia.html\n(he walked me through this. couldn't have solved this out, I had no idea what this whole thing was about. awesome guy.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419779430", "subreddit": "ADHD", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; E D C B A Anyone know the avg units on them?\n\nThere's no average. Each class and rating has a maximum - what you get depends on how you use it. Get close to the star or move at high speed, and you increase how much you scoop, up to the maximum possible.\n\n&gt;  is it worth going from D to C?\n\nYes. You can scoop more with a C-rated scoop than with a D-rated scoop of the same class.\n\n&gt;  or should I save for B?\n\nYes. You can scoop more with a B-rated scoop than with a C-rated scoop of the same class. You trade in equipment for 100% of its price, so there's no reason to \"save\" the money instead of buying the one that's slightly better.\n\n&gt; also is there a distance increase if you buy the more expensive ones?\n\nNo. You need to be in the stars upper atmosphere to have enough hydrogen density to enable scooping, and this doesn't change with more expensive ones - they can just process more plasma into hydrogen fuel.\n\nWhen you're scooping, the number you're seeing (say 75/sec for a class 1A fuel scoop) is kg/second. Since you (should) know how much fuel you can carry, this tells you just how long it'll take to fill your tanks. Higher class scoops can take in much more fuel, higher rated scoops take in more fuel, so you might notice that a class 2C scoop is better than a 1A scoop, because it allows you to fill your tanks faster.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419779510", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Missing time.\n\nI shit you not. I've been experiencing this since I was like 9 years old. I'm 19 now. To preface this, I have no history of mental disorders, I don't believe in the paranormal (ghosts, aliens, god, whatever, mythical creatures), and it happens very very rarely.\n\nWhen I was around 9 or 10, my after school routine was get off the bus, go in the house, grab a snack and watch TV for a little while. Usually my mom would get home just a bit after me but I could easily be trusted alone. The first time it happened, it was like the middle of the week and the last thing I can remember is getting off the bus and walking up my driveway. This was a day my mom was going to be home a few hours after me. School ended at 3, and suddenly it was 5:30. I lost 2 and a 1/2 hours of time. When I realized it, I was sitting on the couch, no snack, staring at the TV watching some channel I'd never watched before.\n\nI cannot explain what happened to me in that time. I don't know. My mom wasn't home yet when I realized 2 1/2 hours were gone. I thought the clock was wrong but it wasn't. My brain just felt blank.\n\nThen, it happened again when I was older, probably around 14 or 15. It was in the summer and I was outside cleaning out what later became my car. I brought out the vacuum, windex, Armor All, tire spray, a bag for garbage. The whole 9 yards. That shit was gonna be s p o t l e s s by the time I was done with it. The last thing I remember is shaking out the floor mats.\n\nThen I realized it was suddenly 3PM and I lost about 3 hours. I was standing in my kitchen. Just...standing there. In the middle of the floor. Staring. That's it. I wasn't doing anything. Just standing. Then I thought shit, did I leave all of my cleaning shit outside? I hope not. Looked out the window. Car was spotless and I had apparently put everything away when I finished.\n\nIt's honestly really scary. When I think about the fact that these two (big) incidences have happened and some smaller ones (usually like ~45 minutes) over the span of like 10 years I get paranoid about the next time it might happen. I can't even compare it to being blackout drunk because when you're on your way to blackout, you know you're drunk and accept that it's a real possibility. Missing time just happens and the likelihood that anyone can explain to you what you did in that time is very slim. I asked my mother after I cleaned my car what I did and she told me she didn't know, she thought I was outside the whole time.\n\nYeah. It's weird.

{"body": "Take a piece of paper and draw the N W S E in the clockwise orientation.  Face a direction you will call North, you can use the actual North if you like.  Point a pencil over the paper in the north direction.  Holding the paper turn CCW 90 degrees so you and the N are pointing West but keep the pencil pointing at the same North as before.  The pencil will now be over the W.  The difference is if the card is aligned or the needle.  Most compasses requires one to align the needle with north on the card.  A transit compass aligns north with the direction one is pointing and the needle moves to the direction.  That is why it is backwards not the mirror.  Yea, I had to use the paper and pencil to convince myself it really worked that way.\n\nhttp://earthsci.org/education/fieldsk/compass/compass.html", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419806355", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

That Picnic scene was alot grimmer than you make it out to be. See, in my mind this whole season, I've totally gotten the concept of \"Only 1 can be victorious in this holy grail war, someone looses when they die or their servants die\". The closer Rin gets to Shirou, the more and more I say \"Shit... when it finally comes **\"down to it\"**, it's gonna be S A D B O Y S!\" :'( cause i've gotten to like Rin, Shirou, Archer, and Saber quite well. \n\n&amp; Idk why ppl knock on Fan-Service, it's always been present in Anime, it's nothing new at all. I enjoyed the Scenes. It was like \"The Calm before the storm\"\n\nAnd on \"Episode Endings &amp; Time Management\", that's just because you watched it Week by Week, as opposed to binge watching it. The Binge watcher wouldn't have a problem with episode endings stopping out of nowhere cause they're popping the episodes one after another. It's just one of those sacrifices you take watching an airing series ofc. But yeah totally opinionated, totally your feelings, i get it. Some others may feel different than how i precieve it. UBW is like only the 4th Anime i've followed week by week as an airing series, and i will say, the episode endings were out of nowhere. But it became \"Expected\" during the Berserker fight onwards. I didn't mind at all.  I definately prefer Bingewatching series tho for that very reason", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419836298", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "He remembers certain shapes (caged system) then he modifies these shapes one note at a time using intervals:\n\nTake the A chord: Drop the major third (b string) down a semitone (one fret) and you have an A minor. Then drop the root (on the G string) down a full tone (two frets) to make a Am7. Now take the 5th (on the D string) and drop it a semi-tone and now you have a Am7b5. (don't play either e stings on this chord).\nNow all these shapes are movable so if you wan to play a A#m7b5 simply move all the notes up a semi tone, move them again and you have a Gm7b5, etc...\nIt sounds complicated, but the nice thing about the guitar is everything repeats. If you know where the root note is it's pretty easy to find a fifth, AKA power chord. Start by finding the 1 and 5 all over the neck. Then find the third (major and minor) then find seventh (major and minor).\nAnd yes chords and scales fit together. The Am scale is spelled a b c d e f g a – the Am7 chord is spelled with the intervals 1 b3 5 and b7 (a, c, e, g) so the 2, 4, 6, are the only notes in the scale NOT used in this particular chord. \nI can't express how important knowing your intervals are and Fruciante knows them.

{"body": "I'm self taught too, don't let it be a deterrent. There's lots of terrible teachers who make this more complicated rather than less. I've only been looking at this stuff for a few days so bear with me. \n\nIf you play the major scale, but start and end on/emphasise a different note, you are playing a different mode of that scale. \n\nFor example, the C Major scale you might know simply goes C D E F G A B C (white keys on a Piano). This is the C ionian mode. This mode is associated with the chord C Major.\n\nIf you play that same scale but start and end on D (D E F G A B C D) , you are playing the D dorian mode. You can tell it sounds very different from the D major scale/Ionian mode (D E F♯ G A B C♯). D dorian is associated with the D minor chord and has the same notes C ionian , but has D as it's tonal centre.\n\nUsing the notes of the C major scale, you can make 7 chords that are the chords associated with the key. C Maj, D min, E min, F Maj, G Maj, A min, B Dim, each of these chords has it's own respective mode, by starting and ending on/ emphasising that particular note in the C major scale. \n\nGoing from there, the comment should make a little more sense now, let me know if it doesn't. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419932856", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "The Major scale you know (the Ionian mode) is the one that goes Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do. You should be able to work out the pattern starting from any note using your ears. The other modes will certainly be less familar sounding to you. I simply said white keys because C Major is the only major scale that contains no sharps or flats (the black keys).\n\nI've just told you one simple way of telling which chords go together. \nMemorise the following:  I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii^o. \n\nIf you know your roman numerals, you'd see that these numbers count to 7. If not, learn that now too. The chords that are capitalised (I, IV, V or 1, 4, 5 to you and me) are major. The ones that are lower case are minor, the 7th chord is diminished, so it gets it's own symbol. \n\nThese numbers correspond to the notes of the major scale. So in the case of C Major (C D E F G A B), you can see that the chords are C Maj, D min, E Min, F Maj etc. The reason why will become apparent when you look at how to make up chords, major scales and modes etc., as well as which chords are strong, which are weak, which can be used as a replacement for which. \n\nI wouldn't go tackling modes of the major scale until you have barre chords and perhaps some general chord theory down (it'll make it easier for note names at the very least). Whenever you learn a new chord from now on, work out why that chord is what it is, what notes make up the chord and where they are located. When you strum an E major chord, do you know where the E notes are located, for example? \n\nThere's a few threads where people have recommended learning materials like [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2qmds8/best_book_to_purchase_to_learn_theory/) where you might find some suggestions. I got started on a book called \"Music theory for practical people\" but honestly I've had the most progress with online resources. \n\nHowever I haven't kept a list because I've just googled bits as they came up. \n\nhttp://www.justinguitar.com/ is great. [This](http://www.guitarmasterclass.net/guitar_forum/index.php?showtopic=50826) and [this](http://www.guitar-tutorial.net/pentatonic.html) might help with your pentatonic scales (which is based on the major scale, just makes it a little easier to not mess up). [This](http://endofthegame.net/2011/07/28/modesmajorscale/) is a great explanation of the modes of the major scale.\n\n\nBefore you get into it at all, I'd advise doing attentive practice rather than just drilling scale shapes or being stuck in particular scale boxes/shapes . At the end of the day, your ears are king. There are scales with extra flavour notes and scales with less. You can play any note in any key and make it relevant with the preceding or following notes, so don't feel limited. The sound is what matters. \n\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419934760", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "* ** p r i x  u n i q u e du L I V R E, je sais pas comment te l'écrire pour que tu comprennes qu'il sera au *même* prix à intermarché ET chez ton, efin un, libraire. Et très joli le \"bobonne\", classe et distingué, sans soucis, un point rire et chanson pour toi.\n* C'est son métier, et surtout il y a des librairies spécialisées qui seront ravies de te renseigner, le libraire se doit de s'intéresser à tout et de satisfaire les goûts plus éclectiques.\n* Pas toujours, j'ai souligné le point faible, mais la plupart du temps ça ira. Et ça te fera bouger ton gras, parler à des gens, que du bénéf t'as vu ! \n* Tu oublies grandement le fait qu'Amazon soit une entreprise qui s'arrange, comme ça a été dit plus bas mais je répète parce que ça a pas l'air simple, pour ne déclarer aucun bénéfice, et ne paye pas ses impôts. Si tu parlais de coût du libraire, lui au moins il les paye, et si il a la chance de pouvoir, peut augmenter ses employés (avoue qu'en tant qu'employé tu aimes tout autant être augmenté, bah le libraire fait ses 35h, il a le droit), Amazon continuera à avoir des employés précaires, à ne pas respecter le code du travail, (on te ressort tout les articles sur le temps de pause chez Amazon ou ça va ?). Un \"picker\" intérimaire chez Amazon c'est 2 voire 3 emplois de libraires indépendants qui sont détruits, donc plus d'entreprises LOCALES qui font vivre ta commune, ton pays, paye ton éducation, ton chômage, tout ce qui est gratuit autour de toi.\n* C'est pas mieux ou moins bien, c'est différent, certains aiment avoir des livres, aiment l'objet, certains trouvent que c'est plus pratique, d'autres moins, mais c'est terriblement subjectif, on peut pas dire que c'est mieux moins bien. Il ya des livres BEAUX, et on peut pas le nier.\n* Tu me dis que tu n'aimes pas les libraires, donc tu n'as pas du essayer, donc tu te bases sur une idée et non une expérience. Je sais de quoi je parle, je connais le métier, évidemment.\n* Défendre la libraire indépendante c'est aussi et surtout défendre une vision de l'indépendance éditoriale, c'est aussi grâce à eux qu'on a de l'édition indépendante et de la qualité, cela permet de favoriser la diversité éditoriale, alors qu'au final, appelons un chat un chat, avec Amazon tu ne fais qu'acheter chez un très gros revendeur. Tu as le même produit final mais tu éteins des tonnes d'idées de projets éditoriaux qui ne verrons jamais le jour à cause de ça et sans un petit coup de pouce éconimoque on ne verra plus apparaître que des ouvrages \"rentables\". \n* Manque de choix chez le libraire, évidemment les libraires n'ont pas des hangars de mille m², mais tu as toujours, toujours, de la nouveauté, et toujours un fond important, renseigne toi sur la longue traîne qui concerne tout particulièrement le monde de l'édition. La plupart des livres sont trouvables en 2 ou 3 jours, et ne me dit pas que chez Amazon tu as tout le lendemain : entre les erreurs de colis, les postiers qui ne sonnent pas à ta porte, aller chercher ton colis, oublier ta pièce d'identité, y retourner et que ce soit fermé, etc... Si tu as déjà ta référence au final le résultat sera le même.\n\nBonus :\n* Numérique ou papier, ça revient au même, le livre n'est pas un produit comme les autres, c'est pas un sandwich, 'cest pas un jus de fruit, c'est pas de la litière pour chat, c'est plus inquiétant pour la \"civilisation\" et ses politiques culturelles.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419950816", "subreddit": "france", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a problem I was thinking about the other day. Let's consider only integer palindromes for a bit, because if we include all the real numbers things get a lot wackier.\n\nI think it depends a lot on where your range lies. For instance, take base 10, and our range to be [0,9]. Then the probability that x is in that range is a palindrome is 1. But for the same size interval elsewhere, say for instance between [1000, 1009], the probability is .1, and if the range is [1002, 1012], then the probability is 0. So I don't know if there's going to be any nice form for the probability that doesn't somehow include how big n and m are (as the larger they are, the frequency of palindromes change significantly). Similar issues abound in any base you use, I imagine, though base 2 might be the simplest. \n\nNow let's think about actually calculating some in specific ranges.\n\nIn [0,9] there are 10 palindromes out of 10 numbers, 10/10 gives is probability 1.\n\nIn [10,99] there are 9 palindromes (corresponding to the multiples of 11] out of 90 numbers, giving us a probability of 1/10.\n\nIn [100,999] there are 90 palindromes (we need numbers of the form a b a where a has 9 choices and b has 10 choices) out of 900 numbers, giving us again a probability of 1/10.\n\nIn [1000,9999] there are still only 90 palindromes (we need numbers of the form a b b a, which has the exact same combinatorics as the previous) out of 9000 now, which gives us a probability of 1/100.\n\nIn [10000,99999] there are 900 palindromes ( a b c b a where a has 9 choices, b and c have 10 choices, giving us 900) out of 90000 numbers, giving us a probability of 1/100.\n\nThe pattern continues obviously for these specific examples, with the combinatorics not changing for every other range increase. \n\nI don't know if much work has been done formally, but this is just some quick work on a chalkboard for you.

Also I speak four languages (English, Finnish, Swedish (very shittily) and Chinese) with the only one of the four where I know the right order of the months? Chinese because it goes, \"1st month, 2nd month, 3rd month...\"\n\nI connect experiences to seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) rather than out right to a particular month. If I need to plan things? I whip out a calendar. My understanding of the months is by going 1-12 and at this point I'm just looking up what name corresponds to which number.\n\nOther gore-y details from my side of the good ship HMS Retards-ahoy? No clue how the alphabet goes. Oh sure it starts off with \"A, B, C, D, E, F, G...\" Uhm, after that? K? N M L O Q P R T ... fuck. I mean it's pretty clear I'm literate but if you asked me on the street to recite the alphabet I'd probably leave a few letters out.\n\nLeft and right? Yeah, no chance of me consistently remembering which is my left and right. At this point I would like to remind you that I'm currently learning/working with a [Mazak CNC lathe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVUYhqFcJ9o) -- even I'm bewildered by how that's possible. I've always been inclined to tinker with mechanical things; I have a few project cars I work on in my spare time and the like.\n\nThis has come up before and I've heard suggestions of dyslexia and dyscalculia, which I guess might be the case...? Except it seems like I would never have learned another language if it was the former and my hobbies/work make the latter seem equally unlikely.\n\nHope that answered some questions for you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419975464", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Pas la peine de t'énerver. \n\nComme je sais pas à quoi tu fais référence dans chacun de tes points je vais les requoter pour plus de clarté. \n\n&gt;** p r i x u n i q u e du L I V R E, je sais pas comment te l'écrire pour que tu comprennes qu'il sera au même prix à intermarché ET chez ton, efin un, libraire.\n\nUne mauvaise loi qui défend les corporations est une mauvaise loi qui défend les corporations. Le débat existait avant Amazon. \n\n&gt;C'est son métier, et surtout il y a des librairies spécialisées qui seront ravies de te renseigner, le libraire se doit de s'intéresser à tout et de satisfaire les goûts plus éclectiques.\n\nDonc maintenant en plus je dois chercher (où ? sur internet pardi!) la librairie spécialisée qui a peu de chance de se trouver dans ma ville ? C'est vachement chiant ton système. \n\n&gt;Et ça te fera bouger ton gras, parler à des gens, que du bénéf t'as vu ! \n\nL'interaction forcée. Non, merci. Pour 98% des gens, l'interaction du libraire, c'est donner l'argent et \"Est-ce que vous avez ça?\" \"Non, désolé\". \n\n&gt;Tu oublies grandement le fait qu'Amazon soit une entreprise qui s'arrange, comme ça a été dit plus bas mais je répète parce que ça a pas l'air simple, pour ne déclarer aucun bénéfice, et ne paye pas ses impôts.\n\nEt les libraires ne fraudent jamais. Le problème de la taxation n'est pas lié au métier d'Amazon. \n\n&gt;Un \"picker\" intérimaire chez Amazon c'est 2 voire 3 emplois de libraires indépendants qui sont détruits, donc plus d'entreprises LOCALES qui font vivre ta commune, ton pays, paye ton éducation, ton chômage, tout ce qui est gratuit autour de toi.\n\nOn a fait disparaître des industries entières en france dans l'indifférence générale. La librairie, c'est du service local qui ne crée pas vraiment d'emploi. \n\n&gt;C'est pas mieux ou moins bien, c'est différent, certains aiment avoir des livres, aiment l'objet, certains trouvent que c'est plus pratique, d'autres moins, mais c'est terriblement subjectif, on peut pas dire que c'est mieux moins bien. Il ya des livres BEAUX, et on peut pas le nier.\n\nSi, je le dis, c'est mieux ou ça le sera. \n\n&gt;Tu me dis que tu n'aimes pas les libraires, donc tu n'as pas du essayer, donc tu te bases sur une idée et non une expérience. Je sais de quoi je parle, je connais le métier, évidemment.\n\nJ'ai eu une vie avant Amazon. Et bien que vivant à Paris ça consistait surtout à aller au Gibert Joseph ou à la Fnac et parfois des librairies que je trouvais déjà chères, peu accessibles et peu intéressantes en tant que lieux de culture (pour moi cela reste des dépôts à livres).\n\n&gt;Tu as le même produit final mais tu éteins des tonnes d'idées de projets éditoriaux qui ne verrons jamais le jour à cause de ça et sans un petit coup de pouce éconimoque on ne verra plus apparaître que des ouvrages \"rentables\". \n\nC'est cool parce que maintenant, il y a un petit truc appelé internet qui permet à chacun de publier ses idées à moindre coût et sans des mécanismes ruineux type \"compte d'auteur\". \n\n&gt;La plupart des livres sont trouvables en 2 ou 3 jours, et ne me dit pas que chez Amazon tu as tout le lendemain.\n\nNon, mais je peux planifier d'une meilleure manière. \n\n&gt; ses politiques culturelles.\n\nOn en revient au problème qui me frappe quand je te lis. L'attentisme face à l'Etat. La politique culturelle, c'est de la flûte. La culture, c'est quelque chose d'organique qui se construit indépendamment d'un pseudo-monopole ou d'une tour de contrôle remplie de bobo du Ve avec une culture au service de privilégiés au lieu d'une culture destinée à tous et surtout à la portée de tous.  \n\nJe me doute bien que ce ne sont pas des gens de ta trempe qui auraient conçu Wikipedia ou Amazon ou Khan academy mais par pitié, viens pas drapé de ta vertu démocratique et altruiste quand tu fais partie des gens qui la restreignent et qui veulent imposer leurs idées.\n\nEt pour finir un post déjà long:\n\n&gt;Je sais de quoi je parle, je connais le métier, évidemment.\n\nJe sais de quoi je parle, je consomme des livres. Et les libraires, j'en veux pas. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1419977225", "subreddit": "france", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I like it a lot because everytime I listen to it I can find/hear something new. I'm not too good at explaining why I like a certain album so I guess you'll have to check for someone's opinion's elsewhere. I liked it on first listen but everytime I listened to it again I liked it a lot more. I can say I've honestly listened to this album over 50 times at least.\n\nCheck out Never Catch Me, I don't think it's representative of the whole album but the song is still amazing on it's own and the music video for it amazing is as well. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lXD0vv-ds8\n\nSyro and NehruvianDOOM were both very disappointing albums. Not saying they are bad. Maybe I was just too hyped for AFX's and DOOM's big return. Ah and Warpaint too, being a big fan of their first LP this new one isn't doing it for me (fun fact Nigel was the producer for that new record).\n\nI'm looking forward to maybe some new Radiohead, new RTJ (they are already starting RTJ3 I read somewhere) and part 2 of Death Grips' album.\n\nAlso feel free to ask me any question on the live shows I saw!\n\nWhat a great year of music this was!

{"body": "I personally haven't really dwelled on the best of 2014 much, so this is just going to be a light recap.\n\n**Standout Albums**\n\nEugeniusz Rudnik - ERdada Na Taśmę (musique concrete). New compositions from the 82-year-old Pole who's still got it. Great on him for making his first LP, and he's still as good as ever.\n\nSteve Reich - Radio Rewrite (modern classical, minimalism). About time this got an official release, what a great work. I liked Jonny's performance of *Electric Counterpoint* more than Metheny's as well, but that's a pretty hot opinion.\n\nLewis - L'Amour/Romantic Times (singer/songwriter, ethereal, leftfield, folk). Actually reissues from the 80s by Light in the Attic, these two albums are the embodiment of receiving a beautiful rose from your date under a moonlit sky. Lewis' hushed vocals among synth-y minimal electronic makes these some treasures that I'm thankful weren't lost to time.\n\nFire! Orchestra - Enter! (experimental big band jazz). ***And then I have experienced both life and death!*** What an incredible and ambitious album. Simply can't describe it in words.  Incredible album, and probably my favorite of the year.\n\nCurrent 93 - I Am the Last of All the Field That Fell: A Channel (neofolk, avant-garde). I hope Tibet never is off his game, because he could make intense music until his last breath. Very gripping listen, even by C93 standards.\n\nAi Aso - Lone (psychedelic folk). Another solid release from the Japanese folk singer with one of the most gentle yet ravishing voices I've ever heard.\n\nLCD Soundsystem - The Long Goodbye (dance-punk, electronic). ;___;\n\nFirst Aid Kit - Stay Gold (folk pop, indie folk). Contemporary folk done right. Great instrumentation, wonderful vocals.\n\nKyary Pamyu Pamyu - Pikapika Fantajin (Japanese pop). In my opinion, Kyary's strongest release yet. Nakata continues weaving his production magic (while disregarding proper mastering) and it still shows. Really enjoyable all the way through.\n\nVanessa Rosetto - Whole Stories (musique concrete, field recordings). While exploring the wide genres of early electronic music (EAI, musique concrete, tape music), I didn't expect to find great recent releases, but Whole Stories was a wonderful and very personal effort.\n\nNeil Cicierega - Mouth Sounds/Mouth Silence (electronic, mashup). Good old Neil, deciding to take the genre of mashup and instantly becoming the best in the genre. Uproariously funny yet poignant and well-done, these two albums are very fun and engaging listens that I practically guarantee will leave you with a smile.\n\nSleaford Mods - Divide and Exit (post-punk). I felt like smoking a cig with the lads and complaining about the Queen after listening to this album. Seriously funny listen, and the backing music is interesting too. \n\nB L A C K I E - IMAGINE YOUR SELF IN A FREE AND NATURAL WORLD (experimental hip-hop). MC Ride wishes he had half the raw energy and presence B L A C K I E brings. The guy's nuts in the best way.\n\nBeck - Morning Phase (folk, singer/songwriter). Less sad than Sea Change yet more dynamic musically, in my opinion. I love all his work very much and MP is no different.\n\nSeiko Oomori - 洗脳 (Japanese pop). A little less art-sy and experimental than her previous work but still very wonderful stuff - she's gotten considerably more popular recently and this was her first big studio release. I'm excited to see how she progresses as an artist in the future.\n\nAnd of course, Thom Yorke - Tomorrow's Modern Boxes. Another great release from Thom, his development as a musician to a more unconventional electronic sound has been a good change, in my opinion. I hope he continues pursuing that until maybe he starts making some electroacoustic improvisation. ;)\n\nThat's 15, right? Definitely not my top 15, but I'd say those all are probably top 25~30. Some honorable mentions to Mariko Goto's (of Midori fame) 3rd solo LP, tune-yards, Aphex Twin (and the ol' Caustic Window record was great too) The Body, Circa Survive, the entirety of PC Music (A.

Cook, Hannah Diamond, etc), Machine Girl, Todd Terje, St. Vincent, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, John Zorn, Xiu Xiu, Lykke Li, Pallbearer, D'Angelo, Agalloch, Swans, the list goes on...\n\n**Biggest disappointments**\n\nVenetian Snares - My Love is a Bulldozer (electronic, breakcore). I've never been a huge fan of breakcore, but Funk's lyricism and singing are just fucking awful and bring down that album so much, in my opinion.\n\nDeath Grips - NOTM (experimental hip-hop). Obviously we haven't heard the other half of The Powers That B yet besides \"Inanimate Senation,\" which I enjoyed, but this felt a lot less coherent and solid than their previous releases. The half-assed Bjork samples just add to the disappointment.\n\nMother Mother - Very Good Bad Thing (electronic, indie pop). I just don't think a more electronic sound works well for Mother Mother, so as a whole enjoyed VGBT less than their previous releases.\n\nMark Kozolek in general. At least I can re-listen to RHP stuff endlessly.\n\nNothing else really comes to mind immediately.\n\n**2015**\n\nBjörk. Björk. Björk. Produced by motherfucking Arca! I'm so excited.\n\nRadiohead 9th LP, hopefully.\n\nSleater-Kinney, Laura Marling, more experimental and classical music since it's something I've been increasingly exploring this past year...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420017194", "subreddit": "radiohead", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

That money is peanuts to them they were just doing it to give a gigantic FUCK YOU to that guy who caught them lying and cheating and being complete fucking thieves and crooks and he NEEDS to sue them for all the money he can possibly get out of them.  Not only for not honoring the contract they legally agreed to in the first place but he needs to get absolutely filthy with these cocksuckers!!!  I'm talking Breach of contract.  Pain and suffering.

There is only a basic theory, that makes things sound well. You often have to think outside of the box to get a unique and different sound, but you should always start with the basics. No matter which instrument you play: **Master the major scale first**!\n\n\nI hope i could help you.

{"body": "&gt;  und was argert mich ist dass der Müll ist auch nicht sortiert.\n\nHerzlichen Glückwunsch, du bist Deutscher. [Hier, die Einbürgerungsurkunde zum selbstausfüllen, Amtssiegel ist schon drauf](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/66/Einb%C3%BCrgerungsurkunde_Deutschland.jpg).\n\nAber jetzt mal Tacheles: Müllentsorgung ist Daseinsfürsorge, insofern  Aufgabe der Gemeinden. Die regeln das generell durch eine Satzung (Im Prinzip ein Gesetz, nur durch eine Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts erlassen. Ja, Gemeinden gehören nicht zum Staat an sich, das sind nur Bund und die Länder, Gemeinden sind Gebietskörperschaften).\n\n[Beispiel Düsseldorf](https://www.duesseldorf.de/stadtrecht/1/19/19_102.shtml). Diese Satzungen sehen generell vor dass Einwohner dazu *verpflichtet* sind ihren Müll der gemeindlichen Abfallverwertung zuzuführen (sprich: Selbst, nicht durch Nachbartonne), ansonsten Ordnungswidrigkeit. Nochmal Zitat aus Düsseldorf:\n\n&gt; Die Ordnungswidrigkeit kann mit einer Geldbuße bis zu 50.000,- EUR geahndet werden, soweit nicht andere gesetzliche Bestimmungen hierfür eine höhere Geldbuße vorsehen.\n\nDarüber hinaus ist das noch [Unterschlagung](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unterschlagung_%28Deutschland%29) deiner Müllgebühren. Also Strafrecht, wobei in diesem Fall die Ordnungswidrigkeit allerdings schmerzhafter sein sollte. Zumindest wenn der Täter kein Millionär ist.\n\nWas tun, ganz praktisch gesehen? Eigentlich ganz einfach: Vorhängeschloss kaufen, ein Schlüssel dem Abfallunternehmen zukommen lassen (am besten im Rathaus nachfragen), wenn das geklärt ist (natürlich nicht vorher) die Tonne zuschließen. Optional, vielleicht macht die Gemeinde das auch selber, Anzeige gegen unbekannt stellen. Gemeinden haben nicht die Angewohnheit, bei solchen Dingen rumzuspaßen.\n\nFalls du mietest: Rede auch mit deinem Vermieter. Vielleicht gehört dem sogar die Tonne, nich dass du in fremdes Eigentum einfach so n Loch reinbohrst um n Schloss dran zu kriegen... interessiert zwar generell kein Schwein, einmal reden is aber trotzdem das richtige.\n\nOh, eins fehlt noch, du bist jetzt ja schließlich Deutscher. Das passiv-aggressive Blockwarttum: Häng' im Hauseingang (falls es den gibt) einen Zettel mit der Rechtslage auf.
