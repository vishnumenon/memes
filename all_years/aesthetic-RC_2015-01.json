Bind stuff like defensive and offensive cooldowns and other utilities to these.

{"body": "There's a few different lists in my head. The series that I've gotten disappointed in.. Oh boy, let's see..\n\n* Trauma Center - I was R E A L L Y enjoying this one to begin with. Like it was the freshest of breaths I had taken in a long while on Game Grumps. Slowly, it devolved into a read-through, where they would mainly be reading to us what was on screen, in their chosen voices with few jokes inbetween(a very simple way for them to earn their keep). It also started out as a co-op playthrough(REMEMBER THAT?), but got too hard for Dannyboy. They were also playing *co-op* in Super Mario 3D World at the same time, but I didn't really feel it was so cooperative. It was like I play and you play. If you didn't play, it would make no difference to me. Think of a game like Goof Troop that really has both parties working together to hold items and solve puzzles. That's what I feel like GG needed, and needs more of. After some thirty episodes of Trauma, I knew exactly what to expect from an episode, and was no longer excited to watch it. Arin gets frustrated at the procedures, but inches his way through them with possibly one death or more. Dan and focuses on his voices for the characters, and might comment on things like \"oh, look where we're slicing the patient. Across and outside the liver.\"(haven't made a similar comment before). Arin will also add his \"poopy\" humor to the mix. He'll make a *funny noise* and really crack himself up. Continues to make *funny noise*.\n\n* Trials Fusion - I don't even need to explain this one to you guys. The whole thing was unacceptable. I also really like this game, and know what it has to offer, so it was an even bigger let down that they basically said the game sucks at the end.\n\n* Duke Nukem Forever - I expected some saltyness. That's fine. It has some flaws, and didn't live up to its previous titles. However what I got was a very sour taste in my mouth when sitting through this series. The grumps can make anything seem fun or boring if they're in the right mindset, and they clearly were in a Trials Fusion type one for all of the episodes.\n\n* Super Metroid - I loved this game. It's mysterious, vast, exciting and interesting. While I can't recall the jokes being *bad*(they were probably to my liking), the actual playthrough part of the game made me a little \"*meh*\". Sequence breaking and all of that(heavy heavy walkthrough usage). Not experiencing the game as it should be felt like they were cheating it in a way. The resolution didn't give that much satisfaction because I know it wasn't achieved through normal means. Arin actually came prepared to this playthrough, but I don't think this game was the best choice to do so for. \n\n* Call Of Cthullhu - I actually made a thread about how I felt on the main subreddit about 4 months ago if you want to see. http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/2eoy3j/im_a_little_sore_on_my_backside_from_the_recent/  \n\nOtherwise, I'm realizing while going through the list of games they've played that there are extremely few that I've actually been excited to see. Some may have ended up better or worse than I expected, but they're really not touching too many games that I already find to be awesome.\n\nThere have been some one-offs or VS though that I have ended up really disliking due to their inability to understand it. One game I can think of that they should have on lockdown other than the isometric camera view is Biker Mice From Mars. A seriously solid racing game on SNES that is fun and challenging, but they just ended up shitting on it, so that wasn't fun for me one bit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420123218", "subreddit": "VentGrumps", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

I still strum those rests, but I miss the strings on purpose.  To get out of this pattern, you can change up the number and placement of the rests.  For the sake of simplicity, the full measure would be this:\n\n    | D U D U D U D U |\n    | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + |\n\nHere are some possibilities for variation (might be useful to tap your foot on the quarter notes, or play with a metronome or drum machine):\n\n    | D - D - D - D - |\n    | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + |\n\n    | D U - U D U - U |\n    | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + |\n\n    | D - D - D U - - |\n    | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + |\n\n    | - U D U - U D U |\n    | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + |\n\nYou can have 2-bar patterns:\n\n    | D - D - D - D U | - U - U D - D - | (Coldplay's Viva la Vida)\n    | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + |\n\nThere are basically a lot of possibilities when you understand the rhythms you're playing and how to re-configure them.  You have even more possibilities when you break up the measure into 16ths, or create 4-bar patterns, or change the placement of accents in your strums.  But working with 8th notes is a good starting point.\n\nIf you want to incorporate elements of melody in your strum, that could be a little more advanced.  You can certainly learn new chord voicings and inversions and embed the melody in chords, or you can learn to pick in between strums, or both.

{"body": "No,  cis and trans is originally taken from chemistry, from a concept called cis trans isomerism. \n\nWARNING: SCIENCE CONTENT\n\nLets say you draw a cross (a +). Let's say then that you can place letters at the points of the cross, which means than you could fit 4 letters around the cross. Now try arranging the letters A A B B around the cross. There are two ways you can do it. You can have the letters A opposite each other on the cross (and obviously the letters B opposite each other too). Or, you can have the letters A on one side of the cross next to each other (and same with B). \n\nIn chemistry, this occurs. You can have four chemical groups (simplest case being two groups of two) around a double bond just like the way you arranged the letters around the X, and the two ways that they are arranged are distinct to each other. If they are arranged with the \"A opposite each other\" configuration, then that's trans. If they are arranged with the \"A on one side\", then that's cis. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420195224", "subreddit": "TumblrInAction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

F and G are the closest and easiest ones for me to hit, so I put my main rotation spells on that.  I use 1 for Charge (I'm a warrior).  AoE is R and/or Y.  Interrupt is C.  DoTs are E and/or T.\n\nMy second action bar is: 2 3 4 5 6 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 SQ.  These are mostly my buffs and things with larger cooldowns.  S4 S5 S6 are all defensive buffs.  I macro the ones that are off of global cooldown, but keep icons in the other spots so I can keep up on the cooldown timers for each individual item.\n\nTL;DR - If you are comfortable with reassigning some keys, the easiest ones to reach are the ones around WASD (Q, E, R, T, F, G, Y, Z, X, C, V).  Then add modifiers (shift, control, alt) for separate bars/less desired abilities.\n\nI don't recommend using the entire 1-0 row as most people can't reach past 6 on the keyboard without moving their hand.\n\nI hope this helps a little.  Take a look at some macros from Noxxic and Icy-Veins as well.

{"body": "One even better- \n\nPain Harmonization.  You're in the shower, the water is obviously too hot.  You know that you can't take this for long and so you shift to reach for the knob and cool the shower down a bit- but then, before you manage it, the hot water, that boiling hot pitch that is already turning your skin a violent scarlet, the rapid patter of forced rain hits an itch.  Maybe you didn't even realize that you itched.  Maybe, subconsciously you knew, but you were saving the scratch for later.  Maybe you even did this very thing on purpose... but however it happens, the incandescent spray finds your itch and suddenly you are transported.  You are no longer a mere body, of flesh and blood and sinew and synapses.  You are a realm of senses.  You can smell the soap hanging heavy in the air.  You can taste the clear alkaline water in the back of your throat.  You hear the soft white noise of the shower's cry and the murmur of the drain below.  Sight?  No, sight is lost to you as you have long since closed your eyes.  In truth, you cease to be.  All that is, all that exists, all that you register is the perfect nullification of pain.  Fire teases at the edges, but upon the itch?  No.  There is no flame there.  There is naught but the Agony and the Ecstasy.  The nataraja has danced and the cool waters of the Time That Was birth the unfolding lotus before you and you are enlightened.  Within that patch of void that was once your skin, creation has returned to a primordial state, to Ein-sof.  The candle that caresses your former body has led you up the sephirot.  At your right hand is the Word.  Before you is the Crown.  All that is, all that you register, all that you seek and have attained... is *n i r v a n a.*\n\n\nAlas, you are ultimately human and to be human is to be flawed.  The perfect timeless instant, the passing eternity, is shattered as the dreams of an old man realizing his pending mortality.  The itch is scratched by so base a mechanism as the fingernails and sensual cacophony is upon you.  You are leaden flesh and pain.  Your divinity is a bittersweet reminiscing as you dive for the knob, now crustacean crimson and gasping in steam.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420264178", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\"I don't know much about their work ethics but for such a small country to be competing with all the large countries in terms of technology, culture and innovation, they've gotta be doing something right. How do you explain that?\"\n\nThey're coasting from their 4-5 decades off of economic growth after the 50's(+ the bubble years of the 80's)  Remember after WWII the United States REBUILT EVERYTHING FOR FREE.\n\nThey did this so that Japan wouldn't become communist (the red scare pretty much started after WWII ended)\n\nThis was at a time when the rest of the world was in ruins and the U.S. rebuilt infrastructure, factories homes etc.  Couple that with the dissolution of the Oppressive Japanese Regime in favor of an American one (seriously Old Japan was pretty horrible in terms of government)\n\nSo basically while the world was in ruins, Japan pretty much had NEW EVERYTHING, there was no way that Japan would NOT be a top economic power.\n\nThen came the bubble years of the 80's. . .This is key and something you should learn because the Japanese banks were pretty much doing the same thing the American ones were - widescale corruption and destructive speculation etc etc, the bubble burst and the ecomony crashed, and Japan did the same thing the U.S. did with the bailout etc etc, \n\nThing is, the Japanese Yen isn't the world reserve currency like the American currency is,(meaning you can't really print money like we do. . unless you want to become Zimbabwe) so that's why the Japanese economy is in a 25-30 year recession,  it still LOOKS good because:\n\na)most people form the countries sides have moved to Tokyo and to a lesser extent Osaka, providing a  \"brain - and - labor drain from those areas (see Spain after they kicked all the Muslims/Moors out of the country and look at the aftermath and you can see why this is bad)\n\nb)because of the large population of people, the market/economy is highly artificial and a lot of the economic growth doesn't flow outside of the cities, since there is less people to participate in the economy, wages stagnate, and because of the recession, inflation rises meaning things cost more and more, and in the case of the big cities: Too many people in a dense area = higher property prices = higher rent = more people spending money on rent rather than buying other goods and services = not enough revenue from companies that sell other goods and services =  less people having jobs and little to no wages increases. . .in some cases there are wage decreases (mostly referring to the yearly Bonus system that I won't get into in this post since its way too long)=less people buying things = etc etc, hopefully you can see where this feedback loop is going.  Eventually people will of course be unable to raise a child etc etc(already went through all of this) Also add in the factor the Japanese culture of respecting seniority and being non confrontational and you get the demographic time bomb.   During my Five years living in Japan, The amount of scandals that were being done in regards to basically the rich guys at the top of the companies scamming the shit out of people was just insane.  It seemed like every few months there'd be some huge story about CEOs ripping off their employees, cutting costs on products and  lying about it to dangerous effect etc etc, tons of other shit.\n\nThere's a L O T going on there that you(and most others don't see) and just make up wild assumptions based on weird obsessions with Japanese Cartoons and dolls or whatnot idk, a LOT of people seem to call that Japanese \"Culture\" when they haven't even gotten close to what it is, and what's REALLY going on there.\n\nReally, I\"ve only scratched the surface of what's going on over there, I could probably actually write a LONG BOOK on a whole bunch of shit -  including stuff on The Crime organizations there, and other unsavory industries that is pretty much kept out of view of the west, since what they show reports/documentary peeps is only the tip of the iceberg of what happens there - they do this on purpose to paint the picture of Japan that they want and satiate the foreign press so that they don't \"dig deeper\" (not like they really could).  But since I'm going back in a couple of months that probably wont happen.\n\nAnyway It seems like you really aren't that educated since what I just laid out is based on:\n\na)A lot of history (you don't even know about the Marshall plan. . really?) \n\nb)Economic history and theory based on what happens with money supply (econ 101-202)\n\nC)Basic economics (econ 101)\n\nD)Basic research skills (any class ever since middle school)\n\nE)Wealth of experience as opposed to your lack of experience in actually living in the country and seeing first hand/actually talking to people and getting to know them and their struggles (can't fault you for that but I can fault you for making silly assumptions while knowing that you've never been to the country for long enough, if at all so see what's really going on there...which would be at LEAST 2-3 years if you're paying attention and are social enough to actually get people to tell you their struggles, hard to do for real cultural reasons that people don't know about/don't care to learn about)\n\nand instead want to write out a snarky. . .er passive aggressive comment(I hate that word \"Snarky\"  it's silly) - you could have figured out the answer to your question in five seconds if you thought about it at all.\n\nAnyway, for a short view of some struggles Japan faces take a look at the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwUIKDTErNo\n\nafter that. I'd advise you to learn google-fu, or head to a library, and pick up some books do some research and a lot of basic knowledge that you seem to be lacking (maybe go back to school at a community college? up to you).  It may help you out.\n\n\nOr not. . .you could be hopeless.*shrug*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420296927", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey there! First off, let me welcome you to the hobby. It's a challenging, often times frustrating, yet ultimately rewarding experience. I'm not going to lie to you, but the first thing you need to do is develop a STRONG sense of patience. Nothing great happens in this hobby quickly. If you don't believe that, ask anyone who has had their beloved tank crash and kill off everything. The first test of patience is learning the nitrogen cycle. While it's possible to add fish early, it's not a nice experience for the fish, in fact it can be fatal. If you're the type of person who doesn't care about their livestock enjoying a quality of life, then I recommend you find a new hobby. If you do care about them like I think you do, then I recommend you wait until you've had your first ammonia spike. Read up on the nitrogen cycle if you need to understand what this means. Algae is one sign, but the reason you're waiting to add livestock is due to the presence of ammonia. I know you've been monitoring and testing, and if you haven't seen ammonia yet, then the cycle hasn't completed. You do need to introduce some food for the bacteria to eat, though. One way is to feed the tank a few flakes of food every day to get things going. Generally, the nitrogen cycle can take up to 4 weeks to complete. Once you've had your ammonia spike and get back to 0, then you know it's safe to introduce other living creatures into your system.\n\nGenerally, when your tank has developed diatoms, your next step is to add your clean up crew, followed shortly by fish and corals. Remember, do it S L O W L Y. Your system adjusts each time you increase the bioload. Too much of an adjustment at once can be detrimental to your success.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions, and enjoy the new tank!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420336995", "subreddit": "ReefTank", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Register at the bottom of our website for a chance to be one of the ten lucky people to receive a Case for free.\n\n\n&gt;Read more at w w w . c a s e - w a l l e t (dot) c o m\nWe built a dedicated hardware wallet that's easier to use than a credit card and more secure than a bank vault... a grandma-proof bitcoin wallet. We promise to deliver on both of these fronts. No compromises.\n\n&gt;A wallet that fits in your wallet\n\n&gt;Multi-signature, multi-factor\n\n&gt;Works worldwide\n\n&gt;Designed and built in the USA\n\n&gt;Why We Exist\n\n&gt;Needless to say, we are huge fans of Bitcoin. We believe it holds the promise of a reimagined finance industry so our ultimate mission is the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, the existing ecosystem of bitcoin wallets fails to address the difficulty of using and securing bitcoin. Software wallets fall prey to viruses, malware, hackers, and physical theft or loss. Anyone who thinks that we can educate general consumers about the importance of backing up their private keys or the diligence required to avoid installing some kind of malware is sadly mistaken. The first cloud wallets were also insecure because they are still accessed from a general purpose computing device that can download stuff from the Internet, so no matter how secure those servers are, there’s still a single point of failure and a pretty weak one at that.\nTo fix “the security problem” cloud wallets began to add two-factor authentication, which greatly reduced the odds of your wallet being compromised but think about the sequence of steps required to buy a cup of coffee – unlock your phone, launch the wallet app, click Send BTC, scan a QR code, minimize the app, launch Google Authenticator, copy the 2FA code, switch back to the wallet app, paste the 2FA code, and hit send. That’s ten steps! The pursuit of security has created complexity and led to an extremely cumbersome experience relative to existing payment options like credit cards, destroying any incentive for the average user to adopt Bitcoin.\nSecurity and ease-of-use can’t exist on a spectrum where you get one or the other, or a compromise of the two. The promise of Bitcoin is too great to settle or make a compromise and that’s why we are building Case. We like to say that we’re building the world’s first grandma-proof bitcoin wallet and while that’s a cheesy marketing line, it really does speak to the ethos of what we’re doing. A wallet doesn’t just need to be hacker-proof. It has to be user-proof. It has to be easier to use than a credit card and more secure than a bank vault or the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin will remain but a dream.\n\n&gt;How Case Works\n\n&gt;When you press the ฿ button, the device turns on and jumps right into the “Send bitcoin sequence”. The ฿ button also cycles through the other features of the wallet but we wanted “Send” to be one click away since that’s the primary purpose of a payment device. After a quick view of the spiffy splash screen you see in the picture above, the camera turns on so you can scan the payment info QR code. The screen shows what the camera sees so you can use it as viewfinder to make scanning the QR code easier. Once Case detects and reads the QR code, the screen shows you the amount and address, asking you to swipe your finger to confirm the transaction. That’s it – click, scan, swipe; three easy steps that take less time than swiping a credit card, printing the signature receipt, and putting your John Hancock down on that piece of paper.\n\n&gt;Read to bottom of our website to learn how you can be one of the first to receive our product.

{"body": "If you want to sound Dorian, then play A Dorian over your A minor chord. Anytime you want to sound like the scale you're naming, you just play that scale in the key of your song.\n\n\n**IF YOU WANT A DETAILED EXPLANATION READ BELOW**\n\nIn order to see the differentiating value of scales, you need to use Parallel Mode Comparison. What we will do here is line up the two scales to give you an idea of what makes Dorian unique from Aeolian (The standard minor scale).\n\nHere's A Aeolian and A Dorian lined up with their note compositions in A minor:\n\n**Aeolian:**\n\nA B C D E F G\n\n**Dorian:**\n\nA B C D E F# G\n\n\nWhat makes Dorian sound like Dorian is that it's 6th note (F) is sharpened. (^*Quick ^aside: ^Not ^actually ^sharpened, ^but ^returned ^to ^it's ^original ^\"Natural\" ^state, ^but ^that's ^an ^advanced ^concept*). It is that sharp 6th that when played against the key of A makes you *feel* Dorian.\n\n**That is why D Dorian does not work over A minor when you wanna sound \"Dorian\"**. This is D Dorian's notes:\n\nD E F G A B C\n\nThe notes order doesn't matter in a solo obviously, so when you play D Dorian over A minor it sounds just like A Aeolian (same notes!). \n\n**ANOTHER EXAMPLE**\n\nPutting the modes next to each other with Parallel Mode Comparison is how you learn to differentiate between the different modal qualities. Each comparison will show you the specific \"Flavor note\" that makes a mode distinct *from it's source*. The source is always the main major or minor scale. \n\nSo if you are trying to learn Mixolydian major in the key of C, and want to know why it's special (where is the flavor note), then compare it against the source:  Ionian (the major scale!) in the key of C\n\n**C Ionian:** \n\nC D E F G A B\n\n**C Mixolydian:**\n\nC D E F G A Bb\n\n\nPretty easy to see the flavor note in Mixolydian.

{"body": "Sorry for being away so long. The album exclusives, school, and a vacation to Wisconsin threw me off schedule. I loved the preview of this.\n\nThe beginning is really good. It starts off with such immediate energy, and immediately builds up pressure, so it really gets you excited. EMEL’s vocals are incredible here. Personally I thought her vocals were the one problem with Moving On, and this is a huge improvement. Her vocals were pretty good in Eagle Eyes, but even that performance is crushed by this. I also really like the distortion on her voice. It makes it sound better, but it’s not so much that it takes away from the emotion in her voice. The piano in the background is nice too. Then the verse ends and the melody kicks. The melody is really good as it is in most happy hardcore songs. Another part about this section I like is the vocals in the background. The part where she says “Stronger!” really hits you. The buildup isn’t too special, but it’s not bad at all. I really like the growls thrown in. The drop is everything I hoped for on the buildup. The kicks are well done, and although they aren’t as prominent as in hardstyle, the changing pitch is cool. Once again, the melody is amazing. The end of the drop is also very cool. It goes from a standard happy hardcore track, to suddenly using a lot of drum &amp; bass elements. The bass is really good at this point, and so are the growls. Then it transitions nicely back to a similar intro of EMEL’s vocals over a piano and some ambience. It’s once again quite good. The heavy buildup is back. Whoa. The drop is completely unexpected. I would like to see someone find another song that transitions from happy hardcore to neurofunk and does it well. I’ve mentioned before that neuro isn’t my favorite genre, but this is amazing. The bass is very well done, and unlike many neuro songs, it doesn’t feel like the only thing going on is the bass. This part is just as good as the happy hardcore part. Speaking of the happy hardcore part, there is then a brilliant breakdown and transition to the happy hardcore drop. The production quality of this is amazing. I don’t think many producers would be able to pull off a hybrid like this this well. The outro is also outstanding. I hate it when producers make their outros just last a few seconds. This song has a great, long, drawn out outro that is once again a great transition from uplifting and melodic to dark and heavy. There’s some great ambience in the background that gives it a creepy feel.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nI know, it’s kinda dumb that I’m giving the first song of 021 and 2015 a 10/10, but this is such a good song, and I can’t find anything not to like about it. This is easily Stonebank’s best song (There are some better Modulate songs though) and is a huge step up from Step Up. I swear to god I didn’t realize I did that until after I typed it.\n\nThe next release is a new artist! PYLOT (or P Y L O T as his twitter and soundcloud seem to suggest) hasn’t released anything and we know absolutely nothing about him, so I don’t really know what to expect. It will probably be previewed in the podcast today. I hope it’s nu disco and not indie dance, because currently Televisor is the only nu disco artist on the roster.\n\n/r/redkadathreviews", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420550179", "subreddit": "Monstercat", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Learn different chord voicings? Pick a chord and play the same notes in 3 different positions. Going past the 12 fret is cheating. \n\nApproaching scales that way? Well,  I gave the 6 string pattern for G major. I can write out the 5 string pattern as well. Once you have those scales memorized then playing your 12 major scales is easy. You're just sliding a pattern around. The danger with this is that the scale can start to tell you what to play. It's easy to get in a box and revert to playing the scales in sequence. To circumvent this, don't play the scale in order all the time. If you really want to get good you slow down and learn the sound of each note in the key. You play the scale in 3rds, I III, II IV, III V, IV VI, V VII, VI VIII. I already listed the tab for G major, so let's stay there. \n\nLow E: 3(I)  A:2(III) \n\nLow E: 5(II)  A: 3(IV)\n\nA: 2(III) 5(V)\n\nA:3 (IV) D:2(VI)\n\nA:5(V)  D:4(VII)\n\nD:2(VI) 5(VIII)\n\nIn standard notation this is much easier to write out. G B A C B D C E D F#(or Gb, depending) E G. Once you learn the scale and can play it out of sequence like this learn the names of the notes in this scale. I'm teaching intervals and this helps train your ear and makes it easier to hear what other people do, and it forces you to think about what you're playing. You can get very technical in one scale very quickly with varying intervals. A brief example would be to go up a 6th, down a 3rd and span two octaves. This puts you in string skip territory and you get some really cool sounds, but you need a basis first. \n\nBut you don't want to be a one trick wonder, so you do this scale for a week and learn it really well, you find a song in G major and play over it, learn what sounds good, then next week you do D major, with the G major scale as a warmup. Play it bottom to top to bottom, top bottom to top, and in 3rds. Then learn the D major scale. After D you do A. You go around the circle of 5ths until you're back at G. In 12 weeks you learn all the major scales, and this is with 10 minutes of scale practice a day. It's not that difficult at all. It's just doing it. The circle of 5ths is all over Google, but I'll list it here anyway. (don't worry, if you keep with it some day this will all be memorized for you too! And you'll be damn good at guitar, and have a huge leg up on any other instruments you decide to play) we started in G, so I'll go around the circle of 5ths back to G. G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# F C G. I'm from a jazz world, so I never write those with sharps, but you probably know Gb as F# and Db as C#. So I just maintained consistency from there on out. \n\nOh and the 5 string major scale pattern! Again, staying in G, \n\nA 10 12\n\nD 9 10 12 \n\nG 9 11 12\n\nB 10 12 13\n\nE 10 12 14 15\n\nIt doesn't work out as nicely when you go up to the second octave on a five string pattern, but you should learn it. \n\nOnce you know all the major scales with 6 and 5 string patterns modes become very easy. But I'll leave it here for now. This is already a lot to practice! \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420552634", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "It's time for [another anti-tutorial](http://gelisam.blogspot.ca/2014/07/reactive-banana-anti-tutorial.html)! That is, I don't yet know anything about netwire, session types, or even what it means for the signal to \"inhibit\", but I'll detail my steps as I try to figure out the answer, and this way we can both learn something.\n\nSo! Let's make sure I understand what your basic wires do. How do I \"eliminate\" or run a wire? Looking at the documentation for [`Wire`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/netwire-5.0.1/docs/Control-Wire-Core.html#t:Wire), I see a function called [`stepWire`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/netwire-5.0.1/docs/Control-Wire-Core.html#v:stepWire) which seems appropriate.\n\n    stepWire :: Monad m =&gt; Wire s e m a b -&gt; s -&gt; Either e a -&gt; m (Either e b, Wire s e m a b)\n\nI need to provide an argument of type `s` and an argument of type `Either e a`, so let's figure out what those types are instantiated at when the wire is `oneIfLessThanTen`.\n\n    &gt; :t stepWire oneIfLessThanTen \n    stepWire oneIfLessThanTen\n      :: Timed NominalDiffTime ()\n         -&gt; Either () Int\n         -&gt; Identity\n              (Either () Int,\n               Wire (Timed NominalDiffTime ()) () Identity Int Int)\n\nSo `s` is `Timed NominalDiffTime ()`, `e` is `()`, and `a` is `Int`. I can also see that the monad `m` is not `IO` as I expected, but `Identity`, so I'll have to call `runIdentity` on the result.\n\nI'm not familiar with `Timed NominalDiffTime ()`, how do I create such a value?\n\n    &gt; :info Timed\n    data Timed t s = Timed t s      -- Defined in ‘Control.Wire.Session’\n    [...]\n    instance (Monoid s, Real t) =&gt; HasTime t (Timed t s)\n    instance (Monoid s, Num t) =&gt; Monoid (Timed t s)\n\n`Monoid`, great! `NominalDiffTime` probably has a `Num` instance, so let's simply use `mempty`.\n\n    -- |\n    -- &gt;&gt;&gt; main\n    -- Right 10\n    -- Left ()\n    -- Left ()\n    -- Right 9\n    main :: IO ()\n    main = do\n        let w1 = oneIfLessThanTen\n        let (r, w2) = runIdentity (stepWire w1 mempty (Right 9))\n        print r\n        let (r, w3) = runIdentity (stepWire w2 mempty (Right 11))\n        print r\n        let (r, w4) = runIdentity (stepWire w3 mempty (Left ()))\n        print r\n        let (r, w5) = runIdentity (stepWire w4 mempty (Right 8))\n        print r\n\nOkay, so this wire seems to be some kind of state machine which receives and produces an `Either () Int` at every step, and this particular state machine doesn't seem to use its state at all, behaving the same at every step.\n\nThat test code was very repetitive, so I'd write a function to automate this, except you mention a function `testWireM` which probably does the same thing.\n\n    testWireM :: (Monad m', MonadIO m, Show b, Show e) =&gt; (forall a. m' a -&gt; m a) -&gt; Session m s -&gt; (forall a. Wire s e m' a b) -&gt; m c\n\nOh great! This `M` version mentions two monads `m'` and `m`, because it expects that I want to run my wire in a monad other than `Identity` (aka `m'`). And indeed I do, as I want to use `IO` (aka `m`) to print the results. I don't see any obvious way to tell `testWireM` which inputs to use at every step nor when to stop, so I assume that this is handled by this `Session m s` argument.\n\n    Session :: m (s, Session m s) -&gt; Session m s\n\nOkay, so a session seems really similar to our earlier state machine, except it produces an `s` value at every step instead of an `Either () Int`, it doesn't take input at every step nor ever, and because of the distinction between `m` and `m'`, I can have it run in the monad of my choice instead of `Identity`. I don't see any way of terminating the interaction, and now that I look at the type of `testWireM` again, that makes sense: the return value is `m c`, for an arbitrary `c` which doesn't occur in any of the input arguments, so `testWireM` probably runs forever. Whatever, if `m` is `IO`, I can simply call [`exitSuccess`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/System-Exit.html#v:exitSuccess) when I'm done.\n\n    sessionFromList :: [s] -&gt; Session IO s\n    sessionFromList [] = Session exitSuccess\n    sessionFromList (s:ss) = Session $ return (s, sessionFromList ss)\n\nWait a minute. This session object will produce a bunch of `s` values, but from where will our wire obtain its `Either () Int` input? Oh, I see! Now that I again look at the type of `testWireM` more carefully, I notice that the type of the wire argument is `(forall a. Wire s e m' a b)`, which we can specialize to `(forall a. SimpleWire a b)`. So it only works with wires which ignore their input, allowing the input type to be anything at all! No wonder you had trouble running `testWireM`.\n\nOkay, whatever. So what was the question again? How to implement `loopWire`? Now that I know how to run the wire for a single step, I can adapt your code to use `mempty` at every step instead of iterating over a Session.\n\n    loopWire :: SimpleWire Int Int -&gt; Int -&gt; IO ()\n    loopWire w e = do\n        let (result, newWire) = runIdentity (stepWire w mempty (Right e))\n        case result of\n           Left _ -&gt; putStrLn \"Signal inhibited.\"\n           Right v -&gt; do putStrLn (\"Value: \" ++ show v)\n                         loopWire newWire v\n\n    -- |\n    -- &gt;&gt;&gt; main\n    -- Value: 1\n    -- Value: 2\n    -- Value: 3\n    -- Value: 4\n    -- Value: 5\n    -- Value: 6\n    -- Value: 7\n    -- Value: 8\n    -- Value: 9\n    -- Value: 10\n    -- Signal inhibited.\n    main :: IO ()\n    main = loopWire oneIfLessThanTen 0", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420553138", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ita because it's on the black keys of the piano. The group of black notes form what we call the pentatonic scale (for five tones). This collection has some special properties, namely that it is an extremely consonant set of notes. \n\nHere is what we call the \"interval class vector\" of this collection. It tabulates all of the intervals between all the pitches. \n\n032140\n\nThis is how to read this: in this set of notes, there are no half steps, there are 3 whole steps (Db to Eb, Gb to Ab, Ab to Bb), there are 2 minor thirds (Eb to Gb and B) to Db), there is a single major third (Gb to Bb),  there are 4 perfect fourths, and there are no tritones. \n\nTake a look at [this table](http://solomonsmusic.net/pcsets.htm). Numbers 70 through 135 are all the five note collections that are possible. You can tell by the second column, which all have 5-numbers. That first 5 is what tells you how many notes are in the collection. The fourth column is the interval class vector for all of these. Scan through all of the five note sets, you'll notice that only one set is flanked by 0s on either side, our pentatonic scale (number 130 in the table). Half steps and tritones are the most dissonant intervals on the piano. So the fact that this is the only collection of five notes where you'll never get either of those is pretty significant. \n\nIn short, it is literally impossible to get the harshest intervals in the western world using only black keys. As a result, you could essentially play whatever you want on the black keys, and it will be a nice collection of intervals. \n\nWhy is this? It is because the pentatonic scale is what we call a \"maximally even set.\"  you cannot distribute 5 things perfectly evenly into a space that allows for 12 things. But you can get close, and the pentatonic scale is the closest you can get. There's no way to distribute five notes *more* evenly into the 12 tones of the piano than in the pentatonic scale. \n\nOther maximally even sets are also super important. For instance, the diatonic scale (like C major) is the maximally even set of seven notes. Now, take the seven notes of the diatonic scale as your space (so C D E F G A and B). Turns out the consonant triads (the major and minor chords) are the maximally even set of 3 into this seven-note space. And the dominant seventh and half diminished (or min7b5) seventh chords are the maximally even set of 4 notes into 7. So much of Western Music is built upon maximally even sets, and maximally even sets within maximally even sets!

{"body": "That's the joke it seems he's trying to make but if you want we can break it down further. Let's look at the geography of Kansas City\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri#Geography\n\n&gt;The warmest month of the year is July, with a 24-hour average temperature of 81.0 °F (27.2 °C). The summer months are warm but can get hot and moderately humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico, and high temperatures surpass 100 °F (38 °C) on 5.6 days of the year, and 90 °F (32 °C) on 47 days.[19][20] The coldest month of the year is January, with an average temperature of 31.0 °F (−0.6 °C). Winters are cold, with 22 days where the high temperature is at or below 32.0 °F (0.0 °C) and 2.5 nights with a low at or below 0 °F (−18 °C).[19] The official record highest temperature is 113 °F (45 °C), set on August 14, 1936 at Downtown Airport, while the official record lowest is −23 °F (−31 °C), set on December 22 and 23, 1989.[19] Normal seasonal snowfall is 13.4 inches (34 cm) at Downtown Airport and 18.8 in (48 cm) at Kansas City International Airport. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 31 to April 4, while for measurable (0.1 in or 0.25 cm) snowfall, it is November 27 to March 16 as measured at Kansas City International Airport. Precipitation, both in frequency and total accumulation, shows a marked uptick in late spring and summer.\n\nAs you can see, the weather in KC is highly variable. Humans are warm blooded mammals, and undergo homeostasis in order to survive. Humans cannot live more than several minutes in sub zero temperatures without the appropriate equipment, and experience discomfort in cold weather otherwise. Coincidentally, football season is traditionally in the fall-winter, and many humans may simply choose not to deal with the cold regardless of their fandom, especially in a city with such highly variable seasonal weather such as Kansas City. So, L I T E R A L L Y, these people could be called fair-weather fans/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420655301", "subreddit": "sports", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Same goes for Gangplank Q.).  For Nasus, you should max E second and attack anything you can when withered so the effect is not as bad. This way you can easily win trades with him as he has nothing to stop you if he can't hit his Qs and his wither is next to useless.\n\nI am currently trying out to max E first for some matchups because the steroid itself is crazy and can be amazing level 2 cheese all in that often results in first blood (I level Q E if my lane opponent has an escape and W E if he doesn't).

{"body": "I don't like superheroes.\n\n\"Emeragerd gamma radiation now I can turn into a massive green mutant on command!\" I mean, come on. If that was *plausible* whatsoever, Florida would be a very dangerous place. Grumpy seniors who are not only bad drivers, but *superhumanly* bad drivers. Yeeks.\n\nThough one I never minded was Superman. Alien lands on Earth. Boom. Done. Comically simple. But still kinda irked me.\n\nThat would *never* happen, I said, a superhuman wouldn't just drop from the sky!\n\nWell, tell that to me now.\n\nSo there I was, a sophisticated connoisseur, consuming the finest of anthropomorphic art (code for furry porn) one late Saturday night. I received a message while I was enjoying a lovely depiction of a vixen in red lace.\n\n\\&gt; he's done ;)\n\nBelow that was a link.\n\nMy heart fluttered.\n\nThe first commission of *my* character. Oooh, I couldn't wait to see that green-eyed German Shepherd of mine. I opened the link.\n\nThere was a massive *bang,* a flash out my window, and I whirled around just in time to see a fireball streak past my window. It burned a hole through the wall of pine trees and branches that separated my lawn from the field behind it, and I saw one last magnificent flash as it skidded to a halt in the feild, leaving the ground behind it burned and charred.\n\nMy art would have to wait. A plane had crashed. Well what I thought was a plane, anyways.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight, coat, and a crowbar. I trudged through the field, rushing as fast as the glue-like mud would allow. I approached the wreckage, and turned on the flashlight.\n\nIt wasn't a plane.\n\nI recognized the rear of the car instantly. Horizontal headlights stretching the entire width of the car. D O D G E across the bumper, with the elusive R/T badge underneath.\n\nA travesty. A 1969 Dodge Charger lay in ruin before me. Such a shame. An R/T sells for at least $50k in my area.\n\nThen it hit me.\n\n*A car?* I looked back to the smoldering hole in my trees. What was a *car* doing here?\n\nHad I followed the wrong trail of destruction and embers? Was this just some drunk redneck that crashed in the exact same place as the thing that flew past my window.\n\nI looked back to the hole in my trees. Nope. That Charger was most definitely the thing that flew past my window. The hole was comically Charger-shaped.\n\nBut how? And out all the cars to burrow holes in my trees, why a 1969 Charger? Why *my* dream car? Is this proof that God exists? Is he fucking *trolling* me?\n\nHe fell out of the sky like Superman (see? The rant at the beginning *wasn't* pointless!).\n\nThen I heard noise. A groan.\n\n*Somebody's inside.*\n\nI rushed to the driver's side door, and tried to open it. The frame was bent too much, it wouldn't open. I could see the figure writhing inside, a shadow barely illuminated by the flames outside. I knocked on the window.\n\n\"You alright in there?\"\n\n\"...no...\" the voice - eerily similar to mine - was in pain. \"I think my leg's broken. I hurt my back too.\"\n\n\"I can't get the door. I'm prying it open!\" I slammed the tool into the crack between the door and the body, silently mourning the destruction I was bringing to my own *dream* car.\n\nThe door finally opened. I reached around and undid the seatbelt, leaning on the figure inside. He grunted. He felt... squishy. Not like fat or gore, but the type of softness you feel from-\n\n*Fur?*I shook that nonsense out of my head as I dragged the figure out. He screamed as his leg fell.\n\nI mean sure, he does drive my dream car (and hence the dream car of my fursona), but to be covered in fur? I grabbed my flashlight. *There's no way-*\n\nI flicked it on.\n\nSo, there I was, face-to-face with my fursona. Anthropomorphic German Shepherd with his left ear folded over, green eyes, and wearing jeans and a hoodie. A real, flesh-and-fur being.\n\nAnd he was bleeding before me. We winced and skewed his eyes shut at my light. He was bleeding from the corner of his mouth. His hoodie was peppered in tears, with scrapes and bleeding cuts behind them. His right leg was bent at an odd angle, denim tatterred, and covered in wounds. Then I noticed a sizable blood trail.\n\nFuck.\n\n\"That bad?\" he asked, swallowing. *Oh god he heard me.*\n\n\"I... I need to roll you over. I think you're bleeding on the other side.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nI pushed him over, and he screamed again as his broken leg was twisted. I found the source of blood; a massive gash in his lower back. I could see it through the torn hoodie.\n\n\"I've gotta get you out of here.\" I grabbed his shoulder. He yelped like a dog. I jumped back.\n\n\"...I think my shoulder's messed up too.\"\n\nI managed to get him into a fireman's carry and get him back to my house. God forbid anybody else *found* him.\n\nHis eyes were still closed, wincing in pain and at the bright lights inside. I slowly set him down on my couch. I didn't bother putting down bedsheets; I was replacing it soon anyways.\n\n\"I'll be right back.\"\n\nI ran to my bathroom and grabbed the first aid kit. Looked a little meager for what I was about to do. I walked back into the room.\n\nOur eyes met. He froze. Then cocked his head.\n\n\"...what are you? Lizard? Pig?\"\n\n\"I'll explain later.\" If I knew what the hell I was going to explain.\n\nI cut the pant leg off of his broken leg, and made a splint using an unscrewed push broom handle from the garage. I moved on to his torso. I scratched my head.\n\n\"Um... this might be a bit embarassing, but I'll have to get that sweater off.\"\n\n\"Embarassing?\" He slid his good arm out. He wasn't wearing anything under his hoodie. Just how I designed him. \"Embarrassed about what?\"\n\n*More like embarrassing for me.*\n\n\"...nevermind.\" I gently tugged the other sleeve off. There was a bulge in his shoulder. \"Shit.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Dislocated. I have to put it back.\"\n\n\"...that's going to hurt, isn't it?\" I put my hands in position around the joint.\n\n\"Sorry.\" There was a squish, and he yelped like a dog again. It made my ears ring. He gently massaged his shoulder as he whined.\n\n\"David, I'm gonna have to bandage that gash on your back.\"\n\nHe froze and narrowed his eyes at me.\n\n\"How did you know my name?\"\n\n*Oh shit...* This was going to be a tough explanation.\n\nFortunately, I didn't have to. He looked over my shoulder at my computer screen. I followed his gaze. Green eyes. Folded left ear. A perfectly accurate depiction of him. Standing on a balcony, hoodie in hand, showcasing the scar on his back.\n\nThe scar he earned that night.\n\nAnd the scar that was bleeding all over my couch.

{"body": "the magnets in japan change their polarity  to push the train forward.  This is done via electric magnets, which require power  basically the magnets on the track are permanent magnets like on your fridge.  the train has electric magnets that can change their north and south poles.

{"body": "I think what your friend is talking about is the union of events. \n\nIf A is the event you get accepted to school A, and B the even you get accepted to school B, etc...,  then, according to your probabilities:\n\nP(A) = .055, P(B)=.08, P(C)=.145, P(D)=.19, P(E)=.235\n\nIf the events were mutually exclusive you could add them together, but they are not, since getting accepted to one school doesn't preclude you from getting accepted to a 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th school. So you cannot add them up, you need to take into consideration the possibility of being accepted to more than 1 school, otherwise you'd be double counting. If this doesn't make sense look up Venn diagrams and the union of mutually exclusive events vs non mutually exclusive events.\n\nSome background: In set theory the probability of either A or B or both occurring is referred to as the union of A and B and is written P(A U B). If A and B are mutually exclusive events: \n\n P(A U B) = P(A)+P(B)\n\nIf A and B are NOT mutually exclusive, then:\n\n  P(A U B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both A and B occurring, referred to as the intersection of A and B. If A and B are independent, which in this case I think they are, then:\n\n P(A ∩ B) = P(A)*P(B)\n\nExtending this to the 5 events, the general pattern is:\n\n * Add the probabilities of the individual events.\n * Subtract the probabilities of the intersections of every pair of events.\n * Add the probabilities of the intersection of every set of three events.\n * Subtract the probabilities of the intersection of every set of four events.\n * Continue this process until the last probability is the probability of the intersection of the total number of sets that we started with.\n\nSo for the grand finale, we get:\n\nP(A U B U C U D U E) = P(A)+P(B)+P(C)+P(D)+P(E)-P(A ∩ B)-P(A ∩ C)-P(A ∩ D)-P(A ∩ E)-P(B ∩ C)-P(B ∩ D)-P(B ∩ E)-P(C ∩ D)-P(C ∩ E)-P(D ∩ E)+P(A ∩ B ∩ C)+P(A ∩ B ∩ D)+P(A ∩ B ∩ E)+P(A ∩ C ∩ D)+P(A ∩ C ∩ E)+P(A ∩ D ∩ E)+P(B ∩ C ∩ D)+P(B ∩ C ∩ E)+**P(B ∩ D ∩ E)**+(C ∩ D ∩ E)-P(A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D)-P(A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ E)-P(A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D)-P(A ∩ C ∩ D ∩ E)-P(B ∩ C ∩ D ∩ E)+P(A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D ∩ E)\n\n And remember for the probability of the intersections, since the events here are independent, you can simply multiply them. For example, P(A ∩ B) =P(A)*P(B)=(.055)*(.08)=.0044 and P(A ∩ B ∩ C)=P(A)*P(B)*P(C)=(.055)*(.08)*(.145)=.000638.\n\nDisclaimer: I know how to do this in theory but never actually had to calculate the union of 5 events so its possible I messed that equation up. Also it's so tedious that I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to calculate :P\n\nedit: formatting", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420734721", "subreddit": "AskStatistics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

I usually go for R Q E W for this reason.\n\nBtw: You can hit so fast after E because E is an AA reset. Your ult consists of AAs - this is while you apply on hit effects and also proc your passive and also can get the maxed MS and AS if you hit E before ulting.\n\nSpeaking of her passive: Hitting things with her will improve her health regen immensly. This effect can be stacked four times if attacking enemy champions. This is also the reason you \"didn't took any damage\" when you tower dived Kassadin. Tower hit you once but you healed it back with passive.\n\nBest boot options are actually Ionian boots, mercs and ninjas. Remember you are spellcaster and your ult does not only mean ridiculous damage but also survival, so more ults = better. \n\nGraves are not good on her if you ask me as you have the AS/MS steroid on E anyway and like I said - more spells are simply better on her.\n\nBuildin BT can be viable mid or late game but I never rush it. Getting an early brut into BC or youmuus (I like BC more for the procs on ultimate in teamfights and the extra health but ghostblade is definitely viable) and LW lets you melt enemies. Usually this is where I go for BT so that I get the shield and can survive the goddamn thornmail damage.\n\nZhonyas as sixth item is actually funny as your level 5 W will reflect 380 magic damage with it.\n\nThe game was sadly boring -  no ganks on you for the entire game which would have revealed her weakness: hard CC and enemies with a lot of sustain.

He rushes out of the bathroom past Taalik and into the corridor to catch up with Yaasin.\n\nEtienne:  “Urrch!  Ucccha!  Blecch!” and then he rushes back into his room and falls to his knees by the bed gasping and wheezing.

I really hope all this works out.  But I feel so bad about Napoleon and Jose . . .  Wait a minute!  I can call my friend Jon - no, I’d better text him since he’s out partying tonight.  Yeah!

I’ve only got 13% charge left. . . .  There!  Sent.”\n\n“Well, Taalik, I’ve done all I can for my cats.  Maybe when I’ve settled in I can persuade CV to go get my cats.  For now I’ll just . . .

I've gone with an initial attack speed of 3, darts are 2, just so it's not too powerful. Dragon darts max is currently 21, with the increased ranged strength this should be about 25 with the increase in accuracy making you much more likely to hit. I can't be too specific before we actually make it but the aim is to have a powerful fast hitting weapon without making all other range options obsolete across all levels. If once we make it we find the weapon not to be too great based on the information then we'll tweak it. \"\n\n____________\n\nThis post on page 3 of the first devblog suggests that it was SUPPOSED to be 1 tick slower than darts in the first place.\n\nThe original blowpipe @ shortbow speed was absolutely awful.

The community gave feedback based on this and then we ended up with something comparable to the MSB(i)/KCB in terms of accuracy and ranged strength, but they ended up making it dart speed anyway for some reason.\n\nIt would be perfectly balanced right now if they had given it the appropriate 1.8s attack speed (rapid) like we originally thought it was going to get.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420767169", "subreddit": "2007scape", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

The hope is that by creating a system to understand what has worked in the past, we will be able to replicate the results and push the music further in the future.\n\nBecause theory is just a way of coding sounds, there are a lot of made up terms that try to describe what you hear.

The difference between a major and minor scale will lie in the distances between these 7 notes relative to each other.\n\nA major scale has a note let's call it \"1,\" then the next note in the scale (\"2\") is a whole step above 1.  So we say the first interval of the major scale is a whole step.  \n\nThe major scale ends up looking like this:\n1 -Whole-&gt;2 -Whole-&gt;3-Half-&gt;4-Whole-&gt;5-Whole-&gt;6-Whole-&gt;7-Half-&gt;back to 1.\n\nso Whole Whole Half Whole Whole Whole Half.\n\nMinor scales have the following pattern:\n1-Whole-&gt;2-Half-&gt;3-Whole-&gt;4-Whole-&gt;5-Half-&gt;6-Whole-&gt;7-Whole-&gt;back to 1\n\nWhole Half Whole Whole Half Whole Whole\n\nLet's use C major as a real life example:\nC Major scale = C D E F G A B C\nC to D = Whole\nD to E = Whole\nE to F = Half\nF to G = Whole\nG to A = Whole\nA to B = Whole\nB to C = Half\n\nHere's C minor:\nC D Eb F G Ab Bb\n\nC to D = Whole\nD to Eb = Half\nEb to F = Whole\nF to G = Whole\nG to Ab = Half\nAb to Bb = Whole\nBb to C = Whole\n\nDoes that help?

{"body": "Today, I saw a number of snipped wires, all the same color and length, on the street in front of someone's house, as if an electrician had parked there and cut a lot wire for something and just let all the snipped remnants fall there, or maybe had brushed them out of the truck sliding side door. They were spread out enough but close and touching enough for me to wonder if they formed a word. I looked at them from a couple of directions, but they didn't.   \n\nMy first thought was whether I should pick them up and dispose of them, but I don't put things in other people's residential cans. Next, I thought that I might stop and form them into the word L O V E so that anyone coming by would see that, but then I realized that maybe the greatest form of love was to just leave them there and appreciate them just for what they are.   \n\nAs soon as I thought that, I had an arms-spread-wide-moment (which I did show in my arms going wide open), feeling like I was open to the world and taking it all in and loving it just as it is.  \n\nBefore I'd seen the wires, the thought had come to mind that love does not take offense. It made me wonder if I've been the one my entire life to love insufficiently, because there are so many times when I do hurt myself over things with the way I think about them and think of how they affect me and/or might affect me in the future, which seems similar to taking offense at something.  \n\nAnyway, all of that thinking together made me realize that I can do a better job of loving everything in the world and it can start with me not hurting myself over things and accepting everything just as it is.  : )", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420834952", "subreddit": "LetsChat", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Helium has a lifting force of 1 gram per liter. So if you have a balloon that contains 5 liters of helium, the balloon can lift 5 grams.\nA normal balloon at an amusement park might be 30 centimeters (about 1 foot) in diameter. \n\nTo determine how many liters of helium a sphere can hold, the equation is 4/3 x pi x r x r x r. The radius of a 30-centimeter-diameter balloon is 15 centimeters, so:\n4/3 x pi x 15 x 15 x 15 = 14,137 cubic centimeters = 14 liters\n\nSo a normal amusement park balloon can lift about 14 grams, assuming that the weight of the balloon itself and the string is negligible.\n\nIf you weigh 90 kilograms (about 198.5 pounds), then you weigh 90,000 grams. Divide your 90,000 grams by the 14 grams per balloon and you find that you need 6428 balloons to lift your weight. You might want to add 500 more if you actually would like to rise at a reasonable rate. So you need roughly 7,000 balloons to lift yourself if you weigh 90 kilograms, and you can adjust that number according to your weight.\n\nSo when secured to the ground, given that the balloons would be enough to lift your weight, they could also strangle you due to to the helium's lifting force.\n\nThat's a lot of balloons.

{"body": "Has the stage clown magician ever asked you to be his assistant when you were a kid? And he gave you one little red softball into one hand and a yellow one into the other and told you to close your small 8-year-old fists around them? Then he did his magic, waving his wand and stuff, and then he asked you if you could feel the ball crawling into your left sleeve, and you said no, and he made a silly joke, and everybody laughed, embarrassing you a little, so you went with it and said \"yeah, I can feel it!\". And then it goes down your shirt, and you nod, and down your pants and the other way up and into the other arm, you nod as he describes it, and then he tells you to slooowly open the left hand, and it's empty! And the right hand... it's both the red and the yellow softball! Applause! And you grin and your mother asks you \n\n\"DID YOU REALLY FEEL IT?\" and you meekly say no and she asks why you lied then, disappointment in her voice. On the way home, you wonder how the magician tricked you. \n\n---\n\nYou know... it has always been a truism that government can't handle money. That's the official reason why private central banks are considered the best invention since the back-scratcher ever. So the government, or its agencies, wasting money is not a conspiracy, it is systemic. Responsible bookkeeping will at least always make sure what the money was wasted on, so when shit happens, someone can be held _accountable_. Because in a society, we are somewhat responsible for when our shit happens, but when the shit is put into sewers, all will be well. That is why irresponsible bookkeeping can get you into jail, if you own a small business. That's as if you built a catapult to throw your shit all over the place. Because if there is money in the books that is unaccounted for, it will be assumed you put it into your pocket without paying taxes for it. You will be tried for tax fraud, which is a serious offense. Now in this case, it is a government agency that has money in its books that is unaccounted for. You can't put an agency into jail. What do you do?\n\nTaxpayer's democratically elected man to do the best in the interest of the nation regarding its military safety decides he has had enough of his agencies' bad bookkeeping and therefor declares war on Pentagon bureaucracy. The very next day, the offices in which the bookkeepers frantically work to make their balance sheets resemble anything like responsible bookkeeping, double-checking every drawer and locker and pocket, under the sofa and in the candy jar, for the missing U$ 2.300.000.000, are utterly destroyed, and with them, all data. \n\nThese two things have nothing to do with each other. This is pure coincidence. \n\nAlso on the next day, even a few minutes before that, two of the tallest skyscrapers in the world are hit by an airborne vehicle at great velocity, resulting in a huge fireball in offices in which also a lot of other money is being looked for. This has to do with the other offices. No, wait, it does not. With the other building. It's the same attack, just different offices and different money and of course different airborne vehicles, but with the same pilots. Not the same pilots, but from the same conspiracy. But the offices and the money have nothing to do with each other. Or do they? No, and even if it's just coincidence, as in: shit happens also coincidentally.\n\nA few heartbeats later, aforementioned towers are weakened so much by the blazing inferno fueled by the kerosene the planes had aboard that they crumble to dust within few seconds.\n\nWhen the skyscraper engineers designed the structure, they made it so it does withstand the plane, because they anticipated it. That was good architecture. With a lot of structural redundancy. That means they also made it so it does withstand office fires, because they looked into their books and knew that shit happens. They looked some more and saw that sometimes, real big shit happens. As in: big, really big. Subtropic hurricanes. Sometimes even earthquakes, although the worst earthquake damage New York ever had to cope with were a few toppled chimneys back in the days when attacks by natives were still a much deadlier threat a few miles to the west. Anyways. Shit happens. Also, at that time: the Russians! They'll paint it red! Shit happens, and with the planes and the fires, the towers were doomed to collapse because jet fuel does not melt steel, it just makes it weak. Once the conditions for collapse initiation were met, total, global, vertical, top-down progressive, gravitational collapse was \n\n| * **I N E V I T A B L E**\n\nbecause W[g] &gt; W[p] by a factor of three. This is easily explained: when the fire weakened the columns, the columns lost half of their strength. That was too much, and as if a match were broken, the sheer weight of all the mass above came crashing down with massive force from almost a whole free fall through the height of one floor, so when that floor gave way also, the lightweight, economic, utterly slender and fragile structure underneath was doomed and crushed under the equivalent of 32 times the force it was designed for, each and every floor in ever faster succession, until the collapse front hit terminal speed and met the ground just a few seconds after the first steel made impact with street level, crushing all 108 other floors in the process.\n\nIt was ~~only coincide...~~ inevitable that later that day, a third skyscraper succumbed to the utter destructive damage sustained by the collapse of aforementioned skyscrapers, resulting in another raging inferno engulfing the Salomon Building, devouring with all-destructive power the very structural integrity of the very building that - coincidentally - also housed offices in which records were kept which only inevitably had nothing to do at all with all the other data about the money. Not that money, the other money. Because when the steel expanded and the concrete did not and one column failed that failure triggered another failure because from all the expanding and sagging and losing strength it pushed itself to the side with mighty force shearing off the bolts until it slid off the bracket which in turn triggered a cascade of failures so the whole thing went kinetic within seconds from the inside out, first looking like warm jelly and then falling into itself until all the air was outside. A few dollar's worth of patching the beams up with spray-on fireproofing foam and two buckets full of shear studs and web stiffeners would have prevented the collapse, but it would be uneconomical to build skyscrapers so massive that they don't collapse because nobody could pay for a building that is so safe you have to make the lower floors small caves in massive walls of cast steel.\n\nThe rest of the complex' buildings partially withstood the onslaught of steel raining down on them, so they were pulled down with heavy machinery and steel ropes, sideways, because that is the easiest way to demolish rectangular frames. \n\nThere is no doubt that terrorists, blinded by ideology, conspired over the course of years to make an end to what they perceived to be a corrupt system, and tried to stop it by making as much shit happen as possible - intentionally! Of course there would be retaliation, wild and fierce - and final. To make sure conflict cannot rise again (Enderverse!). This is what the military is there for, and why it is important to fund it well so the people are safe, that they always are alert and, to the best of their knowledge, power and talent, keep civilians from harm's way. Military is the business of preparation. You prepare, so you can't be surprised, so when the military got surprised the day after its boss declared a war on the bureaucracy of the agency that was running the military, it was only because it was preparing for the surprise which honestly nobody ever could have anticipated and for which there were so many false forewarnings that there was not a single shred of intelligence indicating the terrorists would do something as unexpectable like crashing planes into towers like in the movies, especially since those are the guys the military prepared for attacks on Russians so they can't attack the skyscrapers, the very symbol of the invention of private capital that makes sure the government spends the taxpayer's money responsibly so if shit happens, someone can be held accountable because checks and balances for all the shit. So the military was made ready to attack the land where the terrorist lived who made all that shit happen intentionally and thus accidentally made more shit happen coincidentally which resulted in a series of inevitable shit coming together to make some shit happen to them because only this way coincidental and accidental and inevitable shit can be stopped from happening even more and that's the shitty reason why they shine flashlights into people's asscracks before they are allowed to board airborne vehicles so they don't have shit happen, be it inevitably, coincidentally, intentionally. \n\nAnd of course no one said it was not totally innocent, and it was good that all the guys responsible for all that inevitable, intentional and coincidental shit happening were tried where they admitted their irresponsibility and were held accountable so that does not happen again.

Songs to check out: [Selfishness Of Evil Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8hQhatjgjA) and [False Marriages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7pQIQ4uiSw). \n\nOr **Death Grips** are a pretty obvious one, but they're great. They incorporate a lot of different elctronic, punk, and many other influences into their music. They're abrasive as well, but not as much as B L A C K I E. I like their album *The Money Store* the best. Songs to check out: [Beware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqcTVVUFnKQ), [Get Got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW9H1b7zXUY), and [Hacker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoZgZT4DGSY).\n\n**clipping.** is one of my favorites. They have two fantastic albums under their belt, *midcity* and *CLPPNG*, and I recommend checking out both. *midcity* is much louder and they cut away to noise often times. *CLPPNG* is much more tame with catchier sounds. Songs to check out: [Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxSqnZf5I3E), [Dominoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm9O8yt8H90), and [Work Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2GozE6XEqg).\n\n**Shabazz Palaces** are a strange one. They have a very spacey almost cloud rap style at times and are very jazz/EDM influenced. *Black Up* is easily their best album, but if you want more their whole discography is pretty solid. Songs to check out: [An Echo From The Hosts That Profess Infinitum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXEWj9N8gVg), [Are You...Can You...Were You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnoBIQWS5bs), and [Forerunner Forray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFGLQe65Abg&amp;list=RDGFGLQe65Abg).\n\nThis is probably the weirdest stuff I can find, but here are a few more in the same vein, but maybe a little tamer:\n\nBusdriver - Perfect Hair/Fear Of A Black Tangent\n\nFlash Bang Grenada - 10 Haters\n\nSisyphus - Sisyphus\n\nZeeloperz - HELP\n\nRatking - So It Goes\n\nCaptain Murphy - Duality", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420868295", "subreddit": "hiphop101", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

It's an important aspect of the work and it is the part of the work that leads to high quality design on this planet if done right.\n\n\nAnother thing I just realized: I moved to a more rural area (I am in Europe) and what was very easy about that was SEO. If you are in a big city, you have no chance. \"Designer, NY\" is a google query you will never, ever own. But \"designer in Dullsville\" is something were you can be easily on top. That is part of what I do for me: I work the web in my local area. No big agency, they are all in the trendy cities. So it is doable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420906176", "subreddit": "GraphicDesign", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "To fully understand why B# and C are the same note requires some historical background on the development of western music theory. \n\nOur theory of music is a development of the Ancient Greek system of tetrachords. A tetrachord refers to the strings of lyre with generally 4 to 7 strings. Classically, the lyre (four stringed version) is tuned so that the highest and lowest tones of the tetrachord were fixed to form a perfect fourth and the inner two pitches were adjustable to create different sorts of melodies.  \n\nClassical Greek music theorists defined systems of scales that were composed of stacks of tetrachords that were either joined by a common tone or separated by another tone not belonging to either. Spanning 1.5 ish to 2 octaves, these systems were called Lesser Perfect System (3 tetrachords) and Greater Perfect System (4 tetrachords).\n\nPtolemy, who lived ca 100 - 170 CE, used the Greek alphabet to label the tones, Alpha through Omicron to define two octaves. The scale tones were conceived as descending, where we conceive scale tones as ascending in most cases. \n\n\nThere were three genera of tetrachords: \n1. Diatonic: made up of mostly whole tones with a semitone.\n2. Chromatic: Minor 3rd and two semitones.\n3. Enharmonic: Major 3rd and two quarter tones.\n\n400 years later, Boethius, an Italian polymath, took ideas of Ptolemy and developed a similar system. A major difference was that he used a fixed labeling system rather than the relative label system the Greeks used. He also made use of ascending and descending tetrachords and categorized tetrachords with P4 intervals pentachords with P5 intervals.\n\nBoethius classified a tetrachord or pentachord on the basis of whether it was a diatesseron (P4 from first to last note) and diapente (P5 from first to last note), and classified the Diatesseron and Diapente according to whether it was ascending or descending. Each was then numbered according to where the semitone fell in the chord. The first note of the the first tetrachord in his classification he called a. T = Tone, S = Semitone.\n\nFirst Order of Species (descending tetrachords):\n\nDiatesseron:\n1 TTS - a g f e\n2 TST - g f e d\n3 STT - f e d c\n\nDiapente:\n1 TTTS - b a g f e\n2 TTST - a g f e d\n3 TSTT - g f e d c\n4 STTT - f e d c b\n\nSecond Order of Species (ascending tetrachords):\n\nDiatesseron:\n1 STT - b c d e\n2 TTS - c d e f\n3 TST - d e f g\n\nDiapente\n1 STTT - e f g a b\n2 TTTS - f g a b c\n3 TTST - g a b c d\n4 TSTT - a b c d e\n\n\nFrom his system, he developed the following modes (ascending tones):\n\n1. Hypodorian: TSTTSTT - a b c d e f g a\n2. Hypophrygian: STTSTTT - b c d e f g a b\n3. Hypolydian: TTSTTTS - c d e f g a b c\n4. Dorian: TSTTTST - d e f g a b c d\n5. Phrygian: STTTSTT - e f g a b c d e\n6. Lydian: TTTSTTS - f g a b c d e f\n7. Mixolydian: TTSTTST - g a b c d e f g\n\nWhere Hypolydian has as its tonic A, Hypophrygian has B, Hypolydian has C, etc... \n\nIn modern terminology, the first three modes are renamed Aeloian, Locrian, and Ionian.\n\nBecause of Boethius, there is a semitone between B and C and E and F\n\n\nLater, music theorists did away with using 14 Greek letters for the notes in two octaves and began using just the 7 notes A through G with the Latin Alphabet.\n\nLater theorists also kept the order, but because music began to be predominantly written in the Ionian mode, use Ionian as the basis. With C as a center rather than A. Notice as well that the most intervals are whole tones while just two intervals are semi tones. Boethius used the Diatonic Genus  with its tones  and semitones rather than the Chromatic and Enharmonic Genera with their 3rd and quarter tone intervals. Modern scales are called Diatonic for this reason.\n\nSo to recap, Boethius codified and simplified the Greek scale classifications and chose as his starting point the A minor scale. He did away with intervals larger than a whole tone and smaller than a semitone between successive notes in these scales, but they were still utilized by composers as they still existed in the tuning systems of the time. By the 19th century, 12 Tone Equal Temperament became the dominant tuning system which did away with quarter tones in music, except for color in various instruments that can produce those tones, guitars and violins for instance. \n\nIt was entirely possible to have a B# and a Cb that were actually slightly different notes, and so called enharmonic in reference to the Green nomenclature for quarter tone intervals. But with 12 Tone Equal Temperament, that basically went away. Enharmonic notes now refer to different spellings of the same note rather than to quarter tone intervals.\n\nHope that helps.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420935232", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; And then buffer[1] would be address 9 and so on.\n\nNo.  `buffer[1]` is address 11.  The direction of stack growth refers to the direction that the stack pointer is adjusted when something is pushed or popped.  It doesn't change anything else about the language, such as making array indexing suddenly work in reverse.  Consider a function like this:\n\n    void foo(int a, int b)\n    {\n        char c[6];\n        ...\n    }\n\nAssuming on this particular system that ints and pointers are 4 bytes, that arguments are passed using cdecl calling convention, that there is no stack padding (which is not really a valid assumption), the stack when control reaches `...` above will look like this:\n\n\n\n        c[0]\n          c[1]\n         |  c[2]\n         | |  c[3]\n         | | |  c[4]\n         | | | |  c[5]\n         | | | | |     return \n         | | | | | |   address\n         | | | | | |            a       b\n         | | | | | |    |                \n         | | | | | |    |       |       |\n         | | | | | | +--+--+ +--+--+ +--+--+\n         v v v v v v v     v v     v v     v\n        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n        | : : : : : | : : : | : : : | : : : |\n        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n         ^\n         |\n         |\n       stack\n       pointer\n\nI choose to draw the stack horizontally, because that avoids the up/down confusion.  The order that items were pushed or allocated on the stack is: b, a, return address, c.   Each time you want to add something to the stack, you move the stack pointer to the left by however many bytes the object occupies, and that's the slot created.  That's what it means for the stack to grow downward, or leftward in this case.  It does not mean that indexing of `c` works differently than any other array.  That would be insane: how would you ever know whether a given pointer is supposed to increment leftward or rightward?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1420986696", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Make sure you place your blackfires in such a way that the melee can continue to do positionals without hitting them (ie not too close to the boss, but close enough that melee can keep DPSing). You shouldn't stack whitefires over more than one blackfire anymore - it's not necessary for one, and since the nerf I don't believe it does anything anyway. That should in theory give your melee ample room to DPS without getting overlapped with a white fire unelss one of them has it in which case they have to work out where the other will move.\n\nOtherwise, if communication is happening and all that is happening, then stepping on blackfire or getting hit by a whitefire you're not supposed to is simply inexcusable and repeated mistakes means you need to replace them. Period. \"Don't step here\" is the simplest mechanic in the game and is used in every fight, they should've figured that out by now.\n\nAssign a healer for each tank. Makes it much easier. Remember, C O M M U N I C A T E. Doesn't sound like your group is discussing anything at all. Try to have a Virus up for every Bennu. Between your 2 healers and (presumably) 1 caster you have enough Virus in the raid to get almost every Revelation and definitely every Bennu.\n\nWe do the method of having whoever is tethered to the red fire runs it to the blue fire. I absolutely hate it, but it was decided on as a temporary measure to try to see P3 and people refused to go back to trying it with a runner. Still unhappy about it but we have it on farm now so I guess it's fine, even if extremely suboptimal. I don't understand how it's possible to have spent 15 hours in that fight and never once talked about how you're handling red fire as a group. I think it's time to find a new one.\n\n We also tank the boss in the middle in P2 so that our SMN and SCH can bane dots onto the adds and the melee can just ignore them.\n\nPS: I say this as a lover of alcohol: Nobody should ever be showing up to raid loaded and if they do it repeatedly they need to be replaced ASAP.

My turn.\n\n&gt; Re-introduction of free trade was the death of pyramid- merch/manip clans\n\nThey're still there, it might be on a smaller scale, but they still do it.\n\n&gt; There is no way of knowing what an item is truly valued at as of now, you are able to post illegitimate offers on both zybez and the trading post, however only GE will shift towards the \"true-value\" at which most people are trading at gradually.\n\nAnd majority of the time these illegitimate offers are never even thought about. You can see them if you go into most popular items on the Trading post, the cheapest ones never get contacted because they have their PM off, and the highest ones never get traded because why would you want to buy it for that amount of money, however you still get the ability to haggle. People understand the true value of an item is the ones being priced at the most. e.g. Everyone is trading nature runes at around 230, so the price has to be around 230. With the G.E. you just see that one average price.\n\nThe fallback option would remove anyone who has their PM set off and provide a way to trade through the trading post. (Both players need to be on the same world and be near a trading post)\n\n&gt; buy limits made this difficult to do to an extreme extent, it is still possible to do to a an unrestricted extent through buying out zybez/trading post offers\n\nHowever it is more difficult as mentioned before, the person needs to be constantly be viewing both pieces of data, rather than dumping millions into one interface and waiting for the items to come to them. I understand there is a buy limit in the G.E. being offered, but it still provides an easier way for a group of people to buy out and manipulate an item.\n\n&gt; If you are a filthy casual\n\nDon't understand this, you'd rather pay what the interface is telling you, then try to attempt to secure a better deal for yourself?\n\n&gt; What we see is small quantities of items being sold all undercutting each other whilst bulk quantity holders are pricing theirs substantially higher\nIf person A wants to buy 10,000 of item x, and person B C D E F G H I J K all have 50 of said item, why should they be forced to go through 10 transactions to make all 11 people happy when the GE offers 1. It's just an extremely inefficient system.\n\nThe people undercutting want to sell quick and they're usually off the post as quick as they post them, the people you see with bulk items are sticking to the price, because they understand that for players who need bulk items they're going to come to them, they then have the ability to get a lower price due to the amount they may be buying (the beauty of the trading post). It may be inefficient but it provides various players the ability to play the game they wish to play it. Trading is one major part of the game, you may see it as inefficient but to me its a way i play the game. An example would be PVM, i don't do combat, so does that mean i have the right to say make PVM easier and let me kill those monsters quicker and safer so i can experience that side of the game. \n\n&gt; Have you considered the possibility that there are actual skillers that want to buy a large sum of items for their goals and theyre being forced to sit there and refresh at the trading post as you've said in order to do so?\n\nI'm a skiller myself, i have to buy items in bulk to train certain skills, currently doing that as we speak for fletching. That is still not a reason to introduce a system that has one location that can easily provide me with bulk resources just by the click of one button. It just crashes the prices of items, because people will undercut each other so that they can easily sell the item and drive the one piece of information (average price) down and make people who have loads of the items sell for lower than they wish because the G.E. is just not selling at the price they wish.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421066873", "subreddit": "2007scape", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Were you talking about actual \"guitar\" guitar? Consider this...\n\nIn the early 1990s, a team of psychologists in Berlin, Germany studied violin students. Specifically, they studied their practice habits in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. All of the subjects were asked this question: “Over the course of your entire career, ever since you first picked up the violin, how many hours have you practiced?”\n\nAll of the violinists had begun playing at roughly five years of age with similar practice times. However, at age eight, practice times began to diverge. By age twenty, the elite performers averaged more than 10,000 hours of practice each, while the less able performers had only 4,000 hours of practice.\n\nThe elite had more than double the practice hours of the less capable performers.\n\nNatural Talent: Not Important\n\nOne fascinating point of the study: No “naturally gifted” performers emerged. If natural talent had played a role, we would expect some of the “naturals” to float to the top of the elite level with fewer practice hours than everyone else. But the data showed otherwise. The psychologists found a direct statistical relationship between hours of practice and achievement. No shortcuts. No naturals.\n\nIf you did NOTHING but guitar 24/7... no poops, pees, food, sleep, internet, or a n y t h i n g  other than guitar... you would still have to practice nonstop for 1.14 years to get 10,000 hours of practice.\n\nDo what all of the rest of the players who don't want to commit to practice do.... play bass.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421164425", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Disclaimer: There is not a lot of information available on that subject, so I just looked at my own zippers. I will make some crude simplifications and estimates. I made the following observations:\n\n* The Teeth are made of steel which have a specific heat capacity Cp ~500JKg^-1 K^-1 and a melting point of ~1400°C (~1700 K)\n* The resistance force when I pull them shut is approx. 50 grams, open not so much. But let's take 50 grams (~0.5 N).\n* The zipper has a length of 0.08m which is ~0.1m.\n\nLet's call the speed at which we pull the zipper **u**. So the frequency (1 open/close cycle) is **u**/**2L**. The work done in one cycle is **F** x **2L**. Finally, the Heat produced by this is **f** x **W** [Nms^-1] (or [Watt]). \n\nSo we have the heat generated by the zipping, Q=F x L (I know, this could have been done directly).\n\nNow we have to talk about the heat losses to the environment. There are two primary sources of heat loss:\n\n* Convection by air (we assume stagnant air in this scenario)\n* Radiation heat loss (we assume perfect emissivity of the zipper)\n\nFor both, I will treat the zipper like a steel cylinder with L=0.1m and D=0.005m (length and diameter). Then the total surface is ~0.0015 m^2.\n\nA typical convection heat transfer coefficient is about K=10 W m^2 K^-1. Heat losses are of the form Q_loss = A x K x T (Surface x Coefficient x Temperature).\n\nRadiation heat losses are calculated as Q_rad = sig x A x T^4 where sigma is the stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8).\n\nNow we can do a heat balance on the zipper: The change in temperature times the heat capacity must equal the heat generated by the zipping minus the heat losses by convection and radiation. This results in an ordinary differential equation:\n\nCp x dT/dt = Q - Q_loss - Q_rad\n\nor \n\nCp x dT/dt = F x u - A x K x T - sig x A x T^4.\n\nAssuming that the highest temperature reached is the melting point, the temperature will not change at that point, therefore dT/dt must equal zero. We can now solve for the speed u:\n\nu = F x A x (K x T + sig x T^4) = ~367 ms^-1.\n\nAs we can see, this is ridiculously fast (about mach 1). It is important to note that because of the dependency of the radiation losses on the fourth power of the temperature, small deviations of numerical values can have a rather large impact. However, the point still is valid: You are not going to melt your zippers, no matter how fast you try.\n\nEDIT: made a wrong assumption about the surface of the zipper which linearily scales the heat losses. Still changes nothing about the principal result though.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421172807", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well modes start getting cooler when you start to see them as separate scales which let you color different chords with a different feel, because they offer different intervals. But for this to be worthwhile, you need to brush up on your intervals and arpeggios so that you can really see what's going on on your guitar neck.\n\nAnyway, what I mean is that, if you took your C major scale and all the derivative scales, you would end up with D dorian, E phrygian, F lydian, G mixolydian, A aeolian (or natural minor) and B locrian (or half diminished)\n\nSo \n\n    C D E F G A B major\n    D E F G A B C minor\n    E F G A B C D minor\n    F G A B C D E major\n    G A B C D E F major\n    A B C D E F G minor\n    B C D E F G A dimished\n\nWhich tells you nothing without a musical context because over a C chord it's still c major.\n\nBut the story gets more interesting when you consider them as scales to use over their own chords! So say we pretend that D dorian has nothing to do with C major, and that we're using it over a D chord. What intervals do we get, and how does it relate to a normal D minor scale?\n\n    D dorian: D E F G A B  C\n    D minor:  D E F G A Bb C\n\nSo using the D dorian scale gives you a one note difference to a normal D minor scale, the sixth is raised a half step, giving you a funky sound that is halfway between major and minor (seriously, dorian and mixo are the essence of funk).\n\nLet's check out the other scales in relation to their parallel major scales (skipping ionian and aeolian). We'll use C because it makes all the accidentals (sharps and flats) stand out a bit more. The ionian, lydian and mixolydian scales are major (have a major 3rd), while the dorian, phryigian and aeolian scales are minor (have a minor 3rd). For some reason the ear is most sensitive to the 3rd and 7th when determining tonality.\n\n    MAJOR SCALES\n    C major (ionian, first mode of C major)\n    C D E F G A  B \n    1 2 3 4 5 6  7\n    C lydian\n    C D E F# G A B\n    1 2 3 #4 5 6 7\n    C mixolydian (This one is called dominant because the combo between a major third and a minor 7th is called dominant, because it's strong and manly)\n    C D E F G A Bb\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 b7\n    \n    MINOR SCALES\n    C minor (aeolian, sixth mode of Eb major)\n    C D Eb F G Ab Bb\n    1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7\n    C dorian\n    C D EB F G Ab B \n    1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7\n    C phrygian\n    C Db Eb F G Ab Bb\n    1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7\n\n    Hyperminor scale\n    C locrian\n    C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb\n    1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7\n\n\nAll of these have a different sound! Try recording yourself playing a min(7) or maj(7) or dominant (3 &amp; b7) chord and jam over it with any mode, try to get the sound in your ear.\n\nIn your blues context: mix and match. Try playing C dorian over the I and F dorian over the IV chord, pop a Bdim arpeggio over the G7alt and play straight minor over the IV. You need to treat the Dm7b5 as D locrian, so try finding some cool out there licks. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421177629", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "You'll appreciate this story then. In highschool I played bass clarinet in the school's symphony. We were short one percussionist for Jubilee (Ron Nelson) so the teacher says \"anyone want to play timpani?\" no one raised their hand. I didn't have a part for that piece so I said \"sure, I'll try it\". She hand me the part and send me to the band hall where the percussion teacher gave me a 15 min crash course in timpani. I spent the next month teaching myself how to operate the pedals, how to set the dials, and even wrote a graph of what notes to have the timpani set at an any given measure. I was in it to win it. So we work hard and I'm really happy with how I'm hanging in there and fairly confident that I can make it passable. I've practiced my pedal switches, got my roll smooth enough that it didn't sound like a bag of pennies being dropped on a table (soft mallets helped) and could do a little basic tuning by ear. Then UIL comes up. When we finished the preceding piece I had to get up and walk straight through the ensemble, that got a chuckle from the audience. The percussionists set my initial tuning and we were off. I did well enough, occasional minor mistakes, but well enough. At lest until the end. We get to the last 32 measures and I was thrown off by a few measures. The piece is suposed to end in the classic tonic dominant repeat pattern (C G C G C G C G C G) But I started 8 measures too early. So fir 16 measures I played that measure on repeat until the director looked up and cued my final few notes (Same thing, but slower) and it was finally over. I thought I cost us our good score, but it turns out that we not only got top marks, but the judges made a comment about how much they liked my playing.

{"body": "In Ancient cultures, \"seeking\" God meant tapping into Consciousness.  You cannot connect to any 'higher' power until you've mastered that art.  Once you do you'll never ask 'why God' again.\n\nI became very ill a few years back.  I'd contracted Cancer for the 3rd time while my 17 y/o son was critically ill in the hospital.  I simply did not have time to get sick, or time for 'care' or surgeries.  I looked up 'curing cancer naturally' treatments and did them all.  Including Pineal Gland activators.  Being a paranoid Cancer victim and not thinking this enough, I tried Ayahuasca.  A near death experience transformed my life.\n\nWhen I was on the 'other side,' I spoke with God.  Yes, God was a great white light that felt incredibly Loving.  But that wasn't enough.  Being ornery and very connected to my scientific humanness I boldly asked God \"what are you?\" But I didn't hear a voice, it was more like thought-energy-speech. And God said stereotypically in a similar but booming voice...\"I am.\"  That simply wasn't good enough so I asked again \"but what ARE you?\"  And God said \"I am LOVE....WE ARE ONE.\"\n\nHOLY C R A P ! ! !  It took a second to really connect the magnitude of what was said.  Even then I still could not believe it, and God knew it so he said....\"if you doubt, go to your blanket and replace the word 'Love' with the word 'God' and you will know that 'I am.'\"\n\nSo when I woke that's exactly what I did.  And when I re-read the blanket I almost died because it now said:\n\n\"God is patient\nGod is kind\nGod does not envy\nGod does not boast\nGod is not proud\nGod does not dishonor others\nGod is not self-seeking\nGod is not easily angered\nGod keeps no record of wrongs\nGod does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth\nGod always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\"\n\nI remember thinking \"NOW I GET IT!\"  And I never \"wondered\" about God again.  I received a great deal from that encounter.  Like that our higher power doesn't cause bad weather, tyranny or murder.  God has nothing to do with it.  Our universe is 'programmed' by our COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS and how WE think as ONE!!!  All of humanity is functioning like a giant transmitter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHard to believe?  It didn't really take any difficult math to figure this out to be 100% true.  Think about this...\n\n---&gt;HAARP can blast our Ionosphere with 1 BILLION WATTS of power creating ultra high/low Energy fields that can move hurricanes and cause earthquakes.\n\n---&gt;According to the Basal Metabolic Rate (which is totally low-balling human Consciousness), the Human Brain has at least 150 watts of power when actively thinking.  \n\n---&gt;That means 10,000,000 human minds would = 1 HAARP\n\nSo how many HAARPS does 7,000,000,000 people make?  Pretty overwhelming thought, isn't it?\n\nNow think...what if all those humans were to focus on the same (blessing) thought at the same time?  Feelings, thoughts and intention have 'frequencies.'  What do you focus yours on?  \n\nDon't forget, whether atheist, agnostic or spiritual WE ARE ALL TRANSMITTERS &amp; RECEIVERS.  And in 1927, the greatest minds of physics collected together in Brussels to discuss Consciousness and it's power.

I realize you were just pulling random shit out of your head there, but E# is F. There is no \"key of E#\". But a G major progression would use the notes of the G major scale in its diatonic chords, so \n\n    G A B C D E F# G\n\nF ionian would use the notes of the F major scale\n\n    F G A Bb C D E F\n\nSo what are the differences? Well, first off F is not in G major—F# is. And second, the Bb from the F scale would make the G sound minor, because Bb is a minor third from G.\n\nSo no. That doesn't work really.\n\nSecond random example—G mixolydian over G major. That could work for the most part. The difference between G major and G mixolydian will be the F# in G major vs an F natural in G mixolydian. For some things, it might work. (A G7 chord, for instance.) But if you've got a D major chord, you're going to run into that problem of it sounding minor if you play the F natural, because the third of D major is F#.\n\nThird example, A Phrygian. the scale is\n\n    A Bb C D E F G A\n\nAgain, you're going to run into problems of Bb against B or F against F#.

{"body": "Good advice! This is a great exercise. I have a couple variations that I can also suggest.\n\nOne to is take /u/jazzman317's suggestion and do it with scale sequences. \n\nAnother is to emphasize common tones between two keys centers. Do this by repeating a common tone if you land on it at the key change. For example, if you're practicing the first measure of Giant Steps going from the key center of B to G, then you have\n\n**B C# D# E F# G# A#** as our pitch set in the key center of B\n\nand\n\n**G A B C D E F#** in the key of G\n\nYou have three common tones, B E and F#\n\nSo if you're practicing the scale exercise that /u/jazzman317 suggests, you could go:\n\n(Key of B) |(Key of G)|\n\n|B C# D **E** | **E** F# G A |\n\nBy repeating the E you hammer the point into your brain that E is a good note in both the key center of B and G, and you can use that to build melodic motifs. \n\nSpeaking of Giant Steps, you can hear Coltrane for example using common tones to build motifs in his solo over the chord changes. An example is in his first chorus around the 0:30 mark (what would be the 5th measure of the chorus) he plays an idea of ascending arpeggios, and uses the common tone D to make a smooth shift from a G major arpeggio to a Bb9 idea.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421216073", "subreddit": "Woodshed", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm going to attempt to make this the least convoluted as possible. There are exceptions to the rule and many additions that can be made to my post. Hopefully, this is enough to you get started. \n\nLearn C Major: C D E F G A B. The first note always counts as \"one\" in the scale. Therefore, E will be the third; G is the fifth and B is the seventh and so on. Learn the locations of each note starting with C at the third fret of the fifth string. You can cheat by looking up a note neck diagram on Google.\n\nMake a power chord shape on each of these notes. If you play C on the third fret of the fifth string, then you play G on the fifth fret of the fourth string. C is the root. G is its perfect 5th. In other words that G is five notes higher than C. \n\nIf you add C major's third note E into the mix (C, E, G) then you've successfully created a C major chord. If you add the B (the seventh note of the scale), then you have a Cmaj7. It should be noted that it's not always physically possible to play the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th notes of C major together on a guitar due to it being physically impossible without having three hands. Sometimes you just have to omit a note.\n\nRemember how each note has a number regarding its place? Well chord progressions are expressed with those numbers in Roman numerals. If you hear someone or read something that says it uses a I, IV, V chord progression in C major, then it means that you play C (the first note or I), F (the fourth note or IV) and G (the fifth note or V). Make power chords out of these notes and play I, IV, and V. It's really popular in punk and rock. \n\nNow try I, V, IV, VI or 1, 5, 4, 6. So play C, G, F, and A. Boom new chord progression achieved. This can be heard in the [Axis of Awesome \"4 Chords\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ) although they are in the key of E rather than C. \n\nLook up pop chord progression on google and you'll be surprised how many songs use the same chord progressions, but are simply played in different keys.\n\nAs far as soloing or creating melodies you just need to stick with your 8 notes of the C major scale to make it sound \"right.\" You can skip notes, play them in succession or mix them up. You can even add notes that aren't even in the scale to add flavor or a dash of the unexpected.\n\nFun facts:\n- if you flat the third note of any major scale (one fret lower in pitch), then you are playing that the minor version of the scale.\n\nExample: C major is C, D, E, F, G, A, B. C minor is C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B.\n\n- Minor chords use the flatted third instead of the major scale's third. \n\nExample: C major is C, E, F. C minor is C, Eb, F. The third note distinguishes major from minor.\n\n- Chord progressions that do not include the third note of the scale don't really have a major or minor sound to them until a melody is applied to them. \n\nExample: If you are playing over a I, IV, V chord progression, then you can play and/or sing the notes of C major over the progression to have the song sound major. Alternatively, if you play and/or sing C minor over the progression, then the overall song will sound as though it is minor.\n\n \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421225100", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; I believe similar analysis will still work against this implementation. Can you extrapolate why this isn't the case?\n\nFor text that you know has a lot of e's or spaces, and probably at least one ' the ' or 'The ', or more useful, know some fixed part of the plaintext then you can attack the RNG to guess its output rather than the seed.\n\nIn the case of AES feedforward mode, as a black box, you can modify the decryption of the next block by choosing specific \"garbage\" in the previous block.\n\nWith a transposition stage, there are no useful known plaintext portions or patterns,  assuming that the total frequency of spaces or 'e's provides no useful information.\n\n&gt;  xor and aes don't react well to multiple applications of the encryption to sub encryptions.\n\nfor double xor (and I think aes as well)  B x T x A is equivalent to T x (A x B), where A and B are the pads used to xor.  If A and B are the same then you have actually decrypted plaintext by double xoring, you are xoring with 0.  With xor this is easily avoided by just having the seed initialize the RNG, and then getting A and B to be byte streams from that RNG, but doing this, even if you XOR 10000 times, it is still equivalent to XORing with a single random stream of bytes.  Just as SHA isn't designed to recursively be applied 1M times, the RNG might not be either, and 1M rng values can only help an attack as compared to 100 rng values.\n\nAES (unmodified) as I understand it cannot be double applied (seed decrypts the 2nd time), and 3 applications is same as 1.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421258733", "subreddit": "crypto", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

A little bit after that I got an email from Alex Garfield in December 2014. The email was about forming a team, he gave me two options: A) NA Version: Fear + Universe (but if I didn't want I could say no) B) EU Version: He was in talks with Kuroky who showed interest in playing with RTZ (Maybe also Pie). I was thinking of doing it but Pie did not want to leave his team. So after that I decided to go with EG NA. Needed two other players especially a captain and PPD looked good. Was some discussion to get Demon over Universe. \n\n- S A D B O Y S FORMED:\n\n-Formed 3 weeks after S A D B O Y S formed. At the second LAN, Fear started to experience the first injuries to his arm. EG thought whoever won this tournament was going to get an invite to TI wanted to win badly. RTZ underestimated Ember in this tournament and did not realize it was broken yet. Cloud 9 beat EG in the winner bracket, then EG talked about how Ember was so broken and worked well with C9's style. EG played C9 in the finals and thought C9 was shaky without Ember. Still lost but RTZ think's it's because of nerves, bad play and that he choked. Thinks at the end of the tournament EE was pissed and sad that he lost.

If you were SURE that after a long run of reds, that it becomes more likely to flip to black then you should be willing to bet more money because the expectation of a payout would increase.\n\nNow say your bets were $10 per spin on red/black... after 15 reds what would you increase your bet to on red... $20? $50? $1000000 because it's a \"sure thing now\"?\n\nOf course not! The odds are still the same as any previous spin that the next spin will be red or black.\n\nAnother way to un-psych yourself out from this might go like this: suppose you weren't there to watch the 15 red outcomes before your bet. But your friend was there and said it just came up 15 red... would you drop more than the $10 you were planning on? Would you rush to the ATM to pull money out of the bank becuase the bet is totally broken in your favor?\n\nAnd how does your trust in your friend affect that decision? What if he got sleepy the second to last spin and missed that it turned out black that one time, but there were 13 reds before and 1 red after -- effectively 'breaking' the run? Does that ruin the odds or is black 'still due' becuase red was pretty common recently...\n\nThere just isn't a way to game the system with a game like roulette without being some kind of physics magician from MIT.\n\nOne final bump though because you aren't TOTALLY crazy -- a long string of reds *is* unlikely. The odds of seven reds in a row happening is under 1%\n\n  odds R R R R R R R &lt; 1%\n\nBut this doesn't have an effect on the next roll being red or black because 8 reds has the same likelihood as 7 reds and one black\n\n  odds R R R R R R R R = odds R R R R R R R B\n\nwhich is why, although the *event that happened* was unlikely it doesn't tell you anything about the *event that WILL happen*.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421300664", "subreddit": "math", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Hang on though: we agree that truly random play loses the least. And you're asserting that any strategy you attempt other than truly random play can be exploited. Then why would you (rationally) change strategies?\n\nI wouldn't! Unless I could be sure that you were not a very good RPS player, and were using a strategy that would not change based on my altered play.\n\nIf I *knew* you wouldn't subsequently change your strategy (which I hope you would), I'd definitely change to the one that beats yours.\n\nBut since I can't know that, and since it's *extremely unlikely* you wouldn't change yours, I would likely just stick to random and draw you.\n\nNow we're assuming you were smart enough to develop your strategy and that means you would be smart enough to not continue playing Scissors, if I just threw the following:\n\nS R R R R R R R R R R R R ...\n\nAfter all, Paper would be my least played, so your strategy would say to keep playing Scissors over and over and over again, even though I just kept throwing Rock.\n\nFaced with my counter-strategy above (which would absolutely creamate your strategy), I *assume* you'd change your strategy.\n\nEventually any strategy based on a predictable pattern of play can be spotted by both players. And thus both players can be equally expected to develop the strategy and counter-strategies.\n\nThus, random is the least losing strategy against *any possible* other strategy.\n\n&gt; You would only do so if you detected the other player was biased in some predictable way, and thus thought you could exploit that bias to win more often. Yes? Otherwise you would continue to play randomly.\n\nYou're assuming that you can predict my pattern, but I can't predict my own and I can't predict yours. Okay, that may be an interesting thought experiment, but it's not a \"game\" of RPS.\n\nAbsolutely, if you know what the other person is about to play, play the counter. Otherwise fully random is *always* your best bet.\n\nBut the game of RPS assumes you don't actually *know* what the other person (if they're Fully Rational, or even just at least as smart as you) is going to play, or is even likely to play.\n\n&gt; My point is: as a human, your \"random\" choices will almost certainly be biased in an exploitable way.\n\nHow?\n\nIf you can spot my bias, and develop a strategy to exploit it, it is equally easy for me to spot my bias, assume your strategy and develop a counter-strategy for it.

Couple months after that I got a message from Alex Garfield because I believe EG was switching it up and changing rosters or whatever. He messaged me in 2014, roughly a year ago, to form a team.\n&gt;- Two options from Alex Garfield: NA team with Fear and Universe on team and last two up to fear universe rtz, EU team with Kuroky, Puppey, PLD, RTZ + 1, to form EU alliance. \n&gt;- PLD didnt want to leave current team, so no EU team. EG.NA is formed with Fear, Universe, RTZ for sure. RTZ wanted to play with Zai. The only suitable captain in NEL was PPD, however there was some discussion of Demon v. Universe. Universe was a better fit because more mellow and not as clowny as Demon. RTZ would have liked to play with Demon, but Universe would have been better over Demon. S A D B O Y S forms. Few weeks later, EG.NA is formed.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Texas Lan (RTZ's Second Lan)**\n&gt;\n&gt;- All NA teams playing in the tournament would for sure get an invite to TI4 so we all wanted to win the tournament really bad. But, there were way too many stand-ins such as MSS on Liquid.\n&gt;- Actual games were pretty shit, but this is when Ember Spirit released, Ember Spirit was picked by C9 and shown true power by EE. RTZ thought Ember was shitty, but then he realized he was stupid as fuck for not realizing how broken ember was.\n&gt;- After dropping to lower bracket, they were able to get out and beat C9 in grand finals when they banned ember.\n&gt;- RTZ was nervous at grand finals and weaver was his choking moment.\n&gt;- Pocket strategy with Lycan, Sand King, and CM that turned out to workout really well. EE was really upset and \"on the verge of tears.\" But really he was disappointed with his own play.\n&gt;- Post-Texas, Fear mentioned his hand hurting really bad during the tournament but pushed through it. This was the beginning of the pain for fear until practicing for StarLadder\n&gt;\n&gt;**Pre-Starladder**\n&gt;\n&gt;- Bootcamped in SF, playing in a scrim and Fear decided to stop the scrim because of his injury\n&gt;- Huge realization that EG needed a stand-in. At the time Mason was considered their stand-in.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Starladder 9**\n&gt;\n&gt;- Due to Mason's exams, for Starladder, EE was picked up as a stand-in. After MLG, RTZ wanted to get into C9 but didn't want to pressure EE because he understood that EE and C9 may not want a HS kid. No problems over it and not upset.\n&gt;- Completely crushed some of the teams during scrims, but in the first day of groups they beat Na`Vi, but lost against another team but went to the winner bracket anyway. Also played against IG in groups and played Ferrari430 for the first time. RTZ was playing Dragon Knight against Ferrari's Naga. RTZ was on point with everything and outplaying him in mid.\n&gt;- RTZ said that he played terribly, especially his ember. But EE was completely carrying them in that game with his Luna. 100% Envy won the game for them even 1v5ing enemy team.\n&gt;- After scrimming against DK and crushing them, they were confident. Alliance told them to ban Wisp, but we didn't understand that hero. DK was the best team in the world at the time. They picked Wisp, Morphling, and Lycan, whereas they picked ember spirit. But, they got stomped hard and RTZ doubted his skill and fit with ember spirit. In game 2, they got stomped again and his confidence was pretty bad. This set was the worst RTZ has felt about his team. He never felt this outplayed ever.\n&gt;- Vs. Empire, there was not much to say except Envy lost the third game for them. There wasn't any great play by either Empire and EG and both teams sucked ass, but EG sucked more.\n&gt;- DK then 3-0 Empire. \n&gt;- During Starladder, RTZ had bad jetlag and he had a bad stomachache and he had this liquid laxative and took four shots of laxatives and sat in the washroom for four hours the day of the tournament.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Post Starladder**\n&gt;\n&gt;- Using Mason and Fear half and half. Concerned with whether Fear could play at the International.\n&gt;- PPD, Zai, RTZ, and Universe were in a separate room and had to decide between Fear and Mason for the International. It was a tough decision and decided in the end on Mason because Fear couldn't sustain the practice that RTZ wanted to do so they just picked Mason. RTZ was sad about this, but they had to return to practice.\n&gt;- The bootcamp was really helpful and helped EG figure out where they lost.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Summit 1**\n&gt;\n&gt;- EG arrives one day earlier and played against DK for a couple games and they lost every scrim against them. But they were still in high spirits.\n&gt;- Not concerned about Vici, but were concerned about Na`Vi and DK. Na`VI is an interesting team for EG because they are a good Bo1 team and the groupstage in Summit 1 was based on Bo1. Na`Vi won a group stage game with Tinker and suddenly Tinker was starting to become first pick material.\n&gt;- During group stage. Lost against Na`Vi, DK, and other team RTZ could not remember. But they weren't feeling bad because they were going to be playing Fnatic in the lower bracket first round. EG was confident because of the skill gap and they did beat them.\n&gt;- They still had to play Na`Vi again. RTZ was scared of Na`Vi because they are different than online Na`Vi. But EG managed to beat them in pretty one-sided game. RTZ thinks they might have been abusing Roshan alot more beginning D I R E B O Y S. \n&gt;- Loser bracket finals against Vici were really great games. Vici didn't figure out their style quite yet. In the final game between them, EG was able to get tinker as a last pick though throughout tournament tinker was considered first pick material. RTZ says that Tinker can just get you a win in the game and can snowball you into a victory by himself.\n&gt;- Grand finals against DK was very hyped. RTZ smiled after winning against them because of the great respect between the teams. \n&gt;- For game 1, they got smashed with a push strat they had mapped out, but never practiced. DK picked panda, ember, and doom. EG picked Furion, abbadon, dragon knight, and two other push heroes with a 25 minute timing attack. They could have killed ???, which would have secured an EG victory, but instead that hero survived with 100 hp and EG's heroes died defining the exact moment they lost that game. This was the first time RTZ and PPD were constructively beefing.\n&gt;- For game 2, RTZ was losing the game for the team, but his team ended up carrying them especially Mason's mirana.\n&gt;- For games 3, 4, 5 (I wasn't listening since my cat fucked up some shit)\n&gt;- PPD was really organized for the bootcamp and RTZ was super proud to be part of team EG. \n&gt;\n&gt;**D2L**\n&gt;\n&gt;- EG 3-0ed Na`Vi by outfarming them and everything which was a huge boost for them.\n&gt;\n&gt;**TI4**\n&gt;\n&gt;- Figured out that Razor was OP\n&gt;- Tried to play DP against Fnatic in a scrim, but RTZ went 0-15 and scrapped that hero from his hero pool. Perhaps, ultimately the reason they lost TI. \n&gt;- Probably the worst feeling ever. Played his worst against Newbee game 1 and questioned his own ability to play for the months afterwards.\n&gt;\n&gt;**ESL (He took a detour from TI4 to talk about ESL a little bit)**\n&gt;\n&gt;- EG was scheduled to play against Na`Vi best out of 3, but ESL says you have to play the tournament in one day. EG 2-0ed Na`Vi, but were playing more games than anyone else in one day. EG plays against Fnatic and on game 3 the power went out and then RTZ threw that game. EG then plays against IG and outplayed their push strat and then the next two games EG fed both games. Both games were completely clowny.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Post-TI Shakeup**\n&gt;\n&gt;- Going through a rough patch at the time. RTZ was depressed about hsi abilities.\n&gt;- Fear assured them that his arm had healed.\n&gt;- RTZ asked EE whether he would join EG if they had a spot. EE said no, and RTZ \"called him an idiot\" for not joining EG.\n&gt;- EG asked iceiceice, Notail, but ended up with Fear.\n&gt;\n&gt;**WEC**\n&gt;\n&gt;- Played the best they ever played as a team and won the tournament \n&gt;- RTZ smiled once again even though the Chinese teams were probably on break\n&gt;\n&gt;**Post WEC**\n&gt;\n&gt;- New patch promotes new style of play, different from TI4, no longer pushing, no longer doing other stuff, do not want to play together as a team, encourages you to split push\n&gt;- Previous patch = end the game in 15 minutes this patch = end the game in 40 minutes\n&gt;- RTZ believed the best way to play was to play with illusion heroes and buffing heroes like empower etc.\n&gt;- Zai and Fear had some opinions only on their own hero roles, but not the overall big picture\n&gt;- PPD still thought pushing strats were still better, there was some stupid arguments between them because of this difference of opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Starladder 10**\n&gt;\n&gt;- EG didn't practice at all. No idea how to pick at all. There was no reason they should have won, but their overall strategy was to get lycan and crush them.\n&gt;- Secret was cheering hard when they beat EG in a winner's bracket match, which caused EG to get really mad. So EG really wanted to beat Secret. They theory crafted to beat ET-Tide pick openings. After studying they beat them in the finals. Figured out and countered them, but almost lost the last game because of throws, but they won because of Nyx.\n&gt;- Winning the tournament was his second favorite because beating them after winning a winner's bracket match against EG.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dreamleague**\n&gt;\n&gt;- Problems and slumps beginning to arise. But, they beat C9 because C9 was playing poorly.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Summit 2**\n&gt;\n&gt;- After losing at Summit 2, all the small arguments emptied out into one tournament. They would have disbanded and would have had some huge issues if they didn't disband.\n&gt;- As soon as they lost to Cloud 9 they were defeated mentally, not even the third place mattered.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421327018", "subreddit": "longtail", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

So when you're reading lisp code, you might run into:\n\n    (+ 1 2 3 4)\n\n\nor\n\n    (+ 1 2)\n\nwhich many people argue is a strength, because now you have this function that easily expands and takes more things but you'd totally be missing the complaint. \nconceivably, there could be a function like this:\n\n    (plusmultiply a n m)\n\nthat results in a * (n + m) or maybe (a + n) * m. I can do whatever I want and now you have to learn every single bit about my function just to understand the basic layout of my code.\nThe complaint is that code isn't a 1 or a 2, especially not in lisp. Each element is it's own s-expr, so how do you split lines? When do you put something on the same line and when do you wrap it? There's no consistency. s-exprs wreak havoc on eye-lines in code.\n\nHere's an example straight from the clojure [docs](http://clojure.org/concurrent_programming):\n\n\n\n    (defn test-stm [nitems nthreads niters]\n      (let [refs  (map ref (repeat nitems 0))\n            pool  (Executors/newFixedThreadPool nthreads)\n            tasks (map (fn [t]\n                          (fn []\n                            (dotimes [n niters]\n                              (dosync\n                                (doseq [r refs]\n                                  (alter r + 1 t))))))\n                       (range nthreads))]\n        (doseq [future (.invokeAll pool tasks)]\n          (.get future))\n        (.shutdown pool)\n        (map deref refs)))\n\nWhere is the eye line? when are you stacking and when are you expanding? Nobody can make up their mind and nobody has ever been able to make up their mind since lisp was first created. It's a constant mix of\n\n    (function n n n n n)\n\nwhere all items are equal and\n\n    (function n m n m n m)\n\nwhere items are not equal and sometimes it gets worse. On top of all of these inconsistencies, you run into issues where people are making up fake syntax that they are used to from imperative languages that simply serve as a method to confuse newcomers because clojure syntax is constantly dependent on the author. Stuff like [case](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/case), [when](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/when) and [if](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/if) cause a tremendous amount of issues depending on how the author chooses to format their code. While I do code clojure, I can only ever read my own code if I keep my functions ultra simple and at root level. I would argue that's a good practice for just about any language, but I've found people commiting perlism atrocities who don't code that way, but instead code very deep to the right, even with short, sub 20-line functions.\n\nIt's not a readable language. Because it makes no claims about whitespace (like python) it allows the author of code to put you at their mercy. Because if makes no claims about DSL layout, it allows the author of the code to create whatever s-expr monstrosity they want and put you at their mercy. lisp is functional perl. Elixir has functional syntax right.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421371694", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Db, D#, Gb, Ab, and A# are totally valid note names. hell, even E#, Fb, B#, and Cb are valid names. The rule is to not use the same letter more than once in a key, and whichever accidental is used is used for all accidentals (\"flat keys\" and \"sharp keys\"). F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb and Cb (yes, Cb) are the flat keys in order from least to most flats. C G D A E B F# and C# are the sharp keys in order from least to most sharps. in the key of B, you don't refer to the 7 as Bb, but rather A# (one that you pointed out as not being referred to)\n\n7) probably a typo, but you put \"all 11 keys\" instead of \"all 12 keys\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421443850", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "ITT:\n\n&gt; Former Evil Geniuses player Artour “Arteezy” Babaev shocked commentators yesterday with a lengthy and insightful monologue about the still-unfolding drama and history between high-level Dota 2 teams Evil Geniuses, Cloud 9, and Team Secret.\n&gt; \n&gt; “The other day I was watching an episode of Grey’s Anatomy and it’s always relevant to my Dota career,” said Babaev, referring to the fictional American medical drama television series popular among women ages 18-25 that has nothing to do with Dota. “Basically, I’m happy I was at EG, but I’m moving on to a different hospital.”\n&gt; \n&gt; EG players went on to further compare the team-shuffle situation with their popular television series.\n&gt; \n&gt; “It’s like Friends but we were never really friends,” said Clinton “Fear” Loomis, referring to the NBC sitcom that aired many years before some of EG’s players were born. “Arteezy is Joey, the dumbest character that gets his own spin-off show that objectively will just be worse.”\n&gt; \n&gt; “It’s like Peter Pan but Peter kicks some of the L O S T B O Y S out for not working hard enough,” said Peter “PPD” Dager, EG’s captain and drafter. “They then join Captain Hook and the pirates and are unable to place as high as EG at The International 5.”\n&gt; \n&gt; “It’s like Breaking Bad where me and Artour are running from the law,” said Ludwig “zai” Wåhlberg, who also left EG for Team Secret. “I’m Heisenberg and he’s Jesse. Or maybe I’m Jesse. Or maybe we’re both the meth.”\n&gt; \n&gt; “It’s like The Little Mermaid when Ariel leaves her world, people, and culture and is muted and rendered subaltern in exchange for perceived greater social, romantic, and terrestrial mobility,” said Saahil “Universe” Arora. “The difference is, of course, that Ariel was eventually welcomed back at the film’s denouement.”\n&gt; \n&gt; “It’s like SpongeBob SquarePants when SpongeBob and Patrick attend a jousting tournament and travel back in time to the 11th century,” said Syed “Suma1L” Hassan. “I really liked that episode.”\n&gt; \n&gt; Other Dota 2 progamers also gave their opinions on the situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; “It’s like RahXephon where Arteezy and Zai carry the Mu phase genetic marker but EG don’t know it,” said Jacky “EternalEnVy” Mao, captain of Cloud 9. “Arteezy is able to transverse Jupiter barrier and controls his Dolem so well that he’s accepted by the Mulians even though he’s from the Bähbev Foundation.” \n\nmy sides.

So the ending was essentially, ruined for me.  \n\nSecondly I felt the third act went off the deep end. Thematically, It has almost nothing to do with the rest of the film. The audience discovers the earth's situation almost entirely though inference, tight scripting, and background.  Nothing direct, nothing in your face.  Just subtle hints.  For example, Coop with the school teacher.  Coop's relationship with Murph.  Same with the space missions -  You feel the drama grow with each step of the planning and the consequences each time they make a mistake.  No space battles, no \"crazy science machines\" .  That's why seeing their friend so aged is shocking... the story is told in hints, glances, and inference.\n\nOh wait, here's Matt Daemon, he goes ballistic, random fight scene on an ice cloud, fall into black hole, dont get spaggitified / tars / funny sidekick / comedic figure saves the day with bad jokes / aliens / humans / constructs from the future reach back and save everything / coop / Bruce Willis is a ghost / bookshelf elf / space ring / happy ending / what a cop out. \n\nSorry about that. tldr, I  L O V E D the first two hours, vomited in my brain the last. =\\ ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421461115", "subreddit": "interstellar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Okay since nobody else is criticizing this I will.\n\nScramble: R U' F U' F D' B L' D2 B U B' D2 R' U' L2 F L B D R D F L' D\n\nSolution:\n\nCross: y x' U2 R' U' x U L U' x2 \n\nPair 0: R U' R'\n\nPair 1: U L' U L U' L U L'\n\nPair 2: U2 L' U L U' R U R'\n\nPair 3: y U L U L'\n\nPair 4: U R U' R'\n\nOLL: R U R' U R U2 R'\n\nPLL: U' R' U R' U' R' U' R' U R U R2\n\nOkay first things first, yes this was a 9 second solve, but it was also had some easy pairs and one of the best possible LLs.\n\n**Cross**: Cross was solved on F and U, which is literally the worst thing you can do. During cross you need to be looking for your first pair, and this is nearly impossible when all the pieces are on the back of the cube. For proof of this, just look at the cube when he freezes the frame after completing the cross--all you can see is cross pieces and an empty slot. A better option would have been: x2 L2 F' L' u R u' Not only does this involve less regrips and rotations, it allows you to follow your pieces around and you can even just pop the premade pair in with an R U2 R' rather than trying to hide it.\n\n**Pair 0**: Never do moves just to hide a pair or just to move pieces around. There are three main alternatives to what he did if you don't want to deal with a rotation right now.\n\n*1: U2 r' U' R U M' pretty self explanatory. You should learn this insert if you don't already know it.\n\n*2: Actually look at your pieces. Hiding in the back left with U2 L U' L' completes the orange-green pair while hiding the premade blue-red. This would result in an F2L that goes:\n\nCross: y x' U2 R' U' x U L U' x2 \n\nPair 1: U2 L U' L' y' R U' R'\n\nPair 2: U2 R' U R U2 R' U R\n\nPair 3+4: y R U2 R2 F R U' F' *(This is one of the most common multislot cases, learn to understand and recognize it.)*\n\n*3: Hide the pair with a simple U L' This allows you to do the orange-blue pair with R U R' U' R U R' U' R U R' then do U L to unhide the premade pair and complete the red-green pair. If you choose this route the entire f2l would go like this:\n\nCross: y x' U2 R' U' x U L U' x2 \n\nHide: U L'\n\nPair 1: R U R' U' R U R' U' R U R'\n\nPair 2: U L U2 L U' L'\n\nPair 3: r' U' R U M' *(This is that same alg from option 1. Not only does it save a rotation now, but it flips the orange-green edge so now don't have to rotate for that pair either. Yes, some people can actually see this as it happens.)*\n\nPair 4: L' U L U' L' U' L\n\nNotice how there are no rotations after the cross? Triple sexy on pair 1 bumps the move count up quite a bit but other than that its a decent F2L.\n\n**Pairs 1, 2, 3**: Nothing much to complain about with these, he handled them the way I or most other people would have.\n\n**Pair 4**: This is quite possibly the easiest VH case to recognize of all time. Instead of U R U' R' he should have done U2 R U2 R' to skip OLL and save 7 moves. Even if an easy skip like this isn't possible, you should always know what your edge orientation will be for OLL before 4th pair is inserted, and you should have at least a vague idea of corner orientation. This will make predicting/recognizing/influencing OLL much easier.\n\n**OLL**: I just said that there shouldn't even have been an OLL for this solve but I'll go over some general things to look for with OLL. As I've said, you should already know edge orientation going in to OLL. I'm not sure what he's implying when he shows an image of all the OCLL cases before stopping at sune; sune recognition should be *instant*. Once you're good at it, you can also recognize corner permutation near-instantly as well. Even if you don't know OLLCP, you can learn how the algs you know affect corner permutation so you can predict if you will have an EPLL, adj-swap, or diag-swap for your PLL. This makes 2-side PLL recognition much easier.\n\nThis particular solve had another interesting case. Even if you decided to insert with U R U' R' and get Sune OLL, you get one of the easiest ZB cases. Instead of doing R U R' U R U2 R', he could have done U' R' U2 R U R' U R and skipped PLL.\n\nAlso the sune execution was gross.\n\n**PLL**: Again he does the thing with a bunch of random cases flashing across the screen. I don't know. But U-perm is one of the easiest to recognize. There are lots of guides on 2-face PLL recognition, its not that hard and definitely worth it. It's also worth knowing multiple algs for some cases so you don't have to AUF a bunch (I use four algs for the clockwise U-perm). If you're decently ambidextrous learning some of the left-handed PLLs isn't a bad idea.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421461754", "subreddit": "Cubers", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Here you can find a tutorial about the rule of the octave,\n\nhttp://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/aboutParti/ruleOfTheOctave.htm\n\nLinear is when the bass goes by steps like D E F# G, in this case you use the Rto. \n\nSequential is when you go by leaps, like B E A D G, here +4 -5.

{"body": "Cool, I found it on google maps. That station at WAHJAMEGA only shows height, but the  [one down by FRANKENMUTH does ](http://wdr.water.usgs.gov/wy2013/pdfs/04151500.2013.pdf). And evidently they have data back to 1908! Anyway, yearly mean there is 544 ft3/s. Lets calulate!\n\nWe have to assume that since you are upstream you get less thru your location. Even though I dont see any major tributaries, lets reduce by 75% to be conservative, so flow is Q = 400 cfs or 11.3 m3/s.  You said 8' of head, or h = 2.4m. THerefore Total power available is rho x g x h x Q. Rho (rho = density of water = 1000 kg/m3, g = acc. of gravity = 9.8 m/s2). So, if your friend could capture ALL the power dam going over that dam, he would have between 250 and 350kW, depending on what the true flow rate is. (About 200 homes worth, as a newspaper would report it). Not too shabby.\n\nBut I really don't know how much of the flow you could reasonably expect to capture without doing major reconstruction on the dam itself. Certainly you can get the few kW you need to cover your and your friends home consumption easily, from there the question is whether it is in his interest to try to put in a much larger system and sell the electricity. \n\nIt seems that the normal type of turbine to use for your situation is a Kaplan turbin (pretty much just a propellor). See [slide 6 on this presentation](http://www.british-hydro.org/uploads/11202007120238PM.pdf). If you google 50kW Kaplan Hydro, you'll get hits... even some stuff from aliababa, so you could buy some cheap turbines from china. \n\nI've also been checking out this company [Natel Energy](http://www.natelenergy.com/) out of california, who are trying to do low-head hydro Silicon Valley style, with a new patented and trademarked lower cost design (supposedly). If I put the characteristics of your dam into their calculator, they reckon you could produce up to 170 kW, or 900 MWh a year. Multiply that by what you think you could sell the electricity at to figure out yearly revenue. 40k$ if we assume 5c/kWh.\n\nYou can check out the experiences of http://www.millatfreedomfalls.com/ who are refurbishing a 19th century mill dam, that is similar (but smaller) than yours and putting in a 40kW Natel system. They document the regulatory hurldles and have a bunch of plans up.\n\nRegarding costs, the Natel thread, lead me to [this testomony](http://www.hydro.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/SchneiderTestimony07.29.10.pdf) by Natel to the House of Representatives, and that mentions Kaplan turbine costs on the order of 2800 $/kW, and says their system is 50% cheaper, so maybe that 170kW system they calculated for you costs 240k$ (just the equipment? installed?). They also calculate that their LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) is 5 to 7 cents, so that gives you roughly the price you would have to be able to sell your electricity at to not lose money.\n\nConclusion:  if you want to pursue anything other than offsetting the electrical use of two houses, the first step is to get DTE to tell you what kind of rates they would pay you for a 50 to 150 kW plant. Evidently [michigan is low on power](http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20141130/NEWS/311309995/utilities-report-warns-of-energy-shortage-consumers-dte-urge), so maybe they'll be interested. Those Natel guys might give you the time of day, too, if you contact them acting serious about refurbishing low-head dam. At this point in the startup lifecyle its more important to HAVE customers than to actually make any money off them.\n\nEdit: Ok, I'm probably starting to seem like a stawker, but Lidar data is available for your location from The National Map. [Here is your dam, in 3D](http://imgur.com/55urs92). Freaky, right? The lidar elevation for the upper pool is 199.4m, and 194.9 for the lower pool. Thats 5.5m of head. (Basically you're original number, which I doubted.)  So you've got like 500kW+ of potential there.

What the pattern you've been practicing has been really teaching you is t i m t i m t i, or m or rest it doesn't matter. It's trying to teach you not to fall into bunches of 3 which is easy, as it's 3 finger style, but instead into patters of 8 which make up 2 beats, so you'll come out in time with 99% of vocal tunes &amp; most instrumental melodies when you play along. A forward roll, just means your fingers are making forward movement, it doesn't matter the strings, could be 53142121, or 32152132, both are forward rolls, the roll is the finger pattern not the strings. \nHonestly, i wouldn't really focus on learning rolls so much, I mean know them, but really it's much more useful learning the rolls as a by product of learning breaks, so you think in terms of applied melody, because that's the goal of scruggs style banjo, melody.

I definitely learned a lot! I'm still pretty new to Haskell so style pointers would be very much appreciated (if anyone reads this).\n\nedit: A couple notes on the implementation: \n\n    This uses Djikstra's algorithm, and is set up to handle changes in traffic conditions (so \n    for example if some path brings it over the 1900 mark it can handle the shift from T3\n    to T4). This is done by saying the next node in Djikstra's algorithm is the one with the \n    earliest arrival time, and each arrival time is calculated step by step taking the current \n    time into account. Times are internally stored as minutes-since-midnight. \n    Each street is considered two one-way streets, so the program would be trivially \n    modifiable to handle one-way streets. \n\nThe program takes 3 command line arguments: the first is the start location, the second is the end location, and the third is the time at which to start (so for example if you compiled the program to shortest_path, you would use it like ./shortest_path A M 0800). It also requires a \"data.txt\" file, which is just the street info from the OP copy pasted into a text file.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421571037", "subreddit": "dailyprogrammer", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Modes can be tricky at first, but once you understand just exactly what they are, and the actual *theory* behind them, they are quite simple to understand. Here is a quick breakdown of them all.\n\nIonian - Major\n\nDorian - Minor b6\n\nPhrygian - Minor b2\n\nLydian - Major #4\n\nMixolydian - Major b7\n\nAeolian - Minor\n\nLocrian - Minor b2 b5\n\n[I] [D]on't [P]lay [L]ike [M]ike [A]nd [L]arry\n\nLet's say you are in the key of C. \n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nThat's the C major scale. Now, if we want to play the Dorian scale relative to C major, all we do is play the notes that are in C major, but *start* on the D note instead of the C note.\n\nD E F G A B C D\n\nThat right there is the D Dorian scale. Notice there are no flats in this minor scale. That's because there are no flats in C major. All we are doing is borrowing the notes of C major, and playing them from a different starting position.\n\nAs for actually memorizing the content of each scale, I like to look at it from a Major/Minor sort of way. There are 3 major modes (Ionian Lydian Mixolydian), and 4 minor modes (Dorian Phrygian Aeolian Locrian). \n\nIonian (Major) is easy because it is just your typical Major scale. 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 or if we are in the key of C, C D E F G A B. An example of this would be Mozart's Flute and Harp piece in C Major.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/RZvJNY8uVLU\n\nDorian (Minor) is a minor scale, with the 6th note of the scale flattened. D E F G A B C. This scale creates a very unique tone when playing a i - IV chord progression. An example of Dorian is the classic Celtic piece, Scarborough Fair.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/wiZJP_XLmrQ\n\nPhyrgian (Minor) is also a minor scale, however with the 2nd note of the scale flattened. E F G A B C D. When played cleanly, a i - II - VI chord progress sounds absolutely lovely in 3/4 time. An example of Phyrgian is Franz Listz's Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/7H99FM6S8rU\n\nLydian (Major) is a major scale with a sharpened 4th. F G A B C D E. The sharp fourth is known to give the Lydian a kind of unsettling tone: happy, nonsensical, clownish, but can also be quite serious. An example of Lydian is The Simpsons theme music. \n\nhttp://youtu.be/-cOdYyx1oKI\n\nMixolydian (Major) is a major scale with a flattened 7th note. G A B C D E F. This scale can give music an empowering sound because of the Major VII Chord leading to the Major 1 Chord. An example of Mixolydian is the Star Trek TV theme music.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/hdjL8WXjlGI\n\nAeolian (Minor) is your typical minor scale. A B C D E F G. An example of Aeolian is Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/4Tr0otuiQuU\n\nLocrian (Minor) is a minor scale with the 2nd and 5th note flattened. B C D E F G A. This scale is rarely used in classical music because of it's dissonance. It is a scale that is based off the 7th note in a major scale, which gives it a very diminished sounding quality which is not pleasant to the ear. An example of Locrian is Rachmaninoff's prelude in B minor.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/XU8VgS-2hpk\n\nSorry for the wall of text! And sorry for the late response.

{"body": "&gt; You said, and I quote, \"Yes you fucking did.\"\n\nThat's not what I said. This is what I said: \n\n&gt; Yes you fucking did. You've been vehemently protecting this guy from the possibility of living with the consequences of his actions all over this thread.\n&gt;\n&gt;Guess what the consequences of breaking the rules of the TOS are? YOU GET BANNED, be it permanently or temporarily. Full fucking stop.\n\nNotice how I stipulate an EXACT consequence. I'll repeat that, so it gets through to you. Notice how I stipulate the exact, factual consequence of his actions. His actions being the breaking of the TOS. You were protecting him from those, by saying that he should be \"muted and given a warning\", which aren't ACTUAL FUCKING CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS.\n\n&gt; I have a comment on this thread saying he should be temporarily banned with a warning, and if he continues his behavior THEN a ban could be fitting.\n\nHey look, you're still a liar! You know people can READ your post history, right? These are the things you said regarding \"consequences\": \n\n&gt;  You don't even think he should be temporarily muted with a warning first?\n&gt; \n&gt; You don't just permanently ban a guy who says that one day over an adult rated video game without a temporary mute/warning. That's just stupid and you're way too sensitive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks. I think a temporary mute with a message why would be adequate here. Then if he persists a ban may be reasonable.\n\nNotice how you never said that he should be banned, be it temporarily or permanently; but rather that he should be muted, and that he should get a warning.\n\nHe was shouting at kids to kill themselves. Chances are good that this wasn't his first time. You don't go from the nicest guy in the world to, all of the sudden, harassing people over VOIP. That doesn't actually happen in the real world. Plus, this shit doesn't matter anyway. The terms of service are very fucking clear. There is no argument here as to what should happen. If you harass people over voice chat,  and get reported, YOU GET BANNED, be it temporarily or permanently.\n\n&gt; This means I proved you wrong. Get over yourself and admit you were wrong. You're embarrassing yourself and it's super amusing lol\n\nI can see how delusion would come natural to you.\n\n&gt; Oh and the Christian thing to do would be to forgive this man for his transgressions so...w r o n g a g a i n...but let's not get into religion here.\n\nHaha, what. You realize, surely, that \"forgiving this man for his transgressions\" doesn't actually meant that he should go unpunished, right? Also, I would think a Christians, first and foremost, would have to be compassionate. Given your thoughts regarding how people like the OP is talking about should be handled, and regarding how \"being sensitive\" is a bad thing according to you, I don't doubt for a second that you're not actually a very compassionate person.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421614080", "subreddit": "PS4", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\nLevel Effect \n1 Disadvantage on ability checks \n2 Speed halved \n3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws \n4 Hit point maximum halved \n5 Speed reduced to 0 \n6 Death\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\"\n\nI'd argue sleep deprivation is probably hard-capped. Like, at 48 hours gain one level. Then at 72 take another level but no more levels after that. You can't die from not sleeping after all, but if you combo it with other kinds of exhaustion it can certainly break the camel's back.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421626478", "subreddit": "DnD", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

She also goes out naked after her showers and passes in front of me like nothing(note:our hallways are pretty narrow so our bodies get pretty close everytime we pass each other). I have seen her naked more than i should at this age...almost everyday and its driving me nuts! and sometimes she ask for back massages when she is a little tipsy...\n\nIs it my imagination going up to the moon or a normal mother/son relationship?\n\nshould I accept to massage her?

[**Synchronic lenition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition#Synchronic_lenition) of article  [**Lenition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Like other [Western Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Romance_languages), many varieties of [Sardinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language) offer an example of [sandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhi) where the rule of intervocalic lenition extends across word boundaries. Since it is a fully active synchronic rule, lenition is not normally indicated in the normal orthography. \n\n&gt;A [series of synchronic lenitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscan_gorgia) involving opening, or loss of occlusion, rather than voicing is found for post-vocalic /p t k/ in much of [Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany), in Central Italy. Stereotypical [Florentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence), for example, has the /k/ of /kasa/ as [ˈkaːsa] *casa* 'house' in a post-pause realization, [iŋˈkaːsa] *in casa* 'in (the) house' post-consonant, but [laˈhaːsa] *la casa* 'the house' intervocalically. Word-internally, the normal realization is also [h]: /ˈbuko/ *buco* 'hole' → [ˈbuːho].\n\n&gt;In the [Celtic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages), the phenomenon of intervocalic lenition historically extended across word boundaries. This explains the rise of [grammaticalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticalisation) initial [consonant mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_mutation) in modern Celtic languages through the loss of endings. A [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic) example would be the lack of lenition in *am fear* /əm fɛr/ (\"the man\") and lenition in *a’ bhean* /ə vɛn/ (\"the woman\"). The following examples show the development of a phrase consisting of a definite article plus a masculine noun (taking the ending -*os*) compared with a feminine noun taking the ending -*a*. The historic development of lenition in these two cases can be reconstructed as follows:\n\n&gt;&gt;[Proto-Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Celtic) **(s)indo__s w__iros* IPA: [wiɾos] → Old Irish *ind fer* [feɾ] → Middle Irish *in fer* [feɾ] → [Classical Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Gaelic) *an fear* [feɾ] → Modern Gaelic *am fear* [fɛɾ]\n\n&gt;&gt;Proto-Celtic **(s)ind__ā be__nā* IPA: [venaː] → Old Irish *ind ben* [ven] → Middle Irish *in ben* [ven] → Classical Gaelic *an bhean* [ven] → Modern Gaelic *a' bhean* [vɛn]\n\n&gt;Synchronic lenition in Scottish Gaelic affects almost all consonants (except /l̪ˠ/ which has lost its lenited counterpart).  Changes such as /n̪ˠ/ to /n/ involve the loss of [secondary articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_articulation); in addition, /rˠ/ → /ɾ/ involves the reduction of a [trill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trill_consonant) to a [tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_consonant). The spirantization of Gaelic nasal /m/ to /v/ is unusual among forms of lenition, but is triggered by the same environment as more prototypical lenition. (It may also leave a residue of [nasalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasalization) in adjacent vowels.  The orthography shows this by inserting an *h* (except after *l n r*):\n\n&gt;Some languages which have lenition have in addition complex rules affecting situations where lenition might be expected to occur but does not, often those involving [homorganic consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homorganic_consonants). In Scottish Gaelic, for example, there are three homorganic groups: \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* d n t l s (usually called the [dental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_consonant) group in spite of the non-dental nature of the palatals)\n\n&gt;* c g (usually called the [velar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_consonant) group)\n\n&gt;* b f m p (usually called the [labial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant) group)\n\n&gt;In a position where lenition is expected due to the grammatical environment, lenition tends to be blocked if there are two adjacent homorganic consonants across the word boundary. For example: \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *aon* 'one' (which causes lenition) → *aon chas* 'one leg' vs *ao__n t__aigh* 'one house' (not *aon *thaigh*)\n\n&gt;* *air an* 'on the' (which causes lenition) → *air a' chas mhòr* 'on the big leg' vs *air a__n t__aigh __d__onn* \"on the brown house\" (not *air an *thaigh *dhonn)*\n\n&gt;In modern Scottish Gaelic this rule is only [productive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_(linguistics\\)) in the case of dentals but not the other two groups for the vast majority of speakers. It also does not affect all environments any more. For example, while *aon* still invokes the rules of blocked lenition, a noun followed by an adjective generally no longer does so. Hence: \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *ad* \"hat\" (a feminine noun causing lenition) → *ad dhonn* \"a brown hat\" (although some highly conservative speakers retain *ad donn*)\n\n&gt;* *caileag* \"girl\" (a feminine noun causing lenition) → *caileag ghlic* \"a smart girl\" (not *caileag *glic*)\n\n&gt;There is a significant number of frozen forms involving the other two groups (labials and velars) and environments as well, especially in surnames and place names: \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *Ma__cG__umaraid* 'Montgomery' (*mac* + *Gumaraid*) vs *Ma__cDh__òmhnaill* 'MacDonald (*mac* + *Dòmhnall*)\n\n&gt;* *Cai__mb__eul* 'Campbell' (*cam* 'crooked' + *beul* 'mouth') vs *Ca__msh__ron* 'Cameron' (*cam* + *sròn* 'nose')\n\n&gt;* *sgia__n-d__ubh* '[Sgian-dubh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgian-dubh)' (*sgian* 'knife' + *dubh* '1 black 2 hidden'; *sgian* as a feminine noun today would normally cause lenition on a following adjective) vs *sgian dhubh* \"a black knife\" (i.e., a common knife which just happens to be black)\n\n&gt;Though rare, in some instances the rules of blocked lenition can be invoked by lost historical consonants, for example, in the case of the past-tense [copula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics\\)) *bu*, which in [Common Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Celtic) had a final -t. In terms of blocked lenition, it continues to behave as a dental-final particle invoking blocked lenition rules: \n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;* *bu __d__ona am biadh* \"bad was the food\" versus *bu __mh__òr am beud* 'great was the pity\n\n&gt;Blocked lenition phenomena are also known to occur in Irish and [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) (orthographic b d g retained as /b/, /d/, /ɡ/ following nasals rather than their normal lenited forms [β, ð, ɣ]).\n\n&gt;In the modern Celtic languages, lenition of the \"fricating\" type is usually denoted by adding an *h* to the lenited letter. In Welsh, for example, *c*, *p*, and *t* change into *ch*, *ph*, *th* as a result of the so-called \"aspirate mutation\" (*carreg*, \"stone\" → *ei charreg* \"her stone\"). An exception is [Manx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_language) orthography, which tends to be more phonetic, although in some cases etymological principles are applied. In the [Gaelic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_type), fricating lenition (called simply *lenition* in Irish grammar contexts) is indicated by a [dot above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_above#Overdot) the affected consonant, while in the Roman script, the convention is to suffix the letter *h* to the consonant, to signify that it is lenited. Thus, *a ṁáṫair* is equivalent to *a mháthair*. In [Middle Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Irish) manuscripts, lenition of *s* and *f* was indicated by the dot above, while lenition of *p*, *t*, and *c* was indicated by the postposed *h*; lenition of other letters was not indicated consistently in the orthography.\n\n&gt;Voicing lenition is represented by a simple letter switch in the [Brythonic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brythonic_languages), for instance *carreg*, \"stone\" → *y garreg*, \"the stone\" in Welsh. In [Irish orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_orthography), it is shown by writing the \"weak\" consonant alongside the (silent) \"strong\" one: *peann*, \"pen\" → *ár bpeann* \"our pen\", *ceann*, \"head\" → *ár gceann* \"our head\" (sonorization is traditionally called \"eclipsis\" in Irish grammar).\n\n&gt;Although nasalization as a feature also occurs in most Scottish Gaelic dialects, it is not shown in the orthography on the whole as it is synchronic (i.e., the result of certain types of nasals affecting a following sound), rather than the diachronic Irish type sonorization (i.e., following historic nasals). For example *taigh* [t̪ʰɤj] \"house\" → *an taigh* [ən̪ˠˈd̪ʰɤj] \"the house\".  \n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Irish ^initial ^mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_initial_mutations) ^| [^Fortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortition) ^| [^Scottish ^Gaelic ^phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_phonology) ^| [^Debuccalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debuccalization) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cntjjgg) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cntjjgg)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421643315", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I know the Melee scene formed in a different era where the internet wasn't as developed a resource yet, but the way that 4 has entered, removing M from Apex and opening us up to increased meddling (BEAST 5 texture pack) from Nintendo, which did fuck all for the smash scene for a long time has made people much more ready to throw shade on 4. Like sure, Zero almost lost to an Australian. But Armada 4 stocked Leffen, twice, and lost. And Leffen was on a tear but then M2K stepped the fuck up. These kind of storylines are one of the major reasons people get involved in the scene or maintain the hype.\n\nAll of that being said, I feel for you. You have a chicken and egg problem that will hopefully change at Apex. It's really fortunate for the 4 scene that it gets immediate exposure at a massive tournament. Maybe this will change people's minds, but until that time just be aware that efforts to promote 4 will be regarded warily because of how Brawl nearly killed us.\n\nIdk feeling like B L O G B O Y S right now but these thoughts are how I feel about this whole thing\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421645709", "subreddit": "smashbros", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The thing about scales is they exist all over the guitar. If you look online for \"practice scales\" you may see one that says \"G major scale\" that will include all of the notes in the key of G major (G A B C D E F#), but more often than not they're only showing you *one* position you can play that scale in.\n\nSo to take your example, you absolutely can play a G major scale solely on the low E string, just like you can play it solely on any string on the entire guitar. But now if a few friends ask you if you want to jam in G major, it probably wouldn't be very fun or melodic if you just kept hitting the notes in G major only on the low E string the whole time.\n\nSo basically when you look at a scale, it contains all of the notes that are in that key and often times (especially if the scale is 3 notes per string) there will be repeats of the same note within that scale (like for a G major open scale, you have your G 3rd fret of low E string, and then again simply as the open G string). \n\nSorry if that is overwhelming to read, I can clarify further if you want. Basically my point is that there is not *one* scale for each key, there are many scale positions and once you learn the notes of the fretboard, you can improvise and blend scale patterns together so that you are always in key no matter where you are on the fretboard.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421652992", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I love running people through their first raid. What I despise though, is taking people through who claim to be raid veterans who say 'this is just my alt'. Bro I have run the VOG 25ish times. 15-20 of those times were on hard. I know what I am doing and I sure as hell know if you don't know what you are doing. \n\nI am lazy so I have 3 warlocks, but I run my clan mates lower level alts through the VOG on normal a lot. I mean their alts are on average 24-26. However they know what they are doing and they transfer all their good weapons to their alts before a Vault run. So even a level 25 will do ok in the vault if he knows what he is doing, and has a full set of legendary weapons, vault weapons and a maxed out Gjallarhorn/Ice breaker. \n\nWhen I do these runs I often state on LFG sites that I am more than happy to take inexperienced players through. I mean I am level 32 and I have 2 manned the VOG on normal, 3 manned it on hard mode. I have just about every exotic in the game and every single VOG weapon maxed out. So no matter how bad some people are I can still usually get through. \n\nHowever when people lie and say they have done it before and volunteer for a really crucial role as they have apparently done it before. Then screw up royally it really bugs me. \n\nI set up a game running my friends level 27 hunter through. Got a few people from LFG, a few who had never run it before and this one guy who claimed to have done it before who had a level 26 titan but claimed to have a 30+ alt with plenty of raid experience. \n\nFirstly this guy wiped twice when opening the Vault. I thought whatever, maybe he is just used to being more powerful and isn't used to working as hard. It happens. \n\nThen he knocks two people off the cliff (myself included) waiting by the first chest. I usually go VOG flawless so that really irritated me. We get through Confluxes &amp; oracles just fine, but then again I can 2 man those. \n\nHowever then we get to templar. Now I have a maxed out Black hammer and Gjallarhorn at 331 damage, as well as a whole host of top tier primary weapons at 331 damage which makes me a really strong DPS specialist so I rarely offer to be the relic holder. We are in party chat and someone said 'oh I will take it I have done it load of times before'. So I quickly explain the battle plan as a few new players are with us. It turns out the guy who picked up the relic was the guy who claimed to be experienced, but proves to be anything but experienced, or just a moron. \n\nHe said at the start of the fight that we shouldn't worry about the oracles as he would 'take care of them'. So the first alarm bells go off about a minute into the fight when I see him use the relics super to kill a few harpies. Ok, bit weird, maybe they were JUST about to kill him. \n\nThen, he proceeds not to 'get the oracles'. And we all get marked, accidents happen right? However what he does next just made me stick this idiot in the naughty step for the rest of the raid. He proceeds to run around the map when we are all marked, running away from us while we are all screaming 'CLEANSE', bare in mind this guy is a titan and even though we are mostly warlocks/hunters so we should be able to keep up with a titan easily. This dude just goes Usain Bolt on us and takes off. 4 of us go down because of his headless chicken act. Of Course this guy is now saying 'we should just wipe'.  Luckily the 5th guy is my friend running his 27 hunter through the VOG for the first time, has his Mida armed or something and is the only one who manages to keep up with this guy and by some miracle gets cleansed. Lets just refer to this guy as the 'dumb titan' from now on. The Dumb titan gets killed, my clan mate, mike, on his hunter, picks up the relic, get me up, drops the relic for me and the rest of the fight goes through as planned, and we kill the templar just before enrage. \n\nSo next, gorgons. I explain the don't double jump, just follow me, keep together. dumb titan freaking shotgun slides a gorgon expecting it to die on the first blast or after his follow up mele like hes sliding around PVP. We wipe. \n\nNext, we get all the way to the jumping puzzle, I am explaining how each class gets across the easy way. Warlocks follow me, hunters go blade dancer titan uses death from above..... hang on, where is dumb titan? 'The gorgons have spotted their prey'. DAMN it!!!!! Wipe. \n\nThen Once we (finally) get through. I get through the jumping puzzle in about 15 seconds, warlocks can just do that incredibly easy. I sit my guardian down in that area before the gatekeepers and tell the team 'I am going to take a dump and get something to eat'. I go off for 5 -10 minutes. Of course when I get back, guess who we are missing? You probably guessed right. After another 15 minutes we just tell him to quit and we will invite him back. \n\nSo we are at gatekeepers. Now as I mentioned I have a black hammer and Gjallarhorn at 331 so I am more than capable of soloing past, breaking through to right and taking out the gatekeeper and killing everything in future. I don't think gatekeepers has ever taken me more than 5 minutes since week 1 of the VOG when we had to figure that shit out. I hear in the part chat, 'oh don't worry I will defend the center'. Guess who does not defend center? And we wipe because to many vex sacrificed themselves. So I get one of the newbies to go center and help the guy. Then he keeps calling for help and people to come over to the point where me and my clan mate are left and stuck inside the future portal as nobody is left holding it open. Wipe. \n\nNext time, dumb titan goes in trying to kill the gatekeeper, forgets that he can cleanse himself once he has the relic. Keeps calling for a cleanse. At this point I am literally screaming at him. On another attempt I hear this voice saying 'I need a cleanse I am blind'. So I ask who needs a cleanse, silence meets this statement. WHO NEEDS A CLEANSE YOU TWAT I DO NOT KNOW YOUR VOICE WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE BY THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE. \n\nIt must have taken 10+ times to get through gatekeeper alone. Of course when we do get both the relics out, he gets himself killed and the second before the team wipes I drop my relic and pick his up and one of the newbies takes the other in the nick of time. And we get to atheon and I am pretty much bald with stress at this point. And all I am thinking is 'this is going to take f-ing hours'.\n\nSo I explain the basic concept of the fight very quickly, not forgetting to mention that they should not fire rockets out of the bubble. First time I do not get taken by atheon. So burn through my Gjallarhorn ammo and take off a third of the bosses health. Dumb titan happens to be the relic holder. Second time through, I get taken so hold the relic. Once we get through I remind everyone; 'remember no rockets'. Guess who does not f-king listen. Bang, he is dead and starts screaming at us as someone must have moved in front of him. No, we didn't I was in 3rd person and saw him pull out his RL in the center of the bubble and just nuke himself. \n\nWe honestly didn't even bother reviving him. Next time we I don't get taken and black hammer the rest of Atheons health away with the rest of my team. \n\nNext thing I hear is dumb titans voice saying 'oh that went well, who wants to do crota?'. \n\nF U C K N O. \n\nI being a level 32 I can basically solo crota. And I was sure as hell not going to carry his dumb ass through.\n\nTL;DR. Don't lie about knowing what your doing, or don't be a moron in general.

{"body": "A perfect square is a number that only has square terms in it. For example, 4x^(2) is a perfect square because it can be represented by (2x)^(2), and this is only a square.\n\nSimilarly, a square number is the result of the product of two numbers that are identical. 4 is a square number because 2^(2) = 2 x 2 = 4. This extends to algebra too, y^(2) is a square number since y x y = y^(2) The square root is the inverse of this, it asks what number when multiplied by itself yields the result. So the square root of 4 is 2, since 2 x 2 = 4. The square root of 25 is 5 since 5 x 5 = 25 etc. \n\nA power is the number of times something is multiplied by itself. So 3^(2) = 3 x 3. 3 multiplied by itself twice. 9^(4) = 9 x 9 x 9 x 9. 9 multiplied by itself 4 times. Anything to the power of 1 is itself, 7^(1) = 7, 10000^(1) = 10000. Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1 by definition. Again, this extends to algebra, so a^(4) = a x a x a x a. a multiplied by itself 4 times.\n\nRatios are denoted by a colon. 1:2 is a ratio, for every 1 of item A, there is 2 of item B. a:5b means that for every one of a, there is 5 of b.

{"body": "Modes are a little tricky to explain, but I'll try. First, there are seven modes named after Greek islands, and they are:\n\n1. Ionian\n\n2. Dorian\n\n3. Phrygian\n\n4. Lydian\n\n5. Mixolydian\n\n6. Aeolian\n\n7. Locrian \n\nSo now take the major scale:\n\nDoe Re Mi Fa So La Ti Doe\n\nSo if we start on Doe and sing it just like the above, we would be in the \"Ionian\" mode, because \"Ionian\" basically equates to natural  \"major scale.\" We are starting on Doe (which therefore is the #1 or \"root\" note) and singing the scale through.\n\nContrasting that, \"Aeolian\" equates to natural \"minor scale.\" So since the Aeolian mode is the 6th mode, that means if we take the 6th note in the scale (La), and make that our root note, we will be in the Aeolian mode, and thereby singing the minor scale:\n\nLa Ti Doe Re Mi Fa So La\n\nSo in essence, the only different in this case between Ionian and Aeolian is which note we started the scale with. \n\nIn terms of guitar music now, we have the Cmajor scale:\n\nC D E F G A B C \n\nNotice now that C is our root note, and A is the 6th note away (the same relationship that Doe and La had).\n\nSo that scale, as written above, could be called C major, or C *Ionian*. \n\nBut now let's rearrange it like we did above and make A our root:\n\nA B C D E F G A\n\nWhat we now have here is the A minor scale, or otherwise called A *Aeolian*. And as we know, C major and A minor both share the same exact notes, just in a different order, as we illustrated above.\n\nSo that's the gist of modes in a nutshell....each mode has a different feel to it, and each is used to get different effects or draw different emotions. There is a formula to construct any mode in any key, but for now I'd just say to google it if you are interested and read up on the basics. Modes are pretty fun once you get the hang of things!\n\nEdit: I should add, C major and A minor work out like they do because they are \"relative keys\" which means they share the exact same notes in a different order. If we instead played around and wanted to do C Lydian ( the \"formula\" for Lydian being a raised 4th note) we'd have for our scale now:\n\nC D E F# G A B C\n\nHowever, since we now have an F# (due to the raised 4th.....F being the 4th note in the C major scale) we are now in the key of G Major. So basically if you were jamming with someone and they say the key is G major, you could play a C Lydian scale and be in key, but you could *not* play C Ionian (major) or A Aeolian (minor) because those scales are in the key of C major/A minor, because the F is natural, not sharp. \n\nSorry if I confused you with this edit, I can try to explain further if you want!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421698534", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So, this actually depends on a lot of factors. But as you said, we will take the assumption that nothing in your body changes except the loss of fat. So no additional range of motion due to your slimming down or anything else.\n\nWhen you jump, at first, your body has a lot of kinetic energy (motion energy). This is your legs doing their work. As you ascend, that kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. At the apex of your jump, all of that kinetic energy has converted into potential energy. As you are coming down, the reverse happens. \n\nNow you conveniently provided your weight and your maximum jump height. Using those, we can calculate the potential energy that you have at the full height of your jump (metric):\n\nE_pot = m x g x h = 106.59 (kg) x 9.81 (ms^-2 ) x 0.5842 (m) =  610.87 J\n\nNow assuming that after the weight loss you would be able to put the same energy into a jump (and I'm assuming, in a realistic environment, it would be more!), the new jump height is calculated as such:\n\nh= E_pot / (m x g) = 610.87 / (90.718 x 9.81) = 0.686 m = ~ 27 inches.\n\nIn essence, go for it!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421701240", "subreddit": "theydidthemath", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "We normally count to 10, then we start counting a different decimal place right?\n\n\n00-01-02-03-04-05-06-07-08-09,  so that is 0 to 9 (10 digits).  But the next number is too big so the \"10\"'s place is incremented.  Now we count again,  10-11-12-13-14-15.... and so on.   So we have this notion of a 1's place, a 10's place, then a 100's place, etc..  This is base 10.\n\n\nAnother example is base 2 (more or less \"binary\", surely you've heard of it).  It works like this.   There are only 2 numbers per \"place\".  0 and 1.    SO we start counting:\n\n00-01-  but not we can't count higher than 1!! so we roll it over into the  \"two's\" place, and when the twos place is too small, it goes over into the four's place, etc..    so binary is counted like this:\n\n000\n\n001\n\n010\n\n011\n\n100\n\n101\n\n110\n\n111\n\nand that is as high as we can count with only the one, two, and four's places.  But you can continue by adding on an eight's,  sixteen's, thirtytwo's place... and so on.\n\n\n\nSo normal counting has base 10, and binary has base 2.  This base number you can kind of think of as \"how many possible numbers are there for one \"place\".  \n\n\nOf course you can do this with bases higher than 10,  but if you use two digit numbers for one \"place\" it gets really confusing without a lot of spacing.  Otherwise you don't know where one \"place\" starts and another \"place\" ends.

{"body": "Hi there\n\nA great, advanced way of going from a m7 chord to a maj7 or 7 is to hit the different notes in the chord. For eg. If it was 2 beats of gm7 then g7 (don't worry too much about the altered notes yet) , the only different note is the B. Since the next chord is cm7, the B is an excellent leading note into the next chord. So a reasonably good line would be like G A D B. Hitting that B will definitely outline the change well. Even a simple line like G G B B will sound hip.\n\nIf u wanna play with the altered stuff a bit more, u can just make the whole bar an altered chord. A #5 and #9 also means the 5 and 9 are also flattened. so the notes of a G7 #5#9 are G, Ab, Bb, Cb (or B), Db, Eb, F. Quite a dissonant chord, every note including the 4th is flat. So a super line would be G, Ab, Bb, B. Might sound a bit crazy, especially since the soloist might still be sitting on the m7 chord for the first two beats. \n\nMinor blueses are relatively common in jazz, though I can't think of any off the top of my head apart from don grolnick 'nothing personal' there's a real cool version bu Michael brecker. If you type in minor blues bass line into google u will get some cool lines and better explainations that what I can give you. Walking on a chord for 4 bars is tough. Try to land on the 5th or the root note on the first beat of every bar. If you're feeling adventurous, try the 3rd. Here's a line I might play in the first four bars\n\nG A Bb C , D Eb F A , G A Bb A , G F D B , C\n\nThat wasn't the best. But I hit all the correct notes on the correct beats.\n\nThe tricky part is the b6 to the 5. You can get away with just playing arpeggios here. But if you wanna be a fancy fucker u could play something like \n\nEb Db C Bb , A G E F# \n\nHere I'm playing a descending line but changing in the second bar to fit the new chord. Be careful playing that G if it is a slow song, never ever ever play the 4th of a major or a dominant chord in a slow song. Its the most dissonant note in music and the only note jazzers hate. Play a G# if its slow. Mmm b5s...now we LOVE that note...\n\nAnyway that's some brief info. U should write it out yourself otherwise u won't learn. Steal from everyone!\n\nEdit - are you sure that's the correct chord changes? There should be 2 bars of gm7 on the end and only 3.5 bars of gm7 at the start.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421707208", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

At different points in the game and in different manners. Herc is ability based and his damage is all early-mid. It is still there, but you arent 100-0'ing anybody except the squishiest targets. Osiris is the opposite. Heavily favoring AA's and Qin's. His damage is lower in the early and mid and spikes insanely late once Qins is up and running. Shredding anybody and anyone. Nearing Hypercarry status. \n\n&gt; Guan has to choose\n\nNot particularly. Guan just does his damage differently.The channel on TA is rather long, but it does an immense amount of damage while increasing every other source of damage that enemy takes for a period of time and making Guan all that much tankier. You can also cancel this ability early to get faster \"burst\" damage out. Once youve channeled for .9sec, youve gotten max stacks off and on from TA. Cancel - AA-Dash for less overall damage but faster and more bursty damage. Guan's ultimate is also one of the, if not the absolute, hardest hitting physical ultimates in the game. The damage scales 25% per hit. This is difficult, but youre rewarded in the end if you manage all the hits.\n\n&gt; Even tyr feels like he does more damage when he goes full tank.\n\nHe doesnt. Not even kind of. Tyr is far more effective at being a nuisance though.\n\n&gt; herc has amazing peel... it makes guan look like ass \n\nCorrect. Though TBH Herc's kit has insane hard CC. He used to have another attached to his boulder -.- He has an unbeadable Old Arachne ult/Sylv pull and a better fearless (in that full damage is applied regardless of beads/magi's). Bloated kit is bloated.\n\n\n\nOnto the post!\n\nGuan. Oh Guan Yu. I love me some Guan Yu play man, I really do. Talou Assault is quite satisfying and his heal is actually quite good. And that ultimate! Cavalry Charge hits like a truck. While it may not apply its full damage super fast, ala boulder, the stacking damage on top of the slow AND the massive aoe stun on the final hit is great. Baiting out leaps and dashes with TA/Dash is essential if youre going for full horseboys damage. Also being able to control it well is key but we will get a little section on HORSEBOYS here in a moment.\n\nSome things you can do to get a little more oomph out of guan...\n\nI forgo the typical early smithy's hammer and go straight into Mystical Mail. Guan's sustain is instant and can get a CD of 4 seconds with jotuns and hitting a teammate. You want to stay up in the middle of a teamfight for a longass time. And Guan can. Oh he absolutely can. Keeping mystical mail constantly ticking on 3+ players in a ton of damage. And the natural protections people gain as they level wont diminish the MM damage all that much due to the hefty shred that TA brings to the table. Keep people shredded, dash through the enemies to lower your CDs, Heal when you can.\n\nTrying to explode someone real fast? Simply start TA and channel for 1sec or so (.9 to be exact), cancel it, immedaitely AA and follow it with a dash. Youll drop 2 seconds off your next TA and have them slowed for a couple AA's and mystical ticks. Didnt get them low enough, Ult!\n\nMid teamfight, youre really looking to be spamming the hell out of your abilities. The mana from Jotuns and hopefully the HoU youve picked up will help out immensely. I also always try and keep a blue buff whenever possible regardless the stage of the game.\n\n\n**H O R S E B O Y S**\n\nWooooo Cavalry Charge. Simple as that. I love this ability. Aside from being rather humorous, its quite strong.\n\nKeep the damage scaling in mind. As well as being able to cancel it early for the stun.\nYou will inherit your current move speed before getting on the horse. Need to go extra fast? Pop heavenly or sprint first and hold your W down to ride like the wind. Trying to kill an isolated target? Keep S held down to ride real slow and turn a bit to slow it down even more. You really want to try and bait out dashes and leaps before you ult but if you cant you HAVE to try and predict where they will go and be ready to chase.\n\nOn the scaling. The damage from the first swing is medicore, but the next swing and every one after scales by 25% each and every swing. This scaling, especially coupled with the TA shred, is very very scary. Boulder scary.\n\n\n\nA couple of tips for the solo lane.\n\nWhile TA does more damage over time, you can use your dash to clear waves. This is especially useful against someone who is stopping your TA. When youre up against someone who can, and is, stopping your TA just simply level up the dash and is it to clear the wave instead. Youre also a rather decent pusher. Dont be afraid to poke the enemy laner with TA or whatever to pull minion aggro. This will stack your passive near instantly. Pop your heal for yourself *and your minions* to slow down their clear and push them under tower. This is another reason I go MM really early when against physicals. They have to come up to clear the wave. They will get hit by mystical ticks, they will likely take TA to the face for a bit. You WILL get minion aggro and you WILL get full passive stacks. Heal yourself. Heal the Minions. VEL as they struggle to clear the wave. Also keep in mind that every tick of TA, every .3 seconds, staggers the minions and reduces the damage you take from them when clearing.\n\n\nA few more things. Guan Yu isnt the best mid-line peeler for your carries. Your job, primarily, is to harrass the enemy to avoid them ever getting to your backline. Guan is rather well suited to doing this. You can peel decently enough with a slow, a heal, and counter pressure. But you dont have Herc and Tyr peel.

{"body": "Sure, I figured that might be confusing. And no problem, explaining it helps me solidify it as well.\n\nSo before I explain the edit, I'll quickly explain how to \"construct\" a major and minor scale.\n\nTwo terms to know:\n\n    Whole Step: Refers to 2 frets above the fret you are on (a whole step from fret 1 would be fret 3)\n\n    Half Step: Refers to 1 fret above the fret you are on, the fret right next to it (a half step from fret 1\nwould be fret 2)\n\nThe \"formula\" for a major scale is:\n\n    Whole Whole Half Whole Whole Whole Half\n\nThat is, 2 whole steps, a half step, 3 whole steps, and another half step.\n\nSo if we look at C major again, we can start on any C on the fretboard and follow that formula and wind up with the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. \n\nYou can try it on your guitar, start for example on the 1st fret B string (which is a C) and then move one whole step. You'll find that you are now on 3rd fret B string (which is a D). Go another whole step, and you'll be on the 5th fret (which is an E). Then, go a half step from there to fret 6, and you are now on F. \n\nContinue the pattern until the end, and you'll end up on the 13th fret, which is a C (back where you started). You've now just played the C Major scale on the B string. \n\nThere is another formula for the minor scale which is:\n\n    Whole Half Whole Whole Half Whole Whole\n\nThis works exactly the same as above. So if we go back to our example with Cmajor/Aminor, an A minor scale would be constructed by starting on A, and then following that formula which will bring you back to A. \n\nThese two formulas can be used to figure out any major or minor key out there. \n\nSimply pick a note (any note.....D, E, F#, anything) and follow the formula you want, write down what notes you are landing on as you go, and you end up with \"[note you picked] Scale\"  and it'll either be major or minor depending on which formula you chose to follow.\n\nNow that we have that background, onto the edit:\n\nWe just saw above how and why C Major and A Minor are related. It's because if you follow the formula for a Major scale starting on C, and the formula for a  minor scale starting on A, you wind up with the exact same notes (C D E F G A B). \n\nSo the main difference between the two keys is simply the starting point and the chords involved (which have to do with which note you start on, because chords in a major or minor key have a similar rule set to how a scale is constructed, but that's a story for another day).\n\nWith the edit, I was getting at how there are more than just two modes to choose from. Ionian and Aeolian (major and minor) are great and easy to demonstrate how modes work, but there are 5 more you can pick from.\n\nMy example was C Lydian. As I mentioned previously, each mode has a \"formula\" of it's own. The formula is basically just telling you how to modify the major scale that you choose in order to play that mode. \n\nThe \"formula\" for the Lydian mode is to simply raise (sharpen) the fourth note of the major scale. Our C Major scale again:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nAbove, the 4th note is the F, since we count C as number 1. Therefore, if we follow the Lydian \"formula\" and sharpen the 4th, we end up with:\n\nC D E F# G A B C \n\nWe now have C Lydian. The \"C\" because that is our root note; that is the major scale we started from. The \"Lydian\" because that is how we modified  the C Major scale (the Lydian formula called for a raised 4th, and that is what we did).\n\nHOWEVER, this is where it gets tricky. These again are the notes we now have:\n\nC D E F# G A B C\n\nThese notes *do not* work anymore if you try to follow the major scale formula from C. You can try it yourself, starting on C and following the major scale formula (w w h w w w h) will *never* give you an F#. This means that *we are no longer in the key of C Major* when playing the C Lydian mode. \n\nHowever, although you will never get C D E F# G A B from a C major scale, you WILL get those EXACT notes from a *G Major Scale*. \n\nGo ahead and try it on your guitar. Start on any G on the fretboard (like 3rd fret of the Low E string) and follow the major scale formula (w w h w w w h).\n\nWhen you do this, you will find that you get these notes:\n\nG A B C D E F# G\n\nYou'll notice that these are the *same notes we got from figuring out C Lydian. \n\nC Lydian was:\n\nC D E F# G A B C\n\nG Major Scale is:\n\nG A B C D E F# G\n\nThe notes are exactly the same for both scales, they just start on different notes (C Lydian starts on C, hence the name. G Major starts on G, hence the name).\n\nTherefore, we know that C Lydian is in the key of G Major because they both contain the same exact notes.\n\nSo to recap, in order to come to this conclusion we:\n\n1. Figured out the notes in the C Major scale via the major scale formula (whole whole half, whole whole whole half)\n\n2. We took the notes we got from this (C D E F G A B C) and wrote them out to see which note is in which position (from the C which is #1, down to B which is #7).\n\n3. We then followed the Lydian \"formula\" to modify the C major scale into a C Lydian scale, which we did by sharpening the 4th note (the F).\n\n4. We then noticed that the notes we now have in C Lydian (C D E F# G A B C) are different than those in C Major (specifically the F#). This means that this group of notes is *not* part of the C Major scale anymore, so it must fall somewhere else.\n\n5. We noticed that if we start on G and follow the major scale formula (like we did in step 1 with C) we get the notes (G A B C D E F# G). These are the exact same notes we found in C Lydian\n\n6. Therefore, we determined that C Lydian is in the Key of G Major.\n\nDoes that make more sense?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421713096", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;The 'single digit' numbers would be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f\n\nYou're almost right. In a base n system, you need n 'single digits' (from 0 up to n-1), but you've got from 0 up to 15 in your base 15 system. Just like in base 10 we only go from 0-9, and don't have a 'digit' for 10. So in base 15, you would have  \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e\n\n&gt;Is that all a base really is?\n\nYep, that's pretty much it.\n\n&gt;In base 15, woud 15+5, be f+5=f5. \n\nAlmost, but you're getting lost in the base idea a little. To get a little closer to home, that' would be like saying 9+5 = 92, which doesn't make sense. Instead, 9+5 = 1 x 10 + 4, so we get the 1 in front of the 10 and we get the 4 from the remainder, and we get 14. Similarly, in base 15, 15+5 = 1x15 + 5, so we get a 1 from in front of the 15 and then the 5 from the remainder, so you would get that 15+5=15 (however this is an abuse of notation, since we are currently in base 15, so it should actually say 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nThe more general/harder pattern, if you care, is, if you have a number which is represented by the expansion d_n d_{n-1} .... d_2 d_1 d_0 in base b (i.e. for the number 1023, d_0 = 3, d_1 = 2, d_2 = 0, d_3 = 1), then the value of that number is \n\nd\\_n x b^n + d\\_{n-1} x b^{n-1} + ... + d_2 x b^2 + d_1 x b^1 + d_0 b^0\n\nWhich is what we inadvertently do in our head when we see numbers. So in base 10, the number 1023 = 1 x 1000 + 0 x 100 + 2 x 10 + 3, while in base 15 the number 1023 = 1 x 15^3 + 0 x 15^2 + 2 x 15 + 3 = 3408 (in base 10).\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421714013", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "http://www.meleeitonme.com/ssbm-rank-2014-100-91/ here's the start of a basic rundown of the top 100 players today. As you watch the streams, you can start to catch up on the histories of some players. A basic starting point if you have 4 hours and 13 minutes would be the smash doc in the OP, though it doesn't talk much about current players save for M2K and Mango. I could give you cliffs notes but even the cliffs notes are long as fuck:\n\n* Mango is considered best in the world right now. Fox main, though he goes Falco vs Foxes. His main rival is Armada, against whom he always reps a USA tag. Can act like an ass (I personally dislike him) but you can't deny that he's been dominant in the scene for almost 7 years now. He's famous for his incredibly aggressive playstyle; the moves he makes aren't the ones that SHOULD work but he's always free-styling, even in the middle of a set.\n\n* Armada is considered second best behind Mango. Peach main. Swedish. Many consider him the only person seriously able to challenge Mango in tournament on a regular basis. He has huge trouble with Hungrybox, so he's trained up a series of counterpicks for his puff. That's a pretty storied rivalry that probably got its most hype when Armada beat Hungrybox in Grand Finals of APEX 2011 with Young Link. He spends hours in the lab perfecting Peach's punish game on Space animals, famous for his punishes and tendency to pull a stitch-face (super powerful turnip, 1/300 chance) at hilariously opportune moments.\n\n* PPMD often posts on this subreddit. People basically slept on him until he had an EXPLOSIVE early 2014, not dropping a set starting at APEX and his streak only ending at MLG. He's a falco main, but recently he's been dual maining marth, and they're both things of beauty. He famously 4stocked Mew2King in a Marth ditto on FD in APEX winners finals, where Mew2King's trademark is his Marth on FD. He's considered to have the best neutral game of any player, and to take a more intellectual approach to Smash than any other player. \n\n* Mew2King is the oldest smasher who's still in the upper echelons of today's scene. Known as \"The Robot,\" M2K is famous for his research into melee's frame data, his insistence on frame-perfect tech and always making the OPTIMAL move, and his glaring social incompetence. He's not too difficult to beat on-stage for most of the other top Smashers, but nobody challenges mew2king on the ledge. If you see someone ledgestalling for 30 seconds, I promise you it's m2k. His marth is his trademark, but he also co-mains sheik and fox.\n\n* Hungrybox is the only top-level Jigglypuff. He's famous for his amazing ability to space and camp with back-airs. Mango used to regularly disparage him for \"playing gay\" and \"ruining melee\" because of his refusal to play offensively, hence the start of a rather intense (and one-sided, considering that Fox is a hard counter to Puff) rivalry, though it's cooled down over the past year or so. His favorite porn star is Hitomi Tanaka.\n\nThese five players are collectively known as the \"gods of melee,\" and they've dominated the scene in the post-EVO07 era. From 2008 until 2015, any smash tournament where at least two of these five attended, was one by one of these five. This streak was broken LAST WEEK at BEAST 5 by:\n\n* Leffen, who is a Swedish Fox main. He's infamous for his trash-talking abilities and being the first serious contender to break into the ranks of the Gods. He was banned from Swedish tournaments for a while because he was a consistent asshole at tournaments; the evidence of his being an asshole was compiled into a file called evidence.zip (hence the references to it such as Z I P B O Y Z). Though he's no longer an asshole, he intentionally acts as the \"heel\" of the community in order to bring the hype. You either love him or you hate him, I love him. His playstyle relies on his solid fundamentals, and he's probably the best at adapting mid-set that I've ever seen.\n\n* Axe is THE Pikachu main. He jumped Pikachu probably half a dozen spots on the tier list through literally only his hard work. It's honestly hard to talk about axe without just talking about pikachu. His playstyle's trademarks are blazing fast movement, crossups, and ridiculous gimps.\n\n* Hax is another Fox main. He used to be a Falcon main, but about a year ago, expressed his mounting frustration with the character and belief that Falcon could never win a national tournament. Given the choice between an option which can reliably be pulled off and is good or one which is very marginally better and requires quintuple frame perfect inputs to execute, Hax will always choose the latter. He is famous for his (half-joking) prediction that the metagame will devolve into Fox being the only viable character once everyone's tech skill gets perfect, and the fact that he recently had to take an indefinite hiatus due to carpal tunnel syndrome, leading everyone to fear for the health of the top melee players, especially those who play more demanding characters such as fox.\n\nThere's a lot more people I want to write about but i really have to stop; hopefully that's a good enough crash course on the top 8 names in melee today and that the meleeitonme link i provided can fill in what I didn't.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421733914", "subreddit": "smashbros", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

CLG is not the most winning organization but they are the quintessential North American LoL team, along with TSM (who almost sponsored m2k) and I guess C9 now who is the western hope, some would say. \n\nCLG's captain and star, DoubleLift, is sort of the Leffen of the scene, or at least used to be.

{"body": "I did my boyfriend's hair for Halloween last year, he was Rick! I personally think it turned out well considering his hair is super dark and it was my first try. We originally bought an Einstein wig to style/dye, but most wig hair is so cheap and you can see right through to the cap...we ended up ditching that and using his natural hair, which I think works best (unless you're going for a specific style).\n\nIt was surprisingly easy! We bought four cans of that temporary hair paint you get at pretty much any costume shop--2 white, 2 cyan--and some good ol' fashioned Elmer's Glue, like the punk kids use. I put his hair into the spikes first with the Elmer's, as I wasn't sure if the spray stuff would hold well enough (and if you screw up it's easier to fix without the color being in the way), and then used the color afterwards (covered in white, let dry, then covered in cyan). \n\nPROTIP if you use Elmer's: When applying the glue, have a hairdryer nearby and dry the spikes with one hand while holding it in place with the other, so it hardens up well before you move on to the next one. Otherwise they'll start getting saggy. And don't go crazy with it, a tiny amount of Elmer's will go a long way. You can always add more if it isn't enough, but if you put too much glue in one spot it's a bitch to get it to dry and not droop. Learned that the hard way!\n\nAnyway, the color-spray did bead up a little bit (it usually does), and we bought the extra cans to make sure we got all the little crevices and such, but at the risk of being redundant, I think it worked well for our first try! We unrolled a cotton ball for his eyebrow and gave it a little of the cyan (it turned out the color we originally hoped for), and adhered it with Spirit Gum (again, something easy to come by in costume shops). If you try this method, I would suggest buying extra cans and doing a practice run before the event to make sure you can get the look you are going for (and to see how much spray you use up).\n\nHe wants to be Rick again in the future, and I think next time we'll cool it on the Cyan, but here's what it looked like (BTW, it didn't budge all night, and we were in Athens OH, and we R A G E D):\n\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10603600_10152787522304921_3592688364647502028_n.jpg?oh=2d0383effab0a7130ae92c8206eb77f8&amp;oe=55275EB3&amp;__gda__=1432826533_3ba63aa8222abe30e812cc51477e4f70\n\nHope this helps!! \n\nETA: Extra details", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421809565", "subreddit": "rickandmorty", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sorry, I realized before you replied that I probably should have been more clear. Let's backtrack a bit. \n\nIn the video, what Justin was playing *was* a G Major scale. It started on the 3rd fret G of the 6th string, and it included all of the notes in G major (G A B C D E F#). So absolutely yes, that is a G major scale and I shouldn't have said anything about it being F# Locrian.\n\n**However**, let's take that EXACT scale and add ONE note to it. That note we add is the 2nd fret 6th string, which is F#. \n\nSince this now is the first note we play, and in our mode patterns the 1st note is the root note, this scale can now can get slapped with the label of **\"F# Locrian.\"** \n\nIt's basically the same exact G Major scale that justin was playing in the video, except now we've added F# as our first note, thus we are playing an F# Locrian scale, *not* a G Major scale, but we are in the **key** of G Major still.\n\nTake a look at the pattern of Justin's G Major scale, and the generic Locrian pattern I gave you two posts ago. The fingering for both is exactly the same (except of course, the G Major scale doesn't have the F#, but in the Locrian pattern we do play 3 notes on the low E string, and for F# Locrian, that first root note is F#).\n\nSo we're sort of talking about 3 things here:\n\n1. Justin G Major Scale. It starts on G, definitely a G Major scale. But the *pattern* is nearly identical to F# Locrian, minus the actual beginning F#.\n\n2. F# Locrian. Basically identical to the above scale, only we add in the 2nd fret low E string as our root note. If we look at the generic Locrian pattern, and if we look at the Justin scale pattern, they look identical, with the **only** differnce being that Justin's starts on G, and ours starts a fret back on F#.\n\n3. G Ionian. This is also a G Major scale. It starts on G (3rd fret) and we know that Ionian = Major.

But then   once enemy TF hit level 6, the TF + Shaco ganks were too strong. Vayne picked up a quick quadra kill (our Sej got counter ganked and TP Jayce also came down) and pretty much snowballed us well from there.\n\n**Game 2: WIN - 1/1** Support Janna. 2/0/22. Good to be back on support. We probably would have won this game anyways though since our top Wukong already had 3 kills by about the 5 minute mark. Crushed Lissandra.\n\n**Game 3: WIN - 2/1** Support Thresh. 0/3/17. Our top Olaf started 0/2 vs. Fizz, and our Kat mid started 0/2 vs. Lissandra, so I was getting kinda nervous.  We also had a couple close calls slip away from us bottom where the enemy Graves or Morg would get away with less than 50 hp, so that was frustrating. But we finally got a TP gank from jungle Yi that was successful and Sivir got a kill from that to make the score 1/5. Still wasn't feeling great but we managed to sneak a dragon and then pick 2 of them off right after getting Kat a double kill. We snowballed from there with Kat ending with 15 kills or something.\n\n**Game 4: LOSS - 2/2** Support Janna. Classic game of yolo queue. Zac top lane vs. Rumble. He got owned. I didn't mind, at least he was trying still. But then our mid Ahri, after being ganked twice, spam pinged our jungle Vi, then decided to visit each lane and dance for them (Popstar Ahri). She ended the game 1/11 or so and somewhere around level 7? Needless to say we lost that one pretty early. :P\n\n**Game 5: LOSS - 2/3** Support Thresh. Second classic solo queue game in a row. Vi never connects at the start of the match. About 7 minutes in she connects. We're not doing too bad, our Vayne is actually up a few cs on enemy Cait, even though they almost have our tower. Only 1 death on our team and 1 drag for them. We try to stall it out some so Vi can catch up, but Vi gets a little angsty and starts trying to gank even though she's down about 4 levels still, resulting in death. Ends up going 0/9.

{"body": "As others have pointed out, the name of this chord is the common tone diminished 7th, since it has a common tone with the tonic.  It's a bit of a confusing name, but out of the three distinct diminished 7th chords (in 12-tone equal temperament, that is), one has no common tones with a given major triad, one has one -- that's this one -- and one has two.  I better give an example!\n\nLet's say we're talking about C major.  There are three dim7 chords (up to enharmonics).  Cdim7 is C D# F# A (don't mind the arbitrary spellings; you'll see why I spelled them this way), which has C in common with C major.  C#dim7 is C# E G Bb, which has E and G in common with C major.  Ddim7 is D F Ab B, which has no tones in common with C major.\n\nEach of these has a different relation to the tonic.  The one you'll see most often is the third one, the Ddim7, but spelled this way it's actually a Bdim7.  This is the dominant equivalent.  Look, it's a G7b9 without the G!  D F Ab B resolves to C E G C or, more likely, C Eb G C.  This chord is in the C minor scale (harmonic minor, specifically).\n\nThe next one is the C#dim7, which shares a bunch of notes with the tonic, so it doesn't really go to the tonic because that wouldn't be very interesting.  But, just like the previous dim7, it's used most often as the equivalent of a dominant a half step below it.  Spelled this way, C# E G Bb will probably go to Dm as a substitute for A7.  Spell it Db E G Bb and it probably goes to Fm as a substitute for C7.  What it won't do is go to C, because the E and G as common tones means that there's no real change here, so it sounds unsatisfying.\n\nFinally, the Cdim7, which here is actually a D#dim7.  D# F# A C, in this voicing, implies a root that isn't C, so when it goes to C, the D# and F# are active tones -- they want to *go* somewhere -- and they resolve pretty neatly to E and G.  The C that's a common tone?  It's not active.  It's more like a pedal tone than part of the chord.  If you play D F, D# F#, E G and you're in the key of C major, you don't even need to play the C in any of those three chords to understand what happened.  You might even say that this common tone diminished seventh chord isn't a chord at all; it's just a bunch of notes being played at the same time that are each doing their own thing and just happen to sound good together!  In that sense, it's not really functional harmony.  What is the root of the common tone dim7?  I certainly don't know.  It doesn't really have one.  On the other hand, the root of a dominant equivalent dim7 is pretty clear.  The root of Bdim7 in the key of C minor is G.  But since there's no obvious root here, it doesn't fit neatly into the circle of fifths that's so fundamental to Western harmony.  That's because it's not acting as a chord; it's acting as several notes that all have their own directionality.\n\nThat said, the common tone dim7 can be a rooted *secondary* dominant.  This is actually kinda cool.  D#dim7 - C is the common tone resolution, but you can also do D#dim7 - G7 - C, using it as a secondary dominant instead.  That's straight-up functional harmony.  You can also do the cool thing (it was cool in the 18th century, at least) and do D#dim7 - Bdim7 - C.  Look at this.  D# F# A C - D F Ab B - C E G C.  That's two diminished 7ths in a row, and it's perfectly functional harmony!  The D#dim7 is subbing for a D, the Bdim7 is subbing for a G, and you have a V/V - V - I -- all functional!  On the other hand, look at this: D F A C - D# F# A C - E G A C.  Now it's not functional at all; it's all based on chromatic voice leading.  Dm7 - D#dim7 - C6.  Very ragtime.  And this means that the common tone dim7 can either resolve *down* to the tonic, as a secondary dominant, or *up* to the tonic, as a common tone dim7.  Pretty awesome, huh?\n\nI don't usually like dim7 chords.  They don't sound very nice, since they don't have a root, and they're hard to tune on top of that.  I make a huge exception for the common tone dim7, because it doesn't *sound* like a dim7.  It's a great chord!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421897878", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hmm....let ,me try to explain them better.\n\nThey're actually very simple. What you are looking at is basically just a \"generic\" set of scale patterns. Every dot is a note that you play, and the \"white\" dots represent where the root notes are.\n\nSo those patterns are not telling you any specific fret to start on, because like we've been talking about, you can start any one of them anywhere depending on what mode you are trying to play.\n\nSo when you want to play a pattern, you pick the one you want, you put your first finger (index) on the root note on the 6th string, and then you follow the pattern as shown from the first note on the Low E, to the second note on the low E, to the third note on the low E, to the first note on the A string, to the second note on the A string ,to the third note on the A string, and so on and so forth.\n\nYou basically just look at the pattern and it's a literal representation of what notes to play. If there is a black or white dot, you play that fret, if a fret is blank, you don't play that fret.\n\nSorry if it's kind of hard to explain, I'll tab out the first 3 starting with F# Locrian just to see if you understand:\n\n**F# Locrian:**\n\ne-----------------------------------------------------------------3---5---7--\n\nB------------------------------------------------------3---5---7-----------\n\nG-------------------------------------------2---4--5-----------------------\n\nD----------------------------2----4---5-----------------------------------\n\nA----------------2---3--5------------------------------------------------\n\nE---2---3---5------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**G Ionian:**\n\ne-----------------------------------------------------------------5---7---8--\n\nB------------------------------------------------------5---7---8-----------\n\nG-------------------------------------------4---5---7---------------------\n\nD----------------------------4---5---7-----------------------------------\n\nA----------------3---5--7------------------------------------------------\n\nE---3---5---7------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**A Dorian:**\n\ne-----------------------------------------------------------------7---8---10-\n\nB------------------------------------------------------7---8---10---------\n\nG-------------------------------------------5---7---9---------------------\n\nD----------------------------5---7---9-----------------------------------\n\nA----------------5---7--9------------------------------------------------\n\nE---5---7---8------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTry playing those while looking at the corresponding pattern to see if it makes more sense to you. Then think that once you memorize, say, the Ionian pattern (the way your fingers are moving), you can move that pattern to any other root note on the 6th string and play that same pattern to play that root note's Ionian scale.\n\n\nAlso, before I forget, I'll give you the formulas so you can see what every mode actually *does* to the scale.\n\nWe'll use C Major as a reference scale, just to keep things simple. \n\nWhat you'll see below:\n\n    -The mode name: what it does to the specific notes of the major scale\n    -An example of what notes are in that mode, using C Major as a reference (since C major has no \n    natural sharps or flats).\n    -The \"whole half\" method of constructing that modal scale. Notice that \"Ionian\" and \"Aeolian\" we already talked \n    about  when we talked about major/minor scale construction before.\n\nBefore the first mode, just below is the C Major scale written out, and each note numbered 1-7 so that you can reference it if you get confused.\n\nC Major:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nC D E F G A B\n\n~~~\n\n**Ionian:** Simply the major scale, as is.

{"body": "So there are three types of minor scales, and they're all accomplished with varying two notes. I'll use A minor for simplicity in my examples. \n\nThe basic minor scale, which we call natural minor (also known as the Aeolian mode if you're feeling fancy), consists of the notes A B C D E F G A completing a one octave scale. This is different from A's major scale, which has three sharps (C#, F#, and G#), so a minor scale has a flat 3rd, a flat 6th, and a flat 7th when compared to the major scale (this is just kind of how things work, major is the default). \n\nThat's natural minor, and if you play it through it sounds minor, but somewhat unfulfilling at the end. The reason for this is simple, based on the major scale we expect a half step to end a scale and sound \"complete\" (ti-do in solfege). This is where melodic minor comes in. On the way up you would play A B C D E, just like normal, but you add F# and G# (raise the sixth and seventh) to make it more satisfying and put that ti-do resolution back in. On the way down it's a regular natural minor scale with the flat 6th and 7th back in. So melodic minor sounds different when played up than down, which is a major give away if you're ever faced with it on a listening test. So in A minor it looks like this:\n\nA B C D E **F# G#** A and back down A **G F** E D C B A\n\nNow altering the scale up and down can be kind of silly, and though a flat 3rd is the main difference maker as to what sounds \"minor\" to our western ears, having it be the only difference from major is a little weak. This is where the harmonic minor scale comes into play, it's kind of like the compromise between melodic and natural minor. So, as the compromise it takes aspects from both: the (normal for minor) flat 6th from natural minor, and the raised 7th from melodic minor. In A minor that looks like this: \n\nA B C D E F **G#** A \n\nWe have the more satisfying ti-do instead of te-do like in natural minor, but we retain that flat 6th which is an important part of the minor mood. This creates the distinctive jump of an augmented second (which sounds just like a minor third, same number of half steps, but different \"spellings\" of notes) from F to G# which gives harmonic minor it's signature flavor. \n\nHopefully that's helpful, it's kind of a lot of text. Let me know if you have any questions! \n\nEdit because I use the word \"so\" too much in transition.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1421966960", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

I suggest [Hooktheory](http://www.hooktheory.com/), which teaches you all about music theory. This isn't just specific to piano, just about every instrument will be easier to learn with this stuff.\n\nAlso, look at the piano, look at key signatures and how they are spaced on the piano. I can't remember, but every key signature you will ever need goes something like: T T S T T T S T. Where T is a tone, which means there is one key between it and the next (eg C -&gt; D), and S is a semitone, which is means there is no note between it and the next (eg C -&gt; C#).\n\n• If you are interested in guitar, check out chords and how to position your fingers in them. If you have a guitar, play in front of the mirror, play some chords, and if they sound wrong (you'll be able to tell), check the Internet and fix it. I don't really play guitar so I don't know much.\n\nThat's all I got. If you want to play the tuba, tough luck.

{"body": "Forget the accidentals for a minute.  The key signature is supposed to tell the player what key the piece is in.  So, Beethoven decided that he was going to tell the player of Für Elise that it was in A minor.  What does this mean?  Roughly, that the home chord is A minor (I actually use the A minor key signature for some cases where the home chord is A major, but more on that later).  Now, Beethoven doesn't actually have to *use* notes from A minor.  He can write whatever he wants.  At the start of the piece, he's alternating between E and D#, and the D# doesn't happen to be in the key.  That's because it's actually part of the key of E, and at that particular moment, the harmony is E major.  But E major is the dominant chord of A minor.  E major is actually part of the key.  It doesn't seem like it is, since the G# isn't in the key signature, but the minor key is actually two scales in one: the harmonic minor and the melodic minor (and not the natural minor so much). The chords, like the dominant, E major, mostly come from harmonic minor, while the melodic line mostly comes from the melodic minor.  It's not that clear-cut in practice, but that's about how it goes.\n\nBeethoven spends most of his time in the piece alternating between E major (or E7, same thing) and A minor chords, which tells us that it's pretty definitely in A minor, no matter what else may happen.  For example, in the main theme there's a bit that goes C - G - Am - E.  Again, we're all solidly in A minor here.  I think he gets a little crazier in the middle section, but I don't have my sheet music on me right now and it's been a very long time since I've played the piece, so I don't remember.  Beethoven does tend to go off the rails harmonically, though.  It's one of the reasons why he's such a great composer.\n\nNow, there are times when you're going to want to use the *wrong* key signature.  Beethoven definitely didn't do that here.  He wrote a piece in A minor and stuck to A minor, even though he used other notes as well, like the D# (again, the G# is in the key, though not the key signature, since it's in the harmonic and melodic scales).  But if you're writing in, say, A dorian, which has the same notes as G major -- A B C D E F# G (A) -- you *could* use a key signature with F# in it, but I wouldn't.  You know why?  Because A dorian is pretty close to A minor, and I prefer to tell my readers that the tonic chord is A minor.  They can handle the accidentals.  By using the A minor key signature, I'm saying, \"Here, this piece is basically in A minor; I guess it's really A dorian, but hey, close enough!\"  That's because, if I used the key signature with the F#, people might think it was in G major or E minor, and it's not.  I'm basically saying that the scale the piece is using is *based* on A minor.  In this case, it's A minor #6.\n\nBut what if I'm using some other scale and it's weird?  The harmonic scale is an example, but it's officially part of minor so it's not so weird.  The simplest \"weird\" scale I use all the time is the phrygian dominant scale, which goes by many names (including Ahavah Rabbah in Hebrew, freygish in Yiddish, and maqam Hijaz in Arabic).  It's basically a natural minor scale with a b2 and a #3, so A phrygian dominant is A Bb C# D E F G (A).  I *could* use a special key signature with Bb and C#.  I could.  (Sibelius won't let me, but that's another thing.)  In fact, some ethnomusicologists do that, and I find it very hard to read because I'm used to the standard key signatures, like most musicians!  So what do I do?  I use A minor and accidentals.  BUT WAIT, you say, THAT HAS A C#, SO SHOULDN'T IT BE A MAJOR?  Ehh.  Kinda.  I mean, sure.  It *could* be A major with b2 b6 b7.  But I think that, *even though* it has a C#, the scale is more like A minor than A major.  So I use the A minor key signature.  When you're reading my music in this scale, you see the key signature I picked and think, \"aha, this is in A minor\", and then you look at the notes and revise your thought to say, \"actually, it's in A phrygian dominant\".  But first you think A minor, and that's what I'm trying to get you to do by using that key signature.\n\nMake sense?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422008731", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_%28music%29\n\nSo I'm guessing you're trying to do a truck gear modulation, which isn't actually a modulation, right?  Just go up a half step.  That's it.\n\nIf you want to actually do a modulation, you'll need common chords or common tones.  In that case, it might be easier to go up a whole step -- C - A7 - D, but you can go up a half step by doing C - Ab7 - Db.  Just be careful with your voicing and make sure there's a clear connection from one chord to the next.  If you're doing C - A7 - D, for example, you could do C E G C to A E G C# to D F# A D (this isn't perfect voice leading, but on piano it doesn't have to be; if you're scoring for individual voices, then you'll need to have each voice behave appropriately).  If you're doing C - Ab7 - Db, then C E G C to Ab Eb Gb C to Db F Ab Db.  The top voice is moving chromatically in both cases here, and you need that.\n\nYou can also go crazy and do whatever you want.  One of my favorite final-chorus modulation was a common tone modulation from Eb major to B major.  Glorious shit.  The verse ends D D Eb, and the chorus begins G Ab Bb Eb.  So I ended the verse D D Eb like normal, but instead of starting the chorus on G, I started it on the Eb I was already on (respelled as D# to not kill my singers): D# E F# B.  There, I was in B!\n\nMy next favorite is actually in the *middle* of the first chorus.  In Bm, the notes in that section go B C# D E B, but I did B C# D E F.  With clever orchestration and chords, I managed a modulation -- an actual modulation, not just a key change -- from Bm up a *tritone* to Fm.  And the best part is that if you aren't paying close attention, you won't even notice that it happened!  The chords under the B C# D E are kinda weird, so you lose your sense of key.  That's still not enough, though, because you'd be able to tell from the melody -- but I wrote that melody for two soloists in harmony, and one of them has the melody during the B C# D E, but the *other* one has it for the F.  You feel a change, certainly, because there were some weird chords and now we're solidly back on the tonic, and now the other soloist has the melody.  Hidden under this?  A HUGE-ASS key change that you don't even realize happened.\n\nSo basically, how do you pick the key to go to?

I learned the open C Major scale a while back so that's how I knew to play it, and when I was learning modes I couldn't figure out how it fit into anything until I realized it was basically just E Phrygian with open strings. \n\nIt's great that you picked up on that so quick though, once you do this stuff enough it becomes second nature.\n\nWhile you're at it, I'd recommend memorizing these patterns too:\n\n[5 Pentatonic Scale Patterns](http://home.comcast.net/~playyourguitar/jpegs/The%20Five%20Boxes.jpg)\n\n**Ignore all of the numbers on that picture, just look at the patterns**\n\nI personally disagree with their choice of which finger hits which fret (the number in the circle) but ultimately it's personal preference as long as you get the patterns down (these work just like the modal patterns, they're generic and don't refer to one part of the fretboard as they can be--and do--move all around depending on what key you're in).\n\n\nSo the left most string is low E, right most is high E. \n\nThe way a pentatonic scale works is pretty simple. It's called \"penta tonic\" because it contains 5 tones (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) from the scale of whatever key you're in.\n\nC Major example: (1)C (2)D (3)E (4)F (5)G (6)A (7)B\n\nTherefore, C Major pentatonic is comprised of C D E G A. \n\nI'm sure you can figure it out for G major, so you tell me what the notes would be in the G Major pentatonic scale. \n\nPenta tonic scales are fun to use when improvising because it breaks up the \"structured\" step-wise sound of just ascending and descending a full scale. \n\nSo take a look at those, see if you can figure out what notes are in G Major penta tonic, and then I'll tell you more about how to actually figure out where each position goes in each key. \n\nedit: It also helps when learning these patterns if you give each one some sort of goofy memorable name, that way it sticks out in your head more. These *also* always go in a strict order (just like the modal patterns) so if you figure out the position of one of them in a key, it makes it much easier to know which come after it and which comes before it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422042309", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The two previously mentioned shortcuts take priorty.  This shortcut is ideal for raiding with multiple armies as a viking.  (v selects armies, right click all onto a county, press v, right click onto another county, repeat.)\nv will create a new vassal from the holding screen of minor owned baronies\n\nb merges selected levies or ships, so long as they are in the same zone or province (naturally.)  If you have a single army/shipgroup the \"b\" key will open the new unit interface (ship/army rebalancing)\nb also sends units to the right side of an army or ship balancing screen, each press sends the bottom listed unit right.  press and hold for rapid rebalancing\nb will go to the next holding in demesne\nb is also back button for the main interfaces\n\nn selects the trade port screen on coastal provinces\n\nm selects the normal holdings screen \n\nl toggles looter status for pagan armies\n\n, opens the ledger, and closes the ledger\n\n. opens the find characters interface, and also closes it\n\n/ opens the find title interface\n\n################################################################################\nTo manually alter keybindings, download notepad++ from www.ninite.com and install\nuse notepad++ to 'search in files', select the mod folder as the directory\nsearch for: Shortcut = \"\n(leave the quotations open)\nthis will pull up all the shortcuts listed in the mod files.\ndoubleclick on the bottom of the screen through each of the results until you see the \"guiButtonType =\t{\" that looks like what you want.\nyou can alter or remove any of the options that say \"shortcut = \"x\"\" to your liking\nThere is some trial and error to this if you are not experienced with the layout of the game files.  Just play with it, you'll figure it out.\n################################################################################\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n6-19-2013\nOverhaul changes.  Discovered that keybound event decisions cause the engine to fire the wrong event options.  Removed 1-2-3-4, and consolidated keybinds to z x c v b.  Attempting for a 'qwerty' style using available bottom row.  Lots of multi-use buttons, but no incompatibility issues.  Play with it for a few minutes and it will feel natural, sorry for the big shift.\nAdded instructions to manually edit keybinds.\n\n6-9-2013\nadded z key to confirm decisions on the diplomatic screen.  Only works if the \"Send\" button is activatable.  Use caution unless you are certain of what you want to do.\nadded \",\" ledger keybind.  toggleable.  When buildings screen is selected this keybind will not function.  (Overridden by \"previous holding in demense\" button.)\nadded \".\" find character keybind.  toggleable.  When buildings screen is selected this keybind will not function.  (Overridden by \"next holding in demense\" button.)\nadded \"/\" find title keybind.  \n\n6-4-2013\nadded z key and b key army rebalancing.  while selecting the 'balance ships' or 'balance army' screen, z will send the bottom most visible unit on the right side to the left, and b will send the bottom most visible unit to the right.\n\n6-3-2013\nAdded v key: close one army at a time while having multiple armies selected. This shortcut is ideal for raiding with multiple armies as a viking.  (v selects armies, right click all onto a county, press v, right click onto another county, repeat.)\n\n5-29-2013\nAdded \"z\" to toggle siege interface while selecting a province or army in an enemy province.  In situations of a hostile siege in your land, the Toggle Siege interface overrides the raise levy shortcut, requiring a manual click.  Since the times where you would WANT to raise an army with 0 morale against a hostile siege is very rare, this additional shortcut actually helps prevent mistakes from being made.  \nAdded \"v\" to select all armies in boats if a single ship stack is selected.  If multiple ship stacks are selected, \"v\" will select all of the last listed armies.\nAdded \"c\" to toggle looter status while an army is selected.  This shortcut only works when you have a single army selected.  Does not work when you have an army currently raiding a county (Siege interface), but CAN disable looting while you are at sea or travelling from one county to another.  Be careful you don't accidentally disable your looter status, requiring a trip home to re-enable.\n\nThese keybinds should not conflict with any of the existing keybinds (except those mentioned here) since they function on seperate screens.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422057122", "subreddit": "arumba07", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You should look up [iCEMANnoob](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbG8pgMt--16TfHzOjNdsMA), he's my absolute favorite MH streamer/YTer. The guys he plays with are awesome too, RFG, Raikou,  Iso (I think that's what they call him, his char name is L E I G H), and Rebel. They're so much fun to watch, cause they joke around during every hunt, and basically just have a good time. \n\nAs for ProJared, I watched his 3U video, and I was kinda disappointed. He spent 10 minutes talking about how breathtakingly amazing the game is, and didn't say a single negative thing about it, so I was expecting a 9/10 or 10/10 review, but he gave it an 8. It's kind of a small thing to complain about, but I don't get how he can basically say a game is the best thing he's ever played, and not say a single negative thing about it, and then dock it two points. I watched the review before I bought my 3ds (ultimately it was one of the deciding factors, so I'm appreciative of that lol), but it would have been nice to hear why he decided to give it an 8 instead of a 9 or 10. \n\nI might give him another shot if he keeps putting out MH content though. Love watching people play this game haha. \n\nOh! Check out [Gaming Bliss](https://www.youtube.com/user/MonsterHunterSketch) too! He has two lets plays up for freedom unite and 3U, and hopefully when 4U comes out he'll start another series of that.

{"body": "As the *Crimson Phlanx* prepared its systems for idle mode, the crew begin making their preparations for a several month slumber. Trips to Mars were common place now. This was the sixteenth mission to the red planet and the third and final scouting mission before terraforming was to begin.\n\nOne by one, the crew prepared to enter their pods. Several were reclined watching holopads, the same way a terrestrial would procrastinate their bedtime. Real time video communication was not possible due to the massive 9 light-minute ping time, however the crew were still able to exchange video messages with Earth.\n\nCommander Stevenson had just received a final goodbye from his wife as he turned off the holopad. She was chuckling after seeing him dressed in the Star Trek costume she bought him for the journey. Stevenson was a lifelong fan of the series. In a place where first world comforts had little value, he could not have asked for a better gift. Smiling, he placed the holopad in his locker and began typing on his stasis pod keypad.\n\n The stasis pods functioned by enclosing the crew member in an airtight container and freezing them to absolute zero instantly with a cryonic gas. Normally, freezing would kill vital cells before the organism could be frozen solid. In stasis pods, the gas worked so quickly that perfect preservation was possible, provided the chamber remained intact. When the crewmember was scheduled to thaw, a second gas would be injected into the chamber to instantly reverse the effects of the first.\n\nStasis had become somewhat of a necessity, even on short intrasolar trips. With the number of crew members on board, space and weight were precious commodities. It was far more efficient to suspend the crew for the journey versus feeding and bathing them for several months.\n\nHe finished punching the codes into the pod’s keypad and laid down inside. The chamber closed around him and descended into the floor, concealing its existence once it was locked into place.\n\nStevenson stirred awake as the pod rose above the floor and released him from his cocoon. To his surprise, the ship was pitch black. There was a faint bluish, white glow throughout the cabin, radiating from the ships bay windows. Shivering, Stevenson trudged toward the cockpit. \n\nAs he got closer, he realized it too was dark. Absolutely none of the ships electronics or systems were working. Everything was dead. Stevenson turned around and ran to the ship lavatory. He felt around the familiar room until reaching the smooth glass of the mirror. Gripping one fist with the other, he twisted around like a baseball player and unleashed his doublefist against the glass with full force.\nThe glass shattered, dazzling the cabin with reflected light as it hit the floor.\n\nStevenson picked up the largest surviving chunk of the mirror and ran back to the cockpit. He leaned in towards the instrument panel, fiddling with the shard until it picked up some of the faint light. Carefully, he adjusted it until the panel was illuminated.\n\nThe display glowed green as the reflected beam exposed its translucent layers.\n\nStevenson’s heart stopped as the light revealed what appeared to be monochrome smudges in the upper right corner.\n\n\n“S I R I U S” The text spelled out. \n\nPart of him wanted to believe he was looking at the ships satellite radio tuner, but he knew the truth; he was over eight light years from home.\n\nBeginning to heave and sob, he peered out the cockpit windshield at the brilliant star in all its retina piercing glory. Blinded, Stevenson brought his chin to his chest and drug the mirror fragment across his wrists. As he bled out, he took delirious comfort knowing that like his childhood idols, he too had gone where no man had been before.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422070070", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

If you look at Childish Gambino, he refuses to do one thing, which is what makes him different than any other rapper in the game right now; he refuses to stay the same. He changes his style so drastically from project to project that it's almost jarring. Look at his career from beginning to present. Sick Boi/Poindexter he was doing his lil Wayne impression. IAJAR, he used indie songs and toned down the nasal sound. Culdesac changed everything. Real quality production with the punchlines Bino was known for and sweet hooks to show off his pipes. Then we get EP, which is such a short glimpse of what Bino could do. Then BAM he gives you Camp, which makes you say \"Holy shit my emotions hurt\". Such a drastic change in style. Then comes the real kicker: R O Y A L T Y. This blew everyone away because he got most of his first impressions from Camp. And people went, wow this Donald Glover guy can rap. Just when people were starting to understand him and like his music, he throws BTI at you. Which is far too complex for the average listener to fully understand. He has never done the same thing. Because people expect him to do what will make him more popular or gain the most views. But in reality he is just always trying to do something new. He never wants to put out the same thing twice.

{"body": "I'll give a different insight on how to do accumulators and actually **profit** in the **long run** and explain how I like them:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n1. Like /u/kingpomba said this, and it is indeed basic maths. When betting on several non-linked events probabilities to win fall while the odds rise since there will be a really low chance for all the events to happen.\n\n2. Punters make way more money on singles, doubles and triples than accumulators.\n\n3. Likewise the house wins most of the times in those accumulators. It isn't that often everyone sees a big accumulator going down and a huge profit coming in.\n\nNow I'll be talking about multiples where you have 9 folds 9 selections, or other kinds of folds/selections where basically you need to get all the scores to your side.\n\n\nThe big question is **how to increase the chance of winning big accumulators**?\n\n* Let's imagine a situation of a 4 fold. \n\n1. In a 4 fold to cover all possible results of 4 matches you would have to bet on match A 1, match B 1, match C 1, match D 1, match A 1, B 1, C 1, D X, A 1, B 1, C X, D X, on and on until A 2, B 2, C 2, D 2. \n\n2. Betting on all possible scores of a 4 fold would mean betting 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 which gives us 81 bets. For a 5 fold this would be 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 which would give us 243 bets.\n\n3. Logically covering all possible bets wouldn't turn up a profit since your stakes would overcome any margin of win and punters would win all the time breaking the house.\n\n* How to increase the odds then?\n\n1. Pick 4 games, where there's a clear favorite but the odds are over 1.5, anything below won't make sense betting, for today a good example would be Cambuur vs PSV. PSV is clearly the favorite, they're playing away and the odds on Betfair are @1.6 for a PSV win. A good example of a bad pick would be going with Córdoba vs Real Madrid where the odds for Real Madrid to win are at 1.16. This kind of odds don't give any return because the value spent to cover them will surpass the potential return of the win.\n\n\n2. From those 4 games, if the odds are favorable the next step is to make the following bet: Bet on favorite, bet on draw. **On every game.**\n\n**Math time:**\n\n* In a 4Fold betting on favorites + draw covering a possible upset will mean you'll have to place **16** (2 * 2 * 2 * 2) bets, instead of **81**. You're now covering match A 1, match B 1, match C 1, match D 1, match A X, match B 1, match C 1, match D 1, on and on until all matches A B C D are X.\n\n* In a 5 fold, instead of covering all possible results with **243** bets you only have to cover all possible wins/draws towards the favorite, to a mere **32** bets (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2).\n\n**How does this increase your profits &amp; profit chance?**\n\n1. First, obviously if a favorite loses instead of winning or drawing you're out of the game. Yet, check for scores of the Portuguese Liga, Eredivisie, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Bundesliga and you'll see that most of the times when a favorite is playing a weaker side and doesn't win the biggest outcome followed by that is the draw.\n\n2. Each time a favorite draws in a multiple your profits are way bigger since the draw is priced largely at way higher odds than the win of that said favorite. Again with Cambuur vs PSV from today, if PSV draws with Cambuur not only you have that bet covered the bet is also priced @4.4 instead of @1.6 with PSV winning. Which means your accumulator where you have Cambuur vs PSV to draw you have a return that is way higher than the one where PSV wins against Cambuur.\n\n**Truly Important - It is only possible to succeed at this type of covering when the favorites are priced at over 1.5, otherwise your stakes will easily surpass the profits**\n\nLastly, this is way harder to do with big accumulators, not only the matches are harder to find, but also because the number of bets to make covering all possible draws and favorite wins grow exponentially. \n\n4Fold - 16 bets to cover.\n\n5Fold - 32 bets to cover.\n\n6Fold - 64 bets to cover.\n\n7Fold - 128bets to cover.\n\nOn and on..\n\n\nWhen casual betting a few cents I like accumulators since you have that small chance of hitting the jackpot and I do several of them for fun. \n\nHowever accumulators can also be used to profit if bet covering is done correctly.\n\n\n**TL-DR - How to cover accumulators and how to increase accumulators chance of profit**\n\nEdit: Corrected some typos.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422092094", "subreddit": "SoccerBetting", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK, so having had a look at the inscription it does look fake to me. The first indicator of that is the use of latin numerals.

A quick non-exhaustive search of the runic database and relevant literature supports this. While this doesn't disqualify the inscription at the outset it makes it extremely unlikely it is genuine.\n\nThe inscription transliterates to something like \n\n    t s n m f r x(?) th  MCCVI\n\nwith the x being the Latin form of the letter, not runic (which doesn't exist anyway). \n\nThe MCCVI obviously means the latin number/year 1206. The rest of the inscription doesn't make any sense in Old Norse or Latin so it will be interesting what the show makes of it. I certainly don't see any connection to templars. \n\nI can't really say anything on the iconography right now since I have to leave but to me it looks like a style-copy of a real inscription with the runes changed to the carver's own text which doesn't make any sense, though, except for establishing Nordic presence in Pennsylvania in the year 1206, presumably the goal of the carving.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422102200", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This game works fine with Oculus Rift DK2 and VorpX, no additional settings needed, really, just launch VorpX config utility - I do not rely on it's OR Config profile importer, just headtracking enabled and tilt/roll enabled in VorpX config.  After tinkering a bit, I found setting FPS limit in-game to 60 works, and hitting Delete to bring up VorpX configurator, changing Display &gt; vignette scaling and image scaling to what works best for you, hit \"C\" in-game a few times to get camera inside the car itself. If you find your vision is locked in place (happens once in a while during playing) try hitting A W S D to change camera while moving the mouse around until you start seeing your headtracking work (sometimes pressing middle mouse button a few times helps, too, it's weird), then just align back to center using mouse only and you're golden. Another tip with headtracking, you have a limit on up/down motion, if you find your vertical alignment is off-center, simply move your head far down/up to jostle the alignment back in place, and use mouse for left-right alignment. I find I have to press middle mouse button to zoom out VorpX when minimap is needed, or main map / other events like movies happen, so VorpX is zoomed all the way out.  I'm using latest version of VorpX - if encountering errors/crashing/something, I suggest reinstall through your web installer if you still have it, if not contact VorpX support to redownload / etc.  As of right now I haven't figured out how to prevent the drivers head from forcing you to look left when turning left / right when turning right, or bobbing / pulling back when hitting nitro / changing gears, this would be a nice-to-have from Ubisoft but if not possible it's livable by simply keeping your head straight or turning it yourself, into turns, to counter the forced motion.  Only other thing I would recommend is change the IPD until you're comfortable, I'm not sure why VorpX doesn't legitimately work with the OR detected IPD, just be careful with it. I'm using default IPD, no motion sickness, was able to play for hours without any issues. Another thing I noticed is that it's not very realistic/perception is a little warped, your distance perception will feel bland, graphics are still kinda crappy likely no thanks to DK2's shitty resolution, and headtracking can be a little delayed - as I said, don't let your head loll around too much and you're fine.  The 3D is worth shit, just as a warning, you're basically looking more at a 2D screen with headtracking, if you want more realistic 3D perhaps Tridef 3D can help, not sure, but I will say it's fantastic for broadcasting to things like twitch.tv in 2D", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422133622", "subreddit": "oculus", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Who the fuck would respect you? Does anyone not care about their family, honor, reputation nowadays? Is the US that fucked up?\n\nYall  need to raise your standards.

What Man worth a damn can even get hard knowing a girl is a promiscuous, emotionally broken whore (likely with a ton of tats, piercings and masculine tendencies) who would literally fuck anything that hollered at it? Regardless of how \"hot\" she looks, and regardless of condom use, how can any Man worth a damn ignore all that shit and get hard?\n\nSlut-shaming keeps women, and thus the country in check. A country is only as good as its women.

You're in C major, and you know you're in C major, so you're waiting for that resolution.  If you had played B locrian instead, there'd be no need for resolution, because B is already the tonic.

As jungle bs you don't need regen at all 1 shared tango its more than enough. Qblade and stout shield are needed. Getting first bounty rune helps a lot. Jungle be need to start with q, I usually go for q e e q e r w e. I max thirst 1st it gives lots of dmg and ms early on, 2 points in q are needed for 100% uptime then I go for silence. I don't like to go for silence pre lvl6 lvl 1 is weak and be might have problems to sustain with mana. At lvl 6 you can gank go back to jungle for 60 seconds and go gank again. You don't need many dmg items since thirst with bloodrage gives more dmg than u need. I like to go for sny after blademail, rarely euls or drums or bkb if needed. I like hot as core item with blademail and bloodrage if someone targets you he will lose HP rapidly while you have enough HP pool to sustain it and you can heal up fast by killing stuff. Later or abysall is great item to cancel tps. Btw early on if you gank but got nothing to stop enemy from going its ok. Rapture and to got same cool down if your enemy come back after minute just repeat. You won't kill him but he's losing time and gold while ur farming and only thing u lost is some mana. Do it 3 times in row to enemy antimage it will slow down him a lot even if he is not dying.\n\nOne tip. Do not pick bs when they got bounty hunter. That hero will rekt you early on. He will harass you if u try to farm, you cannot kill him nor stop from following you, he will takes 1/2 exp if u somehow manage to kill a creep with him walking around.

Ótimos, mas caros e, dependendo do seu uso, desnecessários.\n\nSe você não exigir tanto do seu celular, indico o Moto G.

{"body": "Lets talk about DNA and RNA.  They are far more than just a sequence of letters.  Each of these letters, A T C G U is a unique molecule. With that comes a unique shape. The laws of chemistry influence how this shape interacts with other molecules. Thus there is more than just a pattern of information going on here. there is also a pattern of shapes, each unique. These shapes get physically interacted with by other molecules and molecular machinery.  Therefore the order of nucletides is more than just random, it is partially dictated by the laws of chemistry, by how things just naturally interact.\n\nIn DNA you occasionnally get sequences of repeating AAAAAAAA, why, cause its used to attach a specific piece of a machinery to that spot of the DNA. This piece of machinery has a shape that physically interacts with AAAAAAAA like a round peg fitting into a round hole.  The DNA incapabile of getting a round peg to fit into a round hole fails to copy itself well enough and eventually that DNA pattern ceases to exist, only the DNA patterns able to pull this off continued to replicate at a rate that enabled them to continue to exist.\n\nAUG is more than just any random combo. Its the start codon. AUG is the only shape that matches the tRNA shape that carries Methionine. The Amino acid that comes first in every chain. Why does this particularly shaped amino acid always come first and not other, i don't personally know, but its shape probably enables protein folding to begin.\n\nHowever, being a system based upon shapes interacting with each other, its possible to cheat. Sometimes you can squeeze the round peg through the square hole. Which is why more than one codon will code for the same amino acid.  This vastly reduces most probablity calculations because a one letter difference between patterns can result in the exact same protein.  Heck almost all of the third letters in a codons can be different and you still get the same result.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422239271", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sure I can give you the basics (as that's sort of the extent of my knowledge with chords as well). \n\nA chord is made up of: \n\n1.  Root\n2.  Third\n3.  Fifth \n\nAka, if we take C Major scale: C D E F G A\n\nC Major chord = C E G (the root (C), the third (E), the fifth (G)). \n\nSo if you fret C, E, and G, anywhere on the fretboard and just play those 3 notes, you're playing a C major chord. \n\nIf you ever hear the term \"power chord,\" which I'm sure you have, it means a chord that is just the Root and the Fifth (no third). And when thinking of chords, don't think in terms of the \"number\" of notes, just think about which notes actually make up the chord. \n\nExample: A C major power chord could be played by fretting just two notes (C on the low E, G on the A string), or theoretically if you could hit every C and G across all 6 strings (and only C and G) and play it, that is still considered a power chord, because the only notes it consists of is C and G.\n\nThe two main chord progressions are the \"major\" and \"minor\" progressions, and they go like this:\n\n**Major Progression**\n\n1. Major\n\n2. Minor\n\n3. Minor\n\n4. Major\n\n5. Major\n\n6. Minor\n\n7. Diminished\n\n**Minor Progression:**\n\n1. Minor\n\n2. Diminished\n\n3. Major\n\n4. Minor\n\n5. Minor\n\n6. Major\n\n7. Major\n\nDefinitions:\n\n**Major Chord** - essentially if you write out the key you're in (C D E F G A for C Major, etc), and pick the root, the 3rd, and the 5th, that's a major chord. Example:\n\nC Major Chord: C E G\n\n**Minor Chord** - Has a lowered 3rd (flat 3rd). Example:\n\nC Minor Chord: C Eb G\n\n**Diminished Chord** - Has a lowered 3rd and lowered 5th. Example:\n\nC Diminished: C Eb Gb \n\nThe progressions above are very straightforward. If you want to play a C Major chord progression, you match up \"C\" with \"1\" and then each corresponding note to the next chord type down the line. For example, a C Major progression:\n\nC Major chord progression:\n\n1. C Major\n\n2. D Minor\n\n3. E Minor\n\n4. F Major\n\n5. G Major\n\n6. A Minor\n\n7. B Diminished\n\nA Minor Chord Progression:\n\n1. A Minor\n\n2. B Diminished\n\n3. C Major\n\n4. D Minor\n\n5. E Minor\n\n6. F Major\n\n7. G Major\n\nSo they work just like that. If you know your barre chord shapes, you can easily play progressions like these. But in reality, you can play each chord however you want as long as the chord is correct. For example, you could start playing a C Major barre chord, then play a D minor open chord and back to a E minor barre chord in a C major progression because a barre and an open chord are the same chord just in different forms (for the same root note of course).\n\nThat's the basics of chord construction and progressions, do you understand the terms and stuff?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422248487", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

But keeping to to diatonic rules of your key/mode.\n\nBut with harmony if you really want to get good at it, learn as much as you can about voice leading and 4 part harmonization.\n\nAs far as melodies are concerned, alot of my melodies mostly start out as short, pretty monotone things. And then while humming/singing/playing them i add notes/trills/bends or you know, there is always easy things like, copy and pasting your currently melody and then bump the repeat up a semitone or two, or you can reverse the melody and see if that gives you anything new OR the best one i think is to break say a 4/4 melody down into \"Cells\" so bar 1 would be A B C D and then mix and match those cells. You might find your 3rd bar could work out to be just C C A B, generally this is refereed to as cyclic permutation, its a really fast way to \"generate\" content. And definitely don't be afraid to move between modes and keys, like you could have a really nice melody in C major, but the 3rd bar of your melody is lacking, why not change the melody into Lydian for a bar, which the F would become an F#.

{"body": "Anivia main here.  So I have to agree with what most people are saying about Anivia.  Great staller, weak laner unless you know what you're doing.  In my opinion, Anivia is the most mana hungry champion in the game.  Strong lategame.  \n\nThe better I became with Anivia, the more I learned just how game changing well placed walls are.  It's what separates good anivias from the great ones.  A good wall will turn a lost fight into a won fight.  The wall is what makes or breaks the champion in close games.  It can be used to split the front line from the back line, block off blue/red buff entrances for a safe baron/dragon, pick off an enemy, and (my personal favorite) creep block the minion wave so that they have to path around the wall and die in your ultimate before the enemy team can hit your tower.\n\nAnivia has insanely high base damages.  Because of this and the existence of Archangel's staff, she is the most viable midlaner for unconventional mage builds.  If you have a seraph's embrace, any mana item is viable on Anivia.  Her mana issues also give you the option of large mana pool with no cdr via tear and/or rod of ages, heavy mana regen and cdr via athene's and morello's evil tome, or a mix of both.  \n\nAs far as playstyle, I like to run cdr per level blues on Anivia against weaker matchups or against AD assassins.  21/0/9 as usual.  I take teleport against lanes like Leblanc or Talon or anyone who can bully the hell out of me.  If I think I have a shot at getting a kill early with jungle help or if I'm just feeling confident in general, I'll take ignite.  \nHer skill order is Q E E W then max E then max Q then max W with points in R at 6/11/16.  She has very high mana costs and has slow moving abilities and the slowest base movement speed in the game.  I still prefer a dorans ring start because I like the extra AP early but flask is perfectly acceptable too.  I play very defensively until I hit level 6.  600 auto attack range helps with this a lot.  My goals as Anivia pre-6 in order are 1) Stay in experience range 2) don't take damage 3) always have at least half my mana pool 4) get cs 5) harrass the enemy.  This is very different from most midlaners in the game because trading/harrassing is my last priority.  Once I'm at level 6, I usually push the wave with only my ultimate and I recall for my first mana/regen item.  Once my mana pool grows a bit and I'm level 6, I'll start trading more by dropping my ult under the enemy champion and using e while they're chilled.  If the enemy laner roams and I don't have teleport, I'll spam ping the mia to let my team know and proceed to take the mid turret because Anivia is one of the best pushers in the game.  If I do have TP, I'll TP countergank.\n\nIn teamfights, I stay in the back line and peel for my adc/kill the front line.  Anivia's power is primarily in her ultimate.  Once it goes on cooldown, you're out of commision for about 7 seconds.  For this reason, you need to hit as many champions as you can with your ultimate and kill the biggest threat to your team's carries.  Don't forget that on top of being a movement speed slow, Anivia's ultimate is also an attack speed slow.  Save your Q in fights for self peel or protecting the ADC.  Anivia is a very safe champion if you take advantage of her kit so you will deal a lot of damage unless the fight ends after 1 spell rotation.  \n\nHope this helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422285512", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The natural notes came before the sharps and flats, and already had their present pattern. But with only 7 notes, you can only play in modes made up of those 7 notes. For example, you can't play in F major if you have only the notes A B C D E F G, because F to B is a tritone and not a perfect fourth. You need to lower (i.e. flatten) B by some amount if you want to play in F major rather than what we now call the F lydian mode. That's the case whether or not you tune in modern equal temperament. With modern tuning, that amount is the same as the distance between E and F, so E# is the same pitch as F.\n\nThe natural question to ask now is why E# is actually considered a legitimate note, if we could just write F instead. Couldn't E# just be declared illegal? The answer is that back when all this was occurring, they tuned in such a way that the distance from E to F wasn't the same as the distance a sharp or flat moved you (sharps and flats moved you the same distance in opposite directions). E# was only *close to* F. Close enough that in a sense they were equivalent, but in another, more real sense you'd be out of tune if you played the wrong one.\n\nThese days we've stopped building keyboards with more than 12 notes to the octave, but it's still a relevant issue for performers on other instruments.

{"body": "Secondly - and this is the secretest most brilliant of the mastering tools - is 'mid-side' processing. Most audio tracks, especially music, are stereo. That means we've got a Left and a Right channel, so one comes out of each speaker respectively. Through application of phase inversion (I won't go into this here, let me know if you want me to cover phase in a separate post) it's possible to encode that stereo signal into a 'Middle' signal and a 'Side' signal instead. In short, it cancels out the difference between the L+R signals variously to effectively leave you with everything that has been panned (sent to one speaker or the other) in a 'Side' signal, and everything left bang in the middle on a 'Mid' signal. Part of the mastering engineer's job is also to monitor and manipulate stereo width to help bring more space and control to the material.\n\nTo expand on that: bass generally goes down the centre, because often it's reproduced through a subwoofer in a substantial-enough system, and the main speakers on either side will often not produce as much power in the bass range. This is just convention, and isn't always the case if someone's going avant-garde on your ass but usually you'll find the bass drum and bass instruments remain in the centre. Instruments like piano or strings might be panned to the sides, creating a wider stereo field. Mid-side processing allows you not only to adjust the volume of everything in the middle and the side independently (making it feel much W I D E R or much &gt;narrower&lt;) but also to apply all the processes discussed above (EQ, dynamics etc) to those signals by themselves as well. If you want more treble in the side channel to give the track more..hmm..'shine' or 'sparkle' or whatever you want to term it as well as more width, you can EQ it like that. If you want to crank up the bass in the mid to get that kick going, but you don't want to over-fuzz the sides, then you can compress mid and leave the side alone.\n\nAll of this in combination allows the engineer to very deeply affect the experience of listening to the piece of music they were originally delivered in mix form. If you didn't listen to the mix and the final master right next to each other on the same system, you may not notice the difference..but it's crucial for release and especially for radio broadcasts as they want to create the loudest possible signal WITHOUT overstepping their allocated bandwidth - there can be some heavy fines for encroaching on someone else's station by running your broadcast too hot, so having it mastered and compressed tightly and limited heavily is necessary to achieve these goals. This competition with one another between stations (understanding that basically louder is better for attracting attention and selling records) as well as between jukeboxes and iPods all around the world is part of the cause of the loudness war. (See further reading)\n\n-----\n\nThe final job of a mastering engineer is, of course, to deliver the material! Now this might sometimes be a case of just printing a CD and sending it off to the manufacturing plant, but often this process requires many very tedious jobs such as aligning the tracks together to form the full play-time of the album as well as tweaking the 'top and tail' of each track to make sure they flow smoothly as one continuum. Most tedious of all is the meticulous error-checking and all that fluff. Like with phase, I won't go into the detail but generally a mastering engineer will have some very boring elements of the job to do including at this delivery stage (making sure what the client receives is EXACTLY what was sent, down to the last bit) and very carefully logging every single alteration they made to the track so that in the fairly likely event that a change needs to be made, they can recall all of the settings for any hardware and software they were using to make said correction without starting over. It's also necessary at this stage to apply features to a release such as ISRC (International Standard Recording Code) which identifies individual recordings, as well as compiling a Table of Contents (which more technically is actually a listing of the start and end points of each track) and other data to make the CD universally playable and readable. Think of this as an advanced version of the finalisation process you apply to a CD when you're fully done burning it from your PC, with some extra legal bits thrown in. (See further reading)\n\nThe mastering engineer as an entity first became a thing during the vinyl era when really his job was as a 'transfer engineer'. He would take down the sound and cut it to vinyl, but here's the thing - vinyl grooves can only get so wide before they cut through into each other and causes a skip in the record. This means some dynamic control has to be applied on the part of the transfer engineer to make sure you get a good, clean optimal cut. You can extrapolate how the mastering process evolved from there through the advent of magnetic tape storage, CDs, in-the-box digital and beyond. Every format has a limit. (See further reading.)\n\nDepending on the job, the engineer may also be tasked with producing a master for several different formats and destinations. There could be a radio master, a CD master, a vinyl master, a 5.1 surround master, a cinema master, a bandcamp/soundcloud or mp3 master ad infinitum. This is where the money is.\n\n-----\n\nIt's super-late here but I couldn't pass up this question so I'm gonna call it here.

{"body": "A scale is a group of notes in a certain pattern. A major scale goes WWhWWWh, where W is a whole step and h is a half step. \r\rA key tells you what notes you will be playing. In the key of C Major, you will mostly be using  C D E F G A B.\r\r\rIn regards to borrowed tones, most commonly you will see a raised 4th. This works in secondary dominant chords. For example, a common chord progression would be:\r\rI - IV - V or V7 - I\r\ror in C Major:\r\rCmaj - Fmaj - Gmaj or Gmaj7 - Cmaj\r\rThe V tends to want to resolve to the I, that's just how Western harmony works. This is because of the third of the V chord, in this case Gmaj or Gmaj7, is the 7th scale degree, or leading tone, of the scale. In the key of C Major, the leading tone is B. This note is closer to the root than any other note in the scale. \r\rThere is a physics-related explanation (having to do with sound waves and overtones) for why our major scales work. They are all based on the overtone series for the root. Since the group of note in C Major are based on and derived from the note C, naturally they tend to lead to resolve back to C. The leading tone is the closest you can get to the root, and the tension just strengthens the resolution and allows for it to be anticipated.\r\rSo the most common \"borrowed\" note is a raised 4th. This is because we can easily change one note for one chord and help strengthen the resolution. Here is an example:\r\rI - V7/V - V or V7 - I\r\ror in the key of C Major\r\rCmaj - Dmaj7 - Gmaj or Gmaj7 - Cmaj\r\rThe note that we change to create a Dmaj7 chord is F, which becomes F#. F# is the leading tone in G Major. Coincidentally, D is the 5th in the key of G Major. So for that one measure of Dmaj7, we are taking a small trip through the key of G Major in order to keep the harmonic progression moving forward to the final resolution of the Cmaj chord. The Dmaj7 leads to Gmaj, which leads back to Cmaj, due to leading tones and the relationship between V chords and I chords. The Dmaj7 is notated as a V7/V (five-seven of five).\r\rOther common borrowed notes would be a raised 6th and a raised root. For example, sticking in the key of C Major:\r\rI - V7/vii* - vii* - I\r\rOr\r\rCmaj - F#maj7 - Bdim - Cmaj\r\rThe F#maj7 functions as a V of B, the vii* chord in the key of C Major. The F#maj chord tones are F#, A#, and C#. In relation to C Major, these are a raised 4th, a raised 6th, and a raised root, respectively. This V/vii* has the same purpose or effect as a V/V by pushing the harmonic progression forward.\r\rThis is a lot of information and it is 1am here. If anybody has any questions, please ask!

{"body": "Ok. So, generally speaking,  any time you are playing something on guitar from a tab or whatever (melody or chords) it is based on a particular scale. That is, scales aren't really separate from any other part of music. They are just a collection of notes with one particlar note representing \"home\", so to speak.  They are our way of talking about and representing  and organizing the relationships between certain pitches.\n\nSo if you play this (note that it's the sound of *do ra me*...):\n\n\\----------------------  \n------------------0-1  \n------------0-2-----  \n-----0-2-3----------   \n-3-------------------  \n\\----------------------\n\nThat's a C major scale played in order (C D E F G A B C). The first and last notes are both C, with the last being an octave (as in the 8th note) higher. So, in general, scales have 7 notes that repeat in both directions.  Also, because of the nature of how guitar is set up, you can find this exact collection of notes elswhere on the guitar and in different octaves at a few places. That's why you have all those diagrams with dots all over the neck - different places the same scale appears.\n\nTry this: play that scale an octave higher just using your B string. Here is a tab:\n\n-1-3-5-6-8-10-12-13\n\nTake note of the pattern, where you move up 1 or 2 frets:\n\n2,2,1,2,2,2,1\n\nThat's the structure of a major scale. Find a note and repeat the pattern to play the major scale in that key (or keep the pattern and sound in mind and make use of those same notes where they are on different strings so you can play it more efficiently).\n\nAnyway, in any scale, each of these 7 notes have a different feel to them when played over particular chords or in a particular context. For example, play a  C chord followed by the open B string.  It sounds tense.  Then play the 1st fret on that string...resolution. You can do the same thing on the second fret of the A string followed by the third fret to hear the difference (but same *feel*) when playing an octave lower.\n\nThese notes also have different roles in different contexts.  For example, when playing a C chord, you are playing the notes C, E, and G, or the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the scale (3rd fret A string, 2nd fret D string, open G string).  To find *other* chords in the key of C, you just have to pick another note and play 2 or 3 of every other note that follows. Like this:\n\nC **D** E **F** G **A** B\n\nThat gets you a Dm chord, which is in the key of C. You can find the notes here:\n\n\\---------   \n\\---------  \n------2-  \n-0-3---   \n\\---------  \n\\---------\n\nThough you can't play them all together here, due to the instrument's limitations, those *are* the notes that make up a Dm. Also note that starting on *D*, these notes are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes.\n\nThat's the basic formula for building a common chord: start on any note of a scale, skip one note, use the next. 1,3,5...and 7 for 7th chords (building chords gets more elaborate than this, but this is the basic idea for most chords you use).\n\nWhen practicing scales, you generally repeat the notes in order over and over again until you get a feel for them.  In music, however, you don't need to stick to that order...think of it like writing the alphabet as compared to writing words.  In use, you put them in an order that makes sense to communicate what you want to say.\n\nThat's the idea. So you can take that first tab of the C major scale I posted and repeat it forward and backward until you have it memorized. Then just play around randomly with those notes in a way that sounds good to you.  That's how you use a scale. Certain notes go better in certain contexts,  but that is something your ear can tell you or that you can learn about in more detail later.  You can also try skipping notes and see how the resulting chords sound.\n\nAlso try playing the C scale over a song you know is in the key of C to get a better handle on how the notes sound in context.\n\nThat should give you a start on understanding scales.

For more on hit points, see players handbook.\n\n\nPage 198 Players Handbook states:\n\nM o n s t e r s a n d D e a t h\nMost DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws. Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n\nK n o c k i n g a C r e a t u r e O u t\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points ith a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable. \n\nI myself use the rule that NPC's die at 0 HP, the players agree this is just easiest for everyone. However, if they want to keep one alive, they can just say they want to and it lives, regardless of damage done. I like to play with a rule that is  basically - Intent and Task - for all things, give me your intended action and the task you are going to use to make it happen, I will provide a DC if successful you get your intended action as stated by your task as described, failure = complications.\n\nedit: formatting", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422379478", "subreddit": "dndnext", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I came back 2 months with a Lynn and I asked the same thing. Here's what I've gathered so far from experience, this sub, and the Vindi forums:\n\n* Gear won't really matter until you reach 60 and above. I, myself, was given the redeployment package so I didn't really worry about that. Once you reach 60+, you can wear the Dancing Blade Set or the Black Hammer/Swift combo. Both have good stat boosts, just adjust each according to your budget. As for 70+, I heard Nighthawk is the way to go (which, btw, is really expensive).\n\n* Same goes for weapons. When you reach 60+, aim for either Dancing Blade Glaive or Dreamwalker Glaive. For 70+, go Nighthawk.\n\n* For stats, I'd level SMASH, CRIT, STR, &amp; COMBAT Masteries first. The rest can follow suit, but only when you have the AP to spare.\n\n* For skills, level the survival skill (Thunder Leg) first. This is will be handy when it comes to your first bosses. Little Rat will follow but only when you unlock it a certain level and have the AP to spend.\n\n* For attack skills, get Swift Assassin first. This will unlock your \"stacks\" or Zhen bombs (as I like to call them). Then get Five Finger Death Punch (this will deal TONNES of dmg to bosses) Then get the extended smashes, such as Fishtail Pole/ Iron Machete &amp; Centipede/Iron Gulliotine. Level each per AP amount and char level.\n\n* Tactics: From the 2 months I've been playing her, I label as somewhat of a glass cannon...ish. You can't exactly tank but she does deal A L O T of damage. She takes sometime to get used to due to her playstyle. Look for openings in bosses and make sure to stack those Furious Zhen. Once you unlock the SP smashes (Flying Snow, Long-Arm Devil, etc.), then use them to activate the zhen bombs. \n\nI know this is a lot, but once you get her rolling, she will be one fast and badass glaive-wielding MMO character I have ever seen. I have personally seen relatively low-level Lynns outdamage Arishas and even Vellas. \n\nIf you need help or just wanna hang out, hit me up in East and PM Annerdene or LanaBanana.\n\nHappy Hunting!\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422386590", "subreddit": "Vindictus", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have to do this very often as I'm in a worship band which, most often, does covers of other worship songs.  Here's how I do it.\n(WARNING: Incoming theory)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst, I figure out what key the song is in... typically by playing a little solo over it until I've found all the right notes.  You obviously have to have a decent ear to hear if a note you're playing works or not.  Then, I use the major scale pattern (w w h w w w h) to find out what the root is, and that's the key.\n\n\nOnce I know what key it is, I will also know what chords fit in that key. So, to figure out which chords they are, I listen to the bass notes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, for the key of G, we have: \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7\n:--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:   \nG | Am | Bm | C | D | Em | F#dim\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, if I hear a G bass note, I assume it's a G chord.  If it's not, I think of the chords in that key that would work with a G bass note, e.g. C/G or D/G.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConsidering that the 7dim is rare (but not unheard of) if I hear the 7 as a bass note, I just assume it's the 5/7 (D/F#).  The 3m is less common than the other two minors, so if the 3m doesn't sound right, try the 1/3 (G/B).  The 6 is way more common, but if the 6m just doesn't sound right either, 4/6 (C/E) is also a really common chord.  Once you have experience with it, it gets to be really easy to figure out the chords.\n\nDon't forget all the variations of the chords to get the right sound for each one(e.g. sus2, sus4, maj7, m7, etc.).  But, the key, for me, is the bass note... always the bass note.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCaveat:\nSometimes you'll have a song that jumps in and out of keys or uses chords outside of the main key.  In that case, figure out the ones you can and then use bass notes and your ears to determine if it's a Major or Minor chord to figure out the others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT:\nAs others have mentioned, you can develop the skill pretty well.  So, while I can't necessarily tell you what key a song is in when listening to it, I've gotten to a point I can determine the # of the chord progression as the song goes along.  i.e. They start with the 1, then it goes to 1/3, and then 4, then 5.  The chorus is 6m, 4, 2m.  etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA fun fact that my wife learned while taking her psychology classes in college, is that your ears should be able to tell the difference in notes the same way your eyes can tell the difference in colors.  WTF.  I can't do that yet, but I thought it was pretty interesting to hear that you should.

{"body": "LeBlanc is my most comfortable champion and has been a favourite and most played for a long time, here's my advice.\n\n**Skill order**\n\n\nDo not level a skill until you are in lane, there are times when invading or while being invaded when E is 100% more useful, and there's times where W is more useful in an invade.\n\nLevel W first and max it, followed by Q. Level 3 get E, don't double Q or W as generally the opportunity of having E for a catch at level 3 can secure a kill is worth more than a bit more damage on W. It's also great to disengage ganks, some junglers are tricky to shake off with just W and E'ing them ensures the escape. Level R whenever it's up and E after Q.\n\nAt around 1:25 when you know no one is invading, grab W and W over safely to the enemy buff they start, walk over, ward it, W back. On red side against a Xin for example, I'll stand in the river brush, W, walk, ward, W. Make sure your W is safe to go back to and you don't W into a common spotting brush like the Blue buff spotting brush opening river. This gives time for your W to be off CD when your minions arrive and valuable information for your team.\n\n**Build**\n\n\nI have always enjoyed not building DFG on LeBlanc unless I have to eliminate a super fed squishy fast or split pushing, however DFG is being removed anyway to avoid any DFG builds.\n\nStart Dorans Ring pots(Unless against Kass, get flask then only), and first back get Fiendish Codex, then depending if the enemy is bullying you with magic damage, build either Morellos or Athene's. This is entirely dependant on the laner, not the champion. I could be against an Azir which is a lane bully champion, and build Morellos if he isn't aggressive. You give up AP and Mana regen for Athenes, so it needs to be picked wisely. \n\nI recommend not building Seekers Armguard first item, purely because of play style. LeBlanc is extremely strong against AD, Melee champs with little CC, so you should be Q W'ing them so much more and zoning them for them to even damage you. \n\nThe items after Morellos/Athene's, **100%** situational, there is no set in stone build that works effectively every game. Every game is a different LeBlanc build. \n\nHere's an example: Sorc Shoes is a very good and common 2nd item on LeBlanc, it provides good magic pen and movement speed. However, some games people love picking Lissandra against LeBlanc, her biggest weakness. Some like picking Annie, some like picking other easy hard CC champions, you need Mercs for this. As painful as it is losing that magic pen, CC is LeBlanc's biggest counter and weakness, if she is CC'd during a W it's often game over for her. Having that tenacity can get you out in time.\n\nAnother situation I love for picking different boot options, let's say I'm against a Zed, pretty easy lane for LeBlanc. And I get 3 kills, bot lane is squishy and prone to ganks and overextends, I don't benefit a tonne from that magic pen at that time. But what I do benefit from, is buying mobility boots, shoving mid, running botlane with W super fast and picking up easy double kills multiple times. What difference does that magic pen make, when people are still buying core items, and I'm able to back and get an early deathcap and zhonyas. Later on I'll also be fed enough to buy void staff if I need the magic pen, but LeBlanc snowballs hard, with the gold you get to snowball, and the amount you snowball from getting those Mobi boots early, you can even buy Sorcs later on. You're so fed by that point, gold is easy to get. LeBlanc is a champion that hard abuses advantages and that's a huge early advantage. The other items are self explanatory situational, Zhonyas if you need armor or the active, deathcap if you need a lot of flat AP, abyssal if you need MR and your Rumble top lane benefits from it too. Void staff if there's MR, etc. \n\n**Combos**\n\n\nThe most basic harass/burst combo Q W, as your Q debuff adds a big damage boost to your next ability that hits. It procs additional damage which is the reason for Q 2nd max. Always Q before you W unless you can W execute, as the damage burst is insane. Late game you blow up everyone with a Q W R - W back to your mark combo. You can add E's in if you can hit it and it benefits you at that point. Combo's are pretty damn simple. You ult your W if you want more damage, and ult your E if you require the additional CC. You ult your Q if your E is off cooldown, W is on cooldown, they can escape the E and the initial E hit damage with Q proc can execute someone. \n\n**Early Laning**\n\n\nEvery single time I go into lane, the second minions arrive but the casters are still behind and far away enough not to agro, I auto attack and W (make sure you hit minions too but prioritize the champ) and auto again and move away to remove creep agro and then cs. This is because W is a long cooldown, and using it a little bit too soon to level 2 can mean you won't benefit from the level 2 spike. I auto the enemy every single time I don't need to cs a minion or push and if I'm not too close to casters to draw agro.\n\nI ensure I hit level 2 first by hitting the minions with my lvl 1 W while I harassed the champ. Prioritize pushing if they push hard so make sure **you** hit lvl 2 first. As I go in to last hit of the 1st creep on the 2nd wave, I have my hands hovered over CTRL Q and I move in Q and W range of them, I hit the creep and instantly Q W them. This advantage is **huge**. Every time my W is off cooldown I Q W them, usually by the 2nd Q W they're low enough to kill, I back off and play passive until my W is off cooldown, then I flash Q W ignite auto spam and they're dead. Playing passive makes them think you're afraid and can't kill them, when you can with flash. \n\n**Laning/Roaming**\n\n\nLane plays out like this typically the whole phase. Much like the level 2 advantage, rush level 6 first and Q W R for huge damage. Remember your R is no cost so you can do this with little mana. Remember to use all your abilities on them after you've shoved the wave and back when you can buy items that enhance your power spikes. Such as 900g first back, codex, pot and ward. This allows for them to be lower so they either stay and get blown up the second your in lane as they struggle to shove the wave, or they back in a bad wave position for them to not get ganked. \n\nRoam when you see an opportunity for kills that is greater than your current mid state, or if roaming benefits the entire team more. Shove wave with W R autos, run down bot/top that's overextended and punish them for it. Having mobi boots basically says \"fuck your wards, I'm too fast for you to escape”. \n\nSometimes, staying in lane is better. Maybe it's a Morgana/Blue Ezreal lane that's fed. You can roam if they overextend on low enough HP but don't force anything. If you can't, staying in lane and killing the enemy over and over will give you enough gold to one shot Ezreal a bit later on, which helps the team more than a risky gank that you could die to.\n\nLeBlanc can solo carry with kills alone sometimes, but knowing who, when and where to focus your time and resources at is the difference between a 17-3 LB that wins and a 17-3 LB that loses. \n\n\n**And Never Pick LeBlanc Into Lissandra or Malzahar**\n\n\nI spent about an hour writing this on my laggy phone at 3am with college at 8am so I didn't include details about mid/late game, but if you want to know more just reply saying so and I'll include it tomorrow. Early game is the most important and most intricate part of LeBlanc as it decides whether you one shot the champ of your choice in late/mid game or not. \n\nFeel free to ask any more questions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422414741", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Imagine you are in class and your teacher asks you to write all of the capital letters of the alphabet four times - A A A A B B B B C C C C ....\n\nYou know that you'll have to write a little more than 100 letters on the page. You can guess how long it takes you to write a single letter, but writing can sometimes be faster or slower. This is true for computers too.\n\nA loading bar in computers is basically the same as the teacher asking you every second, \"JPK, how much time do you still need to finish writing your letters?\"\n\nIf you took 2 seconds to write the first letter, and you need to write 100, you could guess that you need 198 seconds to finish. But if it took you 3 seconds for the letter B (curves!) or 1 second for the letter C (don't need to lift the pencil!) then your guesses will be a little bit wrong every time.\n\nNow what happens if you drop your pencil? (In this analogy, after flushing data to disk, the computer switched tasks to take care of something of higher priority, like opening the reddit home page in your browser)\n\nSuddenly your time changes a little bit more because you have to take time to pick up your pencil (task switch), or to sharpen your pencil (file seeking), or to erase a mistake (error checking), or to write your name on the assignment (file system journaling) or to put a page down and get a new page (storing in cache or page memory).\n\nIt was very easy to guess when you only had to think about how fast you wrote the first letter.... but clearly it isn't enough information to figure out the entire time remaining.\n\n----\n\nAs far as the last 1% goes, this is kind of like doing your entire assignment first before you write your name and date and class and give your pages to the teacher. The loading bar usually estimates time remaining based on the task it represents, since it can actually be measured by looking at past progress. \n\nThat last percent often includes tasks that cannot be measured. For example, when you download files, they are usually downloaded to a temp directory first, then moved to the real destination (or they are downloaded at the real directory but with a fake extension, like myfile.jpg.part; then the file is renamed to myfile.jpg when the download is complete).\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422415542", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

Of course bots arent any type of problem to u, cuz u lag and u cant b killed by bots. If i lagged like you, there would b absolutely NOTHING to ever complain about!!!\n\nWhat are u mad cuz PTC makes your group get off after getting HIT and ABUSED time after time, CONSECUTIVELY? Everyone, look at ELITE VIOLENT J get MAD!! HAHAHAHA. THIS shows u all how HARD we slap shit. When a LAGGER like this gets this upset about anything, u KNOW we do WORK.\n\nHOw in the FUCK are u going to talk about tapping a big tower???? LOL ONLY reason u get close to any tower, (or used to, cuz now u move slow AHAHAHAHA) is cuz u LAG. Not like u dont know this. Hey EliteViolentFaggotFuck, why arent u playing right now??? CUz u dont gotta team??? Y is that, cuz they all are scared of getting DESTROYED??? LOL \n\nJust in case you didnt know, its absolutely pointless u saying ANYTHING. No1 respects SHIT u have to say, not even the slightest bit. There is a lota scrubs that play this game that need to learn how to play a lil better, some are getting slightly better. BUT YOU, YOU are by far the biggest SCRUB this game has to offer. SOME who LAGS incredibly, purposely, and talks about \"learn how to play\" LOL\n\nHow does it feel you've been playing this game for how long, and STILL really have no idea how to truly play. You would b amazed how much more difficult it is to do shit, if ur not LAGGING like u do. \n\nYou WHOLE team is a joke. Reekdaddy trying to PUSH??? LOL cuz he dont got the laggers he used to. And even when u did have all the laggers, u STILL got hit WHENEVER i had a full group, or at least 7 ppl, which yes u do need for fighting several laggers, with pussy bitches just playing cannon n ballista d, DEPENDING on their laggers to win.\n\nYOur team gets hit CONSTANTLY n leaves LOL. Some of your team back out from me n 3 other ppl after getting BEAT twice lol. Ur team is LOST without ATTEMPTING to lag the gate down. I made zoek QUIT. I made astro QUIT. I make madara leave every fucking lobby cuz he aint gonna do SHIT with me on D.\n\nFOr some reason i hope that u can lag again, just so i can slap the fuck outta u while lag switching, as i am a lagger killing pro. btw eliteviolentfaggotfuck, thanks for the ez league  points the whenever we play u! NOOB\n\n#MoVeSLOwBITCH\n\n\nP.S MARIE, I THANK YOU for doing whatever u've been doing recently, slowing down hardcore laggers, FOR THE MOST PART. There is STILL ppl that lag switch, n get away with it. BUT i have noticed more ppl moving slow from time to time, which is a good sign. This guy Violent j, is one of, if not the most NOTORIOUS laggers in the game.

The statement that classical music was concerned largely with minor keys is not accurate (Beethoven's Symphony #9 Ode to Joy, Eine Kleine Nachtmusic, The Blue Danube Waltz, Clair De Lune, etc. etc.)\n\nFor just about all European stringed instruments, the instrument's tuning is determined by a balance of two things: how far fingers can reach comfortably while maximizing the instrument's range. This is why the violin, viola, and cello are all tuned in 5ths - because in one hand position, you can play every chromatic note easily while at the same time the instrument as a whole has a range of more than 4 octaves. Tuning a bass or guitar in 5ths wouldn't be feasible, though, since your fingers would have to stretch too far to keep you hand in a single position to play every chromatic note, but 4ths fit comfortably.\n\nAnd what about that major 3rd between G and B? Well, the answer of \"to play 6 note chords\" is really close to the truth. If the entire guitar were tuned in 4ths then you would have E A D G C F and playing first inversion 6 note major chords would then be unfeasible, so lowering the C and F to B and E means that you could barre across all 6 strings to have your 5 and 1 at the bottom.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422461257", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 100, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Actually I'd say you're not judgmental enough, also for some reason in the anime community people seem to be super passive aggressive, in regards to the shows that they like, getting offended if someone doesn't gush 10/10's over a show, and getting downright irate when someone points out all the flaws in a show.  Also the \"Agree to disagree\" or the \"it's a matter of taste\" is a bunch of B.S.  People use that argument when they have already decided that they don't want to hear the criticisms of a show/movie/whatever they like  There ARE standards to measure great media and poor media no matter the genre(those who are curious can google them, I'm no one's encyclpedia)\n\nAlso a lot of people haven't really watched the genre a lot in the \"golden days\"(I put that in quotes because there are some great shows now that would be worthy of the title, but I'm still using the title as a reference)\nSo they don't really KNOW what's good and why, due to mere exposure, this I can excuse, but at the same time it doesn't mean that a certain show is \"good\" or whatever.  A Rotten Tomato is still a Rotten Tomato even if you've never tasted a Tomato before.\n\nSo basically, if anyone says you're \"too judgemental\", either:\n\na)ignore them and refuse to take part in any discussions about quality shows with them in the future\n\nor\n\nB)spend the enormus amount of time and energy, gathering sources, standards tons of examples etc etc to someone who has already made their mine and will not be open to any other viewpoint anyway.\n\n\nObvious unless you're getting paid for B, it's not worth it.\n\n\nNow on to your list:\n\nAkame ga kill should be a 4 at best. It started off interesting, but their odd mood changes, and the Author's \"trying to hard to be edgy\" by killing off characters before they had enough time to shine , adding too many characters (seriously, how many \"groups do we have to face in the story) \nChanges in the authors portrayal of characters, first he introduces characters as really really evil, having them sit on a pile of corpses in a town where they killed everyone, tearing off the face off a governor's daughter etc etc, then to try to make us \"SYMPATHETIC\" towards them\n like the reader/viewer forgot what happened a few episodes before, is insulting to the viewer/reader (I mention reader because the manga was just as bad if not worse than the show)\n\nThe author went so far as to bring a character REDICULOUSLY out of character in order for her to die (I'm talking about the shape shifting assasin) there's a myriad of other writing problems that just make that show/manga a chore to read/watch.\n\nAldnoah zero gets a 5, if only for the first three episodes Directed by Urobuchi Gen before getting a new writer/director in which the story just went into full retard mode. The artwork is awesome though so it has that at least\n\nI would say that C gets a 5 that show has tons of problems, characterization was silly, and the \"message\" the writers were trying to convey were as pretentious as penguindrum was (although I'd give that a 6 at least)\n\n\nCode geass, so I RARELY EVER rate an anime a 10/10 but I would actually agree with the FIRST season of the show being at LEAST a 9/10.\n\nHowever the Second season was a misreable trainwreck, with asspull after asspull, characters that didn't need to be in the show (hi Rollo), FUcking ROCKET EMPEROR (seriously that was ridiculous)  I could write a 50 page essay on why geass season 2 was bad. I'd give that a 7, using the momentum of the first season as a basis.\n\nI'd also give Death note an 8, mostly dude to the addition of the new characters in the second half of the series.  still very good show but, yeah the characters and plot after L's demise really brought the series down, Hell I'd rate the show a 10 if they ended it after Light Beat's L.  That was just amazing.   A lot of writers don't know when to just END a story.\n\nFate/zero + UBW would get a 6 at best mainly for the BLATANT B L A T A N T violation of:\n\nSHOW, DON'T TELL.  This is the FIRST THING you learn when you make any type of visual media  If there is any Reading in a show/movie etc, overly explaining things when it could have been better to show is the explained thing, the show/movie automatically loses points.  If viewers wanted to hear lots of dialogue, they'd just listen to a fucking radio.\n\nAll of that dialogue was insultingly unnecessary.\n\nI'd rate Mirai Nikki a 9, the plot was needlessly convoluted and didn't need to be. The characters is what made that show great though. \n\nMonster: 10/10 definitely, one of the VERY few shows I'd rate a 10. 70+ episodes of awesomeness. I couldn't find one flaw even if I tried to.\n\nPsycho pass 2:  4/10 Seriously, I'm not even joking here, I got one sentence for you \"186bodies sewn into one person\"  yeah gtfo out of here with that shit writer/Director(Gen didn't direct season 2), more like 186 ways you done fucked up the series in the second season only to have the series basically reset as nothing happened at the end! Everything good about season 1 was basically gutted in season 2. It was highly insulting. In my opinion the second season doesn't exist, that's how bad it is(and the ending pretty much negates everything anyway so it might as well be that S2 didn't happen).\n\nSidonia no kishi 7.  spot on, and I'm basing this on the manga as well, as it gets pretty silly after the end of the show I had to drop the manga it was just - yeah it wasn't good.\n\nSteins Gate 10  Yes one of the very few 10s I would give to a show\nThe characters and acting were top notch, the story was amazing and . . .\n\nTHEY DID TIME TRAVEL RIGHT! ANNND they did it without being all in your face about it.  Again I can't find any flaws in that show.\n\n\nZankyou no Terror wow I'm surprised you rated it that low I totally agree with that, I'm just shocked that someone else saw enough of the flaws that it pissed them off to that extent.\n\n\n\nShows/moves that you should be watching: Garo - first have is a solid 9, jury is still out on the second half\n\nE  - one of the FEW comedies that I'd rate 10/10 period. the jokes are just so genius that the mind just boggles.\n\nTale of princess Kaguya\nWolf Children\n\n\nMost of your other ratings make sense, and some have piqued my interest like Toradora. I haven't seen that but seeing as you rank that a 10/10 (which really means there are NO flaws whatsoever)\n\nAlso, there ARE shows that I like that I KNOW are just bad, but for some reason *I* like them, of course it doesn't mean they are good there are some show that I like that I could write books on why they're bad but they still provide entertainment to me, I wouldn't recommend those to anyone but I still recognize a bad(yet entertaining) show when I see it.\n\noh and the reading thing. the ONLY series that gets a pass in reading is star wars mostly because the stylized way it was presented.  But it only barely by passes the \"no reading in a visual medium\" rule Hell 99% of people mostly stopped reading at the 4-5th line anyway so it still was useless to even have but it was done with style.\n\nEdit: yeah FMA B a 6? yeah that needs to be a 9 at least, its NOT a 10 but yeah.  ofc I could understand if you had already watched the first season where they did a terrible anime original ending so I can understand how the first series influenced you I mean, really you've already seen the first have of Brotherhood from the first series, so that makes sense to me while you rate it so low which it should be higher", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422497912", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "4 hours a day is an easily achievable average, depending. Standard shift is what, 9-5? Let's say you then do the \"hobby\" 18-22, then rest of the stuff 22-1/2/3, depending what a sucker for sleep you are. The actual order of how you do it doesn't matter, because 24 hours - 6h sleep - 2h travel from/to work - 8h shift = 8 hours to spend as you see fit. Then if you factor in that you don't work sundays, maybe even saturdays (don't know what the averages are, I'm just mashing assumptions right, left and center). Averages are so powerful that you can sometimes stay up late doing something for 8 hours, but then next day you wont because you're going to be tired and go to sleep earlier, YET IT WORKS OUT TO THE SAME NUMBER AS IF YOU WERE DOING IT STRICTLY ON SCHEDULE. If you don't work the weekend and sleep a bit more (8h), we got weekly: 168 hours - 40h work - 46h sleep - 10h worktravel = 72h to spend as you see fit. Factoring in the 30 hours spent on the hobby leaves you with 42 ( forty two) h o u r s to jerk off. If that ain't your hobby already.\n\nAt the start I said \"depending\" because obviously we're not talking about a parent of three. High school or college students have even more free time on average after factoring in studying (if you're dumb as hell then hours invested on studying is the least of your worries, welcome to life you stupid shit). A working male in his twenties can learn so many skills it's not even funny, not to mention foreign languages (1 hour a day, be a pro within a year). The problem is that most of us tend to procrastinate during high school/college and continue with that trend well into their late twenties / early thirties.\n\nEver heard about that guy who knows 5 foreign languages, plays the guitar, banjo, harp and piano like a pro while working double shifts manual labor, bringing up two children with a mistress on the side and he occasionally dabbles in atom physics? Everyone knows a guy like that, just shrugging it off with \"no-lifer\", \"enjoy life will you\" or another non-funny remark like that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm an advocate of procrastinating, but people should stop bullshitting themselves. After I get home from work I have so much free time that I sometimes wish I was working till like 20:00 just so that I can go to sleep earlier because there are no tournaments that week, therefore I can't waste the time properly and I'm forced to do something that will actually benefit me or otherwise die of boredom.\n\nTLDR: Put the basic things on paper, like work/school + travel, lunch, sleep etc and see how many hours you have left for the week. I don't care because I have 100% procrastinating uptime when not working, but at least I have no grand illusions.\n\nProbably shouldn't have written all this but meh, if it helps you see that 30 hours per week doing something that you genuinely enjoy (a hobby), it's worth it.

Tokyo Ghoul's anime adaption was successful and clearly brought more fans to the series, but with the way that √A is going, it seems like they plan to end it here.  √A is doing something kinda interesting.  Its changing the story, but still including major events.  Meaning points A B C D are still included, but the way they get there is different and some details about those events are different (people involved, where it takes place, when it happens, etc.).  The reason I mention this is pacing.  It seems like Ishada wanted to take the lead and rewrite it this time because it would be easier and more convenient to tell the story by changing a few things rather than cramming it into 12 episodes.  He's also telling the story much faster than the manga did because of the way he's changing certain things.

Through the ultimate holy vision of Nora her wave crashes on the the beach of patch island (or would it just be patch in that case?). Valkia isn't knocked out or anything because Valkia doesn't get knocked out, she just allows herself to sleep on short notice. At that point she screamed \"Blood for the blood queen!\" and slaughtered those on the beach that gave her weird looks, and those that didn't. Blah blah blah blah I don't feel like writing out how she gets from signal to beacon blah blah blah. She passes the test getting her into beacon, she went in on team NORA composed of Valkia the Gorequeen, Valkia the Gorequeen, Valkia the Gorequeen, and Valkia the Gorequeen. Days later she found the holy one known as \"Nora\". At that point, they formed a wonderful relationship known as the Valkia Harem. In it it has Nora, Nora, Nora, Everyone else, and Nora. Nobody asks how Valkia the Gorequeen is a color, because those who do ask are never seen again. Oh my god spaghetti-san I love you! Marry Love me spaghetti bot! Thanks!

You need to capitalize on that mid game power spike. \n\n\nRenekton you need to do what you can to hit 3. That means bullying pre 3 or knowing when you lose trades pre 3 and avoiding them. Once you hit three you have a harass / sustain combo that puts pressure on most laners. That is e w q e away so they can't trade back. Typically you get Tiamat to add burst, facilitate wave clear, and animation cancel w. It also helps make him more of a threat later on. From there you typically go tank. Now what renekton does is not dive the back line with the intention of assassinating the adc like an irielia but provide a front line for your own team. You can chunk people and shred armor which helps your adc burn down people. You have a targeted stun which is always helpful and you do aoe damage. \n\n\nSo that is a bit of the difference between them.

The whole purpose why multiaccounting is banned because people could take MORE spots in the topranks besides their first one.\nWhy not just make it that the system checks who is who on which IP/HWID whatever and just give out a message \"Sorry,but your IP is known to already have a ranked score on this with another account. Unfortunately you won't get a place in the leaderboard with this play then.\"\n\nIf you do this...the whole reason why people could abuse multiaccount vanishes. Thus noone feels attracted to it anymore.\nAnd if multiaccounting would be allowed and you all the fucking random bans and shit would be totally worthless. I mean...so many players lately get banned for said reason. Some even do it out of straight boredom that this system only gives people pp if they extend their skill by far..\nWhat i mean is that it's MEGA frustrating to play a map over a dozen of times maybe even some hundreds of times. And then you get 1 fricking PP for less for that. I see so many streamers getting out scores on their highppmaps just for farming purposes...\n\nWhat happens then is totally obvious. People hate them for being farmers. Thus their way to get pp is unfortunately hated by the community. But you want that PP so bad. The system is designed to give you euphoria every time you reach a new set of PP-value...\nAs you can see then if you play and play and play...and recieve barely no pp...of course the game gets hella boring as you see no fucking purpose in straining yourself so much to try and get this pp.\nWhat's the easiest way then to get pp? Right. Multiaccount some and get the easy euphoria. \n\nIn my opinion some and i say SOME Players just multiaccount to supress their boredom of the game which is basically \"circle clicking\"..\nJust let them do it. Not ban them for trying to circumvent dying of boredom, because of this game.\n\nAnd you other players who aren't affected by anything...like the #40000 - #5000 k-ish ones. Stfu seriously. You are such hypocrites anyway. I always see it on this board.

{"body": "The reason why you can sing songs that you normally play different chords to is that the modern day system of western music is relative. You can always transpose the music. The easiest way to think about it from a guitarists perspective is to think about how the capo works: When using the capo, you can play exactly the same chord forms while at the same time making the chords sound different (higher in pitch). For example, if I would have put a capo on the first fret while playing your chord progression (G, E5, C, D) using the original fingerings the chords would now be called Ab F5 Db and Eb. Soundwise, it's different, but you can still sing the same melody lines you sung before, but now in a different pitch. If you continue the journey with the capo, new chords will pop up: If the capo was on the 5th fret the chords would be called C, A5, F, G and if the capo was on the 7th fret the chords would be called D, B5, G, A. You maybe recognize some of these are the chords for the songs you were implying in the original post?\n\nYou still play the same left hand fingering, but the sounds are changing, the pitch is changing. The relationship between the chords are still the same though, and that is what answers your question. You can, since the modern western system of music is relative, transpose the chords while still maintaining the same relationship between them. To understand this fully you need to understand that the major scale (from which the chords you are using are built from) has seven notes and that each of these seven notes can function as a starting point for building chords. These seven notes are in one [system of theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis) just given a numer (I ii iii IV V vi and vii). By thinking in this way, everything is very easily transposable. The chords you are using are built from the G major scale which contains the notes G A B C D E and F#. One way of analyzing it would be to call the chords I vi IV V (G being one, E being six, C being four and D being five). Here's a wikipedia page dedicated to that specific chord progression: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50s_progression\n\nTry to learn a little bit about chord progressions, it can really open your mind about music. One good starting point would be to learn the so called I IV V progression in every key. Starting in the key of E and moving counter clockwise in the [circle of fifths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths) you would get the chord progressions: E, A, B (key of E), A, D, E (key of A), D, G, A (key of D), G, C, D (key of G, three of the chords used in your chord progression), C, F, G (key of C), F, Bb, C (key of F) and so on. All these chord progressions are \"the same\", just at different pitches. You could switch between one or the other and still sing the same melodies on top.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422650390", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Look I absolutely worship the Beatles. I will literally go weeks without listening to anything else and I've been this way my whole life, I'm obsessed. But you're going a little overboard I think. Verse, chorus, dance beat whatever was all done well before the Beatles. The Beatles did not invent the pop song. What the Beatles did from the very beginning was implement complex melodies and harmony over more traditional style western chords and then play that as rock and roll. That's what makes them so different in the beginning of their career. I mean you'll find verse and chorus in jazz folk blues pretty much any 20th century music. Even many Classical pieces contain some sort of chorus or hook as we'd say now days, supplemented by build up and exposition. Just like the verses of a pop song. That's the way music works. Our ears crave familiarity. You can't just have one on going always changing stream of melody from beginning to end. Music needs structure. And for The Beatles  it's not the structure of the songs or anything like that, it's the actual music itself. I mean take the chords to please please me, E A G B C C#m F#m, compared to standard blues and rock and roll E A B, and RnB, C G Am F(the good ol I V vi IV). The Beatles essentially implemented classical chords into pop. Add on top of these new chord changes The Beatles incredible sense of melody and harmony plus Ringo's rock defining 4 on the floor style and you have unarguably the greatest band of all time.\n\nAnyway,\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyJjihseiio\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8k3qB61lhk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkJauxo-4T8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6EomECg2Q\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uawaDJ-b0_k\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422652078", "subreddit": "beatles", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No problem. My first image topic to reddit I did a text post and pasted the full URL into the body text haha. I was worried when I saw this was your first post. I didn't want to scare you away from the subreddit!\n\nIt says good things about you that you realized the value of criticism rather than just praise. The blank space thing is something that newbies in all sorts of design projects make, not just in calligraphy, so you're not alone there. \n\nI encourage you to start doing the words of the day. You don't even have to post it, just at least pick up the pen and do a little bit, to get in huge habit of practicing regularly. I feel like I have a ton of things I want to say, but I need to get to bed so I'll leave it to a couple more main things. You may be doing this already, but since this is your only post I don't know much about your practicing yet. \n\nPractice individual letters. I tried to do the WotC a couple days ago and didn't get past the first letter. I have a whole page of just the letter P with slight differences trying to get it just the right shape. It's boring and you can't really show it off to anyone, but it will help the most. \n\nOften it's best to learn groups of letters and not alphabetically. 'O' is the basis for a lot, the curves on other letters and often the width of other letters can be easily judged relative to it. It's also good to practice similar letters at a time  like M N U W all together because they use the same shapes.\n\nIt is also helpful to focus on just the lower case and then move on to capitals. I'm trying to learn italic and haven't even touched the majuscules because they involve a whole bunch more strokes and I haven't mastered the basic ones yet. Of course, waiting is less fun. ;) \n\nThere are many great examples on this subreddit as well. You can learn a lot by looking at other posts, even if they are a different script because the same general principles of spacing, layout, etc apply. Try to train your eye by looking critically at other work. Look for consistency, is everything straight, is the curve in the O the same as the lowercase E, etc. As you look closely at other work, you will be able to see in your mind what your own needs to look like.\n\nOh, and keep your ductus super handy. I feel really confident with my uncial, but I still take a look at it before I sit down to practice, to make sure I remember the exact shapes. Don't check it for every single time you do a letter, but don't look at it for he first week and never again either. If you practice the wrong thing a hundred times, by the time you notice it, it can be hard to retrain your hand.\n\nI'll quit my rambling now. Feel free to ask any specific questions you have, and  post in the future with your practice. Even just a page of repeating five letters can get you good advice on how to get better, it doesn't have to be also anything fancy. And...

{"body": "&gt; Stop talking about narrative and come up with some factual evidence that Gronkowski isn't that good. Otherwise, this is a waste of my time.\n\nHeh, I like how you accuse me of being 'retarded' - then turn around and accuse me of \"talking about narrative\" instead of \"facts\".\n\nLet's review.\n\nYour last post: 0 facts, 0 figures - well, other than the ones I cited. Absolutely nothing new, whatsoever. --- My last post: 8+ individual facts, indicating where Gronk ranked in TDs, RZ TDs, total targets, total receiving yards rank, etc.\n\nYou project much, my dude? Something you're insecure about? Because it looks to me like you're accusing me of the dumb shit you're doing yourself: doing nothing but yammering and talking shit, without any facts or figures to back up what you're saying.\n\nGronk is good - but for the 8 billionth time, being the \"best TE\" is akin to being the \"best LG\" in the league - it DOES NOT hold the same equivalency to being the Best WR. It has and always will be: Best WR &gt; Best TE, Best LT &gt; Best G, Best RB &gt; Best FB, and on and on. He doesn't demand double coverage, you don't need to game plan around shutting him down, none of that. You just line him up and work around him - same as the rest of the NFL does.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, he is not a Superstar NFL Player - He's a Superstar NFL Tight end. And even then, unlike the other Superstar TE (Graham), he's not a down-field threat. Vernon Davis, Jimmy Graham, Julius Thomas, Greg Olsen....even Jason Witten ran a faster 40 time, and he hasn't been a deep threat his whole career. Graham is a WR/TE hybrid - Gronk is a pure TE. He's a plodder. You can piss and moan about me calling him a plodder all you want, but 4.68 is a motherfucking PLODDER.\n\n4 . 6 8 m a k e s y o u a p l o d d e r. Period.

{"body": "The parkour element of the game is done excellently, it's made to be slightly unrealistic so you can do some crazy building to building jumps and escalate almost anything you feel like. Once you unlock the grappling hook you go from parkour master to Spiderman and even though it's breaking more away from reality, you don't care because it's made so incredibly smooth and fun.\n\nCombat with zombies is very varied if you make it so. You can dropkick zeds into spiketraps, cut off their arms, head, legs, split them in half lengthwise, lure them into shocktraps, shoot them, set them on fire with molotovs, send them flying with dynamite or grenades, taunt them to walk off balconies and let them fall to their death, hit the gas tank on the back of a hazmat zombie so he blows up his comrades. It's all a great and visceral experience. \n\n\nThe enemy variety is pretty good, though not terribly original since it's mostly using mostly the same recipe as Dead Island and similar games. \n\nDuring daytime the zeds will walk around slowly or be passive, you might face the odd Goon or two and if you make noise you'll attract \"Virals\", freshly turned zeds who will sprint towards your location and they are able to climb buildings pretty well. During night time you'll face all of the above in addition to all the different types of special zeds like spitter, bomber and bolter as well as \"Volatiles\" which are faster than Virals and very strong early to mid-game and they will aggro on you if you stay in their cone LOS for more than two seconds. During the night the game becomes extremely dark though you have a flashlight you can keep permanently on through the game. When you still don't have the skills and weaponry to fight for long, the night phase of the game is exceedingly thrilling and heart pounding as you're trying to dodge Volatiles, looking for routes to climb without falling flat on your face and generally just running for your life.\n\nSimilar to Dead Island you can upgrade all your melee weapons with ridiculous effects, Bleeding effects, poison, shock, fire, impact, or a combination of two of them. A fire weapon for example is a machete with a welding torch duct taped to it just to give you an idea. Good weapons also have 1-3 sockets for flat stat upgrades, which are items you get as reward for saving random survivors throughout the city or as a regular quest reward. The game will reward you immensely for looting all the bops and bits everywhere as the more blueprints you have collected, the more versatility you have for upgrades.\n\nThe durability system has been reworked a lot from Dead Island as well, the weapons have a set amount of repairs it can take before breaking completely, spending a metal part in the process. A skill around your mid-game phase gives you a high chance of not consuming a repair charge as well as increasing durability across the board so you won't run into the same problems as Dead Island where you're trying to save your awesome weapons for tougher mobs. Just swing away! By the time you've depleted your weapons you should have enough resources to upgrade another anyway. Techland has learned a lot in this department and I was very happy to see that.\n\nI really enjoy Dying Light as it's properly moving with the technology to increase the amount of zombies you can have in a game. You can be climbing up to a bridge and suddenly find yourself facing a literal horde standing around, forcing you to seek shelter on top of buses to get past them, it's a very cool \"oh shit\" moment as a game of this genre should have.\n\nIf I have to say something bad about this game it would have to be the melee weaponry for one, all the weaponry pretty much acts the same and there's no special ones to break up the monotony. You go from planks to wrenches and pipes to knives and hammers to machetes and finally to swords and the default shock/fire/poison/impact/bleed doodad attached to them. There isn't enough style difference between blunt and sharp. Blunt will smash their heads into pieces and sharp simply cuts the head off, it does the same and plays the same with a slightly different visual. The melee combat also becomes too easy too quickly in my opinion, once you hit a certain breakpoint in damage you basically activate godmode and you ravage through hordes of zombies like they were made of hot butter. I'm always fine with things like this towards the very end of the game, but the power creep came a tad bit early so the gameplay started feeling a bit cheap. But at least we're actually using our melee weapons instead of kicking all the zombies to death so we got that going for us now.\n\nThe other negative is about the last boss so I will spoilertag it. [The bossfight is a horrendous QTE. The entire last bit up until you reach the boss really tests your ability to use the games mechanics while under a bit of pressure, I loved it as it felt like a final exam to see if you had been paying attention at all. Then you reach the man himself and instead of being allowed to just enjoy one last cutscene or have a truly interesting fight using what you have learned the past 24 hours of gameplay, you have to sit there and push S A D W A A D S W FFFFFFFFFFFFFF when prompted instead. It also has this odd break where you think it goes over to full cutscene mode but then it throws another QTE sequence at you and you don't have your hands on your keyboard anymore because you thought you could finally lunge for some snacks. I wouldn't say I'd be happy I got there and discovered it was just a pure cutscene either, but it would have been better than a QTE to end it...](/spoiler)\n\nOverall, it's the best lootmongering/hack'n'slash I've played yet, gave me a lot of giggles through the sidequests, the atmosphere is spot on, it rewards the curious and the adventerous and you'll have at least 24 hours worth of gameplay before you feel like enough is enough.

{"body": "One night L M N O P all went to a party. The beer was flowing, music pumping and every one was cutting loose. L M N O P started to split and mingle with every one when M got worried because O was no where to be seen. \n\nM searched the upstairs rooms but found nothing, only when walking past the bathroom did M hear any noise. Starting to get worried that O was sick, M barged in. What M saw was horrifying. O was passed out while the letter I was raping O. \n\nIn a rage M ripped the towel rack off the wall and started to beat I, hitting I harder and harder until blood splatter was on all the walls. M, now drenched in alphabet blood, tried desperately to wake O to no avail. M had to get cleaned up quick so it could get the help of L N &amp; P. \n\n\"Guys you have to come with me, its O\". As they all entered the bathroom O was awake, curled in an oval crying. \"Shhh, its okay, well sort this out.\" says N. \n\nP goes and gets the car, parks it by the curb where the bathroom window is. L and M grab I, opened the window and rolled him on to the roof tiles. P has a picnic blanket ready on the ground for when they pushed I off the roof on to the ground. They rushed down stairs, no one seems to have noticed any commotion going on, good. They help P carry I into the boot of the car. \n\nWhile all this was going on N cleaned the bathroom, got O up and ready to go. They walk down stairs, thank the host for a good time and say they must leave O doesn't feel well. \n\nWith P at the wheel, they drive and drive. M looks into the back seat and sees O leaning on L and N thoughtfully looking out the window. Hours pass and they arrive in the deep, deep desert. Have dragging, half carrying, they take I to a place covered over by a rise. P and L start digging, they put I in a shallow grave, walk back to the car and drive away. \n\nThe car is silent, peaceful, no words need to be muttered because they all know.. This is just another secret they will keep to the grave. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dust has settled around the shallow grave, a scorpion even crawled across it, but if you looked closely the ground has started to move, as if the dead was coming alive..... \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422734705", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 27, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Before you deem the program to be shoddy, you might want to know what it actually is first - http://www.goodlookingloser.com/anxiety/program\n\nI know what it is man. It's stupid. \n\n&gt;This is 100% great advice, it's not my first time hearing it on TRP or the GLL site. But I did hear this advice little late. I joined the swim team in sept. in effort to follow this advice but I learned quickly that the only team that gets any kind of love at a black school is basketball. (Which I didn't/don't have the of skill required to join). Granted, if this was in my sophomore/freshman year, things would have been different. But with &lt;5 months of school left, and only 2 classes a day, I find myself in limbo.\n\nThen get good bruh. Practice hard everyday, always give it your 110%. With your swimming, your cardio should be better on average than your average athlete. Now you just have to put in the work, but you have to start ASAP. Once you get to college, you will be great in a few years at WHATEVER it is you dedicate yourself to today - not to mention more mature, mabe taller/stronger/bigger, and much more comfortable in yourself. \n\nGet into wrestling and/or jiujitsu A S A P if you can.\n\nBy the time you're a junior/senior in college, you will be a beast (even if not a champion or top ranked etc) and women will smell it off of you. You will become so comfortable that approach anxiety will be a joke to you. You will feel the fuckin' Man. Posture, flow, eye contact, smirk, congruency, everything will align. You're out with friends at parties, clubs, whatever, and you will approach people and be amicable as well as charming. You will become obsessed with expressing yourself, with SHARING yourself with people. That's what it is, that's why women love Men. Dat Passion. That passion for expressing yourself and sharing yourself with zero regards for what people think of you, without any fear of rejection, WILL glow out of you, and EVERYONE will love it. Especially women. This will make interactions with people, especially hot women, fucking awesome. And you, and the bitches, will love it.\n\nAnd you will pick up on this, and then every time you approach a bitch, you will approach her just to GIVE HER THE PRIVILEGE of meeting a champion god motherfucker like you\n\nnamsayin\n\nBut that shit comes with time and hard work tho. \n\nThat's all it takes.

He sold out.  I began noticing the qualities of his books were on a downward trend.  They contained less and less substance.  At one point I remember thinking they he wasn't even trying, the chapters were just empty of actual plot, the sentences were crafted like a bad soap opera, they were just one incredibly long, drawn out Joey-smell-the-fart-face bullshit drama sequence after another that led the reader on to think something m i g h t happen.  But it never really did.  Or if it did, the contents of 6 chapters could have been written well and in an compelling way in half a chapter.  At this point I researched him.  And was so disappointed to discover he was a giant sell-out.  He is making tons of money from having ghost-writers 'co-author' his franchises and his books pretty much universally suck and have for well over ten years.\n\nI was so disappointed.  I really used to enjoy his writing.  He was an excellent story-teller.
