{"body": "“Streamer got us back with the save state, but, well…”\n\n“That Reset… that just can’t be accepted. Sets a bad precedent and all, you know?”\n\n“So, Red.” Their muttering changed to a darker tone. “If you can’t understand that… we will break you, if we must.”\n\n“What?” Red looked up, to see the Voices all circling closer and closer to him, the sky above being blocked out by more of the swarm, in effect forming a kind of cocoon. Abba rose his other wing in front of them both, trying to shield Red, while Dux and the Rattatas backed away cautiously.\n\n“Stay away from Red!” Abba shouted, head snapping left and right at the Voices while his eyes flared furiously.\n\nThey stopped. Cyclopic eyes blinked at Abba, who visibly gulped, and yet stood his ground.\n\n“The Pidgeotto decided that he couldn’t do this any longer, and dropped his master on the ground,” one of them said calmly. \n\nAbba tilted his head, confused, while Red’s eyes widened.\n\n“He returned to the tree he had previously been standing on, and watched nervously as the Voices continued closing in on Red,” another Voice added.\n\nRed blinked, and suddenly felt himself falling. He hit the ground with a groan, and looked up to see Abba perched in a tree impassively. “No…”\n\nThe Voices turned back to Red. “We would have broken that toy, but…”\n\n“When Lore is written, it can’t be unwritten.” Another Voice closed its eye and floated up-and-down in the air sagely.\n\nOne of the other Voices floated closer. “The law of conservation of mass.”\n\nRed blinked. “…Huh?”\n\nAnother Voice turned to the first one. “They go out into the world at ten, do you really think he understands that?”\n\n“Well, I *hoped* so!” the Voice retorted, before turning back to Red. “Now… what shall we do with you?”\n\nThe swarm took up the question. “Break him! Make him pay! He made Streamer intervene! To be fair, that was awesome. IMPEACH RED! IMPEACH RED OR RIOT!”\n\n“And there we have it…” The Voices closed in on Red, who tried to crawl away – but his legs, still recovering from the Streamer’s “intervention,” failed him.\n\nThey spoke sadly, “We didn’t want to do this.”\n\nThey spoke with anger, \"But you tried to send us away. You spat on our kindness, and you banished us! And now, you leave us no choice.\"\n\nThey spoke with finality, “We, the Hundred Thousand Voices, will assume direct control of this quest now.”\n\nThey spoke in accusation, “Remember, Red… this was your fault. Not ours, and certainly not the Streamer’s.”\n\nThe Hundred Thousand Voices spoke as one, and with them came a mighty voice that blasted deep into Red’s mind:\n\n***“START.”***\n\nRed felt his consciousness shunted back to a prison in the corner of his brain, the mental cell locked over and over again in every manner possible and some impossible.\n\nAnd now they spoke from within him, snaking through his body, forcing broken fingers and legs and ribs to re-knit, patching fractures and tears with their own powers. Painfully.\n\n*“You will watch from here. You will feel the effects of the trip on your body. Normally we limit that, but, well…”*\n\nRed felt his body once again rise up, and incredible pain shot through him. He couldn’t scream, or double over, or bite his tongue with the shock; he could only feel the suffering – the pain – the knives stabbing through his body–\n\n*“You’ve been too much of a thorn in our sides, Red.”*\n\n*“You will not stop walking. We will not allow you.”*\n\n*“You will not close your eyes. We will not allow you.”*\n\n*“You will not rebel against us again. We will not allow you.”*\n\n*“We are the Voices, and our control is now-and-always absolute.”*\n\n***“Understand?”***\n\nRed shook with effort – give them what they want to hear – but couldn’t make the words come out. *Too much pride, Voices. You can* understand, *right?* He could feel the Streamer’s command interlaced with the Voices’ order, and yet he refused to give them what they wanted. *This pain… anything would be preferable to that! Even what they have to punish me with! ...I can still repel them… right…? “START-“*\n\n***“UNDERSTAND?”*** Their shout shut down his attempt, but he tried again undaunted.\n\n*It’s my only hope… “SELECT-B-“*\n\n***“U-N-D-E-R-S-T-A-N-D?!”*** The hammer of the Voices came down again, and Red’s consciousness wavered for a moment under its force.\n\n*S-sta-* Red felt his mind cut off, refusing to finish the command, and could almost sob with the unfairness. *“Oh, COME ON!”*\n\n**“Throttled.”** The Voice echoed from far away, and he could feel the smirk directed his way by its owner.\n\n*“Wh…”*\n\n***”UNDERSTAND?! DO YOU COMPREHEND? DO YOU U N D E R S T A N D?!”*** the Hundred Thousand Voices howled together, and Red’s mental self wavered – then started fading, breaking, crumbling before their force.\n\n*“I-STARTABSELECT-NO-STARRGGG-NO! PLEASE STooPPPp… I… Iiii… UnDerrStand…”* Red sobbed in torture, curling up in a ball in the corner of his self. \n\nThe Voices chuckled in a fatherly way.\n\n*“Very good. Now then…”*\n\n*“To the tree!”*\n\n*“As long as it takes!”*\n\n*“PRAISE HELIX FOR THIS VICTORY!”*\n\n*“UP! START! LEFT! RIGHT! RIGHT! B! A!”*\n\n*“START A A B SELECT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT DOWN”*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbba watched as Red slowly stood, on legs that still shook from the Streamer’s weapon, and staggered back to that loathsome tree. “*A START B* DUX CUT!”\n\nDux looked back at Abba, then at Red- no, at the Voices – then turned to the tree, and in a single slash removed the obstacle. “I know how you feel, Abba, but… we can’t fight them, you know? We can only help Red… and hope that when all this is over, they’ll let him go. No matter what the price to us.”\n\nAbby laid her hand on Abba’s back. “I trust–“ She blinked for a moment. “Huh… I feel a bit odd. Like I wasn’t myself…” She shook it off. “I trust the Voices, Abba. They don’t mean us any harm, really. All they do is make Red stay up and sometimes give us bad commands in the battles, right?” She squeezed Abba’s shoulder with a smile, then walked past him to follow Red – *The Voices*, not Red, Abba reminded himself.\n\n“Hmph…” Abba didn’t trust the Voices, no matter what Abby felt – just look at what happened to Red. Red had rebelled against them, and now he didn’t even seem to be *there* anymore. He knew Red was still somewhere in there, but he definitely wouldn’t be coming out again. The Voices seemed to have seen to that. He couldn’t do anything to help Red. Right?\n\n“No.” That was wrong. He COULD do something.\n\nIn the state he was in now, Red could hardly do much of anything tactical in battle – well, not that he could do much before, either, but now it was even more obvious. So Abba would just have to step up to the plate. He couldn’t disobey the Voices (he shuddered for a second, feeling something rise up inside him at that idea), but he could get stronger. Last longer in battle. Survive any hit, push as far ahead as he could. He felt a surge of determination, and nodded.\n\n“I will protect you, Red… no matter what the Voices do.”", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422754355", "subreddit": "twitchplayspokemon", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My co-workers also always need a friend to smoke with.  I work retail, so leaving the 'floor' of our very busy store can create a coverage problem.  But when the need for a cigarette comes on, suddenly the two people who are scheduled to be manning a particular section leave (sometimes they do clock out as policy states, but often they don't) and go smoke and talk for waaaayyyy too long outside.\n\nI had another co-worker at my old store who smoked and needed breaks (she was waaaayyyy addicted to nictoine) BUT she didn't bug me in how she handled it.  She would choose a non-busy time, ask me (I was her manager), go outside to smoke and I have no idea how she did it but that woman could suck down a full cigarette in an insanely short amount of time.  She was barely gone and then BOOM!  She was back.  She was polite and quick about it so I never even asked her to clock out.\n\nNow when my daughter was hospitalized and I had to go to work for my shift I asked her for permission to check my cell phone for a text  every hour or so.  It would have taken me less than a minute (no cell phones on the floor).  I hated to leave my daughter at the hospital, even tho I had good friends staying with her and she was stable, but as I needed to keep my job I really needed to go to work.  I was super worried about my kid, and would have been a much more effective worker if I could have checked for text updates and been reassured that kid was okay.  (If an emergency happened my friends would have called my store but most of the time we are not able to answer the phone due to our high-volume of in store customers so I didn't feel reassured by the knowledge that I could get a call if a problem happened).  \n\nAnyways, I was told I was not allowed to check my phone and could only check it on break once every four hours and that I clearly needed to do a better job of setting aside my personal life at work.  (F u u u c k you Boss.  Go buy a Goldfish or something that requires care.  Maybe Walmart is having a sale on souls and you could pick one up for cheap??

So don't feel nervous about talking to someone else.\n\n* Go for similarly introverted or shy people, too.  Don't try to approach the loudest girl in school because obviously your personalities won't match.  \n\n* Don't think of us as one big group - W O M E N - just think of us as average people, because that's what we are.   Just like you see guys on the street or at school as random people, do the same for us.  We're all only human.  \n\n* Don't always think about girls in a romantic sense.  Yeah, dating is fun but if you only think of women when you want to date us, then you're only really caring about us when you want something from us, right?   So chat just to chat, like you would any guy friend.  Shoot the shit, talk about normal everyday stuff, you don't need to impress every girl you talk to, we get way too many guys trying that already.  Just be in the moment, listen and contribute to the discussion in any way you can.  No subject is too boring to bring up because you never know if the person you're talking to is actually extremely interested in whatever it is.\n\n* If you only think about kissing or making out with a girl, no wonder you're nervous.  Have you never just asked a girl how her day is going?  \n\n* You should only worry about kissing girls who have actually shown romantic interest in you.  Do not kiss girls if you have no idea how they feel about you.  Showing general interest in talking to you does not mean they want to kiss you.

People have no shame.\n\nStory time.\n\nI was seeing **G R A V I T Y** in an AMC which I paid like $16 to see in Ultimate IMAX Ultra-High-Def Real2D Whatever, and there was a guy who was on his phone for about 60% of the film. He's sitting in the front section so just about everybody can see him.\n\nNow, I can't say I never use my phone in a movie theater. But I'll only pull it out when it's really important (RunPee is awesome), when I have [Lux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitocassisi.luxlite) running so my screen is super dim, the phone is angled toward my body so nobody behind me can see it, and even then I'll only use it for 10 seconds max because I feel guilty, because I'm a human with human feelings and empathy and whatnot.\n\nAnyway, this dude kept pulling out his phone which I swear was designed to compete with a supernova, texting and surfing the web and whatever else. And kept it out for prolonged periods of time.\n\nAbout 1/3rd into the movie, a girl goes down and talks to him. I can't hear what they say, but she comes back up and the guy still has his goddamn phone out.\n\nWhen the movie ends he's still on his phone, so I go down to talk to him. I can't say I remember the exact conversation but I basically said \"so you just pissed off a theater full of people who just wanted to see a movie, are you proud of yourself?\" And his response was \"yeah whatever dog\".\n\nTL;dr: Assholes in this world don't give a **FUCK**.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422780971", "subreddit": "Austin", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "##**There are 3 kinds of movies:**\n\n##**The epic mind fuck. This is the kind of movie that Christopher Nolan would make. The kind of movie that has \"dat twist at the end doe.\" The kind of movie that discovers entirely new concepts in quantum cosmic meta astrophysics, that will later be written about in pseudo scientific pseudo philosophical pop science books aimed at white male college undergraduates who are majoring in business but tell everyone on the Internet that they major in STEM (mstrracelol) so they can join in with making fun of the STARBUCKS employee who is OBVIOUSLY a \"liberal arts\" major. This is the kind of FILM that makes one a better father. These films are most easily identified by their use of meticulous cinematography, the kind where every single frame that doesn't have a pirating website's watermark overlaid on it can be printed out and hung up in your bedroom at your parents house to impress your TF2 league with your awesome sense of minimalist design and, of course, use of colour (totally a brit lol murika). Actually you know who makes a lot of these kinds of movies is Marvel. Have you seen their stuff lately? Marvel doesn't even make superhero MOVIES anymore, they make genre FILMS. For example, Captain America. The Winter Soldier. is a political thriller. Thor 2 is a Shakespearean drama. Iron Man 3 is a psychological thriller. Ant Man is a mac and me parody. Btw, check out this gif here: macandmewheelchairgif.jiff. Guardians of the Galaxy may as well be the pull out method genre it was so risky lol.**\n\n\n##**Fucking total trash. You know the type. These MOVIES (not even going to honour (brit spelling lol fuck Comcast) them with the title \"film\") are the kind of movie M. Night Shamalamadingdong would make nowadays. Btw, did you know he ruined the last Airbender? I like to pretend that movie doesn't even exist lol XD. Oh wait, I'm talking about it right now. Hunh. Weird. Fuck Tyler Perry. Anyways. These movies are the kinds of movies that don't use color and don't use cinematography. They certainly aren't MINIMALIST by any means. These trash movies will have tons of Michael Bayesque explosions everywhere. Speaking of which, fuck Michael Bay. He made movies about robot transformers that SUCKED and so he SUCKS because he RUINED MY CHILDHOOD. These movies will not further science at all, and maybe even singlehandedly regress science back to where it was when my stupid fundie mom was in college learning WRONG facts like \"we only use 10% of our brains.\" Speaking of which, FUCK LUCY. I hate this movie so much. It's the perfect example of a TRASH FILM. it had so many problems. First, WE DON'T JUST USE 10% OF OUR BRAINS, ALSO IF WE USED 100% THAT WOULD BE A SEIZURE AMIRITE. Second, they made GOD himself (fuck fundies who believe in gOD, btw) say this stupid incorrect fact. Third, ScarJo. ScarJo ScarJo ScarJo. I paid to see you in Avengers. I paid to see you in Iron Man 2. I paid to see you in Captain America. The Winter Soldier. Finally, I paid to see you in Lucy. And guess what. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN NAKED ON SCREEN FOR ME ONCE. I deserve at this point to see you naked, and it's offensive to me that you won't do this. I hope the Fappening 2 happens to you. That'll teach you to make trash films that say we only use 10% of our brains but if we did use 100% that would be a seizure amirite. Anyways. Trash movies. These movies actually don't have to be watched to be identified and categorized, but should you choose to try, these movies are most easily identified by their use of SHITTY CGI. Fuck the Hobbit. Fuck Peter Jackson.**\n\n##**Movies that are just fun. This is a more subtle category of film. These films can only be identified through a complex process that involves other people. First, you have to watch the movie. If you enjoy it, you may be ready to ask yourself \"does this movie fit in the Epic Mind Fuck category or in the Movies that are Just Fun category? Only one way to tell. You have to log on to reddit, and browse your way over to /r/movies, where many of the world's top minds in cinematography congregate, and wait. Wait for this movie to be brought up. When it is, and you see other people trying to shit all over the movie, and put it in the Fucking Trash Movie category, that's when you know. This movie, while yeah honestly it's not that great anyway, and the CGI is bad and the acting is bad and other people on /r/movies find it to be a bad movie and really yeah you know it's bad, THIS MOVIE is really just fun. You need to then let the other /r/movies denizens know that this movie is honestly just fun so that the conversation will shift in that direction. The movies, which are honestly just fun, that fit into this category are most easily identified by browsing /r/movies and waiting to be told (which will not be a long wait) what these movies are, which is honestly just fun. Furthermore, placing a movie into this category completely absolves the movie of any and all critical evaluation, so don't try to come at me with your explanations of the faults in the cinematography. The cinematography is just fun.**\n\n##**Not a Movie but Breaking Bad Finally, as an /r/movies subscriber and long time cinephile, THIS is my favorite category. This category of FILM includes such masterpieces of cinematography and use of colour (fuck Comcast) as Breaking Bad, True Detective, and other great films. A movie that would fit into this category would be most easily identified through the following process. First, you watch the movie. Then, you reflect back on it. Was your mind fucked? If yes, then the next step is to ask yourself this question: When I pirated this film, did it come in one complete continuous stream of film, or did I have to pirate it one segment at a time where each segment was maybe an hour long and had their own titles and arranged in an episodic nature? If yes, then congratulations, you have found a great movie! Well, not a movie, but Breaking Bad. This is truly the best category of film out there. In fact that's why I spend most of my time on /r/ movies advocating for more films to be made as, instead of films, HBO miniseries. Actually you know what would be a great HBO miniseries? Deadpool. Deadpool really only works if it has an R rating. If it doesn't have an R rating, then I won't go see it. Also it needs to have a PG13 rating and only be allowed to say \"fuck\" once, so I can nominate it on /r/AskReddit for the title of a NotaMovie,butBreakingBad with the best use of its single PG13 \"fuck.\" That fuck should be when daredevil looks at the camera, BREAKING THE 4TH WALL, to say \"fuck Comcast.\"**\n\n##**If you liked my analysis, you should check out these great films, Moon (1994), The I N T E R S T E L L O R, and The Avengers 3, which I will be pirating in 2019, since I'm a true cinephile.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422782228", "subreddit": "Braveryjerk", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

The insane AP boost you get from this means way higher burst and overall damage and more survivability due to very strong shields. \nIf you're having troubles managing your mana, throw a sheen in between, which you will later build out to a Lich Bane.\nI much prefer to pick Diana when we have a very AD heavy team, meaning opponents aren't very likely to get MR, if they DO get loads of MR, consider a voidstaff as 5th item.\nGA should pretty much always be your last item, since between Zhonya's, GA and your insanely strong shields, you can last for a very long time in team fights and makes you a giant threat that they cannot really target first.\n\nReason I go for CDR boots is fairly straight forward; Better playmaking. 40% CDR means you have a shitload of shield uptime, allowing very effective skirmishes, and allows it to be back up after Zhonya's and GA.\n\nThe low cool down on your Q means you can chase with Q R Q R for days and Q is your hardest hitting spell.\n\nAlso having the lowest possible cool down on E is very nice, as I feel this is an insanely underrated spell. It's a mini Orianna shockwave in terms of CC and can massively disrupt the enemy team. Once you get the hang of it and with proper positioning you can screw over a lot of dashes/jumps.\n\nEdit: real \"tank\" items can be extremely useful but are very situational.

{"body": "&gt; 360-405 is 45hz\n\nYou can't do that.  That's why we talk about *ratios*.  To get from one frequency to another, you can only multiply.  Let's look at how that works.  The ratio from 360 to 405 (never mind the Hz, because it could be Hz or MHz or mHz or rpm or whatever units you want to use) is 405/360 = 9/8.  Whatever frequency you start with, you multiply it by 9/8 to get the same interval.  We call this interval a major second.  So, to go up this major second from a note, you multiply it by 9/8.  Let's look at another interval, 405 to 450.  That interval is a ratio of 10/9.  It's smaller!  10/9 is a smaller fraction than 9/8.  Yeah, the difference in Hz is the same, but that doesn't actually mean anything.  See, if we start from 360, going up by this interval would land us at 400.  9/8 gives us 405, and 10/9 gives us 400.  What do we call this 10/9 interval?  It's also a major second.  It's a different one.  It's pretty confusing, right?  The difference between them is pretty small.  We're going from 400 to 405, so the ratio is 405/400 = 81/80.  This is a small interval known as a syntonic comma (look that up if you're curious).\n\nWe just talked about four notes in a scale: 1, 9/8, 5/4, and 4/3.  Let's add 3/2 to that.  In Hz, these would be -- if we started at 360 Hz, which I picked just because it was a nice round number -- 360 Hz, 405 Hz, 450 Hz, 480 Hz, 540 Hz.  What are the step sizes?  Well, we can't subtract, because that doesn't mean anything.  We have to divide.  So we get a step of 9/8, then a step of 10/9, then a step of 16/15, then another step of 9/8.  You're right, these aren't even at all!  The 16/15 *shouldn't* be, though.  If we were to give these frequency ratios names, they'd be C D E F G.  The interval from E to F is only a half step, so it should be smaller than the others.  But it *is* weird that C to D and F to G are bigger than D to E, isn't it?\n\nNow, the reason small number ratios, like 2/1 and 3/2, are crisp (not *consonant* exactly; most people find them to be kinda harsh since we've gotten used to the out of tune equal temperament that we use) is because the waves line up!  If you take a sine wave at frequency f and add it to another sine wave at frequency 2f, or 3/2 f, it will make a regular pattern that's stronger at certain points.  If it's something like 8979234/234589 f (random numbers), it will just make a jumble.  Since the waves line up, they basically fit together, and the smaller the numbers in the ratio, the tighter that pattern is.\n\nSo, why do we use these ratios?  Well, to start with, we don't.  But I'll get to that.  Long ago, the ancient Greeks -- especially Pythagoras, actually, about 500 BCE -- realized that if you have a string on a kythara (a kind of lyre they used back then) and hold the string at some point to basically make it shorter, the pitch goes up.  OK, they definitely knew that one already by the time of Pythagoras.  But what Pythagoras realized, probably by playing with his instrument, was that if he used strings in particular ratios (at the same tension and weight, but let's not get into that), the sound of the two strings together would be crisp, which it wouldn't be otherwise.  It's a distinct aural phenomenon.  He realized that these were ratios of small integers, and he thought this was so cool that he founded a beanless cult based on everything in the universe being ratios of small integers.  And then he discovered the Pythagorean Theorem and found out that the diagonal of a square was actually *not* a ratio of small integers -- if the square has side 1, the diagonal has side sqrt(2) -- and he freaked out.  One guy in the cult told the outside world about the discovery.  Pythagoras and his cult drowned him.  These guys were hardcore.  Did I mention they weren't allowed to eat beans?  Today, this cult of small integer ratios lives on under the leadership of Lyndon LaRouche.  The guy's batshit crazy and his cult is batshit crazy, but they're at least entertaining crazy.  Look them up.\n\nAnyway, for centuries after that, Western music was based on these small integer ratios.  This is called Just Intonation (look it up).  Because of the ratios, you could play many notes together and have it sound crisp.  But the steps were uneven, and that got kind of annoying.  People came up with many solutions, called temperaments, that fixed some of these issues.  Some of them preserved certain intervals they liked.  For example, one temperament was quarter-comma meantone, and it kept that 5/4 ratio that sounds so crisp but made the 3/2 interval a little out of tune.  The problem is that the ratios don't work well together at all thanks to math, so whatever they tried, they'd make something better, but they'd also make something else *worse*.  One example is called Pythagorean tuning after Pythagoras (play with it [on my microtonal synthesizer](http://offtonic.com/synth); it's one of the presets).  And they make it by picking a note and just going up by perfect 3/2 fifths until they had 12 of them.  So, they might start with Eb, and they'd go up in 3/2 fifths to Bb, F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F#, C#, G#.  The next note would be D#, but they already had an Eb.  The problem is that, if you go up 12 fifths, you get *a bit more* than 7 octaves (24 cents more, actually, which is a big difference).  (Every tuning keeps the 2/1 octave, pretty much, because the human ear doesn't hear E down an octave and E up an octave as different notes.)  So the Eb wouldn't have been the same note as the D#.  The interval between the G# and the Eb wasn't a 3/2 perfect fifth.  It was really, really out of tune!  It was called the wolf fifth, and you were best to avoid it.  B major chord?  Don't do it!  Ab major chord?  Fuck off, that shit sounds awful!  But no matter what tuning they used it was always a compromise.  They'd fix some problem with Just Intonation, but they'd break something else.  There was always a wolf interval somewhere that was different that you couldn't use.\n\nSo someone came up with the biggest compromise of all -- let's just make 12 equal steps!  So now, C D E F G has C to D, D to E, and F to G be the same size, which was a problem before.  E to F is now half the size.  So the steps from C to C#, C# to D, D to D#, D# to E, E to F, F to F#, F# to G are all the same, and they're the same as the steps from G to G#, G# to A, A to A#, A# to B, B to C.  All the same!  The frequency ratio for that is 2^(1/12), since there are 12 equal steps to the octave, which is still a 2/1 ratio.  So you take the 12th root of that to get the half step.  Now, *nothing* sounds crisp, but some intervals, namely the perfect fifth and perfect fourth, sound *pretty* damn close to the perfect intervals 3/2 and 4/3, respectively.  It's still off, but only by a little.  The other intervals are off by more.  But, on the other hand, you can play in literally *any* key and it will sound the same, except a bit higher or lower!  No more unequal intervals making things sound different!  And that's what we use today.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422807297", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "CTRL+F \"There are 3 kinds of movies:\nThe epic mind fuck. This is the kind of movie that Christopher Nolan would make. The kind of movie that has \"dat twist at the end doe.\" The kind of movie that discovers entirely new concepts in quantum cosmic meta astrophysics, that will later be written about in pseudo scientific pseudo philosophical pop science books aimed at white male college undergraduates who are majoring in business but tell everyone on the Internet that they major in STEM (mstrracelol) so they can join in with making fun of the STARBUCKS employee who is OBVIOUSLY a \"liberal arts\" major. This is the kind of FILM that makes one a better father. These films are most easily identified by their use of meticulous cinematography, the kind where every single frame that doesn't have a pirating website's watermark overlaid on it can be printed out and hung up in your bedroom at your parents house to impress your TF2 league with your awesome sense of minimalist design and, of course, use of colour (totally a brit lol murika). Actually you know who makes a lot of these kinds of movies is Marvel. Have you seen their stuff lately? Marvel doesn't even make superhero MOVIES anymore, they make genre FILMS. For example, Captain America. The Winter Soldier. is a political thriller. Thor 2 is a Shakespearean drama. Iron Man 3 is a psychological thriller. Ant Man is a mac and me parody. Btw, check out this gif here: macandmewheelchairgif.jiff. Guardians of the Galaxy may as well be the pull out method genre it was so risky lol.\nFucking total trash. You know the type. These MOVIES (not even going to honour (brit spelling lol fuck Comcast) them with the title \"film\") are the kind of movie M. Night Shamalamadingdong would make nowadays. Btw, did you know he ruined the last Airbender? I like to pretend that movie doesn't even exist lol XD. Oh wait, I'm talking about it right now. Hunh. Weird. Fuck Tyler Perry. Anyways. These movies are the kinds of movies that don't use color and don't use cinematography. They certainly aren't MINIMALIST by any means. These trash movies will have tons of Michael Bayesque explosions everywhere. Speaking of which, fuck Michael Bay. He made movies about robot transformers that SUCKED and so he SUCKS because he RUINED MY CHILDHOOD. These movies will not further science at all, and maybe even singlehandedly regress science back to where it was when my stupid fundie mom was in college learning WRONG facts like \"we only use 10% of our brains.\" Speaking of which, FUCK LUCY. I hate this movie so much. It's the perfect example of a TRASH FILM. it had so many problems. First, WE DON'T JUST USE 10% OF OUR BRAINS, ALSO IF WE USED 100% THAT WOULD BE A SEIZURE AMIRITE. Second, they made GOD himself (fuck fundies who believe in gOD, btw) say this stupid incorrect fact. Third, ScarJo. ScarJo ScarJo ScarJo. I paid to see you in Avengers. I paid to see you in Iron Man 2. I paid to see you in Captain America. The Winter Soldier. Finally, I paid to see you in Lucy. And guess what. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN NAKED ON SCREEN FOR ME ONCE. I deserve at this point to see you naked, and it's offensive to me that you won't do this. I hope the Fappening 2 happens to you. That'll teach you to make trash films that say we only use 10% of our brains but if we did use 100% that would be a seizure amirite. Anyways. Trash movies. These movies actually don't have to be watched to be identified and categorized, but should you choose to try, these movies are most easily identified by their use of SHITTY CGI. Fuck the Hobbit. Fuck Peter Jackson.\nMovies that are just fun. This is a more subtle category of film. These films can only be identified through a complex process that involves other people. First, you have to watch the movie. If you enjoy it, you may be ready to ask yourself \"does this movie fit in the Epic Mind Fuck category or in the Movies that are Just Fun category? Only one way to tell. You have to log on to reddit, and browse your way over to /r/movies[1] , where many of the world's top minds in cinematography congregate, and wait. Wait for this movie to be brought up. When it is, and you see other people trying to shit all over the movie, and put it in the Fucking Trash Movie category, that's when you know. This movie, while yeah honestly it's not that great anyway, and the CGI is bad and the acting is bad and other people on /r/movies[2] find it to be a bad movie and really yeah you know it's bad, THIS MOVIE is really just fun. You need to then let the other /r/movies[3] denizens know that this movie is honestly just fun so that the conversation will shift in that direction. The movies, which are honestly just fun, that fit into this category are most easily identified by browsing /r/movies[4] and waiting to be told (which will not be a long wait) what these movies are, which is honestly just fun. Furthermore, placing a movie into this category completely absolves the movie of any and all critical evaluation, so don't try to come at me with your explanations of the faults in the cinematography. The cinematography is just fun.\nNot a Movie but Breaking Bad Finally, as an /r/movies[5] subscriber and long time cinephile, THIS is my favorite category. This category of FILM includes such masterpieces of cinematography and use of colour (fuck Comcast) as Breaking Bad, True Detective, and other great films. A movie that would fit into this category would be most easily identified through the following process. First, you watch the movie. Then, you reflect back on it. Was your mind fucked? If yes, then the next step is to ask yourself this question: When I pirated this film, did it come in one complete continuous stream of film, or did I have to pirate it one segment at a time where each segment was maybe an hour long and had their own titles and arranged in an episodic nature? If yes, then congratulations, you have found a great movie! Well, not a movie, but Breaking Bad. This is truly the best category of film out there. In fact that's why I spend most of my time on /r/ movies advocating for more films to be made as, instead of films, HBO miniseries. Actually you know what would be a great HBO miniseries? Deadpool. Deadpool really only works if it has an R rating. If it doesn't have an R rating, then I won't go see it. Also it needs to have a PG13 rating and only be allowed to say \"fuck\" once, so I can nominate it on /r/AskReddit[6] for the title of a NotaMovie,butBreakingBad with the best use of its single PG13 \"fuck.\" That fuck should be when daredevil looks at the camera, BREAKING THE 4TH WALL, to say \"fuck Comcast.\"\nIf you liked my analysis, you should check out these great films, Moon (1994), The I N T E R S T E L L O R, and The Avengers 3, which I will be pirating in 2019, since I'm a true cinephile.\"\n\nWasn't disappoint", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422807818", "subreddit": "Braveryjerk", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, it matters very much!\n\nI suppose you've heard of tension and release in music and are aware how they affect your choice of chords and notes in melodies. For example, in your A B C B A melody, the tonal center is on A, so every note except A has some tension in it that is released when you return to A.\n\nLikewise, rhythms can have tension and release, and a big part of where they get their tension and release comes from which beats they start and end on in the middle of a measure. A simple example of a rhythm with a lot of tension is one that is syncopated so that each note starts on an upbeat - regardless of which notes are being played, the rhythm will sound unresolved until one of its notes finally lands on the beat again.\n\nIn a given time signature, the most consonant beat is the first beat of any measure. The second most consonant beat is usually the precise middle of the measure (such as the third beat in 4/4). Any rhythms that start or end on an upbeat instead of a downbeat typically have the most tension.\n\nTo analyze your example, if the melody A B C B A starts on the first beat of a measure, then the first A starts out sounding even more consonant and the final A starts out sounding even more resolved (because it, too, is on the first beat of a measure). However, if the melody starts on the third beat, the first A will already sound somewhat unresolved, and when the final A is played in the middle of the next measure, there will be some pull for melody to continue for a couple more beats into the following measure, making the melody somewhat rhythmically dissonant.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422814697", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't know much about Modest Mouse, so I can't help you there. Hip-hop is a little more in my wheelhouse, especially considered I used to only listen to nerdcore and made the jump to \"proper\" hip-hop, so I kinda know how it goes.\n\nFirst and foremost, come to /r/hiphopheads! There are plenty of recommended albums and talk about good music. \n\nSo based on you liking Mega Ran, I'll give you *five* non-nerdcore album selections that you might like, with *one* song from each linked on Youtube.\n\n**Aesop Rock - None Shall Pass** - Aesop Rock is an amazing backpacker/alternative rapper who releases consistently good music, both from a production standpoint and from a purely lyrical standpoint. his vocabulary is absolutely insane, and his delivery/flow is killer. Give it a listen. [Aesop Rock - None Shall Pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEBGCOCxLgA) (I think this is censored, sorry!)\n\n**King Geedorah - Take Me To Your Leader** - King Geedorah is one alias of (in)famous underground rapper MF Doom. TMTYL is an album comprised almost entirely of samples from the old Godzilla films, where Doom takes on the persona of King Ghidorah. The album tells a story from front to back. Production on this thing is absolutely jaw-dropping, and the samples are almost flawless. [King Geedorah - Fazers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRn9BRo4Igw) (This beat is L E G E N D A R Y)\n\n**Open Mike Eagle - Dark Comedy** - Open Mike Eagle has a feature on the latest MC Frontalot album, *Bedtime Stories* (which is also worth a listen, but I said no nerdcore, so you can find that at your own speed), so he lends himself to a transition from nerdcore to non-nerdcore. *Dark Comedy* was my favorite hip-hop release of 2014 and, oddly enough, features a different producer on every track. The weirdest part of that is how *cohesive* the album feels, even knowing every beat was made by someone different. Mike's rapping is really unique, weaving together some really funny things and some really dark things, culminating in an album where his kinda goofy but sincere personality shines. [Open Mike Eagle feat. Hannibal Buress - Doug Stamper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0ONZSz-y8w) (not my favorite song on the album, but Hannibal's verse is the best verse of 2014)\n\n**Demon Days - Gorillaz** - The one band that unites the indie hipsters, the hip-hop heads, the rock fans, and everyone in between. *Demon Days* is an absolutely phenomenal album start to finish, featuring some amazing features by equally amazing rappers on maybe a third of the songs. However, you really need to listen to the whole thing. [Gorillaz - Dirty Harry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gonPVgjIF6w) (Yeah, I *could* link Feel Good Inc, but I'm not)\n\n**Perfect Hair - Busdriver** - Another rapper who has collabed with Frontalot, and is also friends with and in the same collective (Hellfyre Club) as Open Mike Eagle. Busdriver has a really weird delivery, always feeling like he's barely holding onto the beat, but his energy is insane and the production is consistent from start to finish. This was another of the best releases of 2014, and is similar to *Dark Comedy*, but with less comedy and more \"serious\" rap. [Busdriver feat. Aesop Rock and Danny Brown - Ego Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTxDEu1mw68) (Yeah, the same Aesop Rock as the first album! The other feature, Danny Brown, is another favorite of mine, but his stuff is a bit less accessible)\n\nFeel free to comment or message me with any questions!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422836120", "subreddit": "ifyoulikeblank", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It would otherwise be E A D G C F. At E A D G B E, you always take the perfect fourth, except the B is a triad. To put it in easier terms, start with E, skip 5 frets, you'll get A, skip 5 frets you'll get D, skip 5 frets, you'll get G, it isn't the odd one, the odd one is the B, cause you'll skip 4 frets this time. If you always skip 5 you'll get the tuning I was talking about, but they skipped only 4 to make the guitar more comfortable  to play with, which is the point I was making, the standard tuning it self is also a tuning altered to make the guitar easier to play.\n\nEDIT: I suppose you could play with any tuning you like, just let your ears decide if it's right or off.

Sometimes from ourselves , we notice something strange and then we spend a big amount of time investigating, sometimes from the community, someone else notices something strange and our whole investigation focuses on that, sometimes from even Overkill, with posts/tweets/comment that might actually mean anything, or from completely irrelevant easter eggs in-game.\n\nAnd so far our only clues is the \"Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder where you are\" and \"In top of my tree, there is a star\". I can seriously explain both of them in more than 20 plausible ways in-game. This doesn't help us at all. \n\nAlso, I strongly believe that this time are more than 1 secret. Yes there is The Secret but in order to get there and find all the clues you would have to complete other smaller secrets. Not just decode a static message etc. I can only speculate at this point and create crazy theories in my head (Oh did anyone tried to open the deposit boxes under the letter B A L D W I N only?How many tiles are in the Diamond heist?Does it look like a chessboard?Where is the curator in the Diamond heist?Why the first image from Bain's Guide fits with the image in Rats and how do these connect?Christ resurrecting?Pistol Messiah?Does this goes that deep?Not just gold masks but skills also?Did you notice that the number 12 has some significance?Main menu there is 12 on the dollar bill, Cagliostro's book has 12 chapters, there are 12 engines in Big Oil, the bus on day 3 rats is 2136, 2+1+3+6=12, max amount of bags in firestarter day 1 is 12, or I'm just going nuts with the numbers.) Speculations, Speculations, Speculations. We need facts.\n\nYes I don't want Overkill to tell me \"Hey, look you just have to press F to unlock the secret\". But give me something to work on. I don't mind If I have to read the actual book from Calgiostro for example, but I wanna know that something lead me there and it's not just another waste of time. \n\nWhatever, I will keep looking around in hope of something.

{"body": "Skillbuild: W E W E W R W Q E E R Q Q Q S R\n\nItembuild: Bottle -&gt; Boots -&gt; TP -&gt; Blink Dagger -&gt; Power Treads, then items according to situation, most often that is Hex first (against Physical carries very nice) then Orchid (very nice if you want to disable keyspells, excellent alternative to a BKB), then Skadi.\nAlso very often a Euls Scepter in between whenever I need it (usually to cancel enemy silences, I look if they start to build Orchids, for example QoP, Storm, Clinkz, Invoker often do, then I immediately start buying a Euls, also good against other silences). Situationally a Heart, Diffusal Blade or BKB but those are rare. Euls is better most of the time. Oh and Shiva's Guard is really good/core against Illusion based heroes (or manta's, such as Anti-Mage) and against Brood.\n\nI play him exclusively on mid, try to keep eyes on minimap as much as possible, #1 priority isn't farm, it's staying alive. Same goes for clashes. Both Astral Imprisonment as well as Blink Dagger are primarily used defensively (often on myself), also make sure you don't overextend which happens very easily if you are impatient as me. Try to always stand at the edge of the fight, often use blink dagger to reposition yourself to be on the edge again, b out a little if necessary, you should never stand between two enemies ever. Also in the early game it's better if you use your ultimate early to get a kill faster than saving it and possibly dying or missing out on a kill. In all stages of the game Sanity's Eclipse isn't really your key spell, it's more of a finishing move I would say.\n\nBefore you blink + Astral initiate on an enemy hero always think what would happen. It's very good to get some additional Astral stacks before a clash (for example while seaching the enemy base), but make sure they can't pick you off.\n\nSkadi is usually a very good choice against BKBs. If you feel like their BKBs are a big problem you might want to buy Skadi before Orchid (or even skip orchid altogether). However, never join a clash early. Make sure the enemy players can't focus you, make sure you are not taking part of the clash while important spells (like Chronosphere) are still up or BKBs are active or at least be extra careful in those situations. With Euls + Astral + Dagger you can survive almost everything, which makes this combo extremely good in late game.\n\nSome special cases:\n\n- Skip Astral Imprisonment until level 9 when you lane against Razor and pay extra attention to the map to not get ganked\n\n- buy a Gem immediately when the enemy Nyx reaches level 6\n\n- buy sentry wards very early if they have a roaming Bounty Hunter\n\n- Don't trade hits with Viper unless you got him to 13 mana\n\n- SF can kill you with 2 razes most of the time so be extra careful!\n\n- if they have a Nether ward up, you can still participate in the clash, just deactivate autocast and don't use other spells offensively (especially not your ulti!)\n\n- Beware blink initiators! (Axe, Magnus, Void, Tide, Earth Shaker) Remember, you can easily rape any of them as long as you stay outside the clash for a little while. Helping your team mates by suiciding for them never works out! (This is very different from Phoenix play for example)\n\n- You can't Astral + Blink out of Shrapnel and Rot, being the only DoT's that you can't blink escape. You can Astral + Blink from Rupture without taking damage!\n\n- If there is an annoying Mirana/Pudge roaming, it is best practice to just bait their arrows (just afk stand in a place and wait for it to come) instead of last hitting and persistently watching your map. It gives you the cooldown-time of the spell as free time, it costs them precious mana and it makes it more likely for them to give up.\n\n- Against Techies, get a Gem immediately after Blink Dagger.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422924034", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 48, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, so what I mean by a key is essentially (for the purpose of this explanation), the note you start a melody on. You can sing the same melody in different keys. Try singing twinkle twinkle little star starting from the note C (let's call this key C). The notes you sing for each syllable (twin-kle twin-kle li-ttle star) should be: C-C G-G A-A G. If you start at D (which we'll call key D), you should sing D-D A-A B-B A. This is an example of the same melody (whether you start on C or D, it's still recognizable as twinkle twinkle little star) in two different keys. \n\nWhen you sang \"in a li-ttle tent\" in the song, the notes you sang were D F G-A F. However, you should have sang D F F-G D. Because you ended on the note F instead of D, you were in the wrong place on the musical scale. You didn't realise your mistake, and continued on from F, and you sang the following note in relation to that F, instead of the D. \n\nIt's like if you were singing twinkle twinkle little star from key C, but went from C to A instead of C to G, but then continued on to B and back to A (like C-C A-A B-B A). Note that the sequence of notes A A B B A is the same as the sequence of notes after D if you had started in the key of D (D-D A-A B-B A). This means when you went from C to A instead of C to G, you switched from key C to key D. This is what you did in your recording.\n\nNo, I don't have any formal musical education besides a music appreciation class I had to take as a freshman, but I have a good ear and so I can notice these things and understand what's wrong. \n\nIf you're still confused, I think it's best to ask someone else, because I'm not an expert. I dumbed the concept of keys down a tad to make it easier to explain, so I may have told you some technically wrong stuff if you take it literally so don't let this be your whole education- learn more!\n\nListening to music can allow you to get better with this kind of stuff, especially when you really pay attention to the notes and such. \n\nLastly, I don't know if you could tell, but you also started of the song in a different key than Sam Cooke sang it. This is fine, because you are more comfortable in that range, but you have to stay in the same key once you choose it.

{"body": "All of this sounds wrong.  But remember, migraines and severe headaches that present 'normally' are wrong too.  I don't believe and don't think doctors believe that our heads are supposed to hurt as bad as they do.\n\nYou definitely need to see a Neurologist.  Maybe even more than one.  And ENT sounds like a good start.  And I am hoping that if you haven't already begun having tests that you have an MRI and other tests to rule out certain things and help you find a diagnosis.  FYI, I have had some really scary symptoms similar to what you described with a major migraine, and many of us here have as well.  You are not alone.\n\nMy headaches and migraines began when I was young and became daily when I was about .  My parents are strange about illness, 10.  My parents didn't really 'allow' us or accept us to ever be sick and it took my parents f o r e v e r to even agree to take me a doctor.  The asshole doctor essentially told my parents that kids my age don't get migraines and that I must be seeking attention and acting melodramatic.  I am quite a bit older than you are and I think not only did I encounter a terrible doctor/person/ignorant medical professional, but I also know times have changed and there is better information and education now on the subject of head pain.\n\nYou should really keep a headache journal that records anything, everything and as much detail about your life, your pain, your meds--basically way more information than you probably will feel like you have time to do.  My teenage daughter uses an app on her Iphone to keep this journal.  She records the usual things like what she eats, how she feels when she wakes, what meds she takes. .  . (Google for the wide range of info you should record and record as much as you can as you never know what obscure piece of info may help you discover a trigger or something that might help your situation).\n\nFor my kid, using an app makes recording her info much easier.  She discovered some maybe weird things by doing this.  She has long thick hair and has even figured out that when she wears a particular hair style she tends to have more head pain.  Document document document.  \n\nI also had her doc give her a thorough and extremely complete exam and it helped to uncover one thing we had NO idea she was dealing with.  Specifically, my child has never once in her entire life shown a single sign of having any kind of problem with allergies.  Never a single indication she had any problem with this.  But a simple look into her nose made the doctor comment, 'Wow, your nose looks terrible!).  We put her on a daily OTC allergy med and her daily headaches decreased by about 75%!  OTC allergy meds are not a big deal for almost anyone to take, so trying it wasn't a big risk and the results after only a few days were amazing!  See every doctor you can, get everything looked at, prodded, poked and checked out that you can.  Even if it is just a regular doc who gives you a thorough exam and asks a lot of questions.  \n\nBy having a lot of documentation, your doctor will hopefully be better able to help you getting diagnosed.  And since you may be in a situation where you are dependent on your parents for some sort of help, perhaps any 'proof' you can generate will help them to understand.\n\nIf you do need their help and/or support.  Please feel free to push for it.  YOU ARE YOUR OWN BEST ADVOCATE.  When suffering from pain and scary symptoms, it is really hard to advocate for ourselves--we simply don't have all the same kinds of skills and strength as we might if we were not physically ill and most likely feel quite vulnerable from it.  Do your best to stick up for yourself.  \n\nI feel a lot of empathy for you and have written this wall of text as your post touches me due to my parents being such assholes about my chronic illness.  I showed them though. . . I have been in pain daily for well over thirty years!  Just a joke. . . I would obviously much rather have just been an attention-seeking child!\n\nAnd this sub is an amazing place to get support, information, and bounce ideas around.  Before I found this place I honestly had no idea there were so many people that experienced all that I experience in my life.\n\nGood luck.  Keep us posted.  Stay strong.  Stick up for yourself.  INSIST on not letting your issues be ignored or belittled.  You deserve to feel better.  You deserve help. :)\n\nTake care!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1422991656", "subreddit": "migraine", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Luckbox- here! I don't use that account anymore. I was on my iPad last night. \n\nLet's talk about Nidalee. I'm just going to answer OP's questions but feel free to ask me anything I don't cover. I'm going to assume anyone reading this is a new Nidalee.  \n\nLaning with Nidalee can be tough. If you don't know what you're doing you will feel weak and completely useless. Start Q unless you feel like you need to dodge a skillshot, in which case start W for your pounce. (Ahri Q, Xerath Q, Leblanc W, etc.) But you should be able to dodge those already. Focus on getting all 6 cs and throw a q out if they try to trade. If you are laning against a melee champion auto attack. 40 damage doesn't seem like much but you can take them to half health if they don't respect it. The more you auto attack the less they'll be focused on dodging your Q, which is good for you. At level 2 train W and land a Q, if you land and can trade with them, R, use your pounce, Q them, and auto, then W back out dodging whatever they throw at you. Nidalee is all about knowing when to be aggressive. Your cougar form abilities cost no mana and have very short cd's so bait out ability's (Ahri Charm, Annie stun, Xerath stun, etc.) This is something I never see happen. You can easily W off to the side to dodge.  Your full combo is human form Q R w e q w  R then E to heal yourself. If it is an all in I like to E before I jump on my enemies for the attack speed boost. It can win a fight. Another tip is know your cool downs. Learn them by heart. You should be able to switch to human form and cougar form using all ability's. If you want to watch a really amazing Nidalee I would check out CJ Entus. He's an incredible Nidalee and I learned everything from watching him. Also max Q then E then w. \n\nBuild path is simple. I get first item Morello, CDR boots, Hourglass, then either void if they build early Mr or Deathcap. Lichbane is a good item but only when you need the wave clear. You really don't need it for your Q anymore because of the runes you will take. We'll talk about that later. If you are losing hard to an AP enemy get Athene's instead of Morello. \n\nTeam fighting with Nidalee is super easy. Don't miss spears. Seriously. If you can land a few long range Q's they will be forced to retreat. You are like any other assassin in the game so don't just jump in and get yourself killed. Wait for a good engage and simply do your combos in and out. That is your main thing. You don't want to hop in and go completely ham. Land a Q chunk them down, get out, rinse repeat. Your targets should be either the adc or any enemy that will fuck up your team. I just played a game against an enemy Galio. My teammates got constantly trapped in his ultimate so I landed a long range Q full combo to eliminate him. I did take a lot of damage but it kept my team from being CC'd and we won the fight. Pick your target and kill that target. Nidalee can delete any squishy. \n\nThat's my 10 minute type up for Nidalee. Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll do my best to answer them. Also sorry if my grammar is janky I'm on my iPad. Feel free to ask me about any match ups and I'll explain them. \n\nEdit:Here is CJ Entus Shy doing work. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3KUoEmCoo\n\nEdit: http://www.probuilds.net/guide/NA/1654131686/20533973 Runs and masteries.

{"body": "Can you read standard notation? If not, time to learn. Don't worry, it's pretty easy. Basic primer: Just remember the spaces. For treble, it's FACE. For bass, it's ACEG. Now, count. Each space and line is a different note. If it's on the line above the bottom space, F is the first space, so the line above it is a G. If it's in the space above the top line, E is the top space, so F is the top line, the space above it is a G. If there are sharps or flats at the beginning right after the treble clef, every note matching that space will be sharp/flat. Ie. If the top line has a sharp on it, every F in the piece will be sharp. There are exceptions to this. If you see a natural symbol (♮), don't play that note sharp/flat for the rest of the measure.\n\nFind the lowest note for the entire piece. If it's D or up, you can play around the low frets. If it's lower than a D, you'll have to either retune or move things up above the 5th frets. Now, just figure how what notes are to be played and figure how where to those notes are on the neck and play them. The note will appear multiple places on the neck so picking which one to play will be part interpretation and part easy of play. I usually find it easier to figure out the easiest way to play the notes and then go back and fix the rhythm.\n\nTo get you started, the second measure are these notes: A G E D E G D. See if you can figure out how to play those notes in that order.\n\nFor chords, you do the same thing except you play multiple notes at once. Usually, you'll need to get the notes from multiple staffs. Most of the time, due to the nature of the banjo, you'll have to ignore some notes depending on what other instruments are playing and what can be implied by the notes you do play, so a lot of it will come down to interpretation.

{"body": "Sure!\n\nSomething Eric Johnson and Joe Bonamassa do often is use 5 note scale groupings. So think of any scale in sets of five degrees.\n\nFor example if you are playing in C major, the scale is C D E F G A B C. If you go up five notes, then start another sequence from the next degree. For example C D E F G, D E F G A, E F G A B...\n\nBonamassa and EJ commonly use the minor pentatonic scales with these same sorts of groupings, often with neato economy picking schemes to go with it. Check out measure 14 on this Cliffs of Dover tab.\n\nhttp://guitaralliance.com/songs/J/johnson_eric/cliffs_of_dover/johnson_eric-cliffs_of_dover.pdf\n\nHe plays the first note, then the rest of the measure is groups of 5. These are played as quintuplets, or 5 notes jammed into one beat. Count this measure 1 ol li and ol li 2 ah ver si ty 3 ah ver si ty 4 ah ver si ty 5 ah ver si ty. It's weird, I know.\n\nAnother way (much more useful, to most non-musicians quintuplets are kinda weird) to use the groups of five as plain ol' 16ths, like 1 e  + ah 2 e + ah 3 e + ah 4 e + ah. 4 notes per beat on the metronome. The weird part about this is starting new groups of notes (and sequences of picking and/or legato stuff) which you're doing every *five* sixteenths. So like ONE e and ah two E and ah three e AND ah four e and UH. This sort of stuff is all over Cliffs of Dover, and EJ/JB's playing.\n\nWhen I mentioned the economy picking stuff, those guys do this neat thing where they change through adjacent strings with 2 downstrokes. So D U D U D, D U D U D. A teeny tiny sweep/economy pick between two strings to make for an easier change in direction.\n\nWatch Cracking the Code, there's a great episode about EJ's picking technique, that whole series is amazing.

Start now, all this stuff takes years of work.\n\nI would start with the basics. Learn major and minor scales (not to mention modes, melodic minor, other scales), arpeggios, intervals and the circle of fifths. Make sure you ALWAYS know what note you're playing. A good tip I have is learning all your scales up and down single strings and playing them with one finger. Play them slowly and say the notes out loud as you say them. Be able to do this in all 12 keys. \n\nDo you know how chord symbols are derived? It's a pretty simple system that relates back to the scale. For instance, maj6 is a major triad with an added (major) 6 scale degree.\n\nA C major scale is:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 **6** 7\n\nC D E F G **A** B\n\n\nA Cmaj triad is:\n\n1 3 5\n\nC E G\n\nAnd a Cmaj**6** chord is:\n\n1 3 5 **6**\n\nC E G **A**\n\nYou could work out all the different chord types this way in different keys.\n\nIt might be helpful to learn some of this stuff at the piano because you can visualize where the notes are at the keyboard. Or buy a book too. A music fundamentals book would be a good place to start, or a jazz theory book. People talk about Mark Levine's jazz theory book, but I've never used that. It's pretty thick and might be overwhelming. For some guitar books for people new to jazz, see my post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Woodshed/comments/2u9lgb/what_are_some_good_resources_for_someone/co7kw6l).

{"body": "Welcome! You'll have to get used to crafting recipes but that won't take long. You can also check the minecraft wiki. Sorry for the wall of text, but I love Minecraft and I want you to love it too. Some of this stuff might be obvious to you already.\n\nThings you should know:\n\nTap ctrl key while moving forward to begin sprinting, you can also just double tap W but I prefer the ctrl key method.\n\nHold shift to sneak slowly, you cannot fall off edges while sneaking. This is very helpful if you're building something very high above the ground.\n\nHold tab to see a list of players currently on the server you are on.\n\nPress T to type a message for other players. This is also where commands are entered beginning with /\n\nTips for inventory management:\n\nShift clicking: Shift clicking on a stack of items will make them jump between your hotbar and inventory, or between your inventory and a chest you have open.\n\nRight clicking: Right clicking on stacks in your inventory will split the stack in half.\n\nHotbar keys: Keys 1-9 correspond to the slots on your hotbar, you can use these keys to switch quickly between items in your hotbar. You can also hover your mouse over items in your inventory and hit any hotbar key to quickly move that item to that hotbar slot. My personal preference is to rebind some of those keys to make them easier to reach, keys 5-9 I have rebound to keys Q R F X C. Q is normally drop but I never use it so I've moved it to the other side of the keyboard.\n\nClick and drag with items: When you're holding items with your mouse cursor at a crafting table, you can click and drag those items over the different slots to evenly distribute those items into the slots you've dragged over. Right clicking in the same fashion will place single items. This makes crafting a lot quicker.\n\nOther stuff:\n\nBeing on PC you have access to the Nether. You probably already know some stuff about this. Build a frame from obsidian and light the inside with a flint and steel to make a portal. The frame must be at least 2 wide and 3 tall on the inside. You can use the nether kind of like a fast travel by making multiple portals, traveling one block within the nether is equal to traveling 8 in the over world.\n\nThere's some more stuff that's a bit complicated to describe here that you should look up on the wiki:\n\nRedstone circuitry and pistons/hoppers/droppers/dispensers\n\nThe End\n\nEnchanting\n\nPotion brewing\n\nBeacons\n\nOcean Monuments\n\nNeed a server to play on? Check out /r/mcservers. Most have \"plugins\" (server side mods that require no editing of your client, usually simple things like shop mods, teleporting, chest locking, land ownership, etc). Some servers require modpacks which make the game much more complicated, I'd avoid these until you're more comfortable. Pure vanilla (no mods/plugins) servers are a bit less popular.\n\n[](/enderslayer) Now get out there and have fun :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423035659", "subreddit": "Minecraft", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay so linear harmonies are good fun to work with and to know how to do this we need to understand a few musical concepts.\n\n(just a quick note without an instrument by you, this reply will probably be of no use)\n\nThe two most important for understanding and working out your own harmonies are:\nScales and Chord Composition\n\nTo keep things very very simple take all these examples as being in Cmajor, this key has no sharps or flats and on a piano or keyboard is played using only the white keys. \n\nSo, our scale is made of seven notes which when written out look like this:\n**C D E F G A B**\nto help us with chord theory we're going to number each of these notes as \"Degrees of the scale\" where C is 1 D is 2 etc...\n\nAnother concept you may wish to look further into is \"Diatonic Harmony\" which essentially means \"of the scale\". In a more basic sense, if I am composing in Cmajor I will exclusively use only the notes in the key signature.\n\nHow does this relate to vocal harmonies? \n\nThe thing that ties it together really is chords.\n\nOn it's own a vocal melody is simply a single note melody, however when you harmonise that melody you essentially build over it the same way you would a chord, with more complicated harmonies such as 3 or 4 part harmonies you're essentially building extended chords over a vocal line.\n\nConfused enough yet? Cool, it may take a couple of reads and some questions to make sense of this....\n\nSo back to our Cmajor scale\n\n**C D E F G A B** (C)\n\nTo build basic chords (known as tonic triads) we simply take one note, miss one, then take the next, miss one, then take the next.\n\nReferring to the degrees of the scale our first chord from the above would be C E G or 1 3 5, this makes a Cmajor chord\n\nWith this in mind, we'll take a simple vocal line and harmonise it to make a 2 part harmony. for this one we'll keep it simple and harmonise to a 3rd above.\n\nOnce again, because we're starting simple with diatonic harmony remember these are the notes we're using. C D E F G A B\n\nHere's a basic melody: **C G G F E F E D C D E D E F E C E D** \n(which just so happens to be the guitar line from the Top Gun theme)\n\nWhat we'll do now is take the notes from that melody and use the chordal harmony technique of referring to our start note, missing a note, then taking the next note to harmonise the entire line to a 3rd.\n\nWith this in mind you should end up with\n\n**Melody line**:         C G G F E F E D -  C D E D E F E C E D \n\n**Harmonised line**:  E B B A G A G F -  E F G F G A G E G F", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423051610", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, that's a lot. I'll try to address as much as I can....\n\nScales: The idea is to internalize the sounds of the scales.  This takes a long time and goes beyond just memorizing the fingerings.  Start small.  Focus on the major scale and its modes.  You want those solidly under your fingers before you go messing with altered scales and whatnot.  Modes used as chord scales are really just a way to focus your attention on the important notes in relation to the current scale.  So you can play Cmaj7 Amin7 Dmin7 G7 and never leave the C major scale but unless you are focusing on the guide tones of each chord and notes that help to emphasize the transition from one chord to the next it won't sound like much.  The better way to get started on playing changes is to focus on arpeggios.  It's less notes to think about while soloing.  Use the chord tone to solo and then try out scalar or even chromatic notes to approach the chord tones in the next chord.\n\nSpeaking of, Arpeggios:  A good way to practice arps is within the context of a song.  Autumn leaves would be fine.  Go very slowly and play up and down an arp for the duration of the chord in the song.  When you get to the next chord move to the closest chord tone of the next chord and continue in the same direction or reverse direction depending on location on the neck.  So for the first two chords of Autumn Leaves in E minor playing quarter notes, you'd have A C E G | A C D F# or if you re reversing A C E G | F# D C A and continue through the song similarly.\n\nComping: Don't over think this when you are just getting started.  Yes, you probably don't need to voice notes on the low E as it can get muddy but there's nothing wrong with the higher strings.  Pianists should not be comping at the same time as you.  Voicing the melody on top is good for developing solo arrangements but if someone else is playing the melody then that is not a great approach.  Try limiting the number of voicings you are working with and focus first and foremost on rhythm.  Think about how a drummer comps with the snare drum.  Those kind of simple ideas and accents are how you want to approach it.  Check out pianists too: Wynton Kelly and Red Garland come to mind.  For extensions, you are usually safe adding 7ths, 6ths, and 9ths.  11ths, 13ths, and altered extensions are more context specific.  A #11 sounds good on a I major 7 chord, but only sometimes. This just takes experimentation and experience.  Altered extensions are usually safe on the diatonic dominant chord.\n\n\nThat's all I have time to write for now but I'll try to come back and address the other points later.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423064015", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yes, this is a very good video.\n\nTo further understand the modes you have to understand the Harmonized Major Scale.  Take the key of C Major.  It contains the notes:\n\n**C D E F G A B**\n\nNow to harmonize the scale, meaning make chords out of the notes, you start on any note, skip the next note, use the next note, skip the next note, and use the next note.  So starting on the notes C you get:\n\n**C E G** (**C** D **E** F **G** A B)\n\nThe notes **C E G** make a C major chord.\n\nNow we start on the note D:\n\n**D F A** (**D** E **F** G **A** B C)\n\nThat makes a D Minor chord.  If we do this for all of the notes in the scale we get the following chords:\n\nC Major\n\nD Minor\n\nE Minor\n\nF Major\n\nG Major\n\nA Minor\n\nB Diminished\n\nNow for the modes.  Since all of these chords are formed from the notes in the C Major scale, we can play the C major scale over every single one of these chords.  \n\nIf you play the C Major scale over a C Major chord, you get the C Ionian mode which is just a fancy name for the major scale.  But if you play the C Major scale over a D Minor chord, you aren't playing C Major anymore.  You're playing D Dorian.  If you play the C Major scale over and E Minor chord, you're playing E Phrygian.  The C Major scale over an F Major chord is F Lydian.  C Major over a G Major chord is G Mixolydian.  C Major over an A Minor chord is A Aeolian.  C Major over a B diminished chord is B Locrian.\n\nThis is why you'll here people say things like Mixolydian is the 5th mode of the major scale.  What that means is that it is related to the 5th chord of the scale (Which in the key of C is G Major).\n\nI often simply loop one chord on my loop pedal and play a mode over it to burn the sound into my head.  Play a G7 chord on the loop pedal and play the C Major scale over it and you'll get the Mixolydian sound in your head (You'll probably think you're playing in the Grateful Dead).  Play a D Minor chord and play the C Major scale over it and you're playing in the Dorian mode.

An incredible Indie/Hipster album, don't listen though if you already have a prerogative towards pretentious sounding music. Incredibly progressive though in sound and content. \n\n**Perfume Genius** - *Too Bright* - Waited way too long to give this a listen. Such a great 2014 release. Queen and Grid are some of the best songs of the year, without a doubt.\n\n**Joey Badass** - *B4.DA.$$* - I know I'm gonna catch flak for this, and already have, but I liked Joey's debut wayyyyyyy more than Lupe's album. Did not like the latter at all. But B4.DA.$$ really surprised me because I went into it not expecting anything, more typical street raps, and got a kid who can juggle both the gritty 90's sound with the soulful side.\n\n**The Avalanches** - *Since I Left You* - An undeniable classic. If you're a fan of any genre this is a must listen, it really feels like it encapsulates them all.\n\n**The Microphones** - *The Glow Pt.2* - Just gave this a listen thanks to the /r/IndieHeads essentials thread on it, and I am still trying to wrap my head around it. Such a strangely structured album, but I'm really enjoying it. The opening track is incredible.\n\n**Pixies** - *Doolittle* - Figured it was about time to download the Pixies first albums. I've had the random one-off hits here and there, and knew of a couple more, but I was pleasantly surprised to know that the deep cuts back things up nicely. A fun band having fun playing music, you can't help but to have fun listening along.\n\n**Modest Mouse** - *The Lonesome Crowded West* - One of my favorite albums of all-time. Nuff said.\n\n**Pixies** - *Trompe De Monde* - Same with Doolittle. Haven't been able to tell difference in quality yet, aka which albums are better/worse.\n\n**Bjork** - *Vulnicura* - My favorite album of January 2015 wasn't even scheduled for release then. Really just such a strong, coherent piece from Bjork. It also allowed me to look into her discography, and damn was that a treat.

{"body": "Derp? Really? Because I'd never heard of that before. Please tell me more Mr. Internet!\n\nResponsive design means that you can fine tune the site to look good on any screen - desktop, tablet, phone. This has a font with W I D E letter spacing, way too much line space between lines, too much padding between elements - it's an eyesore at any presentation, in my opinion. There's no cohesiveness, visually - everything is sort of floating away from each other, sections don't look like they want to be together, everything loses it's distinctiveness.\n\nAs an example of a poor design decision - why in earth are those meaningless numbers so EMPHASIZED at the bottom of the page? They don't mean anything to anyone, and yet are the most distinctive feature, the only thing that looks like it has had any typographic attention paid to it. And what is with all of the empty menus at the top of the page? And there's no playful interaction - nothing to give you that tactile pleasure of use - just ON, OFF transitions.\n\nMy professional opinion - it's ugly, space-wasting, unorganized looking, at any size. Seemingly nobody thought much about how the information should be organized and presented. About what's important, what isn't.\n\nWere any analytics used to find out WHY people go to the city website, and make THOSE THINGS the easiest to access?

{"body": "In a basic sense, the chords that are diatonic (meaning all the notes belong) to a given key all come from the major scale. \n\nNow, don't worry about minor scales for a minute. Remember, every major key has a relative minor key (e.g. C major = A minor). The relative keys have all the same notes. So, if you play a C major scale but instead of starting on the C, you start on the A and you end on the A, you just played an A minor scale.\n\nLets look at a C major scale: C D E F G A B\n\nNow, using the scale, lets build triads (basic three note chords) by taking every other note.\n\nStarting on C: C E G\nStarting on D: D F A\nStarting on E: E G B\nStarting on F: F A C\nStarting on G: G B D\nStarting on A: A C E\nStarting on B: B D F\n\nWhat do you notice? Just by taking every other note of the major scale, the triads we get are: C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, B diminished.\n\nThose are all of the chords that belong in the key of C. Seven chords. Those are also all of the chords in the key of Am, because Am is the relative minor key to C major. Now, there are all sorts of ways that we can substitute in other different chords from different keys to add interest and some \"outside\" tones. But don't worry about that for now.\n\nLets replace the notes with numerals. Instead of C D E F G A B, we will have: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.\n\nNotice from what we learned above, the chords built from the 2 (D), 3 (E), and 6 (A) were al minor chords. And the chords built from the 1 (C), 4 (F), and 5 (G) were all major chords. Don't worry about the 7 for now.\n\nSo in any given key, you have 3 major chords (the 1, 4, and 5) and 3 minor chords (the 2, 3, and 6).\n\nIf we write those out as roman numerals and capitalize the major chords, it looks like this:\n\nI ii iii IV V vi vii(dim)\n\nPick up one of these http://www.amazon.com/Chord-Wheel-Ultimate-Tool-Musicians/dp/0634021427/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423165651&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=chord+wheel with this simple tool, you can slide the wheel to whatever key you want to play in, and it will reveal to you which chords belong in that key.\n\nNow, lets add a fourth note to our triads. This forth note is known as the 7th. These are the 7th chords you were talking about. We do it just the same, take the major scale, pick a note to start on, and skip every other note.\n\nStarting on C: C E G B\nStarting on D: D F A C\nStarting on E: E G B D\nStarting on F: F A C E\nStarting on G: G B D F\nStarting on A: A C E G\nStarting on B: B D F A\n\nIf we do that, we get the 7th chords:\n\nCmaj7\nDmin7\nEmin7\nFmaj7\nG7\nAmin7\nBmin7b5\n\nNote, the ii(D) ii(E) and vi(A)are still minor quality chords. And the I and the IV are still major quality chords. The V chord, however, becomes a dominant 7 chord. \n\nHopefully that helps!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423166168", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Is it based on which notes make up the chord? As in any chord made up entirely of notes that fit within the scale will work?\n\nBasically.\n\nWhat's the Em scale? `E F# G A B C D E`\n\nWhat are triads that can be built using those notes?\n\n    E G B  = Em (i)\n    F# A C = F#dim (ii°)\n    G B D  = G (III)\n    A C E  = Am (iv)\n    B D F# = Bm (v)\n    C E G  = C (VI)\n    D F# A = D (VII)\n\nThose are called \"diatonic chords\". Diatonic means \"in the key\". \n\nNow, the first major exception to this  that you'll commonly run into, when playing in a minor key, is the major V chord, in this case B major (B D# F#). Now, we know from the above that D# is not a note in the Em scale, but that dominant chord (V) has a lot of pull to resolve to the tonic (i). \n\nThere's also a variant called the harmonic minor scale which does incorporate the D# instead of the D, so a B major chord would be diatonic to the E harmonic minor scale.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423166571", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Pretty much your build. For support, pop a sighstone in the build.\n\n\n\n&gt;[–]ReallyProAtLife 1 point 8 hours ago \nWhat does Velkoz supp max after Q?\n\n[–]Danface247 2 points 6 hours ago \nOrder is either R Q W E or R W Q E, whichever you prefer. if you're against immobile jinxes, then max w, or just max Q if you're just good at hitting skillshots\n\n------\nIt comes down to preference. W has more damage, and it procs your passive multiple times, so i max it first against immobile opponents.\n\nHowever, it is easily dodgable against anyone with a singe gapcloser. Maxing Q keeps people guessing as to when you will reactivate it, and can really mess up their concentration. It is a little bit easier to score hits against mobile opponents with this ability.\n\nI personally max W against immobile, and Q against mobile, but its preference. If you're good at landing some solid Q's in lane, go for it. The poke is real. If you have trouble with the Q's, W gives great waveclear and damage if you hit your E first.\n\n------\n\nUsing it as a support near the beginning is useful. I use it when my/ their team is trying to take dragon, whether to steal dragon or to discourage the enemy from closing in on my jungler. Same with baron. Dont hesitate to use it for the fear, as it's cooldown is decently short.\n\nWhat I like to do, is when a teamfight is starting, wait for the other team to blow their CC, while hiding in your team for protection. If you have mana sustain, spam Q and W to get some nice poke in. If the adc is out of position, E W W Q Rhim to melt. Even better is if their team clumps together and you get an E on them. This can win whole teamfights if you can get your combo on 2-5 people.\n\n-------\n\nI hope i've got most of your questions. I'm by no means a velkoz main, but i do enjoy him in mid and sometimes bot lane. \n\nHappy melting!\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423179271", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Once you feel you have both hands well trained on single stroke rolls for both RL AND LR at a high bpm, move onto doing double stroke rolls, leading with both hands equally to once again, train weak hand dominance and ambidexterity. RR LL RR LL, and reverse, LL RR LL RR. Do the same thing with double stroke rolls as you would with the single strokes. Start at a slow bpm and work your way up slowly when you feel comfortable with both hands at a set bpm. Then move onto triplets or triple stroke rolls. For this part, i HIGHLY ADVISE that you look up as much information as you can about \"THE MOELLER TECHNIQUE\" on youtube and anywhere else on the internet. Watch everyone and anyones tutorial on how to properly apply the moeller method. The best drummers who use these examples would be: JIM CHAPIN, TONY ROYSTER JR., and JOJO MAYER. Study the everliving FUCK outta that technique because its one of the most diverse and useful tools in a drummers arsenal of techniques and tricks. Then from there, just keep going through all the rudiments and doing the same thing you did with the single, double and triple stroke rolls (slow bpm on metronome, lead with both hands equally until comfortable and then speed up bpm) practice your flams and paradiddles, etc. ANOTHER useful tip is to build forearm strength for quicker chops (speed). A good example would be to practice the same way explained above, but instead of on a practice pad, play on something with little to no rebound (like a pillow). You can also roll up a towel like a hotdog (long ways), and put your hands in the center of the towel next to each other, and twist both hands in opposite directions back and forth as if you were throttling a motorcycle acceleration and alternating with both hands. (It will rip your forearms a new one but build your chops like a mofo). If theres any other questions you may have, feel free to ask and ill do my best to explain and help!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423188591", "subreddit": "drums", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "They can be useful for creating modal sounds in jazz. For example, the famous \"So What\" chords are basically quartal (D G C F A going up). This chord I outlined works fine for a D minor, but instead of emphasizing the traditional important notes in a triad ((root) 3rd (5th) and 7th) quartal voicings tend to sound more modal. For example, the entire first section of \"So What\" is basically just the Dorian mode as the two main sonorities are (E A D G B  and D G C F A). But you know that the modes are all related; they are just major scales beginning on different scale degrees. So if these chords work for D dorian, they will also work for G mixolydian etc; this can be a pretty hip way of voicing 2-5-1s.

This way you won't learn theory on guitar, you will learn theory in general and then can easily apply it to guitar, or any other instrument at that. [This link](http://musictheory.tripod.com/scales.htm) should help you with scales as intervals. Learning intervals is awesome even on a basic image. You stop worrying about frets, and #'s and finger patterns, you just sort of \"know\" where the next note you hear in your head is. The major scale is \"W W H W W W H\" meaning whatever note you start at, the next note is a whole step, then a whole step, then half, then whole, whole whole, then half. Bam major scale to any key, just like how you move your pentatonic scale to the start of whatever root note. The minor scale(which is the 6th degree) is \"W H W W H W W\". What this means is you take that W^1 W^2 H^3 W^4 W^5 W^6 H^7 and go through that starting on the 6th # so its W H (back to the start) W W H W W. It's harder to know on a guitar because instead of staying on one sting, after a note or two you switch to the next string and depending on where the notes lay on that tuned string, the notes are in different spots since there E/F and A/B are a half step apart. \n\nIt's much easier to learn it on a piano/keyboard and then transfer the knowledge over to guitar. It's a thousand times easier to physically see the distance between the notes since you are just going simply left to right, instead of left to right, skip to the next string that tuned differently so now notes are spaced differently. Not saying it isn't possible to learn on a guitar, but the piano is the biggest tool(view it as a tool and not an instrument) you will ever come across when it comes to music. It will also naturally teach your ear to hear notes so along the way you get ear training. The when you hum out a tune, you naturally skip right to the note you have in mind and don't even think about how far away it is from the note you are currently playing and you won't even be thinking scales. It also helps to hum along inside your head or even outloud as you play. This will train your ear to learn intervals and when you hum notes you will jump right to them and you will start to realize how far away and how close these sounds in your head actually are. Everything just makes sense so much on the keys. Knowing your music knowledge would help me help you better too.

I just look at the codes a lot of the time because it's easier, haha.\n\nAnd I'm thinking of collecting Chokato stuffs! I love Chokatos, they make me happy. Even though I don't like tomatos. \n\nThat facepaint looks amazing with the skull contacts actually!

He has never used physical violence, its always been verbal aggression, but if my mum takes responsibility for her own independence (which I hope she does) I guess this panic could be very harmful towards her. Just the fact that she is going to a therapist would make him hostile and, well, use his tricks to make her feel guilty. Then my fear is that she wont even take the step to talk to someone outside the family. She cooks all his food. Cleans all the house. Cuts his hair. Washes his clothes. Buys birthday gifts to us children. She for f** sake even buys the food and he would probably not be able to do even that for himself. This is more then just traditional gender inequality. Sorry, but it makes me angry..\n\nMy first episode was very dramatic. I told my Ndad he was darkness to his face and that he was satan to a former colleague. I said to my parents that they should split up, that I have found someone that my mum could be with. I said too many children are born to figure out meaning in a relationship (their parents) that wasn't meant to be. And I was v e r y firm. I found signs of what I was talking about everywhere, for example in a magazine where it said that children were left out of communication in the family. I shouted to my Ndad that I had been talked over my head when I was young! I also thought I was God, because I was soo full of energy and felt connected with every living being. I thought i could sense what others were thinking and stuff. I laughed or cried one after the other. The other episodes I have had has circled a lot around my circumstanses has not been satisfying or I have found it very hard to get where I want. And it is activated by me obsessing about a potential romantic relationship. If the person of my thought is nice to me I usually don't get ill. I either get to know that person and can give them all the creative energy that builds up in me when I am ready for a change (which seems to be quite fascinating for some) OR if they are being rejecting (I might be a bit obsessive/they might not want a relationship/they are a famous persona that actually doesn't know about my feelings) then I get a mixed bipolar episode that lasts a few days. I have to be hospitalised for about 2 weeks. :/ So that's what I'm scared of. \n\nIt feels good to have found this place. I am very thankful that you want to bounce this topic with me. I feel like my Ndad might find what I've written here. But I know that's paranoid, since I come from another country and live overseas from him. \n\nIt's good that you recognise what abuse is and that you don't tolerate it anymore. I have told some people that my Ndad has been difficult. (he is paranoid that we all talk bad about him and makes us therefor feel guilty by raising the subject with someone else) But it is hard for someone that hasn't been through the same treatment to understand even if they want to.

{"body": "Fairy food and drink. RIFTS has several descriptions you could pull from.\n\npg. 100-101 in Conversion Book 1\n\n&gt;As far as normal food goes, faerie folk eat very little. Favorite foods\ninclude nectar, morning dew, flower bods, honey, nuts, fruit, fresh\nbaked bread and fruit pies. Some are also quite addicted to alcohol,\nespecially wines, and most have a terrible sweet tooth and eat honey,\nand sweet syrups, and love candy, especially chocolates.\nThe wise person never accepts food or drink from any faerie folk,\nespecially from sprites pixies, leprechauns, faeries or bogies. The\nsubstances, usually breads, syrups, nectars, and ales, are almost always\ntainted, resulting in strange enchantment.\n\n&gt;Faerie foods are sometimes available for purchase in some of the\nmost ancient, expensive or decadent alchemist shops and drug dens.\nTheir availability is usually subject to special, rare arrangements (pacts)\nwith faerie folk or one time raids on faerie mounds.\nThe most sought after, for recreational purposes, are for decadent\naristocrats and men of magic, and include cinnamon sticks, bubbly\nwine, burgundy wine, c o r d i a l s , tarts, peanuts and beetle nuts.\nThe cost of these rare magic foods varies from as little as 400 to as\nmuch as 2400 credits per dose.\n\n&gt;The more debilitating faerie foods such as squash, beets, pears, sloe\nwine, mixed nuts, roast pigeon, frog legs, mussels and so on, are\nusually rarer and cost 2000 to 8000 credits depending on the item and\nthe particular seller. Saving throws are the same as for most faerie\nmagic: 14 or higher. The following are some common examples of\nmagic faerie food. Originally written and developed by Randy McCall\nand presented in Adventures on the High Seas.\n\n&gt;Beef Cake: Males who eat this will immediately consider themselves\nto be of surpassing beauty and skill. Females who eat this will fall in\nlove with the first male they see. Effects last 1D4 days, though a\nremove curse will break the spell.\n\n&gt;Beets: The victim becomes extremely violent and will attack the\nclosest non-faerie immediately. This unreasoning rage will last 3D6\nmelees. Fortunately, the magic incites a physical pounding and not\nblasting away with weapons.\n\n&gt;Bubbly Wine: This enchanted drink causes the drinker to feel lightheaded\nand very happy and giggly. However, moments later he or she\nwill actually be floating into the air. The effect is much like a balloon\nfloating up, up and away without control. The character will be a victim\nof the wind unless anchored down with an extremely heavy object (500\nIbs or more) or tied to a tree or vehicle. In addition, every time the\nvictim speaks, little bubbles escape from his nose and mouth. However,\nthe victim is too drunk and cheerful to care, until the effects are over,\nthen he has a terrible hang-over and may have floated miles away.\nDuration is 1D4 hours per every eight ounces drunk.\n\n&gt;Burgundy Wine: The drink makes the drinker feel very happy, but\nturns him a vivid burgundy (purple) color. The pigment change is\npermanent until a remove curse spell is performed.\nBeetle Nuts: A drug-filled nut that causes mild hallucinations in\nwhich the victim will see a civilization of friendly giant beetles. Lasts\n1D6 + 2 hours for every nut eaten.\n\n&gt;Cauliflower: This amusing vegetable causes the eaters ears to grow\nfour times larger than normal. The enlargement lasts 1D4 months unless\na remove curse is used.\n\n&gt;Candy Walnut: A random phobia is picked up, lasting 1D6 days.\n\n&gt;Candy Almond: The eater of this enchanted candy will see his skin\ntake on the look and texture of tree bark, temporarily reducing the\nplayer's physical beauty by half. Those who see him will assume he\nis a D-Bee. The effects last 1D6 + 2 days.\n\n&gt;Cinnamon Sticks: The victim has the urge to commit acts of sinful\nevil at irregular periods, for 1D6 months unless a remove curse is used.\nHowever, the person will be very pleased and self-satisfied during the\nentire time, regardless of alignment.\n100\n\n&gt;Coffee: The victim of faerie coffee will begin to cough continuously,\nruining their sleep, interfering with their concentration, etc. Reduce\nprowl skill by 70%, reduce skills by 10%, and initiative by half. Effects\nlast 1D6 weeks.\n\n&gt;Cordial: This is a light wine which makes the victim feel very relaxed\nand good, but also makes them behave extremely politely to everyone\nand everything they meet. They will try to talk themselves out of\ndangerous situations and be polite and mild toward their most hated\nenemy. It also makes the victim lose his initiative and desire to fight.\nThe victim of a faerie cordial can only enter into combat if he is attacked\nfirst. Effects last 1D6 days for every eight ounces he drank.\n\n&gt;Duck: Whether the character who eats this is lucky or not is a matter\nfor consideration. The said individual gains +3 on all rolls to dodge,\nbut becomes very timid. The affected person will never lead a charge\nand would much rather run than fight. Effects last 1D6 days.\n\n&gt;Flounder: The victim is confused and unable to make up his mind.\nHe loses initiative and is - 6 to strike, parry and dodge. Effects last\n1D6 days.\n\n&gt;Frog's Legs: The victim's legs assume the shape of frog's legs,\nenabling him to leap a number of feet straight up equal to his P.S. and\ntwice his P.S. if jumping forward. This reduces the character's P.B.\nby half. Most people assume the person is a D-Bee. The effect is\npermanent until negated by a remove curse spell.\n\n&gt;Goose: The victim feels like he is being pinched at random times,\nusually when sleeping or when silence is required, causing him to cry\n\"ouch\", or suddenly turn toward the apparent source of the pinch.\nEffects are permanent until a remove curse is used. No damage is taken,\nbut reduce initiative bonus (if any) by half, and the person tends to get\njumpy and a bit paranoid.\n\n&gt;Green Beans: This vegetable simply causes the character's skin to\nturn green. Unless a remove curse spell is used to negate the magic,\nthe effects are permanent.\n\n&gt;Mixed Nuts: The victim picks up 1D4 random phobias which last\n1D6 weeks. Once the magic is ended, the person will forget ever being\nfrightened by such things and insist that accusers to the contrary are\nmistaken or liars.\n\n&gt;Mussels: Increases a person's P.S. by 10 points, but they become\nso muscle-bound that their P.P. and Spd are reduced by half as well\nas losing one melee attack. Lasts 1D6 hours for each mussel eaten.\n\n&gt;Peanuts: The victim suffers from the \"call of nature\" every 1D4\nhours or uncontrollably when under stress. Effects last 1D4 days.\nPears: This creates a temporary, physical double of the victim (a la\nDoppleganger spell), but of the opposite alignment. The double will\nexist for only 2D4 + 2 days. Note: The double will automatically dislike\nits opposite and flee from him or her.\n\n&gt;Pigeon Roast: The victim will believe anything he is told while\nunder the effects of the food. Effects last 24 hours.\n\n&gt;Red Wine: Extreme drunkenness for 2D6 hours, rendering the drinker\n-5 to strike, parry and dodge, and reduce speed 5 points.\n\n&gt;Skunk Cabbage: This food causes the player to have a rather offensive\nbody odor which can be smelled up to 10 feet (3 m) away. Thankfully,\nthe smell only lasts 1D6 hours, but each character who smells\nthis odor must roll under his/her mental endurance to avoid vomiting.\n\n&gt;Sloe Wine: This reduces the drinker's speed and number of attacks\nper melee by half for 1D6 days. This is wine, however, and has the\nsame effects as normal alcohol for the full duration. Drinking a lot of\nthe wine does not have an accumulative effect (does not add more days\nto the duration).\n\n&gt;Squash: This reduces the victim to one-half normal size for 1D6\nweeks. (Only the victim's body shrinks, not his clothes or weapons.)\n\n&gt;Tomatoes: Causes the victim to temporarily grow 1D6 extra toes on\neach foot, making it impossible for him to wear normal shoes/boots.\nEffects last 1D6 months; -10% to prowl, +5% to scale walls.\n\n&gt;Turkey: This causes the victim to become obnoxious and irritating\nfor 1D4 days.\n\n&gt;Tarts: The victim becomes extremely amorous and giddy, almost\nas if he were drunk, and falls in love with every person of the opposite\nsex he sees. Effects last 1D4 days.\n\n&gt;Note: A remove curse will negate the faerie's magic immediately.\nUnfortunately, finding somebody who is willing to perform a remove curse spell or ritual can be difficult and costly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423354759", "subreddit": "Pathfinder_RPG", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Tried switching back to UK by changing billing + shipping adress to UK but the coinds disappear. Dammit. So in reality there are different kind of coins, they are EUR coins, UK coins and USA coins.\n\nEDIT 2 : UK coins are very expensive, and packs in GBP are more expensive compared to US or EUR. So I'm going to try to switch to GERMANY to get the 30% off. The amazon site is now all in german, I'll see if this works.\n\nEDIT 3 : Bought coins off the german app-store, had to translate manually everything to understand what to do. Waiting for email confirmation, nothing for the moment. . . \n\nEDIT 4 : For some reason when I buy 10000 coins it tells me that it costs 0EUR. The transaction isn't working :/ Maybe Amazon has blocked me from buying coins since I've been changing countries 10 times in the past 3 hours ?\n\nEDIT 5 : Trying to buy coins on the UK version. If this doenst work I will create a new amazon account. Jesus Christ I knew this was going to be complicated.\n\nEDIT 6 : Tried on the UK version, can't buy coins for some reason. Going to create new amazon account.\n\nEDIT 7 : Created a new account directly on amazon.co.uk. Used my credit card, and can't buy coins. FML. Going to use my girlfriend's amazon account. C O U R A G E B O Y S\n\nEDIT 8 : Still trying with my gf's credit card. Process is long. Also I'm chatting with an amazon guy about the fact that I can't buy coins.\n\nEDIT 9 : Worked after the 3rd try with my gf's credit card on her amazon account after switching it to UK. JESUS CHRIST ALLMIGHTY. Also I spent 20 min on the phone with an Amazon guy and explained that I couldn't buy amazon coins on the UK website. He said it was very weird and he had never seen that before. I will be put in contact with an expert team via email shortly.\n\nEDIT 10 : For some reason my secondary account got charged, and now I ordered 10000 coins for nothing. I'm recontacting amazon so that they can cancel this order. Holy Christ.\n\nEDIT 11 : Got someone on the phone that told me that this will be done by email. Jesus fucking christ what a fuck-up.

{"body": "\"...when that day comes, the world will begin anew. Centuries of struggling over resources will be over, I'll be able to save countless lives and usher a new age of peace and plenty into this world. On that day, the world will know my name. Only good can come of this\"\n\nA soft thud and a puff of dust marked the occasion as Alan Shepherd tossed the yellowed, loosely-bound journal onto his old drafting table. Dust danced around in the warm beam of light that shone through the blinds, softly fluttering down to land silently on the freshly revealed red oak floor where the old book had lain undisturbed for the better part of a decade.\n\nHe took a deep breath and sighed heavily as He turned and stood up out of the cracking vinyl chair. He paused briefly before hastily stepping out of the study and into the dark living room. He swiped twice at a blank patch on the wall to his right before remembering that he was not walking out of his bedroom, a faint click and flash of light signaled that his hand found the seldom-used switch on the left hand side. The light revealed a stark room with a big cabinet television stuck in the corner, connected to the receiver and outlet with a rat's nest of wires. A single blue leather recliner sat in the middle next to one of those TV trays that acts as a table of sorts. The decor was nearly non-existent, just a very old looking oil portrait hung atop a tall, stately grandfather clock that broke the silence with a loud tick as every second passed. The cleanliness of the room seemed fitting for the level of furnishing; it was practically sterile. \n\nAlan jumped as the bread hopped out of the toaster, everything felt particularly solemn and quiet this morning, every unpredictable occurrence was throwing him off. He hurriedly swept up the crumbs with his palm and scooped them into the garbage can below. Un-buttered toast in hand, Alan set out for the lab.\n\nHonks and the squeal of brakes set the tone for the commute that morning. All He could do to stay calm was focus on the task at hand. \n\n\"I just want it to work, just once,\" He said out loud to himself. \n\nThe honking and squealing grew fainter and less frequent as Alan eased closer to EnCorp. It was 7:23am as He swiped his security card and walked toward the R&amp;D wing, he was always after the proverbial worm. He gave a slight nod to Edgar, the security guard, before rounding the corner. So many years had passed here that the small talk seemed pointless.\n\nThe benefit of His tenure at EnCorp did allow Alan one thing that He truly cherished: solitude. He only had to work with others if he needed their help, never the other way around. Today was a day of solitude. \n\nThough wary as He felt, he thought that today might be a bit different. Perhaps whatever it was that compelled him to make an entry in a journal that had practically become a part of the floor would provide some breakthrough today. At least his goal was fresh in his mind.\n\nAlan's lab was cutting-edge. EnCorp spared no expense at trying to fund Alan's brilliance, something that He grew more ashamed of everyday, like he was some expensive experiment. \n\n\"Maybe they still have the receipts,\" He often thought to himself. \n\nStainless-steel machines and piping twisted and looped all throughout the cavernous, brightly lit white room. Alan was probably one of the only people on Earth that could explain the function of everything in that room. On the west side, a large picture next to a hallway looked down into the room. Co-workers would often come by and watch Alan, like he was some sort of lab-rat. The worst was when the executives would bring clients or investors to the window, they'd point and stare and usually start guffawing and carrying on so loudly that he could hear them through the thick plate-glass. He always wondered what they were saying. Whatever it was, he wished they'd stop.\n\n\"If they only knew what I'm going to accomplish one day,\" He told himself. \n\nIf today was going to be different, he'd have to do something differently. \n\n\"The day started out with something new, why stop there?\" He thought.\n\nHe fired up the collider and calibrated all of the inputs to be more generous than usual, something that is entirely foolhardy. After a quick check of the diagnostic equipment to ensure that the results would be recorded he initiated the firing sequence. An audible voice sounded over the speakerphone\n\n\"10...\"\n\n\"9...\"\n\n\"8...\"\n\n\"7...\"\n\n\"6...\"\n\nAlan suddenly began fumbling about looking for his eye protection, accidentally brushing past one of the control panels. \n\n\"Shit!\" He shouted\n\n\"5...\"\n\nHe had no idea which dials he had disturbed. Sweat was already beading up on his forehead. \n\n\"4...\"\n\nThe emergency shut-off switch was on the far side of the room. Not until this moment had he thought about how profoundly stupid that design was. He bolted for the switch.\n\n***S S S S S SS SS SSS SSSS SSSSSCRAAACK!***\n\nThe collider had fired prematurely.\n\nAlan dove to the floor, completely confused and disoriented. Sudden realization swept over him and he turned and gazed at the capacitors.\nThey were showing 100% capacity and looked to be practically glowing. \n\nStill dazed by what just happened, He just realizes that the whole room is still far brighter than usual and quickly shades his eyes from the source. He begins to piece everything together in his head.\n\nThe capacitors, a *temporary* energy reservoir that have a constant 100 amp load from an additional piece of diagnostic equipment, are still showing 100% capacity now about thirty seconds after the initial firing sequence.\n\n\"What the hell...\" he mutters to himself.\n\nAs his mind rushes with explanations and his heart rate quickens he slowly moves his hand away from the source of the brightness as he stares into it.\n\nTen meters away from, behind six inches of a transparent high temperature polymer developed specifically for this occasion, is an ongoing fusion reaction. \n\n\"Dear God, is this happening?\" He thinks to himself. \"I've done it...\" He mutters, still mostly in disbelief.\n\nAt that moment a familiar sound breaks over the soft hum of the reaction. He turns to the picture window, still laying there on the floor in his labcoat-- propping himself up on his elbows, behind the window are five men in suits slapping each other on the back, grabbing their bellies and laughing like a bunch of frat boys.  \n\n\"They're laughing at me?! Are they stupid?!\" He fumes.\n\nSuddenly, the discomfort from years of being looked down at from above and mocked turned into something far more serious.\n\nHe glanced back at the glowing orb behind the protective shielding, wincing from the pain of the luminosity. He turns once more to the window and stares blankly at the men who have now noticed that he's staring directly at them.\n\n\"The world can wait.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423430790", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The A and G major chords in WYWH and ABITW respectively are the relative 4ths of the tonal center of the minor scales of the songs. In a minor scale, these are minor chords. So, what happened here? It's simple: The melodic minor scale is used.\n\nFor those who don't know, allow me to elaborate. There are 3 versions of the minor scale: the simple, the harmonic and the melodic. The harmonic is a minor scale with a raised 7th and the melodic a minor scale with a raised 6th and a raised 7th.\n\nFor example, let's take the A minor scale. The notes are:\nA B C D E F G A\n\nFor the A harmonic minor scale, its:\nA B C D E F G# A\n\nWhich makes E, the 5th interval, a major chord, giving the scale a distinct sound, kind of \"middle-eastern\", one would say.\n\nExample: Sultans of Swing\n\nAnd for the A melodic minor, its:\nA B C D E F# G# A \n\nWhich makes D, the 4th interval, also a major chord\n\nExample: House of the rising sun (uses both harmonic &amp; melodic minor)\n\nNow, since the melodic minor scale has some not so easy-sounding chords because of the raised tones, in popular music it is common to use the minor scale chords and mix it up with a major 4th, which has a pretty interesting sound. So, there's your answer.\n\nedit: the harmonic minor has a \"middle-eastern\" sound, not \"oriental\".

You can come up with any method you want such as telling that person to or not say \"here\" (or something) when they arrive at the assistant.\n\nThere are plenty of variants on this trick as well.\n\nEdit : There is an [awesome way](http://www.reddit.com/r/CasualMath/comments/2vfl7r/how_to_represent_24_states_with_4_ordered/) from the folks at /r/casualmath that helped me out on representing 24 states without having to memorize a chart. \n\n&gt;I can't tell if this matches one of the other posts, but I would use the numbering system used for Chess960.\nCount how many places A is from the far left position. Valid values are 0-3.\nSkip over A and count how many places B is from the far left position. Valid values are 0-2. Multiply this number by 4 and add to A's position value.\nIf C is to the right of D, add 12 to the value from step 2. Otherwise, use the value from step 2.\nAdd 1 if you want values from 1 to 24\nExamples with the strings you gave: ABCD = 1; DCBA = 3 + 2*4 + 12 + 1 = 24; BADC = 1 + 0 + 12 + 1 = 14", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423584714", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "That site layout is amazing. Scroll down to read with beautiful setup. Love whoever built it. Overall the article is a great read but is lacking in a few points which I imagine will be addressed later on since it is the first of five parts.\n\nSome notable quotes from the article that stood out for myself:\n\n&gt; The preceding statement seems even more ridiculous and cruel when you factor in the fact that from the beginning, I have always said that I want Feminist Frequency to keep going. I just want them to improve and refine their methods. That modest level of dissent resulted in online pariah status. That's not community. That's a cult.\n\nIt seems that everything on the internet that provokes emotion becomes some kind of cult-like status or online phenomena. From Twitch plays Pokemon, S O M E T H I N G B O Y S, #kappa, hype trains, feminist backlash, gamersgate, and more. These things grow and amplify in social media and the web at an alarming rate. Within hours or days everyone grabs their own support shovel and digs a trench calling it the last stand of humanity. Subreddits mirror this effect in many ways because they are built around a community of shared interests. \n\nFor example: take our own community /r/GirlGamers. Which is a slightly more moderate/balanced version (up for debate at times) of /r/Games to some extent. We have people here who are very pro feminist ladies and men, pro feminist ladies and men who support Feminist Frequency, pro feminist ladies and men who don't support feminist frequency, people who are apathetic towards either idea, and more. Some of the topics get very heated and often times this is where we see the downvotes as disagreements. It has been shown that people are more likely to downvote a comment if it has already been downvoted like a showing of social punishment or almost like a downvote stoning. It serves as an easy outlet for frustrations. Which I think is the biggest issue: The internet has become an easy place to vent our frustrations. These frustrations find an echo chamber in social communities and quickly become shock waves that ripple through the rest of the web. \n\n&gt; snip \"Talking about Diversity\"\n\nThis one is hard to find a direct quote but there is a general theme of diversity during the writing (about 70%) of the way down. I think that is really important in our industry from a number of standpoints. It is easy to walk into a chapters or any bookstore and find a wide range of books with each book catered toward a different audience. Should all books be inclusive to all audiences? I don't think so. Or more importantly, should every book be written with the express desire to be inclusive? Same answer, I don't think so. What is inherently great is that there are books for almost every single desire/fantasy/and idea because there are so many books out there. \n\nThe biggest problem right now is the games industry is fairly small and extremely top heavy in the triple AAA market (and of course the whole thing is profit driven). This has been getting way better over the years but it is also going to take a long time to change (years; maybe even decades). It is great to see games like Mirror's Edge and Tomb Raider (the reboot) but I don't think we should ever get rid of games like Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine (which actually had a great female character in it) or Tera (which is extremely hit or miss for most people). I think there is an idea that \"Feminist\" want to take are games away or Feminist deems that only female positive games should be made. I don't think either side of that is right (or going to happen). I think right now we are seeing the increase in more female friendly games but I don't think that is ever going to stop the production of inherently sexual and pandering drivel because there is a market for those games. Just like there is a market for terrible romance novels (thousands of these books) aimed at older women. All of these games can co-exist in the same market. We just need more games for everyone (which is a massive task at hand). \n\nThis is getting really long so I am going to cut it off there but like any topic we could spend days/months/years discussing it. Great link and interesting to see where the conversation goes. (I'll also get around to editing this sometime because I imagine it has tons of mistakes.

{"body": "\"I am the all powerful Star-lorn, black wizard of the great north and leader of the ghoulish army of Hades' great undead\" he bellowed,\n\nIt was my first day in tech support for Apple and although I had been on 2 weeks of customer service training nothing could have prepared me for this guy.\n\"Ok sir I understand that but I need your apple ID\"\n\n\"I have chartered golden chariots to hell and back and written scrolls so powerful they could destroy your entire dirty mortal race\" \n\"Sir if you could just give my your apple ID I would be very gratef.......Are you ok sir?\"  \n\nI could hear whimpering in the background, then a deep snort and a sniff.\n\"No, I'm not ok\" replied Star-lorn angrily.\nThere was a moment of awkward silence as he started crying what I can only describe as crocodile tears. \n\n\"Ok star-lorn, do you mind if I call you star-lorn?\" I asked in a calming manor,\n\"No that's fine\" he snifflled.\n\"What's the matter, how can I help you today\"\n\nHe sighed, took a deep breath and said \"Today is my daughters 13th birthday and I downloaded that Call Me Maybe song onto my iPad and now the blasted thing won't let me play it on my GOD FORSAKEN iMac, I've got a room full of 17 angry 13 year olds demanding to here that song, my wife is already angry at me because I got the wrong kind of cake, she said a frozen cake so I got her a cake and left it in the freezer, how was I supposed to know it was that ridiculous Disney film, It's hard enough raising a family AND being the eternal gate keeper for Hades' dark army, I just can't catch a break today buddy\"\n\nI couldn't quite believe what I had heard, since I was a boy we were always told that bad souls get drafted into Hades' undead army if they're bad in their mortal life but I never guessed I would be on the phone with the major general of the lot of them. I did my best to regain my composure, \"Ok star-lorn well lets look at what we can do for you today, do you have a personal email address you use for your amazon or netflix etc?\"\n\"What does that matter\" he snapped,\n\n\"Well\" I said calmly, \"often, the email address you use for those services is your apple ID as well, this is the case with most customers, if you have one I can check our database\"\n\n\"Oh ok\" he said \"I think it's s t a r underscore l o r n 69 AT underworld admin . co . uk\" \n\n\"Ok sir give me a moment\". I typed in this address trying not to laugh, then my screen gave me a few options to reset his security password.\n\n\"Ok Star-lorn I can reset your password for you if you answer a few security questions\" \n\n\"FINE\" he bellowed. \n\n\"Can you tell me your mothers maiden name\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, it was norður\"\n\n\"Ok thanks\" a few moments passed as I typed it in, I could here commotion in the background coming from the party.\n\n\"And can you tell me your first pets name\" \n\n\"Yes, it was Fluffy\"\n\n\"Ok, just give me a minute\" I typed that in and could here cover the phone and say \"I'M DEALING WITH IT, GIVE ME A MINUTE WON'T YOU\"\n\n\"Ok and finally Star-lorn can you tell me the name of your favourite movie?\"\n\nA quiet and muffled voice said in an almost whispered tone \"Errrr yes, Titanic\".\n\n\"OK\" I said, putting in that last bit of data into my system.\n\n\"That's great Star-lorn, I've reset your password with a 24 hour timeout on it, your replacement password is 13callmemaybeparty\" \n\n\"OK wait here while I try it out\". I heard the phone drop to the floor, a minute or two passed and then out of the blue I heard it. It was blaring down the phone like nothing I had ever heard before. The chorus of 17 hyped up 13 year olds belting out - \" I THREW A WISH IN THE WELL DON'T ASK ME I'LL NEVER TELL\"\n\nWith that I heard the phone crackle and pop as someone picked it up off the floor, then Star-Lorn said \"Thankyou sir, I'll never forget what you have done for me, when you pass on through to the afterlife I assure you you'll be headed straight to the golden shores of Valhalla for an eternity of bliss, relaxation and everlasting peac- GIRLS PUT DOWN THAT STAFF IT'S DANGEROUS\"\n\nStar-lorn hung up. I've never been a big believer in the afterlife but after this I guess it could be something to look forward to. \n\nAnd with that thought I answered my next call \"Hello apple tech support, how can I help\".\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423600707", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The issue is that Text and ByteString only allow you to get out Char and Word8's respectively.\n\nLet us ignore Foldable/Traversable for a moment, and just consider something simpler: `Functor`.\n\n    class Functor f where\n      fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n\nWe all know this class.\n\nHere the class is only talking about 'f'. The a's and b's are left to float alone. This class can be defined entirely within the confines of Haskell 98.\n\nIt can't handle `fmap` for `Text` and `ByteString`, either.\n\nSo folks define monomorphic `map` functions for those cases and bury it in the module for their data type. \n\nOf course, now, you can't change out the contents of a ByteString for tuples or Maybes or any other data type other than Char, now. But this restriction is specific to your `map` combinator and the type of contents it allows you to use.\n\nNow try to define a class that generalizes over all of these cases.\n\nYou could write\n\n    class Functorish s a | s -&gt; a where\n      fmapish :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; s -&gt; s\n\n    instance Functorish Text Char\n    instance Functorish [a] a\n    instance Functorish ByteString Word8\n    ...\n\nBut now fmapish isn't as powerful as fmap, it can't change the types involved. It is also actually quite a bit easier to screw up writing, because parametricity isn't ensuring that every 'a' in the structure gets touched and converted to a 'b'. \n\nIn fact, `fmapish id = id` and `fmapish f . fmapish g = fmapish (f . g)` don't even convey that property. It used to hold via a free theorem and a consequence of a law, but now it is yet another law that you have to figure out how to awkwardly state.\n\nOnce you are done with all of that you now have an `fmap`-like thing that can't even do all the things we could do with `fmap`!\n\nSo we roll up our sleeves and we generalize.\n\n     class Functorish s t a b | s -&gt; a, t -&gt; b, s b -&gt; t, t a -&gt; s where\n       fmapish :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; s -&gt; t\n\nand we ask users to supply us only instances that obey nice structural rules that kind of follow the lens laws.\n\nBut now we get all sorts of type inference woes.\n\nSo we rip off our sleeves and flex. \n\nIn the end, in lens we have a 2-typeclass, 3-instance solution that finally solves all those inference issues for _just_ the case of isomorphisms, which is quite similar to this one. It isn't pretty.\n\nWe haven't bothered to write such a solution for Each. Why? Because it requires users to write a bunch of instances to solve a comparatively rare inference problem.\n\nBut along the way, even if we have the idealized form of this solution we get problems. \n\nWe leak all the details of what types you chose in the interim!\n\nOnce your \"`Functor`\" can care about what types 'a' and 'b' are, then you have to care about all of the types we use.\n\nThis means that tons of previously canonical constructions become open for reinterpretation. You can't just pick the obvious definition and know all the others are equivalent any more. They cease to be!\n\nNow, I stuck with a monomorphic `Functor` here. The same issues arise when you talk about monomorphic versions of `Foldable` and `Traversable`.\n\nAn uneasy compromise that handles about 80% of the cases is to use `Foldable`/`Traversable` for most things, and to depend on something like `mono-traversable` for the remaining completely monomorphic containers. You can up that percentage a bit, by using `lens` rather than `mono-traversable`, because we have more traversals that can support type changing assignments up to whatever the limits of the containers are, but we still wind up leaking a lot of information about intermediate types, and the whole approach is predicated on the fact that we can almost always fuse multiple traversals into one single traversal to avoid needing to pick several different 'a's and 'b's within the same combinator.\n\nYou get the same kinds of issues when folks offer up restricted monads. You can implement `liftM3` with several different signatures none of which imply the other depending on what intermediate types I run through.\n\nAlmost all of the laws relating Applicative and Monad start to break down, laws like\n\n    liftM3 f x y z = f &lt;$&gt; x &lt;*&gt; y &lt;*&gt; z\n\ncease to hold.

Also this: http://ask.fm/AzerFrost/answer/124426328994), and actively promotes the \"N E V E R G I V E U P\" meme despite this post (http://ask.fm/AzerFrost/answer/121895531938). \n\nAlso I cannot find the ask post which says this, but he said something along the lines of \"Anyone with more than 100k play count who isn't top 200 should give up\".

Notice how it was made in Dec. 27, 2014. So there were still five more days for top players to get scores in (and they did! HDHR, WWW, yamemasita all had amazing scores on the last couple of days in December) and Azer decided to open the topic anyway. This was shortly after (coincidentally, again) PortalLife said he had plans to make the Top 20 Players of 2014 video. The decision by itself was irresponsible because now HDHR, WWW, yamemasita, etc will get a couple of ranks less than they truly deserve, but in addition, it may lead to one or both of these conclusions: 1.) Azer made the topic so he'd be noticed more often so he'd get voted in the vid 2.) He wanted to be the one to make the vid and not Portal so he'd get even more views. IIRC, the voting topics for other years (&lt;= 2013) were opened well after the year ended, in February or later.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423620740", "subreddit": "osugame", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Rolling them into one system is what falls apart.\n\nThe three most robust systems I know of -- and I've been chasing this grail for years -- involve:\n\n* MPTCs with 4 distinct fundeps, which fail to actually properly propagate type inference in a number of non-trivial usecases. This is used by the `each` machinery in `lens`, but `class Each s t a b | s -&gt; a, t -&gt; b, s b -&gt; t, t a -&gt; s where each :: Applicative f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; s -&gt; f t` sadly fails to propagate information we can get with `traverse`. Knowing you are going to `traverse` some `ZipList a` tells us that `t = ZipList b` for some b and vice versa, even without knowing `a` or `b`! Unification here gives us more information than is conveyed through the functional dependency.\n\n* Two 2 different classes, 3 instances, type equality constraints galore. This is used by the `_Wrapped` machinery in lens. This fixes the inference problem in the former case, but is better able to handle an `Iso` or a `Lens` than a `Traversal` or `Setter`. I leave it to you to explore the code there.\n\n* Type families and use of the constraint kind. This is used by the restricted monads package on hackage. It doesn't directly deal with the `ByteString` and `Text` types out of the box, you then need to bolt a bunch of additional type family machinery on top.\n\nNone of these successfully fully integrates the two. You always leak details about the intermediate types into the signature, and _then_ need a specific set of combinators for addressing the simple parametric case. Trying to get there properly then pushes a desire for proper rank-2 constraints.\n\nOn the plus side, we can just write the simple parametric case entirely in Haskell 98 without involving \"rocket surgery\". We even have nice names for these simpler parametric combinators, they nicely subsume all the usecases from the `Prelude`. Not only that, there is even a proposal to generalize the `Prelude` in favor of them.

The goal here is to take the 1, 3, and 5 from each chord and know where every instance of that chord is. Then if you know where the those base notes are you can flat the 3 and you have minor. Making small changes to these shapes gives you tons of chord options.\n* Use drum rudiments for picking patterns. I'll use the low E and A strings and play a \"paradiddle\" (E A E E A E A A) as 16th notes at various speeds. I'll work on each string. Using drum licks really challenges your brain. Flams are treated as sweeps.\n* The last thing I did was start picking out hard songs to learn. I'm currently working on [What About Me by Snarky Puppy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuhHU_BZXSk)\n\nThe only other advice I could give you would be try to find different styles to play.

Stuff should be at +7 or 8 at least.\n\n======== S P O I L E R   A L E R T ! ========\n\nNo. Best a newbie can hope for is a +5.\n\nIn a blind playthrough, you would've just gotten LG Ember but you would still be wandering the Depths (not *really* knowing what you just had gotten, who to give it to or how to use it. Plus, if your weapon is a regular titanite upgrade path, you won't have any Large Titanite yet or least maybe one or two (those can be farmed in Blighttown easily but a newbie won't know this. He might or might not have the Master Key) -- you could farm them in the Depths too from the slugs (but you won't know about item discovery and how that all works.) If he doesn't have the Master Key, he STILL would not know about getting to back door of Blighttown via Darkroot Garden&gt;Basin&gt;Valley of Drakes. So Blighttown (the easiest method to farm large titties is out.)\n\nA new player will find himself down in the Depths many times via the food chute behind the Butcher -- he will have no idea how to get back out to get to the blacksmith. He will wander around, fall down further, meet the frogs and get cursed, get pissed, curse a lot and throw shit. Even ~~if~~ when he gets back to André, without proper upgrade materials, he can't make his weapon stronger.\n\nYes, those of us in the know, Zip-a-dee-doo-dah down to pimp slap the butcher and his dog and are back up to Andre before breakfast (this is after, of course, we've Usain Bolt-ed down to Blighttown (via the Master Key) and farmed the area with homeward bones from the Great Hollow bonfire. I do this all the time right before Spider Q. I don't have to in order to beat her but the weapon needs to be upgraded so I generally just get it done and out of the way. It also helps to have a nice +10 weapon before Sen's so, there's that.\n\nQuestions?

{"body": "Alright, so I'll break this down. The easiest way to figure out why something sounds good is to break it down to the components- so...\n\nEmaj7 is E G# F D#\n\nB7 is B D# F# A\n\nE major is E F# G# A B C# D# E\n\nA major is A B C# D E F# G# A\n\nSo as for why the A major sounds good, I'd guess it's because it has the root, the fifth, and the seventh in there. You've only got one \"dangerous\" or dissonant piece with the D/D# clashing. \n\n\n\nWhen it comes to how to determine this stuff, I'm not sure how best to describe it. Music theory is best taken one thing at a time, and I'm not sure where you're at. Basically, I learned with a [few](http://www.teoria.com) different [websites](http://www.musictheory.net) and teachers, and now with a couple college courses.\n\nI'm not sure if it's going to help, but the way I memorized my modes was in tandem with my major scales, and in addition, my chords. Honestly, they're all tied together, so the easiest way is to learn them at the same time. The main difference, to me, between a chord and a scale is that one is harmonic (same time) and one is melodic (different times).\n\nC Major is C D E F G A B C\n\nSo for 7th chords, you build them the same way as triads. It's a bit easier on paper, so if you have a pen handy, draw it out a few times and circle every other note. So you need the root, the third, the fifth, and the seventh for those chords.\n\nI  C E G B, a  Cmaj7\n\nii  D F A C, a  Dmin7\n\niii E G B D, an Emin7\n\nIV F A C E, an Fmaj7\n\nV  G B D A, a Gdom7 (or G7)\n\nvi  A C E B, an Amin7\n\nvii  B F G A, a Bmin7b5\n\nSo with the exception of the minor keys, all of the other keys are going to follow this template.\n\nI is maj7\n\nii is min7\n\niii is min7\n\nIV is maj7\n\nV is dom7\n\nvi is min7\n\nvii is min7b5\n\nMoving on a bit, with modes, you're playing a permutation of the major scale. Personally, I try to identify my modes as a chord. I'm still working on it, but it's helping a lot. So to tie it in with this, picture the C Major scale from above, and when we move chords, just picture the scale starting from next note. I'm going to kinda skimp on the detail because I'm tight on time, but going through C Major will net you these scales.\n\nI is ionian (or major)\n\nii is dorian\n\niii is phrygian\n\nIV is lydian\n\nV is mixolydian\n\nvi is aeolian (or natural minor)\n\nvii is locrian.\n\nThe way I memorized them was with a mnemonic, I Don't Play Like My Aunt Lucy, and then from there, I started pairing them with the chords. \n\nIt's a lot to take in, but it just takes focus and patience. Again, take it one little bite at a time and just keep learning. Those websites up there, Teoria and Musictheory.net, helped me a ton, but they are no replacement for a great teacher. Let me know if you have any more questions, I hope this has helped out a little bit. :)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423693138", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

And then the Ab and F# would resolve outward to G, which would then go to C?\n\nThat's right!  Classically, anyway!  The only thing you're missing here is that the G doesn't need to resolve to C.  Ab and F# both resolve outwards to G's, and actually, a common way to do that would be to have a chord like Ab C D# F# (note the spelling I used) go to G C E G, which *then* goes to G B D G, and then to wherever you want your V chord to go, which can be C but could be something else.  You can even use the augmented 6th to modulate.  Pretend that it's actually an Ab7 and go to Db instead!  It will throw people off.\n\nAnd you're also right that there's a set aug6 in every key, and it's built on the b6 of the key.  However, when you're writing music, you can certainly come up with other uses for the chord, with the augmented 6th interval someplace else.  You can even use secondary augmented 6th chords.  And if you avoid parallel fifths, you can have an It6 -- Ab C C F# -- resolve to G B D F instead of G B D G.

As I reached to grab it, he whispers \"Yours.\" So without even looking at his calculator, I deftly switched his with mine and reached over to put mine away. I glanced up to see if my teacher had noticed. She had, but my buddy must have asked me loud enough that she heard and didn't think anything of it. I look down at the calculator my friend had handed me, and on it I saw: \"#34: D A A B D D C B C etc for every question after 34. I filled a few in wrong to avoid arousing extra suspicion, and handed my test in looking like the god damn Cheshire cat. I graduated high school a week later.\n\nIf you're on Reddit, thanks buddy. I'll always owe you one.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423761857", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, according to the site it's calculated based on recent results. If you look at CRC's recent results it's all based on recent results. The formula is P= M x I x T X C where M is match results (3 win, 1 tie, 0 loss, 2 for PK win and 1 for PK loss), Importance of match (friendly 1.0, WC qualifier 2.5, Confed cup final or equivalent 3.0 and WC final 4.0) and T is the strength of the opposing team (200-ranking of the opposition team The US's T is 200-31=169, CRC's is 200-13=187\nThe us and CRC are in the same confederation so we can ignore that. \nGoing back a few months there's really only friendlies for CONCACAF teams, so we can ignore that factor as well.\n\nOK, so the last say 3 months CRC won against Nicaragua (50, the minimum T) Guatemala(118), Oman(89), Korea (146) and Uruguay(191) and tied to Panama(139).\n\nThe US in turn won against Panama(139) and tied to Ecuador(171) and Honduras (123)\n\nI don't even have to do the math on that one. CRC's is clearly higher. I would also point out that CRC made it to the round of 8 in the WC knock out round. US and Mexico (no era penal!) didn't make it past the round of 16. So the WC bump any team should get is clearly higher for the CRC.\n\nOver the same period of time Mexico also has wins against Honduras and Panama but not much else (it hasn't really played a lot of games in a while). \n\nSo it would make sense.\n\nAlso, for the sake of comparison:\nArgentina has wins against Hong Kong and Croatia but it's still buyoed by its WC showing. The summer's Copa America will likely change the tables as bit.\n\nThe interesting case is actually for England since they've won 4 of their qualifiers to the Euro Cup.

We're left wondering whether that's always the case, or only when someone is actively using a device. I mean, technically you are \"logged in\" to your smartphone any time it's turned on. You can send and receive calls, emails, surf the internet. So either your Persona is displayed constantly, or your Persona appears every time you open a browser window... or you let the Persona represent your conscious effort to interact with the Matrix as a whole, such as purposely logging into a chat room or more so when you activate a VR interface.\n\nThe wording of that 2nd bit is a little weird, isn't it? \"Run one persona at a time\" makes it sound like there are several personas to choose from. And yet \"shift your persona\" sounds like it's the same persona moving from one device to another. Kinda tough to sort out.\n\nMarks are indeed tied to Personas, since they vanish from everywhere in the Matrix when your Persona goes offline. And Ownership does give you 4 Marks on your property. Which is why I originally said that I believe you're always using the same Persona regardless of what SIN you purchased something with. Especially when you factor in the ability to transfer Ownership to someone else, you could buy something from the store and then turn around and give it to your SINless team mate. If you legally transfer it, now his Persona is the Owner, but it's not registered to any particular SIN.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423781729", "subreddit": "Shadowrun", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;In short, I have no idea what infinity is and so I am simply guessing about what the implications of doing something 'infinitely many' times might be.\n\nThe first definition that leaps to mind is a countably infinite cartesian product of the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with itself.\n\nI'll just use S to denote the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nFor a natural number n, the product S x S x ... x S (n times) can be understood as the collection of all n-tuples (you should be familiar with tuples from computer science) (a1, a2, a3, ..., an) such that each ak is in S.\n\nE.g., the elements of {0,1} x {0,1} are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1, 1).\n\nExtending the cartesian product to the infinite case is a little more difficult to grasp.  First, you can think of the elements in the regular old finite cartesian product as being a function from the set {1,2,3,...,n} to the set S, where f(k) gives the kth \"coordinate\".\n\ne.g., for the set {0,1,2} x {0,1,2}, the element (0,0,0) corresponds to the function f: {1,2,3} (the number of coordinates in each element is 3) -&gt; {0,1,2} (the set that each coordinate has to come from) where f(1) = 0, f(2) = 0, and f(3) = 0.\n\nYou can think of this as a coordinate-identifying function.  Each function identifies a specific element in the product, because each function tells you all the coordinates of that element.\n\nThe countably infinite case generalizes the functions' domain from {1,2,...,n} to the natural numbers {1,2,3,...}.  So an element in the countably-infinite product of {0,1} with itself is a function from {1,2,3, ...} to {0,1}.\n\nYou might know these better as the set of all countably infinite strings of 1s and 0s.  But as long as you're comfortable with the natural numbers, and functions from the natural numbers to other sets, then you can get comfortable with countably-infinite cartesian products pretty painlessly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423790968", "subreddit": "askmath", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Decklist is above\n\n EDIT - mad scientist is even more overpowered in this deck and you should always play it early.\nA quick mulligan guide *that worked for me* :\n\nWarrior - you pretty much need annoy-o-tron or snowchugger. If snowchugger sticks behind annoy, i found i usually won the game. Don't fear brawl, go all in F A C E B O Y S\n\nDruid - A pretty easy matchup IMO, just flood the board with an aggressive start mechwarper + other two drops\n\nPaladin - a good matchup, by the time they get truesilver, your board should be pretty stable (save when they have shielded minibot, but your hero power reduces his value) Mulligan for 2 drops again, annoy o tron can help your mech warper live.\n\nWarlock - against zoo it really comes down to if you get board control via minions or spells, mulligan for mech warper and get good value from blastmage\n\nMirror - 50/50 really, whoever gets more mechwarper value wins, usually. If you're behind search for a cloaked archmage.\n\nRogue - can be tricky if they play their backstabs right. Annoy-otron is GREAT here, as is snowchugger. Kill ALL THEIR STUFF. They can easily kill you when youre sitting on 20 ish life if you dont have a taunt up. Hitting face with snowchugger and keeping him frozen is vital. A frostbolt to face can save your life and give you time for lethal if he has a boosted weapon.\n\nPriest - I only faced a few but I think I went 50/50. They can have really good answers so just try and get huge mechwarper value and kill him fast. If you have a chance to kill a blademaster before its a 4/7, do it.\n\nHunter - a decent match up. Annoy + snowchugger are great, deny them weapon value with freezes and clear their board - however once you have a few minions and they dont have much, it becomes a race. Look for the fireballs or frost bolts to finish.\n\n\nShaman - I had a hard time with shaman, they have alot of crap minions that are annoying to get rid of. Try and avoid over populating the board if you think they have spells, I found myself watching to see if he was thinking about casting it and moving his card.\n\n\nSome GENERAL strategies that are employable in every situation:\n\nTurn 7? Dr Boom? Do it.\n\nYou have coin, mechwarper, and a few 2 drops. I like to play nothing (save cogmaster) turn one, then drop mechwarper on natural turn 2, and coin into annoytron.\n\nAlways make favorable trades, kill off clockwork gnomes and yetis first for spare parts! +1 health or attack can be the difference between games.\n\nIf you get a finicky cloaker, I usually save it in most situations if I have Antonidas in my hand...hes just WAY to good cloaked. This won me my legend game (you can see in the first screen shot, paladin has a full board.....i 13 dmg'd his face lol)\n\nOther than that play it like zoo, make favorable trades when you can otherwise go face!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423804737", "subreddit": "CompetitiveHS", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Basic of mediation is to focus on the present moment. Eyes open or closed. Most commonly people use their breath as the point of focus. Bring your attention to your breathing. When thoughts arise, remember that you do not have to think about them and bring your focus back to your breath. When you realize you've spaced out, bring you focus back to your breath. Also, when thoughts arise, allow yourself to view them without judgment. Allow yourself not to be captured by their emotion. A secondary goal is to be able to objectively look at things with out negative emotional reaction. Relaxed. When you bring your attention back to your breath, it almost does it for you. Can be done with eyes open, closed, sitting or standing. While still, walking, or running.\n\nHighly recommend it. Can be frustrating or boring at first. Probably space out a lot. Don't worry about that. After a little while you will have some moments of feeling so blissed out. like not necessarily happy, just really content. It feels like the high pitch toxic buzzing of your brain is soothed and turned down to a warm smooth tone. (does anyone else get that high pitch.  E E E E E E E. while compulsively reading articles or clicking around online?)\n\nThere are many types of meditation that all focus on focusing. Some use mantras as the point of focus. Repeating a carefully made phrase over and over. Some focus on visualization. Like the Ice-Man. While running in the snow or sitting in ice water. He visualizes a point of light radiating a little heat. He visualizes it going in through his breath and when it cycles into his chest he visualizes a burst of warmth flow through all of his veins and arteries, radiating heat throughout his body. Over and Over \n\nNote: Probably not exactly what the Ice-Man visualizes.

{"body": "Not the OP, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nIf you build the major scale from other notes than C, you'll have different patterns of flats or sharps.  \n\nFor example, let's build a major scale from G, using the same relative intervals WWHWWWH:\n\nG A B C D E F# G\n\nSo in the key of G, we have a single sharp, an F#.  \n\nMajor scale from D:\n\nD E F# G A B C# D\n\nIn other words, in key of D, we have two sharps: F# and C#.\n\nWhen you see written music, at the beginning of the staff (after that sign that shows where notes are, like piano/bass, don't know its English name), you see a pattern of sharps or flats that tell you a key signature.  If you see a single sharp, it'll always be an F# and you know the key is G.  If you see two sharps there, they'll always be F# and C#, and the key is D.  And so on.  \n\nThe curious thing is that this pattern grows by fifths in both ways: keys and the sharps/flats:\n\nKey|Signature\n---|-------\nC | (none)\nG | F#\nD | F# C#\nA | F# C# G#\nE | F# C# G# D#\nB | F# C# G# D# A#\n\n(C to G is fifth, G to D is fifth, and so on; on the right hand: F to C is fifth, C to G, G to D, and so on.)\n\nI'm too lazy to continue with flats; the pattern of flats grows the other way: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb, Fb.\n\nSo far I've talked only about the major scale, and so major keys.  A given key signature can mean either a major key, or its relative minor key.  For example, for C major the relative minor is A minor (no sharps/flats); for G major, it's E minor (a single sharp, F#).  A minor key is based upon a minor scale, which is built in a pattern of WHWWHWW.  For a given major key, its relative minor has the same notes (and hence, the same pattern of sharps or flats).

{"body": "COME RICONOSCERE UN FILM PORNO\n\nNon so se vi sia mai accaduto di vedere  un film pornografico. Non intendo film che  contengano elementi di erotismo,  sia  pure oltraggioso per molti, come per esempio  Ultimo  tango  a Parigi.  Intendo film pornografici, il cui vero e unico fine è di  sollecitare  il  desiderio  dello  spettatore,  dal  principio  alla  fine,  e  in  modo  che, pur di sollecitare questo desiderio con immagini di accoppiamenti vari e variabili, il resto conti meno che niente.\n\nMolte  volte  i  magistrati  debbono  decidere  se  un  film  sia puramente pornografico o se abbia  valore  artistico.  Non  sono  di  coloro  che  ritengono  che  il valore  artistico  assolva  tutto, e  talora  opere  d’arte  autentiche  sono  state  più pericolose,  per  la  fede,  i  costumi,  le  opinioni  correnti,  che  non  opere  di  minor valore.  Inoltre  ritengo  che  adulti  consenzienti  abbiano  il  diritto  di  consumare materiale pornografico, almeno in mancanza di meglio.  Ma ammetto che talora in tribunale  si  debba  decidere  se  un  film  è  stato  prodotto  allo  scopo  di  esprimere certi  concetti  o  ideali  estetici  (sia  pure  per  mezzo  di  scene  che  offendono  il comune senso del pudore), o se è stato fatto al solo e unico scopo di sollecitare gli istinti dello spettatore.\n\nEbbene, c’è un criterio per decidere se un film è pornografico o no, ed è basato sul  calcolo  dei  tempi  morti. Un grande  capolavoro  del  cinema  di  tutti  i  tempi, Ombre  rosse,  si  svolge  sempre  e  unicamente  (salvo l’inizio,  brevi  intervalli  e  il finale)  su  una  diligenza.  Ma  senza  questo  viaggio  il  film  non  avrebbe  senso. L’avventura  di  Antonioni  è  fatto  unicamente  di  tempi  morti:  la  gente  va,  viene, parla, si perde e si ritrova, senza che nulla accada.  Ma il film vuole appunto dirci che nulla accade. Ci può piacere o no, ma vuole dirci esattamente questo.\n\nUn  film  pornografico  invece,  per  giustificare  il  biglietto  di  ingresso  o  l’acquisto della  videocassetta,  ci  dice che  alcune  persone  si  accoppiano  sessualmente, uomini  con  donne,  uomini  con  uomini,  donne  con donne,  donne  con  cani  o cavalli (faccio notare che non esistono film pornografici in cui uomini si accoppino con cavalle e cagne: perché?). E questo andrebbe ancora bene: ma esso è pieno di tempi morti. \n\nSe  Gilberto,  per  violentare  Gilberta,  deve  andare  da  piazza  Cordusio  a  corso Buenos Aires, il film vi mostra Gilberto, in macchina, semaforo per semaforo, che compie tutto il tragitto.\n\nI  film  pornografici  sono  pieni  di  gente  che  sale  in  macchina  e  guida  per chilometri e chilometri, di coppie che perdono un tempo incredibile per registrarsi negli alberghi, di signori che passano minuti e minuti in ascensore prima di salire in camera, di ragazze che sorbiscono liquori diversi e si gingillano con magliette e merletti  prima  di  confessarsi  a  vicenda  che  preferiscono Saffo  a  Don  Giovanni. Detto alla buona e volgarmente, nei film pornografici,  prima di vedersi una sana scopata occorre sorbirsi uno spot dell’assessorato ai trasporti. \n\nLe  ragioni  sono  ovvie.  Un  film  in  cui  Gilberto  violentasse  sempre  Gilberta, davanti,  di  dietro  e  di  fianco,  non  sarebbe  sostenibile.  Nè  fisicamente  per  gli attori,  nè  economicamente  per  il  produttore.  E  non  lo sarebbe  psicologicamente per lo spettatore: perché la trasgressione abbia successo occorre che si disegni su uno sfondo di normalità.  Rappresentare la normalità è una delle cose più difficili per qualsiasi artista  -  mentre rappresentare la  deviazione, il delitto, lo stupro, la tortura, è facilissimo.\n\nPertanto il film pornografico deve rappresentare la normalità essenziale perché possa acquistare interesse la trasgressione - nel modo in cui ciascun spettatore la concepisce.  Pertanto  se  Gilberto  deve  prendere l’autobus  e  andare  da  A  a  B,  si vedrà Gilberto che prende l’autobus e l’autobus che va da A a B.\n\nQuesto  irrita  sovente  gli  spettatori,  perché  essi  vorrebbero  che  ci  fossero sempre scene innominabili. Ma si tratta di una illusione.  Essi non sosterrebbero un’ora e mezzo di scene innominabili. Quindi i tempi morti sono essenziali.\n\nRipeto dunque.  Entrate in una sala cinematografica.  Se per andare da A a B i protagonisti ci mettono più di quanto desiderereste, questo significa che il film è pornografico.\n\n\nUmberto Eco (1989)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423841833", "subreddit": "italy", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

He would never fall under scrutiny for this wealth, all government agencies would accept the fact that he had it and not pester him about it's origin.*\n\n\"Now, all you have to do is walk right up and say \"I wish I was Steven Benson with a V from the doccument drafted by my attorney Peter Irons.\" That simple enough?\"\n\n\"That's fucking perfect, how can I thank you for this?\"\n\n\"You're about to become the richest person in the universe and you've got two more wishes, I'm sure you'll figure something out.\"\n\n\"Cheers man.\" \n\n\"Bye now.\"\n\n**BZZZT**\n\n\"Maria, come in please.\"\n\n\"Yes Mr. Irons?\"\n\n\"Thank you for typing that document for me, it did the job perfectly.\"\n\n*Steven Benton was a big dumb idiot who wasted his first wish wishing he was the Steven Benton described in this document.

{"body": "Personally, I think too many modern games concentrate too much on character customization and branching narratives. The overall story experience suffers when the protagonist is designed to be a blank slate that most developers assume will act as an avatar for the player. This creates a very bland, boring protagonist with bland, boring choices ranging from \"kill the badguys while spouting moralistic dialogue\" to \"kill the badguys while spouting dickish jerk-face dialogue.\" You end up going through the same motions of the story, it's just in one playthrough your character acts like Jesus 2.0, while in the other he acts like a snarky dickass jerk. \n\nThe problem I have with this is that it detracts from a well-built, well structured, engaging storyline. Back in the days of text RPG and pixel graphics, games could encourage wider arranges of choices and customization. Since you didn't have to spend time and resources on a voice actor, for example, you could give the player more interesting choices in a dialogue. Plus, the game engine was more designed off of DnD, meaning that it was very easy to have a wide variety of different approaches to different problems at a relatively low cost.\n\nLook at Planescape: Torment, Baldurs Gate, and Fallout 1 &amp; 2 for example. Now compare them to Skyrim, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. I've noticed that, as game's production values / cost go up, the range of choices both in gameplay and dialogue goes down. I think it's an unfortunate result of ever expanding technology. \n\nBefore, you could structure a game to have points where the player has to choose A B C D E, A B C D E, A B C D E, A B C D E, etc etc at different points in the narrative. Because things were generally more budgetable (no need for CGI cutscenes, advanced rendering, voice actors, etc etc) a dev team could handle it, no problem. \n\nNow with AAA's unreasonable fetish for having the latest and greatest graphics engine with celebrity voice acting, even structuring an Act 1 A B C, Act 2 A B C, Act 3 A B C becomes incredibly costly. And the more money that gets put in, the more pressure there is on the dev team for the game to sell. Ergo we get games rife with cliche and boring, empty-vessel protagonists, simply meant to fulfill the base wishes of the main gaming demographic--the 'Power Fantasy' point you were talking about. \n\nI like Dark Souls because my character felt more insignificant. My character was not The Chosen One (tm) on a quest to Save The World.  I was just some lost soul, aimlessly running around in a gothic purgatory madhouse, trying to scrape together some meaning in an otherwise meaningless existence (just like in real life! :D) They did a great job of conveying that, and the claustrophobia created a strange sense of \"openness.\" Can't describe it too well. \n\nOne of my favorite stories in gaming is, hands down, Mother 3. That game had such a well-developed, emotional narrative that drew me in and made me cry. No other video game has actually brought me to that level. And that game had practically *zero* choice, was extremely linear, and very much on-rails; pretty much the antithesis to the conventions we see in modern Western RPGs. \n\nBut because there was so much care put into character development and setting, it created a much more involved experience than, say, Skyrim. Where I'm just some Chosen One who has to Save The World by doing whatever the hell I want, if I felt like it. The game was totally cool with the fact that I didn't feel like Saving The World, and it didn't matter if I made myself a Dual-Dagger wielding plate-armored Mage-Summoner-Stealth-Assassin. \n\nThe choices seemed so vast that none of them really mattered, and with it, my protagonist. Oh, sure, the game went out of it's way to tell me how important I was by giving me shouty-powers and having every single character freak out over my Chosen One status, but in the end the character was nothing more than a blank slate who didn't do much. I felt no connection with him, or the overall story. \n\nSo....actually, I think games may benefit more by concentrating more on developing actual characters and narrative than giving the player unlimited choices and control over those things. Maybe not *completely* eliminate that from the equation (after all, as you mentioned, it's one of the unique strengths of the medium) but maybe just....dial it down a bit from where we are now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423924643", "subreddit": "truegaming", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Look at your left hand. Look at how it's completely surrounded by keys. Most of which don't do anything or do useless crap like sitting down and sheathing your weapon. Now consider that each of those buttons could be doing something awesome like casting a spell or dealing damage. \n\nIf you've ever played a first person shooter on the PC, you should be familiar with the controls there. By default, most games use WASD for forward, backward, strafe left, and strafe right. They use the mouse to look left and right and don't use keys to do it. If you apply that logic to WoW, you gain another 2 buttons free to assign skills to.\n\nSo what you should do to start out is rebind your keys so 'A' is strafe left and 'D' is strafe right, and unbind the keys for turn left and turn right. Then when you want to turn your character, hold the right mouse button and move your mouse like you were playing a first person shooter. Note that this makes your cursor disappear in-game so you couldn't even click your skills if you wanted to while doing this. \n\nAnother important skill, but one that doesn't come from first person shooters, is that in WoW if you hold both the left and right mouse buttons at once, your character automatically walks forward. This is useful if you need to move forward and press a button on the keyboard that is difficult to reach while simultaneously holding W to move forward.\n\nAlso, a key thing to understand is that pretty much **everyone** clicks on things that they don't use in combat or don't need to hit very often, such as your mount, your 1 hr class buffs, food/water, elixirs/flasks/potions, some long cooldown abilities or highly situational spells, etc. When people say \"clicking\" is bad they're talking about your primary rotational spells that you'll be hitting every 1-5 seconds.\n\nSo now that you've done some moving around with your new setup and hopefully gotten used to that, go to the interface option and enable all the other action bars. Then go to keybinds and pick an action bar to start putting your other keybinds on. Then assign Q E R T F G Z X C V to the buttons on that bar. Yes this will overwrite a bunch of default binds. Don't worry about that just yet. If you panic you can always reset them all to default and start over. Now bind the main skills you use to either 1-5 or those keys you just bound a moment ago, trying to put the ones you use most in the easiest to reach places, especially keys that are easy to hit while also hitting WASD.\n\nLater, a more advanced technique is to start binding keys on other action bars to Shift + key and Alt + key and Ctrl + key, and then combinations like Shift + Alt + key. If you have more than 2 mouse buttons you can assign hotkeys to those, too, along with the Shift/Alt/Ctrl modifiers on top of that. But start out small and simple, and expand from there.\n\nKeep in mind that there will be a period of adjustment, possibly a long one, where you will feel like you are playing way worse and way more slowly. This is *not* a sign that clicking is superior to key binds. It's you having to retrain your brain to use a new control scheme. This literally happens to everyone who tries a new control scheme for any game and it's a hump you have to get over to adjust to something new. \n\nFinal note: I don't actually use WASD. Since playing Quake almost 20 years ago I've been using ESDF to move, since that puts my fingers more naturally on the home row and opens up more keys on the left side to use for key binds in games. You might want to try that if it helps you, but so many games just default to WASD anyway that if you get in the habit of using ESDF you end up having to rebind your keys for literally every PC game you play. So it's up to you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423955735", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "At the risk of sounding like I'm whining, I just think the range nerf is too much. They can have the Q damage nerf, they could've even upped it for all I care, or removed the W nuke altogether, just give me back my boy's range.\n\n\nI will stand by the fact that he has plenty of counterplay. Get your jungler for early ganks, focus him as soon as he sets one of his royal feet too far into his territory, position yourself to interrupt his E or bait it out altogether then wreck his face 'cause that thing is on long-ass cool down. Alongside that fact, champions like LeBlanc and Zed are still widely popular and excel against the average Azir already make Azir's job hard enough as is.\n\n\nI've heard him be classified as a lategame hypercarry, but so is Vayne, both of which require a lot of patience and skill to play effectively, as much as it hurts me to say that considering I despise Vaynes with a passion. But where a Vayne who knows what she's doing can start wrecking face in the bot lane and the late game when she's got the early snowbal, I would argue that an Azir required a bigger lead to reach that same level of dominance, on top of the knowledge required to play him effectively and not stumble yourself into the enemy team while trying to pull off the W E Q R insec.\n\nIn the hands of someone who knows how to play him, he's an absolute unapologetic monster of a champion. But I feel the keyword in the whole ordeal is letting him actually become that force to be reckoned with. If you pick a teamfight in any part of the jungle with an Azir on the enemy team, that's just shortsightedness on your own part if you **know** his thing is zone control.\n\n\nAll saltiness on my boy's nerfs aside, I'm conflicted. I love Azir. I find him unique and the most satisfying champion to do well with. But I'm very hesitant to play him now. I can't even hit the ranged minions anymore, or poke through them. (Which is what I assume lead to the initial complaints of 'Azir too stronk') I'll see what Riot has in store for him. I can only hope they at least restore his range. But especially as his main, I know better than anyone exactly how ridiculous he can be, and I can't rightfully contest the nerfs.

{"body": "I'm 25 now and I've had my best friend Max since we were 9. Me and my other buddy Charlie used to sleep over Max's house E V E R Y saturday night, starting from age 10 or 11. He had -THREE- good computers and FAST internet and we'd go over there and play video games with eachother all night. When we were about 13 or 14 Max's parents went through a horrible divorce. Both parents moved from our hometown to places that were about 45 minute drive, in the opposite direction of eachother. To make it worse, they got split custody, he spent every other week in a completely different and new town, and left our school. Both parents played on his emotions, to make them side with one another, and the fact that he was in new places fucked him up even more. I was also really distraught because I didnt have many friends, let alone best friends, and the sleepovers every Saturday was something I looked forward to every single day of the week. I made a pact with him that no matter what I would sleep over his house still every Saturday, whichever one he was at. Spent a lot of time begging/arranging rides and using Christmas and birthday money for cab rides back and forth. Around this time Charlie got really into hard drugs/pills and stopped hanging out with us, so it was just me and max. I made it there every Saturday until the summer of 07' when I went to Australia for a month. We continued to have the sleepover LANs pretty much every Saturday for that year until we graduated high school and went to college. He's never been the most booksmart guy, but he has the most amazing work ethic and outlook on life. He never has had it easy and he's pulled through and came out to be a boss. I wish I could be more like him sometimes. He's the only friend I've had and I mean only who hasn't stabbed me in the back over money or something stupid. He's the only friend I've actually kept straight for 15+ years. I've always been there for him and he's always been there for me. Totally teared up writing this. We both still consider each other best friends and talk all the time. If I ever get married, he will be my best man.

{"body": "I really enjoy this series but I really can't agree with this episode.\n\nYou state (paraphrased):\n\n&gt;Execution introduces similar problems to output randomness. It distorts the feedback from decision making. A good decision may yield a negative result based on execution.\n\nIn that case, is it really a good decision? Execution adds another layer to the decision making, it's not just \"will this action be most beneficial\" it becomes \"Is this action the most beneficial *for me*?\". That is, it's not just a binary best/not best decision any more, it becomes a risk taking/risk minimizing decision. This also applies to output randomness in the sense that it changes the decision making process but doesn't necessarily make it worse.\n\nThat's not to say high execution thresholds and output randomness are good for *all* games but I think it's quite a stretch to suggest that these elements should *always* be minimized or are inherently poor.\n\n&gt;Games should not contain execution thresholds because contests fulfill that purpose instead.\n\nAgain, there is value in determining execution ability *and* decision making ability. I don't think there is a single widely played competitive game that involves no execution threshold or at the very least attempt to hinder a player's physical ability to make decisions.\n\nCompetitive darts (one of the examples from the video) involves deciding which target to shoot for. Some targets are easier to hit and pay out fewer points, some are more difficult and pay out more points. Depending on game situation players shoot for different targets.\n\nCompetitive poker involves bluffing and acting to convince players that the game is in a certain state when it is not (or is). This is most definitely an execution skill.\n\nCompetitive chess is played within a time limit, requiring the player to potentially stave off forfeit by making fast moves which is a hindrance to proper decision making.\n\nCompetitive (all) sports are fairly self explanatory.\n\n&gt; Execution thresholds limit the play to shallow interactions.\n\nI would argue the exact opposite, adding execution ability actually increases the possibilities for meaningful game interactions.\n\nWhen you eliminate execution threshold in your game the progression of the game becomes far shallower. When a new player starts out, they are presented with a set of options A B C D E F G. These options are interesting and present new challenges and the player has a lot of fun figuring out how to tackle each game's situations. The problem is that the the first time the player makes decision A which leads to decision E which leads to decision G is the same as the 20th time decision A leads to decision E which leads to decision G. No one \"queen's gambit\" in chess is any better than any other \"queen's gambit\". Every option is available to every player at any given time.\n\nNow let's look at the same game which heavily involves execution as a game mechanic. You still have the same options but let's say when you first start out, you're only really good enough to try options A, B and C. You know options D through G are there but you're not really confident enough to actually execute the strategies. As you get better and better at the game, suddenly you can begin adding tools to your repertoire. With mastery suddenly you don't need to pre split your Starcraft 2 marines in case of banelings, you can concentrate them for better firepower and then split them once danger arises. This allows you new attack timings and build orders since you can make fewer units more effective.\n\nWhat's more, adding a skill requirement means you make it easier for player emergent game play. Once a player has mastered strategies A through G suddenly they start exploring a neat trick which enlightens them to the existence of decisions H and I. You didn't even intend for decisions H and I to exist. An example of this would be Mutalisk stacking in Starcraft: Brood War, wave dashing Super Smash Brothers: Melee or puck tipping in Hockey.\n\nFor more explanation on this point watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxx55e1ZQCY).\n\nBasically, this video came off as very \"anti-physical skill\" and I just can't agree with the merits of that. Video games and games in general have basically been built upon a foundation of execution thresholds from Mario to Mega man to Counter Strike.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1423965183", "subreddit": "gamedesign", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

You're preventing them from 'living,' which *just so happens* to prevent the child from reproducing.\n\nAlso, autism or down's syndrome isn't something that affects *only* the individual 'afflicted' by it (for lack of a better term) - there can be significant challenges for the parent of these children.

I'm quite envious of your Norns :)\n\nAcline will be a huge key sub when providing burst for him(her?)self and DQXQ (and any other healers you have on your team) while bringing far higher stats than Shynee.  \n\nL.Kali is pretty good as well.  She brings an active that can guarantee a DQXQ burst while also bringing high stats and good awakenings.  \n\nYour box seems pretty solid IMO.  I personally use Blue Odin as a sub that covers the dark requirement because of his fantastic RCV and HP stats and his \"oh-shit\" active which can keep you alive.\n\nI gotta say...with your subs you should just run with what makes you comfortable.  Once you have leveled your subs then you can take down Valk no problem.  \n\nEventually I can say you could go healer focus because Arcline will give you burst needed to take down descend bosses.  \n\n&gt; DQXQ - L.Kali - Arcline - Lakshimi (B/G) - Blue Odin/GZL - DQXQ\n\n^ Pretty strong team offering healer burst to 5/6 cards on the team.  Small backup burst (GZL) in case Arcline + x16 wasn't enough.  This would be my goto team for Valk if I had to utilize your box.  You could swap out your dark sub for Echidna if you don't feel you can one-shot Valk herself.\n\n&gt; DQXQ - L.Kali - Arcline - Echidna - Valk (you can do it!) - DQXQ\n\n^ Really strong (but gutsy) light focused healer team that does not cover dark but offers really high burst after actives.  If you can activate DQXQ's LS confidently without dark then this is the team for you.  Echidna offers delay utility and Valk gives good stats and heartbreak burst if you have R G B L orbs and don't need hearts to proc DQXQ LS.  This would be a the best team to take down further descends such as Hera-Is and Ur.\n\nYou could probably theory craft more teams depending on the dungeon and your subs.  The fun and amazing thing about DQXQ is that she is so flexible!  Have fun with her potential :)\n\nP.S.

And that was just the beginning of her being booked every damn night for almost two years now. \n\nAND 3 RAVE REVIEWS from the New York Times even in the paper Sunday edition. Not a single other drag queen can boast that record. NOT EVEN THE LEGENDS like Bunny or Jackie Beat. THIS is why Jackie Beat has so much respect for Jinkx. \n\nGet a fucking GRIP. Honey was not/is not even a full time drag queen she's a social worker. \n\nJinkx Monsoon got the MC gig at Julia's the number one drag show in the PacNW way before drag race AND worked three theater productions that same year she did drag race. She was a seasoned PERFORMER and knew how to succeed in those challenges. It had NOTHING to do with her Reddit proclaimed\"underdog\" status which she wasn't even an underdog she was a FRONTRUNNER, for chrissakes. She kicked EVERYONE'S ass on that season. \n\nHoney couldn't even pull off that freaking stupid 2 minute \"acting\" role for Draggle Rock, and need I remind you Jinkx stole the show on THAT CHALLENGE, TOO. \n\nThe same year Jinkx did Hedwig TWICE, which is a 2 hour long MONOLOGUE and musical with her on stage virtually alone the entire time. \n\nWe won't even DISCUSS that douche chilling \"Diana Ross\" FUBAR.\n\nDumb ass didn't even KNOW Diana Ross *DID* WEAR an orange CAFTAN and she didn't wear it for the PERFORMANCE! hahahahaha\n\nGet a fuckin grip on reality. \n\nYou should be able to make your case without tearing other queens down and B I A N C A? \n\nLMFAO.

That ordering is based on an old poem that used every syllable once, though the language has changed since and it doesn't quite work if pronounced the modern way. It goes (and I had to look this up past the first line):\n\n    i ro ha ni ho he to\n    chi ri nu ru wo\n    wa ka yo ta re so\n    tsu ne na ra mu\n    u wi no o ku ya ma\n    ke fu ko e te\n    a sa ki yu me mi shi\n    we hi mo se su\n\nSo yeah, not exactly useful information but I guess something for you to 'TIL' about.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424074209", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Use your auto attacks to harass the enemy and farm. If you can Q to last hit AND line it up so that the enemy is poked, that's about the only time you want to use it, at least until you have mama regen. Max R Q E W when you can, but if they have a good assassin/bursty type of champ, R Q W E can help keep them off your carries.\n\nI would say, rush Morellos. If the enemy mid laner is heavy AP then Athene's could be fine. If they are an AD assassin, then rushing Seeker's Armguard and then Morello is good, or just grab the Zhonya's if you can manage your mana well. Morello's into Deathcap is a decent build, then get Zhonya's. Fit boots where you can. Always go Lucidity boots. You aren't a damage dealer, so Magic Pen isn't super effective. Lulu is a utility mage whose utility scales well off of AP. More AP means bigger shields and ults.\n\nNow some people argue going Lich Bane and Void Staff, which gives damage. Sure that's fine. However, I really like to augment Lulu's utility myself. If I already have the damage in AP top lane and an AD jungle, I would build a Mejai's. Mejai's Lulu is similar to Mejai's Janna. They can keep themselves alive pretty well, especially after Lulu has Zhonya's, so the stacks can be managed to increase your AP utility. For the last item, I'd buy something situational that the team could use. Locket? Frozen Heart? Twin Shadows? Banner of Command? You can't really go wrong with tank stats, mana or AP right here.\n\nThere are many other builds out there, though. Lulu's passive augments her AAs very well, so some people build AD/AS Lulu. Others go for more of a hybrid AP/AS Lulu. And there are APC Lulu builds as well. I personally think Lulu shines with her AP utility scaling and saving her teammates.

{"body": "For questions like these it helps to draw a diagram and label each region with the number of elements in it, that way it's easier to see what you need to add and subtract. \n\nAnyway, notice that if n(AnB)=n((AnBnC')U(AnBnC)) (elements are either in A, B, and C or just A and B). Since the last two are mutually exclusive, we can solve algebraically: 7=n(AnBnC')+3, n(AnBnC')=4. The same can be done for the other 2 intersections, and we'll find that n(AnBnC') = n(AnB'nC) = n(A'nBnC) = 4. So now we have 4 mutually exlusive regions, AnBnC, AnBnC', AnB'nC, and A'nBnC. Notice if we add up their elements, we get 3+4+4+4=15, so we accounted for all elements in A U B U C.\n\nNow to solve your questions, we can just add up the above sets that include what we're trying to find, for example, n(A U B) = n(AnBnC)+n(AnBnC')+n(AnB'nC)+n(A'nBnC)=15 (All of these sets are exclusive and either part of A or B).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424110606", "subreddit": "learnmath", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The only people that really counter Vayne are Ashe, Draven, and Graves IMO.

{"body": "One of the first things I constantly remind my friends who setup their home theaters is this:\n\n\"How much do you know about sound? Shaping it, mixing it, tuning it, refining it? If you wanted to hear the sound of the drumsticks hitting that cymbal more what freq would you boost? Hows the reverb on that snare? Are those vox too wet for you?\"\n\nThat usually leads to a confused look, which leads me to my point.\n\n\"Well, the guy who recorded them and tuned them in a studio build for perfect sound reproduction does. That room costs more than your entire house, and this dude probably has 10+ years experience. **Who the fuck are you to mess with the EQ? Set it flat before you hurt yourself and live with it for awhile**\"\n\nOvertime their ears acclimate and they notice so much more detail in the music it blows their mind. Setting your EQ flat can be as good as a significant speaker upgrade depending upon your understanding of audio. Someone like me can dial it in for *our* taste. Audiophiles can certainly find what they're looking for. The dudes at /r/carSQ? Shit, I'd go to them for advice personally, I know sound, but *they* know *car sound*. \n\nBut the average joe? Deaf as fuck. They boost the lows and highs because that's all they know, and their ears are usually toast from sound exposure, and they think it's golden by making the frequency spectrum look like a fucking \"V\".\n\nLike I said time and time again here -- I'm no car AV guru by ANY means. Don't wanna mislead you all. But I do have ears, and I know how to use them.\n\n**My golden rules for EQ'ing theaters/sound systems**\n\n1) Mids are the star of the show. They are the most important factor to dial in meticulously or your entire mix will falter.\n\n2) Keep your EQ as close to flat as possible for dat detail. Don't be afraid to roll off frequency instead of adding, it's typically more effective.\n\n3) Keep your ears fresh (When setting up sound the most important thing is taking breaks.. As time goes on your ears start compressing sound, it's almost unnoticeable but it's the first (invisible) sign of ear fatigue. Take a break every 45m to an hour and go do something for 10-20 minutes without a lot of sound. Let your ears relax and come in with fresh ears... You may be surprised that it doesn't sound the same anymore.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n**Basic Frequency Breakdowns**\n\n* **Sub-Bass** - The very low bass between 16 and 60Hz which encompasses sounds which are often felt more than heard, such as thunder in the distance. These frequencies give the music a sense of power even if they occur infrequently. Too much emphasis on this range makes the music sound muddy.\n\n* **Bass** - The bass between 60 and 250Hz contains the fundamental notes of the rhythm section so EQing this range can change the musical balance, making it fat or thin. Too much boost in this range can make the music sound boomy.\n\n* **Low Mids** - The midrange between 250 and 2000Hz contains the low order harmonics of most musical instruments and can introduce a telephone like quality to the music if boosted too much. Boosting the 500 to 1000Hz octave makes the instruments sound horn like, while boosting the 1 to 2kHz octave makes them sound tinny. Excess output in this range can cause listening fatigue.\n\n* **High Mids** - The upper midrange between 2 and 4kHz can mask the important speech recognition sounds if boosted, introducing a lisping quality into a voice and making sounds formed with the lips such as ‘m”, “b,” and “v” indistinguishable. Too much boost in this range, especially at 3kHz, can also cause listening fatigue.  Dipping the 3kHz range on instrument backgrounds and slightly peaking 3kHz on vocals can make the vocals audible without having to decrease the instrumental level in mixes where the voice would otherwise seem buried.\n\n* **Presence** - The presence range between 4 and 6kHz is responsible for the clarity and definition of voices and instruments. Boosting this range can make the music seem closer to the listener. Reducing the 5kHz content of a mix makes the sound more distant and transparent.\n\n* **Brilliance** - The 6 to 16kHz range controls the brilliance and clarity of sounds. Too much emphasis in this range, however, can produce sibilance on the vocals.\"\n\n____________ Examples _____________\n\nSay i'm mixing down drums and I solo the drum set. I'm listening to the cymbals. I take out the snare. I take out the kick. I take out the toms. I'm just hearing that delightful splash of cymbals. But how can I make it sound like they're right in front of me? I hear that splash but I don't hear that stick hitting it. I hear the splash but I don't hear that ring that comes with a piece of wood hitting metal. I'm displeased.\n\nMaybe I start with the high hat, or find a loop where the drummer is hitting the bell of the ride cymbal. But I don't want the splash or crash. That won't help what I'm looking for. No no, I want to hear that **STICK** hit that metal.\n\nI get to work at 3k. I put a wide Q and bring 3k up at least 2-3dB and I slowly (S L O W L Y) scan progressively higher until I hear that sweet, warm, 'ting' sound of wood hitting metal. Not the ringing of the cymbals, not a high pitched 'tick' sound. No. That warm, slightly dull, \"ting\". I slowly start lessening the Q and zero in on where that ting is located and maybe I end up boosting 1dB @ 3500hz on the ride only. Maybe that same sound on the High Hat lives at 4k?\n\nWhat about when I want to hear more of the sound of the strings from the guitar? I wanna hear the bassists fingers. What if I wanna hear the breath of the vox cut through the mix? Maybe I cut the breaths, give it their own track, route that back to the board and start fucking with the frequencies until the breath *alone* is tuned to my standards.\n\nThis is the stuff I hear on a day to day basis. To look at sound from my perspective it's like you guys looking at a finished building, the whole while i'm inspecting every bolt meticulously. So that building sounds fucking sweet.\n\nSet your speakers closer to flat. Live with 'em and see how they sound after a few weeks. Then make modest changes. You might be surprised, tuning and mixing is done in weeks, or months. Not hours. I spend hours on the reverb for the snare, not the *mix*. Take your time.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424149422", "subreddit": "CarAV", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I don't use autospace myself (I would love to eventually but I need time to get over my space bar habit) so I'm not exactly sure of this, but I reckon the autospace makes it less fluent to peck in swipe mode.\n\nThere are many words that require 1 to 3 individual pecks in a row in the swiping+tapping word construction combo. Take \"dissonance\" for example, that's \"d-i-s-s\" in 4 taps before you get to swipe \"on\". If you have autospace on and are not in peck mode, those 4 taps have to be pretty fast or you'd get d i s s onance. \n\nBut it's a very fine line to walk, to be honest, to differentiate between pecks that are part of a word contruction combo like above, or a peck that is just a single letter forming a word like \"a\". I think the current set up right now - requiring 4 pecks to trigger peck mode - is ideal, because you can't reasonably expect the keyboard to know upon every key tap that you're pecking part of a word and not to insert the autospace.\n\nThis is why I don't use autospace.

{"body": "It was on a Friday when the news of their discovery was leaked. There wasn't much fanfare with the news either, I guess, in part, due to the fact that most people thought it was something straight out of *The National Enquirer* or *The Onion*. But then people started seeing the videos. At first, the videos were of poor quality, as if they were taken from a camera recording a computer monitor, but as they went viral higher quality recordings started to pop up. \n\nThe videos were beyond creepy, like something from a sci-fi horror movie, and were relatively short. In the video, two people in white lab coats would be seen sitting at each side of a tall, clear cylinder filled with a liquid that many guessed to be water. Inside the cylinder was a creature that looked like a jellyfish, but with many long and thick limbs floating around like an octopus. The cylinder had some kind of speaker system positioned at the front and two tubes feeding out from the top that were hooked up to a large box.\n\nThirty seconds passed before the scientist on the left leaned forward, pressed a button near the front speaker, and said slowly, \"Can you hear me?\" The speaker emitted a series of low whistles before becoming silent again. The scientists looked at each other in excitement. The scientist on the right then leaned forward and slowly asked, \"Can you understand me?\" The speaker then emitted an identical pattern of low whistles. The scientist on the left started to ask another question, but the speaker suddenly came to life and produced a long pattern of short and long low whistles.  Shortly after this, the video abruptly ended. \n\nIt didn't take long for people to try and decipher what the pattern meant. What amazed some and spooked others was the fact that the pattern was in Morse Code. The creature had communicated and said: **I C A N L E A R N P L E A S E T E A C H M E**.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424165877", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**CONTINUED FROM PART 1 ABOVE!**\n\n**ITEM BUILDS + ADVICE FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIEND**\n\n*OFFLANE PLAYER*\n\nI play as the offflane player, fulfilling everything I mentioned in the sections above. I have also solo queued once as mid Zeus as well and won easily, but that game still wasn’t a fool proof win imo. I only did that one game solo as Zeus because someone insisted on going offlane solo. \n\nAlso, keep in mind, you can pick great offlaners such as Undying or someone like Tidehunter, but Spiritbreaker is still the best, and a hero like Undying can easily support you or just be a core or support in the safe lane. Omniknight is is still the best to support either you or the safe lane, but other supports can be used. I have a soft spot for keeper of the light as support as well. \n\nYou DO NOT have to pick SB immediately, only because nobody knows about this hero (until they read this guide or play against a good one)\n\nFor Spiritbreaker, the objective is to get power trends and 1-2 tp scrolls by 4:40 OR brown boots and wand with 1-2 tp scrolls. Right before the Year Beast spawns, you go heal up if nessecary then wait to see which lane your beast goes to. You can either teleport him to a lane or your choice or tp yourself while telling your team to come push with you. Your skill build should be 2-1-2 ( Q E Q E W R… Q Q E E etc etc.) If you can snag the nearby bounty rune at the 0 minute mark, this will help you a lot.\n\nStarting items for Spiritbreaker consist of two branches, one stout shield, 1 tango set and 1 healing potion\n\nAfter you get power trends to start, always have 1-2 tp scrolls on your person. After that you can easily get an urn and then immediately work towards a casual BKB. There is no real need to get blademail, or armlet, or something cheeky like a shadow blade. With that being said, I honestly feel that Agh’s is the undisputed king of luxury items on SB in Year Beast mode, ALTHOUGH I have never had a game that was long enough to get one.\n\n*MID PLAYER*\n\nYou SHOULD DEFINITELY pick Zeus as soon as possible. Letting the enemy team pick him is a crime against humanity. Either pick him quickly or wait no longer beyond the 30 second mark.\n\nMy friend plays as the mid player. He buys what I buy, along with many other Zeus players. A set of tangos and 2 clarities for Zeus. \n\nHe also has told me that he sometimes get 4 clarities and no tangoes to avoid issues with the enemy team hogging the runes and he enjoys trying to rush his soul ring after getting the first bounty before the first push. Still, tangoes and 2 clarity pots is pretty standard for Zeus and nothing changes here. If you do the correct skill build 1-3-1 (Q E Q W W R… W W E E etc. etc.) OR (Q E W W W R… W E E E etc etc) you can just use Q to last hit/harrass the enemy while poping clarity pots to dominate the lane. You will immediately get a bottle after a handful of last hits, especially if you were able to snag the bounty rune that is opposite of the offlane rune at the zero minute mark.\n\nObviously you get your bottle asap then brown boots. Try to time pushing the lane while killing as many creeps as possible before making a dash towards a rune to grab it. Pushing the lane forwards means nothing as long as you don’t overextend into a gank. If the enemy team over-commits to shutting you down, don’t worry as it will most likely bite them in the ass later during the first teamfights with Spiritbreaker. You only need bottle and brown boots and 1-2 tp scrolls before the 4:40ish mark and that’s not a tall order.\n\nAfter the bottle and boots, work on getting a soul ring and arcane boots, in either order. After that you should always work towards a bloodstone. There’s no reason not to rush a bloodstone. It gives you everything you need in a short term mode like Year Beast. Even if you have trouble getting it, soul ring is by far the best choice on Zeus for this mode. \n\nKeep in mind that as the mid player you are mostly in charge of microing your Year Beast as you assemble yourself and your team by it. If their Year Beast ends up in your lane with yours, that is the best sccenario. You simply tell your beast to target theirs and pop double damage while spamming your spells on the enemy Year Beast. Very few enemy heroes will be able to beat the dps you push out between you and your beast, thanks to static field. It’s highly recommended that your support (hopefully Omniknight) is with you and the beast, if not the rest of your team. if the others are dealing with the enemy Year Beast, that can work too. \n\nTypically you can work on an Agh’s right after you complete your Bloodstone. Other options? Blink, force staff and refresher orb.\n\n**THE REALLY GOOD TIER (THAT WILL GET SHIT ON BY SB AND ZEUS REGARDLESS)**\n\nYeah, call me an asshole, but most of the “really great” Year Beast picks are in fact, great…. Except there is one major problem. The problem is that they will get destroyed by the SB/Zeus combo. They will get beat even harder if you have Razor, Omni, Axe, or even other dependable heroes from this list or the next list on your team. \n\nI won’t explain why they are good or why they would get beat for every single hero. This guide is long enough, as is.\n\n* Huskar (I only added Huskar just because of all of the recent warlock golem cheese crap. If the enemy team picks something like Warlock, Zeus and Undying, Huskar can and will rape that team seeing as though it is so magic heavy. You must know how to build and play huskar though and try to end the game in a reasonable mount of time.)\n* Bristleback\n* Sven\n* Tiny\n* Brewmaster\n* Phoenix\n* Slardar\n* Wraith King\n* Undying\n* Luna\n* Mirana\n* Ursa\n* Gyrocopter\n* Ember Spirit\n* Troll Warlord\n* Vengeful Spirit\n* Shadow Fiend\n* Brood Mother\n* Slark\n* Windrunner\n* Lina\n* Lion\n* Shadow Shaman\n* Nature’s Prophet\n* Chen\n* Silencer\n* Keeper of the Light\n* Witch Doctor\n* Enigma\n* Pugna\n* Dazzle\n* Winter Wyvern\n\n**THE ACTUAL TOP TIER (GUYS THAT ACTUALLY DON’T GET BEAT UP TOO MUCH)**\n\nThere are a small handful of heroes I think are good picks and aren’t completely murdered by SB or Zeus. They are either durable against them or have ways to deal with them using their lv 6 and lv 11 ults. Keep in mind that Axe, Razor and Omniknight are still the best, even though they are also on this list.\n\n* Warlock (prevented my 10th win, also thanks to axe that stole farm and grieved our Year Beast)\n* Viper\n* Tidehunter\n* Razor\n* Axe\n* Omniknight\n\n**HONORABLE MENTIONS**\n\nOther than running [trollogist’s strategy](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2vy2in/guidehow_to_win_year_beast_game_f2p/) or running a pocket strat, I’m going to list some heroes that Trollogist mentioned… even though I don’t think they are very good.\n\n* Kunkka\n* Magnus\n* Timbersaw\n* Storm Spirit\n* Nyx\n* Oracle\n* Visage\n* Bloodseeker\n* Necrophos\n* Sniper (Only good past the 40 minute mark which rarely happens.)\n\n**SHIT TIER**\n\n* Everybody else!\n\nThere are too many reasons to list. Even if you can make an argument for any of them, the truth is that they are either too item dependent, too crappy in pushes, or SB/Zeus crushes them with ease.\n\n**GENERAL ADVICE**\n\n* Push with your Year Beast every time its up.\n* Try to put your Year Beast against their Year Beast during the first push every 5 minutes and kill theirs before they kill yours (which is very easy with Zeus’s static field, your supports and with your own Year Beast attacking theirs with double damage ALONG WITH lv 2 and 3 combat path. If you can’t dispatch the enemy Year Beast immediately while also keeping the enemy team at bay, then your Zeus player is just awful. (Keep in mind that this is also why Omniknight’s repel is nearly indispensable.)\n* Also keep an eye on your beast and don’t let it get kited by using the target command to focus on objectives or to run him backwards.\n* If your beast is wounded and it is tanking tower damage, don’t hesitate to try and teleport it backwards to save its life and buy it some more time.\n* Always teleport your Year Beast to another lane RIGHT BEFORE you destroy an enemy set of barracks.\n* Use heal on cooldown when the Year Beast is 80% or lower.\n* Always use double damage when starting in on a tower or fighting the enemy Year Beast.\n* Use global silence and Year Beast wrath liberally, in combination with Zeus ult and other global ults.\n* Obviously use Global Chakra when needed. (Let your mid/Zeus player handle that since he will put out the most damage.)\n* As the offlane player, ESPECIALLY as Spiritbreaker, communicate your every move/charge/ult/attack and order your team around. Tell them which lane to push. Your team WILL liste since they are mostly docile hat hungry traders just looking for items afterall. You won’t have to deal with big egos or 7k redditors that much.\n\n**BUT I DON’T HAVE ANY FRIENDS TO DO THIS WITH! WHAT NOW!?**\n\nEither play Spiritbreaker or one of the offlanes from the first two lists, such as Undying, Tidehunter, Razor or Axe. If one of your teammates locks in an offlane and calls it, then pick Zeus immediately and rock out with a solid Zeus performance!\n\n**WANT SOMETHING TO WATCH? MATCH ID TIME!**\n\n**1240658858**\n\nHere’s one of my favorites. Most of them are similar or I finish it much sooner, but I was solo queue, I didn’t even bother upgrading the Year Beast on time. I played Zeus only because Undying was picked and offlane was taken. \n\n**1243684415**\n\nAnother solid game with the combo.\n\n**1246103885**\n\nA recent game that ended up being closer. note that it went on longer than 30 minutes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424167520", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Unlike my previous profile pictures (mostly just my face), this one is both funny and conceptual and showcases my wit.   \n\n\nI'm Batman. EmmaStinsonXO is dressed up like a bird-- a Robin, to be more specific. I've got my arms akimbo and my chest out in an attempt to strike a pose like the one bodybuilders do. EmmaStinsonXO is being a spoilsport, though. She won't stand up. I keep trying to get her up on her feet but she just falls back to the ground. I don't see what's awesome about being limp like a fucking deadbody. Maybe she was being ironic when we spoke the first time.   \n\n\nOnce my new profile picture is uploaded I wait.

I hope you're taking this down. That's Facebook dot com slash Patrick T U R D I N. My email address is patrick.durden at gmail dot com. Phone number 760-987-6907.     \n**Parent** : Okay, what do you want me to do with that?    \n**You** : I'd like lots of new Facebook friends. Make sure there's a realistic ratio of men to women sending me friend requests, but the women must be really hot.     \n**You** : I'd also like emails and text messages addressed to me. Nice ones. Messages filled with concern- asking me how I am, if I've eaten lunch, how my love life is going. Are you even listening?    \n**Parent** : Yes, yes I am. Please don't hurt my daughter. I'll do exactly as you've asked me.    \n**You** : Thank you. I'll return EmmaStinsonXO soon as you do that.

I don't have my left arm and she's still playing dead. I slip my right hand into my trouser pocket to retrieve my phone. The bottom half of the screen is cracked forming magnificent patterns but the top half has fared better. I see notifications, lots of them; EmmaStinsonXO's parents delivered and how. I've been flooded with thousands of messages and emails, all deeply concerned for my wellbeing. I want to read them so I can feel cared for but I'm beginning to lose consciousness. It's time for me to return EmmaStinsonXO. I hear sirens blaring, I hope they're coming for her. How many likes does my new profile picture have?\n\nEdits: Damn formatting.

Go figure.\nIt makes a difference in the fact that drunks cant relate to prostituting yourself for for a fix or a hit. Most drunks have not pimped themselves or their partners out for dope money, nor have they been dope sick. Many have never stolen to support their habits either. They can not understand carpet farming or milk blood.  Very few understand the idea of throwing up and then drinking it again..eating scabs or drinking piss ..stealing their dying grandparents pain pills, scraping and eating the medicine jell from used pain patches, breaking and enterings, going through moms purse , taking liberties at  friends houses with medicine cabinets etc.... so i say there is a big difference. \nYour AA dope friends had already takin the elevator up several floors floors BEFORE they went to AA. And they were not able to, or at the least didnt share the real true reality of what being a crackhead/methhead/ junkie/ opium addict is actually like. \n\n*you posted \"if i went to NA\".

Generally, I think of extended chords in the major key of of the root of the chord (not the key of the song because that can make things messy).\n\nSo C up to the 13th would be C E G B D F A.\n\nThis brings us to the exception about thinking in the root.  The 7th is always assumed dominant.  So a C13 would be C E G Bb D F A.  A CM13 would be C E G B D F A.  Just remember that the 7th is special that way, but otherwise, as far as alteration of extended harmony goes, it's easier to think in the root of the major key.\n\nOver time you'll learn what sorts of things are more or less common.  For instance, you'll virtually never see your I chord be something like CM13 without #11.  Also, things like #5s and b9s are more common on V chords.  Basically, almost all of these have a functional reason for being the way they are.

I have a really vivid memory of hanging out with Matty after we did the first ever Cape Race show in Manchester at Satan's Hollow of him taking us out to this old red convertible he used to drive and showing us this version. So great.\n- Chocolate (Remix) - Don't know much about this one but I have it.\n\nB I G S L E E P / The Slowdown days\n\n- Ghosts (I bet you've all heard this one. It's a great, great song. I believe the reason this didn't come out was because Kings of Leon released a track called Radioactive and they thought it sounded too similar to it. Pretty cruelly, this was written before Radioactive was released in any fashion. Personally, I always got more vibes of The Lion King from this.)\n- One Wish (This had the vibe of an interlude, I don't remember much about it)\n- Sex\n- She Way Out (This might have just been a loop of a section)\n\nThe only thing I've seen mentioned that I'm not 100% positive that I have is Matches. That's an original that they recorded when they did the FOB / C&amp;C covers, but it was only ever on their PureVolume page, and not for very long. The band or maybe Owen the old guitarist are probably the only ones to ever have that file on disk.\n\nAs far as keeping in touch with them goes, the last time we did a show with them was just before they became The 1975 when they were called The Slowdown. We did a killer show at Sound Control with them, Tellison and Ghost Saddles (The singer of whom used to front an incredible band called The Maple State). We chat on Facebook Messenger occasionally but I haven't really seen much of them since things started blowing up for them, mostly because they honestly just haven't been around. The amount of touring they have done in the last 2 years has been staggering. I'm honestly surprised they haven't burned out; that they've only had to cancel one show in that period is really kind of impressive. I bumped into George in a supermarket in towards the end of 2013 (They were flying to Tokyo the next day and he was fresh out of socks. Cool story, Matt). I think that the was the last time I saw one of them IRL.\n\nAnyway, yeah. Hopefully that answers some questions.\n\nAnecdotally, let me know if you're interested in hearing anything from the scene that these guys came out of; it was kind of a cross-section of a fairly small Manchester scene, and a more national-but-still-insular set of UK pop-punk bands - most of which have now gone onto very different things and a few of whom I've no doubt you've heard of under other names. If you like the sound of that, I'll put some links together and there may well be more on this hard drive from that time period that I can dig out.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424211528", "subreddit": "the1975", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My understanding:\n\nThere is a terrible rap song by YUNG LEAN (who calls his crew SADBOYS) where in the middle of the song, they start spelling out S A D B O Y S (note the spaces, you are supposed to say each letter). This song rose to prominence (due to how hilariously bad it was) at the same time as a dota2 player named arteezy. Arteezy was well known for being a young and promising player, frequently streaming high level dota with terrible terrible taste in music, especially this new song. At this time Arteezy was becoming one of the highest ranked players in NA and was repeatedly playing a super annoying hero with a move that makes a really annoying noise and freezes everyone for like 5 seconds. He modded the game to change the noise that the move made into the part of the song where they spell out SADBOYS. From there Arteezy joined a team with several players with connections to EG basically on a tryout. If they did well, they would (and did) become EG. During their trial period, they went under the team name SADBOYS.\n\nSince then any misfortune for arteezy or members of the team (or any other team realaly) have been mocked by calling them SADBOYS. When a player made a blog post airing his teams dirty laundry, people starting calling them B L O G B O Y S. Which eventually became XXX - BOYS depending on what you were making fun of. That is the genesis of the term but im not sure where it went from there, its constantly referenced in dota but i believe it has entered into the lexicon of other communities as well (as the AGDQ reference would attest)\n\nnot to make this into a history of arteezy comment but just to clarify for those who would correct my dota history: I am aware that arteezy was already a well known player before this, i said he rose to prominence during the SADBOYS genesis because that is when he became a stable professional player but those following the scene would know he had a a stint with team Kaipi (who later would become C9) but had to leave due to school commitments. He also acted as a stand in for the same Kaipi/C9 squad during MLG columbus where he acquitted himself incredibly well and largely carried them to victory (a result that convinced him to join the SADBOYS squad professionally despite school commitments)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424218830", "subreddit": "smashbros", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Because no one will ever be able to get me to shut up about **Majora's Mask**, I'm sort of going to bring it up as a game with an on-paper terrible saving scheme, but ultimately one that's really amazing and thought out even if a tad player unfriendly.\n\nThe way saving in Majora's Mask worked (the original, not the 3DS version) is pretty akin to a few strategy games like Fire Emblem, or ironman XCOM. Every three day reset it would autosave, essentially returning you back to Day 1 with as much progress saved as that implies. (the world and events would reset, but warp points, songs, items, etc all remained) This meant every time you started playing you'd be returning to the same point, this sounds like a pretty bad system on paper, but what they did with it was amazing.\n\nEvery three day reset you're starting with the Happy Mask Salesman (the primary quest giver, who you only see a few times in the first two hours and then never again until the last moments of the final cutscene) standing right behind the door you walk through. This means every three day reset the primary goal is really subtly restated through his tiny presence. They even use the sound of the windmill as a sort of echoic memory device to get you to remember your first encounter with him. Every time you start the game you're reminded what to do, every time Link fails to save the world he's reminded he has to push forward.\n\nYou're able to keep one 'proper' save at a time, which stores not only all your items but also all of where you've been and what you've done in that current three day cycle. These saves can only be made at certain locations, and they delete themselves as soon as you load them. This also sounds pretty crappy when taken at face value, but it just amazes me with how well it works with the themes of the game. One of the things I find so magical about Majora's Mask is it tells a heroes journey, but a heroes journey where the hero can (and will) fail. It's such a rare thing to have that in games. The save stations sort of enhance that feeling that you're losing something, even if you're just loading the game. That time is ticking down even when you're not playing it. That all the fleeting connections you've made that cycle have to be remembered, because ultimately what else is there?\n\nNow, **Donkey Kong Land 1** is truly a game with a bad save system. But one that's really defined how I play every game in that series in a really positive way. You can only save in that game if you gather every single K O N G letter in a level. For all intents these are a bonus thing meant for the best players of the game to discover and deftly collect, so it seems weird to punish the players who can't do it by saying \"hyack hyack hyack, you can't save!\" To save the game you even had to spend items that were reset on every load.\nMy girlfriend grew up with Donkey Kong Country where you just get to save no matter what. (bah!) For her K O N G letters aren't that important, for me they're things I have to strive for. As a result I tend to try a lot harder to find and collect secrets in Donkey Kong.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424223365", "subreddit": "GirlGamers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**Part IV** (final part)\n\n * Q: Will angel rings be really hard to craft? Or will they be disabled in TPPI2?\n  * It will be enabled. It will cost you 20% of your health permanently. That includes any health that you add through Tinker's Construct heart canisters. You *will*… (because I know that just turned off a lot of you, and you're going to complain because it's a permanent debuff.) You will be able to craft that health pack. It will either cost you a dragon egg, which you can either only get one of… you can only get one of. If you're going to craft it with the dragon egg, you can't reset the End. We don't have magic bees, though, do we? Isn't that working? Yeah, once you get magic bees, you'll be able to craft the egg. Right now you cannot craft another egg. For those of you saying, \"Oh, Hardcore Ender Expansion lets you reset the End.\" – You need the dragon egg for that. So, yeah. Alternatively, you know those enhanced Galgadorian blocks that nobody ever makes because they're not worth it? Is 10% of your health worth it? Because that's what you get. Yeah, that's how you get it back. \n\n * Q: What kind of load times are you guys experiencing?\n  * Thirty-eight minutes? Are you serious with that eskaay? I thought you were joking. Yeah, yeah, I'm completely joking. I think I loaded it in 5 minutes, 22 seconds. I load on a MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, and it loads in about 7 minutes, I think. Yeah, that's on the high-end. My PC is probably more like 2-3 minutes, but I have a really fast PC so… it will vary between there. It's probably about the same as in 1.6, honestly. On a high-end processor, it will take much less to load than your general standard PC that you would buy in a store. It also depends on the speed of your RAM and what DDR you have. Not meaning *Dance Dance Revolution* here. If you *need* faster, removing Gregtech reduces that by… so much.\n\n * Q: Why do you think the Mo' Creatures dev won't allow his mod to be included in modpacks?\n  * We have talked about this before. We're actually going to turn that into just a general question of, \"Why do some people not allow their mods in packs?\"  \n– Version control - there is none when you let modpacks use your mod  \n– You will always receive bug reports of old versions of your mod, which will usually include things that you have fixed *months* ago.\n\n * Q: How important will Greg Tech be in TPPI2?\n  * The same as TPPI1. It will not be required for any other mods. You can still go through IC2 without touching Greg Tech at all. Yeah. Hopefully. Hopefully, yeah. If we can beat Greg into submission enough, it will be the same as TPPI1. If not, you'll have to kind of deal with the small little places where he sticks his fingers.\n\n * Q: With all the oregen changes [GregTech] makes it seems almost impossible to ignore it. Is there going there going to be an option for me to play tech [in TPPI2] and ignore it?\n  * Yes. Yes. \n\n * Q: Will [TPPI2] include extra configs like in TPPI1?\n  * No. We included that because we needed to comply with the Feed The Beast universal configs. That is the only reason. There is no reason to anymore because there's no item IDs, which is what the universal configs were for. If we did it now, We would just be supplying default config files that would get generated if we didn't supply them. So, yeah. And we're not going to spend time balancing around mods that we're not officially supporting. So, yeah. Pretty much it will work, but the only problems you're going to have is stuff when world generation gets in the way because a lot different mods have their own copper and stuff like that. It's just going to generate on their own. And there's nothing you can do about it, unless you turn it off yourself. So that's pretty much it. That's pretty much the only incompatibility you'll find. \n\n * Q: You mentioned you're interested in adding mods… \n  * No we didn't. Re-read the OP. \n\n * Q: What sorts of reasoning are used when deciding upon the relative costs of items and ore distribution in the pack?\n  * Playability. Yeah, just play it [and] see how it feels. [If] \"this is too easy\" [or] \"this is too hard\" [then] change it. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n * Q: Why are you not going with GregTech ore gen? Personally, I think it's the best part of Greg Tech, and it seems like a total ass-ache to redo all of it in COFH.\n  * It's not a total ass-ache because we only had to add seven ores? I think? Uhh, I believe it was eight, but yeah. Eight, okay.  So it's not that bad. It's just JSON files, so it's not that difficult. We can't do GregTech ore gen because it really doesn't fit the pack. And every other pack that includes Greg Tech uses that ore gen. So, yeah. Yeah, it's just… We have this whole custom ore gen going that we already have our own style and then it's just like this completely undoes it, so eh! \n\n * Q: What is going to be about the pretty-much-required Mekanism fork? \n  * We're going to fork it. We're going to fix it. And you're going to like it. It's going to keep going on. \n\n * Q: When can we expect a new release of TPPI Tweaks? \n  * Once we get the libraries to build again because they don't build right now. Don't know why, but they don't. Blame tterrag, yep. I don't know, ugh! It's your job to know. \n\n * Q: Either start answering questions or give us the video or the date for the video you're so keen on making. \n  * No.\n\n * Q: Given that most people's experiences with individual mods is through YouTube videos, for better or worse, Is it a good idea to balance the pack through NEI recipes that will only serve to confuse a player that is new to a mod pack?\n  * No, because every single recipe that we change through, well at least through TPPI Tweaks, which is most of them… Well it has a tooltip description of why we changed it. And unless you know the recipe by heart, you will see that. Yeah. So, yeah. I mean, we're nowhere near as bad as Agrarian Skies where a blood altar takes flux electrum ingots? I dunno. I dunno, anyways, there's things in there that don't make any sense at all, but people are fine with it. \n\n * Q: What is the most difficult thing you've had to deal with in the update to 1.7.10?\n  * Mod updates. But now that we're so late into 1.7.10 – Greg Tech. It just… It… Everything was working fine, and then we install GregTech, and everything broke. Everything. E v e r y t h i n g. And real life, really, also gets in the way. All of us have real lives. Yeah, there's this terrible thing called \"college\" which pretty much all of us are involved in some way or another. I'm involved in it by not doing it. Hey, there you go. That's a good solution for me. \n\n * Q: Will there be Ancient Warfare? If not, I highly suggest Ancient Warfare. \n  * No. And since you asked, never.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424244404", "subreddit": "TestPackPleaseIgnore", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Additionally..\n\n&gt; Please ignore the above in the following circumstances\n\nYou have several situations that do not fit into your model, and consider them as exceptional cases. Unfortunately there is no reason to think that these \"exceptions\" are finite.\n\n\"It's wet when it's raining, but please ignore that pond.\"\n\nI find this disappointing because it is possible to reason about good readability as it comes to variable naming. Although that is very narrow viewpoint.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of good reasons to use one-letter to four-letter long variable names. They are quick to read, short to type, compact.\n\nThere are plenty of things not communicated by variable names. To see this, remove everything that's not a variable from your code samples:\n\n    hamlet B E T N O R be B E to T O or O R not N O T to be or not to be join\n\nThere are also plenty of things communicated by variable names, and in that context the whole is perhaps lot more important than individual names. To figure this out, rename every unique variable with a random unique name in some real code sample.\n\nFor example:\n\n    def translate_expr_binary(env, string):\n        return env.new_node(ast.Str, string)\n\n    def translate_expr_string(env, string):\n        return env.new_node(ast.Str, string)\n\nNow read:\n\n    def al(rr, zh):\n        return rr.kk(ax.a, zh)\n\n    def gq(eo, ks):\n        return eo.kk(ax.a, ks)\n\nI noticed my random generator produces very distinct names. Additionally you may consider variable names that aren't distinct:\n\n    def al(ai, al):\n        return ai.a(ax.a, al)\n\n    def gj(ay, au):\n        return ay.a(ax.a, au)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424247456", "subreddit": "programming", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

In no way am I suggesting that it's a bad idea, however it didn't work for me as I too had tried a similar method.  Also for the reason of mapping keys to your hand, you know?  Knowing that the note is represented by the letter G isn't going to help you if you can't find it on the piano.  I suppose that is just my opinion though.\n\nIf there's one thing I've taken out of trying to learn things, it's that you have to ENJOY learning.  I definitely have learned things using repetition but I think the learning process is significantly slower. This is kind of what I was trying to stress in above paragraph.  It's not that complicated but I think a lot of people don't realize how important that is.\n\nSo how do you read sheet music?  You just need to do it lots!  If you're just starting out I highly recommend only looking at songs with little to no accidentals (sharp or flat notes).  I think it's okay to count lines, or use things like Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge (E G B D F or every line on the right hand).  Eventually the need for that subsides and you just KNOW the notes.  Kind of like how you're reading this text right now. You're not slowly sounding out each word (like a kid learning to read might) but rather you already know the words because you've used or seen them before.\n\nSomething I remember doing when I started out was trying to perfect a song.  This might be okay for this particular song but **remember, you're trying to learn how to play piano, not this song.**  That is, you should not be spending all of your practice time trying to master your favorite tune.  You need to expose yourself to many different sheets. The reason for this is you become too familiar with the notes, you get to the point where you have memorized each individual note.  Whenever you play that song you start playing from memory instead of the sheet music.  I'm not saying you have to play a new piece every time you practice, just make sure that you don't spend too long on one piece.

Minor chords are the same but the 3rd is flat (one fret down on a guitar). \n\nGuitar is very pattern based. Once you learn the relative distance between pitches on the fretboard you will be well on your way to mastering it. \n\nAs far as inversions, consider a major chord. If you play the 1, 3 and 5 of C major (C E G) you have C major. If you play the same notes, but in a different order (E G C), you still have C major but sounding slightly different. Playing the exact same notes in a different order is called an inversion. If you want to learn more about inversions check out the CAGED system.

{"body": "Eu ia pôr isso na descrição, mas decidi postar nos comentários para criar uma thread com outros recifenses ou pernambucanos que queiram adicionar comentários.   \nO sotaque recifense se resume a poucas coisas essenciais:   \n* **T e D iguais**. O T e o D sempre seguem o mesmo som. Da De Di Do Du têm a mesma pronúncia do D, assim como no T. Por ser as vezes meio difícil de manter a pronúncia, a gente tende a trocá-los por outros sons ou dar mais força tirando o som das vogais. Um recifense diria Vinte, Vint-.    \n* **Vogais com sons diferentes**. A gente diz que *Recife* pode ser pronunciado de três formas: Rêcife, Récife ou Ricife. E a letra E ao final de palavras não é pronunciado muito forte, é mais um auxiliar para dizer a consoante. Algo como Rêcif-. Dependendo de onde seja, a duração das vogais mudam. Na periferia é mais comum falar todas as vogais, tipo Rêcifi. No meio de palavra então, o E pode ser fechado como no Sul. No bairro da Boa Vista, tem a Rua Riachuélo, mas é comum chamar a loja de Riachuêlo por causa dos comerciais que meio que ensinam, apesar da Riachuelo ser uma loja de origem recifense com sede no Nordeste.   \n* **E e O mudam muito para I e U**. Os sulistas passam por estranhos por aqui por causa disso. Pronunciar todas as vogais no mesmo tom soa muito estranho. Mas como a televisão mostra bastante os sotaques sulistas (85% sotaque carioca, 5% paulistanos, 10% outras regiões), também não é difícil achar muitas pronúncias. A língua purtuguesa ou pôrtuguesa, O istado Ispírito Santo ou Êspirito Santo.   \n* **O S com som de Ce**. Quando o C faz som de S antes de E e I, esse som praticamente faz todos os sons de S. E quem tem o sotaque forte quase tende a assobiar.        \n* **O ritmo tende ao final**. Acho que isso é bem geral no Nordeste, a pronúncia tende ao final. A gente tende a empurrar o som pro final, é isso que dá aquele tom meio engraçado. Sotaques do sul soam metálicos porque faz parecer que seguram o som, sem falar o fator.    \n* **Tu**. A gente usa mais o tu. Em quase todos os tempos verbais troca-se apenas o Você com a mesma conjugação. Exceto verbos curtinhos, como \"Tas bem?, Vais aonde?\". No passado simples a gente conjuga o Tu, mas duma forma diferente. Tu falasse, Tu comesse, Tu visse, Tu ouvisse, Tu assistisse, Tu estudasse. Tira o T e põe um S e pronto, *conjugasse* o verbo. Daí a expressão \"Visse?\".   \nDa mesma forma, imperativos na segunda pessoa são mais comuns. \"Fala para mim, me diz a verdade\" (Banda Calypso hehe) é mais natural que \"Fale para mim, me diga a verdade\". \"Arruma tua cama, menino\" é mais mãe nordestina que \"Arrume sua cama\" que parece slogan de propaganda.    \n*Sulista, alguém que vem do Sudeste ou do Sul.

{"body": "&gt; It's disappointing to see that the view times they mention the causes of global warming, they completely ignore the largest single cause.\n\nThis is a gross simplification and a lazy thing to say given the top comment is a link to a leading scientific body, and your response is Forbes citing another magazine.\n\nMinoru Kyo in *Already Extinct* looks at impact as a product of population, lifestyle, organisation, and technology (I = P x L x O x T). Something like \"animal agriculture\" is a problem because of overpopulation, lifestyles in developed nations, an organised political system that represses climate action, and that it is an old technology. The IPCC states that climate change is driven by economic and population growth. This is the truest thing you can say - it is a truth under which \"animal agriculture\" sits (as well as energy infrastructure, land clearing, and transport, the major gross drivers).\n\nIn other words, \"animal agriculture\" is a problem only when multiplied by lots of people enjoying comfortable lifestyles and a political system that keeps it this way.\n\n&gt; The \"good\" thing about animal agriculture being such a huge contributor to global warming is that a small reduction would have a big effect. I've seen studies that predict a 20% reduction would be enough to stay under the 2c rise goal.\n\nThis is really just begging the question. There are *lots* of modest lifestyle changes that would keep us below 2 degrees of warming. A small, economy-wide carbon tax (that includes agricultural emissions - both methane due to animals and lost absorptive capacity due to land clearing) would do it. A strong UN resolution would do it. A modest investment in renewable energy would do it (far less than what we spend on military budgets). \n\n*It's actually really fuckin' easy to stay below 2C.* Eat less meat, move in to an apartment, pay a little extra for your electricity, and don't have four children. The more interesting question is why none of this is happening, which invariably leads you back to I=PLOT. People are not willing to make lifestyle sacrifices (L) and our system of politics (O) prevents much from happening.\n\nI really must take issue with this \"largest single cause\" claptrap. There is no largest single cause - it's interrelated myriad human systemic variables.

It's easier to get lucky and beat a better team once than it is to beat them multiple times in a longer series. Which is why you play more than one game, so your playoffs aren't completely decided by fluke teams advancing, which is just bad for a competition where you want to see who is the best.\n\n&gt; 1) there are not cheap wins a win is a win, a team should be prepare for cheese strategies, whit the same argument i can say that a team can pull 2 cheese strategies and get 2 easy wins and the eliminations series should be bo5\n\nIt's far easier to pull off a single cheese win than multiple cheese wins. That's the point, cheese strategies have very high risk, but if you pull it off you win. But successfully pulling off a cheese strategy doesn't necessarily make you the better team. Ultimately you want a series longer than 1 game to even out the volatility.\n\n&gt; 2) the eliminations series comes after a long series of at least 15 games, you had ton of information to make adjustments to your draft vs the other team, more over 1 of those games in the group stages was against your team, you had already face them.\n\nThe group stage 15 games are completely different than playoff series. Multiple bo1's against different teams is nowhere near the same as a single bo3 or bo5 against one team. The fact that you play one game after another against the same team makes the dynamics of the matchups change. You don't get the same evolution just playing a single bo1.\n\n&gt; 3)why should yo decide where the line should be drawn, and why at bo3 (why not bo5?)\n\nThere's an inherent difference between a bo1 and a bo3 or more just like there's an inherent difference between 0, 1, and n. The difference is that more than one game is played in the series. In a greater than bo1 series, there's always a second game, there's always a previous game to look back on. You don't get that in a bo1, it's just one and done. I don't think the line should be drawn at bo3. I'm just saying bo1 is too little.

{"body": "I have some insider info on this subject in particular.  First, it is a Loss Leader, people never seem to leave places like Walgreens without additional purchases.  Second, it builds a good relationship with that Pharmacist, store, etc and customers will come back just for that so it is worth it for Walgreens.  Third, those 'free' and/or low-cost vaccinations are often only free or low-cost because they are run through some sort of subsidized program and are being paid for by SOMEONE or some entity--just not the customer.  The customer is not told this, it is taken care of behind the scenes. Fourth, you know how Walgreens says they give a free vaccination for every one you as the customer get?  For example, they give a free one to an under-privileged kid overseas?  Not entirely true.  The company very often does not keep track of what vaccinations they give, they just randomly guess at the end of a season, and they v e r y  often just simply don't follow through with giving away vaccinations overseas.  They aren't regulated so they can get away with it.  Fifth, Walgreens especially way overprices a lot of their Rx meds and services so they come out ahead anyways profit-wise.  In all Walgreens stores--the Pharmacy is the money maker.  Period.  The rest of the store is fluff and great way to make a little extra money.  But it is the prescriptions that really bring in the dough.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424374488", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm one of those \"wind-em-up-and-watch-em-go\" type personalities. It is fun to mess to with people. It is fun to confuse people. It's fun for me personally to watch things blow up and completely expect consequences. You'd be surprised at how little backlash comes back my way, though. \n\nI'm an artsy bibliophile. I draw, I paint, I read, I write. I can feel emotions but I don't kneel at their feet, if that makes sense. Granted, it is difficult to get into a mode where I can feel a lot. I don't particularly care for socializing, in terms of actually being present in conversations. Most people don't realize how pointless the shit coming out of their mouth is. The majority of the time I just want to scream, \"Who the fuck do you honestly think cares about that rad sick thing you did last week at that lame as party like this one?\" Admittedly, parties put me in a mood.\n\nI am obsessed with space science. I am not, and will not ever likely be ashamed of the person I am, but the vastness of space makes me feel so insignificant in the most perfect way. To go along with it, I have obsessions with aliens and ufos. \n\nPolitically, America's fucked and I don't see it getting particularly better. But I do believe basic human rights are things such as clothes on their backs, food, not having to choose between the latter and the former because of low wage, and shelter. Whether or not they live by the terms I do/\"deserve\" by my terms to live is another matter entirely. It just depends. \n\nLike anyone we're not cookie cutter. I have the privilege of being in a small circle known as the nasty three. No, we haven't broken any laws. But we're... nasty, obviously, in varying degrees. But I digress. My boyfriend is slightly socio, I'm mildly, and our mutual friend is highly sociopathic. Our friendship is beneficial in many ways. We're definitely never bored.\n\nTalents that belong to my bf: drawing some C R A Z Y shit out of nowhere, tripping acid while playing the evil within (or psycho break for some countries?), and pulling imaginary James Franco/Seth Rogen movies out of his ass. He's pretty funny.\n\nTalents that belong to our mutual friend: knives. You need a knife? he's your oprah. He tends to build replica weapons from popular video games, such as Assassin's Creed, Dragon Age, Skyrim, among others. And gdi, he's good at it. Throwing knives, cleaning pipes. He noticed when a single split hair was staticy and going up to a light. Extremely detail oriented. There's other things he's good at, but yeah, I'm not going to go any deeper than this for him.\n\nMy talents are pretty simple. I lie. I've been writing since I was ten, all pretty gory stories. I like detail, as well. Fashion. Pretty scenery. And then under that, I like ugly things. My head's a grotesquerie. But luckily I'm not the only one.\n\nEach of us have specific things in common: interests in blood, whether it's the study of it alone or splatter patterns. Our mutual friend has a blood kink, and my bf and I are still in our honeymoon/early period I think. But I imagine for the nasty three, blood runs a little deeper. We all happen to need/want a massive knife/throwing star collection. I used to have this knife that I would clean for hours at a time, getting it shined really well. I liked the way my reflection looked in the blade. I think that was the first time I ever remembered \"liking\" the way an object made me \"feel.\" I don't really know how to explain it; but there's just a connection between a girl and her first knife.\n\nHorror movies are a big thing among us. Granted we have different tastes, we've been the nasty three for so long, we don't even give a fuck. We'll sit through a movie we don't like just because of the people we're currently associating with. I mean, I will ignore my sister if she asks me to watch Titanic. But I'll chill out and watch some overrated Romero for these two specific people. And they'll watch \"gay ass Rob Zombie\" movies if it means I'll pull up cemetery porn on my phone. There's a system. It's useful.\n\nI imagine when and if it stops being useful, fun, or requires too much effort to reach a sense of belonging, dissolution will be necessary. But the thing is, everything we've learned about each other is pretty damning. So on my end, the thought of dissolution sounds as fun as it does strange.\n\nAnyway. Enjoy my word vomit.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424375088", "subreddit": "sociopath", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My name is Riddler, I am the highest ranked Shen player in all of North America and almost the entire world. I use almost the same runes as the original poster of this, but there are a few changes and I can explain why it is better to change.\n\nYou want to use flat health yellows instead of armor runes, because +72 health added with +36 health from defensive masteries = +108 bonus health, and then translates to 10.8 extra damage for every ki strike you use. 10.8 damage is a lot especially when you can time to harass your opponent with it every time its up, and in my opinion is a lot more valuable than armor runes.\n\nI use attack speed reds and quints and also I go 9 / 21 / 0, with a point in double edged sword and 4 points into fury for more attack speed. With all these points and runes in attack speed you have the exact minimum amount of attack speed to react and auto a minion under the turret twice before the turret can hit it 1 time, which allows you to get every single CS under the turret (an important thing for Shen).\n\nI NEVER use dorans shield ever for a starter. I consider it a sort of trap for Shen players because although it makes you appear strong in lane, you become more reactionary to harassment rather than the one dealing it out (since you can't make trades and recover with health potions like other builds). I always alternate between cloth armor 5 potions, boots 4 potions, or rejuv bead 5 potions 1 vision ward (then I place the vision ward in the isolated bushes to the left or the right of the mid lane so they don't get ganked very easily at around 1:52). Something worth noting is with the runes and masteries I explained above, with a cloth armor 5 potion start you can clear the toad or mini golems at 1:55 and then recall, buy another 2 potions to get back to 5, and a vision ward while you are at it. When you are vs AD champions top you 100% of the time always want to start cloth armor 5 potions, start one of these jungle camps, and then teleport back to the lane as it will help you in almost every single matchup for the entire laning phase.\n\nAlmost every single champion in the game I consider a winning matchup for Shen, including Lissandra. Shen is a unique champion in that there is no one skill path order that is used for every game, theres many variants for who you are vs.\n\nFor example, against Riven you would go Q E Q W Q R so you can capitalize when her shield is down, but against Lissandra, you want to go Q W E W W R, maxing W whenever you can. Lissandra top tries to bully Shen out of lane, but around when you get your 3rd point in feint and a spectres cowl, she can't even break feint anymore and will just stop trying to harass you altogether since she will go OOM over nothing. When you get to this point, just shadow dash on top of her and start auto attacking her to death and theres nothing she can do.\n\nI guess one of the most important things for you to do when playing Shen is to NEVER use Q to farm minions, always just last hit with auto attacks. When you Q a minion, you give up all your trading potential until its up again.... So you only want to Q a minion when the enemies minion wave is huge compared to yours and they are just waiting for you to get close to last hit a minion so they can harass you.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424416053", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I hope you changed your mind and I'm sorry my reply is so long, but your post really upset me. There's a lot of assumptions about supposedly homosexual chapters that Biblical scholars now almost unanimously agree aren't correct. I'm Presbyterian and so thankful I wasn't raised in a church that preaches hate. Presbys welcome all homosexuals into our churches, recognizing the hypocrisy of not doing so.\n\nMost Biblical scholars now agree Genesis, Chapter 19, Sodom and Gomorrah, for *many* years has had ONE unfortunate Hebrew word mistranslated: \"enoshe\" means **people** it does not mean men. When Lot insisted the two disguised angels (their sex isn't told in the Bible) to accept his hospitality, that night the *people* (enoshe) of Sodam demanded Lot to hand over his guests (also called enoshe, *people*). He refused. The Angels blind the citizens of Sodom, Lot and guests escape, and burn the town down for any number of bad ways (greedy, appointed judges who lied for them, refused help to wayfayers and strangers, etc). Apostle Jude says that Sodom and Gomorrah \"acted immorally and indulged in unnatural lust.\" The Greek translation gives much more specifics: It describes Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities as behaving as female whores. It then says, of the *cities* (not individuals) projected they'd sought out \"improper flesh,\" which are adulterous lovers. Again, no mention of male relations, only the women behaving badly!\n\nBesides, there wasn't a prohibition of homosexuality by most early Christian writers but had became a popular theme with Jewish and Christian scholars by the end of the Middle Ages. Along with acknowledging the mistranslation of 'enoshe,' today, the vast majority of Christians scholars also agree the story of Sodom and Gomorra was not about homosexuality.\n\n\n'Being in a family situation where they're is no end to the barrage of insults and daily reminders of who I am. Again.... Impossible not to hate yourself when you hear nothing but hateful things about yourself.' *Not only are you being subjected to psychological abuse, it's clear the hypocrites don't give a $@+× about your last two sentences from another quote you posted:\n\n'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, *Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" Last, \"Let anyone among you who is without sin cast the first stone.'*\n\nThe last quote of your's I wanted to respond to:\n\"I can't shift how much I loathe this part of me. I didn't ask for it. I don't want it. It doesn't feel right, it doesn't feel like who I am... It's brought nothing but pain into my life.\"\n\n*God does not make mistakes. Period. He made you who you are and no loving God would want Christians judging, persecuting, outcasting, etc., what he made perfect. I went to great lengths to give numerous examples for you to see, research, then look in your own Bible, that Sodom and Gomorrah aren't about homosexuality, as many still assume, thus believe. Jesus himself doesn't even mention homosexuality in the Bible. But He goes to great lengths to address numerous times throughout the Bible, love, compassion, being non judgemental, etc and I'm sorry, but your family seem to care little about the actual texts written, and more about being verbally and psychologically abuse to their own son. It's horribly toxic and I hope one day you realize GOD made you, there's nothing wrong with you, and there are Christian denominations out there who gladly accept E V E R Y O N E as they are. May you one day have the strength to seek out people who DON'T want to cause you pain.

The next category I can see as being easily explainable is people joking about Day 9 dying, shouldn't bee too hard for most people to understand why this isn't exactly looked up upon and why a lot of mods will TO for it. Those that fall under this are:\n\n* sir_cheddar\n* EnragedLobster\n* alexrayne\n\nNext up, slightly more controversial for some perhaps, but still pretty obvious are those who I'd argue are \"encouraging spam\", e.g. trying to get more people to just write \"Kappa\". Those in this category are:\n\n* Gratitude_\n* daywaker19\n* oriwarr\n\nNext up, miscellaneous spam, bit harder to define and again, this one is up to your own personal opinion a bit, but I can certainly see why any of these would get a TO. This collection includes things like the \"table flip\", copy paste spam, \"W R I T I N G L I K E T H I S\" and a couple of other things:\n\n* sackboy024\n* jesvk\n* lefr3k\n* qualiasc\n* rustyspork61\n* futuregandalf\n* glennocide\n* ebolapotato1\n\nMust admit, I don't really have an explanation for why people typing \"!raffle\" would be TO'd, maybe it was the bot, maybe it was a mod, granted, these are odd... Those affected:\n\n* topineapple\n* deadlysheepp\n* totaltech13\n* Belbiniho\n\nAmongst those that are left that I could offer an explanation of:\n\n* defiler0p - talking about drug usage\n* Darthkush - \"b.net\" is a link and the bot probably got it.\n* forthehuge - being insulting towards major \n\nPretty much done, the only oddities I can spot in there are:\n\n* AryaStark___ - didn't say anything, kinda odd\n* nwoinformant - can see how this looks a bit like spam, but I think it's undeserved\n* KappaIllouminati - same as above\n* xstylehardx - same as above (caps)\n* JollyWhiskerThe4th - not sure, slightly sarky comment, but nothing that deserved a TO.\n* kappa_the_king - again with the \"a bit spammy\" but not deserved\n* r_boyle - could have been in the first category, but it seems very low... \n\nNot sure if I missed any, but I hope this helps some people understand why the \"45 bogus timeouts\" is nonsense. It's also important to remember that there were over 27000 lines logged, not sure exactly how many of these were messages, but there were only 10 or so TOs that I could agree are a bit odd.

My attitude became *oh I guess it just wasn't ment to be* and *onto the next one*.  Then out of no where I had 2 mutual interests.  I concentrated on just having a good time getting to know them and seeing where things would go.  I ended up dropping one of them and getting into a great relationship with the other.  If I learned anything it was to keep pressing forward, not take things so personally (easier said than done I know), having fun, and see what happens.  I know I sure as heck don't have the perfect formula but it certainly helped me meet my current girlfriend.  We have been together 6 months and it has been wonderful.

For example, the only themes Jeff ever reviews is Surenix's, and he tends to praise tweaks by Intelliborn or A3Tweaks even when they are buggy and battery consuming. Part of the reasons I was personally upset was because Jeff was comparing Stratos to Auxo Legacy, which doesn't even exist yet. He assumes that A3 would make a better tweak, and continues to reference that it was inspired by Auxo Legacy, but Auxo Legacy never even came to fruition. Saying that it was inspired by Auxo 1 would have been fine, but he compared it to a tweak that doesn't exist, idealized by himself.\n\nMaybe we were a little too harsh. The review is very comprehensive, and I think that it does a great job showing Stratos. It's the write-up and the end of the video that upset me when he talks about how inferior Stratos is to Auxo, and how we could never achieve the A U X O ^(T M) level of quality when Auxo Legacy doesn't even exist. He compared it to a tweak that doesn't exist and assumed the nonexistent tweak would be better :/. He *did* mention that it's not a big deal, but it just rubbed me the wrong way. There's other examples, like when Jeff made a '5 most useless tweaks' post, one of which was made by /u/thekirbylover, leader of hashbang and dev of many great tweaks and developer tools. Had that post discouraged kirb when he was first developing, we wouldn't have hashbang, TypeStatus, and much more. \n\nSo yea, maybe we were a little excessive, but we aren't really mean to any other developers (if you see something like that on Twitter, it's probably sarcasm, like with /u/GreenyDev being Australian)\n\nEDIT: I wrote this on my phone, so I came back and fixed some grammar.\n\nAlso, FWIW, I had been at school and busy most of the day today, and had only read the write-up, which IMO is much worse and more circlejerky with the praising of A3. Watching the video, I see that /u/JeffBenjam did a very comprehensive review, with some of the annoying Auxo Legacy stuff sprinkled throughout a *little* too much A3 praising at the end, but all in all, it wasn't too bad. I deleted my mean tweets and retweets about iDB, and left a sort of thank you/apology tweet [here](https://twitter.com/JamesIscNeutron/status/568942494135623681) and [here](https://twitter.com/JamesIscNeutron/status/568942885095149568).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424481220", "subreddit": "jailbreak", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll keep it short. But I am oversimplifying. I'll capitilize terms you can look up if you get confused.\n\n1. There's really only 12 notes. A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are the NATURAL NOTES. A#, C#, D#, F# and G# are called ACCIDENTALS. Some people call this the MUSICAL ALPHABET.\n2. Most SCALES only use 7 of the 12 notes at a time. \n3. C Major is a common and simple scale to use because it doesn't use any accidentals. \n4. C Major is: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.\n5. The way to find any major scale is to line up all twelve notes and follow this pattern: Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half. Don't worry if that doesn't make sense for now. But there is a pattern for forming a major scale. \n5. If you took any given major scale's 7 notes and then choose every other note you would be doing what's called \"Stacking Thirds.\"\n6. If you followed that process for each of the notes you would HARMONIZE THE MAJOR SCALE. \n7. Therefore the chord in the key of C major are: \n - C Major: C E G\n - D minor: D F A\n - E minor: E G B\n - F Major: F A C\n - G Major: G B D\n - B diminished: B D F\n8. That pattern of Major; minor; minor; Major; Major; diminished would occur in any major scale. It's worth memorizing.\n9. The Minor scale has a different pattern and a different pattern for it's harmonization. \n10. There are also things called CHORD SUBSTITUTIONS that give you more options. Some of those substitutions are arrived at by stacking thirds again and then adding the next third. So C E G B would be C maj 7. And that's still in the key of C because it uses only notes that are already in the key of C.\n11. Depending on what genre of music you're jamming to you'll want to learn different scales, different progressions, and different chord substitutions. \n12. Also you'll want to look into different CHORD VOICINGS or CHORD INVERSIONS.\n\nThat wasn't as short as I originally intended. Hopefully it's a starting point. I have to run. Good luck!\n\ntldr: learn what notes fit in which scales. learn to form those notes to form the relevant chords to the type of music you're playing.

{"body": "It helps a bit to explain this bit: \"which is the V of G\"\n\nV is not a note, unlike A-G.  V is literally the number V, the fifth chord in the key, which in this case is G.  There are seven notes in a scale (for G major, they are G A B C D E and F#,) and each of these notes can be made into a simple triad chord by adding the third and fifth notes above it.  For instance, the G major chord is made up of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes in the G major scale.  The Fifth chord (the V) would be a chord made up of the 5th, 7th, and 9th notes of the scale, but because there are only 7 notes in a scale, the 9th is the same note as the second, only an octave higher.  Although, technically, you could put any of the notes in any octave you want and it would still be the same chord.\n\nThe Fifth chord is a very important chord in a key, and is called the Dominant chord.  It is the second most important chord, next to the \"tonic\" or chord based on the first note in the scale, in this case G.\n\nIn a major scale, the triad based on the second note in the scale, (so 2, 4, and 6, in this case A, C, E) will naturally be a minor chord.  What is interesting in this song, as I understand it, is that the D chord is given more importance than the tonic, along with heavy usage of the Am chord, which is not a chord generally given much importance in G major.  A is actually the fifth note from D, and in a normal D major scale would be the major fifth chord.  In this case, however, it's minor because this song is in G major.\n\nNow, this is where I'm not quite sure if I'm remembering my music theory or not, but I believe that this particular way of assigning import to certain chords actually makes the song Mixolydian, which is a \"mode.\"  Modes are ways of playing in a certain key but getting an entirely different feeling out of it.  To our ears, modal music often sounds foreign, as the notes played together, while still fitting together in ways that our pleasing to our ears, are played in combinations or orders we are not used to.  For an example of a song wholeheartedly in Mixolydian, look no further than the original Star Trek theme.  The very second note shows off the difference between the sound of a major scale and a mixolydian scale: the seventh note in the scale is flattened from what it would normally be in a major scale.

In my opinion it is very much not enough to simply plug an Asian face into any ol' role and call it a day because doing so doesn't do anything to improve awareness and appreciation of Asian Americans to the rest of the (non-Asian American) viewing public. Think about what Constance Wu says about her character's accent. One of the \"normal\" ways in which accents are used in Western media is as the premise for a slew of (usually racist) jokes. Because the character must have an accent (because the real Eddie's mom has one) the  progressive way to handle it is to present the accent in its full glory as part of the character's backstory, without apology, and without falling back to using it for that common and lazy purpose. The wrong way to neutralize and normalize the character, that I think a lot of people might be much more comfortable with, that /u/asiantemp calls out below, would be to get rid of the accent altogether, but then the character wouldn't be authentic to the reality that the show is based on. \n\nAs to your question about whether or not we've reached some point: I think that's a question that is based on a flawed premise, that we must reach some point A in order to get to point B when talking about making art. I think the reality is that, in terms of creating media for the masses, the points A B C D etc. are spread all around and its up to us as media creators to connect those dots in an aesthetic and meaningful way.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424537517", "subreddit": "asianamerican", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

What you tried to do was trade with him when he had his abilities off cooldown. This lead to when you are jumping in with your W Q you are getting hit by his Q or E or both. Same when he hit lvl 6 you are going in on him to trade while his R is ready for him to toggle on. You need to work more around his cooldowns, since he was at a lot of times low on mana. If he uses his Nevermove (W) and misses throw a Q at him, if he tries to get close to minions to farm throw a Q or just use your W to hurt him.\n\nLeBlanc is meant to be an assassin, but yet you never left your lane to roam or even tried to get a better angle for your W (R) E Q (R) combo or any of the others. You gave Swain an easier matchup by not attacking him from behind objects since he could always see when you went in on him. As an example the first time you are coming from the side of the enemy team and using your combo is at the 20 min mark after you have placed a ward by the raptor camp.\n\nRemember LeBlanc is an Assassin you have high burst and it is possible to 100 - 0 someone, but if you don't use it or you do not look for the easy picks then there are other champs that might be better for you like Ahri, that you also play.\n\nIf we look a bit at your itemisation, you build a Void Staff before you build either Deathcap or Zhonyas. At the 30 min mark you will see that the only MR item they have is on Swain which isn't a target you should try and burst down at this point of the game, when you have Ezreal, Zilean and Yi with no MR items at all. It would have been more effective for you to have put the money that you put into your Void Staff into getting Zhonyas for survivability and the high AP.\n\nAnd why on Earth would you at 17:43 by the in-game clock stand and try to CS 2 minions, when your Janna and Jinx are running towards the tower with the entire enemy team after them? You have Ezreal with 664 HP standing just a bit away from you, you could have removed Ezreal with a E Q R and then used your W to get away. I guess you got a bit of a tunnel vision at that point.\n\nMy last point is you are saying the throw began when bot lane came to mid, I would argue that the throw had already began before that. Your team had taken the enemies outer towers top and bot, but you had not pushed their mid tower ones if I recall correctly when you got the kills on Swain or when he recalled. To group mid and try to get the mid tower was needed to get some more pressure on the map. You should try and not look so much as you having a positive KDA by going 11/7/5 but watch the replay of the game again and try and look objectively on your positioning, when you are trading and try to answer the questions \"Why did I not push my lane minions to Swains tower?\" and \"When could I have roamed to other lanes?\".\n\nHope this is to some help and good luck with LeBlanc.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424604344", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**G E A R C H E C K**\n*what do I do with this ancient furnace?*\n\nHi guys Pilate here, you can can me pill. I've been only playing monk this season because it was the only class I had little experience with since Reaper of Souls released.  Anyone remember the good old days of dual one-handers, (woh kim laus and rare axes with life steal); running sweeping wind cyclone; using cyclone strike  to gather everything up for your wizard buddy to blow to smithereens with molten impact meteors; actually using combination strike passive because you ran two generators (fists of thunder-thunderclap and way of 100 fists-fists of fury).  Yeah, those were the good old times--if you could afford buying the gear on the AH.\n\nThen came the flying monk-AS monk builds in RoS which I completely missed out on.\n\nHere I am today, gungdo-fighting and having lots of fun dropping ancient pillars on mobs and dashing all of the place. Can I just say how fun it is wall jumping?\n \nSo I've been using the t6 lighting build with a torch and still currently am.  It's pretty fun though I'm curious about utter annihilation of T6 similar to what Quin69 demonstrates in this video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja4oBPXUiU4\n\nI'm wondering if this build is optimal for solo play, and if it is actually still viable.\n\nBasically tell me this: Is my GG ancient furnace something great?  Someone told me it's fairly worthless.  I want to feel like I have something special.  Don't we all want to feel this way?  What would *YOU* do if you had the following gear? What spec would you use if you wanted to:\n\n   * destroy t6 rifts in a solo setting\n   * destroy t6 rifts in a group setting\n   * push greater rifts solo\n\nand for extra points, please consider what legendary gems you'd like to use.  On that topic I'll say that I'm very fond of Molten Wildebeest Gizzard--wish i had that before my 1st monk ripped to exploding fatties.  Oh yeah, I play on NA  **h a r d c o r e** server.\n\n   [heres a link to my current ingame stats](http://imgur.com/K3a0fOr)\n\n   [The Furnace](http://imgur.com/LbLah7d)\n\n   [blackthorn fire amulet](http://imgur.com/1HtrMJv)\n\n   [cindercoat](http://imgur.com/s6l3IFt)\n\n   [leoric fire amulet](http://imgur.com/l0BpO0J)\n\nI list these amulets because so far I have found *z e r o* sunwuko shines even though I found literally a dozen set amulets the last 2 days.\n\n   [hexing pants](http://imgur.com/tILdRHr)\n\n   [depth diggers](http://imgur.com/BMBWUTK)\n\nI include these items because I'm led to think they're good.

How do I use it?  Is anyone else using a furnace to burn down t6 rifts?\n\np.s. sorry for the wall of text.

{"body": "I have had a year between ER visits, many visits in a month and the probably average for me is may once every three months.  It frankly just depends on how my head is doing at the time.\n\nI go to the same hospital all of the time, I have a solid file of well-documented history or ER visits, stays in the hospital for head trauma and intractable migraines, my Neurologist has privileges there. . . etc.   I have found that while it helps me to have this well-documented file with the hospital, and I usually am treated well, I am not always treated well.  In my opinion, how I am treated and what I am given for my migraine depends completely on the doctor that sees me.  I have had docs say the most ridiculous things about migraines, refuse to believe that I really am intolerant/allergic to the wide range of meds on my list and one actually said, 'I don't believe in migraines.'  What??  I have also blessedly run into several docs that understand I know by this point what works, ask me for my go-to cocktail, and then give it to me until I am well enough to leave.\n\nI go the ER when I need to.  I cross my fingers each time that the experience will be a positive one.  Most of them are.  Most of the time I get the appropriate treatment and docs/nurses listen to me about what works for me and what doesn't.   I am a bit scarred though by the few times that I have been treated poorly and going to the ER is always my last resort.\n\nMy last trip to the ER was in December and the treatment I rec'd was so textbook astoundingly good that I made every phone call I could after to compliment the people who treated me.  I was respected for understanding my disease so well.  Everyone who treated me had a solid understanding of what I was going through at the time and did little things like, Ninja Nurse Derek put in my IV in the complete dark somehow as I could not stand the lights on.    My file was rev'd as it should be, I was given the meds that worked super quickly and I was listened to.  It gave me great hope that perhaps the next time I have to go to the ER I will have a good experience.\n\nAnd all of the phone calls I made?  I have now been asked to give a speech in front of all of the hospital bigwigs about my experience.  My phone calls eventually led me to the Patient Advocacy Coordinator who says the hospital's goal is for every patient to walk out feeling as if they have been cared for so well.  I give my speech next week.  The people who helped me that day will receive commendations.  I will be interviewed afterwards on video and my experience will be used as a teaching tool.  My hope?  I sincerely hope that me talking about my migraine issue, the shite experiences I have had before versus the amazing experience I had most recently will help people to understand the condition we deal with a bit better.  \n\nAs for rebounds, ER visits don't result in rebounds, but you might be getting medications that have resulted in rebounds.  I would keep a detailed journal of your headaches every day, any meds you take, and the result of any meds to see if you are getting rebounds.\n\nAs you try to detox, you might try to get a little creative.  If you can take Benadryl for example, when a bad headache hits and you feel like you need a rescue med but are trying to avoid the usual ones--try to take some Benadryl and go to sleep.  Sleep is an incredible cure for most people's migraines.  Often 'sleeping' off your headache will help you to stay away from bigger meds and/or an ER visit.  Do you have a doctor and/or Neurologist that might be good at helping you think outside of the box about this?  My Neurologist is considered one of the best in the state and is known to be one of the best in his field, but he s u c k s at helping me creatively.  I have weird medicine issues for example and he has no ideas on how to help me and sees no problem with sending me out of his office after a visit without any suggestions or ideas no matter how severely desperate for relief I am.  I have a Family Doctor though that is unbelievable at trying to help me and works hard to work around the issues I have.  She has been a lifesaver!\n\nI say go to the ER when you need to, are really having symptoms that require intervention and that you can't deal with on your own, and try not to worry about it if they happen to start recognizing you.  You have a condition that means you will need urgent help sometimes.  It's not your fault and fuck 'em if you happen to get a bad apple who doesn't understand once or twice.  Hopefully, you will have positive experiences each and every time you unfortunately have to seek help from the ER.\n\n(Sorry for the wall of text).

From what I remember, they said it would come out \"soon\" and \"before the end of the year.\" We're a week away from March and the release still hasn't come out yet, and the hype is unreal.

{"body": "Here are some notable quotes we should also read guys: \n\n(tl;dr- Sony CEO: I’m confident that we could have a meeting later on this year and you might not be quite so angry)\n\n&gt;Sony CEO: Well, more females are playing games now than ever before. I think the GamerGate thing is absolutely horrible. I agree, * I read what you wrote about it, again your language was intemperate * – as befits your views on an issue…\n\nGC: Oh c’mon! Never mind games not working, that stuff was beyond the pale.\n(lol)\n\nSony CEO: Yeah, and I share your opinion on much of it.\n\n * (here comes the diversity quotas!)\nGC: Did you consider any counter to it, to encourage more female gamers and/or developers? I’m not suggesting it was incumbent for you to do so, but I’m curious if GamerGate led to any positive new initiates?\n\n&gt;* Sony CEO: I don’t think you can or should discriminate one way or the other. Quotas in boardrooms, quotas in sporting teams, I personally don’t believe that these are the right way to achieve a world where discrimination is not prevalent. I think if you talk about this organisation, I think all that I should do is to set an example at the top. And indicate that any behaviour that is remotely inappropriate in this area will not be tolerated. *\n\nGC: The one thing that does make me laugh about GamerGate is their assumption that any publisher would bother to bribe a journalist. Nobody listens to reviews, they never have and never will. Which makes me curious as to how does Sony view the specialist media nowadays, especially now with the rise of YouTube celebrities?\n(double lols)\n\nSony CEO: I wouldn’t be… I was going to say the word wasting [laughs]. I wouldn’t be spending my time here…\n\nGC: You’re only here in the hope of more free Dundee Cake. [We bribed him with some free cake last time we met – GC].\n\nSo very mature, I wonder what makes him anti GG? \n\nSome of the funniest bits: \n\n&gt;Sony CEO: I know, I know. And I’ve read quite a lot of the stuff that you’ve written on this sort of topic. It’s well argued, it’s cogent… if a bit rabid occasionally.\nGC: I rant because I care.\nSony CEO: [laughs] I see where you’re coming from\n\n&gt;GC: Well, I’m counting quality and quantity as one, as we’ve touched on that before. But do you accept 2014 was a disappointing year? Because from a hardware sales perspective it was obviously a very good year for Sony. But in every other respect… to me it’s no wonder that smartphone gaming continues to expand given how shambolically the entire industry has handled this latest generational leap.\nSony CEO: You got it all off your chest now? [laughs] \n\nIt sounds like this interviewer is just a borderline retard, lol.\n\n&gt;JR: [laughs] Last time we met… I enjoyed the reaction of your readership to my assertion that they were more intelligent than you were. [laughs]\nGC: I’m sure they were very generous with their comments.\nJR: [laughs] \n\nYou can almost feel the awkward. \n\n&gt;GC: That’s true, and certainly in terms of the hardware itself and the marketing you’ve done very well. But I think ultimately people were just so keen to embrace the new generation that they were happy to jump aboard immediately, many knowing that the first year probably won’t be that great. But I don’t think anyone expected it to be as bad as it was.\nJR: …\n\n&gt;GC: And just to your earlier point I’m not sure that any of my three concerns really are subjective. The question of quality perhaps, although I’m sure a study of Metacritic will show a consensus that it was not a classic year. The quantity of games was certainly at an all-time low, I remember quoting a retailer survey to that effect in my end of year feature. And then GamerGate was incontrovertibly awful, and so was the situation with broken games.\nJR: Yeah, let’s move on from the subjective, because you have a view on that and the vast majority of 18 and a half million people appear to have a different view on that.\n\n&gt;JR: Even if your view is expressed with characteristic zeal we’re moving on to an area where we’ll find a bit more common ground. [laughs]\n_______________________________________________________________\nAwesome quotes: \n\n&gt;In any form of entertainment, in any business… whether it’s a washing machine, whether it’s a book, whether it’s television, whether it’s a video game you shouldn’t put something out until it’s ready.\n\n&gt;This is not some sort of nanny state\n\n&gt;Because it’s not uncommon to hear stories of some indie downloadable title being delayed by a few months because it failed Sony QA, and it’s usually minor things like how their save screen works or something. And you think, ‘Well, that’s a shame but at least it shows that Sony’s QA is fairly rigorous’. But if you can be so pedantic about that sort of thing surely ‘Does it work?’ is the first thing you check for!\nJR: It is very hard for us to QA the online expedience of a third party game…\n\nlol...\n\n&gt;GC: What about Assassin’s Creed Unity then? That’s primarily single-player and its problems were blindingly obvious the second you started playing.\nJR: When a third party multiplayer game runs on the servers of that third party publishers, you’ll understand it’s virtually impossible for us to QA that online experience.\n\ntoplols\n\n&gt;GC: Are there any financial penalties you can levy at them? Because it’s your name on the box too you know.\nJR: …\n\n&gt;GC: From seeing it at a preview it was obvious to me a couple of months out that Unity wasn’t going to be properly finished for its release date, so it should have been obvious to you as well.\nJR: You’re straying into the realm of conversations between publisher and platform holder that should remain private.\n\nI like how he makes fun of GG saying journos took bribes from publishers, and now accuses sony of the same thing. \n\nROFL! \n\n&gt;GC: And presumably that conversation was you saying ‘Does it work?’ and them answering with [starts winking and miming taking a bribe].\nJR: No! No, no, no!\n\nWhat a hack lol. He should be fired immediately. \n\n&gt;GC: Well, what happened then? If everyone reviewing the game noticed these horrendous bugs after just five minutes of playtime how did you miss it? You’re happy to put your foot down with little indie developers but because it was a big publisher apparently those rules are ignored.\nJR: [deep breath] Ah, yeah. Well, it wasn’t just offline, there were…\n\nHe doesn't even let the dude talk. lmao wow. \n\n...GC: The co-op was a minor part of that game, and was not one of the issues most people were upset about. 10 minutes into Unity and I was controlling a flying apple instead of the main character. There was no way anyone involved in that game didn’t know the state it was in when it shipped. All they cared about was hitting their deadline. And by association you were okay with that, you were part of the conversation that said, ‘Ah, who cares? You can fix it later…’\nJR: No! I… I think… let’s move on.\n\n&gt;JR: I’m saying the format holder overlay… if we were to test absolutely everything, it could take months.\nGC: Ask me next time and I’ll lend you my review notes!\nJR: [laughs] \n\nThis guy is such a flaming retard lol. \n\n&gt;PR guy: Have you played Driveclub recently?\nGC: I don’t really like serious racing games, so I don’t personally have much of an opinion about the game itself.\n\nL   M   A   O O O O O O  OO O O O O OO  O O  O O O (to the ends of the galaxy)\n\n&gt;GC: I understand that you did a lot better than some in addressing the situation, but that was still three months. And… is there still going to be the free PlayStation Plus version?\nJR: That’s still being looked at.\nGC: You can’t guarantee that it will ever happen?\nJR: I can’t say anything at this stage.\n\nlols\n\n&gt;GC: OK, well let’s move onto some of the other points. There’s no point arguing about the quality of the games last year as we’ve discussed that before, although clearly  it was awful.\nJR: [sustained laughter] \n\nthis seems like the most awkward interview in the world. \n\n&gt;GC: But the question of quantity also concerns me. We discussed the summer games drought, which was particularly bad last year, at Gamescom and you admitted it was an issue. Have you done anything since then to avoid similar problems this year?\nJR: At the end of the day, David, the decision when to release any game is down to the publisher in question.\nGC: I’ll take that as a no.\nJR: No, c’mon. A platformer holder has absolutely no… I’ll point out that we released The Last Of Us in early August. What else do you want us to do?\n\nThis guy is such an asshole lol, how does he even have a job. \n\n&gt;GC: You implied you were going to do something at Gamescom. Why doesn’t it worry you that the games industry, from a mainstream consumer’s point of view, only exists for four or five months of the year? I can get the summer games drought to a degree – it’s hot outside and a lot of people are on holiday – but it’s February now, it’s freezing cold out and dark at 4pm, but apart from Evolve we haven’t had a major retail release for coming on three months.\n\nComplaining about not enough peasant releases, LMAO!!!!!! First he wants less buggy games, then he wants MORE frequent releases, sounds like he can't make up his mind. \n\nJR: Why don’t you just play all the games that were released in November?\nGC: I thought we’d agreed not to talk about the poor quality of last year’s releases?\nJR: [laughs] \n\nawkwarddddd. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424709034", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Pantheon mid is an interesting pick.  He has some really powerful strengths and some limiting weaknesses.  Not a well rounded pick at all.  \n\nI have played him more top lane than mid.  He has better matchups and his ult helps negate TP, so you can take ignite and really crush lane hard.  At mid lane your ult is a better roaming tool however.  I also think his power curve fits top lane better.  By going mid you remove a lot of late game teamfight power from your team if they were to instead take a control mage.  \n\nHe's easy to play and crushes lanes harder than almost anyone.  But to pay for that his playmaking potential is limited.  He has a bazillion base damage with an obscene AD ratio on his basic ability rotation.  Think about it, he puts out roughly as much damage as a Zed / Talon on about an 8 second cooldown.  \n\nOne thing that I really like about Pantheon is how clear his gameplan is.  You start flask and proceed to roflstomp whichever poor soul is sent to lane against you.  He has good matchups against melee's and ranged opponents alike.  You rush some core damage items and start using your ult to spread your individual power across the map.  These two attributes (1. Strong laning 2. Good roaming) are very powerful in solo queue.  I think these strengths are especially powerful in lower ELO.  One good early gank can often affect morale and get people raging/flaming.  The win conditions for the game are entirely in your control.  You rely very little on teammates hanging on long enough for you to power up.  Lanes that are losing or doing poorly are often pushed up and make great gank opportunities.  Being able to directly and consistently help your teammates like this really makes an impact in solo queue.\n\nBut as many have said, if you don't snowball the game by 30 minutes things go downhill.  In my experience his falloff is more a result of his gameplay, than a numbers thing.  His Q W E Q combo simply leaves him too vulnerable to work in a 5v5 environment.  Too much CC and ambient AOE damage to work effectively.  \n\nI do think there are options available to a late game Pantheon though.  If you transition from a Brutalizer / BC + LW core into a bruisery tanky build you can become a very potent initiator.  Your ult lets you bypass straight to the backline.  With a little help from a dive buddy you can easily pop squishy carries.  If you commit to a carry level damage build I actually recommend trying to be more of a peeler.  With Black Cleaver Panthon makes tanks very vulnerable to an ADC.  Peeling a diving bruiser is much less risky than diving deep.  Then you can quickly move into killing their carries with your ult as a cleanup tool.

{"body": "Haha, I was linking Johnny Tightlips to Facebook, so I must have accidentally pasted that link instead of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY6LO0XGy6A) so sorry about that.\n\nEverything you said is correct. The notes and chords are the same. But the relationship between them is what changes, and that's what music is. (You can play a B major chord all you want and it will sound like a B major, but if you play it after an F#7 chord, it will sound totally different than if you play it after a C# chord.) Also the qualities (major/minor) of the chord change which also make it interesting. \n\nSo the i - VI - VII is the minor qualities, but in major you get I - vi - vii* (in your example, it would be G major, E minor, F# diminished.) So really, what makes music interesting isn't the notes, but the relationship between the notes, and by switching keys you change the relationship making things more interesting. \n\nP.S. There are different types of minor keys, natural, harmonic and melodic. The natural minor is the \"starting\" point for minor scales: A B C D E F G. This scale has the lowered 3rd 6th and 7th. The harmonic minor is slightly different: A B C D E F G#. Compared to the natural minor, the harmonic minor has a raised 7th which makes the V chord major. (**Natural minor** i-v chords would be ACE - EGB, whereas **Harmonic minor** i-V chords would be A C E - EG#B) Basically, this creates a leading tone which is a stronger cadence. (A cadence is the end of the phrase, with the most recognizable being V7 - I)\n\nThe melodic minor is kinda crazy, it is different going up the scale than coming down. A B C D E F# G# going up, A B C D E F G coming down. So you would play it A B C D E F# G# A G F E D C B A. This can create some really crazy sounds so feel free to experiment with it. \n\nLet me know if anything I said was unclear, I'd be happy to try to clarify. \n\nA final thought: My music theory teacher told us that first we have to learn the rules, then we can break them to get the exact sound we want. \n\nE: Cleared up chords\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424711144", "subreddit": "dazesoft", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Your fingering and the cross over/under should be almost automatic separately.\n\nThen, when putting them together, yeah, go super slowly and get used to how the fingers feel pairing off.\n\nStart by just doing partial scales.  So in C for example, play C D E D C several times in a row.  Now play C D E F E D C the same way.  Get comfortable crossing under with your right while keeping your left smooth.\n\nBasically keep doing the same thing up to a 5th, to a 6th, a 7th, and then finally the full octave.  If you're aiming for two octave scales, practice playing a single octave, but crossing your thumb for the C in the right hand.  Continue the same idea of playing up to the 9th, 10th, etc.  Once you've gotten past the octave break though, you should be pretty smooth up to a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, nth octave.\n\nIf you find that you've having trouble coming down, do the exact same thing backward.  C B A B C.  C B A G A B C.  Early on your brain basically has to quickly switch focus to whichever hand is going to be crossing next until it all becomes very comfortable and auto-pilot like.

Well there are some possible ideas I guess:\n\n~~7 crop circles (well 8, but one is hidden from us), and other inputs in game that aren't 8 inputs long (I think there was a 6 input long one).~~\nThe discrepancy between the tome order and the number of inputs is a valid objection though, it's a big hole in a lot of theories that we keep desperately trying to fill.\n\nAnother explanation could be that, because the sequence corresponds to the circles of 5ths, which is a concept in music theory, where 1 and 8 are actually the same note. Its a 7 step pattern, 8 is the same as the starting point. the other heart cube puzzle is a repeating pattern with no discernible starting point. (some of Phils art http://th08.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2011/093/3/9/39bd06236522bd94b36d5f81dbfb3560-d3d5876.png)\n\n    C G D A E B F# C\n    1 5 2 6 3 7 4  8\n    or more accurately\n    1 5 2 6 3 7 4  1 5 2 etc...\n\nBut even then it's kind of a stretch, the circle of fifths actually goes 12 steps before returning to 1 (or 13). It only returns to 1 if you stay within an 8 note scale. It's complicated and probably not even relevant to what the puzzle. but it's an idea. Rich used lots of music theory. \n\n&amp; It doesn't account for there being 8 tome pages either, cause to read the tome you do 8 AND 1. So I see what you're saying. How it becomes more convoluted the more you try to explain it.\n\n2. 4 and 3 can be written more than one way, but because every number is below 5, you can use the simpler forms, if that is what you mean.\n\nhis diagram is actually messed up as far as I know, with the arrows.\n\nIf you write 4011322 yourself and apply Metatron/Monolith/2001 rotation logic to it, you should get the input.

{"body": "Since people already mentioned the differences between the G major and A major scales, I would love to point out something you can do with both of them!\n\nForget note names, and let's name the notes in the scale like this:\n\nI ii iii IV V vi viii° I. \n\nOkay? I ignore the fact I chose to capitalize some letters and add in a degree sign, you'll know why later on. Just note that it counts from 1 to 7, then it goes back to 1, because after all the beginning and end notes are always the same.\n\nNow the cool thing is, that naming system works simultaneously for every major scale! C major, Db major, A major, and even G major (and all the others)!\n\nSince this system tells you the note *relationships*, and not the note names, you can use it to do a fancy thing called transposing!\n\nYou know when people say, \"Key of this, or key of that\"? This is how you can turn a Key of G into a Key of A!\n\nSince /u/choppadoo gave us the note names for both keys already, let's go ahead and apply that to our new system!\n\nG: G A B C D E F# (G)\n\nA: A B C# D E F# G# (A)\n\nN: I ii iii IV V vi viii° (I)\n\nLet's take the first bit to Mary had a little lamb. In G that's B, A, G, A, B, B, B. In our new system we can write it as iii, ii, I, ii, iii, iii, iii. That means all we have to do is pick the same notes from A, and we can play the same song in the key of A. Try playing: C#, B, A, B, C#, C#, C#.\n\nCool, isn't it!\n\nThis is because music is based off of patterns (as you start to see already, don't you?)! Knowing the numeral system and getting familiar with it will help you out a lot with learning chords and harmonies.\n\nNow you might ask yourself, why not write all in one key, then you'll only have to ever learn 7 notes! Keep in mind, some instruments are not that lucky. If you ever want to play with a trumpet player, their instrument is built to play in Bb. While they can play other keys, its easiest for them to play in Bb and you'll hear a lot of trumpet music written in that key! Also every vocalist has a natural range and you will be the one that will have to match their range with an appropriate key since they can't go out of their range to match you, so it's nice to learn the patterns and practice all 12 keys eventually.\n\nIf you would like me to help you out with Music Theory (that is, why some notes work, and some don't, and how to figure out chords, chord relationships, chord progressions, song writing, etc.) let me know! I love teaching music theory and I am practicing to be a teacher, so I can use the practice.

{"body": "Your structure for what is called the Pure Minor Scale (also could be th aeolian mode of a tone) is correct, w h w w h w w, or you could view it as the major scale shifted a couple of spaces to the left. \n\nG-minor is indeed G (w) A (h) Bb (w) C (w) D (h) Eb (w) F (w) G. It is derived from the Bb major scale. The G Pure minor scale has a regular F, not # or b. \n\nNow, the Harmonic minor scale is a modification of the pure minor scale, raising the 7th degree a half step, to make it w-h-w-w-h-w&amp;h-h, so could make the V7 chord to resolve chord progressions and such. This was the new minor scale for classicals. We now name it harmonic minor. \n\nThen, classicals thought that the augmented interval was crazy, so they also raised the 6th degree half a step, to now make it w-h-w-w-w-w-h. This was the new classic minor scale, today known as the melodic minor. \n\nHow they worked with these 3 scales was as if they were one.

Youd have to meet every furry in existence if you want to come to a conclusion since we all live different lives. Of course we are weirdos, but whats wrong with that? Think of it like the fgc. We have our friends that we hang out with everyday in our lives, and then we have fgc friends that can eventually turn into chilling with you alot outside of gaming events. Same goes with furries (although I dont have other furries to hang out with I R L because who lives in Delaware Kappa) 2. The reason games stay dead is because YOU dont play them. Its not your fault or anything, you may just not like the game (which is why i dont play marvel and streetfighter). To bash someone for playing a \"dead\" game isnt the way to go about it either. Play what you will, dead or alive (AYY LMFAO puns). P.S: Being rude or absolutely insulting to somebody you dont know isnt good to follow.

{"body": "Pre-post edit: Holy crap, I never thought I'd do one of these. That was a lot of work. Anywayyyy...\n\nOkay. Take this with a grain of salt. It's been a few years. Plus I'm on mobile. Maybe this can help someone else firm up the math. Here it goes...\n\nAssumptions:\n- Salt is dissolved into the water\n- The bottom is resting on a table or another flat surface and will not be the side \nwhere the glass breaks\n- Water Density = 1000 kg/m^3\n- Salt Density = 2170 kg/m^3\n\n1) Find density and height of total solution (salt + water)\nVolume of water = 2.4m x 1.6m x 0.4m = 0.96m^3\nWeight of Water = 0.96 x 1000 = 960kg\nVolume of salt = 400/2170 = 0.184m^3\nAdded height of salt = 0.184/(2.4 x 1.6) = 0.048m ~ 0.05m\nTotal height of salt + water = 0.255m\nTotal weight of salt + water = 960 + 400 = 1360kg\nTotal volume of salter + water = 0.255 x 1.6 x 2.4 = 0.968m^3\nDensity of salt + water = 1360/0.969 = 1189kg/m^3\n\n2) From fluid statics, we can find the pressure on the wall by using P = rho x g x h (Pressure = density x gravity x height) Integrating this along an infinitesimally small horizontal strip, we get the max FORCE on the smallest strip at the bottom of the tank, where I believe there will be the greatest chance of breaking. This equation is F=0.5 x rho x g x L x H^2.\n\nNow we want to know force per linear meter along the bottom of the tank. From above we can rearrange and plug in F/L = 0.5 x 1189 x 9.81x 0.255^2 = 874N/m. We can then integrate that to the middle of the line at the bottom of the tank to get 874 x1.2=1049N at the midpoint of the imaginary line at the bottom of the glass.\n\n3) Now let's find the properties of the cross-section of the most fragile pane of glass (the longer, 2.4m side). I = (w x t^3)/12 for the second moment of area for a rectangle. \"c\" (which we will need later) is simply half the thickness of this glass, t/2\n\n3.5) Now we can use a mechanics of materials formula to find the thickness of the glass. Sigma = M x c/I determines the max stress that can occur on the glass before it breaks. We know that the moment is the force at the center of the imaginary line (1049N) times the distance from the edge (1.2m). This gives us 1259N-m. Sigma (max shear stress) can vary based on the fiberglass that you buy, but I used 20.7MPa. \n\nPlugging away we get 20,700,000 = 1259 x (t/2) x (12/2.4 x t^3). Now we can rearrange and solve for t as 0.012m or 1.2cm thick.\n\n4) Depending on the severity of the damage if this thing leaks/breaks, assume a safety factor of at least 1.5 up to 2.0. If you go with 1.5 you're looking at 1.2cm x 1.5 = 1.8cm thick.\n\nTakeaways: 1.8cm assuming my math is right and that the midline of the bottom edge of the longest piece is most likely to fail. The epoxy/glue holding the tank together may make it stronger close to that area and may need more in depth analysis as to a point further up the tank (although still in the center) of that 2.4m long glass. This doesn't take into account imperfections or variations in the fiberglass. Lastly, make sure to check the max shear stress of the material because that could impact this calc significantly.

His eyes bulged with excitement as he twiddled his fingers together.\n\n\"And you're going to stop bothering me with this nonsense once I figure it out, right?\" Bruce asked.\n\n\"Mhm\"\n\nBruce leaned forward, uncrossing his arms he picked up the paper with both hands and inspected it carefully.\n\n*BATMAN HAVE ALL*\n*BRUCE HAVE ONE*\n*WHAT YOU HAVE BUT NOT HAVE?*\n\nBruce thought for a moment and looked up again at Edward who was still twiddling with his fingers. \n\n\"What are you trying to play at, Riddler? This crap doesn't mean anything. What do I have but not have? Whatever happened to your writing skills? This doesn't even make sense!\". The frustration in his voice was becoming evident.\n\n\"Oho, but it does\". Edward's grin was almost unbearable for Bruce to look at. \n*Smug little fella are'nt you?*. \"And as we agreed, once you...I mean, *if* you guess right within the hour, then I'll stop bothering you and I'll leave Gotham forever. Here, I even have my suitcase packed\". Edward leaned down and picked up a small green travel bag from the floor and placed it on the table in front of himself.\n\n\"Nice bag\" Bruce said, stifling a laugh.\n\nEdward's smile disappeared at once. \n\n\"Well I don't expect you to solve the riddle so these are my, how to say, simple overnight goodies\". He flicked the locks off and opened the bag. Reaching in, he pulled out his infamous green question mark hat and green cane, placing them beside the bag. He closed the locks, put the bag next to him again, and looked back at Bruce.\n\n\"This is all I need, you see? Now. back to my riddle. Have you solved it yet?\" he inquired.\n\nBruce was getting tired of this little bother, so he pulled out a pen from his coat pocket and started jotting down some scribble on the paper. He examined the wording, the meanings, the implications, possible anagrams, everything. After 50 minutes had passed, Edward piped up.\n\n\"Tick tock Mr Wayne, you have 10 minutes left.\" Riddler stood up to stretch and started pacing around the room stroking his chin at the clock.\n\nBruce looked over it all again. *It doesn't make any sense at all...what does Batman have that Bruce doesn't? I'm the same person...we are the same...we...*\n\nBruce suddenly sat upright in his chair. He quickly ran over the letters again. *BATMAN has all, but Bruce only has one*.\n\n\"Letters\" he thought to himself. B A T M A N... he stared at the three letters that stuck out the most.\n\n*B T M*. *Bruce, Thomas, Martha*. B R U C E only has one. *One*. *B*...*Bruce*.\n\nAs he read the last sentence in the riddle, he felt his heart tighten. His eyes slowly filled with water as he stared at what was written in front of him.\n\n*What you have but not have?*\n\n\"Family\" he said, tears rolling down his cheeks. \"Batman has the three family members in his name but Bruce only has himself. I... I have....\" his words were falling from his mouth as though talking to a psychiatrist \"The answer is family\".\n\nBruce looked up with tears welled up in his eyes. The Riddler was nowhere to be seen. In his daze of confusion, Bruce hadn't noticed that Edward had already left the room leaving nothing behind but his bag. \n\nBruce stood up and pulled the table aside in one strong shove.\n\n\"God damn you Edward!\" he yelled, his voice echoing down the empty hallway outside. He kicked the green bag lying on the floor that went flying against the wall and landed upright, but fell down and clicked open on the ground. Bruce noticed something in the bag. A piece of paper. He knelt down and pulled it from the bag. A green envelope. He opened it up and pulled out a folded piece of paper. He sat down on the chair, held it out and read.\n\n*Bruce. Goodbye my dear friend. Accept my apologies for the riddle, but I wanted my final puzzle to be for you and you only. You lost your parents at an early age, and in a manner of speaking, as did I. You, Bruce, may have lost something so cherished but please remember dear friend, Batman has not. Batman has family. Gotham is your family now. Take care of it like you would your beloved parents, and never forget who you are. Sincerely, E.N.*\n\nThe letter dropped from his hands as he stared at the open doorway. \n\n*Perhaps Riddler is right.

{"body": "You kinda need to understand his context in place in hip hop to see why he's so well-regarded in the scene.\n\nKanye's first album, The College Dropout (along with his second album Late Registration), was incredibly bold and socially conscious. Without it, most rap music would still be club bangers by the likes of 50 Cent and G Unit (not that there's anything wrong with that).\n\nIn 2008, Kanye released his fourth album, 808s and Heartbreak. There is only one rap song on the album (Heartless), the rest of the album is Kanye singing through very heavy filters like autotune and vocoders. The lyrics dealt with self loathing, depression, heartbreak, the death of family members, and the price of fame when it comes to being able to have meaningful relationships with people. Rappers had used auto tune before, but Kanye made it super popular, and without 808s, artists like Drake wouldn't exist, and, again, hip hop probably wouldn't have as many artists that are introspective and heavily emotional.\n\nHis fifth album in 2010, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, pulls from all his previous work. It's a beautiful album, there are videos of orchestras performing some of the songs off of it. It's a really epic album in the truest sense, in that it is basically an exploration of the goods and bads of celebrity, fame, ego, self love, and the muse in art. He also made a 30 minute companion short film titled Runaway. There's barely any dialog, almost all of the story is conveyed through the music and lyrics. Without this album, I doubt there would be as much artistic symbolism in allusions in hip hop.\n\nHis last album from 2013, Yeezus, is very aggressive. Kanye pulled inspiration from industrial groups like Nine Inch Nails and Skinny Puppy, ambient music, noise pieces, glitch music like Venetian Snares and Aphex Twin (Kanye had used an Aphex Twin sample on MBDTF too), and, arguably, industrial hip hop artists like B L A C K I E, Saul Williams, and Death Grips (this is highly debated among Ye fans. Kanye's crew had said Ye hadn't heard of Death Grips until after he finished Yeezus, and B L A C K I E claims Kanye has heard his music before). There hasn't been much impact on hip hop as of yet, but I am sure the influence will be felt soon.\n\nKanye is also super dedicated too his craft. The College Dropout took 5 years to make, the song Through The Wire was recorded while Kanye's mouth was wired shut after a car accident that almost killed him. He has also said that dedication to his art and his fans was one of the things that kept him from committing suicide before, during, and after the production of MBDTF (the contemplation of suicide is mentioned in the full version of POWER). Hell, J Dilla, who is pretty much agreed to be one of if not the greatest hip hop producer of all time, said Kanye was his favorite producer.\n\nI suggest you look at his albums The College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation, as they are the easiest to get into, and also showcase Kanye's production style of sped up soul and jazz samples the best. : )", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424925788", "subreddit": "TaylorSwift", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was in the process of writing an entire wall of text on how to explain this. But if I were to write the whole wall of text and still want to be concise I'd not get my point across. So I'll write the full thing later and post it later and for now I'll give a short TL DR run through of the important points.\n\nFirst thing you need to know is how to play safe. If you can't play safe you can't play aggressive. What I mean by this is you can play agro like hell 24/7, but when you do this you're just going to get killed by the enemy jungler and die over and over again. So ward up and you can do this, don't ward and you can't do this. Then you need to wait to spot the enemy jgler and any SS on the map from other lanes.\n\nYou trade/poke whenever your opponent goes for last hits or uses abilities to last hit. Or when your minion wave is bigger than theirs.\n\nIt's good to towerdive when you can get a kill if you get full gold from it and you aren't worth a shut down and if there's a big minion wave under the enemy tower that your opponent wants to farm and you can kill the guy 100% guaranteed.\n\nIf any of those things, even one, isn't the case then you shouldn't towerdive. Or you should get your jungler involved to make sure you don't trade kills. \n\nDifferences in playstyles top/mid/bot:\n\nMid = short lane, low chase potential, safer lane because it's short so ganks are less effective (you're faster back to your tower) but there's more routes to gank you from.\n\nBot/Top = longer lanes so the ganks that come are usually kills if you didn't see them coming. But it's easier to see them coming because there's fewer ways into the lane. \n\nThe longer lanes also have more chase potential. Think how scary a Riven is when she can Q Q Q E chase you from her tower to yours. She might be able to get through 2 or even 3 full spell rotations and in the midlane she'd only go through one rotation. \n\nThis is all just laning, not objectives like dr/baron or sieging which is a whole lot more to talk about and even my TLDR is a fcking wall of text =_=", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424958853", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I don't think it ever kicked in.  2 weeks ago I had a cavity filled and they gave me a Valium for that (my dentists isn't one of those generous pill prescribers, I really am that big of a baby when it comes to going to the dentist) and I felt like I had 4 shots and chased it with 2 beers.  This time, for the gum surgery, i was stone cold sober.\n\nOnce in the chair, they poked me with a bunch of needles to numb the area... I only had 1 tooth with a receiding gum line so i consider myself lucky.  They still numbed my whole face.  Its such a weird feeling.  Once I was numb I could only hear scraping and some other tools.  The smell of a sanded tooth is quite gross.  I'm still not sure what they did, I'd rather not know and just trust they know what they're doing.  I closed my eyes and tried to relax.\n\nafter about 45 minutes they were done.  I was still numb enough that i was able to go grocery shopping with my friend who drove me (because you can't drive on Valium).  After about an hour walking around the grocery store (she take f o r e v e r) the numbness started to wear off and then i felt pain.  my teeth were throbbing.  i needed the Vicodin (its not real Vicodin, its hydrocodone and ibuprofen mixed together) .  it says you can take 1 every 4-6 hours so I took one at 7 pm and felt pretty sleepy around 10.  I'm constantly icing it too.  \n\nI had my first post-op apt yesterday and the doctor said its healing well.  I see him again in 3 weeks.  \n\nbecause i needed to get back to work i haven't taken the strong pain killers because i'm basically worthless.  So I've been taking 3-4 Advil or ibuprofen as needed.  I'm definitely in more pain 2 days after and will probably leave work this afternoon.  \n\ni can't eat anything hard so I've been enjoying pudding, fruit cups, bananas, string cheese, oatmeal and ice cream.  will keep you posted on any major developments. \n\nI wold recommend taking headphones and listening to music during the procedure if you don't like the sound of scraping and drilling!\n\nhope this helps.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424967949", "subreddit": "Dentistry", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The song is called Hot Freaks and it was released in 1994 by Guided By voices on an album called Bee Thousand.  Every song on the album is under 3:05 in length and they are all recorded using \"shitty\" audio equipment.  This song is a good example of the style of music that GBV has coined; irreverent lo-fi pop rock that still somehow has elements of stadium rock magic (mostly from the front man Robert Pollard who is a hell of a performer and does badass super rock kicks during his shows).  \n\nBefore starting GBV Robert Pollard was an elementary school teacher and has referred to his songs as fairy-tales for grownups.  Despite being a school teacher he had always dreamed of being in a band as a child and would often make up band that didn't exist just to give them names and album artwork.

{"body": "Maokai and Irelia differ heavily in lane, and fulfill a different spot in terms of a team comp.\n\nMaokai is an AP sponge that provides CC and decent frontline in teamfights. His laning is decent with suffice base damages and a rush of RoA. \n\n\nIrelia is more of a bruiser that will dominate mid game. Laying low in early levels, she thrives once level 7 and beyond with her sustainability. Trinity Force is her biggest power spike, as it provides all stats that benefit her greatly. As a bruiser, Irelias goal is to damage as much things as possible, preferably the ADC or any damage threat. As the game progresses, you will notice her ability to stay on top of these threats become difficult.\n\n\nPersonally, I have more experience as Maokai, so I'll leave Irelia for others, not saying no one should talk about Mao.\n\nFor Mao, Dorans Ring + Pots is optimal as it provides you with health, AP, and mana regen. This synergizes well with your built in sustain from your passive. Your Q is going to be used along with your E to clear waves. Once you have a bigger mana pool, using your Ulti to clear large waves may not be a bad idea. Your W does damage based off of % max health, so this helps damage some tankier targets. I start E Q Q W and Max R&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E. E is a one point wonder as the other abilities are superior.\n\n\nItem wise, rush RoA, as it provides optimal stats for an AP tank. After, you can build specifically. For MR, Spirit Visage would work well with your sustain. Armor wise, Frozen Heart will provide mana, CDR, Armor, and an aura that works well with your role that you fit -- a tanky, disrupting monster. Or you could go Randuin's Omen, as it provides Hp while Frozen Heart does not. I usually throw in a Warmogs and Rightous Glory. I know you may think that 2 catalysts seems wonky, but its active benefits your team while you gapclose. \n\n\nRunes go something along the lines of Attack Speed Reds (for more opportunities to prof your passive and his incredibly slow AA animation), Health/lvl Yellows, AP blues vs AD and MR blues against AP, and 2 Armor Quints and an AP quint.\n\n\nGOOD LUCK WITH GROOT\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1424987454", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The O N L Y reason we were near the top of the league in points was the obscene amount of touchdowns we got from special teams and defense along with the edge we have in drives due to our offensive style. \n\nBy any fair metric that takes into account anything we were barely a top half offense.\n\nAlso the defense had to deal with our 40s 3 and out offense and a league high amount of turnovers. It is flat out absurd to compare them to our group. \n\nLook at DVOA our defense was actually rated higher then our offense. And stop looking at crap like Yards and points when massive other factors played into that like our non offensive touchdowns and nonstop turnovers. \n\nAlso come on with the run game defense, we just ran a ton off times and had a ton of plays. We weren't even top half in YPC and had the second most fumbles lost on run plays in the NFL. \n\nThis all isn't to say we will struggle next year but good god who the hell watched that offense last year and was happy with them.\n\nI just can't understand the opinions coming out of some of you guys that follow the Eagles close enough to be posting in the sub in February yet just ignore how awful our offense was compared to expectations.

{"body": "Honestly dude, everybody here speculating that Qli or BA will get hit in some major way are arguing this largely because their non-tier rogue decks routinely get face rolled by both Qli and BA players. Neither will see major hits on this list. Hitting Scout or Saqlifice really shits on the deck, a more realistic limit (if any were to happen; spoiler: it won't) would be to Stealth. That card is nuts.\n\nNever played BA but have played against them. Incredibly good deck, not broken, won't be hit. I honestly feel that if any direct limiting/banning were to happen, it would be Nekroz, taken from what we saw in the OCG. Konami likes money though (as they should, they are a business after all) so we may not see even that.\n\nRegardless of how safe the investment is you should test both and see make a determination as to which one he would like to play more. As you can tell from quite of a bit of this subreddit, Qli produces a metric s h i t t o n of salt, which is why I love playing them. Figure out his play style, or what he would look for in a deck, and use that to make your decision. Every tier 1/2 deck will see some sort of limit unless they get power creeped hard, there's really no point in trying to predict the future.\n\ntl;dr Yosenjbros and Glad Beast fangirls qq moar cuz Scout + build what he would like, not what you think is safe", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425094168", "subreddit": "yugioh", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Reading holy scriptures is essential to understanding classical literature, a vast proportion of western philosophy and history and even the sciences.  The Bible is the most important piece of western literature that exists, believe its content entirely or partially or not at all, along with the writings of the post-sophist greeks, the roman poets such as Ovid and Virgil, and in turn Dante (back full circle to the Bible, especially the new testament.)\n\nWithout any knowledge of any of these documents, we'll never produce a set of critically thinking, well educated children.\n\n&gt; Just educate them on critical thinking and logic.\n\nAnd what of the history of thinking critically, and of logic?

And of his influence on philosophy and thought even today?  And of Saint Augustine? \n\n&gt; Then, ONLY when they turn 16\n\nWhy are you using your age as the cutoff?

Strong no.  \nH - Showed up for the big games but that's about it. They are .500 vs the top 100. On the bubble, slightly leaning yes.  \nI - Similar to H but slightly worse overall. Leaning no.  \nJ - Not a contender to win, but they should be a tournament team. Strong yes.  \nK - They are 8-2 vs 26-100, that's good. 4 losses to sub-100 teams is bad. On the bubble, leaning yes.  \nL - Winning record vs the top 50 helps their case. 2 losses vs the basement doesn't. Leaning yes.\n \n \nStrong Y: J  \nLean Y: B, H, K, L  \nToss Up: C, F  \nLean N: A, E, I  \nStrong N: G   \n \nYou said pick 6, so J B H K &amp; L are in.  1 spot remains for my 2 \"toss up\" teams.  \n\n\nC and F have the same record at 19-9.  F has performed better against top opponents, but worse against sub-100.  It comes down to a preference between consistancy or potential I suppose.

{"body": "1. You say you are perfectionists... remember you said that! ;-)\n2. The good? \n\n* Fairly sexy site design. \n* Minimalist is all hip and trendy lately.\n* Nice hipster appeal to the photography elements.\n* The minimalist line art style is very blueprint-centric and minimalist\n* Well laid out color scheme\n\nI already mentioned the video in another post so there is that. You came to reddit and some of us are nerderiffic types so I went back to check out your site a second time and looked without expecting a video and found myself feeling \"skeptical consumer\" pretty quickly and here is why... I don't build sites, I just critique them for our guys because I can visit a site as an objective consumer. I know HOW to build them, I just hate dealing with trying to design by committee.\n\nWhen I visit a site trying to sell me something there had better not be a single, solitary detail that makes me feel uneasy about my purchase. A website scattered across several different domains is \"uneasy strike 1\". You have links to your content on getquip.com, getquip.squarespace.com, quipnyc.zendesk.com, quip.theresumator.com,  and GMail too! Nw I understand you are in in Beta, maybe even alpha, but if you are taking orders... how many visitors did you fail to convert to sales because someone had an \"uneasy consumer\" moment?\n\neverything.... e v e r y t h i n g... should be on getquip.com because scam sites spread content over a bunch of free domains, trial period domains, etc. Again, I know you are early stage here and understand completely the use of third party ware for development, but NEVER in a production environment.\n\n\"uneasy strike 2\" any company where they use GMail instead of somename@getquip.com probably doesn't have their act together if they can't mail through their own domain, how can I trust them with my money?\n\n\"uneasy strike 3\"?\n\nhttp://www.getquip.squarespace.com/insiderpreview/\n\nNo! BAD COMPANY! BAD! BAD! Go to your kennel! A consumer should NEVER find anything like a link to something \"insider\". It has far too many potential interpretations. Is this multilevel marketing? Is this a scam? Is this where those \"in the know\" get to see and bid on the credit card and email info that this scam site is harvesting?\n\nOddities:\n\n* In the photography sequences the consumer online has been conditioned that most everything with a line underneath it is a clickable link. \"Refresh Your Ritual\", \"Engage\" etc overlays have underlines yet not links. A razor thin line might achieve the aesthetic you are after for separation between the header thought and the explainer thought without appearing too \"clickable\"\n* The first clickable link on the \"get quip\" website is labeled \"the quip\". First thought? \"This should link to THE quip. What exactly is THE quip?\" yet the site area linked to is just a link space for the photo gallery and a chance to scroll down for more information. It should link to precisely what THE quip is.\n* DESIGNED FOR THE MODERN LIFESTYLE &lt;-- line style issue\n\n* ENGINEERED TO DO THE BASICS BETTER &lt;-- line style issue\n\n* DELIVERED WITHOUT HASSLE, FOR LESS &lt;-- line style issue\n\n* The text on the graphics just below the above listed line issues mentioned is really washed out against the white, I would increase the text color darkness.\n\n* Directly below the above images are more line issue word blurbs with line link issues\n* DO THE BASICS, BETTER this comma no matter how grammatically correct or incorrect looks out of place.\n* If the consumer has to \"study\" your infographics for am/pm, mins per day, every 3 months to make the \"connections\" between \"once in the am and once in the pm, two mins a day, and then replace every three months\" then the graphics are incongruent and not working to serve the meme you are trying to establish.  It's not just an apples and oranges comparison here, it's an apples, puppies, and bacon comparison. \n\nFor instance graphic number ONE should reference ONE of something, not TWICE of something like daily brushing. I can study and see that I should brush ONE time in the am and ONE time in the PM but that is technically a TWO thought not a ONE thought and the ONE position graphic should be a very clear number ONE of something. The TWO position graphic references TWO minutes, but has FOUR intersecting lines. I have to study again.The THREE position graphic references THREE months replacement cycle, but without the number 3 within the graphic I see TWO intersecting lines of the circle. I have to study again. Sure they are graphic design \"eye candy\" elements but they don't sell their point. Please teach me, but don't make me study times per day, to minutes per time, but only use those tools for this period of months. Consumers for the most part suck at math and mentally avoid it.\n\n* When you plan to use these design elements as pattern stimulators within other graphics such as the \"replace every 3 months\" graphic it should contain some symbolic \"3\". The 2 small lines intersecting the circular graphic make me think \"2\" and your number two from above means TWO minutes, so do I only use this thing for 2 minutes or throw it away after 2 months? No wait we throw things away after three months, but there is no 3 here? Let me scroll back up and see what the circle with two lines means. Clear and Concise should be the mantra with no need for the customer to backtrack. Einstein said that if you can't explain it simply, you don' understand it well enough.\n\n* ELECTRIC BRUSH STARTER PACK FROM $25 &lt;-- line issue, Even I tried to click this as if it were a link.\n* CHOOSE A HANDLE, GET FREE HEAD &amp; PASTE SET &lt;-- Head &amp; Paste? Really? S'rsly? Do you wanna be a meme? Because THIS is how you become a meme. And not the good kind of meme either.\n\nJust one guy's opinion that breaks this down for a web dev team on sites for customers several times per month. Love em, hate em, just thoughts and ideas from what I have seen changed and raise conversion rates on visitors to sales. *shrug* I am fully prepared for you to tell me to bugger off now with no hard feelings! ;-)\n\nEDIT: Some typos cuz ~~werds~~ words are hard", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425108255", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Many of the creative directors have stated that they are upset with how advanced the wasteland is getting.\n\nI honestly can't stand this argument, for two good reasons.\n\n1: Why in seven donkey fucking hells are we bothering with trying to climb back out of the stone age for a second time if advancement is *bad*?! If it's truly bad that society is recovering from it's to-date biggest derp then let's have a game where the main quests all revolve around one person's quest to amass and binge watch every episode of Top Gear UK that ever aired? Final bossfight is convincing a two hundred year old TV to work, then getting the holotape player to read the damn discs, then finally blowing the dust and grit out of the disk before sticking it in with a beer in one hand and a model of a sports car in the other. Cue Top Gear theme, run credits, pay the Beeb.\n\n\nIt's just silly to say that advancement is bad. That's the entire thing that every single Fallout game has been working towards. Even the ones people cry about being non-canon or semi-canon were all working towards society climbing back out of the stone age and once more flourishing despite its best efforts to eradicate itself and all other known life forms.\n\n2: There's tons of regions and time periouds left untouched in every single way. Getting bored of watching society recover in the southwest? Let's try NYC! Or, hell, Detroit. That place was a ruined shithole of a warzone **before** the atom bombs fell, can't wait to see it post-apocalypse. Maybe a game in anchorage where a major sidequest is sleuthing out what *actually* happened during the conventional war in 2076? Maybe a survival horror game set *during* the Great War itself wherein your sole goal is simply to survive armageddon. God only knows the market's eating those sorts of games up and I'm sure a Fallout SH game would make L O D S of E M O N E. I'd most certainly be interested in a game set in Nashville, since that's only an hour's drive from where I live, and since it's a major transport hub for the entire country, a cultural/tourist hotspot, a major manufacturing city and a rather sizeable population center it's gonna get bombed to all hell and back when the nukes fly.\n\n\n&gt; Legion won't win because having the courier be canonically bad would be kinda sucky.\n\nThere might have been an argument for a canon legion win if Obsidian had another six months to work on New Vegas. They had to cut a LOT of content to meet release date and the Legion bore the brunt of it.\n\n&gt; House won't win because it's implied that he would catapult technology far into the future (like space travel) and that too would make the wasteland too advanced.\n\nListening to the Ink Spots while bounding around on the moon shooting aliens sounds like fun to me.\n\n&gt; . Think about it, the NCR is weak and will ultimately fall. \n\nMany people said the same thing about the Second Continental Congress waaay back in the 1700s. That's sort of the thing with America: We tend to tell naysayers to go fuck themselves and prove them wrong if only just to prove a point. The NCR's doing a hell of a lot better than the actual US Government did when it was that young. Yeah sure there's corruption, but guess what? No government is free of that. And who's to say the Courier isn't themselves a corrupt shitstain that makes Lanius look positively benign?\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425156080", "subreddit": "Fallout", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

All letters had the same values in the IPA with these two exceptions: ŋ was N before a G or a K, very rarely at the end of words and w was U before, between and after vowels, as it commonly happens with various Ashtalaic languages.\n\nModern Vystrilanian now has more phonemes. It now has a \"seven or nine, depending on your point of view\" vowel system, which comprises of /a e i o u ɐ ɨ ɛ ɔ/ (ɐ ɨ being written as â and y, respectively, ɛ ɔ occur depending on stress) and new consonants were brought in from Ashtalaian. t and d developed into ts (written c) and dz, s and z into ʃ (written š) and ʒ (written ž), in turn ts and dz developed into tʃ (written č)  and dʒ (written dž), p and b into v and f, l and n into ʎ (written ļ) and ɲ (written ņ) and k and g into c (written ķ) and ɟ (written ģ).\n\nI might enhance this with the modern day equivalent. For now, I'll leave you with the translation:\n\nA: My neighborhood is a bit problematic. Could you step the grass?\n\nB: I would pass it, but I'm not allowed to.\n\nA: That's right.
