{"body": "I disagree. I think it was one of the few tournaments where I was entertained the whole time and kept me engaged for 3 hours straight. (I don't regret a second of it). I think you're over generalizing. Reckful isn't a rank 25 scrub who just started. He's good at hearthstone. His current rank is close to legend. His arena knowledge may not be as great as Kripps, but that has nothing to do with this. Would you have 2 Kripparians as commentators? Reckful provided many jokes that made everyone, including Kripp laugh. He even made the whole chat spam frankerz when he said woof. Without him, it would have been much less entertaining. \n\nAdding onto that, I don't recall them actually dissing anyone. SivHD is the exception because Siv either was treating the tournament as a joke (which was hilarious xD dual dust devil for the win) or wasn't as experienced as the other players. Even Siv took it all in good fun, laughing himself many times at the plays.\n\nFor the charities, I don't think it's their responsibility. Sure, it's more convenient to those who don't know whats going on, but I am pretty sure searching it up is just as easy as hearing it from Kripp or Reck. The advertisements may have seen a bit tedious but I found it amusing. I laughed everytime the G2A ads came on and the chat was just facepalming or spamming S E L L O U T. You have to understand that they are sponsors for a reason. And since it is a one time event, it makes more sense to play more rather than a tournament that is stretched out for like 3 or 4 days. \n\nNot sure what you mean by professionalism. It was a tournament for charity. The whole experience was meant to be fun. If you want professionalism, go watch pro hearthstone. There is a reason TheOddone and Trump both got placed into this tournament to play arena. When you take all of this into account, you realize that the tournament was actually well done.

The A and D are very dissonant over the C. \n \nAfter playing with the melody for a while, I settled on changing the first A to a G. Now the notes are G C D C for the call, and G C D A.

Glad that they kept the characters being the same usual self and the opening and ending songs are as awesome as the original series. \n\nFor this OVA, it's great to see the story focusing on cute girls going on camping. From start to finish, the girls had their own fun in activities such as sightseeing, cooking and \"courage test\".

But she came up with the buffer and the dilation matrix. Always good with the details compared to my big picture thinking.\n\nI'm fiddling with my shoulder mounted cameras, testing my sensors, mentally reviewing my dead languages. She's already deactivating and reintegrating. A wet pop cracks the sky. Her time bubble sparks and a piles of skin collapses neatly on the ground. That shouldn't happen. \n\nI hit the fine gain control on my viewer. The probes indicated her layers stretch across fifty years, refusing to arrive as a whole in a singular point. Nerves 40, piles on blood 20, an eyeball spiralling into existence over a decade, a tongue and some teeth on the ground somewhere in the first century.\n\nWe knew the chance of a dissolution. We expected to be vaporized all at once. I reenter the slipstream. If I go back to the future but before we took the trip, I can save her from this past. We'll be better equipped to get me out of my bubblelayer as well. \n\nThe emergency chute has enough juice to fire me down the stream without scarring the landscape. I crash head-first into her bubble as it descends from the future and my past. We lock eyes. I forgot we already took the trip, will always take the trip. Just reversing my jump without plotting a whole new course means I got in her way. \n\nThe collision chopped her up across the timeline. My bubble keep hard dropping me into the point before the collision. Poorly implemented safety feature. My shoddy design. I thought navigating fourth dimensionally would nicely - I crash headfirst into her - resolve itself like a highway, not an avalanche. \n\nI keep seeing my wife cascade across at least a quarter century with each impact. My internal sensors pick up powerful energy readings with each crack. I'm developing hairline cracks, losing cohesion - I lock eyes with her. I pull the emergency chute. It makes things worse. I reset to the chutepull like a bad save checkpoint. I can't resist pulling the chute. My awareness separation from the loop won't last much longer. I crash headfirst into her. Gotta  fix this. I can save us. Her dividing out is my fault. I crash head-first into her bubble as it descends.  She's horrified. She is always horrified. She takes the trip once but sees endless mes crashing into her.

{"body": "Fuck OK here\nI'm not writing an elaborate story about a ghost killing my family cause I used a oujia board or some made up story. So here it is.\n\nI was in 8th grade when my friends and i decided to get a cheap oujia board from wal mart. At that time my group was looking to get into weird shit so we can have stories to tell when we are older much like every kid when they're in middle school, right? So we got the board and decided when we should try it out, it was near the end of the school year so we decided to do it the second to last day of school, which isn't important to know but I'm just giving you a time frame cause why not. So the time has arrived, it was a beautiful June night, with no breeze and a shit ton of mosquito's. My friend set up a fire in his back yard and we chilled and ate smores, talking about boobs and our futures. It was getting pretty late so we decided to put out the fire and head inside to so we can do the oujia board. In the basement of my close friends house there's two rooms, one that is the main area and the laundry/gym room so we shut out the lights, and it was pitch black, except the board because we bought a glow in the dark one (smart) but the area we did it was right next to the entry to the gym room so you can see a silhouette of a punching bag, nothing creepy. My friends got in their spots on I got mine, which was directly next to the entry way. So we do the opening thing welcoming the spirits and shit. My friends didn't ask anything because they were too scared so i manned up and started asking the questions. \"Is there any sprits here?\" I asked as clear as I can to the board. The planchette started to move.. It moved to the word \"yes.\" My friends were freaking out, trying to figure who fucking moved the planchette. I asked \"how did you die?\" And it spelt out S U I C I D E, and then I asked \"how did you kill your self?\" It answered G U N. At this point my friends were shitting themselves, so to lighten up the mood I asked it some funny questions like \"did you have a mustache?\" It said no, so I asked \"do you hate mustaches?\" It said yes. So we're cracking up having fun with this spirit so I asked it \"when did you die?\" It spelt out 1972. Now I start to feel really cold, and my leg which was halfway in the laundry room, so I look into the room and see the silhouette of the punching bag moving. It was swaying back and forth, kinda freaked out I didn't mention it to anyone. So I start asking it more questions about its life and what not and it answered every question. Nothing scary happening or anything so I asked it \"is heaven and hell real?\" It took a couple seconds but it moved to the yes. I asked it \"is 2012 actually going to happen?\" (This was in 2009) it answered no. It stopped answering us, so we just started talking to each other and then my friend was like \"did you guys notice whenever we asked questions the punching bag kept moving?\" And I automatically answered \"YES\" feeling relieved that I wasn't the only one who noticed, we start asking for another spirit to come through. One did. I asked \"are you a good spirit?\" It violently pushed to no. I felt my hairs stand on end, and felt a warmness on my legs, I ignored it and continued asking questions. Getting no good answers one of my friends blurted out \"who do you hate the most in here?\" It started pushing to the letters spelling out R Y A N. My fucking name. Everyone started freaking the fuck out and some how I got pushed into a wall. We quickly said goodbye and ran outside.\n\nI have used Ouija boards since and never had an experience like that again. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425301667", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Here are couple msgs I posted on a similar thread few weeks ago*    \nAnswering your last question about mixing pentatonic/blues scales - YES, you should mix major and minor blues/pentatonic scales.   \nHere is roadmap for e.g. slow blues:    \nBar 1: C7(9)   \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 2: F7(9)   \nC minor blues or F major/dominant blues.    \nBar 3-4: C7(9)   \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 5-6: F7(9)    \nC minor blues or F major/dominant blues.    \nBar 7-8: C7(9)   \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 9: G7(9)    \nC minor blues or G major/dominant blues.    \nBar 10: F7(9)   \nC minor blues or F major/dominant blues.    \nBar 11: C7(9) F7(9)    \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 12: C7(9) G7(9)    \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \n\nThere are 4 general, simple ways you can play on blues:    \nA. C minor blues all the way through    \nB. C major blues switching to C minor blues on IVth (F7) chord)    \nC. Use major blues scale based on chord type - C major blues over C7, F major blues over F7, G major blues over G7.  On faster more jazzy style like eg jump blues you can use mixolydian scale instead of major blues scale.    \nD. mix all the above from chorus to chorus.    \n\nAs far as your other question... When you say:    \n\"I played it along with the C major backing track. Of course I was playing the Am pentatonic scale\".    \nThat is a bit vague.    \n    \nWhat style was the track in? If somebody plays you a song that only uses diatonic chords from C major scale - i.e. chords based on scale step - eg. simple triads C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am (skipping Bdim for the sake of simplicity) then yes - all you have to play over any of these chords is C major scale. Possibly outlining tones of the chord - eg. over Em you do not want to play C  (unless as a passing tone) - rather concentrate on E, G, B - possible D since it is next extension. And yes you can limit yourself as far as choices of the notes - use pentatonic or even blues scales to give the solo a bit of  a blues flavor. In some cases it will sound good and in some other it will not. If the feeling song relies on a strong resolution to tonic (going back to C chord via eg G7 -&gt; C chords) then perhaps doing it all blues may be out of style. Or perhaps you want a bluesy solo and very major scale sounding vocals. It is an aesthetic choice. Point is you can always use C major scale or any subset of the tones.     \n\nIf song is in C and may be a blues (major blues to be precise) - in that case you use the approach above - you do NOT play C major - in particular you stay away from B to C resolution (which is normal for C major soloing) as it \"kills bluesiness\".    \n \nThere are some tunes that are \"modal\" (not having traditional back to tonic - back to C resolution) - example may be Sweet Home Alabama - on those you often use modes and not scales - most typical is Mixolydian mode. Also Dorian mode.    \n\nAlso song may be in C but it may have a stretch modulating to other key - eg. G major or F major or even Eb major. Or minor keys. In such case what you play is dictated by a LOCAL tonality/key center and you may need notes that are outside C major scale.    \n \nLastly - you often use notes \"out of scale\" to create dissonance in your playing - typically to heighten the resolution - in case of song in C it would be when progression goes back to rest on C chord - eg. G7 -&gt; C. It is called \"playing out\" and is not beginner level stuff. So e.g. you can \"jazz up\" playing over blues to almost no end.      \nHope it helps.\n\n\n*and another one*    \nI would not say you can \"use parallel minor\" but observe that (see definitions below):    \nA minor pentatonic = A C E D G A     \nC major pentatonic = C D E G A C  \nSo these are same tones - rule is if you play minor pentatonic you play major pentatonic a third above (A -&gt; C is a third - 3 semitones above - more precisely a \"minor third\" but that is minutiae).  \n\nLets settle some definitions:     \nMajor pentatonic scale: 1 2 3 5 6 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nMinor pentatonic scale: 1 b3 4 5 b7 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nOR    \nMinor pentatonic scale: 1 3 4 5 7 1 (wrt to natural minor scale)      \nBlues scale (major): 1 2 b3 3 5 6 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nBlues scale (minor): 1 b3 4 #4/b5 5 b7 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nOR    \nBlues scale (minor): 1 3 4 #4/b5 5 7 1 (wrt to major scale)      \n\nExample: key of A     \nA major scale: A B C# D E F# G# A    \nA natural minor: A B C D E F G A   \n(derived from C major scale as starting on 6th step: A)   \nA major pentatonic scale: 1 2 3 5 6 1 of major scale = A B C# E F# A    \nA minor pentatonic scale: 1 b3 4 5 b7 1 of major scale = A C D E G A   \nOR   \nA minor pentatonic scale: 1 3 4 5 7 1 of minor scale = A C D E G A      \nA blues scale (major): 1 2 b3 3 5 6 1 of major scale = A B C C# E F# A   \nA blues scale (minor): 1 b3 4 #4/b5 5 b7 1 of major scale = A C D D#/Eb E G A   \nOR   \nA blues scale (minor): 1 3 4 #4/b5 5 7 1 of minor scale = A C D D#/Eb E G A      \n  \nIf you play track that is say A major blues:     \nA7 D7 A7 A7     \nD7 D7 A7 A7    \nE7  D7 A7D7 A7E7    \nYou can use:     \n1.

{"body": "&gt;  I know for sure that the top note of a chord is the one its named after.\n\nThat's actually not correct. The \"top\" note (the lowest pitched note) of a chord is most often its root, but not always. When the root note is not the lowest pitched note, it's called a chord inversion. It sometimes is denoted with a slash followed by the lowest note name (such as [C/E](https://themusiclesson.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/root-note-1.png)), but they can also be called the same as the \"normal\"/non-inverted chord.\n\nAs to how they're built, in western (occidental) music we most often use tertian harmony, meaning chords are composed from intervals of thirds. So from a scale, a common triad chord will use the root, 3rd and 5th of the scale . From the C major scale (C D E F G A B), you'd have C E G as the chord notes, and you'd find these notes in roughly the same location on different strings and play that as a chord. That's why a \"C\" chord can be played many different ways. Then you get into the more \"complicated\" constructions, adding 7ths, flatting or sharping notes, suspending notes, etc...

I had created an entire world, something I thought was original idea. Judging by the hundred of other worlds around me, it wasn’t. Other students had created beautiful planets, brimming with trees and life. I looked over at Vishnu, one of my friends. He had created a world as well. It had deep rivers and towering mountains. I glanced at my world. Simply put, it was a disaster. I had made it in a week, and I was only able to create two perfect inhabitants in the beginning. But it was buggy. I had to flood it and try again. I only had two days left by then, so I left it in the oven overnight. I hoped that the heat would make the world grow faster, but it only burnt the crust and made new problems. And the inhabitants weren’t much better. I don’t even want to know how they reproduced so fast. When I put it in the oven last night, there were only 100, maybe 150, people on my planet. Now there were close to seven billion. And they were incredibly violent. I’d give them 2 days, maybe less, before they hunted each other to extinction. I didn’t care. I just needed them to get through this day.\n\nI snapped out of my trance as the judges came over. They took one look at my project and started writing. That wasn’t a good sign. I cleared my throat and started my presentation.\n\n“Hello, I am Greg Owen Davis. And as you can see I’ve made a beautiful world from scratch.”\n\nThe judges raised their eyebrows. One of them spoke up.\n\n“Yes...beautiful...What did you name your planet?”\n\n*Shit, I had forgotten to give it a name*\n\n“Errrrr...th!”\n\n“Errth?”\n\n“Yes. Earth. Spelled E A R T H.”\n\n“I see...and how did you come up with that name?”\n\n*STOP ASKING QUESTIONS!*\n\n“Well, you see, I...uh...wanted to...um...make sure my planet was beautiful. So I...uh...put art in it...ya, I put art in it! And...um...the E and H werrrrrrre the names of my pets! Yep. E and H. Great pets.”\n\n*Nailed it.*\n\nThe judges stared at me. If their faces could talk, I’m sure they would say “What. The. Hell.” After what seemed like an eternity of awkward silence, one of them finally spoke. \n\n“I see...that’s an...interesting…origin. We will look at your...Earth...now.”\n\nThey swooped in, looking close at the inhabitants and taking notes. I tried to peek at one of their grading sheets, but I couldn’t see anything. \n\n“You have some very violent inhabitants. Did you make them this way?”\n\n“No no no no no. They were born that way. I couldn’t change it.”\n\nThis brought on another awkward silence. \n\n“So, just so I have it straight, you made this world, right?”\n\n“Yes. From scratch. I’m ver-”\n\n“And you can’t even control your own creations?”\n\n“I gave them free will…”\n\n“You what? Why would you do that?”\n\n“I thought...you know…It would be cool.”\n\n“….We are done here.”\n\nThe judges walked away, leaving a large, red F in their wake.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone, About4001llamas here.

What about people who came across as thinking they were \"smart\" or hip because they knew about Miss Fame last year when other people didn't? I watched RPDR religiously and I still had no idea who Miss Fame was. I first discovered this sub in October of 2014, and so many threads were or turned into Miss Fame discussions, full of fanboy hashtags like #teamfame #teamho #teampearl when the show hadn't aired. If you didn't know Fame, then you were out of the loop, and the implication was that you needed to go educate yourself and get life. It was so ubiquitous and saturated, my friend /u/argylenavy and I will still send each other \"M I S S F A M E\" messages when we wake up in the morning, because it is funny. \n\nHipsters do exist and they ruin shit. People want their experiences and opinions validated like the special snowflake they are. I'm not refuting that. But, with higher expectations, comes higher scrutiny.  Treating her like any other contestant while remaining careful of the hype isn't an intellectual stroke-off, I don't think.

{"body": "&gt;What role does Ashe play in a team composition?\n\nShe is a utility adc. Has an above average AA range and has good AS per level. But is primarily picked for her utility- permslow onhit with autos, spammable aoe slow on W and most importantly one of the best initiation skills in the game. She works best when her team already has good damage and or is lacking CC.\n\n&gt;Core items?\n\nIE into shiv/pd into lw followed by bt and defensive items.\n\nGhostblade can replace your AS item and lucidity boots in place of zerkers - cdr builds for more ults are fun alternative builds but Ashe gets the most dmg from a pd/shiv because she's really aa based.\n\n&gt;Skill order?\n\nStart W Q W E then max W followed by Q. Little room for anything else- W cd is drastically reduced per point and maxing Q scales her onhit/W slow.\n\n&gt; Powerspikes?\n\nHuge spike at 6- instantly gets massive kill pressure/gank setup / pick potential. Otherwise spikes at 2item like other aa based adcs.\n\n&gt;Synergy ?\n\nPick comps, assassins, chain CC, etc. Works best when she is a secondary threat and isn't getting hard dove - Ashe excels vs kitable melees but not cc bruisers. Vi J4 Hecarim Sion etc all roll her if she gets locked up by their initial cc. Ashe wants to sit back and hit R and kite/clean up after major ccs are blown on her teams assassins.\n\nExcels with strong roaming mid laners/strong map presence top/jungles(read: high dmg or cc jungle/top lane picks) and a support champ that can chain CC for picks or peel extremely well. Supports that work well are Morgana Blitz Thresh Janna Annie and so on.\n\n&gt;Counterplay?\n\nHard engage. Good vision. Mikaels. Ashe doesn't have a massive dmg steroid like Jinx or Twitch or Kog and suffers from strong gap closer plus cc combinations that abuse her no mobility.

{"body": "Level 1\n\nALWAYS Ambush snipe - no discussion. It is simply one of Nova's best talents. Her bread and butter skill, missing 20% increased dmg is game changing for her. If you constantly find yourself oom as Nova - you do not know how to play her properly.\n\n\nLevel 4\n\nOne of the only talents, which I switch in games. Envenom or Gathering power. Envenom if you need early power spike, its flaw is its range. Gathering power is still good after nerfs, and help you tip your dmg, crucial especially mid and late game.\n\nLevel 7\n\nUnless you want be a hipster and go “AA build Nova” (which imo is bs). You A L W A Y S go for anti-armor here. The entire essence of Nova revolves around this talent. “But Niaz, it makes Nova so bad at doing almost any objective in the game”. Nova’s job is not to grind obj camps or etc. It is to isolate and take out stragglers, ppl out of position etc almost instantly and disappear without retaliation. \n\nLevel 10 \n\nI’ve played a lot with both triple tap and PS. PS is simply better. Global range and AOE dmg also gives Nova her lacking team fight presence. Good setup with divine storm or VP. Triple tap is good for 1on1 and even then, if you play against good players, it is almost impossible to get a good ult off. Against ppl who group or in later team fights it is close to useless.\n\nLevel 13\n\nLethal Decoy no choice. The rest is close to useless. While advanced cloaking may seem like a good idea on paper. It simply doesn’t give you anything you cant make up for in positioning. Lethal decoy can give you the last dmg you need to finish off your enemy, or make it easier for you to kill them behind corners and walls.\n\nLevel 16\n\nCrippling shot or Double fake. Crippling shot if your team has a lot of burst dmg to make it even more potent. However the meta now revolves around sustain and long fights with multiple support and tank setups. Therefore, I often find myself going double fake more often, but crippling shot is definitely just as good.\n\nLevel 20\n\nNever go any of the improved ulties. Why? Cuz they aren’t good. Simply put bolt and rewind are both so much better, its not even funny. Imp triple taps weakness is the ability itself, read the part where I talk about ults. If you don’t get kills with it, its useless. Double PS may seem to be powerful, but rarely good. Bolt of the storm if you feel like they have a lot of divers/CC/Disruptors \nRewind if you want pure dmg.\n\n\n\nOh, and before I get called an elitist jerk blah blah blah.

Here w was left out as not being part of the basic French alphabet; the French braille order is u v x y z ç é à è ù (⠥⠧⠭⠽⠵⠯⠿⠷⠮⠾).[9] The next ten, ending in w, are the same again, except that for this series position 6 (purple dot) is used without position 3. These are â ê î ô û ë ï ü ö w (⠡⠣⠩⠹⠱⠫⠻⠳⠪⠺).[10] The a–j series lowered in dot space (⠂⠆⠒⠲⠢⠖⠶⠦⠔⠴) are used for punctuation. Letters a ⠁ and c ⠉, which only use dots in the top row, were lowered two places for the apostrophe and hyphen: ⠄⠤. (These are the decade diacritics, at left in the table below, of the second and third decade.) In addition, there are ten patterns that are based on the first two letters (⠁⠃) shifted to the right; these were assigned to non-French letters (ì ä ò ⠌⠜⠬) or serve non-letter functions: ⠈ (superscript; in English the accent mark), ⠘ (currency prefix), ⠨ (capital, in English the decimal point), ⠼ (number sign), ⠸ (emphasis mark), ⠐ (symbol prefix).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille#Derivation", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425401220", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

There is a long standing myth that pits have some crazy high bite force, which just isn't true.  \n\n&gt;Pits are near the top.\n\nThey aren't near the top unless you are measuring in their weight range.  \n\n&gt;That is literally in no way what I said or suggested. Not even close. You're just making things up, now.\n\nMy point was that there were lots of them around, and you felt the need to disagree with that conclusion.  What else would I assume you meant?\n\n&gt;Where is it? Oh, it doesn't exist. You prefaced a crap claim with a \"there's no way to know.\" Shocker.\n\nI said there is no way to know exact numbers.  Based on [vet stats](http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/top-dogs-across-america-10-most-popular-breeds-by-state) APBT's are the 3rd most common breed nation wide.  Unfortunately, that doesn't account for any of the dog owners who don't take their dogs to the vet (which would likely be a characteristic of the \"bad owners\").  \n\n\n&gt;The numbers on deaths from dogs don't lie.\n\nSure they can.  Most of those stats are taken from reports in the news, where the alleged breed is based on guesstimation.  Short hair? Stocky? Must be a pit.    \n\n&gt;You can get as mad as you want, pit bulls have more potential to kill than almost any other breed. That is a fact.\n\nPotential to kill is almost 100% tied to size and strength, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of breeds that have more potential to kill than pit bulls.  \n\nMaybe you meant to say likelihood, rather than potential.  The two aren't the same at all.  \n\nThe likelihood depends on a number of variables, perhaps if I outline them you might understand what I was trying to convey earlier.\n\nThe first variable would be how likely you are to encounter that breed, so that would be the population size.  Lets call that variable **P**.  \n\nThe second would be how prone that breed is to attack a human, which we will call **A**.  That variable is itself determined by other variables, the natural human aggressiveness of the breed (**H**) and the likelihood that the breed is abused or socialized to be human aggressive (**S**), which is the hardest to quantify because it relies on evaluating human populations.  Regardless, it is probably safe to say that breeds that are popular in certain criminal cultures are more likely to encounter those issues.  \n\nThe last would be their ability to do damage (**D**) if they decided to try.  Size is far and away the most important factor here, even athletic adult males would have a hard time defending themselves against a 200lb Tibetan Mastiff or Great Dane.  \n\nThen you would have to combine them all to figure out the overall risk.  \n\nMy formula would look something like:  \n  \nLikelihood = D x P x A  \nwhere  \nA = H^(1+S)\n\n\nTibetan Mastiffs have a extremely high **D**, are moderately human aggressive naturally (**H**), yet the overall risk is low, because the population (**P**) is very small, and they aren't very likely to be driven to aggressiveness by humans (**S**), thanks to their rarity and expense (most reputable breeders would weed those potential owners out).  \n\nChihuahuas on the other hand are extremely high on all those risk factors (lots of them around, natural propensity for human aggression, commonly mistreated), but they are too small to do any real damage to non-infants.  That is why they are one of the most bite-y breeds around.  [science](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159108001147)\n\nFor comparison, pit bulls are *extremely* common (triply so since in common parlance \"pit bull\" is a catch all for about ten different regular breeds and any cross breed that even vaguely resembles one) , have a relatively low likelihood of human aggression (by the temperament tests linked earlier), a very high likelihood of being abused/trained for aggression, and a medium to high (depending on which actual breed or breed combo) ability to do damage.

{"body": "It's fine, I completely understand where you and my DM are coming from, I just disagree with both of you wholeheartedly.\n\nI mean, you think that it's okay for a monk to dash 130 feet up a wall, but holding onto two creatures at the same time is on par with spontaneously growing a second head?\n\nIn my opinion, the rules don't fail to say anything concerning grappling except the things you and my DM are asserting as fact.\n\nFrom the PHB:\n\n&gt;G r a p p l in g\n\n&gt;When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it,\nyou can use the Attack action to make a special melee\nattack, a grapple.\n\nYou normally can't grapple and dodge, or dash, or help, etc. in a single turn. Pretty straightforward. (Unless you're a fighter and use your action surge)\n\n&gt;If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\n\nIf you're a Barbarian, Bard, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Warlock, or under some magical effect that gives you an extra attack when you take the attack action, then you could feasibly grapple and attack or make another special attack (shove) in a single turn.\n\n&gt;The target of your grapple must be no more than one\nsize larger than you, and it must be within your reach.\n\nAgain pretty straightforward. The only time this comes into question is when your size changes and you've already got something grappled, does it get to become ungrappled? (Regardless of the very specific wording on what ends a grapple in Appendix A of the PHB)\n\n&gt;Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target\nby making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics)\ncheck contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or\nDexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the\nability to use). \n\nThis says that the prerequisites for engaging a grapple are that you have a free hand. Not a free arm. Not two free hands. It doesn't say you have to bend over them. It doesn't say you have to wrestle with them. It says you have to have a free hand.\n\n&gt;If you succeed, you subject the target to\nthe grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition\nspecifies the things that end it, and you can release the\ntarget whenever you like (no action required).\n\nBoom. That bad boy is grappled. He can't move. I've lost the use of one of my hands for the duration, and my speed is now halved. You can argue all day that it doesn't make sense, but dice ALWAYS speak the truth. You can't make me roll to grapple something and then tell me that I'm partially unsuccessful, or that there are hidden conditions that apply. If I roll a natural 20 to kick down a door at a DC 30 as a character who magically has only 1 STR (-5), guess what? That door is getting kicked the hell down. If I win a grapple contest with a creature, guess what? It's mine. I own that creature. It is grappled, and I am now limited to one hand and half my movement speed. That's it.\n\n&gt;Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its\naction to escape.\n\nNo attempting to escape and attacking. No attempting to escape and helping. Bonus actions are limited to whatever they can do without having a full action (I.E. they can't attack with the butt of a halberd with polearm master because it requires that you take the attack action first)\n\n&gt;To do so, it must succeed on a Strength\n(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by\nyour Strength (Athletics) check.\n\nPretty straight forward. Knocking me prone doesn't end the grapple. Grappling me doesn't end the grapple. Restraining me doesn't technically even end the grapple. There's some wiggle room here with the last bullet on the grappled condition as removing the creature from my reach would end the grapple, but restrained doesn't reference reach whatsoever, and there are no hard and fast rules on tugging something away from me. At best, I'd think another opponent could use the help action to give advantage or negate disadvantage (if the creature is prone or if I'm raging).\n\n&gt;Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you\ncan drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but\nyour speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more\nsizes smaller than you.\n\nPretty straightforward. My movement speed is halved. Not reduced. Nothing about losing any benefit from increased movement speed (a la the Dash action or spells).\n\nEVEN if the DM had to make an exception to make these things work (he doesn't) why is that such a big deal? Is it overpowered?\n\nHere's how an *ideal situation* turns out for this character:\n\nCombat starts. I go first. I use a bonus action to turn into a brown bear. I move to an square adjacent to the enemy. I attempt a grapple. I pass the contest. The creature is now grappled. End turn. Every other enemy that I'm likely surrounded by misses me (miraculously since my AC would be 14 with a brown bear and the barbarian's unarmored feature). The grappled creature fails it's contest to end the grapple. My turn comes up again. I attempt to shove the enemy prone. I pass the contest. The creature is now grappled and prone. End turn. I am missed by every attack again. The grappled creature fails it's contest again. My turn comes up again. I attempt to grapple a 2nd creature. I pass the contest. I now have a grappled and prone creature in one hand, and a grappled creature in the other. End turn. I am missed by every attack again. Both creatures fail their contests to end the grapple. I attempt to shove the 2nd creature to the ground. I pass the contest. I now have 2 creatures that are prone and grappled, one in each hand. End turn. I am missed by every enemy. Both creatures fail their contests to end the grapple. I am finally able to make my first real attack, with two +5 attack rolls, a 1d8+4 and a 2d6+4. They both hit for max damage (28 damage... Criticals would result in 48 damage). End turn. Alternatively I can dash away from the battle in an attempt to use the environment to damage my grappled foes, or attempt to shove them off a cliff (one at a time.) Every opportunity attack that I provoke misses me.... End turn.\n\nThat's 10 contests that I have to pass, and 4X attacks that have to miss me (where X is the number of enemies that are attacking me). Even if I were only trying to grapple one creature before attacking, that's still 4 contests, and 2X attacks that have to miss. Does that sound overpowered to you? Does that sound like an abuse of ambiguous (read as straightforward) rules to you?\n\nThis is all beside the fact that you and my DM are saying that if a Brown Bear came up and grappled me, he could do all of this no problem. Do we *really* need to apply double standards here to keep things \"balanced\"?\n\nEDIT: There's more.\n\n&gt;I consider grappling to be forms of wrestling, including locks, holds, or submissions, moves that restrict the opponent's movement or ability to strike you. I would not consider someone grabbing my ankle to be 'grappled', even if I were on the ground and getting dragged.\n\nDude. You're forgetting that I'm not some Joe Schmoe. I'm a PC. I've got a strength of 19. My strength is *literally on par with a brown bear*. Do you think you could break the grip of someone who is as strong as a brown bear *under any circumstances whatsoever*?\n\nAlso, do you think that if I had you in some sort of lock or submission you'd still be able to swing at me with a weapon? Because according to the rules, you very specifically can.\n\n&gt;I could swing at your hand holding my ankle by rolling to one side, sitting up, etc, and at least in the real world, force you to let go or lose a hand, eventually.\n\nIn the real world, when you hit someone with an unarmored opponent with a longsword, they don't take 1d8+3 slash damage, they die. You can also slash, pierce, or bludgeon someone with a longsword in real life, but that's beside the point. There's specific rules on breaking a grapple, and attacking isn't one of them. You've got to use an action to roll a D20 against my D20 with all relevant modifiers, and hope for the best. You don't get to try to wriggle free and swing with a sword at the same time, no matter how \"realistic\" that sounds.\n\n&gt;And if I were somehow still standing, I'm just going to keep swinging at you while you're occupied with moving me around.\n\nYou'd definitely still be standing since I haven't shoved you yet. But yeah, on your next turn, you're getting shoved prone. Then you can swing that sword all you want... at disadvantage. By the way, I've got a hind claw and a mouth full of teeth that are gonna be coming your way every turn... at advantage.\n\n&gt;Okay, so you're a bear, but as long as you decide not to maul me, what difference does it make?\n\nSeriously? Remember this?:\n\n&gt;Also somewhat reasonable. Think about you grappling a housecat, or a 5-year-old kid, or an adult.\n\nAt least stay consistent.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425451859", "subreddit": "dndnext", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "All key signatures mean is: Which 7 notes make up the harmonic center of any piece of music? From any note, you apply the W W H W W W H formula (whole steps and half steps, or 2 frets and 1 fret) and you get the other notes in that key. For example, the key of C is all natural notes (no sharps of flats), so C D E F G A B. Chords are then build from each note, yielding 7 diatonic (in the same key) chords. \n\nBasic chords are then built from the 1st, 3rd, and 5th degrees above each note. So, if your key signature is all natural (key of C, no sharps or flats) then the notes for the C chord are C, E, and G, yielding a C major chord. The notes for the chord built from the D note are D, F, and A, yielding a D minor chord.  The chord built from the E note are E, G, and B, yielding an E minor chord. And so on and so forth...\n\nWhat you end up with is, in any key, chords built on the 1st, 4th and 5th scale degrees is Major, 2nd 3rd and 6th degrees are minor, and 7th is diminished (but don't worry about diminished just yet).\n\nSO - Let's say you're in the key of G now. If you apply the W W H W W W H formula starting on G, you end up with an F# as the 7th scale degree. So literally, the only difference between the key of C and the key of G is that the key of G has an F# instead of a natural F. That's it.\n\nSO what does this do? When you now build chords from each of the notes in the G major scale, any chord with an F# in it will be different than any chord with an F in it from the key of C major, because the Key signature has changed. \n\nFor example, in the key of C, the chord built on D was D minor ( D F A), where in the key of G, the chord build on D is now D Major (D F# A).  \n\nTo wrap it up, the chord built in the key of C are:\nCma, Dmi, Emi, Fma, Gma, Ami, and Bdim\nChords built in the key of G (F# in the key signature) are:\nGma, Ami, Bmi, Cma, Dma, Emi, F#dim.\n\nI hope this helps.

Flat AD works great the armor pen you buy elsewhere.  \n\nIf you want to go for 3 offensive items then you could go Warrior + LW + either Cleaver or Hydra.  I'd lean towards Cleaver.  Lifesteal isn't a great stat on Pantheon as he doesn't really auto much in a fight.  He just gets so much mileage from Cleaver given his ability to get a full shred in a Q W E Q combo.  The main advantage of Hydra is the splash and auto reset for a little extra burst from autos.  I still would prefer the extra penetration for damage to champions.  \n\nOverall though, I think this problem you are running into is just inherent in Pantheon.

{"body": "I have two best friends who I've known for somewhere around ten years now (a little less, but close enough). However, during high school, I had had a best friend who I had known for ten years at that point in time.\n\nI was a sophomore and she had been pushed up a year to junior. It's important to note that I had moved off of the small island (in 4th grade) that we lived on on the east coast to a rural, farming town on the mainland. We would regularly email, text, and instant message one another to just kind of keep in touch.\n\nUnfortunately, due to her skipping a year, we grew apart. I would try talking to her, but she would either be preoccupied with her new friends, or was focused on this boy she liked at the time (who ended up being a total asshole, like I told her time and time again based on the behaviors he was exhibiting toward her).\n\nEventually, I got fed up with her lack of responses after years and years of friendship (we had met in Kindergarten, and then at the age of 16, this all happened). I wasn't opposed to her making new friends; that's great in and of itself. I was opposed to her completely neglecting to shoot me an email maybe once a week or so because she was busy with her new friends.\n\nI felt pretty dumped, one could say. Eventually, we just stopped talking to each other until she started applying to colleges (a year before me). Then I applied to college a year later. Our freshman year she tried picking it back up again (however, it didn't last long). It was clear that she was struggling with some kind of eating disorder, and all of this pent up anger and resentment kind of boiled over.\n\nI gave her some hard love that night and told her that this vegan diet that she was on was *L I T E R A L L Y* killing her. Her skeleton was showing when she would wear anything that even remotely revealed skin. She got kind of defensive, but ended up going to therapy and getting better.\n\nWe didn't talk much throughout freshman or sophomore year (sophomore and junior year for her). She told me about her boyfriend that she had either around last semester of this year/my senior year, or second semester junior year (she graduated last year), and how he was being emotionally manipulative and abusive towards her. How he would have erratic fits of anger, and she didn't know what to do.\n\nKnowing the signs of bad relationships (although I have never been in a relationship myself, I do know what bad ones look like after having been around multiple people who have been involved in one), I told her she should leave him. He's causing her emotional trauma, and stress. Eventually, she did just that, and has found herself feeling much more happy and at ease than she did when she was with her ex.\n\nAlthough we don't talk really all that much anymore because of the whole spiel in high school, she occasionally texts me every now and again. Unfortunately, I don't think it'll ever get to that level of closeness again simply because I felt a bit like I had been dumped and replaced. I'm not sure if this is petty to an unbiased, totally outside source, but I feel it was at least somewhat justified.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425538481", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

One lasted over 300k (my brother totaled it), but it also had 2 transmissions go out. My other Accord had so many problems that I was glad when the ECU finally died at only 150k.

{"body": "I cant find a copy of this song on youtube but I can think of a few ways to practice artculation styles and and tone quality. First make sure your not pinching your sound off keep thd back of your throat as open as possible. I usually tell my students to think about having a golf ball in their mouth and not letting the roof of your mouth touch it. Obviously dont strain yourself. \n\nIts super hard to diagnose and fix without having any idea what you sound like. Lets start with practicing tongueless attacks. What you want to do is start on a note, I usually start with a simple B above the staff and move down chromatically. You will play the rhythm short short long. (Quarter- Quarter - dotted half) B - B - B(dot), Bb - Bb - Bb etc. what your going to do is drop you jaw and reset your embouchure between each note and articulate with your air stream. It sounds funny because we are told to tongue everything. But for this exercise you will find will have several different applications correcting any tightness you might have. \n\nThe second kind of cookie cutter technique that is just good to practice in general is playing notes while using a different vowel sound. So start with one pitch and on half notes (articulating with your tounge this time) play it Ahh (short a sound), Eee, Ahh, Oh, Ooo. This forces you to arch your mouth in different ways, while teaching control of embouchure, and function of the air stream in your mouth. Another technique along these lines Is to play a major triad starting at the bottom Ahh, Ooo, Ooo, and endinf on Ahh then reverse Ooo, ahh, ahh, ooo (those are short a sounds)  you can do this several octaves arppegiated just make sure your consistant in beginning and ending with the same vowel. If you dont know your major triads start with going up F(Ahh) A C(ooo) and down C A F. Then add another octave F (Ooo) A C F A C (all ahhs)  then down C A F C A F (Ooo).\n\nThose are 2 cookie cutter exercises that might help you produce the bouncyness she is looking for because you are learning to manipulate air stream, your entire jaw and embouchure to produce different sounds. Besides you can only benefit from them. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425568998", "subreddit": "Flute", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Trust isn't the core of the issue, although it is pertinent, in my mind, and the way we were taught at OBC/AC and in a few of the other courses I attended, \"effective unit cohesion\" and \"good order and discipline\" was the core of it.  \n\nTroops spend way more time together than any other form of public servant, so more intimate details are shared as part of course, so appropriateness of action is much more vital. \n\nWhile a public servant in any other role is substantially more capable of keeping their private life private, and could lead a very different lifestyle outside of work. \n\nThat being said, you're not exactly correct in your translation of Article 134.  Adultery -the act- isn't the issue in the article. \n\nThe specific statute is \"Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special, or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.\" \n\nThe act is an element.  \"To constitute an offense under the U C M J , the adulterous conduct must be directly prejudicial to good order and discipline or service  discrediting.  Adulterous conduct that is directly prejudicial includes conduct that has an obvious, and measurably divisive effect on unit or organization discipline, morale, or cohesion , or is clearly detrimental to the authority or stature of or respect toward a servicemember. Adultery may also be service discrediting, even though the conduct is only indirectly or remotely prejudicial to good order and discipline. Discredit means to injure the reputation of the armed forces and includes adulterous conduct that has a tendency, because of its open or notorious nature, to bring the service into disrepute, make it subject to public ridicule, or lower it in public esteem. While adulterous conduct that is private and discreet in nature may not be service discrediting by this standard, under the circumstances, it may be determined to be conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. Commanders should consider all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to the following factors, when determining whether adulterous acts are prejudicial to good order and discipline or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces:\"\n\nSource: all my quotes came from http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/mcm.pdf ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425574813", "subreddit": "technology", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I like Haskell as much as the next guy (maybe even more), but how is this \"solved\" in functional programming?  I wouldn't consider it unconventional to have code like\n\n    f = do\n        forM_ [1..10] $ \\i -&gt;\n            forM_ [i..20] $ \\j -&gt;\n                print $ i + j\n\nAlthough I admit that I would rather see it implemented as a list comprehension:\n\n    f = mapM_ print [i + j | i &lt;- [1..10], j &lt;- [i..20]]\n\nOr even\n\n    f = mapM_ print $ do\n        i &lt;- [1..10]\n        j &lt;- [i..20]\n        return $ i + j\n\nBut in all three of these cases you still have poorly named variables.  In Haskell I'd say it's a lot more common to see single-letter variable names, or single letters with `'` or `_` stuck on the end.  For example, I'll grab the popular [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.7/docs/Control-Lens-Lens.html) library, and point you at the description provided underneath `type Lens s t a b = ...`.  In that entire block all variables that aren't defined as functions somewhere are single letters.  I'm not saying that the lens library is bad, /u/edwardkmett writes some of the best documented code in the community, but it's a very quick example of how Haskell almost encourages short, nondescript variable names.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425613223", "subreddit": "ProgrammerHumor", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thanks, I didn't know that Java would automatically optimize chained calls like that.  I think the term for that is lazy evaluation?  This works great for a single list.  However, is there a general solution for n-level loops?  For example, here is a two level list:\n\n    //Using Guava library\n    List&lt;List&lt;Supplier&lt;String&gt;&gt;&gt; list = Lists.newArrayList();\n    list.add(Lists.newArrayList(() -&gt; {out.println(\"a\"); return \"a\";}, () -&gt; {out.println(\"b\"); return \"b\";}, () -&gt; {out.println(\"c\"); return \"c\";}));\n    list.add(Lists.newArrayList(() -&gt; {out.println(\"d\"); return \"d\";}, () -&gt; {out.println(\"e\"); return \"e\";}, () -&gt; {out.println(\"f\"); return \"f\";}));\n    list.add(Lists.newArrayList(() -&gt; {out.println(\"g\"); return \"g\";}, () -&gt; {out.println(\"h\"); return \"h\";}, () -&gt; {out.println(\"i\"); return \"i\";}));\n\nIf I use for loops such as this:\n\n    String containsE = \"\";\n    for (List&lt;Supplier&lt;String&gt;&gt; list2 : list) {\n        for (Supplier&lt;String&gt; s : list2) {\n            if (s.get().contains(\"e\")) {\n                containsE = s.get();\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (!containsE.isEmpty()) {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\nThe output is \"a b c d e e\"\n\nIf I try a functional style:\n\n    String containsE = list.stream().flatMap(l -&gt; l.stream()).filter(s -&gt; s.get().contains(\"e\")).findFirst().orElse(() -&gt; \"none\").get();\n\nThe output is \"a b c d e f e\"\n\nWhich shows that it looped to the end of the second list.  I'm guessing that the flatMap() is forcing an evaluation of all members of the second list.  Is there another way to do this to get the same behavior as the iterative approach? \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425619776", "subreddit": "javahelp", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "*Seattle, Redmond. SE 23rd Pl., \"No Such Apartments,\" Apartment \"G\". . .*\n\nThe room was cramped- near barren. After a little over two weeks since the occupant had moved in, there'd yet to be a personal touch- even a sign of habitation. There was the beaten couch; the mattress on the floor. Cupboard overtop a soyprocessor and meager kitchen accessories; minifridge set into the wall. A faint smell of isopropyl alcohol; bleach as well. It may have been occupied- but the room was not lived in. Within the room, all was silent and still. If anyone seemed to live there, they did only that- live.\n\nThe dead quiet was interrupted- a scraping was heard from near the door. The doorknob jiggled as a key was inserted. The deadbolt- built into joins that passed through the frame, where door and concrete intersected and a metal bar slipped between- lifted. A Savalette peered through the slowly widening gap, scanning the room- then the door was pushed open fully, and Lawrence entered, dragging behind him a piece of what appeared to be a rough piece of plastiboard with some assorted nails in it.\n\nAfter (fully) locking and resetting the alarm on the door, Lawrence continued to drag the plasterboard through. He stared at a wall opposite the card table and folding chairs- recently cleaned of trash, though still bearing nic-stick burns- and began lifting and moving the plastiboard over to it. Flipping it end over end, the jagged, irregularly shaped trash was eventually settled to the satisfaction of the occupant against the wall, and he backed away, looking at it. \n\nHe quietly rearranged nails about the 'top' of the jagged surface, and began placing objects about it. A box of twenty crayons. Paintbrush. Washcloth. A couple packs of sticky notes. A pencil. Thread. The assortment grew, until Lawrence stepped back, nodding. \n\nWalking over to sit at the card table, Lawrence shucked his Ulysses coat, then a two-way webbing vest laden with ammo. Finally, as he neared his seat, he removed his gun belt and rolled up his sleeves on his Berwick.\n\nHe rest his black, skeletal metal and myomeric-muscle corded arms on the table. Palms flat down.  And stared blankly across, electric blue eyes gleaming in the overhead light.\n\nThe flourescent tubes hummed in the ceiling.\n\n\"RenSen,\" he said evenly, still staring ahead, blinking thin, wind-tanned eyelids over eyes so well designed you could swear they were somehow *too real*. \"Voice memo recording.\" He waited for a halfsecond, then as his earbuds chirped, he began.\n\n\"Date: Twenty-Seventy Six. March. Sixth. Name: Spite. Position: Criminal. Date of reference- Fourth, autofill 'rest. Parties Involved: Blue Force- StuntExtra, Bishop, Spite. OpFor - Seattle Gang: Cutters. Mr. Johnson: Damien Wright, club owner, Golden Fleece. Date of Incident: Fourth to Fifth, autofill 'rest. Type of incident: Rescue/Kidnapping- Extraction, [The Golden Birdcage Case.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RunnerHub/comments/2xat3b/job_golden_birdcage_20150303_2000_americanew_york/) Begin Body.\n\n\"Met and identified Johnson. Requested we return his elven wife to him. Pay was to be twelve grand nuyen each, with a bonus- later found to be four grand- if job was completed to an above satisfactory standard, parameters stealthily extracting wife, Chloe Wright, without alarming the captors- the Cutters.\n\n\"Called associate. Was given information that there was heavier than usual security at one of the Cutter's business fronts, a dockyard. Asked to be kept posted if at all possible. Met with associate of 'Mr. Johnson' next day. Received datachips of four possible locations- maps. Three dockyards, one apartment complex. The group decided to hit the apartment complex first, despite my admittedly not terribly strenuous objections.\n\n\"I was mostly there as a contingency. StuntExtra performed. . . above average in his social infiltration. Flyspy in the HVAC courtesy Bishop was also helpful. Sub-memo: Look into acquiring a flyspy yourself, too handy not to have as Bishop demonstrated.\n\n\"A dress was found in a room that was cross-referenced with the associate of J's and found to indeed be an article of Chloe's wardrobe. Having explored every room under control of the gangers, we made haste to the docks. I set up in overwatch a block across with the help of Stunt and a fire escape, and waited with my Desert Strike.\n\n\"Social infiltration once again made the day. I provided image link surveillance from above, the flyspy was deliberately pointed out and became part of a confidence scheme where the Knights were said to be en route to a no-knock raid on the premises. The gangers were eventually convinced, and the wife was revealed to be with the Lieutenant of the Cutters on site, about to escape via boat.\n\n\"With admirable coordination, the Flyspy was landed on the boat, and a ganger tricked to swing on the boat near the engine block just as I placed a silenced shot directly -into- the engine block via Desert Strike loaded with APDS. One shot, over the dockyard warehouse, in one side, through the engine block, out the other, and into the water- just as the ork ganger hit the boat, demolishing the Flyspy.\n\n\"The Lieutenant was satisfied that there was no foul play aside from metahuman incompetence, and summarily executed the ganger. The wife was taken by StuntExtra to 'the rendezvous' for the gangers- which was substituted with our own rendezvous. We soon noticed the woman had appeared to no longer be an elf- through surgical alteration or other means is unknown. The wife revealed she was in love with the Lieutenant, and her husband was 'a jerk'- implicating the money, power, prestige, and the ownership of the club had gotten to the man. The wife staged her own extraction by the gangers, and left willingly.\n\n\"It was decided that we would still return the woman to complete our mission as promised- however, nothing was preventing us from offering our services once more to a different Johnson- the wife, in concern of her third extraction, back into the hands of her 'true love'.\"\n\nGiving a flat, ever-so-faintly bemused look to the opposite wall, Spite spreads his hands.\n\n\". . . For a modest fee. I may be a criminal, but nothing has stopped me from maintaining a professional demeanor and business etiquette.\"\n\nHe cracks his neck, feeling his neck move a little -too- smoothly from the augmentations he'd undergone, and flexes his spindly, black, metallic fingers for a moment- then rests them flat on the table.\n\nHe stands, taking off his dress shirt and drapes it over the chair. As he turns, a riot of discoloration and lines move across his toned chest- lichtenstein scars, purple and pink blotches, and faint, hard to make out scarring in jagged lines crisscross his chest, radiating from one shoulder to another, across his heart- from one augmented arm to the other.\n\nLawrence quietly takes a pad of sticky notes and pencil, and looks at the buffed and shined plastiboard. He could see his reflection, and the words cut months ago into his chest- RETURNED TO SENDER- clear as could be in the plastiboard. He placed a sticky note over the reflection of the words, and writes, in all capital letters-\n\nK N I G H T   E R R A N T\n\n-before circling it repeatedly, the pencil digging into the paper, leaving grooves.\n\nAs he began to arrange other sticky notes and took the spool of thread, he nodded to himself, smiling faintly as more and more of his reflection disappeared behind the plastiboard. \n\n\"End Recording,\" he says, before posting something bearing the words 'PART ONE: JUSTICE - HERO/MESSIAH' over where his mouth was reflected, leaving his cool, electric blue eyes looking back as he connected the threads.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425635905", "subreddit": "RunnerHub", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Since then I have searched further as well and have a few more to add to the list (all of the music is on Spotify):\n\n* [Alessandro Parisi](https://alessandroparisi.bandcamp.com/): Dark, dark rhythm based stuff. I immediately fell for his music. Especially the track \"La Guerra di Namtar\".\n\n* [Antoni Maiovvi](https://maiovvi.bandcamp.com/): Not all his stuff stuck with me, but his latest album Avrokosm is really great. \n\n* [Chainless](https://soundcloud.com/chainless): Probably mentioned him last friday as he has been on my playlist for some time. But I didn't pay much attention to him until this week and I have been blasting his album \"Grey Veils\" on repeat. It's heavy stuff, very rhythmic with crisp vocal samples.\n\n* [Phantom Love](https://www.facebook.com/pages/PHANTOM-LOVE/352009411575213): Self-described as \"obscure electro\" and I'm inclined to agree. I haven't listened too much to her during the week, but I will.\n\n* Tesla Sonic (No link): Probably closer to the band that inspires me the most: S U R V I V E. And that's a good thing. Rhythm, distinct bass and sweet melodies. The only thing I don't like are the vocal samples, but they are rare.\n\n* [Vortex Rikers](https://vortexrikers.bandcamp.com/): I've known about them for quite a while, but didn't give them a listen until this week. Much like the other stuff mentioned, it's dark and rhythm based. That's what I'm looking for and Vortex Rikers does it really well.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425666328", "subreddit": "synthesizers", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A regular for loop would look something like this\n\n    for i in range(n): # you can also use xrange(n)\n        # do stuff\n\nThe range and xrange method can take in 3 arguments. Start, Stop and Step. (`range(start, stop, step)`) If the start argument is omitted it will default to 0, and if the step argument is omitted it will default to 1, but you always need to give a stop value.\n\nAlso remember that the range method creates a list that goes up to but not including the stop argument. So `range(4)` would be `[0,1,2,3]`\n\nYou can iterate through pretty much anything. Examples:\n\n    #strings\n    for i in \"Hello World\":\n        print i, # if you add a comma at the end of a print it won't make a new line\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; H e l l o  W o r l d\n\n(I will use triple arrows to show what it outputs)\n\nAnother example would be arrays:\n\n    list = [1,1,2,3,5,8]\n    for numbers in list:\n        print numbers, \n    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 1 2 3 5 8\n \nDictionaries (map)\n  \n    d = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'berry', 'c': 'cherry'}\n    for key in d:\n        print key, d[key]\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; a apple\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; b berry\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; c cherry\n\nYou can also use multiple variables like this\n\n\n    choices = ['pizza', 'pasta', 'salad', 'nachos']\n\n    print 'Your choices are:'\n    for index, item in enumerate(choices):\n        print index+1, item\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 pizza\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 pasta\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 salad\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; 4 nachos\n\nThe cool thing is that you can use **for / else** loops.\nThe else statement is executed after the for, but only if the for ends normally—that is, not with a break.\n\n    fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'tomato', 'pear', 'grape']\n\n    print 'You have...'\n    for f in fruits:\n        if f == 'tomato':\n            print 'A tomato is not a fruit!' # (It actually is.)\n            break\n        print 'A', f\n    else:\n        print 'A fine selection of fruits!'\n\nThis code will break when it hits 'tomato', so the else block won't be executed.\n\nAnyways, if you are using python 2, I recommend you check out this link https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range\n\nIf you are using python 3, check this one out instead: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425685063", "subreddit": "learnpython", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

So everyone forgets about her torturing her own mother 24-7! She either screwed, manipulated, drugged, humiliated the liars from day one, and after her fake death and all that bs pretty much destroyed Emily the one she cared the\" most\" about, not to mention what went down with Maya whom Alison sent to rosewood and what happened Emily came out as gay finally being able to try and move on and closure bout Ali, &amp; fell deep in love with her after her first love just teased and made fun of her, messing with Emily's feelings knowing how she felt and what happens Maya\" died\" and why? Bc Alison Again, she toyed and blackmailed and went behind EVERYONES BACK even her own family, the spoiled Bitch made a special trip to GA JUST TO GET HER OWN BROTHER CUT OUT OF THE WILL KNOWING SHE WAS FAKING HER DEATH AND KNOWING SHE COULD OF PIT HER OWN BROTHER IN JAIL, but yeah Allison's just a Angel, all hail the one Bitch that didn't give a damn about anyone but herself whether she's guilty or not I think after coming back. Making all these promises to the girls about telling the police what really happened to get it all over with so things wouldn't end up like they are NOW but the text, screw the text you just screwed over the four people who have been through hell everyday bc of her, she broke Arias Family up, she broke Bethanys family up, she broke her OWN FAMILY UP, since she has been back She hasn't attempted to work with the girls, she hasn't attempted to be honest even once, the ONLY thing she has done/proven is that she's a liar, all those plots with noel/Cyrus/CeCe etc it never mattered to her what Emily or the others said or what she told them she was gonna do, cuz the whole time it was a lie she had absolutely no intention on sticking together/not turning on each other, no intention of being honest in any way, every little plot and decision she makes 95% ends up with her SCREWING THE LIARS over more not giving a damn what happens to them, just gambling with her\" best friends/lover Emily. Lives but all of PLL seems to forget why the four liars are the way they are, and why they do some of the things they've done, bc of all Alisons lies schemes blackmailing, manipulation torturing bullying these stupid stunts with Cyrus and Noel, oh let's not forget the frat party that she shoved a drunk girl down the stairs for NO REASONS EXCEPT SHES A JEOULOUS B*TCH THAT DOESNT CARE BOIT NOOME BUT HERSELF  as long as it helps her, let's see oh Blinding Jenna blackmailing Toby to take the rap and spent a year in juvie for something HE DIDN'T DO! But oh no when the four people who continuously was always there for her after all the bs she has caused just since she came backthe backstabbing self centered Bitch doesn't have the guts to do what's right or to stop lying,  tearing every one down that much more with every breath/step it takes!\nSo okay cry me a river about Alison spending a little time in jail, first lemme guess\" she's innocent, she didn't deserve it, how could the liars do that to her)  simple if anyone was in aria, Han, Em, or Spencer's shoes with all she did before/during &amp; after her friendships fake death and coming back and every corner she never stopped her little plots, lies, backstabbing everyone who has EVER done anything for her, she's horrible and mental and after Mona and her inappropriate gestures some stuff may have been planted that the liars found but that with everything else she done how can anyone blame the liars and with what she did to toby, she NEEDED to be there and see how it feels having no control, everything scheduled and in order, it's almost like the last attempt to get Alison to open her eyes and be shown how awful she treats people and a last attempt to get it through her head that if she DOESN'T CHANGE she will either end up DEAD or SPEND HER LIFE IN JAIL what bugs me the most is how much hype there is bout the liars and Alison being in jail, like what about toby? That was all Alison 100% he didn't do any damn thing he was being raped by his step-sister then Ali and the stink bomb that blinded Jenna, and forcing Toby to take the rap and he Got a YEAR. for that but no one cares about that shit, and she will be out next episode in PLL world she definitely hasn't been there anywhere close to a year, uh I think she's exactly where she needed to be, oh yeah something I'd like to quote from apparently. \"Arias The Devil Bashers\" [\"She's In Here bc of KARMA\"] and all of PLL bashing her for actually stating the truth and no longer scared to stand up to her, and the Mike thing I agree with Aria Alison would be the biggest cunt if she was to rat out Mike bc everything with Mona and the liars has been caused bc of her if not for Alison being back Mona would be alive and wouldn't of had to done what she has, if she's willing to backstab Aria again and put her brother's life in danger shed be as low as you could get ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1425808567", "subreddit": "PrettyLittleLiars", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I also strongly recommend that you make /target arena 1 2 3 macros as well as /focus 1 2 3 macros. you also can throw in /fear 1 2 3  and /fear @focus. all of these are basically required macros. I also have /axe toss @arena 1/2/3/Focus\n\nmake sure you are keybinding to everything possible. I recommend doing BGs until you get the hang and muscle memory of all your binds. The more buttons your mouse has is better. I personally bind Demonic leap to mouse Wheel up and corruption to mouse wheel down and Demonic gateway to Mouse wheel press (M3).\n\nMake sure you are binding to q e r t g f c z x v 1-5 (sometimes 6 or 7)and a lot of people unbind their S key as well. and then you have shift variants, alt variants, and control variants of all those keys. as well as f1 f2 f3 f4 and things like that.\n\nKeybind EVERYTHING that you will be using, do not click on anything on the screen really to cast spells. I also suggest using the addon named Gladius. as a limp CD opener with Dark Soul glyphed you can pop dark soul as well as imp swarm with corruption, use a Hand of Gul, use Metamorph, apply curse to everything, then apply Chaos Wave if you have leftover fury. your main goal as a demo lock is to maintain control on the enemy team and pool 800+ demonic fury to burst with. you will want to wait to get a full fear no trinket on the enemy healer and then blow Dark Soul + imp swarm + damage trinket(if human) or wait for your Surge of Dominance procs. Once this is all good you want to cast 4 demonbolts + chaos Waves with remaining fury and anything else for the brust is Soulfire or ToD. Demonology warlocks are really ment for ranged and spellcasting teams such as LSD or MLS. \n\nFocus on working on those things as well as making sure to check your positioning and Line of Sight various CC effects if possible. first focus on your burst in the lower end of the Arena bracket and as you start working your way up to 2k+ you will want to focus on Chaining CC together with someone as well as positioning.

{"body": "No worries.\n\nThe idea behind most open tunings is the tune them into a chord - when all the stings are played open i tharmonizes in some way. If you look at a D chord in standard you'll see that it has the notes D A D F#. One of the more common alternate tunnigs is what the old guys call Vestapol but nowdays is called open D. The strings from fattest to thinest are tuned D A D F# A D. It was more common pre 60s but guys like Jack White use them a lot - especially with slide.\n\nA g chord in standard uses the notes G B D G B G and Spanish or open G tuning is D G D G B D. This is great for finger picking because you can use your thumb to bounce between the two ones Ds and 2 open Gs. This was used a bit on old blues, the Rolling Stones used it more than they used standard, and some of Led Zeps acoustic stuff uses it - Kashmir uses a very similar tuning. \n\nI tend to leave the guitar in a tuning for a few weeks before changing it back, and I change my strings every few months so I've never really noticed a tuning issue swapping between them. Most of the common tunings go down from standard, so there's not as much tension in the strings. Not sure what that means for staying it tune but it usually allows you to play with a softer touch.

I usually start on bot side for a better leash, but if top lane is too hard to gank for early on you can start top side and work your way down to bot.\n\nFor farming (R W R E) you can do gromp-&gt;blue-&gt;wolves-&gt;red-&gt;raptor+minigolem\n\nGenerally you want to hold flash until they either flash or are in kill range (meaning a stun + q auto will kill them) so you don't waste it. If they flash and you have kill potential, I would flash for it. If you're ganking say a corki and he w's away then I wouldn't waste flash unless he's in kill range.\n\nIf you don't have flash up then generally it's not a great idea to be in the enemy jungle.\n\nYou can check the builds/skill orders/replays of players using the builds I talked about on OP.GG.

{"body": "Hades is one of easiest gods in game but k.\n\n\nFirst thing, NEVER play Hades as tank in conquest (be tanky in arena, assault if you don't have other guardians). Your passive is cool, your abilities do some extra effects. Your 1 can be used as escape (remember, it can go through walls) or you can go in by using it. It slows your enemies if you hitted them (I hope I remember right). Your 2 is cool silence, enemies can't use any abilities for x seconds. Apply your passive to fear yoir enemies (I love this cc so much) - if feared, they're silenced + they lost control on their god. Also, applies your passive. Your 3 is simply A M A Z I N G. Strong heal (you can heal your allies too, remember about it. It does shitton of dmg too. Your ult is group hug, friendship circle, however you want to call it. By \"group hug\" you can guess how it works. Also, you're cc immune while casting ult and you get some protections. If your passive is applied, your enemies lost some of their protections.\n\n\nSo, conquest. Hades' role, build... He's played on solo lane as pure mage or magical bruiser. I always start with vampiric and sash tier 1, lvl up your 3, then 2, then 4, than 1. You may ask, why 2 over 1? I already said, I LOVE silence/fear, they can't escape me when I use my 2. Also, I use my 1 as escape, lower lvl = less mana needed. I build vampiric - sash - cdr boots - phys/magical def item (depends on enemy) - divine ruin if I play vs healers, talon if not - valor - tahuti.\n\n\nWell, I hope it helped you a bit. I can't check what his 1 does when passive is applied, I'm on my phone, you have to look at it by yourself.

{"body": "They took PREPARE TO DIE XD too literal. They tried to be as punishing as DaS 1 but made most of the difficulty of the game artificial. \n\n\nI've played and loved DaS 1 to bits for months now, and I just can't get into DaS 2. I absolutely love the 60 fps, but it doesn't make up for how everything else works. Varying rolls? I'm not even sure if this is as big of an issue as I feel it is, or if it's just because -e v e r y t h i n g- tracks you. It's not as bad later on in the game, but those spear hollows in the start of the game manage to more than demotivate me. There's no point at which I feel confident and strong enough to simply run around and backstab monsters. Always approaching with shield up first. \n\n\nSure, being able to roll from inside fire to inside fire, and somehow survive without taking damage is unrealistic, but it's a trustworthy mechanic. If you got timing you can manage to perfect most bosses. DaS 2? A dodge can easily be useless if you miss those few extra frames stats would give you. Again, maybe not a big problem but considering everything tracks you, it feels that way. I love how armor looks. I love how many bonfires there are, but it certainly feels like a baby's first souls game. \n\n\n\nDaS 2 has the better builds and better magic system, but DaS 1 has everything else. Not to mention for some reason it's like walking in mud. For a game built on raw skill, timing and rolls, it really has nothing of the sort. Rolls? Those extra frames vary. Movement? In my case i had to get a dead-zone fix for my controller, and it still feels [horrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYhRoBV-VeM).

{"body": "**4-man team = Asari** \n\nI was playing a Platinum match on Dagger and my buddies and I all decided to be Asari. Biotic Explosions E v e r y w h e r e. One of our guys got picked up by Banshees not once, not twice, but four times and every time we biotic explosioned him free. It was a slaughter.\n\n**2-man team = GI Melee build &amp; Volus shield booster** (Awesome for Platinum)\n\nThis 2 man team is Gandalf and Bilbo going into the horde of orcs and killing every last thing. Gandalf Geth wrecks them and Bil-volus Baggins shield boosts him every step away. Forget the other team, the Volus stays with the Geth. My buddy loves this combo, he's DAYUMN good at the Geth Melee Build and I'm a good volus following him like he's Frodo and I'm Samwise Gamgee. Yes, I abandoned the rest of the team to die. At the end of one our Adventures beyond the Shire, **He had 314,267 points** while the other 2 had maybe a little over 100,000 points. I had maybe around 20,000 (proximity mine and a hurricane).  \n(*Note: The GI melee build + Volus is very straining on the volus player. The flashing of lights at that level may cause epileptic seizures due to the amount of flashing lights and I would not advised playing this 2-man combo too often. I can only play it maybe once a session of playing. It's too headache inducing*.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426013230", "subreddit": "MECoOp", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I hear Charge attack is the better way to loop. I'd say reserve that knowledge of roll + upswing because imo it's good for tight spaces and concentrated slashing.\n\nThe most efficient way to SnS is to keep hitting, keep hitting, keep hitting. The other, just as efficient, is Stylish Bombing (look it up). SB is now easier to do with the charge attack I hear, R+X for a quick upswing then Back + A for the charge, and getting you out of the explosion. Still not as fast as X + Evade 2 but it works on a budget.\n\nDon't discount the A combo as well, going X X X A A before \"resetting\" your combo (via roll or charged attack) would give you a good dps going. All-in-all, the idea still boils down to keep attacking. You have good animation swings to roll out/into monster's attacks and you might actually want to master that, Evade 0 or not.\n\nYou can also take advantage of not needing to sheath to use items, make sure you always have Might Seeds for slicing deep wounds into your target. Might Pill is also as good, but its duration leaves little to be desired. IIRC, using an item actually counts as part of a \"combo\", meaning you can chain into, and chain out of, item usage. If not, at least you can chain into it. (allowing you to do the X+A lunge, pop a Might Pill in a very good position, then wail on some monster's part)\n\nSnS is also third to the IG and Lance on being able to mount monsters. X+A up the ledge makes you go into a jump attack, a beautiful way to get some air (and potentially dodge something, I've done so) and mount damage in.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426044066", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

But lets be careful not to conflate 2 scenarios - one where person B is threatened and one where he is not. If B is not threatened, then it is assumed that every action he takes is indeed 'selfish'.\n\nYou cannot threaten people if they are always acting from self interest. Indeed, there cannot be any self interest without there being something else which isn't self interest or the concept wouldn't make any sense.\n\n&gt;The evidence is the subjective theory of value and praxeology, the study of human interactions.\n\nNo mate, I'm looking for *actual evidence not theories*. Stop circle jerking.\n\n&gt;No, what you have is incomplete information on what they subjectively value. If you were them with their values, then you would act in the same manner (again, assuming that we are talking about the 'not threatened' situation). \n\nIt's up to you to ptove that they are not being selfless, the prima facie evidence is of selflessness. It's incredib;ly hard to argue that someone who (to take an example) sets themselves on fire in the hope of ending a war is operating from self interest. If for no other reason that this ends their self.\n\nIf you can prove it, crack on though.\n\n&gt;The other possibility is that you claim to know better than 'all manner of people' what they value... which is quite provably false.\n\nFalse dichotomy.\n\n&gt;For example, I'm one of the set of 'all manner of people' - tell me something that I value (outside of generic stuff like healthy / happy / food in my belly). You claim my actions are opposed to my self interest - tell me my self interest so that you may judge my actions against them.\n\nNo idea.

{"body": "&gt; You cannot threaten people if they are always acting from self interest. Indeed, there cannot be any self interest without there being something else which isn't self interest or the concept wouldn't make any sense.\n\nWhat are you smoking and where can I get some?\n\n&gt;No mate, I'm looking for actual evidence not theories. Stop circle jerking.\n\nI freely admit that I can't read other people's minds.  The best I can assume is that they act in their own interest - as I act in mine and as you act in yours.  This isn't a circle jerk - this is logic 101.\n\n&gt;It's incredib;ly hard to argue that someone who (to take an example) sets themselves on fire in the hope of ending a war is operating from self interest.\n\nNo - you just did it in the statement.  Their self interest = 'hope of ending a war' - and they set themselves on fire to do so.  They valued the 'hope of ending a war' over 'living'.  Do I agree with them in their evaluation?  No (or else I would do the same) - but logic tells us that they did what they did because that is what they valued.  Maybe they valued not living more than living in a world with this war going on.  I don't know - and neither do you. \n\n&gt;No idea. Can't know and no one else can either - which is why it's really fucking weird you know that people are always operating from self interest even when they are provably acting against their own interests.\n\nSo let me get this straight - you say that you don't know anyone else's self interest, but can prove they are acting against it?  Right... logic fail.  Until you get over that hurdle I don't think we can continue having productive conversation.  \n\n&gt;I'm looking at selfless actions and concluding that they must have selfless intent.\n\nNo, you are claiming 'selfless actions' exist by disregarding intangible selfish reasons.  Perhaps this is a misunderstanding on your part of the word 'selfish'.  You apply a negative connotation to it where none is warranted - while also disregarding intangible motivations.  \n\n&gt;You are the one claiming that despite the evidence theres some secret mind reading power you've got (which you won't prove, mind you) which means the evidence is wrong.\nSo then - E V I D E N C E - do you have any?\n\nI've never claimed the ability to read minds - stop with the projection.  I assume that people act because they want to with their own intentions stemming from their own desires and values.  As soon as they do so, they can be said to be acting 'selfishly' because it is their sense of self that drives their actions.  \n\nIn common parlance we use words like 'selfless', but they don't mean anything.  You have yourself and you interact with the world.  Everything you do is selfish - originating from the self and done in accordance with your own values and desires (good or bad, moral or immoral).\n\nThis isn't something that there is evidence for or against.  It is a branch of praxeology and logic.  You can't divorce your intentions from yourself - that's nonsense.  Things that stem from yourself are selfish - that's logic.  It follows that your intentions are selfish. Good, bad, moral, immoral, wrong, right - doesn't matter - all selfish.\n\nStop being obtuse and fix your logic.  I'm done here.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426097477", "subreddit": "Anarcho_Capitalism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

[If you look on a piano](http://i.imgur.com/4eczvas.jpg), you'll see white keys and black keys; the white ones are the letters, and the black ones are in between, so the one in between D and E can be D# (D sharp) or Eb (E flat). They repeat on and on in either direction, but if you play A B C D E F G, the notes will get higher as you go (although if you wanted, you could play A, and then go down 7 notes to play a lower B, and down 7 notes to play a lower C, etc.).\n\nWhy do some guitar chords only have one letter as their name? That's just shorthand for a major chord. So you might have a C, which is C major. This uses the 1st, 3rd, and 5th note from the C major scale, which happen to be C, E and G. There's other \"C\" chords, like C minor, which is C, Eb and G. The \"C\" in this case is the root note, so it's sort of the \"home\" of the chord.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426129462", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;So if Gine's good nature rubbed off on him because she cared for him that basically fits the criteria you've laid out. \n\nThat's the contradiction. Goku in Dragon Ball prior to hitting his head showed no good nature whatsoever. It is stated that that head trauma and the fact that Grandpa Gohan was so compassionate with him is what changed Goku's nature/hard-wiring.\n\nNow we find it was actually Gine behind Goku's change in nature when it was strictly stated that if was the trauma + Gohan.\n\nYou can't say Gine's nature rubbed off on him to the point that it *made it possible* for Goku to undergo such drastic change in Nature, since such thing isn't needed in a Saiyan in the first place in order to change their nature. Perfect example is Vegeta, and how he eventually changed his nature from \"evil\" to pure-heart.\n\nYou also can't rationalize Vegeta had a Gine-like mother because that isn't officially explain and would be only speculation. \n\nPlus it is strictly stated Saiyans from that era are stated to ALL be ruthless killing machines. hence what makes Goku's story so special.\n\n\n&gt;Goku still could have killed everyone. Gine used to kill people, but it's the fact Gohan showed how great humanity can be made Goku like them. It wasn't just he was reprogrammed, but that he was shown that there were other kind people out there other than his parents.\n\nGoku had no idea other people existed, or at least knew other people's nature, before he met Bulma. Kid was extremely sheltered and ignorant. So that doesn't add up at all. And besides, vast majority of the people he met were evil and selfish in some way. In fact, 99/100 people Goku knew were like that in Dragon Ball lol.\n\n&gt;And if the Tights situation hasn't been explained how can it be a plot hole? \n\nBecause as of right now, it creates an inconsistency/discrepancies that are never officially explained. \n\nAt the end of Jaco and at the very beginning of Dragon Ball, Tights eventually settles on the island along with Omori and Katayude. Ten years after parting ways with her friends, in Age 749, her sister Bulma pays her a visit on the island for a temporary reunion and reveals that she is searching for a set of seven orbs with mysterious properties, which may be extraterrestrial in nature.\n\nSo in the Boo saga, Tights is on earth and Bulma doesn't care about her older sister's safety. She dies in the Boo saga with no concern from Bulma and her parents... and after being \"revived,\" she also was not invited to her sister's birthday 3 years later.\n\nInconsistencies/discrepancies that are never  O F F I C I A L L Y explained. Thus, plot hole.\n\n&gt;They haven't said anything to contradict it. We just know that Bulma has an older sister. There hasn't been anything that contradicts the idea of Tights because there hasn't been much said.\n\nNo need to state anything, the events are what cause inconsistencies/discrepancies.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426129799", "subreddit": "dbz", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "First I am also interested in the capacitor across the output.  I would have expected to see such a cap across the 12 V power supply.  Is that a stock design?\n\nSome other things.\n\nOften times with Power FET transistors running in a switched mode operation the heat is in the transients as you turn the transistor on and off the voltage transitions from high voltage to low voltage while the current transitions from a low current to a high voltage.  This gives you a pulse of power that is given by I x V for the waveform.  To hold my thumb up this is on the order of \n\nP = Fo x I x V x deltaT x 0.5 \n\nwhere deltaT is the transition time from on to off or from off to on. and Fo is the switching frequency.  Add this power to the I-squared-R heating to get the total power.  If you are switching a few amps at 10 Hz you should be OK if you are switching at 20 kHz you need to pay attention to the switching transient heating.  \n\nOh and if you transition to fast you get current filamentation within the part and which can zot it.  But you should be OK with the gate drive circuit (555 output) shown.\n\nFrom a power dissipation standpoint you need to worry about your junction temperature.  For a IRF520 the junction to ambient thermal resistance is 62.5 C/W.  Maximum junction temperature is 175C so I would try to avoid going over 125C, 85C would be better.  So if that is a 2A motor and you have 0.25 Ohms CW on power is 1W.  \n\nIt is 2.14 C/W junction to case.  Add another 0.5 C/W for the case to heat sink.

{"body": "This approach is entirely different than numerical differentiation, so the numerical problems it faces aren't the same.\n\nFor example, finite differencing will have a lot of trouble with `f(x) = sin(2/x)` near `x=0` because the range of `epsilon` where `f(x+epsilon) \\approx f(x) + epsilon*f'(x)` is super tiny.\n\nThis method works by evaluating `f(x)` with a special type of object in place of `x` that behaves just like the number `x` but also records what operations are applied to it.  This thing is called the \"tape\", and once `f(x)` has been evaluated the tape will have recorded something like\n\n    a(x) = 1/x\n    b(x) = 2*x\n    c(x) = sin(x)\n\nbecause `f(x) = c(b(a(x))`.  The tape also records the intermediate values\n\n    x = x\n    y = a(x)\n    z = b(y)\n\nwhich are needed to compute the derivative.  You can think of the tape as a list like `[x a y b z c]` where `a,b,c` are functions and `x,y,z` are numbers.  We can now compute the derivative of `f(x)` by walking backwards through the tape (or equivalently forwards through the reversed tape, which I find easier to think about).\n\nThe reversed tape is: `[c z b y a x]`.  We keep a running total which we initialize to `d = 1`.  At each step we consume a function and a value from the left of the tape, replace the function with it's derivative (the software knows the derivatives for each of the primitive operations it records) and then accumulate that into our running total as follows:\n\n    d = 1\n    d &lt;- d * c'(z)\n    d &lt;- d * b'(y)\n    d &lt;- d * a'(x)\n\nAt the end of this process we have `d = c'(z) * b'(y) * a'(x)` which we know is equal to`f'(x)` from the chain rule.\n\nNotice that at no point do we rely on approximating `f(x+epsilon)` by `f(x) + epsilon * f'(x)` like we did in finite differencing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426191125", "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I understand all The common Chords Major and Minor. (Can play 7 chords but dont understand them very well. as i get that CMaj7 is major and Cm7 is minor but what is C7 as it is not minor or major?, also not sure about Diminished and when you would use them.\n\nYou just have to learn what modifers apply to what when looking at a chord.\n\nFirst of all, when you reading jazz chord symbols, you should always think of things relative to the root of the individual chord rather than the key of the song.  More on that later, but we'll start with the one major exception.\n\nSo when you see a chord with a 7th in it, you should assume it is dominant by default.  That is, it's the b7 in the key of the root.  So a C7 is C E G **Bb**.  This also means if you see a C9 chord, it's C E G **Bb** D.  C13 C E G **Bb** D F A.  Notice that all of these are diatonic to the key of C.  Aside from the b7 (dominant 7th) they are all white keys as you would expect in C.  When you see bigger chords with no markings, the 7th is implied and it's dominant.\n\nSo, now you're keeping that same idea, let's add a modifier.  Cm7.  Once again, think in the key of the root, but not C minor... just C.  Cm7 is C **Eb** G Bb.  The 3rd is the only thing changed by adding minor.  The 7 is assumed to be dominant still.  So a Cm13 will still be C **Eb** G Bb D F A.  If you'd thought in the key of C minor (3 flats) you would've assumed the 13th (A) was flat, but it isn't unless it was marked something like Cmb13 or more likely Cm7(b13) or Cm9(b13).\n\nNext modifier is major.  This one doesn't app to the C triad as you might assume.  Keep in mind that if you just see C, the major triad is implied.  While you might see Cm or Cmin to tell you that the 3rd is lowered making a minor triad, you won't see Cmaj by itself virtually ever.  I'll note an odd exception later.  The major modifier applies to the 7th.  You the 3rd is major (as it would be in the key of the root), but now the 7th isn't dominant but major.  So C E G **B** would be your Cmaj7, or CΔ7, or CM7.  Everything else remains the same.  CM13 would be C E G B D F A.  You might see CΔ by itself, but rarely.  This implies the 7 is there even if it doesn't say it and it's just the same CM7 chord.\n\nAnything from the 9th up will always have their alterations noted specifically.  So something like CM13#11 would be C E G B D **F#** A.  Or C7b9 would be C E G Bb **Db**.  You'll also see other things like C7b5 : C E **Gb** Bb.  Also C7#5 : C E **G#** Bb.\n\nThe other thing wold be diminshed chords.  These are the odd ones out because they are modifiers that apply to many parts of the chord.  Cdim7 would have a b3, b5, bb7.  C Eb Gb Bbb.  The Bbb basically is a A, but we spell it with the double flat because chords are built in thirds.  This is another one where you might see Cdim by itself and you can add the 7th even if it's not written Cdim7.  It will virtually always function the exact same way so it really almost never matters.  For what it's worth, in classical circles, you'll see the diminished symbol as C°.  This is rare in pop and jazz charts.  As a rule, if you see that symbol, it's likely less safe to assume the 7th (though honestly, it really will function the same way and if you're comping a part, it hardly matters anyway).\n\nThere's also half-diminished. Cø7 is the same as C7b5 and like the C°, you'll rarely see it.  There's also the augmented triad.  C+ would be C E **G#**.  C+7 would be C E **G#** Bb.  Though I personally don't see this notation often.  C7#5 would be more common.  This can get messy because of the way some notation is done.  That CM13#11 is sometimes written as CM13+11.  This can get confusing when you also see chords like Cadd9 which means a C triad with an add, but unaltered 9.  \n\nAnd so yeah, the add chords.  You'll often see an add written in.  You should assume everything else I've written about a chord and then just add the voices.  Cadd9 implies the C major triad with an addition 9, but specifically implies that there is no 7th.  It could also be written as Cadd2.  Csus2 or Csus4 imply that there is no third because it is suspended while Cadd2 or Cadd4 imply that the third is there in addition to the added voices.  Another thing that will imply no 3rd is the C5, or sometimes just literally \"C (no 3rd).\"  These come largely from power chords on guitar which is a whole other thing.\n\nSo there's obviously a hierarchy of things that are implied.  Basically if you see anything from a 7th and up, all of the lower voices are implied.  But they aren't necessary.  The 5th is almost never necessary unless it's altered in some way.  1, 3 and 7 are the most important to giving the chord its quality.  Beyond that, the highest additional voice is most important.  C13 is C E G Bb D F A, but this is hard to play and sounds very awkward like this anyway.\n\nA very common voicing for this would be C | Bb E A.  This gives you the root in the left and then the 7 3, 13 in the right.  There is no 5, 9, or 11.  If you have a bass player playing the root, you can leave that out too.\n\nAs a general rule, the 11th is most easy to leave out and unless it's literally marked C11, the natural 11 tends to sound wonky for reasons not worth getting into.  You're way more likely to play a #11 in something like a CMaj13#11.\n\nOh, and finally, now that we've gone through all of that with all of the strange alterations and stuff, you can see why it's best to think from the key of the root of the chord rather than the key of the song.  Additionally, a lot of songs frequently change keys or at least \"key areas\" very quickly.  Many jazz tunes will relocate key center 3 times in 12 bars through the use of ii-V motion.  So jazz chord symbols are meant to be interpreted in a vacuum unlike Roman numeral notation which is totally about context.\n\nSo... Uh... that answers number 2...\n\n&gt;I know some left hand patterns such as Octaves and Broken Chords \n\nThat's not bad.  With larger chords you can use shells of 1&amp;5 or 1&amp;7.  You can do various stride patterns.  You can really practice your right hand arpeggios and try to find ways to wrap the arpeggios around increasingly complex chords.\n\n&gt;My playing is to the point of Just playing a Melody in the right hand with a few octaves and broken chords in the left. \n\nYou can start filling in some of the harmony left over in the chord underneath the melody in your right hand.  So if you have a G in the melody over a C7 chord, your left hand could be playing C and Bb while your right hand was playing E and G.\n\n&gt;What i want to be able to do is take a simple melody line such as Amazing Grace and make it sound fuller and richer. \n\nThis can be deceptively difficult with a song like Amazing Grace that has such a limited harmonic vocabulary.  It's common to hear songs like this thickened up in black gospel music, but that's usually owed to *lots* of fairly complicated chord substitutions.  I'm not even talking about simple tritone subs where you're replacing 1 chord with one or two others.  More like you're replacing one chord with 4 at times.  So much of it is inserting entire progressions in and out of the home key.\n\nI've been working on some of this lately, but I'm far from an expert at it.  It's such a word-of-mouth style that it's hard to pick out without just copying and reverse engineering ideas you hear and like.\n\nYou can always throw in lots of elaborate arpeggios, fills, and extra chord parts under the melody to thicken up the more traditional version of it though.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426217163", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

E.g., C is 1 (the root), E is 3 (the third), G is 5 (the fifth) and B is 7 (the seventh). Those are the notes that make up a Cmaj7 chord. You can do the same thing with Gmaj7, just remember the key of G has one sharp (F#) so that comes into play during chord construction. \n\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426264092", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I can't recommend arpeggios enough. \n\nMost songs that have trickier changes are going to sound better when one plays vertically over them– arpeggio based passages instead of scalar ones. \n\nOne of the best things you can do is to compose exercise solos over changes, based on arpeggios. Let's look at the first few chords of Confirmation by Charlie Parker:\n\n|Fmaj7|Eø7 A+7|D-7 G7|C-7 F7|\n\nThe gist of what you'll first do is to start the arpeggio, and build it up the 7th, and then up to the octave and back down if you have time.\n\nSo we have a line that looks like this (and these are all 8th notes):\n\nF-A-C-E-F(an octave up*)-E-C-A |E G Bb D A C# E# G|\n\n\n| D F A C G B D F|C Eb G Bb F A C Eb|\n\n\nIn bar 1, we have a 4 beats dedicated to the F maj7 arp, which makes it up to the octave on the downbeat of beat 3 and moves down to the 3rd again by the upbeat of 4. In bars 2-4, we have 2 beats dedicated to each chord, with each beat subdivided into 2 8th notes, which gives us 4 8th notes per chord change to play all of the 4 necessary notes in the 7th chord arpeggio. Dig? Cool. \n\nNow, once you shed this a bit, start your arpeggios on different chord tones. The one I typed out starts on the 1 for all chords. Why not start on the third and go 3-5-7-1 instead of 1-3-5-7? From there, do different combinations of starting points, and from there, work on arpeggiating the chord further up, and playing the 9, 11, and 13 of a chord as well. If you work on all this and get all these exercises down, your practice arpeggios will end up sounding basically indistinguishable from a bebop solo, and all you'll need to do is shed rhythm.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426264303", "subreddit": "Jazz", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "So basically it boils down to how scales work on a theoretical level. If you take the notes from C major, C D E F G A B, in that order, there's a pattern, which is whole whole half whole whole whole half. That's the same pattern that every major scale follows. In C major the half steps are located between E and F, and B and C. If we move the starting note over to A  and use the same notes, we have the A natural minor scale, which contains the notes A B C D E F G.\n\nThe reason that the notes are flattened, or minor, in the c minor scale, is that c minor shares notes with Eb major, much like A minor shares notes with C major. So, we take the Eb major scale, which is Eb F G An Bb C D and start on the C, we get C D Eb F G Ab Bb, the C natural minor scale!\n\nEdit: This does boil down to a mix of theory knowledge and practice/memorization though.

{"body": "\"Sir, open this door!\" A heavy hand pounded away at the wooden door I stood in front of. I winced at every minuscule creak and nanoscopic crack his hand shuddered into my door.\n\n\nI felt a small twinging feeling within my back, and I felt a floodgate of adrenaline open up into my veins. I walked to the door and, timing it very carefully, I opened the door as he was about to slam his meaty fist into the door. \n\nI looked at him as he shabbily tripped against his own feet, I got a good look at him; he wore what seemed like an armoured navy blue jumpsuit, the armour consisted of a simple policeman's vest and, as always, the vest was filled with many different tools; a radio, a pair of handcuffs, a cutely small fire extinguisher, a riot baton, and a small handgun.\n\n\nHe straightened up almost immediately, and as he did, I smiled towards him. Unlike the other police that had confronted me over the years, he was the first not to wear a riot helmet; I could only assume that he was a bit cocky. \n\n\nI motioned towards an already set table, with a teapot, two cups, a bowl of sugar cubes and a small cup of milk. Two chairs, one tucked in and one turned to accommodate someone. He half smiled half sneered at me as if I had just spat venom in his face, but he walked into my house anyway.\n\n\nHe pulled the chair out from under the table and sat and, without asking, pouring himself a cup of tea, using a lot of the milk and using five sugar cubes before I had a chance to even cross the room. \n\n\nI entered my seat and stared across at the police officer, seeing him pay as much attention to me as a giant would a gnat. I already didn't like him.\n\n\n\"Sir,\" he spoke up after a big swig of his tea. \"You have committed five different crimes as of yesterday, two as of this morning,\" as he spoke he pulled a shined and polished flute from the back of his vest and placed it on the table. \"This seven crimes would total seven different lifetimes in prison,\" he then pulled the handgun out from his pocket and placed it directly next to the flute, having the barrel point directly at me. \"How to you plead?\"\n\n\nI looked the man over silently, seeing the common problems; a twinge in his eyes, small amounts of sweat near the ears and a tiny shaking to his hands. I finally spoke as he looked like he would burst into flames. \"Not guilty...\"\n\n\nHe, wordlessly, placed his gloved hand upon the flute and pushed it towards me. As it reached within my grasp, he pulled his hand back and folded his arms. I picked up the instrument and placed my lips to their plate and blew.\n\n\n*c c c c d e   c a g   E E E c E G g*\n\n\nAs I finished my small tune, I looked at him. The look on his face was almost priceless; a slightly opened mouth, widened eyes and whiter skin. He looked as if he had seen a ghost.\n\n\n\"Sir...\" he seemed to swallow back tears. \"You are immune from-\" \n\n\nI threw my hand out, grasped the handgun, spun it in my fingers to make the barrel face him, and fired three shots through his head. His mouth seemed to swallow one of them as it passed through his mouth. \n\n\nHis body loosened up, his back relaxing on the back of his chair. I threw the handgun to the floor, reached over to his cup, and wiped the edge where he had drunk from. I experimentally took a sip, it tasted awful.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426281871", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

Wait... It started to come back to me.\n\n\"Ms... Jones, thank you for asking, but... I'm still a little disoriented, if you'd just give me a moment...?\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\" Her voice sounded warm, pleasant. \"Prolonged sessions tend to have that effect, as you'll no doubt recall in a moment.

It came flooding back to me.\n\n----\n**C H A P T E R _ O N E**.EXE\n\n    Four Years Earlier...\n\n\"Ms. Jones, thank you for coming in on such short notice,\" I beamed. This young woman was beautiful, more so than her predecessor. \"The young woman who held this position before you left more or less suddenly, leaving us with very little time to find a replacement. I convinced the board that, based on your CV, you were out best choice. I hope I didn't make a mistake doing that.\"\n\n\"No sir, I'll put everything I have into the job,\" Ms. Jones replied, somehow seriously and warmly at once. \"You won't regret hiring me, Mr. Gordon.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I won't, Ms. Jones.\" I led her into the next room. \"Now, here is where you'll be working. The project is a full-dive virtual environment, similar to what that 'Argus' company over in Japan is doing.\"\n\nI showed the young lady the design documents. \"The planned end result is a full virtual world where players will be able to live full fantasy lives, whether they choose to swing a sword or sling spells delving into dungeons, open up a shop in one of the hub towns - or even out in the wilderness, though there'd be a significantly higher risk in that - or live the life of a layabout and just enjoy the sights and sounds of the virtual world.\" I smiled my most winning smile. \"But that technology is still a long way off, and for now, we'll be working on a prototype, much smaller scale, single-user for now.\"\n\n\"I'm definitely intrigued by this idea, sir,\" Ms. Jones gushed. \"I've been a firm supporter of the virtual reality movement since I was a small child, my father was one of the pioneers of the sensory immersion software your full-dive, and probably Argus' as well, builds upon.\" So I made the right choice after all, Ms. Jones is a virtual-reality legacy. \"I'm looking forward to working on this project.\"\n\n\"Then why don't we start now?\" I led her to a workstation, equipped with a computer system so cutting-edge, it wasn't even on the market yet. \"This will be your workstation. Since your father pioneered the sensory immersion software, that's where we'll have you start.\"\n\n**(Chapter One ends here, but I'll definitely continue if there's interest.

Sure we're not fusing atoms, our body is a chemical machine, but still these basics principles are the basic of molecular biology.\n\n''= mc²\ns ince r e ly hope tha t you found the previous section\nhelpful. Let’s assume that we are all emotionally\nwell, or on the way to becoming emotionally well, or\nat least thinking of taking steps, if even baby-steps,\nin that direction.\nThis next part I doubt you would find in any other\ndiet book. Much of what you’ve already read is not common\nto other diet books, which is why I am compelled\nto write this one. I don’t think it at all extraneous, otherwise\nI wouldn’t write it. I want you to know the why\nand the how of lifestyle change and energy balance. It is\nimportant to me that you understand why you should do\nthe things I am suggesting; because, if you truly understand,\nand if you choose to make the proper choices that\nI will show you, then there is a high probability of success\nand little excuse for failure.\nT HE R E L ATIVIT Y D I E T\nE = mc2\nE Energy\nm mass in kilograms\nc the speed of light in a vacuum in meters per second\nIn 1905 Einstein wrote a paper on the equivalence of\nmatter and energy that grew from his thoughts on the\nspecial theory of relativity. E = mc2 has become the most\nfamous equation in all of science and at the very basic\nlevel tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable.\nMass is simply anything with substance or weight, such\nas our body mass (weight) as it is applied in the Body\nMass Index tables. The equation defines energy as mass\nmultiplied by speed (mc2); and since the speed of light\nsquared is such a large number, 448,900,000,000,000,000\nor about 450 million billion miles per hour, there is a\ngreat deal of energy in a small amount of matter. This\nis exemplified by the power of the strong nuclear force\ncontained within the atomic nucleus, which is unleashed\nin the controlled form of the nuclear energy of a nuclear\npower plant or the uncontrollable chain reaction of a\nnuclear detonation.\nThe Joule, as a unit of measure for energy, is a representation\nof Einstein’s equation, because as you can see\nfrom the formulaic definition of a joule:\n1 J=1 kg × meter2/second2\nIt is defined as mass (kilograms) times speed (meters per\nsecond). The potential (stored) energy of a one-kilogram\n(2.2 lbs) object held 1 meter above the surface of the\nearth is equal to 9.8 J. Imagine the weight in your hand,\nabout that of three Happy Meals. If this is dropped from\nE = mc ² 1 5 1\n1 meter (39 inches) above the ground, 9.8 joules of potential\nenergy is converted to 9.8 joules of kinetic (motion)\nenergy which is then converted to heat and sound when\nit hits the earth. If you lift it back up to one meter above\nthe earth, the energy cost will then be 9.8 J.\nTo put this in perspective, we will compare all\nenergy equivalents to the “nutritional calorie,” which is\ndenoted by the capital “C.” The nutritional Calorie represents\n1,000 calories, denoted by a small “c” (gram calorie).\nThe amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of\nwater 1 degree centigrade is the value of the small calorie;\nwhereas, the amount of energy required to raise 1\nkilogram of water 1 degree centigrade is 1,000 c, or 1 Cal\n(nutritional calorie). It is simpler to quantize the nutritional\nvalue of food with the larger unit of measure; otherwise,\nif counting the gram calories in a hardboiled egg,\nyou would have 75,000 calories instead of the conventional\n75 nutritional (C)alories.\nIn Europe and Australia, the preferred unit of measure\nof food energy is the kilo joule. Just as the “small”\ncalorie too small to be practical in the nutritional labeling\nof the energy content of food, so is the joule too small\nto be practical for the same purpose.\nWith this in mind, the value of 1 joule equals 0.00024\nCalorie (nutritional). Our one kilogram weight one meter\nabove the surface of the earth contains 0.0023 nutritional\nCalories, which is derived from 9.8 joules multiplied\nby 0.00024 Calories/joule, of potential energy. One\njoule is approximately that amount of energy contained\nin a drop of Guiness. Contrast this with an earlier illustration\nof the nuclear power unleashed from the 0.0006\nkilograms of uranium in Little Boy that resulted in a\n12,500 kiloton explosion over the city of Hiroshima. If the\n1 5 2 T HE R E L ATIVIT Y D I E T\n12,500 kilotons is converted to Calories, the equivalent\namount is 1.25 × 1013, or twelve thousand, five hundred\ntrillion Calories.\nIt may very well be that there is a galaxy far, far away,\nwhere intelligent beings are able to biologically harness\nnuclear power by ingesting a BB-sized uranium pellet\nevery twenty years, allowing them to live and function\nwithout observing the mundane tasks of urination and\ndefecation. However, as the intelligent beings in this galaxy,\nour biological systems can only harness the chemical\nenergy from the bonds between atoms, which is much\nless potent than that within the atomic nucleus.\nThe primary role for nuclear energy in our universe\nis that of the thermonuclear fusion of four atoms\nof Hydrogen into one atom of Helium that occurs in the\nstars, including our own, thereby allowing life on this\nthird planet from the sun. A secondary role is, of course,\nthat of a controlled release for the provision of energy\nfor the use of humankind.\nBeing resigned to the pedestrian power of chemical\nenergy, I thought it would be interesting to illustrate\nsome respective chemical energy values of everyday\nsubstances.\nSubstance\nCalories/kg\n(nutritional)\nGasoline 11,202\nTNT 989\nVegetable oil 10,079\nBody fat 9,076\nProtein 4,000\nCarbohydrate 4,000\nNuclear fusion 71,653,768,988\nSpecific orbital energy of low Earth orbit 7,882\nE = mc ² 1 5 3\nFrom the above you will note that the energy density of\nthe foods we eat is roughly equivalent to gasoline, and\nthe energy of a low earth orbit. Surprisingly, the energy\ndensity of TNT is far less. What accounts for the explosive\npower of TNT is the rate of energy release.''\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426344955", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Now what's the issue?\"\n\nShe looked at me warily. \"Sir, we haven't worked together, I work for you, and as such it's probably more appropriate that I continue to call you Mr. Gordon.\" She turned back to the screen, chewing her lip. \"As to the problem... Well, our test subject's brain activity, particularly in the areas reported to be connected with pain stimuli, is spiking, and the unusual thing is all he's doing is standing on plain solid ground.\"\n\n\"Did the subject have any injuries prior to entering full dive?\" I figured a brilliant girl like her would have thought of this already, but it never hurts to cover your bases.\n\n\"None, sir. Subject 5 is in perfect health, and in the prime of his life.\" She bit harder on her lip, just short of drawing blood. This nervous habit of hers is somewhat of a hazard. \"But so were subjects 1 through 4, and we both remember what happened to them...\"\n\nSubject 1, white rat, female, six months old. Entered the full dive environment October 17, 2034. Brain activity spiked across the entirety of the brain, sensory overload ensued. Subject died nearly instantly.\n\nSubjects 2 and 3, over the span of the following month,  weren't much different, each lasting a few minutes longer than the last before succumbing to sensory overload. The adjustments Ms. Jones and her team were making to the sensory immersion software were definitely steps in the right direction, however minuscule the results seemed to be.\n\nSubject 4. Our miracle. Ms. Jones had grown attached to this one, named it Theseus. The name was appropriate, as little Theseus was the first subject to complete the maze in the proto-full dive environment, only to collapse and succumb to the same sensory overload immediately upon exiting the simulation.\n\n\"Yes... We certainly do.\" I looked at her screen. \"Stop biting your lip, you're going to chew a hole straight through. And look here,\" I said pointing at a section of the brain scan, \"something else is off.\"\n\n\"The instruments may just... wait! You're right,\" she exclaimed. \"The problem isn't the subject, the instruments, or even the lines of code we've been focusing on! The problem is the delivery method!\" She deactivated the environment, and rushed into the room where the full-dive testing equipment was held and utilized. I followed, eager to see what breakthrough she had made.\n\n**C H A P T E R _ T H R E E**.EXE\n\nMs. Jones was leaning over the apparatus, tweaking the tiny full-dive helmet's transmitter array. \"See, we've been coming at this from the wrong angle,\" she said, up until that moment she had seemed oblivious to my presence but obviously she had noticed. \"The code was fine - or almost fine, it's just about perfect in that area now - but the delivery method was mis-configured. Every signal was being directed to the *entire* brain, meaning that every sensation, painful, pleasurable, or just... plain, was causing severe physical pain to the subjects. If I just adjust this *here*...\" She made a final adjustment, removed subject 5 from the table - having decided that he had been through enough for one day - and replaced him with another, and placed the helmet on subject 6's head. \"I think we've got it. Now let's go start the experiment, and see my genius in action!\" She laughed, melodic, and her eye sparkled with joy.\n\nWe returned to her workstation, and she triggered the start of the simulation. \"Now I suppose we wait for the full-dive to take,\" I said, bristling with apprehension.\n\n\"No, the dive is already active. Subject 6 is in the virtual maze, and... yes! Look at this, brain activity is normal!\" She was ecstatic, and so was I. Full-dive technology was within our grasp, hell, it was already working on a smaller scale. \"Camera one online... Six is navigating the maze... His body is perfectly still, but his brain activity registers as movement.\" It was working as intended, then.\n\n\"Congratulations, Ms. Jones,\" I grinned. \"The project is, in preliminary testing of course, a success. I'd like to take you to dinner to celebrate. You've been working long hours on this, surviving on cafeteria food, you deserve a break and a good meal.\"\n\n**C H A P T E R _ F O U R**.EXE\n\n    Two Months Later...\n\n\"Jim, I mean Mr. Gordon...\" Cassandra called, \"we've made another breakthrough!\" She looked pleased, even ecstatic, and the scar on her lower lip - a result of her nervous habit, of course - was almost healed.\n\n\"Glad to hear it, Cass,\" I smiled back. \"What's the breakthrough this time?\" For the past month, with the sensory immersion software complete barring any major issues in the transition to larger and more complex subjects, she'd been working on the simulation itself.\n\n\"Well, see, the NPC coding was behaving erratically, so Joe had the brilliant idea to use the scans from the first successful maze test to build a realistic AI.\" Joe Martinez was the lead environment designer, but he had proficiency in other areas as well, apparently including 'quick thinking'.\n\n\"Successful, I assume?\"\n\n\"Preliminary tests say yes,\" she beamed. \"The AI rodents are navigating the maze exactly how a real rat would, and even forming a sort of 'pack' - one definite leader emerges, and the rest of the rats, including our test subject, follow the leader through the maze. The leader often turns out to be smarter than expected as well, actually breaking the cheese at the center into smaller pieces and dividing it between the pack.\"\n\n\"Impressive work, Cass, and be sure to thank Joe for the inspiration.\" I kissed her on the cheek. We'd been seeing each other outside of work since that fateful day two months ago, and now more than ever, I was proud of her.\n\n\"Jim... Mr. Gordon...\" She whispered. \"That is inappropriate workplace behavior, sir!\" She laughed, ringing like chimes in my ear, and I joined her. \"But seriously... Some of the guys don't know, what if they see you and report you to HR?\"\n\nShe had a point. \"Right then... Tonight? Still on for dinner at my place?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't dream of missing it, 'Mr. Gordon'.\"\n\n\"Then I'll see you at seven, barring any further breakthroughs, 'Ms. Jones'.\"\n\n**C H A P T E R _ F I V E**.EXE\n\n    Eight Months Later...\n\nCass walked into the office looking more radiant than ever, and immediately entered my private office. \"Jim...\" She sounded serious. \"I've got something I need to tell you.\"\n\n\"What is it, Cass?\" I was curious, but more than anything I was drawn in by the glow she seemed to have about her.\n\n\"Well... I was at the doctor's this morning...\" That certainly explained why she had called in saying she needed the morning off... \"He told me... well...\" The suspense was killing me. \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nI was thrown for a loop. We were going to be parents. This was big, possibly bigger than any breakthrough to date in the project. Possibly bigger than anything in my life, not including that first breakthrough when we solved the sensory overload issue and she said yes when I asked her to dinner. \"Are... Are we sure?\" She nodded, smiling brightly. \"This is big, Cass. This is amazing.\" I opened my desk drawer. \"I've been waiting for the right moment for this, but... what better time than now?\" I pulled out a small box, and bent to one knee. \"Cassandra Jones, will you marry me?\"\n\n\"Jim...

What they do mention is that it's like a telephone number which as we know can use the same numbers(symbols) multiple times. But of course this is not decisive.\n\nI'm only speculating here but maybe the symbols are just *based* on constellations rather than direcly relate to the current position of a constellation. So the ancients set up a coordinate system originating from the middle of the galaxy or whatever and then instead of numbers as symbols they used star constellations the way they appeared on the planet's sky on which they were developing the system (Earth). If the galaxy is expanding then your position (symbol sequence) in this system would change. And this is what happens in the show.\n\n..although I'm not sure if this makes sense in 3D geometry\n\n..or if it makes sense at all\n\nedit: But it would explain how a Milky Way gate can dial the Pegasus galaxy or the Destiny.

{"body": "For most scales the idea is to have exactly ONE of each note letter (abcdefg) in the scale. As well as F major, scales that have a flat in the name (Bb, Eb, Ab, etc) should only have flat accidentals in the scales because this way it works out to have one of each letter. So Bb major works best as Bb C D Eb F G A. But if you use D# then the scale is Bb C D D# F G A - you have two Ds and no Es! For all of the other key signatures, you should be consistent by using sharps. For example G major works best as G A B C D E F# G, not G A B C D E Gb G.\n\nAs with using A# major, this is known as an enharmonic equivalent because it sounds the same to the ear but looks different on paper. You would be silly to use a key signature with 10 sharps (every note sharp but F, C and G are double sharp). The point of music notation is to allow other musicians to play your music - you don't want to be that composer that makes drives the musicians crazy! Go with the easier option of Bb Major. Also double sharps aren't allowed in key signatures.\n\nThere are some exceptions with the whole stay consistent with the whole flats/sharps thing. If you are in G minor you have Bb and Eb which are the only notes with accidentals. You may have heard of a harmonic minor scale which is just an ordinary (natural) minor scale but the 7th degee of the scale is raised. So in this case G harmonic minor would be G A Bb C D Eb F# G. This is an OK use of a sharp accidental in a scale that uses flats. However, when you are writing the key signature make sure you don't write that F# in the keysignautre though (we only write the accidentals of the natural/ordinary minor scale in the key sig, not the harmonic minor).\n\n\nAs for the whole C# major and Db major both being there? Well with the A# you have the easier enharmonically equivalent (sounds the same) Bb major which has way less accidentals. C# has 7 sharps and Db has 5 flats so Db major is hardly an improvement, so they just put both there. And i believe they are listing all possible major key signatures - there are 15 of them (7 flat ones, 7 sharp ones, and C major)\n\nHope this helped", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426409705", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The heist theme comes through so well, there's a fantastic build-up of tension, great guard movement mechanic, interesting planning decisions, and some silly laughs sprinkled on top.\n\nThe other is Matt Stockwell's **Charm City Blues**, a prototype of which I brought home from PAX East (thanks, /u/mobtowngames :D). In this game, you play as members of the Charm City Vice Squad who are trying to catch a suspect within a time constraint. I love how each character feels different every game, because you draw random Virtue and Vice traits for them each game. These can sometimes change their stats under certain circumstances, or make them avoid certain locations and encounters. The turn countdown clock adds lot of pressure and encourages you to take risks, but you have to balance the potential reward against the suspect's suspicion level. And the stories.

{"body": "There are a few ways to think of Bazaar and how it relates to Traversals.\n\nWe can think of Bazaar as a Bob Atkey style 2-parameter parameterized comonad. \n\nThe easiest way to see why it comes up in `lens` is to think about the two ways we talk about lenses. We have `lens`, which uses:\n\n    type Lens s t a b = forall f. Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; s -&gt; f t\n    type Lens' s a = forall f. Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; s -&gt; f s\n\nwith a couple of laws and we have `data-lens`, which offers just the 2-parameter version of things:\n\n    newtype DataLens' s a = Lens (s -&gt; Store a s)\n\nwith equivalent laws.\n\nNow, let's compare `Lens'` and `DataLens`'\n\n    s -&gt; Store a s\n\nvs\n\n    forall s. (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; s -&gt; f s\n\nflip the latter\n\n   forall f. Functor f =&gt; s -&gt; (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; f s\n\nthen push the constraint in:\n\n    s -&gt; forall f. Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; f s\n\nthen wrap it in a newtype\n\n    s -&gt; Context' a s\n\nThis indicates that a data type like\n\n    newtype Context' a s = Context' (forall a. (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; f s)\n\nis a form of the `Store` comonad. In this view a `Lens'` is a `Context'` comonad-coalgebra.\n\nNow, we wind up needing an extra index when we talk about type-changing lenses.\n\nSo let's upgrade Context:\n\n    newtype Context a b t = Context (forall f. Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; f t)\n\nNow `Context` is isomorphic to the 2-parameter parameterized Store comonad. You have `iextract :: Context i i a -&gt; a` etc.\n\nAnd if Data-Lens had a 4-parameter version of its lens type you'd be able to do the same flip trick to show that\n\n    s -&gt; Context a b t\n\nis isomorphic to the equivalent\n\n    s -&gt; IStore a b t\n\nversion you'd get from `data-lens`.\n\nIf we repeat the above experiment using something like\n\n    type DataTraversal' s a = s -&gt; FunList a s\n\nwe'd get a `data-lens` style treatment of Traversals. This is what Russell O'Connor did in his [\"Functor is to Lens as Applicative is to Biplate\"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2841) paper. He calls `FunList` here the `CartesianStore`.\n\nBut if we upgrade all the way to the type-changing version, and take `lens`-style Traversals and play the same game by flipping\n\n    type Traversal s t a b = forall f. Applicative f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; s -&gt; f t\n\nto get\n\n    s -&gt; forall f. Applicative f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; f t\n\nwe see Bazaar there on the right hand side!\n\nSo this is how `FunList` is related to `Bazaar`.\n\nThey aren't isomorphic, however, except for finite traversals.\n\nFor finite traversals, you can finish 'left associating' everything to get it in the form suitable for FunList.\n\nFor infinite traversals you can never finish getting out a's and incurring 'b' obligations to start producing the 't' at the end with a FunList, while you can start producing `f t` productively out of the `f b`'s in a tree structure when `f` is sufficiently non-strict using: `(a -&gt; f b) -&gt; f t`.\n\nNow to get to your question. How do you convert?\n\nIn lens we use `partsOf` (and `unsafePartsOf`) to convert a `Traversal` into a `Lens` to the list of the results. (You are expected not to change the size of the list.)\n\nGiven a FunList a b you can extract the [a]'s very easily by running down until you get to the `Done` case. You can also take a `[a]`'s of the same length and run through ignoring the `a's you are given by the `FunList` and supplying each to the function at the end. This is basically what `partsOf` does with the `Traversal` form.\n\nA more direct way to go from a `Traversal' s a` to `s -&gt; FunList a s` is to exploit the `Applicative` structure of `FunList` and pick 'f' = `FunList a` when walking `forall f. Applicative f =&gt; (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; s -&gt; f s`\n\nSo now you need to give me `a -&gt; FunList a a` and the traversal will give you `s -&gt; FunList a s` !\n\nso what is that? Recalling `FunList`:\n\n    data FunList a b = Done b | More a (Funlist a (a -&gt; b))\n\nNow,\n\n(\\a -&gt; More a (Done id)) :: a -&gt; FunList a a \n\nis the trick\n\npass that to your Traversal and you get out a FunList comonad coalgebra!\n\nNow, so all of this without caring about `s` and you get the conversion to/from FunList.\n\nNow this isn't an isomorphism:\n\n    FunList a b -&gt; Bazaar' a b\n\nis total, but\n\n    Bazaar' a b -&gt; FunList a b\n\nrequires reassociating to the left, and so may fail for infinite traversals. You'll introduce bottoms that weren't there originally by starting in Bazaar and round tripping through this.\n\nSo, is there an \"initial\" encoding which doesn't introduce these bottoms?\n\nThe answer is yes, but you need to quotient your handling of the result.\n\nI invite you to explore:\n\nhttps://github.com/ekmett/lens/blob/master/src/Control/Lens/Internal/Magma.hs#L62\n\nHow can we discover types like `Bazaar` and `Context`?\n\nAlso, there is an interesting result, in that we can build both `Bazaar` and `Context` using very very simple building blocks.\n\n    newtype Free p f a = Free { \n       runFree :: forall g. p g =&gt; (forall x. f x -&gt; g x) -&gt; g x }\n\nis a neat construction.\n\n`Free Functor` is a universal property encoding of `Coyoneda`!\n\n`Free Monad` is actually a perfectly legitimate encoding of the free monad.\n\n`Free p` is also a McBride style indexed monad, just like how Dan Piponi noted normal `Free` is a McBride-style indexed monad.\n\nNow, in \"Kleisli arrows of Outrageous Fortune\" McBride gives a construction to convert between his one-parameter indexed monads and Bob Atkey's 2-parameter version. He calls it `(:=)`, I'll call it \"At\":\n\n    data At a i j where\n       At :: a -&gt; At a i i\n\nCoyoneda f is isomorphic to f _if_ f is a Functor. but if its not, all bets are off.\n\n    Free Functor (At a b) t \n    = \n    forall g. Functor g =&gt;(forall x. At a b x -&gt; g x) -&gt; g t\n    =\n    forall g. Functor g =&gt; (a -&gt; g b) -&gt; g t\n    =\n    Context a b t\n\nNote this is kinda weird, the parameterized monad works over the 'a' parameter here, but the parameterized comonad works over the t parameter.\n\n(If you go back to the Magma module linked above you'll see that `Molten` performs this flip letting us build/compose on one parameter and use it as a comonad on the other.)\n\nAnd we can do the same construction with\n \n    Free Applicative (At a b) t\n\nto generate `Bazaar`!\n\nThis also means that if you look at it right,\n\n    s -&gt; Free Functor (At a b) t\n\nis a 2-parameter indexed Kleisli arrow where the indices tell you the types you need to change to come back.\n\nThat may have wound up a little long for a reddit reply. =)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426445598", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think a scale comes not so much from the overtones of a single pitch. Basic intervals come from the way the overtones of two pitches overlap. Then a scale is like a cluster of notes that are related to each other by basic intervals. \n\nA lot of what drives scales is temperament. The fundamental comma that gets tempered in a diatonic scale is the syntonic comma.\n\nOne way to think about a diatonic scale is that it is a sequence like F C G D A E B where each note is a fifth above the one before it. But the fun thing here is that... if we think of C as 1 and fold everything into one octave range, the E would be 81/64. But this is very very close to 80/64 = 5/4 which is a basic interval. \n\nBecause these intervals aren't distinguished, the clustering of the notes in a diatonic scale can bind any given pair of notes in several ways. \n\nSeems to me that scales start from super simple things, maybe just two or three pitches per octave, maybe just a few notes altogether, just a few notes that could be used for religious chants or work songs etc. Then as music gets more sophisticated, basic mathematics opens up a variety of options for how to extend scales. More and more options open up as the music gets more and more sophisticated. \n\nSeems to me the diatonic scale is maybe three or four levels up in sophistication from the most basic. Maybe there are a dozen or two natural choices at that level. So there is a degree of accident. Our music is at a certain level of sophistication - not too primitive, but not super-sophisticated either.

I rush Morellos &gt; Sorc Boots &gt; Deathcap &gt; Void Staff &gt; Zhona's &gt; GA/Banshee's Veil\n\nIf I'm against an AD mid then I skip Morellos and start with a Zhona's.  If I have 1600 gold before first back then I'll get a needlessly large rod first and build Deathcap. \n\nAs for skill order, you have two options.  The normal thing to do is go R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E as you'll have a lower W CD and be safer/more mobile.  What I like to do, however, is max E second so I have more killing potential with a better snare that does tons of damage, but I lose a lot more mobility.  That's completely up to you.\n\nTo burst with Leblanc, you'll usually want to Q&gt;R&gt;W&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;etc.  Sometimes you might want to use your ulti for a double E providing extra CC.  Or multiple targets might be very low and you can use your ulti for extra W's so you can dash on their faces.  It's all situational, but the first combo is what will do the most damage on a single target.  You can also W on top of someone then Q&gt;R&gt;E and W back to safety.  You can also start with E if you want to CC them asap and you know you won't miss your E.  There are a lot of options, sorry.\n\nStart pushing your lane a bit so you get level 2 advantage as soon as you get to lane.  Play aggressive and harass with autos and Q.  Don't always W in when you get Q mark or you'll lose a lot of mana or make them back before you can surprise them with a kill.  When they're around half health, all in them with Q W E Q ignite or something like that.  Don't forget to auto attack while you're bursting and stuff.  Leblanc is strong af in lane so you shouldn't have that hard of a time unless you're against a counter.\n\nAlways be aware of minimap and look to roam.  WHENEVER there's a teamfight somewhere on the map, clear your lane as fast as you can and immediately walk over there.  For a fast lane clear, W in the middle of minions and R in the same spot.  You'll usually be able to clean up whatever is left from the fight, or even be a hero and save your teammates!\n\nStick to the shadows.  You're an assassin.  Hide in high traffic bushes where you know a squishy will pass by.  But be careful of wards.  You might want to get a sweeper trinket to make sure, but I personally like the upgraded yellow trinket as it's a 250g regenerating sightstone (awesome).\n\nTeamfights can be hard, but just try your best to enter in from an angle that can get you to their backline and try to burst someone.  It gets to the point where you can 100-0 someone by just W'ing in range of them (you don't have to hit them) and pressing Q&gt;R&gt;E and W back to safety.

{"body": "I forgot to mention that the alternative \"Leaving the eggs\" Has a 5 negative, 3 positive outcome.  There are enough points in Rise of Tiamat for the party to regain the points.  It isnt a major hook in the module- and as a DM you can easily work around it.  Also Rise of Tiamat is a nice module,... but unless you are using milestone,... I would supplement it with another module somewhere to ensure that the group is appropriate level once hitting Tiamat.  She probably wont be \"full\" strength when/if the party fights her,... but there is a huge potential for a boss fight that will be memorable.  I would consider forcing the party to fight her only if they are cranking out decent amounts of damage (200/round in nova).  An AC 20 Tiamat with 400 hp and 3 legendary actions seems nice for 6 level 15-17's.  \nThe other important hook is Rezmir (near the end of HODQ).  That mask she has is essential and needs to be obtained to allow flexibility to any Tiamat encounter.\nHere is the ROT text you will need\n\n\"Page 88\nWe a k e n in g t h e D r a g o n Q u e e n\nThe actions of the heroes in and prior to this final battle can reduce Tiamat’s power before she appears. Make a note if any of the following events occurs:\n• The count of rounds over which the ritual is successfully focused is reset to 0 because the ritual is\ninterrupted for two successive rounds. (During last battle \n• The Mask of the Dragon Queen is destroyed, or is removed from Severin’s body and taken from the temple\nsanctuary (area 13).\n• The characters hold any of the dragon masks, or can otherwise prevent one or more masks from being\nused in the ritual. (The Black Dragon Mask might have been claimed by the characters in the previous\nadventure.)\n• Severe damage is inflicted to the Temple of Tiamat, as from an earthquake spell.\n• The sacrifice of prisoners in front of the temple is stopped. This might have been previously accomplished\nby attacking the dragons or by cutting off the flow of prisoners to the area. \n\nWhen any of the previous events occurs, the following penalties are applied to Tiamat, in this order:\n• Tiamat’s attack and breath weapon damage is reduced by 15, and her hit points drop by 75.\n• Tiamat loses her Regeneration trait, her hit point maximum is reduced by 75, and her immunity to\nbludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons becomes resistance instead.\n• Tiamat loses Limited Spell Immunity, and her hit point maximum is reduced by 75.\n• Tiamat takes a -5 penalty to attack rolls, saving throw DCs, and to her AC, and her hit point maximum is\nreduced by 75.\n• Tiamat can take only three legendary actions, and her hit point maximum is reduced by 75. If all the above penalties are successfully applied,\"\"\n\n\nDropping Tiamat to 240 HP would be a joke--- But considering a Pally with Hazirawn and Haste can crank an average of 180 using 3 attacks and max smites against Tiamat... The IDEA of a crit tossed in... and allowing a character to single handedly dispatch Tiamat...... is not acceptable.  Everyone needs to contribute to make it truly memorable. It needs to be a 2 round fight or Tiamat will TPK the group.  If they do all the steps to weaken her... I would run HP= (Average DPR party X 75%)*2.  But that is just an opinion -  The end of the module would feel SO MUCH MORE complete.......

{"body": "I'm going to go with a different approach than the old \"a mode is a major scale starting on a note other than the root\" IMO thinking about modes like that isn't really useful.\n\nFirst, I think it is better to think about a mode as its own scale. If you think D Dorian you should know it cold. None of this its \"it's starting on the D note using the C scale\" you need to think of it as its own thing. It's cool to understand the relationship with the major scale but it's not really important in application. \n\nSo the modes can be classified into three categories based on tonality.\n\nMajor (Ionian, Lydian, mixolydian)\nMinor(Dorian, Phrygian, aeolian)\nDiminished (locrian)\n\nIf you you compare each mode in parallel to its corresponding major or minor key you can see when/where it can be used.\n\nEx)\nD Minor and D Dorian\n\nD Minor: D E F G A Bb C D\nD Dorian: D E F G A B C D\n\nThey only have one note that is different. In context D Dorian is going to sound more like D minor  than C Major.  So with that said how do you know when to use one over the other? Well you you would use it when the progression resolves to a D minor chord and one of the chords in the progression has a B natural and not a Bb, a common chord would be G Major instead of G Minor. Likewise if both of the notes are omitted from the progression and the bass isn't playing either of them then you can mix and match as you see fit.\n\nYou can do this with the other modes and you should be able to see when you can use them.

Haproxy will ping each server as they come up to warm them and only put them back in rotation when they return a 200 response code.  \n5.  After we have confirmed our new features are working on our meta tier we will then deploy to the rest of our network, including Stack Overflow.  \n6.  We have monitor for our exceptions and follow a very important rule:  A B C D E F  (Always Be Checking after a Deploy for Exceptions or you're FIRED)\n\nAs far as database migrations, we use our own in house migration tool and write our SQL in such a way where we make additions.  It's rare that we drop columns.  All migrations should not break existing functionality and be tested by a dev on our dev tier prior to release.

{"body": "Still new to bard but this my opinion of him.  Bard is a high utility support that excels in utility. He does well in most aspects of the game. He is good in teamfights specifically near dragon and baron, he is great at helping get picks due to the stupidly long range his e can become, and he is good in small skirmishes as well.  \n\nCore items are still being worked out by even the pros. I have seen all 3 support items started on him but I feel that targons can be the best. After that mobi boots are a must and so is sightstone.  For the last 3 items Id pick up crucible, frozen heart, and probably locket. \n\nI start w then get q q e q r and then max RQWE.\n\nNot quite sure power spikes on him but I would say around lv 4 with E and mobi boots he can roam and make plays happen as well as lv 6 since his ult has huge potential.\n\nI feel like bard synergizes well with a champion how can wave clear and has decent poke. This is because they are able to hold their own in lane when you roam  and can follow up well if a stun is landed. As for the rest of the team comp im not quite sure since he is very versatile. But any aoe champs would work well with us ult.  \n\nCounter play for him is usually high cc high burst champions especially in lane. Someone like annie or leona can do very well against him and take advantage of his squishiness ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426615398", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "+1 for effort! I don't agree with some of your arrangement choices though. Obviously it's hard to get everything in two hands, but take for example mm. 10-11 the melody of the tune is in the vocal: E E E D E with an ostinato in the strings: E A E E A E E G E E E G E. Your arrangement loses that melody entirely, and awkward splits the ostinato between two hands. I'd consider dropping the ostinato an octave so it sits nicely in the left hand through this whole phrase (especially mm. 13 onwards where your arrangement loses it entirely), raising the vocal an octave from the original to put it on the top of the right hand, and perhaps losing the flute countermelody entirely as IMO it's the least important section there. You can then fill in some of the other lines/chords on the inside of the right hand and the bass in the left hand, getting some of the (celeste, I think? maybe just some sort of synth bells) and oboe in there.\n\nJust in general, I'd try to leave the melody on the top of the arrangement more. m. 57 being another example, where the melody is B A G F but your arrangement has that C on top - it's EXTREMELY difficult to make that sound right when playing, a human can't do that accent in the same fashion as the midi file again.\n\nPlease don't take any of this post the wrong way!

For any arrangement, we can switch the Os and have the same thing - so we only need to count one of the possibilities, meaning we divide by 2 for the Os. The same thing applies for the Ps so we divide by 2 again.\n\nNow what happens if you have *three* of a letter? Let's say we're trying to arrange \"ERROR\". If we have O R1 R2 R3 E, then it's the same as ANY of the Rs with O on the left and E on the right. And how many arrangements of R1, R2, and R3 are there? We already know that - it's 3!! (That's 3 factorial said in an excited tone, not 3 in a very excited tone or 3 factorial factorial.)

{"body": "Theory time!  How many are `every chord ever'?\n\nThere are several groups of chords, based on how many notes they have: \n\n* triads (C E G)\n* 7ths (C E G B)\n* 9ths (C E G B D)\n* 11ths (C E G B D F)\n* 13ths (C E G B D F A)\n\n(There are no 15ths, because that repeats the root note.)\n\n(As an aside, playing the last three groups on guitar, you'll usually omit the notes in-between the base triad and the highest one, for reasons of not having enough fingers.  For example, a common variant of C9 is just C E G D: x 3 2 0 3 0.  The chord `feel' is preserved.)\n\nEach group admits several types of chords, depending on the pitch of the non-root notes.  This stems from the fact that chords may be thought of as a set of intervals from the root note: a triad is a third interval and another third interval (C to E and E to G).  These thirds can be minor or major.\n\nHence, there are four types of triad chords:\n\n* Major (C E G)\n* Minor (C Eb G)\n* Augmented (C E G#)\n* Diminished (C Eb Gb)\n\nAnd there are 8 types of 7th chords, because a 7th chords is three thirds (e.g. C to E, E to G, G to B).\n\nTheoretically, there are 16 types of 9th chords, 32 of 11th chords, and 64 of 13th chords, by the same reasoning.  But here my knowledge (read: skimming of Wikipedia) comes to a halt, because there's some weird stuff at those levels.  So suppose that there are 8 types at each level.\n\nThen there are inversions.  When you move the root note one octave higher, you still have the same chord but with a different feel.  (For example, E G C is a second inversion of C major chord: still recognizable as C but slightly different.  On a guitar a common one is C/G, which is G C E, or third inversion: 3 3 2 0 1 0.)  So a triad has 2 inversions, a 7th has 3, a 9th has 4, and so on.\n\nThen, of course, there are 12 root notes on which all this stuff can be built.\n\nIn addition, once we come to guitar, many chords can be placed in different places of the neck.  (C may be open C-shape, or A-shape barre on third fret, and so on.  CAGED system is helpful here.)  Let's say there are 5 positions of each chord.  \n             \nThere you go for an estimate:\n             \n       positions      7ths            11ths\n    root      triad           9ths            13ths      \n    12 * 5 * (4 * 3 + 8 * 4 + 8 * 5 + 8 * 6 + 8 * 7) = 11280\n\nYou'd need a big poster for that, or small size of each drawn chord.\n\nThat's where [the guitar chord books](http://www.amazon.com/The-Guitar-Chord-Wheel-Book/dp/0793519977) come from.\n\nAs to your second question, more feasible for a poster, you cannot go wrong by reading e.g. [Rooksby's book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Songs-Guitar-Guitar-Playing/dp/0879306114) - it has a good compendium of common chords in the first chapters.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426669022", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[RYM review written on the subject of R23X - OST \\(1\\).rar](https://rateyourmusic.com/collection/tryptavitoxytocin/rating67734143)\n\n- - -\n**VR1161: R23X used ALTERNATE TIMELINE 2000. \"It's super effective!\"**\n\n- - -\nI don’t know what year it was I started wondering about the future, minus that it was post-2000 because I didn’t understand the significance of two-thousand until someone loosely explained it to my seven-year old self on New Year’s Eve, 1999. Then I forgot for a little while again, suppressed an idea of a future altogether, and now am somewhere between living in that future while listening to music reminiscent of an alternate timeline-taken path.\n- - -\nThat’s sort of what vaporwave means to me at its core: the nostalgia is not in-line, not a reality that we lived or even our parents lived, yet somehow we’re experiencing phantom sensations of redolences lived. Maybe atoms are doing odd things, maybe souls are orbiting bodies instead of residing in them, maybe perpendicular orbital shift is about to occur. All I know is that I’m intensely interested in the way that R23X has captured a concept I’ve had for music since I was in middle school. With no imagination, I wondered if music of the future, the mid 2010s, 2014 and 2015 where we sit right now, I wondered if it would sound robotic and laser-y and mechanical in that EVERYTHING IS CHROME IN THE FUTURE-ism, and, very much of it has done so. Outside of vaporwave especially, wonky and cloud rap and glitch this and synth-that, but nothing sounded like what I was hearing in my head. Square Enix core, had I known it. And wouldn’t you know it, here it finally came.\n- - -\nOST (1).rar, a brilliant title to open you up and a video game voice-acting dub to really drive home the fact that this album is playing out of a PS1. PS1 compatible only, I would expect from a physical copy. (A physical copy of a RAR.) God, you know what this record feels like?\n- - -\n*Like* **Y2K** *happened.*\n- - -\nLike there’s an alternate timeline of the planet where it was possible that everything got crisped or twonked or who/when/where knows what, but this would be the music of that dystopia, those Armageddon doomy years of 2002, 2003, 2004, volcanoes ripping through M. Earth’s fair face like zits on an underpaid Dominos team member. No more medicine, ethical and moral erosion in a world that’s been only briefly kissed and fooled around with under the table by its then short-term girlfriend, THE INTERNET. OST (1).rar is all of this, the sort of weird music that would be in a world that never got to progress in technology past the doorstopper of the 20th century.\n- - -\n“Collect EXP and AP” feels as if together a blackened, Nuclear smoked Earth with lethargic inhabitants living in corded-phone homes, where there’s nothing to do all day except swallow all your dead mates’ pharmaceuticals, smoke a few cigarettes (from the pack you ran down to 7/11 and looted from, last week when you nearly got stabbed by the Marlboro Man. Jesus.), and play Playstation and Super Nintendo. You’ve got sixty cartridges for the latter, but only a few RPGs for ol’ Playstation. It’s sufficient.  And there’s Super Mario RPG in the SNES bin so does one need much else at the end of the world? I sank into my bed this morning while having the Y2K ‘’what if’’ daydream, and there was a sort of natural ecstasy that came about me with the other one-two of this affair, lovely “(`･ω･_) ____Really Long Tutorial____” and particularly Akashic “f i e l d 2 (1) .smc”. I think it’s that last one that gives me the chilliest chills and the Netanyahu-iest nettin’ yahoos. Note to self: get a basketball team to name themselves the Nettin’ Yahoos. Note to other self: develop an interest in basketball, because I haven’t cared about it since Space Jam.\n- - -\nThough to be fair, I don’t think this particular node of nostalgia has been properly tapped until bringing OST (1).rar into the third week of my springtime. I’m really grateful to have come on it. I believe there’s a new album coming right out around this time, I wonder how it’ll fare against this clearly cared about, well-rolled throw-in to the vaporwave omnibus.

{"body": "I don't think hardware limitations have anything to do with it. If anything new hardware is just a distraction. The reason ultima 7 is better than skyrim is probably because when you have to spend hours and money making snow effects, cool looking dragons, all that other graphics related stuff that doesn't really improve the gameplay its a lot harder to make a good game. Add in clunky controls and the distraction gets worse. Companies think if they just make it look nice, have \"new\" controls all these stupid cheese tactics the game will be good but its just not true. You have to be smart, you have to do a lot of research, get constant feedback from players, constantly modify things, and play a lot of rival games in order to make an actually good game. Its just easier to think shallow details will help than analyzing decades of video game history to figure out how to actually make a good game. Back in the day you COULDN'T go the shallow route. All games looked like shit instead you had to actually give it depth to make them fun. This \"OH ONCE WE GET MOTION CONTROLS BETTER GAMES WILL BE FUN\" no thats just not true at all. Look at chess, look at well almost every fucking game now, etc they are fun and it has nothing to do with the controllers, it has everything to do with the gameplay and the mental aspects. Of course bad control schemes can make games terrible (press A B B B A UP DOWN RIGHT B to... pause the game) but thats rarely an issue and off topic from motion controls. \n\nIt really annoys me when I see people think controllers will somehow make games better. Think of some shitty games right now. Would actually having to do complex movements instead of pressing a button make it more fun?\n\nGood points about P2W being borne from FTP. The thing is most of the best selling long term games have found a good medium. Look at DOTA2 or league of legends. These games are free, and you don't really get any benefits from spending more money in-game. In LoL you get variety but that isn't nearly the same thing. In fact I'm pretty sure people who pay money to buy champions are worse off. Its way better to only play a few champs and know them well then to unlock a billion and learn none of them well. Point is, games HAVE made it so they can be profitable, while still not being P2W. Its naive and shortsighted for game makers to put in P2W mechanics, not a single hugely popular long lasting game is P2W. Its a short term strategy that doesn't work once players realize whats happening. Pay to grind less, pay for variety, pay for time saving(like teleport scrolls or mounts), and pay for cosmetics work extremely well for games that actually are good games, going P2W isn't required. Look at diablo 3, before they got rid of the auction house (which was very p2w) the game was dying and hated. \n\nA game can't be perfectly balanced, and slight imbalance can even make it more fun (some people like playing as underdog characters for example). But often, it can just absolutely ruin the game play. It can destroy the pvp scene especially in MMOs. Lets say you start a game, you pick a class, and later on you decide to try pvp. Turns out your class is extremely shitty for pvp and you have a miserable time, and your options are: quit pvp or make a new character. MMOs are specifically designed to take forever to level up characters or builds (which IMO is actually something holding them back) so I think more often than not people just quit. Its also just extremely boring when your options are lose constantly, or play a very very few amount of characters. In general playing exceptionally weak completely nonviable characters just sucks. And it sucks that you have no idea your character is terrible unless you go out of your way to check tier lists before you even start the game. The feeling of \"I can play what ever and however I want and still have fun and be viable\" is important to maintain and most MMOs don't and it just ruins the immersion and makes the game overall seem cheap and stupid. \n\nHaving a terrible end game means not having much to do, or having things to do that are just not enjoyable. It also means having horrible progression. \"Oh I have to play this boring dungeon.... A THOUSAND TIMES... before I can do the cool other one wtf?\" \"Oh I have to just get raped in pvp for weeks before I can get gear to even start playing really and be measured for my skills.\" But that's entering grinding territory. Really the key is you need to have fun stuff to do end game and a lot of games just don't have fun stuff, or require too much boring stuff before the fun stuff. \n\nThe asians I know hate grinding too. I'm pretty sure everyone dislikes it itself (how killing 10000 rabbits one at a time fun?) but what they like is usually the reward, not the grinding itself. They also like the idea that more time/effort= more reward. Grinding works when you are improving and the gameplay is changing at a good pace, but some games just think killing 1000 rabbits and then killing 1000 pigs and then killing 1000 slightly bigger rabbits makes a good game. In fact the entire quest-grind structure just seems terrible to me. GW2 tried to improve on it, but it was really the same terrible structure. Most gamers I know go through the quest grind to get to the fun dungeons etc. Why not just make a game with only the fun dungeons etc? Why spend all that money making all those quests that no one wants to play and are just going through it to get to the \"fun part\". Look at the dark souls series. You could easily make an MMO with a dark souls feel especially instance heavy ones, DS even already has multiplayer grouping and pvp. But the point is in DS you run around exploring, and the game is quite lengthy and feels huge. It wouldn't be hard to make a bigger version and make it an MMO. Get rid of quests, and instead have actual exploration and less hand holding retardedness. \n\nI agree that the \"everyone is doing it\" kind of ruins the mood. However, a lot of MMOs make it work by requiring the group aspect. Seems crazy for a person to solo a super w/e on their own but teaming up with 5-20 people to do it feels epic. Also there are just a billion story elements you can put in to make things enjoyable in the MMO structure. Dragon Nest actually has some hilarious and some really emotional quest lines. Example: You meet an invisible NPC who is sad because he is invisible and it makes him super lonely and unable to socialize or get friends and hes constantly just ignored. You gather items and stuff for him to try and make him visible, but they all fail. Then you can't find him in his normal hang out spot and when I was playing this actually bothered me a lot since NPCs always kinda just stand there in the game. Then you hear hes gonna go and commit suicide. You have a quest to find and stop him and there is a boss in that level against hot female elves. You are too late but then it turns out he decided not to do it because on his way there he saw the hot elves realized he can just be a total perv and spy on girls all the time super easy thanks to invisibility. So ya save guys life by helping him find out he could joy life being a peeping tom. There are A LOT of other absolutely hilarious quests, and some tear jerkers too in that game . Point is, you're saying oh its hard to put story in MMOs but its not, its just as easy as putting a story in any other game, and plenty of games do it. But MMO creators are too focused on retarded shit to pay any mind to something like story. \n\nAnyway your english is great. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426702965", "subreddit": "MMORPG", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I havent watched yet but I will when I get  chance however. It doesn't really matter since you were effectively stomping (at least by the graph it seems that way) but, their team is not a strong candidate for dagon pickup. A shivas Orchid Sheep, Linkens, forcestaff(breaks ult as well as other utility), necronomicon, ethblade (ghost first obviously), or a BKB, would have all been much stronger pickups. Honestly aghs is a good way to secure a game as well. \n\n\nAlso a lot of pros have been prioritizing silence level 4 over orb level 4 (so q w/e q w/e q r w w w q r etc) reason being that static laning should be done by this level and orb is a better laning tool but silence is a better gank/teamfight tool (well leveling it is more effective). Also the experience to get to 8 from 7 is significantly smaller than 8 -&gt;9 so you would rather have an extra second of silence than a bit more damage. I would suggest trying it out.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426718770", "subreddit": "analysemydota2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think you are incredibly mistaken. There are WAY too many issues that would present itself and make this impossible. People on here seem to want to use diablo as a comparison, when that isn't even remotely close to how league works. \n\nLets look at a basic control scheme. You have four skills. So what do you bind those to? Face buttons? Then movement on left stick and aim on right stick? Then how do you aim them if you have your thumb pressing the A B X Y buttons? So lets try them on LB, RB, RT, LT. But now how do you ctrl cast, alt cast, attack move, attack move click, stop, champion only select, etc? You do not have enough buttons.\n\nThen you have the issues with how the different skill shots work. What do you do with targeted abilities? What about the ones that work in relation to where you mouse is (yasuo Q, karthus Q)? You cant just have them cast on the nearest enemy because that would require a complete rework of a large pool of champions, and a complete overhaul of how almost every skill in the game works in general. Do you honestly seem them reworking every single champion to work with a control scheme that isnt viable? They don't even balance champions in relationship to the various gametypes they already offer in the game other than for 5s matches and a few item tweaks for 3s.\n\nThere's nothing you can viably change to make this happen on consoles. This is a PC game, if you want to play the game, get a PC (the game doesnt require much to run tbh). You guys are making up a rumor that its going to be on the Xbox console and trying to argue how it would work **when it would not work, and will never happen, ever**\n\nOther mobas? Maybe. Smite works because the controls in that game can be easily translated to a controller. A fast paced moba that requires mechanical skill relative to a mouse and keyboard and is completely balanced around that one control scheme will never see its face on this console. **Period.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426734926", "subreddit": "xboxone", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Not really.  That's my point.  There are literally only 2 whole tone scales.\n\nC D E F# G# A# C\n\nand\n\nDb Eb F G A B Db\n\nI mean, sure, you get to start in different places, but that's more similar to playing modal scales.  You can start your C major scale on D, but notes don't change.  Same idea with whole tone scales which don't really have a home.\n\nSame idea applies to dim7 arpeggios.\n\nAn Ebdim7 arpeggio is just the first inversion of a Cdim7 arpeggio.  They literally have the exact same notes.\n\nAn E augmented triad is just an inversion of a C+.\n\nI'm not knocking the exercise.  I think it's great.  I'm just saying picking different starting places for this particular exercise is relatively less complicated than many other similar types of exercises where you would very legitimately have 12 starting places that have you play through 12 unique keys.\n\nLet's say you were doing a ii-V-I arpeggio exercise, just using 7ths, then you really have a complicated exercises in 12 keys with a billion permutations.  You can play all arpeggios ascending, or play up the ii chord, down the V chord, up the I chord.  Even then, what starting note do you choose for your V chord.  Do you go up from the 7th of ii to the 5th of the V or down to the 3rd of the V?  Now the same exercise but adding 9ths.   That's a very useful, but very difficult exercise that lacks the symmetry of something like whole tone scales.\n\nI still like his exercise though, and especially like the idea of going from different starting points.  A good way to make his exercise more complicated would be to start at different intervals.  Like, don't go around by half-steps, but instead jump by 4ths one day, minor thirds another, etc.  And try to keep the exercise in time so that you're thinking ahead to the next starting point while you're finishing up the previous one.  It's that sort of thing that sinks me all the time when doing scales or scale patterns this way.  C major up, F major down, Bb major up, Eb major down, etc.  Actually 4ths are easy.  It's things like major and minor thirds that catch me because the odd enharmonics mess with your head.\n\nFor example, in major thirds you'd have C then E, then G# (then technically B#, but it's C).  But we're more comfortable thinking about our Ab scale... not our G# scale.  But when you're trying to think in quick thirds, that's what comes next.  Same when you jump around to D then F# then A#.\n\nSeems simple when you can read it and think about it, but try to put the horn on your face and keep straight time while doing scales in those keys and suddenly your brain melts a little.  Super awesome exercise though.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426747452", "subreddit": "trumpet", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**C H A P T E R _ S I X**.EXE\n\n    Six Months Later...\n\nCass and I had just come back from our honeymoon. The project had been chugging along without us for the weeks we were away, and while we were more than happy to bask in each other for a little longer, both of us were far too curious to see what advances the team had made in our absence.\n\nAlas, fate was to have a hand in this as well, keeping us from learning the fate of the project; but the reason for our continued absence was a happy one. Cass had gone into labor, and our child would be born any time now. We rushed to the hospital, calling the office on the way.\n\nTime passed, and I was by Cass's side until the doctors made me leave. I returned every day until the time finally came.When it happened, I was in the shower at the house we shared. I nearly leapt out of the shower and scrambled for the phone, and upon answering, was greeted by the voice of the doctor, telling me that I needed to get there as soon as possible. Had I not felt a draft, I probably would have rushed out of the house stark naked, I was so dumbfounded and happy.\n\nWhen I arrived, the birth was already underway, but the nurse let me past so that I could be there at the miracle moment. A girl. We had a beautiful, healthy baby daughter. One day, I knew, I was going to be scaring the ever-loving hell out of the boys who would inevitably come to take her out, but for today... For today, she was our perfect jewel, the miracle we had made.\n\n**C H A P T E R _ S E V E N**.EXE\n\n    Six Months Later...\n\nCorrection, the *first* miracle we had made. The second was the first large-scale prototype of the full-dive system. Primate tests, then human. The final steps towards the realization of my life's work. *Our* work. Our other baby, the one we shared with the other guys and girls at the office.\n\n\"Jim...\" Cass said flatly, as we began to prepare for the first primate subject. \"This is a big step, are you sure the system is ready?\"\n\n I still wasn't sure Cass or I should have returned to work so soon, even at reduced hours. She was still drained from childbirth and a terrifying near-death experience shortly thereafter, and we both had Gwen to worry about. But the project was nearly every bit as important to us both as anything else in our lives, and we trusted Lucy, the babysitter we had hired as a live-in, with our lives, or rather the life of our little girl. I foolishly attributed her apprehension to deflecting her worries about Gwen onto a more present issue.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" I replied, comforting her the best I could. \"PriSub 1 is ready, and we've extensively modeled all the possible outcomes, there's an infinitesimal margin for failure. Your code is good, and we checked all the equipment a dozen times.\"\n\nShe made an uncertain sound, but nodded and signaled the beginning of the test. I should have listened to her concerns. Primate Subject 1 didn't make it more than 15 seconds into the simulation.\n\nOver the next month, we tweaked everything we possibly could, and when we were satisfied there was nothing more we could do without further input, we sent PriSub 2 into the simulation. She made it, and seemed every bit as lively as before the test. Joe believed we were ready for human testing, but regulations required further control testing to ensure PriSub 2's survival wasn't a fluke.\n\n**C H A P T E R _ E I G H T**.EXE\n\n  One Month Later...\n\nWe should have been more cautious. We should have kept an eye on Joe, fired him when he began to become erratic. Maybe then, he would still be alive today.\n\nWe found Joe Martinez in the full-dive lab, on December 18, 2036. Dead, with his head in the full-dive helmet. He had been convinced that human testing was the next step, and that we were ready to take that step. When we disagreed, he had taken it upon himself to become the first human subject.\n\nAcute sensory overload. Just like the first four rats, just like PriSub 1. Far from the most pleasant way to go; every inch of your body at once in exquisite pleasure and agonizing pain. We held a service for him, and his sacrifice was not in vain. We were able to use the brain scans from his brief time in the environment to determine exactly where the system was wrong for a brain as complex as *homo sapiens*. Thanks to Joseph Martinez, we knew how to perfect the process.\n\nWe renamed the lab in his honor; the Joseph Martinez Memorial Laboratory. In its confines, we worked through the night, striving to complete the process so that no more sacrifices like Joe's, like Theseus's, would have to be made. Lucy watched over Gwen, when we should have been there. We should have been there for our little girl. Our jewel. Our angel.\n\n**C H A P T E R _ N I N E**.EXE\n\n    Two Months Later...\n\nA triumph at the lab. We had successfully made the technology ready for official human testing, though regulations still dictated we do further tests with slightly less-complex creatures first.\n\nOn the day of that breakthrough, we got the call.\n\nLucy called from our house. Apparently Gwen had somehow gotten the upstairs window open, and fallen out. Landed on the frozen-over pool, and split her head open. Paramedics had pronounced her dead on the scene.\n\nNot even a year old, with literally her entire life ahead of her... cut short by a faulty window latch and a sheet of ice. No one ever said the world was kind, especially to those consumed by obsession... but our angel... Our perfect little girl... Gone.\n\nWe grew apart, distant, both of us throwing ourselves wholly into our work. Anything that kept us from thinking about her. About how we would never hear her laugh, see the little twinkle in her eyes (so like her mother's) when she smiled... Never see her take her first steps, hear her first words... Never watch her grow up, never worry when a boy comes to ask her out... Never walk her down the aisle...\n\nWithin six more months, the project was ready for human testing. There were many volunteers, but in the end, my own application caught the eye of the council we had selected for impartiality. In the meantime, Cass and I had divorced, we had grown too apart to ever believe we could make it work anymore, and neither of us was sure we wanted to, when we both knew we'd only remind each other of Gwen. I had nothing left to live for in the real world, beyond the success of the project.\n\nAnd so I was selected, and so I entered the simulation.\n\n**C H A P T E R _ T E N**.EXE\n\n    Present Day...\n\n\"Cass...\" I stumbled over my words as everything came rushing back. \"My God, Cass... I was so blind...\"\n\n\"Sir?\" She pretended to not notice that I had used her first name, but I saw it in her eyes. In the tears which had begun to form in the corners...\n\n\"Cass... Running away from everything wasn't the answer.\" I selected \"Exit to Reality\" on the screen, took off the helmet, and stood up. \"We lost it all once, and we both were too afraid to try again. At least you kept yourself grounded in reality, I was the idiot who threw himself into the fantasy world.\"\n\n\"Jim... What are you...?\" The tears were rolling down her cheeks now, and I reached out to wipe them away. She pulled away, but then allowed my hand to touch her face. Even with the grief and despair written all over it, it... she... was still beautiful.\n\n\"Cassandra Jones... Cassandra Gordon...\" I stumbled over which name to use, the last I had heard she had gone back to using her maiden name, but to me, she was still Cassandra Gordon, my wife, though estranged of late.\n\nShe smiled through the tears, when I said the name we had once shared. \"Y-yes?\" Her smile, though sad, was the most beautiful sight I had seen in a long time, and that included the double-sunrises in the simulated world.\n\n\"I'd... That is, if it's alright with you...\" I was still stumbling, fumbling for the right words.\n\n\"Go on...\" My God, those warm, calming eyes of hers... I knew, looking into those eyes, that I would regret *not* saying this more than I ever would regret saying it even if it went wrong.\n\n\"What I'm trying to say is... I'd like to give it... *us*... another go. If you'd...\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she smiled, tears flowing freely, but tears now of happiness. \"But let's do it right this time, alright?\"\n\n**E N D**  \n?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426749667", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Its not like they are just fucking pushing Up up down down a b a b select start to get coins that EA can stop.  The farmers are physically modifying their console hardware and sending them edited packet data back.  The best thing they did to combat this was set 75 games per day limit so people cant just spam games like they do now.  But it doesnt stop the problem because you can make tens of thousands of accounts off of one FIFA game disc.  It just slows them down because now they have to switch accounts every 75 games.  \n\nPrice bands and this are realistically the only way to stop them.  Its not about stopping coin glitching, its about making it economically infeasible.  If it costs them more time than its worth they will instead go spend those resources coin farming another online game.\n\nRealistically i think they could get rid of Price bands if they do a few things: Every FIFA game comes with a Key to activate your FUT account, so only 1 account per game.  Coin sellers arent going to spend $60+ for a game copy when they get banned so frequently.  And keep the 75 game limit in place.

{"body": "First off, sorry for my weird way of explaining things, I'm a dirty foreigner.   \n\nI don't know what it's called in English, but we use the term *metningstone*. The literal translation would be *fill tone*, i.e a tone which adds to the sound of a chord without changing it's fundamental function (e.g. major 7 and 9 on the tonic).\n\nWell, there is an easy way to find these intervals using (what we call) the principle of fill tones. This is that you find the fill tones by adding a triad one diatonic step up from wherever you are. We use this on...quadrants (we use the term firklang. A four-note chord. 1,3,5,7)?\nIf I use G major as tonic like you, we get:\n\nI:Gmaj7: Add an A triad; G B D F# A C# E (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, #11, 13)  \n  \nii:Am7: Bm triad; A C E G B D F# (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13)  \n\nAnd so on. If you're in minor you get different triads using the same principle. On a Am7(b5) you get a Bm(b5), so A C Eb G B D F. You can use any of these intervals without it sounding too far out! It also works on dominants, but you can do a thousand other things on them as well.\n\nIf you put the two chords together in one octave you get a scale! on Gmaj7 you get G lydian (G A B C# D E F#), on Am7 you get A dorian (A B C D E F# G), on Am7(b5) you get the cool half-whole scale (A B C D Eb F G)\nHope this helps!

The instrumental section at the end feels a bit lost.\n\nA B C A B C A \n\nThat seems to be your song structure. This song needs an anchor, often compositions use a chorus as that.

You sound like Muse, but you really have to go for it. The song itself needs a lot more oomf. The ending needs a bit of help as well, either in a bigger way or a smaller way.

The D and F sections sound similar, but I couldn't tell in the couple listens through whether they were exactly the same. The B section is the strongest. Though I am a fan of linear song structures, I would suggest you incorporate that in some sort of repetition, perhaps not as a traditional chorus, but more as bookends to the intro and outro of the song.\n\nIts a good start.

He usually does good as long as he is against a squishy support, but really bad if they have a tanky one.\n\nI like him mid, since you'll usually end up against a squishy that can be forced to back off from a single E Q Q Q combo. You have the range to harass them under turret and farm from the safety of your own too. Being near turrets is good as it gives you a bunch of Ult potential\n\nTop is okay, though I'm not a huge fan of it. The enemy top laner is usually someone that can out sustain you and scales much better into late game. He's really good against most of the champions that try to snowball really hard though, like Riven and Darius, and also against any squishies (since you can E Q Q Q and they have to back off).\n\nI usually try to play Urgot like Jayce, as an AD mage, so I wouldn't really get tri-force or IBG. He has 1000-1200 range + ~8 seconds of 40% slow + one of the highest AD scaling abilities in the game, getting close enough to AA isn't something you should really build towards unless their team is like Irelia + J4 + Kassadin(old) + Sivir + Blitz, where you will be forced into AA range, and quite frankly shouldn't have picked Urgot anyway. Go IBG if you have to, since it is a better tank / CC item.\n\nHe works best when your team could use long range AD damage, a way to catch people out, a team comp that can end the game in 20 minutes.

(Choice p, Applicative f) =&gt; p a (f b) -&gt; p s (f t)\n\nBut if you define a function that then takes an optic:\n\n    below :: Traversable f =&gt; Prism s a -&gt; Prism' (f s) (f a)\n\nthat function now has a rank-2 type:\n\n    below :: (Traversable f, Choice q, Applicative h) \n      =&gt; (forall p g. (Choice p, Applicative f) =&gt; p a (g a) -&gt; p s (g s))\n      -&gt; q (f a) (h (f a)) -&gt; q (f s) (h (f s))                        \n\nThis means that type inference goes out the window.\n\nAPrism, ALens, etc. are a trick. They are about finding a concrete choice of `f` and `p` in the types above that capture all the information about the Lens or Prism in question.\n\n    type APrism s t a b = Market a b a (Identity b) -&gt; Market a b s (Identity t)\n    data Market a b s t = Market (b -&gt; t) (s -&gt; Either t a)\n\nNow, below expands to a rank-1 type!\n\n    below :: (Traversable f, Choice q, Applicative h)\n      =&gt; (Market a a a (Identity a) -&gt; Market a a s (Identity s)\n      -&gt; q (f a) (h (f a)) -&gt; q (f s) (h (f s))\n\nAnd we can reconstitute a prism from APrism:\n\n    cloneLens :: ALens s t a b -&gt; Lens s t a b\n    closeTraversal :: ATraversal s t a b -&gt; Traversal s t a b\n    clonePrism :: APrism s t a b -&gt; Prism s t a b\n\netc.\n\nA first order consequence of this trick, is that it reduces the combinator to rank-1, _vastly_ improving type inference.\n\nIn other places in `lens` we generalize this trick. Instead of asking for a choice of `p` or `f` that fully characterizes all lenses or traversals, we ask for a particular choice that is _just enough_ for what we need.\n\nThis lets the combinators in `lens` do deeply fancy things, like work with no constraints when given a lens, but ask you for a Monoid instance when given a Traversal. This maximizes the number of situations we can use the same combinator set in, while simultaneously ensuring that inference \"just works\". It achieves this by leaking a little bit of information into the type signature you'd think we wouldn't want to leak, and in exchange you the lens combinator \"judo flips\" you into asking yourself for a class constraint, while remaining delightfully simple.\n\nIs this idiomatic Haskell? Not really. It never set out to be: I wanted a reusable vocabulary for getting into and manipulating structures that I'd still be using a couple of years out. Here were are a couple of years later, and the vocabulary is still being used, and new uses for the parts are still being discovered, so that part of the mission appears to be successful. ;)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426877952", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey everyone! It's the weekend!!!\n\n**Damn We Are Good:** This team is sort of mixed. It's streaky. They can either lose, or just demolish the opposing team. They beat eXcess Gaming a few days ago in 2-0 fashion, winning Cache 16-11 and then shredding eXcess on Overpass 16-1. This team is loads of potential, and robby, f0bless and fabiaN are great when put together, and they have big potential to put points up on the board for their team. karbonmayne and SalmO have a chance to pull something too, but the three listed earlier are more frequent in producing these big numbers. Now, this team is anything but streaky in ESEA. They went 15-1 in their league. If they can play to the caliber of this ESEA performance, they could be able to take this.\n\n**Boots2Asses:** Somewhat close to CLG, Boots2Asses is an up and coming team that seems good in skill, but with a somewhat new team, there's always bound to be issues regarding teamwork. Two of these guys are straight out of CLG, (TaRiK is *the* tarik, right? correct me if I'm wrong) and that can already make for some good team play. I also know that wigg knows Lucky and the gang pretty well and maybe that could give it a little boost as well. rooRoo, I'm not too sure, maybe he knows them, if so, this could boost it as well. Maybe teamwork isn't the worst issue, maybe it is. It's tough to say. In my opinion, I think that could be the biggest fear for B2A. B2A edged out W E D E M B O Y Z a few days ago, 2-1 with a 16-14 win on Mirage, a 14-16 loss on Cache, and a 16-11 win on Overpass. They seem to be taking it easy. But, if the stars on this team come out to play, B2A could get it quick. (P.S. Love ya wigg)\n\n**EDIT:** The game mentioned was without ptr and tarik. Keep that in mind.\n\n**HEAD TO HEAD:** My pick is B2A, but it will probably be close here. This B2A team is sort of fresh out of the box and might still be getting used to the callouts, but skillwise, B2A should have it, even though DWG is full with potential. It will be close, but I think B2A will get this one.\n\n**LIKELY ODDS:** This is a 65-35 for B2A I think.\n\n**BET:** I would skip, but a small on B2A with these odds wouldn't be a horrible idea.\n\nBe back later with another analysis! Have a good Saturday afternoon!\n\n*If you have questions/comments about my analysis, feel free to PM me!*\n\n**EDIT 2:** Adjusted odds\n**EDIT 3:** ptr taken out", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1426965992", "subreddit": "csgobetting", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

A bunch of mantles aren't needed on Pugna, because he has a huge int gain. Your early damage isn't too shabby either, but if you for some reason want damage, just go Null, because it provides some health too.\n\nAquila is kind of eh on Pugna, because the agi isn't too useful on him. It's not enough for meaningful amounts of armor, and that's the only reason Pugna would want it.\n\nYou can go Arcanes Mek if you want (Or Brown Boots Mek, given Pugna's mana pool is huge). Mek enables better deathpushing, which is where Pugna excels. BKB, Agh's, Bloodstone, Eul's, Scythe, are all viable options from there.\n\nSkillbuild is usually q w/e q e/w q r q e e e r w w w stats r.

{"body": "It doesn't scale well for you early game. The movespeed buff becomes much better later after you have a Eul's.  Putting more points into it early doesn't really help much when you're mana pool is lower and damage is lower.  My usual skill build is...\n\nW E Q Q Q R Q W W W R E E E stats R stats on out...\n\nI like to rush a Eul's scepter, even before mana boots.  I'll get boots of speed, maybe a Null talisman, and then go straight for Eul's.  It's very helpful in setting up your stun and gives you extra movespeed, damage, and mana that she needs.  At level 11 with maxed Q and W with 2 points in the ult, that's usually enough to go up to get a solo kill by Eul's them up, time the stun, fire breath, and then ult.  That usually is enough to take them out.\n\nI've tried build her for right click damage but it's just not been as effective for me.  Once I try that combo above, the kill usually isn't secured since the lower stun time and damage from Q and W, and then I just end up getting counter initiated on and die.\n\nIf played correctly, Lina shouldn't have to right click anyway though.  All she really needs to be effective in any role is a Eul's and blink.  Blink on the target, Eul's up, and your team should be right there ready to clean up once you land your stun.

This means the back row of Xs can't shoot at any of Os units, while the back row of Os units can free be adding in dps to the front lines of Xs units. As units from the front lines of X die, more units filter into the fight in one of two ways, either filling in space left by their dead comrades or wasting time walking around the edge of the fight to get into firing range. Either way, because the units ability to contribute their offensive stats to the fight is limited by factors other than just their pure dps, you can't really just crank out the math and decide how many age 2 muskets it takes to beat age 3 muskets.

{"body": "[Here](http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoap/1177005705) is the peer-reviewed research paper behind the claim (google \"bayer diaconis 92\" if the link doesn't work)  For those not wanting to read a 20 page statistics paper let me summarize.\n\nThey are using a [riffle shuffle](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=riffle+shuffle&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=XbAOVfPPB8G68gXOioCoDA), roughly splitting the deck into a top and bottom half and leafing the cards together.\n\nThe formula they give to work out number of shuffles is [3/2*log2(n)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3%2F2*log2%2852%29) where n is the number of cards in the deck. A 52 card poker deck takes 8 and a half shuffles according to this.\n\nOn page 17 of the paper they have and way for you to test it yourself. Take a deck of cards and fully sort it, make an ordered list of these cards (excel is easier than hand writing). Riffle shuffle, now look at your list and find the biggest consecutive group of cards. The first card in that list is your guess for the top card, go through the whole deck doing this. With ten cards shuffled one time it would look like this:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10: You Guess 1 Correct\n \nX 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10: You Guess 2\n\nX 2 3 4 X 6 7 8 9 10: You Guess 6 \n\nX X 3 4 X 6 7 8 9 10: You Guess 6 Correct\n\nX X 3 4 X X 7 8 9 10: You Guess 7 Correct\n\nX X 3 4 X X X 8 9 10: You Guess 8 Correct \n\nX X 3 4 X X X X 9 10: You Guess 3\n\nX X 3 4 X X X X X 10: You Guess 3\n\nX X 3 4 X X X X X  X : You Guess 3 Correct\n\nX X X 4 X X X X X  X : You Guess 4 Correct\n\nWith a 'perfectly' randomized 52 card deck you should average around 4.5 correct guesses. With an ordered deck and one shuffle you'll get around 31 correct guess; shuffling twice will be around 19.5 correct; with five shuffles 6.5 correct and with seven shuffles 5.0 correct. \n\nThe randomness of these decks is mostly good enough though not perfect. [here](http://arvanzuijlen.people.wm.edu/NewAgeS.pdf) is another paper talking about how shuffling this way actually gives you a 30% better chance of winning New Age Solitaire. Though as New Age Solitaire is a sorting game designed to by another mathematician to fuck with this shuffling it's not really applicable to poker or blackjack or MtG. Essentially if you start with two suits, one sorted Ace to King and the Other King to Ace, shuffle them and then try to sort them both into Ace to King piles. The suit that started as Ace to King will be fully sorted before the King to Ace suit most times.\n\n**tl;dr** Yes riffle shuffling a 52 card deck seven+ times will give you a deck that is random enough. However don't riffle decks of cards you care about, bending them will wear them out faster. And don't let magicians shuffle your decks, you don't know where their hands have been. \n\nEdited for spacing", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427034016", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hi, I'm a linguist. \n\nWhat you just discovered is called \"phonotactics\". Sounds change depending on what sounds are nearby them. The particular phenomenon is *nasal assimilation*. English has three nasal sounds, \"m\", \"n\", and \"ng\", and they all sound almost identical. If you cover your mouth and say one of them, nobody will be able to know which you were saying because they're all so similar. So, for this reason, when we speak, we often just use the one that is more convenient. \n\nWhen you have a nasal sound followed by a plosive (p b t d k g), you almost always use the nasal that's pronounced in the same place as the plosive that is to follow. Thus, *i(m)put*, *intolerant*, and *in(g)concievable*. \n\nRemember, **Orthography is NOT language**. Writing is an imperfect system that approximates language, but it is an invention.

{"body": "Hey Adam, I wasn't around here when you first posted, and I'm not sure if I have any real authority to offer some CC, but I will leave it here and you can take it if you want.\n\nFirst, the first time we see \"design\" its spelled incorrectly lol \nScrolling quickly up and down I see a bit of discontinuity in widths and sizes. I am currently viewing your site on Chrome on a 13\" screen with the window open 100%. What I noticed was that the About Me blurbs spans almost the whole width while (currently) the portfolio icons are only about 60-70% with a poor eyballing estimate lol If you could make those more equal I think it would translate into better uniformity and a nicer flow for your whole page.\nI did do some testing though, and re-adjusted my window size. I noticed that your blurb adjusted with me, but the icon sizes remained fixed and thus pushed one down below the other. I would look into perhaps letting them be scalable as well. This would be helpful for smaller viewing screens and mobile devices. \nI don't know if it's just because it's a work-in-progress, but this applies to the text layout of the About Me portion. Experiment with different fonts/heading combinations and also look into kerning (adjust spacing between individual characters), tracking (adjust spacing between a group of letters -- ie. reddit --&gt; r e d d i t), and leading (adjust vertical spacing between lines of text). I have noticed that these 3 principles of typography can really take an amateur attempt and give it some extra oomph.

String.split(s, \" \")\n      this will transform our string into a list of strings. I.E: \"A A T\" -&gt; [\"A\", \"A\", \"T\"] \n\n    f = fn s -&gt; String.split(s) |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;(%{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[&amp;1])&lt;&gt;\" \")\n\n    - This is where things get a little weird, bear with me. |&gt; is an operator that passes what's\n      on it's left, as the leftmost argument to the function on it's right. Enum.map is a function\n      from the Enum module that takes an Enumerable and a function as arguments. Here's an\n      idea of what's really happening:\n\n      String.split(\"A\", \"A\") -&gt; Enum.map([\"A\", \"A\"], &amp;(%{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[&amp;1])&lt;&gt;\" \")\n\n      As you can see, the result of invoking split is the leftmost argument in our Enum.map call.\n      Yes, that weird looking thing on the right is a function. The function is called on every element\n      of our list and the result of the function is added to the front of a new list. Let's examine our function!\n\n      &amp;(%{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[&amp;1])\n\n      This is shorthand for writing an anonymous function, the function body is inside of the\n      parenthesis. Let's look at a simpler example before we dissect this:\n\n      &amp;(&amp;1 + &amp;2)\n\n      All that this means is that we have a function that takes two, unnamed parameters. In fact,\n      you can invoke it in place, you don't even need to bind it to a variable.\n\n      (&amp;(&amp;1 + &amp;2)).(1, 2) translates to &amp;(1 + 2) which results in 3.\n\n      Okay, that little tangent should make the next part a little more clear. In our function,\n      %{} denotes a map or a dictionary.\n\n      %{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}\n\n      This is some pretty standard stuff, the string \"A\" maps to \"T\", \"T\" to \"A\" and so forth.\n      The more interesting part is look up. You can use square brackets to look up keys and\n      get values. For example..\n\n      %{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[\"A\"] -&gt; \"T\"\n      %{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[\"C\"] -&gt; \"G\"\n\n      Okay, now let's put it all to use:\n\n      Enum.map([\"A\", \"A\"], &amp;(%{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[&amp;1])&lt;&gt;\" \")\n\n      [(\"A\"), \"A\"] -&gt; &amp;(%{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[\"A\"]) -&gt; \"T\" &lt;&gt; \" \" -&gt; [\"T \"]\n      [(\"A\")] -&gt; &amp;(%{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[\"A\"]) -&gt; \"T\" &lt;&gt; \" \" -&gt; [\"T \", \"T \"]\n      [] -&gt; [\"T \", \"T \"] #Function called on all elements of list, returns new list\n\n      You probably already noticed but the &lt;&gt; operator is just string concatenation. I'm\n      just appending a space to result of calling our function on an element of the list. We're at\n      the very end, let's finish this off.\n\n    f=fn s-&gt;String.split(s)|&gt;Enum.map(&amp;(%{\"A\"=&gt;\"T\",\"T\"=&gt;\"A\",\"G\"=&gt;\"C\",\"C\"=&gt;\"G\"}[&amp;1])&lt;&gt;\" \")|&gt;to_string end\n\n    - Here we have the |&gt; operator again, we pass list we received from Enum.map to the\n      to_string method. Here's what's actually happening:\n\n      to_string([\"T \", \"T \"])\n\n      All this does is flatten the list and concatenate all of the strings.\n\n      [\"T \", \"T \"] |&gt; to_string -&gt; \"T T \"\n\n      And that's it! Here's what the full transformation of data looks like:\n\n      f.(\"A A\") #Invoking our function, we named it \"f\" at the beginning, remember?\n      \"A A\" -&gt; [\"A\", \"A\"] -&gt; [\"T \", \"T \"] -&gt; \"T T \"\n\n\n     \n\n    \n\n     \n     \n      \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427073246", "subreddit": "dailyprogrammer", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Honestly I know exactly how you feel. I didn't learn how to speak in Sinhala until I was 4 because my parents wanted me to have a better grasp of English before I learned my native tongue. Let's just say that my vacations in Sri Lanka went from me being completely ignored by my cousins (since they couldn't speak English) to me being mocked and ridiculed by E V E R Y O N E because my accent was strong and my Sinhala was broken. Luckily though my parents saw me trying hard enough and I ended up taking Sinhala classes and learned how to read and write, plus I started communicating with my parents in Sinhala more as opposed to English. Do I still get ridiculed and laughed at for my accent? Yes. Do I still have a hard time pronouncing certain words? Of course. But I managed to get everyone to shut the fuck up once they realized that I can read and write. All I can say is, it's never too late to start learning how to speak Hindi and Gujarati. There's plenty of online resources like Duolingo that can help you get started, and if you're in college you can take an introductory course on Hindi and go from there. Watch more Hindi/Gujarati movies, pay attention and pick up bits and pieces from conversations around you that are in those languages. Lastly, don't ever, EVER let anyone tear you down for not speaking in Hindi and Gujarati. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427092655", "subreddit": "ABCDesis", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Others I remember. I'll just add on. I'm not going to go into really ancient territory, but from what I've seen since I started Dota (6.57b) till about 2 years ago, which is when I assume a lot of redditors started.\n\n* Troll's Ult was called Rampage and was a move/attack speed buff for only himself. Lasted 30 seconds on a 55 second cooldown. Whirling Axes used to be an autocastable unit target ability, Blind, which, well... blinded the enemy, giving them a miss chance. Replaced with the melee/ranged Whirling Axes we know today.\n\n* Centaur's Ult used to give him a massive amount of strength. Replaced with Stampede.\n\n* Treant used to have Eyes in the Forest (today's Aghs upgrade) but instead of targeting a tree, you used to plant a new one. Replaced with Sentinel, which basically was a ward that you could destroy to do damage and stun to the closest hero in the area. Replaced with Leech Seed now. Living armor for a while was global (albeit only in the day) and passive. Before that it wasn't damage block, it just gave armor and regen. \n\n* Pudge's Flesh Heap used to not be for only heroes, but creeps as well. Farming creeps to get strength was a legit strat to tank up.\n\n* Tide's Anchor Smash used to be passive, with a chance to do damage in an area around him on attack.\n\n* Bounty Hunter's Jinada used to be a clone of Brewmaster's Crit/Evasion skill.\n\n* Sniper's Shrapnel used to be Scattershot, an instant nuke in an area. It dealt piercing damage and was good to farm creeps.\n\n* Naga's Riptide used to be a crit. Since illusions can crit, it worked quite well. Song used to be static (it didn't used to follow you, if someone entered the area after you used it, they'd be awake).\n\n* Razor had a big rework. Plasma Field used to be Chain Lightning (stronger Zeus Q), and he had Frenzy (Mask of Madness). Eye of the Storm used to be passive and hit a random unit in an area every couple of seconds. I learnt the hard way it hit invisible units too. :P The biggest change was that they changed his autoattack projectile color from red to blue. Red lightning was the shit.\n\n* Viper had the same skill Frenzy as Razor in place of Nethertoxin. \n\n* Medusa had the same skill Chain Lightning as Razor instead of Mystic Snake. Stone Gaze used to be Purge (basically Diffusal Blade charge).\n\n* Nyx's Carapace used to be a passive that reflected 40% of autoattack damage from melee units. It was then replaced with Urna Swarm that OP mentioned, and then into the Spiked Carapce today.\n\n* Weaver had Watchers (basically movable wards), which was replaced with Urna Swarm (yes, the one Nyx had), which was replaced with The Swarm of today, giving Urna Swarm to Nyx.\n\n* Terrorblade used to have Soul Steal (smaller Pugna ult), which got changed to be non-channeling (best TB games of my life). After that, he had Zeal, a passive that gave him HP regen and attack speed, transferable to illusions as well. Reflection used to work in an AoE, affecting all heroes in it.\n\n* Storm had a big rework, but OP's discussed it already.\n\n* Lina's Fiery Soul used to be an active that gave her move/attack speed for a while. Like a smaller version of Troll's old ult (see above).\n\n* Jakiro's Liquid Fire used to be passive, with a chance on attack to do damage over time in an area. It procced at the start of the attack, so S-cancelling autoattacks was a thing. It also broke Dota and made the whole game lag (strategic disconnects on Garena yo).\n\n* Venomancer and PA used to have QoP's Shadow Strike, changed to the Venomous Gale and Stifling Dagger of today.\n\n* Visage used to be one of my favourite heroes till the rework, and I suck at him today because I just hate playing him remembering how easy to play he used to be. Gravekeeper's Cloak used to be like Spectre's Dispersion, only instead of damaging enemies, it would heal allies. Soul Assumption used to be a passive that I think Pit Lord has today, without the negative damage aura (Not sure, forgot all about non-imported Dota 1 heroes) - for any unit that dies in an area around you, you get bonus temporary damage. And instead of 2 super strong birds, you had 5/6/7 above average bird summons that you could raise on a short cooldown from a corpse. \n\n* Sven's Warcry used to be a passive armor aura. \n\n* Magnus' Empower used to be a passive cleave (like Sven's today).\n\n* Alchemist's Unstable Concoction used to be channeling for upto 5 seconds and stunned for as much time. No self-stuns, an thd you'd always hit, at the downside of having to stand there.\n\n* Luna and Drow used to have auras for %based damage to ranged heroes near them. Changed to how they are today.\n\n* Silencer used to be red, but then he got changed because he looked too much like Dragon Knight (because what's a reddit post without D A N K M E M E S, amirite?)\n\nThat's all I remember for now. Really makes you think of how times change.\n\nEdit: Formatting.\n\nEdit 2: Just remembered Magnus, before Skewer, he had two separate abilities. One for Cleave (like Sven's), and one for damage (like current Empower, but higher damage percentages). IF combined the two into today's Empower, and added Skewer.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427134803", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

You had Spartacus League, Spartacus international, Spartacus Music, Spartacus Ballet, etc. all used as inspiration for Marxist revolution.\n\nThe two novels, \"The Gladiators,\" by Arthur Koestler and \"Spartacus,\" by Howard Fast, were the two fictionalized novels to choose from.  Yul Brynner had already the rights to the Koestler and so Kirk Douglas bought the rights to the Fast version.  Koestler had been a Marxist for years, but then had an epiphany and renounced Marxism, prior to writing the Gladiators.  Howard Fast, was a Marxist, who previously had even tried to equate the American revolution with Communism.  That any historical revolution against tyranny, can be co-opted and used symbolically as communist propaganda, is annoying to me.\n\nIn China, the very old classic tales of the loysl Bandits, known as \"Water Margin.\" Or \"All men are Brothers\" (Pearl Buck translation) was the \"Spartacus\" for Chinese co-opting.\n\nThe Hollywood blacklist story is enmeshed in the Spartacus production, since Fast and Trumbo where both marxists and Douglas was very liberal and sympathetic.  I think both Douglas and Kubrick preferred the Koestler story to the Fast version.  Trumbo spoke of the \"Large Spartacus\" vs. the \"Small Spartacus\". He preferred the \"Large Spartacus\". Kubrick wanted a darker, human Spartacus.\n\n Douglas just wanted it to be a big epic and I think his control of the production, found common ground for the opposing ideas.\n\nSpartacus is very unique in that there were so many talents (giant, massive egos) at work.  Even Olivier and Ustinov had a hand in the script.   This is why that Criterion disc special features is so good.  You get to see the big picture of the making of Spartacus.\n\nWhen Spartacus premiered in Hollywood at the Pantages theater, 70mm, it was KUBRICK.  It blew my mind.  The moment that bizarre music begins I was transfixed, even though the opening scenes at the mines was flawed.  Kubrick's disowning the film is legendary, but I think his frustration during production was a blind spot for him.  Regardless of all that controversy, Kubrick's contribution to the film is all over it.  It had the Kubrick look and sounds. It has that unique Kubrick art to it.  He clearly liked the Alex North music, since he initially had North prepare the 2001 score.  The music is totally memorable.  That drum cadence and off-beat syncopated music during the Arena scene is incredible, as is the main titles and love theme.\n\nIt has to be seen on the big screen in 70mm to really see how it was when it came out.\n\nFor a year or more, before it came out, there was a white S P A R T A C U S sign written in those roman style free-standing letters like the \"Hollywood\" signand a Roman style building set, up on the hill top at Universal, that was seen when on the 101 Hollywood Freeway.  The  early Gladiator school scenes were shot up there.  I was 13 when the film came out and that sign on the hill was an obsession.  The sign was left standing for quite awhile after release.  I must have seen it at the Pantages, 20 times during it's roadshow engagement.\n\nSpartacus became my favorite film, even more then Ben Hur.  The longer version was seen in the theaters during the first week or so.  Even though the Douglas-Trumbo- Kubrick feud was so pronounced, it produced a film, free of the sickening politics. Freedom fighting against oppression should not be co-opted by political ideologues or it just becomes propaganda, tainted by anti-americanism.  \n\nOne of these days I'll watch the Starz mini-series.  It turned me off when I first tried to watch it.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427135764", "subreddit": "StanleyKubrick", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From what you have written I presume that you're playing cho as a tank, which is ok but I don't find him to be as good of a tank as other current options. I have turned my 30% winrate into 55% (80% for the last two weeks) by picking cho mid in ranked, which took me from p2 to d4 in a week. When played as a burst mage and in the mid lane slot you are able to have a much greater impact on the game. There's a few tips I've got for overall mid'gath and then I'm going to touch on your specific concerns here:\n\nI started out with 9/21/0 masteries and a basic ap mid rune page, building roa into ap tank items that worked out just fine, until I watched Faker play cho mid. From this he plays cho as a burst mage that is just naturally tanky. I switched to playing with 21/0/9 masteries, pen marks, health seals, scaling mr, and flat ap quints. This amplifies the damage output significantly. I tried playing with 21/9/0 as well but the utility does make a bigger impact than the defensive stats.\n\nI start with q every game for invasion and counter invasion potential. The order of skills pointed up to level 4 varries every game based on match ups. Usually resulting in 2 points in W and one in each of the others. For example, if I plan to all in early then I will point in Q W W or if I am being pushed in then it is Q E W E (then max W) so it can change depending on your needs.\n\nAt level 6 I have to immediately decide if I will all-in or farm hard. A kill is nice but you can also go straight to the raptors, W auto and R for an instant clear and a stack of feast. If raptors are down (jungler needs them) etc then you can take the enemies relatively easily but use your judgement to assess the risk. My preferred alternative is the scuttle, which can be nommed on first spawn. \n\nFirst items: dorans -&gt; morello \nYou might want roa if you are really getting beat up (like against adc corki or urgot mids fml) but the cdr and ap on morello is perfect for getting stacks up quick.\nBoots: sorc or merc, again unless against double adc then ninja is ok\nNext option: zhonyas op\nI fill out with deathcap, void staff, occasionally with spirit visage (I like the cdr as well as tankiness against ap heavy teams/fed ap) abyssal is ok too but it isn't part of my core.\n\nIn the mid game! Finally, to the point of your post. Use your execute on dragon or their jungler, obvs. The Q and W is great for PEEL and FOLLOW UP but you should be careful about spamming these out because the cooldowns are long in a quick fight. Use zhonyas to wait out these cooldowns and block burst. Cho is awesome for wave clearing while walking to the fight, so your wave pushes while you've gone to fight. Bursting enemy carries is nice but isn't always the answer, say vi is moving towards your carries, you can silence her to break her gapclose, q on top of your carry while their being ulted by vi and then feast vi and suddenly their engage is looking REAL BAD. A lot of junglers look to dive the adc because as cho you are a carry but naturally tanky so they are less likely to choose you. On the follow up here you pair well with anyone's cc because rupture can be hard to land. Wait for someone else to land something to guarantee that you hit your knock up.\n\nI've got to go to class bus let me know if you have any thoughts or questions about this.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427148923", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Without knowing the maps this game could be a lot closer than what the odds are putting it at. Lunatik has been repeatedly destroyed on Inferno for example. These teams however have faced each other relatively recently (March 2 on de_season) where Lunatik barely took the win with a score of 16-14 (didn't watch the game so I can't say too much). Both Lunatik and MH have faced a team called d e t h r o n e: MH lost to them on dust2 2-16 and LTK lost to them on Inferno (13-16) but then beat them on mirage with a reasonable 16-4. If inferno does get picked I think MostlyHarmless has a reasonable chance at taking it if dust2 is picked I think LTK should have a fairly easy time taking that. My guess is Ltk will pick either mirage or d2 and MH will pick inferno.\n\nI'm putting the odds at 65-35 in favor of Lunatik.\n\nBet: I'd say going small on Mostly Harmless or medium on Lunatik Risk: High\n\nMy Bet: I'll probably skip.

It doesn't say Kid Boo with South Kai absorbed (AKA Buff Boo) was any more or less evil than the original Kid Boo. Dai kaioshin might have lowered his power the most by making him gentle, but I see no evidence that points to South Kaioshin not affecting Boo's spirit. \n\nI see quite the opposite actually. \n\nSouth Kai is a freakin' Kai after all.\n\nKibito Kai was clearly referring to and comparing the **original** Boo (Kid Boo) to Dai Kaioshin-absorbed Boo (Fat Boo).\n\nSouth Kai was a Kai and we know how those affect Boo.

And, **born from his father alone4**, still in strong possession of the mutant traits, was Freeza.\n\nAccordingly, even saying “Freeza’s race”, these two are the only ones who possess an abnormal [level of] battle power and cruelty.\"\n\n**4: It is unclear whether Toriyama means Freeza was born from only one parent, or emphasizing that only Cold carried these traits.**\n\nUnclear = inconclusive. \n\nAlso, Herms also put Parent(s) in his translation, making it JUST as \"erroneous\"/credible as the VizBig translation.

{"body": "\n\n&gt;So, from that whole answer, we can come up with two outcomes.\n1) Freeza only has one parent (Thus, Viz is wrong)\n2) Freeza has two parents, but his father is the only other one with amazing strength like him. As such, his mother wouldn't be able to injure him (Thus, Viz is wrong)\nIn either case, that still means that Viz's interpretation of the translation was wrong, so why does their interpretation of this Buu Saga line have any more validity to it?\n\nYoure going to have a riot with this one:\n\nHerms also translates that exact same Frieza line, and he puts \"Parent[s]\" (that YOU yourself showed me). The \"correct word/translation\" (according to you) would have been \"Parent,\" and Herms did not put that correctly. He put Parent[s]. ACCORDING TO YOUR LOGIC, Herms is now disqualified from having credibility in the Boo saga too along with VizBig.\n\nOnly difference?\n\nVizBig is an official release, therefore if **both** are erroneous, VizBig is automatically the go-to translation that is an official reference **by default - regardless of erroneous history. It's an OFFICIAL reference.**\n\n&gt;The very line you quoted indicates that nothing about him had changed in terms of his evil nature until he absorbed Dai Kaioushin. He was evil itself until absorbing Dai Kaioushin, thus South didn't negatively affect him. Simple.\n\nThat's certainly one way to interpret it. \n\n\nI'll play along and give you that one for the lulz, even though the VizBig O F F I C I A L translations says BOTH kais' souls tamed Boo.\n\n We'll agree on this: Nothing is stated in any version of the manga to change within Boo when he first absorbed Southern Kai. **Not his nature, not his strength.** I dare anyone to find where where it's satted that Boo became stronger upon absorbing Souther Kai. You're arguing Dai Kaioshin was the only kai that affected (tamed/weakened) Boo, fine. \n\nSuper Boo reverts back to Buff Boo, and Boo gets a bigger ki.\n\nThat means that upon reverting back to Kid Boo from Buff Boo, which means losing the Southern Kai (which didn't affect Boo in neither nature nor power) his ki remained the same because he lost the final influence (Southern Kai).\n\n**South Kai's influence was none. I don't see a statement saying Kid Boo's ki rose after absorbing Southern Kai. And, according to you, Boo's nature remained the exact same too.**\n\n**Kid Boo is equal to Buff Boo, which is stronger than Super Boo.**\n\n**WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU MA'AM.**\n\nKaioshin: “In m…my era there were five Kaioshins…until they were defeated by the Majin Boo that the wizard Babidi created…I was the youngest and most powerless one, but I somehow survived, with only heavy injuries…But the other four fell to Boo…First, two were killed…the North Kaioshin and the West Kaioshin….And then the South Kaioshin, the burliest and strongest one, was…somehow absorbed by Boo….. “\n\n\nElder Kaioshin: …And he became that huge Boo from before? “\n\n\nKaioshin: “…Yes…Next to be absorbed was the fat but kind and gentle Dai-Kaioshin….The Majin Boo that Bibidi created was evil itself, a failed creation that even Bibidi himself couldn’t handle, but by absorbing the Dai-Kaioshin, he somehow become controllable…. “\n\nAgain, I don't see where Southern Kai increased/decrease Kid Boo's power anywhere, and I don't see where Southern Kai affected his soul anywhere (what you have been arguing the entire time...).\n\nThat means that upon losing Southern Kai, Boo's ki remained the same. Buff Boo = Kid Boo. \n\nBuff Boo &gt; Super Boo.\n\nKid Boo &gt; Super Boo.\n\nLiterally everything else is irrelevant. This is all based on concrete statements, and **lack** of concrete statements, from the original japanese manga. \n\nYall have a good night\n\nwhere my crown at", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427169498", "subreddit": "dbz", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is in response to me bringing up in a post about government surveillance and hacking tools, that 100 out of 106 comments were not about the article, but instead about Justin Trudeau and his stance on C-51. By a group of accounts who have been doing this for months, often commenting back and forth to each other in the same post, or copying and pasting the same comment over and over again. I asked the mods to add more mods to properly enforce the sidebar rules instead of relying on automod, a bot who they put keywords in to autoremove, to do the job of moderating. I was called out by the moderator for calling one of these accounts a plant. It seems rather silly to me because a few weeks before I complained about comments being autoremoved and asked why they have such a fear of adding new mods to properly do their job, and that I was noticing a lot more autoremoved comments on posts, and these people aren't informed their comments are removed because it's done by a bot. In fact, my own post complaining about these issues was removed by their automod/spam filters, and it's only because I know about this that I check for it, most average users don't even know. The solution, instead of doing it properly, is to add another word to their list of auto removed phrases and to ban people for using a single word. Don't ban the people who constantly derail comments, don't ban trolls, don't ban people who make this place toxic. Ban people for using a single word instead. The mod who called me out and made this post hadn't made a mod distinguished comment for a week before this, if this was such a big issue why wasn't it brought up sooner and worked with in a more transparent fashion instead of outright banning a single word? Why was I singled out by the mod in that post, when multiple other accounts were using the same word themselves, namely the people who I called out as plants in the first place? Now people can't even have a legitimate conversation about the nature of business or government plants because of one word the moderators don't like, and this is supposed to fix the issue.\n\nIn what world does asking for more moderators to properly do their job and by having those mod numbers ensures the rules in the sidebar are adequately enforced, mean adding the word s h i l l to a list of already banned keywords auto removed by a bot? The fact that I literally called them out for not properly enforcing the sidebar rules, by not having enough mods and instead rely on automod to remove key words multiple times before this and my comments were a precursor to this new rule, and mere hours before making this post, the best idea is to use automod to remove a single word. The people who I mention as being plants aren't banned as far as I know, one is still following me around commenting wherever I am, so now they will continue doing what they are doing, and I will have to use more creative words to call them out on their bullshit.

Or if by way of conversation it comes up. The Liberals are more similar to the Conservatives than the NDP is, but distinct in very different ways, I think most people are aware of this. That's normal dialogue. There is an influx of these pro-conservative accounts, who exclusively attack the Liberals and Trudeau, usually when the topic isn't even about him or the party. They will reply to a top level comment so their comments get some traction, and their friends or alt accounts upvote them. The guy who I called a plant literally said in two different comments in here that they support the NDP and then that they think a Conservative minority is the best thing for Canada. These people are rude, often insulting you.\n\nThey are extremely easy to pick out because the only time they attack the Conservatives or put any focus on them is to say that the Liberal party is the exact same.\n\nAn endless stream of new accounts or deleted ones doing the same thing. \n\nThey copy and paste this to create confusion so there isn't a focused debate on the actual issues. They do it at the top of high voted comments so they can get it attention. They post about Trudeau so the focus isn't on the actual issues. Do you see people discussing the article? They don't care if it's a battle of both people saying no you're a s h i l l, no u, no u, they just prefer if it's focused on criticizing Trudeau.\n\n\nAll of their comments, literally every single one, is about Trudeau. The leader of the third party, who like the NDP, have no power in parliament against a majority. They don't explain their position as a supposed lefty unless it's on the basis of attacking Trudeau. They don't once criticize Harper for a thing he does, many worse than the Liberals. If they do criticize him, it's to tie it in with attacking Trudeau.\n\nThey say little about the NDP or their policies other than to say they are the best party to vote for. They are obsessed with Trudeau and the Liberals. They're a conservative troll or plant who seeks to split the vote. Conservatives are always going to vote conservative, better to turn the parties against each other or say the Liberals who are neck and neck with Conservatives are no different than them. Liberals lean to the right a tiny bit to match the far push to the right by the Conservatives, now they try to push the idea that the only place for progressive voters is the NDP.\n\nThey attack Trudeau and the Liberals more than the NDP ever have. They attack them with the same gusto and lack of responsibility to focus on the majority Conservative policy as the Conservatives do. Once public sentiment grows too big against them or they think the experiment has failed they delete and start over.\n\nMetacanada users show up and join in with them lamenting about when the Liberals were still in power. Many of these accounts you can find in the same post, doing similar things, often replying to each other. Reaffirming what they are saying and offering more fodder.

{"body": "In what world does asking for more moderators to properly do their job and by having those mod numbers ensures the rules in the sidebar are adequately enforced, mean adding the word s h i l l to a list of already banned keywords auto removed by a bot?\n\nI literally call out the fact that you haven't added any new mods in a couple years and instead rely on automod to do moderation for you because you don't have those numbers, and your best solution is to make a sticky post banning a single word to address the issue? Not to mention the conflict of interest multiple people are pointing out to you about approaching you with information to have people banned, what the criteria is to meet this description, or how you believe people can go about actually gathering this information.\n\n&gt;Do you see people discussing the article?\n\nThere are maybe 10 comments in this article actually discussing the article or the content of it. The other 100+ comments are discussing Trudeau, his stance on everything under the sun, arguments between people about this, plants who comment only about the same thing, often with copying and pasting the same comments over and over again, and the problem really is with people using a single word? You're going to have to keep dealing with people pointing out these issues, and why they would even use a word like s h i l l to describe these actions in the first place, because banning a word only removes it from public site, the situations leading up to this aren't going to go away or be fixed by this. You're banning the discussion of people mentioning this so you don't have to see it or deal with it, the situation that creates this discussion is free to rage on with no oversight. Automod shouldn't be a solution to every problem. Add more mods to properly enforce the rules stated in the sidebar, or remove the rules and the keyword and spam filtering. You're putting a robotic band-aid on a severed artery to stop the bleeding and putting the patient in a locked up basement so no one has to see or hear them. \n\nI saw it. Unimpressed that you didn't address my complaints, further unimpressed with the methods used to combat these issues, and feeling singled out for caring about the quality of this subreddit instead of having my concerns heard and addressed. If your intent was to make a mockery of my time and my issues in this subreddit as well as silencing users who have similar complaints, I would say you did a pretty good job. If your intent was to fix some of the issues I mentioned and some of the problematic users that create a chaotic atmosphere in here, I would say you need to give your head a shake. \n\nI asked you to maybe create a sticky post asking people for their experience or what they feel the problem is, and instead you make a definitive rule with no conversation around creating it and with very little defining what you mean or the process you created that makes this place welcoming to a small minority of toxic users while doing nothing to address the longtime issues this place has faced that does push a lot of people away. You could have asked people for ideas on solutions to the problem, I'm sure very few people would answer that your solution would work or be the best. \n\nMultiple other people use the word s h i l l in this post, and it was only me you responded to. Are you going to add the word plant to automod too? What happens when people want to discuss gardening in Canada? Are you going to add the word stooge to this list as well? What happens when people want to discuss larry, curly, and moe?  If you don't have the moderator numbers to properly enforce the rules already in the sidebar, how is adding this layer of bureaucracy going to be more efficient for you and this subreddit? If you don't have the mod numbers to leave a comment on posts and comments auto removed by your spam and bot filter, how do you expect you're going to enforce this new rule and educate users on it before banning them?\n\n\nIf I felt that the mods didn't take my concerns seriously before, this makes me feel that not only are my concerns not taken seriously, they are either taken as a joke or are used against me so that instead of having my concerns addressed, even mentioning my concerns in the first place is a bannable offence.

{"body": "This is in response to me bringing up in a post about government surveillance and hacking tools, that 100 out of 106 comments were not about the article, but instead about Justin Trudeau and his stance on C-51. By a group of accounts who have been doing this for months, often commenting back and forth to each other in the same post, or copying and pasting the same comment over and over again. I asked the mods to add more mods to properly enforce the sidebar rules instead of relying on automod, a bot who they put keywords in to autoremove, to do the job of moderating. I was called out by the moderator for calling one of these accounts a plant. It seems rather silly to me because a few weeks before I complained about comments being autoremoved and asked why they have such a fear of adding new mods to properly do their job, and that I was noticing a lot more autoremoved comments on posts, and these people aren't informed their comments are removed because it's done by a bot. In fact, my own post complaining about these issues was removed by their automod/spam filters, and it's only because I know about this that I check for it, most average users don't even know. The solution, instead of doing it properly, is to add another word to their list of auto removed phrases and to ban people for using a single word. Don't ban the people who constantly derail comments, don't ban trolls, don't ban people who make this place toxic. Ban people for using a single word instead. The mod who called me out and made this post hadn't made a mod distinguished comment for a week before this, if this was such a big issue why wasn't it brought up sooner and worked with in a more transparent fashion instead of outright banning a single word? Why was I singled out by the mod in that post, when multiple other accounts were using the same word themselves, namely the people who I called out as plants in the first place? Now people can't even have a legitimate conversation about the nature of business or government plants because of one word the moderators don't like, and this is supposed to fix the issue.\n\nIn what world does asking for more moderators to properly do their job and by having those mod numbers ensures the rules in the sidebar are adequately enforced, mean adding the word s h i l l to a list of already banned keywords auto removed by a bot? The fact that I literally called them out for not properly enforcing the sidebar rules, by not having enough mods and instead rely on automod to remove key words multiple times before this and my comments were a precursor to this new rule, and mere hours before making this post, the best idea is to use automod to remove a single word. The people who I mention as being plants aren't banned as far as I know, one is still following me around commenting wherever I am, so now they will continue doing what they are doing, and I will have to use more creative words to call them out on their bullshit.

{"body": "Sounds like you did your homework then :].  A couple pieces of advice about how some people do well (caveat, everyone learns differently):\n\n1.  Budget your time wisely.  The entire year is a roller coaster of deadlines and assignments that you need to plan accordingly for.  People say to finish your outline by the week before finals, and that sounds *doable*, but you usually have a writing final due at the same time, and a week before finals is not a good idea if you want to practice exams that aren't 3 hour tests.  Look at the calendar that they give you and plan things accordingly.  If you can keep up with the workload despite the time crunch (many of your classmates will be triaging reading at that point, which may or may not work), you're able to keep yourself ahead.  Reading ahead for that week so you don't have to do any while you write the final paper is a great way to give yourself some time to write something quality, too.  Good time management is a relatively simple \"fix\" that doesn't just involve brute force studying.\n\n2.  Practice Tests.  Do as many as you can by simulating a testing environment.  They are indispensable to a good grade.  \n\n3.  Office hours.  Go to these to clear up ambiguities and to pick the professor's brain on things that s/he might value.  A lot of the \"hiding the ball\" crap is the professor trying to get students to think on both sides of the issue, which is I guess the \"trick\" to law school exams (arguing the merits of both sides of a position, \"issue spotting\" as many things as possible etc.).  Supplements can help a lot, but your test is going to be your professor's, not Glannon or Chemerinsky's.  \n\n4.  Look for mentors.  They're better able to explain the specifics of your class and school than a nameless person on the internet.  \n\nAs for pre-law stuff, there's not much.  You can try reading Getting to Maybe, and LEEWS gives you an introduction to the IRAC method (IRAC should not be used mechanically, though; an actual exam might look more like I R R R A A A A A C, where the major points come from the analysis of the issue from both sides of a point rather than a single answer).  I wouldn't bother with anything else, as it likely won't help much.  ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427225885", "subreddit": "LawSchool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; That's not what I'm saying. Kibitoshin did know about Buu's backstory, and he confirmed that it was odd for Buu to absorb someone, and for there not to be a strength and appearance change. As such, from Kaioushin's experience, every time Buu's absorbed someone, there's been a form change and a change in strength.\n\nExcept Kibito Kai didn't simply say \"a change in strength.\" No one did.\n\n**Elder Kaioshin**: “…Don’t you think it’s a little strange? …Each time Majin Boo has absorbed a warrior up to now, his power has gone up and his appearance has changed…But this time…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Boo got **STRONGER** after absorbing every **WARRIOR** (**Kais** aren't warriors, stop being a scrub). So once again, since Dai Kaioshin WEAKENED Boo, and since South Kai and Dai Kai were NOT \"warriors,\" they're freakin' KAIS, Elder Kai/Kibito Kai were DEFINITELY not referencing to the Kais in that instance.\n\nThe fact that he says EVERY SINGLE ABSORPTION HAS **STRENGTHENED** Boo (**which would be a PLOT HOLE/LIE - refer to Dai Kaisohin WEAKENING Boo**), and the fact that he strictly says W A R R I O R S (Kais are not \"warriors\" - if he were including the Kai absorptions, he would have said \"All **BEINGS** BOO HAS ABSORBED\" or something to this effect), AND the fact that Elder Kai **AT THAT POINT ONLY KNEW OF THE EARTH WARRIORS BOO ABSORBED, NOT OF THE KAIS,** all automatically invalidates that quote from referencing ANY events/kai-absorptions before Boo appeared on earth.\n\nHow many times do you have to read it before it registers?:\n\nElder Kai could not be freakin referencing the Kais' absorptions because he didn't know of it until Kibito Kai told him later when Kid Boo appears.\n\nThe use of that dialog in order to prove South Kaioshin increased Boo's power is null. Invalid. Throw it out the window bruh. That was your only hope, a desperate attempt at that, and you know it. You're wrong.\n\nThere IS NO STATEMENT saying Southern Kai's influence strengthen/affected Boo in any official release of dragon ball, manga or otherwise. Therefore, it didn't.** Otherwise it would have been noted.**\n\nTherefore, AT THE VERY LEAST, Kid Boo = Buff Boo &gt; Super Boo &gt; Goku SSJ3\n\nThat shit is impeccable. You cannot argue against facts.\n\n&gt; since it was established that Dai Kaioushin was the only one that affected him negatively and decreased his strength\n\nEstablished in YOUR fanfiction. But in reality, in the real world, TWO legitimate sources point at BOTH Kais WEAKENING Boo (VizBig, an OFFICIAL release, and Herms' translations).\n\nWhich would make Kid Boo stronger than Buff Boo, who is stronger than Super Boo.\n\nBUT since you want to be a diva, we can \"disqualify\" BOTH those credible translations. Doesn't matter.\n\nThen it remains that ONLY Dai Kaioshin affected Boo's strength (weakened) &amp; Boo's nature. It is NEVER NOTED ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE that Southern Kai strengthened Kid Boo's ki (VizBig &amp; Herms only point to Southern Kai \"taming/weaking\" Kid Boo's ki... . .), nor affected his nature in anyway (WHAT YOU WERE ARGUING LOL).\n\nYou're going to resort to Goku feeling \"confident\" against Kid Boo (which was Goku simply showing off and lying to Vegeta in order to look cool, as he admits) to \"prove\" Super Boo &gt; Goku &gt; Kid Boo, but I already wrecked your shit in that one: They both severely underestimated Kid Boo as Vegeta and Goku both admit (Vegeta outright says \"He is stronger than I ever imagined\" or something like this), which means Kid Boo simply hid his strengt. More proof that Goku was weaker than Kid Boo, and thus overconfident against Kid Boo (which would make the entire assessment from Goku about Kid Boo &amp; Super Boo wrong): Kid Boo's Vansihing Ball was stronger than Goku SSJ3 + Vegeta SSJ2 since Goku states: \n\nChapter: 508 (DBZ 314), P8.7 \n\nContext: Boo forms a big ki blast\n\n Goku: “It-it’s huge…! You’ve got to be kidding…! Do-does he intend to unleash that…!? **…We can’t knock back something like that…!**”\n\nGoku went in over his head and and attempted to show off, he had nothing for Kid Boo. \n\nThis is my last reply to you since you clearly have nothing left. Anything you say after this is irrelevant. \n\nYou're fun to argue against tho\n\nI hope that you are reborn one day as someone who understands things clearly, and lets go of their tunnel vision views when it comes to power levels, especially after I post impeccable proof from the japanese manga itself\n\nsee ya", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427233406", "subreddit": "dbz", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The internal state is merged implicitly, and yeah, it composes.

Kinda like if it was playing in a space lounge of some sort.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty fitting tune I must say. It's got the same feeling to it--ambient, but just melodic enough to have a melody that sort of drifts in and out, not really taking any particular form but *present*, you know? Instrumentation's not quite the same, but that's forgiveable.\n\nMy one quibble is that this track is a bit *too* laid back perhaps? I know it's chill/vapor/wave/trap/[genre] and that's the point of the genre, so I can't fault it for being chill. But at the same time, compared to the FTL tracks...listen to the FTL tracks and those've got a bit of *momentum*, like even though they're drifting in and out of melodic lines, the overall structure and pacing and instrumentation of an FTL track is still building to a particular point in the piece. This doesn't really have anything like that, on the other hand.\n\nOr maybe I'm just being overly pretentious and entirely wrong about tunes ahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH shit.\n\nEDIT: [Here's R A R E on their bandcamp page](https://cocainejesus.bandcamp.com/track/cocainejesus-3).

That gives you 74 letters and changes the game a bit. If the period is included, that gives 75 total characters, or three lines of 25. \n\nI'm guessing they're using some kind of rudimentary system since they probably don't have access to a computer, right? \n\nAnyway, three lines of 25 would look like this:\n\n.   s u p m a n i n N o t K e N t o y o u B u t t i \nN o B o b  b y i  t A  l  l g o o d p r  i  s o n i sE\na  s y  t h  i  s i  s t  h e h a r  d T i me H what\n\nOnce again, spacing to make the words line up.

That is, if you will excuse the choice of words just perverse. \nI think Asia proved by this simple remark that she was for whatever reason, remembering the wrong day.  This is reinforced by the fact that she compounded it by saying she was snowed in at her boyfriends that day, because of the snow. It is really stretching credulity to believe that was possible at 4:30 am.  The fact that Derek and his friend abandoned her despite apparently telling her they would swear affidavits, is the final nail in the coffin.\n\n&gt;You are taking her words from an interview from 16 years later when she did not realize they would be dissected and challenged\n\nThere is an old saying \"a good liar needs a good memory\"'. Whether or not she was actually lying as  the Judge in the appeals case auggested she may have been, is open to debate. But there is no doubt that her testimony as a matter of accurate recall, was torpedoed by her own unguarded remark. I have always felt sorry for Asia. She was naive when she wrote those letters, and clearly had a crush on Adnan. Now she is being cynically used by Adnans \"defence team\" as, what the Russians used to call \"a useful I d i o t\" to try to get their IAC claim through.

I do also have a Primark 32E moulded cup bra I sometimes wear, the cups fit great (I should make a post asking for other bras with the same shape!) but the band is HUGE and the smoothing effect of moulded cups (ie. the only reason you would want moulded cups?) is destroyed by the fact that they are covered in lace and ribbons (why do they do this ?????), so it shows up even more than the Marcie under most of my clothes. Plus the wires creak loudly as I move (???).\n\nAs for the bikinis... I go to the pool quite often (once or twice week, for leisure/relaxation rather than sport!) and my old 34A bikini is just so wrong. Even before I discovered My True Size TM I knew it probably shouldn't fit like that. A couple of weeks ago I got a clothes-sized one piece in a UK16 that fits my hips, the cups are too projected but they are moulded/non-wired and sit flat against my chest without gaping so my boobs are contained and you can't tell I don't fill them inside.

{"body": "One way I found easy to learn is to go YouTube and look up backing tracks. These are basically just tracks that you can jam along too. They usually say what key there in. Learn the scale. If you cant figure it out by ear then just look it up online. Now you can either jam along to the bassline thats already in the song or you can write your on which is what your trying to do. Basically what you have to do is figure out the chord progression. Lets say the song is in a minor. You learned the scale to a minir is A B C D E F G. You then figure out the progression A D E ( I IV V). Now you can either play the root notes which you would just be playing A D and E or you could get more dynamic. To create a bassline, generally your just using the notes that form the chord and playing them until you get to the next chord. So the first chord is A which consists of A C E. This is the root, the third, and the fifth of the chord. To add some flavor you can also add the seventh of the chord which in this case is G and you can also add in the octave of the root which would just be A but higher or lower than the first A that you played. Then you can follow this step again for next two chords in the progression. Hopefully this helps, theres tones of videos on YouTube that should be explain it better than I have.

{"body": "Hello, and thank you for your response.  \n\nTrading:  \nI feel like this is something I really need to work on, especially when bot lane (it is my worst role, and I think it is because I really have no idea how to trade bot lane).  With my main champions, like Annie, and Pantheon, I feel like I can trade well generally and get in some Q poke from both, and do some combos when they come in on me, or when I go in on them.  There are some matches where I find it really hard to trade (a mele vs a ranged for example), and I don't know how I should go about in those matches.  For example, a Diana vs Talon, she shields most of my damage, and can Crescent Strike me out of lane with little consequence. \n\nWarding:  \nI have really been working on my increasing ward placements, and get the upgraded yellow almost every single game.  However, I really don't know where to ward.  When laning mid, I know there are some prime places, like the jungle entrance, the corner bush, bird camp, and in lane top/bot river, yet when it gets to late game, I really have no cue where to place wards, and when I do place then, they tend to be cleared relatively quickly. \n\nDying:  \nI think most of my deaths are picks.  Like I will die when getting blue, or warding, or following to another lane, or something.  I run cdr in my masteries for sums, as well as distortion boots, so I get a 217 (I think) cooldown  on my flash, so I usually flash ult to initiate, and the Q W E Q and zhonyas.  I do tend to get cocky (especially if I am 5/0 + in lane and then go into 2v1 or even 3v1 and then die a lot) and occasionally I will be too far ahead of my team, and initiate when they are too far away to follow up.  For example, I can think of 2 games where I \"lost us the game\" because I would initiate before my team was there (Q into vi ult followed by adc flash so I am half way down the lane away from my team).  I guess the biggest thing that comes down to is communication with my team. How should I work on communication in ranked solo q?\n\nAnd I think you are right in regards to positioning.  When I play adc, I am always out of position, and because I can't burst anyone, I usually get insta killed, while with Annie i may be able to make a pick or two (even out of position) but will end up dying as well.  So how would I work on that? What steps should I take to learn better positioning? I feel like when I am in back, I do no damage, while I have found with Ziggs I can Q all day from 2 towers away, if I Annie, I have to stand almost on top of them to hit them with my spells. \n\nThank you for your advice, and I hope this doesn't overwhelm you.

{"body": "Dropped two tabs at 8:00pm. Had tripped twice before on one tab from the same batch - seemed to be quite manageable.\nThings were going beautifully. The countdown rolled around and so everyone in the flat party headed onto the balcony to watch the fireworks (I live in London). For about 15 minutes we had a 180 degree view of the sky alive with fireworks. The entire perceivable colour spectrum lit the sky. It was a m a z i n g.\nOn the 00:00 i decided to drop 175mgs of MDMA, so T+4. Started feeling the MD, become more dancey and sociable, had a fairly big spliff about half an hour later. By the time 00:45 came around, i was no longer on the planet. The acid, combined with the spiff, took full control.\nFor the next three hours I was no longer entirely on the planet. My memory of the night from this moment on is in no linear order. It is shattered and disrupted. A lot of things happened. I will detail what I remember and have integrated.\n(I have no idea as to the order of these experiences).\nAt one point I was experiencing the universe - how it was all connected, the neurons or synapses or whatever buzzing and flying around, I was at the centre, in the middle as I was perceiving it through my own mind. The centre of all things is the same thing, or some shit like that. Everywhere is the centre etc.\nI realised and experienced that LIFE IS JUST A GAME. In my universe-level consciousness I had a llll the cheat codes for life. I experienced a sort of drop-down menu with all these options that I could cycle through. Each one would be a response for a specific action, thought or feeling. Like View&gt;View as&gt;75%,100% 125% etc. That kinda configuration. This bled through to my earthly place and if i said or did something to a friend, i would know there response or reaction before they did it. (this is the part i forgot about, and what ally+weed allowed me to remember.)\nat one point i was outside on the balcony smoking a rollie, my friends talking. lets say that i went outside and sat down at 2:10am. i started having massive time///experience/dejavu loops. the acid kept forcing me back to 2:10am. I would experience 2:10 to 2:11 and i would loop back to 10 past and experience to 12 past, then back to 10. then to 13 then back to 10 and so on. it was as if it was saying \"SAM, WHAT CAN YOU DO DIFFERENT IN THIS SITUATION? YOU CAN ONLY ESCAPE IF YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IM SHOWING YOU.\" this was pretty frightening.\ni was sitting inside with everyone- they were all playing drinking games. i was looking at all their faces and thinking about everyone in my life who I've ever been close to. suddenly everyone became the same person - like manikins with blank faces. a set number of blank manikins who change faces as i go through my life. I've been with the same people my entire life - filling the same roles/places etc. i then looked at the room. i realised that we NEARLY SPEND OUR ENTIRE LIVES IN ROOMS. the only time we aren't in a room is when we are walking from one room to another. whether its from a mates house to my own, or my house to uni or my house to a restaurant. LIFE=ROOM.\none of the scariest things, or most 'jolting' or 'jarring' was when id get dragged from the multidimensional experience back to the planet. people would have to say my name 9 or 10 times to get me to respond. after coming back, id look at whoever was getting my attention, not reply and zoom back off to wherever i was.\nbut the absolute scariest thing was when i thought my friend had jumped off the balcony. he has been upset for a while and was on the balcony alone. all i remember hearing was my mate shouting \"HAS XXX JUMPED??!?!?\" i ran to the window and couldn't see him. this sent me baaaaaddddd for a while. apparently after this i was sat on the floor behind the curtain hahaha.\nonto the 'ego death' portion. i either can't remember all the details or i jumped straight from 'self' to 'nothingness or oneness'. i remember experiencing ALL POSSIBLE POSSIBILITIES FOR MY LIFE. ALL POSSIBLE REALITIES I COULD GO INTO. ALL POSSIBLE ROUTES FOR MY LIFE. ALL POSSIBLE AVENUES FOR MY FUTURE. AND THEN EXPERIENCING THEM ALL F A D E A W A Y WHILST I WAS LIVING THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY. ALL THE LOVE, ALL THE JOY, ALL THE OPPORTUNITY. ALL THE FUN. ALL THE SADNESS. ALL THE HEARTBREAK. ALL THE EXPERIENCE FROM A HUMAN LIFE. FADE AWAY. it was uttttterly humbling. it all flashed before my eyes and i lived every possibility. this is the whole 'seeing your whole life flash before your eyes as you die' thing, just expanded into every possible possibility before i experienced it. and then 'i' was nothing. 'i' was one. 'i' was at peace. 'i'.\ni think this is all i can currently recall about what happened and where i went that night. needless to say it was the best experience of my fucking life. i'm 21 years old, and since this happened just over two months ago i can honestly say that I have never felt better, more secure and more at peace with myself and the world. I can't remember the last time i felt this could. I guess i would have been 10 or younger. i have been pretty depressed and dejected about my life for as long as i can remember, and this turned everything around.\nmy fear of death has gone. the past two months have been the best two months of my life. LSD has informed what I'm going to do in my creative aspirations if i feel the need to pursue them. but now that i accept myself fully, i also accept death - and any need to secure my place in this world through whatever has evaporated. its now my choice.\nthe most freeing thing ever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427400858", "subreddit": "Drugs", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**WARNING: Text wall but lots of useful information and videos.**\n\n---\n\nOn chords and chord shapes.\n\nLearning the 8 fundamental shapes is tightly related with something known as the \"CAGED system\", [this video](https://youtu.be/LhrGeolItvw) gives a great explanation.\n\n**TL;DW:** chords are made by the 1st, 3rd &amp; 5th notes of a scale (major or natural minor); choose any scale, lets say, C major (C D E F G A B C) and find all the C's (1st), E's (3rd) and G's (5th) on the fretboard. The 5 basic major shapes will arise. The same stands for minor shapes, but Cm and Gm open shapes are awkward to play. \n\nTo learn where to play chords, you have to understand the most fundamental scale, the \"chromatic scale\" or scales of all the notes, it looks something [like this](http://imgur.com/5W6V20P). Each step you take from a ball (note) to the immediate next one is knows as a \"semitone\"; 2 semitones = 1 tone. Each fret step represents a semitone. With this information, you can understand diagrams [like this](https://www.lessonface.com/sites/default/files/images/Notes_on_the_Guitar2.png) better.\n\nNow, you are ready to transpose open chord shapes to any shape you want. For example, take the [A minor shape](http://imgur.com/jg75h8K), we'll use it to play the Bm chord. For this you transpose 1 tone up/2 frets up (up = higher pitch) and it will look [like this](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/c62dxSbjCuY/hqdefault.jpg). Here is where a problem arises, to transpose chords, you have to use \"barre chords\", here is a [video about this](https://youtu.be/22n1E1smH6o). This is the first milestone in your guitar learning process.\n\nPractice a lot, you NEED to play chords. If will help you a lot, not because you are playing chords, but because you are exercising your playing, making it stronger and your playing hand is building up rhythm.\n\n---\n\nOn Johnny Marr.\n\nJohnny's a boss. One of the hardest things to do when you're in a band is assuming the role of a lead &amp; rhythm guitar player because you have to play melodies and help with the accompaniment. Johnny Marr is notable for this. Another example is REM's guitarist, Peter Buck. A great technique that will help you is playing \"arpeggios\", arpeggiating is, basically, playing separately the notes of a chord instead of strumming all the notes. You can hear that approach in [Everybody Hurts](https://youtu.be/ijZRCIrTgQc). These surrounding melodic guitarists are very underrated because they aren't shredding or soloing heavily, but they make a great work.\n\n---\n\nOn practicing and learning.\n\nYour problem is a beginner problem, it will fade with practice. A few advices: \n\n* Make sure your thumb is [perpendicular](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Pollice_manico_chitarra_thumb_guitar_neck.jpg) to the guitar neck. Eventually -with practice- you will achieve the final guitar grabbing skill, having your [thumb over the fretboard](http://www.fretjam.com/images/thumb-position.jpg). Consider that as the final stage.\n\n* Make sure you are fretting with the [very tip of your fingers](http://musician-makers.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/how-to-play-the-guitar-calluses.png), not the tummy (I don't know the name of that part) of the finger. This is to keep your fingers from hampering the sound of other strings. It will take some time. Keep practicing. This one will help you with your particular problem.\n\n* Practice. Playing guitar is like exercising. Well, is it exercise for your hands and mind. Playing well comes before playing fast and playing a lot. This journey is not about the goal, is all about the road. You will start to appreciate music even more.\n\nHave a nice day!\n(You can always PM if you need some advice or motivation).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427412159", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Whenever I create hybrids, I use a combination of fertilizer and Jacob's Ladders, along with the mix of flowers I need to make the hybrids. \n\nThe first thing you need to do is make sure you're using the right flowers to make the hybrids. For example, to make blue roses, you need to use hybrid red roses (red roses that have at least one orange rose as a parent). So that's a big one. [This](http://animalcrossing.wikia.com/wiki/Flower) is a decent guide for hybrids. Note that the roses used for making blue ones have a star? That means that those are the hybrid red ones create from breeding purple and orange OR red and orange. The only thing the guide is missing as orange tulips, created through yellow and red tulips, from my experience. \n\nFollowing this, I usually have some Jacob's Ladders around my breeding area, and I plant fertilizer in the middle, both of which increase the chance of creating hybrids. I usually create a 3x3 box with my flowers, leaving the middle empty, and put Jacob's Ladders on the outside, one in the middle of each side. So, basically it looks like this if I were breeding Red and Orange roses (F = fertilizer, R = red rose, O = Orange rose, J =Jacob's Ladder, x = empty space)\n\nx x J  x  x  \nx O R O x  \nJ  R F R  J  \nx O R O x  \nx x J  x x  \n\nSo, I have my breeding area set up like that and I make sure to plant a fertilizer in the middle every day and water every day. It *should* increase your chances that you will grow more hybrids. Just remember, though, that there does seem to be a maximum number of hybrids you can grow in a day. I'm not sure how many, but there does seem to be a max. \n\nI hope that helps. :) ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427419559", "subreddit": "AnimalCrossing", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If he had been THIS man 25 years ago, I wouldn't have given him the time of day. We both have changed which is only natural as you grow and mature. I always wanted us to grow as a couple - he was always resistant to that - I always thought that would change. He'd see how much fun I had livhaing life, going and doing and he'd want to join in. He'd want to have fun with me, build a life with me. \n\nI actually have been in therapy for about a year - I was having a hard time with my children getting older, my marriage stinking and how to handle the empty nesting. Then once I started therapy, I didn't want to waste me time talking about the one crappy thing in my life - my marriage and my relationship with my husband. So last week, thanks in a HUGE part to this forum, I spoke about my marriage. To say my therapist was shocked is an understatement. She actually said, \"wait, what\"? Which makes me laugh now because if you knew me IRL life you'd think I have my shit together. With this one exception, I do. \n\nOne of the first posts I read, was about not telling anyone about your db - which is true. I have never ever spoken about it. To. Anyone. Except all of ya'll. For physicality reasons, if you saw my husband and me out and about, you would think we were lucky. Looks can be deceiving. If he's touched me, it's because I touched him first. If we've had sex recently, its because I initiated. If we left the house together it's because I've basically thrown myself into his car. He doesn't need or desire that intimacy that I do. He could truly be an island. While that's on him - it still hurts. When I was a kid I was the only person I knew who's parents were divorced. None of my aunts had divorced. None of my friends - even in HS, all of my friends parents were married - to me, in my naivite' marriage=love. I didn't get married thinking I'd divorce him down the road. I married forever. \n\nI'm a type A person - I like to win. Whether its solitare or monopoly, I put everything I have into it and darnit, if I don't suceed its not because I didn't try. When I left my marriage, I felt like such a failure. F A I L U R E. That's the part I have to work through with y'all and with therapy. I can't continue to stick a square peg into a circle and try to make it fit and then feel like a failure when it doesn't work. I have to let that go. \n\nThanks for reading. I appreciate it. I'm just going to be whining and feeling sorry for myself in subsequent posts so feel free to skip past my name! ;) ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427421812", "subreddit": "DeadBedrooms", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "They use a few similar notes, but they're certainly different.\n\n~~I'm not too good at judging individual notes by ear (especially on a bass), but I think they both start with an A.The \"Debaser\" bass line and \"OID\" start their progression with the same note (A). In \"Debaser\" it is played four times, in \"OID\" it is played three times. In what would be the fourth time \"OID\" switches to a second note (C) and hammers on to a third note (D). The third note in \"OID\" is the same as the second note in \"Debaser\" (D). \"Debaser\" plays this note four times, \"OID\" plays it 3 times after the hammer-on and on the fourth time it pulls off and returns to \"OID\"'s second note (C) and rolls into a fourth note (G). This fourth note in \"OID\" is the third note in \"Debaser\". \"Debaser\" plays this third note (G) four times, \"OID\" plays it four times. \"Debaser\" then plays its fourth note three times; I'm not sure what note this is, let's call it (X). \"OID\" plays its second note (C) twice, followed by a fifth note (A#) twice.~~\n\n~~So they go something like this, again with X for the note I'm not placing by ear.~~\n\nOID:\nA A A ChD D D D DpC G G G C C A# A#\n\n~~Debaser:\nA A A A D D D D G G G G X X X X~~\n\nEDIT: I looked up a tab for \"Debaser\", it goes like this in the intro:\n\nA# A# A# A# F F F F C C C C F F F F, D D D D A A A A A# A# A# A# C C C C", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427427559", "subreddit": "Music", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "E: So I basically spat out of bunch information that I thought you might find relevant. It's not exactly organized in the best way possible nor is it comprehensive. Nonetheless, I'm sure you'll manage to learn a thing or two.\n\nMan, I always love when Udyr questions come up in this sub. \n\nAs has always been the case with Udyr, there are so many build paths that can all be argued for. It's a matter of finding what works for you. With that said, I think /u/lordkingston certainly has a viable build but I figured it might be nice to get an alternative perspective.\n\nSummed up quickly, I'm a high plat player who prides himself in his Udyr play. I typically serve the role of the main tank doing a mix of front line tanking, peeling for my carries, or diving the back line depending on what my team needs and the flow of the game. \n\nMy spell order typically follows a R W E Q order aside from the fact that I like to go R W R my first three levels and 1 level in q at level 14 ish when I have a couple levels in bear. The double R at level 3 allows you to farm hard at a time when bear isn't too important. Though, it is important to consider what taking E at level three can do. If there are lanes that are practically begging to be ganked immediately at three, take bear. If you have reasonable suspicion to think that you might run into someone in your jungle, getting bear might also be a good idea. That aside, this build allows you to farm hard by clearing fast and sustaining through a lot more camps than what most other junglers can do. \n\nRunes: Attacks speed reds, armor yellows, movespeed quints, 6cdr blues, 3 scaling mr blues.\n\nMastery: I usually go 21-9 but I'm not sure if this is optimal. I use it and it works for me but consider 21 in defense.\n\nMy build typically follows a Rangers Trailblazers Devourer - Boots - Full tank order. \n\nHere's a reply to a another user that asked about my build and how I go about choosing the things I do. It's long but something I would consider reading. For an abberviated version, you can go straight to my opgg [here](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Euphoria%20I). Go to any Udyr game, click the magnifying glass on the right and it will open up build order among several other things.\n\n&gt;So this is a pretty big question and like you may have guessed, it has a lot to do with the specific circumstances that you may find yourself in. Here's a basic summary of the things I ask myself in game.\n\n&gt;Okay cool, I just finished my devourers so I can start getting stacks. When I buy next, what kind of boots should I buy? \n\n&gt;* Does their team have a lot of cc in the form of stuns, binds, fears, roots, and long duration stuns? Get mercs\n\n&gt;* Do they have a lot of slows and not too many sources of hard cc? Go with boots of swiftness.\n\n&gt;* Lot of ad damage especially in the form of AA? Tabis.\n\n&gt;As with before, your future itemization should consider the enemy team comp alongside yours. Additionally, you should also consider who's relevant.\n\n&gt;In standard games where no one person is obnoxiously fed, look to their team comp. If they have a traditional team that looks something along the lines of a single strong source of AP and several other AD sources of damage. Go with an armor centric build.\n\n&gt;For me, this means getting a sunfire after my T2 boots. I want to make a note here about sheen items after your two first items. While it can be good and many players do this, I personally avoid it. I feel as if I'm simply just not tanky enough to go two damage items before picking up anything that substantially increases my survivability. I then reassess the situation.\n\n&gt;* Is the AP damage from the other team relevant or a threat to me? \n\n&gt;   * If no, continue building armor. For me, this will usually be a Randuins but it could also amount to a Warmogs, IBG, thornmail, or the ever so popular frozen heart.\n\n&gt;   * If yes, ask yourself if your team could benefit from a locket. If the answer is yes, pick it up for your team. If not, stick with banshees or spirit visage depending on the context.\n\n&gt;In the case that someone becomes fed, consider itemization to specifically counter act the champion in question. Say for example, a katarina gets fed on the enemy team. A ga to prevent resets may not be the worst idea. MR or lots of hp can work as well.\n\n&gt;In the case where the enemy had a double AP comp, value the MR items a bit more particularly locket.\n\n&gt;Continue this process by reassessing the damage threats on the enemy team until you have a full build.\n\n&gt;Things to consider:\n\n&gt;* there may be games where despite having an enemy AP mage, having little to no MR might not be a bad idea. For example, if you're a tanky monster and the only ap damage on the enemy team is someone like, say, a not so fed syndra. I might completely forego all MR and continue to build armor. I reason this out by basically explaining that so long as I'm not constantly looking to fight her in a sustained fight, I don't really need the mr. Any effort she puts into attacking me in a teamfight is just that much less pressure put on my teammates. Given the 220 hp shield from turtle on top of the health from other items, tanking a couple shots shouldn't be too difficult.\n\n&gt;* My sheen item/frozen mallet typically doesn't come in until the 5th/6th item.\n\n&gt;   * Brief note on the frozen mallet: not too sure if it's good or even necessary but I sometimes get it. In my eyes, it takes the place of IBG when I feel as though the armor isn't as necessary and some extra hp could help. \n\n&gt;   * It may also be better just getting another traditional tank item in place of the quasitank item that is IBG/frozen mallet.\n\n&gt;* Get alacrity or homeguards sometime during the mid/late game. It's good but a bit of a gold sink. Switch sweeper for yellow trinket 12-20 minutes in. Upgrade it around 25 or so. Any time you expect a large fight past 30+ minutes, it might be a good idea to have an elixir of iron.\n\n&gt;* For a comprehensive list of items that I consider a part of my Udyr pool, look no further.\n\n&gt;   * On top of devourers and boots, I'll choose from sunfire, randuins, IBG, trifroce, thornmail, warmogs, banshees, spirit visage, GA, Locket, frozen mallet, frozen heart. Have not experimented with righteous glory but it seems like a fantastic item for udyr. I'll probably starting messing around with it when I have the time.\n\n&gt;It may not be everything as I wrote this sort of rushed but it covers a lot. I'm sure you'll find it useful to some capacity. Feel free to ask whatever.\n\nI didn't mention it here in my response but Righteous glory is an amazing item on Udyr. Definitely something to consider if someone else on your team isn't getting it.\n\nThe key to playing anyone who uses devourer is being as efficient as you can. You need to farm hard while also taking the time to help laners. It's something that you won't have a complete feel for immediately. Typically, I ask myself several things:\n\n*Did this laner ward? (it's just as much your job to be looking out for enemies warding as it for your laners)\n\n*Can I for sure get a summoner if I gank?\n\n*Similarly, does this person have SS? A good tip here would be to ask your laners to keep track of them.\n\n*When are my camps respawning?\n\nIf you choose to gank, you'll want to stack up your passive outside of vision. That way, you're going in with the most possible speed possible. Typically, this means  turtling outside of vision once. Bearing into your gank. Stunning. Then following up with your damage and any subsequent stuns you can fit in. Don't ever be afraid to blow your flash for a gank. If you know your laner can follow up with cc after a flash stun. Do it. As people often say, getting to a target is the difficult part for Udyr. Once you're on top of someone, there's little chance that they'll be getting away.\n\nAlso be looking out for early dragons. If you ever find the jungler top side, know that you can solo dragon nearly unscathed with turtle.\n\nThere always more to say but I feel like I've said a lot. I'll allow that to sink in before I say more. If you do have questions though, feel free to ask.

{"body": "I have a couple. TL;DR shit happens\n\nMy 1st band broke up after two jams. I was called too bossy and everyone quit. I said I wanted to cover a Coheed song and essentially everyone said \"I'm out.\" Which I thought was unfair, but looking back I didn't ask if anyone wanted to cover something else. Also there was the band name dispute.\n\nMy 2nd band was with a bass player who disbanded over a dispute about how to record on a digital recorder. He wanted to just wing it, and I said we should piece it out. Instead of working it out, he just stopped coming to practices. We had a really good thing going too. The wing it probably would have made more sense though since most of our songs had quite a bit of improvisation, however he handled it wrong by not addressing it.\n\nMy 3rd band broke up because the drummer was kicked out of his house and disappeared for 3 days before our second show. I said they weren't serious enough to play and quit. I went on with a solo acoustic gig, and the other two became an Alice in Chains cover band. That only played Would? and nothing else. We are still mostly friends.\n\nThe 4th band was with the previous band's drummer's younger brother who also liked to drum. He acquired his older brothers drumset after he was kicked out. Which was a little awkward but survivable. The other guitar player was a Zeppelin rip off artist. We worked on some songs but he literally could not stop playing Jimmy Page riffs. Ultimately I left due to creative differences. I love Zeppelin too, but people are gonna notice.\n\nThe 5th band I was in was only for meeting and I quit. The other guitar player didn't know how to restring his guitar, and said he wanted to pick up chicks. I quit immediately after hearing that and saw he actually worked way too much to play anyways.\n\nMy 6th band is slowly becoming very serious, and is currently doing very well.\n\nLearning my lessons from my previous failed attempts. Which was, most people just want to have fun and play music let the small stuff go. \n\nIf they aren't as serious as you, that's fine, don't speak down to them, share concerns. That goes for agreeing on parts, showing up on time, mistakes when playing live. Adapt to it, but don't ignore it. Don't leave angry. Make a serious attempt to leave as friends losing a band member shouldn't mean excommunication unless it's serious.\n\nHowever we did end up with a keyboard player who basically tricked me into letting him jam with us. I heard some music he had written, and invited him to play with us. When he got there he literally took out a pen and started labeling his keys A B C D E F G and so on. He did not know how to jam at all. And was ultimately let go after that. He was coincidentally a good bass player though.\n\nWe also had a bomb ass drummer before our current one but he ultimately had college difficulties.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427439821", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It will take some time for the theory to start to sink in. Just start out with messing around with one-string scales, and find the notes for the major scales.\n\nI like to take notes while watching these theory videos, after the first 2-3 videos you should be able to write out the note names of the 12 major keys. Then you just have to plug the notes into the guitar neck, I drew out some scale patterns of the neck (I went up to 15 frets). I'm going to draw out some more tonight, with 3 scale patterns on each of 4 pages for all 12 major scales...\n\nBesides the scale patterns, just work with making a major scale from any root note you play on the guitar, with the W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern (W = Wholestep, H = Halfstep). So for your C major scale:\n\nC D E F G A B C\n\nThe C &amp; D are a whole step apart, along with the D &amp; E. That's the first two W's out of the WWHWWWH. Then you have E &amp; F, which are a half step apart, and then G, A, and B are all a whole step apart, and B and C are a half step apart.\n\nYou can do this WWHWWWH pattern starting with any root note, for example G major:\n\nG A B C D E F# G\n\nThis scale also follows the WWHWWWH relationship, as do all major scales. The 3rd and 4th note are next to each other (half step), along with the 7th and 8th. All other notes are a whole step apart.\n\nBasically your fretboard is like a piano, where the black notes are frets as well. Imagine the black notes were white notes in between the current white notes, and that's what the fret board basically is.\n\nOne of the videos on that series has a nice way of learning all the notes on the neck. The two E strings have the same notes, and there is a relationship between the E and D strings, along with the A and G string. Basically if you play a power chord (1-3-3 on E A D or G B E), the note on the E &amp; D string will be the same (but one octave apart), and the note on the A &amp; G will also be the same when playing the power chord position from the A string.\n\nAs far as learning the notes &amp; scales go, I think starting with the C major / A relative minor scale is the best to start out with, since you'll learn where all the white notes on a piano are on the fretboard. No sharps or flats... The [circle of fourths/fifths](http://www.hearandplay.com/main/why-the-circle-of-fourths-is-so-important-when-learning-major-scales) is a good way of learning your major scales.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427527228", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No his shield is NOT impenetrable. It blocks solid projectiles but aoes will still hit you if you are too close. and some shots do penetrate the shield. In T4s you are better off with a solid CC rather than a very short term CC which will serve both as defense and offense allowing you to deal damage without taking it. e.g. loki + vauban is the typical choice as it prevent's bombards and grenades, forces everything melee and bastille lets you line up headshots 100% of the time. headshots with crit &gt; mag's shield esp when he has no solid CC which is his main weakness.. that and other than his shield he doesn't scale. Speed is worthless, shock doesn't scale, and overload doesn't scale. \n\nMag is NOT the only infinitely scaling nuke in the game but you don't need to scale infinitely. Total eclipse mirage has something to say about damage. as does resonance banshee. Both together you never need to worry about damage even with unpolarized weapons when you are dealing 1000%+  damage \nCrush is actually solid CC as it stops them from moving with the augment for 7s. but mag still gets stuck when enemies don't have shields. you activate polarize too early and you run the risk of a bunch of enemies with no shields but not dead. If you CC you damage their shields reducing your scaling. Wait too long and they will kill you.

Play a C E G major chord, and then slide each note in the chord up to the next note in the scale, which gives you D, F and A, making a D minor chord. Next is E, G, B, an E minor chord, and then it goes to F, A, C for an F major chord.\n\nThe scale degrees for a standard scale go like this: \n\nI - Major \n\nII - Minor\n\nIII - Minor \n\nIV - Major \n\nV - Major\n\nVI - Minor \n\nVII - Diminished (the 5th note forms a tritone, these chords are dissonant unless used in the right context)\n\nWith a minor scale, it's the same thing except starting from VI.\n\nOh, and not sure if I made an error in my last comment but G would be major in a C major scale, being the 5th note in the scale.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that what makes a chord minor vs major is how many half-steps the 3rd is from the root note.

I have yet to find a single, definitive resource that explains them with absolute clarity, I just read whatever I could get my hands on (or my browser to).  \n\nBasically, \"modes\" are a set of seven patterns from which you can create every scale you may want. The idea is, if you play a C major scale (C D E F G A B C), that's one mode (known as Ionian). If you play the same notes, but start on D (D E F G A B C D), you have another mode (Dorian). If you keep doing this, you have the seven modes. These shapes, or finger patterns, can be shifted to any starting note, from which you can play literally any scale.  \n\nE.g.— \"Oh, I have to play in D minor?

{"body": "Druids: Pros- High Mobility, a lot of instant cast healing, Spammable CC, Immune to poly if you are watching, Can turn offensive on a CD if they need to, high synergy with most classes that happen to also be good at the moment.\n\nCons- If you do lock them down or hard switch to them and they aren't completely ready then they are pretty squishy atm, but if they are ready it doesn't work like that. End of cons\n\n\n\n\nShaman: Pros- Good \"OH SHIT\" buttons to bail out of hard situations, high mobility, Good instant heal spells as with druids, TOTEMS!!!! WOOOOO, Purge is strong, Totems, \n\nCons- If your opponent chooses to aim you down you actually are a good target to be trained, Ghost wolf is disspellable, Totems can die\n\n\nPally: Pros- NUKE HEALS!!!!, BUBBLES, N U K E H E A L S, Good mobility on CD's, Instant cast stun on a relatively short CD, high total single target throughput\n\nCons- Less mobility than shams or Druids, Have to bait kicks more often than druids or shams, Suffer from not being a Druid\n\n\nMonks: Pros- Really high throughput, Getting kicked doesn't matter all that much... sometimes, A great oh shit button to be used on CD (BUBBLE AGAIN), Good mobility, Good CC that can be used offensively\n\nCons- After using your bubble you are vulnerable so you have to play greedy against a lot of comps, not as mobile as Druids, also suffer from the condition known as not being a druid\n\n\nDisc Priest: Pros- Disspell, shields, AOE fear on a relatively short CD.\n\nCons- You are gimp, Shields are disspellable (retarded) , You can't top people off once you get into dampening like other healing classes can, Mana runs out easier than any other spec, Less heals than other classes due to disspellable shields, no great OH SHIT button, low mobility and more damaging to get CC'd than other classes. Fear was nerfed HARD this season\n\nHoly Priest: Pros-\n\nCons- You are a holy priest, also known as a heavy bag that already had a couple tears in it and started to have its insides spill out, but the owner didn't ever patch or tape you up so the leak and tear only get worse as it goes along. One good hit to your person and you rip in half with nothing in your power to save yourself. After all you are just a bag.\n\n\n\nThis is in no way a complete list of pros and cons. Its a Very brief synopsis of the current situation that is likely greatly scewed by my personal experiences. On a different not the strengths and weaknesses of each spec can be offset or magnified by different comps. Some of the classes suffer more from the current state of affairs than others and others are completely broken in the current meta.

{"body": "The mode doesn't really stand out unless you have the proper tonal center.\n\nFor a good example, we can look at the major scale and it's relative minor.\n\nIn the key of C major, the notes are C D E F G A B.  This also happens to be the ionian mode of the scale.  Similarly, in the key of A minor, the notes are A B C D E F G.  This also happens to be the aeolian mode.\n\nSo what's the difference between playing in the key of C Major and A Minor? There really isn't one unless you have a new tonal center to the song.  If we play the A minor scale over a steady C note (or C major chord), it's still going to sound like C major.  Even if we play the A minor scale over a series of chords, like C major - F major - G major - C major, it's still going to sound like C major because the tonal center of our music is C, with our chord progression leading us to C major.\n\nIf we want to capture the sound of A minor, we need to create music where the focal point is A.  Unless our ear hears that A as being the center of the music, the notes A B C D E F G won't sound like A minor.\n\nNow let's get back to modes. Modes follow the same principle above.  In the same way that C major and A minor have their own unique sounds, each note of the scale has its own sound too, if you can get the listener to hear it as the tonal center of the music.  This can be more difficult with other notes, however, because the tendency of most chords pulled from C major is to move to C major or A minor.\n\nThis is why most modal music makes use of limited chord movements or a single droning note.  It's the easiest way to get a note that's not the C or A to appear as the tonal center.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427650489", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

A diagnosis is a lot more then, welp you got a p0303 and it might need X Y Z Z Y X \n\nTo put it simple you got lucky. No let me tell you a story like yours, only he did not get lucky.\n\nFord f150 pickup 5.4 L v8.\nCustomer had a p0304. Told us he didnt want to pay to diagnosis it and it just likely needed plugs. \n$350 later, still missing.\nWell coils are common, lets put coils in. \"You sure you don't want me to diagnosis it?\" Nope, put some coils in.\n$400 later, wtf it still misses? You sure you put in new parts? Yup, I recommended again diagnostic services. Nope, it must be the injector, put a new injector in it.\n$200 later, still missed. At this point the customer wanted to pay for some diagnostics but just basic compression test. It passed. I recommended he allow me up to 2 hours of diagnostic time to id the issue, he approved.\nThis is when he learned why the autozone code reader is $100 and my tool is over $10,000. I found with my scanner with a pressure transducer / labscope running that the exhaust valve was leaking intermittantly. It did not show up with a normal compression tester as they just give you a max number vs a real life visual in real time.\n\nThe person spent $1000 on unneeded repairs because he was told by a $100 scan tool ran by a $8 an hour employee what he needed and thought shops were just out to screw him.\n\n\nProblems I have seen cause a p0303. Plug, wire, cap, rotor, coil, oil in spark plug tubes, water in tubes, coolant in tubes, fouling due to stuck open injector, bad injector, bad PCM control of injector, Bad injector wiring, burnt valves, blown head gaskets, cracked rings, leaking intake gasket, rocker arm came off, bent pushrod, sticking valve, collapsed lifter, carbon, bad fuel line to injector \"like on a gm 4.3 multi port.\n\nTLDR: If the most common fix doesn't take care of it, take it to a professional for diagnostics before you waste money / time chasing something you can't fix.\n\nPS: If your engine is GDI \"Gasoline direct injection.\" PLEASE have an induction based Decarbon service done every 30k.

{"body": "Sorry I missed your 12th March deadline but here are my thoughts: \nTo me it sounds like you're simply experiencing Life with all its ups and downs and learning curves but you're not appreciating it. You say you've 'wasted so much time', yet I am reading a long list of things you h a v e done, things you have learned, experiences that (although not always fun) have undoubtedly taught you something even if it's just 'let's not do that again!'. When I was in my 20s, I had the same panic of making one specific career work, to 'get on track' with that. Well guess what, ffwd 10-15 years and I don't want to pursue that career anymore (nor do I work with anything related to what I studied at university btw - many many people don't!).\nYou call it 'losing your passion' but really, you are just changing and exposing yourself to new things and growing as a person - stuff that's great to be doing in your 20s!\nThis may not be what you want to hear but you may never find your 'calling'. However, you may find 4-5 callings in your lifetime and that's totally ok. You already list 3 possible callings above (and yes, you could make a career out of no 1 - several people I know have).\nAs for what the name of your BA degree will be... Honestly, it won't matter that much down the line. An employer will want you to have relevant education, skills and often work experience, but ultimately they are looking for someone they like hanging out with 40 hours a week who is willing and able to learn. The latter you will have proven just by finishing a(ny) degree.\nSo, study what you really enjoy learning and don't worry about what that BA will be listed as. Then look into the different avenues that interest you and pick something to pursue right now, make it your current passion. And if that passion fades, don't be scared to move on. You will undoubtedly be smarter and come with transferable skills to take into your next passion.\nRemember, you won't be the same person 30 years from now so why would you necessarily be in the same career?!\nGood luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427731401", "subreddit": "Advice", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well personally I really like playing tanks, so my favorite jungler at the moment is Nautilus. Here is my general route on him:  \nOn Naut I run attack speed reds, move speed quints, flat armor yellows, 6 flat cdr blues and 3 scaling mr blues. Start w and gromp. Activate w at 1:48. get e at level 2, take blue then wolves then wraiths then smite red then krugs then gank bot. I skill w e e q max r &gt; e &gt; q &gt; w. Best way to gank is to save q and auto -&gt; e -&gt; w -&gt; auto -&gt; q when they run. \nI can give you some general jungling tips that don't really apply to specific champs:  \n1.) Don't forget to farm. You should be hitting 6 before your bot lane. If you notice your bot lane is hitting 6 before you are it means you need to farm more.  \n2.) Just because your lanes are pushed in doesn't mean you can't gank. Look at the map and ask yourself where the enemy should be ganking. GO THERE. Counterganks are fucking brutal. You can get a 3 for 0 trade in a countergank bot lane and just win the game from there.\n3.) Buy a pink every single time you don't have a pink on the map. Early game vision control is all on you (don't rely on your team, it's soloq, everyone is bad)  \n4.) Personally I think the upgraded ward trinket is ridiculously good right now, I build it almost every game. It lets you set vision up for objectives without worrying about your support. \n5.) It's USUALLY better to snowball a winning lane than to help a losing one.

{"body": "All right the biggest issues with this piece are ambiguous word choice and sentence structure. Sometimes, when the \"cuts\" between thoughts are very logical or aesthetic, the sentence fragment effect works nicely. Other times, when the leaps are less obvious, it's harder to keep up with the pace of the prose. A lot of these issues will be helped by expanding description and characterization in the opening to give us a real cinematic perspective on the scene (it's even helpful to think of what \"angles\" you want the reader to view the scene from, and what details those angles highlight. But, as in a film, there must be some deeper logic to the transitions between sentences and thoughts, even if that \"logic\" is deeply strange and unexpected.\n\nAt times, it is difficult to tell who is being referred to, or who is speaking or thinking which thoughts. It does give the proceedings a chaotic atmosphere, but I think most readers would prefer perhaps a little more order. Again, this will be aided by more description.\n\nWithout a doubt, the most stirring prose in this vignette is dead smack in the middle, around this area:\n\n&gt; And who has the time to order executions between the whispers, “...last year, his sister...” “...how much more blood can a man lose before...”\n\nuntil about\n\n&gt;More whispers. I open my eyes. No.... I have a sword. \n\nThere is a real sense of adrenaline in this passage that you should be congratulated on. But\n\n&gt;That he can’t affect political change with a second body on the floor.\n\nthen we see the return of some of the more distant language, and the pace suffers noticeably. This is a bloody event, so don't go with something as lifeless as \"affect political change,\" even \"claim the throne\" has more tangibility to it, but I'm sure there is something more artfully savage you will think of.\n\nIs this the start of a longer work? There are minor capitalization, punctuation, and tense errors and like I said sometimes oblique word choice but other than that, I'd like to see more of this story, or an elaborated version. Below I'll just list some random thoughts in hopefully mostly chronological order:\n\n&gt;I swing the blade wildly, tears blurring the image\n\nSlight issue here with \"blade\" and \"tear.\" For me at least, after \"blade\" I inevitably read it as \"tears\" rhyming with \"tares,\" as a blade would do. Maybe just change the order up - \"I swing the blade wildly, my vision blurred with tears... \n\nContrary to the note on your docs application, there is no issue for me with the double use of \"livery\" at the start. It's a gross word, and the repetition has a squeamish effect. Why are we in a livery, incidentally?\n\n&gt;conical helmets flickering\n\nThis is a nice image, the helmets flickering rather than the torches -- we need more like this! Even this could be expanded into a fuller metaphor. Is there some feature on the helmets, perhaps that further characterizes these soldiers or their employer, that might also be enlivened by the flickering, like an ember in their flickering helmets?... and so on.\n\n&gt;They move to surround, but none of them approach to kill.\n\nWe need more pronouns. I don't want you to lose the fragment effect, but sometimes they're needed to orient us.\n\n&gt;the superior craftsmanship can endanger somebody with a half-blunt piece of iron like theirs.\n\nDull language - what is it about the craftsmanship that is so superior? Was the steel hardened a special way? Is there some sort of unusual gilding? Originally I got the impression that this sword was very special, but now I'm just wondering if it's a normal sword and the other guys just have total garbage. \"Endanger,\" too, is bloodless.\n\n&gt;it could also be me, if seeing and knowing and working and laughing with somebody every day of your life would make a man stay his blade.\n\nNice moment, learning of the fraternity of these soldiers and their quarry (and characterizes both), and I like the rhythm of the verbs it but needs to be made more clear. \"Or, if seeing and knowing and working and laughing with a man every day of his life is still worth anything, maybe that's why they stay their blades.\" - this is more clear but has lost some of your rhythm, I'm sure you'll think of a better way.\n\n&gt;Of course, if they had known me just a little bit better, they would know I can never take a life.\n\nUnfortunately right here this revelation immediately lowers the stakes for me. Things aren't quite as suspenseful if we know the sword someone's holding definitely isn't going to be used. Is there instead maybe a shred of ambivalence here we might glimpse? Or if not, and the no-killing rule really is set in stone, maybe our narrator has some kind of feeling about it? Does he regret making that decision? Was it foisted upon him? E X P A N D.\n\n&gt;Carefully, but not regally, for kingship is a distant affair and there is no such feeling in the prince’s eyes.\n\nCan we get a descriptor for the feeling? Is the feeling maybe noble or wizened? To me, \"regal\" isn't much of a \"feeling,\" it's more of a comportment.\n\n&gt;If I act now, If I attack him, not ~~to~~ him but towards him, a guard will cut me down.\n\n&gt;Even the prince will understand it’s not the time of speeches with his poster servant dead\n\nThis made me laugh, but I don't think there are really many \"poster servants.\" Are there posters in this historical setting? Maybe more tapestries? But I would stick with something simple but old-fashioned, like \"most favored servant.\"\n\n&gt;“Ask yourself, before you condemn. What is the worth of a life?”\n\nThis also made me laugh, because the prince certainly comes across as a jerk with this kind of question, especially with the crowd jeering at him. Is \"caused\" really something a crowd could cry out as a correction? I feel like the \"d\" at the end would be lost. Maybe just \"not anymore!\" or something else like \"you too!\" Again, it is funny that the prince apparently gets so much disrespect at an apparently lethal moment.\n\n&gt;He pushes my blade aside with a hand as he steps over the robes in front of me, and I don’t have time to think before he wraps me in his other. A shirt but no robes. I’m not enveloped.\n\nVery confusing. His other what? It must be \"hand.\" Is a hand something you can wrap a whole person in? Maybe just your neck or your arm or something? And I guess you are the one wearing a shirt but no robes? And you would be enveloped if you had one?
