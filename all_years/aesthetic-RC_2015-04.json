{"body": "“The first time it happened?” I asked already knowing the answer. I was only buying time to conjure the image in my head so I could start immediately after she asked again. No lag time.\n\n\n“Yes, the very first time. How old were you? Do you remember where it happened?” Dr. Lisa Hought asked me with a look on her face that could only be described as inquisitive.\n\n\n“Well I remember it was fall. All the trees had turned to their deepest colors, and I grew up in Maine so they were beautiful, my mother and I were in a cemetery. You see she was very into genealogy, has are family traced back six hundred and some odd years back to Russia and England respectively. She was always dragging me around to different cemeteries as a kid. She’d take photos of the stones of families she was working on. I remember she kept chalk in her car to rub unto the older stones to make the text really pop. We were standing in front of a tall rounded stone as I heard,\n\n‘My name is John Clarkson, I was born 1892 in Boston. Died 1901 of a gun shot wound in Portland Maine. I am your cousin long last but now found thanks to you and your mother. I love you. I see the light. I’m leaving now but we’ll talk again soon.’\n\n“I remember saying ‘Wow Mom that was cool’ and her replying ‘What?’ it was at that moment I knew something was odd. Even at a young age I felt at peace with what had happened. I wasn’t scared or concerned about hearing his voice. It was if it was natural.\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks I began to think thoughts in Irish and remember a life I hadn’t lived. My name was John and I was young lad growing up in Boston. My parents were under attack from many locals because they were seen as “different” or “odd” we fled to Maine. The wild North. I remember a cold winter day and a wooden wagon but not one with a top. A single horse pulling a family of three and their belongings thru tire trenches at least two feet deep. At times the wagon would bottom out, Mom would hold me extra tight. She had red blonde hair and blue eyes that would comfort me as she would say ‘John just hold tight dear.’ \n\nWe entered Portland and three men on horse back galloped up our wagon with guns drawn. My father grabbed his shot gun and the men shot. One shot missed my father, he fired back hitting a man in the chest. I remember watching a hole emerge through his body and praying to God that didn't happen to me. Second shot hit my mother in the stomach. I held her in my arms as the third shot entered my head. I watched my mother die in the split seconds before I died.”\n\nDr. Hought sat there for a moment. Blank face. White as if painted so with make up. Staring straight, deep into the pits of my eyes. We sit there locked into each others souls for a few moments and finally she breaks her gaze writes a single line on a piece of paper then hands it to me and says,\n\n“I I I I I think our session is done for the day.”\n\nAs I walked out of her office I read the note she wrote,\n“I can no longer be your psychiatrist.”\n\n \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427853886", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Good God these new edits are incredible.\n\nMarth: (SSB4)\n&gt;Marth's contract with Mewtwo has expired and his teleport grab no longer exists, meaning it is much harder to land grabs. Opponents can trade hits with his grab, resulting Marth getting down throw to up aired every time he tries to go for a grab.\n&gt;Shield Breaker deals more shield damage, making it more appealing to bad For Glory players against people who spam shield grabs.\n&gt;Counter is strengthened, being able to KO reliably off of strong countered attacks at very low percentages. Why Marth had to give up a real sword for this is still a mystery.\nMarth now grunts instead of talking while using Counter. Again, this is because he sucks.\n\nDiddy: (SSB4)\n&gt; Diddy Kong is the most broken character in Smash 4, even more so than Meta Knight in Brawl, because all he ever does is cancel his side b and use his down throw up air combo, otherwise known as the HOO HAH.\n&gt;Up aerial (the HAH) is a significantly stronger KO move, being able to KO below 0% against opponents near the bottom of the stage, and is much more useful in combos, now being able to rack up damage quickly and reliably set up other aerials out of a HOO or short hop.\n&gt;Grab is broken.\n&gt;Forward and back throw's animations are much slower, but who cares?\n&gt;Up throw has slightly lower knockback, allowing it to set up aerials more reliably, like the HAH.\n&gt;Down throw (the HOO) sends opponents at a different angle and is much more reliable for setting up aerials, now being able to set up any aerial until percentages as high as 999% (depending on the opponent's character) and start highly damaging combos.\n&gt;Monkey Flip now allows Diddy to pummel the opponent once he grabs onto them. The launch is also more powerful and can now KO at around 0%.\n&gt;Rocketbarrel Boost is now able to move at horizontal trajectories, which literally turns him into Deep Kong from Project M 3.0.\n\nFox: (Melee)\n&gt;Fox, true to being on the top of the tier list, is insanely broken. I mean, his entire moveset can kill you. Except probably side B and lasers, but that's besides the point. Plus, shine comes out in one frame, which (according to Hax) means that he is unbeatable at perfect play, ignoring the fact that Yoshi can parry shines. Despite being top tier, Fox is not flawless. He will literally eat your fingers alive if you try to play him consistently because your APM has to be at least 10,000. Additionally, his high falling speed makes him very easy to punish, and almost all combo videos include several clips of Fox getting wrecked by Peach or Marth or Falco or what have you. The biggest drawback to playing Fox, however, is that most Fox players are assholes and you will likely become an asshole by playing Fox. Regardless, his pros out\"shine\" his cons (ha ha ha ha ha), and Fox is notable for being one of only 0 characters in the series to have no matchups at all because all of them are free wins.\n\nFalco: (Melee)\n&gt;Falco Lombardi (ファルコ・ランバルディ, Falco Lombardi) is one of the main characters of the Star Fox series. He is a member of Star Fox, and has been with Fox McCloud and crew since their debut on the first Star Fox game for the SNES. He is considered the finest pilot of the group, and is well-known for his arrogant personality and being fucking bad.\n\n&gt;Falco has combos on combos on combos on combos on combos. C O M B O B O Y S. Falco's down aerial spike is completely broken as it has almost no starting lag, can easily be comboed into, and can score very fast gimps on characters with bad recoveries as well as KO efficiently at 0%. He can also kill you with like half his moveset. Falco, however, is not flawless. His high falling speed makes him a hacky sack for characters like Marth to combo him, especially on Final Destination. He also gets chaingrabbed by like half the cast. His recovery distance is so short that most Falco players just kill themselves after they're sent a certain distance away. Regardless of these flaws, Falco's strengths greatly overwhelm his weaknesses and he has amazing matchups, lacking any negative ones (making him and Fox in Melee, Pikachu in Smash 64 and Meta Knight in Brawl the only characters with no negative matchups) and having only a handful that are considered even. Falco is fucking bad. As in bad-ass.\n\nPuff: (Melee)\n&gt;Jigglypuff's jump on the tier list is due to its broken recovery, an unbairable edgeguarding technique in the wall of pain, a powerful KO move that can get you arrested for using it, and an overall great aerial game and metagame. Its floatiness also makes it the only character in the top tier who avoids almost every combo in the game. Regardless, Jigglypuff still has problems. Because it is literally cotton candy, it dies at like 50%, and has died as low as 5% from a tipper forward smash on Yoshi's Story. Jigglypuff's tiny feet also can't run, so her ground game sucks ass. Regardless, Jigglypuff still has an excellent amount of favourable matchups, with its only disadvantageous matchup being Fox, and two of its matchups are nearly unloseable (against Ness and Pichu).\n\n&gt;According to Mew2King, Jigglypuff is one of the most broken characters in the game. Only Fox can beat her because Fox is OP but not as OP as Falco. Jigglypuff can plank the ledge for 20 years and win tournaments, and all she needs to do is press down B and you lose.

{"body": "Don't use the second charge of your R to trade in lane unless all-inning them for the kill, because then you cant use it for further trades nor pressure in the lane. QR+W with some auto attacks is better, because you can then return with another Q R W a few short seconds later. Just flat out QRWE+QR should take about the same time, even with CDR, but you will probably travel too far down the lane for that, and might end up overextending.\n\nIf you can, try and wait for your passive to come up from basic attacking minions, then QRW into them. With the damage from your passive this will likely chunk them to half health or more.\n\nMorellos isnt that good on her because you don't need the mana sustain because of the double dorans you should get. CDR is nice but she has resets and already has really low CD's, so isn't the best on her.\n\nTypically you will want to rush Abyssal/Zhonyas depending on the lane after your two dorans and boots, Rabadons and Sorc shoes, then go into stuff like RoA, Lich bane or ludens, finishing with a Void Staff.\n\nFor the secod part I generally agree about nashors. It can be good against a lot of tanks, though. Ludens is good if you need ranged burst to poke people down, if it is far too risky to go ham, but Lich Bane allows you to do so much more damage during assassinations because it has better scaling and occurs on pretty much every auto during your combo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1427898576", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

Viridi Palm would be a custom, that shoots a shot while dashing, at the cost of damage.\n\n**Up B: Sky Jump:** One of the powers in KI:U, Virdi leaps in an arc. A little lower than Launch Star, but in return, anyone caught in the arc is damaged quite a bit.\n\n**Down B: Demon Vine:** An item from KI:U, a growth of vines will surround Viridi, damaging anyone who is hit by them when they rise. It can block projectiles, and, depending on how powerful it is, reflect it. A custom variant adds vines that damage on contact, but have a shorter radius, and is less sturdier.\n\n**Final Smash: Reset Bomb:** Viridi summons a reset bomb that explodes in a white flash that does severe damage, and the battlefield is covered in vines. Opponents who hit the vines will be damaged, and sometimes buried after the explosion.

You have a STRONG handle on production and song craftsmanship and the restlessness of this song is wonderful. THAT SAID...this sounds in this song are a little safe, a little familiar, you've taken all the rules of whatever-the-heck-genre-this-is-called-now and colored inside the lines in exquisite detail. I think the song is kind of lacking a chorus...or maybe a \"hook\"...something that really obviously defines the song...like, you could exploit the \"there are sounds in my mind that won't go away\" line a bit more...like at 1:50 right at the end of the vocal cutups, a really clear take of that line cut up right at the end of the measure...wait...bar...wait those mean the same thing...or...\n\nwhat i'm saying is the vocal cutups should be followed with a few clear words that create the \"chorus\" of the song, which would also work thematically...the chaos of the cutups *are* the sounds in your head that won't go away. HA! I didn't even figure that out ahead of time, i figured that out WHILE I WAS TYPING.\n\nIN SUMMATION 2\n\nKEEP MAKING MUSIC. TRY TO SELL IT TO PEOPLE.

{"body": "So here's what the [essentials chart looks like with only albums that are (at least partially) fronted by women](http://i.imgur.com/qAt9lhx.jpg). I used a loose definition here, so I counted borderline cases like The White Stripes and Pixies too. I'm not saying there needs to be a 50/50 parity, but here are some essential-worthy albums that happen to be (at least partially) fronted by women too:\n\n**Classics**\n\nYoung Marble Giants - *Colossal Youth* (1980) - An album that was incredibly ahead of its time. You could say this is one of the first indie pop albums.\n\nKate Bush - *Hounds of Love* (1985) - One of the most defining art pop albums of all time. Kate Bush set the template for so many \"eccentric\" musicians, from Bjork to St. Vincent.\n\nCocteau Twins - *Heaven or Las Vegas* (1990) - One of the very best and most influential dream pop bands definitely deserves a spot.\n\nSlowdive - *Souvlaki* (1993) - I'd say shoegaze isn't properly represented without this album. The dreamy yin to *Loveless*' noisy yang.\n\nYo La Tengo - *I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One* (1997) - Arguably the essential noise pop album. How come they aren't already on the chart?\n\nCat Power - *Moon Pix* (1998) - Every bit as sad and dark as Elliott Smith or Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy, and the best album in Cat Power's long-running and highly praised discography.\n\n**Modern**\n\nSleater-Kinney - *The Woods* (2005) - A band as long-running, influential, and consistently great as them deserves a spot. We could argue all day over which album, but I don't think we could go wrong with *The Woods*.\n\nThe Knife - *Silent Shout* (2006) - The pinnacle of modern electropop. I don't know if we'd be talking about Chvrches, Purity Ring, and the like without this album.\n\nJoanna Newsom - *Ys* (2006) - Definitely one of, if not, the leading albums in the weird folk movement of the 00s.\n\nPJ Harvey - *Let England Shake* (2011) - One of the most celebrated albums from a very highly-acclaimed singer-songwriter, and one of the most political indie albums in recent times too.\n\ntUnE-yArDs - *w h o k i l l* (2011) - Merrill gets a lot of love here, and I'd say her eclectic globally-influenced brand of indie pop is every bit as good as Vampire Weekend's.\n\nFiona Apple - *The Idler Wheel...* (2012) - One of the most lyrical and well-crafted singer-songwriter albums of the new decade. I'd say Fiona is highly deserving of a spot.\n\nGrimes - *Visions* (2012) - Not too many indie pop albums this decade made a splash as big as *Visions*, which combines capital-P pop with lo-fi production values.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428033984", "subreddit": "indieheads", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Basically there are two different ways of arranging notes, chromatically (notes in order ex c# d d# e f f#) or scalarly (forgive me, forgot the actual term, but if you are playing a g major chord or in the key of g major you would play g a b c d e f# g) and depending on the kind of baselines you are playing you kind of want a mix of these two. So the guitarist/pianist/whoever plays a chord and you want to play something using the notes that are in that chord (usually. you'll learn about modes later). A scale has 7 notes and an octave, and each note you play is labeled with a number, 1st note is the 1st, 2nd is the 2nd, etc etc. The most important notes to play (usually) are the 1st note of the scale(aka root note), 3rd, 5th, and either 7th or 8th( called the octave) these notes played in a row are called an arpeggio. they \"outline\" what the chprd sounds like and will sound the best (usually). But you arent just gonna play straight arpeggios, well you could but it wouldn't be too interesting. Instead, mess around with playing the scale and arpeggio of the chord being played. Repeat some notes, add some chromatic notes going between the important notes, make some octave jumps. Generally, as long as you play the right scale it'll sound okay.

{"body": "When we say the key of the song, what we mean is the note that the song wants to return to, or gravitates to. \n\nFor the key of C (Notes C D E F G A B, called the C major scale or C Ionian), the song wants to return to C and we call C the Tonic.  C is usually the first chord played and is usually played more than other chords.  G is called the dominant tone.  Its the farthest consonant tone (means sounds good) away from C.  When you get to G, the sound really pulls back toward C.  We say that moving toward G from C increases the tension and that the tension is released when you move from G back to C.  The movement from G to C is called a V-&gt;I cadence, (G is the 5th tone of the scale, C is the first).  For songs in the key of C you will generally have a C chord first and then some F chords and G chords.  C-&gt;F just generates a bit of movement but not much tension.  C-&gt;G creates quite a bit of tension and G-&gt;C resolves much of the tension.\n\nSo to answer the original question you will be able to improvise better by learning your scales/chord tones (these are related, chords are made of every other note of a scale).  C chord is C E G from (C D E F G A B).  Once you know what tones fit into what parts of the song, you can pick which ones you want with ease.  It all gets more complicated, but that's the basics.  \n\nOr you could forget all about the tones, just play the roots and 5ths (C &amp; G on a C chord), and improvise interesting counter rhythms.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428082720", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "If you read through the explanation above, starting with the **Colors** section reading through the **Scale Degrees and Fretboard Steps** section, you'll get something a bit more than an ELI5.\n\nRight now, as a starter, I'd say you should know that 90+% of all western music relies on one of the diatonic scales.  These are the scales with 7 degrees (notes) in them, with two half steps (1 fret) with maximal separation between chunks of two frets.\n\nUhh what you say?\n\nThe octave has 12 notes in it.  After you hit the next octave you start over at the original note, just a higher version of it.\n\nSpace those 1 fret steps as far as you can.  1212222 is no good because those 1's can get further apart.  It's not bad, it's just not the diatonic scale.  1222212 has the same problem.  2212221, 2122212, 1222122, etc all space the 1's as far apart from each other as possible.  \n\nThose are modes of the diatonic scale.  Major (Ionian) is 2212221.  Minor (Aolian) is 2122212.\n\nUsing those intervals you can start at any point on the guitar and derive the next 6 notes in that scale, finally ending on the same note you started with, just a higher version.\n\nSing the melody to one of your favorite songs a little bit higher or lower than normal - not a whole octave - just a little bit.  Still recognize it?  That's what the scale degrees are for.

This really set the tone for my week in music. I've been putting off listening to this album for weeks. Soft-spoken singer-songwriter stuff just isn't my thing at all. But something about this just clicked with me perfectly. I ended up listening to this on repeat for hours. I don't think an album has ever redefined my taste in music to quite this extent. Gorgeous. AOTY. **10**\n\n**Bruce Springsteen - Born to Run**: I'd only heard Nebraska before, which was really nice. But *this*. A towering epic that sent chills down my spine. Jungleland and Born to Run are two of the greatest songs I've ever heard. \"She's the One\" and \"Thunder Road\" are incredible too. **10**\n\n**Nick Drake - Pink Moon**: I'd heard people talking up this album on the sub earlier in the week. I felt strangely compelled to listen to it after falling in love with Goon. It's just an absolutely beautiful album, well worthy of the praise it receives. I look forward to checking out Nick Drake's other albums. The title track and Place to Be were particularly lovely. **10**\n\n**B L A C K I E - True Spirit and Not Giving a Fuck**: Haha, definitely a change of pace from the preceding artists. Actually, I listened to this earlier in the week before I had my singer-songwriter epiphany. I've been looking for something like Death Grips for years, and finally I've found it. And I owe it all to you guys! A few people recommended B L A C K I E when I was asking for recs similar to Death Grips a couple of months ago. Thanks, guys! This is hard fucking core. I'd say it's my #3 album of 2011, which is such an incredible year in indie music. Every track on this goes hard. I wish more releases were under 20 minutes long. **10**\n\n**Randy Newman - Sail Away**: Randy Newman is fucking hilarious, and just a pleasure to listen to. [Political Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iiv-6fMKyY) made me laugh so hard. **8.75**\n\n**Harry Nilsson - Aerial Ballet**: He was one hell of a songwriter. It's mostly lovely, though his voice got a little grating after a while. He was behind some really incredible music that I never would've guessed came from one man. I especially love [Daddy's Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thtzVSA6Vm4). **8.5**\n\n**Godspeed You! Black Emperor - 'Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress'**: Simultaneously great, and the biggest disappointment of the year. **8.5**\n\n**Gene Clark - No Other**: A fuller and more country-leaning sound than I was in the mood for, but it's an enjoyable listen. I think he'd be a lot better without a choir behind him. I liked the more stripped-down moments. **8.25**\n\n**Carl Sweatervest - I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside**: I really loved the dreamy production, especially on [Grief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ5Mu2gs-M8). **8.25**\n\n**Angels of Light - We Are Him**: I need more time with this one, but I was digging it a whole lot.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428114400", "subreddit": "indieheads", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In very broad terms, this whole game is a matter of knowing what to do and when to do it. A diamond player, compared to a bronze player, has much better decision making skills. They'll be much less likely to be caught out, they'll have a better understanding of the dynamic of a lane, and be able to identify enemy mistakes more quickly, and take advantage of them.\n\nMechanics is more or less a tool that can be used for these things. They represent your manual control of your champion and your champion's abilities. Having better mechanics means that you can take advantage of more and more of your opponent's mistakes. At the same time, it also reduces what a \"mistake\" is for you. If you're better with using Zed's shadows, or even flash, you're a lot harder to catch than someone who may run into a wall 25% of the time. On the aggressive side, better mechanics means you win closer/more fights, and your threat zone is much larger. (for example, a Leblanc player with basic skills can probably w q r e w when the root hits. A more advanced one may have w flash r q e r let the root hit, w in their arsenal, which does less damage but can threaten from over half a screen away, which means your threat zone for damaged enemies is MUCH larger than before).

{"body": "I'm not completely sure what you mean with this question, but I'll try to explain the process.\n\nThe decimal system is pretty simple, it goes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.  The hexadecimal system isn't too different, it goes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f.  There are easy ways to multiply in base ten, but they require that you know how to multiply any number less than 10 by any other number less than ten.\n\nFor instance, this is the way that we are taught to multiply in school:\n\n     1234\n    x5\n     ------\n       20\n      150\n     1000\n    +5000\n    --------\n     6170\n\nI could only figure that out without a multiplication table because I already knew 4\\*5 = 20, 3\\*5 = 15, 2\\*5 = 10, and 1\\*5 = 5.  You can do the same if you know the products of the first 16 (0-f) digits in hexadecimal.  So, a similar problem in hexadecimal would be:\n\n     2a4d\n    xa\n    -----\n        82\n       280\n      6400\n    +14000\n    -----\n     1a702\n\nI was able to do that the same way that I could in base 10, but I had to know that d\\*a = 82, 4\\*a = 28, a\\*a = 64, and 2\\*a = 14 (all in hexadecimal, even though none of the answers happened to have letters in them).  I then added the numbers in hexadecimal, and got 1a702.  \n\nLet me know if that didn't clear things up.  The message I'm trying to get at is that you will always need to know the one-digit multiplications, even in base 10, but you don't need a look-up table for anything else.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428200567", "subreddit": "answers", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Been a while since I last did formal music theory but here's my 2c:\n\nI'm not sure if you are sticking to the one key during your song. If you look at classical composers, their pieces tend to change from key to key. The tendency there is move from a minor key to its relative major, or vice versa. \n\nAs an example: if you start with A minor, then you can change to C major as that is its relative major. \n\nThe easiest way to work out relative majors and minors is to pick a major key, then go down three tones. So C major / A minor, D major / B minor, G major / E minor, etc.\n\nAnother way of playing around with keys is using harmonic and melodic minors as well as natural minors. \n\nNatural minor: a major key played a third below.\n\nHarmonic minor: the same as above but with a raised 7th.\n\nMelodic minor: Raised 6th and 7th.\n\n\nSo how that looks:\n\n\nA natural minor: A B C D E F G A \n\nA harmonic minor: A B C D E F G# A\n\nA melodic minor: A C B D E F# G# A\n\nI think that's a good starting point if you want to mix up your use of scales. Hopefully that's not redundant information for you.\n\nPersonally I don't actively use scales at all in my playing or composing anymore. I might apply it now and again indirectly but I don't write to any specific key or chord progression. \n\nEdit: formatting", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428210912", "subreddit": "WeAreTheMusicMakers", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Why was his raise so small pre if he's got a premium hand that he's representing turn? It's distinctly possible that he raised with tens pre or even 3s 5s or 6s. What we do on the turn is very dependant on our read on the v.\n\nHand 3.\n\nFloating pre is okay in a cash game. \n\nFlop call is okay, a little on the speculative side but I don't hate it.

{"body": "it's basically the same thing, but it would be better to write y(x) = ... just to make clear that y depends on x. And it's an indication that y changes if you change x (there are some exception, but in general if you just write y = ... one would assume that y is constant. It starts to become very important as soon as you have many different parameters (which you usually represent by different letters) in your function. \n\n\nIf you just write down y = a*b*c+d*e*f it could be a extremely complicated problem if y changes with all of those. But if you write down y(c) or f(c) you know that y only changes when you change c and it's a simple linear problem, because a b d e f are just some constant parameters. And as far as i know f just stands for function. In physics you usually call the functions according to what they describe usually they depend on the time (t) and for example describe a velocity (v). And to make that easy to spot you'd just call your function v(t). \n\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add something to my physic example\n\nv = ... would make sense if you have a car with a constant speed, you could change the time (t) but it wouldn't change the velocity (v), it just wouldn't change over time. \n\non the otherhand\n\nv(t) = ... would indicate that the care speeds up or slows down, that means for each time (t) you will have a different velocity (v)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428266742", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

There is no advice or words that can stop the pain- BUT- My advice to you is to recognize that you are capable of developing a deep love and loyalty for another person (which is a wonderful thing) and to police yourself on who you choose to have in your life. Don't assume you'll never find someone else worthy of this affection. And btw you may never forget this person- I often think about the 3 people I fell in love with - very painful- but eventually - I promise- you'll look back with a smile and see it was a chapter in your life- not the whole book. But to address your more immediate concern it's very important to spend time with others so you get it through your head that this person wasn't the one and only human worthy of your affections- in other words the only cure for a love is another love. Make an effort to throw away all the pictures- turn the music when its sad. Take care of yourself- defend yourself. Don't wallow in self pity. Your goal here is to not become jaded on love and to carry over any insecurities that might sabotage your future love life. \n\nSet a time for yourself to mourn the end of this one and then get the fuck up- dust yourself off and go hang out with o t h e r  p e o p l e  \n\nDid she make you cry\n\nMake you break down\n\nShatter your illusions of love\n\nAnd is it over now do you know how\n\nPick up the pieces and go home.

Her 2 is just  A W E S O M E  - insane dmg, shotting people through walls = best feel ever. You can stun whole team with just one ability that does 1k dmg at max range. Her 3 is strong if you know how to use it. It steals magical protections, silences an enemy and saves your butt. Her ult can change everything.

I can't find much on it online though, but now I see it's not just me who's skeptic! I loved her videos and she seemed like a sincere person, but wow, never expected this of her.  I'm finding this whole situation odd; theres no substantial proof. \nI found this on the ysabellabravefriends website: \n\n''Friends, this is Ysabella’s life on the line here.  Please give and continue to reach out to others for support.  Let Ysabella know she’s not forgotten but actively LOVED and NEEDED ALIVE!  Her immediate need is nearly  $ 1,000.00 to live in the week coming!  Remember, her needs, like everyone’s, are ongoing, and she has NO income besides our gifts, so a contribution in the past, while lovely, doesn’t help her NOW!  Show some love and practical support now and regularly!  Thank you!''  \n\nI mean, seriously? it all looks so very fake to me. Also: \n\n\"I'm in a dangerous place. Undergoing surgery to see if I have cancer and cannot afford that or the medicine. PLEASE HELP. PLEASE - I do not want comments - PLEASE RUN to PAYPAL and send ANYthing to ysabellabrave@aol.com to             H E L P M E S O O N +Ysabella\"'\n\nIf you think about it, its a simple way to make money, isn't it? Also she probably hasnt explicitly posted a video about this asking for money etc, because then she can be held liable when shit does hit the fan. Now, if she gets accused for being a scammer, she can't be held liable. if she gets sued she can always claim that shes been ''hacked'' and that these posts weren't made by her, and its someone making money off of her name. However, if she actually posts a video of herself saying it, and people then find out it was a scam all along, she'd be in much more serious trouble. I think thats also why she's been keeping things low key lately. I agree, it is very sickening indeed, that Ysabella would do something like this. Completely turned my view of her upside down. \n\nPerhaps we could do something about it, spread the word so other people don't get scammed. Yet there's still a tiny part of me that fears she might really be sick. But, like we both agree on, the whole situation is fishy and she's unwilling to provide us any proof.

{"body": "It's a variant on a system that was developed at UCLA in the 60's, called \"TUBS\" (Time Unit Box System).\n\nhttps://thedrumkey.wordpress.com/tubs-notation/\n\nThe reasons that are generally given for its usage are that it is intuitive and can easily represent ideas that require more consideration in Western standard notation. Drums often have a large number of different hits that you can perform, because the drummer can hit the center of the drum head, the edge of the drum head, anywhere in between, the rim of the drum, do any of those as a resonant tone, as a nonresonant tone, as a muted tone, as a slap tone, and if the drum is played in an asymmetrical manner (such as the darbuka), the names of the tones produced by the right hand are different from the names of the tones produced by the left hand. That's all for one drum. Try to put all of that on a staff and have it look nice. This website gives an example of how to incorporate the syllables for djembe into TUBS:\n\nhttp://djemberhythms.com/lessons/beginner.htm\n\n\nYou can substitute G g P D d T (different tones on the djembe) for the X's that you've already seen in your textbook. Way easier than making a new notehead for every tone, then having to provide a key for tones that a djembe player already knows.

{"body": "well learning to really read music/sight read will be hugely beneficial, if you are having trouble naming fretboard notes than you have a long way to go before being able to actually sight read proficiently (most guitarists have this problem, i have this problem, it is a problem worth correcting though). \n\nand on a more basic level just start playing scales on your guitar. no matter how much you \"see\" scale patterns and chord shapes etc. there is just no substitute for playing them over and over for hours. that's where all the familiarization comes from and how the images in your head become ingrained into your fingers. play scale after scale and say the notes aloud to yourself. start with every major scale and just learn them inside out, then move onto pentatonics, modes, and then all the other stuff. \n\nit is much more helpful to visualize the scales as gatherings of notes and not just as patterns, then you can more easily apply music theory/composition when you're ready. practice intervals, do 3 notes and 4 notes per string on scales all up and down the neck. \n\ni like to alter my scale degrees when practicing and move them around like this for example in C maj: \n\ngo up 2 and back 1\n\n1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 6 8\n\nC E D F E G F A G B A C (x2)\n\nor practice scales in intervals like this here: \n\nhttp://jamieholroydguitar.com/how-to-practice-guitar-scales\n\nfinally, practice over backing tracks once you start getting your scales down. try to keep expanding your theoretical knowledge to give you more knowledge of what you can play over what chords, how to play with various changes. stuff like soloing strategies will come naturally in time from learning other songs, having all these scales ingrained into your head, and understanding why you're playing what you're playing. try and work on learning stuff by ear and internalizing keys/intervals, also record yourself and listen to what you're doing. i'm not sure how good your theory is, but i never learned piano, so i like to build chords in my head when i'm out at dinner and stuff to try and make the process of using a \"mental piano\" in my head to build chords. \n\nif you do all that stuff for hours every day and carve out maybe an hour for pure speed building you will have a solid foundational workout. i'm by no means a virtuoso and i'm not a guitar teacher but i find this stuff helpful, hopefully it will at least provide you with an idea of how to go about familiarizing yourself with the neck. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428356458", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In short, it's like you took the sounds English uses, removed some of them with no discernible pattern, and then invented a way to spell it that's even worse than the existing ortography of English, which is already the worst in Europe.\n\nHere is some constructive criticism:\n\n1. You are using the Latin alphabet. What you are attempting to show is the phoneme inventory and the ortography. Try to make the ortography as similar to IPA as possible without using too many special characters.\n\n2. Look at the tables in [this wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). Organize your phonemes like that, and you'll see what patterns emerge. Normally, sounds come in series. So, rows or columns, although there will be empty cells. Size does not matter, some natural languages have very small phoneme inventories, but what matters more, assuming you want to create a naturalistic language, is whether the sounds come in series that go together.\n\n3. I haven't put all your sounds into a table, but looking it over, there are some odd things that come about from what seems like a process of just picking out some of the sounds English has at random. For instance, the stops /p b t d k g/, as you can observe on the IPA chart, go together. /p b/ are voiceless and voiced bilabial stops, /t d/ are alveolar stops and /k g/ are velar stops. You have a voiceless bilabial stop, no alveolar stops, and a voiced velar stop. If your language contrasts voiced and voiceless stops, I would expect it to have either /p b/ or /k g/, or all of them, not one of each. Nothing wrong with having few consonants, but I would humbly suggest something like /p t k/ (no voicing distinction), possibly *the* 3 most common consonants worldwide.\n\n4. Your vowel inventory is extremely English-y. I'd familiarize myself with some other languages. If you want to try something not very English, try to go for vowel harmony. This is when any word can only contain vowels from one set or the other (for instance, only front or only back vowels - or possibly neutral ones in the center), and this affects affixes too. Finnish and Turkish do this. \n\n5. Also, you don't need to write diphthongs with one letter when you can more legibly do it with two: write ai instead of i-with-something-or-other-added-to-it. The reason English looks so odd is because of the [Great Vowel Shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift). This is not typical of the world's languages, nor does it help anyone else understand what you're talking about.\n\n6. You could also try adding in tones or pitch accent. English doesn't have those.\n\n7. You have /æ/ and /ai/ but no /a/??\n\n8. [ç] is a perfectly fine sound but not the one you're looking for. You seem confused about ortography and phonology.\n\n9. If you weren't just taking English - a few sounds, the length distinction on vowels would be weird. Why not contrast, say, /u/ and /u:/? Why must there be a difference in both quality and length? Sort of goes back to the stops: you'd kind of expect, if there is a voicing distinction, that two sounds that are otherwise the same would be contrasting by voice only, somewhere. And here, you'd expect the same vowel to be contrasting by length only, somewhere. Or that would be the more usual kind of thing.\n\n10. If you want a small but realistic consonant inventory, you can steal one [from here]. Rotokas has only /p b t d k g/ (see how that's three pairs of voiceless/voiced?). Then you can add a small vowel inventory like /i a u/.\n\n11. Don't worry, it'll be fine. It's just that you're making a large amount of beginner mistakes.

{"body": "**TL;DR**: If you assign points to the number of neighbors (each neighbor adds 1 point) and distance from door (spots A and B have 1 point, C and D have 2 points, E and F have 3 points) and you pick the spot with lowest score, with that configuration spot A scores less than spot E.\n\n ---\n\n**GAME SETTINGS**\n\nI took a trip to the site (www.urinalman.com) to understand what's going on. The site establishes that you are entering from the left, there are six urinals and makes you decide where to pee considering some urinal-availability configuration.\n\nLets give names to each stall.\n\n    _ _ _ _ _ _\n    A B C D E F        \n\nYour guy symbol messes up with the layout, so I'll change to this format: 0 empty, 1 taken. So, the above configuration looks like this:\n\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    A B C D E F\n\nThe basic rules would be:\n\n* It takes you the same amount of time to get from one spot to the next one, *i.e.* reaching spot A takes you *t* time, reaching spot B takes you 2*t* time, reaching spot C takes you 3*t* time, etc. Lets say *t* = 1 seconds, thus, reaching spot A takes you 1 seconds, reaching spot B takes you 2 seconds, reaching spot C takes 3 seconds, etc.\n\n* Every guy spends the same amount of *P* time in the whole peeing ritual (unzipping, sticking-out, holding, aiming, peeing, drop-stroking, sticking-in, zipping, flushing, leaving. Yes, I'll assume nobody washes hands for the sake of the numbers). Lets say this whole ritual lasts 10 seconds. So, if you choose spot A in an empty configuration, it would take you 1 seconds to get to spot A (accumulated time, *a.c.* = 1 second), pee (*a.c.* = 11 seconds), walk out (*a.c.* = 12 seconds). So, the total amount of time you spend in the place equals **2 x ( Spot position x *t* ) + P**, where A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6. Replacing each factor: **( 2 x Spot x 1 seconds ) + 10 seconds** or **( 2 x Spot ) + 10**.\n\n* A new guy comes in every *G* time and it takes him 1 second to decide in which spot he'll pee. Lets say *G* = 5 seconds.\n\n* Spots A and F max. number of neighbors is 1, while spots B to E max. number of neighbors is 2.\n\n* Newcomers don't consider which spots will be available in the future, they only consider the spots available when they arrive.\n\n* You decide your position with a points system. System as follows: *neighbors* 0 neighbors = 0 points, 1 neighbor = 1 point, 2 neighbors = 2 points, *i.e.* you always prefer spots where you don't have any neighbors; *distances from the door* A and B = 1 point, C and D = 2 points, E and F = 3 points, *i.e.* you always prefer the closest spot (A over F). The spot with fewer points is the best one.\n\n* You can't change your decision once you've made it.\n\n* Everyone is following these rules.\n\nThe popular strategy -as far as I'm concerned- in urinal picking is:\n\n* Stay as far as possible from any other dude, *i.e* reduce the number of -immediate- neighbors you can have at any time.\n\n* Stay as close as possible to the door, *i.e* choose the closest stall.\n\n---\n\n**START A HOME FROM SCRATCH**\n\nLets start filling up the places beginning at time 0.\n\nTime = 0 s.

{"body": "Learning about intervals is really useful and vital in how it relates to chords. It can get incredibly scientific, but it's sometimes worth reminding ourselves that, historically, most of music's academics often weren't usually practitioners as well.  Understandings have developed and sometimes changed over time, but today we normally use a system called Equal Temperament (ET) and this has been the case for roughly about 350 years - ever since keyboard instruments became popular. The guitar is designed for playing in ET which is why the frets are spaced the way they are, but also why you can't successfully join in with people playing medieval pipe instruments.  Sticking with today's system, the change in pitch between any note and the note two frets higher is called a Tone, and the change in pitch from any note to the note one fret higher is called a Semitone.  \n\nThe major scale is so called because it is the most used and convention dictates that it is the foundation from which everything else is named. The formula for creating the major scale from any note (called the Root) up to its octave is always constant: Tone, Tone, Semitone, Tone, Tone, Tone, Semitone (or TTSTTTS for ease of writing). As the root is your 1, the next pitch (one tone - two frets - above it) is the 2nd degree of the scale and that interval is also thus called a Second (I've only spelt it out to distinguish here; you wouldn't usually bother).  Progressing a further two frets (one tone) takes us to the 3rd degree of the scale; now the distance from the root to the 3rd is four frets, and that change in pitch we call a Major Third.  Referring back to our formula, the next pitch should only be one fret (a semitone) higher - this is the 4th degree of the scale, and the distance from the root note from which we began building our scale is five frets, so we describe that interval as a Fourth.\n\nIf we quickly pause here to look at the distance between the 2nd and the 4th degrees of the scale, we'll see it is only three frets - neither a Second nor a Major Third - so that is why we need to have some other name and usually we call it a Minor Third (you'll also occasionally come across Augmented Seconds, Sharpened Ninths and other esoteric names, but until you start composing serious classical music or jazz, it's broadly okay to think of these names all as the same beast in slightly different daylight).  Similarly, we need a name for the previously unfamiliar interval that's now lurking between the 3rd and 4th degrees of the scale - Minor Second is probably the most widely used (but again you'll also maybe hear other names like flattened ninth, diminished second - music theory developed separately in France, Italy and Germany during the 17th and 18th centuries, so it sometimes depends which system was taught, along with other considerations we'll not go into here).\n\nReturning to building our scale, from its 4th degree we proceed by a measure of one tone (two frets) to create the 5th degree, another tone to create the 6th degree, another tone to create the 7th degree, and finally a measure of a semitone (one fret) to create the 8th degree also called the Octave.  Measured along the same string, the 5th degree of the scale should be seven frets above its root, and that difference in pitch is the interval we describe as a Fifth. The same principle applies when naming the other intervals.\n\nIt's also hugely important to know that all these notes and names can change depending on their function.  So in the scale of C Major we'll have the notes C D E F G A B C which are all white notes when looking at a piano, and the C Major chord is the root, 3rd and 5th (C, E &amp; G); our next chord using that alternate notes process will be D, F and A - as we know D to F is only three frets, that must make it a minor third, but A is still a 5th from D so we'll call this chord D minor (the 5th is played, but there's no need to include it in the naming).  The next chord is going to be E, G and B - and again we've got a minor third from E to G, and a regular perfectly standard 5th going from E to B.\n\nAs it's starting to get confusing with all these numbers, the convention is that we use roman numerals when we're describing chords that are built on any particular degree of a scale.  In this example the D minor chord is a II chord in the scale of C; the E minor chord is a III chord in the scale of C. Continuing this sequence: the IV chord (in C) will be F (and we don't need to call it F Major because it is always major unless we call it something else), the V chord is G (likewise), the VI chord is A minor. And then we come to build the VII chord and we notice that the notes are B, D and F - with the distance from B to D being a minor third, but the distance from B to F being only six frets, or a flattened fifth - so although we could play this if we were minded, its dissonant sound doesn't fit well with folk or pop music, so we usually tend to avoid employing the VII chord. Crucially, this has brought us to the point that a minor third followed by a major third will produce a fifth, and also a major third followed by a minor third will also produce a fifth - so once you know where to find your 3rds and 5ths (which are the core architecture of your chord progressions) it becomes far easier to add shades of colouring with sensitive use of the other intervals.

{"body": "Essentially you have all your major and minor chords, like is explained in this video, which consists of three notes. This gets extremely boring after a while though so people started adding extra notes in to add more flair to the chord. Adding notes requires a little knowledge of the scale unfortunately, but it's really very simple.\n\nEvery scale has 7 distinct notes, take C for example, C D E F G A B (it's the easiest because it has no flats or sharps.) A basic major chord, as explained in this video consists of the 1 the 3 and the 5, or C E G. Now to the adding of extras. A chord with C E G A in it would be considered a C6 chord, as is evidenced by A being the sixth scale degree, or the one right above the 5, G. Or C(sus)2 being C D E G\n\nThings get slightly more complicated with sevens though. For some reason, someone decided that if you say a C7, they mean a flatted seven, don't ask me why. So the seven of the C scale is B, so C7 means C E G Bflat. To counter this, if you don't want that flatted 7 sound, you have to say Cmaj7, which means don't flat the 7, or C E G B. \n\nThe major 7 does not mean whether the chord is minor or major, but that you don't flat the 7. So yes, there does exist a minor major chord. It is where you have a minor chord C Eb G, and add the \"major\" 7, C Eb G B. \n\nFor the record normal 7 chords are far more common (with the flatted 7), as this is a very jazzy sound. Almost every chord played in jazz you add the flat 7 to. And for the record, the flat 7 chord is technically called a dominant 7, but is notated by C7.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428549712", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Just that I have experienced 'superpowers' here that are quite different than the ones you have described and iI LOVE that I can attribute them to Christ in here.When I am in NoFap I generally just listen or redirect ppl that are trying to do this with Christ over here.NoFap is good wherever it happens..Well,so much for my rant&lt;g&gt;I'll go back to my corner,now.

{"body": "I'll try my best. \n\nYou have 7 notes in a scale, each with their own name: C, D, E, F, G, A or B. Coincidentally, that's also known as the C Major scale. This scale is special because it's the only major scale that has no flats or sharps at all, so the key signature would be blank. \n\nThe key signature is the little collection of sharps and flats like in the first two pictures in my previous post. It tells you what key a song is in, and what notes to make sharp or flat. So if instead of a C major scale we look at a D major scale, we can look at the key signature and see one sharp (F# &amp; C#). That means that anytime in the following piece of music that you see an F or C on the stave, you should play an F# or C#.\n\n\n\nSo why do we need a key signature? Well think of sharps as hats, and flats as shoes, but the notes are all standing on top of each other and there's only room for one clothing accessory per note on this weird complicated totem pole analogy.\n\n\nMusicians are eternally lazy and we don't want to have to read or write anything more than completely necessary, and that follows over to notes as well. That F and C from before don't want to have to put their hats on every single time they show up on the page, so we just make them wear their hats at the photo op at the very start of the piece (At the key signature). \n\nFrom then on out if they show up nude, you already know that they're supposed to be wearing a hat so you can work around their perpetual laziness and poor work ethic by just remembering the photo op in your head and remembering that, 'Oh yeah, 2 guys are wearing hats today which means (if you consult your mentally ingrained circle of 5ths) that F and C are gonna be sharps'. If the key says 5 guys are wearing hats, then you know that F C G D &amp; A (Going around the circle of 5ths again) are all gonna be looking mighty sharp today.\n\nNow the problem we run into with mixing sharps and flats is that, let's say for instance we use the B major example from before.\n\n\n    B Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb B\n    1 2  3  4  5  6  7  1\n\nNow if you were to write this in a key signature you would have 6 flats. A quick gander around our circle of 5ths would indicate that we're playing in G flat major, and unless your musicians are smart and on to the ball (if we were smart we'd be in finance), it's going to look and sound terrible when you get musicians to try and play it. \n\nTake the B for example. In the key signature you would have to indicate that the B was a flat, or in other words, every time you came across a B it would be wearing shoes. Now this is great and all, that B is getting his life together and trying to stop being a dirty hippy and actually wear more than canvas socks around his local mall, but the actual scale is a B major scale. Not a B flat or B sharp major scale, but a stark naked B major scale.\n\n So every time you see him in the music you should see him in all his anti-capitalistic pasty nude glory. But according to the key signature he's supposed to have his shoes on. So not only does this confuse musicians who have to actually look, read and think about what notes are supposed to be wearing what, but every single time a B appears, he's gotta figure out whether he's supposed to be wearing shoes or if he's nude in that particular appearance and as we already know, notes are lazy and we've gotta work around that. \n\nSo we do that by having consistent key signatures, where every note gets a specific uniform for the piece and after that he can mostly just show up to work nude, and where musicians can reference the conventions and standards in our head and easily and coherently read a piece of music.\n\nJust ask if need clarification on anything.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428567165", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I can't really think of any off the top of my head, I mean the LCK is great, &amp; having a quick looks at some of the [WALS Chapters](http://wals.info/chapter) is good... [This might help *show* stuff](http://conlang101.blogspot.com.au/)... For vowels I'd suggest skimming through [this](http://www.incatena.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=41583), or [this](http://gesc19764.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/vowels/vowel_systems.html)\n\nI'd strongly suggest looking up sound changes, &amp; seeing how common different things are, &amp; what sort of environments they happened in, maybe have a look at how a phoneme inventory changed through a few languages, trace back through the language family, doesn't need to be really in-depth, but it should give a feel for more.\n\n\nMainly I think it's good to keep in mind how it fills up the table; say you've decided that the 'lang is going to have a voicing distinction in both plosives &amp; fricatives ^([slightly less common than having the distinction with *just* plosives, but more common than *only* in fricatives, but somewhat less common than not having a voicing distinction]);\n\n/m n p t k/ seem to be almost \"universals\", that is you'll see something *like* them in almost every natlang, however as we have a voicing distinction we can pretty much 'assume' /m n p b t d k g/, now those six plosives seem to be nice &amp; symmetrical &amp; spaced out, two labial, 2 coronal, 2 dorsal; however one can fairly 'easily' change this a bit, /p/ is somewhat less audible than the other stops, so it isn't that unusual for it to be missing, /g/ is somewhat harder to produce than other voiced stops 'because' of its location in the mouth.\n\n(It requires more effort to keep the vocal cords vibrating correctly with the tongue in this area, its a somewhat confined space, in front of the uvular, &amp; if you move forward you start to end up with something more palatal, &amp; eventually alveolar ^(possibly the 'largest' space in the mouth with freedom, hence the alveolars /n t s r l/ being pretty populous, &amp; common, /l/ seems to be the default not say either /ʎ ʟ/!).)\n\nBut /m n b t d k/ isn't even half the picture, so for fricatives, /s/ is very distinctive &amp; even though I think ^(*unsure-unsure*) that children tend to produce this slightly latter than other phonemes ^(labials tend to be first, alveolars tend to come without to much issue with exception to /r/, /θ ð/ are also a bit harder generally although they're dental...), so it's probably going to be a go to phoneme most of the time, as we're doing voicing we might as well ad in /z/, I might skip /ʃ ʒ/, or only have /ʃ/ &amp; even then rarely....\n\nWith /ɸ β f v/ I'd be content to skip on but if you wanted some I'd suggest using /v/ (&amp; maybe /f/), /ɸ β ʂ ʐ ɕ ʑ/ are all phonemes I tend to feel I have to 'justify' more, so I might say (to myself) that /ɕ ʑ/ came from palatised /ʃ ʒ/, &amp; if those are palatised maybe I should have other palatised phonemes - so maybe some selection of /nʲ tʲ dʲ kʲ gʲ/  or maybe have actual palatal stops (/c ɟ/); my goal is to complete a 'series', try and work some sort of pattern, \n\nSo even if I don't have palatals &amp; decide that my inventory will be /m n b t d k g v s z ʃ x ɣ r j (vowels)/ - I've returned /g/ as I like it, &amp; I added both /x ɣ/ as i already had a 'gap' with only 1 labial fricative, however because its that tiny bit harder to have voiced phonemes at the velar, I'll eliminate /ɣ/ as I want /g/, then again I might go a different way &amp; replace /b/ with /p/, replace /d/ with a flap (/ɾ/) which is similar (it's a voiced alveolar, &amp; is roughly put a very quick /d/), have /ɣ/ instead of /g/, have /ʃ/ merge with/into /s/, it might not look very exciting but I've turned a fairly bland English minus a few things + good ol' /x/ into Finnish, the main difference being that I have /v/ rather than /ʋ/ &amp; /t/ instead of /t̪/ which *I* think are fairly justifiable sound changes, &amp; hey my /t/ might even be [t̪] fairly often &amp; I've just chosen a broader transcription ;)\n\nFor something more 'interesting', I'd try &amp; add in entire dimensions, so /m p f t̪ θ n s l ʈ ʂ ɻ ŋ k x/, so I may have 'started' with labials, dentals, retroflexes, &amp; velars; but hypothetical /n̪ ɳ/ have merged to a point in-between to 'plain' /n/, from here I might introduce phonemic aspiration so: /m pʰ f t̪ t̪ʰ θ n s l ʈʰ ʈ ʂ ɻ ŋ kʰ k x/, again I've skimped on /p/, I've only left an aspirated version... Either way the inventory is somewhat balanced, /θ/ is rather unusual, so I wouldn't be surprised to see it go.\n\n[If you're interested in pharyngeals...](http://www.amritas.com/110723.htm)\n\nFor vowels though, I'd really suggest starting off with something in the vicinity of /i a u/ then adding vowels in which are *roughly* **equidistant** apart, so maybe adding /e ɛ o̞/, it's not symmetrical, but the spacing isn't unbelievable, you could easily say that the /u/ isn't fully backened, it might even be more accurately described as /ʊ/ for example, but the more vowels there are the stranger things they seem to do.\n\nSomething to definitely keep in mind with vowel is that front ('palatal') vowels tend to be unrounded, &amp; back ('velar') vowels tend to be rounded, whilst low vowels tend to be unrounded regardless, however it is also more likely to have a front(ish) vowel that is rounded than a unrounded non-low back vowel; eg f you have /i u e o ɛ ɔ ä/ I'll sooner expect you to add /y ø/ than (any *combination* of) /ɯ ɤ (ʌ)/, also if you're going to have front rounded vowels start 'high' or close &amp; work down generally, that is I expect to see /y/ before /ø/ &amp; definitely before /œ/.\n\nIf you're going to have nasal vowels, then they tend to be lower, &amp; there are usually less nasalised vowel than non-nasalised vowels, so if you had /i u e̞ o̞ ä/ &amp; introduced nasal vowels I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up with /i u e o ɛ̃ ɔ̃ ä/, the nasalised /e̞ o̞/ have been lowered, &amp; 'plain' /e̞ o̞/ have drifted away to help further differentiate them - not essential, but also not surprising. Languages with 6+ vowels seem to tend to having some sort of 'schwa' like vowel, so something mid-central-ish, this will also typically be the sound they insert if they are struggling with a cluster, so for Modern (Israeli) Hebrew I believe **ɛ** serves this role, although otherwise speaking their vowels are /i e̞ ä o̞ u/.\n\nIf you were to introduce Uvulars you might want to see how that effects vowels, just as front vowels are *sometimes* termed palatal (as they're in that vicinity), &amp; back vowels 'velar', so are low (back) vowels associated with the uvular or particularly the pharyngeal - it's of note that the vowels [i y ɯ u] have semivowel equivelants [j ɥ ɰ w], [ʕ̞] (a pharyngeal) is sometimes considered to be counterpart to [ɑ]\n\nMaybe you only have /ɨ ä/! &amp; velars &amp; labials typically cause them to backen &amp; round, uvulars cause them to backen &amp; lower, &amp; everything else tends to front them? - If you are wondering why I say labials to backen them even though the lips are forwards, it's because labials &amp; velars seem to be in a relationship, /w/ is a rounded ^(with the lips) [ɰ] a velar approximate, in fact I believe sequences like /tw dw/ have sometimes become /p b/; seeing sound-changes that have happened helps give a feel for what sort of relationships one might expect to find, it won't necessarily be perfect or as naturalistic as one might think, but it can help. As for the two vowel system I wouldn't suggest doing that unless you're going to have an extensive consonant inventory ^(probably with palatised, velarised, &amp; rounded/labialised components etc.).\n\n[For ideas that might be rather unrealistic, but never the less, you might see soemthing you like that could realistically work...](http://000024.org/cgi-bin/gleb.cgi)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428603612", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm not Catholic. But I've done some research on saints or those that followed after the disciples. I carry a Saint Benedict Medal around my neck. On the front of the medal is Saint Benedict holding a cross in his right hand, the object of his devotion, and in the left his rule for monasteries. On the back is a poisoned cup, in reference to the legend of Benedict, which explains that hostile monks attempted to poison him: the cup containing poisoned wine shattered when the saint made the sign of the cross over it (and a raven carried away a poisoned loaf of bread). Above the cup are the words Crux sancti patris Benedicti (\"The Cross of [our] Holy Father Benedict\"). Surrounding the figure of Saint Benedict are the words Eius in obitu nostro praesentia muniamur! (\"May we be strengthened by his presence in the hour of our death\"), since he was always regarded by the Benedictines as the patron of a happy death. \n\nOn the back is a cross, containing the letters C S S M L - N D S M D, initials of the words Crux sacra sit mihi lux! Non draco sit mihi dux! (\"May the holy cross be my light! May the dragon never be my overlord!\").[3] The large C S P B stand for Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti (\"The Cross of [our] Holy Father Benedict\"). Surrounding the back of the medal are the letters V R S N S M V - S M Q L I V B, in reference to Vade retro satana: Vade retro Satana! Nunquam suade mihi vana! Sunt mala quae libas. Ipse venena bibas! (\"Begone Satan! Never tempt me with your vanities! What you offer me is evil. Drink the poison yourself!\") and finally, located at the top is the word PAX which means \"peace\". \n\nBecause the medal represents both an empty cross (Jesus wasn't on the cross when he beat death) and what Saint Benedict went through. It holds meaning to me as a Christian. What Jesus did for me and you and what this saint went through in defeating Satan holds serious power over evil. It has been with me going on 7 years after my own fight with Satan. Father Scorpio may add some more to it as I'm sure he studied Saint Benedict more so than I.

{"body": "I **highly** recommend using fertilizer *and* Jacob's Ladders because both increase the opportunity that you will grow blue roses and those are extraordinarily difficult to breed. \n\nDo not use those \"new reds\" you are getting from the red roses you have obtained by breeding orange and purple. The red roses that appear from the hybrid-reds are no longer considered \"hybrid\". For those roses, put them far away of your breeding hybrid-roses because they can mess things up. \n\nAs for the way you're breeding them, I created a square using Fertizlier (F), Jacob's Ladders (J), Hybrid Red Roses (R), and empty spaces (X) so it would look like this:  \n\nX X J X X  \nX R R R X  \nJ  R F R J  \nX R R R X  \nX X J X X  \n\nThis would yield, for me, the maximum possibility of obtaining hybrids. I kept them in an open space with nothing that may block or prevent hybrids from popping up. I would water every day, plant a new fertilizer in the middle every day, and check every morning. It took a *long* time, but once I got 2 blue, I started breeding them. \n\nSo, long and short: red roses are only hybrid if they have an orange or purple parent. A rose created created by hybrid-red roses is no longer hybrid. Fertilizer and Jacob's Ladders are your best friends. Water every day. Create enough space to yield maximum amount of hybrids. \n\nHope that helps! :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428621305", "subreddit": "AnimalCrossing", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "OK, I've been using this app for the last few days now, According to my logs, I've put in around an hour and ten minutes \"studying\" and I'd guess at least another hour browsing. This app is super convenient for studying kanji while I'm on break at work. So I'll come and give some of my further impressions. (Incoming wall of text)\n\nFirst off, I've gone through all the N5 Kanji and am decent at matching character to meaning. I don't feel confident learning pronunciation without audio, which seems beyond the scope of this app. \n\nI really like the browsing feature for just starting a kanji. It has pretty much all the information I would want to know, including what radicals it is made of (very useful to me for remembering). I appreciate how it keeps track of when I move between kanji from the different links on the browsing pages, it helps me get back on track if I go down a rabbit trail. It find being able to learn my accuracy in quizzes on a Kanji useful to know what I'm bad at as well. I don't really know what to do with the Kanji that have many Kun-yomi, but I'm not using this app to learn those so I won't comment on it further.\n\nThe Drill and Quiz feature, I feel, are opposites. One gives a meaning and you match the character the other gives a character and I use it to remember the meaning. I find Drill feature smooth to use, the only thing that sometimes gets me is when I rate a kanji as seen/familiar/known and it automatically advances me forward. However, I think that is the best way since it allows me to quickly rate multiple kanji. Sometimes I accidentally press for too long and shuffle the kanji, which is annoying. Its not an intuitive control, but its a pretty good one. I also just found out that swiping up takes me to drawing and down to browsing. Without directions this isn't obvious but now that I know, it makes sense and I really like this set-up. \n\nThe drawing tools are really good, I am often using it with my non-dominant hand while eating and it still picks up the motions I'm drawing and fills in the correct line. This sometimes means if I draw a line wrong enough, it will fill in the correct line but that's only happened when I was testing to see if it was possible, so not an enormous issue and I appreciated how loose it was. However, I could also just put a dot on some of the shorter lines and it fills in, I'm not sure if this is intended or not. All in all the drawing section fulfills its purpose very well, as does the app in general.\n\nAs far as quizzes go, its a great system. The given options for a meaning are a good selection of relatively similar kanji so you can't just remember a general shape. The quizzes are really quick which is awesome because it means I can review a lot of kanji on my breaks. I did find that sometimes I wasn't really given enough time to recognize a kanji if I looked at the opposite side of the options first. (Ie, if kanji are set up in 2 rows, A B C D and E F G H and I looked at H first and A was correct). Once when I had only seen about 20 kanji I was able to correctly identify the answer because there was only one kanji I had seen before as an answer and the rest I hadn't seen. Now that I've seen all the N5 kanji, this doesn't happen any more and I find the kanji available as answers to be a good mix of ones from the set I'm studying and ones similar to the kanji I need to pick. \n\nAll in all, I'd rate this 5/5. It is perfect for my needs and a great supplementary learning source. I really look forward to what you can do with this. In reading other posts I saw you listed a lot of potential updates that I would've loved to suggest anyways so I won't go over those. I hope this data is somewhat useful or encouraging to you.

{"body": "Paragraphized:\n\nMy next door neighbor of 12 years has a lawn care business and has done my yard the entire time I've lived here. He has always, always, ALWAYS checked with me before going in the back yard...expect this time.\n\nWe were out of town a couple weeks ago. The neighbor (let's call him Joe) and his friend (how about calling him Ray) were doing the mowing, edging, and weed eating of the yards on their route. Joe came to our door and rang the bell. No one answered and the dog, Poochie, barked for at least 90 seconds solid. Joe and Ray decided to enter the backyard fence anyway.\n\nPoochie went out the pet door and bit Ray on the leg. Ray chased the dog with the weed eater and yelled. Ray left and returned with a pitchfork. He stood at the back door screaming for the dog to come back outside so Ray could \"bury\" him and that it was \"time to die mother fucker.\" Did I mention I have all this on surveillance video??\n\nAnyway, I get a phone call from the neighbor's wife informing me Ray was bitten and going to the hospital. When we returned home two days later, Ray and Joe came over and demanded I pay the medical bills. Apparently there was a puncture wound that required a bandaid. \n\nI declined and asked why they came inside the fence without permission when Joe had always received explicit consent before going out back. Joe said he assumed someone was home even though there were no cars in the driveway and no one answered the door. Clearly, this guy uses an entirely different logic algorithm than I do. Joe and Ray stomped off back to their home next door.\n\nHalf an hour later Joe sent me text messages informing me he was taking down our shared fence that is technically on his property. HUH???? Because he couldn't shake me down for medical bills he is removing the fence to punish me? This guy is an irrational, unreasonable bully!!\n\nThe fence was removed on Saturday and I'm currently getting estimates for a replacement. And I received a letter from one of the local ambulance chasing law firms asking for my homeowner's insurance info. Eff off. You will get that info only when I'm legally compelled to disclose it during discovery. C R A Z Y This is the inspiration for a new fence.

Never spec anything else\n\nThrow -&gt; Piggy -&gt; Stun Punch (gets you much more kills than EQ)-&gt; Earthquake -&gt; Regen Punch (1)\n\nAfter that, anything you build needs to make sense for the situation\n\nIn Sorona? Go range punch\nFacing Frog? Get snarequake\nFacing slow tankish characters? Get Oily\n\nYou will get the hang of things with practice. Just one thing to not of utter importance. Tap each punch to better control when the 3rd big damage stun punch occurs. When you master this you can jump and control when you throw the big stun punch.\nDoing this will help you land good throws much more.\n\nAnother tip. Certain characters should cause you to play a little more conservatively. Skoll is a slow character who is easy to cc when out of position. Try to play lots of footsies until the right position, then go in for the big throw to get momentum back on your side. Skoll is all about momentum, so try to pick the right moment to claim it back/ keep it for your team\n\nGood luck man!

{"body": "Hey man glad to try to help. I'm by no means an expert but I'm pretty comfortable with theory. A dominant seven (in the context I was using it) is a tone interval actually , not a chord thing. A major scale consists of the root note then the notes up from there a whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, then half step back up to get you to the root again. Ie in c, it's C D E F G A B C, in the key of d it's D E F# G A B C# D, etc. the seventh note in this series is usually referred to as a major seventh but it's very conmon ( esp in blues and jazz music) to flatten that note and this is called the dominant seventh. It's interesting that a 7 chord is actually a major triad plus the dominant seventh, not the major seven, which may seem more intuitive. So a C7 chord is C E G Bb, not C E G B (which is called a major seven chord, Cmaj7 in this case). So the dominant seven interval is basically one whole step down from the root, and is the root of the chords the post was alluding too. The chord in the key of D would be a C major chord and the D's dominant seventh is a C.\n\nI typed all of this out on my phone about five minutes after waking up so apologies if it's confusing. Feel free to reply here or direct message me if anything didn't make sense or you have more questions, I love talking theory.

{"body": "&gt;Edit: before you vote me, go and watch the replay again, xerath has just used his flash and heal, xerath is walking in a straight line, thresh has vision during the whole play. It is harder to fail it than it is to hit it. In addition CJ already has a nice advantage so thresh had nothing to loose.\n\nOkay so you basically confirm that is was a very good decision for thresh to do that play, yes? So how is it overrating the play? Part of a good play is to KNOW that it will work in 90 percent of the times and to know all that stuff, that xerath flashed and healed for example that is a a) sign of good teammcoordination and b) good frame of mind for him to use this advantage to make a play. \n\nAnd i'll ask you another question, how many pros can you list that will in fact flash that wall and go for the play? It wouldnt really have mattered if xerath got away he wouldnt be able to do anything regardless, so tell me who do you think will do that? Just yolo flashing a wall going for a maxrange hook perfectly predicting his pathing?\n\nOf course its not SUPER impressive, its not gamechanging either but most support plays arent because support plays are relative to the teams pressure at any given moment in the game. You cant make that play if you are 2 k gold behind and have no dmg to finish him of for example, you wont get to a point where xerath tries to run away like this. I mean i get that you are salty and want to abuse kata in your low shitelo that is platin or gold or some shit, but please don't try to \"analyze\" a value of a play when you only have to press q w e r as fast as you can and get a quadra kill (when ahead aka no difference to this play).\n\nTHats it for today and as alway:\n\n#staysalty\n#Westernfanboisetheworst", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428674394", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Since nobody has answered this yet:\n\nThe scale is old.  There used to be something called a mode, which was the set of notes used to play a song.  There were different modes, and you'd have instruments that would be able to play those modes and you'd be able to sing them.  The exact tuning would vary from musician to musician, though they probably got passed down master to student, but that means that if you went from town to town the tuning would probably be different.\n\nAround the Middle Ages, they kinda realized that the modes in use at the time (which were different from the modes the Greeks used) used basically the same notes, so they figured out that maybe they should name them.  For example, the [hypodorian mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodorian_mode) used several notes, which in modern English would be called A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, with the final -- the tonic -- being D and the reciting tone being F.  These notes were given names: ut, re, mi, fa, so, la, si, after the initial syllables of a hymn (see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge)).  Ut was changed to do and si was changed to ti, but only in some places; some people still call them ut and si.\n\nBut as people continued to sing music, they would alter some of the notes to make them sound nicer.  For example, when they sang in the lydian mode -- in modern English notation, F G A B C D E F -- they would, more often than not, lower the B.  This came to be written as a small b, which then became a flat symbol.  It would sometimes be written above the note in the music, called musica ficta, to show that it should be sung lower, but sometimes it wouldn't be written at all and you'd need to know that in that mode, the B was low.  Other alterations to notes came into play, and by then, there were already seven notes in the scale and they could be altered.\n\nOf course, this was before we even had a 12-note system, and long before we had an *equal-tempered* 12-note system, where the notes are all equally spaced.  That wasn't a thing until the middle of the 1700's!  Before then, people used a variety of tuning systems.  Some even tried to use 19-note systems!  By the time 12-tone scales finally were established, the note names -- and the musical notation that corresponds to them -- had already been in place for centuries.  And they work well for Western music.  We have 7-tone scales, and each of them gets a letter name.  For example, Eb major is Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb.  Each of the notes gets its own letter name, but some of them might be flat or sharp or double flat or double sharp or half flat or three quarters flat or whatever.  That's important, because it shows that D and Eb are different degrees in the scale, unlike D and D#, which are the same degree, just with a different alteration.  So the system works, and there's no real reason to change it.\n\nNow, this system does *not* work for music that doesn't use scales at all: 12-tone music.  For that kind of music, the notation is a bit unwieldy, because Gb and G are different notes, not variations on the same scale degree, so why should they be on the same place in the staff?  Unfortunately, that's how people learn to read music.  Can't do much about that!  But when you're analyzing the music, you use the numbers 0-11 to describe them.

{"body": "I'm not able to speak for him in any way, but I think there is a suggested extra clause that champions that are easy-to-play / easy-to-master *and won't eclipse other options* are doomed to a lower win rate at higher tiers of play. This is suggested through the very next sentence in his post.\n\n&gt;(Because why would anyone gravitate towards learning the nuance of harder-to-master champions if it didn't pay any dividends for them in the end?)\n\nWith that additional clause I think taking some time to think about it will make it apparent why it can be considered pretty much impossible to do. \n\n* Say option A yields x result reliably and option B yields x result unreliably. At high skill levels these two will be functionally nearly identical, except option b might occasionally fail due to human error (say A works 100%, B works 90%).  If we assume players want to play to win, and win reliably, option B becomes less attractive. Option A and option B will probably hold similar win rates because they do the same thing in the context of the game as a whole, but if we assume players play to win and want to win reliably option B will most likely have a lower pick rate.\n\n* If we try to buff B to compensate for its inconsistency, say giving it a slightly better yield (say effect is now x * 1.1). Now at high levels of play B outperforms A 90% of the time. The slight buff might make up for Bs inconsistency, but maybe not enough to massively swing Bs win rate up. A and B still have similar win rates overall, but now B is likely to be picked more often as its pretty consistently straight up better.\n\nSo at this point we have a problem where despite two options being relatively similar in power, one is likely to be relegated into obscurity while the other enjoys the limelight. Solving this particular problem goes down the route of diversification of effects and introduces a number of possibilities that I'm a little too lazy to get into, but even then the problem above still exists. If I as a player, need a tool to win the game, and have options A B C D and E, I will always want to choose the one that provides me the most reliable *and* highest amount of power regardless of whatever kind of effect it might be.\n\nThis links into easy to play/master characters being doomed to a lower win rate because the harder to play and master ones *must be more powerful* for them to even see play (assuming an intent to design as many viable options as possible). If we take Option A and Option B from the second example, the winrate specific to A vs B is going to be skewed in B's favor, because 90% of the time it is that 10% better. Assuming we have a game where we have nothing but teams made up of a mix of As and Bs vsing each other, the teams with more Bs are more likely to win. As will suffer a lower win rate overall because of the fact that they are an A on their team and thus are worsening the possibility that they will have more Bs.\n\nSo that's why that specific clause of easy to play &amp; master &amp; don't push other options out being doomed to lower win rates typically holds true at a pretty boiled down level. Obviously in an actual game there are almost endless amounts of variables that can complicate the situation, but yeah.\n\nAs a side note Varus fits pretty perfectly into this because his payoff simply might not be either consistent or powerful enough. I'd suspect he basically has the same problem as Ashe/MF and has no real mechanism to deal with people jumping on him and melting him, so his payoff is basically 0 regardless of how strong his skills and kit are. That's sort of a problem with the concept of the champion and how it fits into how the game is currently being played, and there isn't a good way to fix that without violating the concept of the character. His situation is honestly not necessarily a bad thing, but that's a whole other topic.\n\nEdit: formatting whoo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428701688", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

Once you learn that the half steps are between E and F, and B and C, the system becomes much more useful, at least for music based on these scales.

Let's take an A melodic-minor scale spelled the conventional way:\n\n(ascending) A B C D E F# G# A (descending) A G F E D C B A\n\nand imagine in our new system:\n\n(ascending) A C D F H J L A (descending) A K I H F D C A\n\nNow we have the problem of the headache-inducing skipping letters, and that the J and L have no relation to the K and I, even though they are the same scale degrees, which is elegantly demonstrated by our standard system. \n\nIt's an interesting thought experiment, but as long as our music is based in these 7 note modes, the 7 letter system works best.

{"body": "Here is the original fanfic.\n\nJeremy Fitzgerald walked past the building, a smug look on his face walking to the nightwatch's office for the first time. As he entered through the back entrance, he saw a small, thick tablet and three entrances. He sat down on his desk chair and thought to himself;\"Why the hell am I doing this?\" Then, he remembered the reason he wanted to do this is because he was a motherfucking MLG noscoper badass. He checked the tablet and saw that he could check the cameras using it. He checked the show stage and saw the three toy animatronics; Toy Bonnie, a blue, rosy-cheeked rabbit animatronic. Toy Freddy, a badass fuckboy who makes the enragement child inhale, And... and... he could not speak another word. A tingling sensation was going to explode out of his pants. He saw... Toy Chica. He saw her slender tummywummy, her bangin' bumbum, and her small yet perky boobers on top of it all. The tingling sensation turned hard and he did not notice the bunny dude was gone. While he was imagining himself devouring that oven baked avian behind, Toy Bonnie went into his vents, looked at him forlornly, and said: \"What the actual fuck is he thinking about, and what the fuck is in his pants?\" The bunny was greeted by the guard, saying out loud to the public to hear, \"I WANT HER TO KISS ME ON DE DIK\" he said. Toy Freddy heard this and suddenly thought to himself \"What a fucking joke.\" and immediatley started to strip Toy Chica with his badass mind powers of tophattery. As he stripped off the small amount of clothing she had, her bib was showing off her jinglejangles, free for the world to see. \n\nThen, the guard started to do the Mario on top of Toy Chica, making dog noises. Toy Chica got horny because of this and then decided to go against programming and devour this man's \"breadstick\".She sat on his fuckstick and decided to do the uppy downy thingy and made cat noises on top of the dingy. She constantly did the uppy downy thingy and made delicious creamy white liquid sugar on top of he glorious metal white meated chicken breast. Toy Freddy, watching this, immediately calls Mangle and tells her to bite the fucking nightguard's frontal lobe off because \"He is a fucking feather-fucker.\" Mangle, recently fixed, was delighted to see the guard's jingle bells. Her metal hard nipperers went harderer, as she decided to join doing the do with you-know-who. She did the thing. Toy Freddy and Toy Bonnie watched in horror as the nightguard's \"cucumber\" was drained of all it's juicy, white, sugary liquid. Then, out of nowhere, Balloon Boy appeared and said \"What the fuck is this shit\", after pulling out a Purple Man. Purple Man (AKA VINCENT LOLOOLOLOL XXXOOOOXOXO &lt;333333 BEST SENPAI WAIFU) was experienced in the art of diddling. So, he grabbed his grapevine and joined the orgy pile now consisting of enragement fuckdickshit, Toy Slut, Mangle NotSoMangle Slut, and Jeremy Pimp. But,all of a sudden, Hitlerspimp came out of nowhere and started to explode sugary fluid. He reached 420,000,000,000,000,000 subscribers because of such a feat. In The Weekend 77984 came out just yeasterday and he was already 100x+ more successful than pooDEEpiiiiii.. After a long while of furiously fucking each other, the orgy pile noticed someone recording their \"activity\". It was the Puppet Man, doing Illegal things. Puppet Man bribed them to do some weed in exchange for the tape. They did so, and everyone started \"yes\"ing rapidly like one of those Nightcore remixes that are everywhere. Enragement FuckDickShit's pants joined the fray and grew a twig n' berries and then, Toy Chica was pregnant!!1!!11!!!1!!!!!\n\nWho was teh faddtha? no one knew.\nMeanwhile, In an alternate universe, Super Fucking Mario was having his nightly royal fucksession with every princess in  the tri state area of the mushroom kingdom.\nHe was just about to finish with Shantae when he heard the cry of Freddy Fuckboy.\nresonating through the alternate universes. He decided to fuck the arabian beauty some other day and help the ursine man in his plight. As he grabbed ahold of his arm, he transferred to the office, with thee following in an orgy pile. Jeremy, Toy Chica, Mangle, Enragement Child, Hitlerspimp, Mangle, Enragement Child's pants, and the newly joined Toy Freddy and Bonnie. They were all havin so much fun except for toy chica.

{"body": "The key of C major is the easiest one because it doesn't have any sharps or flats. The complete **C major scale is C D E F G A B C**, think about this scale as a circle that keeps going on and on and remember this are the **only notes allowed** to make chords in the key of C major. \n\nLets begin with the C major chord: C is root, E is 3rd and G is 5th, as you can see we are taking the root note, jump two letters, now we're in the 3rd, jump another two letters and now we're in the 5th. If we keep on doing this with the rest of the notes it would be as follows:\n\n* D minor: D - root, jump two, F - 3rd, jump two, A - 5th\n\n* E minor: E - root, jump two, G - 3rd, jump two, B - 5th\n\n* F major: F - root, jump two, A - 3rd, jump two, C - 5th\n\n* G major: G - root, jump two, B - 3rd, jump two, D 5th\n\n* A minor: A - root, jump two, C - 3rd, jump two, E 5th\n\n* B diminished: B - root, jump two, D - 3rd, jump two, F - 5th\n\nIn any *major key*, the formula for chord value is always: **root - major, 2nd - minor, 3rd - minor, 4th - major, 5th - major, 6th - minor, 7th - diminished.**\n\nNow, how can you look at this in your guitar? First of all, you have to understand the [chromatic scale,](http://imgur.com/5W6V20P) *i.e.* the scale of all the notes. Each circle represents a note, a jump from one note to the next one is knows as a semitone (1 semitone = 1 fret, 2 semitones = 1 tone). It is represented as a circle because the notes go on and on (as a cycle), but every time you complete a lap (the \"goal line\" is the C) you go up one octave. If we imagine some imaginary scissors and cut right before the E note we would have a string of notes. Lay out this in your E string, one circle per fret. \n\nNotice something? . . . Exactly! The chromatic scale matches all the notes on your E string guitar and, when you arrive to the next E you are in the 12th fret, an octave higher. Repeat this for the rest of the strings. The final result would be [this](https://www.lessonface.com/sites/default/files/images/Notes_on_the_Guitar2.png). \n\nHow about you build all the chords by yourself? [Here](http://jguitar.com/scale?root=C&amp;scale=Ionian&amp;fret=0&amp;labels=letter&amp;notes=sharps) you can see all the notes from the C major scale all over the fretboard. Now, which where the notes for the C major chord? C - E - G! (*aka* C major triad, because we have three notes) Find these notes in your fretboard and try to make full six-string chords. You will finish with something [like this](http://jguitar.com/chordsearch?chordsearch=C&amp;labels=letter). You can apply this same concept with the rest of the triads. For example, [the triad for Em is E - G - B](http://jguitar.com/chordsearch?chordsearch=Em&amp;labels=letter).\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428732166", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hmm... I can try.... but I'm really bad at explaining\nI usually support a safelane carry. It's not that easy to harrass the enemy out of the lane because WW's attack range is kinda bad to harass so I just try to protect the carry once he gets aggroed while getting levels. If I have a tri lane going I usually try to stack and pull as much as I can to get fast levels.\nSometimes it is possible to get a kill with the slow and help of the carry if the enemies creepwave pushes and the enemy isn't paying attention.\n\nI usually go Q W W E W R W Q Q Q R E E E skillbuild.... \n\nThe cool thing about WW's Q is imo that you can jump on enemies from behind the trees (if u have vision) since you don't have to walk around them and he doesn't expect such sudden attacks. This also enables you to do some sick jukes and escapes sometimes.\n\nHad a number of situations where I escaped with &lt;50hp because I could Q into the trees and tp out.\n\nSometimes it is possible to get a lucky kill on lvl 2 if the enemy is stupid enough and overextend. Otherwise I just get lvls and protect as stated above.\n\nIf the carry is safe you just proceed to stack&amp;pull. Maybe you can even afford a smoke and gank mid at nighttime. I try to utilise the q here as well: Get on a highground cliff or behind trees where the enemy can't see but you are close to him. When the time is right just press q to fly over the cliff/trees and slow him while your mid just walks up to him and pawns him.\n\nThe E is strong but needs the right timing. You can put your ally in a lot of danger because u basically stun him &amp; the enemy team can just walk to him and Zap him once the Cold Embrace runs out when he maybe could've escaped by running.\nIf you can get a force stuff you can use it on him while cold embrace is active. This helps a bit but you still need the right timing so whenever I have a slight doubt that it actually helps my ally I just don't cast it because I don't want him to rage at me. :-)\n\nItemwise I try to get arcane booots. If game is hard I go for Tranquils + Soul Ring. You'll have enough heal and can Spam your spells. After that it's just the typical support items and ForceStaff, Blink, Mek, Eul's, etc. are all good items imo.\n\nI go gem a lot as well... You can do a pretty safe playstyle with wyvern since u usually won't use your auto attacks. You just use your q to slow enemies in teamfights and spam your splinter shards + use your R ofc. If an ally needs help you cast your E but you stay in the back.\n\nMaybe I should do a video someday...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428752244", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There's a very strong pattern here where you're not actually dealing with any substantial point put to you.  All you're doing is referencing the odd fact, with your own facts which don't even amount to a counter-point.\n\ne.g.\n&gt;Most Asian immigration into the US back in the 1980's or so wasn't skilled. A lot of them were Vietnamese boat refugees.\n\na) Most (89%) of Asian Americans aren't Vietnamese.\n\nb) According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_American): Many Vietnamese Americans are middle class professionals who fled from the increasing power of the Communist Party after the Vietnam War, while others work primarily in blue-collar jobs. \n\nc) They were more skilled that Black slaves, they were still aspirational economic migrants.  The argument was quite clear.\n\nd) According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_American) Vietnamese Americans are less likely to have a degree than the general population and a much lower High School Graduation rate. \n\n&gt;A few things I'd like to clear up. In a earlier reply to you I mentioned that except for communist countries there are no large difference between IQ and countries. Laos is a communist country.\n\nWhich shows that environmental factors affect IQ scores massively!   Then I gave you a whole bunch of examples here that clearly wasn't true.  Thailand isn't Communist. You haven't dealt with the discrepancy in Israeli vs US Jews, or Northern vs Southern Italians or Thailand vs Singapore or S Korea.  You haven't dealt with *any* of this. You're just repeating the same tired facts instead of dealing with the refutation. \n\n&gt;Contrary to what you might have been told, Einstein didn't have a 200 IQ intelligence. You can confidently state he was highly gifted but that only puts the IQ at 130.\n\nI never speculated about his IQ scores.  Why would I or anyone do that?  What are you doing here?!  His intelligence is evidenced by his groundbreaking theories.  He was a uniquely brilliant physicist.\n\n&gt;Intelligence is correlated with brain size at about 0.4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_and_intelligence#Brain_size\n\nAll things being equal yes, but again, that's brain size variation in the general population. As soon as you look at brain size variation amongst groups, the correlation falls apart - men have, on average, larger brains than women, but do not have larger IQ scores.  \n\n&gt;Holy strawman. Twin studies show a 0.8 heritability, even when the twins are raised by different parents. Modern science put the heritibility at 60-80%.\n\nIt's not a straw man.  You presented the difference between black and white outcomes in crime and intelligence *purely* in terms of genetics - you only added environment factors later.\n\n&gt;You are already admitting that there are racial differences in average intelligence, you are just saying half of these are environmental.\n\nWhat?  **WTF?!?**  Don't you dare say that! Have you not been following this at all?  I've been perfectly clear and consistent the whole way through. That absolutely is not what I'm saying and if you think it is then you need to go back and reread the whole thread.  Seriously.  How could you have got this so wrong?!  \n\nThere is a central point here that you have clearly failed to understand, process and it now becomes clear even observe that it has been put to you.\n\nI will state it again.  Now l i s t e n.\n\nIn a randomly sampled group, the variations in intelligence may be accounted for by 50% genetics and 50% environment.  It might be 60% genetics or 70%.  \"It doesn't matter.\"\n\nBUT\n\nAs soon as you pick two samples from two different environments IT IS NOT LOGICAL AT ALL to assume that the variation can be accounted for by the same proportion.\n\nIf you are *still* unable to understand this, *very basic* point, then I strongly suggest you just give up using statistics.  It is way beyond you.  \n\nIt's sometimes presented as a corn analogy.  If there are two gardens of corn, then *within each garden* variability in height is most likely to be down to genetic conditions between each stalk.  But... the height of stalks in one garden is higher than the height in the other garden.  However this is nothing to do with genetics. It's because one garden gets more sunlight than the other.\n\nDo you understand this?  The variability by genetics among the individual stalks *tells you nothing* about variability between the gardens.\n\n&gt;So let's look at socio-economical factors. Extremely poor white children perform at the same level of extremely rich black children on the SAT in the US:\n\nAgain... \"Given the vast differences in socio-economic status, culture, upbringing, parental involvement in education, familial support, nutrition, standards of education etc. \"\n\nIt's not just about money!  It's all these other factors as well.  There can definitely be culture of low aspiration and low expectation within different ethnicities, as well as poor education.  \n\n- In the UK at the moment, that culture exists in the white working class, they consistently underperform regardless of which school they're in, and quickly fall behind even poorer but aspirational Eastern European migrants, and yes, even as poor black inner London schools are showing massive improvements right now while poor white working class children remain stuck.  That's got *nothing* to do with white people being genetically inferior.  \n\n- There have also been studies where black children are adopted by white families and outperform their counterparts by 15 IQ points.  \n\n- Another study took black and white children and put them in a totally self contained learning environment and found that the black children ended up with a higher IQ than the white children.\n\n- Other studies have found that children of black mothers and white fathers score 9 IQ points lower than children of white mothers and black fathers. Hereditarians cannot explain this.  If it were just about genetics, it shouldn't make any difference, but explanations based on culture and environment have no trouble with this. \n\n- If IQ variations amongst races were genetic, then we would expect black people with more white genes to have higher IQs, but in fact there is no such correlation.\n\nIt's almost impossible to completely separate the person from the culture, the stigma etc. But when we start to get close to doing this, the differences do not consistently hold.  \n\nThere is simply no compelling evidence to show that genetic factors account for differences, and a whole heap of evidence to suggest that they don't.\n\n&gt;Even though more black women are overweight than white women.\n\nWTF are you talking about?  You think people get fat in their brains?!\n\n&gt;In the US (and I guess In Londonistan as well considering the insane amount of black crime) the single best predictor of violent crime in an area is the amount of black people who live there.\n\nPlease stop using that word.  Every time you do it makes you sound like a total moron.\n\n&gt;And here we come back to my initial argument, that having low IQ people migrate to your country isn't going to turn it into a superstate. Half of all blacks in the UK live in Londonistan, and you already stated that a lot of them are poor\n\nAnd here we come to my main point.  **There were poor people in London before black people came. There was poverty and crime in London before black people came. If it weren't black people committing those crimes, it would be some other ethnicity, like it is in Glasgow and Liverpool.**\n\n&gt;Oh yeah another thing I'd like to mention, what's with the enormous white flight out of Londonistan? Why are white people racist? Don't they want to live in a multicultural paradise free of hate?\n\nThere's a general movement in London from the inner city, to the suburbs, to the commuter villages.  This happens regardless of ethnicity - it's what families do when they get richer.  The more established they are, the more likely they are to be able to afford to move out. It's not rocket science.\n\n&gt;Another thing I'd like to mention that Arabs and North Africans in continental Europe also do very poor at IQ tests, averaging somewhere around 88. And they also are widely over-represented in crime statistics and form a racial underclass in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, France and other countries. And of course crime is mostly correlated with intelligence and not so much caused by poverty but correlated with poverty because criminals are poor most of the time.\n\nIt's your explanations for those differences which are supposed to be the points you are trying to prove.  Restating the same stuff over and over does not prove your highly questionable explanations.\n\n\nEDIT: You seem to have since edited the top of your post with a whole bunch of stuff, mostly about IQ differences.  I'll look through later, but for now, according to Wikipedia Ashkenazi Jews make up around 50% of the Israeli Jewish population, not 30%!  In case you want me to do the maths, if you're claiming that they have the same 115 IQ as their North American counterparts, then to have got an overall average IQ of 90, the Sephardic Jews would need to have an IQ of 65!  Anything less than 70 would make half of the Israeli population clinically mentally retarded.

{"body": "Somewhere along the line, the white keys on the piano and the \"natural\" notes (i.e., no sharps or flats) ended up playing a [major scale](http://onlinesequencer.net/87904) - Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do (or C D E F G A B C etc.) I don't really know the history behind it, but I'll try to explain it in a manner that's practical for someone learning an instrument in the western world.\n\nThe way the major scale happened to work out is that the musical distance (interval) from B to C and E to F was approximately half (or in modern-day equal temperament, exactly half) the musical distance between all the other consecutive notes. So there are black keys in between all the other pairs for those two, because there is musical space for them. \n\nNow, they could have made pianos so that there was a black key in between every note, but first off, that would be confusing... which note is where? On a normal piano, it's easy to see and feel where each note is because of the pattern of black keys. Secondly, that means you have an odd-sounding scale on all your white keys, the [whole tone scale](http://onlinesequencer.net/87906) instead of the pleasing major scale. Alternatively, you can just forgo black keys and have all the notes in a row to form a [chromatic scale](http://onlinesequencer.net/87908), but the same problems exist (although, this is pretty much how a guitar works).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428771221", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh sure. You set yourself up for a joke and I'm supposed to hand you fresh ammo so you can do the same to me?  Do you think I'm an idiot?\n\nWait. Don't answer that question. I've already told reddit how I managed to burn myself with peanut butter so it's not like I haven't offered sufficient proof.\n\nOkay, how am I a stereotype. Fine. Start by making a list of \"traits\" that we tend to think of with nerds and geeks. I guarantee I will meet the bulk of that list. Now people will try to say \"Semiloki, this is reddit. Liking computers is normal here.\"  \n\nSure. But let's talk about pasty skin. I don't tan. I always look like I've been buried under the snow for the past six months. I'm really incredibly fair skinned. \n\n\"Well,\" someone from the peanut gallery says, \"Not everyone sports a California tan.\"\n\nYes. But I lived in Hawaii for 5 years. Do you have any idea how pathetic it looks when you live in the tropics and are still white as a sheet?\n\nI wear glasses. So do lots of people. Yes, but I am nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other. My glasses don't correct that much but almost anyone who tries on my glasses ends up bumping into walls screaming I must be blind because they screw up their vision so much.\n\nI don't know a thing about sports. I don't just mean I don't follow them. I mean I don't understand them.  I nearly brought someone to tears trying to explain to me what The Final Four was.  I had almost graduated before I found out what my own college's mascot was.\n\nAlmost any geeky topic I, pathetically, have almost encyclopedic knowledge of. Do you want to know what TIE means in TIE Fighter? I got your back. Which actor played Doctor Who the longest? No problem.  Translate the biography of Ada Lovelace into Esperanto? Oh man, I am there!\n\nI sucked at PE in school. Mostly because I am asthmatic but the ridiculous growth spurt I had into my late teenage years didn't help. Imagine trying to do shuttle runs and you realize, too late, your body is larger and more massive than you thought? I was wheezing for breath and I'd overshoot my mark and almost collide with people.\n\nI laugh every time I hear the Wilhelm scream in a movie.\n\nI rage whenever I see an IP address that includes an octet with a number greater than 255.\n\nI never dated when I was in high school. Didn't go to the prom either. My entire life of partying is condensed into one night (a friend of mine got bored and talked me into crashing two different frat parties on the same night).  \n\nI don't drink. I don't do drugs. I'm so incredibly square that I'm used to calibrate carpentry tools. \n\nLet me put it to you this way. This is how much of a nerd I am. One day I was sitting in the lobby of a dorm just minding my own business. I was practicing shuffling cards, of all things. Two women walk up to me out of the blue and ask, \"Excuse me, what does OPEC mean?\"\n\nSo I start going into the history of the Middle East and its relationship with oil consuming nations, the US in particular. I explained the nature of the cooperative venture and the idea of restricting outflow for price fixing purposes. They stared at me like deer caught in the headlights. \n\n\"Uh. How is OPEC spelled?\" I asked.\n\n\"O P A Q U E,\" one of them said while whimpering.\n\n\"That's pronounced oh-pay-keh and it just means you can't see through it. The opposite of transparent.\"\n\n\"Oh, thanks,\" they murmured and then ran as if they were afraid I might pull a Donald Sutherland and point at them while screaming open mouthed. One of the few times in my life that a woman has approached me like that and I manage to run them off in terror. How was I suppose to know someone could get into college without a sixth grade vocabulary?\n\nSo, that's it in a nutshell. Pasty skinned, unathletic, uncoordinated, and able to repel anything with a double X chromosome just by opening my mouth and inserting my foot.

Chords often are played with a note other than the root in the lowest position (this is called inversion).  So, for example, the notes in a C major chord are C E and G, and that fact that one might play G E C or E C G, etc., does not change things.  You can even play G E C E G C E and still be playing a C major chord.\n\nTo be clear, I am saying same thing that /u/imeddy.

{"body": "This is my fave dessert to make, FLAN!! I love love love it, its simple and its a big hit with pretty much everyone! \r\nFor the Caramel:\r\n-1/2 cup sugar\r\n\r\nFor the Flan:\r\n-6 Eggs\r\n-3 cups of Milk\r\n-1/2 cup of Sugar\r\n-1 1/2 teaspoons Vanilla\r\n-1 teaspoon Orange Zest \r\n\r\nSet your oven to 350° F before you get started so its heated by the time you've finished prepping.\r\n\r\nOKAY, let's start with the caramel! Get your sugar in a pan and cook that stuff until its a B E A U T I F U L golden brown. I like mine a little darker, mostly because it tastes a bit like coffee. When your sugar's caramelized, pour it into your round pan and swirl it around so the entire bottom is covered and there's a little on the sides. You'll pour your flan mixture into this! \r\n\r\nNext onto the flan. Take your eggs and crack those babies into your bowl, then beat them gently but thoroughly. Add the sugar, vanilla, milk, and orange zest. Mix that all up and pour it into your round pan with the caramel in it! (Idk if its NECESSARY, but I always spray the pan because I'm super paranoid.) \r\n\r\nPrepare a pan that's a bit deeper than the one that your flan is sitting in and fill it with 1-2 inches of water as hot as you can get. Then, place your round  pan of flan into the water, and put it in the oven (which you've already heated up to 350 if you're good at following instructions!). Leave it for a little over an hour, or if you're nervous like me 50 minutes and then check it every five. You want it to cook until you can stick a knife into it and it can come out clean.\r\nOnce you pull that baby out of the oven put the round pan on a cooling rack and put it in the fridge to cool for about 3 hours! Its much tastier chilled in my opinion, so no matter how impatient you may be feeling let it sit for the entire 3 hours. Getting it out of the pan can be tricky, so make sure you're gentle. First, run a knife or thin spatula around the edge and let a little air underneath it. Put your presentation dish over the round pan and then flip the entire thing over so your flan is sitting caramel-side-up. And there you have it! Beautiful Flan! Serve that with some fresh fruit and you've got yourself a little slice of heaven &lt;3!

Way simpler than it seems.\n\nFor the Caramel:\r\n-1/2 cup sugar\r\n\r\nFor the Flan:\r\n-6 Eggs\r\n-3 cups of Milk\r\n-1/2 cup of Sugar\r\n-1 1/2 teaspoons Vanilla\r\n-1 teaspoon Orange Zest \r\n\r\nSet your oven to 350° F before you get started so its heated by the time you've finished prepping.\r\n\r\nOKAY, let's start with the caramel! Get your sugar in a pan and cook that stuff until its a B E A U T I F U L golden brown. I like mine a little darker, mostly because it tastes a bit like coffee. When your sugar's caramelized, pour it into your round pan and swirl it around so the entire bottom is covered and there's a little on the sides. You'll pour your flan mixture into this! \r\n\r\nNext onto the flan. Take your eggs and crack those babies into your bowl, then beat them gently but thoroughly. Add the sugar, vanilla, milk, and orange zest. Mix that all up and pour it into your round pan with the caramel in it! (Idk if its NECESSARY, but I always spray the pan because I'm super paranoid.) \r\n\r\nPrepare a pan that's a bit deeper than the one that your flan is sitting in and fill it with 1-2 inches of water as hot as you can get. Then, place your round  pan of flan into the water, and put it in the oven (which you've already heated up to 350 if you're good at following instructions!). Leave it for a little over an hour, or if you're nervous like me 50 minutes and then check it every five. You want it to cook until you can stick a knife into it and it can come out clean.\r\nOnce you pull that baby out of the oven put the round pan on a cooling rack and put it in the fridge to cool for about 3 hours! Its much tastier chilled in my opinion, so no matter how impatient you may be feeling let it sit for the entire 3 hours. Getting it out of the pan can be tricky, so make sure you're gentle. First, run a knife or thin spatula around the edge and let a little air underneath it. Put your presentation dish over the round pan and then flip the entire thing over so your flan is sitting caramel-side-up. And there you have it! Beautiful Flan! Serve that with some fresh fruit and you've got yourself a little slice of heaven &lt;3! Enjoy!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428894837", "subreddit": "food", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Holy shit dude. While I wish I was one of those people that knew everything and could do a huge write-up of things you need to know, I am not. I can help a little though. Anyone feel free to correct me.\n\nMost songs just use one key. Some will switch keys for the chorus or bridge to make it sound interesting. Making up riffs can be just trying to make cool noises to actually figuring out something from your head you made up.\n\nA key is made of the notes in the major scale. Everyone starts with the key of C because it's the easiest. It's the easiest because it has no sharps or flats. C D E F G A B C. One thing I want to make sure you start to understand immediately is INTERVALS. That's what really makes the scale, not the notes. Intervals are just whole steps and half steps. Two frets, one fret. The major scale goes whole whole half whole whole whole half. WWHWWWH. This is usually called the formula. You can apply this formula to any note and get it's major scale.\n\nNext is the minor scale. It's not any different than the major scale except the starting note. For the natural minor, you start on the 6th note of any major scale, and you then have that major scales relative minor. The formula is WHWWHWW. You can see C Major's relative minor is A. The A natural minor scale is A B C D E F G A.\n\nModes are a whole 'nother beast. They can be used to give songs different moods. The Ionian mode is the most common because, well, its just the major scale untampered. The other modes are Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian. The Aeolian mode is just the natural minor scale which you also know.\n\nI recommend you go to youtube and look up Ben Levin and his music theory course.

The most common exceptions are the J and Q.\n\n&gt;* Lining figures (see [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals)) sit on the baseline.\n\n&gt;* The following [text figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_figures) have descenders: 3 4 5 7 9.\n\n&gt;* The following [lowercase letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case) have descenders: g j p q y.\n\n&gt;* [Glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphs) with rounded lower and upper extents (0 3 6 8 c C G J o O Q) dip very slightly below the baseline (\"overshoot\") to create the optical illusion that they sit on the baseline, and rise above the x-height or capital height to create the illusion that they have the same height as flat glyphs (such as those for H x X 1 5 7). Peter Karow's *Digital Typefaces* suggests that typical overshoot is about 1.5%.\n\n&gt;The vertical distance of the base lines of consecutive lines in a paragraph is also known as line height or [leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading), although the latter can also refer to the baseline distance minus the font size.\n\n&gt;North Indian scripts have a characteristic *hanging* baseline; the letters are aligned to the top of the writing line, marked by an overbar, with diacritics extending above the baseline.\n\n&gt;East Asian scripts have no baseline; each glyph sits in a square box, with neither ascenders nor descenders. When mixed with scripts with a low baseline, East Asian characters should be set so that the bottom of the character is between the baseline and the descender height.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Cap ^height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_height) ^| [^Overshoot ^\\(typography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_\\(typography\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqb3znq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqb3znq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428951988", "subreddit": "gnome", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Interesting question.. I can't think of any books! But one of the many ways I make a living is by writing arrangements of music for orchestral contexts, so I'll be able to write a few thoughts on how I approach things!\n\nWarning, I will dip in and out of music theory to help emphasise some points.. google is your friend if you're un-sure :)\n\nFirst thing is you need to understand the restraints of the instruments you have available to you in your arrangement. To really enforce this point, lets say you have a guitar than can ONLY be tuned to standard tuning. This means the lowest note you can play is E2 ('e in the 2nd octave') and assuming you never go higher than the 12th fret of the high e string, your highest note is E5 ('e in the 5th octave').\n\nOK - so now you know what you have available to you. Now, consider that an arrangement means you can loosely interpret the song as you please. Your arrangement can be louder, software, faster, slower.. In my opinion, it's only important you at least represent the chords and even more importantly the melody.\n\nIf I were to arrange a song on the guitar, I would start by voicing the chords and trying to identify which notes (if any) in the chord represent the melody. This is an interesting exercise in itself. For example, lets say the chord is C Major (so.. the notes of of C Major at C E and G). And the melody note is B.. then if you play the chord and melody together you are harmonising into a C Major 7 chord..! (notes are C E G B). Either way, analysing the chords and how the melody above it interacts will give you a really solid familiarity with the piece.\n\nAgain.. keeping to the guitar for a second. Im going to arrange The Scientist by Coldplay for us..\n\nSo lets look at the first 3 chords.. \nD Minor (D, F, A)\nBb (Bb, D, F) \nF Major (F, A C)\n\nAnd now add the melody (just focusing on the 'leading notes')\n\nD Minor stays the same.. Leading note is F.. Bb Major changes! Melody note is the note a.. THIS MAKES Bb Major a Bb Major 7 chord! F major sounds the same, as A is the main note. But it has an interesting passing note (Eb) which makes F Major a F Major sus 2 chord for a second.\n\nSo this tells me that in my arrangement my chords have been changed as below... D Minor is still D Minor.. Bb Major is now Bb Major 7 and I'm going to change F Major into an F Major sus 2.\n\nThe problem is now, I know how to play Bb Major 7 on the guitar.. but I don't like the voicing of it. For example, you can play it like.. 6 8 7 7 x x.. or x 1 3 2 3 x.. But they all sound a little tight on my guitar. I like open strings. And I know a good Major 7 Chord voicing.. x 3 2 0 0 0.\n\nSo I need to change the key, or transpose it. The lazy way on a guitar is to whack on a capo. That won't work here. We need to understand the 'tonic' of each chord, in relation to the key. This is a fancy way of saying, which step in the key of x does the chord take place. I'll skip ahead here and tell you the key of The Scientist is Bb. The notes of Bb are Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G and A. Again I'm skipping along here and totally oversimplifying, but D minors 'root note' is D. D is the 3rd note in Bb. Thus the tonic of D Minor in Bb is iii. Likewise, Bb is the 'root note' of Bb Major 7, so the tonic of Bb Major 7 in Bb is I. And finally, F Major is V.\n\nSo I need to find a key in which my favourite voicing of a Major 7, x 3 2 0 0 0 (this is C Major 7 by the way, so the 'root note is C') is the I tonic. The key C major (notes are C D E F G A B) fits the bill.\n\nSo we need the iii of C major (E) the V (G) and the I (C). Thus my newly transposed chords are a big fat sounding E Minor (0 2 2 0 0 0), an awesome C Major 7 (x 3 2 0 0 0) and a wide G Major Sus 2 (3 2 0 2 0 0)\n\nThe other cool thing achieved by voicing chords with lots of open strings is it makes it easier to slip the melody in.. so for example the melody of the scientist can be played on the G and b strings..\n\nWhich when you play the chords underneath aint so tricky.. like..\n\n      E Minor         C Major 7        G Major sus 2\n\n    e|\n    b|              3   0             3   0           0   0   0 0 \n    G|        0 2 0       0    0 2 0        2   0 2 0               2 0\n    D|    2                 2                 0         0   0     0 \n    A|  2   2         3        3                         \n    E|0       0                         3       3\n\nHopefully this gives some insight into the steps involved in arrangement :)\n\n    ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428957464", "subreddit": "Songwriters", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Welp. I compiled a bunch of the replies and now I'm sad.\n\n**Men ARE inherently misogynistic:**\n\n&gt; * I’ve also never met a man who didn’t have to very seriously work against the misogyny he inherited from society.\n\n\n&gt; * most women have some degree of internalised misogyny so it’s pretty likely most men are misogynist to some extent.\n\n&gt; * Saying that a man who is told he is being “inherently misogynist” is experiencing misandry is fucking laughable because male privilege is inherently misogynist, as is the hetero-patriarchal society in which we live. We (men) benefit from misogyny every day. If your girlfriend tells you that something is misogynist, you should fucking listen because she’s probably right. If your abusive partner who happens to be a woman tries to guilt you for being male, that is clearly emotional manipulation and abuse… but still not misandry.\n\n\n&gt; * All men grow up with male privilege and no matter how much they embrace feminism will still have male privilege and use it to their advantage.\n\n\n&gt; * There is NOTHING wrong with your girlfriend calling you out for being misogynistic. I do it to my bf all the time. He’s a dude, I’m a chick, I know when he’s being sexist and misogynistic, we talk about it, he learns, we’re good. Stop trying to silence women kthxbye.\n\n\n&gt; * Wait, explain to me how telling a man he’s misogynist means a girl isn’t good for someone? People can be inherently misogynist. People often ARE inherently misogynist. It’s OK to tell your significant other their behaviors/beliefs/thoughts are problematic.\n\n\n&gt; * maleness is fundamentally rooted in the domination and degradation of women; not every guy is a violent misogynist but all men personally benefit from systematic misogyny\n\n\n&gt; * Saying that a man who is told he is being “inherently misogynist” is experiencing misandry is fucking laughable because male privilege is inherently misogynist, as is the hetero-patriarchal society in which we live\n\n\n&gt; * If your girlfriend tells you that you are inherently misogynist, know that all men are inherently misogynist because that’s how men are taught to be. Examine your actions if they’re misogynist, leanr why they’re misogynist, admit they were misogynist, work to CHANGE them. Apologize and promise yourself and her you would do better.\n\n\n&gt; * men are inherently misogynistic so this post sucks bye\n\n\n&gt; * why would telling your boyfriend about inherent misogyny be considered something to break up over????\n\n\n&gt; * If your girlfriend tells you that you are inherently misogynist, she is most likely correct.\n\n\n&gt; * But yeah, you ARE inherently misogynistic. Do NOT forget that.\n\n\n&gt; * I cannot believe telling a man he’s misogynistic is considered abuse now lmao\n\n\n**You CANNOT be sexist against men:**\n\n&gt; * IN THIS PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY, SEXISM AGAINST MEN DOESNT EXIST GET OUT OF HERE LOG OFF IM TIRED\n\n\n&gt; * But you can’t be sexist against men soooooo.\n\n\n&gt; * Misogyny is taught to us from an early age, everyone has internalized misogyny. You can’t be sexist towards men.\n\n\n&gt; * SEXISM AGAINST MEN IS NOT REAL! IT CANNOT BE A THING! when are people going to realize this oh my god this post is trash\n\n\n&gt; * SEXISM AGAINST MEN DOESNT EXIST. OMG. Women can say things that are rude, mean, or uphold patriarchal standards IRT men and masculinity, but it’s not SEXIST.\n\n\n&gt; * there’s no such thing as reverse sexism and even if there were it is nowhere NEAR on the level of trauma and distress that literal abuse and rape are and its disrespectful as hell to pretend that’s the case\n\n\n**Misandry is NOT real**\n\n&gt; * Misandry isn’t a thing. Girls can joke abt guys as much as they want tbh because those jokes do not come out of a tradition of devaluing men’s lives and work… so yeah.\n\n\n&gt; * If your abusive partner who happens to be a woman tries to guilt you for being male, that is clearly emotional manipulation and abuse… but still not misandry.\n\n\n&gt; * WOW THIS IS A SHIT POST!!!! MISANDRY IS REAL!!!!! #sarcasm for the last part\n\n\n**Sexist jokes against men are OKAY:**\n\n&gt; * If your girlfriend makes common sexist jokes against men but takes offense at jokes against women, she understands the hilarity that is misandry and you’re probably a piss baby.\n\n\n&gt; * women making ‘sexist’ jokes about men doesn’t reinforce a system of oppression, misogynist jokes however do.\n\n\n&gt; * Im dying at this post that equates making corny feminist jokes with physically and sexually abusing a person\n\n\n&gt; * yes because saying someone has a small penis is so sexist and oppressive and totally contributes to the continued internalized oppression of men in society\n\n\n&gt; * Men don’t have to like it if women make “haha men” jokes, but it doesn’t play into an oppression framework. Men in general are not harmed, nor is the harm of men normalized, by women making stereotyping jokes. Whereas men making sexist jokes against women reaffirms our oppression and confirms to any other men listening that it is okay to treat women as second class citizens\n\n\n&gt; * Whereas men making sexist jokes against women reaffirms our oppression and confirms to any other men listening that it is okay to treat women as second class citizens\n\n\n&gt; * Making sexist jokes about women hurt women as a whole. Jokes about men don’t hurt men as a group.\n\n\n&gt; * If your girlfriend makes jokes at men’s expense as a way of dealing with the rampant sexism of society it does not give you a free pass to make sexist jokes that fall in line with the thinking that oppresses her.\n\n\n**OP's post is lame/trash/a hot mess lmaoooo etc:**\n\n&gt; * sexual harassment =/= criticizing men for having inherent institutional power over women and this post is equating abusive behaviour to misandry this is a hot mess\n\n\n&gt; * l m f a o this post is hilarious\n\n\n&gt; * what the fuck is this garbage \n\n\n&gt; * Worst post ov all tyme\n\n\n&gt; * this post lame as hell 1. most men are misogynistic whether they do it intentionally or not 2. you can’t be sexist towards men what the hell is this lmaooooo\n\n\n**Misandry is ACTUALLY misogyny:**\n\n&gt; * Discussing the pervasiveness of misogyny in our culture and our behaviors is not an act of abuse and, to be quite honest, silencing a woman’s concerns about misogyny is\n\n\n&gt; * Ugh god the whole original post just reeks of “lol I LOVE MEN!

{"body": "This has to do with the behavior of melody and harmony. In a major scale, you will notice that there is a minor second (half-step, the distance of one fret) between the scale degree 7 and 1. 7 is called the \"leading tone\" because it has a perceived tendency to progress toward 1 (which we call the tonic). If you play a major scale, going C D E F G A B, and you stop on the B, you might hear that the next logical note is the C a half-step above B. This is an important tendency to be aware of in the construction of melody and chord progression. We apply the melodic tendency of the leading tone going to the tonic to harmony with the chord progress V7 I, which, in the key of C, is G7 C. G7 contains the pitches G B D F, and the B in that chord \"wants\" to go to C.\n\n\n\nWhen we go to minor, things change. Here is a C minor scale: C D E♭F G A♭ B♭ C. There is a major second (whole-step, the distance of two frets) between B♭ and C. That little extra distance weakens the tendency of the seventh tone to progress to the first. In fact, ♭7 (we preface it with \"♭\" because it is a half-step lower when compared to its counterpart in the major scale) is not even called the *leading tone* anymore. We call it a plain old \"subtonic,\" which is an inventive word meaning \"the note below the tonic.\" If you harmonize those scale degrees in the same way that we did with the major scale, you get this chord progression: v7 i, or Gm7 Cm (G B♭ D F and C E♭ G, respectively). This probably sounds fine to your modern ear, but some old dead dudes decided that this wasn't good enough. Besides, unless there is something unique about the harmony in the minor mode, what's to keep it from gravitating toward the tonic of the relative major mode (E♭ major, in the case of C minor), since the leading tone still exists there? The answer comes in the form of an artificial leading tone, produced solely to make a more satisfying progression toward the 1 scale degree and, by extension, the tonic chord. Try this progression on for size: G7 Cm (V7 i; G B D F &amp; C E♭ G).\n\n\n\nPerhaps you hear that G7 is stronger than Gm7. If not, just bear with me. We can then take what we learned from that chord progression and feed it back into the scale to produce this set of notes: C D E♭ F G A♭ B C. This is what we call the \"harmonic minor scale,\" so named because it is the scale that is used to produce harmony in minor keys. If you play it, you might hear that there is a tasty interval between A♭ and B. This interval is called an \"augmented second,\" which is the distance of three frets. In our modern music, this sort of thing is common and quite cool. However, this interval did not play well with others in the polyphonic music of old Europe, and the composers of that area at that time avoided the melodic use of the augmented second. There are some cultural reasons for this: Catholic Europe was entangled in religious conflict with the Middle East during the Middle Ages, and consequently there is a conscious divide between the two regions. The augmented second is a characteristic interval of the musics of many Middle Eastern cultures, including Turkey, whose Ottoman Empire conquered many states in Eastern Europe, including Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire (sort of a big deal). Needless to say, there was enmity between the Christian nations of Europe and the Muslim nations to its South and East. The exclusion of the augmented second in Western music is one of the ways that Europe distanced itself from the Islamic world. (I don't know whether it was considered a good interval in Europe before Catholicism, but the Church controlled nearly every aspect of culture, so...)\n\n\n\nAnyway, the old dead dudes had to get around the augmented second between ♭6 and 7 that existed in the minor mode. The way that they did this was to raise ♭6 to 6 (A♭ to A, if we're talking the key of C). This was nice, because it allowed them to have the leading tone (B) and also write melodies that included the sixth degree of the scale. Thus, you could have a nice little scalar walk-up to the tonic: C D E♭ F G A B C. This one is named the \"melodic minor scale,\" so-called because it facilitates melodies that contain the leading tone. We retain the \"natural\" form of the scale (with ♭6 and ♭7) simply so that we can have access to those colors that are unique to the minor mode.\n\n\n\nThe confusion, as you pointed out, comes from the \"ascending\" and \"descending\" terminology. In my opinion this is not a good way to describe it, because I can look at any Bach piece in a minor key and find the \"ascending\" form [used as a descending scale](http://i.imgur.com/7abpp1h.jpg) in about 3 seconds. So ascent/descent is not the determining factor. Why use one or the other, then? The answer is that the \"ascending\" form is associated with leading tone harmony. If the chord contains the leading tone (such as V7) and the sixth and seventh scale degrees are being used together in the melody, then it has to be 6 &amp; 7 rather than ♭6 &amp; 7 (augmented second!) or ♭6 &amp; ♭7 (no leading tone!). On the other chords, you're more likely to hear the natural (\"descending\") form of the scale, because it plays along with the harmony. For instance, Fm, D°, and A♭ (iv, ii°, and VI respectively) are all going to get the natural minor, because those chords contain A♭ and we don't want a clash between A♭ and A. On Cm7, E♭, and B♭, (i7, III, ♭VII), you'll want natural minor as well because all of those chords contain B♭ (rather than B). Really, the only place you can use melodic minor is on G, B°, and Cm (V, vii°, and i), because those either contain the leading tone, or in the case of i, neither ♭6, 6, ♭7, or 7 are present to create a conflict.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1428997211", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

Yeah know where LB will jump and she can't stop her animation so you can knock her up quite easily just like charming her with Ahri. Zed is a different story with his W R W R he is too mobile. And next to that he does have quite a lot of counters =/.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429023398", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I just sit down and play chords and hum a melody over it until something comes together. Then I'll make a lead sheet, do a couple pages of freewriting on the associations I have with the song, and make a sketch of the lyrics structure (accented syllables per line and rhyme scheme) and the first few verses are pretty bad and hard to think of but after that it will stay in the back of my mind and verses will just pop into my head over the course of the next few days. As far as background that's helpful for this, I have a solid theory background, have read up on lyric structure a bit, I can sight sing, and I can transcribe melodies I hear, and I have a background in jazz and blues on guitar and piano. The main thing is that songwriting really benefits from regular practice, just like on an instrument or with your voice. If you sit down and work on songwriting for 30 minutes per day at first you will feel like you can't think of anything but eventually you will start to accumulate musical and lyrical ideas and you'll have something nice in about two weeks. \n\nThe shorter version:\nJust figure out the concept of a key. You take the notes that are in a key and use them to build chords, and then your melody draws from the notes in that key to harmonize with your chords. Lets think of G major for a second, because that's what your chord progression is in. This contains the notes G A B C D E F# (G). The most popular chords are built on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th notes in that scale by stacking thirds, which means going through that G major scale in skips. So lets pick the super popular progression I vi IV V. Your I chord contains G (skip A) B (skip C) and D. Your vi chord contains E, G and B. Your IV chord contains C, E, and G. Your V chord contains D, F#, A. So play your chord progression for four beats each. And start singing through the G major scale so that you sing one of the notes that is in the current chord whenever you are on the first beat or third beat of the measure. Start with just singing quarter notes, so one note per strum. Your second and fourth beats don't need to harmonize and are used to smooth the connection between the notes on the first and third beats. \n\nThis is a massive oversimplification but hopefully it helps. Just find some easy 200 page theory book you can crank through in a day or two, it's not even nearly going to tell you the whole picture but it's totally adequate for pop purposes. Then check out \"writing better lyrics\" by Pat Pattison, and whatever else looks good. \"Songwriting\" by Stephen Citron is a decent quick overview. Also building your comfort on an instrument and doing tons of improvisation will help.

{"body": "&gt; Is there a name for this scale/mode?\n\nPhrygian dominant (though not with the #7).  In Jewish music, it's called Ahavah Rabbah.  In Arabic music, it's called maqam Hijaz.  It's an incredibly common scale, just not so much in Western music because Westerners don't like that augmented second between the b2 and the 3, in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East it's *all over*.\n\nMy advice would be to not use a raised 7.  You already have a b2; why do you need a 7 as well?  As for harmony, you can use a vø7 if you want, but you should just stick with the bvii as your dominant.  The main chords you'll probably use in this mode are I, iv, and bvii.  If you want to go a Spanish route, you can use a bII and even a bIII as well; the famous Andalusian cadence is iv - bIII - bII - I.\n\nThe Spanish scale is a variation on phrygian dominant.  If phrygian dominant is the fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale, the Spanish scale is the fifth mode of the *melodic* minor scale.  You're doing this in E, so I'll keep that: it would be E F# G# A B C D E - E D C B A G F E.  The \"base\" scale here is the phrygian dominant, E F G# A B C D E, so you'd raise the b2 going up and lower the 3 coming down, but your tonic is still I, never i.\n\nThe way to approach this mode using harmony is to not have your chords slavishly stuck to the mode.

{"body": "\"A\" was the label that Boethius gave to the lowest note in the Greek system of octave species in his work, *De Institutione Musica* (c. 505AD). A quick background on Boethius: he was a Roman scholar who was active during the decline of the Western Roman Empire. He was fluent in Greek and worked on translating and appropriating ancient Greek texts into Latin, which was nice because the aforementioned Western Roman Empire was going to shit and the infrastructure just didn't exist to enable Greek scholarship. In ancient Greek music theory, pitches are organized by tetrachords. There are four modes that are composed of two tetrachords each to make a single octave species:\n\n\nDorian - [**D** E F G] [A B C **D**]\n\nPhrygian - [**E** F G A] [B C D **E**]\n\nLydian - [**F** G A B] [C D E **F**]\n\nMixolydian - [**G** A B C] [D E F **G**]\n\n\nThis is how we would think of it in terms of modern pitch notation. I'll get back to that in a bit. Also, I bolded the \"final\" of each mode. Anyway, you'll notice that the only one of those tetrachords that starts on A is the upper tetrachord of the Dorian mode. Here's how that fits in: each of the four modes has a corresponding \"plagal\" mode, prefixed with \"hypo,\" which maintains the same final but starts a perfect fourth lower. In effect, you swap the tetrachords around so that the \"upper\" tetrachord now becomes the lower.\n\nHypodorian - [A B C **D**] [E F G A]\n\nHypophrygian - [B C D **E**] [F G A B]\n\nHypolydian - [C D E **F**] [G A B C]\n\nHypomixolydian - [D E F **G**] [A B C D]\n\n\nNow we're getting somewhere. You can see that A indicates the lowest note in the system, which happens to be the lower limit of the hypodorian mode. I mentioned before that I am using the modern pitch notation. Boethius actually doesn't do that. The concept of octave equivalency and the scale as a repeating, cyclical object came later. The ancient Greek \"greater perfect system\" was based on lyre tunings and fingerings (which gets really messed up and difficult to understand), and only extends to two of our modern octaves. If I can make an analogy, it's sort of like a musical system based off of guitar tablature: it's about the mechanics of the instrument, and it's only going to make sense to guitarists. Here is how Boethius notated this stuff:\n\n\nModern pitches: A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A\n\nBoethius: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O\n\n\nOr, if you want to think of it numerically, our modern system goes **1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 **1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 **1**, on and on forever, and Boethius' system would assign 15 different numerals to those pitches. Fun fact: ancient Greek doesn't have numerals. Instead, they practiced \"isopsephy,\" which is the assignment of numerical values to letters. There is a similar practice in Hebrew called \"Gematria.\" I don't know whether this influenced Boethius to use letters rather than numerals.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429059713", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "A bit late but I've done it... I did my solution in F#\n\nIt's been a great learning experience. I've used it as an opportunity to learn about different tree-like data structures, implementing recursive functions and a many new things in F#. Previously i've mostly programmed in C#.\n\nDuring this experimentation i implemented:\n\n* Trie structure based on F#'s Map data type and unions,\n  * Performance doesn't event look so bad.. searching random 1mln elements in trie takes about 1.2 seconds (~ 800k results/sec).\n  * Memory efficiency is bad: GC.GetTotalMemory shows about 70mb allocated per 3mb dictionary file (350k words)\n* Only immutable types and recursive calls are used,\n* Recursive grid scanner.\n  \nScanner works without using any kind of smart heuristics so it's going as far as possible on grid while checking trie for matches branch until it can't find no more. Then it switches to search from root of the trie (\"\") and adds matched word to a sentence.\n\nIts accurancy is very dependent on used dictionary. For large dictionary searches can be slow. enable1.txt is\nfast (~5 sec) but not very accurate. Large dictionary (350k words) runs search for about 1 minute on 6x6, produce\nbig list of solutions but one of this solutions is a correct sentence.\n\nMost interesting results are generated when english morphemes are used instead of normal words dictionary.\n\nFor example these are results for 5x5 box search using dictionary of 2600 english morphemes:\n\n    ITKEEPSYOURNECKOENFFILTHE\n    ITKEEPSYOURNECKOENILEHTFF\n    ITKEEPTHELIFSYOURNECKOENF\n    ITKEEPTHELIFSYOURNECKOFNE\n    ITKEEPTHELINEOFFSYECKNRUO\n    ITKEEPTHELINEOFFSYOUECKNR\n    ITKEEPTHELINEOFFSYOURNECK (lol. close but different word order)\n    ITKEEPTHELINEOKCENRUOYSFF\n    ITKEEPTHELINEOKNECFFSYOUR\n    ITOURNECKOENFFILTPSYKEEHE\n\nNot perfect but accurate enough to understand a sentence. And it runs very fast on 5x5 box (~ 100 ms)\n\nFor 6x6 box and english morphemes dictionary it runs about 5 sec and gives a following solutions:\n\n    THEPIGGYWITHLARGITISGRUDISNYWASNTLED\n    THEPIGGYWITHLARGITISIDURGDELTNSAWSNY\n    THEPIGGYWITHLARGITISIDURGDELTNSAWYNS\n    THEPIGGYWITHLARGITISISNYWASDURGDELTN\n    THEPIGGYWITHLARGITISNYWASDISGRUNTLED (best?)\n    THEPIGGYWITHLARGITISNYWASDURISGDELTN\n    THEPIGSAGYWITARGITISIRGDELTNUDWSNYLH\n    THEPIGSAGYWITHLARGITISISNYWDURGDELTN\n    THEPIGSAGYWITHLARGITISNYWDISGRUNTLED\n    THEPIGSAGYWITHLARGITISNYWDURISGDELTN\n    THEPIGSALHGYWITARGITISIRGDELTNUDWSNY\n    THEPIGSALHGYWITARGITISIRGDELTNUDWYNS\n    THEPIGSALHGYWITARGITISISNYWDURGDELTN\n    THEPIYGHWITARGITISISNYLAWDURGDELTNSG\n    THEPIYWITARGITISISNYWALHGGSDURGDELTN\n    THEPIYWITHGALARGITISISNYWDURGDELTNSG\n    THEPIYWITHGALARYNGITISISWDURGDELTNSG\n    THEPIYWITHGALARYNGITISWDURISGDELTNSG\n    THEPIYWITHGALARYWDURISNGITISGDELTNSG\n    THEPIYWITHLARGITISGRUDISNYWAGGSNTLED\n    THEPIYWITHLARGITISISNYWAGGSDURGDELTN\n    THEPIYWITHLARGITISNYWAGGSDISGRUNTLED (good)\n    THEPIYWITHLARGITISNYWAGGSDURISGDELTN\n\nAll possible solutions manage to at least describe a sentence.\n\nFor 6x6 box on enable1.txt dictionary it runs ~3 sec and all solutions look similar to these:\n\n    ...\n    THEGGHLASNTLUREDGSISIDWYNTIGRATIWYIP\n    THEGGHLYNSIRUDWASNTLEDGSITIGRATIWYIP\n    THEGGHLYNSWASNTLUDIREDGSITIGRATIWYIP\n    ...\n  \nI think key point from this experiment is that is possible to find solution without using a giant word dictionary.\nLanguage morphemes can be used to produce accurate enough solutions in this kind of an algorithm.

{"body": "A chord is 3 or more notes sounded at the same time. Two notes is an interval. Chords are made up of these intervals. Usually the Root, a 3rd of some kind (major or minor) and the 5th. This is a very common chord construction on say, guitar. If you hear the term 'Power Chord', also very common with guitar, that means just the Root and 5th (with often the root note doubled as an octave, same note 1 full sounding higher in pitch).\nChords are constructed from the notes of Key, generally 7 notes in diatonic order plus the octave gives you an 8 note repeating pattern.\nThe key of C major as example is all of the white keys on a piano. C D E F G A B (C)\nAll of the chords in the key of C major will be constructed from those notes.\nThe 1 chord in C major would be C major, C E and G. Notice these are the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of the C major scale.\nNow if you do the same thing starting on each note of C major scale, you'll get a bunch of different chords all in the key of C. Some will be Major chords, some will be Minor and 1 will be Diminished.\nThe chart you're looking at here is showing the Chord Progression given the in reference to the key.\nSo if a song is in the key of C major, and the progression is 1 4 5, the chords would be C, F then G, repeated however many times.\n\nThis is a very simplified view of music theory and I'm leaving out a lot o things for simplicities sake. Check out musictheory.net for lots of great info on music theory.\n\nIn western music we tend to love 1 4 5 progressions, or as you can see from the chart variations on the theme. For instance 12 bar blues has some very strict formats that revolve around 1 4 5. \n\nWhile it may seem complex music (western music theory) is interesting as we only use 12 notes, everything is derived from those notes, so you get a ton of overlap and context based situations. The chord A minor is made of the same notes as C major yet has a very different sound and function.\n\nAs far as the interest into why western basee music has an obsession with 1 4 5, lots of reasons. It's simple, it works, it sounds good to the ear.\nYou can mostly thank Bach for our love of 1 4 5 and various resolutions from the surrounding choral compositions.\n\nAll the best!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429112744", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Since some of the answers people have given you are either overly confusing or plain wrong, I thought I would reply.\n\nPretty much everything in western music is based on the major scale. The C major scale is:\n\n* C D E F G A B\n\nFor reasons that are too complicated and you shouldn't worry about right now, there are **seven chords that \"belong\" in any given key.** We get those chords from the major scale.  For the purpose of analyzing the progression, we refer to each chord by a number. In the key of C, those seven chords are:\n\n* Cmaj (I) Dmin (II) Emin (III) Fmaj (IV) Gmaj (V) Amin (VI) Bmb5 (VII)\n\nThe numer represents the chord. Notably, the I, IV, and V chords are always major chords, and the II, III, and VI chords are always minor chords. So, if we look at a progression of chords, for example: **Cmaj - Gmaj - Amin - Fmaj**, we can analyze that progression as a **I - V - VI - IV** progression in the key of C. In the Key of Bb, that same progression would be: **Bbmaj - Fmaj - Gmin - Ebmaj**.  But it is *still* a I - V - VI - IV progression. **The relationship of the chords within the key are the same.** Really, choosing a key just comes down to where the singer is comfortable singing, and whether the musicians are actually capable of playing in all keys (which we all should, but many are not).\n\nSo, in sum:\n\n* There are twelve keys and each of those keys have seven chords that \"belong\" in them. \n\n* Within each key, those seven chords function the same. \n\n* We give each of those chords a number. That way, we can talk about a certain **progression** regardless of the key that progression is played in. If we play it in a different key, the chords will change, but the progression, the relationship of the chords, stays the same. It is the same song, just in a different key.\n\nSo, many people see songs with a bunch of different chords because they are in different keys, and may not realize that the progressions are exactly the same or very similar. The structure of the song is the same. By analyzing the songs by progression, this study showed just how little creativity there is in pop music.\n\nHope that helps.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429115738", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I then use the Trie to do a guided DFS on the grid. Basically as I go I assign Trie nodes to the grid nodes, and then use the Trie to eliminate paths that do not create valid words.\n\nThe most difficult thing was figuring out how to do backtracking, as I realized it would be possible to visit a node in two different ways. For example, the sequence `T H E Y O U R` can be read as `THE YOUR` and `THEY OUR`. Same path, different meanings. In the first example, the junction `E-Y` marks the end of one word (`THE`) and the beginning of another (`YOUR`). In the second example, that same junction is part of a word (`THEY`). Because I use the Trie to guide my DFS, I had to account for this. I ended up using a simple datastructure to keep track of how I visited each junction.\n\nIn the end, the solutions are found very quickly. In fact, the loading of the Trie takes up the majority of the time:\n\n    Trie loaded in 116,00000 ms\n    IT KEEPS YOUR NECK OFF THE LINE\n    Solution(s) found in 5,00000 ms\n    \n    Trie loaded in 116,00000 ms\n    THE PIGGY WITH LARYNGITIS WAS DISGRUNTLED\n    Solution(s) found in 6,00000 ms", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429126290", "subreddit": "dailyprogrammer", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It would be very easy to see if there was a transcription as the letter frequency in a tableau should be exactly equal. Now, yes, I agree that it is a 26x26 table, but the problem is repeated characters in the rows: you can have none. Next test would be to see if there were repeated characters in the columns, which would indicate the tableau has been rotated.\n\nBest attack angle is probably to compare it against the alphabet during the transcription. For example, starting at column 1, I see [G] X R N S [T] U P [?] A V  Q C J M [H] [W] B Z L O [G] [L] [F] [X] [K]. The letters in brackets are uncertain, but there aren't many of them. So compare this against an alphabet ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ and remove the ones you know. This leaves DEFGHIKTWY to be matched to GT?HWGLFXK. There is one K and one H in both so we can include those in the sequence. F is also probably correct. So we have: [G] X R N S [T] U P [?] A V Q C J M H [W] B Z L O [G] [L] F [X] K with DEGITWY remaining.\n\nSecond last character could be a Y rather than an X. Our T was probably good. Fourth last character could very well be an I, and our W is probably fine. That leaves us with [G] X R N S T U P [?] A V Q C J M H W B Z L O [G] I F Y K with DEG remaining.\n\nSo one of those Gs is correct. Looking at the pair, I'd say the first one could be D also, so the remaining character might be an E. That leaves us with a transcript of DXRNSTUPEAVQCJMHWBZLOGIFYK for column 1. That last character doesn't LOOK like an E, but the rest of the pattern certainly fits your idea. If you go through in a similar fashion with the rest of the columns you may strengthen or weaken the idea that it's a rotated tableau.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429132146", "subreddit": "codes", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Adding to everyone else said, there is a thing called weapon' scaling. Form lowest to highest: E D C B A S.\n\nThe higher the letter the more bonus damage it gets for leveling up a particular stat. So if a weapon has D scaling in strength, but C scaling in skill, you're better off pumping levels into skill.\n\nThere are some exceptions, Ludwig's Holy Blade, that scale equally in two different stats. In that case you'll want to make a quality build and pump up both stats to 25 to get the best out of that weapon.\n\nThat being said, it's much more important and cheaper to upgrade your weapon rather than leveling up. Level up only when you feel like you need it. Your main attack stats are skill and strength. Arcane also deals damage, but you need a weapon that deals arcane damage first. Arcane can be applied by adding blood gems to your weapons. \n\nBlood gems are gems that augment your weapons. Some add arcane damage, some add phys damage, etc. \n\nGenerally you want to specialize in a single build, for example strength or skill build.\n\nEach stat has soft and hard caps. Once you hit a soft cap, it means that you will get diminishing returns for continuing to invest in that stat. When you hit a hard cap, you gain even less for continuing to invest in that stat. [Here's a list if you want to learn more about it](http://bloodborne.wikidot.com/stats).\n\nAs for weapons, each weapon is viable for the long run, so don't worry about how \"good\" or \"bad\" a weapon is. Just use the ones that you like the most. Make sure to keep some back up weapons if you forget to repair your main weapon or if your main weapon is not good in your current situation.\n\nMy main weapon is usually one that has moderate speed. I have two secondary weapons: one that's slower but deals massive damage and another that does a ton of bolt damage.\n\nAnother tip : there's an item called the Bold Hunter's Mark that will teleport you to the last checkpoint you used. You will be able to keep all your Blood Echoes(currency). Use it when you think you're in trouble, including boss fights. Juts try to find a safe spot and use the item. \n\nFinally, do not be afraid to ask for help. If you're having trouble with a boss, feel free to ask for co-op help at /r/huntersbell or ask for advice on how to solo it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429137445", "subreddit": "bloodborne", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Most simply, borrowed chords are taken for the purpose of color and harmonic movement from parallel modes. \n\nTake C Major (Ionian), for example:\n\nNotes C D E F G A B\n\nThis combination of notes gives us the following 7th chords:\n\nCmaj7, Dmin7, Emin7, Fmaj7, G7, Amin7, and Bmin7b5 (or B half-diminished)\n\nNow, let's take a look at your most basic 12-bar progression in C:\n\n|C7|C7|C7|C7|\n\n|F7|F7|C7|C7|\n\n|G7|F7|C7|G7|\n\nWell, in the key of C major, the C and F should be maj7 chords, not 7 chords.

In this blues progression, for example, you would play C Mixolydian over the C7 chord, C Dorian over the F7 chord, and C Ionian over the G7.\n\nThis is just the basics, and all of these rules can be bent or broken if you know how.

{"body": "This depends a few factors such as the type of the star, the surface area of the star and the atmosphere of the planet in the way. I want to clarify first that I do not have a concrete answer, merely an explanation.     \n     \nFirst, the type of star. This relates to surface area, lumen output and main type of electromagnetic radiation. Let's use their spectral classification: O B A F G K M. Our sun primarily outputs light in the visible spectrum, whereas brighter stars output light in increasingly higher energy wavelengths like UV. UV is more damaging to the eyes than visible light, O B A stars are way more damaging.     \n     \nNext, stars come in different sizes. The spectral class gives a rough guide to star sizes, but the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram gives a better guide. Bigger stars tend to be more luminous than smaller ones, so red and blue supergiants much more light than the Sun. For instance, Rigel, a blue supergiant, produces 120,000x more light than the Sun. A more precise measurement can be obtained using absolute magnitude.    \n    \nI would say if you're considering a star like that Sun, type G2V, at the orbit of Mars, ~~it would already be safe to look at the Sun (43% of light we get here)~~. If we can extrapolate from that, using the inverse-square law and absolute magnitude of the stars, we can have a rough gauge. Note that this does not take into account the types of radiation coming from the star. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429174648", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

BUT the last 2 times i bet on NWP stack i got utterly punished. with that said, i also don't look forward to CSW's games ever since they kicked xMusica, whom in my opinion was the star player of CSW\n\n* **Empire** vs HR (BO1) - i find this game very high risk, because Empire have lost some very absurd games in the past. however, looking at HR's performance yesterday, as well as Empire's stellar performance at MLG Columbus, i think the odds are somewhat justified. be wary though, for this game is a BO1, so HR might pull out a surprise that catch Empire (and the ettors) off guard\n\n* HGT vs **LGD** (BO3) - LGD is just a far better team than HGT in my opinion.

NaVi just started bootcamping, whereas VP.P have been playing together as a team for quite some time. i feel that VP.P just have stronger individual players.\n\n* 4ASC vs PR - depends on who the standins for PR are. if it's JotM and Shachlo, then i'll heavily favour PR. 4ASC seemed to have dragged their games too long against 4CL yesterday (OH GOD 2 HOURS FOR GAME 3 SERIOUSLY??!?!)\n\n* **Burden** vs Flipsid3 (BO3) - Burden have better players, Flipsid3 has experienced players (granted, they were ex-MYM which didn't do so well..) 80/20 odds don't favour betting though\n\n* Hehe vs BBC (BO3) - no real preference. you can go for w33haa if you want", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429177542", "subreddit": "dota2loungebets", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, it's not exactly Eastern music that has quarter tones.  It's *Middle* Eastern music.  They do have other tuning systems in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but they tend to use more exotic scales; check out the gamelan online for an example.\n\nNow, an octave is 1200 cents.  Always.  If it's not 1200 cents, it isn't an octave.  Why do we count like that?  Because we have 12 equally spaced notes per octave, and we decided to give the space between those notes 100 cents to make things easy to compute.  12 spaces of 100 cents means 1200 cents in an octave.  Even in Middle Eastern music, the octave is 1200 cents.  Now, not all music repeats at the octave.  Sometimes there's even no octave at all.  Here's a scale where there are no octaves, only double octaves: C E G B D F A C.  You can't go an octave up or down from any of these notes, but you *can* go two octaves.\n\nYou mention that Middle Eastern music has quarter steps.  So that would make 24 notes per octave, right?  50 cents apart.  Except that, well, it doesn't, because Middle Eastern music doesn't exactly work like that.  Only some specific quarter steps are used in a particular scale.  While you *could* create new scales using other quarter steps, traditionally you don't.  So, for example, you might have maqam Nawa in C, which goes C Dd Eb F G Ab Bb C, the d representing a half-flat.  The thing is, the actual tuning of that Dd varies from musician to musician, from teacher to teacher, from city to city.  It's not *exactly* halfway like in the Western system.  Indeed, the Turkish system actually works on a 53-note scale, where a whole step is 9 of these little steps and a diatonic half step is 4 of them.  The quarter step could be 2 or 3, but usually you won't see that because instead you'll have a step of 6 and a step of 7, or maybe even 8 and 5, instead of 9 and 4.  So there are still quarter tones, but they aren't *exactly* 50 cents, just something in the vicinity, and we're really talking about 3/4 tones since usually you don't have two notes a quarter step apart in the same scale.

Like a slug.\n\n***\n\n&gt; there's really no way someone with an advanced biochemical lab wouldn't have worked this out years ago. \n\nI have tried to lay out some of the thoughts that where in my mind, as an edit to the original post.  \n\nI am not trying to defend the bad writing.  But I do wonder if it would be possible to convince you that a biochemist could overlook a placebo like this?  \n\nI am just curious how deep into the science I would need to delve, in order to make this seem plausible. \n\nDo you ever think you could be sold. \n\n&gt;Even if the authorities keep careful track of the Pills, she could have just drawn her own blood and analyzed it.\n\nHmm...I will admit this did not occur to me.  However, I also think that there are two problems with this (from a scientific perspective):\n\n1. Blood is VERY complex, and the whole blood assays that are currently used in our society are a result of YEARS of research that establish clear markers for things.  The sort of clear markers that would not exist for a pill of unknown contents.\n2. The most likely result of such experiments is a negative result -- that is the inability to identify a novel component.  However, negative results are tricky in science. I think she would be more likely to conclude her methods are bad -- rather than to leap to the idea of sugar pill. By failing to observe something, it is VERY hard to conclude that the thing you are looking for does not exist.  This is why one needs well-formed, testable, and *falsifiable* hypothesis. The whole blood test would seem to fail the last requirement. Though that could just be me projecting on the Main character.  \n\nAnyway, I hope that didn't come across as an argument.  I was just trying to throw out my ideas.  Basically, I have the same question.  Could I paint this scenario in a way that would be believable to a reader?\n\n***\n\n&gt;She's researching how the Pill interacts with the body and they haven't stopped her? Maybe she masked it as research on different drugs, but it still seems like a fine line to walk, especially since she requested information on the Pill's makeup. \n\nShe is walking a fine line.  And I tried to show that she is sacrificing her own pill to do this.  And she truly believes that she is giving up her life to do so.  I am not sure the extent to which this came across.  But I was trying to paint this picture such that she is taking *desperate* steps to solve this problem.  \n\n&gt;Also, by now, someone would have thrown up the Pill to analyze it.\n\nIt is embarrassing, but I didn't show this at all.  She is one of the first batch of the 'elites'.  Thus, she is one of the first people who could have done this. \n\nBut, yeah, I didn't show that.  \n\n***\n\n&gt;Again echoing other critiquers, you need to vary your word choices and sentence structure more. Far too many sentences in a row start with the same pronoun, and you use words like lab, taste, Pill, over and over and over.\n\nHaha.  Yeah.  :/\n\n***\n\nTHANKS AGAIN for another very thoughtful critique.  I will strive to improve, so that you don't feel your efforts are wasted on me :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429222158", "subreddit": "DestructiveReaders", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't think I agree with this \"base raiding is to easy\" comment. \n\nI'm assuming you are talking about being a group rather than solo, solo is not fun at the moment so i'll just say from my point of view of raiding against other groups, within a group of my own.\n\n* Option 1: you build near PV, base raiding is impossible unless you are 10+ players. Our group has tried to raid PV bases and the amount of zombies is just to difficult to deal with even if constantly running them over, or getting some players of the group to drag hordes away via aggro.\n\n* Option 2: You build a base outside PV. Zombies are not as abundant, but the base is still really hard to raid. If you build a base well, with the aim being defence, which it should be. It is very hard to raid, my group, at the time of the most recent raid. We had 8 players online. It took us 1hr+ to actually assault and gain close proximity to this well defended base. It then took us another 30mins - 1hr to lock the base and surrounding area down enough to protect against returning enemy combatants and also the few that were left inside the base getting onto the roof above and killing us as we tried to lay ethanol for the front gate. \n\nWe finally got inside after 2+ hrs of heavy fighting and loses. It was easily the most fun I have had in this game so far.\n\nI understand it sucks when you log in and your base has been torn to shreds while you were offline/ asleep, but once they have the game past early access. Bases will be much more defensible and potentially you will even have warning systems to wake you etc., if someone raids you while offline. \n\nI agree base raiding should be hard, but it should not be impossibly hard, or what's the point of having bases that are technically raidable, but realisticly unraidable. You could just go play on a P v E server if you want to build bases without being raided by other people? Or the other potential is that you chose a P v P server because you also like fighting and raiding, but you are just angry that you got raided by a group that you didn't get to raid first?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429310524", "subreddit": "h1z1", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

You'll notice that they're not intending to call any of their vehicles Vulcan.\n\nWere they in differing markets, arguing trademark dilution would be the proper course.\n\nThey're not in a different markets.  They're in the exact same market.  It doesn't matter that Vulcan is not the name of Vulcan Aerospace's vehicle.  It is enough that the their competition has named their vehicle identically to the name of a company in the exact same industry.\n\nFor instance, even though Proctor &amp; Gamble is the corporate name of a soap making company, not the actual name of an individual soap product, no rival company could name a their soap, \"Proctor &amp; Gamble soap\" or even \"P&amp;G Soap\".  \n\nVulcan Aerospace would likely argue for an outright trademark violation, not trademark dilution.  \n\n&gt; who beat them by 63 years \n\nAs you pointed out above, dead trademarks are difficult to enforce.  Who can say if BAE even filed for a US trademark, they're a British concern.  Vulcan Aerospace's wouldn't be a dead trademark, it would be as live as they get.\n\n&gt; There is no evidence that that is the case.\n\nWhat upside would there be for Vulcan Aerospace to lie about this?   The trademark office will have it online soon enough.\n\n&gt; Vulcan Inc have incorrectly asserted that they own all rights to the name Vulcan which is clearly untrue since plenty of other companies use it in both their name and products and have done so without challenge.\n\nIt's actually the exact opposite of incorrect.  \n\nYes, other companies in *other* industries use the mark.  There was no rocket company using the mark, and that means  e v e r y t h i n g.\n\n&gt; If the law doesn't agree with him (and it's not that complex), it doesn't matter how much he spends on lawyers.\n\nYou're right, and the inverse directly impacts ULA.  If Paul Allen filed with USPTO before ULA, he wins.  All the money in Boeing and Lockheed's coffers won't change it.\n\nMy guess,  the only reason ULA has not *yet* backed down is because they're waiting to confirm that Allen actually beat them to USPTO, and USPTO isn't known for their speed in approvals.  Once the trademark is officially awarded to Allen's firm, ULA's smartest move would be an immediate renaming.  \n\nMy guess, that's exactly what will happen.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429328332", "subreddit": "spaceflight", "score": 0, "controversiality": 1}

So that I can't press Q W E R to use the spells.\nI have to left click the spells with my mouse then...\nOnly a manually A-Click removes that \"lock\" from my Q W E R spells...\n\nDoes someone know how to deactivate the \"shift+right click waypoint\" order in Heroes? Because there's no option in the game to remove the waypoint move thing... And to be honest. WHO really needs waypoints for one single champion. It's not starcraft :-\\\n\nThanks for help.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429340846", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

First off it smells freaking awesome. A very tart, almost bitter citrus underlaid with lavender and rosemary. It comes together to form a very sophisticated and summery scent, and it's certainly not the first time I've seen citrus and lavender work well together. Performance is superb; I took like a peanut-sized amount and had _extra_ lather after 2 full passes and a touchup pass. The lather itself is dense and creamy, but not the slickest I've used. Post-shave feel is alright, on par with most vegan soaps but not on the level of the tallow or butter-enriched ones. Overall I'm quite pleased, though I did not pay retail price for this and probably would not. Haven't been this impressed by a cream since St. James of London.\n\nWith the above scent profile on the cream you know it had to be Capri for the aftershave. It pairs perfectly, owing to the lemon and lavender that dominate its scent profile.

{"body": "[Link to actual cut.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6AzkyaRhKLYdlhOdGlRbXJwR2s&amp;authuser=0)\n\nI'm hearing there have been problems getting the cut playing.  I'm looking into it.  Just try downloading it instead of streaming from Google docs.\n\nElysium is not a bad movie.  In fact, it's a pretty good movie.  I've admired Neill Blomkamp's work even before District 9 when he was doing short films, like Alive in Joburg.  He has a great style and he's a wonderful director.  That said, I feel he has taken a few missteps when creating this film.  To me, Elysium is a film that's stuck out of its time.  If this were produced in the 1980s, where films with very heavy handed messages like Robocop and Escape from New York were coming out, I think Elysium could have been considered a classic ahead of its time.  So, with that in mind, I set out to create a cut of the film that reflected a style forgotten in the age of 4K resolution and high quality sound.  This is the 80s VHS Cut of Elysium.\n\nFor this cut, I have edited the video, audio, cut down on some needless footage, and added my own soundtrack.  The soundtrack is listed below, and the VHS effect were provided by the wonderful effects package of Red Giant Universe.  I edited the video and sound in Adobe Premiere 5.5 and Adobe Audition 5.5.  Most of the story changes are Jodie Foster related.  I decided to keep this cut very centered on the character of Max, and left the space station Elysium a sort of mystery to the people stuck on Earth...  I also cut the flashback sequences into one montage in the beginning, because I feel like they were too distracting.\n\n**The soundtrack list as as follows:**\n\n**Makeup And Vanity Set - System Override**\n\n**Electric Youth - Runaway**\n\n**Futurecop! - Bright Lights, Big City**\n\n**Makeup And Vanity Set - Val**\n\n**S U R V I V E - Hourglass**\n\n**John Carpenter - Night**\n\n**College - Frontiere**\n\n**Carpenter Brut - Wake up the President**\n\n**Perturbater - Humans Are Such Easy Prey**\n\n**Makeup And Vanity Set - Collapse**\n\n**Makeup And Vanity Set - Don't Wait for Me**\n\n**Teeel - Crystal Lake - Original Mix**\n\n**Makeup And Vanity Set - Omni**\n\n**Lost Years - Exit Music**\n\n**Makeup And Vanity Set - Things to Come**\n\n**S U R V I V E - Black Mollies**\n\n**Le Matos - King's Filth**\n\n**Magic Sword - Infinite**\n\n**Pertubator - War Against Machines**\n\n**Le Matos feat.

{"body": "Smite TP CAN work, but you lose the biggest strenght of hecarim, which is his lane bullying and snowballing potential. With iginite/TP, you can really bully your lane and often, ignite will get you a kill or two in lane, making you snowball really hard since if hecarim gets a lead, he can just all in everytime they come back to lane and kill them again, making him very hard to play against when behind. \n\nThat being said, smite is OK if you're against a unfavorable match up where it's going to be mostly a farm lane. Since hecarim has a lot of waveclear, in bad match ups he mostly just pushes and backs/roams, but lacks killing pressure on his lane opponent (Exemple lanes would be Lulu, Rumble, Sion, Kennen) so he can use his smite to do camps in between waves, letting him get a gold/exp lead or pressure objectives like dragon more easily. The damage from cinderhulk/ red smite will outscale ignite and make you a better duelist and tankier, but if you go ignite and get a lead, you will be much stronger than if you go even with cinderhulk/red smite since you will most likely have a big item/exp avantage in the mid game due to ignite making you snowball. \n\nLooking at your build, you delay boots too much. You should almost always rush homeguard boots on hecarim if you go ignite or at the very least boots for the added MS to be able to get in range and stick to damage them with Q while getting nice resistances depending on lane match up and damage from the movement speed. The big reason you want to rush homeguards is that it let's you recall without losing anything, letting you save your TP to make homeguard TP plays, which is what hecarim excels at, since a homeguarded TP E will do almost half the health of a squishy at pretty much all stages in the game, which can lead to a easily won teamfight.\n\nIf you're gonna do smite top you should go Ruby crystal start, do a camp with smite then tp to lane so you go to lane with a lot of pots, bani's into cinderhulk, then boots into trinity into frozen heart and visage. You should go red smite, because if you proc it once every 3 seconds, it will out damage ignite and give you a mini exhaust on the target (it's very easy to proc it every seconds). Skill order should be R&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;W going Q W E Q lvl 1-4. If you're against a bad lane where you just push/roam/do jungle camps, you can max W 2nd for added waveclear/sustain.

{"body": "*Here are couple msgs I posted on a similar thread few weeks ago*    \nAnswering your last question about mixing pentatonic/blues scales - YES, you should mix major and minor blues/pentatonic scales.   \nHere is roadmap for e.g. slow blues:    \nBar 1: C7(9)   \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 2: F7(9)   \nC minor blues or F major/dominant blues.    \nBar 3-4: C7(9)   \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 5-6: F7(9)    \nC minor blues or F major/dominant blues.    \nBar 7-8: C7(9)   \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 9: G7(9)    \nC minor blues or G major/dominant blues.    \nBar 10: F7(9)   \nC minor blues or F major/dominant blues.    \nBar 11: C7(9) F7(9)    \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \nBar 12: C7(9) G7(9)    \nC minor blues or C major/dominant blues.    \n\nThere are 4 general, simple ways you can play on blues:    \nA. C minor blues all the way through    \nB. C major blues switching to C minor blues on IVth (F7) chord)    \nC. Use major blues scale based on chord type - C major blues over C7, F major blues over F7, G major blues over G7.  On faster more jazzy style like eg jump blues you can use mixolydian scale instead of major blues scale.    \nD. mix all the above from chorus to chorus.    \n\nAs far as your other question... When you say:    \n\"I played it along with the C major backing track. Of course I was playing the Am pentatonic scale\".    \nThat is a bit vague.    \n    \nWhat style was the track in? If somebody plays you a song that only uses diatonic chords from C major scale - i.e. chords based on scale step - eg. simple triads C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am (skipping Bdim for the sake of simplicity) then yes - all you have to play over any of these chords is C major scale. Possibly outlining tones of the chord - eg. over Em you do not want to play C  (unless as a passing tone) - rather concentrate on E, G, B - possible D since it is next extension. And yes you can limit yourself as far as choices of the notes - use pentatonic or even blues scales to give the solo a bit of  a blues flavor. In some cases it will sound good and in some other it will not. If the feeling song relies on a strong resolution to tonic (going back to C chord via eg G7 -&gt; C chords) then perhaps doing it all blues may be out of style. Or perhaps you want a bluesy solo and very major scale sounding vocals. It is an aesthetic choice. Point is you can always use C major scale or any subset of the tones.     \n\nIf song is in C and may be a blues (major blues to be precise) - in that case you use the approach above - you do NOT play C major - in particular you stay away from B to C resolution (which is normal for C major soloing) as it \"kills bluesiness\".    \n \nThere are some tunes that are \"modal\" (not having traditional back to tonic - back to C resolution) - example may be Sweet Home Alabama - on those you often use modes and not scales - most typical is Mixolydian mode. Also Dorian mode.    \n\nAlso song may be in C but it may have a stretch modulating to other key - eg. G major or F major or even Eb major. Or minor keys. In such case what you play is dictated by a LOCAL tonality/key center and you may need notes that are outside C major scale.    \n \nLastly - you often use notes \"out of scale\" to create dissonance in your playing - typically to heighten the resolution - in case of song in C it would be when progression goes back to rest on C chord - eg. G7 -&gt; C. It is called \"playing out\" and is not beginner level stuff. So e.g. you can \"jazz up\" playing over blues to almost no end.      \nHope it helps.\n\n\n*and another one*    \nI would not say you can \"use parallel minor\" but observe that (see definitions below):    \nA minor pentatonic = A C E D G A     \nC major pentatonic = C D E G A C  \nSo these are same tones - rule is if you play minor pentatonic you play major pentatonic a third above (A -&gt; C is a third - 3 semitones above - more precisely a \"minor third\" but that is minutiae).  \n\nLets settle some definitions:     \nMajor pentatonic scale: 1 2 3 5 6 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nMinor pentatonic scale: 1 b3 4 5 b7 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nOR    \nMinor pentatonic scale: 1 3 4 5 7 1 (wrt to natural minor scale)      \nBlues scale (major): 1 2 b3 3 5 6 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nBlues scale (minor): 1 b3 4 #4/b5 5 b7 1 (wrt to major scale)    \nOR    \nBlues scale (minor): 1 3 4 #4/b5 5 7 1 (wrt to major scale)      \n\nExample: key of A     \nA major scale: A B C# D E F# G# A    \nA natural minor: A B C D E F G A   \n(derived from C major scale as starting on 6th step: A)   \nA major pentatonic scale: 1 2 3 5 6 1 of major scale = A B C# E F# A    \nA minor pentatonic scale: 1 b3 4 5 b7 1 of major scale = A C D E G A   \nOR   \nA minor pentatonic scale: 1 3 4 5 7 1 of minor scale = A C D E G A      \nA blues scale (major): 1 2 b3 3 5 6 1 of major scale = A B C C# E F# A   \nA blues scale (minor): 1 b3 4 #4/b5 5 b7 1 of major scale = A C D D#/Eb E G A   \nOR   \nA blues scale (minor): 1 3 4 #4/b5 5 7 1 of minor scale = A C D D#/Eb E G A      \n  \nIf you play track that is say A major blues:     \nA7 D7 A7 A7     \nD7 D7 A7 A7    \nE7  D7 A7D7 A7E7    \nYou can use:     \n1. A minor pentatonic all the way through: A C D E G A    \nor   \nA minor blues scale A C D Eb E G A      \n2. Over A7: A major pentatonic: A B C# E F# A \nor A major blues scale: A B C C# E F# A   \n       \nOver D7: A minor pentatonic: A C D E G A     \nor minor blues: A C D Eb E G A    \nor D major pentatonic D E F# A B D \nor D major blues scale D E F F# A B D     \n3. You can use mixolydian modes (major scale with flatted 7th - b7) on all chords:      \nA7 -&gt; A mixolydian: A B C# D F# G A    \nD7 -&gt; D mixolydian: D E F# G A B C D    \nE7 -&gt; E mixolydian: E F# G# A B C# D E    \nbut as a rule you do not want to to resolve G# -&gt; A - that kills the \"flatted 7th\" feel of the blues", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429383990", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Maybe, for some reason, this word was really resistant to change, and even at some later point in time when 95% of *all* plosives in the language had become voiced, there still remained a very small number of words with unvoiced plosives. If you looked at the language at this point, you'd have to conclude that there were a few instances of very rare voiceless stop phonemes. \n\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that even though the phonemes/allophones your rules have produced are really complicated, it's possible that these very restrictive environments are more of a step in the progression; instead of neutralization, maybe changes are happening and the language is just really picky about what can appear where at this point in time, leading to some rare occurrences of certain phonemes - though obviously since you applied rules directly, this is kind of hard to argue...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429425347", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd argue that dropping the law allows _less_ reasoning, but more lenses. ;)\n\nWith the PutPut law in place you can reason that \"no information is lost\", and that the lens itself is effectively \"linear\". You can express the lenses that can be written in linear logic, even.\n\nThe problem is that the foundations we build upon all make pretty fundamental use of that law.\n\nYou can weaken that foundation, but then you lose the interpretation of lenses as costate comonad coalgebras. We don't use that but that encoding for traditional lenses follows a _consequence_ of the backend that we do use. \n\nThat encoding was useful for finding prisms, defining traversals, letting us talk about indexed constructions, type-changing, etc. _all_ of which are outside of the vocabulary of the bx community.\n\nSo, yes, we could go chase after implementations that permit more lenses but less reasoning about them, but the way that we found these other things was by exploring the variant with the `PutPut` law, and I don't know how to recover them as anything other than an ad hoc construction with a weaker `PutPut`.\n\n(Mike Johnson and Bob Rosebrugh _have_ made some nice attempts at moving in a more general direction.)\n\ne.g. the way I think of lenses these days is in terms of generalizations of a scheme for isomorphisms.\n\n    type Iso s t a b = forall p. Profunctor p =&gt; p a b -&gt; p s t\n\nto different notions of strength.\n\n    type Lens s t a b = forall p. Strong p =&gt; p a b -&gt; p s t\n    type Prism s t a b = forall p. Choice p =&gt; p a b -&gt; p s t\n\nsubject to the linearity conditions above, but `Strong` and `Choice` are both notions of 'strength' for a `Profunctor`, just with regards to different monoidal categories.\n\nI find this viewpoint endlessly more satisfying than the viewpoint that is encumbered by get/put. Why? Because it gives rise to prisms, but it _also_ gives rise to looking for lenses into things like functor composition stacks when you pick the category to be [Hask^Hask] and the tensor to be functor composition. (So you can write a \"lens\" in this generalized setting that picks out the `Reader s` structure from `State s` because `State s` is the composition of `(-&gt;) s`  and `(,) s`.\n\nYou can find other interesting monoidal categories to construct lenses over. For instance, we know Monads don't compose, but we can make a category where the objects are Monad transformers, and the arrows between them are monad transformer homomorphisms. In this category we can define the tensor of two monad transformers `s` and t` to be `(s * t) m a = s (t m) a`, and then we can build lenses using the aforementioned notion of strength. Now lenses into monad transformer stacks let you run simpler monadic actions in a larger monadic context. This is nice, because the usual style we convince people to write mtl code in is to work abstractly:\n\n    foo :: (MonadState s m, MonadReader t m, HasFoo s, HasBar t) =&gt; m Int\n\nwhich is grossly inefficient unless inlined, because it has to look up how to do anything with `m` in a dictionary, but here you can write a concrete action:\n\n    foo :: StateT Foo (ReaderT Bar) Int\n\nand embed it into an arbitrary monad by using the appropriate notion of a lens and iso. (e.g. we can commute `(StateT s * ReaderT e) &lt;-&gt; (ReaderT e * StateT s)`, but some other transformations are directional.\n\nSo, I too find the \"well behaved lenses boring\", but I find them boring because they are a special case of a much larger construct that has been productively producing interesting structures, and I don't know how to weaken that structure in an analogous way to the PutPut weakening while preserving any of its interesting properties.\n\nFWIW- The `lens` library doesn't care about the laws in general. You can work with \"improper\" lenses or prisms with that library all day and the operations all make operational sense.\n\nThe thing that you lose, however, in the presence of a weaker PutPut, or even merely idempotent variants is the ability to know that the combinators in `lens` are canonical. Right now they are equivalent to any other combinator that achieves the same thing. In the presence of the weaker PutPut law \"the\" unique implementation often explodes into 2 or more, often dozens, of alternative implementations which now yield different answers.\n\nThe power of reasoning seems to be definitely on the side of the construction that avoids reasoning about such operational minutiae.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429472422", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

And to be honest, one team has gotten special treatment (not EmpyreaL), so I might as well go with full disclosure here.\n\nEmpyreaL added Eglar to their roster before seeding / roster lock, and f i s s i o n was added afterwards. Both additions are legitimate. What's not legitimate is like four post-lock changes, which is what I did for another team.\n\nI did it because this particular team ignored all of my contact for over a week, and showed up post-seeding with a host incorrect players names. Frankly, I considered delaying the entire tournament and re-seeding things.\n\nBut fuck that. One team captain that can't get his shit together isn't going to turn into a speedbump for the entire event. The seeding is done, I'm happy enough with it, and I'd rather just get things going.\n\n*****\n\nHaving said that, if any entered team feels the need to take advantage of this for \"fairness\" sake, I just don't care enough to fight you. I'm sending out an email to all team captains notifying them they can make up to four changes (including the one currently allowed - not in addition) until April 27th because I'd rather do that than re-seed and delay.\n\nAn announcement post for the start of the season will go up a little later today.\n\n**TL;DR: EmpyreaL didn't get special treatment. Another team did because they failed at following directions.

{"body": "National Grange wants only GMO hemp — with strong-arm enforcement\nNational Grange wants only GMO hemp — with strong-arm enforcement\nBy Adam Eidinger VoteHemp.com - March 18th, 2010\nSOURCE: http://www.westcoastleaf.com/?p=854\n\nOne of the nation’s leading farming organizations passed a bizarre new policy statement in support of industrial hemp farming, but only if it is genetically modified (GMO) and retains cannabis prohibition with very heavy law enforcement.\n\nThe National Grange of the Order of Patron of Husbandry, known simply as “The G r a n g e , ” made the statement in November at its annual m e e t i n g , against the urging of advocacy groups such as Vote Hemp that GMO hemp is offensive and unnecessary because varieties of the cannabis with low THC are widely available in Canada and elsewhere.\n\nThe Grange policy statement states: “The National Grange supports research, production, processing and marketing of industrial hemp as a viable agricultural activity. We do not in any way support or condone the growth or use of marijuana as a hallucinogen.\n\n“We support strict enforcement of all laws that currently ban the production and sale of marijuana or that classify all species of cannabis as a Class 1 controlled substance in the US. We oppose amending these laws as the primary means of promoting industrial hemp production.\n\nInstead we urge further research and application of existing biotechnology techniques to develop genetically modified industrial hemp that will be biologically incompatible with all other forms of cannabis or marijuana.\n\nWe further urge that genetically modified industrial hemp contain distinct chemical markers that will quickly and easily identify industrial hemp varieties using low cost and accurate on-site testing methods for the purpose of contract compliance, law enforcement and as evidence in court.”\n\nSince organic products must not be made with GMO crops, Vote Hemp is concerned that GMO hemp envisioned by The Grange would undermine the already strong demand for certified organic hemp seed while alienating organic consumers who make up the core of demand for hemp food and body care products produced in North America.\n\nFurthermore, no GMO hemp has been developed and with the prospect of the Dept. of Justice finally recognizing state hemp farming laws as they recently did with medical marijuana laws, the GMO hemp envisioned by The Grange would be irrelevant to the current market demand for hemp seed, oil and fiber now valued at $360 million in annual sales according to the Hemp Industries Association.\n\nVote Hemp representatives speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue, say “If GMO hemp were developed to be ‘biologically incompatible’ with marijuana it would only benefit marijuana growers who have real concerns of cross pollination between high THC marijuana and low THC hemp.” Outdoor marijuana growers fear cross pollination and ultimately seeding of their crop. “Ironically, The Grange states it does not support changing marijuana laws and is arguing for a policy that ostensibly would protect marijuana growers from cross-pollination while alienating their customers in the natural marketplace who want non-GMO hemp,” says the Vote Hemp spokesperson.\n\nVote Hemp has worked with members of National Farmers Union (NFU), The Grange, and the American Farm Bureau to get pro-hemp resolutions passed. NFU members will be presenting pro-hemp resolutions at their annual meeting this March, which already passed on the state level. New NFU president Roger Johnson is the former Agriculture Commissioner from North Dakota and a strong supporter of hemp farming. Vote Hemp worked closely with Roger Johnson and North Dakota state legislators to pass bills, promulgate farming regulations, and issue the first state hemp farming licenses in 2008.\n\nAs a result of those North Dakota state licenses being issued to state Rep.

{"body": "Hey guys, softie here. I'm the one who ended up stepping up and TOing PM with Heysuess. Initially the plan was for me to run a few pools and then manage the day 2 bracket, but that didn't quite work out lol.\n\nJust wanted to come in and say thanks to everyone for sticking with us all weekend. I'm sure you heard me say it often all of Sunday (expecially during the lulls in bracket waiting for games to catch up) but it really does mean a lot.  I don't want to steal zman thunder because I know he's going to make a big comment later. \n\nPM didn't run exactly how I wanted it too. We had a few early hiccups in wave one of pools, stemming from losing a few setups in the various spill over rooms to make space for other games, but thankfully we were serious about no last minute entrants so day one ran okay (very well compared to the other events)\n\nI do want to take partial responsibility for matches holding up bracket, like hbox playing out all of his smash 4 run before playing round 2 winners pm. I wasn't stern enough for demanding the players in multiple events to come play games. If I had been on point with that, or if there were no extra entrants in other events, pm would have probably been done completely by 7 or 8. I was quite frustrated with it due to the fact the whole TO staff had worked out litterally 5 contingency plans and schedules to avoid it, and most of them got neglected as soon as they pulled players away from us finishing top 3 pm doubles, which we planned on doing immediatly as the day started. \n\nThere was poor communication between TOs of different events which caused most of the hold ups in the bracket and I do want to apoligize for that. I dropped the ball in that area pretty hard for pm.\n\nI'm not going to go around posting for damage control or anything like that, I have no patience for most of reddit, sorry guys :p . If you want full explinations, dark dragoon will be talking on the next miom pod cast. \n\nI do have one huge request though, which is to not turn this into a \"pm is being held down/shoved aside for melee/smash 4\" thing. I hate playing the victim, and I know zman and everyone else who helps with azpm does as well, which is evident in azpm stepping up on streaming. pm had the shorter end of the stick in a couple situations, but we were also the smallest event by around 40 people. Just like, please don't use the victim card ever, we are fine as a community and it looks bad and leaves a horrible taste in my mouth when I see people complaining about unfair representation instead of going out and playing/creating their own representation for the game. \n\nYou guys are awesome, please keep enjoying this game with us. Also shit this is longer than I wanted it to be lol. \n\n\nM O O N B O Y Z ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429526122", "subreddit": "SSBPM", "score": 45, "controversiality": 0}

You can't drown out differing opinions since posts are displayed in a chronological order and actual discussions take place, since you need to read all the posts to follow the conversation.\n\nA system like Reddit is always going to end up in hivemind opinions being constantly voted up, essentially creating an echo chamber of people dancing around trying to post the least offensive shit possible in order to keep the hivemind happy.\n\nUnfortunately there's no way moderate the way people upvote/downvote, so in the end the up arrow is always going to be an \"I agree button\" and the down vote button is always going to be a \"This person made a great point and backed it up with facts and evidence, however since I disagree I'm going to attempt to censor them\".\n\nIt's pretty depressing.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429528192", "subreddit": "starcitizen", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Hey guys, Saga here from AZPM just wanting to clear a few things up; I am NOT MVG, and I was not officially staff for Sandstorm. I'm just a player who LOVES Project M, its fans, players, and mission. And just like you guys at home and many of the guys in venue, I had many issues with the way things were run.\n\n\nThe point of me and Zman going on mic to rant wasn't to try and push the blame for all of Sandstorm onto the S4 TO's. While I did voice a few complaints, they were all easy mistakes to make with their first time running an event this size. ALL OF OUR POOL CAPTAINS AND TOs are good guys doing hard work, especially after feedback from day 1, and we don't want you guys to get the wrong impression of how AZ rolls. The start of S4 pools, as I stated, was REALLY rough in the S4 room. Numerous setups were woefully unprepared to be used for tournament, and in my personal opinion the room space was not being used efficiently. I did specifically call out the S4 guys for allowing Hbox to enter 3 events, mostly because I saw/heard him confront their lead TO about it and (as someone who's similarly been on that end of a pressuring Hbox :P) could feel him caving, so it may well have not been his fault. I heard second-hand that there were also S4 players being entered into the bracket on-site, but that was, again, second-hand info that I probably should I have stayed close-lipped about. I don't intend to fire shots or burn bridges with our S4 scene at all, in fact my S4 experience this weekend really makes me want to go out to events for it more often (M O N A D O B O Y S!)\n\n\nAnd you know what? After day 1, they all heard you. Everyone busted their behinds and were unfortunately hit with some Murphy's Law (ie. the power cut in Melee GFs, and word getting out of the cringeworthy t-shirts, etc) that were completely beyond the control of the TOs. And, if my eyes weren't wrong, the Melee stream used a different layout day 2? Shoutouts to the S4 TO's in particular for being the first game to completely finish (though to be fair, it WOULD have been PM except for y'all know what :P)\n\nThe staff truly worked hard, and I hope you guys saw improvement day 2. Now, that being said, we didn't have anything to do with you guys' awful chat experience, stream crashes, the unfortunate t-shirts, immature language used by staff, and you have every right to be upset about these things! Let MVG know! For all the faults of this event, they hooked us up with a SICK (albeit internetless at the time XD) venue, and I would love to see more events of this scale in AZ. Just hopefully run much better. \n\n\nApologies for being an angry PM-lover who's tired of seeing the game I love get shoved aside &lt;3 I truly hope that if nothing else you all enjoyed the insane levels of play all three games saw this weekend. \n\nPS: /u/azprojectmelee is growing a huge ego from all the love you guys are giving him.

(Add to that that the greybacks who spend the money for those instruments will most likely never use them themselves and will blame any software error on the operator, anyway). \n\nWe have instruments that can on paper export to CSV, ASCII and a host of other formats.

There does not seem to be any logic as to which files this happens for. Of course they won't give us the specs for their fileformat which seems to be a mixture of ASCII, binary and Klingon.\n\nFor some measurements the sop in our lab now includes: turn off instrument a, turn off instrument b, turn off pc, restart in this order.

{"body": "The main issue with this is the obvious one: if you have M constructors and N functions on your type, you have to write M * N code to handle all permutations.  No amount of language support for open data types and open functions will solve this fundamental limitation.\n\nWhenever I encounter such a situation that requires O(M * N) code, there is usually a better solution that requires O(M + N) code instead which obviates the expression problem.  I'll use two concrete examples.\n\nExample #1: Converting between document formats\n\nLet's say you have M input document types that you wish to convert to any of N output document types.  The naive solution would be write M*N conversion functions, one for each permutation of input and output type.  A smarter solution (which `pandoc` uses) is you define M conversion routines from the input document types to a standard intermediate type, then define N conversion routines from the intermediate type to each output document type, which is O(M + N) code.\n\nExample #2: Operations on data types\n\nLet's say that I have M operations (such as `map`, `forM`, `put`, `get`) that I wish to perform on N data type fields.  The naive solution would be to write M*N operations, one for each permutation of operation and field.  A smarter solution is to factor everything through lenses.  You define M operations on lenses (such as `over`, `formOf`, `assign`, `use`) and N lenses which is O(M +N) code.  This is conceptually very similar to the trick `pandoc` used, except this time the \"intermediate format\" that we are factoring everything through is the set of generic lens types, such as:\n\n    type Lens s t a b = forall f . Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; (s -&gt; f t)\n    type Traversal s t a b = forall f . Applicative f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; (s -&gt; f t)\n\nEach lens is a producer of a standard intermediate optic type, and each function on lenses is a consumer of a standard intermediate optic type.\n\nSo whenever you see the expression problem and are contemplating writing O(M*N) code, you should instead rethink the problem and see if you can refactor all combinations through some intermediate format and reduce the problem to O(M + N) code.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429559018", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

Jigglypuff - risings pounds, 5 mid-air jumps, great aerial mobility\n\n3. Pikachu - Skull bash + quick-attack can mean that Pikachu can recover from anywhere and land anywhere on stage. QA's landing lag is mitigated by the fact that he can choose 2 angles. \n\n4. King Dedede - Waddle-dashing + multiple mid-air jumps + up-b that can cancel and has super armor when rising\n\n5. Kirby - floaty, multiple mid-air jumps, and final cutter has two angles. Honestly, I'm not sure about number 5.\n\nShout outs to Peach, Luigi, Ike, Rob and Lucario (with aura) for being close to this list.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTop 5 Combo Games:\n\n1. Lucario. ASC + Magic Series = traditional fighting game levels of combo'ing\n\n2. Lucas. Magnet + great aerials + DJC. His aerials lead into other moves... Lucas is a combo god, though he sometimes struggles to kill.\n\n3. Mr. Game &amp; Watch. Down tilt or grab leads to up-b or any aerial. He can keep juggling enemies in the air.\n\n4. Falco. P I L L A R B O Y S\n\n5. Toss-up between Sheik and Wolf. Sheik's combo's can almost be made into a flow-chart, and Wolf's shine leads to everything and can be use after almost all of his aerials/approaches.\n\nShout-outs to Luigi, DK, Marth, Yoshi, Tink, Fox and Roy for being close contenders for this list.\n\nEDIT: Formatting is hard.

{"body": "I tried to write a whole big post yesterday, but then I looked it over and said \"lmao this is a turd\" and deleted it, so here are just some points:\n\n- that recording your linked is pretty decent, esp given it's a smartphone\n\n- if you want a tight, dry, full sound, you want that microphone as close to the instrument as possible (while getting an even coverage with no hotspots)\n\n- (recording is an acoustically dead room will help with above)\n\n- you can do it with one mic, you can do it with two mics, or with a hundred, it just takes judicious application\n\n- for my work, i typically want the treble side more present in the mix, so i'll make sure to have a close mic there and perhaps a slightly farther one for the bass side. i could cut down the bass side in the mix, but if i can get it with mic placement, then i think that works out better in the end\n\n- if you're working with multiple microphones, you really need to key in on the mixing process. having a good recording knowledge is necessary, but then you have to mix it. and it's just like any other kind of mixing, only on a smaller scale when you've just got this one (awkward and complicated and weird) instrument\n\n---\n\nas for equipment, I used a portable Zoom recorder for a good while and was very pleased with its quality. I used the H2 model, but I'm pretty sure they have a better replacement for it that's probably on the affordable side\n\nNow, I use a combination of different pieces of kit that are each pretty affordable. Focusrite USB interface ($150), a couple of AT2020s ($100 each), and some N I C E microphone XLR wire (the quality stuff makes me chub every time). i use Ableton for mixing and all that, but you can use whatever software makes you tingle\n\nrecording accordion is tough and puzzling, but once you find something that works, that should hopefully develop into a system. I still try out new stuff each time i record, but the general principles are there so I'm not COMPLETELY lost. \n\nlet me know if you have any more questions, I'd be happy to answer :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429577788", "subreddit": "Accordion", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; ...I have learned a few Hiragana characters...\n\n\nFor example, let’s say you learn the following 5 Hiragana characters\n\n\nあ い う え お\n\n\nThese 5 Hiragana characters have almost similar role as alphabet in English like A B C D E (For your information, We call it syllable to be correct for Hiragana and Katakana as The Japanese Writing System). The role is they show us how to read/say a word. \n\n\nAs you know, the English letter \"A\" or “B” or “C” doesn't have any specific meaning. It’s the same with the Hiragana \"あ\" or Katakana \"ア” that they don’t have any particular meaning. They show you how to read/say a word. In this case, Hiragana \"あ\" is read as like English letter “A” and Katakana \"ア” is also read as the English letter “A”.\n\n\nThe Romaji helps us how to read/say these Japanese writing system in English language equivalent. Imagine if there is no Romaji at first, we will need a Japanese person to teach us whenever we want to read/say Japanese words written in Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji or we will need a use a tape recorder to record what the Japanese says corresponding to the Hiragana/Katakana and then we play the tape recorder again and again. By using Romaji, it acts as our speaking guidance/tutor.\n\n\nLet’s say you also learn the following 10 Hiragana characters\n\n\nか き く け こ ま み む め も\n\n\nWith the help of Romaji, we know that they are read as “ka” “ki” “ku” “ke” “ko” “ma” “mi” “mu” “me” “mo” respectively. (No need to call the Japanese person or using tape recorder again.) So whenever we see a Japanese word like “かみ”, it shows us that we should read that word as “kami” and not “kane” or “kita” and so on. \n\n\n&gt; …I am a little confused about how to use them however. For example, if i saw a sentence written in Hiragana, would I look at each character and say those sounds to make english words, or would it make Romaji words…\n\n\nLet’s say you see this sentence written in Hiragana\n\n\nこれはかみです\n\n\nFor me, I would look at each character and make it into Romaji words in my mental mind. So it becomes\n\n\nKorewakamidesu\n\n\n(Having said that, as you improve your Japanese, you will want to remember how to say each Hiragana and Katakana characters correctly without relying on Romaji again. When that time comes, whenever you see see a sentence written in Hiragana, your mental mind will know how to read that sentence instantly.)\n\n\n&gt; …And if it made Romanji, wouldn't I then have to learn all of the definitions for those words?...\n\n\nYes, we need to learn all the definitions of those words to know the meaning. The issue now is to how to “split” or “break apart” the sentence into more “understandable words/pieces” so that we can reach to the correct meaning/definition. For example, using the example sentence\n\n\nこれはかみです\n\n\nWith the help of Romaji, it’s read as \"Korewakamidesu\". To reach the correct meaning/definition of this sentence, we need to “split” or “break apart” the sentence correctly. Since I already know some basic Japanese, in my mental mind, I already know that I need to split the sentence into these “broken parts/words” :\n\n\nこれ read as “kore” which means “this”\n\n\nは read as “wa” (usually this is read as “ha”, but when it functions as particle, it’s read as “wa”) which is a particle to mark that the word before it is a topic (which can also roughly translate the word before it is a subject)\n\n\nかみ  read as “kami” which means “paper”\n\n\nですread as “desu” which is a copula and it acts like “is/am/are”\n\n\nSo, the sentence \n\n\nこれはかみです\nread as “Korewakamidesu”\ntranslated as “This is (a) paper”\n\n\nIf we don’t split it correctly, we may end up with this composition (which cannot be translated into a meaningful sentence) :\n\n\n これ   はか   みで   す\n“kore” “haka” “mide” “su”\n\n\nこれread as “kore” which means “this”\nはかread as “haka” which is unclear\nみでread as “mide” which is unclear\nすread as “su” which is unclear\n\n\nSo, now how we can “split” the sentence correctly? I would say as we learn new vocabulary words and grammar, this “split” thing will become a second nature. Having said that, most of the Japanese textbook for beginners have already helped you to split the sentence. For example, in previous example, I write これはかみです, but in the Japanese textbook, it may be written as これは   かみ   です.\n\n\nRegarding Kanji for better translation, I would say you will need to learn Kanji at some point. But as a starting point, slowly improving your Hiragana and Katakana first. Then, try to learn some Kanji words to expand your Japanese vocabulary. Kanji itself has to be read, right? And how we read the Kanji? We use Hiragana/Katakana. To conclude, we need Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji to learn Japanese.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429599955", "subreddit": "LearnJapanese", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "How much would you like to break your game? Something as simple as leveling up pickpocketing early  (maybe a half hour of grinding) and you can at least one character their best non secret dungeon weapon. \n\n\nWhichever character you choose as main locks out another party member.  Claude gets you a caster, Rena gets you a melee. Something important is that you can refuse every character and end up with just the two mains. I'll edit more into this post later when not on a phone. \n\n**Alright. This is a game that hugely benefits from, if not a 100% walkthrough guide, a \"secrets guide\" like you would get if you combined a multitude of FAQs, but the A L E X guide from GF is the best there is http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/198763-star-ocean-the-second-story/faqs/4627\n\nTo cliffnotes what I think is most important.\n\nEvery town you go to, talk to the skill guild. Learning all the skills you can train as fast as possible is very important. The abilities you unlock with the skills will make or break how much fun this game can be. Pickpocketing, Publishing and Blacksmithing are all very important to get ASAP! To that end, you SHOULD restart the game multiple times until your character has the Nimble Fingers trait, which you can check in the skills menu (I can't recall the hotkey to open it, not that there are many to check)\n\nYou have 8 character slots and (in Second Evolution) 11 characters to fill the slots with (although 7 of them have conflicts with one or two others thus limiting you to more like 9-10). I reccomend skipping caster characters like Celine/Noel/Leon as they will do 1/10th the damage in 5x the time as a melee. The only truly effective caster is Rena, and she can do a decent amount of melee damage herself.\n\nOnce you get pickpocketing leveled up (try to get at least level 8 before doing any of it, really) ransack everything. You can backtrack all the way to the starting town to pickpocket people, although you lose access to the first part of the world until the end of the game about 15-20 hours in. Some key pickpockets include Ernest if you get him as a party member. The Bunny mascot in Fun City. The crew on Claudes ship  (only if playing as Claude) and most importantly (from a game breaking perspective)...in the town of Mars next to the inn is a man you can pickpocket for the Treasure Box item. Inside there you is the previously mentioned best non ultimate weapon for every character. Save before pickpocketing him, Save before opening the box.\n\nReally I could go on for another 5000 words, there is so much to know about this game. The faq I linked has it all. I recommend having it handy or skimming through it.\n\n\nPS - there is a boss you fight 3 times, the first 2 times you fight the boss named Shin you can't win.

Also, if I get cocky/offensive at some point just ignore that like a nice Buddah would because I don't really mean it in any negative way. But I apologize in advance. (I've done that so many times already lol) \n\n* W E L L M E T ;D\n* Minor thing but you can send your first ovie directly to his natural. Just make sure to hide it by 3:40 mark because that's when the marine will pop out!\n\n* Should've injected with your nat queen before you started attacking the reaper. It's not like you can kill it with your queen anyway.\n\n* OH SHIT THE SPORE COMPLETED!!!!!! That's pretty bad. But hey, you're not against Maru. It's not a game ending mistake. Just be careful next time.\n\n* I know, we all hate reapers. Completely forgot about your ovie at 26 supply, right? So now your supply blocked at 28 supply? Ugh. You know, that actually hurts you quite a bit. It delays your drone count, thus delaying your third timing, gas timing, lair timing, upgrade timing, etc etc. It's a huge draw back. I know, it's only one ovie. But if you think about it, it's basically 4 more drones that could've been made 25 seconds earlier!\n\n* 5:30, you have 3 ovies out, and I do NOT like your ovie spread. Okay, the one near the nat is nice. There is one ovie heading towards T's main base. That's good. But why is there an ovie just chilling over your nat hatch? ;-; You need to send your first ovie to the nat (which you did) send your second to the main (which you kinda did with the third one) and send your third one to the dead air space to spot drops. &lt;- This is crucial! Good ovie drops are key to defending drops. I hope you fix your ovie spread later into the game. Right now I'm not so happy brah.\n\n* So. 28/36 food, 255 minerals, 8 larvae. 0 Drones in production. If I were you and I accidentally supply blocked myself at 28 supply, I would be literally spamming that SD until my ovie pops. I WANT TO MAKE UP FOR THAT LOST TIME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. It took you quite some time until you started producing 5 drones. I like the ovie at 33 supply though. Good call.\n\n* 6:20. So far you don't look like you are going to bane bust. If you are, I'm sorry but it really doesn't look like you are. So my question is, where is your third? You have 24 drones. That's a good time to expand in ZvT. It's already past 6 minutes. Your third is a little bit too late to compete with 2-basing Terran. If I were you, I would've taken a third, THEN make 8 lings, THEN take second gas (and saturate the gas in main), THEN get lair, keep droning, THEN get 2 evos.\n\n* I have to say that your production is pretty bad. You need constant production. You have way too many idle larvae. Take an earlier third, try to hit 2 base saturation (38 drones) as soon as possible. The initial 2 to 4 hellions by 7:30 can be fended off by 2 or 3 queens at nat. Make lings while your third is building. Once your third is done, drone up until you're safe. Basically, what I'm saying is that the 8 lings you just made at 7 minute mark are quite useless.\n\n* Okay, so I'm at 7:15 and I see you throw down a bane nest. This tells me that you have no game plan at all. You had about ~120 gas, and had only 1 drone mining the gas this whole time. What was your plan? Were you planning on playing macro and getting a quick lair? Playing aggressive and getting a quick bane nest? Playing greedy and getting a double evo? If I were planning on getting a quick lair, I would started lair as soon as I had 100 gas, saturate the main gas and take another gas at nat. If I wanted to be aggressive, I would've actually taken my second gas when I had 7 drones at nat and throw down a bane nest when the second gas completes (because I like bane busting off of full 2 base saturation, not 1.5). If I wanted to get ahead in upgrades, I would've gotten double evo at 100 gas, so that when they complete I can immediately start 1/1. Instead, you waited until 120 and impulsively decided that you want a bane nest. BTW no lair until 7:15 is quite late tech. No 2/2, no bane speed, no mutas for a while. If this kind of low tech play was your original plan, well, it doesn't make sense to be because the whole point of low tech is either to expand aggressively (i.e. quick third at 5:30) or to play low econ aggression (i.e. my favorite build of all time, bane bust). Neither of which you did - your third timing, actually, made way more sense with more of a tech heavy play. But then your gas timing didn't make sense for a tech heavy play since you were so, so low on gas. Which means you were quite heavy on minerals. Then again, your third was late despite your seemingly greedy play. Hmmmm. Think about it. IMO these are really fine points in SC2 macro that lower leaguers can afford to look over. But as we get better, we gotta fine tune our knowledge, don't you think? :p\n\n* I personally don't like how you are so passive with your queens. You had 2 creep queens at the ramp - why didn't you pull away your nat queen right after she injects, queue up another at nat hatch, and use the 3 queens to fend off 3 reapers and 2 hellions? If you did that, then you would've been able to run by with your lings. Use what you've got - make the most out of the things you've invested into. T hasn't even walled his natural yet, so just imagine this: 3 queens prodding at 3 reaper/2 hellions while 12 zerglings running by into T's natural right as his 2 more hellions move out. Three things can happen: 1. T retreats with 3 reapers and 4 hellions to defend against lings. 2. The lings kill SCVs but die to the 2 hellions that just moved out. 3.  The lings get barely any SCV kills but gets the 2 additional hellions, which really weakens T's map control. Just think about it. What's the most cost effective way to play your game?\n\n* 7:54, two comments: 1. Your gases are super, SUPER late. Your tech is delayed, your upgrades are delayed. You're behind in every aspect. 2. You're supply capped at 44 (he killed one ovie so now at 36) while he's at 57. This tells me that your, the Zerg's, productivity is worse than that of Terran's. That makes no sense to me. We are supposed to be producing better than Terran! How can we EVER be lower on supply when there has not been any major aggression?\n\n* See? When your double evo complete you don't have enough gas to afford anything. Er, sorry, you can afford just +1 melee. I think you just forgot about gas and made a mistake. You know what, it must've been a mistake. Let's keep it there. I will stop commenting on it. But that was a BIG mistake.\n\n* Okay. WHAT? 8:16 and you have 8 drones at nat? I'm kind of awed at this point. So all this time you have been doing practically nothing. Oh wait nevermind, you spent all your money on overlords. your at 37/68. I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. You accidentally supply blocked yourself at 28/28, remember? If I were you, I would've realized that I'm behind and try to ooze out as many drones as possible. 36/44, 44/52, 52/68, 68/88 ... You can't just spam overlords like freaking 37/68, bro.\n\n* One more thing. 16 drones at main and 8 drones at nat. Taking the third gas in ZvT when your lair has not even started? This gas timing is very questionable. 2 base saturation ling/bane only needs 2 gases. You are on 1.5 base saturation (you really shouldn't be, btw) with hatch tech (aka ling/bane). Only take 2 gases, start lair, then take 3rd and 4th. That 3rd gas honestly makes 0 sense to me. Maybe up to plat random gas timings worked out for you. It won't work anymore. You gotta refine your gas timing, or else your macro will slip severely.\n\n* Again, your ovie spread. Take the map. Spread them ovies all around the dead air space. Actually, no don't do that because one viking can kill them all. Put one near the nat, one near the main, two along the edge of the map and two along the other edge of the map. Should be good enough to scout any incoming drops.\n\n* HEY!!!! YOUR LARVAE JUST POP AT 8:37!!!! ON BOTH HATCHERIES!!!!!! So why isn't you immediate reaction to press SD?!?!?!?!?!??!?!? Make them drones, baby! We want 'em!!! We want 'em soooo bad!!!!!!!\n\n* It's been about 2 minutes since you got double evo but 0 upgrades have been researched. Impressive, my friend.\n\n* 3 gas until lair completes doesn't make sense to me. If you have been planning on getting a spire asap, take 4 gases as lair begins. If you are getting lair only for earlier bane speed, 2/2, overseers and creep pooping, stay on 2 gases, and take your 3rd and 4th gas as soon as lair completes. There is no reason to have 3 gases before lair unless your playing some early roach push like you would in ZvZ.\n\n* You're on 4 gases, waiting for spire to finish so you can get mutas out. Meanwhile you morph 3 overseers. For WHAT? You will need ONE for scouting (morph the one near the main), another for your ling/bane army, and a 3rd one for your muta flock AFTER YOUR MUTAS HATCH. By spending 150 gas on 3 overseers that won't achieve much, you just reduced your muta count by essentially 2.\n\n* Macro hatch only after you reach the 66 drone mark. Take macro hatch and 4th together. IDK why, but for some reason 3 base economy is exponentially larger than 2 base economy. (I may be wrong but that's what I experience whenever I play.) Basically, 1 base eco can support 2 hatch production, 2 base eco can support 3 hatch production, but 3 base eco can support... uh well 5 hatch production. IDK why but that's just how it works I guess.\n\nMaybe you were just on a tilt or something that day because this game looks pretty atrocious to me. http://ggtracker.com/matches/5936005.

{"body": "The reason for the MonadReader et. al. type classes is simple data abstraction, since several monads have reader \"capability\". For instance both `ReaderT m` and `RWS` support the `ask` function. \n\nThe type class simply let's us write `ask` without worrying which particular monad instance with the reader capability is being used, in exactly the same way as `sum :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a` doesn't care about which kind of numbers are in the list, only that we can use `(+)` to combine them.\n\n---\n\nGenerally monad transformer definitions have instances like `Monad m =&gt; Monad (ReaderT m)`, which is what make the compiler know that they are monads. Of course `ReaderT f` where `f` is not a monad is not a monad.\n\n---\n\nRWS is not particularly complicated, it's essentially just the simple reader/writer/state monads combined as transformers and inlined for performance. It's definition is `newtype RWS r w s a = RWS { runRWS :: r -&gt; s -&gt; (a, s, w) }`, you can find it on hackage [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-1.1.0.2/docs/src/Control-Monad-RWS-Strict.html#RWS)\n\n---\n\nMonadfix is more advanced, but it's an alternative to the function `fix :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a`, that supports \"value recursion\" which means it behaves like `fix` but makes sure the effects of the monad are executed only once. We can take `fix g` where `g :: (m a -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a` but often this will not do what we want, and we need a function `mfix :: (a -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a` instead. \n\nI recommend first understanding the pure `fix`, for more info check out [this link](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Fix_and_recursion).

{"body": "Posts of yours like this and [others](http://evenews24.com/2015/04/18/pandemic-hordes-2-weeks-in-space/#comment-1975127681) make me interested in how the undoubtedly unbiased article of yours from [this request](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/333sjn/looking_to_interview_a_line_member_in_brave/) will turn out.\n\nAs someone who's had experience inside, with, and outside Brave, I'd like to give my opinion on this subject. To give some introduction of who I am, first of all my main's a long-time [TEST pilot](http://evewho.com/pilot/Unreal+Blight) who's flown with PL during HBC and was briefly in a corp that later merged into Snigg, meanwhile [my alt](http://evewho.com/pilot/Ax+Terr) was for a short time inside BNI-proper, and currently sits as [one of the most active members](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98388312/top/) of Horde. So I have experience within HERO, within BNI, within Horde, previously flew with CFC and PL, and have friends in many alliances including in TEST/Brave/PL/Horde/CFC which are the focus of your post. On top of that, I've seen the newbie programs of CFC, worked for years in the TEST newbie program, helped in Dojo, and currently watching the growth of Horde, so I'd like to believe I have some idea of how Brave differs from similar projects.\n\nOne of the reoccurring notions that I've seen from you specifically repeatedly, as well as others, is the implication that Brave is the first ever instance in the EVE universe where a bunch of new people got together to create a new big group, which is nowhere near the case. I'm not quite sure where this notion has come from, and why is seems to be so widespread in Brave, but there are actually quite a few members of Brave who simply seem to believe that no alliance pre-Brave ever actively recruited new players. You say that Brave is different in that it's \"genuine\" and \"authentic\", which, to me, is complete meaningless buzzwords with literally no substance. You've said that Horde, Karmafleet, Dreddit and other large non-Brave newbie focused programs appear 'duplicitous' to you, yet they appear to me to do almost exactly what Brave does, so I'm not entirely sure what the point of those claims are. I'd be interested in why you believe that Goonswarm or TEST who came before Brave are completely inauthentic, when they actually share many stark similarities in how they started and grew. \n\nI actually don't know where to begin with the \"stay classy\" culture because from the outside it seems like such an absurd perversion of self-righteousness that it sometimes leave me boggled, but to address it slightly, I never in my experience inside BNI and in HERO found Brave particularly 'classy' at all. Unfortunately there's a large amount of Brave pilots (not you specifically) who have never actually played in alliance outside of Brave (Brave being the lowest of notable null alliances on the #of alts per actual people chart during the fanfest slide comes to mind), so they've never actually seen what it's like in other alliances, but there are very few if frankly any alliances at all that actually live up to all the boogeyman stories you hear about in Brave lobbies. Meanwhile at almost any given moment during HERO's stay in Catch, I'd find that GE defense, lobby when certain individuals aren't around, and most fleet comms were actually much more toxic, childish and immature than TEST comms, which were routinely said to be the worst of the worst as far as unclassy behavior. It seemed like everything under the sun in Brave is considered classy, until someone says a select couple of words, and then that's where the line is crossed, which I find comical because you can do and say things day after day in Brave that would get you kicked from TEST under the \"don't be a dick\" rule, but would fly in Brave purely because they didn't use the n-word. \n\nAs for other programs and their 'classyness', ever since goons started to ironically unironically pick up on the SJW gimmick, and had their cultural revolution pre-Brave they've legitimately turned into a group with a relatively positive atmosphere. TEST historically swings yearly on how much room is given to unclassiness, but has stuck to their #1 rule of no matter who you are or what you do, if you're purposely being a dick, you're going to be seeing the door soon. Horde has had a a small mis-information campaign set against them about how toxic and unclassy it is/will be, but speaking from personal experience, if you're on Horde comms and Horde IRC, you don't really ever see unclassy behavior from PL/Waffle members, and when they start trying to toe the line, Directors and CEO are extremely quick to shut them down or ask them to leave. This post from Grath sums up how PL members are expected to act around Horde quite nicely: https://i.imgur.com/FayhtDF.png . I'm not going to pretend that PL proper isn't a very crude culture, but if you stay in Horde you never see it. Meanwhile from my couple of experiences in Brave post TEST leaving HERO, Brave seems to be very much the same be-as-unclassy-as-you-want-aslong-as-you-don't-use-these-couple-words culture as it used to be.\n\nI said I don't know where to begin with the stay classy mantra, but I'm legitimately at a loss of words on how to respond on to the ethical leadership point after we're still daily seeing more and more drama from the failed overnight backhand coup of the Alliance exec. I guess from the outside I'm not entirely sure I understand why everyone seems to love Lychton again after it was almost unanimously agreed that he's not entirely best for the position. I think to me it was very telling that when he learned about the coup, he mentioned that he didn't even know how game mechanics work that make it possible, which seems a bit absurd to me that the guy who doesn't know how to stop a coup ingame is touted as the one best suited to be in such a position. This is merely my personal opinion, but I've always found Lychton as someone who really genuinely likes to help newbies and has a very big personality, but whose qualifications completely end there. To me this kinda comes across as a \"I want Lychton because he seems like a great person to have a beer with\", but to translate it to real life briefly, I would never vote for someone because I want to have a beer with them; I would have a beer with them, and then immediately vote for someone who appears to actually know that they're doing, and isn't so consistently drunk that he's completely blind to what's going on, and over half the ceos can have secret meetings while he's drunk/hungover. Further, if I recall correctly, one of the main arguments against Lychton was that he /wasn't/ active in his duty, and that he /wasn't/ playing the game, which when that's literally his only qualifications for being in the position in the first place, I don't find it particularly shocking that c o u p b o i s occurred. Those who love Lychton as their leader are fine and all, but I think you'd be very hard pressed to make the argument that Lychton is better at his role of leading an alliance with a strong new player focus than Sappo/Migui/Mittani/etc are and have been. A lot of people are simply drawn to strong leadership, and to me, Lychton doesn't exude competancy as much as others before him have (and maybe that's in small part because of the cripplingly slow and relatively ineffective middle management space democracy Brave has).\n\nTo me, Brave has great brand-ability and new players are very drawn to the \"Brave Newbies\" name and it sounds like a perfect place for all new players, but from someone who's seen the new player experience from many different programs, Brave is actually one of the last groups I would recommend a friend to try out EVE in for the first time, only above the atrocity of E-Uni.", "gilded": 2, "created_utc": "1429641487", "subreddit": "Bravenewbies", "score": 51, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Congratulations, you successfully played the carry role. The carry player has lots of things to worry about, and I'll do my best to answer your questions.\n\nWhen you are building items, you need to ask yourself two questions. What do I need to keep my farm up? And what do I need to survive from the enemies on the map?\n\nSo lets look at the enemy line up. They've got a tide, a qop, a kotl, bristleback and morphling. Bristleback is all physical damage and terrorblade has ridiculous agility gain and base armor, so probably the only item he should force you to get is a magic stick.\n\nQoP rushes an orchid and has a lot of magic damage. You're going to need to hp against this hero, and a manta or bkb to deal with the orchid.\n\nEblade rushing morphlings can be scary with timely ethereals, but can be negated completely if you are tanky enough by the time he gets it. Keep an eye on his item progression.\n\nFinally KotL is a fuck ton of aoe magic damage that shits on illusions, so you're going to need those bad boys really tanky before you can split push using illusions.\n\nFinally tidehunter should force you to consider a BkB, especially if he's farming well. A refresher tide can fuck you up real bad, but is completely negated by BkB.\n\nHowever you can find yourself playing games of DotA and be like, this tidehunter is really not impactful at all, I can probably skip a BkB, or this KotL is really kicking my ass, I should keep farming the jungle and buy items to help me farm the jungle.\n\nThe best thing you can do to for yourself as a carry player is to be patient and wait for your items. Don't fight if you know it's not favorable. If QoP has an orchid, wait til you have a manta, and then fight. If tide has refresher, wait til BkB. If morphling has a butterfly, wait til MkB, etc. Through this process, you should be keeping up a split push, and if the enemy groups up, immediately commit to the tower until they teleport back. When your enemy teleports to defend the tower, TP to the tower they were pushing and fight them 4v5! Or just keep split pushing because they all backed up too. Farm farm farm.\n\nWait as long as you can. Wait until they are knocking at your tier 3s if you have to. Terrorblade takes A L O T of farm to do what he needs to do, and if your teammates don't respect that, it's a gap of knowledge between you and them, and you can care to explain your decision making or mute them from your life forever.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429643868", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Triads are what chords are -  you use the 1st, 3rd and 5th degree (or note) of the major scale to make the chord. The major scale has intervals - the distance **between** the notes - of  W W H W W W H where W is a whole tone - 2 frets - and H is a half tone - 1 fret. Memorising the sequence of intervals makes it easier to work out the scale of any key. So, for the A major scale it looks like:\n\n    Degree:   1  2  3   4  5  6   7   8\n    Note:     A  B  C#  D  E  F#  G#  A\n    Interval:   W  W   H  W  W   W   H\n\nThe 1-3-5 of the scale is A C# E, aka the A major triad aka the A major chord. All major chords aare the 1-3-5 of their respective scales. If you look at the little diagram above, you'll see that 1-3-5 is the same as add one note, skip the next, add the next, skip the next, add the next.\n\nWhere it comes in handy for you to build creativity is in something called diatonic chord theory. What this does is give you all the chords that will harmonise within a key. It's simple enough once you get your head around it, but you have to really be familiar with the major scale and the 1-3-5 basis of chords.\n\nHow it works is you basically do 1-3-5 from *each degree* of a scale using the notes of that scale. Using the above diagram, we are playing in A major. You do the 1-3-5 and find the triad of A. \n\nThen starting from each degree, do the 1-3-5 to find the harmonising triads. So to find out which II chord will harmonise - start with B, skip one, add D, skip one, add F#. You get B D F#, find them on the guitar and you'll see it's a Bm chord.\n\nThe 3rd note of the scale is C#, so start with C# and do the 1-3-5: skip one, add E, skip one, add G#. C# E G# = C# minor. 4th note is D, do the 1-3-5 from D and you get D F# A - D major. And so on. Do this to each of the 7 notes of the scale and you'll get 7 different chords that will harmonise with the key you are playing in.\n\nA great and creative example of this is a song called [Althea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7lMxNfb7rw) by the Grateful Dead. It's in A major and uses the diatonic theory to find the chords that harmonise. Even if you aren't a fan of this music, it's worth finding the chords and strumming along to see diatonic theory in action. It's in A, but the main progression starts with a Bm chord - that's where you can get creative. You don't have to start with the first chord, start with any of them and you'll know you have 6 more chords to experiment with that are going to harmonise.\n\nThe more you play around with it, the more you'll see it everywhere.

{"body": "So to clarify caching:\n\nIt only applies to what would normally be STREAMED music.  I'll use my current use case as an example:\n\nI have all of Cake's albums digitally owned outside of streaming content.  I have them stored on my Google account, and so it doesn't HAVE to be on my phone itself.  I can choose to \"stream\" it, or I can \"cache\" it.\n\nNormal streaming is just normal streaming.  If I CACHE the music, over wifi naturally, it downloads a copy of the song.  I believe you can set the \"quality\" of the audio file that is downloaded, but I dunno about specific codecs.  \n\nWhen the song is \"cached\", it remains indefinitely **while you pay for the service.**  I've had my Cake albums cached for about a year now, never had to mess with it.\n\nYou can cache and uncache things whenever you want, up to a limit (either based on the streaming service, or the physical space on your phone)\n\nI believe when you talk about \"hard wire caching\", you're talking about transferring them via cable, AKA \"drag 'n' drop\".  That wouldn't apply to streaming music unless you bought/downloaded it yourself and own digital copies of the music.\n\nIf you wanted to cache 3200 songs you could, if you can store it all on the phone.  Pick all the albums, and you check \"cache at next opportunity\".  When you next connect to wifi, it begins caching them.  So you could set it up to go overnight before your flight, and wake up to having it all cached.  Then if you want to take it off for room for photos, you uncache it, and it disappears back up into the cloud (c l o u d  to Butt extension people loved that one I bet)\n\nFor something like Google Music, which I use, I can also buy songs that I've streamed/cached.  They will exist on my own personal library, and I can download copies for my laptops/phones/whatever, and they will always be available to me, even if I stop paying for the Google Music streaming service.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429672786", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Peter wished so much that he could be normal! \n\nFinally his father gave in and allowed him to go to school with his friends. Peter was loving every minute of it. There had been incidents of course, and his father very nearly pulled him out of school several times. This bee was going to be his last chance to prove himself.

The crowd quieted as she began to speak. “Hello, thank you all for coming. It's my pleasure to welcome you to the 2015 Annual Northview Elementary Spelling Bee.

Can you please come up to the microphone young man?”\n\nPeter bounced out of his seat and practically leaped up to the microphone, earning a chuckle from the audience.

{"body": "I can't speak too much for jungle as Tiger Udyr's route and habits simply because I don't play it, but maxing turtle after tiger is good, however if you're gank heavy (which you should be on Tiger stance) then you should put a couple extra points into bear early on. Q W Q E Q E Q or something like that. The extra movespeed is invaluable on Udyr, which brings me to my next point. \n\nTrinity force is usually much better on Udyr because of a few reasons but depending on your build and playstyle IBG can be better. Udyr excels with movement speed, it is the single best stat on him imo. Movespeed helps him dodge skillshots, escape 5 man ganks, chase down enemies, and all around be a monster. The extra AD on trinity is good, and the passive does more damage to priority targets than IBG's. The chance to crit is negligible but it can and will save you or get you a kill that you wouldn't have gotten otherwise at least once per game. The phage movespeed is again much better than the slow from IBG. Assuming you have red buff then the IBG slow won't do very much, due to diminishing returns, making it kind of meh. Also the cooldown reduction gets wasted from IBG if you run the standard build of Spirit Visage and Frozen Heart with CDR masteries and runes. It's ultimately preference, but unless you're playing a 100% support/tank Udyr then I would strongly recommend Trinity Force, especially if you play as Phoenix Udyr (delicious attack speed).\n\nMuramana's active is really the only reason I think it's a good item on top lane Udyr (tiger only, don't get it on phoenix). The way I play him I usually steal the enemy blue buff anyway and build both Frozen Heart and Trinity Force so mana isn't an issue. Tiger Udyr top should also get Trinity force in all cases because of how *damn* good all of the stats synergize with his kit. Blade of the Ruined King is really good on him but Ravenous Hydra is my preference on Tiger Top if they don't have an ubertank (Sion, Mundo, Shyv, etc.) because of how well your Q scales with bonus AD and the active gives you the waveclear you lack if you don't max phoenix stance first.\n\nI hope I was at least a little bit helpful, if you have any more questions then please feel free to ask!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429692505", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It seems to me like one can just separate the entity of the word into two things: One is the meaning of the word, and the other is the word itself as a... \"physical\" thing.  The meaning of the word \"wee\" is something small.  The word \"wee\" itself, physically, is a collection of three letters \"w,\" \"e,\" and \"e,\" in that order.  So an autological word is, I would define, a word where you can use the meaning of the word to describe its \"physical\" entity.  If I'm allowed to make this distinction, let's try to apply it to the word \"heterological.\"  The meaning of the word (using my definition of autological above) is \"a word that cannot use its dictionary meaning to describe its physical entity.\"  I don't think that meaning - \"a word that cannot use its dictionary meaning to describe its physical entity\" - can be used to describe the physical collection of letters \"h e t e r o l o g i c a l\".  It's just a bunch of letters (yes, I'm avoiding calling it a word with a meaning).  We could say whether it's a long or short bunch of letters, has some syllables, starts with a certain letter, ends with a certain letter, has a certain number of vowels, or consonants, or rhymes with something, etc., but its \"physical\" entity, separated from its meaning, can't be described with the dictionary meaning of heterological.  \n\nSo, the list of lists thing... basically, in this case, I need to try to claim to separate lists and lists of lists.  So lists contain articles.  The important distinction here that I need to claim is that lists can claim articles and only articles.  Lists of lists CANNOT contain articles.  Lists of lists can only contain lists.  I suppose what I'm reaching for is that with more \"precise\" definitions and categories of what things are, the paradox can be avoided... or sidestepped, at least.  There are articles, there are lists of articles, and there are lists of lists of articles.  And that's all.  The key is not to just say \"lists.\"  Lists need to be lists of some specific type of thing.  We can't have a list that goes like: Article about Don Knots, Article about Don Nix, an apple, 5.2, my ass, Article about Emperor Konin, etc.  Like, that doesn't make sense.  For lists, let's limit ourselves to lists of articles.  Thus, a list of all lists of articles cannot contain a list of list of articles.  A list of all lists of articles can only contain lists of articles.  \n\nI couldn't be bothered to read the solutions... but I wonder if what I said above is in there.  Basically, define what exactly can be in a set, and then later you probably won't have to try to include the set in itself, because come on, that's just asking for trouble.

The way you do it can be confusing for people to listen to and it took me 3 playbacks of that section in order to fully write down the sequence. \n\nWhen you talk about item builds, I have to disagree with you on rushing sorc shoes + void staff. Sure, early mag pen from the sorc shoes is good early game, but often rushing tier 2 boots is not the best idea. Getting tier 1 boots and sitting on that for a while as you can a few other items is a lot more popular. The gold you would have spent on upgrading the boots could have been used to get something like a blasting wand if you save up just a bit more, which is quite a bit more damage.\n\nAs for the void staff first item, this is just wrong. Void staff offers % mag pen not flat mag pen. This means this item is only effective when the enemy has a substantial amount of MR. Early game, rarely anyone will have rushed enough MR to warrant getting a void staff first. This is like an ADC rushing a last whisper, clearly not the best option. Other items which provide a larger flat ap or a more beneficial effect like abyssal, deathcap, or even ludens echo might be better alternatives to a void staff as a FIRST ITEM. I would mention that as an ap mid, he tends to have a lot of mana problems as his only damage source is from spells. Items like morellos or chalice would be good to consider for secondary items. \n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429724340", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Yep, start at the major scale. There is only one major scale, but it can be played in 12 differnt  keys. All of them all apply the same idea, though - don't learn \"positions\" of the major scale, learn the idea behind it.\n\nThe idea is that it is just a sequence of the intervals -  t t s t t t s  where t is a whole tone (2 frets) and s is a semi tone (1fret) - memorise this and you'l be able to play it in any key and any position. The intervals go between each note, so from the first note go up 2 frets (t) to the next note, another 2 frets (t) to the 3rd note, one fret (s) to the 4th note etc. All scales are just different sequeces of intervals. The actual notes you play chage in different keys, but the intervals are always the same - A major and C# major have the same intervals.\n\nWhen you get your head around it, start to experiment with it such as using it to move from one chord to another (Eg playing in G, want to go to a D chord? Use the G major scale to create a walking bassline or melody line to get to D). You'll find some cool things you can do with it, and places on the guitar where it sounds awesome.\n\nChord theory is pretty simple: a major chord is the 1st 3rd and 5th of the relative major scale. That's called the triad. On a guitar you just play these 3 notes  on different strings, usually doubling up on the 1st or 5th - an E chord in open position has 3 E's, 2 B's and 1 G# in it; a D has 2 Ds and one each of the other two. Again use the theory to find new chord shapes for the chords you like playing, then you can use the major scale to make melodies going from one shape to the other. \n\n\nIf you learn the scale by position alone you won't do this experimentation, but it's the experimentatin that is going to unlock your creativity. Finger picking is pretty much finding new ways to do old things and the only way to find them is to go looking for them. The experimentation also teaches you how the notes sound in relation to each other - by working out where a third note is from the root note by yourself rather than looking at a tab, you'll start to remember the interval between the notes by sound alone. Music is only ever about the sound, and you are never too inexperienced to start paying attention to it. \n\nYou'll start to be able to make up some decent sounding mellow pieces - eg. hit the open low E with your thumb to make a steady bass and on the 3 treble strings, starting from the open E chord, try to work out ways you can stay in the E major scale and go from one E chord to another E chord. You'll work out which of the notes create the tension and which ones resolve it -  not to mention start getting pretty good with your ear. Be sure to experiment with different keys -  each practise session start with a random key and using chord theory on the scale find a few chord shapes, then finger pick your way to them using the scale.\n\nDiatonic theroy takes it up a notch and shows you how to work out what other chords are going to harmonise with the key you are in. You need a good grasp of the major scale and chord theory to understand it, it makes no sense without knowing chord theory, but is simple when you know it. So spend a month or so noodling around with the major scale, have a read up on chord theory then take a look a diatonic theory when you are getting confident you are undering the major scale.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429738166", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt;Still getting this game, but the combo's are nowhere even near Dragon Ball Advanced Adventure level.

{"body": "I'm not sure exactly what you need help with specifically from your post, but hopefully this will help:\n\nYou already know the orders of the sharps and flats. This means that when you're reading sheet music and you see some sharps or flats in the key signature, they are *always* going to be in that order.\n\nIf there are 2 sharps, they will always be F and C. If there are 5 sharps, they will always be F C G D A. Every F, C, G, etc that you see in this music will be sharp, unless otherwise noted with a natural sign: ♮\n\nThe circle of fifths is not that complicated. You just need to know a few things first:\n\n* A half-step is the distance between one note on the piano and the very next note directly next to it. This means F to F#, B to C, D to Db, E to F, etc. \n* An interval of a fifth is 7 half-steps.\n* With each movement of a fifth on the circle, we add one sharp or one flat (depending on which direction we're going in).\n\nSo. The circle of fifths is how you can know what major or minor key corresponds with the key signature. The circle starts with C at the top. C major has a key signature of 0 sharps, 0 flats. Now go up 7 half-steps, and you get to G. We add one sharp. G major has a key signature of one sharp, which is F sharp.\n\nGo up another 7 half-steps. D major. Add another sharp. Two sharps: F sharp and C sharp.\n\nGo up another 7 half steps. What major key is it? How many sharps? Which sharps are they?\n\nFor flats, let's start back at C at the top. Now count 7 half-steps *down* from C. You're on F. F major has one flat: B flat.\n\nGo down another 7 half-steps. Now you're on B flat. Add another flat. Two flats: B flat and E flat.\n\nYou can keep going until you get to 7 flats in that direction, and in the other direction starting from C, 7 sharps. Those are all the major keys.\n\nIs this helpful?

{"body": "What's really at the bottom of it is the importance of the fifth, the musical interval of 7 half steps. \n\nThere are two ways to think about this. First, just as a musical interval, it corresponds to a frequency ratio of 3/2. An octave is the frequency ratio 2/1. These are like the simplest fractions around, so they are the most important, most harmonious, intervals. That's why the fifth is such an important interval.\n\nNext comes the way that scales are constructed in conventional music. Why are the white and black keys arranged the way they are on a piano? Why is a major scale W W H W W W H - Whole and Half steps in that pattern? \n\nThere isn't one exact answer but you can think of a major scale in another way. Instead of C D E F G A B you can think of it as F C G D A E B - i.e. as 6 steps all the same size, the interval of a fifth.\n\nNext, look at modulation. The most common key change is just to move up or down by a fifth, e.g. from C to G. This changes the scale from F C G D A E B to C G D A E B F#. You just take one note off at the start of the sequence, and add a new note on at the end. Or you can move the other way, from F C G D A E B to Bb F C G E A E. \n\nYou can think about an infinite sequence where each note has neighboring notes a fifth down and a fifth up - the sequence can go out to infinity in either direction. \n\nThe thing is, it gets mighty inconvenient to work with an infinite number of notes! So you can fudge a little bit and make e.g. Bb = A#. Exactly how to budge all the exact frequencies to make the fudge more inconspicuous, that is a subject of endless debate. But anyway, that converts the sequence that runs out infinitely far in either direction, to a circle. You can still move infinitely far in either direction, but you don't keep hitting new pitches every time, but start returning to pitches you hit before. \n\nIt is quite possible to construct scales on other principles where the circle of fifths doesn't really appear, e.g. http://interdependentscience.blogspot.com/2015/02/hanson-11.html", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429814326", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Having a skywrath in your line up can help you tremendously and his ult synergises really well with your stun.\n\nGames that went well my item progression went to Blink or Hex and we'd win the game before I was even close to getting 6 slotted.\n\nGames that went badly were usually games where we lacked damage, in this instance I would buy items that boost stats and morph to Agility and try to fight.

And those flats look like two Bs -- so b b?\n\nIn any case, the reason a flat looks like a B is because it is in fact based on that letter. I'm not absolutely positive on everything I'm about to say, but here it goes:\n\nThe history goes back to at least the Guidonian Hexachord system, in which there were three Hexachords: the natural (beginning on C), the soft (beginning on F), and the hard (beginning on G). Each of these 6-note collections are different by one pitch: B. The natural excludes B (C D E F G A); the soft contains a B-flat (F G A Bb C D); and the hard contains a B-natural (G A B C D E).\n\nThe soft hexachord is so named after the shape of the soft B -- round; that is, a B-flat, merely a half-step above A. The soft B is where we get our flat symbol: ♭. The hard B, on the hand, was used to represent the \"other\" B that was a whole-step above A; that is, B-natural was represented by a \"hard\" square-shaped B -- which is where we get our natural sign, and eventually the sharp sign: ♮ (although the original would not have had that bottom line sticking out).\n\nThis was the system used before accidentals and the 12 pitches were understood. See also: *musica ficta*\n\nSo, yes and no. It looks like two Bs because they evolved from the letter B itself, but there is no special meaning in that it is two Bs side-by-side.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429908348", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 13, "controversiality": 0}

Anyone who speaks poorly of you is a heretic, and anyone who agrees is a great person.\n\nI know you read this, and I want you to know that you are a shitty company with incredible anti-trust policies. You are personally a shoddy hack with a degree. Your statistics are misleading, and you pull conclusions before you even have the data. It's fucking embarrassing that a guy with a PhD is sitting on forums posting chat logs to prove how good your system is. This is the equivalent of a HR officer posting someone's warning history on Facebook.\n\nInstead of \"trying\" to get better, maybe a better idea would be to stop fucking around and actually deliver on your initial promises before making new ones. When 90% of the things that your cult cannot manage to do are done by third-parties, there really does have to be a time when you have to blame yourself.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go open Baron Replays to watch an old game, then I'll crack open LSI for in-depth statistics on my ranked history. After that I'll go play a game and post the Curse Voice link in the lobby so we can voice chat. When I'm done, I'll go download a fixed version of your skin from LeagueCraft, then I'll use LoLChat to show my friend a screenshot from my phone. Before I go to bed, I'll hit up the forums and have someone make me a chroma, then I'll finish up by going to op.gg to check a friend's profile without getting kicked back to my own.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429912590", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 4, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Heya, long time WC3 Dota player too! The new UI really has a lot of changes, but most of them are quality of life changes that you MUST learn to make full use and be on par with everyone else in terms of convenience. One thing I realised was that in WC3 Dota we were limiting ourselves from getting better because things like using the courier and buying items quick and typing to teammates required concentration; now everything is very streamlined (ALT Click everything!!) and we can improve on hero skill without getting impaired by a bad UI. \n\n1. Get used to qwer as your new hotkeys. As tempting as it might be to use legacy bindings, using qwer frees and fixes so many buttons for item casting and skill point adding etc. My item cast hotkeys are D F G B T V. My skills are qwer45. \n\n2. Colours are mostly similar, but you should make use of hero faces on the minimap for maximum information.\n\n3. Use shift click in game to set items in your quickbuy, and set a hotkey to buy items in your quickbuy just before you die to minimize the gold you lose. My quickbuy is alt 3. My courier delivery and speed boost is alt 1 and alt 2. When I want a delivery I just roll my fingers over alt 12 and that's it.\n\n4. Alt Click is your friend. Alt click everything in this game for different bits of useful information. You'll be surprised at what you find. You can even communicate exclusively through alt clicks and pings and crosses. Tips: alt click the clock when roshan dies for a timestamp. Alt click glyph to say it's available. Ctrl alt click glyph to say don't use it! Ctrl alt click the floor for an X.\n\nTldr: learn to use the new convenient features so that you can concentrate on your own personal skills\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429935164", "subreddit": "learndota2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "WHERE DID I SAY THEY WERE LUCK? All I said is that headshots are subjectively reliable, and as such **I** personally don't do as well with them. \n\nAND EVENTUALLY YOU WILL MISS A HEADSHOT due to innately smaller hitboxes and the fact that players are not in fact perfect aimbots.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nwell, st least you tried to calculate fo the imperfect scenario, however while the amby has a higher POTENTIAL damage headshots (particularly against people who can actually play the game) do not come as often as 4/6 shots fired (in combat) unless you are the absolute best amby player ever or you are sitting quite a ways away and sniping. \n\nEVEN THEN, the intended use for each weapon is vastly diffrent, and each is suited better for something. While the amby is better for dealing great burst damage at a range and can be used to pick slightly less injured opponents due to crits and no falloff so it can be used for more long range picks, but is less useful in a paniky situation when they spy is discovered and cant cloak away. The revolver is almost inverse to this because the intended use was a last resort weapon that had could be used to great effect in situations where the users aim would be thrown off by pursuers. The use is quite radically different and each lends itself to different playstyles that is almost useless to try and compare them except on that battlefield itself; for all the theory crafting in the world, some things just have to be tested.\n\nAlso, you have been measuring in damage per clip which is only relevant if one has their revolver out for a victim who is recieving medical attention or heavies under very certain conditions. A more accurate test would be a dps measurement as it is *technically* more applicable to combat. (unless it is multiple people on the spy, but then the spy SHOULD die for negligence)\n\nAs for source hitboxes, look it up on youtube; there are vids where it got so bugged that snipers who stood still were shot repeatedly in the head from point blank with no result. It can and will eventually screw you over.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nas for your end bit, yes the stock is more consistent, though pestery is not what I would use for correct use as a backup instead of a primary. And I am pretty sure I said it was subjective as to who is doing the shooting...\n\n&gt;As reliability is based on how consistently something happens, for something like headshots it is very subjective to who is doing the shooting...\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nHAH, 90% dmg resistance , no matter how much it falls off, will always lend itself to be an easy mode get out of jail free card when the spy done F*CKED up ^1 . That half sec. delay will only screw the spy over in extremely high burst damage situations ^2. And if you are regularly screwed over by missing a stab then there is probably something wrong with your movement as a decent spy should/would probably be able to get away with stock or CnD just fine ^3.  Also, if you run into death post stab, look at how you approach the situation, do you just run in guns ^4 blazing? or do you look at things tactically and get screwed over by that pyro that came from L I T E R A L L Y N O W H E R E? Each of those has (usually) a preventable cause ^5\n\nAs I see it the DR in a crutch for spies who can't figure out the nuances of correct movement and/or invis juking, the situations they get themselves into but not out of, or they second snipers behind the lines ^6. Quite simply it teaches bad habits to new or learning spies by saying ' Hey there, you can get out of any situation free' instead of punishing them (with death) for going into situations that will inevitably get the offending spy killed no matter how good he/she is. THIS is why the DR is a bad thing, it hold spies back. The frustrated spy sees that extra protection and uses it so much they rely upon it to do all of the hard work for them thus stopping them from ever learning how to correctly use the stock ^7 and then branch out from there. For the DR vet they try reckless and stupid things (usually) when they try the invis out again and remember why they used DR so much. HOWEVER, I am not saying I hate the weapon as it does have applications as a stealth option ^8, and to a (stealth) trained hand it can be most devastating when the spy becomes unkillable because lel 90% dmg resistance ^9\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nside notes that should be read in the context.\n\n^1 and should rightly die for such things\n\n^2  eg. a pre revved heavy or a sticky-trap\n\n^3 assuming  he didn't run for the first target he sees like an idiot OR he got a medic pick and traded a spy life for a medic life\n\n^4 metaphorically or literally\n\n^5 lest it is one of those pyros that insist on running to the most random places\n\n^6 Not spy's intended job, though surprisingly effective\n\n^7 as the stock teaches everything a spy *needs* to know for CnD and DR\n\n^8 though much unappreciated applications\n\n^9 for perspective a DR spy can take up to 4 backstabs while DR cloaked; this is equal to 6X the spy's current health in damage each backstab, source: experience as the backstabber", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1429968985", "subreddit": "tf2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Picked up a **Vita** Monday and have played nothing but it (aside from experimenting with Dark Souls on my laptop to much failure).\n\n**Persona 4 Golden**\n\nI had vanilla P4 as a digital download and played up to the Contrarian King optional boss. Most of my gametime for it has been catching up to that section. I'm really close now! Just waiting for story events.\n\nIt feels and looks a lot better than vanilla P4, though I'm unhappy about how easier it seems. It took around 5-6 hours total to reach Shadow Yukiko with time spent grinding. Meanwhile in under 3 hours I reached her and was 5 levels higher than I was in the original. And I only visited her castle three times - the mandated story sequence, and two times on my own. The second time I almost made it to the end before I decided I'd lost enough HP &amp; SP and didn't want to use consumables.\n\nMaybe it's just cause I know the weaknesses of enemies and basic Persona/SMT strategies? I dunno, but I'm hoping it starts getting harder soon.\n\nI don't like Marie thus far either. I'm sure there's a good reason for her existing now but she seems kinda shoehorned in so far and her personality is the most nothing thing in the game so far.\n\nI'm confused by skill cards. I might have skipped past an explanation by accident. I can buy and sell them but I don't know how to use them. Are they just in the Items menu and I missed them because I'm blind?\n\nI also really expected Dojima's voice to be his P4 comic version because I've seen that so many times.\n\nAnd [Orobas is the most fabulous Persona.](http://i.imgur.com/M6YFRfr.jpg)\n\n\n**Freedom Wars**\n\nSome people over in the Suggestions thread last week suggested I get Soul Sacrifice Delta over this but I didn't really like the Delta demo and I found this for $15 at WalMart so I picked it up.\n\nPretty much Monster Hunter: Dystopian Scifi Edition. I like it more than MH so far, tbh. Something about it is clicking a lot more than MH - possibly the setting.\n\nIt has some cool gameplay elements like the thorn. The thorn is basically a grappling hook that lets you traverse the battlefield and topple the Abductor mecha that you fight. Though I kinda forget it exists sometimes and I just try to evade with the dodge roll and running.\n\n**Gravity Rush**\n\nHonestly haven't played much of this, the other three games I bought have interested me more. The basic gimmick is cool, though it took a few times to register how it worked during the tutorial sequence.\n\nThe setting took me way off guard. I expected like... modern-day and instead I got a French steampunk floating city. Which is way more interesting than modern-day!\n\nIt's also the only Vita game I have without the cover which bugs me more than it should.\n\n**Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Battle Pentagram**\n\nThis is an import tie-in to one of my favorite anime. I had to pick it up because I've wanted to play a game with this premise since I saw the show.\n\nThe show is essentially Sailor Moon: The Bad Ending. Five magical girls fight monsters known as Witches and Familiars, and proceed to discover that being a magical girl sucks. That's all you need to know, and all that can be said without spoilers.\n\nThe basic premise is that during the day, you watch visual novel scenes of the five main characters. During the night you control one of them and select a partner to assist you to fight monsters.\n\nUnfortunately it's all in Japanese (aside from the stats). Fortunately, I can hold X and skip all the dialogue I don't understand and get to the fights.\n\nThe fights are simplistic - Square is your special Magic attack (you can hold three Magic attacks and swap them with left/right on Dpad), Triangle is basic melee, Circle is Dash/Dodge, and X is jump. L Trigger is Lock-on/off, and R trigger can be held to allow you to Block (R+Circle), Partner Strike (R+Triangle), or Combination Special (R+Square+Certain Relationship Level).\n\nThen there's stuff like Forward+Melee, Air Forward+Melee, Run+Melee, Dodge+Melee, Air Dodge+Melee... Surprising amounts of tech, imo.\n\nAlso yeah, you heard right: This game has Social Links! Each day the girls group up and you can listen in on their talks, which builds their friendship. Pairing girls on night battles raises their friendship higher, however. Nice way to make sure you keep switching characters during the dungeon crawls.\n\nIt seems like every three nights falls into a distinct pattern: Night 1: Dungeon crawl; Night 2: Dungeon crawl to fight miniboss; Night 3: Dungeon crawl to fight a Witch. All these nights have a time limit which can get hairy, and the Witches have all been fairly challenging (though less so once the trash mobs it spawns are dealt with, which is an annoyance but a canonical one so I can't particularly fault it).\n\nI say dungeon crawl, but they're just linear levels split into a few separate floors for the most part. Some change things up (including one annoying one that had a switch that had no cutscene introduction *unlike literally every other switch thus far*.)\n\nEach of the five girls has a unique fighting style. The titular Madoka fights with a bow and (magic) arrow, and her melee is whacking enemies with the bow. Homura fights with all guns (thus far she's my favorite to play as due to how cuhrayzee her moveset is. Her Air Forward+Melee is summoning a tanker truck to ram enemies after all). Mami also fights with all guns, though she uses muskets and has a special binding ability. Sayaka fights with swords and her Air Forward+Melee is literally Stinger from DMC. Kyoko fights with a spear and can summon copies of herself for crowd control.\n\nIf you're downed in combat, no worries. You can spend 3 revival points to resurrect yourself, or wait for your braindead partner to realize something happened and revive you for 1 point. That is if they don't get knocked off the stage to their death first. Luckily the game respawns them (unconscious) near where they fell off if that happens.\n\nThere's Five stats: Strength, Magic, Vitality, Constitution (I assume, it just says \"CON\" in game), and Agility. Each character has certain stat spreads (ie, Madoka is great at Magic, less so at Strength; Kyoko is great at Strength, less so at Magic etc). I still have yet to figure out was Constitution controls. I assume it's Defense but I can't read moonrunes.\n\nThere's also a skill system in the game but I have no clue what any of them do and I'm too lazy to reach over to grab my phone and fight the crappy Google Translate app to find out what they do, haha.\n\nBig downside is certain moves (like Homura's spinning Forward+Melee) kills the framerate.\n\nThe game is cool and fun and I would recommend it **IF** you love the anime. If you aren't, you probably should pass as it's a definite niche and the basic gameplay is smoother and funner in other games.\n\nWow I spent more words on a niche anime game than everything else. \n\n**P R I O R I T I E S**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430013145", "subreddit": "Games", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

You don't need turtle. Priority is now shifted to outputting as much damage as possible while also cc and staying in aa range. With the most recent phoenix proc, you want to auto 3 more times to get the second one all the while walking with the fleeing opponent.\n\n6. After the second proc of phoenix, switch to bear and continue to auto until stun goes off. \n\n7.

You're pretty mana gated as Udyr and can get along ganking and farming with levels in r and w fine. It can be a nice boost of damage in skirmishes though.\n\nW is the bread and butter of Udyr. It's what makes him so strong. You get a ~200 hp shield every few seconds that's augmented by resistances. Don't trade it up for other skills.\n\nTrailblazer seems to be the best but you can run the blue and red jungle items as well. \n\nDon't feel the need to build triforce. It's a fantastic item on him but can be a gold sink. If your team has enough damage, go straight tank. Don't be quick to dismiss the effectiveness of Aegis and Righteous Glory (primarily the latter). For reference, I think I've honestly build triforce once in my hundred or so games on Udyr this season.\n\nI usually go R W R E then max R W E while getting a level in q at level 14 or so.

Good guy beats bad guy or good guy beats bad guy and saves the princess. This game always had me wondering who these non-spirits were and if any one of them was going to betray me. The story was more than just good guy beats bad guy. It's about a spirit trying to escape from the very power that they have. It's about wanting to protect those who would be used and thrown away. It's about making friendships, breaking trusts, questioning the purpose behind existing (in a way) and the right to exist.\n\nOh and don't get me started on the voice acting. Liam O Brien, the lord of all voices, that man has a wondrous voice. His voice can be dripping with lies, it can filled with disgust, it can be devious while holding a friendly tone. The other voice actors in the game were no slackers either and even those who only voiced characters strictly for the battle and nothing else did fantastic jobs.\n\nThe music and settings were wonderfully designed too (but we're talking about Tri Ace here!) The scenery in the towns was stupendous in every way in its art style. It gave a 3D effect in the game that, to me, was not present in any other game before. \n\nGameplay was interesting as varying strategies could be created for every situation and no one felt over powered to the extent where you could make a party of A B C D and kill everything in your path. Also rather than having a limit break system, you had to get enough hits in order to trigger the special attacks, which means you had to pick what TYPES of attacks your characters had with caution. You also then had to use those attacks with the others to get the maximum damage and hits in (that's to discourage button mashing and more thought on who has the knock backs, knock ups, stuns, etc.)\n\nIn order to really understand the game, like the others listed, people just have to play the games. It's much easier to experience than to read and try to experience from a bunch of words. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430099287", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I'm pretty sure the teachers were just sick of it. \n* No slap bracelets. Because they were 'dangerous'. Even the cheap plastic ones. \n* If you are right handed, you cannot write with your left even if you are perfectly capable of doing so.

No exceptions. \n* One of my teachers knocked my reading level down because I refused to read the boring ass books that were on The List Of Appropriate Books For Reading Levels, but chose alternates. \n\nH I G H | S C H O O L\n\n* Hall checks: A period of time where the teachers would all lock their doors and anyone caught outside without a pass would get after-school suspension. I got one of these because I was sick and had to rush to the bathroom to puke. Despite smelling like vomit, I was given an after-school suspension. \n* You cannot opt out of lunch unless you had a good reason signed by both your parent/guardian and doctor. Same goes for study halls (minus the doctor)\n* Mandatory lessons during homeroom . . . which was between second and third period. \n* No food/drinks in classes. \n* Cannot wear windbreaker pants unless you also wore the matching jacket because the pants were baggy enough to smuggle in weapons. My band instructor joked: 'so if you want to smuggle in an AK47, make sure you don't mix patterns.' (my band instructor dngaf)\n* The floor numbers were, top to bottom: 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, Gym level, 1A, 1B, Lower level, and catacombs. \n* Could not wear an outfit entirely of 1 color because then you've accidentally joined a gang or something (Banana Boys represent!). Clashed with the windbreaker issue above.\n* Boys could not wear jewelry including class rings.\n* Temporarily banned those red Aids Awareness ribbons because someone saw it and thought it was a gang thing. The teachers mostly knew that it wasn't gang affiliated but the principal and co. gave detentions to anyone wearing them. This only lasted a day until one of the teachers got through to somebody. \n* Pep rallies were mandatory\n* AP classes were renamed so as not to make those who couldn't get into AP classes feel bad. Example: AP English was renamed British English. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430118571", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This went on for years and he was the last celeb that I thought would ever get their act together.  \n\nSome of his antics:\n\nin 1996 he was arrested for speeding down Ventura boulevard while throwing “imaginary rats” out the window. Upon pulling him over police discovered the the charming actor was high on coke. They also discovered that he had coke, h e r o i n e and a handgun in his car.  A month later, while on parole, he wandered into a neighbor's Malibu home that he thought was his own, and fell asleep in their child's bed. He was arrested for being under the influence of drugs, which was a third violation of his probation.\n\n25 Nov 2000, Latest reports suggest security at the MERV GRIFFIN RESORT, in Palm Springs, California, where the actor was relaxing, alerted Downey Jr that police were on their way after a tip off by an anonymous caller. The actor was alone when the police arrived but a limousine was waiting to take himself and his lady friend to dinner. Police asked to search the room and discovered a prescription bottle with the label scratched out buried in a tissue box. When asked what the powder in the bottle was, the actor told police, \"I think it's speed.\"  Police also found a WONDER WOMAN outfit and other fancy dress paraphernalia in his suite. The actor, currently a guest star in ALLY McBEAL, later asked police for a cigarette from his jail cell. SGT BRIAN ANDERSON of Palm Springs Police says, \"We told him we can't bend the rules just because you're a movie star, but he said, 'I'm just a man with a drugs problem.'\" The actor later asked for food and ate two reheated pieces of pizza and drank a can of Coca Cola.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430123641", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Eventually, yes, but at the start it's a lot simpler. \n\nA scale is just a predefined sequence of small intervals between each note. Every type of scale has it's own sequence; and every key of a particular scale uses the same sequence. The best way to illustrate it is with an example, so if we look at the C major scale, we get:\n\n    C D E F G A B C\n\nIf you look at the distance between each note in frets, you get:\n\n    Note:  C D E F G A B C   \n    Frets:  2 2 1 2 2 2 1\n\nMusic theorists use the terms \"whole tone\" for 2 frets and \"semi tone\" for 1 fret. A semi tone is also called a \"half tone\". Using W for whole tone and H for a half tone, you get:\n\n    Note:  C D E F G A B C   \n    Frets:  2 2 1 2 2 2 1\n    Ints:   W W H W W W H\n\nSo W W H W W W H is the sequence of intervals that make up the major scale. If you memorise this, you can apply it to any key to find the major scale.\n\nOn a guitar, pick any fret then follow the intervals in fret terms. For example, start at F# on the second fret of the low E:\n\n    Ints:  W W H W W  W  H\n    Fret: 2 4 6 7 9 11 13 14\n\nEach string is the equivalent of 5 frets higher than the string below (Except the B which is 4 frets higher than the G), so you can play it in one position:\n\n     Ints:  W W H W W W H\n     d|----------------3-4\n     a|----------2-4-6\n     e|----2-4-6\n     \n\nFrom any note if you play these intervals, you play the major scale of that note. Every major scale uses the same sequence of intervals.\n  \n     Intervals: W  W  H W  W  W  H\n     G major:  G  A  B C  D  E F# G\n     B major:  B C# D# E F# G# A# B\n     E major:  E F# G# A B  C# D# E\n\nAnd so on. Instead of memorising patterns on the fret board, if you memorise the interval you get the tools to work out the scale in all 12 keys. If you are playing a D chord, from the root note of the chord you can follow the intervals and play the D major scale over the top of that chord. When you start playing it in different keys and different places on the fretboard, you start to recognise when a note is wrong by ear. Your ear starts to recognise the intervals by the sound alone, because you always are playing it relative to the root note. You start to build up a mental 'library' of sounds relative to the root.\n\nYou are 100% correct in saying that these intervals have names: major 2nd, minor 3rd, major 3rd etc, and it is a great idea to get familiar with them as soon as possible - it just makes it easier to communicate ideas to different ideas, and makes it easier to see what other musicians are doing when you recognise an interval in one of their songs.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430192735", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The reason people memorize how it looks on the fretboard is so they don't have to think about it, it's automatic. \n\nFrom what I can see, another good way to know a scale is a cross between both your approach and the \"memorizing fretboard shapes\" approach. Memorize all the different ways each interval can look on the fret board, then you can play any scale you want (or make any scale you want) if you know the intervals relative to the root.

{"body": "When I was younger I used to fantasize about owning lions. After learning more about them I found they'd be very expensive - even one. They eat hundreds of pounds of meat within weeks, so that's a lot right there. As others have mentioned, you will pay big bucks for permits and you should probably also get some insurance in case of any, uh, accidents with the neighbors. Although you should probably live someplace isolated, because lions are very L O U D when they roar. Noise complaints would be constant. I have no idea what the vet would cost, but seeing how my little dog had two shots and a brief check-up and ran me $200 recently, I think the price for a big cat might be thousands.\n\nIt would probably be cheaper to move to Africa and live on a lion preserve to view from afar and never contact these cats. Yes. I bet it would be much cheaper.\n\nThe more I learned about lions the more I realized having one for a pet was a terrible idea. They are social creatures and roam large areas in nature. The ones in enclosures in zoos look so depressed I can't stand it. Even ones in larger outdoor 'safari' type parks look like they're bored to death.

Not defending it? Then you agree it wasnt \"hard\" for origin.com to act legally and you agree with me. So then there was no reason to type your snide reply where you played down that it was an issue at all \"TIL...\". FYI, I originally cross-posted my CS replies into Simcity reddit/maxis forums and hundreds of people sought refunds off my interactions. So it was never selfish about the original complaint or the time wasted. It was about EA doing the legally wrong thing to Aussies and denying refunds for a broken product. Try reading next time buddy :) And I'm not mad, I'm just calling you out for being a fanboy and typing things playing down/supportive of shitty practices.\n\nIn case you are unclear on the definition of \"fanboy\", its definition certainly includes anybody who defends a practice outside of logic / reason to a a normal person.  Being that this topic was upvoted in /r/games, /r/australia and cross-posted to a half dozen subreddits, featured of gamespot.com among half of the gaming news sites on the internet... and a basic sentiment analysis shows upwards of 90% disapproval, you behavior of playing down EA's culpability in this or the needless time wasting effect it had on customers would be deemed fanboyism by most people reading.

{"body": "Hey!  I kind of taught myself, I'll break down my strategy into simple steps.\n\n1.  Make sure whatever ship your launching has several RCS thrusters and an extra mono-propellant tank!  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!  RCS is the most important thing when it comes to docking and you want to make sure the thrusters don't run out of fuel.  Also make sure you have an SAS system with an extra rechargeable battery.  I also like using the solar panels to recharge the battery once I'm in orbit.\n2.  Make sure the ship has several docking ports in different locations around it so that another ship can dock in several places and you have options.\n3.  Put the first ship in orbit around Kerbin at anywhere from 100,000-140,000 meters\n4.  Put the second ship in orbit around Kerbin at anywhere in the same range.\n5.  Now, once both ships are in orbit, go to orbit view, and try to analyze which one has a tighter orbit or simply closer orbit to Kerbin (less altitude).  This ship will be orbiting Kerbin faster than the other one.  You can adjust the orbit of either ship to \"catch up\" to the other ship accordingly.  Your basic objective here is you want the ships to have a near approach.  If one ship is behind and you one it to catch up, simply adjust its orbit such that it is just inside the orbit of the other ship, and then it will slowly catch up to it.  The opposite is true as well if you want the other ship to catch up to you, you can just adjust your orbit so that it's just outside the other ship's orbit.\n6.  Now, the near approach is the moment of interest.  You should be able to achieve a near approach of less than 20km.  Set the other ship as your target by clicking on it and selecting that option.  Now make sure your out of orbit view and back into the normal view where you can see your ship.  You will be able to see the other ship with an indicator around it and it should tell you how far away it is when you mouse over it.  Go into docking mode by selecting the option on the bottom left.  Use your SAS to point toward the target (This should be an option).  In docking mode YOUR SHIFT KEY BECOMES FORWARD MOTION.  Also, the speed above your nav-ball will tell you your relative speed towards your target.\n7.  Once your pointing at your target, use shift to burn towards it.  Once you have a speed of about 50 m/s towards it stop burning.  Keep an eye on how far away your target is and it should get closer and closer but then at some point it should begin to start getting farther.  AT THIS MOMENT USE YOUR SAS TO FACE IN THE RETROGRADE DIRECTION and you might even wanna go back into staging mode to use your primary engine to burn until your relative speed to your target is practically 0 m/s.  Once this happens.  Face your target again while in docking mode and move towards it again.\n8.  You're going to have to repeatedly burn towards your target and come to a halt several times but eventually you will arrive at your target.\n9.  Once at your target, use your w a s d shift and control keys to carefully maneuver any two docking ports close to each other.  At some point they should grab each other and you're all set!\n\nHOPE THIS HELPED!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430305173", "subreddit": "KerbalSpaceProgram", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ...

So even though I've heard of it, I never actually spent more than 30 seconds on it until recently, so I was a 9gag regular.\n\nEven if I spent tons of time on that time waster, the most propable reason was that it was so easy, it actually became a habit.

Something so horrible, anethical and  inhumane that I snapped out of it quite violently. 9gag censored me in the worst way a \"social\" website can censor someone. By muting me without my knowledge.\n\nThe story was that I saw a post, that I saw on reddit one day ago. No big deal, but I felt like pointing it out. \"Hey, I already saw this on reddit!\" I said. And then silence. I was already getting suspicious on the ordeal that I did an experiment. Made some more comments like \"R e d d i t  did this first\", \"Bots don't even get subtle now\". I could see those comments when I was logged in. I could not when I wasn't. And of course other test comments I made that just saying things like \"banana for scale\" were visible normally.

{"body": "Here's something you can use. http://chordiehow.com/en/stringed/arpeggios\n\nThe creator of that website is somewhere on /r/guitar. I'm the one that told him to make that arpeggio finder, based off his scale finder, and add the full 24 fret neck ;p. Before it only went up to the 12th or 15th fret and only did certain scales. I'm so glad he made that because I've been using it ever since.\n\nIt says arpeggios because you choose what notes you wanna see based on the chord you click, and don't forget to click More Options to extend the neck and stuff. It's better than the scale finder because it just offers more note groups to choose from, and if you pick super extended chords it basically shows full 7+ note scales. So you can use that as a visual aid for finding tapping licks, vertical arpeggio picking, horizontal, and diagonal picking as well. You can use it to help find sweep picking licks as well.\n\nAn arpeggio just means playing the individual chord tones at once. A sweep is a physical movement of playing one note on each string with the right hand in a sweeping/strumming motion, with only one note ringing out at a time, looking like you're sweeping your pick up and down. I mean it can be done with fingerpicking too if you can manage that speed, especially if you know how to pick up and down with each finger (something I'm working on, it makes finger picking fast as fuck, check out Tosin Abasi doing up and down picking with his thumb). It doesn't have to be one chord, it can be any notes, it's just that it usually sounds good if it's the notes from a single chord. You can also add in hammer ons and pull offs, and tapping, but basically the right hand movement is just picking up or down once on the string, any more than that and it's called economy picking. Basically this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEUmNbQB5dM\n\nAnd yea soloing is easier when you know what chords are being played and where to play them and just do those chord tones. But you can also just know what key the song is in and play the appropriate scale tones. \n\nIn modern western music, every song is played in a single key. In jazz, it's usually still a single key but using different chords, so you gotta work on phrasing and really know where those chord and leading tones are. In other jazz, the key switches, and THAT's where it's REALLY important to know the exact chords being played, and be able to play those chord tones but also know what leading tones would sound good. And in those jazz songs, chord changes can happen every second, so your licks would incorporate notes from different chords from different keys a lot....\n\nBut yea in most music, you're just in one key, so it's a hellova lot easier. Key of C? Play the C major or A minor pentatonic scales. Or  C major scale, or A minor scale. And just use your key and eyes to know which notes of those scales sound good depending on the chord that's being played. Like of course you wanna do mostly C E G and B during the C major chord, and A C E G during the A minor... actually those are the same notes except you swap the A with the B, so it's easy to use either scale. Western mainstream music is the easiest shit to learn how to solo to.\n\nActually other music, like Chinese is pretty easy too. Play all the black keys on the piano, not hard to make it sound Asian, right? Yup, a lot of their older music has 5 note keys. But of course many countries adopted the 7 tone western scales into their music these days, the shit you hear on their radio stations with pop/rock singers anyway.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430358044", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Someone read it, didn't seem right, so they developed an alternate authorship theory.\n\nIt's that or assume the Iliad-author was stupid. The Phoenix embassy is the most obvious example of multiple authorship: there are three people being referred to by the grammatical dual. Either the author is a fucking idiot, or a later redactor just didn't worry about it. The latter is more plausible because grammatical forms tend to simplify as time wears on (note that the language as a whole does not become simpler), so the original author would have been more likely to stick to the number agreement demanded by the dual verbs.\n\n&gt; In the Ancient Near East People used different names for God all the time\n\nYes and no. Again, a good example is Apollo and Helios. In the Iliad, it's clear that they're separate deities, but if you look at later works, the names are used interchangeably and Apollo is now a sun god in addition to his other duties. The same thing happens in the ANE.

What are you looking for here? Youtube videos of the different schools producing their documents? The best evidence here is Jeremiah.

That's a clear case of document tampering and not merely a scribal error in transcribing a word or phrase. The psalms face many edits as well (look at MT, LXX, and DSS).

There are four or five different ones.\n\n* All sacrifices and offerings are for the all Levites, but only if you're an Aaronid.\n\n* The Levites are allowed to touch the objects of the Tabernacle, except they're not.\n\n* Balaam does a few things in doublets\n\n* The travels are a complete mess, often ending up in opposite directions from where they set out.\n\n* For example, the pass both around and through Moab; same with Edom\n\n* The first generation of Israelites are killed off three different times and places\n\n* Moses was told he couldn't enter Canaan in the 2nd year of wanderings and then again in the 40th\n\n* Moses couldn't enter because of his personal sins, and also because he bore the people's sins\n\n* Kadesh is in two different locations and the Israelites visit at the very beginning and very end of their journeys, but they only go once. It's all very Whovian.\n\n* Levites were given tithes both because of their service at the Tent of Meeting and because they had no land allotment.\n\n* Levites could only eat those tithes in front of Yahweh, but ya know, wherever is cool too.\n\n* The spies are supposed to check out the whole land, which happens to be just Judah.\n\n* Caleb alone faces down the Giants of Canaan, but he takes Joshua with him.\n\n* Yahweh is so angry, he swears to destroy all Israelites except Caleb. Oh yeah, and Joshyboy.\n\n* But the other scouts, they die immediately. After a while.\n\nYour boy Joshua isn't so hot on remembering things either.\n\n* He forgets that Balaam *didn't* want to wish ill on the Hebrews\n\n* He forgets that Moses led the conquest of Hormah, claiming he led the charge.\n\n* He forgets that Israel was able to penetrate southern Canaan back in Numbers and instead leads the Transjordanian conquest\n\n* Not to mention the internal issues\n\nWhew. That's just from memory. And if you *really* want to get into the mechanics of a lot of this, you'll need to dig into the Hebrew language and especially the archeology. The Documentary Hypothesis isn't perfect - no one claimed it is except its opponents - but it's very useful and its explanatory power is significant. \n\nUnless Moses was a demented idiot with an egotistical subordinate. In which case, sure, DH is way off.\n\n***\n\nBut it goes deeper than that. To *assume* Mosaic authorship, no matter how many qualifiers you add, you *assume* that the Genesis 1-11 accounts are *true history* or that Moses is a liar or that Yahweh is a liar, all of which are *very* problematic for a scholar or a bible thumper, whichever you may profess to be (I don't presume either way). We *know* the Earth is older than 6,000 years; we *know* that there was never a single human language; we *know* Edenic studies is bullshit (e.g. KoL = all, LeV = heart, KeLeV = dog; duh, because dogs are \"all heart\" despite how they're portrayed in the OT; this is then, I shit you not, considered the root word for English *collie* according to these charlatans); we *know* there was no global, nor for that matter sufficiently-universal-localized flood. If you discount these scientific facts, then please step away from the computer because we use those same tools to make the internet work.

{"body": "Ok, let's go!\n\nOk, I'm going to try to show you 3 things  - you are going have to play around with them and see how you can apply them, but it should only take an hour to go through the concepts enough for you to \"learn\" the theory.\n\nFirst up is the major scale. The major scale is like an interface for all music - it isn't used to shred through solos as much as it is the glue that holds every thing together.\n\nScales are best viewed as a sequence of intervals that go *between* the notes. Intervals are measured Tones and Semitones. A tone, or T, is 2 frets; A Semitone, S, is 1 fret. A major scale has 8 notes (with the last the same as the first an octave higher) so there are 7 intervals between them.\n\nThe intervals of a major scale are:\n\nT T S T T T S.\n\nWrite that down - and remember they go between the notes.\n\nPick any fret on the guitar. Start there and play these intervals. A distance of 2 frets for a T, 1 fret for an S. You've just played a major scale. \n\nThe next thing is chord theory, but it takes an understanding of the major scale to get it. So, what I'd like you to do is write down the 11 notes of music - A Bb B C C# etc. Each one of them is one fret on a guitar - that's why the 12th fret is the same note as an open string - one different note for each fret  then it repeats. \n\nOnce you have all 12, pick any one of them. Write it down then using the intervals of the major scale work out what other notes are in the scale and write them down. Underneath each write down the 'degree' (or number of the note) in the scale. Eg. If you start with A, that's note 1, then you go up an interval of \"T\" - 2 frets - and you get B - that's note 2. Keep going till you have all 8 - the 8th should be the same as the first.\n\nLet me know what you get.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430403398", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

You've got the G# minor 7 chord on the top 5 strings and a fifth in the bass. Really nice for G# Minor / B major\n\nD A E G# A E - This is the tuning Antoine Dufour uses in his arrangement of Hide and Seek (the tabs are free, go learn it!), I love the original and started writing my own material. It's a really crunchy tuning, the minor second between strings 3 and 2 really shines. \n\nD A C E A D is another one I'm a big fan of, it's really great for playing in A Minor (all along the watchtower covery anybody?) and over the neck style. \n\nDADGCE - I like this tuning alot, cause it has the same structure as standard tuning from 6 to 2 on the strings 5 to 1.\n\nI really like altered tunings, it really lets you play with your sandbox.

{"body": "Considered doing tutorials in light of my new album [幽霊 G H O S T S](https://soundcloud.com/iacon/sets/ghosts). I use Ableton Live 9, Ableton Push, and a scarlett solo audio interface with a pair of $300 sennheiser headphones. I started learning how to group audio / midi tracks, glue bus them, route each channel to a blank audio channel to house effects, route it to the master group, then route all groups to my master chain. Super clean, polished, efficient. Saves on CPU as well. It REALLY helps knowing how to change your master EQ from L/R to M/S (mono / stereo). 0hz to 110hz should be used only for MONO signals, and STEREO signals 110hz to 10,000hz should be used for everything else. Having that separation truly gives your kicks and subs clarity over your track without muddying it. \n\nJust a few tips. If anyone wants a serious of video tutorials on mixing, routing, how to use the push for vaporwave, my set up, etc etc etc etc etc, please upvote or comment on this post.\n\nI'm looking forward to what this post has to offer from other producers :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430432461", "subreddit": "Vaporwave", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}
