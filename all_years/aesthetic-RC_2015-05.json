{"body": "Persian phonology is actually rather simple, so there isn't a whole lot of room for variation. The biggest question is how to assign vowels, as the consonants are much more constrained in their use. From my own knowledge of various languages (I've worked with several languages that use the Latin script), Unipers is the truest of them all.\n\nHowever, if we compare Tajik orthography to Iranian Persian orthography, there is an appreciable difference. The main issue is that Persian has 6 vowels, and the Latin alphabet has only 5. The way Iranians tend to deal with this is to use the following:\n\na ā e i o u\n\nThe Tajik set of vowels is\n\na e i o u ū\n\nThe ū is not strictly necessary, as only some Tajik speakers pronounce it differently from u, but the reason why Iranian Persian has ā and Tajik Persian doesn't is because Iranian Persian uses \"o\" to make the sound in \"oval\", while Tajik Persian uses that letter to make the sound in \"on\". Thus Iranian Persian needs an added vowel (ā) to take the latter sound.\n\nTajik vowels are close to Dari, from what I can tell. Unipers can accommodate both Dari and Farsi, but the spellings would end up being different. For example: *xāne* vs. *xāna* (in Tajik: *xona*)\n\nWhich brings us to another reason why the Perso-Arabic is good--its can subtly accommodate all the accent variations. Regardless of whether someone speaks with an Afghan accent or Tehrani accent, they can all read the same original texts. Switching to a more purely phonetic system will cause confusion as they will be forced to learn each other's accents in order to communicate in writing.

That's how a shaped charge works, and why you have \"pipe\" in a pipe bomb.  However, TNT isn't a really strong material.  Making a structure out of TNT to keep all the TNT in place until the shock wave detonates it all will be difficult.  The result will be that you started off with N gigajoules of energy in an M x M x M meter cube.  That's already less focused than N gigajoules in a 1 x 1 x 1 meter atomic device.  However, when the detonation starts it will start to push the TNT out, lets say to a 2M x 2M x 2M cube.  It will take the shock wave time, moving at 300-500 m/s to cross this 2M^3 cube.

{"body": "This is just my 2 cents of advice for working on your win rate. \n\nKeep this I mind “For every loss I need a win”  – to do that you need some “go to” tanks that you are very good at and can use to get a win when you need one.  Most of us have a tank that for one reason or another we feel comfortable in and we seem to always win in.  You will need 3 of those tanks.  So when you grind the tank you are trying to advance, and take a loss, you use a “go to tank” to farm a win.  Look at your tank list and see which ones have the highest win rates.  Yes even if it is a Tier 1.   This also applies to the daily 2x experience.  Some people keep going into matches until they get the 2x win, and don’t realize that it may have taken them 4 tries to win.  That is 3 losses to 1 win and it impacts your win rate by a net loss of -2.\n\nNext set a daily lost limit. I have a daily loss limit of 8 total losses (not consecutive).  That means that you do a count.  +1 for a win -1 for a loss.  So if I  W W L L L  =  -1 overall.  So you could do 20 battles and stay even and be ok.  But if you get to the point where your are at a -8 then quit for the day and walk away.  Do something else.  I have tried to go back some times at -8 and it only gets worse.  So that is why I put a limit on it, you have to know when to walk away.  And unless you are going to put in a very long day, you really cannot come back from that.  So just chalk it up to it not being your day.\n\nAnother poster said it as well; play when you seem to win the most.  For me in Arizona its 6PM to 8PM and again at 11PM   So keep an eye out of for when you win the most and play during those times.\n\nAnyway we have all had very bad loss streaks and we can sympathize.  So take a break and try again later.  Good luck.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430514835", "subreddit": "WorldofTanks", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

The healers will sense those needing healing, etc. These observations are by-products of doing the sitting. \n\nPlaying with Kundalini is like playing with fire. If you know what you are doing, no problem. You can grab a stick or log from the fire and move it. You can stir up the flames or calm them down without burning yourself. You can make a bon-fire or a wee traditional cooking one. \n\nHere you are, exploring Kundalini with what appears to be very little knowledge, and some blatant misconceptions. I don't wish to condemn you here - only to wake you up so you recognise that fact. Make it a priority to start getting some, eh? Go beyond YT vids which occasionally are excellent, and often are crap.   \n\n&gt;I don't care about money or anything.   \n\nWhen exploring the deeper spiritualities, it's important to not ignore or forget the paying of bills, having or keeping a job (or running your business), etc. You can always choose to go live on the street and live super-simply... but that will make your path a selfish one. You will have far less influence in bettering yourself and your fellow human by choosing that path. The selfishness will become a hindrance. So my suggestion is to care enough in your finances to get by okay. You do not have to pursue wealth like many do. That wouldn't be consistent to who you are.  \n\nDo you ever get out into the woods or ponds and lakes to hike, walk or canoe?  \n\nI wrote the wiki specifically for people like yourself. please go have a good look through it. \n\nAlso, consider getting Genevieve Paulson's book on Kundalini. It's available at www.genevievebooks.com or on-line.  \n\nKundalini will bring the issues of your past to the surface. If you need help dealing with your stuff, consider seeing a counsellor / therapist, etc. We are 7 Billion on the planet and going the independent individual route makes little sense. We're meant to work together.  \n\n-----\n\nLets look at your other comment and question topics.  \n\nGender - Kundalini activity can make gender be temporarily quite flexible or less-defined. This is because you are adopting some completion from the other gender's qualities without losing your own. \n\nEnergy Highjacked. In your case, this is likely just you over-using or over-pushing energy, and feeling depleted afterwards - very similar to how men feel after orgasm. Solution - read a practical book that deals with that, or find a teacher. As /u/Jarunik suggested, the link may also prove useful. If it's not you over-using your energy, the highjacking idea is possible.  \n\nMassive Energy swings up and down is a normal part of the beginnings of Kundalini. It is not necessarily highjacking going on.   \n\nYamas and Niyamas? Absolutely!!  \n\nThere are some teachers near DC, and some in CA, depending on the flavour of Kundalini you wish to explore. I doubt that you *have* to move for that, or at least you shouldn't need to, but go right ahead if you wish.  \n\nLosing Hair and Aging Fast - My Grandfather was bald at age 21. Losing hair is losing hair. You could talk to your doctor, perhaps. I have no idea what doctors are suggesting in that regard. Aging fast in inconsistent with Kundalini. Some people *market* Kundalini as an aging reducer, something I find rather cheap and shallow and quite inappropriate for Kundalini, but that's just me. However, a harmonious relationship with Kundalini will drive you to or help heal many things about you, and make your attitude youthful - which slows aging. LIVING IN THE MOMENT ALONE, SLOWS AGAIN. OoPs. If you are actually aging fast, then either you're really feeding the fire incorrectly, or something else is going on. Have you asked you Doctor about this one, just to be sure? Are you eating well? Are you working with strongly toxic things? Do you hold toxic ideas in your head? Maybe drop watching the news.    \n\nTEACHER - in your case again, finding a teacher would be useful to confirm that you are working with Kundalini, and then to help you correct what you are doing wrong, smooth things out for you. There are fine teachers on the East side of the USofA. They will be a r o u n d DC likely, more than in DC.   \n\nAP, RV and LD - I agree with /u/qyron that these are distractions and other than helping expand the mind and experiences, offer nothing specifically useful to a Kundalini practice. There's lots of blind leading the blind within these topics, and lots of drugs use, which is not harmonious with Kundalini. Very destructive, actually.  \n\nStrong Sexual Urges - Doing Yoga is indeed an excellent idea, however, that may increase the strength of the urge temporarily. Grounding will help (Look it up in the Wiki on [Supporting Practices](/r/kundalini/wiki/sp) ), and spending time walking on sandy stony beaches or dirt paths can ground nicely. Go barefoot if you can do so safely. Sit near the river. Be calm in nature. Springtime in nature may help a little less as Nature herself is being sexual, so maybe avoid hugging trees, and stick to lying on the ground or big rocks. 5 or 10 minutes isn't long enough. Stay past the agitation. Put a hat on your face to keep the sun off your eyes.  \n  \nMEDITATION - start learning what meditation *actually* is in a more formal sense. Meditation is vast and near-infinite. I'd recommend the basics of Vipassana for you. Start with Anapanasati or Samatha (Concentration on the breath). So many skills and discoveries will come from that foundation skill - so making it a priority is a great idea. \n\n/r/Meditation and our wiki have links and resources towards those. You can do zazen, or anything established form of your own choosing, just let it be of experienced quality beyond your own personal experience. Once you have several months experience, if stable and not struggling with depression, consider a retreat.  \n\nYou'd be a good candidate to try a process that /u/JCashish posted almost a year ago. Search on his name here in the sub or search on Transmuting. He posted two very useful methods. If you have trouble finding them, speak up and I'll get you links to them.   \n\n**Please remember** that Kundalini is about awareness, about love, about service, and the growth and evolution to make those worthwhile and practical.

{"body": "Hmmm. Yeah, Maim and fracture are more for \"I'm already in control of this pack, I want to speed it up and/or ensure I don't ever lose control.\" Fracture's threat is negligible, to my knowledge, but if I'm cozy I always slap it on for free damage but it def. isn't high on your threat tool list. Maim is ~f r e e  d a m a g e ~ and later on you'll always have it up anyway since it's a step on the way to Storm's Path.\n\nGenerally what I'd recommend is opening with 2-3 overpowers. Open it with Berserk first if you have it and Flash during the pacify if you need/want to. \n\nFrom there you should be able to pretty much just whack whatever the primary mob is with Skull Sunder and not have too much trouble, putting up Maim and maintaining that as soon as you feel like it's safe. If you have a really saucy melee DPS you might watch it spin around occasionally, but that's it.\n\nFlash is nice but you don't need it for *every* pull. The main use of it is to keep your threat generation going if you can't get an Esuna for your pacify, extra AOE when you somehow need more then ~3 taps with Overpower, and situations where you can't tag every mob with overpower (like as a free tap when you're running through 'em to flip em around for the party.) \n\nLike others have said, this all gets easier once you have BB and Defiance. You've got more breathing room to work with and set up debuffs/self-buffs, but it definitely shouldn't be totally impossible to hold trash against like 90% of synced DPS, so don't give up!

Sigh, I guess I’m still getting used to eating dry-freeze paste out of a tube :/ Anyway, May and I are going to play racquetball with the guys later on so once we make some protein I can finally bulk up I look so skinny!!\n\nDay 186: April. Condition—tired, healthy, and stable. I’m a little worn out from racquetball yesterday, but I feel like the “good” kinda sore, you know? Like going out for a jog kinda worn out. Man, I miss fresh air. Can’t wait till the biodome picks up! That reminds me, check the sprinkler system in the front perennial unit. My shower yesterday was having low pressure. I feel like there could be reduced pipe diameter due to the recent fluctuation in surface temperature. Time for bed, ughhhhh!\n\nDay 188: April. Condition—irritable, healthy, and stable. So, I finally got clearance to inspect the pipes the other day and ran full diagnostics on it but I can’t find any issue with it so I tried having May look because she’s in the same department as me but… I can’t find her anywhere. I assume she’s out in the aqua collection ducts just a mile north of here but I don’t know she won’t answer her radio. I guess I’ll just have to wait for her until she gets back this evening. If she’s not back by tomorrow morning 0600, I’m gonna have to report her ://// Come back May!! \n\nDay 189: April. Condition—depressed, healthy, and stable. May isn’t back. The stupid water doesn’t even work anymore, nobody knows why I just—I just don’t know what’s going on. May was fine when we played racquetball. Then she went to bed and… I don’t know, I guess she was really quiet and—well… she was in the bathroom for a long time that night I guess, and she normally doesn’t do that. She’s normally very quick because she has to study for her botany at night. I just hope they find her because honestly, we really need to get these pipes fixed and I need her help. \n\nDay 190: April. Condition—upset, dehydrated, and stable. Fuck I’m so thirsty. Everyone here is banging on my door\n\nDay 191: April. Condition—scared, dehydrated, and unstable. Alright, here’s what happened. \nA blown water main was found yesterday afternoon in the main aqua duct. There was also blood. Lots of it. They think May did it and her radio is making strange noises—like, music or something. Nobody could understand. I mean, the base has undergone emergency lockdown.

{"body": "First thing is your equipment. What do you have for ranged armour?  I would recommend at least Karil's or armadyl.  Then your armadyl crossbow paired with an off hand rune crossbow for dps or a dragonfire shield for fire protection.  I would recommend the shield as it will combine with a regular anti fire to give full Dragon flame protection.  Necklace and ring are your choice, take whatever gives you the best ranged bonuses.  Lastly a cape(ava's if you have it), a sign of life, and an aura if you have an applicable one. \n\nNext is inventory and familiar.  I would take a war tortoise.  For potions I would have a super range, a super defence, an anti fire, and a prayer renewal.  After that the rest goes to healing.  I usually take eight  rocktails, twelve sara brews, and six super restores.  My familiar then carries two rocktails for each sara brew to fill up it's inventory minus the last two slots for my unicorn stallion plus scrolls.  I would\n take more super restores in your situation.  I'd also recommend some emergency house teleport tabs.\n \nLast is strategy.  I'd recommend watching a couple guides on YouTube.  That said I'll  mention some things to watch for. To begin with the fight is in four phases and at  the end of each phase you activate a crystal to start the next phase.  Always keep an eye on your chat box as it will warn you of any special attacks. Dragon fire is avoided by moving to the empty space in the wall off flames.  You can also walk through the wall with proper timing and practice.  Each phase the number of walls increases.  The queen will also summon lost souls.  When they spawn they'll create a pool of chaos energy that will slowly chase you and deals massive damage.  Run away from the pool well firing  abilities at the souls to kill them.  The number of souls increases up to four with each phase and each gets his own pool.  Occasionally one of the souls will teleport to the other end of the arena and start begging you to kill him.  Do it because if he survives long enough,  time stops and the queen black Dragon gets to hit you for fifteen seconds well you just sit there.  She also had a super heated breathe that just has to be tanked as well as the ability to change forms to gain defence.  During these attacks I just keep shooting.\n\nThis should get you started and I'd recommend doing a few practice mode kills first to learn.  Your stats are lower than I would recommend but by no means is this an impossible fight.

{"body": "Mkay, Liss is more mobile than any of the 3 in terms of map presence. E can be used to sneak through even the fattest terrain without giving any warning that you are coming, you simply appear out of the wall and ult. Her R is almost 100% going to get a kill, you can't mess it up, just hit whoever is closest and focus them. Do not worry about who that target is, midgame all that matters is that you and your ADC and top pick up kills.\n\nCassio vs melee is unfair. Q is moronically powerful for how cheap it is at rank 1, you can absolutely force 3 potions out of Zed before level 3. With one point in Q and 2 in E, and Zed out of HP potions, you can force him out of lane with aggressive play. NEVER autoattack while you are in the minion wave, the only way Zed wins this trade is if you draw aggro. Spells only. Use E to last hit when aggression is not possible, but not Q. The E mana restore makes you a lot like Annie in terms of how hard you can be to push out of lane. Run Flash Barrier to survive his level 6 attempt on your life, then get a Zhonya's 2nd item after Archangels. It delays Luden's or Ryalis, but its a hard counter and forces Zed to choose another target or waste ult to blow your Zhonya's.\n\nViktor vs Leblanc goes Viktor's way for a few reasons. First, his level 1-2 is strong enough in terms of trade potential to not get bodied by LB QW bullshit. Q her when she is on the way in, the shield will cut her damage in half, then get the return AA before she can blink, and E at her return spot. LB rarely runs MR because she expects to be the only one dealing damage, so if you can trade hits with her you can out-trade, and out mana sustain, cause LB's shit costs a lot. \n\nHer level 6 is pretty oppressive, but at level 7 with Hex 1 Viktor auto-clears the ranged creeps with 1 spell. You can pin LB to her tower from massive range, forcing her to use W QR E instead of QR WE, and as long as you always hit Q on her to shield some damage, she runs out of mana and can't clear the waves under her tower. You out-teamfight her at dragon due to W being massive zone control and R being untargetable Tibbers, and late game you can take 2/3rds of her HP with one E. Make sure to get a Banshee's Veil after Hex3 and Morellonomicon, it shuts down her poke burst and forces her to play more dangerously if she wants to do damage, in addition to making you un-oneshottable.\n\nUrgot beats Ahri at level 2, no questions asked. He beats everyone at level 2 no questions asked. Its Urgot. In teamfights his R is a great counter to hers, and in lane it lets you actually kill her with a jungle gank instead of just watching her jump away. Urgot's new shield makes him too hard for her to kill, and his damage forces her to either go Zhonya's or get actually killed in one E Q Q Q Q combo.\n\nGot questions on other matchups?

{"body": "&gt;I'm not exactly sure what intelligent harmonies are [...]\n\nVery simple--it's just like anybody else harmonizing with you for a certain interval (3rds, for instance) and a certain scale/mode (major/minor/Lydian/harmonic minor/etc.)...so if you were to play, a C D E F G in a C major scale, the pitch shifter would play E F G A B. You could also just as well the pitch shifter to harmonize by the same interval, but in Mixolydian for that example, and it would play E F G A Bb instead! Intelligent harmonizers get used a LOT by guitarists in single-guitar bands, where they have to cover a lot of ground and do harmonized guitar solos. There's quite a lot of pedals that can do this now, and they really run the gamut of doing just majors and minors (Boss PS series, for instance) to doing additional scales (pentatonic/harmonic minor/melodic minor/etc.) and even being able to switch on the fly with a switch or an expression pedal (Eventide Pitchfactor can do this and it's very useful for solos like \"Hotel California,\" where more than one scale/mode is used). Generally speaking, any pitch shifter at this level of complexity can do higher &amp; lower octave tones at the same time as well (Pitchfactor can actually do up to 4 harmony notes at a time, with is Quadravox mode). \n\n&gt;I'm also not sure what shimmer effects are haha\n\nImagine if you had a delay that went up an octave every time it fed back, until it got so high after enough repeats that you couldn't hear it anymore--that's a shimmer, and it was originally done by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois (in the late 70s/early 80s, I believe) by using an AMS Delay/pitch shifter, a Lexicon reverb (which just came after the shimmer to add ambiance), and a mixer (which allowed them to feed the pitch shifter/delay back into itself, creating the shimmer). Shimmers don't always have to be octaves though--they can just as well be 5ths, 4ths (definitely a more \"off the beaten path\" sound with a 4th!), or various combinations of those all together (I've come to really like making shimmers with 5ths and octaves together recently, on the same feedback line). They are sometimes made with reverse pitch shifters (Eventide, Strymon), and sometimes made with \"normal\" pitch shifters, both of which have their place. It's a cool effect, but in my opinion, hard to get right, as a lot of pedals don't give you enough control to really fine-tune the feedback and the delay times to make a shimmer that doesn't sound \"harsh.\" The Strymon Timeline, BlueSky, BigSky, Eventide Pitchfactor/H9, Eventide SPACE, etc. probably have the best shimmer effects you can get in pedals. The Neunaber Seraphim is not bad either (thought more control would be welcome). \n\nIt looks like you have a little narrowing down to do. What I would do if I were you is think first about whether or not I'd want the ability to do intelligent harmonies--from right there, that narrows things down a LOT either way. Personally, if you don't have another mandolin player in the band, I think this would be a *very* useful feature to have, as it has the potential to really fill out your sound and make it huge, both for adding harmony notes to solos and for beefing up rhythm parts (adding low octaves to your notes that are just as low as a bass, for instance!). But I don't know what else you've got going on in the band--if somebody else helps you out with harmonies, either on a mandolin or another instrument, it may not be such a concern, so I'd think about getting something that didn't need so many features then.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430716491", "subreddit": "guitarpedals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

However, to be generic, let's assume it's something like...\n\n    data T a = A a (T a) | B (T a) (T a) | C a | D\n\nNote that this creates four constructors\n\n    A :: a -&gt; T a -&gt; T a\n    B :: T a -&gt; T a -&gt; T a\n    C :: a -&gt; T a\n    D :: T a\n\nNow the idea of a catamorphism is that given some expression like `B (B (C 5) (C 7)) (A 6 D) :: T Int`, you can systematically replace all constructors with some value.  You then end up with the expression `b (b (c 5) (c 7)) (a 6 d) :: r` for some `r`.\n\nHence your catamorphism takes four values (that it'll be replacing A, B, C, and D with), a `T a`, and should return an `r`.  Note that the values that it will use as replacements will have thes ame signature as their corresponding constructor, except that instead of `T a` we will have `r`.\n\nThis gives:\n\n    cata :: (a -&gt; r -&gt; r) -&gt; (r -&gt; r -&gt; r) -&gt; (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r -&gt; T a -&gt; r\n\nNow you just need to implement this.

The establishment of new SROTC detachments will not be authorized after full mobilization has been declared. 1–13. Reserve Officers’ Training Corps programs during mobilization Under a partial mobilization, ROTC commissioning policies remain the same as in peacetime. During a full or total mobilization the following policies will be implemented at the direction of DCSPER: a. Military colleges and institutions. ROTC programs will continue at an accelerated rate as directed. b. Military junior colleges. ROTC training at the 2-year military schools will remain the same. c. Nonmilitary colleges and institutions. ROTC programs will be suspended on full mobilization. 1–14. Cadre during mobilization **The active component cadre will be available for reassignment within TRADOC**. Personnel excess to TRADOC requirements will be reported to PERSCOM for reassignment. active Guard-Reserve Cadre will be mobilized in accordance with policies established by DOD and HQDA. 1–15. Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadets during mobilization a. Military colleges and institutions. **All military science (MS IV) cadets who have successfully completed advanced camp will be COMMISSIONED and directed to attend the proper officers basic course (OBC)**. The CG, ROTCCC, will determine the OBC scheduling and the branch and specialty designation of cadets. Bulk allocations by specialty will be furnished by the CG, PERSCOM, per ODCSPER guidance. b. Military junior colleges. **Only commissioned graduates are subject to immediate call to active duty without completing a baccalaureate degree.** c. Nonmilitary colleges and institutions. On full mobilization, ROTC programs will be suspended. The cadre will be a v a i l a b l e f o r r e a s s i g n m e n t w i t h i n T R A D O C .

If M-Day occurs during the school year, **cadets who have completed ROTC advanced camp will be commissioned as soon as possible.** (2) Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadets under contract (any cadet who has signed an ROTC contract) who have not completed the advanced camp will, immediately after receiving instructions from HQDA, be called to the Officer Candidate School (OCS). Mobilization policies and procedures for the OCS are contained in AR 351–5. Those contract students who have completed basic camp or MS II training will enter directly into the OCS with appropriate follow-on OBC. All other contact students will be called to active duty immediately as enlisted reservists to attend training. If they complete basic training and demonstrate officer potential, they may be offered the OCS option. 1–16. Special Reserve Officers’ Training Corps programs a. Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) participants are cadets who are assigned to the ARNG and USAR units according to NGR 600–100, AR 600–200, AR 135–91 or AR 601–210. They do not mobilize with their units under full or partial mobilization. The SMP participants will be mobilized with the ROTC Program as outlined in paragraph 1–15, above. b. Officers already commissioned under the Early Commissioning Program (ECP), who have completed OBC and are assigned to troop units, will be mobilized with their units. The ECP officers who have not joined a unit, will be called to active duty and programmed for OBC by the CG, U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Center (ARPERCEN) in coordination with the CG, PERSCOM and CG, ROTCCC.

Two weeks off will probably be good for me, so I'm not too mad about it. I gladly admit that I cheated.

You can think of it this way: a series of words A B C D can be interpreted as (((A) B) C) D.\"\"\n\nThis is the bit that has always confused me: the first sentence of the two seems to me to suggest a head-initial structure, but then looking at the next bit I get the impression of a head-final language. The problem is, that the examples you give seem to confirm first the first, then the second!\n\n1.  Your example with **X ke** seems (using the most obvious interpretation) to be **ke** modifying **X**, confirming your first sentence.\n\n2. Your examples of noun phrases seem to confirm the second part of your explanation: for example you say that **[pigeon] [city]** is a city (of pigeons), which (as I hope my brackets will emphasis) I understand as being primarily a city, thus making this look very much head-final.\n\nI have tried to make sense of this, and judging by the consistency of all of your second set of examples, and the fact that this interpretation is the one suggested by the non-verbal initial explanation (rather than the verbal one, which I worry I might be misinterpreting), I have come to suspect that the actual structure is head-final.\n\nAssuming this, I have tried a re-interpretation of your first example: Is it accurate to say that, rather than **ke** being an 'adjective' or 'adverb' -like word, to the 'noun' or 'verb' of **X**, that **ke** is a 'noun' or 'verb' in its own right, and that its meaning simply depends on the collection of words that come before it (in this case it means **not \\_\\_whatever\\_came\\_before\\_it\\_\\_**) - so that really it is the head of the noun-phrase (thus fitting in with the head-final interpretation).\n\nAlso assuming this interpretation, I would have thought that it would make more sense in the first sentence of the explanation that I quoted, to say rather that the meaning of a (normal) words is narrowed (made more specific) by the meaning of the collection of words that come before it. Is this accurate?\n\n_[Thank you for reading to the end of this, and I'm very sorry for making so verbose what is essentially just a request for clarification.]_", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430761082", "subreddit": "minlangs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Yes, it is.\n\nThere is a post on KiA's front page about Joss Whedon. What does it have to do with gamergate?\n\n\"Because SJWs!\" is not acceptable. That is a HUGE topic and that's *exactly* my point.\n\nAnd the one or two tweets he made about GG? Those weren't even in 2015.\n\n&gt;We've \"introspected\" several times now, all with the same result. Now, we're having another crack at it, and we're gonna have the exact same answer -- most people DO THINK this stuff is on-topic and important to talk about.\n\n\"Community audits community; finds nothing wrong.\" Sounds like complacency to me. I'm sure Kotaku would say the same about themselves, eh?\n\n&gt;You're not getting downvoted for criticizing this sub. You're getting downvoted because you're purposefully conflating mass disagreement with /u/TheHat2 's point of view on this matter with mass personal attacks against said mod from so-called \"petulant children\". Simply put, you're not engaging here in good faith.\n\n\"Argue in bad faith\" sure is a fancy way of going about tone policing. I said what I did because I don't like how this community feeds its mods, who do a lot of work for free, to the sharks. Sometimes its deserved and I am well aware, without naming names, of those sorts of incidents. Other times it just leads to a retarded amount of threads on 8chan for example. Some anon was buttblasted enough to unironically make a thread about \"Operation \\#killthehatman\" some time ago about the drama threads. I bet if I go to /gamergatehq/(arguably the shittiest GG chan board to date) right now, I'd see the same.\n\nSo... me 'arguing in bad faith'? Yeah right. What about people suggesting murder because they took the mods felt like doing their job?\n\n&gt;I came here shortly after the zoe post, right when that big TB post got nuked, so yeah, I've been here for awhile too. I can confidently say you're massively inflating the community/mod friction that's been here for the last few months. Sure, there's been friction, but \"shittiest community you've ever seen\"? Really? You sound like a drama queen. This sub has had several discussions about moderation, and the issues have been peacefully resolved each time. Sounds like the community AND THE MODS are doing a good job.\n\nI am inflating nothing as the previous paragraph proves. 'Sure there's been friction'/'peacefully resolved'... are you joking? Yeah, I don't think you know what's going on behind the scenes. I guess I can't fault you for that, but if you did know, you wouldn't be downplaying it so much. \n\nAs for 'drama queen' yeah now who's arguing in bad faith? I've modded a lot of communities, had my share of angry trolls, but never had to deal with the shit GG community moderators do. It's a league of its own.\n\n&gt;B I N G O This is NOT an activism sub. Stop pretending it ever was. It's a place where people can talk about gg and gg-related stuff, because virtually everywhere else on the popular, visible internet bans this kind of open discussion.\n\nOk, WHAT? Holy shit are you being serious with me right now? \"Never was\" - have you forgotten email goals? Boycotts? Letters sent, responses from various organizations? Crowdfunded efforts?\n\nMay not be the type of activism you had in mind but it fits the definition nonetheless. It also got shit done. Yeah, not an activism sub, but I guess a lot of it just happened coincidentally right???\n\n&gt;Again, you're getting downvoted because it's clear to the people here you're arguing in bad faith.\n\nI'm getting downvoted because I'm going against the grain and people would rather pretend arguments like mine don't exist than question the choices they've made regarding this sub.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430769835", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

But for all intents and purposes here the atoms are likely bonded together physically through tape.\n\nWhich the adhesive on the tape grips both sides of the plane and unites them into one.\n\nSo I guess I'm being sort of lazy in the description because it really comes down to the shape of molecules which is more chemistry. But the idea is in the same way that the necklaces can be united together we can think of the paper as a thin sheet of millions of beaded necklaces. Each bead is a molecule and instead of string it uses physical and chemical properties to attach together.\n\nThe necklaces need to have a twist so if we label them necklaces A,B,C,D then the attachment needs to go something like\n\n    A B C D\n    D C B A\n\nA is connected to D, B to C and vice versa.\n\nThis is true even if we added more and more connections.\n\n    A B C D E F G H I\n    I H G F E D C B A\n\nSo on the Two dimensional plane the twist in the 3rd dimension causes one end to be attached to the opposite.\n\nThe atoms are connected in a very similar way it's just too many to even fathom.

{"body": "&gt; It wasn't easy, for sure. Usually took me 2-3 minutes per box to configure it right. And Windows Vista+'s DWM tended to completely ruin it (as did all Linux compositors.

There are supposedly various tricks to disabling DWM (much hairier on Windows 8, too), but I never really did them, because I don't run Windows myself.\n \nI could be mistaken, because this is all a bit over my head, but is it possible that this works on OS X because its desktop compositor has an additional frame of latency over Windows/Linux?

{"body": "I just . . . what does that have to do with race? Did you say, 'I don't want any non-whites smoking weed here'??? Assuming you didn't, then clearly she knows, even if she doesn't realize it, she's in the wrong. \n\nWhen people resort to these sort of arguments (\"This completely unrelated thing somehow shows that you're racist/sexist/homophobic/republican/lactose-intolerant/literally-Hitler/etc.\") it shows that they have no actual argument to stand on. They see that they are losing and humans, as is our nature, tend to want to fight instead of admitting wrong. So they go with something inflammatory and, most importantly, distracting. People don't want to be seen as *bad* so they will instinctively refute the accusation (\"I'm not racist\"), which derails the argument and makes it about something else entirely. This may be something that is stacked in their favor, or something where there is no winning. Because you, the accused, are now on the defense, she can sidestep the issue and use it to convince you to let her do what she wants (\"Well if you aren't racist, then you'd let me smoke\"). Because we don't want to be seen as bad, we are more likely to just give in. \n\nSo, how to respond to this sort of thing. The keys to winning arguments are to: stay focused on the issue at hand, be receptive of their points, compromise, and be prepared to use up to 35 different explanations to explain the exact same shit. \n\nS T A Y | F O C U S E D\n-----------------------\n\nObviously, totally ignore the race card she just played. She might throw some other shit at you. Once again, she may not even realize why she's doing it. We tend to get pretty irrational when we want something and it's threatened. \n\nBut you could also get off topic and start arguing about other shit that bothers you. Even if there's some other thing you want to get out, just focus on getting this one thing resolved. You don't need to fix everything in one giant bitchfest. \n\nSo, what you should do is wait a little while for both of you to regroup and not be as emotional. In this time, you need to figure out all the reasons you don't want her to smoke. You might think, 'well I already fucking know my reasons, SmoSays, you kumquat.' That's not what I mean and excuse you, you don't need to be so rude I'm only trying to help. You need to be able to tell HER your reasons. I find that while it might seem perfectly logical to me, the other person isn't privy to all the steps my brain went through to come to that conclusion. \n\nAlso, putting your reasons into words will help you stay focused. And you might even have reasons you didn't realize existed. \n\nSo, mentally go through a set of bullet points for WHY you want it that way. Be prepared to tell her all these things (do NOT write out the bullet points and just hand them to her. I've learned from personal experience that this is an ineffective strategy). \n\nPut the points that are completely unswayable at the top and the ones that could be bent or disregarded easily at the bottom. Be willing to concede defeat on some of these points. \n\nFor example, let's say the legality of weed is one of your points. You don't want to be arrested, you don't want *her* arrested, so you put that shit at the top. Maybe you also don't like how she acts when stoned. Perhaps be willing to compromise on this part (for example, if she did it when you weren't home). If you think weed nuggets look like tree barf, then perhaps you should disregard this and just don't look at it because that's just a weird issue to have. \n\nWhen you bring these up to her, you're going to start at the top, with the most important. Don't just shoot the list at her. Make the point and then debate over it a bit. If need be, move on to the second point, and so on. You may also find yourself going back to them if needed. But those last points are for your selfish reasons, or for things that could be easily taken care of. Save those for if you need them (i.e. she's being unreasonable on all other concerns) or for the compromise. \n\nIf I may be so bold, I would like to suggest one point you might want to make: if you are caught (presumably you live in a place where weed is either illegal or banned in your apartment complex), you may lose the apartment (or be arrested but if it's illegal, she's probably already considered this consequence and therefor it will likely have no effect) and then you'd *both* be out of a place to live. This way it isn't just about you, but affects her as well. It would be a good idea to make some points that pertain to her. This will help strengthen your stance. \n\nB E | R E C E P T I V E\n------------------------\n\nShe might bring up a few good points. No matter how hard it is, be prepared to accept this. No matter how strongly you feel you are totally in the right, she probably has some viable concerns. \n\nFirst thing you should do is go through that bullet point list from above and try to predict what her arguments against each point will be. Not just that, but try to poke holes in your own argument. Play devil's advocate with yourself. \n\nThen, be prepared to accept some of these. You will have to respond to each of her arguments in the same way she will respond to yours. You cannot bulldoze over things she says because it stands in your way. \n\nSome possible things to consider: is she paying half the rent/bills? Then she might say (and rightly so!) that she has equal say in what goes on. I know someone mentioned the name on the lease thing, but I think if you bring that up that'll make her feel patronized, like you're letting her live there to be nice and she should be grateful. Again, this isn't me arguing with you, just helping you foresee some discussions. \n\nC O M P R O M I S E \n--------------------------\n\nBasically: be willing to bend a bit. \n\nYou're not likely to get her to see your side of things if you don't budge an inch. Let her win a little. Plus she's your roommate and you want both of you to be happy there otherwise that shit is a nightmare. \n\nSo perhaps ask her to go outside to smoke. That way you're not totally taking it away from her. If you're not comfortable with this (neighbors/passing police dogs might notice or you just really hate the smell), see if she would be okay just making edibles for when she's at home. You don't have to deal with the smell and she still gets high. Just make sure she labels that shit clearly. You don't want shark week to come and you get a chocolate craving and OH LOOK BROWNIES and next thing you know you are stoned off your face and coming up with inventions like the tamp*off* or some device that lets you charge your phone via kegels. \n\nD E S C R I P T I O N S\n-----------------------\n\nI said earlier (if you have read this far, CONGRATS. You have read a little over 5K words) that she is not privy to your pattern of thought. \n\nSo what you need to do is get into HER brainwave-length and help her come to the very same conclusion you did. \n\nThis is the time to try to put yourself in HER shoes. Try to figure out her reasons for wanting to smoke (does SHE want to be an inventor?) or for not wanting to go outside or whatever. Also look outside that. Where does she stand on certain issues?\n\nNow try to equate those to the issue at hand. \n\nUsing metaphors and such, use something totally different to illustrate your reasoning. \n\nOnce you've got that, move to another. And another. Instead of metaphors, try using her experiences to help. Then use your experiences. \n\nBasically, be ready to explain a few different ways before it really hits home. Even though she understands the words initially, the way to get her on your side is to get her to relate to them. \n\nBecause that's ultimately what you want to do: get her to understand you AND for you to understand her. \n\nQ U I C K | N O T E\n------------------\n\nIf she says she wants something that is kind of on the line of what you are trying to say, JUMP ON THAT SHIT. She might agree with some of the points you have (or you might agree with some of hers) without really realizing it. This could be from the explanation not being clear or the other just not getting it fully (very often, it'll be some choice of word that will cause it to click). So if she says something that is in line with what you want, be like, 'OMG YES I TOTALLY AGREE THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING SO YOU SEE ...' Finding something you both agree upon is going to do wonders for ending the argument peacefully. \n\nAnd don't think of an argument like a fight or contest. People often do and that is why these things blow up or get emotional. Think of it like you're haggling over a price. Or like you're trying to persuade her. That's really what you're doing: persuading and haggling. \n\nD I S C L A I M E R\n-------------------------\n\n***I am not a lawyer and I'm also not an expert in debate.

{"body": "Don takes a step from the open window, and begins his freefall down the McCann-Erickson office building. He has had a journey this season that should not have ended with a suicide but because it sounds neat to some people, he jumps. At his home eating dinner, jokelahoma, internet commenter, is all attention. This is what he wanted since the beginning. *For Don to jump...* He's squealing with delight as the hero of the story begins to accelerate, shouting \"YES! YES!\" and there's no music, only the sound of the wind in Don's ears and the flutter of his jacket. jokelahoma is shedding tears now, he's so happy. It sends shivers down his spine to think an alternative season where all episodes ended with a major character taking a dive from the building. It would be so cool. And as he thinks that, Don's head hits the Madison Avenue pavement and opens like a coconut, splattering blood and viscera on people. Jokelahoma cheers loudly the \"Guy Walks into an Advertising Agency\" reference. Millions of people are unsatisfied with this conclusion - why did Don die? But not jokelahoma. He's satisfied and happy. He's got the ending he wanted.

{"body": "Thanks all for the comments and encouragement: Result: AWESOME AMAZING WONDERFUL!!!\n\nI'd never been to a 12 step meeting before.  Here's what was  awesome:\n\n- Its only an hour\n- Its carefully timed and controlled by volunteers\n- The main thing is everyone gets to share (if they want)\n- Everyone is brutally honest\n- You are actually looking each other in the eye and admitting that you are an addict -- its soooo powerful, with porn especially, to actually see real people in person discussing their addiction, admitting it, and seeing that they are all, c l e a r l y , good people.  \n- In many ways, you get the best of the best of the 'no faps' -- the people who, like you, care so much that not only do they go on reddit, say, but that they actually are willing to go and help others in person\n- To be anonymous -- like reddit -- but in *real life* is a truly special sensation, and actually outside of 12 steps things I'm not sure where you really can get it.  In other words to share deep personal things where you are de facto anonymous.\n\nOther details:\nIn this particular case I went up to the most modest room ever, and there was some basic logistics and then sharing.\n\nThe shares were unbelievable in that they were honest, and just like everything talked about here and in nofap, etc. except you see the humanity.  In reddit world, its tough to actually notice the humanity of any of us -- I mean your text looks exactly like my text, which is whatever font this is, and there's very little 'real' there, although its better than nothing.  Believe me, seeing real people talk about their number of days sober, their daily struggles, the power of porn, etc., is something amazing. \n\nI didn't end up sharing, but would've by the end if there was more time.  \n\n**\"Sex\" vs Porn**:\n\nThis particular meeting had I'd guess 20 people. I'd guess maybe 40% were porn addicts, and others probably prostitution, gay sex, general sex, etc. addicts. \n\nIt was actually good to have porn mixed in with other sex addictions, because it was clear what they all have in common -- when a very normal, wonderful part of being human (our sexuality) becomes a source of uncontrollable addiction.  This is very different, obviously, than drugs, booze, or other 'external' type addictions.  So it was nice to have the non-porn varieties there too.\n\nSome shared about challenges they had that day, many shared about just how helpful it is to use their sponsors or go to meetings.  Some actually talked about their last relapse, that was yesterday.  A few discussed how they'd been sober for a long time (years) but still came to meetings to help remind them.\n\n**Helping**\n\nFinally, the biggest part for me was that it was SO helpful to me to hear each person, and I realized that it was so helpful to them to be listened to. And so I felt like just by going, even though I didn't share, I actually did something POSITIVE vis-a-vis my addiction.  So I felt like that was a big draw, that you go to a meeting, and what kept people coming back, you go to a meeting, and you share because you know it helps o t h e r   p e o p l e.\n\n**Higher Power**\n\nPeople here were fully free and easy with \"higher power\" meaning anything beyond the self -- there was as much meditation talk as anything and few people discussed 'god' in the traditional way -- actually no one did.  And, it was clear to me these two (of many) higher power angles: 1) that just by definition the fact that you have something you try to control but can't, that alone defines a 'higher power' and 2) The way we all depend on and can positively influence each other, that community thing, that is also a higher power.\n\nSo --- it was great!\n\n** Next step: **\nNot sure exactly what I'll do with this next.  Go to more meetings soon, in a week, get a sponsor, etc.\n\nOne thing I have to say is I'm 100% looking forward to going to the next one.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430880540", "subreddit": "pornfree", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't see that happening just because it would be a real pain in the ass to implement.  The way particle changes are handled right now, for things like Terrorblade's arcana and unusual spell effects is each part of the particle has an operator that overrides the colour by setting a control point to a x y z coordinate that corresponds to an RBG value.  So for this arcana to work they'd have to add this operator to every spell particle effect in the game and every spell that ever will be added to the game.  Even if they did this, you'd only have one shade of green, if you didn't want spells to become a green smear you'd have to have multiple controllers related to dark green, light green so there was some contrast to the spells and then have someone go through each spell in the game and redesign it using these few shades of green.  Even then, there are some particle textures that will become transparent when you try to change them to green, so for these you'd have to remake the spell completely, then you have to have code to tell the game to use this new spell effect when Rubick uses it with the arcana.

{"body": "&gt;- What is the difference between solo play and open play? Does your stuff carry over when you switch between solo and open?  \n  \nSolo is you and all the npcs, with a mild data connection to the server for updates when you move around and purchase and such.  Open is you, every other person in open and your instance and npcs, with a somewhat larger data connection for updates and peering with other players.\n\n&gt;- When you die, do you lose everything? Kind of like hardcore mode in Diablo?  If not, what are the consequence of dying in this game?  \n  \nYou don't die as far as the game is concerned.  Your ship is destroyed and you are emergency teleported infinite distance as necessary to get to your last docking area.  You then pay insurance for a new ship.  You may also possibly pay bounties on your head in a future update (soon tm).\n\n&gt;- How do I complete a delivery mission? For example, I accepted this one, it asked me to deliver this thing to X station. I went there, landed without asploding but then I didn't know what to do...  \n  \nVaries slightly, some give you an item to deliver.  Some give you a delivery 'item' but it doesn't take up cargo space.  Some require you to go find the item and deliver it.  For all, you go to the bulletin board at your destination and missions which can be turned in will be shown at the top.  Click then abd turn in the mission.\n\n&gt;- I took a mission to kill a hunter, mission said she was in X system, I went there but could never find her. How come? Is there something special we need to do for those kind of mission?  \n  \nThose missions are terrible.  I've never gotten one to work.\n\n&gt;- Is there a player driven auction house in this game?  \n  \nNo, there's not a player driven anything in game.  Everything player driven is organized out of game.\n\n&gt;- I find the galaxy map extremely confusing...  \n  \nIt's a 3D Map with a lot of settings and options.  It is confusing.  Ignore any trade data on the map it's always terrible.\n\n&gt;- Sometimes when I get a mission that his far away, I will simply run out of fuel, then I can't find a station to refill and just....die lol. Any tips?  \n  \nFuel scoop week let you refuel at any star labeled K G B F O A M.  Otherwise, when you plan your route on the map, when your line turns dotted it means you would be out of fuel at that point.\n\n&gt;- Finally Any general Tips for a new player? I've never ever played a space sim before...well to be honest I've never played a sim of anything before.  \n  \nCan't help you here, I leave this to others.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430921374", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[3x3-early-thread-edition.](http://i.imgur.com/uDCiOU8.jpg)\n\nPretty much only stuff that's new to me this week, lots of great discoveries to be honest, even if there's stuff I didn't enjoy as much aswell.\n\n**[Smog - Julius Caesar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWvDr9mkVV8)**\n\nI decided to listen to a Smog/Bill Callahan record a day for the rest of the week, to get a grip of his discography. I heard Dream River but I wasn't acquainted with anything else that Callahan had done. \n\nFirst one in line was Julius Caesar which I loved. I felt that it reminded of a more personal, less comic The Mountain Goats from their earlier days, while also having tracks that reminded me of a more \"*normal*\" Daniel Johnston. It felt like a great blend and a perfect match. His songwriting is really something extra and his most personal songs are incredibly touching. Album closer Stick In The Mud is one of the greatest album closers I've heard in a really long time.\n\n**[Negativland - Escape From Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTWCkE8nyTY)**\n\n*E L E V E N*\n\nGreat album of plunderphonics. Something in the middle of The Books and The Avalanches is a comparison I could do. The samples often stay ahead of the music making for atmosphere, narratives, themes over more musical events. It might not be a record I would recommend to people who are only acquainted with Since I Left You &amp; ...Endtroducing in the plunderphonics department and maybe something that would instead interest fans of The Books various works since it can be quite abstract at times. \n\nIt does contain some great memes though.\n\n*E L E V E N*\n\n**[Torres - Sprinter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVuC7mqjelU)** \n\nI had a lot of love for Torres' S/T debut that came out in 2013 and while I did enjoy Sprinter a lot, I do believe that S/T is a far superior record as far as songwriting and variation go. What Sprinter does have to hold against S/T is that I do find it to be a lot more personal and a lot more straightforward at times, which is something I find to be great. An example of this would be album closer The Exchange which does something that you can't really compare to the more ordinary tracks of off S/T. I do however believe that Torres needs to do something more for her next album because this was pretty much just more of the same and I don't think that would work as well as it has another time around.\n\n*The rest...*\n\n**Frengers** - Gave it a go since I most likely will hear, rate and review the new Mew record in the coming days and I thought I should atleast hear something they've previously made before. Frengers was overall pretty enjoyable, not much else to say about it.\n\n**Blonde On Blonde** - How has it taken me this long to get around to hearing this? Completely blows away all the other Dylan records I've previously heard and I definitely see how this is a Scaruffi nine.\n\n**In Utero** - Maybe I just grew out of Nirvana? Maybe I'd have loved this 5 years ago? I'm not sure. I unfortunately don't care for In Utero.\n\n**Repeater** - Need to give this another chance. Recently listened to a ton of Post-Hardcore and I'd probably like this more if I gave it another spin.\n\n**Pinkerton** - I still don't care for Weezer at all. Can't stand Cuomo's lyrics and they mainly feel like a emo/pop-punk influenced Pavement wannabe. El Scorocho is pretty great though I'll give them that.\n\n**MCIII** - Forgetable.

{"body": "I'm a stupid American who only knows English so I can't really read the link you posted, so I'll just try to go off of what you said.\n  \nI doesn't have to be related to G at all. That's kind of the point. For ANY set I, we get a group Func(I,G). I'm sure you've learned about Cartesian products of groups, so maybe your question is how Func(I,G) is related to the I-fold cartesian product.\n  \nLet's think of a simple example where I = {x} is a set with one element that I've called x. What is Func(I,G)? It's the collection of all set maps from {x} into G. Now if I have two functions f,g from I to G, I can multiply them to get a new function.\n  \nHow do we do this? Well, we need to define what f\\*g is on every element of I, that is, we need f\\*g(x). We define this to be f(x)\\*g(x). Now, as you've verified, we have a group.\n  \nBut what group is it? In this case, it's not just any group. It turns out that we actually get G back! How? Well, define a function from Func(I,G) to G, defined by sending f to f(x). Check this is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective. So it is an isomorphism.\n  \nNow what if I = {x,y} has two elements? Now functions f from I to G pick out two elements of G: f(x) and f(y). Again, define a map from Func(I,G) to G x G that sends a function f to the ordered pair (f(x), f(y)). Check this is an isomorphism.\n  \nWhat is the moral of this? A function f from I to G *is the same* as choosing |I| elements of G, where |I| is the size of I. That is, if I has n elements, then Func(I,G) is precisely the n-fold cartesian product G x G x ... x G. Even if I is infinite, this still holds, but now we have an infinite cartesian product, and the factors are indexed by the elements of I.\n  \nWhat do I mean by this last line? Well, go back to the example when I = {x,y}. We showed that Func(I,G) = G x G, and the first factor of G was like the x-factor, and the second factor of G was like the y-factor. The standard notation for such a cartesian product is G^(I).\n  \nWhen the author writes f = (f(i))_i, he is explicitly writing out the isomorphism from Func(I,G) to G^(I). On the left we have a function f, and on the right we have an element of G^(I), which is by definition an ordered tuple of elements of G indexed by elements of I.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430953518", "subreddit": "learnmath", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Honestly I thought that as well at first, and a lot of my issue learning the IG was with the buff management. It can be a massive pain in the ass to always hit the part you want to hit, aside from a few monsters who just make it easy.\n\nThe red buff is absolutely central to doing well with the IG, and it's definitely the easiest to land. A shot to the head and that secures you a 20% boost in damage, extra hits with each attack, and an endless combo (topple a monster, have your red active, and you can X X A X X A over and over, as the monster being in the way keeps you from stepping forwards) and a lot of monsters have secondary locations that are also red, like a Rathalos' talons, Rathian's tail, or Zinogre's front paws.\n\nThe white buff is the next useful, and the one that's probably the next most annoying to keep active. It's mostly applied to a monster's legs unless they're clearly used for offense (ex. Rathalos talons or Zinogre front claws). However, it makes you absolutely rocket into the air and having it up has, in many cases, allowed to to smack an escaping wyvern back down to the ground when it tried to escape or just to fly around at all. Plus it feels damn good. You can definitely see a difference when you have white buff active on your movement speed, and it makes dodge and retaliating that much smoother.\n\nThe orange buff is the one I have the most issue with. It's undeniably useful, giving you a defense boost, super armor on all your attacks, and the same effect as low grade earplugs, but the hitboxes are all over the place: lower on the Rath's necks, the chest of some monsters, only the back of another, yadda yadda. The general rule of thumb is the torso/body area though, and that causes issues when you have monsters with legs, wings, or heads flailing around constantly getting in the way of your Kinsect's flight path. And yes, inevitably there will be some IG main who jumps in and reminds you that you can alter the path of your Kinsect midflight to hit hard to reach places, but that requires that you not use the pheremone shot at all and that's required in a lot of instances to get juices.\n\nCase and point: consider a Rathalos. You can get red buff almost immediately, the moment it turns to look at you fire your kinsect straight ahead. It bows its head down to roar, Kinsect snags a red, recall it for your first buff. \n\nThe white is pretty simple as well, but requires a bit more set up. You almost have to hit the pheremone shot on a wing to get your Kinsect to connect the hit, otherwise you're more liable to hit just the legs as the wings are elevated higher than the head is most of the time. Luckily, the Rathalos flaps its wings rather slowly, so it isn't TOO hard to land a pheremone shot. \n\nThen comes the orange. With its head flailing about with every fireball, its body rotating with every tail swipe, and its wings flapping anytime the damn thing seems to take a step, trying to get a shot in at the body can be an absolute nightmare. \n\nThis is where you have the guys who tell you to get your buffs after you've toppled a monster with the white or white/red buffs active. Then you either go for the buffs immediately and spend the rest of the topple duration smashing it in the face, or go for your damage first and try to peg it with a pheremone shot or Kinsect hit at the last few seconds. Another method of marking a monster is by pressing R at any point during an attack animation. You'll then do another attack, but this one isn't particularly powerful and only does impact damage. However, you hit the monster with the other side of the Glaive and mark whatever part you hit with the pheremone marker. So if you're up close you can potentially mark any part of a monster if it's reasonably sized and you're good about your positioning/attack choice. \n\nEven with all these options though, sometimes you still won't get the buff you necessarily want when you necessarily want it with a monster's body parts always moving around. Even dumping straight Speed+ Nectars into my Kinsect, most of them are level 4-6 Kinsects with at least Speed Up S at this point, I have a hard time getting the hits on the parts I want, with or without markers. The red and the white buffs have become easier over time, but the ever elusive orange buff is still a bit of a pain to get when my red and white buffs are running out and I wanna get that amazing triple buff to give myself a longer duration, and increase the percent boosts from the red and orange buffs further.\n\nAnd none of this is even mentioning the green buff, which on a few occasions has actually saved me from carting, and usually by complete accident. For instance, with a Rathalos you can hit any part of the wing and get white buff. However with a Rath*ian* if you hit the tip of the wing, where there's bone and flesh not flap, you get the green buff. It's not a strong heal, but it's there and if you ever need to you can tag that wingtip and get 30 seconds (the mark duration) of constantly sending out the Kinsect to heal up.\n\nAll in all, the main two buffs that you want (red and white) aren't too hard to maintain. You can actually get by just fine with just the red buff, so it makes sense that it's the easiest to get. At first juggling the buffs is definitely a chore, but just like with actual chores the more you do them the faster you find ways to do them. What used to take you half an hour when you got home from school ends up taking you five or ten minutes. The same with buffs. At this point anytime I'm too far away for an attack, or just notice that it's starting to fade, it's nothing to send out a speedy Kinsect and refresh the buff for my red. White is about the same. So long as you're fighting a medium sized monster, keeping up the basic buffs isn't too bad once you get the hang of firing the Kinsect. However, I would strongly advise against using a Glaive that doesn't have a Kinsect with at least, or very near to, 100 speed. Otherwise it's just too damn slow and you'll miss more often than not. The Kinsect can't swap out buffs so if you hit the wrong part you've gotta recall it and try again, and a slow Kinsect really makes the time tick by.\n\nAll in all, stopping for a fraction of a second, or simply running straight ahead and firing the Kinsect while I'm closing in (it doesn't interrupt a running animation) isn't too much of a cost to consider. I find myself being more hyper aggressive with a Glaive than I do with the SnS, although that might just be because I've mistrained myself with the SnS. Keeping up the red buff is all you strictly NEED to do with a Glaive and it's relatively simple, so you can easily keep hacking away just like a Sword user.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1430962720", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Basically throwing everything I've got except the final X slash which is meh in damage overall.\n\nThe rest of the time I'm dodging and just trying to get hits in when I can, but the overall attack pattern usually revolves around trying to bait the monster over to ledges I can mount it from, since I want to try and break as much as I can off of the things but quite a lot of monsters have parts too high to reach. I've never really tried using barrel bombs or traps unless it was part of a preplanned strategy to keep myself ahead of the curve, like when I was solo farming the multiplayer Gore when I was still a scrub and learning the game. I guess I've just never gone out to gather all the mats for them, and don't like having to buy anything not strictly necessary since I've got like twelve SnSes or so to keep upgraded, a handful of Bows, and about six Glaives.

{"body": "Yikes I didn't know it was possible to be &lt;1K unless you tried.\n\nI'll tell you one tip that makes a big difference until you get to low 2K. Learn to last hit creeps. In the laning phase it is NOT about getting kills. It's about getting as much gold from creeps before everyone has lvl 6 and starts ganking. It isn't about getting towers either. It's said if you can get 50creeps in the first 10m you're good (although probably wont happen in a &lt;3k game).\n\nThere is a last hit training called \"Last hit practice\" where you use a simple hero (idr actually) and \"Last hit training\" where you get harassed a lot if you go mid lane so go safelane. I tried it with lycan wolves and managed to get 85 which is more than you can get in the last even if you hit 100%. Without using the forest I can get 60\n\nYou might want to try this for fun. Pick blood seeker. Get these skills in order Q E E W E Ult E W W W Ult Q Q Q. Go into the forest and lvl 1 forest by placing Q on the first creep, kill it then put Q on yourself and kill the other two. Get these items in order (I can do it without tangos or going to fountain for heal) courier, Tango, Stout Shield, Quelling blade, Blade of attack (at lvl 3 and this you can start killing the big creep camp if they're not hellbears), flying courier, Blade of attack, boots (which make phase), Blade Mail then either BKB or Skadi. Then make Helm of domination then a dmg item like basher or MKB. \n\nYou should get lvl 6 before 7m (and before mid reaches level 7). Then go to any lane and rupture for them (dont try to fight without allies cause you're weak). When you have BM you can start 1v1 heros. Basically you do rupture, walk up to them for 2seconds (to see if they stand still or run) use W then phase at them and press blademail if you have it.

{"body": "A dozen stink bug corpses dropped into Sammy’s hair. She shrieked and frantically shook her thick curls out. The attic trapdoor hadn’t been opened in years and this was a nice present for its first visitor. Here take these exoskeletons. Sammy gathered herself and went up the ladder. The stale musty air punched Sammy in the face. \n\nHer mother told her that it was in the attic or at least that’s where she thought it had put it all those years ago. It wasn’t the most confidence inspiring of recollections but if her mother said it would help her father feel better it was the least she could do. Nobody ever said hospice was fun.\n\nSammy turned the electric lantern on and place it up over the lip of the attic floor. She popped her head through the hole and surveyed the cobwebbed landscape. If it was up here it was not sitting out in the open. With her arms on both sides of the floor she hoisted herself up. A small sting made her slap her neck. “Dammit!” She whipped her head around just in time to see the lantern topple past her and smash onto the hallway floor below. Sammy cried out. \n\nAlone in the dark attic Sammy felt the sweat bead on her neck, a mix of stale heat and fright. The meager light cast up from below gave everything an ethereal look. Sammy began fumbling around above her head for the pull string of light. She felt the string and was about to give it a firm yank when she heard paper rustling in the corner. From the sound it was bigger than a mouse, maybe a squirrel. \n\n“Please be nothing.”\n\n“That’s exactly how I’ve felt.”\n\n“Oh my god. Oh my god. Who said that?!” Sammy shouted.\n\nThe dim glow of crudely strung foot high Christmas lights circled the room. “I was beginning to think I would be alone forever. Please don’t be afraid.” The old construction paper doll struggled to rise on its dusty pipe cleaner feet with the help of makeshift paintbrush cane. \n\nSammy stumbled backwards and collapsed on her butt. Memories of this piece of 'art' rushed back to her. It had hung on her parents fridge for years. ‘S a m M m y’ was scrawled across its chest. \n\n“Hi, I’m SamMmy.”\n\n“Me...me...too.”\n\n“I knew if I left the offering on the altar you would come. I’m ready to come home now. I’m sorry.”\nSammy rose to her feet. She trembled with each step. SamMmy shook at the same frequency. She crossed the attic towards SamMmy’s makeshift nest of shredded insulation. “Ready?”\n\nSamMmy raised her construction paper tube arms. “Time to go home?”\n\nShe delicately held the paper doll and lightly blew the dust bunnies off. “Good as new.” SamMmy’s paper mouth crinkled into a smile. \n\nAs they crossed the attic threshold SamMmy went limp in Sammy’s arms. She ran down the stairs like a child. Her heart was racing. Outside the living room she caught her breath. \n\n“Mom, Dad! Look what I found!” Sammy held up the paper doll. A giant smile crept slowly across her father’s face. \n\n“Put that right here next to me, baby.” Her father asked between labored breaths. Sammy sat the doll onto the table next to her father’s bed. \n\n“Now it feels like home,” her father said as he closed his eyes. \n\n\n\n....edit : spelling/grammar\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431095188", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "0.0.9\n\nIt’s that time again!\n\nA not insignificant number of changes in this build, such as the game now being ~ w i d e s c r e e n ~, with an accompanying UI overhaul, and Wordsmiths not being entirely useless! Also, there’s a Daily Run mode! I’m still working out some kinks though, so everyone’s levels and kids might not be as-exactly-the-same as I’d like for them to be eventually – especially between different OSes. There’s also a lack of proper Leaderboards and such, which will also be coming in the future. But hey, the foundation is laid, just needs to be built upon, now!\n\nFor the next month I’ll be focusing on finishing up the Poet (finally), adding the long-awaited new class, and working a bit more on the Daily Runs – in addition to some Secret Things that I’ll not speak of here. I also anticipate touching up the level generator a bit, with new rooms and some funky new transitional stages, as well as more fundamental changes that’ll become necessary as I progress on to the Anticropolis.\n\nFull changelog below:\n\nFixes\n\n    Crash when gorhound corpses are destroyed\n    Pressure plates aren’t properly held down by the player\n    Class abilities don’t appear when equipped to the third spell slot\n    Controllers rumble when not in use\n    Can’t walk on lava with boots of gossamer \n    Corrected text descriptions for certain Boons\n    “Stuck!” text and noise spamming when in contact with purple slime\n    Aiming boulders downward with Trajectory kills you\n    Grumbuls spaz out in water\n    Armless enemies still punch\n    Legless enemies are mad whack\n    Flame Wave direction doesn’t change through portals\n    Can take damage when going through the exit door\n    Can unstow and hold items without arms\n    Entering a level with one leg causes kids to fly upwards\n    The Reaper can strand player in the reaper room if distracted by another enemy\n    Black Chests can spawn Growth\n    Spells from the Black Chest twitch oddly\n    Spells from the Black Chest can be stown\n    Reaper’s diving spin attack is basically instant-kill (oops)\n    Some bugs with properly choosing keyboard and gamepad inputs\n    Twins exit door can spawn on top of entrance door\n    Reaper gets drawn behind the environment after doing its super\n    Skeletal Mages leave no corpses\n    Black Chest missing noise when opened\n    Boulders don’t release properly when grabbed for rolling\n    Crash when throwing a bottle of goo or slime through a torch\n    Flame Wave doesn’t change direction through portals properly\n    Dragon’s Breath doesn’t ignite explosive gas\n    Overloaded Frost Bolt (Glacial Grinder) doesn’t cost a charge star\n    Overloaded Slow (Pause) doesn’t cost a charge star\n    Crash when sprinting up walls with glacial footwear\n    Pouncing on frozen enemies is mad whack\n\nNew Stuff\n\n    UI overhaul\n    Daily Run Mode (WIP)\n    Wordsmith Charged Tome abilities\n\nChanges\n\n    Duelist now slows all enemies on screen, not just the ones targeting you\n    Added targeting reticle to duelist\n    Overwhelming made more visually obvious\n    Max HP caps out at 25\n    Spellbooks are destroyed after one use\n    Crush/Spike traps no longer trigger at all with boots of gossamer\n    Spellbooks can only be used once\n    Tome abilities come out much faster\n    Failing to identify a potion now results in a message\n    Might is now called Might instead of Strength sometimes\n    Disarm and Extra Tough switched places in the boon order\n    Byat holes now spawn a maximum of 5 Byats\n    Fire and Ice Tome attack burns for a shorter duration\n    “Pickpocket” changed to “Pilfer”\n    “Pilfer” steals shoes, hats, and weapons from enemies if you are shoeless, hatless, or unarmed\n    Portal no longer illuminates the darkness\n    Can no longer move portal outside of the view when aiming it\n    Poisoned slime poisons enemies when used to blind them\n    Can now aim Tome spells\n    Headless skeletons are blind\n    Tier 3 taunt no longer grants might\n    Tier 2 taunt weakness wears off faster\n    Shopkeeper gets mad a little more easily\n    Spirit followers have slightly more hp\n    Spirit followers shoot faster\n    Spirit followers don’t return to you between shots\n    Ogo now ignore wooden platforms like oog do\n    Enemies become more aggressive when taunted\n    Alterations to Reaper\n    -of Stopping procs less frequently and for a shorter duration\n    Striking paused foes always unpauses them\n    Shadow Cloak lasts slightly longer\n    Tomes attacks cost the same amount, regardless of entities affected\n    Tomes start with more charges\n    Temporal Tricks’ Tome attack deals damage now\n    Enemies have a brief warning before casting spells or executing any nonstandard moves\n    Most trances last longer\n    Charge stars restore energy when used\n    Charge stars auto-collect (like coins) if any trances or overloads are empty [experimental]\n    Spellwright’s aimed spells are no longer offset in front of you\n    Tomes don’t consume book charges if they fail\n\nNext Build TO-DO\n\n    Finish Poet (For Realsies)!\n    New Class (FOR REALSIES)!\n    Daily Run Leaderboard / General Stat-Tracking", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431103096", "subreddit": "CatacombKids", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Holy fucking shit the advice on this sub has officially gone blue pill.\n\n&gt;Let's start this off by noting that I am married to a single mother.\n\n&gt;So my wife, being in the fitness industry has become relatively obsessed with the attention that comes with instagram likes and the guys that comment on her posts.\n\ngg no re, this is all you need to know she is a TE R R I B L E prospect. Even if her first babydaddy died. Single Moms are AWFUL for anything romantic, even plates. Especially to a damn Man worth a damn (which you claim you are).\n\n&gt;it's all professional\".\n\nYah, professional whoring.\n\n&gt; I'm struggling with this as I've become a large part of her sons life as the bio father isn't around and I genuinely feel a duty to him in terms of providing an upbringing he wouldn't have otherwise.\n\nWhat kind of pussy feels this? You're rationalizing bro. Where's your fuckin pride? Do you get off of being a cuckold, do you not want your wife to respect you, do you want her to continue cheating on you? You're raising another dude's spawn who, no matter how you spin it, nailed &amp; bailed. He nailed and bailed a younger, sexier version of your wife, impregnated her and then made YOU raise the spawn while he's out there probably rinsing and repeating. \n\nMan up and cut ties, you caught one of the worst oneitis I've ever seen.\n\n\n&gt;To start things off, I'm a successful 30 year old male in a large corporation, I'm good at what I do and I enjoy doing it. I've had financial success, drive a badass car, I've lifted nearly every day for the past 10 years so I'm in above average shape. My wife is an extreme fitness nut and has big tits and a tight body. I have things many wish they could have. Sorry to brag but that is the set up.\n\nIf any of this shit is true, get a divorce and get you a nice, young, fit &amp; sexy girl that looks better than your current fitness slutty wife (not hard with your resume &amp; further resources here on TRP) and move on. Right now you're being held back greatly by this bitch. At first it will probably suck and you'll miss her after 7 years, but with your value you will QUICKLY build yourself a soft harem and those emasculating feelings will go away. \n\nBut why do I have a feeling you will continue to be cuckolded and ignore all of this shit.\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431109196", "subreddit": "asktrp", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

We are looking for high quality raiders to fill main raid spots, and also a few to fill any potential sub spots.    \n**Raid Times:**  \n*Tuesday:* 8:00PM-11:00PM  \n*Wednesday:* 8:00PM-11:00PM   \n*Thursday:* 8:00PM-11:00PM  \nAll times are in PST    \n**What we expect from you:**  \n*-Good attitude:* \"We either succeed as a team, or we will die as individuals\" -- Al Pacino  \n*-Minimum 685IL:* While we are willing to help people who are a little behind the curve in IL, we need to at least know that you can get to a moderate level independently.   \n*-Near 100% Attendance:* obviously emergencies happen, but if work/school/real life gets in the way too often, it becomes a problem.   \n*-Sufficient Knowledge of Your Class &amp; Spec:* We expect you to understand all of the ins and outs of your class. We do not want one-spec wonders, if suddenly another talent tree of your class becomes better, we expect you to be able to switch to that spec and perform at the same level.    \n\n**What to expect from us:**  \n*-High Level Progression:* We are playing this game to succeed. We want it, you want it, let's make it happen   \n*-Professional Drama-Free Environment:* Drama happens, especially under high stress progression. We aim to end it immediately and swiftly.   \n*-Friendly Environment:* We are all friends in this guild. But we can never have too many friends. We want you to be here, but we also want you to want to be here.   \n*-Extra Resources:* When you become a main raider, we have feasts/flasks/pots provided for you. Plus we all have each other to bounce information off of.

Then an ego for $65 which broke after a fortnight. Then my daughter was 4 weeks old and I knew I needed to pack in the fags; Chris from 2vaped did a Q n A session thread, and off the back of that I bought an MVP2 from him.

Violent. There's a difference that is hard to voice. \n\nIf I was with someone and they told me they weren't going to be rough with me when I asked them to, just because they thought it was unhealthy or violent, I'd be A- pissed that they don't think I'm capable of making my own choices and knowing my limits and B- dreading sex because vanilla sex for the rest of my life sounds  b o r i n g  as hell\n\nIf her neck hurt afterwards, you probably choked her wrong. No choking is ever completely safe, but the best way to do it is to put pressure on the side of her neck, to slow blood flow to the brain. That way she can still talk because she can still breathe. \n\nIt'd be best to talk to her and ask her about what she likes, what her limits are, what your limits are, concerns. Everything. Sit down and talk about everything. \n\nWhenever someone chokes me I put my hand around their arm/wrist so if it gets too much I can squeeze their arm and they know to back off. I've never had neck pain afterward. \n\nYou should also maybe go check out r/BDSM or r/bdsmcommunity and look around and ask for help on how to do the things correctly and how to reduce the risks.

I bought an Egyptian oud last year, so I thought I'd try the same thing.\n\n*Oud*: This thing is fretless and a bit awkward to hold, but you can get some cool sounds from it.

Turkish tuning is typically a whole step higher. Like a guitar, it's all 4ths and one 3rd interval between F and A. The four higher courses are technically just like the lower four strings on a guitar, and the drone string (and sometimes the lowest course too) is often tuned to match the key of whatever fancy *makam* you're playing.\n\nAnyway sorry to butt in with a relatively unpopular instrument, I just found that simply typing this was helpful for myself and who knows, maybe there are a few other oud players around...\n\nEdit: in case anyone is interested, check [this](http://dennishavlena.com/oud.htm) out to tune your guitar like an oud!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431178225", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 28, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Absolutely. \n\nI grew up Mormon. All of my family is Mormon. 90% of my high school and town and friends were Mormon. It was my lifestyle, but I wasn't ever really into it. I did it, because I thought I had to, and because my parents made me, but my heart was never there. \n\nAfter spending my early 20's partying, feeling guilty, repenting and going to church, then continuing the cycle, I thought hey, maybe going to BYU-I will put me on the correct Mormon path. So I went, and I was totally wrong. \n\nWithin the first two weeks of my first semester, I met my now-husband (of course I did), Rob. He was a fresh RM, went to BYU-I to escape his family, and was a complete guilt-ridden mess. He hated the church, hated serving a mission, and the guilt he felt because he hated it so much was making him depressed. Lucky for him, he met one of the few girls there that felt the same way (or that would at least admit it). We immediately hit it off. \n\nI was living at The Ridge with 5 other girls. We weren't exactly friends, but they would have boys stay over and no one cared. Rob ended up staying the night several times. We were having sex. Direct violations of the honor code. His roommates had an intervention with him because he wasn't coming home at night. Whatever, semester ended, winter break.\n\nWe come back in January for the next semester. He is living in the same place but I moved in with my best friend on the opposite side of campus. Rob's luggage got lost at the airport, he didn't have any of his stuff (or blankets, sheets, bathroom things), so I let him stay with me for a few nights. My bff didn't care. Our other roommate was an Korean exchange student, she didn't give a shit. \n\nAbout a week into the semester, we all get phone calls from the honor code office. They want all of us to come in at separate times to talk. I was the first to go. Terrified, I had no idea what this was about. Sister King, I believe her name was, was the Dean of the Honor Code (gag). She asked me if my boyfriend had been sleeping over. No. She asked if we were having sex. No. She knew I was lying. This woman, SHE KNEW EVERYTHING. E V E R Y T H I N G. She knew things that happened the last semester at The Ridge, when I had different roommates (of which I didn't keep in contact with). She knew things that had happened just in this past week of being at school, in my new apartment. She knew things that only Rob and I knew. I know my BFF didn't tell her anything (who also didn't know the things Sister King knew); we have been friends for over 15 years and she'd never rat me out (plus she was way worse than I was).\n\nAfter I left her office, I call Rob. \"She knows everything; we are fucked\". Sister King told me she is going to talk to everyone I know to find out the truth. Shit. Rob and I immediately went back to her office and confessed (except for having sex. But SHE KNEW!). We didn't want to drag roommates into this. We were able to get tuition back, but we didn't just get kicked out of school, we got kicked out of our apartments too (BYU-I approved housing). We had 3 days to find a way to pack all of our stuff and leave Rexburg (Rob and I were both from different states, me in the West, him in the South). No cars, little money, didn't matter. We had to GTFO. \n\nI called my family, my non-Mormon sister (2 out of 9 of us are exmos) answered the phone. I told her what happened and she starts laughing. She tells all my siblings that were over, laughing. My mother, not laughing. Rob's family, dear god that was a nightmare. It took them about 4 years to fully accept me, and I still think deep down they blame me for his falling out of the church. They have no idea; I fucking saved him. I gave him the courage he needed to be honest with himself about this god damn cult we were raised in. Honestly, he would most likely be considering suicide if he would have stayed in the church. He was spiraling into a deep depression when we met. \n\nI don't know why I thought I needed to get back onto the Mormon path. I would have gotten kicked out anyways because I never went to church in Rexburg. I remember in my eternal marriage class having a panic attack when the teacher asked me a question. I never felt at peace or any type of spiritualism. I felt anxious and uncomfortable. Spending a semester with those people and those stupid fucking honor code rules showed me how much I didn't want that in my life.\n\nI'm happy I got kicked out. Having to tell people for the rest of my life I got a degree from BYU-I would be completely embarrassing, especially because I would feel the need to explain, I'm not Mormon, after. I graduated from an awesome university since then and loved not having a midnight curfew as a grown ass adult.\n\nTo this day, I still have no idea how she knew all of those things. Cameras? Spies? Fuck, most likely. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431209114", "subreddit": "exmormon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

This happens if you cut from 37 cards from top. \n\nThere is couple of places (namely 34 from top and 45 from the top) which will result 3rd land in 5th and 4th land in 8th turn. All other cuts will give him a decent curve up to 4-5th land. \n\nAnd also by looking the pattern of his starting hand, player can determine when he will draw his lands. When we consider typical deck have 24-26 lands he will have much better opening hands. and better curve. And who feels suspicious after four riffle shuffles in an FNM even he mana weaved? Most of us wouldn't. Until this comment. :D\n\nStay tuned for my further analysis of how mana weaving - riffle shuffle - opponent cut routine can be exploited and how to spot that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431219454", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In all honesty your stats are too low to be doing it quickly. You'll probably get 6min kills, zulrah is profit if you get the kill but if you don't then it's a loss. With your stats you'll need to kill it asap because the longer you take the more food you'll use. Even at 119cb and 96 range and magic there are still times I use up all my food even with a 2minute kill. There isn't anything you can do about being combo'd out but the quicker you do damage the faster it'll die. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Wfzm8jz.png\n\n1st part is ALWAYS the green form, 2 is when it changes. Open that on your desktop and make it as big as you can. It'll be confusing at first to follow and you will get lost and die because you can't remember what comes next, but the more you do it the easer it'll become. R and M means protect RANGE and MAGIC then switch, so R M R M R M R then it'll move. M means protect MAGE so M R M R M R then it'll change and the pattern will start over and become a new phase. You need to learn all 4 because you wont kill it in time before it starts a new rotation.\n\nBut I do suggest getting higher prayer (70) Void range/mage and getting your range and magic up to 85. If you can't afford to chin/ice barage I suggest doing barrows with your stats until you can afford it.\n\nYes, you can kill zulrah with your stats but they'll be slow kills and slow kills means slow money. Barrows is better money per hour for me and I average 2 minute kills at zulrah. I'm 100% sure you can do it, but even if you get the patterns and pray switching down you'll still die all the time because you have low magic and defence, magic is also 1/4th of your magic defence level.

{"body": "Lux and Orianna are two of the champions who deal with Karthus best, mostly because they can reliably poke him from out of Q range. Karthus does better against champions like Ahri and Zed who must engage if they want to do more than tickle you.\n\nOk, for laning in general, you want to run Flash/Exhaust on Karthus. It makes Q dueling vs melee champions extremely potent and discourages all-in attempts because of the damage reduction. Ignite is a waste on Karthus, who typically never runs out of damage and is more reliant on being able to land Q over and over.\n\nW is defensive or gank only. Don't use it to start a duel, when you 1v1 an enemy they can pay attention to your Qs and dodge most of them. You really want to be using it when enemies have nowhere else to go, or when their path is 90% predictable. E is ONLY defensive or teamfight until you have it maxed out, it can rapidly bring you to 0 mana. \n\nNow, for landing Q. The best time to hit an enemy champion in a 1v1 lane is when they are beginning their AA windup. Place it directly under their feet when you see them starting to attack a creep, and the will either cancel their AA and miss the CS or take a decent chunk of damage. This is RARE. Most players know what Karthus wants to do and will avoid it at all costs, because they know how powerful Karth is if he gets enough pressure to get into the middle of the wave. Usually Karth makes lanes farmfests because nobody really wants to try going toe-to-toe with him; he never loses! Keep your sidelanes warded and keep track of the enemy mid's wards so you can help your jungler find a clear path to engage, THEN W and Q to follow up.\n\nFor early build Karthus is always going to get Tear into RoA because Seraph's + RoA are basically his best items (he wants to die, but slowly, and in the center of a fight while taking as much enemy focus as possible) Against a Zed or LB you could consider Zhonya's or Abyssal instead of RoA respectively, but flat HP is just so strong, so a speedy RoA is usually the best option.\n\nRemember, Karthus has mediocre ratios, but his damage skyrockets the longer he stays alive and has mana to keep E on and Q on CD. Hence, build AP bruiser instead of pure damage.\n\nNow, Luden's Karthus is absolutely viable against a team with no real engage threat, it maximizes your push potential and lets your R do silly things as a fight-starter. I would not recommend the item in most cases, Karthus has too many other items he needs to build (Seraph's Zhonya's Void Deathcap Sorcs, and usually RoA, but that is kind of the luxury item). However, he is like Anivia in that as long as you build defensive stats along with offensive ones, you can't really go wrong. Every item has its place on Karthus, but the times when he is strongest are against teams that won't build heavy defense. He isn't a tank shredder like Cassiopeia, he is an anti-squishy DPS. Karthus thrives against champions that consider MR to be a wasted stat because, guess what? If you build damage and mass nuke Karthus, he still gets 7 seconds to Q Q Q R and shatter your HP bars.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431293743", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The modes of the major scale are special. That collection of notes—the white keys of the piano, for example—is called the **diatonic collection.** It has a lot of neat properties, one of them being that the diatonic collection can be rearranged into a stack of perfect fifths. So instead of arranging the major scale by the following semitone intervals: 2-2-1-2-2-2-1, you can arrange them by gaps of 7 semitones each.\n\n    C   D   E   F   G   A   B\n      2   2   1   2   2   2  1\n\nbecomes\n\n    F   C   G   D   A   E   B\n      7   7   7   7   7   7   \n\nYou can keep going, and continue the string of fifths in either direction:\n\n    Db Ab Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# \n\nIf you put a box around any set of seven contiguous letter names, you get a diatonic collection. So box all the white notes [F C G D A E B], and you get C major/A minor/F lydian/etc. Move your box one note over to the right [C G D A E B F#], and you now get G major/E minor/C lydian etc. This is the one note difference that you are talking about. This is also why changing your diatonic collection by one pitch also moves the scale by fifth.\n\nThis is a very cool property that is only possible with certain collections of pitches.\n\nMelodic minor is not one of these cool collections. Its notes cannot be stacked in perfect fifths. So it won't have all those neat connections that make the diatonic collection so interesting theory-wise (although it obviously sounds interesting music-wise).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431349740", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.*, which ruled some income taxes to be unconstitutional was mooted by the 16th amendment.\n\n&gt;Obviously Congress can reverse Marbury v Madison based upon Article 5 of the 14th.\n\nYou already raised this point.  I don't think you understand the purpose of the clause.  It simply states that Congress can make laws to enforce the provisions of that particular amendment. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 19th, 20th (sort of), 23rd, 24th, 26th all have identical or very similar language in them.  I fail to see how this clause of the 14th somehow grants Congress the ability to overturn Supreme Court rulings by legislation.\n\n&gt;So if Congress determines that Congress and not the SCOTUS determines what is constitutional, what then?\n\nHow, exactly would Congress do this?  Baring an amendment to remove the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court is, in effect, the Judicial branch, and as such, rules (by precedent if nothing else) on the constitutionality of laws.\n\n&gt;no one wants a stable system anymore, we just want still H O P E &amp; C H A N G E\n\nWay to keep the discussion on point!

{"body": "Alright then, so if you go on your keyboard and start on C and play just the white keys, you get a C major scale. The notes that you're playing are C D E F G A B C. You use the notes of the C major scale to get the chords in the key of C major. A chord is a root note, a third and a fifth, which ends up being every other note in the scale. Spelled out, we get C-E-G, D-F-A, E-G-B, F-A-C, G-B-D, A-C-E and B-D-F. If you play through them, you'll get both major and minor chords (and one diminished chord, but that's not too important right now).\n\nIn any major key the order of major and minor chords is always the same, and it's written as I ii iii IV V vi vii°. Capital Roman numerals symbolize major chords, and lowercase symbolize minor chords. (Lowercase with a ° is diminished, again, not too important right now). Apply this to the chords we just built in C, and we get C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, and B diminished. I just remember I, IV, and V = major (pretty much your basic chords for blues and rock), and ii, iii, and vi are minor.\n\nFirst step is memorizing how the chords are spelled, and whether they're major or minor. To go from a major chord to a minor you lower the third (middle note in the chord) by a half-step, so C minor would be spelled C-Eb-G, F minor would be F-Ab-C, and G minor would be G-Bb-D. To go from minor to major you raise the third by a half step. So D major would be D-F#-A, E major would be E-G#-B, and A major is A-C#-E. (And, for reference, a B major is B-D#-F# and B minor is B-D-F#). Note that we're not changing the spelling of the chord when we alter it, meaning if a C major is C-E-G, then a C minor is C-Eb-G, not C-D#-G even though they would technically sound the same.\n\nBy learning how the chords are spelled, you're also learning fragments of different scales, as well as being able to count up in fifths.\n\nPut into practice, let's say I need to know the key signature for E major. Easiest way to start is by writing out the alphabet starting on E, so E F G A B C D E. Rather than try to memorize the circle of fifths to figure out the sharps, I'll just count up in fifths using chord triads. Starting on C, C-E-G is my C chord, so G is a fifth up from C and has one sharp. G-B-D is my next chord so D is a fifth up from G and has two sharps. D-F-A is next, A is a fifth up from D and has three sharps. Lastly A-C-E will get me to E, so E has four sharps.\n\nYou use the mnemonic \"Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle\" to remember in what order to place the sharps. Since we have four in E, we just need Father Charles Goes Down, which gives us F#, C#, G# and D#. We can stick those in our E major scale and we'll get E F# G# A B C# D# E. To find out the chords we use our pattern I ii iii IV V vi vii°, which means in an E major key, we have an E major (obviously), F# minor, G# minor, A major, B major, C# minor and D# diminished.\n\nI cheat when it comes to flat keys by using a little trick. Sharps and flats of the same letter always add up to seven. So, if E major has four sharps, then Eb has three flats. We use the same mnemonic for flats, only backwards (Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father). The three flats we need are Bb, Eb, Ab, and the Eb scale would be Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb. Using the same trick we know that if G has one sharp, Gb has six flats, D has two sharps, so Db has five flats , A has three sharps, so Ab has four flats, etc.\n\nTo check if you're right, use the major scale pattern of whole steps and half steps, WWHWWWH.\n\nI apologize if I ended up confusing you more, I didn't really start understanding theory until I took a course on it..\n\n*Edit: realizing this might not have been \"quick\".. haha.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431375352", "subreddit": "Guitar", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Diatonic scales consist of a mixture of different chord types. They should not all be notated as major seventh chords. I recommend that you check your sources.\n\n\nSeventh chords are preferred to triads in jazz pedagogy because seventh chords are more functional than triads. There is a world of difference between C∆ (C E G B; \"∆\" means \"major seventh\") and C7 (C E G B♭). C∆ is generally heard as a tonic function (I in the key of C), C7 is generally heard as a dominant function (V in the key of F). If you take away the sevenths from those chords, they are both C triads (C E G) and you lose the functional distinction that the seventh provides. According to the chord-scale concept that has permeated jazz pedagogy in recent decades, C∆ receives either C major (C D E F G A B) or C lydian (C D E F# G A B) while C7 receives C mixolydian (C D E F G A B♭). (There is a host of other scales that match up to those chords, but I would like to keep this restricted to diatonic scale modes for the moment.) Once again, triads are less specific. If all you have is C, then any one of those three scales can theoretically be assigned to the chord, but you could make the wrong choice of chord scale if you don't know how the triad is functioning.\n\n\nI personally don't like the chord-scale concept. It is an overly vertical way of thinking, and music is fundamentally a horizontal art form (albeit with some vertical elements). Plus, it hardly has anything to do with \"modes\". It was invented as and remains an improvisational aid, and I suppose it will get you the \"right\" notes, but it is no good as an analytical tool. Harmony is not only the vertical aspect, i.e. what the current chord is, but also how the tones of one chord lead into the next. If you have a good grasp of voice leading, chord-scales are pretty much useless, since non-chord tones ornament chord tones (and non-chord tones are much more flexible in a functional rendering of a chord progression than chord-scale concept can allow), and chord tones lead to other chord tones. Case in point, check out [this](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/1404/3615/1600/204680/BatidaDiferen.jpg) bossa nova head. The first five notes are D C# D C B, and the chord is G∆. According to chord-scale concept, G∆ means either G major (G A B C D E F#) or G lydian (G A B C# D E F#). The note that separates those two scales is C/C#... yet both are being used on that chord in the head. I suppose some enterprising individual would say that it's some eight-note \"bebop\" scale (G A B C C# D E F#), so now you have yet another scale to learn. Or do you? Look at the motion: D C# D, the C# is clearly a chromatic neighbor tone. C B, the C is related to B by a minor second, so it is a chromatic appoggiatura. If you learn to embellish chord tones diatonically and chromatically, you will never need a single chord-scale. Look at a melody like [El jarabe tapatío](http://www.violinonline.com/images/voss/6_jarabe.jpg) ([audio here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE6qVVffM1Q)) and try to fit it into a chord-scale framework. The first measure (including pickup) reduces down to G A# B C# D F#, which is I suppose you could believe is one note shy of G lydian #9, or if you look at it from a more sensible perspective, it is only a G triad embellished with chromatic neighbor tones. Why make things harder on yourself? Chord tones, mah boi. Keep everything else flexible.\n\n\nTrue modality comes from the pitch organization of melody, and consequently the relationship of chords to each other (since chord progression is the vertical realization of melodic tendency). If you look at modes from the perspective of \"Dm7 G7 C∆ = D dorian, G mixolydian, C ionian,\" then you are way off base. Dm7 G7 C∆ is C major, through and through. If you wanted, say, C lydian, D G C∆ would be a more appropriate progression. C mixolydian would be Dm Gm7 C. C dorian would be Dm7 Gm7 Cm. If you want a better sense of how modes work in composition, you would be wise to study music that actually uses those other modes. Irish traditional music, for example, has a lot of [dorian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKqiLwDu8dg) and [mixolydian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ1xHXuiYv8) stuff going on. (Sheet music [here](https://thesession.org/tunes/14416#setting26473) and [here](https://thesession.org/tunes/710).) Scottish pipe music has the occasional [lydian thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c2cQdstt9g) ([transcriptions](https://thesession.org/tunes/8900)), owing to the way the pipes are tuned.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431420746", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

However the music is obviously the best thing about it, and i find with pc music I generally prefer the artists with less 'a e s t h e t i c' style images such as Danny L Harle. In terms of substance the music has a lot to offer-  from really interesting approach to synthetic production (see SOPHIE), approach to lyrics ( being so shallow that it somehow goes full circle and is a parody of pop music/consumerism ), the melody writing is to die for. There are places with insanely classical period-esque cadences with prepared dissonances and resolutions e.g. Charli xcx doing it (A.G cook remix). Often the music is polyphonic with up to three (really good) melodic lines at once. The point being, obviously music is objective and stuff, but if your inital reaction is that the music is simple, listen again because it took a lot of skill to both produce and compose a lot of pc music. \nRealise I look a bit r/iamverysmart but I feel this is something that needs to be said, not all pc music is not just a 'high pitched version of a song we would otherwise ignore' or whatever fantano said. Some is but most isn't, most pop music doesn't involve frequent syncopation, modulation, or overiding concepts themes throughout a label.

You *can* get those speeds from a striped array, but you're much more *likely* to get them from a distributed array.\n\nWhat's the difference?  Glad you asked.  Let's say you save blocks represented as `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` and `6` on a striped six disk array, with a `sync` performed between each write.  \n\nOn a striped array, the storage will end up looking like this:  (To make our ASCII art easier to read, we'll assume no parity or redundancy in either the striped or the distributed arrays.)\n\n    1 X X X X X \n    2 X X X X X \n    3 X X X X X \n    4 X X X X X \n    5 X X X X X  \n    6 X X X X X  \n\nEach time you `sync`'ed and flushed that write to disk, you ended up writing to a different stripe.  Now, when you *read* those blocks back, you end up having to issue six read commands to each of your six disks, for a total of 32 read operations - because reads and writes on a striped array are *to the whole stripe* by necessity.\n\nWhat if you'd written those blocks, with a `sync` in between each, to a *distributed* six disk array?\n\n    1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nNow it only takes *one* write operation per disk to write the six blocks, and *one* read operation per disk to read them back again, because each of our reads and writes are for individual disks, not for entire stripes.\n\nOf course the whole thing is a bit more complex than this in reality - there are best-case and worst-case scenarios that might make the striped array not suck *as* hard by comparison as it does here, and there's parity and/or redundancy to worry about, and the distributed storage requires some interesting work to keep up with the metadata that lets you look up where those distributed blocks are in the first place.  But that's not anything you really have to worry about from a user's standpoint; that's more of a filesystem developer's concern, and these days it's a solved problem.\n\n**TL;DR distributed storage stomps the hell out of striped storage for performance, particularly in heavy IOPS scenarios.  Yes, even RAID0.**\n\n(Before anybody asks, yes you *could* end up with six separately `sync`ed individual blocks stored on a single stripe in a striped array, and reading all six of *those* blocks would perform like the distributed storage does - but you'd still have had to issue six times as many writes to get them on disk, and if you needed six blocks from six stripes that *weren't* that one particular magical lined-up-perfectly-for-this-one-use stripe, you'd be right back to having to perform 36 total reads again.)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431463867", "subreddit": "DataHoarder", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

They ended up making the proposed story into a comic which was amazing, and that was in turn followed up with F v J v A: The Nightmare Warriors, which featured Freddy getting his hands on the Necronomicon, allowing him to manifest himself in the real world, fuse with the book, and become a physical God of Nightmares. He recruited Jason, who he used his unholy powers to turn into a huge, hulking general for his Deadite army, and proceeded to take over Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, Ash has brought together the Nightmare Warriors, which includes every single survivor from all the Freddy and Jason films, the people who have experience with these monsters and were smart/strong enough to survive. That leads to some absolutely amazing shit going down, including The Dream Master from Nightmare V laying an epic smackdown, and Jason's niece putting on his mask and becoming a second killing machine.\n\nIf you're a fan of classic 80's/90's horror, you owe it to yourself to watch Freddy v Jason and then pick up these comics.

If you could sort by both Items and skill order and runes it's probably up around 60% for people who are building him correctly.\n\nWe don't buff Annie because when you build Annie AD and max E first she has a 35% win rate, buffing Urgot because people play him incorrectly is just as dumb, if not dumber, since Urgot is also \"unfun\" to play against.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431489490", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll start by explaining a GPU. GPU stands for graphic processing unit. A GPU is typically to run games and graphics editors which deal with lots of polygons. GPUs can handle 3d space and it's good at math calculations. Math is needed because it will need to rotate a polygon, figure out which one is on top of another, do trigonometry and etc\n\nOne of the strengths of a GPU is it can do math with multiple numbers really well. Lets say we have 8 slots lets call them A B C D    E F G H. We have one formula such as L = (M * N - O * P / Q - R) / S. That's a somewhat complicated formula. The GPU can do one step of the formula at a time however it can do it with each slot at the same time. So instead of getting one value like you would on a CPU you could get 8 values. However the GPU has other math strengths hence why gifoyle might get a crazy speed\n\n[For example on this wiki page on SSE4 it says the operation MPSADBW does the following](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4)\n\n&gt; Compute eight offset sums of absolute differences, four at a time (i.e., |x0−y0|+|x1−y1|+|x2−y2|+|x3−y3|, |x0−y1|+|x1−y2|+|x2−y3|+|x3−y4|, …, |x0−y7|+|x1−y8|+|x2−y9|+|x3−y10|); this operation is important for some HD codecs, and allows an 8×8 block difference to be computed in fewer than seven cycles.[9] One bit of a three-bit immediate operand indicates whether y0 .. y10 or y4 .. y14 should be used from the destination operand, the other two whether x0..x3, x4..x7, x8..x11 or x12..x15 should be used from the source.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431491519", "subreddit": "SiliconValleyHBO", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

If the recaptured slave implicates only 9 other people then N=10. Under torture T will approach 1. Let's be generous and say that a full fifth of people hold out under prolonged torture.

He's not bad in the other lanes, but his potential is wasted. Make it 100% clear that you are going mid\n\n2) Don't turn on the W autocast until the laning phase is over. It's just not worth it. He's a pretty easy hero to LH with. That being said...\n\n3) Your W is one of the best early game harasses in DotA. Whenever you get the chance, toss it on the enemy hero. It hits a lot harder than you would think, so once you get used to him it's often viable to let them run away and burn to death a few seconds later instead of following them until the actual kill.\n\n4) Use the rune as bait. If/when they go to get the rune, follow them on your side and then intercept them once they've committed to getting the rune. \n\n5) Use your ult wisely. It's best in 1v1 ganks or to initiate on the tank. Always autocast your W when using your R. Don't use it on heroes with a lower current HP than you unless it's a chase or extenuating circumstance. R + maxed W will eat your HP hard. Once you commit with your R, you commit; backing down is usually futile.

{"body": "Wow, that means a lot coming from you, much appreciated! \n\nWhat's funny is the way those are set up is very uncomplicated, it's mostly about the nanopad and the performance. I was using Touchable for remixing songs (a la 16 pads / MPC style), and using the nanopad mostly for the \"scratching\" type sounds. The pitch-bend XY pad on the nanopad just works well. I much prefer it to the slider wheels on the left of keyboards. \n\nThe nanopad is controlling a dedicated drum rack, and I have the sounds set up like this: no velocity sensitivity (maybe a little filter velocity sensitivity, sometimes...), with the ADSR set up so it's pretty attacky, and dies right when I let up - unless it's something like an explosion sound I want to linger. sometimes I'll loop the end of a sound so it's endless (the whistle sound I used, maybe too much, was like this). \n\nThe only other interesting thing I'll do is spread multiple start points of one sound across separate pads. This allows for, like, cue points \nif a sound goes \"AAAAOOOOOOO\" I can go \"AA A A A A , O O , AAAAA0000000\" which is big bc if you have a sample like JB saying \"get down\", after you hit \"get\" 5x, you're going to want to resolve with a \"down\". I used to use the sample-start parameter to adjust this, which is REALLY fun and much more organic - but it's more likely to fail, you have to have the right device selected and remember to get it back to the right place once you're done. Besides, I map those APC knobs to instrument and effects chains now. Start point is really fun to fuck with though. \n\nI don't think I used the A-B crossfader that much during the performance here, but I definitely use it a lot with the nanopad to replicate those scratchy sounds. My approach comes largely from watch DMC battles and trying to mimic some of that drumming and beatjuggling stuff. \n\nThanks for watching and digging on it, keep doing what you do!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431554114", "subreddit": "ableton", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Women are allowed to fuck dudes and ideally they'll do it whenever they want and have a willing participant.  It's absolutely fine.  She got coverage for her game because it's a game and they get covered.  She didn't fuck anyone for coverage or get coverage *aside from one mention* from anybody she slept with.  This is all extremely well known and if you leave your circle jerk for a minute you'll find all the info.\n\n&gt; shes a pathological liar, a narcissist and an all around terrible person\n\nWho fucking cares?

Amazing games get pushed.  Game devs just need to let reporters know about their games and they get coverage, assuming it's interesting at all it's easy as fuck.\n\n&gt; this is why we want (and have gotten) disclosure\n\nNo, disclosure already existed.  Polygon was founded and had a disclosure policy Day 1.  Game Politics has been amazing at disclosure.  The sites most willing to do these are the leftie sites that GG targets.  GG didn't target Gamespot and IGN and those sites are following the GG targets.  Think about that.  You target Polygon for things they already do and other sites decide to follow Polygon's lead.\n\nreally. think. about. that.\n\n&gt; i want to know if the guy writing about shitty indie game #5 for the fifth time in a month is fucking the person that made it because that might cloud their judgement somewhat\n\nPlease show me the connection here.

It's not an issue.\n\n&gt; (hint: Games won't end, fear of gaming being over happens every few years.\n&gt; what, no it doesnt\n&gt; certainly not to the point that games journalism actively hates its audience and writes almost solely about how much it does\n\nYou are so utterly pathetic.  This doesn't happen.  The 'gamers are dead' articles are the utter minority amongst majority of media.\n\n&gt; Ratings didn't kill games. Jack Thompson didn't kill games. Anita Sarkesian won't kill games, nor does she want to.\n&gt; lol i like how those two are right next to each other, considering how similar their bullshit arguments are\n\n^- this guy\n\n&gt; nobody is afraid theyre going to do anything except take the focus off of whats important\n\nWhat is important?\n\n&gt; jack thompson set back games with his bullshit and anita is too, purely by wasting time on what amounts to nothing\n\nJack Thompson did nothing.  Anita Sarkesian is having a great effect simply by adding to discussion.  We get cool things like fat female characters in games so there are more types of women represented.  If you don't know about representation and how it matters, you need to educate yourself.\n\n&gt; And indies like Zoe Quinn and the Gone Home devs making games you don't want to play won't end games.\n&gt; what you dont get is that we literally dont care if these games exist\n\nExcept for how much you need to say their games suck and blame sex for the coverage. Surely it couldn't be that somebody actually *likes* the games and that taste varies, and that maybe there's no sex involved?  Blaming sex for the reason why these games get coverage make you look utterly idiotic and sheltered.\n\n&gt; what we do care about is when this shit gets promoted because the guys that work there know the journalist, and other more deserving games are left behind\n\nWhat you're talking about here isn't even nepotism or unethical sex.  If you know somebody you're more likely to be able to write about it.  Look at all things for all eternity.  Reporting isn't clinically analysing 100% of all things and then writing up only the top x%.  It can't work like that and you're naive to think it can.\n\n&gt; Get over it.)\n&gt; get over gg existing because its literally never going to end\n\nGreat.

I have far more respect for a player that doesn't run away and chug medkits. There are few reasons I pull a max, and this is one of them. Additionally, I will call in backup if needed as soon someone starts eating through the pubs thanks to medkits. \n\nThat said, I'd like them to work more as restoration kits than completely removed from the game.

{"body": "There is no standardization in the bra industry, but the three big measurement systems used in North American bra shops (real bra shops, not Victoria's secret or la senza) are UK, French, and American.\n\nThey are *usually the same size in A, B, C, and D.  Then they diverge, and this is where a lot of confusion comes in.   \n\nThe French system doesn't allow for half cups, so they have a smaller size range.  Japan's chart looks like this too.\n\n* A B C D E F G H I...\n\nThe U.S. does allow for half steps, but for some reason hates normal lettering, hence you most often get (abcd) DD DDD F, FF, G, GG  etc.   Some companies use DDDD etc which is frankly a bit ridiculous and mostly confusing.  Also some U.S. companies shift the entire metric up one by starting (AA,ABCD).  So, usually a DDD is an E, but sometimes it's an F. You can see why this system is fucky, and annoying .  This is the reason for the *in the second line.    A manufacturer may use any combination of the following:\n\n* AA, A, B, C, D, DD, DDD, DDDD, DDDDD, DDDDDD, K\n* AA, A, B, C, D, DD, DDD, DDDD,  FF \n* AA, A, B, C, D, DD, DDD, F, FF\n* AA, A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, FF\n* AA, A, B, C, D, E, F, FF, G\n* AA, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J\n* A, B, C, D, DD, DDD, DDDD, DDDDD, DDDDDD, J\n* A, B, C, D, DD, DDD, DDDD, FF\n* A, B, C, D, DD, DDD, F, FF\n* A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, FF\n* A, B, C, D, E, F, FF, G\n\nThe UK size charts make the most sense to me, and apparently to the majority of bra stores, who will almost all sell bras using this sizing.  There is only:\n\n* A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, GG, H, HH...\n\nThere is never an EE, not sure why.  \n\nBut yeah.  DD doesn't usually equate to an E unless using French.  Or fucky US sizing.  A DD is halfway between a D and an E... Or DDD if you use that size chart.\n\nThis is also why a woman can be fitted somewhere and think she is a 34GG but try something on elsewhere and be a 34I.  She tried a UK sized bra in one, and a French in the other.\n\nTo answer the question... a 32DDD in us sizing, is a 32E in UK sizing, is a 32F in French sizing... Yep.  Unless of course the US sizing is fucky, so it's a 32DD (UK) or 32E (fr) because of the AA.\n\n\n[All women should really be fitted by a proper bra shop.](http://www.boosaurus.com/2012/07/victorias-secret-fitting.html) If you're lucky enough to have a busty partner... Get them a gift certificate to somewhere that does real sizing.  Country size differences as written about above don't even account for variation between brands.  A 32FF freya bra, will fit like a 34G passionata bra, will fit like a 34F in a primadonna, which will fit like a...

{"body": "The difference between 970 and 960 is far bigger. Actually, the 960 is such a letdown card that AMDs cards absolutely D E S T R O Y it in it's price range. While 970 is effectively a nerfed 980, the 960 is a new much weaker chipset and ultimately a completely useless product release compared to it's competitiors on AMD side.\n\nAbout the 980, it's a wonderful card but a bit pricey as the actual difference between it and 970 is the actual 4GB of memory rather than 3,5GB on 970, ~100MHz more clockspeed (in reference model), and a bit wider memory bandwidth. Also, if you're into overclocking 980 allows 120% power limit addition rather than 110% seen in 970.\n\nConclusion? Go for the 970 if you need it now. If you are into overclocking you can overclock it to perform better than a standard 980. If it's too expensive, go for AMD. Taken account that 980ti is rumored to be released pretty soon it should drop the price of 980 a lot and 970 for a bit, so if you don't need the card immediately it would be wise to wait. Also, if you would be willing to drop big bucks for a high-end card, you should actually just buy 980ti as it will likely take the pricepoint place of 980 while offering far superior performance.\n\nE: Well, actually for HTPC usage a small form factor 960 is a great card with significantly lower power consumption than AMD cards.

{"body": "I have to disagree with reading all the rules before you diagram. Stopping to interact with parts of forces you to pay more attention to them and saves you valuable time. You want to be marking things down as you go. Here, I grabbed a question from the official LSAC preptest, let's break it down. The question is\n\n\"There are exactly three recycling centers in Rivertown:\nCenter 1, Center 2, and Center 3. Exactly five kinds of\nmaterial are recycled at these recycling centers: glass,\nnewsprint, plastic, tin, and wood. Each recycling center\nrecycles at least two but no more than three of these kinds of\nmaterial. The following conditions must hold:\nAny recycling center that recycles wood also recycles\nnewsprint.\nEvery kind of material that Center 2 recycles is also\nrecycled at Center 1.\nOnly one of the recycling centers recycles plastic, and that\nrecycling center does not recycle glass.\"\n\nNow line by line.\n\n \"There are exactly three recycling centers in Rivertown:\nCenter 1, Center 2, and Center 3.\"\n\nAs soon as I see this I'm going to draw three big lines horizontally next to each other and label them 1 2 3. Why am I doing this? In general there's two portions to logic games sections. There's \"objects\" and \"containers\".  The objects are the variables you put into it the containers. The order that they're provided to you isn't the same, and in fact it's usually the object variables that are given first in a question. But here there are a lot of clues that let me know these are the containers. For one, there's only 3 of them. In general (in the vast majority of questions) there are more objects that containers, and usually there are more than 3. Another clue is that they're labeled centers. Places like, locations, camp sites, floors, office numbers, house numebrs, etc. etc. are almost always the container variable. By stopping and taking 2 seconds to diagram the three horizontal lines, I've already got a fact in my head \"there are three containers I'm going to be putting objects in\" and your brain is going to process this fact and solidify it for you in *the background* while you keep reading.\n\n\"Exactly five...\"\n\nOk, I know there are going to be five objects. I'm not going to stop reading but I'm picking up my pencil and moving it to an area where I'm going to get ready to write out 5 object names.\n\n\"kinds of material are recycled at these recycling centers\"\n\nI skim over this part, it doesn't contain useful information for me and I'm anticipating variables. to write down\n\n\"glass, newsprint, plastic, tin, and wood\"\n\nI'm going to take write down G N P T N super^5. Now I know there's 5 objects in 3 containters. 5 in 3, 5 in 3. I keep reading, but my brain is starting to think about how it can fit 5 things into 3 places. Distributions are important. 3 1 1, 2 1 2?\n\n\"Each recycling center recycles at least two but no more than three of these kinds of material.\"\n\nAt least 2? 2 * 3 = 6, 6&gt;5. Now I know variables can be used twice. At least 2, no more than 3. That means definitely 2, *maybe* 3. I've got three horizontal lines, I'm going go right ahead and add one more horizontal line above each of those. At least 2. Maybe 3. I'm going to add a horizontal dashed line above each of those.\n\nNow I've got a pretty solid picture of how this is going to go. I've got 5 different types of things I can put into anywhere between 6 and 9 spots. Bring on the other rules.\n\n\"Any recycling center that recycles wood also recycles\nnewsprint.\"\n\nI'm going to write down W -&gt; N. If there's W there's got to be N. (And of course the logical contrapositive is always true. If there's nor N, there can't be a W. ~~N~~ -&gt; ~~W~~.) Don't just write down words though. Think about what it means. Think about what it implies. W just got a point of importance. It's got some influence. W will always bring N with it. And *because I diagrammed it out* I already can see a potential point of conflict. Hey, I know that there's a limit to how many things can be in a center. 3 is the limit. And W has the potential to push limits. W brings N with it. W can only be with one variable that isn't N. W is the guy who always brings his girlfriend along. My car only has three seats. Two of them are full, and one is open. Can I give W a ride? Nope, because there isn't room for his girlfriend. So if I see down the line a question that asks me \"If center 1 recycles tin and plastic, which one of the following MUST BE FALSE\" you bet I'm going to be looking out for an answer options that says center 1 recycles wood.\n\n\"Every kind of material that Center 2 recycles is also\nrecycled at Center 1.\"\n\nI'm writing down 2 -&gt; 1. I'm also writing down an arrow from 2 to 1 in my diagram to drive the point home. Cool, this is same type of rule logically as the previous one. Let's think about some rule interactions. I know anything I put it 2 goes into 1. I know anything takes W also takes N. W in 2 just got another point of influence. It's huge. If my 1 has any of the two from G T or P, I can't put W in 2 because that'll mean I have to put W in 1 and that'll mean I have to put N in 1 and now my 1's got 4 and we know that can't be. I can bet there's a good chance a question that revolves around this rule interaction comes up.\n\n\"Only one of the recycling centers recycles plastic, and that\nrecycling center does not recycle glass\"\n\nOnly one plastic here means exactly one plastic. I'm going to write down P x 1. I'm going to write ~~[PP]~~ (that's two PPs horizontally written with a slash through them) to visually write out that I can't have a P in two spaces. Writing this out visually like that   might remind me, hey I have an arrow from 2-&gt;1. Any object I put in 2 is going to get horizontally duplicated to the left. I also have PP with a slash through it, so I know that P can't be duplicated. Now I know that I can't put P in 2. I can bet this is going to be relevant to at least one question.\n\n\"that recycling center does not recycle glass\"\n\nI'm going to write P -&gt; ~G~ and I'm also going to put P G in a box *vertically* and strike it out. Now I'm thinking I can't have these 2 together in one center. Before I had two things that always had to go together and that triggered potential conflict with that rule of a maximum of 3, so maybe two that can't go together might trigger a conflict with the minimum of 2? I don't know for sure but I'm aware of possibilities.\n\nAnd because I've physically diagrammed things out, I can get a more intuitive sense of what's more important. I know W is big, I know center 2 is important. I didn't really right G at all so that's not a big deal. Why does this matter? Because I know the weight of the social relationships between different variables and how they interact. I know that when I'm looking at answer options to pay more attention to W than to G at first.\n\nSo why should you diagram as you read. One because it forces you to stop and think about rules as you encounter them. That way, when you read the next rule you're going to be thinking of how they might interact more so than you would otherwise be. But the next point is the big one. Remember, our brains aren't like traditional computers. They can process more than one thing at once, in parallel. And in fact, the regions where language is processed are different than where visual information is processed. So when you diagram something and go back to reading, you're allowing for other parts of your brain to subconsciously do some work for you towards solving a problem.

{"body": "This reminds me of a post I made for fb and reddit that people really enjoyed (dates are a year or so off by now) (edit:sorry for bad bullet format, looked good when I hit send):\n\nA Fresh Look at History from a Curious Perspective By dogfish83\n\nA few nights ago I saw the movie Valkyrie, which is very closely based on a real attempt by German officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler. As usual I immediately researched the actual events and surrounding history after the movie ended, because as you may know I am fascinated by that stuff.\n\nOf course, understanding a historical event requires an observer to look at the surrounding history because people act and react based on what has happened previously, especially in their lifetime. The usual method of exploring history is for the observer to go back in time to the events to witness them. But this method fails to (or at least half-assed) let the observer see the effects of previous events on the event he happens to be focusing on, thus giving a tunnel-vision impression of an event. So I propose to bring history to the observer, allowing the observer's own experiences coupled with his concept of passage of time to more fully understand how shit went down.\n\nWhat I have done is not very complicated (writing this note took much more time) but hopefully at least a little creative. I took the major events leading to World War II and shifted the dates to modern times. I would rather have done this experiment from a German's perspective, since his was surely more surreal, but since we are more familiar with American events I stuck with events from an American's perspective. To maximize the \"recent event\" effect, I chose the Invasion of Normandy (aka D-Day) as the current event. And so, I need you to pretend. But don't go back in time. Today is today, and you are you. Instead, pretend we are at war with the Nazis and today is (for posterity) June 30, 2014 (so basically, today). \n\nT H E N E W Y O R K T I M E S June 30, 2014 Massive Military Offensive in Europe\n\nLondon --Today American and British troops ended their nearly month long execution of a massive military offensive on the beaches of Normandy, France. It would appear that the Allies now have a good footing in continental Europe for future progress on the Western Front. It is too early to give reliable final casualty estimates at this time. For the rest of the story, see page 3.\n\n\nWhat's your opinion on the situation? Are you tired of war yet? Are you too young to have an opinion about war? Do your parents have an opinion? Here are the dates of some recent history to help you decide. Pay particular attention to how old you, your parents, and your grandparents were at the time, or if you were even alive yet. Read them slowly, and let each event and date become reality:\n•The American Civil War started in 1931 and ended in 1935.\n•Slavery was subsequently abolished on Dec 6, 1935.\n•Blacks gained the right to vote on Feb 3, 1940.\n•Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1959.\n•The United States fought the Spanish in the Spanish-American War from April 25 to August 12, 1968. (we won, * and gained the right to fight the Philippines).\n•The Philippine-American War began June 2, 1969 and officially ended July 4, 1972.\n•The Titanic sank on April 15, 1982.\n•The United States ended its occupation of the Philippines in 1983.\n•Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, beginning World War I on June 28, 1984.\n•Germans sank the American passengership Lusitania on May 7, 1985. The U.S. remained neutral.\n•Germany solicited Mexico's help and future war vs. U.S., so U.S. entered World War I on April 6, 1987.\n•Prohibition (no booze) began Jan 16, 1989.\n•World War I ended on June 28, 1989.\n•The Nazi Party was created sometime in 1989.\n•Women gained the right to vote on Aug 18, 1990.\n•The stock market crashed on Oct 29, 1999.\n•The Great Depression began roughly around 2000.\n•Prohibition ended on Dec 5, 2003.\n•Germany invaded Poland on Sept 1, 2009, beginning World War II.\n•That was almost 5 years ago.\n•The Great Depression ended essentially sometime in 2011.\n•Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 2011. (Hawaii is not a state) \n•The U.S. declared war against Japan and entered World War II on Dec 8, 2011.\n•That was two and a half years ago.\n•The Battle of Midway may have given us an advantage over Japan on June 4 - June 7, 2012.\n•That was two years ago.\n•And today, American and British forces ended a massive offensive against Germany.\n\nNow to repeat the questions: What's your opinion on the situation? Are you tired of war yet? Are you too young to have an opinion about war? Do your parents have an opinion? \n\n................................................................ ...........................The End............................ ................................................................\n\nI hope you enjoyed my experiment, but more important than your delight, I hope it worked. That is, I hope it gave a new perspective into how messed up those times were. I didn't include every \"significant\" event, just most of the ones that the average You knows about; because the purpose of the experiment wasn't to teach you more history, but to give you a better feel for the history you already know. And by the way, this is not political, just historical. \n\nThank you so much for reading my note; when I say I lay awake at night thinking about this sort of thing, it's really true. This went from a fleeting sleepy idea to a blogworthy Facebook note. Just imagine my delight when I realized my experimental event (the end of the Invasion of Normandy) happened to fall on June 30, the same day many of you will read it. And as a bonus since I love you guys so much:\n•We don't know it yet, but the first German forces will surrender on April 29, 2015.\n•Adolf Hitler will commit suicide on April 30, 2015.\n•We will be dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima on Aug 6, 2015, and Nagasaki on Aug 9, 2015.\n•The war will end when Japan surrenders on Aug 15, 2015.\n\nAll references are from Wikipedia :P\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431641212", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "No, addons are fine.  Addons that restock your bags, or sell your trash, or mail items... you can automate a lot in the game... and it's fine to do so.  And when it's not, Blizzard disables the commands the addon uses.  Like, in the past we had a way to queue up disenchants... but Blizzard didn't approve so they disabled that control in their API.\n\nWhat would be considered botting is if you had a script that just pressed your mouse button over and over... you could use that to avoid going AFK, or to mill a bunch of herbs, or prospect a bunch of ore.  With the right addons... just pressing the button over and over can be VERY effective at accomplishing highly complex tasks... like buying out the AH at a certain price point.\n\nSo a step up from that are bots that you can script to take actions W A S D... and a right click... that's pretty much all you need to do your Garrison dailies.\n\nWhile technically a bot... some people \"macro\" -- and Blizzard has co-branded some gaming items that have this capability.  It's still not legal, but the fact they make money off it was shady.  Think Razer or Logitech gaming gear... where you can program one button on your mouse to do a string of keys... 1 2 3 4 5... in order, after a certain amount of time between each stroke.  You can't have any conditional in there... so like... it won't know if your enemy is dead, but can cast spells in order, or use a higher priority spell if it's ready.  What Blizzard has done to limit this is make the class rotations less priority based.  They've done a good job of this, so anyone using this sort of \"bot\" will not be doing optimal DPS.  This was HUGE back in Vanilla, BC, and Wrath, and I would wager that most people who raided back then had tried something like this to help reduce finger fatigue.  Blizzard has an in-game macro system as well... castsequence, or stacking multiple casts in a macro as long as the casts don't share a GCD... you can do a lot with their scripts.  But none of them are intelligent.  That's sort of the key.  If the script is making decisions for you... other that just casting a different spell when in combat, or when you have a friend targeted, that's cheating.  (But easy to see how this is confusing!)\n\nNext up would be bots that know where you are in the world, and can explore for you by going to waypoints.  Using a bot you could get Explorer, or with a little more get one that would fly around to various fixed node (ore / plant) locations and perform an action.  One step up from that are bots that know if the ore / herb is there before taking that action.\n\nBots that fish... they look for when the icon changes on the screen from an arrow to a loot icon... then listen to your speakers to see when the splash sound is made... when they hear that they right click.  Pretty basic... historically Blizzard has not banned these sort of \"dumb\" bots because while it may be easy to spot them running in the system resources... it's clear when it's running, but it's not clear if it's being used vs. someone just fishing on their own.  (Yes, fishing is so mind numbingly dull that you can't really tell when it's a bot vs. a person.)  Anyway Blizzard has always given the user the benefit of the doubt... it's a PR thing more than anything else.  They don't want to fuck up guilds by banning certain folks.  They will ban you for talking about botting in-game, but they don't look through the logs really unless you get reported.\n\nUp until this point the bots really aren't very good or clever.  They can do things... but it's easy to \"spot\" a bot in the wild since they sort of seem, well... dumb.  You can easily destroy them in PVP.  A fish botter will just sort of stand there fishing for hours at a time... while they add gold to the botter... the case can be made that they aren't doing anything really... horrible.  Just letting people skip the parts of the game that they don't enjoy.  Fine, they're still cheaters.  But if it's not clear my opinion is that they aren't \"bad guys\" here.\n\nNext level are bots that can interact with the world... and fight.  So when they see a mob, they hit 12345... or some other conditional string of spells for you.  These can be against the AI for farming, or in battle grounds for PVP honor farming.  (The PVP bots are shitfucks who I hope all get aids.)  They can be fully automated, or work along side a player who is moving the toon around.  Things like automated spell interrupts make it so that someone will always perform an interrupt or spell reflect or DS at the right instant to fuck you over in PVP, or use a potion/trinket/ability to avoid dying just at the right instant...  Some of the more advanced combat bots are... well quite advanced.  And that's blatantly cheating and sucks.  Worth noting that most of the people banned were using this sort of bot.\n\nAnother type of bot that I personally hate are the questing / leveling bots.  They aren't as horrible to the game as the PVP bots are, but they're still scum.  Lots of ways to go about this... some are clever, most are just W A S D and some shitty combat AI to help you run to coordinates and fight / take some action.  The end result are people who get to max level without knowing their class, or who earn Loremaster without putting in hours.  Honestly I don't really care about these bots since Blizzard allowed people to pay for boosts.  But... yeah it sucks that you can download a script to get Loremaster.  I've done Loremaster on two toons... once in Wrath (90% completed in Vanilla), and once in Cata with a new toon (because I wanted to see the new content).  It's not something I want them to just give away.\n\nI haven't seen anyone using a bot for raiding... but I can imagine it wouldn't be too terribly hard to do.  Likewise, I don't know about multi-boxing \"bots\" -- although Blizzard has said it's OK to multi-box in the past, so you can have one key on a keyboard turned into the same keystroke across your 20 accounts that are all logged in... I don't know how anyone would seriously multi-box without some more sophisticated tools though... which would probably be a violation.  Anyway getting off topic...", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431650220", "subreddit": "wow", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\n\nThank you for your response and for the examples. I can see how great it is when you have a situation like the person with mobility issues and the right instructor to help with it too. I don't have access to the latter locally.\n\nStella is the opposite of a shepherd; she does not have that fast response mentally (though she is sharp) or physically and training sessions or recall practices have to be extremely short and sweet or she’ll switch off. I reward with a combination of treats, touchings and play because all work well to a degree but none of them capture her interest when there is something she wants to investigate or if she is not in the mood any more. She is friendly, good-natured, inquisitive and playful at times.\n\nShe does recall successfully at optimum times and has positively surprised me of late with distractions and outside, but I know that once the distractions or rewards are different, she’ll choose differently because she values not returning more. She quickly realises and remembers what she can get away with and when I can’t control her from wandering off.\n\nFor example, they were both trained to sit and stay while I open the gate, then get in the car and drive through before returning to shut it. My shepherd has never run out beyond a few metres at worst and pretty much always remains in a stay in position. If he’s followed her out he returns with voice commands and stays. Stella may stay in a sit (out of inertia and even after the release command!) or wander a few steps. \n\nOne day last month I was in a rush and too energetic about things and she run out when I thought she was still back at the house - she just carried on trotting away down the track while I called. She then did it again a few weeks later, this time she took advantage of the time I was in the car. After that [I linked a thin chain through a little bush and get her to sit/stay there every time](http://imgur.com/a/Z27RS#5). She does not even strain against it!! She just accepts it and sits down or stands there, taking a pace or two. Once my SO gets back and there are two of us, I’ll work on this so we don’t need the chain.\n\nBut for recall outside, what we regularly practice won’t be enough (in my view) and I can’t use a leash/chain. Without the chain, I would not have got her to stay reliably as I drove out, it is the tool I need in this case to ensure she stays put. Do I have any other realistic alternatives for doing something similar outside while we are hiking? A poster in the original thread mentioned:\n\n&gt; I know a woman who has a male Pyr and male Akita that have good recall. Her Pyr doesn't seem to be protective at all. He's just really calm and polite. She uses some kind of natural dog-mother training method, but I never really understood when she explained it to me.\n\nI’d happily try that! I’ll try searching, but really, I’d like to get the views from people with experience on my situation or similar. I am not looking to take short-cuts nor willing to work with anyone who is, or who tries to push my dog. I imagine she may take more time than most though she sometimes surprises me. I’ll spend as long as I have to and know Stella takes a l o n g time to train. \n\nMy question is whether I should consider an e-collar for mountain hiking off-leash - where there are no dogs to be encountered though it is remotely possible, only the occasional goat. On tracks she is leashed and Indra is off-leash, though I carry a leash for him in case there are other dogs, which is rare at the times I go out. She is sensitive in areas and tough as nails in others, very strong and stoic/tolerant to pain.\n\nI do think she leads a happy and fulfilled life without those mountain hikes, but I know she’d enjoy them tremendously if only I’d know I could recall her when necessary and ensure she doesn’t just bugger off!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431709232", "subreddit": "dogdiscussions", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok, seems everybody is too busy playing at the moment. Steam says I've clocked 6 hours in the game so far and I've played maybe ~20 games in that time - though some have been insta wins or insta loses as per people dropping out. Anyway, Feedback time.\n\nFirst off, the **TECHNICAL** stuff:\n\n* I'm currently playing the game on my laptop (Nvidia GTX 860M,/Intel Core i7 4710HQ 2.50 GHz, 8GB RAM) - not top of the line but not bad either. As a refference point WG:Red Dragon runs at about 40FPS on Ultra while on High its 60 or more.\n\nHere, 35 FPS seems to have been the norm, first with the recommended settings, then with High and then with Medium (3-7 FPS difference between the last two). \n\nHowever this is still a beta and (even though I really hate it) laptop graphics cards get bad optimization. Details to keep in mind though.\n\n* Very good option menu, a lot of different things to tweak and change when it comes to graphics. Controls wise I think the options are still not in the game. If we go by wargame's standards we can expect a detailed options menu in the final version.\n\n* The constant motion blur everywhere. I found that to be extremely tiring and didn't provide any improvements to the game visually or otherwise. The edges of the screen are always blurry and moving vehicles as well which makes the game look janky overall. I couldn't find an option to remove that effect in the setting ( though that might very well be because I'm not really sure what I was looking for). In any case a very annoying and tiring effect on the eyes.\n\nThat's about it for the technical side of things - I should mention that I also asked a bunch of people in the game how their fps was holding up and virtually everybody game me a number between 30 and 40 though I have no idea what kind of computers they had. \n\nNow let's go to the **UI and MAP** part.\n\n* First off, let's talk **ZOOM**. If you have played any of the wargames you will know that Eugen's IRISZOOM is phenomenal, allowing you to view the battlefield any way you deem fit, and to make the most out of every bump in the road, every house and every cliff.\n\n* Sadly, AoA is not an advancement on that system and in fact is quite a regression. At all times I felt very zoomed in, even though I was zooming out at maximum. Units' models are very large and take large chunks of the screen. Tactical or overview map is not there anymore. I found this makes managing bases much more difficult as I had to constantly move the camera around.\n\n* Though tactical map is not there, it has been replaced however with a thermal (infrared?) camera or satellite view. Immersion-wise I quite liked this. It gives you more zoomed out view, while at the same time it removes some elements of the UI and makes the camera slower. This can only be used once you make the game's version of an airport and the game recommends it for efficiently using airplanes - though I found it useful when attacking as well. \n\n* The problem here is that when you try to zoom out ( and as you recall, I always felt like zooming out) it moves you into this camera, creating a back and forth game of entering and exiting the satellite view, which was quite frustrating. \n\n* On the **UI** front there are also some problems. First of all hotkeys. All are good ( Z X C R T E F, etc) apart from one:  - ; -. Why ; is there is anybody' guess. Even more annoying is the fact that ;  represents the first building or unit in that list so you usually end up clicking it. (this might be fixed when they put in rebindable keys in settings.\n\n* Another problem I had which is also going to probably be fixed in the final version is UI scaling. At the moment on 1920x1080 the UI is huge and takes a very big part of the screen. I also find that the economy bar isn't that informative and sometimes you're wondering what's going on.\n\n* Another small gripe I had was that the bottom bar which should show you the units you have in your selection doesn't show you the complete list but rather only a few. (10, I think?).\n\nOk, ok, valiant hero who has read thus far, now let's talk a bit about the **GAMEPLAY**. First thing's first though,  I should mention that the VIP Beta only has one faction and a small selection of maps (3 or 4), so issues like balance or anything similar might not actually be accurate. \n\n* **COMBAT**. It was nice, fast and brutal. I enjoyed the (rather rare) moment of combat. Units are generally responsive and efficient, unit upgrades are plenty and actually make a difference, though not needed all the time. This makes for a bit of diversity even when fighting the same nation. Generally, units hit hard but are also pretty resilient giving you plenty of time to react and use your units properly. \n\n* **BUILDINGS** Here, things are a bit weird and I have to admit that I had a few problems getting used to the system and even after 6 hours of playing I still don't consider myself to have fully understood it. \n\nThe US seems to be composed of *Networks* which is represented by a pool of resources and electricity. this means that buildings must be near to each other and that you can only build next to them. The problem is that not all buildings spread the \"buildable\" sections around and you end up with limited places to build or in some cases, if you made poor design choices at the beginning,  unable to build alltogether unless you sell some buildings. This makes base building problematic for a couple of reasons. \n\nFor example after I had been hit by a nuke, some core buildings that connected parts of my base had been destroyed and I went from having 2 networks to having 5. Now this means that I had 5 different energy and supply networks in the same base and rebuilding was extra hard because of that.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem though is the supply aspect. The main reason being that supply networks have their own supply pools and do not share between them. This means that you will either maintain one network (as I often did) and have a very long supply line or you maintain several networks but you have an incredibly good micro. The game also does not offer any tools for easily controlling the gathering and supply system.\n\n* Other than that there isn't much to be said on the topic of buildings, not until we see how the other factions work in this regard.\n\nNow, **ECONOMY**, this will be a main point in everybody's feedback I feel and I think already is the most talked about thing so far. Part of the issue is related to what I've already said previously about networks, simply put, supply lines and gathering are fairly difficult to properly maintain.\n\n* First of all, you have three resources (or at least the US does, I recall it being a bit different for others but I'm not sure). In any case you have the cash (or oil) which you can get by creating refineries on top of oil, holding banks with your infantry and capturing enemy POWs.  The other main resource is aluminum and you get it only by building refineries on top of (you guessed it) aluminum. You also need to build stockpiles for it to be stored. These two resources are somewhat similar to the Starcraft minerals and gas. The third one is Rare Earth Minerals (or resources, can't remember). This is used for the more exotic equipment and upgrades, superweapons and defenses. You can get it just like aluminum the only difference is that you need a different, specific building for it. \n\nI should mention that you can also get aluminum and rare resources by trading POWs for them. 1 POW will trade for 1000 Aluminum or 250 RareEarthMineral (REM from now on).\n\n* Now, there are two main elements that I found problematic while playing when it comes to creating and maintaining a proper economy. The first one is **scouting**. In order to find the resources you need to scout them out with a special humvee ( with which you start). The second is **randomness**. As far as I can tell the spawn of resources on the maps is random - or better said - is largely in the same area but the type of resource is different. I did have a game in which I had to go to the middle of the map to build an oil refinery. Now this aspect I'm not liking so much because it results in games in which my economy is monstrously better than the opponents or pathetically weaker, simply because of the starting conditions you get. some might get REMs right next to their base, other might have to go into contested areas for them. If an enemy has a fairly strong scouting force an an early artillery piece or an upgraded javelin there is little you can do to defend these refineries while still maintaining a profit. \n\n* Another issue is the cost of units. At the moment I think some units and buildings still require some balancing from a cost perspective. Some are too big and some are too small, often leading to armies that are composed of only one thing or 2-3 units. I found myself losing cheaper armies but in the end wining the game because the opponent simply invested more in defending from those units than I did in attacking him. \n\n**Final Opinion**\n\nI went into AoA a bit skeptical. Modern remakes of classical RTS often miss the points that made those games so good in the first place. I'll admit that I found myself enjoying AoA more than I would have expected but there are still some big problems that need to be fixed. Overall I found the game to be spectacular when it came to fighting and even when I was on the receiving side, the way artillery shells fall on units, tanks advance and skirmishes quickly end, it was satisfying. But I also found it to be too slow and heavy, partly because of the economy system;  units are slow and expensive to produce and upgrade and the economy requires too much attention, allowing you only a short time to focus on the combat. One thing I would change first would be the zoom system. It's too narrow in comparison to the size and bulkiness of units and I consider it to be the most serious technical handicap the game has right now. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431710875", "subreddit": "ActOfAggression", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Amorphous glass is an inherently brittle arrangement of atoms, since there's no way for dislocations (defects in the crystal structure of a material) to move around easily and allow for the plastic deformation of the material.  Instead, force just builds up in the material until it fails catastrophically.\n\nMetals like mild steel don't have this problem, since they consist of millions of tiny crystals stuck together.  Dislocations can move around along the crystallographic planes of these crystals, which allows the materials to deform under stress instead of breaking.  If you want a stronger metal, you can try reducing the grain size of the crystals, since the dislocations tend to get hung up on the boundaries between the crystals, or you can add alloying elements to create little crystallites within the metal that further help pin dislocations in place.  These changes will increase the amount of force it takes to deform the metal, making it stronger, but they will also make it so the metal will deform less before catastrophically failing.  As so many things in engineering, it's a tradeoff.\n\nIonic solids like sodium chloride don't like to deform under pressure at all since their crystal structure depends of a precise arrangement of atoms.  Traditional dislocations like you see in metals can't really propagate because they would cause whole sheets of atoms to be violently repelled by each other.

Allows for some sick turn 2s and can easily win you a game if left on the board for a couple of turns.\n\nSavage Roar x2: Amazing card, +2 to all characters on your board, can be used for trades or finishing the opponent with the combo, 2 is used for the possible 22 damage combo (FoN + SR + Innervate + SR). 2 of this card is a must as it can clear or give amazing lethals.\n\nHarvest Golem x2: You want sticky minions for Savage Roar, Harvest golem is sticky and a mech.\n\nSpider Tank x2: Nice stats, is a mech and can be played on turn 1 with Innervate.\n\nSwipe x2: This card is bloody amazing, used to clear boards, or lethal. The only board clear that druid will be able to use. This card can NOT be substitued for Starfall, even though some may think it will be able to. Starfall is just not good enough and the 5 slot is quite contested.\n\nKeeper of the Grove x2: Oh shit, this is ONE of the best druid card, if not the best. Can be used to i.e. silence Sylvanas, Belchers and other high value effects. The 2 damage can be used to kill Knife Jugglers, allow for better trades and swing board control in your favor. Can also be used to silence taunts for a Savage Roar lethal.\n\nMechanical Yeti x2: It’s like Yeti but a mech. It’s cool.\n\nPiloted Shredder x2:  Replaced Yeti a while back, sticky creature that trades well, can be played on T1/T2/T3 for amazing trades, trade wells with Imp Gang Master and other 4 health creatures.  Also very sticky and allows for more Savage roars!\n\nAzure Drake x2: Synergy with Swipe, refills hand. Nice with Wrath. This card is good and should stay in the deck:\n\nLoatheb x1: Sometimes you want to keep board control and be able to overextend for a nice combo next turn, this card allows you to do that.\n\nForce of Nature x1: Combo for 14 damage. Lovely.\n\nPiloted Sky Golem x1: Sticky and a mech, can be played on turn 1 if your hand is perfect and can be brought out later than that and still be incredibly effective.\n\nAncient of Lore x2: Ancient of Lore x2: Best druid card, maybe tied with Keeper of the Grove. Again, VERSATILITY is KEY in this deck, it allows this deck to protect HP to stall until late game or be fast enough to rush down very slow decks. Ancient of Lore is the best card, it can heal you against i.e. hunters, it can add to the card advantage that you might not have. I USE THE DRAW OPTION 90% OF THE TIME, THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU ARE NEW. 5/5 for 7 + Draw 2 cards is good. It's basically a 5/5 for 4, since Arcane Intellect is draw 2 for 3. Allows you to draw that Savage Roar to kill them with your mechs.\n\nDr. Boom: Sticky legendary that is good with Savage roar and an absolute beast in almost every scenario. Very good.\n\nExample games:\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRUO5Q1Khq0), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ4y7_rj24M) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKNdT24Hsg) are games of me playing it.\n\n\n\n***\n***PART V - Token Druid:***\n***\nToken Druid is a deck that is about sticky minions being all sticky and shit to allow for some crazy buffs with Power of the Wild and Savage Roar to deal incredible lethals. Violet Teacher plays a big role as it is often the start of several combos.\n\n[Decklist](http://i.imgur.com/hDHqEvh.jpg)\n\nCard Explanations:\n\nInnervate x2:  Gives you 2 mana this turn only. Amazing card in the early game and midgame, bad during late. Probably the last card you want to topdeck. Innervate allows early Shade of Naxxramas', Double combo (FoN + SR + SR) and getting huge tempo swings by i.e. using Keeper of the Grove to clear a Turn 2 Knife Juggler. Can be used to get out early Ancient of Lores for draws, Turn 1 Violet Teacher etc. and for the famous combo Violet Teacher + Innervate + Power of the Wild for 2 2/2s and a 4/6!\n\nZombie Chow x1: 2/3 for 1, amazing stats for 1 drop, can contest board control early against minions like Flame Imps, Knife Jugglers, Leper Gnomes and more. The heal is not relevant in the early game as you want to get board control anyways. \n\nWild Growth x2: Now this is one of the biggest keycards in the deck since it allows for early Violet Teacher, Azure Drakes and other high drops. WARNING: DO NOT COIN THIS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SHADE OF NAXX OR ANOTHER TURN 3 PLAY! \n\nWrath x2: Removal and draw, love this card.\n\nHaunted Creeper x1: Deck is full and I can only justify running one. Combos well with buff cards since produces tokens.\n\nPower of the Wild x2: Synergises with tokens as it buffs them up to stronger tokens! Tokens!\n\nSavage Roar x2: Keycard in this deck as it spawns a lot of small minions, and savage roar is good with small minions. This card is straight out disgusting in this deck.\n\nShade of Naxxramas x2: Good early card AND late, this allows a higher combo damage since the stealed target is usually harder to remove and can allow a 19 damage combo if it's only been stealthed 1 turn, 1 turn equals 1 damage more to the combo. This is also used to control early, you can also keep it stealhed for several turns to get incredible value and sometimes killing i.e. a Ragnaros from a Turn 1 Shade of Naxx.\n\nSwipe x2: This card is bloody amazing, used to clear boards, finish the game and used with Azure Drake to make an incredible swipe, dealing 5 damage to one target and 2 to the rest. This card can NOT be substitued for Starfall, even though some may think it will be able to. Starfall is just not good enough and the 5 slot is quite contested.\n\nKeeper of the Grove x2:  Oh shit, this is ONE of the best druid card, if not the best. Can be used to i.e. silence Sylvanas, Belchers and other high value effects. The 2 damage can be used to kill Knife Jugglers, allow for better trades and swing board control in your favor. Can also be used to silence taunts for a Savage Roar lethal.\n\nViolet Teacher x2: The star of this deck as it allows for Power of the Wild combos with Innervate. Good with Savage Roar etc. Love this card to death &lt;3.\n\nAzure Drake x2:  Synergy with Swipe, refills hand. Nice with Wrath. This card is good and should stay in the deck:\n\n\nDruid of the Claw x2: V E R S A T I L I T Y. Charge to combo well with Savage to deal 8 damage. The taunt is amazing to trade with Zoo fields, Hunter Fields or just a nice Turn 5 drop.\n\nForce of Nature x1: I used to run 2, but I cut one since you never really needed to use 2 combos in the same game and if you did, one of them were usually for clears and then it would usually be better with an early game creature. You can of course still run 2, I just ahve never found the need of 2. Very important for the combo, of course.\n\nEmperor Thaurissan x1: Thanks Blackrock Mountain for this incredibly amazing card in this amazing deck. This allows for a MUCH cheaper combo, a smooth curve and can be innervated and can be brought out as around turn 3-4 + 22 dmg combo.\n\nAncient of Lore x2: Best druid card, maybe tied with Keeper of the Grove. Again, VERSATILITY is KEY in this deck, it allows this deck to protect HP to stall until late game or be fast enough to rush down very slow decks. Ancient of Lore is the best card, it can heal you against i.e. hunters, it can add to the card advantage that you might not have. I USE THE DRAW OPTION 90% OF THE TIME, THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU ARE NEW. 5/5 for 7 + Draw 2 cards is good. It's basically a 5/5 for 4, since Arcane Intellect is draw 2 for 2.\n\nDr. Boom: Been thinking about removing him, but he is just so good. Unfortunately he is the only BGH target in the deck and can therefore be sometimes bad to play. Though, he's just so good. You can even get him out as early as turn 3, and unless they have an answer (BGH, Hex, Polymorph etc.) the game is usually won. Playing this on turn 6 (with Wild Growth) can often win you the game.\n\nCenarius x1:  I. Love. This. Card. He summones 2 2/2s, he's the almost best card you can topdeck in a topdecking scenario. One of my favorite cards just because of the, again, VERSATILITY IS KEY. This can be used to buff a board up to immense strength and best of all, it dodges BGH. Also synergises with the small tokens for some amazing 3/3s!\n\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o87pYwu8q_c), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMywkeqgDFQ) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaaUp7Q2jyk)\nFeel free to ask about matchups etc and if you have any questions leave them in the comment section!\n\nThis is WindUpRabbit signing out.

{"body": "Thrilled I could be of help! \n\nHere's an intro to jazz soloing that I wrote up in response to someone on this sub soloing over Benny Goodman's *Sing sing sing*, it could be of help if you'd be into that. \n\n\nIf you're totally new to jazz and want to start playing it, first thing you have to do is listen to it, learn the language. How does the band communicate? Listen to players answering eachother within the comp section and how the soloist interacts with harmony.\n\nA great way to practice this is transcribing. Find a piece you like and transcribe as many parts as possible. Transcribing is also your key to soloing vocabulary and developing your ear.\n\nI recommend learning the lead part of a tune and try to base your solo off of it if you haven't any clue how to play over changes. Even if you do, many renowned jazz musicians use this method, such as Thelonius Monk.\n\nAnalyze the song's progression. Many jazz songs are harmonically intricate, which means that the tonal centre can shift mid-song, meaning that your solo has to reflect that shift in terms of scale usage. Knowledge of theory comes in very handy here. For example, knowing a maj7- or 6-chord marks the tonic function means that you can spot the tonic as landmarks in the progression. \n\nIf you are looking into playing jazz and especially lyrical solos that one is prone to perform in this genre, you should familiarize yourself with the harmonic minor and jazzmelodic minor scales. These come in handy when playing over the dominant in minor, i.e E7 in A minor.\n\nThe harmonic minor scale only raises the seventh note of the scale, leaving you with a G# in A minor instead of a G, as the dominant function always aims to lead back to the tonic, thus needing a raised third (G# being the major third of an E major chord, of course). \n\nThe jazzmelodic minor scale is a invention or modification made of the already existing melodic minor scale made specifically by jazz musicians. In this scale, both the sixth and the seventh note of the minor scale are raised (in the classical melodic minor scale, the 6th and 7th degree would be sharpened when ascending and flattened when descending). In A minor that would be F -&gt; F# and G -&gt; G#. The whole scale being A B C D E F# G# A. This can be used when playing over a dominant chord, but is most often connected to a tonic function with a major sixth or seventh (e.g A-6 or A-maj7).\n\nThese scales plus the modes of both major and melodic minor are very useful for conjuring that slight off sound that is characteristic for jazz music, as they tend to clash with the suggested harmony of a progression. Learn to play these fluently all over the fretboard and from all the degrees of the scales.\n\nModes are also very useful for a jazz musician. There are seven modes that each have their own distinct flaovur, and through combining them and scales such as the above listed you'll get some sweet music sounding. There are tons of guides on modes online, so you'll have to look those up yourself (it's easy to find and I'm on mobile, sorry for not linking myself), but I'll try explaining their uses. I'll list their qualities based on the triad that is inherent to each\n\nThere are three distinct minor modes, one minor with a diminished fifth, and three major:\n\nIonian - major, your classic major scale\n\nDorian - minor, with a major 6th\n\nPhrygian - minor, with a minor 2nd\n\nLydian - major, with a sharp 4th (altered 4th)\n\nMixolydian - major, with a minor 7th\n\nAeolian - minor, your classic minor scale\n\nLocrian - dimished, with a minor 2nd and a diminished 5th\n\nNow, if you're stuck on a minor chord and the endless repeats of minor and blues scale motives are boring you and the listeners out, you can add some colour with these modes. Dorian would be the most common substitution for the minor scale, but phrygian and locrian do provide some interesting, yet a bit more daring tones. Same goes for the modes with major qualities.\n\nThen for a whole new set of modes, use the melodic minor as a starting point. \n\nSide note on bebop (Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker et. al.): for a bebop sound, you kind of have to play the changes. What you'll notice if you listen to some piano solos of that era, much of it consists of arpeggios. So practice those all over the fretboard inside out!\n\nThe blues scale is your friend too, add colour by playing it from the second or fifht degree of the scale. This works best when stuck on the tonic for a while. That would be E minor blues from the fifth step in A minor if that was unclear. \n\nAs you can see, you have a whole lot of tones and approaches to choose from when soloing. You just have to internalize these scales to efficiently put them into use. Fluency is key. Think of melodies and sing them as you play. \n\nRemember phrasing: think about what the perfect answer for the phrase you just played would be, and play it! As a goof exercise, start your solo with short and/or slow phrases, like four eight notes, and start expanding the length of the phrases. Through exercises like this, your solos will start with low energy and build up nicely. \n\nAnd lastly, practice, practice, practice! There are no shortcuts in music. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431732570", "subreddit": "Bass", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'll just add to what this user said because they pretty much covered everything. I don't know anyone in chem eng (biotech) but I know someone in chem eng, and a lot of engineers in other branches of eng, who really love the school and their programs. Every single engineering student that I know who opted for co-op got a placement this summer. Of all the friends I have, it seems like the ones who are in engineering are the friends that really bonded with other people in their programs. I grew up in Ottawa and so a lot of my friends at school are ones I've had in HS, but I met a couple at work and a couple in classes, and that's pretty much how it is for all of them. Except the engineering ones. Something about the hard course work and technical details really bonds people together, I guess? Nah, actually I think it's because the programs are so structured (they tell you okay take classes a, b, and c in engineering, whereas in a lot of other programs they say take class a for sure, but then b or c, and then d e f g h i j or k) you tend to see a lot of the same faces, or at least have common class stuff to talk with/bond over at first. \nI know one guy in biochem (again, not biotech... I don't think? IDK he just told me he's in biochem) and he's loving it. He assisted one of his profs with research last summer in the labs and said it was really interesting. \n\nIf I were choosing between programs that have co-op, or don't have co-op, personally I'd go with the programs/school that offers it. Co-op is seriously invaluable. You get a ton of relevant job experience, and you get help getting there. I'm not in a program that offers co-op, but I'm still trying to get relevant experience and it's hard. It was hell going through the craziness of the end of the semester, and exams, trying to juggle job apps and interviews, and then stressing because I thought no one was gonna hire me (but, yay! someone did!). Whereas co-op recruitment happens in Feb/March, so you skip all that *job+exam* stress and just get to deal with good ol' exam stress :) Also, it definitely is *possible* to be getting related work experience in the summer on your own (ie, not with the guidance of co-op coordinators and all that), it's just SO MUCH HARDER. Because engineering is an in-demand field, and there are more and more students taking it, and more and more doing co-op, a lot of places hire strictly co-op students (like they do their recruitment through the universities that offer co-op) so the pool of available jobs is a lot smaller for people in those very same fields at schools that don't offer co-op. So that's my two cents. Co-op is basically great job experience, but you get help getting to the point where you can get that job experience, which is really nice. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431756693", "subreddit": "geegees", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; `swapMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (b -&gt; a) -&gt; Either a b -&gt; Either a b` might actually be close to what you want.\n\nYes, it's pretty close. I like the idea that I provide my 2 transformation functions to get \"the function I really want\" back out. However, the first objection that immediately jumps out at me from this is that the resulting function has type `Either a b -&gt; Either a b`, which means I can't just provide a value of type `a` or a value of type `b` and let the compiler/type-system infer which of my 2 transforms I wish to apply. Instead, I have to explicitly specify which one I want by wrapping my value in a `Left` or a `Right`.\n\nA second objection is that the function that I end up with simply has the type `Either a b -&gt; Either a b`; while any function that I construct via `swapMap` will indeed have the property I want, I cannot seem to express \"only  functions constructed via `swapMap`\" itself as a type.\n\nThat is to say, I want to, but can't see how to, write a function like:\n\n    callingFunction :: f constructed by swapMap and parameterized on a b c d =&gt; f -&gt; a -&gt; b\n    callingFunction f a = f(a)\n\nIf I \"merely\" have the type of `callingFunction` be `(Either a b -&gt; Either a b) -&gt; a -&gt; b`, I'd get in trouble if the first parameter maps a `Left a` into another `Left a`, instead of a `Right b` like I had wanted. I guess another way of saying it is that if I start passing around the results of swapMap, the guarantees I wanted don't seem to be preserved in the type system.\n\n**Edit:** Perhaps there's something I can do with typeclasses and/or newtype, so that I can refer to the a subset of `(Either a b -&gt; Either a b)` for which all members have the property that I want? And then I could define convenience functions on that newtype that let me work with the values of type `a` and `b` directly, where the helper methods take care of the wrapping and unwrapping the values in `Either` for me?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431808216", "subreddit": "haskellquestions", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "In a game where people already hardly understand the mechanics I doubt a complex system will be a good idea. In Leauge over the years back before smart ping players only had 2 ping options, and the community was able to communicate basic ideas with just 2 pings. Smart ping gave 4 more options, and to be fair, I am not sure if any more are needed in a game like League.\n\nNow with that being said, league is a much more complex game with positioning then Robocraft. I think with simple ping, and defensive ping, with them meaning different things based on what you ping will be sufficient enough.\n\nIf little icons are added for each tower and base that hover on your UI, (think BF [like this](https://infinitemirai.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screenshotwin32-0353.jpg). In the screenshot A B C D are the control points of the map that you can see the icon through any terrain. And as a squad leader (at least in the older games on console not sure about new games) you could aim at the icon and double click a button or something that would tell your squad to attack that point.\n\nNow thing of a simple ping, where if you aim over the icon of an enemy controlled tower/base, the ping would be \"Attack!\". If you hovered over an allied tower base, it would be \"Defend.\". Hover over an enemy it would be to focus this enemy (hello medics). To ping on a person would be either to get their attention or, I am on my way. To ping empty space would be, I am going this way.\n\nThen to add the alternate inverted defensive ping, it basically says to do the opposite of the normal ping. Avoid this area, Avoid this enemy, Give up that tower, That area is dangerous, You are too far forward you should fall back, etc.\n\nI would expect when pinging certain objectives or enemies with the aggressive ping, it will show something on the nameplate in the HUD to let people see it, where as many of the other pings, especially the pings on the ground, will just be mini map only.\n\nIn my opinion this is a much simpler set up as it only take one button and a bit of aiming to get out basic ideas, which is all that is really needed in robocraft at the moment. Maybe down the line a smart ping can be added to give more ideas, but I dont see us needing much more then this for a long time.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431814283", "subreddit": "Robocraft", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

Meanwhile, the bottom example, using the F#, just makes sense alphabetically and allows G to have its own unique key of one sharp.\n\nAlso, in terms of key signitures, wouldn't you rather play a piece in F# minor (3 sharps) than Gb minor (9 flats? I don't even know; I think some flats would become double flats? Someone correct me if I'm wrong. Anyways, it'd be extremely difficult to read).\n\nI really hope this makes sense, and if it doesn't, I'll try to explain it more clearly!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431828067", "subreddit": "Trombone", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

How's it going!\" There he goes again. Like he's stuck in a loop. It's unsettling. The plastic smile stapled to his face never fades, ever radiant and omnipresent, always following me around the workplace. The way he waves his arm is rigid and stiff, but seems rehearsed, as though he had stood in a mirror for several hours just smiling and waving.\n\nAnd everyday he asks the same thing, and everyday he has the same reaction.\n\n\"Hey, Jim, can I ask you to do a favor for me?\" Even the facial expression is the same. A nervous question, always uncertain if I will accept, even though at this point he knows I will accept. I swallow my annoyance, and replied as usual.\n\n\"Sure, Dan, what do you need?\"\n\nHe sighs in relief, as though I had just lifted a great weight from his shoulders. At least, that was what was supposed to happen. His worried mindset was made manifest, and he was still uncertain of me, or perhaps he wanted something else.\n\n\"Would you please take these papers to the shredder?\"\n\nI suppose I was wrong, or perhaps it was a momentary slip, because he returned to work as usual, typing the same sequence of keys over and over. I guess even robots get too lazy to do work. I took the papers like I always do, and transported them towards the big shredder. It was pretty awesome to just put a giant stack of papers into that monster of a machine and watch it devour it in one bite. Unfortunately, I dropped the stack of papers on my way there. How annoying. Some pages had writing on them. They seemed quite out of place, I had expected Dan's handwriting to be neater than this. Most pages were filled with random numbers, or binary, or error codes from his computer, but there were a few pages that I can only guess he slipped in. \n\nThe title of the document read:*Help Me*.\n\n**G U L P M E N U**\n\n**R O T D R E S S Y V E R S E**\n\nNow that was what I call crazy. It was non-sense. I shred the papers quickly and pretended not to notice, but of course, I knew what was going to happen next. I walked over to Dan's desk, and he jumped on me as usual.\n\n\"Did you shred the papers?\"\n\n\"Yes, Dan, I did.\"\n\n\"Wow! That was quick! Thank you!\"\n\nNo it wasn't, and he knew it. He started typing again. The same keys over and over. Didn't he even realize his computer was off? Something was wrong, it had to be. The same keys over and over, why? They were worn out from the repetition of his typing. *U, n, p, l, g, m, e, d, s, t, r, o, y, and v.* He always typed too fast for me to read, but it probably isn't important. I hope the act of taking on his quest will restore his sanity. Poor guy. Today was probably the first day I've felt bad for him. The stress must be getting to him.\n\n    Even for a robot, he's oddly human.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI hope you guys enjoyed it!

{"body": "As /u/lejazzvp stated, chord-scale systems are really just a shortcut. Voice leading is much more important than noodling \"chord-scales\" and will ultimately tell you more about melodic tendency than any chord-scale can. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/7kkXVMg.jpg) is a quick primer. (The triangles, '∆', signify a major seventh. 'ø' signifies a diminished triad with an added minor seventh.) I'm using the progression I IV vii° ii vi ii V I because it cycles through the entire major scale by the interval of the fifth (diatonic fifths, not perfect fifths; IV to vii° is a diminished fifth root movement). When you do this with seventh chords, the smoothest voice leading possible is to have the seventh of each chord descend to the third of the next chord, and maintain the third so that it becomes the seventh. (This is called oblique motion: one voice is moving while the other is static.) So, if you're improvising on a ii, the next chord is V, and you're sitting on the seventh while the ii is going on, the natural tendency is to go down to the third of the V when it rolls along. You can ornament those chord tones and preserve the tendency so long as the harmonic skeleton is there.\n\n\nNow, to address your question, the idea behind chord-scale concept is that you are organizing a chord and its extensions into a scale. When I say \"chord,\" I am referring to the four tones that make up a seventh chord (1 3 5 7). Extensions are tones that are obtained by continuing to stack thirds beyond the seventh. In jazz harmony, all chords implicitly contain (at least) seven tones: 1 3 5 7 9 11 13. 9, 11, and 13 are the extensions. I will now translate those numbers into pitches: C E G B D F A. In practice, some tones will be omitted from the chord due to aesthetic reasons. On the chord I just spelled (C∆13), we would most certainly omit the eleventh (F) because of the clash it creates against the third (E). The fifth (G) might be present but is just as likely to be omitted, because it is not essential to the chord's function and does not add any color to the sonority. This is different for every chord type. If we take something like Cm13, C E♭ G B♭ D F A, the eleventh (F) does not conflict with the third (E♭), but we'll still toss the fifth (G) because it is not doing anything for us. You're more likely to see Cm11 though, because the major thirteenth is an unstable interval on a minor chord. On a chord such as Cø9, C E♭ G♭ B♭ D, we will not omit the fifth (G♭) because it is part of that chord's color and function.\n\nAnyhow, these things become scales when you collapse the entire chord into one octave. I'm bolding the four principle chord tones (1 3 5 7) so that you can see how the extensions fit between them in the chord-scale.\n\n**C E G B** D F A\n\n**C** D **E** F **G** A **B**\n\n\nSee how the extensions fill the gaps between the main chord tones? This can help us to construct chord scales of our own. Let's say that somebody gives you the chord C7(♭9), which breaks down as C E G B♭ D♭. You know that your accompanying chord-scale must contain those notes, and that you have to fill in the blank spaces to get the rest of the notes.\n\nC E G B♭ D♭\n\nC D♭ E (F/F#) G (A♭/A) B♭\n\nThe parenthesized notes are the ones that are not given and we are just filling in. You have some choices here, so experiment to find which combination works best. There is also a lot of room between the ninth and the third, an interval of an augmented second to be precise, so we could even cram another note in there too. This is a common solution:\n\n**C D♭** E♭ **E** F# **G** A **B♭**\n\nThis is called the C half/whole diminished scale.\n\n\nHere is another common solution:\n\n**C D♭ E** F **G** A♭ **B♭**\n\nThis is C phrygian dominant. You can see that the large space between D♭ and E hasn't been filled, giving this scale an extremely characteristic augmented second interval.\n\n\nAnyway, that's probably enough for now. If you're interested, I can talk about chord function a little later.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431899627", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "A while ago I was working on a ceremonial \"hunting language\" that was meant to be easily understandable at a whisper (voiceless).  Let me dig it up...\n\nI started with /p t k s f θ ʃ  h ʔ/ and the alveolar trill (which I can't copypaste for some reason).  Looking back, I should have thrown in some clicks.  I found it hard to differentiate vowels when they weren't voiced unless they were very far apart on the chart, so the only vowels were the unvoiced versions of /ɑ i/.  Additionally, there was a sound that I might have invented...it's made by pursing your lips together and pulling the tongue as far back into the mouth as possible, then blowing air to create a very slight whistling sound, almost like wind.  I wrote this is ‘w’, since I think it works a bit like the semivowel /w/.\n\nTo add some variety to my vowel inventory, I introduced vowel lengths.  There are at least two vowel lengths (I was considering doing three), which gave me / ɑ ɑː i iː / as well as w and wː .   I denoted length with double letters\n\nSimilarly, I added different consonant lengths.  For the plosives, there are two lengths: normal and ejective (which I denoted with an apostrophy).

{"body": "Actually I was asking to see how you'd answer. I see you're currently being educated in music but I guarantee you're not past 25 right? \n\nAs you go on your musical journey through education and employment, you'll come to learn that a lot of the pedantic stuff like 'starting note' isn't that big a deal. Certainly not a big enough deal to refer to someone as a 'pain in the ass' when they ask you a question on something you speak with such authority.\n\nAbsolutely not everything is written in harmonic or melodic minor.\n\nWhat point in history are you referring to when you assert that? Are you counting things like borrowed tones, non diatonic substitution and secondary dominants as examples of pieces that are not using natural minor? \n\nMy original question was what is a single difference between the scales E minor and G Major. If a scale is a group of notes with specific intervals with codes like R W W H W W W H and R W H W W H W W it takes no brain to see that they are the same thing from different starting points. \n\nNow you're telling me that the starting point of a song establishes the root as a function but that's arbitrary and in many examples of music, is transitive not fixed. For instance diatonically substituting the I for the VI is very commonplace but it wouldn't mean the key is changing briefly. Under scrutiny you can tell the tones of the scale that you're evoking.\n\nWith that in mind, these are pools of notes and if it helps to narrative-ise their use/standing within their system then a distinction like a Root or starting note is important but there is no difference in any of the tones of the scale and a non-sequitur rant about other pieces using harmonic or melodic minor doesn't really get us anywhere.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431982854", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 1}

When they leash I cast eidelons on the highest level creep I can cast it on. \n\nNinja edit: when you farm camps don't stand right on them. go up a hill or a bit away so they have to run to you. drag a box around your eidelons and watch their HP. Click the one taking the most dmg and walk him back until the camp starts attacking another eidelon or you then send him back in. You only really need to do this early in the game but it helps to learn this micro.\n\nI skill him stupid but I love pure dmg so I level eidelons and midnight pulse over the mini stun. The stun just seems a bit underwhelming to me I also almost always go Aghs after GG boots. I consider BKB and blink to be situational. \n\nI stop leveling eidelons at 3 points because at 3 points they don't need me to clear camps anymore. When I summon them mid game I let them kill one camp while I start attacking the next one.\n\nDon't worry too much about not getting a 5 man black hole. Part of playing enigma is that the enemy team will be much more careful about their positioning and it's usually a pain in the ass to get more than 1 or 2.\n\nMy build order is typically W E W E E/W/Q (Depends on if I need to help fight) R E Q Q Q R W you get it from here.\n\nItem progression: \n\nSupport items courier wards etc if needed.\nBasilius ring or soul ring\nBoots \nRegen aura part of mek\nMekansm\nArcane Boots\n\nGuardian Greaves\nAghs\nRefresher\nRadiance\nShivas\nDivine Rapier\n \nBKB/Blink/Force Staff/Euls situational picks.\n\n[Here's a replay.](http://dotamax.com/match/detail/1482242161/)\n\nIf you watch the replay I messed up my first few pulls really bad, didn't land a single 5 man black hole but still played well throughout and managed to secure kills on LD and his bear at key moments later in the game.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431983903", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Do you name your Pokemon?\n\nYes! Not all of them, but I do have a friend who's recently gotten into the Pokemon game scene as of XY and names every single Pokemon he catches... I don't do that. I always name my starter, and I always end up naming Pokemon I end up using for an extended amount of time throughout my playthrough. And shinies.\n\n&gt; If so, do you use UPPERCASES, lowercases, or both?\n\nDepends on the nickname. For my shiny Rotom I got back in Y, I used all lowercase (nicknamed it pikachu because it was adorable and I may have been drinking. At this point it's anyone's guess). I don't remember if I've every used entirely uppercase letters, but usually I capitalize the first character because it's meant to be a name (shiny Fenniken Finn. Love that little guy).\n\n&gt; Do they make sense? (i.e. Blaze for Charmander)\n\nSometimes they do, like the Finn I mentioned above, but sometimes they don't, like the pikachu shiny Rotom. Or the shiny Mawile I named after Lust from FMA (it doesn't make sense because the Mawile turned out to be a male... He identifies sexually as an attractive, female Homunculus, though).\n\n&gt; Do you name your Pokemon randomly?\n\n(You  may have figured out I'm typing all these questions out by now) Not generally. I'm assuming I understand the question correctly, so I'm going to say I always know that I'm going to name a Pokemon when I get it or I have a name in mind when trying to get a specific Pokemon. I hope that was a proper answer.\n\n&gt; Have you ever changed your style of naming your Pokemon?\n\nYes ^technically ! I used to *NEVER* nickname my Pokemon - something about being a purist and not wanting to taint their \"given names\". But then one day I realized there was nothing special about my favorite Pokemon from any other Pokemon of the same species. After all, I never nicknamed them, so to another trainer they just looked like a regular Ditto or Snorlax or what-have-you. So the change in style is that I *STARTED* nicknaming my Pokemon, I think around the time XY came out.\n\n*~ ~ ~ B O N U S ~ Q U E S T I O N S ~ ~ ~*\n\n&gt; What do you name the protagonist?\n\nThis is something I've always done. When I was younger, I almost always used the name Atticus. I always liked the sound of that name. It sounds like an older, more fantasy name, almost. Nowadays, I name my character something different, and entirely random. When I buy a new game it usually takes me ~30 minutes to come up with a good name for my character. When I got White 2 I named my character Cup. For Y, I named him Django. And now with Alpha Sapphire, I named him Monkey. I dunno what I'll name my next character, but I take naming him very seriously. I deliberate for a silly amount of time trying to come up with the perfect name.\n\n&gt; Ever named him/her a character from the Anime?\n\nPretty much answered above, but for clarity: **nope!**\n\n&gt; What do you name your rival?\n\nI usually just let the rival have whatever the stock name is. May is may, Brendan is Brendan, Gary is Gary. I don't ever change the Rival's name.\n\n&gt; (Same for question #2, except for the rival)\n\nAnswered above, but for clarity: **naaah!**\n\nThis was fun.

{"body": "Yep. These four books specifically:\n\n1. The Rolling Bootlegs (the 1930 timeline)\n2. The Grand Punk Railroad - Local Episode (Part 1 of the 1931-32 Flying Pussyfoot timeline)\n3. The Grand Punk Railroad - Express Episode (Part 2) \n4. Drugs &amp; the Dominoes (1932 timeline)\n\nAnd even then they left out some of the content in these books - the fourth had a somewhat important (sub?)plot involving the characters Roy Maddock and his girlfriend Edith (and Begg, who's one of the immortals from the Advenna Avis who still lives. He had a non-speaking cameo in the anime). Their whole subplot revolves around drugs and brings to light some of Begg's past. It's a good subplot. I'm pretty sure Roy and Edith show up in later books.\n\nAlso in the fourth book Gustavo isn't shot by his boss. Instead, as he threatens Eve, Luck beats the shit out of his face with a chair leg. Gustavo gets up and they fight and Luck shoots six rounds into Gustavo's chest and *he's still not fucking dead*. More violence. Luck's left hand is shot off when he protects Eve again. **Then he uses his severed hand to stab Gustavo in the fucking throat.** \n\n**Book 5** - The Children of the Bottle - takes place in 2001. Primary characters are Maiza, Czes, Sylvie, Nile (guy with dreads who sliced Szilard in half on the Advenna Avis) and Elmer.  Highlights: Elmer throwing himself off a roof to make Czes smile; Czes throwing himself into a fireplace to burn off the ropes binding him (and his subsequent badass emergence from the fireplace), Nile, a hive mind of girls who all look alike and are the same person, Szilard's descendant Bild Quates, Maiza, and more Elmer. \n\n**Books 6 and 7 (1933)** (6 - THE SLASH - Cloudy to Rainy; 7 - THE SLASH - Bloody to Fair) are the books that probably have the most likelihood of being animated (followed by books 8 &amp; 9). THE SLASH is a *fucking great arc*, okay. Highlights: Tick Jefferson and his coworker Maria Barcelito the Mexican assassin get a major role in this arc. IT's great. Remember the scene in episode one where Isaac's ear is sliced in the Genoard mansion and it never shows up again, that scene? That's because it happens in this arc. We get to see the Lamia. More Ronnie. One of the climaxes towards the end of this arc is so fucking good and all I'm going to say is it involves Dallas and Tick. Also there's a duel between Vino and Christopher the semi-homunculus outside Nebula's building on the top floor. And a duel between Maria and Adelle (the blond girl from that scene in the mansion). \n\n**Books 8 &amp; 9** (1934) - Alice in Jails - (9: Prison Episode; 10: Street Episode). Alcatraz! A L C A T R A Z. Holy fuck. Highlights: Firo, Isaac and Ladd are fucking inmates in Alcatraz together. They get along. Huey being a creep in a shadowy cell in Alcatraz. Huey's other daughter Leeza. Victor Talbot (another immortal from the Advenna Avis. He had one line in the anime?He works for the FBI now). Rail's gang. Renée Palamedes Branvillier. Carol being held hostage in Lua's room on orders of Placido Russo.\n\nAnd that's not even counting the glory of the other books. In the other books we have insights into Maiza's past as a young rebellious aristocrat, Huey and Elmer's past (1705, 1710, 1711)...two books are set in 2002 and take place on a cruise ship, where Ennis and Firo are on their honeymoon (accompanied by Czes), Jacuzzi's [grandkid?] Bobby Splot leads a gang of misfits, and Chane and Claire's grandkids Claudia and Charon are a famous child actor and stuntman respectively. Elmer. FUcking Fermet.\n\nAt one point in the books Elmer and Graham meet and have a grand old time. You can imagine how that goes. Also at some point Elmer throws himself off a bridge to show a boy about to commit suicide by doing the same thing how messy it is and well, if he committed suicide and made a mess that wouldn't make many people smile, would it? (I love Elmer. He fascinates me to no end).\n\nThere's so much that I haven't even mentioned that I desperately want to see on screen. At this point I am prepared to throw money directly at Brain's Base and beg them to make more seasons. I hoped that with the 2nd season of Durarara Baccano! would get more publicity, but...\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1431994719", "subreddit": "anime", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I have a more visual way to understand the circle of fifths &amp; fourths and how it can help you. Take a piece of paper and a pencil. Draw a circle. Write \"C\" at 12 o'clock. Then write the whole C major scale (C D E F G A B C) going upwards, in the same axis as C. At 1 o'clock write down the perfect 5th for the previous scale (for the C scale, G is the fifth). Going upwards, along the 1 o'clock axis write down the whole G major scale (G A B C D E **F#** G). Keep doing this clock-wise until you reach F#/Gb at 6 o'clock. Don't write down the scale for this key, later on I'll tell you why.\n\nGo back to 12 o'clock. Now we're going to do the same thing but anti clock-wise and using the perfect 4th, instead of the 5th. So, the 4th on C major is F, write that down at 11 o'clock. Along the 11 o'clock axis write the F major scale (F G A Bb C D E F). Keep doing this for every 4th until your reach 6 o'clock. Again, don't write down this scale.\n\nAt the end you will have [something like this](http://imgur.com/acMCbAt). From here there are some things you may have noticed:\n\ni) If you move clockwise, you are moving from 5th to 5th.\n\nii) If you move anticlockwise, you are moving from 4th to 4th.\n\niii) Sharps, *#*, are added at every 7th. At least on the right side of the circle.\n\niv) Keys carry the sharps that the previous key had. For example, D has F# and C#. The 5th of D is A. A has both F# and C#, along with the added G#.\n\nv) Flats, *b*, are added -on the left side of the circle- at every 4th.\n\nvi) Like *iv)*, Keys carry the flats that the previous key had.\n\nvii) F#/Gb key is cursed. Why? There are only twelve notes: C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, B. As you can notice only five of them have accidentals (either a sharp or a flat). When you reach either B key or Db key, you already are carrying five accidentals. You can't carry anymore. The resulting scale in F#/Gb is somewhat confusing (it would have six accidentals! Nonsense!).\n\nKeep on rockin'!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432018582", "subreddit": "guitarlessons", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(Small note before we start, keys for music go from A to G, and repeat.  In harmonicas, the keys from low to high are: G A B C D E F)\n\n---\n\nWell, for a lot of blues songs you'll meet to learn the I, IV, V progression.  Which is just the key of the song, and the higher keys it goes to within the song.  For example, you would usually play blues in D with your harmonica (one of my favorite keys for blues!), but you can also play them in A minor (3rd position), E minor (4th position), or in G (1st position).  Now, first position is more of a folly sound, and is very useful for playing all sorts of melodies.  Second Position is very...dynamic, I suppose.  It creates a lot of tension, and fast.  Third position is moody, and also quite easy.  Fourth position isn't used much, but the tone there is very sturdy (oddly enough it is quite good for making an anthem/marching tune).  Anything over these usually requires more bends than you'll be ready to make (there are about 12 positions in total).\n\n---\n\nNow, if you're playing in 2nd position, you can play some blues fairly easily with those chords.  Blues is commonly a 4/4 time (just the standard 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 beat, tap your food four times per bar).  Now then, the I, IV V come into play because the key sings are in changes over time (the sounds get higher, then lower).  Blues in D (your cross position) would be \n\nI (The Tonic note, or the home key): D \n\nIV (Subdominant, if your pointer finger was D, count down the alphabet to your pinky): G\n\nV (Domimant, one past IV): A\n\nThose sounds go together really well, especially in the format of blues.  So far 12 bar blues, they're organized into 12 bars, four beats each\n\nI,  I,  I,  I\n\nIV IV I, I\n\nV IV I  V \n\nThis is one simple version of the 12 bar blues, although there are some minor variations.  Keep in mind that each of those roman numerals represents four beats.  \n\n---\n\nA few videos to end: Adam Gussow. \n\n[First in basic blues techniques.  This is a fast, brutal video, but the techniques in it are vital to blues.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CsW0Zhc4fnw). The first time you do some of the stuff in this video, you'll be extremely enthusiastic with yourself \n\n[Now, this is the format for the 12 bar blues.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ICbLTZu5alY) This should give you a very good idea what I was talking about in this post.  Also check out the next two videos in his series (19 and 20).  In fact, pretty much every video he has should really boost your skill and confidence as a player.

{"body": "Always keep your shield charged, if you do that then a lot of lance knowledge is going to carry over with when and what you can block because it has the same blocking power. Guard Points are really cool but don't worry about them too much right off the bat, definitely get comfortable with the weapon before you get flashy. In SnS mode use your charge up A slash and round slash frequently to get charge and deal good damage. The X+A shield pump attack is also great for racking up element/status damage as it hits twice, and applies a phial effect if your shield is charged.\n\n For smaller openings when in SnS I recommend X, X+A, X+A and hold back + press X to cancel into a super burst rather than an ultra if your shield is charged. For bigger openings swap to axe and go ham with the phial combo. Only axe attack I dont recommend very much is the first small damage side swipe of the A combo, so its probably best to do an X attack instead. \n\nCB is really all about the endless combos. In SnS its mostly going to be your charge up slash and your round slash with some shield pumps thrown in. A fun tip is that you go straight to a round slash after a sidestep, so you can do an endless amount by sidestepping and then slashing. In axe mode the best DPS you can do is X A X A X A to do a vertical slice into the spinning chop that applies two phials and ending with a super burst. Mostly though, you're just going to want to go for a quick super in a lot of situations or X A A to do a regular attack, spinning chop, then super. Really practice cancelling ultra bursts into supers by holding back and pressing X during the animation. Ultra's have their place but I pretty much only use them when my shield is yellow.\n\nAll in all its a really solid and super fun weapon, when first learning it I'd recommend to stay mostly in sword mode. It still does good damage and side steps + shield are great for positioning and defense, letting you really stick to monsters and take advantage of their openings.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432103976", "subreddit": "MonsterHunter", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

A is 3mm, B is 3.5, and so on.\n\n2: Under 3mm, you get into steel hook sizing, which can ALSO be letter-sized, but they always put a mm measurement with it.  I just don't bother with the steel hook letter sizing because it makes no damn sense, and get the mm.  \n\n3:  Sometimes I find these super weird hooks with a gauge sizing kinda like paint brushes.  1/0, 1/00 and so on.  Those seem to be really rare, but I have no idea what they correspond to, or if they're even actually supposed to work with anything at all.\n\n4: The measurement of the hooks is the space from the very point of the top of the hook to the bottom of the hooky part.

Whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half. If we repeat this pattern again at the octave we get a longer sequence. I'm going to use \"W\" to indicate a whole step, and \"h\" for a half step.

{"body": "The issue is how long the grind is comparitively, and how they keep increasing the price on new premiums, as well as bullshit like, every vehicle has modules you need to unlock to give you more performance or things like bomb loadouts.\n\nOn some planes its not a huge deal, but at the Jet tier, you will straight up lose dozens of games because you aren't fully upgraded and most of your opposition is, while being very good at the game. And jet upgrades take a long, long time to research. Ooooor you could spend some golden eagles to upgrade your plane like you want to.\n\nTanks are even worse. They have said that they need to keep the rewards lower for ground forces because there are fewer tanks than planes, so you have plenty of tanks take more research points than jets (320k for a F-86-F2, vs 380k for a M103). And dig this. An unupgraded plane is still pretty functional.

Without extinguisher, a shot to your transmission will set you alight and kill you without you being able to do anything about it.\n\nWithout ammunition upgrades, especially in the 7.0 battle-rating slot (for reference the max tank battle rating is 8.0) where late WWII tanks face Korean war tanks, you will literally be unable to hurt your opposition, even from the side.\n\nThe tanks are really favored towards russia as well. They made changes to solid shot/sabot rounds to make them less effective against sloped armor, which really means you can't hurt t-54s or IS-4s with your best penetrating rounds. Ammunition availability tends to not reflect the introduction date of the tank, so every T-54 gets super advanced HEAT rounds that blow through even the new US T-28 \"doom turtle\" from the front. Meanwhile american HEAT rounds, although the reason in REAL LIFE US tanks tended to beat the shit out of russian tanks because of their better targeting systems and advanced HEAT rounds, don't do much damage.\n\nI could go on and on but you get the idea. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432165231", "subreddit": "Games", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

It's raining cat and dog outside,\" I rummaged my purse, trying to find a pack of facial tissue.\n\n\"When it rains, it pours!\" She chuckled\n\n\"Oh no, don't use that! Hold on, let me grab paper towel from the pantry. Let's hope a roll is enough,\" She saw me taking out a pack of facial tissue from my purse.\n\n\"Thank you Donna,\" said I while I was trying to take of my veil.\n\n\"Zaynab, what are you doing?\" Donna gave me serious look, \"You aren't supposed to take that off right?\"\n\n\"Look, my veil is soaking. I could catch cold and I would smell like a wet dog if I left it as it is now. And yes, I am not supposed to take this off--in front of men. I don't see Ethan nor Andre.\" I took a single pin needle of my veil.\n\n\"They're already here in Lana's office. Heard they had to brainstorm for urgent pitching,\" she explained.\n\n\"And they don't include their copywriters in the process?\" I asked.\n\n\"They said they could handle it. Probably they would call us if they needed us.\"\n\n\"It doesn't make any sense. It's just not like them.\"\n \nDon't give it a sweat. You're already wet,\" Donna said, \"and now you need to properly dry yourself. Safety starts when you dress for work, okay? I'm going to grab you Scottissue. Hold on,\" she continued while walking to the pantry.\n\nI pinned the needle back to my veil and not long after, Donna back with a roll of tissue.\n\n\"Here. Use it like a blotter,\" she sat next to me and extended the paper towel to me.\n\nI  thanked her for the paper towel and patted myself with it. Scrunched white piled in short amount of time. I gathered them into a single ball and slid my chair back.\n\n\"Just sit and dry yourself. Let me throw that for you,\" Donna grabbed the damp ball from my hand.\n\n\"Uhh, thank you?\" I was confused, \"but the bin is exactly right there beside my table.\"\n\n\"Yeah, no offense Zay, I don't want the smell of wet dog wafting to my space all day,\" she said.\n\n\"Ookay,\" I answered.\n\n\"Okay. I am going to take this to pantry. It's nothing that Witt's Can can't do. Can't smell it, can't see it!\" Donna said while walking to the pantry.\n\nShe came back and sat again next to me.\n\n\"You're kind of weird today. Don't you know that Don?\" I looked at her.\n\n\"What?\" she said.\n\n\"You're weird,\" I repeated.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she chuckled.\n\nI didn't say anything more to her. I faced my monitor and turned on my PC. Fired up the browser and clicked a bookmarked page. Nothing was shown. Refreshed. Still nothing.\n\n\"Donna, can you connect to the Internet?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Nope,\" she answered.\n\n\"Oh great,\" I sighed.\n\n\"Well, if only we used Penril modem,\" Donna faced me.\n\n\"Penril modem?\" I was puzzled.\n\n\"Yeah, P E N R I L,\" Donna stretched the last word, \"our connection would be more dependable, versatile, compatible, and even sexy. Aren't you dependable, versatile, compatible, and sexy, Zaynab?\"\n\n\"What the hell did you take this morning Donna?\" I raised my pitch.\n\n\"Now you're talking,\" Donna smiled.\n\n\"Have a coca-cola,\" she blinked several times.\n\n\"Coca-cola?!\" I repeated what she said.\n\n\"Yes, coca-cola. I don't think we have one though,\" she blinked again.\n\n\"What the hell Donna?!\" I was getting upset.\n\n\"Coca-cola. go get yourself one. Grab one for me too, will you?\" she blinked again for the third time.\n\nI heard her voice trembling.\n\n\"For better life, starts cola earlier,\" she continued.\n\nShe stared at me. Her eyes directed me to the door. It had just clicked in my mind. There was something wrong; not with Donna. She was trying to tell me something.\n\n\"How could I forget what day today? Remind me to smack Andre for inventing vintage copy day,\" I played along with her.\n\n\"indulge yourself with a cup of Sanka Coffee,\" I said to her while tidying my veil.\n\n\"Womack takes a giant step,\" I forced a chuckle, \"alright then, going to grab you a coke okay? Probably I am going to grab some twinkies as well. Freshness and hostess go together!\"\n\nI raised from my seat and started walking to the door.\n\n\"Well, I have no opinion Zay.

{"body": "Think of the seven modes as the major scale starting on a certain degree of the solfège. (\"do\" being defined as the tonic of major, etc.). This gives us the seven modes:\n\nLydian: fa sol la ti do re mi fa\nIonian (major): do re mi fa sol la ti do\nMixolydian: sol la ti do re mi fa sol\nDorian: re mi fa sol la ti do re\nAeolian (natural minor): la ti do re mi fa sol la\nPhrygian: mi fa so la ti do re mi\nLocrian: ti do re mi fa so la ti\n\n&gt; If I understand it correctly, C dorian would be just like the C major scale, only that it starts on D\n\nRemember that when in the the scale of &amp;amp;lt;note&gt; &amp;amp;lt;mode&gt;, &amp;amp;lt;note&gt; becomes the tonic of the mode, not do! so in D dorian, D becomes re, and the scale is D E F G A B C D, the same notes as in C major. \n\n&gt;But when I look at some other articles and videos, they talk about how some notes are sharpened or flattened in the different modes, and that's what I don't understand.\n\nAh. This is just a different way of looking at the modes. For learning the modes I prefer the way I just explained, but for *applying* them I tend to think of them in this way. \n\n&gt;Like [here](https://www.basicmusictheory.com/img/c-dorian-mode-on-piano-keyboard.png), that's C major but with the third and seventh note flattened, but still with the base note as C.\n\nYeah. You can figure out the C dorian scale by setting C to re and calculating the rest of the scale. This comes out to C D Eb F G A Bb C, the same notes as B flat major but starting on C. Notice the scale is the same as the C major scale, except the third and seventh scale degrees are a semitone flat. That is why we say that dorian is major with a flat third and seventh scale degree.

A good way to practice hearing that harmonic focus is to begin and end on the note we want to sound like the root, but during music it has more to do with the *chord of the moment*.\n\nFor instance, if I play a melodic phrase with the notes C D G F over a C chord, it will sound like C ionian because the chord points us to the note C.

C lydian in series can be considered the 4th mode of G Major (G A B C F# E D C). \nTo understand modes you need to be familiar with the major and natural minor scale and to look at modes both parallel and in series.   \nThis websites covers the modes for every scale I think:  \nhttp://docs.solfege.org/3.21/C/scales/  \nStart with this link for the major scale and it's modes:  \nhttp://docs.solfege.org/3.21/C/scales/maj.html", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432292061", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The notes A-G were settled on around the same time that a monk, Guido d'Arezzo, developed what became solfege (do, re, mi...). Guido assigned the syllables to fixed pitches in the form of hexachords. There were three versions: C D E F G C, F G A Bb C D F, and G A B C D E G. We say C is the start of the scale because C major/C Ionian is the most natural major mode, as it has no accidentals.\n\n&gt; Why “C” instead of “A”? The answer lies in the history of music notation and theory. Medieval theorists wanted to use the mathematical ratio-based theories handed down from the ancient Greeks. The complete set of notes, known as the “Greater Perfect System” (GPS), was given Latin letter names by later Medieval writers as a kind of shorthand, starting with “A” at the bottom. Its only priority was that it was the lowest note in the system.\n&gt; Around 1000 CE (a thousand years ago), writers started adding a note below the traditional bottom of the GPS, which they called gamma. (Using a Greek letter name preserves the integrity of the original system that starts on A…) Gamma eventually became what we call G.\n&gt; The teacher Guido, who lived around this same time, came up with a method to help his students learn intervals, which we call solmization. His system assigns syllables to six notes, or hexachord: Ut-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La. There were three possible hexachords: one starting on C, another on F (with a “soft” B), and a third on G (with a “hard” B).\n&gt; The complete set of possible notes, in a version that made sense for both practical and theoretical musicians, started with Gamma, or Ut. Hence the term “gamut” for a complete set.\n&gt; The modern C major scale was not standard or dominant at all. It emerged gradually from humble origins in religious chants where the last note landed on F or G.\n\n[From here.](http://funmusicco.com/classroom-music/letter-names-in-musical-notation/#comment-671101)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432307574", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I know right, what really got me was the sentence \"neoclassical phrygian mode minor scales with diminished 7th chord progressions\"\n\nJust to break this down for a second..\n\nNeoclassical is a style of music that translates to new classical. Basically taking classical period constructs and using them now in the present. \n\nPhrygian mode is when you play a scale or use a tonal center that starts  on the third scale degree of a major key. For example in the key of C you would play a scale starting on E but only using the notes in the key of C. And a minor scale is just another mode called the aeolian mode, meaning you would start on scale degree 6. So in the key of C you would play a scale starting on A. So to me, saying 'Phrygian mode minor scale' makes absolutely no sense. It's literally two different scales. \n\nDiminished 7th chord progressions... no such chord progression called that. There are several ways you can utilized a diminished 7th chord with in a chord progression though.  I'm also not entirely sure what he's trying to call diminished 7. Given his obvious lack on theory knowledge it could either mean the a chord with an added diminished 7th (for example: C E G Bbb. The Bbb is a diminished 7th interval from the C), or that it's just just a chord built around the 7th scale degree in which case would most likely be a diminished quality (for example in the key of C major the 7th scale degree is B, so a chord built off that scale degree in the key of C would be B D F, which has a diminished quality, and is used quite often as a substitute for a dominant7 chord, would in this case be a G B D F)\n\nThere's so much more I could try to say to explain it better but it'd end up writing a book...

{"body": "Every maj_ chord is built off a maj7 chord. Every min_ chord is built off a min7 chord. Any chord that just has a number (7 or higher) after the letter, is built off a dominant7 chord. [This] (https://youtu.be/6QcEoGrmpqc) is a good place to learn these basic 7th chords. He gives two chord shapes for each, one with a 6th string root, and the other with a 5th string root. You can use these chords as frameworks to build all the other weird chords in Jazz. To figure out what the 13 is, for example, simply play the major scale (starting on the chords root note) and count up until you get to 13. Another way to look at this (in the key of C) is as stacked 3rds. So instead of C D E F G A B (1 2 3 4 5 6 7) you would get C E G B D F A (1 3 5 7 9 11 13). Worth noting is that it is very common to drop the 5th when playing jazz chords. So if you want to play a C13, start with a C7, then add the 13. This would give you 1 3 b7 13, or C E Bb A.

{"body": "PatSoul is a Chinese carry player who moved to the U.S. to study (the same can be said about the rest of his ex-team VoidBoys, I'm pretty sure) who made waves earlier this year when he lead his team to a pretty deep Summit 3 (or 2?) qualifier run. However, after a period of moderate success and showing signs of great potential, VoidBoys kinda fell off the map. \n\nHe also reportedly turned down the chance to pair up with Bulba and be Tinker's carry player before Black joined (I even think he played a few officials with them). \n\nAnyways, Pat's gotten a lot of recognition from top NA players and is (was) considered one of the best players in the region despite his short time in the scene and few actual officials played. \n\nAs a player, it's pretty obvious that his main influence is Arteezy ( V O I D B O Y S, it's in the name). He's very aggressive both in lane and where he farms, and his mechanical skill is superb, although the heroes he's played most are more of the typical carries, differing from Artour. \n\n\nThere's more to say and I may be a little fuzzy on some of the details but I think that's most of the important stuff. As an aside, in my opinion, PatSoul was consistently showing play a level above any other carry in the NA dota \"tier\", and I wouldn't be surprised in the least to see his become a household name in the next year among Dota fans.\n\nBonus Tweets: [?](https://twitter.com/PatSoulDota2/status/577545208990044160)/ [Adorable](https://twitter.com/PatSoulDota2/status/575104121042178048)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432385409", "subreddit": "DotA2", "score": 80, "controversiality": 0}

It's melancholic but relaxing, with some great episodic drama. Every episode so far has been complete and fulfilling, which is enough to ask of an episodic series like this.\n\nVisually the show is... Different? Well not really, it's not overly ambitious in its animation or designs and it uses a lot of white. The lighting is quite bright, but it still manages to look good. Good direction and shot composition I suppose. \n\nThe flashbacks are all handled very well, much better than in most anime, and add a lot of insight into the characters and the individual stories that they appear in.\n\n**Space Brothers episode 2-5**. Ahh, I'm loving this show so far. It's quite motivational and I like the characters, and it's pretty to look at. I'm actually kind of surprised it's not a PA Works show, because visually it reminds me of stuff like Shirobako, The Eccentric Family, and Hanasaku Iroha. The first episode was a great hook and made me want to watch more. Great stuff, can't wait to see where things will go for Mutta and the A S T R O B O Y S.\n\n**Princess Jellyfish episodes 1-4**. Good voice acting (one of the best HanaKana performances I've seen) and some lively visual ideas. I don't have much of an opinion on this yet, but it's an enjoyable watch.\n\nI also watched 4 episodes of **The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya**. I can't say which ones because the order for this one is absolutely fucked, but it was more Haruhi I guess.

{"body": "Continuing from the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/36ipu2/petition_from_widenarrow_ipd_users_oculus_can_we/crjdhoz?context=10)...\n\nI have found a way to change the lens separation in the DK2 firmware file.\n**This is completely untested since I don't have a DK2.** It might brick your device. It would be a good idea to ask other people with experience in reverse engineering and ARM (Thumb2) assembly language what they think about this method. **And of course this is completely unsupported by Oculus.**\n\nIn [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/DGubcSu.png) you see on the right the function that sets the lens separation in the old DK1 SDK. On the left you see (almost) the same function in the DK2 firmware (in ARM assembly language). I've drawn colored lines to make it easier to see the similarities.\n\nUnfortunately the ARM instruction encoding for this 16 bit immediate move instruction is a bit messy. This means that finding the instruction is not as easy as searching for the hex value of its operand.\n\nA few examples:\n\nInstruction | Operand in hex | Encoded\n---|---|---\nMOVW r0 #63500 | F80C | 4FF60C00\nMOVW r0 #12345 | 3039 | 43F23900\nMOVW r0 #54321 | D431 | 4DF23140\n\nTo find and change this instruction you need to do the following:\n\nFind the following pattern in the file:\n\n    4F F6 0C 0X (in hex)\n    01001111 11110110 00001100 0000XXXX (in binary)\n\nThe places marked with X are 0(hex) or 0000(bin) in the current firmware but could change in a later one.\n\nThis 32 bit binary string is an ARMv7-M instruction that writes a 16 bit number into a register. See [this](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/teaching/eecs373-f11/readings/ARMv7-M_ARM.pdf) PDF on page 347 (A7.7.75, Encodung T3) for more information. Note that the byte order is different in the file: 4 bytes A B C D are stored as B A D C in the file and in memory.\n\nIf you've found the right place you can modify the instruction:\n\n    The number AAAABCCCDDDDDDDD (binary) is distributed into the bit stream as follows:\n    \n    0100AAAA 11110B10 DDDDDDDD 0CCCXXXX\n\n    For example the number 65000 = 0xFDE8 = 0b1111110111101000\n    \n    AAAABCCCDDDDDDDD\n    1111110111101000\n    \n    AAAA     = 1111\n    B        = 1\n    CCC      = 101\n    DDDDDDDD = 11101000\n\n    0100AAAA 11110B10 DDDDDDDD 0CCCXXXX\n    01001111 11110110 11101000 0101XXXX\n\nAgain, all bits marked with X need to stay the same as in the original firmware file.\n\nAfter this has been changed the CRC32 value of the firmware image (and header) needs to be recomputed. I'm not going to explain how this works exactly because there are many (standard) libraries that support this.\nBegin the CRC calculation at file offset 0x1B and stop after the last byte of the file has been processed. The resulting checksum needs to be stored at file offset 0x17.\n\nI've implemented this in two programs. [A quick and dirty one](https://github.com/nairol/DK2-Firmware-Patcher/blob/master/DK2_LS_FW2_12.d) that only works for the current firmware and [a more detailed one](https://github.com/nairol/DK2-Firmware-Patcher/blob/master/DK2_LS_FW.d) that might also work with other versions.\n\nCompiled versions (for now Windows-only) can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nairol/DK2-Firmware-Patcher/releases/tag/v0.1). The 2.12-only version (DK2_LS_FW2_12) assumes that the DK2 firmware file is in the same folder as the executable! Its only command line parameter is the lens separation. The other version (DK2_LS_FW) additionally allows the path to the firmware to be chosen as second command line parameter.\n\nYou can use whatever you like from my code. I don't care about licensing that much so I usually release stuff as public domain.\n\nThere is still a problem: The biggest supported lens separation value is 65535, which is also the biggest 16 bit number. There are ways to work around this though. I haven't done anything in this regard but will look into it tomorrow or the day after. Or maybe someone else wants to help?\n\nI hope all this makes sense. I've been awake for way too long and really need to get some sleep now.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432524016", "subreddit": "oculus", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "An extended chord is one where you add more than three notes to it. For example, if you take a G major chord, you have the notes G B D. And extended chord could be something like G7, which is G B D F, Gmaj7, which is G B D F#, or G9, which is G B D F A. A secondary dominant is when you take a a chord in a key signature that is not normally major and make it major so that it resolves to the chord a fifth below it.  For example, in the key of G, the B chord is minor.  So the notes are B D F#. In a secondary dominant, you would make that major by raising the third so that it is B D# F#. After, you would resolve to the chord a fifth below it, which in this case is a Emin.  A sus chord is a suspended chord which substitutes the third of a chord for either a fourth or a second. A Gsus2 chord would be G A D and a Gsus4 chord would be G C D.  And add nine chord just adds a ninth to the chord. A Gadd9 chord would be G B D A. Someone else can explain it a bit better than me, but I hope this gives you a general idea of these terms.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432561090", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; What I am picturing is a field of horses numbered 1 through n. What the inductive hypothesis seems to be saying is that if I choose any subset of these horses of size n, they will all be the same colour.\n\nThat's almost correct, except that you shouldn't picture n horses in the field. You should just picture a large number of them (infinitely many, if you'd like), and the hypothesis is that any group of n of them will all have the same colour. \n\n&gt; What I am struggling with is the same horse isn't necessarily numbered with the same number for each subset. It seems we are essentially taking two subsets of size n, showing that elements are shared, and proving those two subsets are the same colour.\n\nI think I sort of see what you mean, but it just sounds like you're putting too much weight on what each horse is called. We just want ways of being able to refer to groups of horses. \n\nThe induction step looks like this, in the case of going from 7 to 8: \n\nStep 1: Assume that any group of 7 horses all have the same colour. \n\nStep 2: Here's an arbitrary group of 8 horses: H H H H H H H H\n\nStep 3: The 7 of them in brackets have the same colour, by assumption: (H H H H H H H ) H \n\nStep 4: The 7 of them in brackets have the same colour, by assumption: H (H H H H H H H)\n\nStep 5: At least one horse is in both groups of 7, so they all have the same colour. \n\n&gt; This makes sense but I keep naively picturing a brightly coloured horse in the corner, and I am asking myself, how could you show all subsets of size n are the same colour.\n\nThat brightly coloured guy in the corner can be included in a set of n+1 horses, at which point the argument above shows he's the same colour as the other horses in that group.\n\n&gt; The usual presentation is to choose a base case first, then induct. That always seemed to me to make induction magic. When presenting in this form it seems obviously valid.\n\nI see. They seem the same to me. A good analogy I've heard is climbing a ladder. What do you need to know how to do in order to climb a ladder? Well, you need to know how to go from one rung to the next. Is that good enough? No, because you also need to know how to get on the first rung. \n\nThis is how induction works. You show it for the base case, 1 let's say. Then you have an argument that shows that if it's true for 1, it's true for 2. The same argument shows that if it's true for 2, it's true for 3. And so on. The base case is the natural first thing to state. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432586776", "subreddit": "learnmath", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh my god. Ohmygod o h m y g o d. Please explain to me the striking difference between \"Joan Jett\" feminism and this \"oppreshun shit\". Please.\n\nAll you need to do is Google \"Joan Jett feminism\" to see that she has said nothing publicly in opposition to any of the ideas presented in the OP or the comments you're disagreeing with. From your blatant attempts to separate your comfortable idea of feminism from OP's idea of feminism, it's fairly clear that you haven't yet done this.\n\nAnd if you ever bother take a look past your biases and assumptions long enough to even *half-ass* some research, you will find that there *are* plenty of quotes about \"Joan Jet feminism\" floating around the internet. However, these quotes are most prominently about breaking the societal rules that women were/are expected to follow -- rules made, presumably, by men. These preset rules that women were/are subject to are the very definition of \"oppreshun\" -- case in point, the fact that you are likely so afraid to acknowledge the reality of oppression that you are compelled to spell it wrong in an attempt to trivialize it.\n\nPunk rock has always been a sausage party, and Joan Jett attempted to break those barriers by doing her own thing and not being afraid to make people uncomfortable by doing so. To relate this all back to the OP, which you insist is wildly different from this idea for some odd reason: Joan Jett realized that by taking control of her career and forcefully pushing herself into an industry that has always favored men, she wasn't taking anything away from men, but doing her own thing. And, wouldn't you know it, this is the exact same idea being discussed by the OP.\n\nI wouldn't want to make a sweeping generalization about your take on feminism based on one comment (because what kind of rational person would do such a thing), but I am willing to bet that you are more comfortable with \"Joan Jett\" feminism because it focuses more on social barriers rather than political barriers. Or is it because Joan Jett is very much a sexual figure, and is therefore more widely regarded because she appeals to the portion of society most likely to control the portrayal of female figures in media (psst, it's straight men!)?\n\nEdit: I know the person I'm replying to either won't read this or won't reply, but I just want everyone to fuckin' leave Joan Jett alone.

{"body": "This is a part of a guide I wrote some time ago... Maybe you find it helpful :) EDIT: RIP formatting. :(\n\nSo you actually want to improve at this game?\n\n\nFirst of all, let's go through the hardware part:\n\n\nMake sure you have AT LEAST 60 FPS if you have a 60Hz monitor and 120/144 FPS if you have a 120/144 Hz monitor. If needed, turn all the details to low, turn off anti aliasing, lower your resolution, play in 4:3... What ever is needed. You want your game to run as smoothly as possible because it's harder to hit an enemy when he's teleporting around on your screen. Yes, your precious skin might look ugly on low settings, but this guide is about getting better at the game, not about looking pretty. If you can, leave shadows on high because it also increases the shadow draw distance (depending on the spot, you see shadows from enemy players before they peek. With shadows on \"high\", you can see these shadows even when the enemy player is further away).\n\n\nThe second thing you should make sure to have is a large mousepad so you have enough space to move your mouse. The problem with small mousepads is that you need to lift your mouse a lot because you reached the border. This makes movement and sometimes even aiming a chore. I personally recommend the Steelseries QcK Heavy.\n\n\nThen you'll need a microphone. This game requires you to communicate with your teammates and you need to be able to do so. \nYou should go to an empty server, use the command \"voice_loopback 1\" and talk. The game will play your voice back and you can hear what your teammates would hear in a real game. \nPLEASE adjust your volume setting so that your microphone actually transmits your voice and not just loud noise. People will just mute you because you're beyond annoying and you lose the ability to communicate with them, usually resulting in a lost game. \n\n\nWhen we got this down, start with this:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwT5fXEloxg\n\n\nThe lower your sensitivity is, the more precise you'll be able to aim and make small corrections but it also means that you need to do bigger swipes to turn around. On the other hand, playing with a higher sensitivity will make it harder to pin down heads at further distance but it makes it easier to move around the map. You need to find a balance that suits you. \n\n\nI personally play at 400 CPI with an ingame sensitivity setting of \"1.8\".\nIf your mouse uses a different CPI setting, this is how you can compare your sensitivity:\n[CPI 1] * [Setting 1] = [CPI 2] * [Setting 2]\nSo say you want to use the same sensitivity I use but your mouse uses 1000 CPI:\n\n\n400 * 1.8 = 1000 * X | with X being the number you need to set your ingame sensitivity to. \nThis would of course equal 0.72 - so when your mouse uses 1000 CPI and you wanted the same sensitivity as me, you'd need to set yours to 0.72.\n\n\n\nYou can use these two training maps to develop muscle memory:\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213240871&amp;searchtext=training+aim+csgo+2\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660&amp;searchtext=aim_botz\n\n\nThis map here is really good to practice spraying your weapons:\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847&amp;searchtext=recoil\n\n\n\n\nThen watch this:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mvXfnY8wU\nAnd practice it until you do it ALL THE TIME. You want your crosshair to be at head level and at the spot where an enemy is most likely to pop up. Why? When an enemy comes around the corner, you can just shoot and instantly headshot him.\n\n\nGo to Play -&gt; Community Servers and search for \"headshot\". Refresh the list. You will find a lot of headshot deathmach servers. Play a lot of that and focus on getting the kill with the first bullet. Don't spray EVER. You will get rekt really hard for a really long time. Just keep going - you're not playing for the score, you're drilling yourself to aim first, then shoot. \n\n\nTogether with correct crosshair placement, this will give you a lot of easy kills because as soon as an enemy pops up, you already have your crosshair right on his head and all you need to do is shoot and you'll get him.\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing are the maps - you need to know all the common spots on all the maps you play (so you can check them and not get get killed easily). You also need to know the callouts for every map so you can tell your teammates what is going on - and vice versa when they tell something, you know what they mean. When you play Cache and one of your teammates calls a guy in NBK, you need to know where to throw that molotov to get him out.\n\n\nSome general words about communicating:\n\n\nYour calls need to be precise to be useful. By precise I mean they need to transmit all the relevant information *and nothing more*. Here's an example:\n\n\nWhen you play Dust2 CT side and see a T player on long, you call exactly that and nothing more. If you know what weapon he has (e.g. because he took a shot at you), communicate that too so your teammates know what they're up against.\n\n\nYES:\n\n\n\"One on Long, has AWP/AK/Whatever\".\n\"One AWP/AK/Whatever on long, probably some mid\"\n\n\nNO:\n\n\n\"A A A A A A A A A A IT'S A HELP ME FAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!\". \n\n\nFirst of all, your teammates will hate you. It's really annoying and distracting to have someone shout in your ear. Nobody likes being shouted at. \n\n\nSecond, you sound like every single T player is literally about to swarm you and probably force your teammates to panic rotate, leaving the rest of the map open. Then they get shot in the back, you're suddenly down two players and the round is lost - all because of your call spreading panic. \n\n\nThird, you block the voice chat for your teammates - If your teammate sees something important (e.g. CT doors being smoked off and Ts rotating to lower), he simply cannot tell you because you're shouting useless stuff and people won't be able to understand what your teammate has to say. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou should also know at least a few default grenades for each map and site. There's a ton of Youtube tutorials for that, you can find them yourself. Practice them until you know them by heart.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432597500", "subreddit": "GlobalOffensive", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Late to the rant train because, well, some of the things I'll be ranting about were happening.\n\n**Aww Yiss**\n\n* One way or another, I'm going swimming this summer! I ordered a swimsuit, let's hope it fits.\n\n* This new gel polish (ORLY Gel FX) holds really well!\n\n* Got new setting powder. Rimmel Stay Matte is cheap and works. Woo.\n\n* Bought new sunscreen - and I LIKE IT. I'm really surprised! I've embraced that I need to use it, but I didn't realize that I'd encounter one I liked.\n\n* And since I'm wearing either SPF30 or SPF50 all the time, and because it feels like summer even though it isn't...I'm self-tanning now! Yayyyy.\n\n**Boo Hiss...the Week**\n\n* Wound up loaning money to a friend for car repairs... He will pay us back, but the situation is kind of annoying.\n\n* People I am managing at work are being asshats. They're going to make me get feisty and I don't want to get feisty. Everything would be easier for all of us if you just either a) did your assigned work or b) asked for help if you needed it or c) spoke up when I asked if you needed anything.\n\n**Boo Hiss...the Weekend**\n\nWe hosted a Memorial Day BBQ. I had a considerable to-do list, but since it was a three-day weekend I thought we'd be fine. And we would have been, except:\n\nOriginal plan was to do laundry on Friday night. With no washer or dryer, we do all of ours at a laundromat. We do it late at night so as not to inconvenience other customers with our massive amount of things to be washed/dried. We took a nap but slept longer than we should have, so we couldn't do it then - it got pushed to Saturday night. Saturday during the day we got some other stuff done but had to go to my in-laws for a cookout. We were wiped out from that, so took another nap. Got up, did laundry, got some put away, went to bed. Sunday was my day of Doing All the Things...only early in the day my husband decided we were going to reorganize a tricky section of the house, which ate most of the day, and left us tired and hurting (physically - carrying many heavy things up and down steps), so all my Sunday chores had to happen Monday before our cookout. I was (and am still, even though it is over) a ball of stress. So much for a three day weekend or holiday - it feels like I got no rest whatsoever...because I didn't!\n\nOther, related rants:\n\n* SIL is rude as shit and I'm over it. My in-laws invited her, her wife, and her daughters (our nieces) to their Saturday cookout. They accepted, and then basically no-call/no-show/last-minute bail. This is project normal for them - I'm pretty sure that's just her M.O. She did the same thing at my bridal shower last year and that really hurt (no, idgaf about presents, but like... you RSVP'd, and you're about to become my sister, and then you just no-call/no-text/no-show?) - but you know, if it had been a one-time thing, sure, I could let go of it...but she does it constantly, and it is **so** inconsiderate (in-laws bought &amp; cooked food in anticipation of you coming...just like we did for my shower). If you didn't want to come, why not just politely decline the invitation?! It's OK to do that! *THEN* she invites husband and I to her place the next day for a cookout that same day. We were busy; she sent it to him and he ignored it, tired of her antics. If she would have sent it to me, I would have said, \"Oh, so sorry - we have a really full weekend already. Shame we missed you at Dad's yesterday though!\"\n\n* People who show up early...and wonder why I'm not in entertaining mode. If I've indicated that we're starting at 4, I probably said that  f o r   a   r e a s o n. So when you show up early *even when, on the party invitation (given the fact that so many of our friends show up early because they're dumb) I ask please do NOT show up early* don't act surprised when I'm still doing things and not sitting down with you to be good company...I need to finish preparing things, and now you're in my damn way.

{"body": "Leblanc can be tricky in lane because contrary to popular belief you normally don't want to be too aggressive too early on.\n\n* Maxing W first will give you wave clear and keep you from getting shoved in.\n\n* If there is no risk of getting pushed to tower it is okay to max q first but make sure you keep auto attacking minions so you don't end up at your tower.\n\n* You pretty much always want to get a fiendish codex early on as it helps leblanc so much with CDR and a little more damage. I rarely build chalice unless I'm getting my ass kicked but Morellonomicon is quite good.\n\n* Luden's (like almost everyone else) is very very good as a first/second item on her. It helps just ever so slightly give you enough burst to destroy people.\n\n* In lane you do not want to take damage if you can help it pre 6. Your first powerspike is level 3 when you get your qwe combo. Generally when enemy goes for cs you want to q + w them in that order or if they are trying to zone you and step away from minions go ahead and Q E W, sometimes I'll even E Q W to make sure I land the chains. If they get chained while being attacked by your minions you can probably just kill them outright with ignite.\n\n* The general goal pre 6 is to poke just every so slightly to get them around 40% hp while keeping your hp up if you can then go all in with QWE ignite to finish them off or chain them near your minions if they want to be stupid. If you are being shoved (leblanc sucks at farming under tower pre 6) then focus on using W for minion management, try to hit the enemy with your w while also hitting minions in this situation.\n\n* before you are 6, you should have gone B and gotten either a chalice or fiendish codex. When you come back and hit 6 you have 3 options.\n\n   * Poke them using your ult combo based on what you maxed, then go for all in when your ult is back up. The pause between your initial burst and cooldown on your ult usually makes people desperate to stick around for CS. If they do go back then shove lane and roam, time this so that your Ult is back up when you arrive.\n\n    * Shove lane hard (only really works if you maxed W) and roam bot or top\n \n    * Make sure you bought wards last back, ward their blue and fuck them up at it.\n\n* Waiting in bushes (sweeper/pink ward) around the dragon area is a great way to catch roaming supports/junglers. When someone is nearby I often like to Q E R W, although if its early on and you haven't gotten many points in E yet I'd just go Q W R E | Q R E W.\n\n* Skirmishes are great for you, you can easily delete anyone less than 50% hp with just a couple spells.\n\n* Always help the jungler when he's fighting their jungler unless its pure suicide. Leblanc almost never loses 2v2's with the jungler.\n\n* In teamfights you never want to be the first one in, when you see an opportunity delete their biggest carry threat however if you see 3+ people get stunned that is the best time for leblanc to W R Q E.  The AOE is crazy from leblanc in those situations and can turn a fight even though that isn't the optimal single target spell rotation.\n\n* As long as you have quick fingers you can burst down (probably not kill) someone on the enemy team before a baron/dragon fight. This can be risky if they have a vi or any kind of hard CC that is easy to land. Normally this goes like: Spot a squishy (literally doesn't matter who) W into range Q R E (W to return) as quickly as possible. It doesn't matter that you warp back before anything lands, it will all land assuming you aimed your E correctly. This combo needs to be done within .3 seconds if possible. Sometimes if it is particularly dangerous situation or very late game you can W R just to get in range then Q E (W back). This isn't optimal for damage but it closes a huge gap and still gets poke off as if you were lux or jayce.\n\nITEMS\n\n* Zhonyas is a great item, don't first buy it unless an enemy AD is shitting on you hard (which they shouldn't be). I usually like to get zhonyas on Leblanc after Morello or grail -&gt; Sorc Shoes &gt; Luden's &gt; deathcap &gt; Zhonyas. If you are poor it should go Morello/grail &gt; Sorc Shoes &gt; Deathcap and if you are getting shit on swap the deathcap for the zhonyas.\n\nMAIN POWERSPIKES\n\nLevel 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 16\n\nAlso pretty much each time you finish building an item is a good powerspike for her.\n\nEDIT: funny lane strat i forgot to mention vs people with stun/snares. If you W forward, walk sideways for a little tiny step then cast your combo. They'll probably miss.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432646775", "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Unfortunately demand and price is based on \"part difficulty\" and how new it is. Grab a new prime part when a new patch comes out, and you can sell it for 50+ plat usually. Trying to sell a part that drops frequently from common run missions and people will trade them in for ducats instead. But the difficulty of getting the part also comes into play.\n\nLet's say you do Survival, where rewards are given out every 5 minutes. The \"pool\" rewards come from are ranked A, B, and C. For Survival it goes A A B C (A at 5 and 10, B at 15, C at 20). Defense has the same reward rotation.\n\nSo you can see right away, if you have bad luck and the part you want is in Pool C? It can be annoying. It can also happen that you get it your very first run (I've had both happen plenty of times).\n\nSo a new Prime Warrfame is released, you run survival (or defense), and you get the part from the C rotation pool. This puts a bit of a barrier up. Nab the part, put it up for sale within the first week, BAM... 100, 150, sometimes even 200 platinum from a single item.\n\nAnd along the way you'll be selling the other little pieces you picked up. 4 plat here, 5 there, maybe a 10. It adds up really quickly.\n\n- - - -\n\nAnother method is selling \"Maximized Rank 10 Mods.\" The only barrier for this is credits and picking up mods (or fusion cores) to fuse into a mod. These sell for 100+ plat last time I checked (but that was awhile back. Might be down to 60-80 now). People get lazy. They want the highest rank for Vitality or Shields right away, and they got the money. It's not something you can buy off the market maxed so they have to defer to players.\n\nCertain Corrupted Mods that people love to use in common builds also go for big bucks. Narrow Minded, Blind Rage, Overextend, etc. They sell for even more because there's the extra barrier of having to actually obtain it from the Derelict. 150 plat at the minimum, because the unranked mods themselves can go for 15-20.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432653266", "subreddit": "GamePhysics", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It's good. All of the chord tones are correct and your non-chord tone is effective. I'd say that you learned the materials on musictheory.net well. Next, let's work on tightening the melody up. First, permit your melody one high point and one low point. By this, I mean that after you finish your melody, scan it for the highest note and the lowest note. If there is more than one of either, then change the melody so that there is a higher/lower note than what you have written, or that some of the notes that you already have come up or down as needed. See my realizations as an example. Secondly, the seventh note (also called the leading tone) of the scale (in G major, this is F#; G A B C D E F# = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) should usually resolve up to the key note G. Try also to limit redundancy. Your  quarter note melody contains four D's and four B's. Find a way to cut down on those numbers either through different chord tones or non-chord tones. Lastly, I encourage you to employ cadences at the ends of your phrases. Cadences are groups of particular chords that signal the end of a phrase. These include the Authentic Cadence (V I or vii° I; in G, this is D G or F#dim G), the Plagal Cadence (IV I; C G), the deceptive cadence (V vi; D Em), and the half cadence (any chord, and then V; x D).\n\nYour melodies don't have to be related, but feel free to continue revising your compositions until they fit your liking. Part of the purpose of this exercise is to show you the great number of combinations that you can make with chord tones in a single progression, and knowing that increases your creative options. However, that's secondary to learning how to write a melody. The form stuff will come if you keep writing these four-measure things. Most musical phrases occur in multiples of 4. Later on, I'll help you to turn your melodies into something organized closer to a complete song. For now, keep writing melodies so that you have something to work with. You might want to download a program such as [Finale Notepad](http://www.finalemusic.com/products/finale-notepad/) so that you can hear your work.\n\nSince you want to learn the piano, I recommend you check out /r/piano if you haven't already. I think their recommendation on inexpensive electric pianos is the Casio Privia PX-150 or PX-130. A full 88 weighted keys seems to be important. As you don't have an instrument yet, you have a unique limitation that you can exploit. Train your ear and learn to sing movable solfege syllables (Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti). Sing your melodies to yourself and internalize the pitch relationships. This will help you throughout your musical development.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432657149", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd really appreciate someones opinion or insight. \n\nJune of 2014 I had just gotten back from travelling and had mad jet lag. Awake at 2 in the morning and no sign of getting sleep. I'm sitting in my bed, which faces an extremely large rectangular window, which also faces out into my garden with a big concrete wall separating our house and the next door neighbour's (this wall is about 8 feet tall). I'm just on my phone scrolling through my phone, looking at t-shirts and I see my dad outside with my dog. He's hunched over and patting him. Or so it seemed. He then stands up and it is then at which I realised that whatever THAT was, it was certainly not my father. As he stands up I fling my back against my mattress instinctively and peer out from above my blankets, too frightened and confused to investigate. This black figure that has no features that I can make out, proceeds to lift its arms up and then bend its torso over its knees, almost as if praying. It does this a few more times. As it does this my mind is reeling and I'm scared shitless. I close my eyes like in the movies and talk to myself convincing myself that it was my mind playing tricks on me in the dark and that I was only hallucinating. I opened my eyes and to my absolute horror, it stood closer towards my window. Now, mind you, I have scarce few shrubs against my window, all quite short but after looking at the figure a little longer I ruled out the possibility of it being explainable. The figure then distorts, moves away, distorts, comes closer. Repeats. \n\nAt this point I am beyond terrified and so I clasped my hands together and uttered with only a little bit of gumption \"In Jesus's name I pray...!\". What happened next will stay with me forever. As I choked out 'Jesus' the black shadow figure became a 7 foot tall a c t u a l shadow on the wall and ran into what was remaining of my backyard. I know there are many possible explanations but let me lay it down. \n\n1. We don't live facing onto the road, so that a shadow of someone walking past could have projected into our backyard.\n\n2. There is absolutely no way someone was on the roof of our house because every step made is echoed into the house. \n\n3. It really was not my father, as moments after praying I heard him snoring (he has a very distinct snore :') ). \n\nI'm so very sorry this was so long but that's it.

It's fine to unban, but I don't know if it would help at all.\n* Channel - Umm...\n* Demonic Consultation - I don't think 1 mana instant tutors is what we want as a 4 of, even with a heavy downside.\n* Demonic Tutor - HAHAHAHAHA\n* Earthcraft - It could be unbanned, I guess. It would make Enchantress better and would probably help Elves. It's about the same speed as SnT, but not in the blue.\n* Fastbond - Yea... I don't want to see Elves with Fastbond.\n* Flash - Nothing good can come out of this card.\n* Frantic Search - It's blue. I'm sure Felyne would be really, really happy if this happened, though.\n* Goblin Recruiter - Well, it would make a non-blue deck a hell of a lot more consistent. I don't think it's reasonable to unban.\n* Gush - No.\n* Hermit Druid - You basically untap and win the game, so I would say no.\n* Imperial Seal - Maybe? No one plays Personal Tutor, so who knows. If they do unban it, I would like it in the next Commander product.\n* Library of Alexandria - Nope.\n* Mana Crypt - Another strong no.\n* Mana Drain - Some people think it's fine to unban, but it's blue.\n* Mana Vault - Super monolith only exists to do incredibly broken things.\n* Memory Jar - C O M B O B O Y S\n* Mental Misstep - ಠ_ಠ\n* Mind Twist - It's worse than Hymn without a ton of fast mana and can't be cascaded in to. I say go for it.\n* Minds Desire - Blue. This card is so fun, but it's a bit absurd.\n* Mishra's Workshop - Imagine Vintage with Trinisphere unrestricted!\n* Mystical Tutor - More blue.\n* Necropotence - Storm would instantly be T0.\n* Oath of Druids - If Hermit Druid is still banned, Oath is still banned.\n* Shahrazad - ಠ_ಠ\n* Skullclamp - Still absurd.\n* Sol Ring - People want it banned in Commander.\n* Strip Mine - Noooooo\n* Survival of the Fittest - Because fuck fair decks.\n* Time Vault - Nothing good can come of a deck with 4 Time Vaults.\n* Tinker - lol?\n* Tolarian Academy - Not nearly as strong without the Moxen, but still no. Also, blue.\n* Treasure Cruise - ಠ_ಠ\n* Vampiric Tutor - Waaaaayyyy too good.\n* Wheel of Fortune - See Memory Jar.\n* Windfall - See Wheel of Fortune.\n* Yawgmoth's Bargain - Swamp, Ritual, Ritual, Mox Diamond, Yawgmoth's Bargain. Move to sideboarding?\n* Yawgmoth's Will - Imagine Vintage with unrestricted Lotus.\n\nAlmost everything either enables absurdly broken combos or makes blue even better.

{"body": "He transposes them over from Ionian mode (major) to Aeolian mode (minor) and vice versa. Debusatie explained this really well, but to explain it myself:\n\nSay you want to convert something in C minor (relative is Eb major), to C major. For this, you need to know the scales:\n\nC minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C\n\nC major: C D E F G A B C\n\nSo basically you take the third (Eb), sixth (Ab), and seventh (Bb) and raise them each by a half-step. What this guy does is he takes the songs and does this; raises those specific notes/intervals in the scale up by a half-step to change them into major.\n\nNow on your question on how can one \"translate\" songs like this, you can do it with any mode. For instance, lets say I want to play a song written in C major, but I want to transpose it to Ab harmonic minor (minor scale with a flat 7th), I would change it based on root note, so if some of the notes were, say, C E F A in the C major pattern, to transpose to Ab harmonic minor, I change the root from C to Ab, and play the same scale degrees in the different scale, which would be Ab B Db and E.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432669627", "subreddit": "musictheory", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "\n#Proto Koromi Discourse:\n\n##Differences in pronounciation between genders:\nThere are some differences in the pronunciation between men and women in Koromi.  Some of this is limited to dialects, such as the change from 'k' to 'q' word initially in Haxeski Koromi and Gegan Koromiya, which is done by male speakers. And as said in my initial phonology post, female speakers of all dialects tend to substitute ʋ with w.\n\n##The three major dialects of the Koromi people:\nThe Koromi people have a history as ancient as civilization on Firth. But things only really began getting interesting when the Koromi were seperated, either enslaved or driven into the desert of modern day Asarabah. The ones that were enslaved, were called the Haesci (/haeski/) by their masters, slave in their tongue. After several generations of abuse, slavery and who knows what else, the Haesci broke loose and fled South, to the mountaineous region that is modern day Tarkos. There, on the fields of ash they founded their own empire. These Koromi were known as the *Haxeski Koromi*, having taken on the name their former masters had given them. And their empire flourished, as it was the one with the most overseas contact along the Great East Channel. Eventually it collapsed into several smaller kingdoms, which were effectively just a less nomadic variant of the tribal system found up North, but by then they already spoke a daugher language derived from Proto-Koromi, so that's a point way past what we're looking at. \n\n\nDue to the enslavement of the Haesci, and the forced migration of the Koromi people into the Great Desert, the Proto-Koromi language became divided into three major dialects. \n\nThe first, is the *Haesci dialect*, spoken in the Haesci Empire, and the result of seperation from the other Koromi tribes, and influence from the nearby languages of Iccaria, from which this dialect loaned vocabulary and sounds. \n\nThe second is the *Zusus Koromiya dialect*,  the dialect of the desert Koromi. This is by far the largest of the three dialects, and it is the one we've been examining thus far. Due to its size, it is considered the standard dialect among the Koromi, but foreigners consider the Haesci dialect to be more influential, and are thus more likely to learn that dialect over the Zusus Koromiya's. \n\nThe third is the *Gegan Koromiya dialect*, the dialect of the Koromi living just North of the mountain range dividing the Haesci Empire and the Koromi desert. \n\n##Allophony and differences in pronunciation and speech:\n\n**Haesci Koromi:**\n\nThere are several distinct differences between Haesci Koromi and Zusus Koromiya, but the most important of them may be vocabulary. A lot of Haesci words dealing with tools and politics have been loaned from their former masters. \n\n\n*Phonemic differences:*\n&gt; The vowels a e i o u tend to become ɑ ɛ ɪ ɔ ʌ in the penultimate stressed syllable, or the last syllable of a word with 2 or less syllables. \n\n&gt; At the end of a word, /a/ turns into /e/ turning the possessed suffix -ya into -ye. \n\n&gt; Haesci Koromi tends to make a difference between ɔ and ʌ, writing them as o and ö respectively. \n\n&gt; When a verb ends in a vowel, Haesci Koromi doesn't add in a glottal stop to differentiate between the verb and the conjugation, instead it just tacks the conjugation onto the verb. Yeçexer in Zusus Koromiya is Yeçer in Haesci Koromi.\n\nI would include grammatical differences here, if I had any idea where to start. I'll look into Haesci Koromi's grammar later, but I'm probably going to make it either  more isolating, or more conjugating and verb-heavy. \n\n*Phonotactics:*\n\nZusus Koromiya has a strict (C)V(C) pattern, but due to lots of loans and general outside influence, Haesci Koromi is on its way in breaking loose from this pattern, allowing for more consonants next to eachother. Haesci Koromi follows a pattern of (C (s,l,r))V(C), which might be changed in the near future when I work more on their former masters' language. \n\n*Stress:*\n\nHaesci Koromi generally tends to keep to Zusus Koromiya's stress patterns. *Men* still pronounce the stress on the penultimate syllable, but women however tend to fix stress on the final syllable of a word. \n\n**Zusus Koromiya:**\n\nZusus Koromiya is the Koromi we've been taking a look at. It's the standard dialect of Proto-Koromi due to its size. And thus, due to the fact that is has already been covered extensively, I won't be repeating myself here.\n\n**Gegan Koromiya:**\n\nWhereas Haesci Koromi is distinctly different from Zusus Koromiya in both vocabulary and pronunciation, Gegan Koromiya only really differs in pronunciation. \n\n*Phonemic differences:*\n&gt; The vowels a e i o u become ɑ ɛ ɪ ɔ ʌ after a glottal stop. \n\n&gt; Gegan Koromiya does borrow some words from Haesci Koromi, which has led to a minor distinction between o and ʌ.\n\n&gt; Word initial o turns into ʌ.\n\n&gt; 'u' followed by a nasal turns into 'y'. \n\n\nGegan Koromiya doesn't really have a distinctly different grammar at this point, most of the changes between it and Zusus Koromiya is in its phonetics.\n\n##Dialects Swadesh List:\n\nHere are a few words from the Swadesh list to show the differences in pronunciation between the dialects. For the sake of illustration, verbs are conjugated according to the present tense and 3rd person. All of the entries are in IPA, as spelling and ortography have very little to do with pronunciation. \n\nSwadesh List|Zusus Koromiya|Haxeski Koromi|Gegan Koromiya|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\nman|bas|bɑs|bas|\nwoman|jal|jɑl|jal|\nfish|bes|bɛs|bes|\nsmall|dil|dɪl|dil|\nflesh|jax|jɑx|jax|\nblood|ɦe|ɦɛ|ɦe|\nbone|karka|qɑrka|qarka|\nhead|kas|qɑs|qas|\neat (v)|jexeʔer|jexɛr|jexeʔɛr|\nkill (v)|jejilir|jejilɪr|jejilir|\nhorn|dun|dʌn|dy|\nbone|ka|gɔr|qa|\nmoon|sir|sɪr|sir|\nstar|dilos|dilɔs|dilos|\nsun|os|ɔs|ʌs|\nmountain|gegan|gegɑn|gegan|\ndog|jak|jɑk|jak|\n\nThe Haesci Koromi word for 'bone' is actually a loanword, which is why it is so different from the others. While words in a swadesh list tend to not be loaned, this is one of the times in which they are.  \n\n##Discourse particles:\nZusus Koromiya has two notable discourse particles. One is a word on its own, the other is an infix. The word *eç* was featured in Semantics already, and was the equivalent of the English 'really'. Because, aside from asserting curiosity, it's also used to establish things. \n\n*Lor, eç, tirak yeyilir. - He, really, killed the camel.*\n\nAppart from that, there's the discourse particle *ata*. Which works like the diddly infix in English. \nIn case you guys haven't read about the diddly infix, you can do so [here.](http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/27/paper1827.pdf)\n\nAs the article says, the diddly infix is applied to a word with initial stress, in which the initial syllable is duplicated and the infix is applied.\n\nIn Zusus Koromiya, the same is done with *ata*.\n\n*Zusus. - Desert.*\n\n*Zu-(x)ata-zus. - De-diddly-desert.*\n\n***\n\n***\n\n*Hand movement in Koromi is nothing worth of note at this point. And while I might expand on it later, I doubt I will, which is why I haven't included it here.*\n\nDue to having some spare time this weekend, I made a map of the area in which the Koromi lived. Do note, this map is a few thousand years into the future, and its borders are not the best, [but here it is](http://imgur.com/EliGUK2).\n\nThe dialects are obviously still very WIP, and will be expanded on after ReCoLangMo.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432710876", "subreddit": "conlangs", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Then shall you hear more. You must make the squares of the first part of the table unto every square and his letters.\n\nΔ: I have made the squares of the first part and set in the letters.\n\nAVE: You have in the middle line \"oroibAhaozpi.\" There are 6 lines above and six below. That line is called *linea Spiritus Sancti* [line of the Holy Spirit] and out of that line come the three names of God from the East gate, being of 3, 4 and 5 letters, which were the arms of the Ensigns that were spoken of before: \"oro, ibah, aózpi.\" I said before that God the Father a mighty pillar divided with a right line. The father himself, without the line. The father and son by addition of the line, these two lines beginning:\n\n    f A\n    i d\n    a r\n\netc.; that is the great cross that came out of the East gate.\n\nΔ: With that line of the Holy Ghost?\n\nAVE: Aye. You have in the upper left angle in the second line, \"ardza.\" You have that makes the cross downward: first \"i,\" then the same \"doigo.\"\n\nΔ: Will you have six letters downward?\n\nAVE: Aye. So you have the three other crosses in their angles.\n\nΔ: Will you give me leave to repeat them for fear of erring? \"lLacza\" the down line of six letters, and \"paLam\" the cross line.\n\nAVE: It is so.\n\nΔ: Now the other on the left side below, \"aiaoai\" the down right line. Now the cross line is \"Oiiit.\" Here those crosses have ten faces. One letter is reckoned twice which is in the center of the cross, and so should seem to be eleven.\n\nAVE: This is true knowledge.\n\nΔ: The last cross is thus: his down line is \"aOurrz,\" the cross is \"alOai.\" So I have the 4 crosses attendant on the principal cross.\n\nAVE: Here you may see the cause that Pilate wrote with 4 letters.\n\nΔ: How does the cause appear?\n\nAVE: For above every cross stands 4 letters. Not that Pilate knew it, but that it was the fore-determination of God. They are thus to be read:  In the upper left angle you have \"rzla,\" pronounce \"urzla.\" By the name the first angel appears, \"zla.\" Go then to the first, and pronounce it \"zlar.\" That was, the first letter of the first angel is the last letter of the second; as of the first \"r\" was the first letter of the name, as \"rzla,\" that \"r\" is now the last letter of the name of the second angel, beginning at \"z\" as \"zla\" and look back again to the \"r\"\n\nΔ. SO that the third begins at \"l,\" whose last letter is the first of the second name, and is called \"larz,\" and so to the last as \"arzl,\" to be pronounced \"arzel.\" So that you have of those 4 letters 4 angel names, here thus gathered out; but how are they to be used?\n\nAVE: Let it be sufficient that you know these names. I will teach to use them.\n\nΔ. Shall we labor by like order of every [one] of the 4 letters over the crosses to make 4 such names?\n\nAVE: They are also to be made.\n\nΔ: I do know assuredly that there is very much matter in this table.\n\nAVE: It is true, for hitherto stretched the knowledge of Solomon. Now for your six seniors, whose judgement is of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. In the line *De Spiritu Sancto*, you have \"Abioro\" of six letters. The second name of the second senior is of 7, as the same, ascending \"Aaoxaif;\" of the third as the second *in patre &amp; filio*, \"HTmordA.\" Again in *Spiritu Sancto* \"haózpi.\" The fifth, *in patre &amp; filio descendens* [descending] \"hipotga.\" The sixth, \"AVtoTar.\" If you will make them of 7 letters, because two of them are but of six, that is when the wrath of God is to be increased. Note: then whereas you say \"Abioro\" say \"hAbioro,\" and where you say \"haozpi\" say \"Ahaozpi.\" You have \"haozpi;\" before \"h\" is \"A,\" take that unto it and make \"Ahaozpi.\" And so they consist all of 7 letters.\n\nYou have \"b\" the fifth in the left part of the line *de Spiritu Sancto*. You have \"a\" the sixth, the first part of the line *de patre &amp; filio* descending. \"T\" the sixth in the second part descending. \"a\" the first in the second part descending, or the second ascending. You have \"a\" the fifth in \"aozpi.\" \"i\" the sixth, and \"V\" the sixth ascending in the part descending of the line *de patre &amp; filio*, the second and first part. Put the \"A\" or the \"h\" that stand in the center to it: you have \"baTaiVA\" or \"baTaiVh.\" You must take but one of them, either the \"A\" or the \"h.\" \"A,\" *comiter* [more courteously] and \"h\" *in extremis Judiciis* [in extreme judgements].\n\nΔ: So I see when the contract \"A\" and when the contract \"h\" must end this word, that is the mighty prince whose train was holden up in the East.\n\n(*TFR*, p. 177–178 with corrections)\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432741321", "subreddit": "enochian", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Based on watching players like Clearlove, Bengi and Spirit who play a lot of Nunu, it is solely based on what you intend to do with the Nunu early. Also, there is the consideration of pro style vs. solo queue, but that's up for interpretation. \n\nQ max: Q max on Nunu is optimal in the case that your team should be focused on taking early dragons; either after making a play bottom and rotating to dragon, or just by bringing mid and bot to dragon and taking a dragon cleanly. Consequently, Q max Nunu presents with lesser gank pressure in the early game, as the e slow and damage scales with alotted points in the skill.\n\nE max: E max Nunu is optimal in the case that you wish to create a ruckus in the lanes at a very early stage of the game. E max is a very good idea when you have a champion that needs to snowball (huehue) early with a few ganks to hopefully burn some summoner spells on the enemy champion, or to even get some kills for your team. At level 9, ice blast is a 60% slow, single-target ability on a ~5 sec cd with cdr (6 sec, 0% cdr), so Nunu can be very effective in that sense, but it will naturally take away on your objective pressure around dragon.\n\nW max: N U N U S U P P O R T B O Y Z (Please don't do this :D)\n\nHope that helped, and if anyone wants to add on to that, please do.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432744634", "subreddit": "LeagueofLegendsMeta", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

I prefer Untitled, but that gets a bit boring too because he never switches up the subject matter.\n\n**ALLA** - idk what it is about Rocky but I always throw on his albums thinking that I like him and then remember that I don't. I've only given ALLA the one listen but I found it a bit dull. Production was nice and really cohesive but it got pretty monotonous. M'$ was tight though.\n\n**8Ball &amp; MJG** - more people need to listen to these guys, their first 3 albums are fucking great. Some of the best Southern hip-hop I've ever heard.\n\n**Cherry Bomb** - thought this was horrible at first but I keep coming back to it for some reason and it's really grown on me now. Definitely appeals to the punk fan in me.\n\n**Stress: The Extinction Agenda** - more people need to listen to Pharoahe Monch/Organized Konfusion too.

Just not my thing at all. Also I don't understand how NYC rappers sound more London than I do lol.\n\n**G I R L / BUSH** - saw someone on here describe BUSH as Snoop's G I R L and I totally see it haha.

Its nominal inflection is defined by the presence of strong and weak grades of the stem, also reinforced by ablaut. Nouns are either animate or inanimate. The word order is OSV, SOV in subordinate clauses.\n\n\nIt has four cases (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive), two numbers (singular, plural); its verbs have two tenses (present and preterite), two numbers (ditto), merge the first and third persons singular and the entire plural paradigm, and have a present, past and passive participle. \n\n\nThe singular forms of a noun are generally unpredictable; the genitive singlar is always weak and has the same ending as the accusative singular; the nominative plural is weak and ends in -z, the accusative plural ends in -z but is strong, the dative plural ends in -u preceded by the accusative singular ending and is strong, and the genitive plural is almost always -dz and is strong. Definitenes is marked by *ja* for animates and *ī* for inanimates.\n\n\nThere is an absurd amount of irregular verbs. Most regulars have a weak 1sg/3sg, and a strong 2sg that ends in -s; present plurals are weak and end in either -m or -n. Preterites always have a strong form; the 1sg/3sg preterite is either -d or -s, and the 2sg preterite is -st; the plural preterite is -nd. The present participle is weak and marked with -nd; the past participle is strong and marked with -t; the passive participle is strong and marked with either -z or -s (based on voicing environment). Irregular verbs may switch stem strength around; some verbs might not have different stems.\n\nThe pronouns are: ak/su/{uo/at} we/ī/am\n\n\n**Example Words**: neas/nuod/neaz/nead (night); heāts/heāt/huōt/heāt (horse); maz/mon/moṉ/man (man)\n\n\n**Sentences**: (too complex, so I'm using simpler ones)\n\nThe sun shines: *hīn sī*\n\nIt is raining: *rang at*\n\nYou are raining: *jengs su*\n\nYou are coming with us: *ma we keans su*\n\nIs it Monday: *Muodā as at?* \n\nDoesn't look anywhere near Germanic.

[j] are deleted.\n\nStops [p t k tɕ] persistently become aspirated [pʰ tʰ kʰ tɕʰ] after a glottal fricative.\n\nBack vowels [u] become central [ʉ] before a front consonant.\n\nBefore a front vowel or a palatal semivowel, [kʰ k x] become [t͡ɕʰ t͡ɕ ɕ].\n\n**Basic Grammar:** \n\nIt's an isolating, analytic language. Word order is SOV, V2 in subordinate clauses.\n\nIt has three cases (nominative, accusative and genitive) and no number. For verbs, there are 4 tenses (preterite, imperfect, present and future) and two aspects (simple and progressive), both shown with particles. There are three moods (indicative, imperative and reflexive) shown by ablaut in the verb. Only first and third person, with use of demonstrative adjectives to account for lack of second person. Gerund formed with a clitic ('m/'ym) at the end of the verb infinitive (the original stem). The copula is dropped in present tense.\n\nNominative and accusative cases determined by word order, genitive with the clitic twm. Indicative mood preserves the original verb, imperative changes the ultimate syllable's vowel to [w], reflexive to [y]. As such, the ultimate syllable of  a verb only allows the vowel [a], while the opposite is true for other parts of speech. \n\nAdjectives and adverbs directly follow what they are describing and always ends in one of /m p h/. The definite article (chw) goes before the noun and and is attached as ch' if the noun begins in a vowel. The indefinite is not shown.\n\nVerb tense particles, placed directly before the verb and aspect, are ky for preterite, kyh for imperfect, and lwma for future (present is unmarked).

{"body": "Couple things:\n\nCasual mode. Why would you tack it on a feature introduced by awakening when you even recognize that it was introduced by New Mystery of The Emblem? In fact, why skip so many games of the series? You keeping talking about how Awakening has changed everything, but neglect almost half of the installments in the series (1 and 11 were only given two minutes in your first video, which is basically a slap in the face, and you just bounced on 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, and 12).\n\nAutobattle. I've never personally used this function myself, and in truth I've forgotten about it till you brought it up, but again, it's not unique to awakening. Gaiden has a few functions when pressing on the map that allows you to auto-pilot your characters instead of selecting all of them individually. Like you said, it's not inherently bad, as if it fits into your plan (M A S S A S S A U L T B O Y S), then why not use it. But this is why skipping games is bad.\n\nRoute the enemy. I'll admit, this is a big flaw of Awakening...but it's not a unique flaw. Sword of Seals, which I've made a case for before on this exact topic, offers only seizing missions, but distractions along with that to keep the player entertained.\n\nGameplay. To say there was little effort put into the gameplay is a huge insult to the developers who worked on the title, and again, shows a lack of attention. Awakening has a massive amount of replayability due to reclassing and and parenting aspects. Awakening's gameplay goes beyond just what you see on the map, and I think that should be noted.\n\nCharacters:\n\nSaying Vaike and Stahl have no motivation to join the Shepherds shows that you didn't read enough of Awakening. Vaike especially, because in two supports (Cordelia and Sully), details *exactly what you said doesn't exist*. And if we're talking about motivation and characterization, what's there to be said of Alec or Noish, or Arden? Why did they become knights, why do they fight? Who the hell knows. \n\nAgain, to quote myself from the Sword of Seals video:\n\n&gt; \"It's these kind of generalizations that make people ignore the very aspects you say are missing.\"\n\nThe rest of the character part was hard to chew through because, just like in sword of seals, it is so mocking and trivial that it blatantly shows that you already had your mind set before you even started studying for these videos.\n\nWith Emmeryn's death, how can you say it never comes up when the next two chapter's are Chrom seeking revenge? When the music and scenery symbolizes his and Lissa's pain? When Chrom still tries to learn from and emulate Emmeryn long after she's gone?\n\nWith Cordelia's loss of her comrades and Virion's departure from his country, you say you want them to come up more...but this is contrary to your other videos where you derided them for being too \"samey\". Which is it? This argument becomes even weaker when you bring up that, again, that almost none of the conversations don't bring up the war or the aspects of war (which is just blatantly untrue), and that most of them are too comedic. \n\nHumans are allowed to be happy even in the most dire of circumstances. That's how people survive. \n\nMaybe it's because there's a lot less to comb through, but insinuating that Kris revealed and opened up more characters then Robin does is just...wrong. I mean, it's one of the few things Kris does right when it comes to narrative, but again, it's just easy to tell how much you actually read of Awakening.\n\nYou're right about some of the romances being really cheesy, but it's not *that* bad.\n\nAgain, Fire Emblem has a formula. What happened in Geneaology, Awakening, Blazing Sword...they're all riffs.\n\nGangrel is the *mad* king, mind you, driven so by his desire to help the people pf his country, but is in turn changed into the same king that waged war on his home for so long. That's pretty complex in my eyes.\n\nTo say the Walhart and Validar are on the same level in terms of villainy just means you didn't read enough...again. This is especially bad considering Walhart has much less needed reading than most other characters, so...yikes.\n\nI agree with your nitpicks.\n\nIllusion of choice...how so far it goes. I agree here, wholeheartedly. For the most part, your choices don't matter, and that's a real problem. \n\nI've yet to see Time Travel written fluently outside of Futurama and Doctor Who. Take that for what you will.\n\nChrom does nothing remotely heroic? Leading a militia, rescuing towns and characters because he saw they were in need, and taking charge of a Theocracy sounds pretty heroic to me.\n\nNew Mystery's avatar did a lot more to deter the Lord's credibility and be masturbatory then Awakening's could even dream of. I don't see how you could suggest otherwise. \n\nLike, that's just cruel.\n\nI'll admit, going into the series, I expected it to turn out like this, but I was willing to be wrong too.\n\nI wasn't, and I'm disappointed. \n\nLooking forward to your next video.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432848077", "subreddit": "fireemblem", "score": 56, "controversiality": 0}

Red/yellow then appears right in front of me as I do that, so the d move puts the slot into the back, learnt this trick originally from Feliks, but didn't start using it until after I saw Collin's video. Putting the solved slots on the back means you can see all the remaining pieces, and makes lookahead easier.\n\nThe orange/white edge is fairly easy to join to white orange - no rotation is needed to match it (only for the insert). Rotating back the top layer lets me pair that up as I bring it into the top layer.

{"body": "Just do it. Enlisting is not as difficult as you might think (literally walk into your nearest recruiting station during business hours; you don't have to call in advance, but you should).\n\nYou already have a degree. Talk to a recruiter for getting a commission as an Officer (lots of paper work, long wait period [6+++ mos] for feedback). Obviously, you've already waited a fairly long time, so... with a degree, you're already at the top of every branch of services queue when enlisting. I know you're after a sense of \"brotherhood,\" but that stuff doesn't grow on trees, even here.\n\n* **Join the Air Force or Navy [in that order]**. Better policies in regards to personnel (i.e. less \"mommy-ing\"), generally better promotion rates, **less daily B.S. to deal with** (this is a big one), general better quality of life, etc. will do you much more good during your term of service, however short or long you choose to stay.\n\n* **Don't join the Army.** A B S O L U T E L Y  DO NOT (sorry if this offends anyone). This will make you more depressed. I don't know a single soldier who ~~does not complain~~ is happy about their job.\n\n* Join the Marines if you already are in a decently physically fit position and/or willing to get fit (i.e. do &gt;20 pullups no sweat) before enlisting. Be realistic here.\n\nThere are SO. MANY. opportunities you obtain with enlisting- finding out about and then taking advantage of them is definitely the most difficult part. If all you want is work experience and time to sort out your life and career path, you will get plenty of it regardless of service. With your degree, you can literally walk into the recruiting station and say \"I want to do ___this___ job\" and not get shot down (if they shoot you down, check the next branch of service over). It doesn't have to be even remotely related to your degree. \n\n* Have you ever wanted to learn coding, or how to hack people? That's a hot and recruiting en-masse field these days. \n\n* Want to learn engineering (electrical, mechanical, nuclear etc.)? Also another field you should get no problem. \n\n* Want to learn another language entirely? That's also an option. \n\n* Can you play an instrument well? Join the band (it's the only job that has a pre-requisite unfortunately).\n\nOf course, you've already learnt and might be done learning (after all, who would want to go through another year of intensive schooling?), and you might not want to pursue anymore than your degree, which is fine. And you want experience. Which you'll get regardless of job. You might not be thinking about your career currently, or you might be more worried about getting out of a depression rut. Whatever you choose to do in regards to enlisting, it will be a complete change of scenery and wake-up call from whatever reality you're currently facing- so don't worry about that aspect; just remember: **your problems won't simply disappear when you join, but you will have more than plenty of opportunities to work them out during your term in.**\n\n**TL;DR:** Just enlist. Not in the Army if at all possible (it will come back to bite you in the arse within a few months if you don't have the personality for it).\n\nEdit 1: In regards to therapy, if you enlist, the healthcare provided should allow you to see pretty much any therapist you want in the area you are stationed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432856981", "subreddit": "depression", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Ghost is better vs skillshots/when you are worried about getting kited.\n\n&gt;People say use Q to harass and CS with autos. I've found that vlad is one of the hardest champs to cs with in the game early. How do people rack up such high numbers while maintaining harass early game?\n\npractice. You look at pros who have played for thousands of  games + multiple years you wanna guess how many total minions they've last hit ? A ton. \n\n&gt;[Itemization] Is revolver always a must? Should I sometimes rush cdr boots first? Would it ever make sense to rush seeker's first if i'm losing or do I lose too much by not getting the revolver?\n\nA must? Yeah. You don't need to rush it though. Seekers first/negatron first in hard matchups. Vs Riven I believe it works well to go seekers =&gt; rylais/hourglass before you get any spellvamp because spellvamp does nothing to deal w/ riven allin.\n\n&gt;I've found I lose duels early game ridiculously hard versus some champs, namely Lee Sin. How can I know when I will win all-in trades? It's so hard to naturally know when I can all-in and when I need to turtle and keep farming.\n\nlike 90% of matchups (matchups you bully early are champs like Shen Mao etc and other tanky melees but you have to be careful around getting ganked early) you do not win trades/allins till level 9 and some combination of lucidity boots/revolver/wota/seekers/negatron. Usually your job is to just afk farm to 9, poking if possible. Stuff that allins well like Riven, Irelia, Lee, etc is a struggle. Prioritize seekers and health over spellvamp.\n\n&gt;I run CDR glyphs runes. Is this necessary or should I switch it to scaling AP? \n\nDo you need it to CDR cap? Typically lucidity boots + wota + visage + 5% from masteries is used. When you are going to go abyssal, or mercs/tabi/sorcs you wanna swap in cdr from runes. Also MR is mandatory in a lot of matchups.\n\n&gt;Ideal combo is E Q R W E Q for all in\n\nHonestly I think pooling on Vlad for  damage is fuckin terrible. Run in, QER and use pool to kite/disengage/get up extra cooldowns. It's way better to use spell rotations =&gt; pool when you get focused/dove =&gt; get more spell rotations =&gt; hourglass = &gt;3rd spell rotation than to run in, QER pool =&gt; hourglass =&gt; get focused. Vlad is a dps type mage. It's like diving with Azir, there's no fucking reason to do that, you do damage per time you are alive and have mediocre burst.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432865853", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Disclaimer: I hate Kat with a passion.\n\nKatarina's strengths rely in getting poke down and going for the full engage/resets after the fact. She has high opportunity cost since she only has one direction to go. In OR out. LeBlanc puts herself in minimal danger with W Q R E and doesn't even let the E proc to get her damage off that's close enough to one shot a carry. So even though I hate Kat, she's not even close to OP; relying on spotting opportunity vs creating opportunity like LB's kit. \n\nRegarding the main topic: The width of  the chain is important because as you return to different locations of the map the chain's missile position is changed so if you wouldn't be hit by it normally, because you've changed position and thus the angle that the missile is mid air, that sudden change can make it hit you. Lowering the width basically lets you dodge the first aspect and have it remaining as dodged even when the missile orientation changes.

{"body": "Suppose that miners constrolling a fraction P of the total hashrate colluded to push the fees up by filling the queues with dummy transactions, all with a transaction fee of F bits.  Then ordinary clients will have to issue transactions with a fee greater than F to get through.  \n\nSuppose the clients issue M normal transactions per day.  The miners will issue N bogus transactions per day, adjusting N so that N + M is the mining network's capacity, on average.\n\nThen those miners will collect at least P x (N + M) x F in fees, and spend N x F to issue the bogus transactions.  The \"attack\" will be profitable if  (P x (N + M) − N) x F is greater than P x M x F0, where F0 is the current average fee (very small).\n\nFor example, setting P = 0.75 (roughly the 10 top mining pools) and F0 = 0.0001 BTC,  and assuming M is 50% of the maximum network capacity (i. e. M = N), the attack would be profitable if (2 x 0.75 − 1) x F &gt; 0.75 x 0.0001, that is, F &gt; 0.00015 BTC.\n\nOn the other hand, if M was only 10% of the network's capacity (that is, N = 9 M) then the attack would not be profitable, because the condition would be (10 x 0.75 - 9) x F &gt; 0.75 x 0.00001, which is false for any F.\n\nOf course this is not so simple, because a higher fee would cause the traffic to shrink.  But it indicates that a larger block size would make this attack unprofitable, by requiring so many bogus transactions that the attacking miners would lose more than  they would gain.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1432989507", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think the red herring there was focusing on mutability. As you say in your post:\n\n&gt; With an OO language, it's pretty easy. You have Boxes, which are located on a shelf, which belongs to a racking etc ... Everything has a name, a position and things are mutable. .i.e I can rename a shelf, turn a box easily.\n\nThat's how I'd model it in Haskell:\n\n    data Warehouse = Warehouse {warehouseIsles :: ![Isle]}\n    data Isle = Isle {isleShelves :: ![Shelf]}\n    data Shelf = Shelf {shelfBoxes :: ![Maybe Box]}\n    data Box = Box \n\nBut without the mutability. Forget about mutating. [Here's an example paste of using the data structures I defined](http://lpaste.net/8783033985165950976). I can add a box to the warehouse and it will pick the first isle and shelf where it can fit from the bottom up. Hence the output:\n\n    λ&gt; fromJust (foldM (flip addToWarehouse) warehouse (replicate 50 Box))\n    B B B B B B\n    B B B B B B\n    B B B B B B\n    B B B B B B\n    B B B B B B\n\n    _ _ _\n    B B _\n    B B B\n    B B B\n    B B B\n    B B B\n    B B B\n    B B B\n\n    _ _ _ _ _ _\n    _ _ _ _ _ _\n    _ _ _ _ _ _\n    _ _ _ _ _ _\n    _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nIf I want to remove the third box from the second shelf on the second isle I can just have a function `removeBox :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int` and do `removeBox 3 2 2`. If I was making a GUI, I wouldn't have to use numbers, I'd just build up the UI so that it knows how to produce the data structure with or without a box in a slot. If I wanted to label the boxes with a globally identifiable barcode, rather than reference them by order, I could have `removeBox :: Barcode -&gt; Warehouse -&gt; Warehouse`, which would search the Warehouse and produce a new warehouse without that box. It could also be `getBox :: Barcode -&gt; Warehouse -&gt; (Warehouse,Box)` which would produce a new warehouse and the box in question. And so on. With the pure data structure you can also trivially go back in time to trace modifications or try out scenarios speculatively (which is partly what I do in `addToWarehouse` with `thisIsle &lt;|&gt; nextIsle`, that tries two possibilities and picks the first one that works).\n\nDecoupling everything into some kind of relational database with IDs mapping objects to objects kind of defeats the purpose of modeling this in Haskell.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1433003226", "subreddit": "haskell", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The irony of gil spam is that players like myself who are on one of the low pop servers are typically going to end up with more gil spam than those on the high pop servers, not by design but as a consequence of how everything comes together. I'm consistently getting multiple tells and at least one friend request per hour on *Zalera* which has the lowest or second lowest population. It's not unusual at all to rack up 10 or so tells in an hour of play and I don't know how many friend requests, I don't bother counting them any longer and all the gil spam has become sort of background noise at this point. \n\nGil spam bots, as I understand, typically go by alphabetical order of character names to send out their spam. This means that on a high population server like Balmung or Gilgamesh it's going to take them a bit longer to reach if your name is lower in alphabetical order, so all else being equal Asuna Uzumaki is likely to get hit faster and more often with the spam than Yuki Ackerman. Of course the same applies to low pop servers like Jenova and Zalera, with the difference being that the number of players they have to spam is far less and so it will take much less time to spam everyone to Z and cycle back through to A again. So let's say, for instance, that you've got 25 Ggatm'com Sellgisfsdrs ballyhooing their Chinglish babble to 1,000 players on Server One and 25 tellers from the P V P B A N K saying \"hi bro excuse me\" to only 200 players on Server Two. It's going to take longer for the bots on Server One to get through that larger pool of players, and if you log in at the right time or your character's name is Xenarra Zaldanax then you might get only a few before you log out. Server Two, however, has so few players to target for spam that you're virtually guaranteed to get hit with it more often because it's easier for the tellers at the Bank of PVP to target everyone who's online. If your blacklist is full like mine then you're also going to get spammed by the same bot multiple times as it reaches the end of the line and starts over again.\n\n At first glance it would seem to make more sense that gil sellers would want to be more active on the busiest servers in order to reach more players with their ads, that's just good business sense to target a larger audience of potential customers. So you might expect to see more spam on Balmung or Gilgamesh than you would on Zalera or Jenova, but from my experience and that of so many others, it's usually the direct opposite. Why? Because Zhang Wei over at the RMT empire in some Shenzen basement is going to be dealing with the same character creation lockouts as everyone else. You can get a new account going any time, day or night, 24/7 365 on Zalera whereas you'll have to catch that small window of opportunity to get into the big servers.\n\n In other words, not only are you easier to get to on the low pop servers, I'd be willing to bet that there are also typically *more* bots and spammers operating on Zalera and Jenova at any given time than Balmung or Gilgamesh. This is even more noticeable on low pop servers right after the periodic mass bans like the one we just had, because this means that Zhang Wei &amp; Co have to get their new accounts up and running.  Character creation restrictions means they'll be able to make any number of new accounts on a low pop while a crowded server will be largely inaccessible. The day of or the day after a mass ban is when I see by far the most spam on Zalera, and I think this is exactly why. \n\nIt'd be interesting to see some real, solid numbers backed by facts and data. Anecdotes and conjecture, mine included, are all just that. It makes sense and sounds right, but I'd love to see some hard data on the ins and outs of the RMT network.

{"body": "Oh, you're welcome mate, it's always nice when people are receptive to what I have to say.\n\nI just want to say again that your voice change in their definitely isn't something you should completely exclude from any future work, I just don't think it fits to put both voices in a single verse like that. I think they could go in the same song pretty well, just as long as they're in separate verses.\n\nWell, I'd say that there are a few lines, here and there, which I think could do with a minor tweak. Like in your 4th line, you finished on 'dawn' with the same inflection as your 3rd line. To me, it sounded like you were trailing off, and I think it would be better if you put in a single extra syllable (probably just a 'the' would suit nicely) in right before it and changed the inflection to make it similar to your first two lines. That would make your first four lines go in something like an A A B A fashion (although, I think the third line is pretty similar, still, so maybe you could call it an A A a A scheme? I dunno) and that would help it go a lot smoother and you wouldn't be changing the rhyme scheme back and forth every two lines. I just think that the shortness of the 3rd line (not saying that it's a bad thing) kind of excludes it from having any continuous flow with another line. It's more of a set up line (since it's only half a bar long), if you know what I mean. You did a similar thing in lines 7 and 8  but I think you pulled it off much better, so no need to worry about that part there.\n\nIn line 8, which is where you started to change your vocal style, you start speaking your syllables in short, sharp bursts and with a lot of emphasis. It does highlight the change in your voice, which is good, but I feel that it also detracts from the flow and is a bit jarring. I think you should keep a strong emphasis on \"seems\", \"-long\", \"tell\", \"wrong\" and normalise the rest. Because if you go back and listen through it, you'll feel the emphasis on your previous lines like \"DELicate BALance\" (where you were highlighting your rhymes) and it follows a specific pattern that I think you may have forgotten when you got to your 8th line because you were focused on something else. I'm not sure if that makes sense to you, so please tell me if I should explain it another way.\n\nAlready touched on the vocal change (sing-songy vs going hard) so no real need so I'll skip that part\n\nIn your 14th line \"probly getting real high, doubt I cared about that\" I think you should have kept the same inflection at the end to match the flow of your 13th line. So instead of going real hard on the last few words in that line, I think you should have kept it a little melodic like the line 13. This way, I think it would have made a point of not caring because you would have showed that you didn't even care enough to change the tone of your voice for it, you know? I don't know, I've listened to your piece so much that I think I'm starting to read into it all a little too much. Doing this would also give your final line a bigger impact because it (your final line) would sound different from the previous three lines and truly close the rhyme scheme and the verse.\n\nI was also going to say something about the way you said \"attributes\" but after listening to it a  lot more, I'm happy with the way you've done that, it works better than what I was going to suggest.\n\nThat's ~~pretty much~~ (holy fuck I wrote a lot) all I can come up with, so I hope you find it worthwhile to read. Let me know if I need to explain more about anything that I wrote here. I understand exactly what I meant by all of this, but it can be hard to convey the idea correctly to others.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1433045279", "subreddit": "makinghiphop", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Apologies for the late reply, I'm eager to improve but don't want to half-ass my work, so I've been waiting to get enough time to give this exercise my full attention.\n\nIt's all good, man. Thanks for taking this so seriously; your desire to learn and improve is evident.\n\n&gt;I ended up with the following example finished, but then realised I hadn't resolved either of the F#s, so came to the following melody. \n\n(Yes, that is an escape tone. Typically, escape tones and appoggiaturas resolve the opposite direction of the leap though.)\n\nBoth are actually okay in this case. The important thing is that **the resolution happens when there is a chord change**. I made a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/Dl1MBcd.jpg) to explain.\n\n• In the first example, there is an F# at the beginning of the measure, and it moves down to D. This is acceptable, because is moving within the chord. Because we're still on the D chord, F# D is a perfectly reasonable melodic movement. Ditto on the F# A at the end of the first measure. Those are also justified by the fact that both the F# and the A are technically resolving to G. Consider that F# and A are \"surrounding\" G. At that point, it’s sort of like there are two “micro-melodies”: F#-G and A-G. The leading tone resolution is slightly delayed.\n\n• The second example is more of what I instructed you to do. The leading tone resolves directly, so there's no ambiguity.\n\n• The third example is incorrect because the leading tone is active at the end of the measure and we expect it to resolve, but then it goes somewhere completely different.\n\n&gt;I used an authentic cadence (V - &gt; I) in the final bar. I find it difficult to distinguish between phrases. Should I have used a cadence at other points in my melody or is this sufficient?\n\nCadences are harmonic. Your last two measures have the chord progression G Bm | Em G. These chords don’t make any cadence. Try using these progressions instead:\n\nAuthentic cadence: G D | G\n\nPlagal cadence: D G | C G\n\nHalf cadence: G C | D\n\nDeceptive cadence: G D | Em\n\n\n&gt;My melody is quite different since my last reply as I tried to fit the criteria (particularly repeating notes, where I ended up repeating 3 Ds and 3 As anyway :/)\n\nBoth melodies are markedly improved. I don't think that you have too many D's or A's. It's a good amount. What I want you to look at now is the melodic contour: you start at a low point, gradually work your way up to a high point, then come back down to the low point again. This is very good. What you don't want is a melody that starts low, goes high, goes low, then goes high, then goes somewhere in the middle, on and on without a clear direction. Both versions of your melody show good contour.\n\n&gt;Finally, I'm not sure I fully grasped this:\n\n&gt;I took this as ensuring I my highest note and lowest note do not repeat - except with G. I felt I should start and end on G, but I'm not sure if this was the right thing to do\n\nYou interpreted my meaning well. Sorry, I was being a little too verbose there. Also, your instinct is correct: it is good to begin and end a melody on the same note, and this overrides the \"only one highest/lowest note\" rule. The main thing is that the highest/lowest note of the melody does not occur more than once in the **middle** of the melody, because then the dramatic value of those notes is diluted.\n\n&gt;Finally, when finishing this new melody, I didn't know whether to shift the higher up notes (G, A, B in the 3rd measure) down an octave or leave them be. Is there a means to choose which octave the note should be in, or is it just personal preference?\n\nPersonal preference. However, melodies usually have logic. A good general rule is to keep the entire melody within the range of an octave, with the occasional step above or below that range. This, for instance, is a good “tessitura” (range of a melody): \n\n(F#) G A B C D E F# G (A)\n\nThe parenthesized notes are the notes you can use occasionally at the top and bottom of the tessitura. Since your lowest note is G, you can bump it up a little:\n\nG A B C D E F# G (A) (B)\n\n&gt;Again, thank you for your time and your help!\n\nYou’re welcome. When I have time again, I’ll help you to synthesize this stuff into phrases, periods, and sections. Then, you stick the sections together and get something that sounds like a song.\n\nI gotta say, I’m very impressed by how much you’ve picked up in this short amount of time.

Sometimes if I'm out and see and incredibly sexy but assholish guy who I have nothing in common with I sometimes can't stop myself from fantasising about dragging him into a bathroom and ripping his clothes off. The fact that he's an asshole and I kinda already hate him sort of intensifies the feelings of sexual attraction: like we've got nothing in common, your personality distresses me but damnit I want to fuck you so badly. Tbh I've has sex with guys under this pretence before and it was a m a z i n g.\n\nROMANTIC attraction on the other hand is a lot different for me. I guess in my own way I become more charming, more feminine. Those are the type of guys that I just want to impress and talk to all night.

{"body": "##Name\n\nThe name **Héyaume** comes from the phrase **hé yaum**, *I converse*.  \n\n##Backstory\n\nThe language is spoken by an isolated group of advanced people living in a forest. Their religion is centred around intrinsic duality of gender, and spiritual life, as reflected in the language. They attribute aspects of life to everything through the four elements, from the wind blowing through the forest to the forest itself. The people are scientifically-minded, with an organised time-keeping system based on running water, and a consistent base-10 counting and measuring system. Those who study science, **aumogamé**, *nature-studiers*, are very important in the society, as are those that study the passing of time, **ansathémé**, *time-seers*, who record the past, and predict the future. The people view themselves as moving upwards in time, giving an explanation as to why things fall to the ground. The word **an** combines the meanings of *time* and *space* (to keep the duality, **an (M)** means *time*, and **an (F)** means *space*). This is seen throughout the language, such as **and** meaning both *hour* and *metre*, and **douan** mean both *before* and *below*.\n\n##Phonology and Orthography\n\n||Front|Central|Back|  \n:--|:--|:--|:--|  \nClose||ʉ|u ʊ|  \nClose-Mid|e||o|  \nOpen-Mid|ɛ|ɐ||  \n\n/ʉ u ʊ e o ɛ ɐ/  \n&lt;ou oo u é o e a&gt;  \n\n||Bilabial|Labio-Dental|Dental|Alveolar|Palatal|Velar|Glottal|  \n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|  \nNasal|m|||n||||  \nPlosive|b||d|||g||  \nFricative|||θ|s||||  \nApproximant||ʋ|||j||h|  \n\n/m n b d ɡ θ s ʋ j h/  \n&lt;m n b d g th s w y h&gt;\n\n##Morphosyntax\n\nThere are two genders in Héyaume: masculine, and feminine. Each noun has a gender, and adjectives and adverbs agree with it. If groups contain both genders, masculine is used. Numbers only exist in pronouns and pro-forms, where there is a singular-plural distinction. The alignment is direct, so there are no cases. The word **hé** covers *I*, *me*, *my*, *myself*, and *mine*.  \n\nThe unmarked tense is present. The past tense requires the part **ya** at the beginning of the phrase, and the future tense requires **yem**. There are no aspects. There are 13 moods, which conjugate by suffix, as shown below.  \n\nMood|Suffix|English|Héyaume|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n**Infinitive**|-ag|To Talk|Odag|\n**Indicative**||Talks|Od|\n**Abilitive**|-agoo|Can Talk|Odagoo|\n**Attemptive**|-énth|Try to Talk|Odénth|\n**Causative**|-uthma|Make Talk|Oduthma|\n**Conditional**|-ég|Would Talk|Odég|\n**Desiderative**|-éno|Want to Talk|Odéno|\n**Imperative**|-ugo|Talk|Odugo|\n**Initiative**|-um|Start to Talk|Odum|\n**Necessitative**|-athu|Must Talk|Odathu|\n**Optative**|-emasé|Let Talk|Odemasé|\n**Potential**|-emé|Might Talk|Odemé|\n**Precative**|-atho|Please Talk|Odatho|\n\n##Semantics\n\nSome Idioms:  \n1. **Goyan youém** - *The water flows* (time is passing)  \n2. **Goma hemen démba** - *The last drops fall* (time is running out)  \n\nThe semantic network is based on the culture, such as time moving upwards, the intrinsic duality of gender, and the importance of life and nature. Héyaume has its own colour spectrum, grouping most colours into three term: **aden** (red, orange, brown), **éwhe** (green, blue), and **uthén** (light green, yellow). There is also a collection of 26 basic smell terms with their own roots.\n\n##*The North Wind and the Sun*\n\n**Ya Mou hOwhan heHémadgo yaum thu hesogé é thoméhan, thu han ya yoomé oom thu sego ye béoggo.

As it stands, PkD's overall player level is just better than everyone else. They practice a lot, artier/bunga and linkz are currently probably the best players in their positions and the rest of their players are no slouches either. As a team they've improved significantly over the last month, whereas their past contenders seem to be stagnating. Most likely they'll keep winning every tournament convincingly until either a really good team switches over from some other game, or the best players from the other top teams create a new team to challenge them.\n\nL O B B Y B O Y Z have pulled out of the cup due to player issues.

{"body": "Lol I really can't get a good break in life. So I just got hired for a temporary job about 25 miles away from me, and then now certain people at home want me to commute. Why? Because one of them wants to drive the truck to work... in the same city we're in.\n\nHow does that make sense? I'm the one who's gonna be traveling 50 miles a day, and I'm the one who's supposed to take the bus now? Hell, the earliest bus is 5:25am and there are two transfers. One late stop or one traffic jam and I'm gonna be extremely late for work. Not like I'm not gonna give them more than half of what I make (again) anyway.... \n\nI just really wish  somebody rich would just take me so that I could just live a peaceful life. Damn, I must have been Hitler or some really evil person in the past if crappy things like this keep happening to me everytime I'm about to have something nice happen in my life.\n\nIf I had magic powers, I'd go rip open a dimensional portal and create my own peaceful universe to live in.\n\nAnyway, my favorite subject in school was... hmm there's a bunch! Music and literature! I loved reading the random stories in our books. They were so entertaining that I kept reading them and treated them like comic books even though the teacher hasn't assigned them yet lol :) There's this one story I remember about naughty kids who lived in a mountain. It was about a mysterious floating lamp at night that they weren't supposed to approach, but being the naughty kids they were, they of course chased it. When they got near it, the person holding the lamp was revealed to be a rotting demon of the forest who kidnapped and ate children. That was a fun story indeed lol :D\n\nAs for music, I naturally loved the subject because it was the time when I could freely play the piano at school and get applauded and given good grades for it. It felt good doing what I loved knowing that others also enjoyed my playing style :)\n\nI also loved science related subjects :D I was very interested in how things worked anyway, as well as how chemicals interacted with one another. I think I still know some of the periodic table of elements :O H He Li Be B C N O F Ne... or something like that hahaha :D When I was a kid, I wanted to make smoke bombs like what Batman used, so I researched how to make it. I ended up finding something called \"The Anarchist's Cookbook\" LOL! Too bad the stuff needed weren't readily available, oh well hahaha :)\n\nIf I could though, I want to try to experiment with DNA and things like that. I want to try combining different traits of different animals and see what would come out. A frog with a cat's tail? A dog with a lizard's tongue? Very interesting hehehe :D Maybe I could do what some scientists are doing, borrowing traits like night vision from animals that have it and making some kind of temporary eye drops that would let me see like them (just like one scientist recently did) :D Science is very fun if you have the imagination to experiment lol :D\n\nI was never good with Physics though. Too many calculations, I always needed a calculator for that. Damn, Phsysics was probably my lowest graded subject in college lol :D Still, it would've been fun knowing how to calculate trajectories, weight limits, and other important stuff. I'm pretty sure those calculations would be very useful when it comes to creating homemade stuff :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1433104970", "subreddit": "Random_Acts_Of_Amazon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "P e r s p e c t i v e. Some people do enjoy to complain about irrelevant stuff and be bothered by the slightest things. Pretending otherwise is asinine, and our feelings *are* invalid sometimes. Not everything is a valid complaint, not everything has to be taken seriously. And, obviously, our problems have degrees of severity.  \n\nThis argument is misused a lot, however its constant misuse doesn't invalidate its worth, when used in the right situations.\n\nI'll give an personal example: I'm chronically ill, yes? One the most annoying symptoms when I'm at my worst is that everything sucks. Everything. My life is terrible and nothing ever works and I hate everyone. Stepping back and realizing that things aren't as bad as they could be keeps me sane.\n\nLet's face it, folks, that sometimes we have to suck it up. \n\n(Which doesn't mean I agree the scenarios posted in the OP are the correct situations to use this argument, it depends a lot on the context, person, etc. You will notice my example is me doing this to myself. That's because I know when it applies to me and when it does not.)\n\nEdit: The \"someone always has it better\" argument, however, is largely more useless than \"someone always has it worse\". Why? Because once all of our basic needs (as in actual basic needs) are met, we have everything to be satisfied with our lives. Doesn't matter if someone else has more. If you have enough, you can be happy for yourself. Not everyone is going to be happy though, which is fine, as long as it is within reason. No one needs a lake house to be happy, so why does it matter if someone else has it and you don't? On the other hand, everyone needs food...

{"body": "C, F, Am and Em are all diatonic chords (based on scale)for C major scale. And they are not even that far apart. If bass plays F over Am you can think about Am as Fmaj7. And with C in bass over Em it becomes  Cmaj7. Bottom line Am and F (and C and Em) are somewhat exchangeable in diatonic harmony.      \nRelated minor scale to C major is A natural minor (6th mode - Aeolian - of major scale): A B C D E F G A. Problem with this scale is weak resolution to tonic (G - &gt; A). If you play some diatonic chord progression you will not get same strong sense of resolution as in major scale where 5th chord G7 (4 note chord built on 5th step of the scale G B D F) resolves to C - with B-&gt;C and F-&gt;E. 5th chord of natural minor is Em7 (E G B D) and you get G-&gt;A and B-&gt;C.        \nYou can enhance that resolution by using G# instead. Then you deal with different chord - E7 (E G# B D) and different scale: A B C D E F G# A - harmonic minor. Note that because of G-&gt;G# diatonic chords of A harmonic minor are not the same as diatonic chords of natural minor. Instead of: Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am they are now Am, Bdim (B D F), Caug(since G# is 5th), Dm, E, F, G#dim (G# B D), Am.         \nAnother way of looking at the minor scale is to take major scale and flatten the third of the scale. A major scale is A B C# D E F# G# A.  If you lower the 3rd (C#) and 6th (F#) you get A harmonic minor. If you just lower the 3rd you get another scale - A melodic minor - A B C D E F# G# A.
