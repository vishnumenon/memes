{"body": "I agree, it's a very archaic view of the development of the brain. Everyone is expected to grow and progress at the same rate and those who don't are labeled to have \"behavioral problems\" or \"ADHD\". This might be true for a few people but the fact is that being labeled with a defect at such a young age causes huge insecurities later on in life. I was in a lot of \"special\" (the dumb kind) math and speech classes as a kid and it really sucked to feel inferior and singled out. It was all a joke in the end since I ended up in the top tier of my high school class and into a good university thanks to the good ol' ┌П┐(◉_◉)┌П┐mentality.\n\n I cant help but think of all the undeveloped potential the kids in my old special classes might have to share with the world but won't because of this kind of system putting them down.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1289462470", "subreddit": "DoesAnybodyElse", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
