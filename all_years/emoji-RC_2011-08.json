PMS hooked me up with a server, a team, and some sweet gigs at events making money, and through that I got deeper and deeper into the scene.\n\nAfter Amy (PMS Athena) and Chelsea (PMS Delicate) were on Ultimate Gamer, I decided I wanted to be on season 2, so I bought an Xbox and practiced and made the show (and came in 6th….fucking Pac Man).\n\nAfter the show, I started working on more gaming media and Starcraft 2 was just starting to explode at the time, so I teamed up with my boyfriend TorcH to start producing coverage of the scene. A little after, I was picked up by the company Cyber Sports Network to represent them at events, produce content, and build their social media presence. It’s a fantastic opportunity to work in my favorite parts of the competitive gaming industry and to feel like I’m helping grow the culture I love!\"\n\nSo in other words shes just someone who plays/likes video games and got into gaming media.

{"body": "Ahhh yes, this is so awesome! Just getting the alt text support is a big help; thank you!\n\nOne thing I'd like to request that I don't see on the todo list is support for more than just rage faces - lots of other subreddits have custom emotes like f7u12 does.\n\nIn my perfect, ideal world, we could select a number of subreddits whose emotes would be visible in all subreddits and the inbox pages (for when people use emotes outside of their home subreddits or in message replies). Any other emotes would only work on pages from their home subreddit.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to see custom subreddit flair too, but I think those could be more complicated, and might be difficult to fit into the space-saving, minimalistic style you already use for comment headers. This would be pretty low priority on my list anyway, so maybe it's not worth looking into, unless you get lots of other people wanting to see flair.\n\nAnyway if you need examples of other subreddits with custom emotes, my favorite is [/r/mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony), but some other fellow mentioned [/r/trailerparkboys](/r/trailerparkboys), and there is always [/r/adviceanimals](/r/adviceanimals) (and [/r/shittyadviceanimals](/r/shittyadviceanimals)).\n\nA final, minor note: whatever you did to enable the LoD seems to have done a great job of enabling display of other weird unicode characters, so for example the following look great on my phone:\n\n(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\n\n╭∩╮（︶︿︶）╭∩╮\n\nHowever, and this is a very minor thing, it looks like the little 'whoosh' dealie from this is showing up as a square box on my phone:\n\n┬─┬͡   \\\\\\(°□°\\）\n\n[A link to information about the character in question](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/361/index.htm).\n\nAnyway, thank you again for all the hard work you've done on this.
