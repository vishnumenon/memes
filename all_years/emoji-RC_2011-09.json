Force yourself to use the new hotkeys and just keep at it.  When you get at the proficiency you were at with your old hotkeys, go onto ladder where using them will actually make a difference.  \n\nI suggest comp first just because it gets rid of the psychological barrier we all have to deal with: \"omg I have to win!\"  Against the comp if you lose it's just like whatever, so you can just practice your hotkeys without holding yourself back while you relearn them.\n\nI think people either forget or underestimate just how well practicing simple things against the comp can be.  Not everything needs to be done on ladder, unless it's like testing a build which of course you'd need to do on ladder to be able to test how it reacts to other builds/reactions.
