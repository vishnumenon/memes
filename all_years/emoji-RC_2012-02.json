{"body": "Okay, well, I'd call that an intelligent retort if you actually had a reason or explanation of just Why we can't compare the two.\n\nBuying a material item will create happiness when in use with the potential for creating an experience that will bring you experience in the future.\n\nFor example, winning an awesome team game with an ally and recollecting on that.  Or buying a guitar and practicing for hours to create the awesome experience of playing at a show.\n\nMost of the time you can skip buying something permanent and just buy the experience.  You don't buy a minigolf course to go minigolfing you just pay for the service and have fun playing minigolf.  \n\nPersonally, I agree with a few great philosophers that money is better spent on experiences rather than material goods.  \n\nThe money people spend on starcraft is for the game itself, the material.  We spend our time (time is finite for all of us and we spend it how we choose) playing these games creating experiences.  Some are better than others.  I personally will always remember the first time I played against a masters player.  Almost got smashed, then had an amazing comeback.  I assumed it was another diamond player at the time, didn't know till afterwards and that made it so much sweeter. LOVE, that memory.  Not nearly as much as all my memories of the cannon rushes back from silver league.\n\nSo, lets recap, games of starcraft =experiences. You could provide a dollar value if you'd like just by dividing the money you spent by how much time you've played. But anyways, thinking about the games you've played brings happiness. Watching MLG is also an experience. I think back about all the events last year fondly because there were truly some epic games.\n\nSo, Starcraft 2 with 100+ hours of entertainment for $30 if you have the right disposition and are creating memorable experiences then it is absolutely a better deal than MLG.  \n\nYou can absolutely compare the cost of fun per hour.  Assuming fun is constant between watching or playing.  (I know it can vary, everyone gets bad games when they play or bad games to watch.) So you can adequately compare the fun between the two.  \n\nOH SHIT, I MADE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nSorry, had to get that out.  Anywaysss, I'll comfortably compare anything that brings enjoyment. Starcraft 2 is a fantastic deal if you're getting experiences out of it that you remember fondly.  If you're not capable of that then it's not worth as much. But, I'm not saying everyone should just buy and play sc for all their enjoyment.  People need other forms of entertainment so we can have options. \n\nAnd here's a big part of it, people Like having others entertain them.\n\nSo back to my point from before explained differently, when you're paying others to entertain you (movies, minigolf, dinners, etc.) then the $20 for MLG is still a good deal.  \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1329395743", "subreddit": "starcraft", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

I had a crush on a girl for a long time, but it was one of those things where you didn't want to tell them because the friendship that you already cherish would disappear. I moved schools partly because of her. I wound up seeing her again at a dance, and it was nice to see her again and all, but I had already mentally blocked her out because she dated total losers and all of them treated her very poorly. The blame lies on me, really, for not asking her out.\n\nThe dance was kind of funny for me because they had us line up according to height and, being the tallest person I know, I was at the front of that line. And, as luck would have it, she was the tallest girl there. They paired us up and I got one last dance with her before I moved on for good.\n\nIt was nice for me to get past her because I was so absorbed with her that I thought about her constantly. Forgetting her cleared my head for the first time in what seemed like decades.\n\nFast forward to this year, I bumped into her at the theater. She's getting married.
