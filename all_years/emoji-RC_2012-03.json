{"body": "&gt; as opposed to how Native Americans originally came from Mongolian populations after 1000s of years of isolated development they are now distinct\n\nExcept we aren't, really.  We are still remarkably mongolian. \n\n\n&gt; Central Europeans are the product of many different historical ethnic groups (slavs, scandinavians, germanics, celts, meditarreans etc.). Some of those lines have broken down, some are still clearly genetically distinct. None are easily equatable with Ashkenazi or Sephardic Jews.\n\nDude, that is *exactly my point*.  That's the whole problem with it, right there: The word \"Jew\" is *meaningless* when it comes to describing what ethnicity one actually *is*.  \n\nOnce you consider that the phrase \"I'm a Jew\" means one *can be* Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Germanic, or Meditarranean, or any combination thereof, or none of the above at all?  And that's not even an exhaustive list?  Then it pretty clearly fails as an accurate, scientifically valid descriptor for any *one* particular bloodline or set of genetics.  To get anything meaningful from that word whatsoever, one then has to ask \"well what *kind* of jew\"?  And once you get an answer (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Mizrahi, etc. etc.), you can basically just translate it into english - \"Central European Jew,\" \"Hispanic Jew,\" \"Middle Eastern Jew, \" etc. - and then just remove the word \"jew\" entirely to get an *actual, useful, descriptive* answer as to the ethnicity of the person in question.  \n\n\"Jew\" is a culture and a rich history, and a beautiful religion filled with people I generally really like and a language that is beyond fascinating.  But a single _people_ it certainly is not, unless one is willing to overlook so many things that the terms involved become vague to the point of uselessness.  \n\nBy way of comparison, the Native American people certainly count as one, even counting all of the tribes in all of the Americas, and they aren't really physically distinct enough where it matters to count as anything other than \"Western Chinese people\".  \n\nThis is the source of my ire.  I don't walk around scowling and stamping my feet about it, but I'd be lying through my teeth if I didn't say that it certainly is a pet peeve of mine.  \n\nHaving said that, I do concede that each of the 9-12 different peoples that make up what you call \"Jewish ancestry\" do indeed seem to be clearly geneologically divided according to everything you've posted... but I don't think that was ever my disagreement.  My disagreement is that there *are* that many of 'em all trying to fit under one umbrella, and that's just nonsensical.  :-)\n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332803214", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
