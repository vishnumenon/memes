When you finish put everything away and just sit back enjoy your drink and music/TV, until you feel relaxed and either continue or try to venture out and do something you enjoy, personally I hate being around A LOT of people so I try to stay alone or around really close friends.\n\nEventually you just get to a point where you are comfortable.

{"body": "**My self-summary**\n\nI think the best way to describe me is \"eclectic\". I have a variety of aspects to my personality.\n&gt;Unfortunately, you can't just come out and say you're some quality. You *have* to demonstrate it. Drop this. \"Variety of aspects\" is very vague. Drop it too.\n\nI'm more laid back about things, but...\n&gt;No comma.\n\n...will get serious when the situation calls for it. I enjoy being ridiculous at times, such as blasting classical music while rolling through town, or heading to average places in a suit and tie with some friends.\n\nI enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and generally geeking out at times.\n&gt;What does \"geeking out\" mean? Replace \"and generally geeking out at times\" with \"and I will occasionally [example of a geek-out].\"\n\nWhen it comes to my faith, I'm serious about it...\n&gt;\"I'm serious about my faith...\"\n\n...but I'm not one of those \"bash you over the head with a bible\" type of fellows. I'd much rather show my faith through my works. For example, I'd rather make people dinner than debate about religion. It's all about love and charity, and...\n&gt;No comma.\n\n...that's what I aim for.\n\nNot to sound cliche like so many profiles I've read on here, but I do start off a little shy, but quickly open up once things get going.\n&gt;It's cliche. Everybody says it. It's also true of most folks. This doesn't need saying at all.\n\nTyping this, I'm realizing how difficult it is to describe myself. I'll add some more as I think of it.\n&gt;Yep, it's not the easiest thing to reflect in on yourself. DO IT ANYWAY and don't talk about how hard it was.\n\n**What I’m doing with my life**\n\nHaha. Now isn't that the question.\n&gt;I don't know if it's *the* question but it certainly is *a* question. Drop this preface.\n\nCurrently though...\n&gt;More preface. Drop it and get to the meat already.\n\n...I'm finishing up school and planning to move somewhere to start my film career. Where and how is all up in the air though...\n&gt;Good.\n\n...and that's what I'm really figuring out now.\n&gt;Hence \"all up in the air\". This fragment is redundant.\n\n**I’m really good at**\n\nI'm not much for bragging, but I'm a very creative type.\n&gt;I didn't think it was bragging until you mentioned it. Drop it. And you're also about to explain how you're creative so you don't need to say you're creative. Drop it.\n\nI love making art, sewing stuff, cooking, and most of all filming.\n&gt;...and, most of all, filming.\n\n**The first things people usually notice about me**\n\nI've been told my blue eyes\n&gt;It's assumed someone told you so just say it. \"My blue eyes.\"\n\n**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food**\n\nOh, so much.\n&gt;I bet. Drop this bit since it doesn't add anything.\n\nI haven't had much free time to read lately, so I can't really think of any solid book titles I love.\n&gt;That's fine, so don't mention it at all. Drop the above.\n\nAs far as movies go, there are FAR too many...\n&gt;Of course there are. It's assumed that these lists are never all-inclusive. Drop the disclaimer.\n\n...I'm a film guy, so my top 5 films is like top 50.\nBut the best of the best are: Harold and Maude, V for Vendetta, El Mariachi, Six String Samurai.\n\nTV: I love Doctor Who. Great show. Aside from that, Psych, Robot Chicken, Firefly, MacGyver, Scare Tactics, Iron Chef, Pushing Daisies...\n&gt;Good.\n\n...and a variety of others.\n&gt;Again, assumed your lists are incomplete. Drop the disclaimer.\n\nMusic: I have a very eclectic taste.\n&gt;We'll be the ones to decide if your tastes are \"eclectic\". Drop the disclaimer again.\n\nI love ska, techno, classical, pop, old jazz, etc. Quite the variety.\nFavorite bands though include Freezepop, Daft Punk, Matt Maher, School of Seven Bells, Billy Holiday...\n&gt;Good.\n\n...and quite a few others.\n&gt;Can you imagine what I'm going to say about this disclaimer?\n\nFood: I'll eat anything. I grew up trying weird foods, so I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to cooking and eating.\n\n**The six things I could never do without**\n\nI'll try to be creative here, because too many of these are \"Friends, Family, blahblahblah\"\n&gt;So... get creative. The disclaimer isn't necessary.\n\nChai tea\n\nInternet\n\nMass\n\nSleep\n\nArt Supplies\n\nFinal Cut\n\n**I spend a lot of time thinking about**\n\nMaking stuff and creating things. Like if I'm in the midst of a project, I'll daydream about patterns, designs, and all the little details of it.\n&gt;Passive sentence structure. \"I'll daydream about patterns, designs, and all the little details of a project.\"\n\nAside from that, life and big things.\n&gt;Too vague. Drop it.\n\nAlso, all the cool things I could do if I had that watch from Clockstoppers.\n\n**On a typical Friday night I am**\n\nEither hanging out at a friend's place, or by myself doing something artsy and watching a movie.\n&gt;Consider defining \"hanging out\" as some friends \"hang out\" with booze, some with strippers, some with Boggle...\n\n**The most private thing I’m willing to admit**\n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n&gt;Creative, yet it adds nothing. Leave it blank or fill in something.\n\n**You should message me if**\n\nWe share some interests, you feel you're pretty awesome, or you just want to get to know me.\n&gt;That's the general idea. They'll message you for these reasons without saying so, you know, don't say them.\n\nAlso, here's a handy ice breaker: Try to guess my favorite animal! Or favorite [INSERT INTERESTING THING HERE]\n&gt;Eh... I don't like the wording. \"If... you think you can guess my favorite animal.\" works better. Also expand this section.
