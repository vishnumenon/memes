I mean I can understand Sisko's feelings, and don't even disagree with with a character having a beef with Picard, but the Captain is the lead of the show, and having him so adversarial to possibly the most respected and admired character in the Star Trek universe just really turned liking him into an uphill battle for me. The actor's horrid over-acting pretty much cemented my dislike. It was like he was trying to out-do Patrick Stewart but had only acted before in high school. I can't help but roll my eyes every time he says more than a few words.\n\nMy biggest problem though was with the Bajorans. As much as I disliked Sisko I HATED the Bajorans. I found them extremely self-centered and childish. So certain that they were special and their gods were in control. I'll admit I haven't watched all of DS9 but I felt like it was moving inevitably towards \"faith is a good thing and needs to coexist with science!\" So I gave up watching the show chronologically after season 4 or 5.\n\nAlso, they killed Worf's second love interest. Seriously, wasn't murdering K'Ehleyr enough? And of course they have to kill off one of the three characters on the show that is actually like-able.\n\nThat just my two cents.
