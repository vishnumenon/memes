Also, I had been carrying a heavy burden on my shoulders about a tragic family incident 7 years earlier, that I had never fully gotten over.  I blamed myself for what happened, even though I had no control over it.  I still felt responsible, and that didn't help either.  To sum up the events that lead to the beginning of the end: I had just stopped seeing a girl that was only into me for my money (and that's crazy in itself, because college kids don't really have much money; at least I didn't.  I did know how to stretch a dollar back then though).  My family was getting all up in my business for not coming or calling home enough.  Calculus, Biology, Chemistry; back to back. The Blaster virus had just been released (that one, I didn't mind so much, because that meant I got to work more, and work was always a good distraction.  Mostly because I worked in the dorms, and some awesome stuff always happened when I worked).  And the straw that broke the camel's back? A girl stood me up on a first date.  Actually, this happened two more time by two other girls before I started feeling like there was something wrong with me.\n\nAnd it felt like something was horribly wrong with me.  I didn't understand it.  I couldn't wrap my head around it.  I was the guy that knew a thousand faces.  I couldn't go anywhere on campus without someone recognizing me.  People enjoyed my company.  I was nice.  I was helpful.  I was charitable.  Adventurous.  Smart.  Loyal. and a bunch of other keywords.  It really bummed me out.\n\nSo, having troubles on the home front and on the love boat, I turned to Yahoo Pool one night.  I know, right?  Shh!  Don't ruin it for other people.\n\nI met this woman who tells me her name is \"Lauren\".  She's 3 years older than me, blonde, funny, attractive, went to a college 100 miles from where I did, and told me she thought I was cute.  9 hours later... (you read that right, we played pool for 9 hours; IM'ing each other more than playing pool).  We talked about everything, and I instantly felt a connection. The connection just brewed like a good beer until morning rolled around.  Lauren made me feel as if I didn't have to worry about a thing in the world; and it was comforting.\n\n2 hours of sleep later, I went to class, but couldn't concentrate.  All I could think about was her.  Followed by work, but still, I couldn't stop.  So, I left work early just to talk to IM her.  Mind you, this was back when texting wasn't as popular, so no, I wasn't constantly texting her back and forth. There was the excitement of anticipation always looming.  When I got back, she was online waiting for me.\n\nThis went on for another day, before I decided, I want to meet this girl.  So on day three, while I was sleep deprived, I asked her if she would want to meet in person.  She freaked out.  Things started going south, and I could tell it wasn't going to end well.  In a panic, I informed her that I loved her.  She signed out immediately after.  Then a few minutes later, she signed back in and told me she loved me, too.  I know right?  3 Days?  For that, I totally deserved to be kicked in the head; the head that does all the thinking.  By that I mean penis.\n\nWhen I asked for her phone number (I know, I'm stupid; I should have gotten that on day 1), she told me she wasn't ready, because her last boyfriend died in a car accident.  She requested me to do one thing before we indulged in whatever it was we were attempting; to watch a [really boring] movie about horses, because apparently, she loved horses.  Her dad was a doctor and her parents owned a ranch with horses, but she had a lost her favorite horse growing up.  She told me it would help me understand where she was coming from.  I indulged and we got closer, but she never gave me her phone number, no matter how much I pleaded with her.  I should have smelled the tilapia, but my scumbag brain was telling me I needed to hold on to her.\n\nNo sooner that I met her, had things escalated to the point of a manic breakdown in my psyche.  Things just kept getting worse at the home front, and now my school work was starting to fall apart.  I eventually told her that perhaps, she didn't really want me, and we should just go our separate ways. Then, shit got real.  She told me to meet her online the following night, and she would give me everything I wanted.  Except, she never showed.  Instead, I got an email telling me that her parents decided on a last minute trip up north, and she couldn't get online (you see, my brain should have made a connection there; getting an email from no internet access, but it didn't; I made up the excuse that she sent this before leaving).  I did find it weird that she was an adult, and she still couldn't make her own decisions about family vacations.\n\nSeveral hours later, after the time we were supposed to meet online, she came online and apologized.  I forgave her like an idiot.  We talked for a bit, and she agreed to give me her phone number.  Except! Duhn-duhn-duhn!!!! She lost her phone at the last pit stop.  I told her if she gave me her number, I could call it, and we could verify whether or not she really lost it at the last stop or if she just misplaced it somewhere in the RV she was traveling in.  She made up some excuse and then, started telling me stories about how the last time she was up at the vacation home, she was almost raped.  Being the caring person that I was (and super gullible), I started trying to comfort her; forgetting my own needs.\n\nShe was afraid that \"Jack\", a guy that tried to rape her before, would do it again, since he was the son of a friend of the family, who was also invited to the vacation home that weekend.  And I was all like, WTF? If you knew he was going to be there, why would you put yourself in harms way?  She told me not to worry and that she would IM me the following day, saying I should get a webcam, because she had one.  That following morning she emailed me, apologizing for her absence; requesting me to be online the same night so we could talk.  I got a webcam later that afternoon, and began my wait. I waited.  And waited.  And waited.\n\nThat night, a Nickleback song came on (this was at a time in my life, when I really didn't care for Nickleback either way, because they weren't that good) and it was super sad.  It was the one where the girl is super pissed and the guy is trying to console her, but she gets in a car and drives while upset; then dies in a car accident and her ghost finds her boyfriend's ghost; revealing that the guy had died, and that's what made her hysterical.  Anyway, I listened to that song on repeat for almost an hour, and was in tears, because she didn't show up.  I feared the worst.  A knot in my stomach made it hard to get out of my chair.  I didn't want to leave, just in case she showed up.  When I couldn't take it anymore, I decided Nickleback really did suck, turned off the music player on my computer, and started investigating.  I looked up the car accident she was talking about, but couldn't find anything specific.  I looked up the attempted rape incident, but couldn't find anything.  I looked up stuff about her parents, but I couldn't find anything.  That should have totally clued me in to what was going on, but then, I did something stupid.  I called the police station in the city where she was vacationing at, to try to send some help her way, in case she was in serious trouble; what else could I have done? Apparently, I was smitten by her.  When the police officer told me that people online couldn't be trusted, I should have listened, but I was an emotional wreck.\n\nTL;DR:  Apparently 10,000 characters is too long?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342104044", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
