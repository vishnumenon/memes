{"body": "Most weight loss supplements are bunk. The big name brands and their cheap imitations are blends of a few basic ingredients that follow this general formula:\n\n* A diuretic\n\n* A stimulant\n\n* An appetite suppressant (often stim-based)\n\n* Adjuncts (helper chemicals for the stimulants)\n\nThe diuretic makes you lose water weight, which tricks you into believing that the supplement is having a real effect. The stimulant will give \"energy\" in the case that you're able to lower caloric intake. Appetite supressants help you do that. Manufacturers also add ingredients like raspberry ketones or mangosteen or anything else with a pseudoscience backing. I emphasize that there is no evidence to indicate efficacy for most of these compounds.\n\nThere is also a common belief that stimulants (termed thermogenics) can raise metabolism and increase calorie use, though I don't think this has been experimentally demonstrated. \n\nThe pharmaceutical drug Alli was recently approved to be sold over the counter, it acts by preventing fat absorbtion and as a result gives you oily diarrhea whenever you eat fat. There are also supplements that promise to alter carbohydrate absorbtion (a sort of bean extract comes to mind) but they can have serious side effects like explosive flatulation. It's better to save money and just avoid eating too much.\n\nThe one weight loss drug with a long history of efficacy is hard to come across, but it almost guarantees an effect. Too bad it's Amphetamine. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThe truth of the matter is that a person can't achieve long-term weight loss without lifestyle modification like healthy diet and exercise, but supplements can have a place in that. Caffeine and Branched Chain Amino Acids taken before exercise, along with an 8 oz serving of motivation, can help extend and intensify the workout so you get more out of it. \n\nCaffeine is a readily available and usually well-tolerated appetite suppressant, and it can help you stick to a diet that you're committed to with less discomfort than you would experience otherwise, but caffeine alone can not make a person lose weight. It can just make dieting less shitty.\n\nAs for Yohimbe, it has nasty interactions with some common drugs and its stimulant effects can be extreme to the point of discomfort unless you're a regular stimulant user. If you're experienced with and fond of stimulants Yohimbe can be a good drug to increase sexual performance, or it's good if you just want to be really wired all day. I don't know any women who use it.\n\nI think that covers everything except green coffee extract, but that shit was on Dr. Oz which is reason enough to doubt it. I've read some full-text articles on the stuff and I'll just say I have serious doubts. Drug researchers are bad at statistics.\n\n**TL;DR** Work out and eat less, it is the only way unless you like taking speed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345484099", "subreddit": "DrugNerds", "score": 19, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; That would scare me tbh. I can't speak for all the guys, but if while talking to me you gave me the impression that a conversation about how my weekend went or how the lady you carpool with is doing was on the same level as a conversation about, say, what effect time travel would have had on the outcome of the second world war... I'm likely to become \"incredibly moody\", \"don't say much\" and \"give a flat affect\".\n\nLike I said, I see all conversation is basically irrelevant anyway. The only thing that varies is how entertaining it is or isn't. But of course, it's common sense not to intentionally carry on a conversation that your conversational partner sees as boring.\n\nThat said, I'm not a mind reader. It's kind of hard to think of things to talk about when everyone's all, \"Merp, merp, only giving one-word answers today.\" But when I stop talking to them, they become friendlier. I don't understand this hot and cold behavior. The conversation never gets rolling either way. \n\nThe examples of topics you gave are extremely specific to the point where it seems like a similarly specific imaginary situation is being imposed over this situation. I have never in my life even heard of people starting conversations about things as boring as weekends, carpools, and time travel during WWII. Dude, what? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n&gt; Do you talk about anything with these guys that you share a common interest in? or that you're both passionate about? Or do you think of yourself as not possibly having anything in common with a male?\n\nEvery person alive today has lots of things in common with others by default. There's the whole heartbeat and pulse thing for starters. Most people also have some combination of fingernails and hair. \n\nUnfortunately, the information that I have on these dudes generally doesn't get much more specific than that. We go to the same school. We're around the same age. We are usually in the same room when we speak with one another. All of these things imply some general level of shared interests and/or experiences, and yet, no dice.\n\nI don't know them well enough to know whether or not they're passionate about the topics we discuss, because, as I mentioned in the OP, they actually aren't my friends and I'm still trying to figure them out and get them to open up.
