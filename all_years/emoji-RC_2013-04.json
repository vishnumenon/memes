This girl grew up in my area her entire life, spoke like a valley girl the entire time, got a call from her black friend and put on a thick ghetto accent, hung up the phone and resumed speaking normally.  It wasnt a regional dialect thing and it wasnt her \"roots\" coming out. \"Switching\" is inherently a fake act when done on purpose to appease a certain group of people and it was a disservice to her friend on the phone to assume she was so narrow minded that she couldnt be friends with someone who didnt talk the way she did. If I was the black person on the other end of the phone I would have been offended. Also lets all remember that all this is in regards to breaking up with someone for an IRRATIONAL reason and I was being IRRATIONAL. \n\nEdit 2: TIL im racist. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365168423", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 33, "controversiality": 0}

I think there could have been better, indirect solutions to the problem of griefing; like making it difficult and unrealistic to do (at-least solo) in the first place and/or making reinforcements or buildings more secure and resistant. I guess that can be saved for the standalone game, which again may or may not be in the works.\n\nI used to defend griefers and shun people who merely wanted to play peacefully and creatively, but I now think that was pretty stupid of me. Griefers add something to the game, but that's not enough to justify them. It's not positive value, and contrary to some's belief, it's not hard to tell the difference between griefers and mere roleplayers. We've had the latter on this server, and those seemed like good times compared to some thirteen year old nerd ruining people's game because his mom didn't let him buy a goddamn sticker from the grocery store quarter machine.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1365583562", "subreddit": "Civcraft", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Infinity is not a Real Number (capital R), so if we are working in Real numbers then \n\n2/∞ \n\nmakes about as much sense as \n\n2/( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).\n\nWe can define a new set of numbers called [\"The Extended Real Numbers\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line) which includes ∞ and -∞. The construction of the extended real numbers usually includes rules which say that for any a≠±∞, a/±∞=0 and ±∞/a=±∞. In this system, there is no difference between the number 2/∞ and the number 2^(100)/∞. They are both 0.\n\nBut the extended reals are kind of problematic in a lot of ways. For example, they do not [form a field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics\\)) the way that the regular old real numbers do. A lot of the time they are just used as kind of a matter of convenience since it makes certain expressions more compact. For instance, it is shorter to write `[;\\frac{a}{\\infty};]` than it is to write `[;\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{a}{n} ;]`, even though the second thing is what we might actually mean by the first thing. Using extended real numbers also lets you write things like \"let `[;0&lt;x&lt;\\infty;]`\" to mean \"let x be any positive real number\". So it works as a shorthand a lot of the time.\n\nThe important point here is that there is no Real number called \"∞\" so as always in mathematics the answer relies heavily on what kinds of objects we're dealing with.

{"body": "Never said it was your paper.  So I put on my rusty robes and gave it go:\n\nOP these are notes I jotted down as I read.\n\n\n\n~~assumes audience is aware of reddit and other social media jargon (example AMA acronym isn't explained) and other social media sites (e.g., 9gag).~~\n\n\nP. 14 move **identity** header to next page\n\n\nOp, the citation style you use is different then I'm used to.   For example, you used on p.7  [\"Barabasi said 'quote'\" (12) ]. In my field it would be Barabasi (2011) said, \"quote...\" You may be using a different style.  \n\n \n~~P. 25 \"Troll\" is not an academic word.~~ I saw your Glossary of terms when I finished.\n\n\n**Here's the lynchpin of the thesis**\n\n\n&gt;  If we were to objectively view the discursive community being framed by Reddit‘s default subreddits we would be left with\none that is dominated by a mentality that is white, wealthy, first world, and voraciously male. Whilenot inherently a bad thing, considering the influence of Reddit the exclusionary community ideal\nintrinsic to such a frame is far from universal.\n\n\nIn regards to Reddit being ruled, dominated in a political or social context (Hegemonic) with 16 subreddits :  aww, wtf, music, askreddit, movies, worldnews, bestof, politics, adviceanimals, gaming, videos, funny, science, atheism, technology, IAMA, TodayIlearned\n\n\nMany of these subs are counter culture, entertainment, informative and only two would I describe as debate oriented to sway users to \"act politically mindset\" in real life.  The latter being the most likely to influence social constructs for your premise.  If you have to defend your thesis be prepared here.\n\n\nFollowing is the Definition of \"community\" by the author.  For graduate level this is where there would be heavy scrutiny.  For example is President Obama a member of the Community?  Does he self-identify as a Redditor.  He has posted on the default sub and is high ranking Top Score.  He has an exceptional karma score, etc. In addition, why is reddit an exclusionary community and not just a public forum?  Anyone can join and do people really stay long?  What percentage of people really meet the definitions proposed by the author?  Etc. \n\n\nThen a rabbit hole...\n\n\nWay too much dependence on two sources with one being a very small radically group -- \"neo-Nazis\".  Op uses this to support this statement\n\n\n&gt; [Her study of neo-Nazi online groups, like Wang‘s discussion of Taiwanese Americans, shows that there is a significant correlation between online activity and offline action. Since ―studies indeed find that people in diverse environments accurately perceive general opinion climate‖ \\(532\\), phenomena such as the digital divide and the framing of the collective ethos on Reddit lead to more ideologically homogenous groupings and less social leveling or idea sharing. The unsavory aspects of online life are compounded and strengthened in such an environment.](http://afaarchive.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/right-wing-radical-online-groups-social-networks-and-news-media-2011.pdf) (caution PDF primary is linked).\n\n\nThis is huge leap OP for, comparatively, a very diverse community.  A community that you had to chip away to define as not by \"default subs\" and now support with a paper on \"neo nazis\".  Likely, especially in certain subs, this does occur.  But, how much and how often for the greater good.  To your credit you write:\n\n\n&gt; The idea that online activity can lead to offline action is both positive and negative.\n\n\nBut that's the end.  From now on you have created what we call an “opinion platform” for your paper.    I will explain later.\n\n\n\n\n**Digital Divide**\n\n\nReally liked you brought that up.  It's a great point and something we should all be aware of.  Note, it does bring to mind the Lynchpin and if I was reviewing your thesis I would be wondering why we don’t have data on Reddit’s demographic user base (then sadpandaface.jpg).  \n\n\nOkay, now the liberal arts gets bashed on Reddit with figures that are just .jpg of users posts with no context (i.e., cherry picked data).  Are you trying to make friends with your professors here?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, Reddit doesn‘t hold itself to the same standards that the scientific community does and oftentimes, when something is presented to it in a Reddit-friendly format, it is willing toforgo fact checking if the sentiment expressed complements the community ideology.\n\n\n\nAnd here is where you started losing me.  All your figures are just .jpg of people posts/comments and memes.  There is no quantitative data to support your position which is social sciences is our method of “fact checking”.  There are methods of word counts to do by subs that I have seen on /r/dataisbeautiful posted.  Could have come in very handy for this paper.\n\n\nThis is what I mean by an “opinion platform.”  I don’t want you to change your paper.  As I wrote somewhere else to the effect “get your degree then learn.” \nThe strengths of this paper is you do know Reddit well.  It is well written.  You support your general premise and you do know Reddit’s culture well. \nHowever, your general premise is weak and then you use this same weakness of not including nondefault subreddits to include a nondefault to support your opinion (e.g., r/mensrights and misogyny).  Your thesis is now not credible from selective bias.   If you get a professor who knows Reddit or is at all paying attention expect that to come out.  Consequently your *opinions* and most importantly your *conclusion* are [not credible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).  \n\n\nThe only figures should be from default subs.  They do add to the paper to give the reader context, but you are overly dependent on them.  All data should be from default subs.  Your initial premise is from that stance and you **have** to stick to it.  On a personal level you are not balanced on this topic.  For example, it is not unusual for people to remark racist/sexist remarks about whites/men as well.  Just recently there was many posters who “sighed* with relief that Boston Marathon Bombers were white.  According to this paper this would create an exclusionary community increasing racism and sexism towards white men, correct?  And honestly I would not be surprised if this is true: /r/srs\n\n\nTL;DR Well done and Best of Luck!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366603815", "subreddit": "TheoryOfReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Judging by the Plegia thread, we post our progress here... so here we go, I guess!\n\n**Team Name**: [Freddy no Team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_skhTIY_Ik)\n\n**Avatar(F)**: Morgan, 1/4/2/5/1 for looks, +Res/-Luck for stats. (And yes, I did make my avatar a grown version of my first run's Morgan... screw continuity!) \n\n**Progress**: **Completed, 398 turns**\n\n**Chapter Name**: Turns (Penalty) / Total Turns (Total Penalty) //Comments\n\n**Premonition**: 2 (1) / 2 (1) // I would've gotten it in four turns because I paired them up, but then I figured out that that was stupid and saved myself a turn. Oh well.\n\n**Prologue**: 6 (0) / 8 (1) // Chrom got a 6 stat level. Not a bad start! Morgan, on the other hand...\n\n**Chapter 1**: 5 (0) / 13 (1) // More good levels! And more mediocre ones. Also, Chrom heroically nope'd a hit that would've killed Morgan and then support attacked for the kill, so he officially proved himself as good. Pity they can't marry.\n\n**Chapter 2**: 7 (12) / 20 (13) // In which I experience yet again how bad being careless is, and yet again don't bother learning from it.\n\n**Chapter 3**: 11 (2) / 31 (15) // I love how the enemies ignore Kellam until you recruit him. Which I didn't. Sorry, Kellam, but war is hell. Also, Vaike and Sumia need to be less killable.\n\n**Chapter 4**: 9 (2) / 40 (12) // It's more depressing when Freddy dies than anyone else... or rather, more shocking that he can die this early. Not a fun discovery either way.\n\n**Paralogue 1**: 20 (-5) / 60 (10) // Well, at least Sumia got some grinding and went from level 2 to 7. Good enough for me. I didn't grab Donnel, of course, but I did grab his gear, as well as the Killer Lance and Rescue staff, so I consider that a victory.\n\n**Chapter 5**: 13 (4) / 73 (16) // This chapter was seriously not fun. It took me a while to figure out, but winning did feel really rewarding... Absolutely worth the Defense Tonics.\n\n**Paralogue 2**: 9 (2 - 5) / 82 (13) // I wasn't able to save the village, but it was worth seeing Sumia crit Victor for a one-shot kill.\n\n**Chapter 6**: 8 (0) / 90 (13) // Validar thought he was being clever, but Sumia had some constructive *crit*icism for his method of attack. Also, Lucina \"died\", but she's not required to \"live\" so (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧\n\n**Chapter 7**: 5 (1) / 95 (14) // \"But Cordelia, I thought you said there were reinforcements!\" Haha no.\n\n**Chapter 8**: 11 (3) / 106 (17) // For the record, the first reset was because I wanted Panne to get some experience as a Thief off of the boss, which led to two more because of that freaking Killing Edge. Stupid lousy existent enemy crit rates.\n\n**Chapter 9**: 14 (0) / 130 (17) // Dat Em scene. Also, I love how Sumia does 5 damage to the boss and Chrom can't damage him.\n\n**Paralogue 3**: 10 (4) / 140 (21) // I hated this chapter so much, haha. Four tries later, I decided it wasn't worth it.\n\n**Chapter 10**: 7 (0) / 147 (21) // I spared exactly one Soldier, as per Mustafa's request. Sumia needed the exp from the rest.\n\n**Paralogue 4**: 7 (-5) / 154 (16) // I botched up this one and didn't get all the chests, but whatever. Panne got to be useful at least.\n\n**Chapter 11**: 9 (3) / 163 (19) // Sumia was quite fed by this point and the results were frightful. Wind magic barely did anything. Also, for the first time, I had a reason to use Rally Move, and it worked.\n\n**Chapter 12**: 10 (1) / 173 (20) // Here's where I went into full panic mode, as Sumia was level 5 or so and I wanted to pass down Galeforce to Lucina. As a result, she went up to 10 or so.\n\n**Chapter 13**: 16 (4) / 189 (24) // The moment of truth! After having her solo most of the map and using Chrom to block 5 or so Longbow hits, Sumia hit level 15 off of the boss! Of course, Henry died a few times, but he and Morgan were able to spend some quality time with Tharja's Nosferatu. \n\n**Chapter 14**: 8 (2) / 197 (26) // Now that I stopped force-feeding Sumia every single kill, it was time to have her and Lucina choke a passage together. Henry hit 20, Lucina hit 17, and Chrom and Lucina brought the boss down after an epic Aether/crit showdown. I would've saved a few turns if I'd given Henry a Chest Key for the bottom chest instead of a Door Key, but I decided it wasn't worth resetting for, given my luck for the rest of the chapter.\n\n**Chapter 15**: 11 (0) / 208 (26) // With Say'ri, my team is complete minus the children! Thankfully, she's on par with the rest- I'm honestly surprised by this.\n\n**Chapter 16**: 5 (5) / 213 (31) // I hate this game.\n\n**Chapter 17**: 9 (3) / 222 (34) // This chapter annoyed me a bit, but once I started abusing Rally Move and using Henry to face-tank the left side reinforcements, things went much smoother.\n\n**Chapter 18**: 8 (4) / 230 (38) // Probably too late to start grinding Freddy, in retrospect. Oh well, whatever works...\n\n**Chapter 19**: 15 (4) / 245 (42) // This could've gone a lot better from the start if I had realized that my setup sucked and reordered it, but hey.\n\n**Paralogue 17**: 7 (15 -5) / 252 (52) // This level... I may have screamed a little bit the first time one of my units died on the turn the boss finally starts moving. Just a little. Turns out Rescue is op for moving Tiki to the wall so you only have to defend her with 5 units as opposed to 7.\n\n**Paralogue 9**: 7 (1) / 259 (53) // I mainly played this for the EXP/gold, but getting Cynthia was a decent bonus, I guess. Too bad I can't use her because she's so weak. \n\n**Chapter 20**: 8 (0) / 267 (53) // This is about where I ran out of fucks to give and just slaughtered everything. Say'ri turned out quite well, I must say.\n\n**Chapter 21**: 13 (12) / 280 (65) // REINFORCEMENTS\n\n**Chapter 22**: 8 (0) / 288 (65) **FREE THINGS**\n\n**Chapter 23**: 9 (0) / 297 (65) In which Validar manages to do all of 0 damage to my units and an enemy assassin would've penalized my turncount by hitting Basilio and Flavia suddenly decided to turn around and march on the main group instead.\n\n**Chapter 24**: 9 (0) / 306 (65) Return of the REINFORCEMENTS. It is at this point that I realize that, despite his 17 points of defense and 11 or so of Resistance, my Freddy is immortal, partly thanks to his support-blocking machine of a wife, Maribelle.\n\n**Chapter 25**: 9 (1) / 315 (66) Okay, Freddy forgot the \"give no fucks\" rule and gave but a single fuck. He then made up for it by not doing it again.\n\n**Grima**: 4 (13) / 319 (79) // Ho boy. I eventually had to leave a few members of my team (Maribelle, Say'ri) out of this fight, as they were just unable to not die with my comp at the time. Eventually, I had Henry/Morgan on cleanup duty at Grima, Vaike/Panne warding off reinforcements, and Lucina/Sumia and Chrom/Freddy moving in for the kill. As it was time for Chrom to finish Grima, since everyone else had moved already, I realized that he had only one hit, and it wouldn't be enough- until said hit managed to be an Aether proc. Dear lord, I love this game sometimes.\n\nThat's that! Wow, that was a lot harder than I expected at times, but also a lot easier at times. Anyway, loads of fun, would draft again. Maybe next time, I'll even have a score of less than 350!\n\nUnit stats and fun facts: http://pastebin.com/8SMRFEUL\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention in the fun facts, but both Lucina and Cynthia inherited Aether/Galeforce.\n\nEdits throughout today: grammar", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1366898097", "subreddit": "fireemblem", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Once, he thought I'd left the bar we were in because I made friends with 2 girls in the bathroom and I was talking to them for about an hour in the ladies room...\n\nThe other thing is - we communicate with one another. He (and my girl-friends) noticed that a friend of his was really flirty with me. I don't think there's anything malicious behind it, he's just a flirty guy, but since my bf pointed it out to me, I'm very aware of how I act around this guy, I'm not cold or anything, I just make sure I don't get caught up and start flirting back...\n\nSo I dunno, maybe your female friends boys are super jealous and protective? \n\nI personally couldn't deal with that from a guy tbh. I don't expect my bf to be best friends with my male friends, but there's no need to be cold around them.

{"body": "&gt; Every character has its own lore that is created, and you can actually link more than one characters lore to other champions.\n\nI never said dota *didn't* have lore, im telling you that league has it as well.\n-edit: I don't really have a good case for league lore. it is pretty bad and i dont ever read it. I dont have any examples of good lore is the thing. (for any game really. it seems like nobody writes lore these days.)\n\n&gt; Saying league has \"no depth\" was clearly hyperbolic. Obviously it does have depth, but it is in no way, shape or form as deep mechanically or strategically as dota. Also, you don't know that League has millions constantly playing, the only player data that Riot releases is an annual infographic which can be exaggerated (or flat-out fabricated) for effects on the market. Dota, along with every other game on steam, has public statistics based on how many steam accounts are in the game at any current point of time, located here.\n\nI never said that league has millions constantly playing, im saying millions of people play the game. Im sure there are millions that play dota. If league has isn't \" deep mechanically or strategically\" then why do hundred of thousands of players struggle to get higher in the ladder system? There are simply better players in different places.\n\n&gt; This is exactly my point. Every character has a voice actor, but it's essentially nonexistant because they have very few lines, and they're spoken very rarely.\n\nI don't really care about the voice acting as i usually listen to music when i play any multiplayer game.\n\n&gt; You're actually just wrong. Open up the League client, and go to the store tab. Buying runes is located beneath ward skins and above boosts.\n\n[if you insist](http://i.imgur.com/PofCtI3.png) Edit 2: Runes encourage a different play style of champions. if you want to go really really tanky then you can put on a rune page with Armor/Magic resist/Hp. If you want to play the same champion only this time you want damage then you can run Attack damage/or Ability power runes. it can be the winning factor if you have 2 people facing each other with the same champion.\n\n&gt; Of course anyone can play well as any character, you just need to learn them and practice. The point is, if I just randomly want to play Draven, I have to go buy him. If I want to play any champion, and they aren't in the free rotation for the week, I have to go buy it. If I want to play any hero in dota, I'll play a game and pick him. The point is that I have full access to the entirety of the game, and I'm not missing out on game-changing content simply because I haven't grinded enough games to get all the champions or spent enough money to get all the champions.\n\nThis is the game model. You come back each week and you play the free champions. Not every champion requires thousands of points to buy. It doesn't take a lot to get the points to buy basically any champion. 10-30 games can get you any single champion. considering you need to win on average 100 games, assuming you have a .5 win/loss ratio you can get more than enough champions to last you.\n\n&gt; I never said that League is pay to win. But you have to pay or grind out a bunch of games if you want to have access to all the content, and that's what irks me the most.\n\nIts a buisness model that encourages you to play their game. Nobody forces you to buy RP. Nobody forces you to play. You play the game because you enjoy it, and if you don't enjoy it you find a new game.\n\n&gt; No shit dude, that's how they monetize their game. You don't buy heroes, you have the option to buy cosmetic items.\n\nThe irony is so damn high right now. How is DOTA having you buy skins any different than league??? League also has the option of buying champions. \"This is how they monetize their game.\"\n\n&gt; Ad hominem. \n\nFrankly this is ironic too. I don't see how me pointing out that you put no time into the game is irrelevant. You are criticizing a game that is based off the time you put into it. More time= better experience while playing.\n\n&gt; Prove me wrong. Prove me that Riot as a company is not shitty, and prove to me that Pendragon is not a giant piece of shit.\n\nI personally can't convince you that a company isn't shitty. I don't have any sources to back up any potential claims either. \n\nI didn't want this to turn into a case of who can prove the other person wrong. I will read any response but frankly i hardly play league myself as it is. The community is toxic as shit, the game has no replay value to me, and i have moved on. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1367300730", "subreddit": "gamingsuggestions", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
