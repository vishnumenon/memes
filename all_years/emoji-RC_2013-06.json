Me watching Angel Beats kinda proves that I enjoy anime of that sort, the two are fairly similar. \n\nI, personally, don't like shojo anime much but it isn't bad if its done really well. So say what you want brother, you know I'm joking. I was thinking about watching it even. \n\nEDIT: I'm making the jokes because it's an easy way to get out of a conversation about it because he almost literally talks about it 24/7. \n\nAlso: he's spoiled most of the show already, he knows that I'm interested too.\n\nEDIT 2: He likes shounen anime as well. He says that FMA is his favorite anime so far. We all have opinions though, I just personally like shounen anime, and I guess that's a no-no here... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1370308370", "subreddit": "Clannad", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;It is not snobby to be open and honest about quality of a product.\n\nIt is when you think your opinion is a fact, as you clearly do.\n\n&gt; Taste is not entirely subjective either\n\nIf something is any part subjective... then it is entirely subjective.\n\n&gt;most people actually have similar tastes when it comes to food\n\nWhile true, this point isn't really relevant. Just because most people in the world like something, doesn't mean it's the end-all-be-all opinion.\n\n&gt;This is why most people only dislike a handful of things when it comes to food, and are often cool with most things.\n\nI don't think that's true at all. Most people dislike a lot of shit. But again, not really relevant to the point.\n\n&gt;This isn't about my dislike\n\nExcept that it is.\n\n&gt;this is about the fact that the hot sauce has no real flavor and is just useless heat\n\nHeat isn't useless. No real hot sauce enthusiast feels this way, and it's fucking moronic that you think otherwise.\n\nThere is heat, and there is flavor. Both are valued in their own regards. Clearly you don't give a fuck about heat, which is your own prerogative, but it really makes me question your claim of being a hot sauce enthusiast. It sounds to me like you're more of a sauce enthusiast, minus the hot.\n\n&gt; That is not what hot sauce is about and any real hot sauce enthusiast knows this.\n\nBull-fucking-shit.\n\nHot sauce is about flavor *and* heat. Period. End of story. Any real enthusiast knows that both are important in their own regard, and anyone who says otherwise is a bullshitter.\n\nYou're at best a sauce enthusiast. All you care about is flavor. A real hot sauce enthusiast cares about the flavor, and the heat. Just as their are different types of flavor, there are also different types of heat too. Do you know that? No, probably not. Because in your mind the heat in hot sauce is unimportant... which is pretty fucking stupid.\n\nWhat really makes me laugh about this whole thing is that Tabasco *does* have a flavor. A very distinct flavor actually. And *it's not even very hot at all*. Theres even like a dozen or so varieties of Tabasco brand sauce, just as there are a dozen or so varieties of Franks brand sauces. I doubt you've ever had more than just the main flavor.\n\n&gt;¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Mad?\n\nThere's two things I hate. One is people expressing their opinions as fact, as you are right now. The other is people spewing horseshit relevant to a subject I'm extremely passionate about. I fucking love hot sauces. I have some of the mildest on the scoville scale, and some from the top 10 in the world on the scoville scale (made with Ghost peppers obviously). Some that are vinegar based, some that are pineapple based, some that are tomato based, some that are jalopeno based... Some that are traditional, some that are more of a BBQ and some that are more of a Buffallo. There is no limit to what makes a hot sauce truly amazing.\n\nTo say that hot sauce is not about heat, is fucking ignorant. Of course it is not *completely* about heat, flavor is always important. But it is also a very huge defining factor into what makes a hot sauce... hot. Otherwise you just have sauce. Any real *food* enthusiast understands that not everyone has the same taste buds, and that all of this is very subjective. Just as my friend hates sweet sauces and I love them, some people might value a little more heat than others. It's completely subjective. \n\n\nTL;DR: You don't have the right to call yourself a hot sauce enthusiast at all.

{"body": "I had been dating this guy I worked with for about a month, and we were really hitting it off. We were taking things slow, and decided not to have sex right away or even do anything beyond making out until we really got to know each other. There was a ton of sexual tension there and I was raring to go.\n\nSo, it was his birthday, and we went out with a few of my friends. He got pretty wasted. I drove him home, and he suggested I come inside for a little while. He had been working me up, talking about how amazing he was going to make it that night, and I was seriously creaming my pants just waiting for it all to go down. \n\nWe go to his room, where I had never been. He's obviously still wasted and mumbles something about not having much time to clean lately as he's opening the door. He turned on his light and I literally gasped. His room was fucking FILTHY. He had no bed, just a mattress on the floor. Dirty laundry everywhere. Empty beer cans and DVD's and dishes on the floor and it smelled like rotting food.\n\nI have no logical reason for why that was not a deal breaker. It should have been, but *oh, I really really like him, and well it's his birthday, and hey my room gets messy sometimes too, and he isn't acting like it's a big deal so maybe I'm just being squeamish*...and thus went the mental gymnastics I performed in my head to justify the fact that this man had an entire month to prepare for this night, and these were the best accommodations he had to offer. So I politely asked him if I could get some clean sheets, and if he could maybe get rid of the rotten food and spray some air freshener or something (it fucking pains me just writing that sentence. ^So^much^why? )\n\nSo after I had snagged a few clean sheets to cover up the mattress, and febrezed, and the rotten food was removed and taken a few more shots, and the lights were turned down enough that I could almost ignore my surroundings and pretend this situation was something approaching normal, we started getting down to business. So we're making out. And making out. And making out some more, and that's all we are doing. And then I notice *he is fucking crying.*\n\nHe jumps up, naked, and flips on the lights. And points to his flaccid penis and gestures ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ like he's the announcer at the circus says **\"and here, ladies and gentleman, is the star of the show!\"**\n\nI beg him to please calm down, but he completely ignores me like I'm not even in the room. It is just him and his penis, and now they are having an argument. He is mad at his penis. He scolds his penis for ALWAYS FUCKING EVERYTHING UP! YOU ALWAYS DO THIS TO ME! EVERY TIME! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS??\n\nI'm just sitting there, frozen, on the verge of tears. Scared out of my fucking mind because this is literally the craziest shit I have ever witnessed in my life, and I have no idea where he's going with this. I try talking to him- *it's fine, you are just drunk, it happens, I don't care, really.* Again, it's like I'm not even in the room. Then finally, he turns his back, and lets out this horrible half groan half whimper. I see my out, grab my shit and high tail it out of there (my escape was complicated due to the lack of a clear path across the floor). As I'm hopping my way out, he's banging his fucking head against the wall slowly and methodically and slapping his penis. Or maybe giving it a spanking. In any case it's apparently being punished.\n\nThe kicker- I'm literally walking through the door and he screams at me \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE BITCH!\" Like yeah, dude...way ahead of you. \n\n**TL;DR After month long build up of sexual tension, find out dude I'm dating lives like a barn animal and gets into fights with his flaccid penis.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1371975961", "subreddit": "sex", "score": 108, "controversiality": 0}

This included the salons and the clothing stores, so I had kind of assumed it was going to be like a magazine shoot for spring season or something.\n\nTotally wrong. It was a runway event. We were assigned a various store and then they found us an outfit to wear, then we went over to the salon to get out hair all fancy and prepped up. There were mostly girls there but they had a few guys for variety. \n\nAnyways, we had to hang out for like 4 or 5 hours before the event (!) which was kind of awkward. There were tons of people models and we had to line up to practice going down the runway. I was in the first group so I was super nervous since this was not like me at all, not what I had expected, and I was doing one of the first runs without getting to see anyone else try it out. \n\nAnyways, the time came and the sponsors were all seating with their fancy wine and cheeses and stuff and my group was the first ones up to run.

{"body": "&gt;So this is my second night gaming (ever). Last Friday I got a number from a hot hostess at a restaurant in a kind of \"uh, sure, why not\" kind of way. \n\nCool. Good first steps, I think. I think you'll find that, as you progress, it will be easier to establish such a good connection with a girl that by the time you get a number, she'll be invested in interacting with you further and you'll get better responses.\n\n_________Verbal approaches in a non-verbal venue____________\n\n&gt; Cold approaches are so much harder than you'd think after reading all the stuff on sedit. Most of the time **I just walked through the dance floor** (which was pretty much the whole place) back and forth to not stand there looking like a complete idiot.\n\nLook, I'm just going to point out that you have a HUGE opportunity for growth here. You were in a DANCE club, right? And you were TALKING, right? Dance clubs are not designed for talking. They're designed for dancing. If you are *walking* around and insisting on *talking* to girls, you're ignoring one of the easiest ways to meet and interact with girls in such places: dancing on the dance floor. \n\nYou don't even need to talk to girls to open them! Just get on the dance floor and start goofing off. (But focus on your own fun and the music.) Then you can start looking over people in the crowd who are dancing. Copy funny things that you see people doing. Make eye contact with anyone. If it's a girl, hold the eye contact until you get a reaction, either good, bad, or meh. If it's good, either move in and dance with her or beckon her to you in some way if you think she's the type to be aggressive.\n\n__________Experience will help you reach a point where you can tell the insecure monkey in your head to shut up___________\n\n&gt; ......she told me ......that I looked hot (temperature wise) because I had my leather jacket on. I kind of panicked, lol. \n\nExperience may help with this. The more you can get OUT of your head, the easier this will get. Right now, you reacted with fear and shock to something you could have reacted to differently if you were focused on the moment, rather than insecurities.\n\nBy the way, all you have to do to get out of your head is to focus on everything about this very moment. You could start by doing a personal inventory of the sensations in your body, everything you see, hear, smell, taste, touch, etc. \n\n_______________\n\n&gt; ....I asked her the only other thing I could think of \"how do you like it?\". She looked at me with a *is that all you got* kind of look and said \"I like it.\" I literally went like this: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ And walked away.\n\nAs you get more relaxed, you'll be more and more out of your head and hopefully more present in the moment..... and you'll hold up your end of the conversation better. Note: I think WHAT you said was not really the problem. I think it was HOW you said it. (Lack of confidence, etc..)\n\n___________Kudos for keeping at it. Just get out of your head and you'll see more improvement_____________\n\n&gt;Then I went up to the dance floor. Asked a girl who was holding a drink if she was having a good time. She said yes. I asked her what she was drinking. She said \"uhh... whiskey? lol\". I turned around and walked away. Awk.\n\nFirst off, it's awesome that you kept approaching.... it couldn't have been easy. \n\nSecondly, I'm going to point out that asking a girl if she's having a good time is wasting a perfectly good opportunity. You could have taken a second and observed the situation better, and you'd have had a better comment that would have gotten inside of her head. Asking her if she's having a good time, is actually just going to have the effect of INTERRUPTING ANY GOOD TIME she may be having. And asking her what she is drinking is going to go nowhere, too. \n\nThere are far better situational openers you could be using and they'll come to you, as you improve in the area of getting out of your head and staying present in the moment.\n\n____________Don't give away validation &amp; approval in an attempt to get validation from others: it's a losing game________________\n\n&gt; I make myself go through the club and tell every girl I see in the next 35 seconds \"Hey, you're cute\". The reactions were good. They liked being told they were cute. Shocking. That still felt kind of good.\n\nJust going to point out that this is actually not a great habit to get into. The reactions may seem good but they're not paving your way to getting anywhere with them. You just told every girl you saw within that 35 seconds, that they didn't even have to try to get your approval: you were just giving it away. When the fact of the matter is, you had NO real idea whether any of those girls was actually cool or worth your time. \n\nEven if they were cute, so the fuck what?  If their beauty doesn't go more than skin deep, they're still not going to be good company.\n\n________An excellent reference experience, though harrowing___________\n\n&gt; some French girl, maybe an HB5.5, and she was pretty tipsy\n\n&gt; She asked me if I was judging her for being drunk and I said no (should have said yes) and I asked her if she was judging me for being sober (she said yes).\n\n&gt; I told her: \"You're a cool girl\n\n&gt; She didn't seem super thrilled about it but I gave her my phone and told her to put her number in it.\n\n&gt; I put my name in her phone was: \"cute guy xaane\".\n\n&gt;She says: \"You're not cute.\"\n\n&gt;I kind of freak out inside and it ended up being just a ping pong of \"I am\" and \"You're not\". Eventually she says, smiling all the while like it's not the end of the world, \"you're not so ugly but you are also not cute\".\n\nFirst off, this was a drunk HB5.5, who, based on total package (attitude, etc.) was probably a girl we could knock a point or two down to a 4.5 or 3.5, if we are really honest here. You must realize by now that her opinion matters exactly jack and shit. Because she's not in your target market, right? **Let's run down the list of valuable lessons you've had here:**\n\n* A girl that low on the totem pole, clearly will resort to rather vicious negging, etc., to attempt to lower the self-esteem of a guy, both to make herself feel better, and to make them more amenable to her, when they normally might not be.\n\n* It's a bit of a waste of time gaming girls that you're not really interested anyway. And they shouldn't be interesting just because they'll hold a conversation with you. Content matters. Her opinion should matter about as much as an elderly woman's opinion should. \n\n* Don't give a girl a free pass like that. Quit putting every girl on a pedestal. None of the interactions you described in your FR represented anyone you should have been excited about. But even if you had interacted with girls that you discovered were cool, they shouldn't be given a free pass as if they're special. The most any girl should get is treatment of an equal to equal.\n\n* Work on your confidence, or nothing you do will fly. There were a number of things you did which would have actually flew, IF you had owned them and done them with confidence. So in addition to getting yourself out there socially, you OWE it to yourself to take care of yourself. Find ways to improve yourself. Find things you can do that you'll feel good about doing. Perhaps get some hobby that you can take pride in. (Martial arts, rock-climbing, partner dancing, are a few that come to mind.)\n\n__________Your obsession to seek out validation is not an uncommon problem___________\n\n&gt; I have a thing, almost obsessive, about wanting people to think I'm *physically* and objectively attractive. I lost a ton of weight, got a really good style going, but whenever I see a better looking guy I get extremely insecure and yadda yadda yadda. It's something I'm seeing someone about. It's kind of bad, but it's been pretty under wraps since I joined sedit. Anyways...\n\nThis is actually nothing special. A LOT of people go through this. I went through something like this, myself. \n\nThe problem is that you are trying to get something from other people, that you NEED to be getting for yourself. This validation you seek is never going to be given to you. Not until you give it to yourself, oddly enough. But trying to actively get it from other people, will only lead to them kicking you when you're down. (And from their point of view, they'll be reacting in a self-defensive way because what you're doing actually constitutes an attempt to steal something from them that they need for themselves.)\n\nAs you work on your confidence and inner game, this need to seek validation from external sources can and will go down.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372166868", "subreddit": "seduction", "score": 18, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Sentience is a hard topic to discuss, and I haven't really given it much thought, but I'll bite.\n\n\nFirst of all, we need to define sentience. From the wiki page on it (great source I know):\n\n&gt;Sentience is the ability to feel, perceive, or be conscious, or to experience subjectivity. \n\nSo. Tulpas. Can we say that they are sentient? Or, a better question, can we prove it? Not really. We can't really get in their imaginary heads and look for a \"sentient\" sign somewhere in there. But what we can sort of prove, they do act like they are sentient. They can exhibit the same emotions and feelings we do. Are those feelings and emotions really signs of sentience and not an illusion our brain keeps feeding itself?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n\nI treat my tulpas as sentient, but I cannot prove them so. And frankly, I don't really care that much. As long as I need them and they need me, we're game. \n\nTulpa rights are an... interesting subject to touch upon, but honestly, I doubt that tulpas need rights. But that discussion is probably better suited for when the treatise comes out. We'll see how it will go.\n\n\nAnd tulpa equality? For me that means not only equal treatment, but equal responsibilities. Which is a bit hard to do when we're talking about tulpas. So I'm still a bit undecided about that. \n\nOverall, tulpa sentience, and sentience overall is still a very big grey area. Same with tulpa rights. And tulpa equality.
