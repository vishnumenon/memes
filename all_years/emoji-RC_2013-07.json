{"body": "I've told this story on r/sex before, but it seems appropriate for this thread.\n\nI had been dating this guy I worked with for about a month, and we were really hitting it off. We were taking things slow, and decided not to have sex right away or even do anything beyond making out until we really got to know each other. There was a ton of sexual tension there and I was raring to go.\n\nSo, it was his birthday, and we went out with a few of my friends. He got pretty wasted. I drove him home, and he suggested I come inside for a little while. He had been working me up, talking about how amazing he was going to make it that night, and I was seriously creaming my pants just waiting for it all to go down. \n\nWe go to his room, where I had never been. He's obviously still wasted and mumbles something about not having much time to clean lately as he's opening the door. He turned on his light and I literally gasped. His room was fucking FILTHY. He had no bed, just a mattress on the floor. Dirty laundry everywhere. Empty beer cans and DVD's and dishes on the floor and it smelled like rotting food.\n\nI have no logical reason for why that was not a deal breaker. It should have been, but *oh, I really really like him, and well it's his birthday, and hey my room gets messy sometimes too, and he isn't acting like it's a big deal so maybe I'm just being squeamish*...and thus went the mental gymnastics I performed in my head to justify the fact that this man had an entire month to prepare for this night, and these were the best accommodations he had to offer. So I politely asked him if I could get some clean sheets, and if he could maybe get rid of the rotten food and spray some air freshener or something (it fucking pains me just writing that sentence. ^So^much^why? )\n\nSo after I had snagged a few clean sheets to cover up the mattress, and febrezed, and the rotten food was removed and taken a few more shots, and the lights were turned down enough that I could almost ignore my surroundings and pretend this situation was something approaching normal, we started getting down to business. So we're making out. And making out. And making out some more, and that's all we are doing. And then I notice *he is fucking crying.*\n\nHe jumps up, naked, and flips on the lights. And points to his flaccid penis and gestures ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ like he's the announcer at the circus says **\"and here, ladies and gentleman, is the star of the show!\"**\n\nI beg him to please calm down, but he completely ignores me like I'm not even in the room. It is just him and his penis, and now they are having an argument. He is mad at his penis. He scolds his penis for ALWAYS FUCKING EVERYTHING UP! YOU ALWAYS DO THIS TO ME! EVERY TIME! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS??\n\nI'm just sitting there, frozen, on the verge of tears. Scared out of my fucking mind because this is literally the craziest shit I have ever witnessed in my life, and I have no idea where he's going with this. I try talking to him- *it's fine, you are just drunk, it happens, I don't care, really.* Again, it's like I'm not even in the room. Then finally, he turns his back, and lets out this horrible half groan half whimper. I see my out, grab my shit and high tail it out of there (my escape was complicated due to the lack of a clear path across the floor). As I'm hopping my way out, he's banging his fucking head against the wall slowly and methodically and slapping his penis. Or maybe giving it a spanking. In any case it's apparently being punished.\n\nThe kicker- I'm literally walking through the door and he screams at me \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE BITCH!\" Like yeah, dude...way ahead of you. \n\n**TL;DR After month long build up of sexual tension, find out dude I'm dating lives like a barn animal and gets into fights with his flaccid penis.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1372818578", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 62, "controversiality": 0}

Water usually boils at 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit, because water usually has the pressure of the entire atmosphere weighing down on it. When you suck through a straw, you create negative pressure, and at room temperature, after about 10 meters you've created enough negative pressure for water to boil. What keeps water molecules together in a liquid state is a combination of temperature (energy) and pressure. The higher the pressure, the higher the temperature needs to be in order to make water boil.

{"body": "&gt; The closest I ever had was a dog growing up. He helped a LOT, but it still wasn't the same, I'm sure.\n\nOh now you got me started. I *completely* understand that. I wasn't going to put this part in but here goes:\n\nWhen I was 3- 7 I had a puppy/ dog named Buster at my grandmother's house. I didn't live with him, but he was the closest thing I had and he was an amazing friend to have.\n\nFor 1st and 2nd grade my mom dropped me off at my grandmother's house to catch the school bus from there. He walked with me down the lane to the bus stop every single day. Most mornings I would stay outside and sit with him till my bus came, but if it was raining too hard/ too cold and I had to go inside, he would start barking when the bus got there to let me know when to come out.\n\nEvery day he would be sitting there waiting for me when I got off the bus from school. When my mom would pick me up late, I got to talk and play with him for hours. He raced me down the lane with my bike and we went and played in the woods and he let me come sit in his doghouse with him and talk about stuff. He was like a person to me.\n\nBut of course one day Buster wasn't there when I got off the bus. I called and looked for him but I couldn't find him so I sat and waited on the steps for my mom. When she got there she told me Buster got in a fight with a raccoon and he was dead. I cried the on the way home, but that was all. I guess I must've repressed it because I went to school the next day and I was fine. I never even had to talk about it.\n\nBut then out of nowhere one night in 8th grade I started *bawling*. I didnt know why at first, but I just knew I had to let that cry out. I realized that I *still* could've had Buster. He still could've been alive and with me that whole time and it wasn't fair. Before that I knew I'd kind of missed him, but I had no idea it hurt so much.\n\nEven now, thinking about Buster gets to me easier than anything else. This sounds *incredibly* corny but I get this dull ache in my heart whenever I think about him ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ can't help it. It had me tearing up at [an episode of Adventure Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrMYusN6X5E). Here's the [full episode](http://www.watchcartoononline.com/adventure-time-season-4-episode-13a-i-remember-you) if you want.\n\nAnyway:\n\n&gt;Though I was whacked across the back of the head when I misbehaved, and jacked up only a handful of times (I'll admit I deserved it each time), the **emotional control and manipulation was far more impacting.**I've since been able to move past it for the most part, but it's the kinda thing that always sticks with you, I think.\n\nYes. Exactly the same here, except I wouldn't quite say I ever got 'jacked up'. That sounds pretty harsh. \n\n&gt;I  don't hold much stock in blood or \"true\" family. I've found friends that treat me better than my blood ever did. \n\nYeah, whenever someone pulls \"Blood is thicker than water\" I call bullshit. That phrase's wrongness just gets under my skin.\n\nDon't tell me what to do. ***PITY***\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373054642", "subreddit": "empathetic", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Welcome to Pennsylvania my friend!\n\nThis will happen to you all the time. If I were in your shoes I'd have the biggest grin on my face. Not only could they be more wrong, but they have no idea they're standing right next to one. That's fantastic. So here's how to deal with it.\n\nFirst, don't become them. Don't avoid others out of fear or isolate yourself, or stereotype others in the community based on this experience - or you'll be no better than them and the divide widens. You're going to run into a ton of diversity here so it's best to let comments like these roll off you like water on a duck's back.\n\nSecondly, and my favorite, imagine you are playing a video game like Skyrim. Think of the deities and religions you find in those games - that you have to learn a little about and understand how the locals view things. You can't change anyone's minds in those games. Declaring you don't believe in Talos or Azura doesn't really change anything either except for your own character and actions. The religions you run into in real life are no different than say, the nine divines. You've got the Amish out there in Lancaster worshiping the daedric prince Hircine for example. (Why do you think they live in isolation and closer to nature? That's right, lycanthropy.) The religions here are just the ones that cropped up. So understand that every local culture is going to have it's traditions, superstitions, and religions. You're immersed in it. So just go with the flow and don't take it personally. \n\nYou're also in Pennsylvania. You will have a \"I can't believe they said that shit\" moment at least once a week. Twice, if you live where I think you live. \n\nIf religion comes up, avoid it, decline to talk about it, and despite what many atheists like to do, don't argue about it. There's no point. They aren't going to change their minds because some guy disagreed with them in the library. Instead, show them the true nature of your character. Work with them. Be nice to them. Show them who an atheist truly is. Then and only then should you reveal yourself by sucking the blood out of their newborn children and laying your eggs of damnation in in their attics and crawlspaces.\n\nThis country's stance on gays and gay marriage didn't really change because people got up in the faces of those that saw homosexuality as a sin - no one likes to be wrong - these people changed their beliefs after seeing for themselves over time (whether on TV or in person) that gays were people too.\n\nNow, if all this fails, and you find yourself on the back of a horse and buggy with a town full of Amish waving pitchforks and torches screaming \"Buuuurn him! Burn the nonbeliever! A sacrifice for Hircine! OOOoooOOOOoooOOO!\" well then, it might be time to move out of Pennsylvania.\n\nThat's what I did. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373280910", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

Regardless, there is a huge jerk about it, and everyone gets angry at the laws because it makes sense that you don't want innocent people convicted of those terrible crimes.\n\nThose seem to be the concerns of ~1/4 of the people, and the one I can sympathize with in any respect. That said, if you accidentally find CP and report it to the police, everything is fine and you get to go along your way. \n\nSo I have no clue where the rest is coming from.

{"body": "I remember my first time. I've always been able to avoid them fairly easily...but that one day....I guess it was cause I made eye contact with her just as I was passing by. She was very pretty, and very hands on with me. Her soft skin, exotic accent, and cute charm helped me envision a future together where we traveled to her home country, with her showing me the many magnificent intricacies of what I can only believe to be a beautiful place. As much as it pained me to have let her down by not even buying a single thing (I can't justify dropping 40 bucks on some small bottle of lotion I've never heard of before), I had to retreat. As I slowly and increasingly distanced myself from her,  I could feel her passion and persuasion growing, overwhelming and near unbearable. Alas...I was free, left only with a distant memory, a crushed dream, a blurry face, and an unrecognizable name......\n\nBut on the plus side, the backside of my left hand was RIDICULOUSLY smooth. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1373532898", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

And Hoya's rap part where everything kind of pauses is badass, it reminds me of Dongwoo's epic rap in Tic Toc a little. Sunggyu and Woohyun brought the vocals as usual, and I could listen to Woohyun sing forever tbh.\n\nThe song is interesting, and I mean that in a good way. I love Sweetune's stuff so I was a bit nervous about them having a new producer for this song, but it still sounds \"them\" while being noticeably different from their past work. I love the hook-ish part after \"you're my destiny\", it's already stuck in my head.\n\nI honestly was so caught up in fangirl flailing and evaluating the song that I barely noticed the plotty parts of the MV so I will rewatch for that. I did notice two Sungjongs, of which I approve very much. Double the flawless~\n\nAlso the styling for this comeback is on point. Even with all the center parts. I'm living for the metal claw thing and the corsets. And the choreo looks awesome, I can't wait to see them perform live or release a dance/practice version (speaking of, \"Ver. B\"?

B) Due to issues on both sides of the family, regarding certain family members and their actions, I do fear that my child would be an asshole. I don't want to be in the position both of our parents have been in throughout the years, one of which has had no life of her own due to events that have taken place.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm very selfish and have shit tons of anxiety, paranoia, etc. issues that I don't think any child should have to deal with. Ever. In regards to selfishness, I think my thoughts on children are incredibly selfish. Most people want to have children to raise, enjoy time with, carry on the family name, etc. When I think about having children, it's so that if my husband dies first, someone will be left for me.

{"body": "**Lil Wayne**\n\nJail. Lean/weed/health might be contributing factors, but the dude is just doing other things now, as opposed to the years leading up to his sentence when he was in the studio almost every waking hour. Eight months without music, drugs, fans or his life in general is a strange experience, and it's not surprising he decided to dedicate the majority of his time to himself, skating and his family.\n\n**Eminem**\n\nA combination between aging and drugs. Obviously Encore was a direct result of his pill addiction, and Relapse (even though I liked it) was an awkward adjustment back to rapping after severe memory loss over a long period of time. Recovery, on the other hand, is just a 40 year old dude trying to put out successful music in his career's shadow. Obviously he's not going to put out content like SSLP/MMLP, and he's just too far out of touch to deliver the maturity of TES without being as corny as Recovery.\n\n**Wiz Khalifa**\n\nGetting rich. The dude was open about his intentions in the game from day one, and he's achieved it. He's married, has a kid and has more money than he even needs, and no motivation to keep trying with his raps.\n\n**50 Cent**\n\nAgain, money combined with irrelevancy of his style. Curtis vs Graduation proved both of these factors - gangsta rap no longer sells, and Kanye's motivation (ego, artistic pride) gave him more longevity than 50's (get rich or die trying).\n\nI'd write more but I don't really know an awful lot about other artists' fallings off and I was originally going to just write out Wayne's but then adderall. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374662079", "subreddit": "hiphopheads", "score": 122, "controversiality": 0}

This claim is just preposterous and you backed it up by literally no evidence whatsoever. When I pointed this out with some extremely elementary statistics, you got all huffy and mad and started vomiting pseudo intellectual condescending drivel, even pulling the education card (despite having literally no basis on which to deduct my education), which was extremely amusing. \n\nThis is way too many words to waste on a internet argument about tank game statistics, but this is fun. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1374681616", "subreddit": "WorldofTanks", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "~~Why do you think John Key is a sociopath? America used to be a symbol of democracy to Americans, but I'm not sure it ever really was.~~\n\n~~You say we had crazy governments, but why? Are you not in a reasonably comfortable position? You're complaining about all this, but look at places in Africa, Eastern Europe, South East Asia, South America, The United States of America, the list goes on. We come out on top or near it on bucketloads of little studies ranking countires according to how safe they are, or free. How many people can you honestly say that you know who've had their houses robbed, or been stabbed? Murdered? Assaulted with a baseball bat? Kidnapped at a young age and placed into slavery?~~ \n\n~~How many people do you know, that have been unable, due to the law, to do as they please and think as they please and to speak their mind where ever and whenever without legal repercussions? Think about these people, I know of a few people, through various friends or directly from the person. Do you know what the reasons were? Being gay and unable to marry, due to antiquated law which has been fixed now. Drug charges, once again due to antiquated laws. Driving charges, but we've decided that we're willing to limit peoples freedoms to drive with alcohol in their system, or to drive really fast, or without have some certification to indicate the possession of basic driving skills.~~\n\n~~So, we've got people who were unable to do so because of old laws, which are being updated, or because it's putting others at risk. I honestly can't see why you'd think that we're getting worse. We have a relatively low crime rate when looking at the general population of Earth. Yes, some areas, such as child abuse, are bad, and things need to be done to improve those areas, but when you consider everything, we're very good. We're nearly the best, and we're getting better.~~\n\n~~This new law will not change any of that, all it will do is mean that in the situation that something happens that warrants the use of available information to keep New Zealand in that kind of position, and to keep improving it. You make my point exactly, it'll no longer be just about cameras being in usable places dairies, fast food outlets, nearby banks. All information would be able to be used. Imagine if someone robbed your house and the police could simply utilise all that information which is gathered. Check to see which phones have been there, vehicles in the area, seen by cameras, all that sort of thing, and go \"well, this person was walking around your house for no reason, and they walked away carrying something\". Follow them using collected data and good stuff, you've got the person who did it. How is that a bad thing? A jury would basically be able to watch the crime take place, in various formats. If someone claimed to have been set up, you check it out, because you can.~~\n\n~~Can you imagine the uproar if police in New Zealand started arresting people and detaining indefinitely them for silly shit like being affiliated with a bunch of hippies who protest in the streets?~~\n\nI'm sick of trying give reasons to justify this dumb bill, it was fun to begin with but it's been a couple of days. I actually agree with you and just wanted to see if I could argue for it.

Big fan of the Sentinel second, hard drive, to get out of all of the bullshit in this game. People underestimate what a second chance means, even if that second chance is with point-Sentinel. Also a big fan of a seldom-used anchor played well. I saw you were thinking about messing with different anchors (strider or phoenix). Try out X23. If she has 3 bars then one character is just dead, she has a 'bionic arm' like viper, and that girl is FAST. Definitely underrated anchor.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1375232028", "subreddit": "MvC3", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
