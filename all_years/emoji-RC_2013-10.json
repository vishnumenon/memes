I'm neither Democrat or Republican, so my voice doesn't get heard along with the remaining American population that isn't in a major party. With that being said it's really just what bigger government officials think, feel, and decide. Do these people get a general consensus of what Americans like you or me think. Fuck no. Federal Government is there own game. It's statisticly impossible that every Republican will agree with every other Republicans view and same goes for Democrats, or really any fucking political party. So I think that a lot of what the government does even when it is running, is un-consented.

{"body": "WOW, SHE IS COMPARING HERSELF TO AN OLYMPIAN.\n\nTo be more specific I don't think she understands the comparison she is making. She compares her size to a woman who is a shot putter. The Olympic shot putter is not \"fat\" in a sense. I am spitballing here, so please correct me if I am wrong, but she has to very muscular correct? I mean to have the power to throw a dense object for long distances, you need to be strong and muscular. Lean muscle mass is pretty dense so that would make sense that she is heavy.\n\nIt's like those powerlifters or the olympic weight lifters for example. Those guys/women are built like a fucking tank. I mean we are talking people who can lift over 600lbs. By the very fact that you can do that means you will weigh around 200-300 maybe (somewhat on the higher end, but it's enough to account for a BMI of \"obese\" status). But the catch is that, most of their body is just muscle. They are just dense powerhouses of muscle and energy that's how those people are able to achieve such feats of strength. The error would be comparing an actual fat person to these people. A man or woman who is 250 lbs that doesn't exercise or does very little and eats a lot has absolutely no right in comparing themselves to a 250 weightlifter/powerlifter or even a running back in football. There is no comparison to be made.\n\nI honestly can't believe she is saying this. OH I AM \"X\" lbs AND THIS OLYMPIC ATHLETE IS THE SAME WEIGHT, THUS WE ARE BOTH ATHLETIC AND HEALTHY  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThis is stupid right?\n\nAnd on a side note, I get her point about that you shouldn't give a fuck about what people say, but there is a line that is crossed when you start saying shit like this.\n\nEDIT: I just want to say that she does bring up points that aren't crazy by TIA standards. Some are quite sensible. However by no means am I automatically invalidating her points because she is fat, which she isn't really.

Today I decided I'm crediting my GTAO towards Pokemon X (already getting Y) whenever they released this statement:\n\n\"Updated 3PM ET 10/11/13: Given some of the recent technical issues during these first days of GTA Online, and now that things are starting to look much smoother (touch wood!), we are planning to provide a special stimulus package for all who have played or will play Grand Theft Auto Online this month. We will be dropping a cool half a million GTA$ in the GTA Online bank accounts of all players this month, starting as early as next week. For more details about how when and how the money will be awarded, see: Grand Theft Auto Online: Half a Million GTA$ Stimulus Package this Month\n\nFor those asking about their lost characters or rank, those will not be able to be restored so we sincerely hope that this cash stimulus we’re giving out this month will help you get back on your feet or to make your new life in Los Santos &amp; Blaine extra sweet.\"\n\nAfter telling us to hold on and that they haven't forgotten about us who lost stuff.. so putting in 80hrs to a game within 5 days and then them just saying...\n\n ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nWhenever the 500k stimulus is probably more to help the Stock Market in the game and nothing else. This was my first GTA that I actually complete the story for too and I enjoyed it but the reason I bought it was to play the online...that didn't workout.\n\nSo now I'm spending all my free time playing Pokemon X and Y because I've never ever felt let down by a Pokemon game and have always been able to play several hundred hours without any problem EVER. I've never had a problem with anything that I've put time into that has been made by Nintendo so I bought my gf and I both DS XLs and Pokemon Y (for me) and X (for her but now also X for myself since selling GTA) because I know it will be a great experience with zero downtime and unlimited fun :D\n\n\n\nI don't have any friends on my DS yet as I have just been grinding out a team on black while I was playing GTA, but I'm sure I'll get around to adding people on Pokemon when I see a benefit to doing so..\n\ngonna go pickup my game in 6 hours, since I figured I'd let the girlfriend sleep so we can grind out a nice 10+hr session tomorrow.\n\nTLDR; Sold GTAO because lost my level 87 w/ 80hrs 5days after launch in order to buy X (already have Y preordered) for myself because I love Pokemon &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Good luck to all Kalos trainers on their wonderful journeys! \n\nPOKEMON HERE I COME &lt;333\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/hRDXr\n\n^ Our DS XLs :D\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381568515", "subreddit": "pokemon", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Right now, all that matters is me, you, and the other 18000 people on this subreddit. \n\nSeeing as all the answers have been taken, I'll do something special for you, my love. I shall complete each sentence as if it were a complete story with a narrative.\n\n'Harry, these men keep appearing at my door every day, and I don't know what they want.'\n\nHarry looked at Priscilla the same way that a child looks at a dead pigeon, and continued eating his breakfast. 'Do they, by any chance look dirty and rugged? The Johnsons have been calling about the spectres on Kent Avenu- well, called, they broke off for some reason.'\n\n'Well, what did they manage to say?'\n\n'Pete was all panicked, kept on saying \"The ghosts have started disappearing from my road\" over and over. Cut off mid-mantra.'\n\n'Did you check on them this morning?'\n\nHarry sighed, and rolled his eyes. ''Cilla, most likely the Johnsons were being attacked by the living dead, we can only assume that the Johnsons are no longer worth saving. We need to build the pit.'\n\nTwo days later, all the zombies had been apprehended, and were being put into the large pit.\n\n'Just lower it gently to the bottom,' warned Harry, as Priscilla lowered the last vocal-cordless zombie on a rope. 'If you wake them up, they'll all start ripping each other apart, and we have people we love down there. We didn't sedate them for nothing.' He turned to two of the zombies who still had a voice to gurgle with. \n\n'What do you want from us?' he inquired. 'What can we possibly offer you?' \n\nThey tried to leap angrily at Harry, but found themselves restrained by ropes around their wrists behind them. \n\n'Hey, easy, or I'll gag ya. We'll tie up your mouth first, then yours second.' This statement was in jest, but the creatures took it as a serious threat, and sat politely, solemn as mourners. \n\n'Now,' Harry continued, 'what is it that you want?' \n\nTears filled their eyes; 'We want to be children again.'\n\n''Cilla, get my Disney film down from that building equipment,' Harry ordered. 'We're gonna watch us some movies.'\n\nHalfway through the third repeat of Beauty and the Beast, Priscilla could not hold in a concern that had been bugging her since the first day of sedating; 'Harry, I can't stop fretting about this blister. I think it might be infected.'\n\n''Cilla, you really can't take care of yourself, can you?' Harry responded, not taking his eyes off the film. 'I always have to take care of you, don't I? Every single query you have, you *always* have to bug me with it, who the fuck do you think I am, a doctor or something? Put some boiling water over it or something, bloody woman.' He turned to Priscilla, expecting to see the usual crumpled flower he always saw after a verbal beating. But now he could only see a twisted grin. In fact, all the zombies happened to be looking at him with the same expression.\n\n'Oh, good morning Beast,' Priscilla growled, and sunk her teeth into Harry's screaming neck. \n\n:(", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1381591162", "subreddit": "radiohead", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

According to their manual of arms, you can grip it by the magwell when at ease, but are supposed to hold it by the guard when firing. But a large portion of the videos I've seen show people holding it by the magwell. \n\nNow to nitpick. The first pic is an AK-12. The new and shiny modernized version fresh off the line. I would assume they've fixed that \"problem\" with it being their latest version.\n\nThe second pic is a 74m(?). Yup, that's an AK. Maybe the smaller round doesn't have that issue? Maybe bakelite mags fit better?\n\nThe third pic is of an vz. 58. It's Czech and not an AK by any means, although they use the same round and look similar.

Great and innovative music continues to come out today, and will continue to come out as long as \"music\" is a thing. Plenty of albums have reached \"Kid A potential\" in the past 10 years if you ask me...\n\nAs for the original discussion, I do like your comparison, save for the differences Keeks pointed out. Kid A was really off the wall compared to any other mainstream music at the time. Reflektor is a weirder vibe for Arcade Fire, true. But this disco revival thing is pretty popular right now (RAM), so they aren't \"rebelling\" against the mainstream in that regard. However, they have done a fantastic job of reinventing themselves as a group, and Reflektor is awesome for that.\n\nA better example of \"pulling a Kid A\" is MGMT. They were radio-popular, and they rebelled against that with their second and third albums, and suffered for it. But in the end, they got to keep their artistic integrity.\n\nedit: Hey, why the downvote?

The States have almost 10 times as many people as Canada spread over a much larger area.

(Look at car-sharing services like Hourcar for similar situations.) When I was working downtown, Nice Ride was perfect for me. The bus dropped me off at one end of Nicollet Mall, but work was on the opposite end. I could wait several minutes for the next bus, or I could grab a bike and get on my merry way. It's faster, and especially on a nice day, a bike ride *feels* good.\n\nI've also used them as a convenient way to get around spontaneously. Last week I was grabbing dinner at 26th &amp; Lyndale when some friends wanted to hang at their place near the MIA. Rather than get my car and hassle with yet another parking dilemma, I took a Nice Ride. Probably got me there in the same amount of time, if not less.\n\nThat's how bike sharing works. Point A to Point B. Not a lazy ride around the lakes, not a long ride out to Stillwater.
