{"body": "Because Reddit uses Verdana for the default comment font, and Verdana doesn't have a very large character set.  You see a square because the character trying to be displayed doesn't exist within the font.  Open CHARMAP and take a look (start &gt; run &gt; charmap.exe)\n\nThe browser makes a series of attempts to set fonts.  Here's the CSS for Reddit's comments: \n\n&gt; normal x-small verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif\n\nIt first tries Verdana, then Arial, then Helvetica, then a generic sans-serif font as a last ditch effort.\n\nOn your system, Verdana exists, so it's used.  On other systems, it doesn't, so the browser works its way down the chain until it finds a font that is installed on the OS (fonts which have a larger character set). If you deleted Verdana from your system fonts, it would use Arial, which does have all the right characters, so you wouldn't be seeing squares.  \n\nReddit devs should be using a different font for the default if they want to support a wide range of characters within the comment section on varying platforms.  \n\nThe characters render if you use Reddit's code formatting, which uses a monospace font.\n\n    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n**EDIT:** I'm NOT telling you to delete Verdana. Don't do that.  It's a system font, and it is widely used online.  In most cases, there are no issues with it.  It only becomes an issue when people start trying to draw pictures with it.  I was saying if it was not on your system, the CSS would fall back on Arial.  The ideal solution would be to have a greasemonkey script that tells reddit to skip Verdana entirely. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383459189", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

I panicked and pulled the lid off of the tank and raised the float to stop the water, then I reached under the toilet and closed the valve. So I'm standing in a quarter inch of poo water, pooling out from the bowl, stark naked and I reach for the plunger. \"Thank God\", I think as I begin to use it to unstop the toilet, but on my first plunge, realize it's old rubber, and the plunger flips inside out, catapulting water up out of the bowl. Oh dear. So, I grab hold of the plunger head and manually flip it back right-side out. Gross. I plunge gentler this time and after some himming and hawing, it finally goes down. WHEW. Now to deal with the floor. There are no towels in the cabinet. But there are these other ones on the rack. The embroidered decorative ones. That'll have to do. I soak up what I can, wringing it out periodically in the bathtub, repeating until the floor is no longer a swamp. What to do with the evidence, though? Well, nothing to do but put the towels into the hamper. Don't say a word about it, shower, and head to bed. Oh well.\n\nTL;DR Clogged my girlfriend's grandparents' toilet, broke their plunger, cleaned the floor with their nice towels. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1383540328", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

человек могут попробовать себя на некоторое время взгляд им только напишу мои идеи, чтобы увидеть, если вы хотели, если вы не делаете nufsaid но если вы пытаетесь помочь мне заставить их слушать

͡°) O Бен 10 игр beatemup игры и сегодня мы можем превратить его в свободный бродят песочнице игре вы guive миссий, побочных миссий, дополнительные материалы, и проблемы Хорошим примером может быть Бэтмен Arkahm Город много побочных миссий и проблемы с плюс дополнительные предметы коллекционирования с, но игроки должны большую награду, если бы Бен получает каждый коллекционный в городе он guets новый и очень прохладно иностранца в его Omnitrix или дополнительные технологии для обновления или новые полномочия или обновлений для своих иностранцев, и получите бесплатную бродят песочнице сделать его как Assassins Creed, что вы бегать города, но если вы хотите ехать в другой город, то вы идете через контрольно-пропускной пункт, но в новой Бен своей то же самое с городами Зависит, что если вы хотите пойти на другую планету вы действительно идете в контрольно-пропускном пункте, но при перемещении в другой планете, как в Kingdom Hearts, теперь на полномочия и все мы Теперь Бен использует свой Omnitrix превратиться в все его иностранцам А как насчет начать только десять, но guive его на протяжении всей истории, и побочных миссий все другие, которые он когда-либо превратился в, ну, пока их не бесполезно, и позволить ему использовать QUIK SELCT как возмущаются те, но вернуть использованием Омнитрикса как нажать кнопку и Омнитрикса появляется на экране, и вы можете вращать баре Omnitrix проверки Wich тот, который вы хотите использовать, теперь на полномочия и лично мне нравится боевая стиле прототипа причина для меня половина удовольствия было выбрать то, что было бороться, а в новом Бен 10 выбор части является чужеродным вы хотите использовать, но он борьбу я хочу чтобы вы чувствовали себя пересилил, сделав вам победить армию Youre собственные снимая сотни enmies но хорошая игра не может быть прогулка в парке так каждый иностранец имеет слабость enemie поэтому каждый будет иметь то, что может полностью нейтрализовать чужеродные, что таким образом вы будете превращаться в другой, но вы все равно можете продолжать борьбу с той же самой, но Itll быть намного более трудно победить Также я хотел бы использовать великих держав, в прототипе, а не хромой комбо, которые даже не позволяют делать потрясающие вещи, и некоторые иностранцы имеют специальные навыки, как серое вещество может попасть в любую машину или робот, чтобы управлять машиной, или Wildmutt может вынюхивать скрытые объекты, технологии, предметы коллекционирования или как обновление, что он может обладать любой машине, и он может обновить их с ракетами или шипами или возможность сделать автомобиль или ездить летом на стена, которая была бы безумным и в конце игры, как сделать в Kingdom Hearts на одной из PSP в Wich после окончания они положили почти невозможно бои Agains сильных боссов в конечном счете, и я, очевидно, вы выиграете вы получите окончательную цену как пришелец , которая не appeard на шоу еще, но это еще не мой выбор вывода и Ive были жалобы от друга, который хочет использовать Alien X А как насчет guiving Бен в часть истории власти бар, что Asmuth сделал, как обновление для Omnitrix который позволяет Вы используете не только чужеродные X, но в полной мере потенциал всех иностранцев, как обновление может обладать любой машине, но с властью баре можно не только зарядиться энергией Omnitrix но вы также можете обладать огромной машины, как полная судов O для ясности: возложите каждый ALIEN даже большой путь в местах, которые он подходит O и добавить врагов, как большой, как путь Большой и закончить это пытаются сделать историю как война между видами в огромных полях сражений делает Бен борьбы в войнах и городов хорошо вот и все Ив добрался, я надеюсь, вам понравится мои идеи так мольбы, если вы думаете, что его стоит Youre время помочь мне сделать

Auburn was two years off a national championship and was expected to bounce back that year but never did, costing the coach his job. We've also been scheduled with them for years because of division and rivalry. Mizzou was injury plagued that year and didn't make any sort of impact. They had been ranked numerous times the past year. Kentucky is struggling but conference play can't be avoided. They're basically the vandy of the east(or were, since vandy is getting wins this year). Arkansas had been top ten for a while and was scheduled prior to the coaching meltdown. We also thrashed a top 10 michigan to start 2012. Mississippi state could easily go 10-1 or 11-0 in a 2012/2013 ACC, They're mid SEC but can never get past those top teams in our conference. \n\nThe other OOC games are because of two things\n1) people don't want to play us out of fear of losing(see UMICH who cancelled the scheduled series through 2018)\n2) we play lower teams like many other ranked teams and help them develop their programs in the meantime. Many other top 10 teams do this, not just us.\n\nWe also beat Georgia in the 2013 SECCG, something I doubt ND could do.\n\nThe thing with being in our position is it's very hard to schedule games OOC. Cross conference helps with LSU, USCe and others, but that's rotational. Even then, I could put a trashy Kentucky in another conference and probably see a .500+ Season with them.\n\n\n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384092613", "subreddit": "CFB", "score": -4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Onto the line by line you did:\n\n&gt; When you say you're not comparing Paul and Obama, this quote makes that on the whole not credible.\n\nLet's go to the tape!  \"I'm not comparing the actions of Paul and Obama\"  Actions is the operative word here.  Plagiarism and mismanagement of a program's roll out are clearly very different, but the blame for both scandals was very similar.  That's basically the only thing I care about out of that comparison.\n\n&gt; You are literally imagining what Obama has or has not done.\n\nI think it's a pretty widely accepted truth that Presidents are busy people.  He probably got briefed on it- probably fairly often- but he was briefed by people who where running it daily and worked closely with the roll out.  Presumably they didn't imagine it would be a terrible fuck up, and that would be reflected in how their briefings described things.  I have no idea what Obama did or didn't know, but I think it's safe to say that in the lead up to the roll out he was more focused on other issues, whether they be possibly getting into a freaking war with Syria (nbd) or the shutdown of the federal government (which I imagine you also blame on Obama).  The roll out was clearly not at the top of his list of concerns.  Starting a war and getting the government back on track was.\n\n&gt; When you said that the world perceives that it is his fault, so why would he deny it?\n\nHuh?  As **you** pointed out, he didn't deny it, he took the blame.  This is what leaders do.  He was honest, it was unacceptable to have the roll out this poorly botched.  It was under his watch, however many other pressing issues there where to focus on.  He said as much.  Since when is making a mistake (no matter how large) equivalent to lying?\n\n&gt; No, it isn't unquestionable that Obamacare has saved anyone money. No one has signed up for it out of the projected amount of people who did. People gave up.\n\nWell, no.  More people went to the site than they where expecting, hence the crash.  For the sake of the discussion, let's just imagine for a moment that the site and all things related to the exchange are a total black hole.  Entirely a failure, helping literally zero people.  That *still* doesn't address the fact that ACA helps all the 20 somethings that now can be on their parents' insurance until age 26.  It doesn't address all the people with preexisting conditions who are now covered.  It doesn't address the state run exchanges that have been massively successful (I'm not the first to observe that having such a system will eventually be a reason to move or start a business in such a state, so that it's more attractive for talented workers who would need to move for their jobs).\n\n&gt; You only have anecdotal evidence for your assertion that Obamacare has helped people, which if you remember you criticized me for.\n\nOnly in Republicanland where everything ACA has already done before the website roll out didn't happen.  There is a reason that prior to this massive PR hit, Obamacare was gaining in popularity in Pew polls.\n\n&gt; Again, it is completely off base to expect Republican governors to simply enact a widely unpopular policy in their government, especially when a lot of blue states don't have one either.\n\nWhat about the free money they where offered to do so?  Why not set up a website when you can better fund things that *do* matter to you?  What about the free money for medicaid many Republican governors rejected?  Was that out of the conservative principle that the poor should lift themselves up from their bootstraps?  Then why have medicaid at all?  Leaders of the Republican party are fundamentally inconsistent.  They would never in a million years have the bravery to end medicaid entirely in their states, but they'll stick it to Obama and make his new plan work not as well at a very real human cost for the sake of saying \"Fuck you\" to a Democrat.  This is unprecedented, and while I don't care to get into an offshoot disagreement about Democratic treatment of Bush, they  certainly never went out of their way to make sure whatever did pass failed.\n\n&gt; So honestly, I don't know why I'm getting worked up with an anon redditor. I really shouldn't, because this isn't a debate in my mind, it is an exchange.\n\nI mean... exchanging ideas when you disagree is inherently debate.  One person says something, the other thus far has literally been quoting them and directly responding, with OP then responding back in kind.  This is the definition of debate.  Pretending it isn't what is happening is kind of meaningless, it just allows people to feel like *they* aren't that combative internet asshole that both of us kind of are (I mean... proof is in the pudding here).\n\n\n&gt; Had you provided evidence literally at any point in this exchange, maybe I'd support it, or at least hate it less. \n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  As someone who was very successful in competitive debate when I was younger, I guess I don't understand what you want.  It's true, I haven't been citing sources, and that is laziness on my part.  But given that your sources have been A) Proven to be factually untrustworthy or B) just saying something we both agree with, I guess I don't see the merit.  If you *really* want I could try to find the time to go through and source everything.  I know it's massive cop out to say I might not have the time, but it's the truth (I work on weekends).\n\n&gt; However, when everything is a conspiracy to you, and nothing you accept besides you own anecdotal evidence, it becomes impossible to make a point.\n\nWhat?  What'd I say that was a conspiracy.  Legitimately confused by what this means.  Describe my conspiracy theory.  From my understanding of what anuhope is thinking, I think Obama and his administration made a colossal fuck up that is going to set back his signature program for a bit.  While he personally probably didn't cause the fuck up, he has final say on everything and at absolute bare minimum he trusted the wrong people to deliver, which is probably giving him too much credit but nonetheless would still be bad.  Regardless, if not for the media circus around it, this would be seen as a minor setback in a program that will soon be a third rail in politics on par with social security.  Upon it's full implementation, threatening to defund or kill ACA will be political suicide.  If I'm wrong, it will at minimum help a bunch of people, as it has already started to do through any of the numerous ways I listed previously in the post.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384672450", "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Thank you for the reasoned argument. It is uncommon on the internet. I'll do my best to honor it.\n&gt;Nothing at all. I don't think anyone is arguing that nullification CAN'T be abused. Of course it can. But can you think any right or privilege that can't be abused?\n\nConceded.\n&gt;I'm not advocating people go in throwing around the word nullification to get out of jury duty. They shouldn't.\n\nOk, good. The argument I was addressing above was talking about jury nullification during voir dire to get out of duty. I think judges are well within their rights to sanction shirkers and time wasters. I'm guessing that you agree.\n\n&gt;Just shut your fucking mouth and vote not guilty if you disagree with the law.\n\nBut that is the point. A jury is there to help the courts determine guilt / settle disputes. Courts, and specifically a jury, are badly equipped to weigh in on what the law should be (which is not to say courts do not do so, but they generally try to leave political matters to the political branches). Here's why:\n\n1. A court is not democratic. A judge is not usually elected and has extraordinary powers over individual rights. They have to have those powers to issue verdicts with meaning. They have little to no power over the laws themselves.\n\n2. A jury is not a democratic entity. Though it operates by voting, it is randomly selected, small cross-section of your local community. They are not empowered to make laws for the rest of us; rather, to determine guilt and settle disputes in specific cases.\n\n3. The law that they are nullifying was duly passed through the democratic / republican process: Legislature, Executive, and sometimes high courts all approved it. Citizens approve the law by electing representatives that extend or preserve it. The law serves the People. Even if a small group doesn't like it, it is the duely enacted law of the land. Judges rule on laws they hate all the time---corner a Federal criminal trial court judge about mandatory minimum sentences, and you'll get quite a conversation.\n\n4. Nullification does not address the problem---which is the law. They prevent punishment in one case only. The next jury may not nullify. This leads to uneven and unpredictable justice, one of the worst possible outcomes for any justice system---an unevenness that it cannot fix.\n\n5. It leaves the court in a bad situation. Generally, trials are divided into questions of fact and questions of law. The judge handles the law, and (generally speaking) the jury determines issues of fact. If the judge gets the law wrong, you can appeal to an appeals court (or higher) and they will rule on the question of law. Appeals courts in the US nearly never reach issues of fact. That is the design of the system. One of the reasons for this design is so that authority is not concentrated in one place---no one entity is the trier of law and fact. With jury nullification, the jury short circuits (SEGFAULT!) this system and becomes the trier of law and fact. This give very little for an appeals court to do---how can they review the decision of a jury? The entire system of justice is then broken. This is why most judges take a dim view of nullifiers. It prevents them from doing their job.\n\n6. If there is an error in the law, you can appeal. No, it isn't as good as getting a law passed in the normal process, but it does happen. Jury nullification prevents this from happening.\n\n&gt;As far as legislation and pardons go. Sure. Those are viable methods to the law being changed, but they are slow and not guaranteed. \n\nModern American government gives you the ability to work to change a law. It isn't easy and there are no guarantees. But, ultimately, all law originate with People. Yes, even lobbyists and CEOs are citizens.\n\n&gt;But we live in an imperfect system where the legislation and executive branch do not always make reasonable decisions. Nullification is the power that is the last bastion of governmental checks and balances.\n\nThis is an issue that you must take to the People. All legal authority originates with them. The courts are only a narrow device designed to deliver justice in limited and specific cases. Laws of general application come from the other branches.\n\nI see jury nullification as an unavoidable feature that arises from the compromises that our justice system makes. \n\nTo pull from the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification_in_the_United_States) (a pretty good summary):\n\n&gt;The American jury draws its power of nullification from its right to render a general verdict in criminal trials, the inability of criminal courts to direct a verdict no matter how strong the evidence, the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause, which prohibits the appeal of an acquittal, and the fact that jurors can never be punished for the verdict they return.\n\nThose are all valuable rights, rules, and checks and balances. They add up to give us jury nullification---something that they courts cannot prevent.\n\nDo juries have the power to nullify? Ok, sure. We also have the power to overthrow the government by force of arms. Neither one can really be taken away.\n\n&gt;I mean on the topic of drug offenses.\n\nYou'll find that a lot of judges agree with you in private*. And yet, they have a job to do. When they put on the robe, their personal feelings have to be left aside in favor of the law that the People have given them to work with and uphold. Some are, as always, better at this than others.\n\n*: I'm not a judge. Personally I think that drug use should not be treated as a crime, rather as lawful behavior (for the less destructive drugs) and as addiction in others (for the drugs that actively destroy lives).\n\n&gt;In the past 20 years, we've seen the violent crime rate pretty much cut in half, yet incarcerations are still on an upward increase.\n\nAgain, I agree with you on this. But some people will argue that these incarcerations have resulted in lowered violent crime rates. These are the sort of people that believe that punishment of one criminal leads potential criminals to reconsider their future unlawful plans. I'll conceded the rest of the drugs &amp; punishment section, since we agree.\n&gt;What are we supposed to do until they do address it? \n\nVote. Campaign. March. Write letters. Phone bank. Form a PAC. Form a super PAC. Print a pamphlet. Speak at churches, temples, and mosques. Collect money. Donate. Knock on doors. Argue (respectfully). Found a halfway house. Approach the local courts and police about partnership. Disrupt. Engage. Change lives.\n\nAll that requires interacting with other Citizens.\n\nDo *anything* you can to tackle the problem. Jury nullification was used to combat fugitive slave laws and prohibition. But it was also accompanied by movements and efforts and societies and action to abolish these laws. Relying on nullification alone won't get us there. The tool has limits.\n\n&gt;The legislative branch is almost to the point of being broken beyond repair at this point. We just got through Congressional redistricting after the 2010 Census that has gerrymandered districts into a two party stalemate. Our political environment at this point can best be described vitriol. Our government hasn't passed a budget in years. If we can't even agree on how to fund our country, when do you think Drug War reform is going to occur?\n\nIt isn't broken. I don't like where we are, but we've been through worse. The years following the Revolution, in terms of budget, and the Civil War and it's aftermath in terms of vitriol.\n\nAgain, reform comes from us, the People. And the tide is turning on marijuana and gay marriage. Those issues will catalyze others.\n\n&gt;\"unjust, cruel, and irrational\"\n\nYep. But he has to execute the law as the People have enacted it. Or else he becomes a tyrant. I'd guess that he left that in his opinion so that the appeals court would have something to grab onto from the court of first impression.\n\n&gt;This is why I believe in the right of Jury Nullification. Not to blindly just dump laws that we don't like. Its there for the citizens to reserve the right to acquit someone when a law is unjust and the punishment is disproportionate to the crime.\n\nThese are points for an appellate court, or a political branch, to address. Or the People themselves.\n\n&gt;Judges don't have to like it, or agree with it. Plenty of Judges don't believe its an actual power. \n\nRight. It's a sort of side effect of the protections we give to defendants and juries.\n\n&gt;In the grand scheme of the topic, more courts have affirmed Nullification a right of the people then not.\n\nI have not done a complete survey of the case law. But in most of cases I have read, the courts do not affirm that nullification is a right or a power. They affirm that there is nothing that they can do about it, so this case is finished. This is more akin to a food critic being served dog food. It's unreviewable. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nI'm not going to trade quotes with you. I think our (respectful) argument between two Citizens is more important than what some dead guys thought. My guess is that they shared that feeling as well. I refer to the Founding Fathers to catch the general spirit of things, but it is up to us to handle the details. That is why they left us the system to do so. If they did not trust us, they would have left a much more restrictive system. But they evidently did trust us to make up our own minds and laws. It would be sad if they had not.\n\nI'd like to thank you for your argument. It is something that happens infrequently in this country now, and I think that is the root of our problem. We make laws to reflect what the People believe. But we have to communicate with each other to come to some consensus. So, thank you for that.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1384882051", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Plus, he's teased that maybe the Face of Boe isn't Capt. Jack at all, it was just a coincidence that Jack was called that.  And I haven't watched Torchwood, but I heard there's an episode where Jack becomes mortal (and I think this episode was even after the Face of Boe reveal, so there are no excuses there). Davies won't even say definitively if Jack is or isn't the Face of Boe.  I'm not even sure he knows.\n\nBut, even if Russell T.

Maybe one day, but I'm not sure how readily we can get to figuring out the mechanics of the Big Bang or how it originated considering there isn't a proper \"before\" to learn from. So I go with natural explanations because so far they've been sufficient.\n\nBut I can also see how a deity could use physical means to create a universe. Which would mean that it's natural and not supernatural. So yeah ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ **edit** aww how do I make the shruggy man work?\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385268096", "subreddit": "changemyview", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

But it's a completely different thing to give someone grief because of the TV they choose to use, especially if you don't know their exact set up, because like I said, there are ways of reducing lag on fancy TVs to a degree in which the lag becomes non-negliable.\n\nSo in closing...\n\nSome of you people need to check yourselves before you wreck yourself lmfao.\n\n\nFor the curious, the device that can upscale older games with no lag on fancy TVs.

{"body": "Ah, EXO. There was so much hype around them when they were first announced/revealed, and I was mildly interested (because of Kai's face, I mean, [look](https://theexostyle.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/teaser2_3of10.jpg) [at](https://theexostyle.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/teaser2_1of10.jpg) [him](https://theexostyle.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/teaser11_4of4.jpg)) initially but got turned off by the gazillion teasers. History came around, and my interest was piqued again, but then... MAMA. I don't know what it is with that song, but I never took to it and even had a mild dislike for it and the whole concept. Their [debut stage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SsUen4jbK8), which frankly just wasn't good, kind of sealed the deal for me there and then... until this year. \n\nThe wolf leak happened, I couldn't believe how ridiculous it sounded, and became borderline obsessed with them *actually promoting* that song with the 'AWOOOO' and terrible lyrics. You know how they say there's a thin line between hate and love? Well it was all downhill from there for me, especially when they released Growl - it's easily my favourite song and MV of this year and probably even one of my top songs/MVs of all time, and I've been listening to kpop since ~2006 - I don't care what anyone says, that song is a goddamn masterpiece to me. (On a sidenote, this [fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYfI-BcDBy8) of Kyungsoo singing 'What is Love' also played a significant role in ensuring that I was a goner.) I still have issues with their lack of live performances and I'm not fond of the fandom, but at this point I kind of have to admit that they've converted me from a skeptic to a believer.\n\nSo there you go, kind of a pointless write-up of how I (after much resistance) got into EXO.

After high school, I spent a year working directly with the homeless, mentally ill, ex convicts, and so forth helping them find work in a society that makes it nearly impossible for those sorts to work ever again.\n\nI went to college in Washington state, started my career, created some books and video games that touched millions of people, though only as a novelty.\n\nAfter I made my money, I came back to Sacramento and now I spend my time running a socially-conscious, employee-friendly software company that makes educational games for children, and doing small amounts of philanthropy in the community as my finances allow.\n\nI'm a husband and a father and I've made sure to instill these values in my children, so that they will also continue to do good in the world after I'm gone.\n\nI'm not Bill Gates or Warren Buffet, but I've tried to do what I can with what I have. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1385762831", "subreddit": "Sacramento", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
