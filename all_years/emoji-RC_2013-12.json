If you are, after already being told to disperse by police, you knew what was coming and you're accepting those risks.\n\nThirdly, you won't be handed a 10-year jail term for \"covering your face\". The act stipulates that the **maximum** sentence possible is ten years (did you know that this law already existed and the only difference was that the max penalty was 5 years?). This means that they *can* sentence you to a 10-year term - not that they *will*. The maximum term is reserved for extreme cases (ie certain Vancouver Stanley Cup riot participants). **Read: this is simply a change to the MAXIMUM penalty, not a mandatory sentence**. \n\nTL;DR: No, go back and read it so you can learn.

Dang she's pretty. Although not the most articulate haha.\n* 50 bucks that **April Carrrrrion** is this season's Ivyyyy Winttuuurs (or w/e). She seems to know what she's talking about, I'm looking forward to seeing more of her. \n* Not so much for **Ben De La Creme** at the moment, hoo boy I hope girl pipes it down a bit. I enjoyed her 'style of drag' &amp; stuff about dad though.\n* **Courtney** is a.... lady. &lt;3_&lt;3 I BET she smells amazing (and that she doesn't poop). But looking amazing better not be this alien's only extraordinary ability! \n* **Jocelyn** is a complete sweetheart, I hope she makes it at least to snatch game! Definitely more appealing than I initially thought so thankfully I don't need to shove it but doesn't have that 'larger than life' quality I'd expect from a winner. \n* **Kelly Mantle** - really funny! really great. Again, I did not really think much of her before but now I can see her becoming one of my all time favs. She can't sew though so I'm not 100% confident about her chances on the show. \n* **Laganja** - I don't have much to say tbh. Dat's some long legs though, oh my.\n* **Magnolia** - I don't think she will go far but I hope they are deceiving us on purpose... She's a fan of Tammie so I hope her drag is similarly out there and interesting! \n* **Milk** - oh my god Milk no, Michelle will hate your guts!!??? ;__; Definitely a frontrunner at the moment. A subtle lip!\n* **Darienne** - as a fat I hope she represents. :P Certainly seems outspoken, I hope she does not get the usual 'lacking in confidence' edit :/\n* **Trinity** - another pleasant surprise, I love queens with deep manly voices. Photos of her I've seen before were not particularly inspiring but she may just turn it out! \n* **Vi Vacious** - Amazing! (and unique in context of the show) I definitely like her drag philosophy. I can see her in the top 3 but I don't think she's got what it takes to appeal to general youth &amp; win a fanvote... \n* **Bianca** - I'm in love, that's it.

I don't talk to anyone about my first love, but I will get it off my chest here, I can't see a better opportunity; I could use a little therapy anyways ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n**Warning that this story is fairly long and not entirely happy:**\n\nFreshman year of high school back around 1999/2000 marching band had just started and my friend talked me into continuing from middle school. I was a tromboner. \n\nI first noticed her standing near a group of girls, laughing and smiling with that little pixie smile she had. Her cute sandy blonde hair was tied up in a pony tail, wearing a black and yellow jersey with jeans. She was always a bit of a tom-boy but that immediately drew me closer.\n\nI noticed she looked over and caught me staring, so like an awkward teen I looked up at the sky pretending I had better things to look at. The second day when we had practice outside we caught each other staring a few times. This progressed over the next few days until I finally found an awkwardly nonchalant chance to come up next to her and say something. It definitely seemed to work, whatever I had said because after that we got closer and closer and found we loved the same things and had the same sense of humor.\n\nThe flirty stuff continued into the school year. She had a boyfriend, I later found out, but they were on shaky ground. There was a lot of fighting and Then she'd be off somewhere alone, upset. All her friends didn't like this guy and she seemed miserable.\n\nOne day after band I was trying to avoid 4th period math so I hid out in the back band room. She was there, was crying a lot. Her boyfriend had another fight with her. She was sitting backwards on a folding chair and I was on the ground in front of her, so I reached up and held her hand.\n\nShe told me it wasn't love if all he does is make her cry. A few days after that she called me at home and asked if I could fill in at work as a temp for someone else. It was there that our first kiss happened, and she broke up with her boyfriend as she had been intending to do since before I came along.\n\nThe rest of the school year went great. We fell in love and couldn't be separated. I shared some of the best memories, even 'til this day, with her and it was a magical year for me. We were in love with how in love we were, so much it made other people sick.\n\nOne of my last, good memories was in that October. Being from Massachusetts, we went to Salem to enjoy the atmosphere. [Orestes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XtG5SGL0Xw) was playing on our cd player as we went down the streets and saw everything in town. That song become one of my all-time favorite songs and still had a lot of meaning for me.\n\nUnfortunately the details get a little fuzzy after this. We had a few more good times but the things that came after made it difficult to recall. \n\nShe called me up one night and briefly explained she was going to Oregon to visit her dad. I was sad she would be gone, but I helped her pack up some stuff and watched from her driveway as her mom drove her to the airport.\n\nI came by once to see her mom, as my g/f hadn't been in contact, I didn't know when she would be home. Her mom seemed kind of cold and just told me she didn't know. \nI got a call from my girlfriend quite a while after she had been gone, out of the blue. She was back in town and  had run away from home. Her mother was furious at her about something, so she needed a place to stay.\n\nI let her stay at our house and that's when she dropped the bomb on me that she was going to live in Oregon. She hated the situation with her mom, being a single mother. That's the reason why her bags were so packed when she first left and she just couldn't tell me.\n\nI couldn't even process the waterfall of emotions rushing down me so I just smiled and said I would make it the best week ever. And I did. We went to the beach, to the Aquarium, sight seeing, I read to her at night,  sang songs for her, had nice dinners and romantic nights, and we ended it all with a few days at my favorite beach where you could park trailers or tents and walk to the beach.\n\nI had one particular boardwalk I had attachments to so I spent most of my time out there, thinking. She kinda left me alone at those times, I think she could tell I was trying to keep it together.\n\nI think one of the things that aided in the sadness of that bittersweet final week with her was that I was reading \" Tuesdays with Morrie \". It kind of put a terminal feeling on the week as if this was her final week alive.\n\nIt was time now to bring her to the airport, and I made sure I saw her off proper. I cracked a few times but I managed to send her off with a smile.\n\nThe following days I was crushed. School vacation started and I was just a miserable mess. We promised to keep in touch but that didn't work so well. I was given a wrong number at first, and when we did manage to talk she seemed totally preoccupied by anything else. Cousins coming in and messing with her, friends calling on other lines, parents interrupting.\n\nEventually she had a talk with me where she basically wanted to end it. She was the type to run from problems and had used cheating as a method to break up with a few guys in the past, but this time she was just really vague with me and I never quite knew where we stood. Time and a lonely space made me bitter and I remember writing her one of those [strongly worded letters.](http://i.imgur.com/AFfjefM.jpg) I'm not sure if she even ever got it.\n\nI never heard from her after that, we went our own ways. I wasn't over her and I had no closure, and from some childhood abuse I had problems with abandonment and attachments so after this I basically became a hermit.\n\nAfter about 10 years I had felt pretty good. I had 2 relationships after that, pretty serious. Well, as serious as online relationships can get. Eventually I came across her by chance and that's how I learned she plays WoW. Excitement washed over like I was 15 all over again and so I reactivated WoW and played with her.\n\nIt was like we didn't skip a beat. At first there was a little testing of the water, but as soon as we realized neither of us had basically changed, we hit it off. It was just friendly stuff at first, but after months of this there were a few things she said that made it seem a little more. I explored that and found she was receptive. \n\nA few days later she drops a secondary bomb on me by telling me she's married. She says that they aren't doing well and might be getting a divorce. I helped her through some of the tougher times, and after we got closer, she eventually told me she had always still loved me.\n\nIt was almost like my life had been on hold up until this point. Once I heard it I booted up like motherfuckin Johnny 5 and I was alive! I had to triple check to make sure I wasn't the reason she was finalizing the divorce, but she had told me that this was merely timing.\n\nI can't believe it. The girl I always thought was the one for me had come back after a decade apart. It's true they say the ones who love you will come back. So I made plans for her to move back here and helped pay for things like the ticket, bought her presents as it was close to christmas, the whole 9 yards. I don't think I've ever been happier or ever will again. That was *the* moment.\n\nAfter a few more weeks she was on her way over. I was so stylin at this point. I had surgery to remove moles on my face and stomach, was in the best shape of my life going from 275 to 200 and my frame of mind, most importantly, was simple and clean.\n\nThe best part about it all was the drive to her mom's new house. I got lost a little bit, as men are who refuse maps, and I am a man as I refused GPS, but I made it. She came out to meet me and we locked ourselves in a hug that was 10 years too late.\n\nI saw her mom again and that was nice, and I finally had a chance to settle down a little and I noticed she was kinda making a funny face. I asked her what's wrong and she said that she was having trouble deciding something. She said she was glad she was back but had also promised her friend Melanie that she would come see her as well. She lived down in Florida.\n\nI had no problem with that, I was just glad she was back. I finally kissed her and that's when I had to ask what was wrong again. She just sat down at the table, looking at it and said \" I don't know. \"\n\nI couldn't quite process it so I sat down too. After an eternity of minutes she told me she just needs to relax and have some time for herself to think things through. This was alarming to me but I heaved a sigh and got up. I told her I'd just leave and she could have all the time she needs. I was only there for 20 minutes.\n\nOn my way down the road I had this sudden rush of something and I called her. I told her that I was turning the car around and that whatever was going on, I couldn't lose her. I was there to fight for her, but before I could turn around she told me no. That it was too late anyways.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386640240", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It wasn't really a sleepover per sae. Me and two mates went to Korea for a holiday. Lets call one of my mates Blondie, he is from South Africa, and the other is from Korea, lets call him BoxeR. The plan was meet up in Hong Kong (Where I lived, other BoxeR and Blondie were living Sydney and Melbourne respectively) then stay in HK for a week then go to Korea for a week. So we get to Korea and everything is dandy. The BoxeR's family live in seoul so he stayed with them some nights while me and Blondie were staying in a hotel room together. The plan was that BoxeR would meet us most days and me and Blondie would work out what we wanted to do in the morning. I wanted to see the GSL and Blondie wanted to visit the border. (BoxeR's family didn't have the room and we didn't really want to stay with them anyway)\n\nWe got drunk a couple of nights, and BoxeR didn't want to go home to his family because they were a bit strict, so he would make up excuses.  Soju, a korean drink is ridiculously cheap and taste's just like Vodka so that was a plus. One night it was too late for BoxeR to go back so he let his mum know that he would stay at our hotel room which we didn't have a issue with. The hotel might have but they didn't say anything. So we get back and get into bed. I have the single on the left, Blondie on the right on a single, and BoxeR on the floor on the far right near the window. \n\n\nI snore, so I let BoxeR and Blondie fall asleep first (they complained while staying at my place). I drift off about an hour later. For some reason I woke up in the middle of the night and I can here this really weird wet squelching noise, to me it sounded just like having a sneaky fap, but I couldn't be sure. Just this really slow wet squelching noise. I heard it once and dismissed it, but it would go off like every couple of seconds. Squeeeeeeeelch.................Squeeeeeelch........Just like that, like playing with fart goop.\n\n\nIt's at this time that Blondie wakes up and I noticed. I role over to face him and say 'Hey Blondie, can you hear that noise?' He is like 'What noise?'. The Squelch goes off. 'That noise.' He just says 'What the fuck!'. I'm trying to work out whats going on and I say 'I think BoxeR is having a wank'. It was the only reasonable explanation, because we and Blondie both had our hands above the blankets. BoxeR didn't have a retainer or anything, he didn't snore nor did he make any noise when sleeping usually. He had a jacket over him at the time if I recall, so we couldn't really tell. We have a quite chuckle too ourselves in the midst of being completely grossed out. Me and Blondie ponder for a moment and I have a feeling just reached the same conclusion, and tried to fall back asleep, but everytime the squelch would go off we would both cringe. Eventually it stopped and we fell asleep.\n\nA couple of days later BoxeR stayed over again after another night of shenanigans. This time we were a bit drunker so we fell asleep pretty quickly, but the same thing happened. Me and Blondie both knew it wasn't each other, we are quite close so we would have owned up about it haha. We both woke up again, and this time it was kind of louder. Blondie rolled over, and I got out of bed and we crept over to watch BoxeR to see what was going on. We couldn't see his hands but he just looked like he was sleeping, maybe he caught on that we were on to him. Regardless we had no proof.\n\nThe next day we somehow managed to get on the topic of pleasuring yourself, and I think it was me who blurted it out. 'BoxerR were you...you know....having a wank last night?' IMMEDIATELY He was like 'OH MY GOD NO WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT' and Blondie replied 'Well we heard squelching noises last night again, and me and Chanyman were both awake so we knew it wasn't us.' BoxeR said 'I didn't hear anything, why would you think it was me?' I said 'Well who else could it be?' BoxeR replies 'Well it wasn't me, no way come on haha'. We both knew it was him but we weren't going to get it out of him. Just glad he wasn't there all the time! It was cold at the time so maybe he disguised it as snow or something, I don't know, alls I know is it sounded exactly like having a wank, and it wasn't me or Blondie. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nTL;DR: Went to korea with two mates. One mate and I were sharing room, other had family. Got drunk a couple of nights, guy with family stayed in our room. Squelching noise in middle of the night, was not me or the guy I stayed with as he heard it and we woke up at the same time.

{"body": "Thyroidectomy and 'neck dissection'. \n\nHad 'exploratory' surgery in 2005 when I was 14 to determine if the tumor my pediatrician found at the base of my throat was cancerous. It was, so they removed that, a shit ton of lymph nodes, and my thyroid. Not sure why they didn't just do a biopsy instead of a full surgery, but it worked out better this way anyway. I actually didn't find out I had cancer until after the surgery. Yay! \n\nFast forward 7 years and the cancer comes back AND spreads. So I have Radioactive Iodine a third time, maxing out how much I can have in my lifetime (or so my doctor thinks, they haven't fully decided this yet). Anywho, RAI doesn't kill all the cancer inside of me, though it has stopped growing. So she decides that we should remove what we can surgically, and I find myself back in the hospital 8 years and 5 months after my initial surgery. This time it's called a 'neck dissection', which doesn't sound as impressive. It just sounds... creepy. Like I'm a frog in a biology class. \n\nI hopefully won't need anymore surgery. The rest of the cancer is in my lung (don't worry, I'm not -- I'm asymptomatic, it's very slow growing, and seems to have stopped for now) and it would be very difficult to remove surgically, maybe impossible (I'm not a doctor, it probably can be done but my doctor hated the thought of that). We're trying to get my calcium and vitamin D levels under control (perpetually low, I'm a terrible person who just can't seem to stay on track of my medication ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ) and then we'll test in a couple of months to see if all the cancer in my throat was hacked out. After that we'll tackle the lung. \n\nTLDR: Tumor, nodules, and lymph nodes taken from ma neck yo\n(also, I'm really fucking sick of having cancer but it feels good to talk about my experience)\n\nEdit: yes something went wrong with my first surgery. It's a common issue, but they took out the glands that control calcium functioning in my body as well. So I have 'hypoparathyroidism' and even when I'm on high calcium and vitamin D doses I just can't seem to keep my head above water. I actually JUST GOOGLED IT for the first time and I guess only 7% of people suffer from it permanently and well, that seems to be the trend for me. My hands and fingers and face were like, paralyzed after surgery. It was CRAZY. I couldn't move them at all. \n\nOh yeah, I also have vocal chord damage from my first surgery. I'm actually a pretty good singer, which my latest surgeon said was almost impossible due to the damage he discovered. As in, the right side of my vocal chords don't do a damn thing at all. \n\nJust for the record, it's somewhat rare for there to be patients under the age of 20 with papillary thyroid cancer, it's rare for them to have permanent hypoparathyroidism, and it's rare for thyroid cancer to not only come back (30% chance, so maybe not all that rare) BUT SPREAD TOO. Yay me!!!! \n\nI've honestly got a really good chance at living a long, healthy life. Kidney problems are a possibility. Probably osteoporosis too. Yay me!!! \n\nHonestly I've been reading some other cancer forums and while I really hate that people are all like, \"You have the GOOD cancer\", I would rather have this than a different form. I don't have to have chemo, after all! And I think having any type of cancer has been good for me in the sense that it made me realize my mortality at a young age. It makes me want to be more stable. \n\nThis veered off topic. Sorry about that! ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1386734152", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Characters (both female AND male) are some of the most harshly critiqued art out there. They are given praise or condemned based purely on appearance and peoples personal tastes. Something can be pleasing to one person and to another have the exact opposite response. It's what we do as humans. We judge. We judge a lot. Holy shit do we judge a lot. You rarely see environmental art, like trees and flowers, judged this same way (unless you're Georgia O'Keefe). Some of the most popular scenery painting can be some of the most mundane and run of the mill (Thomas Kincaid pun intended) . It's very traditional, but it sells a lot, and people like it. I've asked why people like those paintings, and they have said that it's because a tree looks like a tree. I get it. it's not my personal taste, but I get it. \n\nArt in general is a risky business because it is judged so subjectively by whatever societal norms are in place.

This happens when people over emphasize traits under the assumption that they're adhering to their \"roots\" or \"traditions\" as a form of retaining their previous culture (See: US \"Italians\" vs. Actual Italians, US \"Irish\" vs. Actual Irish, US \"African AMericans\" vs. Actual West Africans, etc. etc. etc.)\n\nSometimes the stereotypes are nice, sometimes they manifest in obnoxious ways (such as your ass hole acquaintance.) but that's a clash of culture. You may come from a culture that emphasizes giving as good (and holy?) and he may come from a culture that's been forced to fight for its survival in seemingly every place its gone (largely by alienating it self from the local populace thus stoking mankind's natural fears of the unknown). ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Or I could be full of shit and just another random voice on the internet", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1387044122", "subreddit": "self", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This is also a false equivalence because the poster itself is not in line with the views held by the majority of people in society, as cisnormitivity and heteronormitivity are, while on top of that it doesn't imply at all that only men can be rapists, or that only women can be raped.\n\n1. \"[the poster] ]doesn't imply at all that only men can be rapists, or that only women can be raped\"\n\nThe thing you should understand is the poster was not the focus of my post, nor was it the focus of the SRS circlejerkers. The SRSers were not making jokes about how the TwoX redditor failed to read the poster, they were joking about both acknowledging male rape victims in TwoX, and the rarity of female on male rape (something ironically that can't be inferred from the TwoX redditors post because like the poster it does not explicitly point out victim/perpetrator parties).\n\n2. \"the poster itself is not in line with the views held by the majority of people in society\".\n\nI disagree, the majority of people in society see rape as a male on female issue. By gendering the victim in several statements and leaving the others implicit, it is very much in line with the world view of rape as something that happens to women. Victim blaming is not the focus here, just as it was not the focus of the TwoX redditor.\n\n3. they've created a false dichotomy\n\nI acknowledge that a false dichotomy is possible, i.e. that SRS could be both hyper sensitive and dismissive of male rape with some kind of auxiliary argument.

We can't stop now! The next episode has crabs in it!!! I LOVE crabs!\" :P\n\nI MISS the ocean. :( I used to live on the Gulf Coast. Granted it wasn't the prettiest water and we didn't really have a beach (after hurricane Ike they got a real sand beach. Before it was a parking lot and a pier. The closest sand beach was 15 minutes away in the back of a neighborhood near a port. It was always covered in either giant dead fish or oil :'( .), but I loved being near the water. I used to get off of my night shift and eat breakfast while watching the sun rise over the bay. My favorite days were stormy. You could see the lighting over the water for what seemed like forever. I can't wait to live near that again. :)\n\nMy favorite vacations were the ones my family took to New Braunfels Texas. We'd stay for like 2 weeks and tube the rivers. We had a travel trailer and since we went every year we became friends with a trailer park owner. His camp was right on the water. When we weren't out and about I would snorkel the river and find neat rocks and snail shells. :D At night the owner would have a fire at the picnic area and play Tom Petty songs. lol I'd love to go back some day, but I don't know if I want to mess with that memory. You know? I know the rivers were drying up more and more every year and as more people visited the area started to become a tourist trap.  :/\n\nOne day I want to go to the UK for a bit. I have a friend out there I need to see. She was supposed to come down this summer, but she had some medical stuff that needed to be taken care of. :( Then there's another friend I need to meet one of these days. (I'm looking at you Matt if you're reading this. :P) Aside from that I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to find a nice white sand beach with hardly any people around, crystal clear water, and just be. Definitely want to snorkel, but more I just want to find somewhere quiet and pretty to relax.\n\nMaybe I will try skydiving one day. In the future. lol ;)\n\nYAY!

{"body": "Right then. Here we go.\n\nRound I: I feel like the Others can win this, because the Wrecking Crew heavily relies on brute force in my opinion. I think if the Others play this smart, and work together well, they can easily have this. Kahina (who can see the future to a certain degree) could expect their major moves, Prisoner of War could push them back and crowdcontrol them with his forcefields, and the others could take them out from behind.\n\nRound II goes to the Suicide Squad in my opinion, simply because Deathstroke (and some others, Bane, Red Hood) are amazing tacticians/strategists and they have a big number of soldiers (60) to their access. Don't think they plan to make the soldiers survive this, but this will turn the aid of the battle in their favor I think. I think all soldiers of ARGUS will die and around 3/4 'heroes' remain, who will be quickly finished off by the Suicide Squad.\n\nRound III goes to Miguel in my opinion, because Spider-Man would be superior to Batman if not for his intellect/experience, which Terry, despite being very good, lacks from Bruce.\n\nRound IV... is tough. Superman would quickly fight with Thor, where-as Green Hornet, Arrow, and V face off against Black Widow, Hawkeye (who will get owned by Olly, just saying) and the Falcon. Batman will face off with Cap, which I think will be a very close battle, and Green Lantern will have to fight off both War Machine and Iron Man. He won't be able to defeat them easily, but I think he will be able to hold them back fairly easily. John Constantine will face off against Hulk. I think he will be able to keep up a rather good fight but in the end get killed. Supes will be able to take movie-Thor not easily, but he will be able to take him and despite being wounded, he will be able to assist Green Lantern in taking down Iron and War. By now, Hornet's dead and V is very wounded but so are Black Widow, Hawkeye and Falcon. Captain America has beaten Batman, but is knocked out and very wounded himself. This leaves Super, Lantern, and Arrow versus Hulk. Odds are that Arrow will distract Hulk, and run from him, maybe die in the process (but probably not) and Green Lantern will trap him into a construct until he turns back into Banner. Then Supes will probably finish him. Tough battle for both sides!\n\nRound V: Tough battle, I think, and many mutants will die but in the end I think (mainly because of Wolverine) they will be able to overcome the Watchleague (because words are long) and.. yeah. I don't think Spidey will be a tidebreaker in this battle, but that he will work in the favor the X-Men. Cyclops will probably take quite some people (The Owl, Nemo, Allan) with him to the grave and let's be honest: EVERYONE wants to see Ozymandias vs Wolverine, despite the victor already obvious..\n\nRound VI: I think the Rogues will quickly gain the overhand in this battle, causing the Superiors and Sinisters to team up, and despite them taking out quite a bit of the Rogues, I think they will still come out of top (with 1-2 survivors, probably)\n\nRound VII: Oooh... I think the weakest heroes to take them down would be the Teen Titans and Young Justice together, where-as the strongest person he can take down would be either Flash, Bats or Green Lantern (depending on the incarnation). That said, the 3 of them working together would own. If the Dr Magneto would've had prep time, discovered Nth Metal and such, he would've probably ended up destroying half the DC Universe. I can totally see him recruiting a squad of high-end mercenaries and sieging Thermysica, and succeeding even, maybe.\n\nRound VIII. I think that Sentry, Captain America 2099 (Cap with Mjolnir) Magneto and Wonder-Woman may be able to overpower him and fight him. And I mean a single Altron. I think the combined forces of Justice League, Justice League Beyond, the Avengers, New Avengers and Secret Avengers will be needed to maybe take the 5 Altron's down. With lots of casualties on their side. And a ruined city.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I can already see the Punisher and Batman, back-to-back, Punisher in his exo-suit and the Dark Knight in the one from TDKR. It would be an awesome battle. \n\nRound IX: I think this is a very very fun and interesting battle. Nobody and Knightfall would face off against Rachel and Paladin, Mirror and Legacy will face Druid, Road Rage will face Superior Spidey, and William Cobb and Spark will fight off Black Cat and Bullseye, with Taskmaster helping out where he is needed after swiftly defeating Grifter (not swiftly, but not with much effort either) he will first be needed in the fight of Nobody and Knightfall, making them win the battle and say bye to Rachel aswell. Road Rage will be 'trapped' in webs by Superior, immobilizing but not defeating them. Mirror and Legacy will be held off by Druid for a rather long time, until someone that has already fought his nemesis comes to help him. The other battles will go as they go, and in the end Superior's team will come out on top, with once more, little survivors. I think Taskmaster, Superior and Druid will survive this battle.\n\nRound X: RIGHT. RAGNAROK. APOCALYPSE. **DOOOOOM** So, for this battle I will call upon Venompool, who will be persuaded to help them for some amazing costs that Richard and Lex will never be able to pay up, but they decide to pay that later. Also we'll be seeing Iron Xavier, from another earth, which is basically Iron Man's suit with Charles Xavier, younger and more fit, in it. This suit also has the utility of a portable, slightly weaker, Cerebro. That said, they will recruit almost all the multiverse's heroes who will all find dead rather swiftly. Can you imagine a pile of Green Arrow corpses? I can. And if the Wonder Woman corpses are still warm.. *ahem* back to the point. Venompool, with Mjolnir and Cap's shield, will put up a good fight but will find death aswell, HOWEVER he will allow Iron Xavier time to enter their minds. This isn't a battle that can be fought with force, this is a battle that can only be fought by conversing. Charles will force them into the Phantom Zone/Negative Zone, and Reed or someone else will shut it off once and for all. \n\nBonus Round: I think that the Asgardians will lose this battle in the end, but that it will be a long and painful fight. The average Asgardian will lose from an Amazon for they are more trained for battle, despite the genetic structure of Asgardian's being better. Now add that the Asgardian's have better technology and the fight will be even. The Lantern Corpses will be a huge advantage for the Amazons, especially in numbers, and despite the battle being long and bloody, Amazons have it.\n\nSo yeah. My 2 cents on this.

I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong!)\n\n~~The ^ symbol stands for the shift key. The 3 is the key you're pressing along with the shift. So ^3 is \"shift  + 3\". The stuff after the :: is what you want it to do when that hotkey combo is pressed. If you're just wanting a certain text to be entered, you just type that in.~~\n\nThe following is close to what you want: \n\n    Numpad3::#\n\nThis will replace the pressing of the 3 on your ten-key with a #. The complete list of modifiers is [here](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm) (so that it will only replace if you press 'shift') but I'm having setbacks making it work. Will update soon.\n\nYou can also use this same method to correct typos you make really often. Say you always misspell \"their\" as \"thier\". You can just add a line to your .ahk that says\n\n    thier :: their\n\nIt will always replace any time you type 'thier' with 'their'. \n\nThis can be kind of fun for fancy emoticons that you would like to use often! Just pick a keyword for it, e.g.\n\n    confetti :: (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ✧･ﾟ:*✧･ﾟ:*\n\nand leave the script running all the time and you can just type your keyword to get the emoticon automagically.
