{"body": "I finally got around reading Velleman's paper.  Thanks for the link!  I guess it seems that he's imagining or emphasizing a specific situation, which is that: \n\n&gt;a patient's decision to die will sometimes be a gift or a favor bestowed on loved ones whose financial or emotional resources are being drained by his condition\n\nand thus there may be pressure on the patient to choose death if the option is available, or have to justify to himself or others that the rest of his life is worth living.  More basically, it is the scenario of a severely ill or old patient who is costing the rest of his family money or an emotional toll.  I guess it is using this societal context that Velleman is advocating his position.  Financially, in a society where healthcare is a lot more subsidized (so that the financial cost on the rest of the family is minimal or even 0), we can unburden the patient in that aspect.  Emotionally, it's hard to imagine a family putting pressure on a dying relative by saying that the emotional cost on them is too much so why don't you go die now and make it easier for the rest of us, but I can imagine something like \"if this pain is too much for you, you can choose to go on your own terms, too, grampa (P.S. I want the inheritance now before you change your mind you old bastard).\"  If the objective is to protect that patient who is ill and feels explicit or implicit pressure from his relatives, I can totally see Velleman's point.  In my mind, though, I keep wanting to go back to what I was saying, which is that we should frame the \"party invitation\" so that it is always out there for anyone BUT it is not really a party invitation but rather an invitation to a job interview.  To pass the job interview, you need to show that you are of sound mind, blablabla... kind of like how executing a prisoner takes years of administrative work (in the U.S.) for whatever legal reasons I don't know of.  The option of euthanasia could be available for everyone but not easy to do.  Administratively and legally, it could be made to be almost a hassle so that only those who really want it and can show that the patient really wants it can get it.  Just like how in a normal court case situation a person relies on his lawyer to do the paperwork, a euthanasia can be so legally demanding that most people have to hire a lawyer to help him through all the procedures.

{"body": "FYI Not even MLS analyst understand MLS rules. But as far as my understanding is we dont have clubs that join a association/league via promotion, we have a franchises that sales teams. Its like if someone paid LigaMX money so they can allow them to start another team instead of being promoted. Also in MLS all players are owned by MLS and the teams/franchise are own by the person that paid for it, the franchise owner pretty much just owns the name and stadium but MLS provides the players. \n\nOf course the franchise owners have a say who they want and dont want as long as combine salaries are kept under a certain amount which is what we call a salary cap but only three players are allowed to be placed outside this cap. This allows franchises to bid for the rights of better quality players i.e. Defoe. Big name players are also given other rules to lure them into the league like letting them choose the team they want to play with. Mostly all other players trying to join the league sign a contract with MLS and franchises chooses players via a draft or team taking turn picking players. The thought process behind is to avoid creating dominant team and give every team an opportunity to win the MLS cup. IMO there a pro and cons to this the pro is that it allows franchises to compete at the same level so each have a chance at the MLS cup, get revenue from share money, another funny rule, to build training facilities and stadiums. The down side is the level of play is mediocre and only big cities i.e. LA, NY or Miami get chosen to host a franchise. If I was the king of MLS I would do things a bit different but I am not and the only live football I can see on a regular bases is LA Galaxy so that why I follow MLS ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nWhat happened with Camilo is that  when a player signs under contract with MLS for 1 year MLS has the option to extend it to two years. Which is illegal BTW and LigaMX has been also known for doing this. So Camilo went to Queretaro because his year was over but Vancouver wanted to use their option to extend their contract with him so thats why they still claim they own him.  \n\nTL;DR MLS owns the players and franchise owns the name of a team\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1389722027", "subreddit": "LigaMX", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "From the KnowYourMeme link (so people don't have to chase links):\n\n&gt;FrankerZ is a dog face emoticon used to convey sarcasm or playfulness in chat rooms on the video game broadcasting site TwitchTV.[13] The image is sometimes spammed in forums and chat rooms during raids, in a similar vein to both “desu” and “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” .\n\n**Origin**\n\n&gt;According to the now-defunct website TwitchTVFaces,[8] the TwitchTV streamer Ernest Le[6] would sometimes speak in a different voice while referring to himself as “Frankerz,” which led a TwitchTV staff member to add the FrankerZ emoticon using a photograph of Le’s dog.[7][9] The earliest known mention of the dog face icon was featured in a blog post about TwitchTV emoticons by gamer Ashe Soriano[10] on January 31st, 2012.\n\n&gt;On October 11th, 2012, a Facebook[4] page titled “FrankerZ” was launched. On October 30th, the domain for the website FrankerZ[2] was registered, which displays a page announcing that the website will launch sometime in 2013 (shown below).\n\n(image not available)\n\n&gt;On November 28th, Soundcloud user MarkSoupial uploaded \"Marathon Anthem 2012 (Apocalypse 2012 Edit),” which featured an electronic dance song accompanied by a vocal track repeating the phrase “FrankerZ” (shown below).\n\n(image not available)\n\nOn January 5th, 2013, the /r/FrankerZ[3] subreddit was created.

{"body": "DS9 is also my favorite series, but I think your friend erred in starting you off with it. A large part of what makes DS9 great is that it is essentially a deconstruction of Star Trek. Where TOS and TNG are based on the innate goodness of humanity and the ultimate triumph of rationality and justice, DS9 takes the same ideals and explores how they play out in a system that's inherently unjust. \n\nKirk's response to the Kobayashi Maru - \"I don't believe in no-win scenarios\" - could be a metaphor for pre-DS9 Trek. When Kirk or Picard are forced to choose between two bad options, they demand a third solution. And someone finds it! The lesson is, never compromise your ideals. When Sisko is forced to choose between two bad options, in comparison, there is no third solution; the choice is what decision he can live with. But despite all that, the core message is the same: people are good. People will do what is right, when it really comes down to it, even if they're unhappy about it or conflicted. It's a messier optimism than earlier Star Trek, but, I think, ultimately easier to accept, because we can identify with characters who are fallible.\n\nDeep Space Nine.

найти, а Я знаю, что есть некоторые люди, которые любят шоу или игры, и это может быть детски, но я хотел, чтобы по какой-то причине, что им пытаются добраться до в том, что Бен 10 игры все были не только одинаковые, но они сделали это хуже, им тип игрока, который любит игры Basiclly им pasionate для игр и других материал, но это меня бесит, когда они разрушают игру, которая ooses потенциал и быть честными они перепутались с Бен 10, что я хочу сказать, что парень с возможностью превратиться в каждое существо в любой вселенной идея экстремального потенциал и Ive Готт тонны идей о том, как сделать его лучше, но, видимо компании является упрямым слушать свежих идей компании до сих пор не понимаю концепцию создание игр вызвать делать игры больше создания мира, чтобы развлечь других, чтобы человек могут попробовать себя на некоторое время взгляд им только напишу мои идеи, чтобы увидеть, если вы хотели, если вы не делаете nufsaid но если вы пытаетесь помочь мне заставить их слушать разуму причина сегодня компании intrest находится на прибыль хорошо, поэтому моя идея переделать Бен 10 Omniverse сохраняя тот же символов bringuing назад несколько злодеев, выглядят наиболее ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) O Бен 10 игр beatemup игры и сегодня мы можем превратить его в свободный бродят песочнице игре вы guive миссий, побочных миссий, дополнительные материалы, и проблемы Хорошим примером может быть Бэтмен Arkahm Город много побочных миссий и проблемы с плюс дополнительные предметы коллекционирования с, но игроки должны большую награду, если бы Бен получает каждый коллекционный в городе он guets новый и очень прохладно иностранца в его Omnitrix или дополнительные технологии для обновления или новые полномочия или обновлений для своих иностранцев, и получите бесплатную бродят песочнице сделать его как Assassins Creed, что вы бегать города, но если вы хотите ехать в другой город, то вы идете через контрольно-пропускной пункт, но в новой Бен своей то же самое с городами Зависит, что если вы хотите пойти на другую планету вы действительно идете в контрольно-пропускном пункте, но при перемещении в другой планете, как в Kingdom Hearts, теперь на полномочия и все мы Теперь Бен использует свой Omnitrix превратиться в все его иностранцам А как насчет начать только десять, но guive его на протяжении всей истории, и побочных миссий все другие, которые он когда-либо превратился в, ну, пока их не бесполезно, и позволить ему использовать QUIK SELCT как возмущаются те, но вернуть использованием Омнитрикса как нажать кнопку и Омнитрикса появляется на экране, и вы можете вращать баре Omnitrix проверки Wich тот, который вы хотите использовать, теперь на полномочия и лично мне нравится боевая стиле прототипа причина для меня половина удовольствия было выбрать то, что было бороться, а в новом Бен 10 выбор части является чужеродным вы хотите использовать, но он борьбу я хочу чтобы вы чувствовали себя пересилил, сделав вам победить армию Youre собственные снимая сотни enmies но хорошая игра не может быть прогулка в парке так каждый иностранец имеет слабость enemie поэтому каждый будет иметь то, что может полностью нейтрализовать чужеродные, что таким образом вы будете превращаться в другой, но вы все равно можете продолжать борьбу с той же самой, но Itll быть намного более трудно победить Также я хотел бы использовать великих держав, в прототипе, а не хромой комбо, которые даже не позволяют делать потрясающие вещи, и некоторые иностранцы имеют специальные навыки, как серое вещество может попасть в любую машину или робот, чтобы управлять машиной, или Wildmutt может вынюхивать скрытые объекты, технологии, предметы коллекционирования или как обновление, что он может обладать любой машине, и он может обновить их с ракетами или шипами или возможность сделать автомобиль или ездить летом на стена, которая была бы безумным и в конце игры, как сделать в Kingdom Hearts на одной из PSP в Wich после окончания они положили почти невозможно бои Agains сильных боссов в конечном счете, и я, очевидно, вы выиграете вы получите окончательную цену как пришелец , которая не appeard на шоу еще, но это еще не мой выбор вывода и Ive были жалобы от друга, который хочет использовать Alien X А как насчет guiving Бен в часть истории власти бар, что Asmuth сделал, как обновление для Omnitrix который позволяет Вы используете не только чужеродные X, но в полной мере потенциал всех иностранцев, как обновление может обладать любой машине, но с властью баре можно не только зарядиться энергией Omnitrix но вы также можете обладать огромной машины, как полная судов O для ясности: возложите каждый ALIEN даже большой путь в местах, которые он подходит O и добавить врагов, как большой, как путь Большой и закончить это пытаются сделать историю как война между видами в огромных полях сражений делает Бен борьбы в войнах и городов хорошо вот и все Ив добрался, я надеюсь, вам понравится мои идеи так мольбы, если вы думаете, что его стоит Youre время помочь мне сделать

It's really not rocket surgery to pick up a card that's undervalued... especially when it's 50-75-95% off.  I was obviously confident picking up Master of Waves, Nightveil Specter, Humility, Living End, Chord of Calling, and Dark Confidant at those prices... and not as confident with the others.  Indeed, looking back, most of my purchases were of cards I had already considered; those threads were juuuust enough to convince me to pull the trigger. \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Some comments, in retrospect*\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **(i.) Nightveil Specter, Master of Waves, Living End = CHEAP BIG WINNERS** \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not much to say about this: I bought very low, and sold very high.  Sometimes it is that easy.  Do your research, plan accordingly, and jump on a favorably cheap bet with a huge upside before it's too late.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **(ii.) Dark Confidant/PROMO Foil, Chord of Calling = (BIG) WINNERS**\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I built upon these online orders locally, so it worked eeeeeven better.  MMA DC demand proved to be incredible (even SCG was buying DC at $50), so buying copies around that buylist price and offering locals $40-50 in cash or trade was an easy decision.  Same story with Chord: a slightly higher buy-in for an impulse purchase, but I already played Pod, so it seemed like an easy decision in preparation for the Modern Season(s).\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **(iii.) Humility, Dream Halls, Sword of Feast and Famine, Coalition Relic = SLIGHT WIN/CURRENT WASH**\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Looked like a buyout, was skeptical, but like all of these impulse buys, I bought in at what the card was valued ***before*** the price started to rise, so it doesn't bother me.  My only \"regret\" was not already owning more foils of the card.\n\n* **What is my selling/holding strategy?  \"┬─┬﻿ ノ( ゜-゜ノ) Patience, young grasshopper...\"**  Consider the short/long-term demand: Is this card's price still rising?  Is the demand real?  Should I hold even if the price dips?  Does this card place results?  Is anyone actually buying the card I have listed, even if I'm the lowest price on the internet?  Have you bought out enough to convince others that your Trinket Mage/Didgeridoo deck is the real deal?  People joke and shit on the early Didgeridoo buyout, but I'm glad I became aware and picked up copies locally for cheap, and it's maintained well-above its $0.40 price.\n\n* **Was this reeeeeally a good decision?  \"(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻? ABANDON SHIP!\"**  I love flipping for high profits, but I'm fine only making a few dollars off a purchase.  The cycle will repeat itself, in time.  It's important to recognize when you can be one of the earliest to jump off a sinking ship.  It's better to lose a few bucks on a higher-price spec than to be left with a card that continues to lose value (or just has no positive outlook in sight).  Remember: Pay attention when a card is falling; you can potentially buy in later at a lower price (or the same price) if you think the situation's changed or you like the card long term.  If you bought the latest hot mythic on the rise at $16.00 when expecting it to rise to $25 or $50, and it doesn't, it's easier to to sell at $22-15, cut your losses, and jump back aboard when the prices plummet.  They usually do.\n\n* **When should I celebrate? \"(/ .□.)\\ ︵╰(゜Д゜)╯︵ /(.□. \\) VICTORY!\"** Again, favor the winners.  Savor your cardboard victories, whether big or small.  Recognize your losses, and learn from them.  Sometime's you'll get lucky and be at the right place at the right time, but unless you like paying to move pieces of sand from one hourglass to another, it's much better to save up your money and push deeper into a \"solid\" spec than frivolously buying into hype you haven't already researched.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**1. Buy low**\n\n**2. Sell high**\n\n**3. Do your research**\n\n**4. ???**\n\n**5. Profit**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1390935053", "subreddit": "mtgfinance", "score": 6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'm confused about your position. \n\nYou are saying that in the event of an accidental pregnancy that the woman has the right to decide the lives of *three* people with impunity because of biology. Right? And that societal inequity plays no part in any of this. \n\nSo then we have two outcomes from this. \n\nShe decides to have the baby and while that decision is hers alone the man automatically is required to alter the course of his life even though he said no. \n\nOr \n\nShe considers the fathers refusal to be a parent and decides to abort. Problem solved. \n\nNow you bring up biology like that is what governs who gets what rights, conflating social norms with biological ones. Biologically we have sex for procreation, that is pretty much it. However this has changed in modern times because contraceptives up to and including abortion allow us to have sex as a form of recreation, with no thoughts of procreating. The contraceptives we have are not %100, mostly due to human error. \n\nA man and a woman have sex with no intention to procreate, a condom breaks and the woman missed taking one of her pills. She is now pregnant. A conversation takes place where the man sticks to his position and says he is not ready to be a parent and does not want to keep the child. \n\nNow even though their sexual encounter was recreational you're saying that biologically she has total control over the decision to abort or not. I can agree with this, it's her body that will undergo the physical strains of bearing a child. A biological matter. \n\nShe decides to keep the baby but cannot support it on her own and in this situation we have arbitrarily imposed laws saying that the man is responsible for a child he doesn't want and had no intention of creating but is now bound because of her choice after the fact. \n\nThis child is a byproduct of *recreational* sex, not sex for procreation. \n\nThe mother has even one more right above the fathers where she can abdicate her responsibility and put the child up for adoption which is fair, if you cannot morally bring yourself to abort your pregnancy but are willing to go through the physical strain of childbirth this is the next best option so the kid can have the chance at a normal life. \n\nThe father has *none* of these. Not one. Not even the simple right to walk away from an accident resulting from recreational sex. Even in a society that has moved beyond the biological limitations of pregnancy, we cannot give even the semblance of equal choice to both parties?   \n\n*Why?* \n\nExplain that to me and I want something more than, \n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\"Biology, man!\"\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1391065703", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oo. Great question! You asked specifically about finding flow, so I'm going to jump on this sliver of your question. If I'm off base, please let me know if it's not quite the rant you were hoping for.\n\nI'm rreeealllly particular about the tools I use. But maybe not in the way you'd expect. I have tool commitment issues when it comes to personal productivity. I get worried about committing all of my thinking into one tool in case it stops working for some reason. Maybe it's a service that shuts down; maybe it's a local tool which doesn't have a backup and one day I wake up and all my data is missing; maybe it's...I can think of a hundred reasons why I don't like committing to a tool. AND THEN if someone tells me I \"am required to\" use a tool. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ \"NO BODY puts Baby in the corner!\"\n\nSo I've adopted a system somewhat akin to the double record keeping you hear about long haul truckers using. I keep one set of records for myself. And then double-enter the data into a second system for whatever is required of me for work. This allows me to sort for myself, but format for others. Thinking twice about the problem actually helps me to clarify what the problem is, and sometimes I just get bored of shuffling a TODO into yet another space, so I just do the freaking thing. And other times I realize I've been shuffling this one item for days, if not weeks and I take the time to question if it might not actually be a priority. It's been a great life lesson for me to know that I don't have to do things someone else's way AND that my relationships will improve if I ALSO format/present things according to the other person's preference. In short: we can all be right so long as we have a core understanding and respect for one another.

Just a grab a magazine, tear out sexy picture, defile it, rinse and repeat. Literally thousands upon thousands of pages.. all the hottest female celebrities, etc. No cost. Easy cleanup. My favorite are the perfume ads. Because you can even smell the bitch you're about to defile. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Monday: Taylor Swift in a miniskirt. Tuesday: Jennifer Lawrence's cleavage. Wednesday: Charlize Theron's legs. You get the picture. Either way, it sure beats a tissue. Or a sock. Or seven year old boxers.
