{"body": "Actually, I'm going to revise what I said earlier:\n\nThe difference between these examples and Jesus is significant. The Loch Ness Monster is the easiest one to examine, because the Loch Ness is a fairly limited realm. Just as I can objectively prove a negative with limited scope (that there are no pennies in my left pocket) I can \"prove\" in any but the strictest sense of the word that the Loch Ness Monster doesn't exist. Unicorns, Big Foot, and faeries are progressively harder, given the possible scope limitations we could impose (or lack thereof).\n\nOn the other hand, we can't examine 2000 years ago. Even though the scope is fairly limited - say, within 100 years - we don't have access to it in the way that we have access to the Loch Ness.\n\nSo they're different. I'd say you can prove (again, in most senses) that there is no Loch Ness Monster *far more strongly* than you can prove that there are no faeries. And Jesus is further down the line.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1230347862", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I could replace \"loch ness monster\" with Krishna, Buddha, or invisible pink unicorns. I was just showing what his argument was. Yes, you could say all you want \"you can't disprove the loch ness monster (or Jesus)\", and you would be right.\n\nBut, I want to get across that *reasonable* assumptions are not bad, and even necessary. For example, if a friend came to my house and said \"A guy named Bob lives down the street\". I would believe him, because it is not unreasonable. If he continued to claim that Bob was a cult leader, I would ask for evidence because that is much more unreasonable. \n\nSo let's take a more important question, how do you know you exist? How can you know that this not a computer simulation, or a dream? Well, I haven't seen anyone answer this question without any uncertainty, so the most you can say is, \"we don't know\". But that doesn't really work in the world, and acts are often made on the assumption that world is real, that you exist. It isn't crazy to have an unfounded assumption, but it is important to realize whether it is reasonable or not. \n\nSo when we apply this philosophy to historical figures, I believe they do not exist, unless evidence is there to support it. I do not believe that Romulus existed, just because there are stories. But, I believe Julius Caesar existed, because there are extensive documents and a large bibliography about him. While this could be a large fake conspiracy, it is more reasonable to believe that Caesar existed than a grand conspiracy. \n\nSo, when you tell me Jesus existed, when no other evidence exists other than the religious texts, and no historian even mentioned him, despite the large number of historians living around the Mediterranean during the time of Jesus. Although, in fairness there are four historians that are cited by modern Christian defenders. The major historian that is frequently cited is Josephus, but that is considered a fake, even by people in the Catholic church. The other three, like Tactitus, only mention the Christ, Christus, or Chrestus, which is a title and not a name, which was held by many people. But even if they were talking about Jesus, it is only mentioned in passing. You would think a major historical figure like Jesus would take up more than a passsing comment. Plus you take into account that the story of Horus is almost exactly like Jesus, and it seems reasonable to believe that Jesus did not exist.\n\nEDIT: You gave a very though provoking comment nevertheless, so I hope there is no animosity between us even though I disagree with you (it is the internet afterall)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1230399285", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, this is one of the things that annoys me about mainstream atheism. God is not equivalent to Santa Claus, because Santa Claus is mythology/superstition while God is construct of mind.\n\nThe God concept is the belief that the universe derives from absolute principles that determine its existence, morality, its meaning, etc. The end of one's God concept (\"God is dead\") is an existential crisis that removes the apparent rationality of ones' being.\n\nSanta Claus, on the other hand, is like a unicorn, palm-reading, or the loch ness monster. One might be sad to find out that he's bullshit, but he was just misinformation rather than the focal point of one's existence.\n\nMainstream atheism is confused by theism because they see God as a type two myth. It's not. \"God\" comes from the same pattern of thought that gave birth to Newtonian physics: the absolute rationality of the universe based on principles. Most people who call themselves atheists have a God concept, but express it with different symbols. The reason most people who call themselves atheists and theists have trouble getting along is usually that each believes the opposite is attacking their core beliefs (ultimate rationality), rather than the symbols that express it (ie evolution, creation).\n\nTLDR: I can't say for certain, you might be a nihilist, but you probably believe in God. The God concept itself is not the mythology, but a paradigm; biblical passages and religious fables are the mythology. Keep symbols and core concepts in separate boats.

A theory is a a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.  Examples you may be familiar with are gravitational theory and germ theory.  \n\n\nA general misunderstanding of scientific terms is that a theory is scientific conjecture that eventually becomes a law when it's supported by evidence.  A theory is not a \"baby law\".\n\n\nA theory remains valid until a competing theory offers a better explanation that fits the evidence more precisely.  \n\nThe big bang is a theory.
