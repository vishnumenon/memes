Conducting or even referencing studies like this is beyond idiotic.  \n\nYou would have to be an absolute moron to look at the question \"Is there a God?\" and think that, to answer it, you'd better conduct psychological studies to look at differences between believers and non-believers; these are entirely irrelevant.  And though few would admit it openly, the people referencing these studies (possibly even some of those conducting them) are using them in just this way, as if the results - whatever they might be - could possibly have some bearing on an ontological question.

I'm not one of them.  I don't believe in chupacabras.  But when I say \"I don't believe in chupacabras\" I'm kind of playing the believers' game.
