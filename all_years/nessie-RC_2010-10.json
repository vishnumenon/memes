{"body": "The stereotype of theists as unthinking sheeple is about as tired as the conception of atheists as amoral narcissists. Of course a belief in God does not require that Catholicism follow. Obviously, there are many other religions out there, just as there are many Christianities. What belief can do, however, is to open one to the rich and variegated philosophical traditions of the Church, which people are free to weigh and accept as they deem fit. The magisterium of the Church is a living, mutable institution. While it is free to claim whatever authority it likes in light of traditions such as apostolic succession, that authority must always be weighed against the vast preponderance of unrevealed truth that it has never claimed to have total access to. Even within Catholicism, accepted dogma is open for debate, reinterpretation, and innovation, and has been since the start; otherwise there would never have been any growth, and we wouldn't have the ridiculously complex philosophical/theological system that we have now. That more or less leaves any thinking Catholic free to question many of the dogmas of the church. That they do so in the shadow of a complex theological system, which may render some arguments more defensible than others (as indeed the case with any system of thought, abstract or otherwise) does not change the fact that arguments can and should be made. I grew up in a more or less areligious environment (I remember going to a Methodist Church a few times with my grandparents when I was like 4 or 5, but otherwise didn't), but became Catholic later in appreciation of the Church's and my own philosophical beliefs. I wasn't indoctrinated, and I sure as hell don't accept anything just because someone told me it was so.\n\nThe Loch Ness monster analogy is just a shitty one, and misses half the point of what I was saying before. I am a firm believer in science to answer questions about the physical world around us. Like any good scientist, I certainly would be open to the possibility of the Loch Ness monster. But then I would go to that Loch, look around, analyze my findings, and based on my findings I would say their is no such thing. But I don't look for God in the physical world. I'm entirely open to Dr. Hawking's recently published theories that the physics of the Universe explain themselves, and that we don't need recourse to God to explain its existence. I would of course caution that the rigor and suitability of a theory does not serve to automatically negate other possibilities. Instead, it *convinces* us on the strength of its argument, regardless if its true or not. I'm a big fan of Occam's Razor, because it makes good sense, but I also recognize that it doesn't dictate reality, but rather gives us a good tool for sorting through what we think and understand. Even so, I'll be happy to endorse Hawking if and when I get to read his new book and weigh his findings.\n\nBut as I said, I don't base my belief in God in the physical world, because He's not required for its existence and functioning (though again, this lack of necessity doesn't require His non-existence, either). Instead, indeed, I look for him outside of the material world in those fairy tales you mentioned, abstract absolutes such as Goodness, Justice, whatever. You're free to think of such things as relativistic socio-biological constructs unique to any particular world, species, race, or person, and so (myopically, I think) place them firmly in the realm of physical material (neurons and culture) here on our tiny corner of the universe, but I don't find that convincing. Rather instead I think these things transcend our own temporary being, and exist freely outside of the human or any other sentient mind. Without drawing out what is already a lengthy response with particular philosophical arguments, it is the belief in these concepts that open belief in God for me, and go on from there to the rest. You might not agree on this basic premise, and that's fine, I'm not saying you have to or are somehow stupid for not doing so. The athiest position makes perfect sense to me, and I'll never fault anyone for arriving at that conclusion. What I am asking, though, is that you don't stroll in like here like a dick with half-baked arguments, and try to dismiss thousands of years of philosophical tradition carefully considered by some of the greatest thinkers in history as something as silly and child-like as a 'fairy tale'.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1286298078", "subreddit": "Catholicism", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Instead I'm questioning whether you honestly read such a post instead of making it up; a lot of your comments have a slightly trolly tinge to on them, so it's a perfectly reasonable question, especially in /r/politics. \n\nBasically, if you want to use evidence to support your point, you should either be ready to provide the evidence, or be ready to admit that you do not actually have the evidence you used, and stop using it to argue your point. This is vital in any sort of debate, since it allows everyone involved to determine whether your argument has any merit. In other words, we're not talking about other's claims here; you should cite your arguments with specific data, avoid making the arguments, or just present them as an opinion. If you're just too lazy to track those comments down again, then stop using this information to make a point. I'm not asking for anything amazing here, just consistency.\n\nThus far I honestly not seen data on the topic of Canadian anchor babies one way or another. Given that I read reddit a lot more than I should, that's enough cause for me to wonder about your claims. Are you telling the truth? You might be, I never said you weren't. I just want to see the information you used to come to this decision. Basically, the problem is not that people are attacked as liars, it's that people use evidence that they are then not willing to produce. That's not lying, just bad debate form, and reddit is not very forgiving to bad debate form.\n\nTo finish off, I have not yet made any claims except that \"I have not seen a single piece of data to suggest this is even happening.\" Are you trying to say that I'm lying, and have in fact seen the post you are talking about? In fact, I currently do not hold any opinion on Canadian anchor babies except, \"Some guy named insomniac84 on reddit was saying they're an issue.\" What more, reddit is me, and it's you, and it's millions like us. We are each a tiny part of the community, and the community is a part of our internet persona. Are you saying you believe everything you read on reddit? If so, then you clearly believe me, and if not, then it would be more correct to say you believe this mysterious post over me.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1286998880", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; What do you think would happen after death (after life),\n\nThis is the unproven idea of a soul, and this idea is worth exploring. The soul is usually meant to mean your personality, your thinking and consciousness. It's supposed to be something that inhabits your flesh body and which animates it in some way. It's like a ghost or spirit, an invisible puppeteer.\n\nPlato and the Pythagorians advocated a mind/body distinction in terms of the supernatural and natural. At the time this ideology helped justify slavery because a slave‚Äôs caged body had a soul that would later rest in an afterlife; after the slave owners were done with the slave‚Äôs body. The idea of a distinction between the mind and body has powerful implications for what we will tolerate within our lives.\n\nWe now know through modern research that disabling parts of the brain can affect the mind and its personality. Those with brain damage can have different personalities, and this effect can last for life. A person could live for one half of their life with one personality and then ‚Äî through brain injury ‚Äî live the other half with a very different personality.\n\nThe concept of one essential personality is false. The idea of ghosts or souls that survive death of the body must be reconciled with the dozens of personalities that we can induce in the body‚Äôs brain.\n\nThere's no reason to think that anything like a soul survives death. When we die our atoms will scatter and our minds are gone.\n\n&gt; and how would it feel like?\n\nMy brain wouldn't have the capacity to feel when it's brain dead.\n\n&gt; To make things clear, I'm not against atheists or any religion. I just want to get the right picture of what atheists believe.\n\nWell I wouldn't use the word \"belief\" to describe what I've said above. What's been said above is based on facts, so belief is unnecessary.\n\nI haven't said that souls don't exist for certain, but I have said that there's no reason to think they exist (along with gods, ghosts, an afterlife, etc.). It doesn't require \"belief\" to think that Zeus is unproven, or to think that Scientology is funny, or to think that there's no evidence, sadly, of Yetis. Religious ideas aren't falsifiable so there's no way to know which one is right and which one is wrong. It seems to be all based on culture, and no religion ever traveled faster across the globe than people's ability to tell stories. For all intents and purposes they don't exist.\n\nI've looked for religious or soul-like answers but they were unconvincing, and they seemed to be wishful thinking.\n\n&gt; Don't care if you downvote, just want clear answers and want to know if atheists have different beliefs or all of them believe in one thing.\n\nMost atheists around here are materialists (in the 'natural universe made of atoms' sense, not in a 'cash money' sense)\n\n&gt; doesn't that scare you?\n\nWell if it's true then I may as well get on with it. Bending my idea of reality to what's comforting would be childish.\n\nI never expected to be immortal so it's not depressing and having one life makes it infinitely more valuable. I have any reason to think I'll get a second chance at this.\n\n&gt; what if you don't fulfill all you desire in this life... What's the purpose of life then?\n\nWell, what makes you think the universe owes you purpose? \n\nLife exists because it's better at holding its atoms together than non-life. In a sense we as a species have evolved tendencies to reproduce.\n\nFor individuals we make our own purpose and we enjoy people and things in the world. See also: http://imgur.com/6tS72.jpg\n\n&gt; because we are here , and we have the ability to think. we developed a thinking conscious to solve something, for a purpose.\n\nThere's no reason to think that life neatly fits into a narrative of purpose.\n\nConsciousness is an evolved product of the brain. Being able to reason about upcoming events is a survival benefit. It may have no greater purpose and there's no reason to think there is.\n\n&gt; why would we make children, if they're going to die and end up as we did nothing?\n\nBecause we feel biologically compelled to, and because life can be fun. We try to give our children a good start into the world.\n\n&gt; i mean in this life.. it doesn't feel it's long enough.\n\nThen make the most of it and don't waste time on Sunday mornings in a large room talking about superstition.\n\nReligions say they'll give a payback in the form of supernatural rewards the question is whether there is any payback. Our innate reciprocal altruism can be co-opted by the promise of supernatural rewards that are inherently unknowable. It‚Äôs as if you lent money to a friend who promises they‚Äôll pay it back in an afterlife. Religions are simply a bad deal.\n\n&gt; Ok what about Out Of Body experience ... Why wouldn't it feel like this in afterlife?\n\nOut of body experiences, or near death experiences, often involve a tunnel of light and this can be explained by the experience of 'tunnel vision'.  As far as floating around your body I have dreams like that all the time, but I'm never able to identify anything that makes me think it's anything more than a dream.\n\nYou can reproduce Out of Body experiences in your own body http://imgur.com/dbn4g.jpg \n\n&gt; Let me get this straight, so atheists don't believe in souls? im confused a little bit.\n\nThe dictionary definition of atheist means someone who is without any belief in gods. People can call themselves atheist and believe in the Loch Ness Monster or Unicorns or souls. For example, Buddhists believe in reincarnation (e.g. souls) but they don't believe in gods.\n\nOn Reddit most atheists disbelieve in gods and souls.\n\n&gt; some people told me, why not having a religion just in case you were wrong about the existence of god..and it shows up that god does exist. ( i know you can't have a religion if you don't believe from the beginning ), but what do you think?\n\nThis is called Pascals Wager which is basically gambling. Pascal's Wager is a bad reason to believe and here are two videos of about why:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07JvzfO0vOk\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpJ7yUPwdU\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1287433710", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I stopped going to mass, avoided mass, would not receive the Eucharist, lived a life of manipulating people especially women for my own desire and selfishness. I became an atheist. Read on Dawkins, hailed Hawking, flying spaghetti monster, and the Darwin fish. I indulged myself with all the pleasures of this world could offer. It was a great time, a happy life... to a degree! Nevertheless, it was empty... is this it? is it all there to life?\n\nThis is all I needed to know. You didn't become an atheist, you became disillusioned. If you \"come to\" atheism for any reason other than because you thought about it, and it didn't seem reasonable that there is a god, then of course you're going to feel like something's missing-- because, as I said, you were looking for something to begin with. The first thing religion does to a young person is to give them a sense of dependency on that religion-- absence of religion is associated with doubt, fear, sadness, suffering, evil, and everything else bad known to man.\n\nAtheism has nothing to do with manipulating people, hailing Hawking, giving in to desires of the flesh, or any of those things. Those things are simply stuff you wanted to do before but couldn't, or things that you did simply to spite a God that on some level you still believed in. Many atheists are happy to acknowledge that while many religious practices may be ludicrous in terms of why they're practiced, they've been around long enough taht through trial and error, many of those practices have positive results. If they didn't work, they wouldn't be codified and practiced by huge groups of people, at least to some degree and in some context. It's no surprise that if you went around breaking every taboo known to your religion and began mistreating people, you weren't happy.\n\nI never stopped going to mass myself, not until the very end of the process of letting go. Catholicism never seemed like nonsense, it seemed like a very deep challenge that at times filled me with doubt, but it was never nonsense. I attended bible study regularly-- of *course* Catholics have bible study, I've never heard the stereotype that they don't! I taught catholicism to grade school children for years, and read the Bible every night before bed. I never \"turned away\" from Catholicism out of anger, boredom, some terrible event in my life, or anything like that-- in fact, I left it with sadness, because I really enjoyed the practices that went along with it. I miss the community, and I miss the communal singing, I miss praying before bed each night-- there are a lot of comforting practices that go along with religion. And even after I realized I didn't believe, I continued to go to church for quite some time, just for the songs and the community. I only stopped because it felt dishonest. Once you start recognizing some of the patterns that lead people to believe in religions, superstitions, astrology, etc, though, you cannot stop seeing them, and you cannot go back to believing them yourself, at least not without some major life trauma. It's hard to be around people who strongly believe in something when you do not believe in it, and in addition feel that you understand what motivates them to believe in it.\n\nI'm sorry that you felt empty without religion, but I firmly believe that is because you have never let go of religion to begin with. In the same way that people can convince themselves they believe in a religion when deep down they don't, I don't find it at all unusual to convince yourself you don't believe in religion when deep down you do. And if that's the case, you'll eventually return to religion, and you'll have all kinds of guilt and other issues in the meantime.\n\nhttp://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/09/11/the-texas-sharpshooter-fallacy/\nLet's examine your coincidences.\n\nFirst, you met someone named Luke who was a Catholic. Luke is a very common name for Catholics. Second, you read from the book of Luke in a Bible study. Well-- most Bible study groups that I've been involved with always pick one reading from the Gospels in addition to another from the old testament or letters. You had a 1/4 chance of getting a reading from Luke. You also had a 1/4 chance of getting a reading from Luke when you next went to Church. In addition, since it was the Liturgical Year of Luke, it was even more likely, since that's the whole point of the Liturgical cycles-- to pay special attention to some aspect of the Bible, such as the Gospel of Luke. \n\nHow many liturgical years are there? Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't there only three, based on the three Synoptic Gospels?\n\nBut more importantly than trying to reduce the impact of the coincidences that did happen, think how many possibilities you're ignoring. How many people did you meet during this time? How many were named \"John\" or \"Matt\" or \"Mark?\" How many readings from other books of the gospel did you hear that weren't from Luke? How many masses did you attend, any of which would have been equally \"impressive\" had any one of them happened to be the Feast Day of St. Luke? (You make it sound like it was your second mass back, is that accurate? But what if it had been, instead of \"the day you almost didn't go after exams\" but rather \"the day that my favorite sports team one the playoffs\" or \"the day that Grandma called out of the blue and told me she loved me\" or \"the day that you started dating a wonderful new girl\"-- all of these things would have seemed like amazing things to happen on the very same day that you ended up attending mass on St. Luke's feast day, but in fact there are so many things that some of them were bound to happen. All of this goes double because after the first coincidence, you probably kept your eyes out for more like them. You may never know it, but coincidences that are just as striking may have occurred with John, Paul, Andrew, James, Peter, and so forth-- but you weren't looking for them. And it also goes double because looking back on our memories, we make a lot of changes for them to conform to what we want them to be. Not you, but everyone.\n\nAnd finally, even if this were an incredible coincidence, there are thousands of people who have experienced equally incredible coincidences leading them to believe countless different things-- anything from religions that are absolutely clear that Catholics re going to hell to evidence for the Loch Ness Monster or UFOs. Unless a disproportionate number of incredible coincidences happen in favor of Catholicism when compared to the amount happening that seem to point to another belief system or idea, I can't use that coincidence to turn towards one particular idea.\n\nAnyway, that ran long, I'm sorry.

I collapsed to my knees, eyes closed, and gripped the rim of the toilet bowl, waiting for my core to tense up again. I wretched a few times, then felt it coming.\n\n**Hworf.**\n\n**Plop.**\n\nI hesitantly opened my eyes to inspect my output. There in the water, instead of a putrid stew of half-digested fruit rollups and Yoohoo, floated what appeared to be a whole, peeledd, boiled egg.

{"body": "&gt;Mobile devices and consoles are distinctly different from Personal Computers\n\nYes, but should they be?\n\nThat's the question that deserves asking, and it seems like Apple's been thinking on it. At least they're making noises like they have been.\n\nThere's a story that's been making the rounds lately; I have no idea if it's true at all, but it sounds about right. After the iPad was announced, Jobs held a meeting of the senior managers in the MacBook group. He walked in with an iPad. Touched the little button at the top, and pow, it was on and ready to go. \"Why can't I do that with a MacBook?\" he's said to have asked.\n\nIt's a damn good question. Yes, you can say \"Well, a MacBook is a personal computer, and it's distinctly different from a mobile device,\" but that misses the point. The point is, what's preventing Apple from *changing* the MacBook hardware or Mac OS X ‚Äî¬†or both ‚Äî¬†to make the devices wake up instantly from a deep-power-saving state barely distinguishable from off?\"\n\nThat's just one example; there are others that have already been mentioned in the thread. Why do we have to save files? Right now, applications are generally fail-deadly. If you don't save your file manually, and anything interrupts the application you're using, your data just disappears. That's dumb. Why can't that be changed?\n\nOr, to use an example from the demo last week, why isn't there OS-level support for a full-screen display mode for Mac OS X applications? Sometimes full-screen applications are really cool. iPhoto was the example given, but in my world it's definitely true of Aperture, Nuke and Photoshop, all of which I use in full-screen most of the time. Other applications, like Final Cut Pro and After Effects, have a sort of fake-full-screen mode as well; why not go the extra step and give the developers of those applications an easy way to make the *entire* computer user interface disappear?\n\n\"Mobile devices,\" which I guess is what we've decided to call things like the iPhone, the iPod touch and the iPad, are, as you say, distinctly different from computers right now. But in what ways are they *better* than computers, and what ideas can we steal from them and bring back to make computer better? That's the question, and it's a *good* question, and I'm glad somebody's asking it.\n\n&gt; My not too far fetched fear is that Apple will turn said Personal Computers into locked down Computing appliances like their mobile devices.\n\nGiven that there's absolutely no reason to believe this, any more than there's a reason to believe in the Loch Ness Monster, I'm reluctant to even discuss it. But okay, let's say it's true. Let's say that's exactly what a Mac of 2014 is like.\n\nWhy would that be bad? Such a Mac would certainly be more reliable than the ones we have today. Right now, anybody who wants to ‚Äî¬†respected ISV, mischievous teenager, whatever ‚Äî can make an application available for sale without any vetting or quality-control. Nothing's stopping, say, Adobe (those jerks) from shipping a fundamentally broken installer for their software. If software for the Mac *had* to be examined by experts before that software could be sold, that'd be a better thing for everybody.\n\nAnd such a Mac would definitely be simpler and easier to use. Let's go back to the Adobe example. You want to install CS5? Prepare yourself for a good long session of fighting with their fucked-up installer. You want to *uninstall* CS5? Forget it. It's effectively impossible. You either spend all day hunting down files one at a time in the most obscure places on your Mac, or you just take the short route and wipe the drive and reinstall the OS. An iron-fisted App Store approach would solve that right away. Adobe would be *forced* to clean up their act if they want to ship Mac software ‚Ä¶ and given that Mac software accounts for more than half of their sales, they'd go along with it without hesitation. And you know what? There's a fair chance their attitude would be one of *gratitude,* 'cause Apple would be going out of their way to *help* Adobe get it right.\n\nI'm not seeing it as the dystopia you seem to imagine.\n\n&gt; Any non-permitted devices will not be blocked or you will have your ass thrown in jail.\n\nRight now, if you drive a car without having insurance, you get your ass ‚Ä¶ well, not thrown in jail, but you get your driving license revoked. It's reasonable to require that people take personal responsibility to limit their liability, when they're doing things that can negatively affect others. Again, this does not sound dystopian to me. This sounds *responsible.*\n\nNow, it's obvious that your extreme hypothetical scenario would never come to pass. Whether the outcome is dystopian or utopian, it'd take way too much work to get from here to there; it's simply not practical.\n\nBut the point is, when somebody steps up and says \"We have some ideas about making computers better, faster, more accessible and more energy-efficient,\" the reasonable response is *not* to go conspiracy-theorist-nuts and assert that these ideas are bad because, if combined with a whole bunch of crap you just made up in your head, they'd lead to a scenario that you, personally, don't want.

Earlier you agreed that it is rational to believe that the Loch Ness monster does not exist if there is an absence of strong evidence or argument that it does. No strong evidence or argument was required to show that the monster does not exist - absence of evidence or argument was enough. But now you claim that the atheist needs to be able to provide strong arguments or evidence if their belief in the non-existence of God is to be rational rather than a matter of faith. The contradiction is that on the first ocassion (Loch Ness monster) you agreed that the absence of evidence or argument is enough to rationally justify belief in the non-existence of the Loch Ness monster, but on this occasion (God), you do not.\n\nIt might be a direct hit, but maybe the test should have asked \"Is there strong evidence to suggest that God exists?\" While I don't believe that any of the evidence supporting the existence of the fabled Loch Ness Monster exists is strong, I believe that there is strong evidence supporting the existence of God. \n\nAt the same time, if a person believes that there is strong evidence to support the lack of a God, then their atheism is rational and not based on faith (as would be the case if a person believed there are no strong arguments or evidence against God and was an atheist anyway.)\n\n&gt;You claimed earlier that any being which it is right to call God must want there to be as little suffering in the world as possible. But you say that God could make it so that everything now considered sinful becomes morally acceptable and everything that is now considered morally good becomes sinful. What this means is that God could make the reduction of suffering a sin... yet You've said that God must want to reduce suffering. There is a way out of this, but it means biting a bullet. So You've got to make a choice: (a) Bite the bullet and say that it is possible that God wants what is sinful (to reiterate the argument here - she must want to reduce suffering; she could make the reduction of suffering a sin; but if she did so, what she wanted (reducing suffering) would be sinful). (b) Take a direct hit and say that this is an area where your beliefs are just in contradiction.\n\nSurely, God could reverse morality if he chose, but there is no rational reason to believe that He would, based on what I understand of Him which I why I was willing to bite the bullet on this one.\n\n&gt;You've just bitten a bullet! In saying that God has the freedom and power to do that which is logically impossible (like creating square circles), you are saying that any discussion of God and ultimate reality cannot be constrained by basic principles of rationality. This would seem to make rational discourse about God impossible. If rational discourse about God is impossible, there is nothing rational we can say about God and nothing rational we can say to support our belief or disbelief in God. To reject rational constraints on religious discourse in this fashion requires accepting that religious convictions, including your religious convictions, are beyond any debate or rational discussion. This is to bite a bullet.\n\nI think this is a given. We cannot empirically 100% prove that God exists. Nor can atheists empirically 100% prove that It does not. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288045120", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; \"Belief that there is strong evidence for/against God would make a person's belief/atheism rational.\"\n\nThis is a tricksy statement, though I'm not implying that you are attempting to be deceptive.  I am saying, though, that you have two non-equal statements packaged together as equivalent.\n\nI'll explain what I mean though.\n\n - Belief that there is strong evidence for God\n\nThis case is clear.  The only question it raises is that of, \"What is your threshold/definition of 'evidence'?\"; but whatever the definition, if someone has what they consider to be 'evidence' that God exist then certainly - the belief in God based upon that evidence is potentially viewable as rational, (only subject to argument over the definition of evidence).\n\n- Belief that there is strong evidence against God\n\nWould in and of itself be an irrational belief given that there is no logically consistent way to 'prove' a negative.  Therefore there can never be any 'strong evidence' for the existence of a negative.\n\nNow.. what I mean by 'negative' in this case is, \"The absence of something\"; and I'll give you a concrete example of what I mean.\n\nLets say that you have misplaced your keys.  You can absolutely prove where they are by simply finding them.  So, if you want to 'prove' that the keys are somewhere in the kitchen, you must find them in the kitchen.  Until you find the keys in the kitchen, you have no proof that they are there.  \n\nHowever, you will never be able to provide 'proof' that the keys are not in the living-room.  This is because no matter how long you search the living room, no matter how much time passes without you finding your keys in the living room, it will always be possible that they are actually there and that you just haven't found them yet.\n\nWhat you can do is disprove a negative.  So.. you can disprove the idea that the keys are not in the living room, simply by finding the keys in the living room.\n\nWhich brings us back to proof for/against God.  Proof **for** God is entirely possible.  This is a positive claim and validation of it is up to God, (eg. he can reveal himself or not).  However, proof **against** God isn't possible.  Even if God doesn't exist, all that could ever be accomplished is increasing confidence that his existence was unlikely, (just like proving that your keys are not in the living room.  It's an imposibility... except in the case of your proving that they **are** in the living room..) .  Or, in other words, the disproof of a negative is the proof of it's testable, positive, anti-thesis.\n\nSo, you can prove a positive and disprove a negative, but not the other way around.  \n\nSo you are looking at the atheist side of things wrong from the start.  It isn't that they feel there is strong evidence or proof against God.  Instead, they feel that in the absence of evidence for God, it is reasonable to suppose he doesn't exist.\n\nIf you are going to understand where atheist are coming from, (the reasonable ones that is), this logical distinction is very important.\n\n&gt; \"Lack of belief that there is strong evidence for/against God would make a person's belief/atheism irrational and entirely faith-based.\"\n\nThe same logical process I discussed above regarding the rationality of a position applies in reverse here.\n\nThe logical position is that belief in anything without adequate evidence requires a retreat to Faith.  The question of weather or not Faith can be seen as rational or irrational is actually a separate argument, (and is highly conditional for the 'rational' category).\n\n&gt; \"Plenty of people believe that there is strong evidence/argument for the existence of a Loch Ness Monster, even when faced with evidence/arguments that suggest otherwise.\"\n\nWhich returns the questions to the core one, which is, \"how are the two sides defining 'evidence'?\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1288058712", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
