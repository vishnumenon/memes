Inositol also might potentially be helpful in preventing fatty liver disease (it works synergistically with and similarly to choline) and it is found in a high amount in many fruits. Two of the richest sources are in fact cantaloupe and oranges, which are also rich in soluble fiber *and* fructose.\n\nWhile an argument for the consumption for curbing intake of foods unnaturally high in fructose (stuff with added sugar in any form including HFCS), *many* people can potentially take this too far and completely limit consumption of fruits.

Our ancestors evolved eating a large amount of fructose rich foods such as fruits, and the paleolithic diet incorporates fruits (especially berries) into the diet for this very reason. \n\nI feel by addressing fructose the way you have (as bad for you) that you are also oversimplifying the issue a bit as well.\n\nThat being said I think the Paleolithic is a pretty damn good dietary choice.

{"body": "Really, eating a low-carb diet is just a product/benefit of what Paleo really is. The Paleo diet is based on foods that were really only available to our ancestors back in the Paleolithic era, where they had to hunt down game and meats, eat vegetables and some fruits as they were available, and maaaybe some tree nuts. **In the Paleo diet, you are basically not allowed grains, legumes, dairy, or any excess sugars**. The reason for this is that those particular foods were in a way \"invented\" by humans and weren't naturally found. Of course, many vegetables and animals have evolved a little over time so the types of vegetables/fruits we eat today won't ever really replicate what existed before,  but the general concept of it is the same: Whatever you eat is as few ingredients and processing as possible to get it there. The more 1-ingredient type foods you can eat or cook from scratch, the better.\n\nNow, don't confuse Paleo with Keto...where Keto is just eating as very very few carbs as possible to be in Ketosis, where your body is burning all your excess fat as fuel instead of looking towards the carbs/sugars for energy. Also with Keto, you are allowed bacon, dairy, cheeses and many other foods that are frowned upon in Paleo because of their inventive nature and processes they go through. When switching to either Paleo or Keto, you'll naturally consume less carbs, and your body will therefore need to find other sources of energy. Where does it get energy? From your fat stores and fats you may consume from fatty nuts and meats. This is how Paleo/Keto may help people lose weight...since your body is no longer grabbing its bad and spiking sources of energy from sugars, your body becomes a lot more efficient at burning off fats. \n\nHowever, this fat burning only really comes with really strict Paleo or Keto diets with very few cheats. If you're going to start Paleo, I would suggest going at it pretty strict for 30 days. In fact, here's a program called [Whole 30](http://whole9life.com/2010/12/whole30-2011/) that you can look into. After then can you really see the benefit that it has...people can take time to adjust to it after suddenly not eating carbs, so stick with it.\n\nAlso, usually on the Paleo diet, you don't really do any calorie counting at all or much carb counting...why is this? For one, you're consuming more proteins so you feel more full without having to eat as much. And overall you might find yourself naturally eating less calories. You can try counting for the first week, but really don't stress over it...your body will let you know. Also, if you're sticking pretty strict to Paleo, it's really tough to consume more than 50-70g of carbs anyways unless all you eat is dried fruit and more fruit (which fruit should be pretty limited anyways unless you're an 2+ hour endurance athlete needing some glycogen stored up).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1305167834", "subreddit": "Paleo", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh god yes. I can name, off the top of my head, at least 3 dreams from more than 10 years ago that have totally shaped my life since then.\n\nMost vividly, though, was fourth grade (24 now), when I had a dream about the Loch Ness Monster that instantly yielded a crippling fear - not just discomfort, full-on-phobia status - of natural bodies of water. \n\n**If you don't like reading dreams, come back when you see more bold text**\n\nFamily vacation to Loch Ness. I had brought a trumpet (I was eager to start playing at that time), and was blasting it when my mom jokes \"Careful, you'll wake up the loch ness monster.\" Sure enough, a floating log nearby rises up (insert footage from the 1930's King Kong where the dinosaur's neck comes out behind the boat and raises hell) and Nessie has arrived.\n\nThere's a sudden volta, and now Loch Ness is made of \"Lava\" (small island in the middle, and the whole lake now covers maybe an acre or so), and inside of a huge basketball-arena style dome. I, and a few other individuals, are being studied for an experiment inside the dome. The \"experiment\" amounted to a bunch of us being forced to play volleyball with a beach ball, and if the ball goes in the lake whoever hit it last has to go retrieve it (but the lava doesn't kill you, it just looks like it would and keeps you from being able to see the Monster).\n\nPeople keep getting eaten by the monster, until it's just me and a few other kids. I start getting really nervous and looking for a way out of the lab; the exits are open, but they're made of a network of bars from [these things](http://www.lifetime.com/Photo.ashx?id=97) that are just thick enough to make escape impossible. On the other side of the bars I can see the scientists who are the stereotypical, white-coat-and-clipboard scientists, except all white eyes like greek statues.\n\nSince I've been multitasking, this post has taken me more then 40 minutes to write so far and I've been drinking the whole time so now I'm too drunk to finish the dream other than bullet points. They're all honest.\n\n-I had to swim with the monster, and he brushed past me just once in a blur of black that disrupted the flourescent orange of the rest of the lake\n\n-I held Maggie Simpson out over the water to be sacrificed. When she was eaten I told the monster \"Hey that's my sister, man\" in a Bart Simpson voice.\n\n-I probably didn't need to resort to bullet points for those last two things, but I wanted to indicate that I was leaving lots of stuff out.\n\n**THE BOLD TEXT IS BACK AND NONE OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN READING THIS ANYWAY, I'M SURE**\n\nThe phobia actually got worse and worse up until I started forcing myself into creeks and rivers, and I KNOW it was because of this dream because I thought of it every single time I got near any body of water. The strangest part? The smaller the body of water, the more uncomfortable I was with it. I have heard LOTS of people tell me that they, too, \"don't like not being able to see their feet\" in the water. \n\nI can see why people thought that, and it certainly was the case: there was no way I was swimming anywhere that I couldn't at least touch. That's not uncommon. What IS uncommon, though, is how incredibly uneasy I am around small ponds in the forest. Small, murky ponds, less than 15-20 feet in diameter, are literally LOADED with monsters as far as my brain is concerned. While I can now swim in the Great Lakes and a few other places (all the while battling my inner demons in these places), you would be hard pressed to get me near any particularly silty, small pond in the middle of the woods. It's exponentially worse than a vast expanse of ocean in front of me. I assume it has something to do with my brain being made of dumbass.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1306217916", "subreddit": "DoesAnybodyElse", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn anymore; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence. Would this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?\n\n2. Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots. Would you attempt to do this?\n\n3. Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical. Which option do you select?\n\n4. At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR. Would you still do this?\n\n5. Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. You are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?\n\n6. You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\" Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?\n\n7. A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commerical success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likliehood of you reading this book?\n\n8. You meet a wizard in downtown Chicago. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, \"I will now make them a dollar more attractive.\" He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front. How much cash do you give the wizard?\n\n9. Every person you have ever slept with is invited to a banquet where you are the guest of honor. No one will be in attendance except you, the collection of your former lovers, and the catering service. After the meal, you are asked to give a fifteen-minute speech to the assembly. What do you talk about?\n\n10. You have a brain tumor. Though there is no discomfort at the moment, this tumor would unquestionably kill you in six months. However, your life can (and will) be saved by an operation; the only downside is that there will be a brutal incision to your frontal lobe. After the surgery, you will be significantly less intelligent. You will still be a fully functioning adult, but you will be less logical, you will have a terrible memory, and you will have little ability to understand complex concepts or difficult ideas. The surgery is in two weeks. How do you spend the next fourteen days?\n\n11. You are sitting in an empty bar (in a town you’ve never before visited), drinking Bacardi with a soft-spoken acquaintance you barely know. After an hour, a third individual walks into the tavern and sits by himself, and you ask your acquaintance who the new man is. “Be careful of that guy,” you are told. “He is a man with a past.” A few minutes later, a fourth person enters the bar; he also sits alone. You ask your acquaintance who this new individual is. “Be careful of that guy, too,” he says. “He is a man with no past.” Which of these two people do you trust less?\n\n12. You have won a prize. The prize has two options, and you can choose either (but not both). The first option is a year in Europe with a monthly stipend of $2,000. The second option is ten minutes on the moon. Which option do you select?\n\n13. Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room. Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage. If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up. However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that. So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why. Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?\n\n14. For whatever the reason, two unauthorized movies are made about your life. The first is an independently released documentary, primarily comprised of interviews with people who know you and bootleg footage from your actual life. Critics are describing the documentary as “brutally honest and relentlessly fair.” Meanwhile, Columbia Tri-Star has produced a big-budget biopic of your life, casting major Hollywood stars as you and all your acquaintances; though the movie is based on actual events, screenwriters have taken some liberties with the facts. Critics are split on the artistic merits of this fictionalized account, but audiences love it. Which film would you be most interested in seeing?\n\n15. Imagine you could go back to the age of five and relive the rest of your life, knowing everything that you know now. You will re-experience your entire adolescence with both the cognitive ability of an adult and the memories of everything you’ve learned from having lived your life previously. Would you lose your virginity earlier or later than you did the first time around (and by how many years)?\n\n16. You work in an office. Generally, you are popular with your coworkers. However, you discover that there are currently two rumors circulating the office gossip mill, and both involve you. The first rumor is that you got drunk at the office holiday party and had sex with one of your married coworkers. This rumor is completely true, but most people don’t believe it. The second rumor is that you have been stealing hundreds of dollars of office supplies (and then selling them to cover a gambling debt). This rumor is completely false, but virtually everyone assumes it is factual. Which of these two rumors is most troubling to you?\n\nEdit: Source is Chuck Klosterman's \"23 Questions I Ask Everybody I Meet In Order To Decide If I Can Really Love Them\" ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1306437255", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; does any evidence suggest that there might be another gigantic, but not yet known creature? Either in the ocean, or on land?\n\nWell, it's certainly possible that there is an unknown gigantic creature in the oceans - the volume of Earth's oceans is *huge*, and we've explored only a tiny fraction. There is plenty for them to eat without us ever noticing.\n\nBy the same token, however, we can probably eliminate most locales as housing a currently unknown large animal species (ie human-sized). We can figure out how many there would need to be to possibly have a stable breeding population (iirc, the minimum is 14, but that takes very careful planning. More realistically, you'd need several dozen at a minimum), and we can figure out how large their range would have to be (based on how much they'd have to eat for their size). If you run the calculations, I'm pretty sure you'd find that the places which are commonly alleged to house cryptofauna like bigfoot could not possibly support them without them having an impact on the local ecology that we would notice.\n\nFurthermore, in cases like the Loch Ness monster, not only did the BBC scan the entire loch, as KingPharoah mentioned, but it had previously been established that it couldn't exist because there wasn't enough for it to eat without us noticing the reduction in fish populations.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1306475434", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}
