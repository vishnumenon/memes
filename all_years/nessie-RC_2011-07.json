All those who claim to have seen Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster or Chupacabra or Yeti.  The many who have claim to have heard amazingly accurate, otherwise unexplainable information from a psychic.  Those thousands who have seen ghosts.  Talk to some Scientologists who claim to have seen thetans cleared of the mentally ill, fully curing them sans drugs.  The followers of witch doctors, who will sincerely proclaim their magical powers by witness.  Perhaps you could speak to all those who saw miracles performed by now-discredited con-man evangelists.  Read about the multitude of Catholics throughout history who have claimed to have seen saints [levitate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_and_levitation).  Or talk to the Mexican Catholics who take Polaroids of the sun and claim to see the Virgin Mary in subtleties of the lightplay.  The 30,000 who claimed to witness [The Miracle of the Sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun)...\n\n&gt; And by the way, what I've listed is a tiny, TINY fraction of the ridiculous events that many people will look you in the eyes and unabashedly tell you occurred.\n\nDo you believe all that stuff, simply because people *said* it?  Or do you just selectively believe the fantastical stories that fit into your preconceived expectations?\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310400747", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; You're confusing religion with theism.\n\nWell no, but I have only talked about religion and not theism. Most of what I've said applies to belief in general. Theism is a personal belief and from my perspective it's as flawed as any religion.\n\nThere's a valid distinction between early sciences (which are usually humble ideas, quite unsure of themselves) and religions which typically cherish belief as a leap of faith.\n\n&gt; I don't see how science can say, mankind has never been influenced by any other force then our own will.\n\nI agree, but that doesn't conflict with what I or anyone else has said here in this thread.\n\nFurther, that's not something that's said by anyone in science. It's not a scientific question so of course it can't even be answered in science. The core of science is falsifiability (in the Karl Popper sense) and aside from some fringe cases no one can prove a negative... no one can prove that things didn't happen. For example, take the analogous question \"Prove there are no unicorns\" ...well we could search behind every rock in the universe and we'd still be unable to prove that there were none at any point in time. Questions that aren't falsifiable don't lead to evidence.\n\nSo no one is saying that humanity wasn't influenced by gods, and no one is saying that there absolutely aren't gods or unicorns or yetis or the loch ness monster but they are saying that there's no reason to think any of these things are true.\n\nSimilarly, it's very rare for an atheist to have a *belief* that there is no god. Instead what they have is no reason to think that there is a god.\n\n&gt; Whether or not that influence still exists, if it was ever there, then God, for all intents existed and may still somewhere.\n\nSure, but aliens or an [butterfly flapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) could fit that broad definition of gods. Let's not let verbal ambiguity mix up our terms here... the god of theism means something more than alien interference. Even if intelligent aliens seeded our planet with early life and they had views on how we should live today then we 1) probably wouldn't call them gods and 2) we would consider their opinion alongside ours, not with the authority of gods.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not implying any Christianity or saying more than a plain Theism (that at least one \"god\" exists) but I am saying that the word \"god\" implies a supernatural power and not just an influence on the world.\n\n[There's no reason to currently think that god, gods, unicorns, or aliens exist](http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Dragon.htm).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1310957076", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

This little fellow wasn't afraid to be caught asking questions.\n\n\"OI. RUPERT. HOW PROFIT?\" he bellowed.\n\nRupert, with the aid of a whiteboard and marker, made short work of this question. What he scrawled was pointed, pithy, and has since been immortalised in popular culture:\n\n* Step 1: Steal underwear\n\n* Step 2: ??\n\n* Step 3: Profit\n\nKyle, always the observant one, was quick to point out the rather obvious flaw in this logic:\n\n\"WHAT'S STEP 2?\"\n\n*Well*. Didn't *that* stump those Gnomes, boys and girls! Throughout the cave (as if by plague!), heads started a-scratchin', as Gnome after Gnome started to puzzle this one out. \n\nCan you imagine? Not a single Gnome had ever stopped to ask him (or her) self: What's step 2?\n\nIt was absolutely hilarious, and Southpark contributed a meme as funny as their previous \"Simpsons Did It\" and \"Tree Fiddy\" successes to culture and the canon.\n\nDo you see, my dear lulll? The meme is meant to espouse *x* with *y*, where *x* is either mundane or ridiculous, and could never -- logically -- result in *y* (in this case, profit). Examples off the top of my head would be:\n\n* Step 1: Blink 3 times\n\n* Step 2: ???\n\n* Step 3: Profit!\n\nDo you see?\n\nNow let's look at *your* usage of the meme:\n\n&gt;1. look at username\n\n&gt;2. reads post in herzog's voice\n\n&gt;3. ??\n\n&gt;4. profit\n\nOk. You're saying you saw his username (a reference to Herzog), you read his content in Herzog's voice (exactly what he intended), and this little diversion was interesting enough to please you (hence, profit).\n\nSo please, lulll, my precious, special lulll, can you tell me where the *fuck* \"??\" comes into it? \n\nWhat the fuck do you not understand? How is the logic in any way fractured? What is *missing* that you had to include \"??\"?\n\nAre you, in fact, a fucking idiot?\n\n    * might not be actual name of episode\n\n**TL;DR:** And that's how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311155645", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 73, "controversiality": 0}

He refers to skeptics as \"spoilsports.\" \n\nNone of these conclusively show that the author is a crank. Let's look at his sources.\n\nHe quotes first from the article that intends to apply ecological theory from the 1970s. Assuming that his quote is not taken out of context, here are the problems as I see them: \n\n1. \"It is well known that there are monsters in Loch Ness.\" No evidence is ever given to support this assumption.\n2. \"There are records of sightings going back centuries.\" The fact is, no amount of anecdotal data would be sufficient for a claim of this scale. If every person who had ever visited the Loch maintained that they had shaken hands with Nessie herself, it would still not be enough. People can lie, they can exaggerate, interviews can misunderstand, records can be lost or changed in transcription, etc. Eyewitness accounts can be thrown out.\n3. \"The fact that they are rarely seen suggests the population is small.\" Again, the authors are relying here on their assertion that Nessie exists, and have no evidence for that claim. Being rarely seen might just as easily be used as evidence that Nessies are invisible, or can shape-shift, or (most likely) do not exist. \n\n4. \"It is known from direct observation that the animals themselves are large and it follows from this that the population must be small.\" No, see above on eyewitness testimony.\n\n5. \"It has been suggested from time to time that as the monsters are never caught it must therefore follow that they do not exist. This is both irresponsible and illogical.\" This is an illogical statement the way that the authors phrase it. However, they are confusing the burden of proof. Skeptics are not claiming that Nessie does not exist; rather, believers are positing that she does. Therefore, the burden of proof lies on believers. Since there is no conclusive evidence, it is perfectly logical to presume that Nessie does not exist, because proponents have failed to back up their assertion with data.\n\nI hate to be the \"spoilsport\" here, but do a little real critical analysis, and the whole thing collapses.

Right now they have 4 highly rated roller coasters: Loch Ness Monster, Apollo's Chariot, Alpengeist, and Griffon. They got rid of Big Bad Wolf two years ago.\n\nFor Busch Gardens, everyone usually says eat at Trapper's Smokehouse or whatever, but I prefer two other places. There's Grogan's Grill in Ireland. I'll get Annie's Stew or whatever from there, then go chill inside Grogan's Pub and get a beer. For some reason Grogan's Pub is never really full. But since the park is not related to the beer company anymore, they have a much better selection of beers. Many on tap, and they just started bringing in some microbrews from around the country.\n\nMy other favorite place to get some food is in Das Festhaus. Except I skip that main area and head to the back to Festhaus Kafe. Also a place where not a lot of people venture. You can get a nice sandwich back there and two sides with it. They also serve a beer sampler there with 5 different kinds of beers. You can get your food then head out to the main room and catch a new version of This is Oktoberfest. \n\nI know I'm going long here, but I'm trying to help you get the most out of your beer experience here. 2 years ago they made it so you could bring beer pretty much anywhere in the park. So you can get a beer and hop in that 30 min long line for Alpengeist. Or bring it in to any of the shows. They also added a new building, Pretzels and Beer, next to the as yet unopened Mach Tower. They have these awesome sausages wrapped in pretzel. Sometimes the pretzels can come out hard, just ask them for another one and tell them it was overcooked. \n\nI don't know if you like shows but BGW is more of a family park than KD so they have more shows and such. So the three big ones to catch are Celtic Fyre, Mix it Up and This is Oktoberfest.\n\nAs far as KD is concerned, I haven't been there in a while, but if you like coasters that is the place for you. Dominator, Volcano, and Intimidator are probably the three best coasters there. If you're feeling like you want to ride a really bad coaster get on shockwave. That's a ride that sucks. I don't know what the food is like there, but if you don't like anything inside the park, just one exit up 95 is a lot of restaurants.\n\nIf you need more info: [BGWfans](http://bgwfans.com/forum/) or [KDFansite](http://kdfansite.com/forums/)\n\nTLDR: Drink a lot at BGW, lots of fun, ride some world class coasters, and see some shows.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1311941894", "subreddit": "rollercoasters", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "History *does* have a funny way of repeating itself. Look at the so-called Aryan invasions from 9,000 BC. You had horse-riding nomads from Central Asia storming into Eastern Europe. These Indo-European peoples were direct relatives of the Iranids in Persia, who--as we all know--would millennia later strike out from Central Asia to try and invade Greece. [It's the plot behind the movie \"The 300\"]. Still later, you had Atilla coming in with his horse-riding nomadic army and attacking the Roman Empire. Then, in the Middle Ages, you'd have Scyths and Khazars [two more horse-riding nomadic groups from Central Asia] storming into Eastern Europe. Then the *coup de grace*--the Turks (i.e., more horse-riding nomads from Central Asia) bringing down the Byzantine empire. \n\nIn other words, in just that small piece of land in Eastern Europe, you saw the same scenario enacted and re-enacted time and time again. Something about the movements of peoples must be tidal . . . recurring.\n\nSame thing in the Americas: There's striking evidence that Europeans [i.e., Basques] made it to North America thousands of years before the Amerindians showed up from Asia. Apparently, the Asiatics outnumbered the smaller European population and bred them out. But the fact remains: Europeans made it to America because the tides don't change with history. The Basques were good mariners, earning their living from the sea since the paleolithic era. The same currents that would later help Columbus brought the Basques to South Carolina. Their encampments on the East Coast are far, far older than the Asiatic colonies on the West Coast from Bering Strait populations from Siberia. So the Basque colonies pre-date the proto-Amerindians. Then, after disappearing, Europeans came again in the form of the Vikings. Then hundreds of years later in the form of Spaniards. And now the white population seems to be experiencing a similar demographic phenomenon: Asiatic breeding numbers are massively higher. And by \"Asiatic\" I'm including Amerindians--like those from Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, etc. The so-called \"Browning of America\" is really just the Amerindians coming back in another wave. And--as in all of previous history--they're outbreeding the European population . . . which will lead to the same conclusion it always does.\n\nSo, yes, history *does* have a way of being cyclical.

{"body": "&gt;I was really hoping to find a mature and open-minded community which simply had another perspective on the universe. A place where we could discuss evolution and the origins of the universe, the dark and vulgar themes in a piece of art, or the morality of abortion, all without fear of being belittled because our opinion was different. I was hoping for a place to explore all aspects of human emotion, including lust, anger, jealousy, and greed, and start with a clean slate instead of pre-conceived ideas of what was \"right\" or \"good.\" Instead it's just another group of people who sit around and bitch about other groups of people.\n\nBut one thing to realize is that the only reason a person needs to adopt the label \"atheist\" is because of the prevalence of theists in society. No one labels themselves an a-bigfoot-ist, or a-loch-ness-monster-ist, because it is probably taken for granted that anyone you meet will not believe in bigfoot or Nessie. As such, /r/atheism is really a place for atheists to discuss things like theism, and issues affecting the godless in a god drenched society.\n\nI fully understand what you were expecting and why you might expect it, but there are other places devoted to the topics you mention. For example, if you want to discuss dark and vulgar themes in art, an art sub-reddit would probably serve you well. After all, such an art sub-reddit could arguably be called atheist, or at least secular, in that it lacks the explicit theme of theism. Just as an a-theist person is a person who is not a theist, an a-theistic forum would be a forum that is not theistic. There are lots of atheist sub-reddits, so go enjoy them all, including this one. :-)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312071257", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
