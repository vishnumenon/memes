{"body": "1. Walking into reddit - My contention was that if you are going to come to a place steeped in religious debate, that you should at least have some new interesting arguments. Your points have been debated here before, and soundly beaten time and time again. \n2. Blind faith - Atheists believe that if a god exists that it can be proven.   Just as any other factual claim should be proven with evidence. Atheists do not feel that god and fairies and invisible dragons should hold any special distinction, nor should they be separate from this standard. \n3. The definition of Atheism - Do you believe in Zeus? or Fairies? You can't prove they don't exist... So i'm guessing anyone who says they don't exist is being intellectually dishonest?  As for the comparison to agnostics... I would say that atheists do not know for sure there isn't a god, we are awaiting evidence to prove his existence... but until that time comes, atheists will regard such a higher power with the same skepticism regarded for fairies and tea cups in space. As such, if asked if there are fairies, or tea cups in space... I and atheists will answer no. \n3. Looking down - Atheists treat the religious just as you might treat someone who believes Elvis is still alive.  Those espousing a religious belief show that that they do not value the basic standards of logic, evidence and science. If that leads to derision, so be it, it is well deserved. \n4. Atheists and intelligence - I can't say for sure that atheists are smarter, or better educated, it isn't important to my argument.  But I can say that atheists are people who take an independent examination of the facts, a careful study of history, and often have strong scriptural knowledge before coming to the decision to become a nonbeliever. People like that tend to be smarter, study after study shows this to be the case. \n5. Religion pushed civilization - That was true when religion had a monopoly on science, politics, literature and thought. Not so much anymore. I'd say that the great minds pushed civilization to the point we are today in spite of the shackles of religious dogma. \n\nIn the end I think we are going to have to agree to disagree... it's obvious that the standards of proof are different for you and I. Unless there is evidence of a higher power I will not believe in its existence... nor will I believe in fairies, or the loch ness monster, or santa claus, or a living elvis, or aliens, ghosts, or spiritual mediums, telepathy, telekinesis or any other bunk purported to be true without evidence.

Give him rock slide instead of fire punch and you get the same type coverage except for grass, and you're playing to your pokemon's strength. Give him Return and super happiness instead of hyper beam. Retruns max power is like 102, hyper beam's power is 150. 2X102=204 which is greater than the 150 from the hyper beam and recharge. (Same thing for Dragonite and Snorlax)\n\nNow for the Dragonite, yes I like how he can learn those wonderful moves, but they are all special. Dragonite has the highest attack in gen II so perhaps give him return, and physical attacks like earthquake\n(for a list of what is physical moves click [here](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Physical_moves) )\n\nFor Alakazam, the punches are nice, but shadow ball is physical, but remember in gen II there was only one pure ghost type Misdreavous. The others were part poison(which is weak to psychic) so you don't need shadow ball to take out ghosts, and you are probably going to switch to tyranitar if you see a psychic pokemon(unless you see starmie)\n\nFor Lapras, please give her surf. She is the loch ness monster, but she can't swim? Unacceptable. Also surf is a valuable move both in game and competitively. \n\nFor the last one, try a fire type like Magmar or Ninetales or Houndoom (or pick your favorite fire type i dont care) You need flamethrower on somebody who can use it well to help take out foretress(if you're going competitively) Magmar can have a good movepool with cross chop, thunderbolt, flamethrower, and psychic. Dunno what is best to give the others but get flamethrower.\n\nFor hold items, try scope lens, lum berry( i forget the gen II name) maybe gold berry? Dunno who to give them to. Hope I helped. \n\nEDIT: formatting and i forgot some stuff about the items", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1312685948", "subreddit": "pokemon", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Long questions, but can be answered fairly easily  \nFrom Chuck Klosterman's *Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs*:\n\n1. Let us assume you met a rudimentary magician. Let us assume he can do five simple tricks--he can pull a rabbit out of his hat, he can make a coin disappear, he can turn the ace of spades into the Joker card, and two others in a similar vein. These are his only tricks and he can't learn any more; he can only do these five. HOWEVER, it turns out he's doing these five tricks with real magic. It's not an illusion; he can actually conjure the bunny out of the ether and he can move the coin through space. He's legitimately magical, but extremely limited in scope and influence.  \nWould this person be more impressive than Albert Einstein?\n\n\n2. Let us assume a fully grown, completely healthy Clydesdale horse has his hooves shackled to the ground while his head is held in place with thick rope. He is conscious and standing upright, but completely immobile. And let us assume that--for some reason--every political prisoner on earth (as cited by Amnesty International) will be released from captivity if you can kick this horse to death in less than twenty minutes. You are allowed to wear steel-toed boots.  \nWould you attempt to do this?\n\n\n\n3. Let us assume there are two boxes on a table. In one box, there is a relatively normal turtle; in the other, Adolf Hitler's skull. You have to select one of these items for your home. If you select the turtle, you can't give it away and you have to keep it alive for two years; if either of these parameters are not met, you will be fined $999 by the state. If you select Hitler's skull, you are required to display it in a semi-prominent location in your living room for the same amount of time, although you will be paid a stipend of $120 per month for doing so. Display of the skull must be apolitical.  \nWhich option do you select?\n\n\n4. Genetic engineers at Johns Hopkins University announce that they have developed a so-called \"super gorilla.\" Though the animal cannot speak, it has a sign language lexicon of over twelve thousand words, an I.Q. of almost 85, and--most notably--a vague sense of self-awareness. Oddly, the creature (who weighs seven hundred pounds) becomes fascinated by football. The gorilla aspires to play the game at its highest level and quickly develops the rudimentary skills of a defensive end. ESPN analyst Tom Jackson speculates that this gorilla would be \"borderline unblockable\" and would likely average six sacks a game (although Jackson concedes the beast might be susceptible to counters and misdirection plays). Meanwhile, the gorilla has made it clear he would never intentionally injure any opponent.  \nYou are commissioner of the NFL: Would you allow this gorilla to sign with the Oakland Raiders?\n\n\n\n5. You meet your soul mate. However, there is a catch: Every three years, someone will break both of your soul mate's collarbones with a Crescent wrench, and there is only one way you can stop this from happening: You must swallow a pill that will make every song you hear--for the rest of your life--sound as if it's being performed by the band Alice in Chains. When you hear Creedence Clearwater Revival on the radio, it will sound (to your ears) like it's being played by Alice in Chains. If you see Radiohead live, every one of their tunes will sound like it's being covered by Alice in Chains. When you hear a commercial jingle on TV, it will sound like Alice in Chains; if you sing to yourself in the shower, your voice will sound like deceased Alice vocalist Layne Staley performing a capella (but it will only sound this way to you).  \nWould you swallow the pill?\n\n\n\n6. At long last, someone invents \"the dream VCR.\" This machine allows you to tape an entire evening's worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device of you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don't agree to this, you can't use the dream VCR.  \nWould you still do this?\n\n\n\n7. Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter in the Pacific Northwest shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week.  \nYou are the front page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?\n\n\n\n8. You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal: You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they have one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Henson's gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the film's \"deeper philosophy.\"  \nWould this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?\n\n\n\n9. A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commerical success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of these newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man).  \nWould this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likliehood of you reading this book?\n\n\n\n10. This is the opening line of Jay McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City: \"You are not the kind of guy who would be in a place like this at this time of the morning.\" Think about that line in the context of the novel (assuming you've read it). Now go to your CD collection and find Heart's Little Queen album (assuming you own it). Listen to the opening riff to \"Barracuda.\"  \nWhich of these two introductions is a higher form of art?\n\n\n\n11. You are watching a movie in a crowded theater. Though the plot is mediocre, you find yourself dazzled by the special effects. But with twenty minutes left in the film, you are struck with an undeniable feeling of doom: You are suddenly certain your mother has just died. There is no logical reason for this to be true, but you are certain of it. You are overtaken with the irrational metaphysical sense that--somewhere--your mom has just perished. But this is only an intuitive, amorphous feeling; there is no evidence for this, and your mother has not been ill.  \nWould you immediately exit the theater, or would you finish watching the movie?\n\n\n\n12. You meet a wizard in downtown Chicago. The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money. When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street. You look at this random stranger. The wizard says, \"I will now make them a dollar more attractive.\" He waves his magic wand. Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different. But--somehow--this person is suddenly a little more appealing. The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can't deny that this person is vaguely sexier. This wizard has a weird rule, though--you can only pay him once. You can't keep giving him money until you're satisfied. You can only pay him one lump sum up front.  \nHow much cash do you give the wizard?\n\n\n\n13. Every person you have ever slept with is invited to a banquet where you are the guest of honor.

{"body": "This. I'm okay with pools, rivers and oceans but I'll never swim in a lake because I'm afraid that the Loch Ness monster will eat me. I always think that he's in every single fucking lake. I went along with family to a lake yesterday and there was this bouncy floating trampoline that I desperately wanted to go on so I devised an awesome plan. Get onto an inner tube and paddle out to it and then tie it up to the trampoline to float back when I was finished. When I wanted to go back to the safety of the shore, my 11 year old cousin announced that I had to swim back. Swim? Me? In a fucking lake? Fuck no. So he tried to untie my tube but I pushed him into the water and leaped onto the tube and started paddling with all my strength to reach the place where the Loch Ness monster couldn't get me. But my cousin was determined for me to perish in the murky depths of Lake Oswego. \n\nHe grabbed the super long rope of the tube and on on the trampoline and pulled as hard as an 11 year old possibly could. But I am stronger. I can't pull too hard because I'd give him rope burns and he'd whine to the other adults. We were at an impasse. \n\nThe siege of the water trampoline lasted only 10 minutes until he fell in the water and became tired. I saw this as my escape and yanked the rope out of the little fucker's hands and paddled as fast as a WoW nerd lasts in bed. I had almost made it to safety. That Loch Ness monster wouldn't fuck with me today. \n\nI hear a loud splashing noise and turned around to see my my cousin swimming toward me at warp 2 determined to butt rape my ass with algae infested water. Ha! I was going warp 2.5. I was within jumping distance of the beach. I took a chance, stood up, and leaped. I. Fucking. Made it. It was my biggest accomplishment of the week.

There is always has to be something that can potentially falsify your position.  I'm with Dawkins on this one, extremely doubtful but if provided with compelling evidence my position could potentially change.  The positive position has the burden of proof.  Where I see guys like Sagan and Tyson saying they're agnostic, it appears they are stating that there is no evidence that their is a God but you can't discount the possibility 100%. It's the same as Dawkins.  The Sagan Standard is very compelling and something that science and rationality should cling to as an axiom.  I would argue that Sagan, Dawkins, Tyson, etc. are on the same page but use the terminology differently.  I like the way PZ Meyers put it to a questioning individual who asked what evidence it would take to change his mind about the existence of God.  PZ looked back and asked (paraphrasing) What evidence are you asking me to refute? Essentially, you want me to believe in an I U F unicorn? Lemme see it.\n\nI rode an invisible, intangible dragon to work this morning.  No one can prove I didn't.  In trying to convince you I did I have a lot of work ahead of me trying to prove it.

{"body": "TL;DR- yeah, sorry about that\n\nI don't know where Mageant is coming from, but I was just kidding around. But, I can kind of see your point, inasmuch as my comment (in my mind, anyway) plays off the fact that it seems that conspiracy theories seem to spawn, thrive, and multiply at a greater rate within the UFO-true-believer (and other paranormal belief) communities than in the general population. This is a stereotype (though stereotypes may, in fact, have a solid basis in objective reality) that at least suggests a level of delusion and paranoia- symptoms of serious thought disorders such as schizophrenia. So, in that sense, my comment does the same sort of disservice to giving the subject serious consideration as the examples mentioned in the article. I'll concede that to you.\n\nBut, it also reflects my general perception of the field of UFO research. As a kid, probably as many kids do, I became fascinated by all manner of unexplained phenomena. I read all I could find about the Loch Ness Monster, the Bermuda triangle, Bigfoot, ESP, the Roswell incident, the Tunguska event... you get the picture. So of course I was fascinated by stories of UFOs and alien visitation.\n\nI grew up to become a scientist with a background in neuroscience and psychology. Since those days as a kid I have come to have a much greater appreciation for the abilities, complexity- and fallibility- of the human mind. My intrinsic inquisitiveness and skeptical tendencies were further refined during years of schooling and lab work as I absorbed the most basic tenet of science: \"Show me the data\". In my field, if you give a talk and attempt to convince an audience of conclusions you have reached that have poor or no supporting evidence (such as what Mageant wrote) ... well, let's just say it won't go over very well, and you're liable to have your ass handed to you during the question session that typically follows. And because there is so much of that sort of unsubstantiated speculation among many of the most vocal and visible UFO proponents, serious scientists are less likely to engage with 'amateur researchers' and are unwilling to themselves commit to serious investigation in this area because association with 'wackos' and 'nutjobs' can damage one's own credibility. \n\nAnyway- it is not my intention to, as you put it \"irresponsibly discredit people who are interested in ufology\". I look forward to hearing what the official report says. I think it would be great if all credible claims could be thoroughly investigated using rigorous application of the scientific method. I'm skeptical as hell, but I'm interested. I completely believe that people perceive strange phenomena in the air and sky above us, but as yet I haven't seen anything so compelling as to make me seriously think this planet is being or has been visited by extraterrestrial intelligent life. This is probably more than you were expecting in response- it's more than I intended to write! ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1313702197", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I *truly* appreciate the thoughtful response, but I wasn't referring to your comment, but moreso Mageant's 2012-end-of-the-world babble that I'm really quite fed up with.\n\nWith that said, I think skepticism is healthy and completely necessary especially when attempting to wrap our heads around such a poorly understood phenomena such as UFOs. There is certainly no smoking gun that I know of that nails the phenomena to the wall, but there has been [considerable interest](http://keyholepublishing.com/Leading-UFO-Documents.html) by our own government (and many others around the world) to get to the bottom of what's happening in our skies. Some have even conducted [full-scale studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMETA) with very interesting conclusions.\n\nI can claim that there is corroborating radar evidence to what some of these expert witnesses have allegedly seen, but again, without a smoking gun we'll run ourselves in circles with possibilities. It's just unfortunate, IMO, that many have taken the stance that UFOs are even in the same category as the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot or even religion. Also IMO, there is ample evidence to conclude that *something* is happening in our skies, but we do not yet have the data to prove *what* is happening.  Skeptics tend to shy away from or ridicule the UFO debate because it's still a very, very taboo subject [no thanks to our own government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Panel#Conclusions_and_the_Robertson_Panel_Report).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1313703671", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

In case you're too lazy, the gist is that gnosticism and agnosticism are positions relating to **knowledge** while theism and atheism are positions relating to **belief**.\n\n&gt;If we don't identify our selfs with words for not being sure about Big Foot, Nessie, or UFOs, then why are we doing it for gods?\n\nYou can very well apply the same word to those things as well.  You can be agnostic about Bigfoot, but there's plenty of solid evidence (going from what we know of biology) that a Bigfoot cannot exist... So it's also fairly easy to be gnostic in your disbelief of Bigfoot.\n\n&gt;Atheism - the belief that you don't believe anything until its true.\nYou're confusing \"atheism\" with \"skepticism\".  Atheism is the lack of belief in god(s).\n\n&gt;Agnosticism - \"well people a 1000 years ago said they saw gods and no one can ever prove that wrong or really know, so I am still on the fence about this one\"\n\nThis is not what agnosticism is.  Agnosticism merely states it's impossible to know with certainty.  I, for example, am an agnostic atheist.  I'm not an atheist because I've seen proof that God doesn't exist, I'm atheist because I've never seen proof that God exists, therefore I don't have any reason to... I can then assess with a fair amount of certaintly that God does not exist.\n\n&gt;There has not been a lick of factual proof that a deity has ever existed, so I am not going to support a claim that says they might.\n\nIf this is how you arrived at being an atheist, then, SURPRISE!!!

{"body": "I'll answer your questions in order, best i can:\n\n1) Paleo allows for any foods that man could have realistically eaten during the Paleolithic era, including roots, berries, etc.  Keto basically says stay under 50 net carbs, possibly lower and avoid ALL sugars, including fructose (fruit) and lactose (milk).  You can eventually add them back in sparingly, but even then these things should be treated as a treat, not an every day thing.\n\n2) I believe the carbs you take in still trigger an insulin response, but a very small one.  Again, you're trying to deliberately avoid sugars.  When you do eat carbs, you'll probably want to eat low glycemic index carbs.  Or, if you're lazy like me...just green veggies.\n\n3) There's not a TON of sugar in cream.  I avoid milk and drink unsweetened vanilla flavored almond milk when the need strikes me.  As for cream, i really like cream, but you're not going to guzzle it, most likely.  Once in a great while i'll have a cup of cream for a dessert (ice, cup of heavy cream, a can of diet a&amp;w rootbeer and a packet of stevia in a blender...holy crap!).  There are 7 grams of carbs in a cup of heavy cream.  For me...WORTH IT!!!\n\n4)  I don't always eat grass fed beef.  I do if its available, but i don't always have money to buy a side of beef.  When i do, i'm fortunate enough to know a local guy who raises cows on the side (he lives in the country...he doesn't farm, but has a few cows and he \"lets me in\" once a year).  When the cash is low or my supply runs out...i'm off to sam's club or hilander (in the midwest states here).\n\n5)  Below 5% carbs and below 50net carbs.  Also you don't want the carbs to be more than 10% of your daily caloric intake.  Beyond that, don't go crazy.  If you're going to try something new, add ONLY that one thing and see how you react.\n\nA friend of mine found a low carb pancake recipe.  So she made it, ate it and got out of ketosis.  Turns out, she also had sugar free pancake syrup and strawberries.  All of which were new foods for her...no idea which one knocked her out.  Avoid sugars, but in extreme moderations, you might be able to add them in.\n\nMe?  I've had 2 servings of blackberries in the 2 months i've been in keto and that's it for fruit.  Although i've been eyeballing my daughter's strawberries in the fridge lately. :)\n\nEDIT--\nPS One more thing...i would highly recommend eating alot more.  Especially early on.  Induction is bad enough you don't need to be dealing with hunger pangs too.  Lots of beef bouillon (3 cups a day maybe?) will add salt which will help with keto flu A LOT.\n\nRemember, this is a carb restriction diet, not a caloric one.  Eat as much as you need to.  If you're not losing, we can deal with the calories later.  As a reference, i ate 1700 calories for dinner alone last night (in one sitting).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314718093", "subreddit": "keto", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}
