{"body": "in reply to number 2: God, as well as any other supernatural belief is an unfalsifiable hypothesis because of its supernatural characteristics. Science only deals with the natural, and the more science finds the more traditional beliefs about how everything works from the origins of life and the universe become debunked, as they show that nothing natural needs a supernatural being in order to exist. However the christian god is the one of the most easily disproved gods because of the history of the judeo-christian faith which borrows heavily from other earlier religions to the point that it's plagiarism. Do you believe in horus or osiris of the ancient egyptian religion? How about dionysus, mithras, or hercules? Those stories as well as several others combined have literally everything that makes up the story of jesus christ in the new testament.  It's not a leap of faith to be skeptical, in fact it's the exact opposite.  The word faith literally means to believe in something without knowledge of it.  So I propose that it would take a lot less faith to believe in someone's recent UFO, yeti, loch ness monster or ghost sighting than it does to believe someone saw a guy rise from the dead and wrote it down 2,000 years ago.  If you apply a small amount of questioning to each incident than it becomes easy to discount them, and if the evidence is inconclusive a rational person does not 'leap' to conclusions.  Why don't I believe in some other god besides the christian god? Because there's too many man-made religions to go through I haven't the time, plus its just no use and it does nothing for me (even when I was catholic) or anyone else, except a large amount of people think it does, and they argue back and forth which bronze-age bogus religious dogma makes more sense than the next until some of them kill each other.  It's better to argue that none of them are real because the a real god would just show himself and end this nonsense.  But that would just be my idea of what a god would do, which is an example to show that everyone's idea of a god is real just a mirror image of themselves manifested into their own 'reality' by their subconscious, which is why an individual's 'god' is always in line with the individual's personal beliefs which accounts for the diversity of religions and religious sects.  It's more wise to say \"I don't know\" than to make something up and then believe in it, which is just the bi-product of a self-inflated ego.\n\ntl;dr God is an unfalsifiable hypothesis because the belief is supernatural. the bible is plagiarized fiction. It's not a leap of faith to be skeptical-it's the opposite, every god throughout history is just a projection people's subconscious,", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1314986904", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Abstract:\n\n&gt;Low-carbohydrate diets, notably the Atkins Diet, were particularly popular in Britain and North America in the late 1990s and early 2000s. On the basis of a discourse analysis of bestselling low-carbohydrate diet books, I examine and critique genetic and evolutionary explanations for obesity and diabetes as they feature in the low-carbohydrate literature. Low-carbohydrate diet books present two distinct neo-Darwinian explanations of health and body-weight. First, evolutionary nutrition is based on the premise that the human body has adapted to function best on the diet eaten in the Paleolithic era. Second, the thrifty gene theory suggests that feast-or-famine conditions during human evolutionary development naturally selected for people who could store excess energy as body fat for later use. However, the historical narratives and scientific arguments presented in the low-carbohydrate literature are beset with generalisations, inconsistencies and errors. These result, I argue, from the use of the primitive as a discursive âblank slateâ onto which to project ideals perceived to be lacking in contemporary industrialised life.\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\n&gt;Christine Knight completed her PhD on primitivism in the low-carbohydrate diet movement at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, in 2008. The project was jointly supported by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Since then she has been employed as Policy Research Fellow at the ESRC Genomics Policy and Research Forum, University of Edinburgh, where she has a remit in knowledge exchange and public engagement. Her research interests lie at the intersection of literary and cultural studies, food studies, and science and technology studies.\n\nEdit: I encourage you to read [Laugh_Fin's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k7mwv/most_people_are_simply_not_designed_to_eat_pasta/c2i7ve9) for a better understanding of what the above copypasta means.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315410631", "subreddit": "science", "score": 21, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, first of all, your conclusion that democracy is tyrannical doesn't follow from the definition. Democracy is _not_ arbitrary, nor does it have unconstrained power. This is a complete non-sequitur. You basically don't like rules imposed on you, so you call it tyranny.\n\nSecondly, you're the one who rejected utilitarianism. I'm not arguing that they are mutually exclusive, I'm arguing against libertarian philosophy with utilitarianism. It's completely different. I'm arguing against your specific point that utilitarianism shouldn't be adhered to.\n\nAs for your general arguments about morality, they are all subjective. Your axioms are no more, or less, valid than my own. If you prefer deontological morality, that's fine, but understand that it isno more supported than utilitarianism. At least by the standards that you're arguing from. So even if we take the needs of the many to be a false statement because it's entirely subjective, we can therefore also take the individuals needs as being equally subjective. This ends at a stalemate where axioms get us nowhere. Your \"universal rules\" are no more dependable because they still require everybody to adhere to them. That's what it means to be universal. So it seems that in order for anarchism to work, you'd still need a majority of people to think and act like yourself. Oh, no. It's the tyranny of the majority.\n\n&gt;No, I'm not. But living in my an-cap society, I wouldn't associate myself with someone who took the fundamental position that slavery is okay in some forms, and based their actions upon it.\n\nReally? So the fundamental principle behind libertarianism and anarchism would be personal liberty, but if everybody isn't playing by your rules than you just wouldn't associate yourself with them? That's utter crap. You're basically saying that everybody has the freedom to own people. It's a contradictory statement that doesn't make any sense. People are so free that you would allow them to make other people less free.\n\n&gt;Deciding what I can do with my body is 'owning' me. The government says that I cannot inhale marijuana smoke; therefore I do not have complete control over my body; therefore I do not completely own my body;\n\nIf this is true, then you're already a slave anytime you deal with other people. True freedom is inaccessible to an individual by virtue of the fact that they must adhere to certain rules of conduct when dealing with other people. I know, it's the old \"my freedom to swing my fist ends at the tip of your nose\" argument, but I think it's especially important in this case. The fact that you need to accept some sort of rule diminishes the anarchist philosophy, as well as undeniably creating a contract between you and another person. Now, you might say that you enter this voluntarily, but the fact remains that pure freedom cannot exist in any capacity when dealing with more than one person.\n\nLet me ask you this. If you were the victim of a contagious, terminal disease, should you be quarantined against your will for the good of the group? Your right to act freely is mitigated by the needs of others, no matter if you wish it so or not. Your freedom **can** affect others, and as such some ruling body (whether it be a group, tribe, or government) can enforce restriction upon you.\n\n\n&gt;You are basically saying that since you can't imagine people protecting themselves from others without a government, that it couldn't or wouldn't happen. It can happen. It is possible, regardless of how unlikely you think it is, for people to protect themselves without gov't. I promise.\n\nI also don't believe in aliens visiting Earth, or unicorns, or the Loch Ness Monster. It's also possible that I spontaneously turn into a large bowl of jello, but I don't act as if it actually is going to happen. These doesn't constitute a fallacy from personal incredulity. The reasons behind people believing things are what's important, not necessarily the end result. You have given me no evidence as to why I should believe that people can protect themselves in a globalized/industrial world. Your big argument was \"It is possible. I promise.\"\n\n&gt;We humans, having been accustomed to statism for so long, haven't put a whole lot of effort into solving these technical problems so far, but there are academics/philosophers who have written about it. My argument that governments are not legitimate does not hinge on my having solved every problem. You certainly don't have solutions to all the problems associated with statism, and I don't expect you to.\n\nTwo things. Why have we been static for too long? And you (not specifically you) actually have to solve these problems before any kind of action takes place. The fact that there is a technical problem of such great magnitude that hasn't been solved yet is a great cause for concern. As I see it, you'd essentially need the entire world to agree with anarchist philosophy for any hope of success. You'd basically need to live without any form of external threat.\n\n&gt;It's not using history to understand human behavior that is the appeal to tradition, it's the solution offered to deal with said human behavior that is the appeal to tradition. We can objectively look at how people are, but we can come up with multiple solutions to deal with it, and then argue why each one would be better than the other. You think statism/government is the best solution for the problems inherent with human behavior, whereas I think statelessness/market anarchism is the best solution.\n\nHere't the problem. You're assuming that human nature is \"wrong\" and that it can be changed. It's a mistake that utopian idealism makes consistently. Human nature is human nature. Democracy works within the framework of human nature, anarchism doesn't. Unless you have some way of changing our biology to reduce aggressiveness and selfishness, anarchism is nothing more than a fairy tale with no basis in reality. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1315599675", "subreddit": "gue", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Like you, I got interested in the paranormal as a child. I remember it starting when my father made an off-hand comment about the Loch Ness Monster that sent me looking for any book I could find on the subject. Ghost stories and tales of death omens where also commonly heard around the house.\n\nAliens/UFOs: Possible. Especially a more interesting topic in light of the discovery of Super Earth orbiting Gliese 581. I like to believe that the origin for most UFOs misidentification or even sightings of experimental craft. I think those who claim to have been abducted by aliens are either mistaken, delusional, or outright liars. My state is actually the home of the first recorded alien abduction, but the entire scenario seems quite contrived.\n\nI find cryptozoology to be more believable than other facets of the paranormal. It does have its fair share of carnival barkers and shysters like C. Thomas Biscardi and the clowns on that Destination Truth show. Things like the Chupacabra or anything else that resembles an X-Files monster of the week are just ridiculous. Don't get me started on \"Rods\". \n\nI believe psi exists. Governments and independent scientists of repute have dumped money, time, and manpower into investigating it's existence and the practical applications of it with startling results. Myself, I regularly experience psi phenomena. I find it's not as bombastic as claiming to see dead people, moving objects with thoughts, or other horse shit like that. It's a lot more subtle like picking up \"vibes\" off of people, places, and things, premonitory dreams, or the usage of paraphernalia (runes, cards, etc.).\n\nI tend to avoid ghosts since the entire field of inquiry is so full of con artists, bullshitters, and attention-seekers. I used to go ghost hunting with friends and even entertained the idea of starting a research society. I lost interest after one too many outings with a kid who claimed to be a medium and had these tacky woo-woo New Age sentiments attached to his performances .

{"body": "I firmly do not believe in Cryptozoology. I find it plausible that a certain animal could be born with birth defects and cause urban legends such as chupacabra, but I do not believe that creatures such as bigfoot exist at all. There is too much technology for a creature, especially on the scale of bigfoot, to have eluded mankind for so long. If any animal of the sort existed, it would have been captured and studied. Not only that, but I find it ridiculous to think that certain dinosaurs, such as Nessie, would still be alive to this day. By now, that creature would have reproduced millions of times, unless you are suggesting imortal dinosaurs are walking around. Reproduction is the number one reason I don't believe in cryptozoology. Death is number two. In all this time how many dead bigfoots have been found? How many dead Nessies have washed ashore? If we are talking about the ocean, then Nessie is plausible, because of the shear depth of the ocean and the amount of undiscovered creatures.\n\nI firmly believe in Aliens. The universe is so large that the odds are in favor of life on other planets. Though, I don't believe that they have visited earth in hundreds of years, if at all. \n\nGhosts are tricky. I believe ghosts are possible because energy cannot be destroyed.

But it's a valid study every time an undiscovered new species is found...and that happens every week....a new dolphin species was just found near Australia. It's hard not to believe in that. The mountain gorilla, platypuses, giant squid are examples of animals thought to be fake or mythical that all turned out to be real. When people came back from Australia and described the animals they saw it went like this: Two headed, upright beast, that walked like a man and jumped like a frog....sounds crazy, but it's just a kangaroo. Like you are saying, sometimes these things aren't as crazy as they seem, but if you've never seen one, describing it is difficult. I understand you have a hard time believing in some of the major creatures like Bigfoot or Nessie and such, but that's not the only thing that cryptozoology studies.

{"body": "&gt;What convinced you that God doesn't exist? \n\nI've always been an atheist. It's not that something convinced me that god didn't exist, it's the fact that nothing has convinced me to the contrary. Now, I do believe that there are no gods, but that's besides the point of atheism. \n\nI find the very concept of a deity counter-intuitive, and nothing much than wishful thinking. My understanding of the world, philosophy etc. has cumulatively convinced me that there is no such thing as a deity.\n\nThere's nothing supporting such a concept (at least nothing that stands up to scrutiny), and mountains upon mountains of arguments against it.\n\n&gt;It doesn't seem like a fair stance or even a default stance to not believe in the non-existence of God because of a few stupid followers. \n\nThat's not what makes it the default stance. The default stance is not holding a belief in something. Even infants are atheists because they haven't even been introduced to the concept of a god. They aren't born with a belief. \n\nJust like in a court of law, you don't start off with the position that the defendant is guilty. You start off not believing the claim that the defendant is guilty until it has been proven otherwise. That's the default position. \n\n&gt;I realize this is not you, but I don't think you can define Atheist as a group as quickly as you did.\n\nI never defined atheism as a group. In fact, I stated the very opposite. Atheism is a non-position. It's not a group. The 'atheist' label is descriptive, unlike religious denominations, which is subscriptive. There are no common factors at all among atheists in their entirety. We are no more a group than the people not believing in Santa Claus are one.\n\n&gt;Do you require complete proof beyond all possible doubts to prove the existence of God?\n\nI require proof beyond all *reasonable* doubt, which is the same standard I have for more or less everything else. \n\n&gt;I believe that a more default position is not knowing whether to believe in God or not, because there is the possibility he does or doesn't exist.\n\nBut there do exist evidence, which is why I can believe one way or another. There also exists a possibility that leprechauns, unicorns, flying saucers, big foot, the abominable snow man, the loch ness monster etc. etc. are real, but there's plenty of evidence against it. Until anyone has produced a shred of evidence to support those claims, I am quite happy in maintaining that they do not exist. \n\nI'm not claiming that there's definitely no god. However, given the amounts of evidence against it, I find it reasonable to assume it doesn't. What's important is not that I believe that there is no god. I think you'll find that, upon further investigation, people that claim to be neutral on the issue necessarily lean one way or the other. What's important is that I am willing to re-evaluate my position based on new evidence.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1316798860", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; So basically, it seems one of the tenets of Atheism is that you don't believe in religion because there is no proof. \n\n1. Atheism isn't a noun so you shouldn't capitalize it any more than you should capitalize the words \"theism\", \"agnosticism\", \"nihilism\" etc.\n2. Atheism has no tenets. It is simply a word used to describe those who, for whatever reason, lack a belief in a deity.\n3. When dealing with matters of the universe, we don't generally care about *proof*. We care about *evidence* and *reason*. The lack of any reasonable evidence is certainly one of the most *common* reasons for people to lack a belief in a deity, but it is by no means the *only* reason.\n\n&gt; Can't the idea be reversed and applied against atheists by christians\n\nNo, because atheism doesn't necessarily make any assertions so there is nothing that lacks any proof or evidence. You can certainly say that there is no evidence that God *doesn't* exist. Now, aside from the fact that, for given definitions of God, there actually is, that is not a valid argument. There is also no proof that the flying spaghetti monster *doesn't* exist; there is no proof that redneck abducting aliens *don't* exist; there is no proof that the Loch Ness monster *doesn't* exist; there is no proof that unicorns *don't* exist; there is no proof that [Russell's Teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot) *doesn't* exist. The teapot, in fact, was designed to address this exact thing:\n\n\"*Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense.*\"\n\n&gt; Can religion, or at least deism, be proven wrong by the simple fact that we don't know anything?\n\nIn what way?\n\n&gt; If science is about finding a logic answer to a question, and the question is something like \"how did the universe come into being?\", where we don't really know the answer, can a deist be wrong by asserting the idea that a supernatural being made the universe\n\nThey might not necessarily be wrong, but they would certainly be guilty of asserting things which they have no business asserting without providing reasoning to support their claims. It's at this point that we must ask them to demonstrate their assertions.\n\n&gt; when atheists assert the idea that it was all by random chance\n\nI'm not sure where people keep getting this idea that the position of science is that everything just happens by random chance. If that were true, science wouldn't be possible. Science works because everything *doesn't* just happen by random chance! Everything in fact appears to behave fairly predictably. Even in the chaotic world of quantum mechanics, probabilistic predictions are very accurate.\n\n&gt; both assertions have no real substance behind them\n\nWhat assertion do scientists or atheists make that has no real substance behind it?\n\n----\n\nYou should watch this vide, [Lack of belief in gods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDZb0KtJDk).

Because it's fun.\n\nI think that's what a lot of these beliefs boil down to sometimes. Cryptids are not the same as ghosts, where someone can hinge their belief in the afterlife on them. I'm not saying that most people who believe don't take it seriously, and I can tell you that I do honestly believe that many of these people think they have actually seen one of these monsters. What I am saying is that it's a hobby, something to do, as pointless as many other hobbies.. just weirder. And that's perfectly ok.\n\nI've been involved in some way shape or form with paranormal investigation since I was 12, mostly by accident, and in that time I have met a lot of people involved in a lot of different \"weird\" hobbies, and it usually boils down to the fact that a lot of these people are lonely outcasts, not much education, poor social skills, etc. These kinds of outlets allow them to have something that makes them unique, something that makes them special. As you can imagine, they cling to it  pretty hard. There is a sense of community with believers in the unprovable, with all the good and bad it implies.\n\nI have seen a few, not many, but a few strange things during my time spent with these people.

{"body": "Note: I wrote this as I read through your comment, so the first long part includes some rehashing (and clarification) of things you later wrote.\n\n&gt;If it was merely a lack of belief, it would be Agnostic. Atheism is distinct from that.\n\nAgnostic is not knowing. Specifically, \"a religious orientation of doubt; a denial of ultimate knowledge of the existence of God\". An agnostic says they don't know if there are gods and no one can know. An atheist says they do not believe in the existence of gods. It's the difference between asking someone if they're coming to dinner and them answering \"I don't know if I will\" versus \"I do not believe I will\".\n\nAs Penn Jillette stated, \"I believe that there is no God. I'm beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God.\"\n\nWhat you are describing as your \"religious\" version of atheism is referred to as strong atheism. Strong atheists are those who not only don't believe in gods but who actively assert that there are no gods. At that point, that is a belief. At that point, that is a leap of faith. At that point, that can be construed as a religious statement. The vast majority of atheists are not strong atheists. They are what some describe as weak atheists, or atheists that simply don't believe in any gods and make no assertion about the existence of such things. This lack of assertion in no way impacts their lives, just like my lack of assertion that the Loch Ness Monster does not exist does not impact my life. I don't believe it does, but I don't state it does not.\n\nIn order for me to move from a neutral playing field on any subject (one of not believing until swayed one way or the other), I have to be provided with evidence one way or the other. I believe in atoms because I've obtained evidence that they exist. I believe in evolution because I've obtained evidence that it exists. I do not believe there is a floating teapot in space because I have not seen evidence that it exists. I don't assert that there is not a floating teapot in space because I haven't seen evidence it does not exist either. This does not make me an agnostic as I feel that there is a way for man to ultimately determine if there is a Loch Ness Monster, a Bigfoot, and a god. I simply don't believe in any of them until evidence of their existence is obtained.\n\n&gt;It might be true for yourself, but your beliefs do not apply to Atheism in general.\n\nAtheism in general is like mine. You're lumping all atheists in with those who are strong atheists simply because the majority of atheists who are outspoken or get attention are those strong atheists. Don't fall victim to the Westboro Baptist phenomena. Westboro Baptists may get tons of press because they are outspoken and loud, but that does not mean that Christianity in general wants soldiers to die in order to punish the world for homosexuality. Strong atheism is an extreme outlook that is shared by plenty of people, just like Evangelistic Christianity, but that doesn't mean that's the definition of atheism and that doesn't mean that most atheists are that way.\n\n&gt;Let's work with a couple of specific types of Atheism, for clarity. First, there is the group that could be defined as Anti-Theist. In short, they look at the personification of deities, usually in the Western culture and say, \"That's bullshit.\" It is not sufficient in this case to say that they have a lack of belief, but rather that they have an active belief that religion, as it has been presented to them, is wrong. This belief may be defended with logic and reasoning, but in the case of Anti-Theists, by nature of their opposition to the belief in God, they go beyond saying \"there is no evidence to support it\" and a mere lack of belief. In this case, the term religion applies because of the active belief that the supernatural is hokum, and the focus is on that subject matter. I do not get the impression that you fall into this group.\n\nAs I'm responding while reading your comment, it appears you've covered the same ground I did.\n\n&gt;There might be a bit more flexibility in this definition that you may be comfortable with, but this definition allows for belief in scientific theories which have not yet been confirmed, such as string theory, for example. I think it is fair to say that this is the group in which you reside. There is a clear system of belief here that is based on concrete evidence and logic. The fact that the beliefs are lacking in the subject of the supernatural is an important distinction, certainly. This does not preclude it from falling within multiple definitions of the term religion.\n\nIt does not preclude it any more than precluding your belief that when you press the 'E' key on your keyboard, you will type the letter 'E' on your screen falls under the definition of the term \"religion\". If my belief in physically observable facts and logical conclusions from those facts denotes me as being a member of a religion, then every single person who does anything with a logical expectation of its result is a member of this same religion. I believe in evolution for the same reason I believe that if I were to buy a Chevy Corvette, it would go 160 miles per hour. I can't say that I've personally done it, but there's a whole lot of evidence that supports that this is the  logical conclusion. For this to be deemed a religion seems silly to me because, I guess, this religion would be labeled \"reality\". Sure, I guess we can call it a religion, but if every single self-aware person that ever existed is a member whether they would like to be or not, it seems a tad pointless.\n\n&gt;So if only a few of the definitions apply, how do we reflect that in our terminology? Is a modifier required? Do we call it half of a religion, or a pseudoreligion? Frankly, that sounds insulting to me, as pseudoscience is a joke. No, in this case just the word 'religion' is used, as is the case with any other word with multiple definitions. This does not mean that it is being equated with other religions that do apply to most or all of the definitions of the word 'religion'.\n\nI agree that it's not a pseudoreligion to be atheist. I'm even willing to agree that being a strong atheist requires an asserted belief that could be construed as one of a religious nature. However, someone who simply does not believe is atheist and is not religious. Atheism, at its defined core, is not religious. Those who take it further, those who do more than not believe can be deemed to have a religious set of beliefs, but those who simply don't believe, those are not religious individuals and they're not meeting any of the definitions of a religion.\n\n&gt;Also, as an aside, lack of a coherent organization in no way disqualifies a set of beliefs as being a religion.\n\nPlenty of people are religious without belonging to a specific church. I apologize if I ever gave the impression that organization was a required part of religion.\n\n&gt;As a further aside, there is a subset within Hinduism that are Atheist with no conflicts in terms. It's interesting to read about, but not really on topic.\n\nSort of. [As you can read](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism_in_Hinduism), there are two \"sects\" of Hinduism which do not believe in gods, but one believes in \"spirits\" throughout the world while the other believes in \"karmas\". Both of these would be supernatural forces in the eyes of a scientist, so while they are not believing in supreme beings, they are believing in supernatural forces. This is kind of the equivalent of saying I'm atheist but I believe we all have ghosts. By definition, again, they are atheist. They would simply be a different sector of atheism that happens to believe in other supernatural systems instead.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317407901", "subreddit": "self", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I'm sorry but what was that you just said?\n\nSimplified: You imagined something that exists but has absolutely no observable effect on anything. If you're imagining something that has no evidence of existence, it doesn't exist. \n\n&gt;Why is empirical data your method of deciding what is true and what isn't even though it is based on two formal fallacies?\n\nObservable, testable, repeatable evidence and results is how to determine if something is true. Again, you can believe, or \"know\" whatever you'd like however you'd like. You just don't know if it's true or not without having observable, testable, repeatable results.  \n\n&gt;Religion has bent of the centuries to adapt to society, even though it may not be at the rate you would like it to be.\n\nI agree!\n\n&gt;it too would probably become organised in some way.\n\nYes, I could imagine it. I think violent religious people do the things they do because it's human nature (and religious excuses, divisions and direction provide a motivating factor). However, humans have always been quite violent for a variety of reasons. Perhaps it could be for some atheist cause. I do think a lot of modern atheism is actually an intellectual rejection of blindly following anything, though. If atheists then coalesced into some ideology that put theism as an evil cause worth of violence, I see that as no different than any other type of dogma or religious violence and would have exactly the same views on it.\n\n&gt;these laws are not needed to be followed as of the new covenant, or new laws, post the the death of Christ.\n\nAh, *interpretation*. Much of the old testament is still followed in much of modern Christianity, and only the inconvenient parts are removed as seen fit in whatever the contemporary society might be. Christians have used such verses to kill accused non-believers and non-Christians plenty of times previously. Again, as I mentioned, reason seems to eventually prevail and eliminate the religious nonsense. Therefore those verses are eventually \"interpreted\" out.\n\nFrankly the Bible is so self-contradictory you can interpret in or out just about anything you want (people can, and do, of course), rendering it simply a product of whatever person is doing the interpretation. Add to that the belief the the interpretation is divinely inspired and you have quite a powerful force.\n\n More recently the verses against women and slaves have been interpreted out by many mainstream denominations, for example. I'm sure more will be interpreted out in the future as religions is further eroded by reason. \n\n&gt;Why don't you simply state that since you have no way of knowing about the existence of God, that you \"don't understand\"?\n\nBINGO!!! I don't say that I know that God doesn't exist! It's a negative position. It's theists who claim knowledge. I say there's no good evidence of supernatural claims in any religion, and therefore I don't believe them. It's the same reason I don't believe that there are faeries in my garden or there's a Loch Ness Monster: there's nothing to support those positions. It would be silly to believe something there's no evidence of, much less base one's entire life around it. The same proves true for religion or an the existence of an all-powerful creator being that was discovered by a bronze age nomadic desert tribal people.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317415359", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
