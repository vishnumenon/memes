{"body": "&gt;I've already told how empiricism is flawed\n\nPlease share your improved method of determining factuality, better than observable, testable, repeatable outcomes. Really, there is none. Our understanding of reality constantly improves through observation, testing and repetition.\n\n&gt;this isn't just interpretation\n\nMany Chiristians rely upon and interpret both the New and Old Testaments, and quote from both. If you need examples, I'd be happy to provide. \n\nIn fact early on many \"Christians\" argued about the question of the divinity of Jesus. Check out the [First Council of Nicea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) (or other subsequent early councils), [Arianisn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism), etc. However I find interpretation vs. non-interpretation about as productive as arguing over how many angels fit on the head of a pin.\n\n&gt;If someone said it didn't exist\n\nIn fact I understand quite well, it's just not how you're used to framing the situation (I think I should clarify: my position is not \"negative\", merely \"null\"): I'm saying there's no evidence to suggest existence, and that's not a good reason to believe something, particularly something as life-altering as a religion. \n\nFor example: If I were to tell you that there was an enormous asteroid headed for Earth sometime in the future and you'd better start digging a hole so you're safe, it's my job to convince you of the fact. If I can provide absolutely no evidence to support my assertion, it's not your job to believe it unless you can prove me wrong. Furthermore, if you don't start digging a hole, you're not basing any actions on your beliefs. You're simply not acting on a statement for which there is no evidence.\n\n&gt;There's no evidence to suggest the non-existence of God either.\n\nThe fallacy of [Argument from Ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance). Again, though there's no evidence of Loch Ness Monster (I'm just fond of the rascal if he were real...), just because there's no evidence so suggest the non-existence of Loch Ness Monster doesn't mean that I should believe in Loch Ness Monster. The burden of proof rests on those that proposed the factuality of the Loch Ness Monster to produce good evidence. Same for religion.\n\n&gt;Isn't that what belief in all things is, including atheism\n\nAtheism is not a belief, it's an absence of belief. \n\nI think this has run its logical course, so let me add my personal opinion at this point: In the end, people don't have religious beliefs because they find them factually correct. Fact require proof. Faith is belief without proof. \n\nI find people believe in religion for a wide variety of other reasons: It provides them with community; their family shares the belief and it would alienate them to change; they've based much of their world view on the belief and it would be stressful to have to change; it provides the with security, knowing there is some sort of ultimate order; it makes them feel better thinking they will have life after death; there are society pressures to conform; they don't want to admit they were incorrect.\n\nNot believing has little to offer, other than reason and clarity. Non-belief is not necessarily comforting or easy. Perhaps some atheists find it great or comforting to not believe in an afterlife. I am not one of them. However, I'm rational. I have to apply the same standards to religious belief as I do to any other element of the world around me.\n\nI'm also conscious of the effects of a profound change in beliefs. I think for those that are heavily invested in their beliefs, a shift can be traumatic. Therefore, I don't take leading people away from their beliefs lightly. \n\nYou as well and thanks so much for being so friendly, intelligent and cordial! I'm from the States and perhaps feel the effects of religious adherence in a different way than you lucky Brits... I think that can affect an atheist's attitude towards the urgency of addressing organized religious beliefs as well.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317435279", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "I believe in El Chupacabra because I've seen one.\n\nA few years ago some friends and I were driving through the southern portion of Arizona. We were on a long road trip, so two of us were sleeping in the back while two of us where in the front. My friend was driving and I was in the passenger seat just keeping him company, picking music and making sure he didn't fall asleep.\n\nIt was probably around 1 a.m. and we were on a highway next to a large cliff to our right. There were no other cars on the road. Suddenly, something leaped out of the darkness to our left and landed in the road directly in front of the headlights. It sort of stopped for a second and then jumped back off the road and off the cliff.\n\nIt had large hind legs and smaller front ones. It was definitely naked and bald all over - no hair from what I could see. It's skin was a light brown color, maybe a little gray mixed in. It looked eerily human like, but also had animal qualities. It had no hair on its head, small, beady eyes and gnarled teeth. I'm not sure what the hell it was, but I call it a Chupacabra as I'm not sure what else to categorize it as.\n\nAs far as Bigfoot goes, its certainly possible, but until there is hard evidence such as a body, it'll never be something I 100 percent believe in. \n\nThe Loch Ness Monster was a hoax IMO.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1317453939", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Other weapons and changes:\n\nThe Demoman got an Eyelander reskin called **Nessie's Nine Iron**, which looks like a golf club.  The Pyro got an Axtinguisher reskin called the **Postal Pummeler**, which looks like a large mailbox.\n\nDr. Grordbort's Victory Pack was a set of 2 Soldier weapons modeled after some of the futuristic guns the WETA Workshop has built.\n\n**Cow Mangler 5000**: A Rocket Launcher with 5 shots that do 10% less damage.  The weapon uses no ammo; instead, it has a \"Mangler\" bar that shows how many shots you have.  The weapon reloads by cranking a handle on the side, and it reloads 5% slower than the other Rocket Launchers.  Alt-fire charges up a shot; this charged shot takes 4 seconds to fire, slows the Soldier down to 1/3 of his normal speed, and uses up all 5 of his shots, but in return, it has a higher base damage, is guaranteed to mini-crit the target, and also sets players on fire for 5 seconds.  If the charged shot hits an Engineer building, it'll be disabled for 4 seconds.  The downsides to the Mangler are 80% less damage vs. buildings, and you cannot be crit or be crit boosted by anything.  Another hidden feature (or maybe it's a bug) is that reflected shots from the Cow Mangler do full crit damage.\n\n**Righteous Bison**: A laser pistol with 4 shots that also requires no ammo.  It fires significantly slower than the Shotgun, and fires a moderately slow projectile that pierces enemies and buildings, but cannot be reflected.  The shot does about 20 base damage, but usually hits a player 2-3 times.  This weapon also does 80% less damage vs. buildings, but can randomly crit/be crit boosted.\n\nEnemies killed by either laser weapon suffer a unique disintegration effect, similar to killing enemies with an energy ball in Half Life 2.\n\nDeus Ex weapons:\n\nEngineer:\n\n**Widowmaker**: This weapon uses metal as ammo and doesn't have to reload.  Currently, a single shot costs 60 metal (soon to be reduced to 30), and any damage done is returned as metal.  It's a great tool for defensive Engineers, as sitting next to a Dispenser means you can fire many shots without ever having to reload.\n\n**Short Circuit**: This replaces the Engie's Pistol with what looks like a futuristic Taser on his arm.  It costs 35 metal to fire, but destroys any and all enemy projectiles in a certain range in front of the Engineer automatically.  The Short Circuit does practically no damage (5 base) and can't randomly crit, so it's an entirely defensive weapon.  Enemies killed (lol) by the Short Circuit are given the distinctive disintegration death, similar to the Grordbort weapons.\n\nSniper:\n\n**Machina**: A futuristic rifle that can't shoot without being scoped.  It also does 15% more damage and pierces targets on a fully-charged shot.  The downside is that it leaves a very distinct tracer leading right back to you every time you take a shot.\n\nSpy:\n\n**Diamondback**: A new Revolver that does the same base damage as the Ambassador.  Destroying an Engineer building gives you a guaranteed crit, similar to how the Frontier Justice works with Revenge crits.  It's a very good choice against Gunslinger Engineers, as many of them will just let their sapped gun die and throw down a new one.\n\nA cool thing about the Machina and Diamondback is that they actually have different firing sounds for different situations.  A fully charged Machina shot will have a deeper, more powerful sound, and getting multiple kills with the piercing shot will play a fanfare to the whole server.  The Diamondback has different sounds entirely, one for regular shots, and one for forced crits from sapping enemy buildings.\n\nThere are also Strange weapons.  They can only be uncrated from Series 19 crates and beyond, and they track the number of kills you make with them.  At a certain number of kills, they gain a new prefix; Strange is the first, then Unremarkable, then Scarcely Lethal, and so on.

I LOVED dinosaurs, and by the time I was six or seven I knew from the books my parents had lovingly bought me how many millions of years ago was the paleolithic era or the mesozoic era or whatnot. (I don't care very much for dinosaurs anymore: I remember the names of things, but not really what or when they were. Still, the best dinosaur is the [Ankylosaurus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vSY_rB928c).)\n\nI had to renounce all of my scientific knowledge, bit by bit, as my parents constantly reminded me that the whole \"millions and millions of years ago\" kind of stuff didn't really jive with Genesis, and that the dinosaurs went extinct because there wasn't room on the Ark. (Seriously.)\n\nAnyway, adopted fundamentalist ways and beliefs. Rejected rational inquiry as the Devil's temptations. Worried constantly that I would be devoured by Satan, who was in the habit of seeking whom he could devour. Went to a private school where we watched videos by the [Reverend Doctor Kent Hovind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind) during biology class.\n\nTo make an already long story less long, I go to college, have atheist friends, and for Xmas, I ask my folks for \"What's So Great About Christianity,\" by Dinesh D'Souza, at that time a prominent Christian apologist/papist/C.S. Lewis plagiarist in response to the Harris/Hitchens/Dawkins trifecta. \n\nBut in the book, D'Souza explained the theory of evolution by natural selection, and the Big Bang, and how they were an essential part of a modern Christian's interpretation of the bible, Genesis in particular. So here I was: confronting an apostate who I really wanted to cite to my non-religious friends. In any church I had ever been to, this man would have been a lure of the devil, trying to snag believers away from the Word of God.\n\nBetween that and Mark Twain and \"History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" by Edward Gibbons, it wasn't long before I dropped all the evangelical nonsense and reverted to my childhood state of scientific rationalism, where I happily remain. I'm still scared as fuck of hell, but I have a shrink for that. \n\ntl;dr- The work of a Christian apologist combined with science, literature and history to overwhelm a deeply ingrained religiosity.

In fact, in the same study that found more women than men believe in precognition, it turned out that more men than women believe in Big Foot and the Loch Ness monster. Seeing into the future is a woman's thing, tracking down chimerical monsters is a man's thing.

{"body": "Let's compare that to the typical skeptical response to other things. I mean, you mentioned:\n\n&gt; Ghosts, science, woo etc etc.\n\nLet's try substituting one of these in:\n\n\"I accept the question of ghosts is unanswerable, therefore I CHOOSE to believe they exist. Furthermore, I accept the question of whether that particular absurdly-bad-quality bit of film captured an actual ghost or whether there's a more rational explanation is *also* unanswerable, so yeah, I believe that, too. And while we're at it, the Loch Ness Monster also exists, since the question of whether it exists is unanswerable unless we drain the entire fucking lake.\"\n\nWhat makes God special in this case?\n\n&gt; He is willing to change his views if you show him otherwise and his choice does not define him. He will openly admit it is not a rational belief, but he wants to do it because it makes him feel better.\n\nAll of these things can apply equally to woo. My father knows what homeopathy is, and knows it's not rational to believe it works, but continues to take certain homeopathic remedies because they \"work for him.\" He may have good reason to do this -- after all, a faith-based placebo can still cause the body to heal itself, so I'm not sure I actually want to convince him that he's wrong -- but he's certainly not being a good skeptic, wouldn't you say?\n\n&gt; I think such a person can still be a good skeptic. He will follow evidence based views in everything else...\n\nWell, certainly. A scientist can also be a good scientist, despite believing all sorts of crazy things Sunday mornings -- or, hell, even believing stuff like Homeopathy -- so long as he can leave those at the door when it comes to actual research.\n\nEven so...\n\n&gt; just in this one thing he disagrees with most skeptics.\n\nBut again, unless there's some reason God is special, we're back where we started. \"Oh, I'm a skeptic, too! I'm skeptical of Bigfoot, Nessie, and ghosts. I'm also skeptical of big pharmaceutical companies, and I like alternative medicine. I guess I just disagree with the skeptical community on *this one thing.*\"\n\nNow, I suppose I agree with Hal Bidlack in that we should not be deriding deist skeptics, we shouldn't be telling them \"You can't be a skeptic,\" or \"You can't debunk other woo.\" But at the same time, I don't see why their deism should be immune to the same skepticism we apply to the claims of, say, Christian Science.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318266458", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

It is extremely well written and a lot of kids of my university use it to supplement (or replace) our in class material. If you know High School level math, this will take you through all the calculus and linear algebra you'll need to know. Calculus 1+2 should go first, then you can choose calc III or differential equations, and I would probably suggest learning those before Linear Algebra (not because you couldn't learn linear algebra without them, but because it is good to have completed those four calculus classes before moving on). \n\n\nOn the physics side, Intro to Mechanics, Intro to E&amp;M, and Intro to modern physics are the basics of all you need. If you could get your hands on a copy of University Physics by Young and Freedman that would be ideal, as it covers all these topics in one long book (typically taught in three semesters at university). The book is $200, but I hear the internet has a way to provide the book AND solutions for about tree fiddy or less. \n\nIf you follow this book, I would suggest Calc I (and maybe II) before intro to Mechanics, Calc III before Intro to E&amp;M (not necessary, but definitely very helpful) and differential eq before Intro to Modern Physics. Also be aware that if you look into any physics after this, you will need to have taught yourself linear algebra.\n\nAt least, these cover virtually all the pre-reqs at my and many other universities before you can take quantum mechanics, the last pre requisite before particle physics and cosmology. \n\n\nedit: Calc of one variable is Calc I, II, and Differential Equations.

If you can kill twice, you are golden. The grenade launcher, if you can be good, can get you a lot of early damage to decap with. Useful, but you need to make sure you are going to land those hits.\n* **Scotsman's Skullcutter**: Larger melee range, more damage, but slower? Getting into their base and then rack up the kills. A Eyelander will get less damage, but faster as time goes on. If you are less sure of your abilities, I would say this is going to be a better weapon.\n* **Claidheamh Mòr**: That increased charge duration? Not happening. Lack of health, no criticals... the only thing going for it is the +37% melee range. Eyelander is surely better.\n* **Half-Zatoichi**: Full health on a kill? Useful. Can't switch? Not so much. You better make sure you are on your game, and hope that you're able to kill as many people as you can.\n* **Persian Persuader**: No random criticals? Meh. Halves the time needed to charge? Worthless. All ammo as HP? Might be useful. After a kill, pick up their weapons to get HP. I would say that the Half-Zatoichi is better in this case though, since this requires you to lose your stick bombs (not a big deal) but then also have to contend with picking weapons up.\n\nAnd non-Demoknight weapons:\n\n* **Bottle/Scottish Handshake/Frying Pan/Conscientious Objector/Saxxy**: Beat the crap outta 'em. You have basic melee range, so unless you can be a stealth demo (coupled with the 'nade launcher), you're probably screwed.\n* **Pain Train**: You are weak to bullets. So... Scout, Heavy, Engie, Sniper, and Spy. Enemies. But you can cap quicker! So if made use of well enough, you can cap before they know what hit them.\n* **Ullapool Caber**: Suicide? Yes. Basically all you have at that point. You get 1 kill basically. Hope that you kill, and then get out of there. Might possibly be the only one where the Ali Baba's Wee Booties/Bootlegger is better than the Grenade Launcher. But just by a bit.\n\nNow let's look at Primaries:\n\n* **Grenade Launcher**: Lots of shots, pills hurt -- in the right hands, quite deadly. But that's a demoman anyways, right?\n* **Loch-n-Load**: A \"better\" Grenade Launcher, but you need to be much more accurate. Only use if you are totally sure you can hit.\n* **Ali Baba's Wee Booties/Bootlegger**: Increases health by 25 (and increases charge turning by 100%, but that's worthless). Useful? +25HP is always useful. You will be without ranged ability. I hope that 25 HP can save you more than a Grenade Launcher can. Stick with the Grenade Launcher or Loch-n-Load so you won't die as much.\n\nPersonally? Stick with the Grenade Launcher. And for melee, I'd say Half-Zatoichi or Scotsman's Skullcutter, only because I can't demoknight.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318735499", "subreddit": "tf2", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**The Soldier Overview**\n\nThe soldier has a high health pool(200HP) but is a relatively slow class.  He is capable of using any of this banners in addition to his melee weapon.  The soldier's place in medieval mode is often limited, due to his inability to easily overcome his speed issue, and the amount of effort required to fully charge his banners.\n\nThat being said, the banners, once they are charged, are incredibly powerful in medieval mode.\n\nThe soldier's melee weapons generally do not Synergize with his secondaries, so I will not cover loadouts, rather I will cover the weapons individually.\n\n**Banners**\n\n* Buff Banner:  Grants mini-crits to you and your team.  Synergizes well with Bushwhacka snipers.  Coordinate with your snipers and push/defend with this banner.  Every hit they land will deal 195 damage while you have it active.\n\n* Battalion's Backup:  Grants immunity to crits and a sizable damage reduction bonus.  In medieval mode, this is good for pushes, since the crit rate for melee hits is significantly higher(15-25%) than ranged attacks(2-12%)\n\n* The Cohncheror:  Grants healing to your team when they hit enemy players.  Similar to Mad Milk's functionality, but it applies to all nearby team mates, rather than a single, or group of enemies.\n\n**Melee Weapons**\n\n* The Disciplinary Action:  The Soldier's \"Long Range\" melee weapon.  It has a 70% larger reach, but deals 20% less damage.  It also helps the Soldier overcome his speed issues without injuring himself, but he will need the assistance of another team mate to do it.  Striking another player with this(friendly) will increase both your speed and their speed.  Synergizes well with heavies, who also tend to have speed problems.\n\n* The Half-Zatoichi:  Any enemy killed with this weapon fully restore's the soldier's (or demo's) health.  In terms of surviving, this is the soldier's best bet in the melee slot.  The major downside is that anyone else wielding a half-zatoichi can one-hit kill you, which you can also do to them.  You cannot switch to your banners until after you have killed someone with this weapon.\n\n* The Pain Train:  This weapon is a direct upgrade from the soldier's shovel in medieval mode.  Since bullets are not used in this mode, you can use this weapon without suffering a penalty.\n\n* The Equalizer:  This weapon is less useful in medieval mode than it is in standard games.  The weapon does less damage starting out than the soldier's other weapons, but does eventually outpace the other ones while he is near death.  Using this weapon is a bit of a gamble in medieval mode.  If you are pushing a point with your team, or holding off a push, the taunt will void the immediate area, though will open you to attack as well.\n\n-----\n\n**The Demoman Overview**\n\nMr. Degroot is one of the two classes who has access to all of his weapon slots in medieval mode(The other being the Sniper).  He has moderately high health(175) and is slightly slower than most classes.  The demoman easily overcomes his speed challenge thanks to his shield weapons, which take the place of his sticky launcher.  The demoman's frequent bursts of speed make him nearly impossible to escape from without having the scout's mobility.\n\nThe Demoman's(Demoknight, really) ability to charge makes him one of the toughest fighters in medieval mode.  The Ali Baba's Wee Booties(and the Bootlegger) allow him to turn mid-charge, and grant him 25+ health, which helps offset(or completely offsets) health penalties from some of his other weapons.\n\n**Recommended Loadouts:**\n\nThe Demoknight has 2 options for his shields, and only one option for his boots(the other is cosmetic.)  I do not recommend using the Chargin' Targe for Medieval Mode.\n\n\n**Chargin' Targe Vs. Splendid Screen**\n\n* The Targe offers more damage resistance vs Explosions.\n\n* The Targe offers more damage resistance vs. Fire\n\n* The Splendid Screen grants critical melee hits at any point in the charge. The targe only does it at the end, and mini-crits at half way.\n\n* The Splendid Screen's damage charge impact damage range is 85(Up to 170 with 5 heads from the eyelander), and can be inflicted during any point of the charge.  The targe can only impact at the end of the charge.\n\n\n**Notes: **\n\nIn Medieval mode, the only explosions that exist are from demos using the Ullapool Caber.  The resistance against one specific weapon is hardly worth sacrificing the other bonuses.  The shields do not offer resistance against self-inflicted damage, so using the Targe with the Caber will offer no additional bonuses.\n\nIn Medieval mode, the only sources of fire damage are from snipers with lit arrows, and pyros with Sharpened Volcano Fragments.  Snipers are fairly common in medieval mode, but pyros are hit-and-miss for attendance in games.  Arrows are still relatively easy to dodge, being projectiles.  The resistance is not worth losing the screen's combat bonuses.  \n\nThe Splendid Screen's combat advantages works against any class, regardless of which weapons they are using, making it far more applicable in Medieval mode.\n\n\n*Therefore, my recommended base load out is this:*\n\n\n* Primary: The Splendid Screen\n* Secondary: Ali Baba's Wee Booties/Bootlegger\n* Melee: Any of the below.\n\n\n**Melee Weapons**\n\n* Eyelander/HHHH/Nessie's Nine Iron:  -25 health, can collect heads for more health and speed. These weapons have a 37% larger range, but **do not randomly crit**. The health penalty is offset by the boots.  Kills made by these weapons add a 'Head' to the demoman, which increases his speed and his maximum health. He also receives a  damage bonus to his shield charge impact, making the charge itself lethal to light classes(max 170 health) and devastating even to the heavy.  \n\n* Cladheamh Mor: -15 health(resulting in 10+ health overall with the boots), and a 37% larger range.  This weapon increases the duration of your charges by an additional half second, letting you got slightly further when you charge.  This weapon cannot randomly crit.\n\n* Scottsman's Skullcrusher: 20% more damage, 37% larger range, but -15% speed on the user.  This weapon *can* randomly crit.  The reduced speed doesn't mean much with the ability to charge, but it will prevent you from pulling off certain charge tricks, such as ramp-jumping.\n\n* The Persian Persuader: Hands down, this weapon is the best for surviving as a demoknight.  Medieval mode already rewards drops of health for killing enemies.  You can collect their weapon and restore more health as well.  This weapon also halves the time required to recharge your shield's charge, meaning you can execute more bashes and charge-crits with this weapon.\n\n* The Pain Train:  Medieval mode doesn't have bullets, so this weapon doesn't have penalties.  It hits as hard as and has the same range of the bottle, but it captures twice as quickly.  \n\n**Honorable Mention:**\n\n* The Ullapool Caber:  I don't recommend this weapon but, for the sake of a trick, it needs to be mentioned.  The Ullapool Caber does 149 damage on its first hit(Critting for 300).  There is an explosion around where the hit lands, which passes the damage on to nearby enemies.  Charging and critting with the Ullapool Caber will kill whoever it hits(Except Dahkola Bar Heavies), and severely injure(or kill, if they're light classes) anyone near by.  This is good for charging into a cluster of enemies, but after the first strike, the caber's damage is severely limited(35 per hit, crits for 105.)  You will need to restock in order to regain its original strength.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1318868558", "subreddit": "NewToTF2", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I get your point, as it's one used very commonly, but as it is for the majority of things, the onus is on the theists to prove that a God exists, not on us to prove it doesn't exist, because, and I say this without exaggeration, it is *impossible* to prove something doesn't exist.\n\nIt is literally as simple as that, Loch Ness Monster, Leprechauns, Unicorns, Chupacabra, Slenderman et al aren't disprovable, you can see that they're incredibly unlikely and evidence for them is sketchy at best, but you go right ahead and try to disprove them, you'll be met by a brick wall.\n\nAnd, I'd like to say, that most atheists don't say there is definitely **no** God, but that it is incredibly unlikely that one exists, which is why most atheists are agnostic-atheists, and those who claim to be pure atheist without any shadow of a doubt must have some insight that the rest of the world does not.\n\nAnd now for something completely different, yet still OT. The thing that's always bothered me about it is the fact we live in a scientific universe. If there was a creator for all things, why do atoms, quarks, leptons, dark matter etc exist? He could've made us single entities with no constituent parts, just a blob of matter that looked identical to him that just worked, because you know, omnipotence and all that. But it's not, everything is made up of smaller, far more complicated things. Why would one go through so much effort to make a human, by making protons, neutrons and electrons, then making elements, then making compounds, then going on to make DNA, ribosomes etc. to make organs to build it all into a shell and label it 'Human'?\n\nI'm not actually directly asking you that, I'm just musing out loud as this thread is fairly related.

{"body": "Hey, JewishGun. Thanks for posting. First off, let me just clarify that I personally never try to make any claims regarding atheism. There are no claims to make. The burden of proof is always on the religious person to prove their supernatural claims. If anybody asks you why you're an atheist, a good response is: I simply haven't been given a good reason to believe.\n\nIf you're having trouble in a conversation with a theist, regardless of whether they're Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or anything else, just listen to what they're saying and then ask them what their evidence for this is. Or better yet, why do you believe that? You'll find that their belief will always stem from one or two things: 1) their holy book or 2) personal experience. Well, great. Now you have two things to combat.\n\n1) How do they know what it says in their holy book is true? You'll find this, most of the time, goes back to circular reasoning. They believe that the book is true because it was written or inspired by their god. And they believe their god wrote it or inspired it because the book says so. You can point that out to them. The other argument that I hear a lot is that the book is so old and so many people follow it. That's an easy one to dismiss. If you wrote a religious text right now and buried it for one thousand years and then it was uncovered, read, and followed by millions, does that make it, by default, true? Of course not.\n\n2) Ask them about the people who claim to be abducted by aliens. Or how about all the people that have seen Bigfoot/Yettis/Loch Ness Monster/etc.? Do they believe all of those stories? If the answer is no, well why not? (P.S. Because aliens aren't in the Torah is not a good excuse. There's lot of stuff that isn't in there.) The reason is that personal anecdotes are not good evidence. There's no way to prove that it happened and there's no good reason to believe any of it. If however, they claim that they DO believe all of those stories and that aliens, Bigfoot, etc. exist... well then they're just crazy. They're probably beyond help at that point. Get out of that conversation.\n\nI hope this helps you out. Remember, it all comes down to good reasons. If they can't present you with a good reason, why should you believe? Take those reasons and tear 'em up. :)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319393240", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Religion was never brought up in my family.  I know that my mother is non-practicing Christian.  My father is likely atheist - but we've never, ever talked about religion.  I spent my teenage years and my 20s being middle of the road agnostic.  Today I look back on that time as not really having thought about the problem enough.\n\nIn my early 30s I came across a website called [Battleground God](http://www.philosophersnet.com/games/god.php).  It's an online tests that asks you a series of questions and looks for inconsistencies in your philosophy.  The question that nailed me was, to paraphrase, \"Why do you disbelieve the Loch Ness Monster in the absence of evidence, and yet God is exempt from this same logic?\"\n\nI was well down the road to atheism and soon thereafter I read Richard Dawkins' \"The God Delusion\" which sealed the deal - describing my agnosticism to a tee.  \n\nToday I consider myself an anti-theist (religion, on the whole, does more harm than good) and a high \"6\" on the [Dawkins scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_theistic_probability#Dawkins.27s_formulation) (There's probably no God - and the definition of God is such that there's no way to prove It doesn't exist.)\n\nI've got two kids.  We've taught both to be critical thinkers and to question *everything*, especially what their parents have said.  We told them what we believed, but told them also that the existence of God is something they need to figure out for themselves.  We talk frequently about all world religions. They're now 11 and 13 and neither believes in God.  They're completely free to continue to examine the question and change their minds, and they'll be welcome in our home regardless.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1319416559", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Many of the differences we consider indicative of \"ethnic groups\" primarily developed as a result of limited gene-pools during the Paleolithic Era (and earlier), and it stands to reason that some \"racial\" developments occurred simply as a result of a constrained gene-pool during those times.

I lent a copy to my roomate's Christian brother (who believes dinosaurs walked with man, everyone that isn't a Christian will/deserves to burn in hell, and that the goal of science is to disprove God). I'm waiting for him to get back to me with his response to the book. The argument that religion is necessary for morality is pretty pathetic, and that is a great book on the topic.\n\n In return, he gave me a book called \"Paul meets Muhammed\", a debate on the resurrection of Christ written by a Christian Theologian. Obviously, the debate \"proves\" that the resurrection occurred, validating Christianity. I have never read the bible or Qu'ran. Great book trade... The premise of the book is, \"A Hypothetical debate using anecdotes to \n\"prove\" a supposed physical occurrence with no physical evidence\".  To me, it is akin to proving that the Loch Ness monster, or any other myth, exists simply because there are people that say it does.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1320013163", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}
