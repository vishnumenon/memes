{"body": "&gt;Liar.\n\nYou're right. I was hoping nobody would notice the way that I unfairly slighted r/atheism.\n\nJust kidding. Here's a sample of what I found in the top 30% of the thread, without going into the bottom 2/3 or expanding conversations down there.\n\n&gt;When is the first time this became an issue? Josephus mentions Jesus, but what he said isn't known since it was rewritten later. So when did the debate over Jesus become an issue for non-Christians? The first mention of Jesus in history is after his supposed death, when Paul wrote his epistles. It was decades later when Christianity began to get noticed by other non-Christian historians, and despite writing on the topic, no one then or now finds any records for Jesus at all, only the stories that were based on Paul. No records exist of non-Christians going to Nazareth and refuting his existence, but no records exist of non-Christians confirming or conceding his existence either. It's possible that the Gospels were based on accounts from actual apostles, but since there were many gospels around at the time that weren't made official and considered apocryphal, they just as easily could also have been invented based on Paul's original common story. \n\nAnd\n\n&gt;There may not have been any single person [Jesus] - the stories could have been drawn from the lives of many individuals, combined with myths from the oral tradition. Even if one of those individuals had the name \"Jesus\", we have no way of knowing which of the stories in the bible actually relate to that individual.\n\nand\n\n&gt;&gt;but there is no point arguing that a Palestinian cultic leader named Jesus didn't exist.\n\n&gt;Because no one knows either way and it's largely irrelevant?\n\nand\n\n&gt;If you're discussing things in e.g. a sociology of religion context, you're right that the historicity of Jesus is irrelevant. But often these discussions are about more basic claims such as that Jesus literally existed as the son of God. In that context, it can make sense to point out that there's extremely little evidence that the person in question even existed historically, let alone that he was a divine avatar.\n\nand\n\n&gt;But that's not my proposition. What I'm putting forth is the possibility that the myth of this particular Christ figure existed well before Paul and his contemporaries. When Paul and/or his contemporaries come along and popularize this Christ figure, by then called \"Jesus,\" placing him a generation before themselves, they were acting to crystallize a common story, only with slightly different facts.\n\nand\n\n&gt;Exactly. Jesus is best understood as an early urban legend.\n\nand\n\n&gt;\\We have legends of the Loch Ness monster, bigfoot, Yeti, the chupacabra, alien abduction, et cetera et fucking cetera that many people believe. The time was rife with messiahs wandering around, had been that way for a long time. It seems more likely that the legends of Jesus arose out of several of those. We know how urban legends arise and they usually have no factual basis at all.\n\nand\n\n&gt;If there's no contemporary evidence of a historical Jesus in the early 1st century, is it not possible that a historical Jesus was retroactively placed in the early 1st century? To then build upon the assumption that Jesus or whatever gave rise to Jesus took place in the early 1st century seems to be a mistake. It's begging the question by assuming away a fundamental part of the conclusion.\n\nand\n\n&gt;And this is essentially begging the question. You argue that Jesus existed because there wasn't enough time between the supposed Jesus and Paul for it all to be a fabrication. The premise that Jesus or supposed Jesus took place in the early 1st century is unsupported, to my knowledge, and it assumes away much of your conclusion.\n\nand\n\n&gt;It sounds like, if this historical Jesus did exist, there was quite a bit of urban legend, myth building, and purple monkey dishwasher Chinese whispers going on to embellish the story in the aftermath of his death.\n\nand\n\n&gt;How much of what is said to be taught by Jesus, is actually from the beliefs of the Essenean sect? A lot of what they believed seems very familiar. A short description about them, here in the third paragraph Could it be that Jesus was just a new version of their True Teacher myth?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328072288", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

Those who believe in the existence of the Loch Ness Monster are adding that belief to a set of generally accepted beliefs. It is not a paradigm sift or a completely different worldview.

{"body": "I was raised in what was essentially an agnostic environment. My parents were nominally Christian, but it was never talked about in the home. There was never any church, etc. Essentially I was left to my own devices. That being said, I have approached it a bit differently than many in this country do, as I never had a presupposed Religion to overturn, but rather started blank slate.\n\nThe simplest way I can sum it up is a sort of Occam's Razor:\n\nWithout religion, the entire universe sprang up from a difficult to conceive origin we cannot yet satisfactorily explain (admitting that we have theories of course)\n\nWith religion, the entire universe sprang from a Deity, which sprang up from a difficult to conceive origin we cannot satisfactorily explain.\n\nEssentially, you gain nothing, but add complexity. Since this added complexity does not help explain anything (you still have, essentially, either 'something from nothing', or a 'startless' something), there's no point to add it. \n\nThus, while I cannot prove a god does not exist, I can see no logical reason to believe one does exist. Some would call that agnostic, but I disagree. To me, even asking the question has already gone 'too far' in presupposing. If we assume anything we cannot prove doesn't exist might exist, then we are all agnostic not only about Gods, but bigfoot, flying saucers, the loch ness monster, leprechauns, toothfairies, and invisible fast-rotating orbital unicorns composed of dark matter above Neptune. \n\nIn simpler terms, I refuse to even consider whether or not god exists, until there is some sort of scientifically quantifiable situation in which the existence of a god is a more simple solution than the alternatives.\n\nMost religious people (presumably) would already consider this criteria to be met, but I leave that to the individual.

How much stock do you put in 9/11 conspiracy theories, or really any other conspiracy theory?\n\nThe point is, no, the simplest explanation is not that he was seen, which promopted the belief.  The simplest explanation is not that someone died on a cross, was buried, came back to life after three days, rolled a boulder away from a cave door immediately after rising from the dead, and began preaching again for the next 40 days, after which he ascended into the clouds.\n\nThe simplest explanation is that people tend to believe things that they want to believe in.  People have problems grasping death, so they try to hold on to the belief that certain people just can't be dead.  People tend to misinterpret things they see.  People tend to lie or tell exagerrated stories to convince others to agree with them.  People tend to take events that the mind feels are too awful to reject, and theorize explanations.\n\nElvis and Tupac may very well be alive- there have been numerous \"sightings\"- but I don't believe they are.  Its not unlikely that there were similiar \"sightings\" of Jesus that started the rumor that he had risen, which were built upon until entire stories were incorporated into the Bible many years later.\n\nMost of the stories involving mythical creatures have been admitted as hoaxes.  Loch Ness was some guy setting up a fake picture and telling everyone he had captured a monster on film.  The guys who started crop circles admitted to doing so, and showed scientists exactly how they had done yet.  Yet even with *admitted and proven* confessions, people still choose to believe something more is at play.  That there really are monsters and aliens among us.  And heck, there may be.  But the point is, people *want* to believe the fantastic.  Its intriguiging, captivating, thrilling.  Imagine over 2,000 years ago, when we didn't have science to quickly disprove hoaxes.  It would be even easier to convince people of things they were already desperate to believe.\n\nAnd conspiracy theories just show how easy it is to twist \"evidence\" and coincidence into \"proof\".  I've watched the 9/11 videos, and they're quite convincing.  Yet an extra 5 minutes of research will discount most of what they say.  I personally believe in the Second Shooter theory, as there is heavy evidence and even the FBI has stated it is probably true.  There are a number of other conspiracies that are fun to research, but easily written off.  Imagine, though, we didn't have the internet to immediately discover holes in the theory.  We were in the Middle East 2,000 years ago and we heard this guy who was a prophet had been seen preaching, even though he'd DIED weeks before!!  The rumor spread, some people swore they'd seen him personally, they told of all these \"miracles\" their friend's uncle's sister-in-law had seen him perform when he was alive.

{"body": "A) I don't worship anyone or hold any religious faith.\n\nB) Understanding faith in the crudest of terms achieves exactly nothing and makes a mockery out of any intellectual inquiry into the religious dimension of the human experience. Terry Eagleton, another atheist, makes the point well in his [review](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n20/terry-eagleton/lunging-flailing-mispunching) of *The God Delusion*:\n\n&gt;Believing in God, whatever Dawkins might think, is not like concluding that aliens or the tooth fairy exist. God is not a celestial super-object or divine UFO, about whose existence we must remain agnostic until all the evidence is in. Theologians do not believe that he is either inside or outside the universe, as Dawkins thinks they do. His transcendence and invisibility are part of what he is, which is not the case with the Loch Ness monster. This is not to say that religious people believe in a black hole, because they also consider that God has revealed himself: not, as Dawkins thinks, in the guise of a cosmic manufacturer even smarter than Dawkins himself (the New Testament has next to nothing to say about God as Creator), but for Christians at least, in the form of a reviled and murdered political criminal....\n\n&gt;Dawkins speaks scoffingly of a personal God, as though it were entirely obvious exactly what this might mean. He seems to imagine God, if not exactly with a white beard, then at least as some kind of chap, however supersized. He asks how this chap can speak to billions of people simultaneously, which is rather like wondering why, if Tony Blair is an octopus, he has only two arms. For Judeo-Christianity, God is not a person in the sense that Al Gore arguably is. Nor is he a principle, an entity, or ‘existent’: in one sense of that word it would be perfectly coherent for religious types to claim that God does not in fact exist. He is, rather, the condition of possibility of any entity whatsoever, including ourselves. He is the answer to why there is something rather than nothing.

{"body": "&gt;I think you misunderstand this. I am only using this as evidence that people aren't lying when they say that they have spiritual experiences and that a thing is actually happening. When you dream and it shows up, you are actually dreaming. Something IS actually happening.\n\nJust because these tests show brain activity doesn't mean that they would show up on everyone so some people ARE lying. For those that show brain activity A) Show me the tests and EKG's B) Even if they do, the dream point still stands, emotions are evoked, your mind does crazy things, and that is a much more likely thing than a spiritual experience. You should know that I don't even have to give this point credence because it's not concrete.\n\n&gt;Just because you have a shadow, does that mean you do not exist? What is the real phenomenon, you moving your arm or the neurochemical release that is essentially concurrent with that muscle movement. Do your neurotransmitters control your thoughts, or do you control your neurotransmitters when thinking. What is the cause and what is the reaction. If we look at literally every other bodily process, the neurochemical transaction is merely the undercurrent to the \"actual\" event, even though both are actually happening. Why should this spiritual event be any different? Because you can't record it with cameras? Because you can't pick it up with a microphone?\n\nNot sure the point you're trying to make? There is no way to argue that DMT isn't released involuntarily upon potential(or real) death.\n\n&gt;You saying so doesn't make it true. You even say most actions come from a need to survive, what of the ones that don't?\n\nIf you think humans don't strive to survive then you're delusional. Any objective morals come from a need to survive, and those that don't haven't been answered by science.\n\n&gt;There are cultural interpretations of the universal moral code. One example is \"Do not murder an innocent person\". Different cultural definitions change the meanings of the words \"murder\" \"innocent\" and \"person\". A culture that practices human sacrifice (possibly cannibalism) would not be murdering as the killing has a sanctified place in the society or perhaps the person is not deemed innocent or perhaps the person is not deemed a person. That is, in fact, the very debate we are having over the abortion issue. You will find no culture in which the wanton killing of full members of a culture that is not sanctified in some ritualistic way is acceptable.\n\nDoesn't matter. A universal moral code would make everyone feel these acts are reprehensible, no matter the way they define them, if there were truly morals that said what is right or wrong, they would know, and if they don't they aren't objective morals, regardless of definition.\n\n&gt;would you commit a crime if you had absolutely no chance of being caught? Why or why not? Assuming you did, do you think you would feel good about it afterwards?\n\nOf course not, I don't have a god to repent to, to forgive me from my crimes and comfort me, I am actually ACCOUNTABLE for my actions, unlike the theist.\n\n&gt;Lots of people have proof of god. Lots of the elders of our society even privately believe in a god of some kind. The proofs of god simply are not accepted in this society because we require mechanized proof. In countless other societies, in fact in the majority of the population of the world the existence of the spiritual is taken for granted.\n\nNo, your proof is not proof, it must be objective, FOR EVERYONE TO SEE, if it is your proof it is not proof at all. If I have a vision that the loch ness monster is god, must that be given credence? Of course not, not unless I can present proof. Sure, in countless societies it is, third world countries for the most part rampant with sexism and indoctrination. But you'll notice that there is a direct positive correlation between literacy rates/health indexes and atheism. An example of this is Sweden, with 80% atheism rate, the highest standard of living, health index, and literacy rates in the world. Now, take Somalia with a 100% rate of muslims, and consider their alarmingly low literacy rate. Funny that the more educated people there are, that is, the more intelligent people there are, the less religious people there are.\n\n &gt;Why must I? Can't I gnostically know that I'm thinking of the color red right now? How could I prove that to you and how does that make my knowing any less real.\n\nRed is measurable and provable, and was created by god. Gnostically thinking of god is not the same thing. It's not the evidence that I'm willing to accept because to make a claim that you KNOW something for a fact if you want other people to give any respect to your claims you must make them able to see your proof objectively. I'm not brainwashed into thinking anything, it's common since. And my perceptions are the only thing to go on, they are certainly better than the illusions you are able to drum up.\n\nPeople don't answer you because your standard of proof is not acceptable, if the world followed your standard of proof, we would be forced to take almost any claim of anything as fact.\n ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328767291", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Not sure the point you're trying to make? There is no way to argue that DMT isn't released involuntarily upon potential(or real) death.\n\nOkay, I'll do my best to reiterate. When you move your arm, do you think you are just moving your arm? No, there are thousands of electrochemical reactions in your central and peripheral nervous systems that can be measured. Does the existence of this influx of dopamine, GABA, glutimate, etc mean that the movement of your arm is not real? I think that is a silly way to think. Just because there are simultaneous/nearly simultaneous electrochemical reactions in your brain for EVERY SINGLE thing that you do doesn't mean that your actions are not real. Since this seems to be the way that the brain is set up, why arbitrarily decide that spiritual experiences aren't \"real\" simply because there is a neurotransmitter release concurrent with or immediately before or immediately after?\n\n&gt;If you think humans don't strive to survive then you're delusional. Any objective morals come from a need to survive, and those that don't haven't been answered by science.\n\nOf course I think humans strive to survive. You, however have created a contradiction. \"Any objective morals...and those that don't\" what exactly do you mean? You admit some morals cannot be explained by science, why do they exist then?\n\nAs I mentioned before, at any rate, unless you are somehow positing that humans are the only species to engage in altruism (which is verifiably not true) this means that altruism had to evolve in at some point which is not possible unless it is part of the default state of life.\n\n&gt;Doesn't matter. A universal moral code would make everyone feel these acts are reprehensible, no matter the way they define them\n\nOnce again, just because you say so, does not make it true. I can, in fact, provide more evidence to the contrary. All cultures have sexual taboos. The universal moral tenet \"do not take part in sexual indecency\" therefore exists. Of course nit-pickingly specific rules don't exist because the ENVIRONMENT is CHANGING. This is partially why religious books are silly and dangerous. A codified list of commandments FOR ALL THE AGES is simply impossible due to the changing nature of our world.\n\n&gt;Of course not, I don't have a god to repent to, to forgive me from my crimes and comfort me, I am actually ACCOUNTABLE for my actions, unlike the theist.\n\nTo whom are you accountable? Yourself? Why? What do you owe yourself. Anyway, I think you have a very dim view of my mindset. I act good because it makes me feel good to do so. I am allowed to feel great and happy because I know that I am a good person. The thing is, I think that my good is your good, is everyone's good, is nature's good, is universal good whereas you think it's a fluke of our biochemistry (and so why bother?)\n\n&gt; it must be objective, FOR EVERYONE TO SEE\n\nEveryone DOES SEE IT, most in this culture just ignore it because it's become associated with something inferior (which I will address very soon actually). Do you claim to tell me that you have never once in your life ever had a mystical or spiritual experience?\n\n&gt; If I have a vision that the loch ness monster is god, must that be given credence? Of course not, not unless I can present proof.\n\nIf 99% of the world's population claimed to have seen that loch ness monster and you in fact had seen the loch ness monster, but someone told you that that was a silly idea and that such monsters cannot exist and your experience of the loch ness monster was in fact, kind of distant, and you could see how maybe you were just tricking yourself you are in fact believing in that one person more than the 99% of the world without proof from them.\n\n&gt; Sure, in countless societies it is, third world countries for the most part rampant with sexism and indoctrination.\n\nBias, you claim that western culture features no aspect of sexism or indoctrination. I'd like to see you argue that point. Furthermore, you are proving my point by spouting what you have been indoctrinated to believe. Yes there is sexism and indoctrination in 3rd world countries, but it exists in the west as well!\n\n&gt; But you'll notice that there is a direct positive correlation between literacy rates/health indexes and atheism.\n\nGranted, but I suspect that largely has to do with the fact that the written religions have so much wrong with them. Much of the world sees them as the be all end all of religion instead of the training wheels that they are.\n\nI imagine that the atheism rate means \"not belonging to any religion\" and if you asked them if they had had any mystical/spiritual experiences, most of them would say that they indeed had. Most of that group would probably say that that signified nothing, however.\n\n&gt;the more educated people there are, that is, the more intelligent people there are\n\nMy indoctrination alarm is going off. You claim that more education means more intelligence? I don't think there is a single credible modern scholar who would agree with you. Certainly not any teachers. You have been brainwashed into thinking that these religious/tribal modes of thinking are inferior and only available to those with less intelligence because they have not been graced by the miraculous healing light of the West. Imperialism and colonialism came from this same line of thinking.\n\n&gt; Gnostically thinking of god is not the same thing. It's not the evidence that I'm willing to accept because to make a claim that you KNOW something for a fact\n\nWhat I'm saying is I'm allowed to know something without you knowing it. I can show you all of the evidence in the world and you can reject it all you want. Think like this, I can say I'm a gnostic evolutionist because I KNOW evolution is a fundamental mechanism of life (although I do see your point now that if evidence came around for a better way of explaining things I would go to that model) someone who is a creationist would say YOU CAN'T KNOW THAT, you don't have any EVIDENCE. When I show them said evidence, they can just reject it and continue to cry you don't KNOW. Kind of a moot claim.\n\n&gt; if you want other people to give any respect to your claims you must make them able to see your proof objectively.\n\nI am showing that to you. You've had spiritual experiences (or you're in an incredible minority in which case the vast majority of the population has had spiritual experiences). The human world operates within a framework of universal morals. Goodness is a default component of life. All of these are objective (or logically arrived at) evidences that I am presenting.\n\n&gt;  I'm not brainwashed into thinking anything, it's common since.\n\nIf you're alive, you've been brainwashed into thinking something. I know I have. It's possible to see past it, but you have to know what ideas are being shoved into your subconscious, forming the way you think. I have found some, but indeed not all.\n\n&gt; And my perceptions are the only thing to go on, they are certainly better than the illusions you are able to drum up.\n\nThen freaking USE YOUR PERCEPTIONS!!! Don't listen to what the culture says or what Dawkins says or all of this external jibber-jabber. Once again you are claiming that you have NEVER had a single spiritual/mystical experience in your entire life.\n\n&gt;People don't answer you because your standard of proof is not acceptable, if the world followed your standard of proof, we would be forced to take almost any claim of anything as fact.\n\nNo, simply not true, I've laid out my evidence and if you'd like me to do it again I will", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1328809819", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I go to the bathroom upstairs and release with great fury what was baking inside my stomach.  I feel great pleasure but I'm wondering in the back of my mind how will this wild beast be able to make it through the pipes.  First try... water flow, but no success. The water level raised a bit.  No worry.  Second try, water level even higher up.  I star to panic.  I've been in this situation before.  You have to commit and go balls deep.  Flush until there's no more water to flush.  Third try, big mistake.  Water level reaches all the way up on the toilet.  I feel a cold shiver down my spine.  Oh shit, the loch ness monster is not going to go away without fighting.  The more time I spend in the bathroom the more suspicion I raise.  What to do now?  No plunger in sight.  Too afraid to confess to family.  I can only think of one more thing to do.  I'll get the water level down and go down swinging with a final uber flush of more than 1 gallon.  I use the trashcan and scoop water out of the toilet and flush it down the bathtub.  Once the water level is acceptable and I rinse the poop particles out of the bathtub I go for the win.  Go down you scary motherfucker! AAAAAh super flush!  Ooooh snap it won't flush.  The toilet is about to overflow. ABORT!  Fuck!  \n\nI loose.  I had to go out and confess to my uncle.  He nods like is not a big deal.  He proceeds to go find a plunger.  No luck.  He asks my aunt if they have a plunger.  No plunger in the house.  My aunt acts all cool and decides to go buy one.  I'm feeling like an idiot now.  She goes out, comes back, guess what?  No plunger at the store.  Fuck.  They tell me to go to sleep and not worry about it.  I do.\n\nWake up next morning.  The monster is gone.

There is no Supreme Being, there is no Bigfoot, Yeti, or Sasquatch. there is no Loch Ness Monster, no Jersey Devil, no Chupacabra.

This took several billion years for the earth to produce. Assuming about 20% of the earth's oil is unretrieveable or unreachable, we have about 25% left. Everyone says oh, we will find alternative energy and get off of oil soon. Ok, let's say that miracle happens. What about plastic and petroleum fertilizer. How do you honestly think we can survive with current population levels without plastic and fertilizer? The answer is, we can't. The earth cannot support more than about 2 billion humans when the oil runs out, which means about 5 billion humans must die, more than the amount that are born. Don't worry, as soon as Saudi Arabia cannot meet it's orders for oil, even wehn the price has gone through the roof, all the major countries will go to war, even using nukes if necessary to secure the last few precious drops of oil.

I think somewhere around 99% of all American meat consumed is produced by factory farms.   Factory farms are nothing like the natural cycle of predation.

{"body": "I see what you're saying and I was with you until the last paragraph.  People are not trying to reshape atheism into a soft or fuzzy term.  It is what it has always been.  Putting the \"a\" in front of the word theist is a negation of that word, as is be \"asexual\" for instance.  Its not an opposite claim but rather a negation of the first claim.\n\nAnd most atheists are agnostic atheists.  Even Richard Dawkins, one of the stable figures in the atheist movement, says in his book the God Delusion that if you had to put him on a scale, 1 having certainty there is a god and 7 being certain there is not, even he is a 6.  As you said there is no way to know.  \n\nAnd the atheist position is largely summed up by \"Just because we don't know for sure doesn't make your made up answer any more viable, so I choose not to believe you.\"\n\nAnother example: I want to know where this rock sitting in the middle of the floor came from.  Now we don't know for sure how it got there as no one has been in the house and there is no surveillance footage, but we're doing our best to guess.  Someone says \"that rock is actually an egg layed by the Loch Ness monster who magically appeared and disappeared out of our home.\"  I would say, \"No, I don't believe that.\"  That doesn't mean I know.  We both don't know for sure, but that doesn't make his statement any more credible.  \n\nAgain, if you haven't, watch the video, which gives a good answer to the issue of agnosticism.  Atheism is not saying \"There is no god.\"  STRONG atheism is saying that, but not atheism.  Atheism, simply says there is not enough credible reason/evidence for me to accept the claim that there is a God.  Maybe the Greeks were right and Zeus is our creator.  Maybe a Pink Unicorn made everything.  We don't know; and because we don't know, I will await further discovery before making a claim.

{"body": "First of all, don't believe in anything without evidence. You think that would go without saying in this day and age, but oh well.\n\n* God? To start with, which god? Mithra? Ahura-Mazda? Allah? Kali? Thor? Zeus? Why is any one god more obviously true than another? And the gods I just listed are all way older than the Christian god. \n\n* Appeal to ignorance: \"look at the majesty and beauty of nature, obviously God created all this.\" Just because the world is beautiful (and in fact it kind of isn't, what with the starving kids in Africa and whatnot) doesn't automatically mean God must have done it. By that logic the entire universe may just as well have been farted out by a giant space whale. \n\n* Appeal to ignorance II: \"Well, you know, science doesn't have all the answers. You can't explain X or Y or Z.\" Again, just because we don't know everything doesn't automatically mean all of science is bullshit and therefore God is true and real.\n\n* Not sure what this falls under, but: \"You can't be good without God.\" Sure you can. Lots of people are, all the time. Besides, most religions actually teach you how to be a worse person rather than a better person (women are objects, kill those who don't believe what you believe, kill your children if they misbehave, rape is okay if you pay the victim's father, slavery is cool bro, disown your own family before you deny god, etc. etc.). \n\n* Circular Logic: \"The Bible says X and Y and Z, and the Bible is true, and the Bible is true because the Bible says it is true.\" Also known as \"The Bible is true because God wrote it, and we know God wrote it because the Bible says so, and we know that it is true because...\" (infinite loop). The stupidity here is self-explanatory.\n\n* Argument from experience: \"I had this life-changing experience where God touched me / spoke to me / saved me from my sins / I'm all happy inside etc. etc. etc.\" Basically, you can't argue with a Christian's \"testimony\" as they call it. But you don't need to, because it's an anecdote. It's like me saying I have proof of the Loch Ness Monster, and that proof is basically that a friend of mine told me he once saw it, and that's all. As the late great Hitchens put it: \"extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. That which can be explained without proof can also be dismissed without proof.\" Or something very similar, hope I got that quote right.\n\n* Threat of Hell / Pascal's Wager: \"If you don't believe in God, you'll end up burning in hell.\" Also, Pascal's Wager: \"If God is real, then you'll end up in hell; if God is not real, then nothing is lost by having believed. i.e. play it safe and believe in God, JUST IN CASE he turns out to be real.\" It's bullshit for many reasons. For one thing, you do have a lot to lose; your freedom, your independence, skepticism, fun, figuring out life and morality and ethics for yourself, etc. etc. and for another thing: Why would you WANT to spend eternity in Heaven with someone as horrible and unpleasant as God in the first place? And bear in mind, I'm saying this as a former batshit insane hardcore devout Christian: I'd rather go to hell than \"fake\" believing in / loving / obeying this god who can't do a decent job of running this planet in the first place and his kiss ass and whatnot. No thanks. \n\nThese are just off the top of my head.\n\nBottom line is, no one can force you to believe jack shit. Stick to your guns, just keep repeating what they say on the internet: **\"cool story bro, pics or it didn't happen.\"** No proof = no deal.\n\nPM me if you need any more advice, and I'll be more than happy to give it.
