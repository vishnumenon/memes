Since you can't I'll assume there is none.\n\n&gt;We cannot equate the story of the disciples deaths to those who die in the name of Islam\n\nBased on what? Because you happen to be a Christian and so say so.\n\n&gt;however I am talking about the martyrs (disciples) who saw Christ after his death. They are not the same argument.\n\nThey're exactly the same. I'm sorry you're too biased to see this.  \n\nI am talking about early Islam at its formation. Islam grew very rapidly within an area that was previously pagan, Jewish and Christian. Multiple people joined Islam and risked their lives in establishing and defending it. \n\nBy your own argument the only reason they would have done this is because the claims it made were true. \n\nIf you cannot see how these two things are exactly the same there's not much hope for you. You seem to fail to be able to say a reason why other than a childish 'nope, cos I said so.' Which says enough really.\n\n&gt;This will be my last post to you on this thread, so listen closely...\n\nI accept your concession.\n\n&gt;With this comment, you assume I have put my trust in evidence alone.\n\nI assume any rational person would.\n\n&gt;There is evidence, despite how accurate it may seem to you.\n\nThere's very bad evidence of lots of things. There's bad evidence the moon landed was faked, bad evidence aliens exist, bad evidence scientology is true, bad evidence Apollo is real, bad evidence bigfoot exists, bad evidence the Loch Ness monster exists and so on . Simply having evidence isn't enough it has to be accepetable evidence based on logic and rationality. Christianity fails here as every piece of evidence presented in its favour has been refuted over and over again. \n\nI have weighed the evidence and conclude Christianity is not true and that no rational person could conclude otherwise.\n\n&gt;So, I say good day to you and wish you luck on your intellectual endeavors. \n\nAs I say I accept your concession in the argument.

This kid has a huge basement, so its basically like a dance floor and it is actually pretty awesome. I make myself a mixed drink because i become more confident when i have some alcohol, and decide to dance with this girl that i think is cute. \n\nI walk up to her and ask her to dance and she says yeah and we start dancing. I can remember the song exactly, they played R Kelly Ignition (great song by the way), and she was grinding on me all slow. Well after a couple minutes i realize that i have go to the bathroom, i tell her and start to walk off and she follows me (although i didn't know she was following me). \n\nWhen i finished in the bathroom i walked out and she was right there, she pushed me into the bathroom and shut the door behind us. I asked if i could help her (in my best \"obviously you wanna fuck me but i am gonna flirt a little voice\")  She doesn't say anything just smiles and walks close to me. \n\nWe start making out and everything is going great until i realize that i do not have a condom. Well i just let things flow hoping that maybe if we get naked she will at least give me a blow job (or anal? i dunno i was fucking 15). Well, when it came time to actually do the nasty she asked if i had protection, obviously i said no and she looked sad. Then she said, \"well if you don't have a condom can you help me with something else?\" I said, \"Sure what do you need?\" and she replied with \"About tree fiddy.\" It was about that time that i realized this girl was a 5 story tall crustacean and from the paleolithic era and was using me for cab fair.

{"body": "SO I was out at a local bar one sunday night, and it was basically empty. I was single and alone, and there were only a couple old guys at the bar, who left at about 10pm. I would have left too, as the only other person, the bar tender was too busy cleaning the kitchen to talk to me, but I was only about 1 pint into a pitcher so I stayed. \n\nI'm kind of a dork, and remember wearing pants that were a bit too short. I was minding my own business, when I felt a draft at my ankles. I looked up and there was a smoking hot blonde woman in a red dress walking in with a whisp of the thick fog from the street. She was way to hot to be from a normal town, let alone be the kind of woman who would hang around a boring bar like this. I was nervous to talk to her, but felt like it would be more awkward to be the only other person at the bar and not say anything. I got the bar tender's attention and bought her a drink. She smiled and asked me what I was doing there alone. I didn't want to admit that I didn't have anyone to go to the bar with me, so I told her that my friends from out of town were going to meet me, but decided not to because the roads were too foggy.\n\nAs the night went on, my pitcher grew empty and I could hardly believe that we had held a conversation so long. I guess the liquid courage really kept me from being the nervous wreck I usually am, that is until she pulled me close. She lead me into a lounge area in a separate room and threw me on the couch, sliding her panties out from under her skirt. She wouldn't let me protest, and she wasn't going to slow down, but then I had no objections. She rode me for longer than I can remember, and then we stumbled out of the bar, giggling like we were in high school. I said \"man that was just what I needed!\", and she looked into my eyes, and said \"I still need something more.\" I paused, \"uh yeah, what\". she leaned in close and whispered softly \"About tree-fiddy\". It was at that moment that I realized that this hot blonde was actually a 3 story monster from the paleolithic era.\n\nTo this day I still have no idea what happened.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331321728", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 172, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, I was working one case that made it pretty far, all the way up to the Texas state supreme court. The plaintiff was suing the state for searching his property without a warrant, but the defendant blatantly forged a warrant as soon as the lawsuit was brought up, but it was an official document and was dated as though there was no problem, but the plaintiff was smart enough to videotape what was going on. The conversation on his property went thusly:\n\n\"Do you have a warrant?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Can I see it?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then how do I know you have one?\"\n\"Stop arguing or I'll arrest you.\"\n\nSo, the plaintiff argued, as he should have, and was handcuffed and placed into the cop car, while the police searched his house and found about 10 ounces of marijuana. Keep in mind, this is all warrant-less at this point. \n\nIn the trial, all of this was brought up, including the forged warrant. Through some investigating, we knew the warrant was forged, because it is common protocol in the state of Texas to save a digital copy of the warrant to a large file server, and on this server, the file creation date was after the day the plaintiff was arrested.\n\nSo, that's when the trial got hairy. The judge almost reached a verdict, but that's when everyone realized; the judge was actually the Loch Ness Monster, which make everyone freak the fuck out. He gave his ruling, and awarded the plaintiff his settlement.

{"body": "&gt; This seems to turn on the definition of science.\n\nYes, it does, and science is so important that its definition is not an informal matter -- it's based on a very strict set of ideas. The reason for this is because there are many people who would like their unscientific ideas to be treated as though they were science. Christian \"Science\". \"Scientology\". Creationism. Bigfoot believers.\n\n&gt; \"There is no life on any planet except Earth\". This is falsifiable but it is impractical to check all of them.\n\nThat is neither scientific nor falsifiable. Because [proving a negative is a logical error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance), claims that rely on proving a negative aren't scientific.\n\nHere's an example -- I say that Bigfoot exists, and unless other people can disprove his existence, then he's real. But no one can conclusively prove a negative, so therefore such a person can go on believing in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster and the tooth fairy. Fine -- but not science.\n\n&gt; The two types of statement (singular existential and universal, respectively) are definitely different, but both are within the remit of science (ie, learning more about the universe).\n\nFalse. Science requires more than philosophy and speculation. Science requires evidence and testable theories.\n\n&gt; Preliminary science is science.\n\nYes, and a horse chestnut is a chestnut horse.

I've been a member of more than one ghost group, across multiple states. I'd argue that I know as much as the majority of believers out there, it consumed my waking, and non-waking, hours for a long time.\n\nIn all of those years, for all of those EVPs I've recorded, or the orbs I've shot photos of, or the sounds I've heard, there has never been one thing that could not be explained away if a person sat down and actually put a bit of rational thought into it. The explanation was always there. The difference between myself and 95% of the believers out there is that I do not want to believe so badly that I am willing to look the other way and ignore the obvious.\n\nAs for the ghost box. I think most rational people realize the thing is just stopping on random radio frequencies, for a brief second, and you hear that little snippet of audio that is being broadcast. A person who wants to believe that there are ghosts around them will hear anything they want to hear in that 1 second snatch of audio. This is another one of the many devices that people are suckered into buying simply because they saw someone use it on a heavily edited paranormal program, a person who was, if not given the device for free, was paid to use it on the show. The ghost box is every bit as ridiculous as that horrible device they use on ghost adventures. Someone will help me out here with the name, since it escapes me, but it's the one that had the database of words, and ghosts supposedly use it to talk. Don't even get me started on how in the name of whomever a person who's been dead since before television existed would even being to fathom how to use such a device. \n\nIt's a crutch folks. We're so alone on this little rock. If we are lucky, we'll get around 100 years, though of us get 30-40 years shy of that. People need to believe that there is something else out there besides this pitifully short existence we call life. When in fact, this is all there is. There is no Bigfoot, there is no Loch Ness Monster, we are not being visited by aliens, and ghosts do not exist. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331612851", "subreddit": "Paranormal", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "It snowed for the next 2 days, the first of which I spent completely inside, refusing to look out the windows. That night I slept on the couch in the living room on the other side of the house. The next day I braved the storm in search of something to lift my \"spirits\". Instead of taking the direct route up the road to the liquor store, I broke trail a couple of blocks out of my way. I met with my friend's deadbeat older brother who bought me a pint of Yukon Jack, and was even nice enough to offer to help me drink it. I told him I had plans that night, which wasn't true.\n\nThat night, my parents dug out the car to go to dinner and the bar with their friends, leaving me alone in the house. I got down to drinking, and got increasingly interested in my ghost watching as the night went on. I got ready for bed, purposely opening my window despite the storm. This time my own shivering shook me awake around 11:30. I looked outside as I closed the window, and watched for the girl. As the room warmed up and I reached the end of my bottle I became drowsy. Every whisp of fresh snow blown loose from the ground took the figure of that girl. My vision was unsteady and began to twist edges of the shadows into her shape, and I began to nod off to the visions of her phasing in and out of the lamplight's edge.\n\nMy eyes felt like they were spinning in my head, and seemed to trick my into tracking a white shape in the distance. That shape instantly pipped me from my half-conscious state. I watched the fleeting white shape come fully into view as she ran to the edge of the road. She looked anxiously around, paused, and locked right on to my face. she began to run towards my house as a screeching gust punctured the edge of my window. My heart raced but with full clarity I saw the look of fear on her face, so I jumped up and ran outside to meet her.\n\nShe was in the street jumping up and down waving at my window, and she didn't see the snow begin to shimmer on the hilltop. I ran at her as a large black SUV bounded over the ridge, grabbing her and tackling her into a snowdrifs as the car trampled on by. I regained my senses and looked up to find that the car was already out of sight. Then I looked back to the girl who studdered \"I, I need help p-please\" \"what, is it what's wrong? What can I do?\" I replied, heart still pounding\" \"I, I need.. about tree-fiddy\" she said. And that's when I noticed that the poor girl with the soft blonde hair was actually a 3 story tall creature from the paleolithic era, but at least I had closure.\n\n\nEdit: People seemed to like this despite the ending, so I'm posting an edited version with the legit ending on /r/nosleep", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331843749", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 751, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "*I entered the church, cold and dark. Everything in here was blocky, cubic, uniformly perfect. I raised my gun, plugs loaded, and strafed between the pews. This 'Church of Minecraft' was new to me, but not the first zealous religion to crop up in the City of Reddit... there was the Temple of Starcraft, The Grand Theft Assembly... I heard the Diablo Mosques had been picking up supporters as of late.*\n\n*I moved from the central room to a corridor. These hollow walls were systimatically adorned with pillars on which small ceramic statues rested; a strange green creature, some sort of skeleton, a wolf. I travelled slowly, checking each of the strange idols in turn, each cobblestone step softened by care and caution. As I approached the end of the corridor, subtle voices were carried my way.* \"Tree fiddy a day,\" *claimed the strongest voice,* \"Final offer.\"\n\n*The awning at the end of the corridor opened up into a wide room, just as blocky as the rest of the place. Two figures stood at the end, bickering. One of them was the perp, the other was a kid I recognized from the projects... Fwickjr. Just another poor youth turned to darkness in this endless city. The room was too open for a direct approach, but I spied a ladder leading up to the awnings. As I climbed odd words drifted up to me... 'Prime', 'Alot', 'Classic'... none of them made any sense out of context, apart from one. The most important. The unmistakable. 'Gonewild'.*\n\n*I crawled across the awning into position. My copper was running thin, and it was time to kiss these Redhots. I dropped from the roof, sidearm drawn. In the moment, I couldn't think of anything classy or witty to say, so I decided to let Samuel Colt do the talking. I dropped with speed, hand pressing hat to head, as I plummeted towards the single figure below. Single figure! My perp had escaped, and only Fwickjr remained.*\n\n*I slammed into him, flooring him in one swift blow. My hat reeled off into the distance. My revolver, seemingly dismayed by this, left in the other direction. I pulled myself up, and looked around: No sign of the perp. I turned to check on Fwickjr, and a dwarf-shaped statuette slammed into me; an unfriendly introduction to dark unconsciousness.*\n\n*I roused from my slumber and was greeted by the tepid feel of cobblestone against cheek. That jamaican roundheel must have cooled me after the jump. He was gone, Fwickjr was gone, and my gat was gone... but my hat, she remained. I placed her on my head, and looked down; the broken remains of a hollow, porcelain dwarf lay strewn across the floor. I picked up a piece, the word 'YOGS' inscribed in the brittle material. For some reason I felt like I should place it in my pocket, perhaps as a souvenir. 'Whatever doesn't kill yeh' and all that.*\n\n*I brushed myself off and left the church. My number of leads had now dwindled to one: That word I'd heard previously...*\n\n*Looks like I was about to Go Wild, although just how wild this ride would get, I was yet to find out.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331844113", "subreddit": "Minecraft", "score": 25, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't think you know the difference between atheism and agnostic.\n\nHere's a couple paragraphs from [athiesm.com](http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/atheism.htm).\n\n&gt;Once it is understood that atheism is merely the absence of belief in any gods, it becomes evident that agnosticism is not, as many assume, a “third way” between atheism and theism. The presence of a belief in a god and the absence of a belief in a god exhaust all of the possibilities. Agnosticism is not about belief in god but about knowledge — it was coined originally to describe the position of a person who could not claim to know for sure if any gods exist or not.\n\n&gt;Thus, it is clear that agnosticism is compatible with both theism and atheism. A person can believe in a god (theism) without claiming to know for sure if that god exists; the result is agnostic theism. On the other hand, a person can disbelieve in gods (atheism) without claiming to know for sure that no gods can or do exist; the result is agnostic atheism.\n\nAs you can see being an atheist and agnostic aren't mutually exclusive.  If you're going to take up the idea that it's only logical to have opinions on something which has 100% been disproven then you are also open the idea of UFOs, Big Foot, Loch Ness Monster and Thor as it's the \"logical way to go\", I am aware this is a tired argument but it displays a good point.\n\nPenn Jillette dives further into the meanings of the words [here](http://www.g4tv.com/videos/54449/penn-jillette-talks-about-new-book-god-no/) if you are interested.\n\nAll [this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66r_XMoDkk)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1331852952", "subreddit": "videos", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I would, for the last two episodes of the season, have the following story:\n\nOne day, when Stan and Kyle are watching Terrence and Phillip, the broadcast is interrupted as the news shows a big child molestation/prostitution ring being arrested: The Super Adventure Club. One of the members they see is Darth Chef, and they go and get Cartman and Kenny to go to the police station to see him. **(Note: Any time you hear Darth Chef speak, it sounds like Darth Vader from Star Wars with the same accent and diction that Chef uses)**\n\nWhen they get there, they find out that Darth Chef escaped and is currently on the loose. They try and think where he would be, and they look everywhere: the school cafeteria, his old house, even the strip club. But he's not there.\n\nThey call Chef's parents in Scotland, and Chef's parents tell Stan that Chef is home, unaware that he is a child molester or even that he's now Darth Chef. The kids get on a plane to Scotland, and when they get there, they go to Chef's parent's house.\n\nThere, they find out that Chef began working at a YMCA or another group that works with children. They panic and go there and save the kid from being molested and confront Chef. There is some drama there as the kids try and convince Darth Chef to come back, and at one point, the following exchange happens:\n\n&gt;DC: The last few years have been the most exciting of my life. Think about how great it is to molest children in the pit of a volcano; in a Thai jungle; on the beaches of Australia.\n\n&gt;[Enter Towelie] Towelie: When you go to the beach, don't forget to bring a towel!\n\n&gt;Cartman: Goddamn it Towelie, we're being serious here. Get the fuck out you stupid Towel.\n\n&gt;Towelie: *You're* a towel!\n\n&gt;DC: No, you're a towel.\n\n&gt;Towelie: *You're* a towel!\n\n&gt;Stan: [pinching the bridge of his nose] Damnit, Towelie, we on'y have a little bit of time to bring Chef back. The episode is only 20 minutes.\n\nSuddenly, the door to the room opens and the leader of the Super Adventure Club steps in, telling the children they're not taking Chef anywhere. They reveal that the real reason they need Chef is that he is the only one they can use to bring Cthulu back to this world.\n\nThe South Park Cult of Cthulu enter and reveal that they have promised the Super Adventure Club that they can molest any children they want if they help use Chef to bring back Cthulu. The first episode of this two-episode story ends as Darth Chef leaves with the Super Adventure Club, and the leader of the SP Cult of Cthulu rhetorically asks what he should do with these kids.\n\n**Part Two**\n\nThe next episode opens with Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Kenny hanging by their arms in a dungeon in Scotland. The leader of the Super Adventure Club says that he can't wait to molest them, but the leader of the Cult of Cthulu reminds him that Cthulu must first rise before he can molest children to his heart's content.\n\nThey leave the boys alone, and they start trying to figure out how to get out of there. Suddenly, the wall of the dungeon is blown open and Kenny is killed. \"You killed Kenny!\" \"You bastards!\" It turns out that the Loch Ness Monster did that and it asks Stan, Kyle, and Cartman for 'about tree fiddy'. Kyle promises it tree fiddy if it frees them and takes them back to Chef's parents' house.\n\nMeanwhile, in South Park, Kenny wakes up in his bed and puts on his Mysterion outfit. We seen the 'Coon and Friends Alert' go off in Clyde, Token, and Timmy's house, and the all head to the base in Cartman's basement. Mysterion tells them of the situation, and they all go on the plane to Scotland.\n\nCoon &amp; Friends have a makeshift meeting in Chef's parent's basement when they all get there, and they decide to find the Super Adventure Club/Cult of Cthulu and get Chef back. They are able to find them somehow and when they get there, they use Darth Chef's powers to bring back Cthulu.\n\nAt first, Coon and Friends try to get Coon to manipulate it again, but Cthulu is angry at him and doesn't listen. The Cult and the SAC think they've won until the Loch Ness Monster shows up to fight Cthulu. Not to be outdone, Mecha Streissand, fresh off a duet tour with Neil Diamond, shows up to try and out-monster Cthulu and Loch Ness.\n\nThen Towelie shows up, says that when three interdimensional monsters fight, you should always bring a Towel, asks them if they want to get high, and calls Mysterion a Towel.\n\nThe SAC/Cult of Cthulu decide to fight the Coon and Friends for trying to stop Cthulu. Toolshed fires a couple of drill bits into one of their eyes, and he whines that that *really* hurt. Mysterion and the  Coon face off against the leaders of the Cult and SAC, while the other Coon &amp; Friends fight the rest of the Club/Cult.\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere else, a witness tells a mysterious figure that Mecha Streissand, the Loch Ness Monster, and Cthulu are fighting in a death match in Scotland. Suddenly, we see the dark and mysterious figure is Professor Chaos, who rubs his hands together and goes 'Perfect, my plan in almost complete! Soon the world will be in Chaos.'\n\nMysterion, Coon, and the leader of the Cult of Cthulu agree to Roshambo (sp?) to see who wins their fight. Cartman kicks him in the nuts as hard as possibly and he falls to the ground, losing. The leader of the SAC seems to have disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, Toolshed and the Human Kite (Stan &amp; Kyle) are being beaten by the members of the Cult/Club when Chef shows up. They beg Chef for his help, but the leader of the SAC shows up wearing a robe, looking like the Emperor from Star Wars. He tells Kite/Kyle and Toolshed/Stan that Darth Chef is no longer their friend, but his weapon. He laughs, but Chef turns around and kills him much like Vader kills the Emperor.\n\nIn the end, Mint Berry Crunch shows up again to defeat Cthulu and save the day, pissing off Mysterion. After he leaves again, Neil Diamond shows up and asks Barbra to go on another leg of his tour, and she leaves. Finally, with it all over, the Loch Ness Monster turns to Chef's parents and asks for tree fiddy.\n\nBack in South Park, General Disarray tells Professor Chaos that Cthulu and the Super Adventure Club were defeated, and Chaos gets pissed off. When Butters' dad opens the door to the room and asks what they're doing, Butters' voice and personality return to normal and tells his father that they're just playing supervillain. Dougie asks Butters if he wants to burn some ants with a magnifying glass, but Butters says that's too mean, so they end up playing with some dolls or some other pussy shit.\n\nThen, back in Scotland, as the Super Adventure Club is being arrested, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny (along with Clyde, Token and Timmy) ask Darth Chef to come back to South Park and forget the Super Adventure Club.

I'm aware of the percentage of the ocean floor mapped by man, the new species (admittedly not all) found every year, and the amazing and beautiful adaptations and survival systems found in deep sea life.  \n\nGiant squid live at approximately 10k feet, so deep sea for sure, but not bottom. Your observation about sperm whales is correct, however, I was never referencing dive depths, I was referencing permanent life of that size dwelling at the floor of the ocean, as in living there, not just dropping down for a bite.

{"body": "This is only partially correct.  It is the part of TMNT lore that is available commercially.  I wondered myself for awhile why the transition away from the unified red color scheme and why they needed to wear the \"masks\" in the first place.  It is actually a really weird dynamic.\n\nI am kind of a fan boy of TMNT so I am *that guy* that has cropped up the stories that haven't been made available for commercial distribution.  Like the original TMNT stories, the origins tale is really dark and graphic.  You get a snap shot of it in the live-action film during Splinter's flashback but what you saw was covered in frosting and rainbows compared to what Laird and Eastman really wrote.\n\nSplinter is essentially a huge asshole in the origin story.  Like massive.  To the point where calling him racist against turtles is an understatement.  He's a rat and rat's are dirty, mean, thieving animals; that was the logic they used when writing the story.  Essentially what happened was Splinter and the Turtles had this connection and were thrust upon each other.  They had to share the sewer system and initially they didn't get along.  The turtles would somehow scavenge together some food and splinter would come in and steal it and be able to fend off their attacks easily.  Eventually the turtles had to do something to survive so they began to hunt Splinter and captured him.  There is a long segment where splinter is caged and yelling obscenities at the turtles who are keeping watch over him while each turtle gets their own story line searching the sewers and fearing the world above them.\n\nThe turtles begin to run thin on resources and Splinter isn't doing too well either.  This eventually leads to a bargain where Splinter would teach them to defend themselves and remain unseen in the world above in return for his release and a portion of the food they bring back.  Here is where we finally get into the masks.  Splinter can't tell them apart for shit.  None of them have any defining qualities to splinter, they all just look the same and the racist overtones come in at full bore here.  It's like Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino, teaching Thao hard work and skills but still calling him and his family a bunch of gooks.  Shit gets real, and it gets real nasty.  The turtles can't take his shit anymore and they set to attack him and Splinter summarily kicks their asses.  Splinter tells them they need to wear something so that he can tell them apart while training them.  You have to realize the turtles at this point are adolescents and the idea to wear a mask is the coolest thing ever to them.  They get super excited about it but they also don't like the idea of different colored masks because of the connotations for wearing them.  They would all be wearing different colors because their master is so damn racist that he is forcing them to wear them.  So they settle that the different colored masks will be the training ones and the similar colored masks will be what they wear when they are out on their missions to find food.  A unified team.  This is why you see them all wearing red in early TMNT stories.\n\nSo the turtles set out on a mission to find the cloth for their masks.  They set off toward a part of the sewer system that has been closed off.  It's where all the random shit that gets flushed down toilets gets caught in the gates in the sewer system and builds up.  They haven't been able to get here before because in their first attempts something has been guarding the area but they haven't been able to see it.  They get hit and never know where it is coming from, they only end up with injuries.  But now they have some training and are all in one group ready to confront the guardian.  This is the set up for the first major battle in the TMNT franchise.\n\nThey get to the section and Raphael gets hit first.  Then Leonardo, then Donatello, and a swipe is made for Michaelangelo but he spots the attacker and dodges the swipe.  He then yells out \"We don't want to fight!\"\n\nThere are a few frames of silence and then a figure rises in a shadowed area and questions their presence.  They say they are just looking for some cloth to fashion some clothing out of and some weapons to protect themselves with.  There is an angry roar and the turtles group themselves together ready for another attack but it doesn't come.  The figure shouts back that they would use the weapons against him and that they are only trying to kill him.  They plead with the figure and the figure calms down a bit.  He offers them the items they are looking for but he demands payment.  \"I need about tree fiddy\" the figure steps out of the shadowed tunnel into the light shining down from the manhole above and the loch ness monster appears.  Fucking loch ness monster made the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pay tree fiddy for some cloth and the signature weapons you know them to wield today.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332292739", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 429, "controversiality": 0}

Examples: asymmetrical, apolitical.\n\nTheism: noun, belief in the existence of a god or gods.\n\nNow, put it together:\n\nAtheism: lack of, or without belief in the existence of a god or gods.\n\nThat's how compound words work.

Shit like this is why I don't really care what philosophers have to say.\n\n&gt;You're completely unaware of even who these philosophers let alone what they argue, yet you're absolutely convinced of your ability to dismantle whatever it is they have to say.\n\nNot dismantle - dismiss. When their arguments rely on them redefining words, then their arguments are weak linguistic and semantic trickery. \n\n&gt;Clearly you're attached to the label atheist, and you're here so you at least like the impression of being intellectual, so why would you be interested in dismissing the arguments of professional atheists philosophers out of hand?\n\nBecause I have better things to do with my time.

It's far more fulfilling than going around and redefining words just because somebody thinks the *actual* definition \"is not intellectually viable\".\n\n&gt;Read all of those links\n\nNo. If I had infinite time and infinite patience, then I'd consider it. But since I've only got about 30-50 years left to live, I'm not gonna spend it all reading whatever philosophical ramblings some random person on the internet says I should. So one of the ways I whittle down the list of things I'm gonna spend my time on is examining a few basic things. For example - the definition of \"atheism\" is quite simple, as I outlined above. That definition does not change just because some philosopher thinks that \"weak atheism is not intellectually viable\". \n\n&gt;They believe there is probably no God and they argue there is probably no God.\n\nThis is quite simple - a LOT of people think a LOT of things exist. Lizard people, bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, chupacabra, vampires, fairies, angels, more flavours of deities than Baskin Robbins has ice cream, etc. It's absolutely retarded to think that I should delve in to *any* of them to figure out why they *don't* exist until believers are able to present evidence as to why they *do* exist. It's exceedingly simple. \n\n&gt;I think the theist arguments have won but because people like you are so completely ignorant of the topic that they can't even get straight what atheism even is, what arguments actually support it, and what obstacles there are for atheists to overcome.\n\nNo, theist arguments have been *believed* because people so rarely call them on their bullshit. Bullshit like linguistic trickery and attempt to completely shortcut the scientific method because they can't meet the standard of evidence. \n\n&gt;And yet you feel justified in spewing your nonsense in the most jackass way you can muster.\n\nI am *fully* justified because I am using the single most effective heuristic ever developed by humanity - the scientific method. And the scientific method dictates that if *you* can't demonstrate that something exists after *you* say it does, then *I* am fully, 100% justified in dismissing you.\n\nSo, what makes you think you can and/or should replace the scientific method with philosophizing?

{"body": "&gt;Nope. This is simple:  \nA-: prefix, denoting \"lack of, or without\". Examples: asymmetrical, apolitical.  \nTheism: noun, belief in the existence of a god or gods.  \nNow, put it together:  \nAtheism: lack of, or without belief in the existence of a god or gods.  \n\nUnfortunately linguistics isn't algebra. Let me show you why this is the incorrect way to go about determining the useful definition of a word and then let me show you where the word atheism is defined as something other than your linguistic formulation allows.\n\nStep 1: Consider the word \"Scientism.\" Scientism is a pejorative term meaning the improper usage of science or scientific claims. The -ism suffix indicates a belief or a principle (*e.g.* theism, deism, agnosticism, capitalism, monism, atheism). The -ist suffix means one who follows a principle or system of belief (*e.g.* theist, deist, capitalist, monist, atheist). Therefore, a *scientist* is one who follows the principle scientism. Therefore, according to the linguistic algebra, scientists are guilty of the improper usage of science or scientific claims. \n\nNow that may be true *somtimes*, but in general, I think it's quite silly to suggest that scientists are defined as those who improperly use science or scientific claims. Therefore, we know that linguistic algebra of this nature doesn't always lead us to the correct usage of words.\n\nStep 2: How is *atheism* defined? You suggest that atheism must simply be non-theism or lacking the belief of theists. I agree that this is *one* definition of the term but that atheism is also defined as one who believes that God probably does not exist. How do we check definitions? We look in the dictionary.\n\nFrom the [American Heritage Dictionary](http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=atheism&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0):\n\n&gt;**a·the·ism** (*ā'thē-ĭz′əm*)  \n*n.*  \nDisbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods.\n\nFrom [Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism):\n\n&gt;athe·ism noun (ˈā-thē-ˌi-zəm)  \n1 archaic : ungodliness, wickedness  \n2 a : a disbelief in the existence of deity  \nb : the doctrine that there is no deity  \n\nFrom [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheism):\n\n&gt;a·the·ism   [ey-thee-iz-uhm]  \nnoun  \n1. the doctrine or belief that there is no God.  \n2. disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings.  \n\nThat should suffice for now to illustrate that atheism is defined both as the belief that there is no God *and* as the disbelief in the existence of a deity. Therefore, the issue is *not* how is atheism defined, we know how it is defined, we have the definitions. The issue is how should rational people use the word. Once again, we can know how rational people use the word \"atheism\" because we know that using it to mean a lack of belief is not an intellectually viable position. Since rational people purposefully avoid adhering to ideas that are not intellectually viable, a rational person should be defining atheism to mean the belief that there is no God.\n\n&gt;Not dismantle - dismiss. When their arguments rely on them redefining words, then their arguments are weak linguistic and semantic trickery.\n\nAs I have just proven, nobody is redefining anything. What philosophers are doing is justifying the intellectually viable position of atheism. You have no rational basis for your dismissal. You wouldn't know what the arguments consist of *because you are purposefully keeping them hidden from yourself*. This is *exactly* what the fundamentalist religious person does. Maintaining one's beliefs by avoiding anything that might be seen as contrary is not what rational people do.\n\n&gt;Because I have better things to do with my time. Masturbation, for instance. It's far more fulfilling than going around and redefining words just because somebody thinks the actual definition \"is not intellectually viable\".\n\nNot *thinks* but rather *successfully argues* using valid arguments with sound premises.\n\n&gt;For example - the definition of \"atheism\" is quite simple, as I outlined above. That definition does not change just because some philosopher thinks that \"weak atheism is not intellectually viable\".\n\nAnd I've just shown conclusively why your linguistic algebraic formulation isn't automatically preferred. Further, I showed you that atheism is defined as something other than the formulation you prefer. Finally, I've given you a link to an argument that proves conclusively that your preferred formulation is not intellectually viable in the first place. The rational person, having had their arguments so thoroughly refuted would abandon them. Sadly, not all atheists are rational despite their personal view of being hyper-rational thinkers.\n\n&gt;This is quite simple - a LOT of people think a LOT of things exist. Lizard people, bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, chupacabra, vampires, fairies, angels, more flavours of deities than Baskin Robbins has ice cream, etc. It's absolutely retarded to think that I should delve in to any of them to figure out why they don't exist until believers are able to present evidence as to why they do exist. It's exceedingly simple.\n\nWhat is simple is that you don't even know what you don't know. You're *completely* ignorant of the philosophy of religion, what arguments there are for the existence of God, what arguments there are against the existence of God, how humans obtain knowledge (particularly in areas that are out of the reach of methodological materialism), or why the argument you made is complete nonsense.\n\nI can lead a horse to water, but I can't make him drink.\n\n&gt;No, theist arguments have been believed because people so rarely call them on their bullshit. Bullshit like linguistic trickery and attempt to completely shortcut the scientific method because they can't meet the standard of evidence.\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n&gt;I am fully justified because I am using the single most effective heuristic ever developed by humanity - the scientific method. And the scientific method dictates that if you can't demonstrate that something exists after you say it does, then I am fully, 100% justified in dismissing you.\n\nSome knowledge and some ideas are completely out of the realm of methodological materialism (the scientific method). Furthermore, the scientific method *itself* is based on philosophy. Without philosophy, the scientific method doesn't even get off the ground. So suggesting that philosophy doesn't work or can't lead us to knowledge *automatically* invalidates the scientific method *itself*. \n\nSo philosophy is useful. We know it is useful because we use it every day to help us tackle problems that the scientific method cannot reach. Moreover, if we deny the validity of philosophy, we are using philosophy itself to make that denial (since this is a metaphysical statement). And if philosophy is not valid, then our argument that philosophy is not valid is not valid. So your argument loses either way.\n\n&gt;So, what makes you think you can and/or should replace the scientific method with philosophizing?\n\nI have *not once* even *implied* that we should replace the scientific method. What I have said is that the scientific method is not the only way to gain knowledge. The scientific method is *fantastic* at the areas for which it has access, but it is powerless when it comes to metaphysical claims. What I'm suggesting is that philosophy should be used along with the scientific method and that these two epistemologies are not in conflict but must be used in unison. Further, I argue that denying the validity of philosophy is a **major** problem that atheism is facing in modern times. Atheists denying the validity of philosophy is no less problematic for atheism than creationists denying the validity of the scientific method is problematic for creationism.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332426212", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is actually explained pretty well in the comics. Mom's Friendly Robot Company doesn't just print circuit boards, slap all the components together, and upload a common program to all the robots they produce. The actual process of manufacturing a Mom's robot is really quite complex.\n\nProfessor Farnsworth was responsible for the hardware design of the bending units but there was another, more sinister developer involved in actually giving the robots the intelligence and characteristics which have made them so human. This all results from an evolutionary algorithm which develops its own program much in the way that a human mind develops. It was the result of hundreds of thousands of \"generations\" of increasingly complex machines running the code over and over again, with little variations here and there, that caused it to evolve, with some artificial selection involved, into a base program that would be loaded into reusable proto-bots (simpler versions, like Baby Bender here, of the final product into which the programming would be uploaded) where it would undergo further self-modification to tailor itself to the newly fitted hardware. Millions of terabytes of code were tested and discarded in the process. The base program would be akin to that of a newborn's brain: capable of the most basic stimulus-response but no real capacity for thinking or learning.\n\nSimply copying the code and mass-loading it into multiple copies of the same robot is not possible because the manufacturing variations are too numerous and too complex to make it cost effective to drive to zero defects. Things like input voltage from various sensors, capacitances in motor circuits, even tension stress in the materials were variables that, when put together, were not feasible to be predicted within manufacturing tolerances (remember, Mom's concern for the bottom line). It turns out that it's cheaper to let the base program grow by loading it into a simple version of the robot and having it perform a variety of tasks before being copied into the final product. As a result, a robot develops a personality along with its reflexes and cognition as its program adapts to the input/output stimuli in the early testing phases; a soul evolves, if you will. The company's archiving policy mandates that robots who have developed enough to comprehend a sense of self-recognition but do not pass muster for whatever reason have their programming uploaded to the Eternal Database, where their subroutines run continuously under closely-monitored optimal hardware configurations (kind of like Moriarty and his ladyfriend in the next generation of the forbidden show). \n\nSo one day, Professor gets curious as to how all of his \"forgotten\" children are doing in the Central Database: what new memories have they developed having been in contact with each other, how they are interacting with uploaded robot programs waiting to be transferred to the next robot body (they tend to queue during wars and major construction projects when supply can't keep up), if there's anything he can do to make them happier and more comfortable. He tracks down the department head for the Eternal Database and it's basically this underfunded, forgotten corner of IT in the lowest sub basement of Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's Heartland. The room is almost completely dark, illuminated by a single, flickering flourescent light. What's more, the department is only one person, a fat, bulbous shadowy fellow who sits there day and night, his job long since downsized but having never had the heart to leave the Eternal Database. The ED, as it turns out, is actually an antique personal computer, not even enough memory or processing power to run one modern robot program, much less thousands. Backup disks and tapes are scattered around the room - long lost relics of obsolete robot personas. The DBA explains to Professor that there is no active Eternal Database; robots that don't meet Mom's standards are terminated, their programs are not uploaded and, for all intents and purposes, die as children. The money simply wasn't allocated to purchase and maintain the computer resources needed to keep all these programs running forever. Aghast, Professor asks him what it will take to purchase the equipment and hire the engineers to design such a system. The shadowy figure responds, \"I need about tree-fiddy.\" Three dollars and fifty cents. Goddamn Loch Ness Monster alive and well in the 31st century, wanted Professor pay him tree fiddy for some computer.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332476751", "subreddit": "futurama", "score": 17, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was in Jr. year of high school and there was a new exchange student from germany. She was in our grade, but she strutted with class and seemed to have an aura of maturity. She was beautiful yet reserved, and seemed to carry herself like she was above the common jocks who would practically grovel, drooling before her. We had 2 classes together, AP calc in the morning and english in the afternoon. People chose their seats for both of these classes, and hers was always by the window surrounded by a ring of flexing men. She didn't care, she always seemed to be aloof of their displays, daydreaming out the window. I was far too shy to sit anywhere near her, but I always had a view and would daydream with her. \n\nI remember losing myself one morning as I watched her short blonde hair tossing carelessly in the draft of an open window. It seemed to translucently shimmer in the morning sun, fading from gold to platinum. I couldn't be bothered by class some days, and my dreams tuned out the roughhousing brutes durrounding her. My warm thoughts were quenched when as the teacher's voice penetrated my artificial silence. Looking up, the entire class was staring at me. \"I said can you plese switch seats mith Michael so we can get on with the lecture\" the teacher said. I nodded, and gathered my things, still disoriented. Michael sauntered past as his rowdy friends snickered. That's whenI noticed which seat was empty.\n\nI stumbled nervously into the chair next to Millie, the exchange student I had admired from afar. She smiled, moreso at my awkward landing than at me personally. The teacher passed out our papers, chastising us on our 'record low' grades. I was a whiz at math and had been asked to tutor multiple times, so I had no worries, but maybe I would get my chance to put those skills to worthy use. I figured with how long she spent staring away from the classroom, Millie would probably do poorly and I could be assigned as a tutor! I don't know how my mind wandered to such a conclusion, but it was quickly brought back on course when I caught a glimpse of her paper. We both scored a 97, and I began to realize that we weren't all that different, we were both to amused with our own thoughts and independent enough to do without the lectures of others. My mind raced wildly off track, pondering what else we could have in common.\n\n\"How did you do?\" I snapped back to the shuffling classroom and looked up. Oh shit, it was millie, she must have caught me staring, I must have dropped my guard forgetting how close I was. \"Uh, good\" I was slackjawed in disbelief that she would actually be talking to me. \"Me too.\" She said, pointing to her paper \"we gotdifferent questions wrong. Could you show me how to do number 7?\" \"Y-Yeah\" I responded \"Is dinner, uh I mean... lunch good for you?\" She nodded.\n\nAt lunch she was sitting amogst the lively and cackling flock of popular girls. This was forbidden territory, If I were to set foot anywhere near that table I would be pecked to bits by a squaking swarm of self intitled teenagers. Too late. She saw me and waved me over. The table went silent, and I was met with parallel rows of judgemental stares. \"Can you scoot down a bit Marsha?\" she said to the girl across from her. \"I guess so\" she begrudgingly responded, only to get up and torm off. Millie had such a friendly smile and soft eyes that I felt comfortable ignoring the rest of the table. We finished with the math problem and I was left sitting there not knowing what to do next.\n\nShe must have sensed my nervousness and she giggled softly \"It's nice out, want to go outside?\" we wern;t allowed out, but she stood up and left the cafeteria as if there were nobody at all to stop her, and I followed. She sat on a bench, crossing her legs like a lady, her hair sparkling in the sun reflecting the perfect picture I had seen from afar. I sat next to her and we talked like old friends for the rest of the period. She was interested in all of the boring nuances of nerdiness I tried to hold back, and giggled charmingly at every awkward misstep in my speech. As the bell rang, she turned and looked me in the eyes and pulled me close for a tender kiss. As she pulled slowly away I saw a sullen glimmer of apology. \"You're a nice guy, and you seem like you have everything I've wanted in a man, even if you're shy and funny.\" \"Yeah, you're amazing\" I said, trying to feign enthusiasm, though I was sure of what she was about to tell me. \"You have everything I want in a personality, buit there's more to it that I need.\" she said with her pouting eyes still meeting mine with sincerity \"what? what is it?\" I said, practically pleading with her. \"About tree fiddy\" she replied, and suddenyl I became aware that this sweet young lady was actually a 3 story monster fromthe paleolithic era.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332518063", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 41, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Here are the DOIs for the associated papers.\n\nThanks for the links, looks like some food for thought.\n\n&gt; Not necessarily. Atheists are simply people who, when presented with the claim \"god exists\", say \"I don't believe you\".\n\nThis makes the term \"atheism\" psychological, and not philosophical. Do you see what I mean by this? \"I don't believe you\" isn't a truth claim that can be proven true (philosophically), it's just a psychological statement about your state of belief on the issue.\n\n&gt; I personally think it's important to develop a [3] clear, well-considered philosophy, but not everyone does. You're holding a double standard; you're saying it's okay for Christians to accept that there is a god without thinking about it too hard, but atheists have to do a lot more work and do in-depth study of philosophy to not accept the claim.\n\nI can see what you mean here. It's just that every atheist I've come across says being intellectual is vital to who they are, and honestly this seems justified by the research you present. But I guess it's not inherently necessary to the claim, it's not as though intelligence is measured solely in philosophy.\n\nAs I said before, the claim of atheism must be \"God does not exist\". Lack of belief, or \"I don't believe you\" is agnosticism, not atheism. I don't think anyone would want to claim they're synonyms, it seems a bit redundant to me.\n\nAlso, I don't advocate that Christians trust God with a fideistic/blind faith, but an [intellectual one](http://winteryknight.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/does-the-bible-teach-that-faith-is-opposed-to-logic-and-evidence-3/). Actually, I'm pretty sure I sent you that link in a previous conversation.\n\n&gt; It's also not evidence of presence. And that's all that's being argued.\n\nOf course it's not, I'm not making the claim that it is. The point I brought up here is that all the rational person can conclude is agnosticism.\n\n&gt; No, there's still probability. There's probably no god, because if there were, we should have found such a thing by now. The theistic gods that have been proposed are described as doing things, as having effects on the world around us. Those effects have never, despite much searching, been reliably detected. And if you define god in a way that we can't test for it, that's not my fault. Untestable claims are indistinguishable from fiction.\n\nOf course there's probability :) but, now it seems you're defending the original claim of atheism, that God doesn't exist? At the very least, it seems like an argument for his non-existence. So then, I would believe that you are rationally an atheist *if* this argument holds water.\n\nHere I want to copy and paste a pretty lengthy bit from WLC on the matter. I apologize for the length, but it really is comprehensive. It's from [here](http://www.bethinking.org/advanced/religious-epistemology.htm), which is even longer (I'm not gonna ask you to read the whole thing). But I really do feel like this portion is beneficial to look over:\n\n&gt; The problem with such a position is captured neatly by the aphorism “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” For example, in theoretical physics entities are frequently postulated for which there is (as yet) no evidence, but that absence of evidence in no way justifies one in thinking that such entities do not exist. To give an illustration, it has become commonplace in astrophysical cosmology to postulate an early inflationary era in the expansion of the universe in order to explain such features of the universe as its flat space-time curvature and large scale isotropy. Unfortunately, by the very nature of the case, any evidence of such an era will have been pushed by the inflationary expansion out beyond our event horizon, so that it is unobservable. But woe be to the cosmologist who asserts that this absence of evidence is proof that inflation did not take place! At best we are left with agnosticism.\n\n&gt;Now clearly there are cases in which the absence of evidence does constitute evidence of absence. If some one were to assert that there is an elephant on the quad, then the failure to observe an elephant there would be good reason to think that there is no elephant there. But if someone were to assert that there is a flea on the quad, then one’s failure to observe it there would not constitute good evidence that there is no flea on the quad. The salient difference between these two cases is that in the one, but not the other, we should expect to see some evidence of the entity if in fact it exists. Thus, the absence of evidence is evidence of absence only in cases in which, were the postulated entity to exist, we should expect to have some evidence of its existence. Moreover, the justification conferred in such cases will be proportional to the ratio between the amount of evidence that we do have and the amount of evidence that we should expect to have if the entity existed. If the ratio is small, then little justification is conferred on the belief that the entity does not exist.\n\n&gt;Again, the advocates of the presumption of atheism recognized this. Michael Scriven, for example, maintained that in the absence of evidence rendering the existence of some entity probable, we are justified in believing that it does not exist, provided that (1) it is not something which might leave no traces, and (2) we have comprehensively surveyed the area where the evidence would be found if the entity existed. But if this is correct, then our justification for atheism depends on (1) the probability that God would leave more evidence of His existence than what we have and (2) the probability that we have comprehensively surveyed the field for evidence of His existence That puts a different face on the matter! Suddenly the presumer of atheism, who sought to shirk his share of the burden of proof, finds himself saddled with the very considerable burden of proving (1) and (2) to be the case.\n\n&gt;The debate among contemporary philosophers has therefore moved beyond the facile presumption of atheism to a discussion of the so-called “Hiddenness of God” --in effect, a discussion of the probability or expectation that God, if He existed, would leave more evidence of His existence than what we have. One’s perspective on this issue cannot but be influenced by one’s assessment of the project of natural theology (see chapters 27-28). For if one is convinced that God has left pretty convincing evidence of His existence, then one is apt to be skeptical that we should expect to see much more evidence of His existence than that which we have. Scriven, in the end, held that we are justified in rejecting the existence of some entity only if the claim that it exists is wholly unsupported, that is to say, there is no particular evidence for it and not even general considerations in its favor. By this criterion, Scriven advocated that we remain merely agnostic, rather than disbelieving, even about such entities as the Loch Ness monster and the Abominable Snowman! But surely any unprejudiced observer will discern as much evidence for God as for the Loch Ness monster.\n\n&gt; Unsatisfied with the evidence we have, some atheists have argued that God, if He existed, would have prevented the world’s unbelief by making His existence starkly apparent (say, by inscribing the label “Made by God” on every atom or planting a neon cross in the heavens with the message “Jesus Saves.” But why should God want to do such a thing? As Paul Moser has emphasized, on the Christian view it is actually a matter of relative indifference to God whether people believe that He exists or not. For what God is interested in is building a love relationship with us, not just getting us to believe that He exists. Even the demons believe that God exists—and tremble, for they have no saving relationship with Him (James 2.19). Of course, in order to believe in God, we must believe that God exists. But there is no reason at all to think that if God were to make His existence more manifest, more people would come into a saving relationship with Him. Mere showmanship will not bring about a change of heart (Luke 16.30-31). It is interesting that, as the Bible describes the history of God’s dealings with mankind, there has been a progressive “interiorization” of this interaction with an increasing emphasis on the Spirit’s witness to our inner selves (Rom. 8.16-17). In the Old Testament God is described as revealing Himself to His people in manifest wonders: the plagues upon Egypt, the pillar of fire and smoke, the parting the Red Sea. But did such wonders produce lasting heart-change in the people? No, Israel fell into apostasy with tiresome repetitiveness. If God were to inscribe His name on every atom or place a neon cross in the sky, people might believe that He exists; but what confidence could we have that after time they would not begin to chafe under the brazen advertisements of their Creator and even come to resent such effrontery? In fact, we have no way of knowing that in a world of free creatures in which God’s existence is as obvious as the nose on your face that more people would come to love Him and know His salvation than in the actual world. But then the claim that if God existed, He would make His existence more evident has little or no warrant, thereby undermining the claim that the absence of such evidence is itself positive evidence that God does not exist.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332620535", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I understand where you are trying to come from, but I don't agree with some of your claims.  These are just my points of view, and you are welcome to disagree, and hopefully we can discuss this honestly and openly.  \n\n&gt;While you could argue that a biologist would know more about evolution than an ancient text would (and I would be inclined to agree), you are still placing faith in that biologist.\n\nIt isn't placing faith because the evidence is available and open for questioning and skepticism.  As an evolutionary biologist, all of my life's work up until now is open and accessible on multiple websites.  My methods were laid out in excruciating detail (to the level that in one study, I quantified the maximum level of available sunlight throughout my study) and can be completely replicated by anybody who is interested.  Moreover, all of my methods, the actual data I collected, the statistics i used to analyze the data, and the results are reported are open access through the society for the study of evolution.  If that wasn't enough, every time I want to publish, I have to pass a peer-review process where at minimum, two Ph.D'd biologists, have to assess whether or not my data and the manner in which I collected it is sound.  There is no faith required in re-reporting my results or citing my studies.  There is faith required in citing the bible, for example.  The bible is very vague on how the Earth was created.  There is no empirical evidence to support its arguments, and there were no experts who reviewed its findings.  \n\n&gt;Also, the concept of atheism as we know is almost entirely based on faith: the belief that there is no higher power.\n\nThis is simply not true, atheism is simply a disbelief.  Faith requires believing in something with no evidence.  There is no demonstrable universal evidence of god, so believing in one requires one to have faith.  That's completely fine, there's nothing inherently wrong with having faith in a god, but taking the default position does not require faith.  It does not require faith to not believe somebody when they say the Loch Ness Monster exists.\n\n&gt;there isn't a single shred of scientific evidence disproving the existence of a god, and there probably never will be\n\nYou are correct, but you are viewing the burden of proof incorrectly.  Theists are asserting that there is in fact a god.  They developed the assertion and therefore the burden of proof is on them.  Atheists are not required to provide any evidence to the contrary, they are only required to ask for proof.  As a very simple (and commonly used) example, let's say we ran into each other on the street.  I then said to you, \"Hey MadManMax55, have I ever told you I can fly?\"  Your response may be \"I don't believe you.\"  In turn I would say \"Well then disprove that I can't fly.\"  Do you see where the issue arises?  I made the assertion that I can fly, therefore it is up to me to provide evidence that I can.  It's not your responsibility to disprove my ability to fly.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332872981", "subreddit": "circlebroke", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Even if Barack Obama's parents and family had wanted to travel away from their home so his birth could take place at hospital facilities within a large city, they would likely have set out for the much closer city of Nairobi.\nWithin a few days the certificate was clearly revealed to be a fake — it was actually a forgery based on a copy of an Australian Registration of Birth issued to one David Jeffrey Bomford (who was born in South Australia in 1959) which was grabbed off the Internet and used as a template for creating the fake Kenyan certificate: ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1332888399", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Honestly, I wish I were religious.\n  \nThere was a study asking participants to rate their intelligence and attractiveness. Then the researchers assessed how accurate their answers were with IQ tests and unbiased assessments of their attractiveness.\nAlmost every group believed themselves to be smarter and more attractive than they really were, except one... The clinically depressed. \n  \nThe truth is, there's value in self-delusion. Religious people are, on average, happier than their enlightened counterparts, and for good reason. Believing that the world is entirely designed by an omnipotent being, who will grant you and everyone around you with eternal happiness, just for believing that story (and a small weekly contribution), is hugely comforting. Then, you're an immediate member of this whole community of people who share these beliefs and think you're at least somewhat awesome for sharing those beliefs as well. This provides people with a lot of tangible means of support in day care, after school activities, carpools etc. And on top of all this, your love/fear of this omnipotent being helps you with inhibition control since you feel as though someone's always watching you. \n  \nNow, I can't do it. I think it's actually immoral to outsource your beliefs of morality to an outside influence. For instance, 69% of Christians supported the Iraq war, and, while some would credit religion with all forms of human compassion, I believe that the desire to go good to one another is an innate human quality, and that religious influence is often contributes segregation, thereby justifying cruelty, and religious people are often manipulated due to their willingness to obey without reason. Also, I just don't like the idea of faith. Determining that your character is partly valued by your ability to believe things without evidence and without question is a horrible way to think. I value the ability to be critical, introspective, and to seek out the truth in the world.\n  \nSo, I religion clearly isn't for me. Even if I wanted to become religious, I don't think I could do it. I'd be more likely to believe in Sasquatch or the Loch Ness monster, but the numbers don't lie: religious people are generally happier, more successful, and more satisfied with their lives than those who don't believe in the supernatural. And, while I criticize religious people for skewed views of morality, you have to credit religious people for spending a lot of time thinking about it. A lot of people don't spend an hour a month contemplating the desire to be a good person, let alone once a week, and, while there are some prominent religious hypocrisies agonizing public policy, much of what the church does is good. I don't care if you think an octopus named Cecil put you on earth to eradicate the wombats, if you start a non-profit soup kitchen for the homeless, that's a cool thing to do. \n  \nBut, this is going to be a difficult situation for you because indoctrinating children isn't that easy to do. If any prominent figure in her life is casting doubt on the subject, odds are, the idea won't take. It's like Santa Clause. You \"find out\" that Santa isn't real, and there's no going back. The cat's out of the bag. If you want her to believe in god, you'll have to pretend to believe in God too, or at least agree not to talk about what you think about the subject for a decade or so until the illusion has had time to cement. Or maybe you could take advantage of that fact, and simply agree to do all of the religious stuff you husband wants so long as you preserve your own right to be vocal about your beliefs as well. This way the child will end up an atheist with a Christian upbringing, and should have the best of both worlds.
