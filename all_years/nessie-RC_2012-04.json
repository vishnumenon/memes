{"body": "Honestly, I think the origin of Agnosticism's popularity is the fact that it isn't perceived as \"aggressive\" towards religious positions and is therefore more likely to be assumed by someone who is moving away from a theist upbringing than Atheism.\n\nI guess my point is that when you have mountains of evidence on one hand and on the other a claim that can't be dis-proven but with no evidence, The answer should not be, \"I can't answer this question\". The answer should always be \"I'm going to act under the assumption the evidence proves until I see contrary evidence.\" This is what I don't get about agnosticism as a continued view of the world beyond a transitional phase of questioning one's own religious position:\n\nThe question of the existence of a creator deity is impossible to *conclusively* deny, but there are ways of weighting evidence that lead us to the more likely conclusion. The fact that we cannot conclusively deny the existence of \"God\" does not mean that the two answers hold equal logical merit.\n\nI cannot disprove the existence of a whole host of ideas that have developed by humanity, from unicorns to the loch ness monster. That does not mean I hold equal weight between the two potential positions of existence vs non-existence for these entities. I operate on the assumption that unicorns are non-existent and I will continue to do so until such a time as I am presented with evidence to the contrary.\n\nThat doesn't mean I \"know\" god doesn't exists.

{"body": "1)  The idea that evolution is false, or that it may be true but should not be taught in public schools.  Ten years ago I would have put this issue much lower on the list because I was under the impression that if someone did not know about evolution it meant only that they lacked specific knowledge about an area biology.  Over time I have discovered how this theory permeates so many different fields:  psychology, behavioral science, environmental sciences, geology, history, social sciences, etc.  No individual has any hope of understanding the overall scope of all these different disciplines, but knowing the basic timeline and mechanisms involved in evolution gives you a sort of blueprint to figure out how the world operates.  Without this blueprint you will constantly struggle to understand human imperfection, which is what leads people to so many other types of pseudoscience.\n\n2)  Anti-vaccination hysteria.  I'm not that worried about civilization being wiped out by smallpox, but the anti-vaxers  seem to cling to the idea that the fields of epidemiology and biochemistry are not only corrupt, but that they are completely made up.  They have intertwined logic and emotion more than any other group of people, and logic isn't going to prevail in that fight.\n\n3) 9/11 conspiracy theories.  What bothers me so much about these is that they are actually grasping at some real problems:  governments being dishonest, mainstream media doing a crappy job at explaining global politics, military agencies taking advantage of fear, and citizens not holding these agencies accountable for their failures.  They take these real concerns and latch them on to a story that a ten year old can recognize is nonsense.  Every single rational person that has spent years criticizing the government and media gets to see their work ignored because they are going to get lumped in with these lunatics.\n\n4)  Climate change denial (not skeptics).  If you disagree with Cap and Trade or government funding of environmentally friendly companies that is a political decision.  If you disagree that CO2 is not a greenhouse gas and that we should not attempt to reduce emissions your are purposely murdering our planet.\n\n5)  GMO/synthetic chemicals are inherently bad.  A carbon atom is a carbon atom.  It doesn't matter what techniques are use to create it, it's still the same atom.  If you have a problem with Monsanto, it's a problem with Monsanto - not the science behind gene modification\n\n6-10)  David Icke, Peter Popoff, Mike Adams, Kevin Trudeau, and L. Ron Hubbard.

They offer the perfect training exercise for people that are skeptical and want to understand human psychology. \n\n-Religious claims that don't involve personal discrimination.  If you want to believe Jesus did something 2000 years ago and it makes you feel good go wild.\n\n-Homeopathy.  As with the psychics, it is a fantastic introduction into the laws of chemistry, and gives people a harmless way to explore pseudoscience (assuming they don't avoid real medical treatment).\n\n-UFO claims.

{"body": "I was 18 and it was february of my senior year in high school. This girl had been my best friend since freshman year, and although we occasionally flirted a bit, it always seemed like just joking around and being playful. She was beautiful, the kind of girl that I was happy being friends with, but refused to make any kind of move because I believed more than anything that she would reject me. Of course, neither of us were dating anyone at the time, so I decide to ask her to the prom...\nas friends.  Im not sure how it is for other schools, but at mine a student had to decide who they were going with to the May prom in February so that they could get tickets together and sit at the same table for dinner etc. So after asking her, I feel like she may realize that I have a crush on her, so, since I was young and foolish, I tried as hard as I could to keep from making anything that could be remotely construed as a move, just so that things would not become awkward. We continue hanging out, I was being painfully careful, and we plan that a group of our friends were going to meet at my house so we could all split a limo. She finds her dress, and refuses to let me see it until the night of prom, but gives me a fabric swatch so that I could match my tux. The color was black, so I figured matching would be fairly easy. I ordered my tux and a corsage for her. Fast forward to prom night, which also happened to be her birthday. She lived about a mile away from me, and since she didn't want to drive in her dress and heels, I decided that I would drive her to my house a little early so we could take pictures with our friends before we all left. I pull up to her house, and as she walks out, I know that this is going to be a painful night. You see, she was always beautiful, but in a very sporty way. Most days, she wore jeans and little to no makeup, and I don't think I had ever before seen her in a dress. Her hair was normally just slightly wavy, but often pulled up loosely for convenience. Being with her like this was hard enough, but that night, she went all out. I don't know the sartorial terms for these things, but I will describe them as best possible. She wore a Black dress, that reflected nearly purple in the daylight, It was cut out at the back and hung straight down to her ankles. It was high necked, but with a cutout at the throat. Her hair hung in a black silk curtain down to her shoulders, and she wore just enough makeup to look elegant. For a few seconds I didn't think I would be able to take my eyes off her long enough to look at the road. Luckily I was able to compose myself before greeting her with an elegant \"fjdonbahow\" and just shortened it to \"wow\". She blushed, and told me that she was embarassed because she did not like wearing dresses. I told her she was beautiful, then I told her happy birthday and got on one knee to give her the corsage (the kind that goes on her wrist). Luckily the corsage matched her dress, as well as the boutonniere that she had gotten me. Somehow she managed to pin the boutonniere on me with no trouble (which is ridiculous, those things are impossible) and I drove her over to my house. We take pictures, as a group with our friends, individually, and in every other concievable manner. When it came time to leave, we all climbed into the limo and just talked, joked, and screamed loudly to old nineties songs the entire way there, all the while I was conscious of her proximity, I bet you could have asked me at any time of night and I would have been able to tell you her distance from me, accurate to about a centimeter without hesitation. Prom king and queen voting happened at the beginning of the night, and our mutual friend decided to campaign for my date to be queen since it was her birthday (although she probably would have won anyway).Prom itself was the same as any prom: we ate, we danced(I made sure that there was space between us) and I licked the ice sculpture that depicted our graduation year while she laughed, blushed, and told me to quit it. During dinner all of her friends said how great she looked, and all of my friends asked her (in all seriousness) what she was doing with me. Nothing of import happened until the final two songs of the night. Our prom song that year was Eve 6's \"here's to the night.\" Right before the playing of this song, the Queen and King were announced. There was a great deal of cheering but no note of surprise from anyone (except her) when my date won Queen. I was much more surprised when I was crowned King (I learned later that our friend had added me to the campaign since I was this girl's date.) The song starts to play and we begin to dance. Rather than the usual \"she puts her arms around my neck, I put my arms around her waist and we sway\" dancing, I take her hand in mine and place my other hand around her waist in an attempt at more formal dancing. she giggles, since most of our friends were watching (it was the king/queen dance after all), but soon everyone else starts slow dancing as well. The final song of the night comes on, and it is Journey's \"Open Arms\" I try the stereotypical style of dancing (mentioned earlier) with her, making sure to keep at least 6 inches of space between us. She on the other hand, decided that wasn't going to work, so she pulls me closer, much closer, and we danced. At midnight the song ends, and she whispers in my ear \"thank you for the best birthday ever\", then kisses me on the cheek. I blushed and muttered something suitably awkward and incomprehensible, completely blindsided. On the way back to the limo with our friends I decided it meant nothing serious. So we get in the limo and head back to my house with all of our friends. Apparently one of themwas having a party, but my date said she was too tired. On arriving at my house, she says she is going home, so I offer her a ride. Our friends leave to go party, but she says she would rather I walk home with her. At the time I was a bit confused, since through the walk home she seemed very tired, as she took off her heals and was leaning on my arm the whole walk (Yes, I am that oblivious). We get to her place and she says that her parents were out of town for the weekend, and that she wanted me to come in to watch a movie. I start heading to her living room, but she says she wants to watch it in her room, so I follow her upstairs. She lays down on the bed and I walk over to her movie collection. She says my name from behind me and I turn around to see her standing there. She leans in close and whispers to me \"this is the best night of my life.\" I smile and tell her that I am glad I could make her happy, mind reeling and confused as to what is happening. She has her arms around the back of my neck and is staring into my eyes, she glances down at my lips and glances back up to my eyes, smiling. She says she no longer wants to watch a movie. I ask \"what do you want\" and She responds \"about tree-fiddy\" and it was about this time I realized she was an eight story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\n**TL;DR Didn't get laid on prom night...fucking Loch Ness Monster**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1333812052", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 40, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I did return that Friday, but the best happened two weeks later. \n\nFirst a little explanation. So there are these things called WIC checks and Food stamp credit cards. WIC checks have a set item on each one saying something like \"With this check you can buy (insert item(s))\". You must get that exact brand and size and amount or less. They are for people on welfare with kids under 2. Food stamp cards are also for people on welfare. They usually get about 300$ every 2 weeks and it is strictly for food. Most people I have seen while working at the super market are only on welfare because its free money. Rarely have I witnessed, who actually deserved/needed it. And instead of buying proper foods to last them for the 2 weeks, they usually blow it on high end shit. Basically saying \"Fuck what my kids need to eat, mommas got some shrimp!\". I will note as a statistic I have noticed, it's 99% black people who do this 1% white. There is a large amount of mexican/puerto rican welfare users, but they always seem to do it the way it is supposed to go, and I am proud to have my taxes support them since they are responsible with it. \n\nStory:\n*I'm chillin in an isle talking to a friend who still works there and is aware of my shenanigans, when an angry black lady with 3 kids hobbles over with a full cart and a carton of ciggs in her hand*\n\nHer: Why ain't dees cigarettes ringing up on my food stamps????\n\nMe: Because they are not food\n\nHer: But I want them\n\nMe: Then buy them.\n\nHer: Can't you see I'm on welfare? I ain't got no money!\n\nMe: Then you should drop the habbit.\n\n*I shit you not she said the over quoted black lady line*\n\nHer: Who da fuq is you? You gonna tell me how to spen my money?\n\nMe: It's not your money ma'am. I pay taxes so you can walk in here every week or two and blow 300 dollars on your shrimp and unhealthy high priced foods. Even though you have 3 kids and SHOULD be buying food that is cheaper and lasts longer and more healthy for them. Did you need the fruit loops brand? NOPE! Theres a big generic brand for half the price with twice the amount right next to it. Do you NEED 4 punds of shrimp, a 12 piece thigh bucket from the deli, and mac and cheese? NOPE! But you keep spending your undeserved welfare check and acting like I OWE YOU ANYTHING. \n\nShe flipped shit! Talked jibberish, then started yelling that she is going to sure the company because of me and all that. Too bad the company is already bankrupt, most likely going out of business in a year anyway. AND I DONT WORK THERE.... Fucks givin, -1.\n\nThe story about that Friday is pretty short. Another black lady though. I hate that this is a trend. Trust me white people are jsut as bad, but they usually stick to day time shopping. I'm usually there around midnight trollin. \n\nSetup: Black lady keeps walking by the grapes and taking handfulls and eating them. 1 or 2 is usually ok and we don't care but she swooped by 4 times to grab handfulls. She was also eating cherries and putting the seeds that were in her mouth.... BACK INTO THE CHEERY BASKET. This has ALWAYS pissed me off while i worked there. ALWAYS! The only thing that ever pissed me off more was when it was fresh corn season and i would restock the corn that would be gone in minutes. As I would open the crates, greedy fat fucks would try to pry it open while I was opening it si they could get to the corn. It's like \"HOLD THE FUCK ON IM GOING TO DUMP IT IN THIS BIN IT TAKES 2 SECONDS CALM THE FUCK DOWN IT'S CORN!!!!\n\nHer: These grapes rang up for tree fiddy nine. They sposed to be tree fiddy six. \n\nMe: Whatever. Its 3 cents. \n\nHer: Well I want them free because it's an inconvenience.\n\nMe: I really wan't to give them to you for free. It's just. I don't really want to..... I lied..... Also the Big yellow sign says $3.59. BIG..... And Yellow.\n\nHer:I didn't see that sign. Plus these grapes is nasty anyway.\n\nMe: Is that why you walked by 4 times and ate handfulls? \n\nHer: I was juss tastin\n\n*I reach my hand into the open bag of potato wedges she has from the deli and grab some.*\n\nHer: Um What is you doin?\n\nMe: Juss taystin.\n\nAND I WALK THE FUCK AWAY!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334044546", "subreddit": "TalesFromRetail", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Well, let's run the numbers. I live in NJ, and I'll take a hypothetical trip from my house to my buddy, who lives in Boston. I'll leave on Friday, April 27th and return Monday, April 30th. A nice 4-day weekend, plenty of time to see a Redsox game and drunkenly tour the Sam Adams brewery. I will assume that there are no delays, and I will try to keep the surrounding circumstances the same and accurate for both air and train travel.\n\nUsing Kayak, I see that a flight from Newark to Logan will run me $164 plus taxes and takes 80 minutes each way. Sounds pretty good.\n\nOn Amtrak's site, roundtrip Acela tickets for the same days, from Newark Penn Station to Boston South Street, are $208 plus tax. Travel time is 4 hours, 10 minutes one way.\n\nOf course, we have to factor in additional travel time, as I do not live at the airport or the train station. Since I can take commuter rail to either location, I'll do that. For Newark Penn Station, it will take me a maximum of 40 minutes and cost about $8. So our train total is now 4 hours, 50 minutes and $112 (this is the one-way cost).\n\nIt takes me 65 minutes to get to the airport terminal, and costs $13. Our plane trip now takes 2 hours, 25 minutes and costs $95. Still only half that of the train.\n\nWhen I take the train, I only need to switch tracks to get to the Acela, which takes 2 minutes at Newark Penn Station. But let's say I also need to pick up my tickets at the Amtrak kiosk, so I'll give myself 20 minutes to do all that once I arrive in Newark. So now we're up to an even 5 hours, 10 minutes from leaving my house to arriving in the center of Boston.\n\nNow, I'm the cautious type, so I'll leave myself a reasonable amount of time to check in at the airport. Since I'm only going for a weekend, I'm not checking any luggage, which should save me some time. But I still have to check in, get fingerblasted by security(weirder still because I'm a dude) and get to my gate. Since I'm not a seasoned air traveler, I'm going to leave myself at least 90 minutes to do all this. Maybe I could do it in less, but the last thing I need to is miss my flight because of extended TSA fingerblasting. So now we're up to 3 hours and 55 minutes to arrive in Boston via air.\n\nOf course, now we have to get from to, you know, someplace in Boston you'd actually want to be. Let's say I'm meeting my buddy at Faneuil Hall, which is right in the heart of the city. From South Station I just take a walk to get there. Google Maps says it takes 14 minutes. So, the train will cost me $112 and 5 hours, 24 minutes, door to door, one way.\n\nNow, from Logan, I need to get to Faneuil Hall. Apparently there's a shuttle that connects the terminal with the T, and then I take the Blue Line to Bowdoin and walk to Faneuil Hall. Of course, I have to first get to the shuttle from the gate. Since I don't have checked luggage, I can just scoot on out of there. I'll say it takes me 15 minutes to reach the shuttle, and then it will take me another 27 to get to Faneuil Hall. Total cost? About tree fiddy. No, really! So, we now have a total travel time of 4 hours, 37 minutes, door to door, and a total cost of $98.50 one way.\n\nSo in my scenario, when things are running correctly, air travel to Boston would be save me about 15 bucks and about 45 minutes of time each way. I could probably shave this about even on time (say, if I left from New York Penn Station, as most Amtrak trains have a 15-20 minute stopover there). Also, I may be underestimating how quickly I can get out of Logan, as I've never been there. \n\nAnd, of course, I'm assuming that I hit all connections correctly. The train trip has a single connection: between New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. The plane trip has five: NJT to NJT, NJT to Newark Airport Monorail, Monorail to Plane, Plane to Shuttle, Shuttle to T. Lot more chances for missed connections and extra time.\n\nSo the train is in fact more expensive and takes a fair amount longer, assuming everything is working at its optimum. If you were to eliminate some of the connections needed in the plane trip by taking taxis, you'd probably get there much quicker, but for a much higher cost.\n\ntl;dr - Plane is fairly faster and slightly cheaper than a train, when everything is working as it should.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334156228", "subreddit": "funny", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The title Laird of Glencairn would only apply to the owner of the entire estate, if it exists, not to those buying square-foot portions of it.\"\n\n-\n&gt;The sale of invented titles has caused such concern to one real lord - Richard, 7th Earl of Bradford, a restaurateur and food writer - that he set up a website, faketitles.com, to list them.\n\n-\n&gt;A spokesperson said: “The Keeper of the Registers of Scotland cannot accept applications for registration in the land register for land not sufficiently described to allow it to be identified on the Ordnance Survey Map.”\n\n-\n&gt;Peter Bevis, the man behind the Glencoe and Lochaber titles has also been censured for dubious practices elsewhere, basically creating sites to charge for something that the Government provides for free, see an article in the Daily Mirror’s blog, about his Telephone Preference Register, which costs you £9.99 and passes itself off as being the official site.\n\n-\n&gt;First, in order for sale of land to be legitimate in Scotland it has to be recorded in the Scottish Land Register, the keeper of which, in accordance with [Section 4b of the Registration of Land \\(Scotland\\) Act (1979)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/33/section/4) will not record  “a piece of land ……… of inconsiderable size or no practical utility” Thus, the plots of land they supposedly sell remain the legal property of the vendor as no transfer of real rights has taken place.\n&gt;\nSecond, there can only be one Laird (Lady) of an estate.\n&gt;\nFourth, they tell their purchasers that they will be exclusively entitled to use a coat of arms and a special tartan.

{"body": "I have an intense fear of dark water, and that about sent me over the edge. As a thank / fuck you:\n\nJet-black water washes over me like sin and I think of snakes, enormous mamushi pit vipers, engulfing me. I wait for them to coil about my limbs and face; to wrap, knot, and bind me to the lake floor. I imagine their long, powerful muscles, their slick, cold skin, the probing sting of fangs followed by the nauseously warm swell of poison. \n\nI expect to die. I expect the darkness to consume me.\n\nI wait, but nothing happens. In the senseless and silent cold my lungs begin to burn and I swim to the surface.\n\nBouji is standing in the boat, looking down at me, her forehead bunched in delicate creases.\n\n“Do you want to swim?” I ask as I tread water next to the small rowboat. It’s covered with chipped olive-green paint, silver shimmering through like scales.\n\nBouji frowns and shakes her head. When she was four I let her watch a movie called “Attack of the Leviathan,” wherein several people have their legs bitten off by an ancient sea creature that eventually destroys most of Tokyo. \n\nI should have known better than to let her watch the stupid Godzilla knock-off. This was three years ago when we all lived in Sendai, before I moved us back to Forsythe, in a small beach house. When Otohime had come home to find her daughter terrified beyond panic, she had been furious. She shouted and threw things at me, asking if I realized that the ocean was Bouji’s favorite place? She and Bouji loved the water; they were always swimming in the dark water and dancing on the beach. \n\nI smile at Bouji. “It’s okay, see? I’m in here. I won’t let anything eat your little toes,” but she shakes her head again, her exotic, dark eyes holding mine. She is hypnotic. She is so strange here, in this rural setting, so foreign to everything around her. I think of apple blossoms floating on the Mississippi. \n\nI sympathize with her fear of dark water. As a little boy, I had been obsessed with the Loch Ness Monster. My father owned a boat on Lake Travis and my older brother and I would take day trips to go sailing with him. He had encouraged us to go swimming whenever he dropped anchor but I always refused. Looking into the black, unfathomably deep water my child-brain imagined a colossal mouth of teeth and tongues waiting beneath the surface. My brother had tormented me about my fear.\n\nI grip the side of the boat to give me legs a rest, careful not to tip it too far toward myself. Bouji’s eyes flash unsure and she shuffles a step away from me. \n\n“It’s okay, sweetheart. Come here,” I make small come-hither motions with my right hand, “you’ll see there’s nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nShe shakes her head violently now, long black hair whipping back and forth around her face and neck. Her pale, porcelain skin flashes between the shadowy strands.\n\nI think of milk spilling onto rich soil.\n\nShe takes another step away from me and sits on the lip of the opposite side of the boat. I resist the urge to give the small, sudden push that would send her overboard. \n\nI look up to the sky with a frown. The day is overcast. Grey on grey clouds rule the heavens, and there is no blue or gold in the celestial dome. It would be better if there were sun. If there had been sun it would have seemed more like spring than fall; birds would have been singing and the wind flying across the water would have been a relief rather than a chill. But the sun is not shining and the day is silent and cool. It makes everything feel sinister and ethereal. \n\nI look to the lakeshore from where we had launched the small boat, our station wagon parked next to the remote road. There are beautiful pines all around the lake, a forest of jade and wood fortifying it from the rest of the world. I try not to look behind the station wagon, but my eyes betray me. I see the ruffles of a dark skirt leading to painfully contorted, porcelain doll legs. Somewhere inside I hear Otohime’s furious voice, never frightened or diminutive, without the delicate restraint I came to expect in Japan.\n\nI remember a black and white photograph I had seen in a library book about sea serpents. It had been of a woman who had been swimming in Loch Ness and lost her leg from mid-thigh down. \n\nBouji looks at me from under her bangs, delicately perched on the boat’s thin lip. I sink below the surface and swim under the boat, coming up on the other side directly behind her. I let my head slip quietly out of the water, so slowly, until I can breathe through my nose, while leaving my chin and lower lip in the water. Her small bottom hangs over the edge of the boat.  Her head doesn’t move and she doesn’t stand up.\n \n\nShe is unconcerned about me.\n\nShe is ignoring me.\n\nShe is her mother’s daughter. \n\nI think of my father’s boat again. I think of the darkness beneath Lake Travis. I think of my brother swimming in the lake. \n\nMy father had been below deck and my brother had jumped into the lake, taunting and at the same time begging me to swim with him. I had stood on the bow, looking down at him in the water, his head sunk deep in one of the oversized life preservers our father made us wear. He looked like a desperate turtle, and, feeling brave, I had jumped over the side. \n\nAs I tread water more strongly with my legs, I reach out of the darkness up to Bouji. Her one-piece bathing suit is blue with many thin, white stripes, and there is a decorative bow on the small of her back. I feel goose bumps spread over my arm as the wind whips across the lake. It’s strange how it becomes warmer to be in the cold murk of the lake than it is to be out of it, wet and shivering under all those dark clouds. They loom like disapproving gods. I gently grab the bow and tug, shouting “Bouji!”\n\nShe screams and tries to jump to her feet, but I still have her by the bow. She turns her head to look at me then fiercely jerks her entire body. The bow rips off in my hand and she falls in the bottom of the boat. I can’t see her but I hear her cry.\n\nI swim to the side of the boat and grab its lip. As I pull myself over the side I nearly tip the boat over. Bouji is sitting down, her legs drawn to her chest, arms crossed over her shins and her face buried in her knees. \n\nI move the oar I had used to row us out behind me and  get down on both knees in front of her, saying “Baby, baby, I’m sorry, baby. I didn’t mean to scare you. I was trying to be funny, Bouji.” \n\nShe raises her face from her knees, and through her hair I see Otohime’s face, tears rolling down her cheeks. Blood flows from her cracked temple and is running down the side of her face, mixing with her tears. Her mouth opens and I hear the choked cough of a wretched, soul-deep pain that robs her of her words. \n\n“Oh, God, oh, I’m sorry. I can’t undo it. None of it matters, none of it matters at all.” I say, shaking my head. \n\nShe looks up at me uncomprehendingly. Her hair parts slightly and I see Bouji’s face is now her own again, yet somehow this is worse. Her innocence reflects the darkness of the day and I know she will forever more be a baby girl. \n\nI take her up in my arms and I feel her shiver from the chill of my skin. At first her body is limp, but then she begins to cling to me, sobbing and shaking. She needs me again; she needs me to hold her.\n\nI think about swimming to my brother in Lake Travis using my erratic dog paddle, the collar of the ill-fitting life preserver choking me. He’s laughing and motioning for me to come further out to him. I remember his face, smiling and friendly, then suddenly changing. His eyes widened and his mouth contorted. He began to scream at me to swim, swim away as fast as I could because the monster was underneath us! It was going to eat us! \n\nI had felt uncontrollable panic seize me and I had screamed the screams of children separated from their mothers, abandoned, left cold in the dark. I had screamed in fear of unimaginable pain and death. I had screamed and thrashed in the water until my father was in the lake too, his huge arm around me, pulling me to his sailboat. \n\nLater, after both my brother and I were both back on the boat, after I had been calmed, dried, and swaddled lovingly in towels, my father sent me below deck. After a few moments, I had heard my father talking to my brother in a terrible voice. I hated the voice because I remembered it from when he and my mother were still married. I hated the voice, but as I heard it now I liked it. Then I heard a loud slap and I liked that too. Then I had heard my brother crying and I liked that most of all.\n\nBouji is still crying into my chest, my right hand cradling her head. I’m rocking her slowly and humming so she can feel the vibrations of my chest. \n\n“We have to go swimming now, baby. I don’t want you to be afraid because daddy’s with you, okay?” \n\nI pull her head away from my chest and look down into her face. Her eyes so dark they reflect my face and the sky above me like black mirrors. They don’t understand but they don’t care. I see trust in her eyes. I gather her up in my arms, cradling her tender figure, and stand up. I feel her cling to me tightly as I allow myself to fall backwards over the side of the boat.\n\nAt first we don’t sink into the water, but as I let all the air out of my lungs my weight begins to drag the two of us down. As we plummet deeper and deeper, sinking into oblivion, I feel her struggle slightly, tiny arms flex and relax and tiny legs kick and twist. I think of the first time I met Otohime. She had been swimming in the ocean and had asked if I would swim with her, but I had refused and explained that dark water frightened me. She had laughed in the slight and superior way Japanese women have, covering her mouth.\n\nWhen I at last feel Bouji relax completely I let her go. As she sinks away from me to the lake bottom I again think of snakes, of Loch Ness, and of being eaten by something so ancient and so much greater than myself. \n\nEdit: **TL;DR: I gave him about $3.50**\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334509864", "subreddit": "WTF", "score": 10, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I hate telling this story, as it usually brings back memories of that painful day, but what the hell I'll tell it anyway.  \n\nAbout 5 years ago I was able to go to Costa Rica with a couple of friends.  We stayed at a pretty nice hotel in the mountainous part of the country, which is pretty much just a gigantic rainforest.  Rainforests have tons of bugs, obviously, but for the first couple of days none of us had any problems other that the occasional mosquito bite.  One friend was even bitten by a leech, but even that was not enough to upset anyone too much.\n\nWe chose to go for a nice hike one day; normally a good choice for Costa Rica, but we left far too late in the day, around 3 o' clock.  We took a path suggested by the hotel concierge and set off.  After being gone for only 2 hours, the sun was starting to set, and the jungle was becoming more and more ominous.\n\nThe dimming sunlight danced off of the swaying plants and formed creeping shadows throughout the jungle.  The jungle was getting darker and darker, and our formerly jovial mood quickly became much more subdued.  We weren't thinking about the hike anymore; all we wanted to do was get back to the hotel.\n\nI was focused on the path ahead of me, ignoring the jungle.  We were about a mile and a half from the hotel, and every single one of us was focused only on walking faster.  I heard a slight rustling in the bushes to my left.  I quickly glanced over, praying that it was only the wind.  \n\nAll I saw were the dim tree trunks and moving leaves.  I continued walking, but stayed focused on the slightly swaying plants.  That is when I fell.\n\nThe fall was not painful, just surprising.  I was in a trance-like state before it happened, and the fall woke me up.  I saw the jungle with surprising clarity from the ground; the trees were sharper, the shadows deeper.  My eyes slowly drifted towards the ground, and that is when I saw it.\n\nThis was no ordinary spider facing me; it looked like a goddamn rodent.  It must have been at least 8 inches wide, with hairy legs and a fat torso.  I froze.  This... thing was less than a foot from my face.  It was staring at me with its beady black eyes, and I could tell that it wanted nothing more than to bite me.   I stared right back at it, immobile.  \n\n*\"So this is how I die,\"* I thought to myself. \n\nIt stared at me for a moment longer, then said, \"I need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nThat was when I realized that it was a 8 story tall crustacean from the Mesozoic era.

{"body": "&gt; In my opinion, believing that no god or deity exists is almost as silly as believing that they do exist. Both cases lack tangible evidence. Is it because those atheists are actually agnostic but do not know the differences? It's quite ironic, actually, to think that atheists, who disregard religions due to lack of evidence, hold a stance that has no evidence or proof.\n\nDo you think Santa Claus doesn't exist? How about aliens abducting people? The loch ness monster? Not believing in it is not the same as saying it's impossible.\n\nBut anyways, it comes down to how people define themselves. I'm pretty sure many self-proclaimed atheists would fall under your definition of agnostic. Some define themselves through their beliefs, or lack thereof, since those who are theists or religious do, instead of (what they know) through knowledge like agnostics do.\n\nI personally call myself an agnostic atheist, but the label of agnostic or atheist describes me well. There are more atheists because more people define themselves through lack of belief instead of lack of knowledge.\n\nWhy would people do that? Lets' refer back to Santa Claus. Many people would say they don't believe in Santa Claus, and there is no issue because most people accept that. Similarly for aliens or the loch ness monster. Atheists extend this to deities, as there is no evidence for one.\n\nIf you're saying one cannot be 100% certain, then you're disingenuous unless you also are agnostic about every proposition not proven false, and pushing a strawman since nobody ever could say they know something with 100% certainty that is based on evidence and not logical proof.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1334716784", "subreddit": "agnostic", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Some years back I worked as a carpenter in a small rural shop making furniture and made something very similar but it was a bust. (No big market for such a self-enclosed system) We ended up having to close shop but I guess we we're just ahead of the curve. Being a small shop and all we never thought to do patents and the like, mostly because the owner was a real old timer and didn't bother with such things.\nRecently I got wind of this entertainment system and realized it was based on one of my designs, one of the few I independently patented. I contact IKEA but they refuse to acknowledge this even though I have  proof of the patent and upon inspection many of the main features are the same. How they got hold of the design is not known to me but it would have been easy for someone to have gotten a hold of one of the sets we sold off for face value when we closed.\nCurrently I'm seeking legal counseling to look into my options on how to handle the situation but I'm nervous about the price to myself since I hear things like this get drawn out by the larger party to drain the legal finance of the smaller one.

{"body": "&gt;Okay I'm not sure I fully understand this. What answer would an atheist give to the question, \"Do Gods of any form exist?\"\n\n[The following are my personal definitions of atheism, used by many people I know and many redditors ~90% that I have met.]\n\nAn atheist wouldn't answer it. There is an implicit \"know\" that is in the question that nobody ever writes. You're question is actually \"Do you **know** if gods of any form exist?\".\n\nAn atheist means someone who has no **belief** in god. Not just someone who **knows** god doesn't exist. That's an extra part.\n\nThat's the wrong question to ask essentially. If you asked me that, I would tell you I don't know if a god exists, but I hold no belief that one does.\n\nAtheism/Theism- Belief (of god(s))\n\nAgnostic(/Gnostic)- Knowledge (of god(s))\n\n&gt;Dawkin's-Atheist (DA) for distinctness, DA's parallel a religion in a lot of ways, they hold beliefs on religion which they have conducted absolutely no research in to and may run counter to many psychological theories, they congregate around one man whom they believe to hold more answers than themselves and rarely question even when he is making absurd and unsubstantiated claims, they usually do this whilst making use of the logical fallacy of appealing to authority, namely Dawkin's.\n\nFirst, I want to see some evidence of this. But anyways this is a small subset of atheists. I would criticize them for using logical fallacies as much as I would any person.\n\nSecondly, you generalized initially, but now you're backtracking and saying just \"these\" types of atheists. I know there are atheists (or even people of every group) who hold differing beliefs. But that's not what you said initially and it was **way** too broad and harsh of a statement.\n\n&gt;I think this is mostly answered above but also I consider belief in this manner to be detrimental too. We really can't and shouldn't say in either way, simply that it is neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nBut that's true of anything. If you are talking about 100% knowledge, then you can't confirm or deny if I actually exist. You can't confirm or deny if there is actually a sun. You can't confirm or deny if you actually existed before the moment you are reading this. And then knowledge is almost meaningless to talk about in everyday conversation.\n\nIf what you mean by knowledge is the colloquial definition of knowledge, then the loch ness monster, santa claus, lack of aliens abducting people, and even god should qualify as the same level of knowledge. But I would still say I do not know, even if there is no evidence to support it's existence.\n\n&gt;He preaches intolerance to religion, there are quotes above and in the documentary he has done for the bbc.\n\nDoes he preach intolerance to all religion? Religion is, at its face, a system in which people with common beliefs congregate and share these beliefs. Religion tends to breed people who do not wish to discuss their beliefs, rather relying on faith instead of reasoning or what most people would qualify as evidence for most other things. Religion can tend to be a way away from using reason and logic, and if so I would be against religion which do that also.\n\n&gt;Yeah, I wouldn't use holy without qualifying the statement with the word I used above (in another post) that is that he is isomorphic to a religion and not explicitly a religion in himself (obviously I didn't capitalise himself either).\n\nYou could say the same thing about politics or sports though. Are they isomorphic to religions? The similarities is that they have a prominent figure talking about a subject, with many people supporting what they say, and some following all of what they say. That's the same in a lot more things than religion and it's kind of disingenuous for you to claim that it's religious when it's no different than let's say being a fan of a sports team, or being a democrat or republican, unless you also call those  isomorphic to religion.\n\n&gt;Finally, isn't \"lack of a belief in god(s)\" and \"not believing in a god\" a contradiction?\n\nHuh?\n\nNo. I tend to define things as dichotomous to create two, distinct and complete, categories. Like defining everything as either red or not red. Pick something: is it red? If yes, then it's *red*. If no then it's *not red*. This leaves no room for third options.\n\nSimilarly, I create two categories for belief. Having a belief in a god (theism/deism) and not having a belief in god (atheism). If you do not have that belief, then you lack that belief in god, meaning that they are synonymous. You either have a belief, or you lack it.\n\nAgnosticism to me is more about knowledge, not belief. So if you asked me if I know if god exists or do not exist, I would reply no. By most people's definition, that would make me an agnostic. However, I also hold no belief that that do exist, which by my definition would make me an atheist; i.e an agnostic atheist (or atheistic agnostic)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335192370", "subreddit": "agnosticism", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The short answer: I don't give a fuck.\n\nThe long answer: While religious nuts bother me to no end, I just don't give a fuck what they think.  Atheists seem too interested in proving people wrong and feeling smug about it, which really seems no better than the religions they are so very against.\n\nIf I were to describe people all using the word religious, there would be the religious, the non-religious (agnostics), and the anti-religious (atheists).  Watching the argument \"prove god exists\" or \"prove he doesn't\" just seems like a giant waste of time to me.  Neither can be proven, so why take the time to bother arguing about it?  It's like watching people argue over which comic book hero would win in a fight or literally ANY other hypothetical situation.  It just doesn't.  Fucking.  Matter.  More so, if there's one way I know atheists have described arguing with a religious person, it's like playing chess with a pigeon who doesn't know the rules and just kicks over the pieces.  So why bother trying to play the pigeon in the first place?\n\nFurthermore, of the religious and atheist people I have met in my life, all of them have seemed perfectly sensible and the conversation of religion never comes up in my life.  Well damn close to never anyway.  So anyone to talk to about it, it really becomes a topic I can only think about / argue with myself, and I just don't see the want or need to waste my mind and free time thinking about such things.\n\nSo in conclusion, yes I am agnostic about Russell's teapot, the Invisible Pink Unicorn, and the magic of fairy tales.  But the Loch Ness monster is definitely real, and I expect you to believe the same.\n\nI'm sure a great deal like this has seemed like a rant that you probably won't read, but I thank you for the open minded question.  Religious nuts might be annoying, but being harassed by tons of atheists on the internet for not choosing a side is equally annoying so again, thank you for being open minded.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1335341987", "subreddit": "agnosticism", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Perhaps you don't know why He had to choose this path. God is so righteous that because of just a speck of sin in unacceptable. The only way out was a stainless blood sacrifice and only God deem fit to be that sacrifice. \n\nThis is the only sort of universe he could create? A universe wherein the vast majority of his top species spends eternity in the lake of fire and \"only a few\" (Matthew 7:13-14) enjoy eternal life? A universe where someday Jesus is going to have to come back and kill all of the non-Christians?\n\n&gt;Now, if from now till the end of time, to reject the gospel because of pride and prejudice and not because you've proven it to be untrue would be the ultimate sin.\n\nBigfoot, Chupacabra, the Loch Ness Monster and the Resurrection are among the phenomenon that need to be proven true. I do not need to prove these things untrue. And what kind of an idiot would disbelieve what they perceive as the truth?\n\n&gt;But I have yet to see your reason for not making the choice other than a lot of biased thoughts and a weak attempt to quote without context. \n\nI have not made the choice of Christianity for the same reason you have not made the choice of every other religion on earth.\n\n&gt;Again i reiterate in case you've chosen to ignore that we as Christians, rely not on the physical building, rituals or even Pastors for our Hope. WE draw Hope and Strength from our Lord, Jesus Christ. \n\nCorrect. It's a kingdom of the spirit. It is not a kingdom of the letter. This kingdom of the spirit has been all around us since the beginning of time (Romans 1:19-20); long before the appearance of preachers, religions, scriptures churches or messiahs.\n\n&gt;Prayer, fellowship and worship are means for us to grow closer to God, to build a relationship. \n\nBy rubbing the lamp we grow closer to the genie.\n\n&gt;No, prayer is us communicating with our Lord, to praise and thank him, to request, to intercede, not us \"renewing\" out source of motivation and strength.\n\nSo, \"God give me strength\" is not a valid prayer.\n\n&gt;Human nature, throughout the entire History as we've seen is self-centered, \n\nWhich is exactly why Christians choose Jesus. They want eternal life. They want to avoid hell. It's a cynical punishment-reward system feeding on our worst impulses.\n\n&gt;sinful and perverse especially in this day and age. \n\nHuman nature has not changed for thousands of years. And we are not just selfish. We are also capable of love and altruism....even without a an imaginary divine sword hanging over our heads.\n\n&gt;So I'm not talking about the better part of our own natures, cause we mankind was responsible for crucifying our own Boss.\n\nWe were doing his will. It was the single act that saved a few humans. The best thing that could possibly happen. The only good thing that could possibly happen.\n\n&gt;well, the door is always open for you. Christ is always knocking at the door of your heart of hearts.\n\nPerhaps he is known by other names?\n\n&gt;You want to base your motivation on money? on a living being, an idol perhaps? \n\nYou mean like a man who lived 2,000 years ago?\n\n&gt;Or give me an example that beats anchoring in God?\n\nGod is not a thing in this world. A man who lived 2,000 years ago, religions and books are things.\n\n&gt;The human spirit is not God's spirit and God's spirit is not Satan's spirit. I do not know how you've derived this.\n\nWe are made in God's image. Religion is the image of us, the good and the bad, the sacred and the profane.\n\n&gt;In our conversation, we've always stuck to quoting scriptures or scientific facts or perhaps well-known atheists/anti-theists arguments that are widely approved. Please do not conjure up your own thoughts and make it fact to keep this argument sane and meaningful.\n\n\"Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?\" (1 Cor 3:16)\n\n&gt;You are right, Jesus IS the word for THE truth we all will experience, eventually. Have you?\n\nJesus IS ~~the~~ *a* word for THE truth we all will experience, eventually. \n\nEveryone experiences the truth.

Back to religion, countless people have also claimed to see apparitions from other religions, (such as the prophet Mohamed) but I'm sure that you don't accept these accounts either.\n\nThe final thing to think about is another Christian symbol that has apparently appeared before many people, Jesus.

He was middle eastern, and would have had dark skin and shaggy dark hair. The same can be said for Mary. Why is it that the apparitions always seemingly appear as Anglo Saxons?

{"body": "[A closer look at the games](http://i.imgur.com/jtkLg.jpg) (warning for the OCD-afflicted - more like Mr. Don't!, amirite?)\n\nI was out and about, innocently thrifting on a Thursday afternoon when I decided to hit up a store I hadn't been to in a few months. I noticed a stack of games on the shelf behind the counter situated on top of what appeared to be a ColecoVision. Upon further inspection, it was a neat stack of 27 ColecoVision games in a neat little shelf plus some controllers with a ColecoVision console all for $149.95. I took some pictures to examine at my own leisure since I wasn't prepared right there to drop two hundo less of tree fiddy on the lot. Plus, I know this particular thrift store has 50% off sales every Saturday on every tag in the store, save a particular color. I decided to press my luck and return on Saturday in the hopes that the ColecoVision lot was still there.\n\nWell, as you've probably guessed by now, the console and games were all still there upon my return Saturday morning - although the games were deftly turned around by someone who I assumed didn't want others to notice. I gladly shelled out the $75 and went on my merry way. The console works great, as ColecoVisions can often be fickle beasts. Hell, I already have a ColecoVision and it works like absolute garbage when it actually decides to work. The third party controller - the Suncom Joy Sensor - is a funky little controller that features a touch pad and rapid fire. The two white controllers included with the ColecoVision work amazingly.\n\nThe belle of the ball here, if you will, is that copy of Sega's Up'n Down. That game is rather rare and the [only copy I can find](http://www.ebay.com/itm/UpNDown-COLECOVISION-GAME-System-COLECO-UP-DOWN-N-adam-not-4-atari-/180862812029?pt=Video_Games_Games&amp;hash=item2a1c437f7d#ht_895wt_1398) is $49 shipped. Overall, I was pleased to get everything for $75. I now have an extra ColecoVision console and 8 dupes to sell in the hopes of making this haul an even better deal.\n\ntl;dr ColecoVision and games for $75.

{"body": "That's because we're responding to your claim, not making a claim of our own.\n\nWhat you'll find is that only a small number of atheists will claim \"I know there is no god.\" Those atheists have the burden of proof. \n\nMost of us, on the other hand, are simply saying \"I don't believe that there is a god.\" In that sense, most of us are technically agnostic atheists. We don't make any claims about any gods, we just reject the claims we're presented with, usually for lack of evidence.\n\nThink of it like a criminal trial. In the US, the rule is 'innocent until proven guilty'. When you accuse someone of a crime, you're making the claim that they are guilty. Since you made the claim, it is up to you to provide evidence. It's not up to the defendant to prove that they are innocent, and the jury doesn't decide 'guilty or innocent' -- they decide 'guilty or not guilty'. \n\nYou claim there is a god (guilty). We say \"okay, let's see the evidence.\" You have none. We say \"Alright, then I don't believe your claim that god exists\" (not guilty).\n\nAgain, we're not claiming that there is no god (that would be like declaring the defendant innocent). We simply haven't been convinced that there is one.\n\nWhat you need to understand is that atheism is the default position. Think of a newborn baby. Does the baby know about god? No. Does the baby believe in god? No. This doesn't change until you *present the idea* of a god to the child. At that point, it is the child's decision to believe your claim or not, and it's up to you to prove your claim.\n\nIf all you have to go on is \"you can't prove that god doesn't exist, therefore he must exist\" then let's apply that to everything else that we can't prove the nonexistence of:\n\nfairies\n\nunicorns\n\nleprechauns\n\nSanta Claus\n\nthe Loch Ness monster\n\nBigfoot\n\nThe Abominable Snowman\n\nSpongebob Squarepants\n\nthe list goes on. So must all these things exist since we can't prove their nonexistence? No, we don't believe in them because there isn't any evidence to support their existence. We don't have to prove that they don't exist in order to not believe in them.\n\nSo if all the above doesn't clarify our position, I'm not sure what more I can say.

{"body": "I said \"I believe your religion is full of shit.\"\n\nI did *not* say \"I believe religious people are full of shit.\" However, I will say that religious (and other supernatural, nonreligious) *concepts* are full of shit. Just as I think the idea of getting 72 virgins after a suicide death is bullshit, I think the idea of original sin is bullshit, and I think the idea of an afterlife is bullshit. Many religious people *aren't* full of shit, and many atheists *are*. So let's not confuse the message with the messenger. The religious person might not be full of shit - but his religion sure is.\n\nWith that out of the way, I will answer your question. I believe what I believe because it makes sense in the context of reality. Occam's Razor really applies here: what is the purpose of a contrivance such as \"God\", when all of the phenomena such a concept *used* to be used to describe are now described in physical terms? I define myself based on my beliefs, not others. Others tell me that I need to be saved from my sin, or that I am going to hell, or that I'm cursed - but my belief has nothing to do with these ridiculous claims. My faith is in the ability of men to reason, not the ability of some ubiquitous \"higher power\" to do some unspecified \"miracles\". Reason has brought definitive, reliable results. Faith hasn't. That is where my belief stems from - reality.\n\n&gt; You can't believe something doesn't exist\n\nLeprechauns, unicorns, two-headed elephants, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti, Thor, orange crows, a planet between Mars and Earth, a fifth fundamental force and God comprise some of the more interesting members of the list of things that I believe do not exist. The list happens to contain exactly the same items as the list of things that I don't believe in the existence of. Guess what - those are *one and the same list* - because \"something I believe doesn't exist\" is the same as \"something I don't believe exists\". I don't believe X exists: therefore, I believe X does not exist. Fill in the blank with any item from the list.\n\nSorry if I'm being a total jackass. I'm in a shit mood today and feel like grumping about on the Internet.
