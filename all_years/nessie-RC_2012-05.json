{"body": "&gt;I believe the idea of God does not represent reality - i.e. I believe God is not real.\n\nTo me, \"God is not real\" is a fantasy. I believe the idea that God is not real does not represent reality - i.e. I believe God is real. There's nothing either of us can do about that because what we believe has no effect on reality. God does not exist simply because I believe he does, and just because you believe he there is no God doesn't make him not exist. Neither of us are controlling reality with our beliefs.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get you to see is that belief is a quantity that defines us as humans. You cannot believe in something that has neither quantity nor idea of quantity like the idea of non-existence. Believing in non-existence means there was no belief in the first place.\n\nYou cannot say you believe Leprechauns, unicorns, two-headed elephants, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti, Thor, orange crows, a planet between Mars and Earth, a fifth fundamental force and God do not exist because that still means you have a belief that defines you that depends on something that doesn't exist. Therefore you are without definition, which clearly isn't true because you obviously exist. That is why believing something does not exist and having a lack of belief in that something are not the same thing.

The only options presented are that humans either gained knowledge or had an innate knowledge of the afterlife. This is called a false dilemma (or false dichotomy) as there are a number of options for the burial of dead outside of these two choices.\n\nAs I mentioned before, it could have been an innate response to remove the terrible smell. It could have been done so not to attract scavengers or to preserve the people's remains from scavengers as an act of reverence. It also could have been done because bodies tend to take up a great deal of space when lying around on top of the soil or that other domesticated animals refused to eat within the vicinity of the dead.\n\n    permalink\n    save\n    source\n    report\n    reply\n\n[–]marnie50\n1 point 1 minute ago (1|0)\n\nAlso my understanding is that humans started burying people more often as they became less nomadic.

There are factions among atheists, including Gnostic, Agnostic, Strong, Weak, Anti-theist, Skeptical, Apathetic, et al., but the general premise is the same: We reject theist claims, especially in the absence of evidence.  \n\n3) It is true that a gnostic claim that no gods exist is equally logically perilous as a gnostic claim that any gods exist; most atheists, however, make *no such claim.*  If I were ever provided with actual evidence for the existence of a deity, I would change my mind. *I would change my mind.* This is not a belief based on faith. It is a rational and skeptical worldview/heuristic.\n\n4) The default position in the absence of evidence is to withhold belief until evidence has been provided. If you fail to believe in Big Foot or Nessie or fairies, it is probably because you have seen no evidence that they exist. Does it take you as much faith to disbelieve in fairies as it would take to believe? \"Faith\" is the reason people give for holding a belief for which they have no good reasons to believe. \n\n5) Going to reiterate because it's important: Don't be a dick.

{"body": "&gt;There are factions among atheists...but the general premise is the same: We reject theist claims, especially in the absence of evidence.\n\nReally? Because I thought what all atheists had in common is that they believe there is no god. Or they have disbelief in god's existence. By definition. [My sources](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheism)\n\n\n&gt;It is true that a gnostic claim that no gods exist is equally logically perilous as a gnostic claim that any gods exist; most atheists, however, make no such claim. \n\nI believe you are misusing a language. What is a gnostic claim? Please, I have a dictionary and I think think I need to fix your statement:\n\n\"It is true that a *atheist* claim that no gods exist is equally logically perilous as a *theist* claim that any gods exist\"\n\nNow the statement makes sense.\n\nAnd most atheists make no such claim? Look at the definition of atheism, Shroud. Atheism definitely makes such a claim.\n\n&gt;If I were ever provided with actual evidence for the existence of a deity, I would change my mind. I would change my mind. This is not a belief based on faith. It is a rational and skeptical worldview/heuristic.\n\nWell honestly, Shroud, this sound a lot like something an agnostic person would believe. You know, somebody who is not committed to existence or nonexistence of a god.[Here are my sources](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic)\n\n&gt;If you fail to believe in Big Foot or Nessie or fairies, it is probably because you have seen no evidence that they exist.\n\nBut I do not fail to believe in big foot or nessie or fairies, I just lack belief in them. I am agnostic about them. I can not know if they are real or not, because I have no evidence.\n\n&gt;Does it take you as much faith to disbelieve in fairies as it would take to believe?\n\nI don't know, probably. I mean there is no evidence either way, so both beliefs would probably require an equal amount of \"faith\".\n\n&gt;\"Faith\" is the reason people give for holding a belief for which they have no good reasons to believe. \n\nSounds like slander against what \"faith\" really is. Faith is a belief (or disbelief) in something unsupported by facts. Look this one up yourself. It is not an excuse for a dumb believer (or disbeliever).\n\n&gt;Going to reiterate because it's important: Don't be a dick. \n\nOk. I am not really being a dick by disagreeing with a popular opinion, am I? I simply hold an alternative perspective and am making a statement about this image using it. I see redditors posting screen shots of this type of behavior on this subreddit all the time, to high praises. I guess I can thank you for not really being a dick at all yourself though.

{"body": "Oh, so your argument is \"don't pin your atheism on not believing in Christianity\". Well, duh.\n\nI don't think that *was* your argument, though. At least that's not how you presented it throughout this thread: you seemed expressly to be criticizing the focus of many atheists on the Old Testament, going so far as to compare not reading the Bible through contemporary Biblical scholarship with judging physics on the basis of one shitty advocate. I think it's fair to say that reads as an entirely different argument than the one you're now making.\n\nMoreover, it seems to be based on a straw man notion of the typical atheist. I hardly think you can justly derive the origins of people's atheism from the fact that people in predominantly Judeo-Christian cultures focus their criticism primarily on Judeo-Christian beliefs. That's just the discourse community we're in; those are just the arguments that emerge around the pressing questions of how we decide public freedoms and moral authority. \n\nYou're also especially in straw man territory if you take a gander at how many atheists lean on a fetishistic, westernized version of Buddhism for their sense of moral virtue, and how /r/atheism deals with other god-based religious communities when they get mentioned. I think there's plenty of reason to assume that atheists are *not* just aware of Christianity, though I think it's equally reasonable to assume that Christianity's the discourse they're most likely to confront day-by-day. Short version: Just because we talk more about certain religions doesn't mean we haven't evaluated others.\n\nThat said, your last statement feels a little bizarre; here's a comparison to explain why. Say you grow up in a household that believes in fairies, and you discover when you're an adult that there's just no compelling evidence for belief in fairies. Sure, one might say it's important to keep your mind open to the possible existence of elves or orcs or unicorns or the Loch Ness monster--but what's necessarily changed on the back of your first realization is the standard by which you measure all new claims. Recognizing that the existence of fairies is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence, you would now likeliest expect no less than extraordinary evidence for the existence of all these other creatures, too. That's not the same as not being open-minded. ([Here's a great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T69TOuqaqXI) further to that point.)\n\nSimply put, until such a time as such extraordinary evidence presents itself for any of these other fantastical creatures, what's the point of spending too much time on the hypothetical case that any of them exist, when there are plenty of demonstrably existent (and often equally if not even cooler) creatures to learn about instead?", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336346994", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;I don't think that was your argument, though. At least that's not how you presented it throughout this thread: you seemed expressly to be criticizing the focus of many atheists on the Old Testament, going so far as to compare not reading the Bible through contemporary Biblical scholarship with judging physics on the basis of one shitty advocate. I think it's fair to say that reads as an entirely different argument than the one you're now making.\n\nI think I was making both arguments personally. This subthread was specifically about taking the Bible literally, hence my focus on the subject.\n\n&gt;Moreover, it seems to be based on a straw man notion of the typical atheist. I hardly think you can justly derive the origins of people's atheism from the fact that people in predominantly Judeo-Christian cultures focus their criticism primarily on Judeo-Christian beliefs. That's just the discourse community we're in; those are just the arguments that emerge around the pressing questions of how we decide public freedoms and moral authority. \n\nActually I'm annoyed because people mostly attack Christian beliefs (I'm not going to consent to Jeudo-Christian because the two religions don't share much other than the physical text of the old testament which they both interpret in different ways), and not just Christian, but the most extreme and basic version of Christian beliefs, usually due to bad experiences with said basic Christians and then once they are done with that, they don't even try and find a better understanding (which by all means is their right, not everyone feels the need to pursue spiritual ambitions) or remain open to the topic at all (which I think is a shame as it closes off certain avenues of thought). \n\n&gt;You're also especially in straw man territory if you take a gander at how many atheists lean on a fetishistic, westernized version of Buddhism for their sense of moral virtue, and how /r/atheism deals with other god-based religious communities when they get mentioned. I think there's plenty of reason to assume that atheists are not just aware of Christianity, though I think it's equally reasonable to assume that Christianity's the discourse they're most likely to confront day-by-day. Short version: Just because we talk more about certain religions doesn't mean we haven't evaluated others.\n\nFair enough, though I honestly don't think that is true for the majority of atheists that post here (in regards the short version). Well other than Muslims are bad and even crazier than Christians ofc. Though I'll admit I could just be getting suckered by the dozens of LOL GUYS LOOK HOW DUMB THIS CHRISTIAN ON FACEBOOK IS posts that hit the front page from r/atheism every day.\n\n&gt; That said, your last statement feels a little bizarre; here's a comparison to explain why. Say you grow up in a household that believes in fairies, and you discover when you're an adult that there's just no compelling evidence for belief in fairies. Sure, one might say it's important to keep your mind open to the possible existence of elves or orcs or unicorns or the Loch Ness monster--but what's necessarily changed on the back of your first realization is the standard by which you measure all new claims. Recognizing that the existence of fairies is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence, you would now likeliest expect no less than extraordinary evidence for the existence of all these other creatures, too. That's not the same as not being open-minded. \n\nFor sure, as long as you didn't close yourself off to the the possibility of such things, nor disclude the possibility of such things from your thought process in cases where it could be conceivable. I think it is clear a lot of atheists do disclude themselves from even considering the possibility of certain subjects purely because they are turned off by the concept of the Christian god and christian cosmology. I have to say living in a secular country I didn't have that impression of Atheists until I saw how rampantly militant r/atheism is.\n\n&gt;Simply put, until such a time as such extraordinary evidence presents itself for any of these other fantastical creatures, what's the point of spending too much time on the hypothetical case that any of them exist, when there are plenty of demonstrably existent (and often equally if not even cooler) creatures to learn about instead?\n\nWhy can't you do both? Many scientists love the fantasy and science-fiction genres, it helps feed their minds in a way the provides elasticity of thought which then can (especially in the case of science fiction) lead them onto paths they may have otherwise not considered (not saying that is always true of course, merely that it does happen). Teleporters don't exist, but there are definately people who have made it their mission in life to try and make them exist due to childhood infation with the concept which they gained through fiction based entertainment (some of which where also teaching lessons in the form of social commentary, etc.). \n\nBefore you say what's that got to do with the Bible, they know Science Fiction isn't real, I go back to the point the Bible is about imparting allogorical knowledge, providing the same elasticity of thought through multi-layered storytelling, it is just that the Bible also contains some literal sections which were designed to provide structure for a certain way of life (leviticus for example). The same is true for many other religious scriptures.\n\nNo I'm not trying to claim that the Bible doesn't expect you to believe that God exists, it does of course. However it is not a history book, nor is it my personal belief (based on what I've learnt from orthodox Jewish teachings) that it was ever intended to be such (at least in terms of the old testament - which again was not written down until many hundreds of years into the Jewish religion, which would make it an incredibly unreliable and heavily propaganidized history book even by the most generous standards).", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336361748", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I don't understand how making your own sandwich can be described as feminine.  Listen, back when I was a cartoonishly evil ivory hunter my buddy Kurtz and I would make sandwiches like true men.  We would head out into the jungle armed only with our machetes and our wits.  We would come out with the corpses of all sorts of now (thanks to us exerting our manhood all over the jungle) extinct critters like Dodo birds or Aurochs or Sea Minks or Martians.  \n\nThen we'd take them into town where we knew this great guy named Kevin - really nice, never asked too many questions - who would let us use his big ol' meat cleaver and slow cooker.  You all are probably too young to have had Dodo jerky, but my oh my what a taste; there really isn't a single critter still in existence that tastes as good - maybe Bigfoot, maybe.\n\nAnywhoo Kurtz and I had very different opinions about what we should do with the jerky we had made ourselves.  Kurtz had these ridiculous notions of going into business and becoming rich and famous.  He started making connections and selling his cut for a massive profit.  Personally, I am a man of very simple needs.  I would take my cut and make sandwich after sandwich dripping with raw masculinity and slathered in rich, juicy testosterone which honestly is a pretty disgusting metaphor but I wrote it down so I can't un-write it.\n\nKurtz's hubris would eventually be our undoing however.  After Kevin's livestock started going extinct (and Kurtz started offering some very special merchandise to his customers) he started asking questions and making some telegraph calls.  The next time we wandered into town with the Loch Ness Monster in tow, we were greeted by an entire Roman Legion.\n\n\"Hang on,\" Kurtz said, \"when the hell does this story take place?  None of the anything is even consistent!  Geez o' peez I just used my smartphone to look up Aurochs on wikipedia because I thought you just made that up and I found out they went extinct in the 17th century.\"\n\n\"Yeah what gives?\"  Asked Genghis Khan, wandering in with his wife Princess Diana.  Then Kurtz died for reasons related to literary symbolism.  Being incredibly genre savvy, I sensed that a musical number was about to break out any second so I burst into song. \n\n*\"O' TANNENBAUM!\"*\n\nThis upset Genghis Khan and he killed me with his laser rifle.  The lesson you should take away from this is that Genghis Khan in this story is a metaphor for greed and that greed kills.  However, greed is still pretty badass because it's Genghis Khan.

There was still plenty of places to sit but oh no this boy just had to sit in front of us and if he wasn't the tallest son of a bitch you ever saw. Me and the lady decided to move to the next seat over but when we did so did he. We moved again and still he followed us being sure to sit right in front of me! The third time we moved, we got up and actually went across the theater but by god if that lil cracka didn't try to follow us. I stopped the boy and said, \"Why do you keep following us boy, can't you see we just want to watch the movie?! What do you want?\" The boy got a real serious look on his face, leaned down towards me and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" And it was about that time I realized this boy was about 7 stories tall and covered in scales! I said, \"God Damnit monster! I ain't given you no tree fiddy!\" I grabbed my wife's arm and we rushed out of that god forsaken theater as fast as possible!

I never really stopped to think about what I was doing until one day after school. I had been held back taking a test and when I left the halls were completely empty. As I was walking towards the door I heard a faint whimpering sound coming from the bathroom. I ventured in to investigate and found the boy sitting in one of the stalls balling his eyes out. My heart broke right then and there. We started talking and he poured his soul out to me. I felt like a monster after having listened to him but I would soon see who the real monster was when I asked him, \"Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\" The boy look at me with tear filled eyes and said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" And it was about that time I realized this was no boy but a 70 foot tall creature from the Paleolithic Era!

{"body": "It had been raining for the last three days, but the ground was already dry from the rays of the sun. I had been waiting for my best friend Kenny to get to my house; as soon as he got there we both got in to our bathing suits and ran down my road. Haft way down my road we cut through my friends woods, hopped a fence and start to walk down another road. That’s when we heard it.\n\n \n\nWe both heard the sound of rushing water. Then we ran into the forest at the end of the street, jumping from rock to rock until we came to a 30 foot drop off into rushing water. The river was like someone had opened up a flood gate and thousands of gallons of water tinted brown from the hundreds of pounds of mud were flooding over a 45 degree angle slamming into one spot at the end of the waterfall creating a ball of pure rushing water. Kenny and I was like oh my god, and then we both climbed down to a flat rock at the edge of the river 40 feet from the rushing waterfall. I took off my sandals and walk on to another rock in the water, it like was putting my legs in 3 feet of liquid ice. But I walk to the edge of the rock and the current got 10 times strong. I leaped into the rushing water and tried to swim up stream but was forced back to a rock that I call nessies back; I call it that because it looks like a back of a big monster. I looked up and saw my other friend Eric who was laughing so hard because I was stuck on the rock. I got up and jumped to another rock then started climbing up a steep slop on the other side were my friends were. I got to this rock we call level 2, we call it that because it the 2 lowest rock.\n\nThe rocks go level 1 which is 5 feet above the water, level 2 which is 10 feet above, level 3 which is 40 feet above the water and level 4 which is 35 feet above the water but there 10 feet of rock and trees you have to jump over . I jump and landed in the water and swam with all my might back to my friends and then ran up to level 3. I was scared but then I ran and leaped and slammed into the water, it was so much fun. After a while I got this idea, I swam up to the water fall from the left side which the current was weak got up on the bottom of it, and jump strait into the spot were all the water was going to. I was shot out of it at like 30 miles per hour it was so cool. I did that a couple of more time then I walk back up to the top of the waterfall and try to cross it but something bad happen. I forgot about the hole in which the current was 2 time it strength and I lost my footing and started to drift of the edge. I was yelling Eric over and over but when he turned around I was already over the edge I was flying down it I saw a rock and try to grab it but I slammed into it and kept going I was going over so many rock my butt hurt so bad then at the end of the waterfall I slammed into the rock at the end. I swam over to my friends over all I was fine I only had one cut on my leg and my butt hurt a lot.\n\nAfter that day I was a lot more couscous about what I do. I did go back in after and had fun but I didn’t jump anymore and stayed away from the falls. I have a scar on my leg from that day. I will never forget that day.\n\n\nTL;DR i fell down a waterfall", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1336841962", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Observations: the universe is a really, really (really) big place that's *almost* beyond our ability to conceive of.\n1.

Experiments: satellites, radio telescopes, advances in physics (quantum and otherwise) are lending more and more credence to our existing theories and building greater and greater obstacles to a \"jealous old all-powerful guy breathed life into some marionettes for his own entertainment\" hypothesis.

{"body": "&gt;But there is a very distinct and very important difference between \n&gt;\"decreases the likelihood of\" and \"absolutely proves\". \n\nAbsence of proof is indeed not proof of absence, but god claims don't involve \"may\" or \"possibly\". \"A god is something that created the universe\", \"a god answers prayers\", etc. are specific and absolute claims, unlike \"a god exists who may or may not be all-powerful or created humans\". If my hypothesis is \"this sample contains human white blood cells\", I attempt DNA sequencing and there's no DNA detected (and human white blood cells contain DNA) then wouldn't any scientist reject the hypothesis via negative evidence (lack of DNA which is required for their to be white blood cells in the sample)? It's no different than testing a claim about god: the claim involves a necessity (the Christian God answers prayers, the Mormons claim Native Americans decended from Jews, etc.) and fails the hypothesis test so its claim is rejected like any other truth claim. Out stumbling block is I don't see where you're explaining why it's not special pleading to exempt a god-claim.\n\n\nPhysicist Victor Stenger wrote in God: The Failed Hypothesis: \"The process I will follow is the scientific method of hypoth-\nesis testing. The existence of a God will be taken as a scientific\nhypothesis and the consequences of that hypothesis searched for\nin objective observations of the world around us. Various models\nwill be assumed in which God has specific attributes that can be\ntested empirically. That is, if a God with such attributes exists, cer-\ntain phenomena should be observable. Any failure to pass a spe-\ncific test will be regarded as a failure of that particular model. Fur-\nthermore, if the actual observations are as expected in the absence\nof the specified deity, then this can be taken as an additional\nmark against his existence.\nWhere a failure occurs, the argument may be made that a\nhidden God still may exist. While this is a logically correct state-\nment, history and common experience provide many examples\nwhere, ultimately, absence of evidence became evidence of\nabsence. Generally speaking, when we have no evidence or other\nreason for believing in some entity, then we can be pretty sure that\nentity does not exist. We have no evidence for Bigfoot, the Abom-\ninable Snowman, and the Loch Ness Monster, so we do not believe\nthey exist. If we have no evidence or other reason for believing in\nGod, then we can be pretty sure that God does not exist.\"\n\n&gt;Yes, and we haven't found anything that disproves design. We have \n&gt;found incredibly strong evidence for evolution - but this does not in \n&gt;and of itself disprove design.\n\nThis is where I get frustrated again... it's like you have a need to say \"..but 99.999999999999% doesn't mean it's certain!\" :-) Yes we DO have evidence against design. 99% of all species known to have existed are extinct. As Hitchens used to say \"Some design\". We see flawed and inefficient adaptations. We see evolution having evolved the quickest/simplest solution, not the best. Our own eyes invert images such that they need to be turned rightside up again before we \"see\" them... that's evidence of non-design. We see all of the failed adaptations in the fossil record... etc., etc. Of course, we see that scientists successfully presented evidence in court to cause a ruling that \"intelligent design\" isn't even a science. You know at least as well as I that examining the fossil record does not demonstrate any evidence of design but does indicate random mutation and natural selection. \n\n&gt;You're wandering off topic, and the resulting argument isn't relevant.\n\nNo, I'm trying to explain to you how scientists can - and have - tested for the existence of god, something you keep maintaining can't be done... even as people are doing it today. \n\n\n&gt;Suppose that I wrote a book about President Obama and in that book \n&gt;I stated that he would answer letters sent to him. I'd then have you \n&gt;observe as I write a letter to him. When I get no letter in response, \n&gt;you would answer me by saying President Obama doesn't exist?\n\nI'd conclude that a President Obama who answered letters did not exist... although in this case we're not dealing with an \"omnipotent\" deity so there are other possible factors in this experiment that would need to be accounted for (postal service performance, for instance). But if absolutely no letters came from this man who you claimed does answer letters then yes, on the basis of no evidence for and evidence against, a President Obama who writes letters needs to be rejected (just as I'd reject a Santa Claus who answers letters if he never answered mine). If one could not reject the hypothesis, what's the point of the test in the first place? \n\n&gt;I already do not believe in God, and 2) because you will never \n&gt;succeed. \n\nI don't need to; scientists far more impressive than me already have done the work. \nhttp://www.amazon.com/God-Failed-Hypothesis-Science-ebook/dp/B003N6568Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337551073&amp;sr=8-1\n\nHeck, the Christian Jesus promises that anything asked in his name will be granted several times in the Bible. One doesn't need to be a scientist to test and reject that. I remember hearing that in church around the age of eight and thinking I'd hit the lottery :-) and wondered why none of the adults had ever realized what I just had. Needless to say, I got my brother to agree with and pray for the things I wanted - from the line about where two or three are gathered in my name - and was quite disappointed when it wasn't like Christmas the next morning. My mother explained  \"it doesn't work that way\", but no one could explain to me why it said that in the Bible if it didn't work that way. I dropped it, but even at that age I realized faith claims could be put to the test. :-)\n\n&gt;There's no functional way of giving absolute proof of God's \n&gt;non-existence, because there is no functional way of describing God \n&gt;in scientifically viable terms.\n\nBut people do it all the time - god is all-powerful, god is everywhere, god is all-loving... \n\n&gt;Using clever rhetoric doesn't win an argument for you, but it makes \n&gt;you run the risk of appearing smug and douche-like. Bayes was a \n&gt;mathematician, not an astrophysicist. It might also interest you to \n&gt;know that Bayes was religious.\n\nAnd Bayes' theorem mandates that absence of evidence equals evidence of absence, which was the original point of all of this. Whatever Bayes was doesn't change the math. \n\n&gt;You are either trying to argue by evoking emotions, or you know very \n&gt;little about science. Whatever the case may be, I've spent enough \n&gt;time trying to explain scientific principles to someone who is only \n&gt;interested in stubbornly arguing for the sake of arguing, using \n&gt;sarcasm and veiled condescension as means of power.\n\nIt's my belief I'm arguing the default position... a failure to find observations predicted by a hypothesis mandates rejection of the hypothesis. The faith claims of the world's major religions, from \"souls\" to creationism to a young earth to the power of prayer have been tested and each found to fail consistently. This, combined with the positive evidence against a creator/intercessor God - Earth holds no significant place in a vast universe, evidence of evolution, natural processes shown to be behind all phenomena so far, etc. is sufficient to state that we can know there is no Abrahamic God to the greatest degree we can be confident about anything. You are free to believe \"maybe all the evidence is wrong\", but there's no scientific or statistical reason to do so.\n\nRegardless - good day to you. May Feynman's grace be upon you so that you may one day learn more about the essence of the scientific method.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337551902", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; If I may be personal here for a second. I believe that even walking away may not be bad, or it may be necessary (hard to explain this precisely).\n\nIf you care about truth, it is *essential.*  There isn't another way out of the cultural and societal reinforcement, the extreme confirmation bias, and the carrot and stick \"if you don't believe this, or lead others away from it, you could doom this infinite immortal soul that we promise you definitely have.\"  My fear of leading others down this road stopped me from admitting my atheism for a long time, because I knew there was a chance I was wrong (there is always a chance) and I didn't feel it was fair to risk others' souls on that chance.  Ah, Pascal.\n\n&gt; My aunt was the same way and she simply couldn't find the evidence. For around 20 years she would say that the evidence wasn't there. After 20 years we got a call and she had come back.\n\nCertainly if you believe God is real, you have to believe that is what would happen if you walked away and still sought truth.  It's certainly what I thought would happen.  It did not turn out that way, and I now think Christianity is not just lacking in evidence, but positively unlikely to be true.\n\nI can't say what I think of your mother's journey without knowing her reasons for returning (it sounds like lack of evidence was her reason for leaving?).  You don't have to tell me, just saying I can't evaluate without that information.  People abandon and pick up beliefs for terrible reasons all the time.\n\n&gt; If I may, again, be overly Christian here. I'm reminded of the story of Job and how he spends so much time arguing with his idiotic friends while God is not showing up. His wife berates him and tells him to curse God and die and still God doesn't show. Something greater was in store.\n\nAn interesting take on Job.  I'll have to reread it sometime with that interpretation in mind.\n\n&gt; I'm sorry if I'm being picky. But what does 20% evidence for a theology look like? What does 50% look like?\n\nIt's fuzzy, and I'm giving numbers to try to give a relative point of view.  The numbers don't matter, it's more the feeling for how much you have and how much you should expect.  But I can say I have more than 99% confidence that the sun will shine on this side of the earth tomorrow.  I have much less than 20% confidence that there is a Loch Ness Monster.  I have more evidence that quantum theory is true, but a lot of that evidence is indirect, so my confidence is higher than 20 and less than 80.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1337751047", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Case example: The Apple Kid and the Orange Kid.\n* Lots of obstacles that block your path are incredibly strange and obscure, and include: giant pencils, giant erasers, and gridlocked traffic\n* There is an entire dungeon area where the biggest baddies' claim to fame is being the 3rd strongest of five brothers.\n* There is a huge luxury condo you can buy in your hometown for $40,000. Once you can buy it, it's missing an entire wall, and there's a book inside one of the shelves with an incredibly weird story.\n* Monkeys can fly by blowing huge bubbles with chewing gum, and get the attention of the Loch Ness monster.\n* The entire magic system is based off of Psycho-Kinetic energy.\n* One of the most sacred locations in the game is hidden inside a metropolis' sewer and guarded by a giant rat.\n* One of the status ailments is homesickness. The only way you can cure it is by calling your mother.\n* The only way you can save is by calling your dad. You never see him physically, but you know he's there.\n* You do not earn money when you defeat enemies. Instead, your dad deposits money into your bank account. (Yes, he's a Japanese Salaryman)\n* One of your greatest enemies is [your fucking nextdoor neighbor](/spoiler)\n* The strong warrior who travels through time to tell you about your mystical powers and destiny can pummel all the foes at the beginning of the game, no sweat. But he's defeated after getting hit with a newspaper. *Buzz Buzz*\n* There is an entire club in one town where patrons stare at a rock.

Please don't murder me :/\n\n---------------------------\n\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash were arm wrestling on a tree stump, symbolic of the conflict between the concept of ultimate volition and uncontrolled truth that exists on this Earth.\n\nRarity walked in, her stride as controlled the most delicate seamstress, her face covered in despair as it’s mouth said, “Twilight has horn rot!”\n\n“Again?” said Rainbow, who then rolled her eyes to represent the repetitiveness of the adventure.\n\n“Yes, again,” said Rarity, her repetition highlighting the repetitiveness of the adventure as the narrator  further amplified the repetitiveness by excessive description and repetition.\n\nAfter the narrator was done Rarity continued to debrief the pair, “Today’s cure for horn rot is the MacGuffin, an organ in the heart of the Loch Ness monster. You must acquire the MacGuffin through an extraordinarily long adventure in spite of the fact that we could probably just go to the hospital or use the cures we already have on hand.”\n\n“Ah sugarcube, Ah don’t think ‘at’s ah good idea,” said Applejack with an obnoxiously thick accent.\n\n“Of course it’s a good idea! My middle name is danger! Now lets get on those boats and go on a privateer adventure!” exclaimed Rainbow Dash.\n\n“I didn’t mention privateers?” asked Rarity rhetorically, to settle the reader’s rustled jimmies over the narrator’s disregard for causality by acknowledging their concern(all though if the reader is concerned by such flaws, they should probably skip to the next chapter).\n\nAfter a quick and unexplained scene change, the pair arrived on the deep ocean of uncertainty, on a ship that symbolized mankind’s search for knowledge in spite of the ever-expanding shore of unknowns.\n\nSuddenly, the narrator remembered that the prompt required the CMC and Zecora as pirates; and so suddenly a pirate ship appeared with the CMC, Pipsqueak and Zecora on board. A conveniently placed megaphone allowed Scootaloo to speak: “We want the MacGuffin! For too long we’ve waited for it’s delicious, lean Canadian bacon, drizzled with cheddar cheese and egg, all wrapped in a warm and toasty English muffin.”\n\nRainbow Dash had her own megaphone, an older, yet more advanced model than Scootaloo’s symbol of youth and she replied, “But we don’t even have the MacGuffin. And you guys are looking for the McMuffin©. McMuffin© is owned by and copyright of McDonalds®, trade mark of the McDonald’s corparation.”\n\nThe pirate boat suddenly disappeared, and the ship of knowledge suddenly found it’s way next to the Loch Ness monster, like how technology’s rapid advance can surprise and shock people. Rainbow Dash fought the monster and Applejack bucked it and then they got the MacGuffin.\n\nAfter a short and unmentioned return sequence, they are back home and they cure Twilight’s horn rot with the MacGuffin, followed by an emotionally satisfying epilogue and/or author’s note that answers all the reader’s questions, concerns and suppresses their urges to murder the author.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338079490", "subreddit": "MLPLounge", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

The pills come out from the right of the crosshair.\n\nDon't aim directly at targets, aim where they're going to be.\n\nIf you see a sentry gun, don't attack directly or from too close: put some stickies near it, from around a corner, and detonate them. 2-3 are enough.\n\nTo cover long distances, put a sticky on the floor, jump over it, crouch mid-air (opitional) and detonate it. You'll be sent flying and will lose some energy, but with this you can ambush enemies easily.\n\nYou can also be a Demoknight: a Demoman that uses primarly its shield (it replaces the Stickybomb Launcher) and a sword as meelee. Otherwise, don't use swords if you are going to stick with the launchers: use the bootle.\n\nThe Eyelander (and its reskin Nessie's Nine Iron) is the best sword. Second comes Half-Zatoichi, but remember, if you draw it, you will only be able to switch weapons if you kill someone.. Don't use the Persian Persuader unless you're a Demoknight using boots.\n\nThe Bootle is only made for killing enemies that are too close or have low health, or as last resort. This is valid for the Ullapool Caber: a handgrenade that you can't throw, but bash on the opponent, killing it instantly but giving a 100 health recoil on the demo.\n\nDon't stop reloading.\n\nIf you're going to die, detonate your stickies. Don't let them get wasted.\n\nPut stickies on places where people usually blindturn, or in front of the cart.\n\nYou can also make the stickies go further by holding down MOUSE1.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338228089", "subreddit": "tf2", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Joseph Birdsell believed that infanticide rates in prehistoric times were between 15% and 50% of the total number of births, while Laila Williamson estimated a lower rate ranging from 15% to 20%. Both anthropologists believed that these high rates of infanticide persisted until the development of agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution. Comparative anthropologists have calculated that 50% of female newborn babies were killed by their parents during the Paleolithic era. Decapitated skeletons of hominid children have been found with evidence of cannibalism.

Infants were offered to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. Pelasgians offered a sacrifice of every tenth child during difficult times. Syrians sacrificed children to Jupiter and Juno. Many remains of children have been found in Gezer excavations with signs of sacrifice. Child skeletons with the marks of sacrifice have been found also in Egypt dating 950-720 BCE. In Carthage \"[child] sacrifice in the ancient world reached its infamous zenith.\" Besides the Carthaginians, other Phoenicians, and the Canaanites, Moabites and Sepharvites offered their first-born as a sacrifice to their gods...\n\n&gt;...exposure of newborns was widely practiced in ancient Greece...The practice was prevalent in ancient Rome, as well...\n\n&gt;The Íslendingabók, a main source for the early history of Iceland, recounts that on the Conversion of Iceland to Christianity in 1000 it was provided - in order to make the transition more palatable to Pagans - that \"the old laws allowing exposure of newborn children will remain in force\"...\n\n&gt;Whereas theologians and clerics preached sparing their lives, newborn abandonment continued [in the Middle Ages] as registered in both the literature record and in legal documents. According to William L. Langer, exposure in the Middle Ages \"was practiced on gigantic scale with absolute impunity, noticed by writers with most frigid indifference\". At the end of the 12th century, notes Richard Trexler, Roman women threw their newborns into the Tiber river in daylight. Unlike other European regions, in the Middle Ages the German mother had the right to expose the newborn.

So you develop stronger telescopes and you look for planets with water, and atmosphere, and the right range of temperatures for life to exist. Then you can send a rover to gather samples and see for sure if there are aliens on that planet. The vast majority of outer space has not been explored, so the possibility is there.

Biblical texts are sources--but they must be used in an intellectually sound manner. When ancient mikvehs are dug up, things like the Torah are exactly what help us explain what they are. But if other parts seem to claim something for which there is absolutely no evidence of, then there's no academic reason to believe it, so it must be interpreted in a more literary and theological context.

{"body": "&gt;Now, suggesting that it would make sense to be attracted to 20, 25 and 30 year olds simply does not hold in a world where people rarely lived that long to begin with.\n\nLife expectancy in the upper paleolithic age once you made it to 15 years old was 54. They had very high infant and child mortality rates, but if you made it to being a teenager, you were pretty good to go. So really the reproductive age was about the same as ours.\n\nAnd 14 would still not be the age at which to successfully produce offspring. As I've already noted, girls who have only recently had menarche are far worse at giving birth to children than 20-35 year old women. They also aren't as fecund as older women (a high percentage of a woman's menstrual cycles for the first few years after menarche don't actually involve ovulation). But, here's some science backing me up:\n\n&gt;adolescent mothers [&lt;=19] had significantly lower weight gain in pregnancy and higher rates of low birth weight compared to the adult mothers\n\n[Maternal weight gain and pregnancy outcome in adolescent girls in Ibadan, Nigeria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22428513)\n\n&gt;Compared to women between the ages of 20-35, pregnant women under 20 are at a greater risk for death and disease including bleeding during pregnancy, toxemia, hemorrhage, prolonged and difficult labor, severe anemia, and disability.\n\n[Consequences of early childbearing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12264602)\n\n&gt;Adolescent growth in girls less than 16 years who have a child nearly stops, even if nutrition is good. Maternal mortality among adolescents is higher than it is among women aged 20-30. Maternal morbidity is also higher in girls aged 15-19. The main pregnancy complications are severe anemia, renal complications, eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, and labor complications (e.g., vesico-vaginal or recto-vaginal fistulas). They are most common in the youngest adolescents. Poor quality of prenatal care contributes greatly to poor pregnancy outcomes. Prematurity and low birth weight are also more common among adolescents than other age groups. The perinatal mortality rate of infants born to adolescent mothers is also greater: 104-120% greater in Sao Paulo, Brazil and 73% greater in India.\n\n[Adolescent pregnancy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12290181)\n\n&gt;The authors attribute the greater frequency of premature births among 9-16 year olds to immaturtity of uterine muscle fiber, deficient prenatal care, and the emotional tensions to which the adolescents were subjected, as well as to medical complications of pregnancy and general maternal physical immaturity.\n\n[Pregnancy in the adolescent. II. Comparative study between primigravida from 9 to 15, 16 and 17 years old](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12267372)\n\n&gt;Anthropologist Laila Williamson notes that \"Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations, including our own ancestors.

Here's a random thought, related, but not necessarily addressing your post specifically:\n\nAssume there is no objective meaning. Nothing means anything, unless *we* give meaning to it. So for example, an arrow **---&gt;** does not mean anything, until we assign the meaning \"points to whatever is to the left\" to that arrow. The meaning is extrinsic to the arrow, but not intrinsic to it. It's meaning could be said to be derivative, but not original.\n\nYour thoughts are about things.

And therefore, there *is* intrinsic meaning in at least some of the matter in the universe. That is, original meaning. Not derived like with the arrow.\n\nOr...\n\n* The meaning of those neurons, electrons, and dendrites are assigned by some mental sub process in your brain, in which case you have the same problem just popping up again (because you've just postulated another [little mind inside your mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument)), and you go to infinite regress and never actually explain the problem. \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338423523", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You have made an EXTREMELY fatal flaw with your logic.  Listen and listen closely: A person does NOT have to \"prove their is no god\" to be able to say the idea of one is silly and unfounded.  *It is the person who claims something to exist has the burden of proof on them...ALWAYS.  It isn't the other way around.*    If I come to you and say \"I can fly\" it is not you who now has to prove me wrong.  It is me who has to prove that I can.  Why do you not seem to understand this? It is a basic premise of logic.   You can't disprove a negative.  You couldn't disprove the loch ness monster or a flying pink unicorn either.  That doesn't' mean you should give any credence whatsoever to their existence.  \n\nYou have also mixed my words around and used them to say things I did not say.  I said *Christianity's tenets* (calling people stained with sin etc) were immoral, I did not say people like your friend were.  That is an important distinction and one that you did not give me credit for.  Do I thinkn it is insane that people believe in things like ghosts, demons and the like? Sure I do.  Rational people shouldn't believe such things without evidence.  Don't you think it would be insane for people to believe in Santa Claus as an adult?   Additionally you tell me I need not generalize, yet you didn't offer to reiterate the fact that I mentioned that religious faith can make people do wonderful things.  How can you tell me I need to mention this when I already have?  Did you not read closely enough?  \n\nYou also said: \n&gt; Christians don't cause gay kids to put guns in their mouths, bigots do. In this day and age, most Christians aren't trying to rationalize the Bible, they accept that the entirety of it isn't completely truthful or doesn't apply to modern times\n\nI must say, you sound rather misinformed on this topic.  How familiar are you with the large southern US protestant denominations like the Southern Baptists?  Just because many younger kids are figuring out the bible is full of nonsense doesn't mean the world isn't FILLED with biblical literalists.  Why don't you try asking Muslims which parts of the Quran they don't believe huh? \n\nNow, are you calling most Christians bigots then since Christianity is anti-gay? You said \"Christians don't cause gay kids to put guns in their mouths, bigots do.\"  I respectfully but forcefully disagree.  A church does not have to have a website like (godhatesfags.com) in order to shame gay kids and make them depressed enough to end their life.  Christians think the rather benign saying \"love the sinner, hate the sin\" is a NICE thing to say to gay people when in fact it is absolutely deadly to them at a vulnerable age.  You sound like you need some religious education before you go defending the foolishness it espouses.  \n\nWhat you SEEM to be saying is \"Hey!!  I don't care if it is true!!  People go to church to feel good and be a part of a community!  There is nothing wrong with that! My friends are Christians and they don't hate gay people!\"  Well, that may be true but it doesn't change the fact that Christianity is anti-gay and anti-human at its core.  You can rationalize the bible away all you want but you must understand how silly it looks for you to sit here and say the things you've said in an attempt to sweep it all away.\n\nThe fact is faith CAN motivate people to good things as I mentioned before (though you didn't seem to notice!)  It doesn't mean the beliefs are true or that they should be given any respect just because some people find comfort in them.  Additionally, when the religion is based on the very notion that humans are scum and unworthy of redemption, I think more than a little criticism is in order.  By saying \"Basic belief is sacred and personal shouldn't be fought against\" (I'm paraphrasing your statement to me), you are saying that there are ideas above critique.  By that logic, Osama Bin Laden's very personal and very heartfelt beliefs about the supernatural are also above critique.  I know you don't realize it, but that is the logical leap you have made by reacting so defensively.
