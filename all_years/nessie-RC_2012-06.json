{"body": "&gt; I know electrons are described via quantum mechanics. But they are matter, and behave as waves when not observed. Would it then be reasonable to assume, if no observation could be made, there is no solid matter. The question this opens up, is what brought about existence? Also, why exactly does our observation matter to an electron? Perhaps you know more about the subject, and could answer my questions.\n\nPhysicists are not agreed on how to \"interpret\" the results of quantum mechanics in terms of metaphysics. Wikipedia says:\n\n&gt; An interpretation of quantum mechanics is a set of statements which attempt to explain how quantum mechanics informs our understanding of nature. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and thorough experimental testing, many of these experiments are open to different interpretations. There exist a number of contending schools of thought, differing over whether quantum mechanics can be understood to be deterministic, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered \"real\", and other matters.\n\n&gt; This question is of special interest to philosophers of physics, as physicists continue to show a strong interest in the subject. They usually consider an interpretation of quantum mechanics as an interpretation of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, specifying the physical meaning of the mathematical entities of the theory.\n\nAlso, N. David Mermin said: \n\n&gt; Fifteen years ago, I mused in a Reference Frame column on how different generations of physicists differed in the degree to which they thought that the interpretation of quantum mechanics remains a serious problem (Physics Today, April 1989, page 9). I declared myself to be among those who feel uncomfortable when asked to articulate what we really think about the quantum theory, adding that \"If I were forced to sum up in one sentence what the Copenhagen interpretation says to me, it would be \"Shut up and calculate!\"\n\nWhat most quantum physicists DO seem to agree upon is that you cannot project into their disagreement (i.e. their ignorance) any positive conclusion like \"Consciousness precedes matter\" or \"the world is just a projection of our minds\" or \"there are things that physicists do not understand therefore God exists\" etc.\n\n&gt; It was a strawman argument, and you'll forgive me, as it was my understanding (assumption?) that atheist completely deny possibility of god, of course that belief comes from the apparent idiot fest that is the r/atheism front page.\n\n/r/atheism's front page seldom deals with the question of whether there is \"a\" god at all. /r/atheism usually deals with the question of whether described human Gods (Yaweh, Jesus, Zeus, Krishna, Allah, ....) exist. These Gods are mostly laughable in their description (\"I am a jealous God...and also perfect\") and also self-contradictory (\"I am a perfectly merciful God and if you do not worship me then I'll burn you forever\") so we are fairly confident that they DO NOT exist.\n\nThe only \"theists\" who have come up with a God that seems remotely plausible are the deists. And even they have no evidence for their God.\n\nSo yeah, I'm pretty damn sure that Yaweh and Jesus do not exist. Same as fairies and loch ness monster. But in any case I'm open to evidence. I've just never been presented anything remotely plausible...\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338541858", "subreddit": "athiesm", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My original objection was to the statement \"Science is the path to atheism\", because it is not.  It is the path to understanding of the natural world.  How that fits with one's personal theological outlook will vary by the individual, but science does not entertain speculation about the metaphysical.  *Scientists* may, but *science* does not.\n\nSo I pointed out that there are individuals - like Francis Collins, and there are others as well, who simultaneously do good science *and* have personal convictions about the divine.  In point of fact, [the National Academy of Sciences](http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/Compatibility.html) notes that science and faith are entirely compatible.\n\nYou responded to me by arguing (it seemed to me) that the biological process of evolution somehow means that there's nothing special about Jesus.  It does not follow from the existence of evolution that Adam and Eve did not exist, and if it did, it does not follow from the allegorical nature of Adam and Eve that people (Francis Collins) could not still have faith, as evidenced by scholars and theologians who believe precisely that.\n\nNow we arrive at this claim:\n\n&gt;This mentality castrates the skeptical part of your mind. That's why it's so dangerous!\n\nAs if a certain theological position (belief in the divine without evidence) somehow necessitates that the believer must *also* believe in other things (Unicorns, Yeti, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot) without evidence or must, at the least, have fractured powers of reason.\n\nIt simply isn't so.  There are scientists who are methodological naturalists, capable of assuming the natural world is all there is for the purposes of their scientific investigation, who may then go home and in private have faith in metaphysical things without it interfering with their successful careers in science.\n\nAs of this writing Francis Collins has [173 publications](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Francis%20S.%20Collins%20%5Bau%5D) listed in PubMed.

{"body": "Right on the money. \n\n\nCirca 2000, FPSes were extremely similar, and almost exclusively copied from notable titles, which was a good thing, because that's how you develop a great game (by creating something original, copying successful features of others, and tweaking these two together to make something new). \n\n\nThe modern age of FPS is following that suit of evolving gameplay, most notable, the inclusion of loadouts, but also putting a huge emphasis on customization. For the sake of argument, let's say that all the possible loadout styles have been tested and balanced pre-release. What is the downside to this game mechanic? \n\n\nOne of the biggest issues I've seen from competitive players (specifically about Armor Abilties in Reach) is that you can't tell when someone has a specific AA, and it causes a randomness factor that often results in unfair deaths and kills. This is something I have come to agree with. If you are able to see the loadout of a player, you can come up with more strategies to counter them, rather then taking unnecessary chances (i.e. somebody has Armor Lock, you could toss grenades at them first to force them to lock up and not waste ammo/get too close and be punished for something you can't see).\n\n\nAs for loadouts including \"perks,\" ala Call of Duty, we still don't really know what Halo 4's \"perks\" are going to be like (though we know the one will enable you to equip two primary weapons in a loadout). I feel that if they continue like that, as in, not power-ups, but minor gameplay alterations (i.e. two primary weapons), then it could be a good thing.\n\n\nAs for competitive players, I agree that anything causing the game to be unbalanced and \"random\" should have an option to be removed. However, being Halo, I am sure there will be competitive-based playlists with those restrictions once the game has been out for awhile and any imbalance has been noted.\n\n\nThat's my, well, I'd say two cents, but that was more like tree fiddy.

On a scale of 1-10 she was definitely an 11 she was so damn hot.\n\nTo tell you the truth I went to Salt Lake to try to hook up with my ex again and maybe get back together, but once I saw this girl... Damn... she was amazing.  I forgot all about my feelings for my exgirlfriend and instead wanted this girl, so bad.  This girl, lets call her Cindy, was damn fine as I said already, perfect boobs, perfect butt, perfect everything.  The first thing that came to my mind was \"Damn, she's out of my league\" but I decided that MAYBE if I could get her drunk enough I could bang her.\n\nSo me, my ex, and Cindy go down to a bar and I try to get Cindy drunk and try to make conversation with her, one problem though, she has one drink and says she's done for the rest of the night, I guess I wasn't being very secretive of my plan so she puts her finger on my lips and says \"You don't need to get me drunk to fuck me sweetie\" and then she takes me and we go back to her apartment.  \n\nWe finally get to her apartment and I expect us to go in and talk a bit, but nope, Cindy is having none of that, the second we stop the car she jumps on me and starts kissing me, just plain kissing me and I can't believe my luck whatsoever, it was incredible.  \n\nThen she leads me inside and says \"Give me everything you got\" and I do.. boy did I... I lost my virginity that night and it was the greatest thing ever, no regrets, definitely the best night of my life, we did it in every position you can think of, it was amazing.\n\nA few hours later we're lying in bed and Cindy looks me in the eye, grins, and says \"I need something else\", I get really excited expecting a round two and I say \"What do you need?\" \nCindy replies \"I need about tree fiddy\"\nNow it was about this time I realized that Cindy was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era, that goddamn loch ness monster had tricked me again. \n\ntl;dr: Fuck Nessie", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1338789167", "subreddit": "pics", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The whole point of Herobrine is that it started as a joke, then turned into a meme/rumor, so people kept the joke going. It wasn't that he's really scary (he isn't) it's that everyone got into/kept feeding into the overly dramatic retelling of the rumor, to the point where the very thought of seeing herobrine felt 'scary'. It's like in Jaws, when everyone talks about the shark, you keep seeing the shark kill people but you never quite see the shark. By the time you actually DO see the shark, the fact that it's one of the fakest looking props in movie history doesn't matter one bit, You've already bought the ticket and are on the ride and you're too into the mood to let a silly thing like the shark being rubber with foam teeth kill the mood.\n\nHowever, that only works once in awhile. There's only so often you can willingly suspend your disbelief. At some point, watching it every day ends up causing you to lost that sense of suspense and allows you to see the shark for what it really is. A really fake looking mechanical prop. The only reason the movie is as good as it is is because the prop didn't work most of the time, which caused Spielberg to focus more on the characters and the editor to do some of the best editing in movies ever.\n\nHaving herobrine in the game would be pointless and would reduce the characters effectiveness. At some point, you'd figure out a way to defend yourself against them and they'd just end up being background noise. The character would lose everything about itself that made it such a big deal to people in the first place. People didn't really 'want' to see herobrine, they wanted to lose themselves in the mythos behind herobrine. It's like bigfoot, or nessie, or champ. The mystery and mythos and how it affects our imaginations is why their names are still talked about. When people found out that the bigfoot video had been faked, it deflated a lot of interest in it. People knew it was fake, they just didn't want to be able to convince themselves of it. \n\nIMO, minecraft was better off without an ending and is better off without a boss. what makes it special is that its like an open book with a randomly generated world setting where you get to author your own tale. How it ends should be up to you, not someone else. If you pay careful attention to the 'end' you'll see notch pretty much says as much...that's why you end up coming out the other side right back where you started.

It is certainly not something that is testable or disprovable at this point in time, yet there are endless cases or people who report such phenomenon.\n\nYep. And there's seemingly no reason why a ghost couldn't walk up to a scientist and say \"Hey, I'm dead. Let's find out how this shit works\" - but apparently, the dead are content to jingle hanging ornaments (in a manner indistinguishable from a light breeze) and to appear as out-of-focus dots in photos (which appear indistinguishable from dust on the lens).\n\nLoads of reports of spirits and suchlike, yes - and that's really interesting data. It indicates that lots of people think they see spirits. It tells us how cultural expectations feed into our ability to hunt for patterns in the data given us by our senses. It's a phenomena, alright. There's just fuck all evidence to suggest that the reports of these people are actually accurate.\n\nRegarding the second part of your comment:\n\nThe sentence you have quoted _follows immediately after_ a sentence explaining why this is the case: \"There is an infinite set of objects which do not exist, and a finite (though large) set of objects which may possibly exist.\" - the set of objects which do not exist are not bounded by any limits, whereas the set of objects which do exist are bounded by physical laws and the available number of unique particle combinations which could express such an object.\n\nFor further reason to assume non-existence, see [Null Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis).\n\nRemember, the point isn't to *conclude* non-existence, it is simply to *assume* non-existence until there is evidence warranting a change of assumptions. Scientific conclusions reflect the data, as closely as possible. We have evidence enough to assume that ghosts in general do not exist for the time being - as well as a lack of satisfactory evidence for individual reports, there is positive evidence for the assertion that such a thing is not possible, including the laws of conservation of mass-energy, biological evidence to indicate that the mind is indeed physically dependent on the brain, and so on.\n\nRegarding your loch ness monster claim, the bed of loch ness has been *thoroughly* imaged and nothing out of the ordinary was found, including fissures and caves in which creatures could be hiding. It could be that a creature exists in the lake who is able to evade every modern aquatic imaging technique, or it could be that the creature is not there.

{"body": "I had been going to school and working part time at a small family owned diner during Christmas time. The wages were modest, but enough to support my drinking habit when I wasn't slaving away at the books. Our customer base was mainly older couples that have been coming to the diner for years. I remember it was a winter day, snowing like a motherfucker (Pittsburgh winters are brutal) and a disheveled looking mother and her child came in from the snow and below zero temps. They sat at a booth along the windows on the same side of the booth, the look on their faces just radiated relief to be in a nice warm building.\n\nI approached them as I did all my customers, introduced myself and asked if they would like anything to drink. The mother looked at me with sadness and said water would be just fine. Being that it was fucking colder than a well diggers ass outside, ice water wouldn't be the most refreshing drink to have. I decided to bring them a glass of water as well a cup of hot chocolate and coffee. When I placed the cups on the table the mother was caught off guard and started to explain that she couldn't afford those drinks as well as food. I cut her off and explained that they are on the house. \n\nOur menu is fairly inexpensive, just diner food for the most part and the portion sizes are fairly large. After giving them some time to look over the menu and decide, the mother asked for the kid's grilled cheese and that was all. I informed her that the portion was very small in comparison to other dishes (I assumed she was just allowing her child to eat) and she said she couldn't afford anything else. My heart sank. This woman is using her only money to feed her child and willing to go hungry just so her son may eat.\n\nI spoke with the cook in the back and he said he can do something for her. He prepared a gigantic Meat Loaf supper, which came with Mashed potatoes, Gravy and coleslaw. The look on their faces when I brought all this food at to the table was priceless. The mother began tear up and thank me profusely. Being that I had other tables to manage as well, I checked back on them every so often, refilling their cocoa and coffee. They were laughing and eating, again just over joyed to be in the heat and warmth. After about a half an hour, they had cleaned their plates and were drinking up the last of their warm beverages. I asked them if there is anything else they need. The woman shook her head humbly no. I could tell this might be the only meal they eat before now and Christmas. I insisted, anything I could do to make their Holidays a bit better, I am willing to do. The little child finally spoke up for the first time since they had entered the diner. I will NEVER forget what he said, \"I'mma need about tree fiddy\". Well it was about that time that I noticed this﻿ little boy was about 8 stories tall and actually a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, \"Damnit.

Yellow's no good, either, on account that tuna can't see yellow.  It's true!!  Cappy told me.  So we was fishin' and drinkin', and this storm rears up outta the west.

Such a brave man.  So, this storm's a-comin', and we reel in all quick like.  But my lure snagged on somethin', and I was pullin' and reelin' and swearin' up somethin' fierce, but the dang thing won't budge!!  Finally, Cappy and Lumpy Jim...I'll have to tell you how ol' Lumpy got his name some time...come over and help reel in the biggest thing I ever did see come outta the water.

{"body": "About half way down the northern shore of Loch Ness is a small hamlet called Drumnadrochit, where you will find a fiberglass Nessie in a small pond off the side of the road.

{"body": "I presume that you are speaking of one of the many Veronicas or mandylions that are scattered throughout the Orthodox and Catholic traditions (generally, they were supposed to be the cloth that wiped the *sweat* from Jesus' face while he was carrying the cross, not his blood). To which I reply: so what? What about them? Not one of them has been scientifically analyzed, not one is available for laboratory scrutiny, and therefore any claims made about them are immediately suspect. \n\nI'm sure that Jesus, or someone whose name has come down to us as Jesus, actually existed, and I am equally sure that the best available evidence is historical record (e.g. Josephus). Bits of cloth and other relics are not evidence unless they are capable of standing up to rigorous scientific inquiry. Until such time as they are analyzed thusly, they prove nothing at all. A cloth with an image on it is not evidence of anything, except that such a cloth exists. \n\nAgain: use Occam's Razor. Is it more likely that the laws which govern matter and energy were suspended in order to make these pieces of cloth, and that, given apparent proof not only of the existence of Jesus but of his divine nature, that the church could or would *hide away* such evidence (that is, keep it from direct observation and analysis) for centuries, or is it more likely that they are hoaxes -- perhaps pious, devout hoaxes, intended to bring more souls to the church, but hoaxes nonetheless? Why would the church discourage investigation? Why don't they want this stuff proven, so they can proclaim their truth to the world? \n\nI'm sorry, but until I see solid, scientific proof of, say, the coronal effect that Shroud of Turin believers are so fond of, I reserve the right to consider such behavior highly suspect. If scientifically accurate evidence is presented to me of the proof of mandylions, Veronicas, the Turin Shroud, the Lanciano tissue, or indeed Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster, I will reverse my position on their veracity, because I will HAVE to do so. Such is the nature of scientific inquiry. I am not necessarily saying that all \"miracles\" are complete hoaxes. But until *real* proof is offered, they remain under the umbrella of faith, and faith, by definition, is not proof, no matter how strong it is. \n\nIf you choose to believe in the divine origin of such things, that is your right, just as it is my right to disbelieve them, until proven wrong. Your contention that \"no matter how much proof you have there are always skeptics\" is simply incorrect. There may always be contrarians, but a skeptic, a true, scientifically-minded skeptic, will accept a true, scientific proof -- in fact, he/she *must* accept it. Proof, by definition, is truth. In fact, it is far more accurate to say that no matter how much scientific proof you have, there will always be religious- or conspiracy-minded people who will not believe it. Scientific truth brooks no disbelief or argument. If something is proven scientifically to be true, then it is true. There are no ifs, and, or buts. Invoking divine privilege is utterly nonscientific, and is therefore not proof. \n\nedit: grammar", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339366406", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I just got back from Scotland naught two weeks ago! It's such a beautiful country! I spent three days in Edinburgh, then took a three day tour of the Highlands with a company called MacBackpackers (I would definitely recommend it). \n\nBut one of our nights in the Highlands was spent in Inverness (Gaelic for \"Mouth of the Ness\"). When you're exploring the Loch Ness area, take a dip in Loch Ness. We went down to the south end of the Loch, where it seemed like anyone could just stroll up and go in. The water's pretty cold and the shore is stoney, but it's a good story to tell when you get back, how you \"swam with Nessie\".\n\nInverness itself, in all honesty, seemed sort of scummy (I hope no one is offended by this). We went on a saturday night, so the bar scene was great, but it seemed like everyone wanted to fight. Also, since it was a saturday night when we got there, we couldn't exactly explore any attraction Inverness had to offer. \n\nWhat was great about Scotland, and specifically the the Highlands, was that everything is just a few hour drive from where you're staying. So if you're based out of the Loch Ness area, and are up for a half day drive/train ride(?), I would suggest checking out the Isle of Skye.

You just don't think about it (virtually by definition). How do you know the Loch Ness monster isn't waiting outside your door? Etc. That's common sense behaviour, and it's how science actually works. And honestly, whenever people start an appeal with \"We as scientists..\" telling people they should be more 'open-minded' to their ideas, it's a crackpot who's idea was quite justly dismissed out of hand. I've never seen an actual scientist talk like that. Actual scientists dismiss dozens of ideas every day.\n\nI'll tell you my (and pretty much all good scientists, I'd say) exact criteria for dismissing something out of hand: 1) If there's no empirical evidence to support it. Go do an experiment using elevation changes, artificial moonlight, or what-have-you to give solid empirical evidence for why this effect might exist. Or 2) If you have a theory, based on our current knowledge, for why this would be possible. \n\nYou don't have either (1) or (2) in this case, and everything we know from (2) tells us the exact opposite. Perhaps you don't fully grasp how extraordinarily weak the gravitational force actually is. It's entirely fine to dismiss something out of hand when there's no reason whatsoever to believe it's true, and plenty of reasons to believe otherwise. If you want to believe in something without evidence and even in spite of available evidence, then that's religion, not science.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339500883", "subreddit": "askscience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

I essentially considered myself Christian, but with an adult prospective I think I was essentially agnostic and merely applied that label because it appeared 'correct' socially.\n\nIn my teenage years, I think in part due to natural teenage rebelliousness and part due to desire for belonging, I explored alternatives, primarily witchcraft (non-wiccan). This didn't last very long however, as I found them extremely unsatisfying. This somewhat coincided with a shift at that point away from a lot of non-skeptical viewpoints. Prior to this, in my teens, I was a big fan of aliens, loch ness monster, big foot, etc. At about 19 years old I switched very hard to skepticism. I cannot, however, put my finger on exactly why this was. \n\nAt this point, I turned into agnosticism whole heartedly, yet still found it unsatisfying, as I couldn't come up with a reasonable justification for a middle ground. I also read the bible and corresponded fairly in depth with a Christian friend to learn more about Christianity, but found many parts of it personally morally objectionable. I like to think I did not base my position on this alone, however I think it would be naive to assume I can be perfectly objective, so I am sure it played some influence, and probably provided some of my motivation to move away from an agnostic middle ground.\n\nHowever, moving into hard atheism left me uncomfortable, as I found it hard to justify a position of certitude with my current information, yet at the same time agnosticism appeared to me illogical. After some exploration, it occurred to me that I couldn't actually think of a reasonable justification for even asking the question 'is there a god' with some help from Russell's teapot and Carl Sagan's writings.

{"body": "Photons are made of electric and magnetic fields, oscillating at unbelievable frequencies, with wavelengths thousands of times smaller than the smallest thing the human eye can detect.  Every color we see, that we've ever seen, and that we ever will see is contained in a narrow band around 600 nm wide.  Beyond that, we have ultraviolet, which we experience most commonly emitted from the sun.  Beyond that still, we have the x-rays, with wavelengths on the scale of the atom.  Even further, we have gamma rays.  Some of the most powerful and violent explosions in the universe are gamma ray bursts, capable of destroying entire planets.  \n\nBelow our tiny band of visibility, there's the infrared, which you most commonly experience as heat off a fire or on a hot summer day.  Then comes the microwave, capable of invisibly cooking our food.  The longest wavelengths are in the radio spectrum, which transmit millions of hours of information to our radios every day.  These wavelengths can be on the order of the size of buildings, with the theoretical maximum being the size of the universe itself.\n\nThe most amazing thing, I think, is that all these spectra are intimately connected to each other.  They're all manifestations of the same electromagnetic waves responsible for granting us light.  No matter what the wavelength, these waves always travel at the speed of light (in vacuum).  The speed of light is incomprehensibly fast; 1 second at the speed of light is enough to travel around the Earth's circumference 7 1/2 times.  And even still, some objects are so amazingly far away we have to use other measurements.  It takes light a little over 8 minutes to reach us from the sun.  That means that sunrise isn't when the sun is actually in position, it's when the light reaches us.  When we look at the sun, we're looking at the sun's position as it was 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago.  We're essentially looking back in time.  Even still, the closest star to our sun is Proxima Centauri, a mere 4.2 lightyears away.  That means that photons emitted from the sun in early 2008 are just now reaching that star.  And that's the closest star.  The closest galaxy, Andromeda, is 2.5 million lightyears away.  That means that light emitted form our galaxy when the Earth was in the Paleolithic era, before Homo Sapiens evolved, is just now reaching Andromeda.  \n\nIt's easy to forget about these things when all we see is tiny twinkling dots of light juxtaposed against a dark sky.  But what's incredible about that is in those dark patches of sky, countless millions upon billions of stars, nebulae, and galaxies find their residence.  Go outside tonight and hold up your thumb at arm's length.  Do you see your thumbnail?  Contained in the portion of sky the same size as your thumbnail reside millions of galaxies and billions, perhaps even trillions of stars.  You may feel incredibly small by this, but I feel humbled.  Knowing that we are a part of all that is perhaps the most amazing thing about us.  Just by knowing this, it's enough to make me feel incredibly large.  So go out tonight, smoke a bowl, and just stare up out there, with the knowledge that photons born inside the fiery cataclysms of stars traveled hundreds and thousands of lightyears, past other stars and nebulae, just so it could finally come to rest in your eyes.  \n\n**TL;DR - Light is amazing shit.** ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339623054", "subreddit": "treecomics", "score": 34, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "(page 3)\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50ljtg?context=1) (canoedust):**\n\n&gt; Maybe pictures from the camp? Or something from when you were involved in AWANA? It seems like it may be kind of hard to prove it without identifying yourself.\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50lywg?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; Hmm, I don't have anything physical from AWANA, as my ribbons, books, and trophies (yes, I had trophies) and I really don't want to post where I went but I will give some details on the structure of it. Maybe I can convince you guys.  \n&gt; I started as a \"Spark\", the second youngest age group, from kindergarten to the end of 1st grade. Even younger than that group was the \"Cubbies\" toddlers who could really not even read yet. Their books had a lot of Bible coloring scenes. At that time, the \"Sparks\" had three books full of verses, the first was \"Skipper\", then \"Hiker\" (I think) and then \"Climber\". You received a ribbon for completing each book. For the boys, the next goup was \"Pals\" for the older elementary kids and I believe \"Chums\" for the female group. Middle School boys were \"Pioneers\" but I can't remember the girl's group name. The name AWANA is an acronym for \"Approved Workmen Are Not Ashamed\" and I'm pretty sure that's a biblical reference out of 2 Timothy. The song (I swear I'm doing this from memory) was:\n&gt; Hail! AWANA  \n&gt; On the march for youth!  \n&gt; Hail AWANA, (holding?) forth the truth!  \n&gt; Building lives on the Word of God  \n&gt; AWANA stands!  \n&gt; Our Savior (something) us!\n&gt; Our banner glorious!  \n&gt; We'll fight vic-torious!  \n&gt; For Christ our King!  \n&gt; YOUTH *stomp stomp* ON THE MARCH *stomp stomp stomp*  \n&gt; (The stomp or clap and the chant at the end is something all AWANA kids would probably know.)  \n&gt; I feel mighty silly for typing that out and I know I could have just Googled it and lied, but anyone else in AWANA, vouch for me.  \n&gt; Also, the status symbol for the \"Sparks\" were little plastic crowns and when you completed a book section they gave you a little plastic Jewel to stick in it representing your path to eternal salvation in heaven. Bronze, silver, then gold. Sparks wore little red vests and Cubbies wore little blue ones. Cubbies vests had two weird buttons that never seemed to clasp right. \n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50m194?context=1) (1AMTHEWALRUS):**\n\n&gt; What was the scariest thing you witnessed at Jesus Camp? And if religion wasn't pushed on you as hard as it was, do you think that you'd still be a Christian?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50m8sv?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; Remember, I was IN it, so what seems scary to an outsider (and scary to me now) seemed pretty normal. I will say as a kid it's almost scarier to see old people bawling their eyes out and praying hardcore for salvation, because to a little christian kid, you think that the adults have it all figured out and are already going to heaven. It's more scary to see someone doubt the faith because you fear for their eternal life as well as your own. One of the craziest times was during the week of 9/11. Our church was having a week long revival, (every evening around 6) and then the news hit everyone and the church was PACKED full of people. Standing room only. It was surreal. You could see the fear in people's eyes and they've gone to the only place they know to find guidance or hope during a very uncertain time. People thought it was the apocalypse, and the end times had begun. In true biblical fashion, there was wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50m1he?context=1) (jutct):**\n\n&gt; How many people do you murder every day without god telling you it's wrong?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50m8wn?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; Oh bout tree fiddy\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50m5ug?context=1) (Nacho_torpedo):**\n\n&gt; As a former AWANAs member this is all true, but you annoy me for making it sound so cult-like. It was not like that at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; edit: I also barely remember the group's song, and only remembered it when I read it above. I have since been trying to sing it in my head and keep ending up at \"Camp Anawana, we hold you in our hearts...\"\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50mhdh?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; I apologize if I have offended anyone by making it sound like a cult,  and I'm sure not every AWANA chapter was like mine. But some churches are a little more extreme than others. Believe me, AWANA was very popular in my town, and kids kept coming back, they weren't forced. They did have fun. But it was a very conservative, fundamental environment, and there are many people here on reddit who never experience what that's like.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50m4oh?context=1) (HaroldEtMaude):**\n\n&gt; Coming from a very religious upbringing as a Jehovah Witness, I can sort of relate to your experience.   I also did the same thing when I left the organization.  It was basically just one day I just finally decided that I was not going back.  I just cut it off.  I was going constantly and then one day refused to ever go to a meeting again.   My question... Did you feel like it was easier in a way to be part of the religion?  That being part of the religion helped you not have to think about certain parts of your life?   I noticed that when I left, I started realizing that I have free thought and could not feel conflicted with having my own opinion.  Did you go through a transition like this, or did you pretty much feel this completely when you stopped going?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50msm5?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; Yeah, conforming to a set of beliefs, especially one that promises such grandiose things as eternal life or a place in heaven is sometimes much easier. If you do something bad, or you feel guilty, falling back on your beliefs that say you'll be forgiven gives you closure. Without faith, you're forced to come to terms with wrongdoing on your own, and that's hard to do sometimes. But it can be done.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50m8sk?context=1) (b1gthr0b):**\n\n&gt; Did your church ever get outwardly political with the children like in Jesus Camp? Did you ever pray for W?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50mwpx?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; No, that's one thing I will say is that political agendas were never really pushed too hard at my church. Sure, homosexuality was preached against from time to time, but the fact is that it is in the Bible, and Baptists are very Bible-savvy people and consider it the word of God. We did pray for Bush during church but it was more to pray for God's guidance of our country's leadership and our troops.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50msme?context=1) (katrionatronica):**\n\n&gt; That sounds strange.\n&gt; \n&gt; Did you ever believe really strongly? Did you ever have a passionate faith?\n&gt; \n&gt; I would have thought you'd have gone through some pretty traumatic emotions upon realising that the bedrock of your family's life was a lie. Didn't you feel anything like that? \n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50n7q9?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; Well, the Baptist faith is very Bible-driven. Sermons usually always begin with a study of a chapter and then the message is built around that. But for me, I enjoyed reading the Bible, but I liked it for different reasons. I liked the idea that I was reading truly ancient texts from a time so different than mine, and I think I began to read as literature and less as dogma. The Bible does have a lot of value to it, and it is preserved extremely well. I basically started to weed out what was probably just mythology (Much of Genesis and Exodus) and what was probably records of old oral histories. Looking at it that way allows me to understand how and why people take it so literally, and how many of its moral codes have remained so stable throughout thousands of years of human society and culture. So I think I approached it in a way that sort of let me down gradually instead of a sudden shock to the belief system. \n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50mtza?context=1) (Shoomoo):**\n\n&gt; Did any of your friends go to Jesus Camp? What happened to them?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50neue?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; Actually, I didn't have too many friends from school go to AWANA with me, or even the same church. A lot of the time I was kind of plugging along on my own. Friends would come and go. \n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50mt8d?context=1) (13Man):**\n\n&gt; From your experience how damaging is religious indoctrination on a child's ability to critically think as they get older?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/v1vh3/_/c50nrft?context=1) (FredCDobbsy):**\n\n&gt; It varies. I know a lot of kids younger than me from this church and they bit hard on that stuff. The whole lifestyle. As far as critical thinking, it's just that they have been so extremely trusting of anything that they are told (because why would grown adults lie to you for no reason?) that they really have a hard time socially in school. They seem very nieve and they can't handle criticism very well. Outside of church they are very quiet and withdrawn. They just kind of isolate themselves and the other kids think they are weird. I would say it damages them more socially than anything else, although I'm not sure of their academic performance so I can't speak for that.\n\n*****\n\n(continued below)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339703553", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; That's actually a fair point. But alcohol was widely used by most cultures and is still widely socially accepted in 'Western' cultures.\n\nBefore there was alcohol, there were \"magic\" substances. Mushrooms, leaves, and toxic toads that were used in sacred ceremonies dating back to the Paleolithic era.\n\nAnd I don't buy the \"culture\" argument. Not only because culture changes, but also because it's a poor excuse for legislating morality. Your culture is not my culture, and vice versa.\n\n&gt; Drugs, on the other hand, have never been widely acceptable.\n\nNot true. For one, alcohol *is* a drug and its exclusion from that category is completely arbitrary, but even if we exclude alcohol for the sake of argument, drugs have been widely-accepted in numerous cultures around the globe.\n\nCocaine, morphine, heroin, meth, and numerous opiates were all consumed openly by the American masses at various points in recent history. It's only when the Drug War ramped up under Nixon that we see the rise of anti-hard-drug stigma. Before that, meth was just something that mommies and daddies took to get through the day.\n\nBut even before the rise of Nixon, of course, you're right... there was a stigma about drugs like opium, marijuana, and to a lesser-extent psychedelics, specifically LSD (although LSD was a new drug at that point, and people's disdain for it was mostly due to their disdain for the hippies who enjoyed taking it).\n\nAnd speaking of stigma...\n\n&gt; Even during the 20's there was a stigmatism associated with them.\n\nIf by \"them\" you mean opium and marijuana, then yes. And why do you think that is?\n\nOpium laws came about as a result of an anti-Chinese immigrant movement. At the same time those laws were enacted, even harder drugs were perfectly legal to sell in retail. I believe Coca-Cola still had cocaine in it.\n\nMarijuana laws have a similar racist origin (both anti-black and anti-Mexican), although the case against marijuana was also pushed by certain corporate interests. Its prohibition probably likely wouldn't have succeeded without the efforts of both.\n\n&gt; You can't surely argue that \"drugs\" are or ever were as integrated into our culture as much as alcohol?\n\nI believe I just did. And, once again, \"our culture\" is a loose term. Too loose to be relevant in a political discussion such as this. While culture may make certain legislation more difficult to pass (no doubting that), that resistance doesn't determine the validity of the argument.\n\nNevermind how fluid \"culture\" truly is. If you would have told me ten years ago that by 2012 over half of the American population would be in support of both gay marriage *and* the decriminalization of marijuana, I'd have said you were mad, but here we are.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339751606", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "&gt; Before there was alcohol, there were \"magic\" substances. Mushrooms, leaves, and toxic toads that were used in sacred ceremonies dating back to the Paleolithic era.\n\nI'm not disputing that.  I *am* stating that alcohol has always been more widely used and integrated into 'societies' (with the recent exception of Islamic societies from the past 1300 years or so).  \n\n&gt;Cocaine, morphine, heroin, meth, and numerous opiates were all consumed openly by the American masses at various points in recent history.\n\nAnd never, ever to the degree that alcohol was.  Are you ***seriously*** comparing the use of cocaine and heroin with alcohol and suggesting they were as widely used and accepted?  That whole industries grew up to support them?  That national tax revenue was generated by said industries?  That hundreds of thousands of people were employed by those industries?\n\nAre you suggesting that?\n\n&gt;  It's only when the Drug War ramped up under Nixon that we see the rise of anti-hard-drug stigma\n\nI'm not sure about that.  Heroin was regulated for medical purposes only in 1914 and banned entirely in 1924.  Cocaine has been considered a vice since Victorian times (reference the abuse of the drug by Sherlock Holmes in popular literature of the times).  It was effectively banned in 1922.\n\nAll of this, and more, is easily found on wikipedia.\n\n&gt; For one, alcohol is a drug and its exclusion from that category is completely arbitrary\n\nYou're just being argumentative.  You know, or should know, that when I said \"drugs\" I meant illegal narcotics.\n\n&gt;&gt;You can't surely argue that \"drugs\" are or ever were as integrated into our culture as much as alcohol?\n\n&gt; I believe I just did. And, once again, \"our culture\" is a loose term. \n\nI could do without the neo-Marxist nonsense about \"culture\".  You know what I mean.  Society, culture, country... whatever.  If we're going to start bickering over trivalities like that, then there's no point in going on.\n\nAnyway, you did just argue that and I believe you are completely wrong.  Use of narcotics does not equate integration.  If you honestly believe narcotics were as widely used as beer and wine, then we are poles apart.  I actually don't think you believe that at all actually.  How could you, possibly?\n\n&gt;If you would have told me ten years ago that by 2012 over half of the American population would be in support of both gay marriage and the decriminalization of marijuana, I'd have said you were mad, but here we are.\n\nYeah, that also is a fair point.  Forget your difficulties with the \"culture\" (kind of tilting at windmills with that one anyway 10tothe24th), but I agree that society evolves.  \n\nCocaine and heroin were, at one stage, legal and whilst frowned upon (why else were they controlled?) they were available.  Society and public health concerns evolved and they became illegal.  I personally think the chances of reverting that is next to impossible.  That's why I said it would never happen.  I believe that.  I cannot see the people of the United States legalize what you guys call Class A drugs.  \n\nWho knows?  Maybe I'm wrong.\n\n\nPS - On a related note, 50% of the US support the decriminalization of marijuana?

{"body": "I meant to write my thought processes for all these, but I forgot. I think a lot of them are coincidences though. \n\nThe mushroom Pokemon, Exadrill, Magnezone and Haunchcrow just give me an Earthbound vibe. It's pretty likely that these were just based on animals that just happen to be in Earthbound. Mushroom creatures are popular in RPGs, but they are a pretty memorable part of Earthbound to me. I also forgot to list Durant and the Titanic Ant. Both are giant gray ants. \n\nThe Barrier Trio from Mother 3 is an interesting example because it would be Mother 3 paying homage to Pokemon. They are a trio of what appear to be golems with dots for eyes. Each member of the trio will change their weakness to a different element, similar to how the Regi Trio have different elements. They're also golems with dots for eyes.\n\nLapras is based on the loch ness monster, and so is Tessie. It's a first generation Pokemon which may mean it was intentional. What made this seem more suspicious is the fact that Shiny Lapras is purple, like Tessie. \n \nMewtwo is an homage to Giegue. Also  I realized Mewtwo looks like Freiza. :P\n\nThe Wooly Shamblr and Snorunt are both snow creatures, but on second thought they could be both based from the same thing in mythology. They both appear in snowy areas, but that's part of the mythology.\n\nDeoxys could be seen as a counterpart to Mewtwo, like how Celebi, Jirachi, Manaphy, Shaymin and Melodetta are considered 'Mews.'  Mewtwo is an homage to Giegue, so it might not be a stretch for him to be based on a Starman but it's really vague. His defense form looks really similar, especially his shiny sprite. He also arrives from space as a virus on a meteor, similar to how Starmens are from space. Starmen are Giegue's henchmen. \n\nShiny Muk looks like Master Belch, but again it could just be a coincidence. \n\n\nDruddigon and the Crag Lizard both look visually similar and are related to rocks. However they could both be based on gargoyles. It does look really similar to me though. \n\nSpiritomb looks like the boogey tent and demon face from Earthbound, again a coincidence. \n\nTessie, the Maid from Mother 3 has the exact same colourscheme as the maid from Black/White. This one seems intentional, due to the fact there are a lot of weird Mother 3 similarities Black/white. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339788470", "subreddit": "pokemonconspiracies", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "[On how evolution is false](http://jesus-is-savior.com/Evolution%20Hoax/evidences.htm)\n#12\n\"Evolutionists insist that dinosaurs died out millions of years before man appeared. However, there are many reasons to disbelieve this. There are the stories of animals much like dinosaurs in the legends of many lands. These creatures were called dragons.\n\nMany times in the recent past, explorers have recorded sightings of flying reptiles much like the pterodactyl. Human footprints were found along with those of a dinosaur in limestone near the Paluxy River in Texas.\n\nAlso not to be tossed aside is the possibility of dinosaurs living today. Consider the stories such as the Loch Ness monster (of which many convincing photographs have been taken). Some have claimed to see dinosaur-like creatures in isolated areas of the world.\n\nRecently, a Japanese fishing boat pulled up a carcass of a huge animal that intensely resembled a dinosaur. A group of scientists on an expedition into a jungle looking for dinosaur evidence claims that they witnessed one, but their camera was damaged.\n\nHowever, they tape recorded the roar of the beast. This recording was checked. The voice patterns on it did not resemble those of any other roaring. You decide. At any rate, the evidence that man and dinosaur did live together at one time poses another problem for the evolutionists.\n\n'But if the dinosaurs lived at the same time as man, they would have had to have been on the Ark, and that's impossible!\" Is it? The ark was about one and one-half football fields long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet tall. It had a cubic footage of 1,518,750.\n\nThere would have been plenty of room on the Ark for the dinosaurs (especially considering that only a few were of the enormous size of Tyrannosaurus or \"Brontosaurus.\") Also, the Bible states that Noah was to take two of every kind onto the Ark. Many dinosaurs and reptiles were of the same kind, but much smaller.

Soon I started getting kind of turned on by the thought of paying one of these beautiful young girls for sex.  \n\nI finally decided that I wanted to do it, I flagged one of the more beautiful looking streetwalkers down and asked her how much she wanted to charge for sex, to my dismay, she did not speak any English so I went on my way (on the prowl) looking for another prosititute.\n\nA few minutes later I spotted another one and this one was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in Thailand so far,  I'm guessing when people think about prostitutes in the redlight district of bangkok, THIS is who they think of.  \n\nI flagged her down as well and I was very elated to find that she did speak English, very well in fact.  I asked her how much it was for her \"services\" and she replied to me \"I decide after the sex, but I promise it won't be more than 500 dollars\"\nI almost reconsidered because 500 dollars was a lot of money for me at the time, but I ended up taking the deal.  Apparently she was pretty high end for a streetwalker and we ended up going to my hotel in a completely different area of bangkok.\n\nSo, we go up to my hotel room and have the best sex I have ever had in my life, it was absolutely phenomenal. (PhenomAnal)\n\nAfter the amazing sex we layed in my bed together and did something I thought prostitutes don't normally do, we cuddled, hugged, and kissed, I finally got around to asking her what the bill was and she said it was free.\n\n\"Free? Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n\nShe looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\"\nShe replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness monster had tricked me again!  \n\nI yelled at her as she swam away, never to be seen again.\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Haha..

So fuck it.\n\nI was at a bar in Atlanta one night with a couple of my buddies. I'm a guy, so I brought a girl and one of my gay friends along. Wingman and all. Anyways, I had heard about a glory hole there from a mutual friend. Well, I go in the bathroom and check it out. And, sure enough, there's a nice little present there for me. A nice, beautiful, not too veiny black penis staring at me. Straight in the face. I'm apprehensive about it all, but I think *Hell, let's give it a go.* He is a little shy even though I can't see his face. I can tell because he kept making wincing sounds, and I said *I'll be gentle*. So I start to go down on him and he is making more and more moaning sounds. \n\nI then find some lube that was already in there for a special occasion ( guess the person that made the hole thought it'd be a good idea ) so I got up, straddled myself against his hard penis, and we commenced to making love. He was a wonderful lover, very gentle at first knowing that it was my first glory hole encounter, but he eventually came, I  noticed, however, he had an unusual color of ejaculate. It was purple.

{"body": "For anyone who TL;DR'd the article (don't worry, I don't blame you) here's a summary:\n\nThe most important point is that Louisiana will be giving state voucher money to private Christian schools that teach bigoted, unscientific textbooks.\n\nOne school, the Eternity Christian Academy, will be receiving $1m in funds and is increasing enrollment from 38 to 172.\n\nThe textbooks they use are nothing new, but shocking nonetheless.\n\nECA uses the Accelerated Christian Education curriculum. Here is a quote from a book published in 1995, which is still being used today (at least in Britain). *\"Could a fish have developed into a dinosaur? As astonishing as it may seem, many evolutionists theorize that fish evolved into amphibians and amphibians into reptiles. This gradual change from fish to reptiles has no scientific basis. No transitional fossils have been or ever will be discovered because God created each type of fish, amphibian, and reptile as separate, unique animals.\"*\n\nIn addition, the ACE claims:\n\n*\"Some scientists speculate that Noah took small or baby dinosaurs on the Ark.... are dinosaurs still alive today? With some recent photographs and testimonies of those who claimed to have seen one, scientists are becoming more convinced of their existence...\"*\n\n- The Loch Ness monster exists\n\n- Science Proves Homosexuality is a Learned Behavior\n\n- The Second Law of Thermodynamics Disproves Evolution\n\n- No Transitional Fossils Exist\n\n- Humans and Dinosaurs Co-Existed\n\n- Evolution Has Been Disproved\n\n- A Japanese Whaling Boat Found a Dinosaur\n\n- Solar Fusion is a Myth\n\nFurther criticism (written by Jonny Scaramanga, a Brit raised on the ACE curriculum)\n\n&gt;**Learning and assessment methodologies**\n&gt;...ACE tests almost exclusively consist of multiple choice, matching, or fill-in-the-blank questions. These means only test factual recall, not understanding. Even if the students are trying to take a deep learning approach, they are not given the opportunity...\n&gt;Options on the multiple choice tests are frequently meaningless, such as \"Jesus died on the (cross, toss, chrome)\"\n\n&gt;ACE prescribes a system of rewards and punishments for students. Those who achieve academic and behavioural goals are awarded privileges such as extended break times and the freedom to move without permission. All the rewards offered are forms of extrinsic motivation, emphasising that learning itself is not the thing of value.\n\n&gt;ACE rejects virtually all modern educational theory.\n\n&gt;**Science**\n\n&gt;The ACE curriculum includes no practical science and accordingly no investigation. This would be troublesome for any ACE student embarking on a science higher education course.\n\n&gt;\"The PACEs are based on the reading comprehension mode of learning... There is no room within this method of learning for the negotiation of topics, for whole class problem solving, for the generation of ideas, for the formulating and testing of hypotheses, discussion of results and social application.\"\n\n&gt;...Rather than weighing evidence objectively, the ACE system rejects any science that contradicts the Bible, stating:\n\n&gt;\"True science will never contradict the Bible because God created both the universe and Scripture...If a scientific theory contradicts the Bible, then the theory is wrong and must be discarded.\"\n\n&gt;**Racial insensitivity**\n\n&gt;The ACE curriculum shows insensitivity towards blacks, Jews, and natives.  ...During apartheid, ACE claimed that if blacks were given the vote, it would destroy the South African economy. [ACE further states that segregation was beneficial for the individuality of cultures]\n\n&gt;**Political Bias**\n\n&gt;ACE materials do not allow the consideration of any opposing point of view. This fails to develop skills required for degree-level study such as forming an argument, considering different opinions, and analysing the validity of claims. Rather than engaging with differing points of view, ACE derides them. ACE's approach to politics borders on propaganda, with opinions presented as fact.\"\n\n\nTwo other books to be used in LA fundamentalist schools are published by A Beka Book and Bob Jones University Press. They contain the following:\n\n- Only ten percent of Africans can read or write, because Christian mission schools have been shut down by communists.\n\n- \"the [Ku Klux] Klan in some areas of the country tried to be a means of reform, fighting the decline in morality and using the symbol of the cross... In some communities it achieved a certain respectability as it worked with politicians.\"  \n\n- \"God used the 'Trail of Tears' to bring many Indians to Christ.\" \n\n- It \"cannot be shown scientifically that that man-made pollutants will one day drastically reduce the depth of the atmosphere's ozone layer.\" \n\n- \"God has provided certain 'checks and balances' in creation to prevent many of the global upsets that have been predicted by environmentalists.\"\n\n- the Great Depression was exaggerated by propagandists, including John Steinbeck, to advance a socialist agenda.\n\n- \"Unions have always been plagued by socialists and anarchists who use laborers to destroy the free-enterprise system that hardworking Americans have created.\"\n\n- Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential win was due to an imaginary economic crisis created by the media.\n\n- \"The greatest struggle of all time, the Battle of Armageddon, will occur in the Middle East when Christ returns to set up his kingdom on earth.\"\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1339958320", "subreddit": "politics", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Was I really that good?\" I asked her and she laughed, she said yes, I was the best client she'd ever had.\n&gt; \n&gt; She looked me in the eye and said \"But I need one little thing...\" and I honestly thought she wanted another round of sex.. so I eagerly replied \"What do you need?\"\n&gt; She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Now it was around this time that I realized this prostitute was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

Trace landing cases have been reported and analyzed, especially when Project Blue Book was in full swing. [Hynek personally investigated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Zamora) a few of these trace landing cases.\n\n&gt; There are as many photographs of UFOs as there are of the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nWow, again, wrong.

It states: \"The higher the quality of the case, the more likely it was to be classified unknown.\"\n\n&gt; Finally, it should be noted that UFOs are usually observed by untrained sky watchers and almost never by professional or amateur astronomers, people who spend inordinate amounts of time observing the heavens above\n\n[According to a 1977 survey of the membership of the American Astronomical Society](http://www.uapreporting.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/jse_08_1_sturrock.pdf), table 3.2 shows that when you break down the respondents in terms of those who have witnessed something unexplainable versus those who have not witnessed anything unexplainable, we find again that the witnesses are **more likely to be professional night observers** while non-witnesses were **more likely to not be night observers at all.** This is a truly potent contradiction of the notion that astronomers \"don't see UFOs\".\n\nLast but not least, I love how the supposed skeptic who wrote the article automagically makes the jump from UFOs to aliens without skipping a beat. \n\n----\n\nedit: meant to reply to [this comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/v86jn/why_is_there_no_faq_with_sources_for_debunking/c5260ng) whoops.\n \nIs [Reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette) dead in this sub? \n\n&gt; * Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, but only if you really think it might help the poster improve.\n\n&gt; * Don't downvote opinions just because you disagree with them.

We wanted to spend a maximum amount of money on actual gambling, rather than some fancy hotel, so we decided to tent it up at a local campground. It was one of those places that usually only has campers and rv's, but we were cheap and really wanted to give it a go. About midnight we realized why people didn't usually set up tents. God damn train every hour on the hour honking it's motherfucking horn. \n\n\nFinally, around the 3rd time I was woken up I decided to maybe take a walk on the beach. This was after the oil spill in the gulf, maybe the year after, so I figured I might find some tar balls or some deformed dead birds or something. No such luck. I started back to the tent site when I noticed something bobbing out in the ocean water. Fuck if it didn't look like a head, and was swimming closer. After about 10 minutes I realized it was just a water buoy. I freaked myself out/ got myself all excited for nothing. Turn around, and there's a cop, just staring at me. Show ID, let him know what's going on. Thankfully, I wasn't high or drunk. Start back to the tent site, again, when he stops me. \n\n\nI turn around and what I see is unimaginable. His skin is peeling back, revealing a long neck, little round head, greenish brown scaly skin. He says to me, \"Can I get about tree-fiddy?\" God Damn Loch Ness Monster. Can't catch no breaks.

{"body": "So he didn't give you an appropriate response so I will.\n\n**It is 100% correct to assume, and say, that these things are untrue.**\n\nWhy?\n\nThe concept of truth, at its core, only deals in reality.  It is understood that individual experiences of reality are not identical.  Thus, a meaningful idea of 'truth' can only exist in the shared aspects of reality, not the private ones.  You can believe in your heart of hearts that Jesus is the blah blah blah, or about Allah or the Buddha or a really cool skateboard, but that doesn't make it *true* in a way that has any value to the world around you.  Confronting this problem has been an effort of the legal, philosophic, and scientific systems.\n\nPractically speaking, truth can only reside in the parts of the world everyone has access to, for that word to hold any useful value.  So why does this allow for us to dismiss these claims?  Because truth of the shared aspects of reality can only be demonstrated through evidence.  There is nowhere near enough evidence to support these claims that is meaningful enough to even given them a second thought.\n\nSo, philosophically, to accept *any claim* that lacks evidence is to give credence to *all claims* that lack evidence, be it the reality of Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Jesus' existence, Socrates' existence, or the Magic School Bus as an alien transmission.\n\nThis approach is useless and irrational when looked at with any intellectual honesty.  Instead, the default position is to reject that which lacks evidence, and only decide when sufficient evidence provides itself.  As David Hume said, \"A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence.\"  These beliefs would need *overwhelming evidence* to be considered given how much evidence that these things do not occur there is.\n\nCase in point:  In the existence of the Earth, approximately 100 trillion humans have ever been born. [Source](http://www.prb.org/articles/2002/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth.aspx).  In that time, only, perhaps, two dozen in all of history have ever been claimed to be born without an earthyl father*that we know of.*  Christians do not take it seriously that the Buddha was born without a father even though his story took place 500 years earlier, proving they discount the idea, and thus all but 1 of these 20 or so.  Thus, to show that something is a rare as 1 in 100 trillion, you would need a library of evidence just for him and it would still have to be more convincing than the idea that it was just a story like the Buddha and so many others.  Furthermore, the answer to the statement, \"Well you don't know,\" (besides laughter and ridicule) is the very simple, \"My knowledge is irrelevant.  You do not know either, and thus have no basis to make a claim.\"  If the person persists, then according to their logic, before the advent of writing, *every single person could just as likely have been born a virgin from God, because \"you don't know they weren't.*  This problem actually insurmountable to that line of reasoning.\n\nSo, lacking the volume of evidence necessary for such outlandish claims, it is, based on modern tenets of the legal system, scientific inquiry, and philosophy, only practical to conclude that these stories are false until a time at which the evidence changes.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340141472", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 12, "controversiality": 0}

I had basically zero control over my life. And I liked it that way.\n\n I had run away from home in late 2001 and made my way south through California, taking small menial jobs here and there. I soon found myself submerged in the uglier aspects of that instability. I drifted from bars to clubs to some of the kinds of places you see people running from on COPS, just because I could. \n\n\nI guess after years of what I was sure was my oppressive parents ruining my life (ha) the polar opposite of that was just too tempting. \n\nEarly in 2004 I found myself in a small town in what I assumed was the greater San Diego area. I later found out I was in Tonopah, Nevada, but that's beside the point. \n\nI was sitting in a small bar at the edge of town late one night. I worked there earlier that day, and the day before, washing dishes and sleeping on a ragged mat out back. I was planning on heading out the next morning. West, maybe. It had been a while since I saw the sea.\n\nThen she walked in. She was older than me, 30 maybe, but she was stunning. She had long auburn hair and eyes so green they were almost hard to look at. She sat down and ordered something. I heard her talking, but it took me a minute to realize she was talking to me. \n\n\"You're new around here,\" she said, sipping on some dark mixed drink. That much was obvious, in just two days I had already realized this place had an already established regular clientele, and I was definitely not among them. \n\n\"Nah, just passing through town,\" I replied, in my best \"cool guy\" voice. She smirked. \n\n\"Can I get you something to drink?\" she asked. I fought the urge to say yes. I still had a shred of self-respect. \n\n\"Nah, I don't drink,\" I answered, with a half-empty glass of... something in my hand. She laughed.\n\n\"Well maybe there's something else you'd be interested in.\" She leaned forward.\n\n\"Yes.\" I stood up, knocking over my stool. She laughed even harder. I had broken my character and let my inner horny 20 year old shine through. At least she found it funny.\n\nWe walked outside and she pointed to the hotel across the street. \"That's my place,\"  she said, pointing at the second story window. She grabbed my arm and led me up the auxiliary side stairs. \"It's faster.\" None of this seemed out of place. I'd been worse places with shadier people.\n\nWe walked in through a side hall and into her room. It was small, barren, but oddly well kept.\n\n She grabbed my hand and threw me down on the bed, then sat on top of me, clothed. She began unbuttoning my shirt, then my pants. My... excitement, was quite obvious, much to her amusement. I reached for her shirt, but she moved my hand away. \"Not yet.\" Okay.\n\n\"Do you....\" she began asking. \"Do you have...\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's just...\" she began to tear up. \"I need...\" she tried to continue. Tears were running down her face.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" Now it was about that time that I realized that this girl was 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

{"body": "Settle in for the greatest story of my lifetime. This was a few years ago, I had been feeling a little ill for a few days and had been unable to poop. It also happened to be my friend's birthday that same week so as it people do, celebrations needed to be had.\n\nWe decided to meet up at a Montana's steakhouse to have some supper and drinks to celebrate my friend's birthday. Though I was feeling sick, I figured that I would just fight through it, nothing could be that bad right? \n\nSo we go to the restaurant and order our meals, since I am feeling under the weather, I order a salad and a small sandwich, there is no way I am risking getting steak and having an explosion in the restaurant. I also decide to stick with vodka since it does not usually hurt my stomach in the way that beer might.\n\nSo all is well and we get our meals. I eat my food and we order another round of drinks. Around this time my stomach begins to feel funny. I hear it churning and my insides are gurgling. I ask the server if there is any reason that my meal would make me feel sick because I am started to get cold sweats. \n\nAfter checking with the chef, he tells me that there might have been a mistake and my sandwich might have been made with expired mayonnaise. Now it might just have been a reverse placebo effect but at that very moment, I felt like I was going to explode from both extremities. I need to get to a bathroom and fast. \n\nAs I rush to a stall to destroy it beyond any regular means, the waiter comes in and says \"sir I know you are feeling sick but I have to ask you a few questions, you know for regulations' sake, and to see if I need to call an ambulance\".\n\nAt this point I am irritated so I just yell out \"yeah yeah go ahead\", as I prefer to unleash my fury at the toilet. \n\nSo the waiter begins his questioning, were you sick beforehand? Did the sandwich taste bad? Do you feel like you might pass out? \n\nHe gets to his final question, which I will never forget, \"I think we need to call an ambulance sir, you are severely sick right now, but I need to use the public phones and have no change, could you spare about three fiddy?\"\n\nWell it was then that I noticed that my waiter the whole night was actually about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. And I said \"god damn Lochness monster, I ain't giving you no three fiddy\".\n\nWorst day of my life.

{"body": "When I was in 1st grade my teacher was a mean, grouchy old woman by the name of Mrs. Nessy. \nAbout in the middle of the year Mrs. Nessy called me up in front of the room to do some math problems.  I still remember what problems they were, we were learning advanced math for us at the time and I remember the problem was 34 + 53 - 80.\n\nTo most of us this is a very easy math problem because we're older and thus have had to do stuff like this more and more, but in 1st grade we had no clue.\nAs Mrs. Nessy wrote the problem on the board I could hear all of my classmates rustling in their seats, their bodies firmly planted in their seats sinking lower and lower so maybe Mrs. Nessy wouldn't call on them to come up to the board and solve the problem.  \n\nI let out a deep breath, knowing I was certainly going to get this problem wrong, I know today that the answer was 7, but at the time I had absolutely no clue what I had to do to solve this problem.  I randomly drew an answer to the problem on the board.\n\n14.\n\nI looked at Mrs. Nessy, hoping for a nod of approval to send me back to my seat and make someone else do another problem.  But instead she looked at the answer, looked at me, and said in her deep and grouchy voice, \"Thehealeroftri, you didn't even try to solve the problem, you didn't draw your steps on out the board, you just wrote a random number, come out in the hall with me this instant.\"\n\nShit.\n\nI heard my friends and other classmates in their seats quietly smiling because it was I who had gotten in trouble rather than themselves.  I got pulled into the hall by Mrs. Nessy and she said some words that I will remember for the rest of my life.\n\n\"Thehealeroftri, I know you've been doing well this whole year, you can do better than this I know you can, and I'm going to give you an A+ anyways, this is the highest grade in the class, the 2nd highest grade is a B-, you are now above everyone in the class.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it.  This mean, grouchy teacher had spent this whole year yelling at me and the class in general, I had never seen her this nice. It was strange to say the least.\n\n\"Try better next time, I want you to go home and study and next time you will do better, ok?\"\n\nI was stunned, \"Ok.\" I muttered back to her, I couldn't believe my luck, I turned around to walk back into the classroom when Mrs. Nessy spoke again.\n\n\"Thehealeroftri, wait, I need one more thing\" she said, \"What do you need Mrs. Nessy?\" I asked. \n\"I need about tree fiddy\" Mrs. Nessy said back to me.  \n\nIt was around this time when I realized that Mrs. Nessy was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Definitely not Belle: Here's why\n\n\nA few years ago I went on a vacation to Disneyland in Anaheim, California with my family.  I was 18 years old and a High School Senior and being a high school senior I was horny as fuck. 24/7/365.  But I was on vacation for 4 days in California, so I didn't really think about sex as much as I did back at home, I was more focused on the rides and such.\n\nOn our 2nd day there I rode Splash Mountain and I got off the ride and saw the character Belle saying hello to little girls and whatnot, taking pictures, posing, et cetera. \n\nI usually wouldn't have noticed but the girl in the belle costume was hot as hell, a definite 10/10, I don't think I've ever seen a girl so beautiful in my life.  All of the sudden all of my teenage hornyness came back to me, I got a raging boner, and being the meatheaded teenager I was, I decided to go over to her and try to flirt with her. \n\nI got over there and she looked me in the eyes, I have never once in my life seen eyes as beautiful as her's, they were a deep blue color, with a hint of green, and they enveloped me, absolutely enveloped me. \n\nI could barely talk, \"H-Hi\" I stammered to her as she broke eye contact, she said hi back awkwardly, in the kind of voice that translated roughly to \"Shit, another one, please go away\"\n\nI kind of recovered though and we had a great conversation, at the end of the conversation I could tell she was kind of digging me as, not to brag, I have a way with the ladies when it comes to words.  I gathered up the courage to ask for her number, and much to my surprise she gave it to me.  \n\nI said goodbye to me, and I looked at my watch.\n\nShit.  I talked to her for two hours, those were definitely the fastest two hours of my life.  So I went about my day lusting on her and going on the rides. (Which were awesome as fuck by the way)\n\n3rd day in Disneyland, I looked everywhere for her but couldn't find her.  After the park closed, much to my dismay, I decided to call her number to see if maybe she was off work.  \n\nNo answer.  \n\nDamn it, I was convinced at this point she had given me a phony number.  \n\nI woke up on the 4th day in my hotel, my last day in California.  My family got up and we started to go to disneyland again for our final day, I didn't even want to bother looking for \"Belle\" (She never told me her real name).  As we were walking out of the hotel I checked my phone for new text messages from friends or something.  \n\nOne missed call. From her.  \n\nNo words can describe how overjoyed and happy I felt at the moment when I realized that she had called back, I wasn't given a phony number, I called back.\n\nOne ring.\n\nTwo rings.\n\nThree.\n\nI almost hung up, figuring she was already at work when someone picked up .\n\n\"Hello?\" She said in her sweet voice.  I talked to her and told her I was sorry I missed her call, I was asleep, she said that she had to work extra yesterday and she said she didn't get back until late.  \nI asked her why I didn't see her at the park the previous day, she got shocked and said she thought I was a local, just there for the day, I told her I was in fact on vacation and that today was my last day.\n\n\"Oh.\"\nshe said, she was obviously disappointed.  Then she told me she had to go, and to come talk to her at the park that day.\n\nRight when I entered disneyland, I went straight over to the area I had seen her before, and sure enough she was there, taking pictures with little girls.  I kind of stood a few feet away while she was taking pictures, when she was done she started to walk away and I said \"Hey\"\n\nShe turned around and saw me.  She had the biggest smile on her face when she saw me.  We again talked for around an hour, she brushed off any little girl who wanted to get their picture taken with her.  \n\nRandomly, she told me to follow her.  \nOk, that's cool with me. I thought.\n\nWe go to her staff room, she begins kissing me and whispers in my ear \"Fuck me, please\"\n\nWowowowow.  That was the only thing going through my head at this point.  We had amazing sex, she had the best body ever, prettiest face, and the tightest vagina I'd ever felt.\n\nWhen we were done she brushed my cheek with her hand and I asked her \"So... are you going to go back to work now?\"\n\n\"In a little bit,\" she replied, \"I need one more thing though.\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" I asked.  She replied \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time that I realized Belle was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  Damn it, Nessie!

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade in High School I took a psychology class, one of our assignments was to do an amateur psychology experiment on some people or someone we knew.\n\nThere was this girl in the class, lets call her Amy, Amy was a really good friend of mine but she was also fine as hell. At least a 9/10 probably a 10/10, the only problem with her was that she was terrible socially awkward.  And I'm not talking about the normal awkward that everyone has, not the awkwardness that everyone on Reddit has and that they think they have it the worst, I mean absolute nightmarish social awkwardness.  \n\nIt was like Socially Awkward Penguin re-incarnated himself into this High School girl somehow, and then became even more awkward.  So for my amateur experiment I devised a little plan, I wanted to out-awkward her in any way, and I decided to not tell her about my plan.\n\nMy contest/experiment started a few days later when I was with her at lunch, we were walking down the hall talking and a friend of mine (female) says \"Hey, Thehealeroftri, lets go to my house after school and hang out or something!\" \n\nSensing my opportunity I said \"Oh, awesome, hang out? You mean.. like, have sex right? I've been waiting for this for a while now.\"\n\nEveryone in the hall heard.  The hall is dead quiet with everyone looking at me and her, waiting for a reaction.. or something, just anything to break the awkwardness of the moment.\n\nI stood there trying to look as eager as possible, maintaining that I was indeed serious, but deep inside I giggled like a little school girl knowing that I was definitely going to top this awkwardness contest.\n\nSuddenly, from the side of me Amy looks me in the eye, serious as can be and says \"I thought we were together?\"\n\nWat.\n\nI got out-awkwarded and she isn't even trying.  \nA few giggles were heard in the halls, undoubtedly people had stopped whatever they were doing to listen to this conversation between the three of us.  \n\nThe friend who initially had asked to hang out let out a forced laugh and told me she meant she wanted to just hang out as in do something.. something non-sexual and that she had no interest in me at all.\n\nAt this point, Amy is looking at me bewildered.  I decide to get out of this situation and grab Amy by the arm and go into a side hall.\n\n\"You thought we were together?!\" I said to her.  Amy let out a sigh and a little giggle and said \"I need to tell you something, I didn't think we were together but what you said to her really hurt, I've had a little crush on you this entire year now.\"\n\nThis sentence made me happier than any other sentence before and I decided to tell her about what my experiment was going to be, and then what my true feelings were about her.  She laughed and said that that was a clever experience, then she held my hand.  \n\nWithout warning she leans in towards me and whispers in my ear, \"Lets drive out to my house where we can try a real experiment.\"\n\nWe walk out to her car and drive to her house, all the way to her house I'm thinking \"Oh my god, oh my god, this little shy cute girl wants me to bang her.\"  I was a virgin and was excited at the possibility of losing my virginity to this girl.\n\nWe got at her house, and went to her bedroom where we just cuddled for the first few minutes, I finally realized we weren't going to have sex and I was ok with that, I pulled her closer to me, skipping school had never felt so great.\n\nSuddenly, she starts kissing me, on the neck, my mouth, nibbling on my ear.

You were great.\"\n\nI personally thought I did terrible, but I thanked her nonetheless and told her I looked forward to being with her for a long time.\nThen she looks me in the eye and says \"Before we cuddle more, I need something else..\"  The twinkle in her eye suggests she wants me sex so I eagerly reply \"What do you need?\" \n\nShe says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"   It was around this time where I realized that Amy was around 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "When I was about 17 years old, I decided that I was going to start going to the gym on a regular basis because I had gotten fat. At the start of my freshman year of high school I was about 5\"6 and 155 pounds, so about average since obviously, as a 14 year old, I did not have much muscle.\n\nOver the course of the next 3 years, cafeteria food from the high school along with a poor diet from my parents led to me putting on at least 150 pounds of weight. I became a blob of my former self which led to a lot of depression issues and also made me a socially inept teenager. I had very few friends and I was made fun of on a daily basis for being as big as two people. \n\nIt should be noted that my parents were also heavyset people. My mom was around 250 and my dad was probably 350 at his peak. They ate terribly and as I mentioned above, that was a major reason I suddenly shot up in weight. My metabolism just couldn't handle it.\n\nSo I decided to enroll at a gym, which I paid out of my own pocket, and make a change to my body. When I told my parents this, they just flipped out. My mom started crying uncontrollably and my dad went into a fit of rage, he hurled insult after insult at me, calling me a loser, saying I could not amount to anything. When he was finally winding down his tirade he said, \"can I just ask you one last thing?\".\n\nI was on the verge of tears but managed to a mutter a rather weak \"what?\"\n\nAnd I'll never forget what he said, he leaned closer to me and went \"your mom and I are going out for coffee later and we are a bit short, can you spare about three fiddy?\"\n\nWell it was about this time that I noticed that my father my whole life was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

I pay and wait for her by the entrance. 10 minutes pass. Then 20. Then 45.

Sad time for us all.\n\nThere was one last hope though, our doctor was apparently part of some medical testing group that had their hands on a new type of treatment for the cancer that was similar to chemotherapy but didn't have as bad of side effects as the other, more commonly used chemotherapy had.  \n\nSo, we decided we'd give it a shot, we didn't have much to lose anyways.  The doctor guided us step by step on how to care for him following the chemotherapy and even helped us move into a new house while he was our doctor. (We moved closer to the hospital so we could get better healthcare than at our local clinic, we used to live in a pretty small town)\n\nOver time, his diagnosis got better and better, about 5 months later it was as if he no longer had cancer at all, he was healthy enough to run around and play sports, it was as if the cancer had never even happened.  Everyone in our family was overjoyed.\n\nBack at the doctors office, I was worrying and worrying over what the bill was going to be, I mean.. new treatment.. not only that but it worked.. and extremely well at that.  \n\nThe doctor came up to me and I asked, \"So, will my insurance cover any of the costs?\" and he replied, \"yes, most of it actually.\"  I was relieved,but who knows how much money would be left...  Then he said \"I've been touched by your little boy, and me and my nurses have gathered enough money to pay off the rest of the costs.\n\nI couldn't believe it.  I started to walk away in disbelieve when I heard the doctor say, \"Oh, one moment, wait\"  I turned around and said \"Yeah?\" he said, \"I need just one thing from you though.\" Confused by what he would need I asked, \"What do you need?\"\nThe doctor said, \"I need about Tree Fiddy\"\n\nNow it was around this time when I realized the doctor was 7 stories tall and was actually a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  Goddamn Nessie! That goddamn Loch Ness monster had gotten me again.

This is quite a long story so I will just start from the very beginning:\n\nThere was once a time when I used to play a lot outside and met new friends on a daily basis. Usually I went to the nearby forrest, where the kids of the neighbourhood met up and played the whole day. Due my parents both were full time worker in the lower middleclass  I spent the whole day after school outside, because there was nothing at home worth being there and as my parent's only child this was besides the school the only way to meet other children my age and gain social skills.\n\nIn this forrest the other kids and me had built a tree house. But not just any tree house. It was more like a tree castle enchanted over a rather huge area of the forrest. Just many tree houses on different trees connected to each other. Every day I was going there and played with the other kids in this tree castle. There were three of the kids who were my best friends. We explored the forrest together and maintained the tree castle along with the other kids. \n\nIn this forrest my whole childhood was very good time, but there was one moment the luckiest thing of my life happend to my friends and me.\n\nSo on this day we went out in the woods again to explore and look for materials for the tree castle. From the distance we saw something shiny at the roots of a pretty huge oak. We got closer to inverstigate the shiny thing and as we approched we noticed it was brooch a young, maybe 5y/o, girl helt in her hands. She was sobbing and tears ran down her pretty face. She didn't even notice us coming so she got frightened as we asked her what's wrong. She was out with her parents the day before and got lost. She was young, so neither knew her lastname nor where exactly she lived. I took her by the hand and told her that everything will be alright because we will get her to her parents. Still sobbing she shaked her head. My friends and I where baffled and couldn't imagine how this girl could refuse help from other kids to get back to her parents.\n\nWe asked her why she wouldn't come with us to look if we could find her parents. She would be fine she said but she must ask us for little favor so she could get to her parents. We of course promised her to do what we could to help her out of this situation. Leaning over to my ear she whispered with her sweet voice:\"I just need about tree fiddy for the bus.\" At this point we realized she was 300 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. I was totally pissed and shouted up to her:\"Goddamn Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"\n\nIt then proceeds to knock down the whole forrest and with it our tree castle and many of the kids got buried under the ruins.\n\nThe lucky part is: I still have the brooch.\n\n**TL;DR** help out a cute girl with a pretty brooch everytime!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340461399", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

I was so focused on shopping and buying things for myself and my wife that I didn't know where he went.  I started to panic and started looking around for him, it didn't occur to me to go to a front desk or something and ask them to help me search for  him.\n\nI frantically fast walked around the mall looking for him for 5 minutes before I finally found him.  He was in a corner of the mall surrounded by what were obviously gang members, I was terrified, I couldn't imagine what they would be doing to my little boy (It probably wasn't so bad, but I always assume the worst), I walked up to them nervous as hell and said \"(son's name), come on, lets go buy you a toy\" and one of the gangsters stood up and stopped me.  \n\nWell, I don't know what to do, so I simply do what he says, he tells me to let go of my boy so they can finish talking to him.  \"Talking to him about what?\" I said, trying to act like a brave, big man, but inside I was cowering like a little girl, they circled around me for some reason, preventing me or my son from being able to exit in anyway.  Remember this is in a corner of the mall nearly no one goes, so I thought I was going to get jumped for sure, or something.\n\nSuddenly, a security guard came walking over, thank God/Darwin.  \n\"Excuse me young men, why are you bothering this poor man and his child?\" he asked them.\n\nThey mumbled a bit and hurried off to another end of the mall.  \n\nI didn't know what to say to him, I was very grateful for getting me out of that uncomfortable situation.  I thanked him and he said to me, \"Just make sure your boy stays near you now.\" I agreed with him, embarrassed because he must think I'm a bad parent. \n\n I starting to walk away with my boy to the toy store when he said, \"Wait, I need one more thing,\" I turned around and confusedly asked \"What do you need?\" He grinned and said, \"I need about tree fiddy\"  Now it was around this time I realized that the security guard was actually 7 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  That damn Loch Ness monster had gotten me again!  I started screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, I don't really go to malls that often anymore because of this incident.

It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of one-use anal dildo lube for a \"party\" I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her sex toys and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $7569.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my dildo lube to the cashier, handed him tree fiddy and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all have over 6 triplets) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He's acting just like Hugh Hefner wants us to!\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice pube hair, a Celine Deon shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said \"Like Hugh Hefner? Ma'am I'm a whiny faggot who doesn't have the slightest bit of responsibilty to have a relationship with another human being (let alone have children) and I was the one who  tried to have sex with her?

{"body": "I attended one of the private religious schools in Louisiana, though not one of the ACE schools covered in this article.  There was never anything this ridiculous taught there.  The school prepared me for university and gave me an excellent foundation in the arts, sciences and languages.  The subject of \"Nessie\" never came up.  The public school system in Louisiana is broken.  It is a result of generations of separate but equal ideology, as well as government corruption that led to the city of New Orleans having one of the largest budgets of any school system in the country, and producing a valedictorian who could not pass the state exit exam.  Are there religious zealots in a few of these private schools?  Yes.  However, most of them are merely a response to a public school system that is seen as so corrupt, so inept, and so unwilling or unable to change that the only choice parents had was to get their kids out of that system.  \n\nDo I think vouchers are an incredibly short sighted, and irresponsible non-solution?  Absolutely.  But please do not denigrate the work that a lot of these schools and their teachers have been doing for hundreds of years to make up for the fact that a local government has unequivocally failed in its duty to provide an education to their students.  I think that articles like this only articulate the negative aspects of the policy without fully fleshing out the reasons behind why the policy has been put in place to begin with, and that seems like shoddy journalism at best.  Why not decry that the state is in such a position as to need to send its school children to private schools, often at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars a year for elementary school.  Why not do a story on how the modern-racism and elitism of Louisiana's upper and middle classes and their \"keeping up with the Jones\" mentality has eviscerated the idea of public education here?  \n\nIf you really want to get to the root of the problem, stop seeking an excellent headline like \"Schoolchildren being taught Loch Ness Monster is real\" and search for the deeper context.\n\nAs a side-note: Approximately 300 kids in Louisiana are in an ACE school.  In 8 schools.  Your article title, is at best, misleading.

I didn't really care about relationships at that point in my life. My gameboy and beating the Elite Four was much more important to me.  But there was this one girl in my class for whom I've always had a place in my heart for. Her name was Stacy. \n\nStacy, in my pubescent 15 year old eyes, was gorgeous. She had beautiful long blonde hair that fell down past her shoulders, plus green eyes that seemed to twinkle whenever she smiled at me. Needless to say, I developed a bit of a crush on her, and her for me as well, so we started hanging out a lot. We realized that we had many similar interests and ideas, and we grew quite fond of each other. The IMs back and forth turned into late night phone calls, and before we knew it, we became an item.\n\nBut our teenage love still couldn't last. Stacy's parents were extremely religious and right-winged, and I, being an immigrant chinese kid, wasn't good enough for her. After an incident where we were caught late out after midnight, her parents decided that we weren't ever to see each other again. They planned to sent Stacy off to their family ranch in Montana, where she would get a \"wholesome education\". \n\nNeedless to say, Stacy and I were both devastated, but there was nothing we could do. The night before she was about to leave, she snuck over to my house to say goodbye. There were many of tears and hugs, and we made promises to write to each other often and get back together when we were older. We cuddled in the park until it was almost dawn, and right before she was about to leave, she said, \"here, Josh, something for you to remember me by,\" and she placed her lips upon mine. It was magical; probably the best first kiss any fifteen year old could ask for. We kissed for few more minutes in the park before we had to say goodbye. \"Before I go, I need to ask you for one thing, \" she said, looking at me playfully. \"Yeah? What is it?\" \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nAnd that's when I realized that Stacy was 8 stories tall and was actually a crustacean from the protozoic era! Dammit Nessie! The Loch Ness monster has tricked me again! \"I ain't gonna give u no tree fiddy,\" I said, and walked away.\n\n**TL;DR: Fell in love with girl at age fifteen, parents separated us, kissed right before she said goodbye, still think about her every day.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340585663", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It's human nature.  Get off your high-horse and read what I actually wrote, not what you want me to have written.\n\n&gt;This is so absurdly racist\n\nRacist?  It has nothing to do with the \"race\" of the region (which isn't even homogenous).  Here's a little reality check:  the vast majority of people in the middle east are living lives little different from the ones their ancestors were living 400 years ago.  Why?  Lack of freedom of speech, and fundamentalist religion, holding their entire region of the world back and keeping them from progressing.  It's 20-fucking-12, and they've still got folks living and BUILDING mud huts.  Sure, that same builder has an AK-47, but does he have running water or electricity?  No.  Is he literate?  Odds are good he isn't.\n\n&gt;...completely ignores the reality that many if not most of the problems in the Middle East come from US invasions...\n\nWrong.  Most of their problems predate the foundation of the US - by about a thousand years.  Their problem is really fundamentalist Islam and its inability to tolerate any criticism.  That's why there has been no domestic advancement in that region of the world for the last millennium:  no free exchange of information.  It used to be an area of the world that scholars flocked to.  Baghdad used to be a capital of learning, philosophy, and science...  until fundamentalist Islam took over.  Suddenly, anything a scientist found that was counter to the Koran was blasphemous, and he wasn't welcome anymore.  [These idiots are still trying to argue for a flat earth.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wppjYDj9JUc)\n\nThe west adopted the philosophy of free exchange of information.  The Middle East abandoned it, and they haven't contributed much to humanity since then.  THAT is why they're the world's ghetto.  If I go to any city in the US, England, or most of Europe, and I get up on a soapbox on a corner and start yelling about a god other than the one most people worship, the most I have to fear is some heckling.  In the vast majority of the middle east?  I'll be arrested by the government if I'm lucky.\n\nThe problems I'm talking about are far, FAR older than the US.  Yes, we've been blundering about in that area for a while, and I disagree with most of it, but that's not the root of the problems, it's merely a *symptom*.\n\nSo don't go pulling the \"racist\" card or the \"imperialist\" card at me.  Do yourself a favor and read a little bit about the history of the Middle East, and how they've managed to fuck themselves up over and over and over again.  Shit, what we're seeing now in Egypt is just another symptom of *the same fucking problem*.\n\n&gt;have you seen the thread on reddit today about louisania children being taught that the loch ness monster is real to perpetuate the religious brainwashing of the US?\n\nYeah - that's not going to last very long.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340624923", "subreddit": "worldnews", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "November of last year, I was 270. I started started keto. In 6 months, I was down to 210. This may not be typical, but it's completely doable. It worked really well for me, and I suggest you look into it. The basic version is this:  \nKeto is a variant of the Paleo diet. It's eating a set of foods that was available to human ancestors in the Paleolithic era. The difference is Keto allows more food items and lets you cook them (from what I understand, Paleo doesn't let you cook food). The reason I explain this is because we were hunter/gatherer in those days and carbs were a scarcity. Some fruit, some food. It was in the diet but very rare and was a treat.  \n  \nHere's what science has told us about how carbs affect our bodies. Carbs tells your body to make insulin. Insulin tells your body to store fat and makes you hungry. It can easily turn into a vicious cycle.  \n  \nIf you cut out carbs (to almost 0g initially, for a few months I'd say), it will (after a few days) revert to it's old mindset. It will go \"Oh, no more carbs? Stop producing insulin in excess.\" Your body will then burn the next available energy source: Fat. It will make you less hungry, and for many people, give you more energy.  \n  \nA few things to know about what you can and shouldn't eat: Bread, pasta, (most) soups (especially condensed, they use carbs as thickeners), artificial crab, burritos, fried food, some sauces (same reason as soups, but also from sugars), pizza, waffles, ice cream, most candies, sugar, fruit, soft drinks, beer, (many have a lot of carbs in it) and some other things.  \n  \nWhat you can eat: Steak, eggs, cheese, cream, bacon, broccoli, spinach, bacon, kale, sausage (some of them), bacon, peppers, bacon, flax seed, nuts (but not in excess), bacon, and a few others.  \n  \nSo, I would have 3k-4k calories in a day before. I would forget to eat some days on keto. It was actually a problem, I would have to remember to eat. And sometimes, I'd eat a lot less than you'd expect. Maybe, 2500 calories... in a week. Unintentional, I just wasn't hungry. Also, when you cut carbs, you'll realize how many calories you'll be cutting. (Note: some people on the diet do not stick to a strict caloric limit. I didn't and it worked fine, but I also just naturally consumed a lot less carbs).   \n  \ntl;dr - Keto, Paleo, other low carb diets are great. Also, I started C25K and it SUCKED initially but I can run a lot more now. Fuck the haters, run if you want. Who cares what other people say.

{"body": "About seven or eight years ago I was out hiking ya' see. All I had on my person was a backpack filled with a towl, two large bottles of water, and a few bucks. I was very under-prepared, and unfortunately I had already of been hiking for over a few hours, and at the end of my hike there was supposed to be a beautiful waterfall, so I didn't want to turn around and have to start my trek all over again. It was a long hike, and by the time I made it to the base of the waterfall I had drank up all of my water. While resting and catching my breath all alone on the bank of this small lagoon which the waterfall fed into, this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era, comes out of the water. I so absolutely terrified, I jumped up and noticed its big red eyes. Terrified I yelled at it, \"WHAT DO YOU WANT MONSTER?\" And you know what it said? \"About treee fiddy\".\n\nI reached into my bag to grab the ten dollars in my backpack and when all of a sudden this monster slapped my hand down. I got into one little fight and mom got scared and said, \"You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air\". I told her to fuck off, so I ran out of the house and whistled for a cab and when it came near the licence plate said \"fresh\" it had dice in the mirror! If anything I could say that this cab was rare but I said nah forget it, \"Yo holmes I need to go anywhere!\" He looked back at me with his stereotypical yellow cab driver hat, he was a Jersey boy. He had the gold chains and all. \"Anywhere you say?\" to which I replied \"yes anywhere\". It was after I got into the cab Well it was about that time that I notice that cab driver was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era. I threw my cash at him, all ten dollars. And I haven't encountered the monster since.

{"body": "Cosmology is defined as the study of the origin and evolution of the universe. Since atheism and deism both at their fundamental level are claims about the origin of the universe, I don't see how they aren't related to cosmology. They are clearly dependent on the study of cosmology, and the key to answer this question will come from cosmology if it comes from anywhere at all.\n\nAlso, you can say atheist make no claim about a god all you want, but that doesn't make it true. Any atheist who has actually bothered to ponder the question and come to a conclusion is making a claim. Yes, some atheist dont believe in god because theyve never bothered to ask the question, but also plenty of people don't believe in the loch ness monster because they never heard of it, but there are also people who have given lochness thought and called it bogus. There is a huge difference between the two, one involves thought, analysis, and a conclusion, while the other involves complete ignorance of the subject. To say these are the same just because the definition of a word encompasses both makes no sense. \n\nAlso deism and myth are not synonymous. A myth is a traditional story handed down the generations. There are traditional stories both for deism and atheism, but that doesn't mean we both believe in myths. If our conclusions are based on a modern view and independent analysis of the facts, then they are not based on myths. Just because deist can't explain the mechanisms of a god doesn't mean they are claiming it is of myth. \n\nBut we can't say that one group is making a claim while the other isn't. That would be like saying people who deny the validity of big foot aren't making a claim about big foot, it just doesn't make any sense.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340672722", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I upgraded my PC with a new graphics card and some extra RAM not to long ago and since then have been poking around at some different MMO's. \n\nI liked The Old Republic for a while, but interest tapered off pretty severely at level 35. I enjoyed what I saw of Rift and Aion had some neat character customisation, a big plus for me. But I kind of got over the \"Tab Targeting\" of games like this. I'm not especially good at it, I'll admit, and wanted something that felt more like I was playing a game and less like I was clicking 40 different icon buttons.\n\nI remembered how I enjoyed DC Universe Online on the PS3. It's a pretty simple game, compared to most MMO's, but I thought that was one of the games strengths. It's a \"action\" MMO, set in the DC Universe with DC Characters. Decent Voice acting and you can zoom about Gotham City. Awesome.\n\nBut now I have a decent PC, I decide to give the PC version of DCUO a shot. It runs great. Max settings and rock solid 60Hz. *But* it feels janky. Something about the camera movement and the way it move's doesn't sit right with me. The mouse controlled camera didn't feel like it was meant for the mouse as much as it felt like it was the right analogue stick from the PS3 version, mapped to it.\n\nI actually would prefer to play this game with a control pad, I did so on the PS3 and had a good time. The game just runs like garbage on PS3. Not just because the PC is more capable, it feels more like that ugliness of how Unreal Engine 3 and the PS3 have never seen eye-to-eye.\n\nI don't have any PC gamepads, but I've used community created stuffs to use my PS3 controller with my PC before. I play a copy of Soul Reaver I got from GOG.com with my PS3 controller. Same with some emulators and what-not.\n\nBUT, DCUO doesn't seem to effing recognise the pad.  I find the games controls difficult to get used to and quickly move-on.\n\nSo now I'm looking for a similarly orientated action MMO, but I'm too broke/cheap to pay for Tera. So I look at the Free-to-Play games that seem to be everywhere these days.\n\nAnyway, I decide to look into both City of Heroes and Champions Online, they look like games I could enjoy. I also hear great things about the character creators in both games, which is awesome, because it's something I definitely liked about DCUO and Aion.\n\nSO, I download and install Champions Online via Steam. I already had a Perfect World/Cryptic account because I tried Star Trek online. (Which I didn't like because it's less Space Exploration and more, gigantic rooms with a planet in them.)\n\nLog-in. Select my \"Archetype,\" the class or skill-tree I'll progress along. There's Free-form power selection, where you can pick and choose what you please, but it's only for subscribers.\n\nI go along and it comes to the part where I can start creating my character. It's not wholly intuitive, or so I found at least. I find it difficult to find things like beast heads and skin types. It felt like I had to change each individual option, whereas I thought there should be a stack of defaults, jumping off points, for deeper customisation.\n\nIf you want to play a beast man, give me a default dude that looks like that and I'll take it from there. But this felt more like I had to go and tweak everything individually. Akin to putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Either way, I wasn't feeling it.\n\nI'm not sure if it's because it *is* actually unintuitive or because there's just a severe lack of options. It's hard to know where stuff is when there seems to be a maximum of 4 options in each category. Are Wolf ears a head type? head accessory? Ear type? Hair type?\n\nFrustrated and really unable to do what I wanted with my character, I decide to just exit. I'm not going to go and and play, because I don't want some half-made dude who I have no affection for as my character.\n\nI exit the game, disappointed. I do some Googling on the Character Creator, but nothing is really popping up to give me relevant information. It all seems dated info, which in an MMO can be a nightmare. As they're constantly evolving.\n\nFrom what I can gather, the character creator had some kind of adjusts made in 2012. But Google was giving me older info than that.\n\nThat's also something that shits me about Google. Google is really fucking bad at giving you up-to-date information. I don't want search results from 2 years ago and the options to refine the search are not good enough to get the results you're looking for, simply and easily. I can get something from this week, month or from a year back...\n\nBut anyway, after this ordeal, I figure the game's character creator is just not as good as advertised and I uninstall the game.\n\nI continue on my journey to satiate my desire for an action MMO with a good amount of character customisation options.\n\nBut all I seem to be finding is, more mentions of City of Heroes and Champions online! I take a good look at City of Heroes, but that game came out in 2007 and I was kind of looking for something with a little more bang, in the graphics department.\n\nSo I and find myself looking back at C.O. I see so many cool creations I wonder why I can't seem to get it to work for me. I decided to check out the C.O. Official Forums.\n\nDown the very bottom of the Forum lists is a Costumes and BlahBlah section. I go in there and take a squiz. I see a post that was made by another, who seemed to be having a similar issue. They were looking for tails for their character, but can't find shit.\n\nThe second or third response says... [that the character creator is behind a level gate of sorts](http://forums.champions-online.com/showpost.php?p=2105423&amp;postcount=4). You need to have played past the tutorial to get access to all the options.\n\n**Why?!**\n\nThat user mentions that fucking Cryptic thought that people were too fucking stupid to be able to handle the sheer number of options, so they give you a dumbed down version of the Character Creator when you *first* play and **then** give you a second **afterwards**.\n\nThat doesn't make any fucking sense to me! \n\nYou know what's original in an MMO, when all the lands and NPC's are the same? Player characters.\n\nYou know one of the things a player gets attached to when they play an MMO? Their character!\n\nWhy can't I make my character the way I'd like, right from the fucking beginning? So going through this process twice is somehow *easier*? I mean, if the sheer stupidity of their target audience is of such a magnitude that they need to cull the number of sliders presented on the screen... Why not just have an option for a basic editor? Let people choose. Ask me if I want to go through the rigmarole right now.\n\nBecause that's what I *want*.\n\nI uninstalled the game because I didn't see what I wanted. A fully featured creator. Only to find that it is there, it's just *hidden*.\n\nThis angers me way more than it should. Which is why I am in this thread.\n\nIn my opinion, that is such a fucking stupid decision that it actually offends me. When your game is known for it character creator, why do you fucking gimp it? Especially if you don't make that clear to *new players*.\n\nI mean you go to the CO website and it's \"PLAY FOR FREE. PLAY NOW.\" there's little actual information, anywhere on that site.\n\nThe C-Store is poorly fucking designed too...\n\nChampions Online thoroughly rustled my jimmies. I don't want to play the game as Loser McFuckstick, I want to play the game as the dude or dudette of my own poorly inspired creation.\n\nDon't MMo devs constantly bang on about how important choice is in their world and blah, bullshit, blah. How about the choice to have access to the character creator at the beginning of the game!\n\nIf you absolutely want people ot play the tutorial first, then do that. Fuck make a story heavy sequence about a character who has impact on the games lore and world. Then at the end of that, tutorial, you, playing as them, mentor the person who would then become your **actual** character.\n\nDon't make me half-make my dream person, then shove them out into the world as the gimped abortion they are, only to have me re-make them when I'm given access to the full feature set... I'm a measure twice, cut once, kind of fellow.\n\n* **TL;DR:** Perfect World/Cryptic do not adequately convey to the player that a fully featured character creator is only available after you've completed the tutorial of their MMO Champions Online. This makes them cunts. Also, I am super indulgent, if not a straight up whiny bitch slut dude, who is poor at storytelling, specifically succinct storytelling.\n\n* This post is long, but it is not a \"Loch Ness Tree fiddy\" post.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340705813", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "  About two months back I would take the bus home from school. Sometimes if the bus is late I just hanged out in Barnes and Noble with my friend until the bus arrived. On this particular day, the bus was of coarse late again. \n\n  Every time we wait on the bus we sit on these plush chairs, sometimes  my friend and I even fell asleep, missing our bus.

Apparently his single mom works there from 3:00pm to around 4:00pm.

(It's suppose to come at 3:20pm) A father and his daughter comes into the store, I remember the dad buying some physics book (Perhaps he was in some sort of college?) and his little daughter telling how she wants this pop up book that was $8.50. The dad kept saying \"No, how about on my next pay period?\", \"Pleaaaaase\" she said constantly. Then, that's when the kid said, I'll pay it for you.\n\n  He gave her $5 to pay for the pop up book, that must have been like $100 for him. But that's when I caught eye to what this daughter really was, but it was too late. She said \"But it's not enough, Ima need about tree-fiddy\"\n\n  That's when I found out she was 7 stories tall and from the Paleolithic Era, she was the loch ness monster!

It is in our best interest not to kill and desecrate the world around us. Other animals do so, but they are not \"tipping the scales\" like we are.

So (and remember we're really talking about a hundred or so years ago, when these misconceptions began) people not currently in university must *ignore* the loud educated people making false leaps of logic and seek out professors to explain to them how the aforementioned are getting things wrong? How are they supposed to know that the assertive loud people are not presenting the official position of the \"scientific community\", or that even if they were, the \"scientific community\" has no place to have that position?\n\nIt's all well and good to say that people must educate themselves, but not everyone has that opportunity. And there are people who claim to be interested in improving the world and people's education, but frame that effort in terms distinctly and deliberately hostile to the ostensible target audience.\n\n&gt; The rationalizing and the side-stepping of scientific research that says that \"well we don't need every living creature* to free us of taking responsibility for living things.\n\nApparently you read about 25% of my post before forming your opinion... And you misunderstood that, to boot.\n\n&gt; It is in our best interest not to kill and desecrate the world around us.\n\nSure, who ever disagreed with this?\n\n&gt; Other animals do so, but they are not \"tipping the scales\" like we are.\n\nYes, but that's because they're incapable of it. They're doing their damnedest. There's no intentional effort to maintain equilibrium. For us to follow the dictum that \"we are no better than other animals\" means to satisfy our needs as efficiently as we can, and if that means destroying the entire universe before breakfast, so be it.\n\n&gt; You also don't seem to realize that species don't stand on their own,\n\nI'm quite aware of this, thank you very much :) Besides for basic high school education, and frankly, the ability to look around, I did a year or two of geography in university.\n\n&gt; and that not being directly dependent on every single species means we don't depend on the earth as much as everything else.\n\nNothing depends on everything. If it did, evolution would be impossible. Extinction is part of evolution, tipping the balance of resources is part of evolution, adapting to changes is part of evolution. We would not be here if the loss of one element meant the destruction of all of them. You sound like a *Creationist* saying that (ie by implying that the world must exist in its exact current configuration if it is to exist at all).\n\nIt's also worth noting that if we rely on everything, then everything relies on us. Not just in the abstract sense of existing per se, but in the practical sense of doing whatever we do (even if that means running nuclear subs). I disagree with the assertion that everything depends, ultimately, on everything else, but I will point out that most of the animals we routinely eat would not exist if we did not eat them. Cows, pigs, and sheep were bred to be eaten, and would likely cease to exist were the whole world vegan. Definitely if the whole world had turned vegan a few thousand years ago. And on an individual level, the specific cow that someone eats would definitely not exist if it were not needed for food.\n\n&gt; We are all connected, and the more we learn about all living things, new and old, we see how deeply they all affect our livelihood and our survival.\n\nSure. So? None of this goes against my point. And if you want to make this about religion, the Torah commands us -- loooong before the science had any notion of connectedness or ecology -- not to be wasteful (specifically by cutting down fruit trees in wartime) and to be respectful of the things around us, and not to hurt animals for nothing. Until a century or two ago, someone following Torah alone would be well ahead of the curve on the issue of animal rights and responsible agricultural practices. I'm not the type to make points like that, but you seem to think that the Torah commands us to destroy the planet or something.\n\n&gt; And if shirking our responsibilities and our realization that we can, and are, tipping the environmental scales so to speak, in an air of arrogance and superiority\n\nI don't understand you. It seems very clear that you either did not read, or did not understand, the majority of what I wrote! It's quite frustrating.\n\nThe way I see it, our responsibility and our realisation that we can (and are, let's say) tipping the environmental scales so to speak rests on our allegedly arrogant belief in our own superiority. Either we are \"just like the animals\", in which case no such responsibility exists and no such realisation is necessary, if even possible. I don't disagree that we have such a responsibility or such a realisation, but I believe that it is correct, and not arrogant, to also realise our own superiority. And I furthermore believe that our superiority burdens us with other responsibilities, and also privileges.\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention it above, but it's quite an important point. It actually is a question that's brought, how we can eat meat! And the Talmud says -- l'halacha, I believe -- that a person who has *not* risen above other animals is not allowed to eat meat. The allowance made to Noah only applies when a person behaves in a way befitting Humanity. I will definitely agree that a person with the attitude, in thought or action, that \"we are no better than Chimpanzees\" *should*, indeed, maintain a vegan diet. These days, there are probably many such people happily eating meat and justifying it without understanding our superiority, but what can you do.\n\n&gt; then please tell the Haredim to get on building that spaceship, because we'll need a new planet soon.\n\nOh goody. Outright hostility! And you're exaggerating. I'm not sure what your training is, but there is no evidence and no reason to believe that \"we'll need a new planet soon\" (soon being the next lifetime or two or three). And I don't really understand what Haredim have to do with it.\n\n&gt; Oh, wait, I highly doubt that most of them even have a High School education, because, you know, secular education is so useless and irrelevant.\n\nIt depends to what...\n\n&gt; My statement about their lack of education outside of religious studies is not a guess, it is a statement based on almost every assessment ever done on the religious communities.\n\nYou said that if I brought evidence to the contrary, you'd eat your hat. I'm not even gonna try, I'm willing to accept the statement as reasonable. But your claim is based on perception, not on facts. But I don't care. We can agree.\n\n&gt; Their higher rates of poverty and dependence on tax dollars is the result of widespread lack of education.\n\nI disagree. I think it is a conscious choice. There is probably more education there than you give credit for. It's not a choice I personally agree with or condone, but I do understand the motivations behind it. However, the issue of secular education is completely unrelated to this unrelated tangent to the OP.\n\n&gt; But if you sit in a Yeshiva all day and spend the rest of your life in Kollel, then chances are you'll probably not be working as an electrical engineer anytime soon. But oh...who needs engineering?\n\nSo . . . you think every single member of society should be an electrical engineer by training and by practice? Seems far fetched to me. Seems to me that many people contribute excellently to society without any education, or with education in non-STEM areas, or with vocational education. Again, I'm not advocating for the abandonment of higher education. I have some myself. But you seem to believe that the fact that society needs engineers means everyone must be an engineer, and forget that it also needs au pairs and store managers and janitors and receptionists and entertainers. And yes, one could argue, spiritual guides.\n\n&gt; Torah is all anyone should ever need, right?\n\nIf you put me on the spot like that, I'll say... *yes*. Believe it or not, however, the Talmud discusses this very issue in a few places. I'll leave a full understanding of all the sources in your eager-to-learn hands.\n\n&gt; Well, I tend to be skeptical of mythical creatures. You know, unicorns, fairies, the loch ness monster, bigfoot, etc... \n\nThe *constant* misunderstanding of what *God* means is so exhausting! Suffice it say, if you think God is comparable to those things, even in purely *conceptual*, *abstract* terms, then you have no idea what you're talking about.

{"body": "&gt;Regardless, I never said that, and I was using in in the analogous sense which you used in the literal sense here to make fun of me.\n\nI never said you said that.  I merely pointed to the flaws of your argument.  You're equating the development and progress of science (crops) and technology to Capitalism (the sun).  The weakness I was trying to highlight is that neither science nor technological progress emerged out of Capitalism.  \n\n&gt;Do you have a cite for that statistic?\n\nDon't need to.  Go pick up any contemporary book that discusses the economics and social dimensions of the paleolithic era and you will find it supports my contention.\n\n&gt;I never said it wasn't government; what I did say is that in Capitalism, an individual is free to work for whatever cause he pleases and his mind is free. \n\nYou've ignored my point.  Going out and getting a job or starting a business is not the same as the government tasking you with the development of space program.  Apollo was not the result of Capitalism nor are most scientists free to explore whatever they like.\n\n&gt;... I'm arguing that better scientific achievements comes out of capitalist countries instead of statist ones.\n\nAnd that argument is an irrelevant one.  I'm not a statist.  In fact, I'd bet dollars to pesos I'm less statist than you are. \n\n&gt;Actually, I think my view of capitalism is quite narrow. I'm sorry if I didn't make it clear at the beginning,  No lassiez-faire country exists today, or has ever existed for that matter, and the closest in history to a lassiez-fare system would be early 19th century United States.\n\nYou didn't understand what I was referring to when I said your view was narrow.  I'm talking about international and historical capitalism.  You're appealing to a romantic conceptualization of American Capitalism.\n\n&gt;but when I say \"capitalism\" I mean \"laissez-fare capitalism\" i.e. economics and the government are completely separate.\n\nLike how they are completely separate in say, the development of the Apollo program?  The education and research of new technologies?\n\nLaissez-Faire Capitalism is an absurdity, something that exists entirely in contradiction with every state of Capitalist development to say nothing of the larger realities of society.  Right-Wingers tout it out, consciously or not, precisely because it is an impossibility that is therefore irrefutable.\n\n&gt;This is a joke, right? You're making a joke. In 1861, the superiority of the industrial, capitalistic, wealthy, free northern states to the feudal, slave-holding, rural, southern-states is self-evident. As you can see, capitalism and slavery are incompatible; that's why America erupted into a bloody civil war, because \"a house divided against itself\" couldn't stand, like Lincoln said.\n\nYour attempt to re-frame the issue to portray my point as ineffective is dishonest.  I was not defending or espousing slavery, nor contending that southern states were less economically productive than their northern neighbors.  As the very section you quoted states, just because you can find material wealth and technological progress, that doesn't mean a system is good.  Just as limiting oneself to the South and ignoring its broader weaknesses is irrational, so is ignoring the consequences of Capitalism and its comparative weaknesses irrational too. \n\n&gt;That's quite presumptuous of you to claim to speak as to the purpose of every scientist's an engineer's life's work. Do you have a cite for that?\n\nYou're right, I did step out of line - but no more so than presuming that every scientist and engineer would do absolutely nothing without the profit motive.\n\n&gt;Kind of hard to indulge your love of science and discovery without the money to buy the equipment and tools that you need. Kind of hard to do any science without the capitalist's funding. Science isn't free; I'm sure you agree that it's valuable and, by definition, anything that's valuable must be paid for. \n\nA dishonest argument to say the least.  Setting aside the fact that the government does buy tools and equipment, you're still trying to get me to buy the false dichotomy that we either have Capitalism or we have nothing at all.  The resources, commodities, and manpower necessary to fuel scientific research don't just magically vanish without Capitalism.  \n\n&gt;I think that you loving science but hating capitalism is you biting the hand that feeds you.\n\nAnd I think defending a relationship where you, and science at large, has to be fed by another is disgusting.\n\n&gt;...wait, wait, wait...what? In the previous sentence, you say that funding from science comes from a demand for technological progress and that's how science gets funded, but in the very next breath you say that the person who funds the operation—indeed, provides the lifeblood of the science—is a \"useless middle man\"? How can he be useless and crucial at the same time?\n\nNo, I did not say the person who funds the operation.  I said the working class.  The Capitalist is not part of the working class.  He does not build the machinery used by scientists, he does not grow the food that feeds scientists, he does not man the factories that produce the technological wonders developed by the scientist.   He is not the one who buys those technological wonders (to the point where a real demand exists), he is not the one who supplies the wealth via labor and via purchasing said wonders.   He is thief who takes from the scientist, takes from the consumer, takes from the worker, and contributes nothing of value to society at large.  I don't need a Capitalist to tell me I want a faster laptop, nor does a computer engineer need the Capitalist to tell him that people want faster laptops.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340748084", "subreddit": "bestof", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One time, I was vacationing with my family in Florida, I was about 13 at the time. We decided, out of the blue, that it would be fun to visit the swamp, you know, where the crocodiles are. Well, we checked it out online and it seemed doable, so the next day we headed out. \n\nThe place we chose to go was a \"nature center\" kind of place, where you have to hike a couple miles to see anything interesting. The only way to see crocodiles was to go on a walk with a guide (safety reasons, obviously). \n\n\nWell, as we prepared to leave, I realized that I wasn't quite sure whether our guide/ranger was male or female. He or she had long frizzy hair, and a wrinkly old face, and was somewhat overweight, so distinguishing its gender was not easy. Whenever I had a question, I had to just say something like \"Excuse me\" or \"Hey, you\" to get its attention. He or she gave lots of information along the tour, and his/her voice was so deep, I figured it might be a man.\n\n\nBy the time we arrived at the particular pond at which we were supposed to be able to see some crocs, I was certain enough it was a man to address him with a \"he\". If only I had been more careful. \n\n\"Sir,\" I said, \"About how long are the crocodiles we are supposed to see?\" The guide replied, \"Are you blind, kid? How the hell can you think I'm a 'sir'?\" The worst part was everyone in the tour giving me the most awful, disgusted looks, as if they hadn't been unsure about it at all.\n\nThe guide turned around, and I just felt so awkward as the group began walking again. But quickly, the guide turned around and said, \"And there's one more thing.\" \"What?\" I asked. \"I need about tree fiddy,\" she said. It was around this time when I realized our guide was around seven stories tall and from the Paleozoic Era. That damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again.

{"body": "When I was a kid, my mom got me a Mickey Mouse plush toy (like a teddy bear, but Mickey) for me when we went on a family outing to Disneyland. On the way back from that trip, our car was t-boned by a drunk driver running a red light. The car that hit was was considerably bigger than ours, and we took the large majority of the damage. Myself, my dad, and my sister were able to get away mostly unharmed, though my mother died almost immediately on impact. I was sleeping at the time of the wreck, and had my Mickey toy in my arms. At the moment of impact it flew out of my startled grasp, and became pinned between the collapsed door and the driver's seat. One of the paramedics was able to recover it from the crash and gave it back to me, although it had one arm missing. You bet I held onto that damn toy with and iron grip for the rest of the night.\n\nFrom then on that my one-armed Mickey Mouse doll became my memento for my mother, and I took it everywhere with me. I would sleep cuddled up to it, walk around the house with it, bring it to school with me, basically I was attached to it. Whenever I was separated from it for longer than a few hours I would start to cry, because I'd just think of how my mom would've wanted me to have it and be happy with it, and I felt like I was letting her down if I didn't always have it on me.\n\nOne day a few years after the accident my family headed out to Pennsylvania for a family reunion, and I of course brought the bear. Some of the other kids at the reunion made fun of me for dragging around that 'broken teddy bear', and I burst into tears and we left the reunion early.\n\nThe next day my dad went to get some last-minute visits with some of the family members he didn't quite have time to properly catch up with because of my little episode, and by the time we got to the airport we were running late for our flight. We were the last ones on the plane, and they had already retracted the [bridge mechanism](http://photos.josejruiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ist2_1452862-airplane-at-airport-gate2.jpg) that connects to the plane by the time we arrived. Technically we weren't allowed on after that point, but they made a very special one-time exception because it was the last flight back to LA for the day.\n\nThey didn't have time to properly re-fasten the bridge, so there was a slight gap. At the time my sister and I were still slightly too small to make the step on our own, so our dad stepped across and lifted us across. My sister went first, then me. Though when my dad put his hands underneath my arms and brought me over the gap, my Mickey Mouse bear got caught on the far side of the gap and fell from my hand.\n\nThe next part seemed to happen in slow motion: it slipped straight through the gap and fell about thirty feet, and landed with a soft thud on the tarmac below. Both my dad and I gasped a little, and I looked back up at the woman operating the gate bridge controls, already welling up. She saw that I was expecting her to do something, but she said \"I'm sorry, we simply don't have time to get that right now, this plane is already late for departure because of all of this.\"\n\nI immediately started balling my eyes out. I was distraught that the woman wouldn't take *10 fucking seconds* to go out the little side door and down the stairs to get my Mickey. As I looked back down at the gap for one last look at him, one of the grounds crew walked over and picked it up. He looked directly back up to where it had fallen from and saw my face looking back at him through the gap, and just pointed at me, and said \"I'll get this back to you.\"\n\nAt that point my dad pulled me back into the plane, and I cried and cried and cried for the rest of the trip back. I couldn't believe that I had lost my Mickey as quickly as I had lost my mother, and that it was all my fault for not keeping him safer.\n\nBut then, 4 months later back in California, a package arrived with my name on it. This was the first ever time I had received anything in the mail, and though I mostly pretended to not know what it was, in the back of my mind the memory instantly triggered and I knew.\n\nI eagerly ripped apart the box, and sure enough among all of the styrofoam packing bubbles, my Mickey was in there with a small card taped to him. I opened the card and it said\n&gt;You wouldn't believe what I had to do to get this to you, but I'm a man of my word. I even left my own little surprise with it.\n\n&gt;-J\n\nA mixture of emotions poured into me as I wondered what sort of 'surprise' he was talking about. At first I was mad that he had dared do something to my Mickey, but was also grateful at the extent he went to to not only get me my special toy back but also to make it special. Then I saw it: a small drawstring with a loop on the end had been sewn into the back. I pulled on it and released it, and as it wound back up it softly spoke. I'll never forget the words that came out. It softly spoke to me \"I still want mah three-fiddy!\". Suddenly I looked back at the doll and realized that it was actually an 8-story tall monster from the paleolithic era. I replied \"Fuck you Loch Ness Monster, I aint giving you no three-fiddy!\" I then put Mickey on the top of my dresser because I knew I couldn't go any longer like I previously did with the doll and that it was time to move on. \n\nAs of today it's sitting in storage, but I'll never forget that one-armed Mickey Mouse toy for as long as I live.\n\n**TL;DR: Dropped my toy, got it back**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340763974", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 222, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Something like this actually happened to me once. I met a woman on Adult Friend Finder and after we met up for dinner at a place that turned out to be rather fancy (I'm glad I decided to dress up or I wouldn't have made it in the front door) we got to talking and she was pretty forthcoming about the whole deal. She needed a companion that would treat her well and have sex with her and in return she would give me a large amount of money at the end of the year. \n\nShe wasn't that good looking, was overweight but she did have a great sense of humor so it wasn't that bad. I ended up moving in with her about 2 months into the \"relationship\" and getting to know her really well. The sex was me doing all the work but that was fine cause hey I was getting laid and paid and I'm not gonna complain about that. She wasn't amazingly wealthy but had a nice house and a couple nice cars that she would let me drive when we would go out. \n\nAt the end of the year it was almost kind of sad, but she was going to be moving to another city anyways. She had her tax lawyer set things up so she would gift me the money and she even paid the taxes on it for me so I would get the full amount. But when the last day came she looked at me in my eyes and said \"before I pay you there is one thing I need\" and I asked what it was. She said \"about tree fiddy\" \n\nThat's when I realized that this woman I had been having sex for a year was actually a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. She was the damn Loch Ness Monster! I said hell no I ain't givin you no tree fiddy and I hopped on my bicycle and got the hell outta there.

{"body": "I was out with a few friends one night and we're hitting as many clubs as we can. Not in like a \"Let's hit a bar for an hour and then move on when we feel like it\" type of way, but in a \"It would be hilarious to go to one club, dance for one or two songs, and then leave.\" We were really drunk, and for some reason we thought it was gonna be funny to grind up on some girls and then leave them hanging. I know what you're thinking, and no, it didn't connect with us, for whatever reason (again, we were REALLY drunk). \nSo fast forward to club/bar #5 or 6, and I see this girl who is quite possibly one of the skankiest dressed girls I have ever seen. She's barely wearing a belt of a skirt, and she has on one of those \"bandeau\" tops, as I was led to believe they are called, but I would barely consider a top. More like an oversized bandaid. Somehow, for some reason, she is giving me the \"come hither\" look the moment me and my buds hit the dance floor. So I comply, and we have a good time grinding, kissing, teasing, groping, all of that fun. Hands were definitely in pants. Just as I'm starting to get into the groove of things, I feel a hand firmly on my shoulder, pulling me away. I'm thinking \"here comes the pissed off boyfriend\", but to my relief, it's just one of my buddies saying it was time to go. I was too drunk to argue, and I guess I was really committed to our bit.\nWell wouldn't you know it, it worked. She calls out as we're leaving \"Where are you going?!\" I just shrug my shoulders drunkenly and suggest something along the slurred lines of \"Come find us.\"\nAs we hit more clubs throughout the night, she turns up everywhere we go. She had started following us from place to place, and constantly seeking me out for dirty times. Everytime we get together, our extracurricular activities turn the heat dial up a few more notches. Eventually, she's all but pulling my pants off in the middle of the dance floor. \nContinuing the night, we realize we are fucking starving and need to get some food in our stomachs ASAP. Well, this girl is still following us around, so she ends up on my arm at a Taco Bell. I give my usual order, and she's next in line. She orders her food, then grabs her little clutch purse thingy and opens it up to pay the dude behind the counter. Suddenly, she has this look on her face that I can only describe as a mix of horror and stupidity. I already knew what she was going to say next.\n\"I forgot my wallet at Club Blahblahblah!\" (which I assumed was the last place we were at that night)\n\"That's okay, I can cover you. How much is it?\"\nShe looks me dead in the eye and says \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nTL;DR: Had my dick sucked by close to a dozen girls in one night.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340815342", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "The feeling of receiving anal. I've only ever been in this situation once (I'm a guy).. and this is a weird story, but here we go I guess. I've never told anyone this story in real life, but fuck it, here you are internet. The other people involved don't even remember it (or at least that's what they say, though I think they would've mentioned at least *something* if they had).\n\nSo I was a freshman in college and had been invited to my very first college party. I wasn't really sure what to expect because I didn't go to all that many parties in high school, but I dressed up a bit, drove to the house, and upon arrival I was evidently one of the first ones there.\n\nI was sort of confused by this because I had been told that the party would start at 7:00, and it was now 7:45 and I was one of 6 there (4 girls, 2 guys). I, so far, seemed to also be the only one who had bothered to dress up even a little (button-down shirt and some nice pants), everyone else was just wearing casual clothes, more casual than what they'd wear to school even.\n\nThe only person I knew there was the host, and everyone was gathered around a table playing poker with a couple of beers so I got dealt in. I'm a fairly talkative guy, and was making good conversation with these new people even for being completely sober. I don't drink beer, but wanted to loosen up a bit with some booze, so I asked if there was anything else to drink (alcoholic) apart from beer, and the host said that someone else was bringing over some spirits soon.\n\nWe played cards and lightly flirted around with each other for about an hour, and in that time only 3 more people had shown up, even though the house was set up for a big event with lots of food and even a really nice set of speakers out by the pool that my friend had rented for the occasion.\n\nThough the turnout was no more than 15 at peak, we didn't mind because we were having a good time as a small group hanging out in and by the pool. I ended up getting quite flirty with one girl I had met, and as she (along with everyone else) was getting progressively more drunk beer after beer. The hard liquor had arrived by now, but it was already getting pretty late to start drinking, so I cracked a beer open and forced myself to slowly sip on it as to not make her feel awkward that I was sober.\n\nEventually I managed to pull her away from the group and started chatting with her one-on-one. She was fairly intoxicated by this point, and was touching me all over. I decided it was time to escalate things, and we walked back inside. Almost immediately once we were out of eye-sight of the others we start making out. I'm not sure who initiated it, but it felt really good (she was a fantastic kisser surprisingly, especially considering that she was considerably drunk). I led her upstairs, though I'd never been to this house before and didn't know where to go.\n\nI eventually found a bedroom with a king-size bed, and we both collapsed inside onto the bed, practically already stripping each other off. I quickly got up and shut the door, but there was no lock. I decided it didn't matter and went back to the girl on the bed. Fast forward about 20 minutes, we're having sex.\n\nThen, after about 10 minutes, the host and another girl with short, black hair burst through the door, both in a rather drunken state making out with each other. I immediately panic and realize that it was *his* room, and that I was having sex in his bed. When he turned and saw me he didn't even look mad, and said (quite slurred) \"oh cool, an orgy\", and then the two laughed a lot. I looked back to my girl and said \"let's get out of here\", but she responded \"no, this could be fun\". I was way too sober to initiate a foursome, but then though 'screw it, I'm in college now'. Within 5 minutes everyone is naked, and the other two seemed to skip foreplay and went straight to sex.\n\nI'll spare you the details of the actual sex because this isn't /r/gonewildstories, but in short it was amazing... though there was a lot of fumbling at times due to three incredibly drunk people around me.\n\nAfter finishing up the mind-blowing sex we all fell asleep there. Then, in the middle of the night, I'm woken up by some hands sliding down my back. I was pretty tired, but I guess I was up for some midnight head, so I didn't stop her. Then, the hands clasped around my waste, and pulled me closer, surprisingly strong for a woman. Then, I feel a warm, hard cock touch the south tip of my ass, and I flinch so hard I nearly fall out of the bed.\n\nNow know something: I'm sort of bi and have had slight feelings of 'sexual confusion' my whole life, the host is not. I knew that he was probably still hammered and was assuming I was one of the girls (I keep my legs and chest clean shaven because I'm a fairly competitive swimmer, and also had freshly shaven pubes/ass.. as well as that, my hair looked like his girl's as it was fairly short on her). I had never actually done anything with a guy up until that point, and especially nothing to do with pegging/anal, but seeing as how well my risk I took previously that night went I thought that this may just be my first time. I put on my most feminine voice, and whispered \"hey baby, do you want to put it in my ass?\". I knew that if that didn't work I was so incredibly screwed (though not literally), but after a brief period of silence he said \"yeah, I've got some lube in my bedside table right next to you\". So I grabbed out the small pack of lube, and handed it to him, praying the whole time he wouldn't try to feel around in my nether regions and discover a nice warm ballsack. \n\nI squeezed my legs together with my cock and balls on the *outside* as to remove the possibility of him touching those, then grabbed his cock after my ass had been lubed up, and slowly slid it in, no condom or anything. What followed was one of the weirdest and *worst* sensations of my life. It felt like I was taking a giant shit backwards. But nonetheless I went with it. He started thrusting awkwardly, I assume to try and not awake what he thought was me sleeping behind him, but generally was having a hard time due to me being too tight.\n\nI nearly broke character and let out a semi-masculine moan, but quickly silenced myself. He started to accelerate, and then I realized I didn't want him coming inside of my ass, but I also couldn't roll over because he'd realize I'm *me*. He leaned close into my ear and whispered \"you got my three-fiddy?\" I then realized that the person behind me was not actually a person, but I was actually getting fucked by a 80-foot tall lake monster. I rolled over and said \"fuck you Loch Ness Monster, I aint giving you no three-fiddy!\" I quickly gathered up my clothes and ran out of the bedroom, a little bit of lube running down my leg and drove home. \n\nThe guy called me the next day telling me of an 'awesome threesome' he had the previous night, and I congratulated him, and have never since mentioned a word of it to them or anyone for that matter.\n\n**TL;DR: Had a foursome, then sort of accidentally received anal from a friend of mine.

{"body": "&gt;Something similar happened to me back in 2005.\nI was visiting my family in Quebec, but before arriving I stopped at a local bar. I befriended many of the happy fellas and it was a great time. One particular dude made me a bet on a hockey game we were watching (can't really remember which). If I won I had to invite him over to dinner and if I lost he had to invite me over. I won the bet and he told me I could stop by the next Saturday, and handed me his address and phone number. About an hour after I left for my family.\nThe next Saturday I knocked on the mans door and was greeted by his wife. She was pretty hot but older, probably in her 40's. The man quickly came to me and gave me a pretty rough handshake while smiling like a maniac. We sat down at their dining table, where I was facing the wife, and started to eat. At one point the wife dropped her fork under the table and went with an over-dramatic:\n\"Woops\".\nHer husband looked at her weirdly and I could tell from that glance that the relationship wasn't very happy. However, I wanted to be polite so I went down and picked the fork up. When I was under the table I realized that she was wearing a mini-skirt, and no panties. She subtly spread her legs open a little and I got an explosive boner. But it was inappropriate and this was my new found friend so I didn't want to upset him. Quickly I picked up the fork and went up. I was obviously red because the husband looked at me and said:\n\"Hey, w00tbear, why the blushing?\", and then he proceeded to laugh.\nNeedless to say the dinner became awkward pretty fast, and I was actually relieved when it was over. Her husband needed to go to the bathroom and this is when the wife leaned over to me and said:\n\"Liked what you saw? Come her tomorrow 13.00 and you'll get more\"\nThen she quickly walked away and I didn't see her more after that. When I came how I went straight to my childhood room and jerked off. Did I tell you I was a virgin? Even though it was highly inappropriate I was so amazed that I inevitably went there the next day.\nShe greeted me at the door, and thus began the best 40 seconds of my life. She was a little disappointed with how quick it went, but she apparently had this virgin-fetish so it was okay. We did it more than three times, which summed up to approximately 9 minutes. After that she got dressed really quickly, gave me a stern look and said:\n\"That'll be tree fiddy\"\nand that was when i noticed i was fucking gay and fucked dogs and shit after a failed lie, well fuck this shit whore.s\n\nCongrats, I'm copy-pastaing the original comment as a reply to you.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1340837387", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

As a skeptic*, occasionally I run into people that strawman skeptical positions with something along the lines of \"if you're such a skeptic, how can you claim know anything without complete proof?\"\n\nI often respond with the following hypothetical - lets say someone tells you dragons exist, and someone else tells you Nessie exists.  Well, I'm skeptical about both stories, but not equally so.  For something resembling the classic dragon to exist, it would require a massive reptilian animal to have developed flight as well as the biological structures needed to create and employ extremely reactive and flammable chemicals on an ongoing basis.  The biggest problem to this is the [square cube law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law) weight issue, as well as the metabolism required to support the energy for an animal of that size to fly, and while the fire breathing problem is pretty substantial we at least know something *slightly* similar exists in nature in the [bombardier beetle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle).  When you look at Nessie, however, we have very direct evidence in the form of fossils that the [plesiosaur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiosauria) existed, which is pretty much exactly what Nessie is described as.\n\nNow, I think it's highly unlikely that either of these creatures exists in the world today, simply because it would be very hard for anything of that size living that close to the surface to go unnoticed.  However, we could very well argue that even without any direct evidence, in terms of feasibility based on what we know to exist within the spectrum of life and according to the laws of physics and chemistry, Nessie makes a lot more sense than Dragons.  Pending any further evidence, both suggestions are likely wrong, but one of them is worse than the other.\n\nThere's a great article written by Asimov as well on a somewhat related topic, titled [The Relativity of Wrong](http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/RelativityofWrong.htm).

I talked about a fish tank where you could customize the fish and the tank, then they'd swim around and interact. You could add creatures that wouldn't otherwise be able to exist in a tank, like small-size versions of an octopus, or imaginary creatures like a Nessie, and mix fresh- and salt-water fish, etc.  We talked about \"Little Computer People.\"  Not long after that, he met Will Wright, and shared these ideas with him, but Will said he was less interested in doing an ant simulation but more interested in a city simulation he was working on.  Jeff sent me Christmas cards for a while.  Eventually one of his other programmers (Brian?) did the ant game.

Reports of living specimens remain unsubstantiated. One theoretical cause for the phenomenon is cramped living space ; young rats might live too closely together, becoming inextricably entangled. However, the normal behavior of rats, which generally seek their own comfort, speaks against this theory.

This is a group of underground-dwelling rodents who, by some mysterious accident, have gotten their tails hopelessly tangled together, and have essentially been turned into a single, seething mass of ratdom. [...] Some scientists are dubious about rat kings and assign them to the category of \"cryptozoology,\" which includes various questionable, fraudulent and mythical creatures such as the unicorn and the Loch Ness monster.\" \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341001675", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Of course, it is the internet, and anonymity plays a major role in people being vocal about it, but the sentiment is widespread and very real.\n\nOn a more everyday level, we are seeing indoctrination on an increasing scale.

While they were packing up, I went to the bank, withdrew exactly half the money from our joint account, and signed papers to be removed.  That's when I knew it was real.  Anyway, I went back and the movers already had everything to the storage locker I was going to use until I found a new place.   I asked the leader how much I owed him, and he said 'bout tree fiddy.

The guy holding the megaphone asked what the guy with the gun wanted, and the guy said, 'Yeeah, I need 'bout tree-fiddy.'\n\nThen the guy with the megaphone bellowed back: '**I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!'**\n\nBut I gave him a dollar.

{"body": "This story applies to your situation fairly well.\n\nA few years ago, I started dating this girl I met in college. She was a few years younger than me. She was beautiful, long blonde hair, sexy smile and had that confidence that made her all the more attractive.\n\nWe started dating early in the first semester and became fairly serious pretty quickly. By the end of the school year, we had decided we would move into together for the summer and the following year, this was becoming a fairly serious relationship. I was very excited to take these next steps with her because she was unlike any other lady I had dated prior.\n\nWell when we moved in together, she stopped putting any effort into herself at all. She stopped combing her hair, started wearing sweat pants and hoodies every day and generally just looked disheveled all the time.\n\nI still loved her though because I loved her for who she was and not what she wore or looked like. \n\nThat was up until the day she stopped wearing makeup. Something felt oddly different about her but it wasn't until we went out at a local coffee shop that I noticed what that was. As she was getting our order she looked at me and said, \"hey I am a bit short on change, do you have about three fiddy?\"\n\nWell it was when she said that, that I noticed she was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. Turns out the makeup had been hiding her true identity all along. So I told her, \"goddamn lochness monster, I ain't giving you no three fiddy\".\n\nWe broke up that day.\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes makeup is essential in a relationship.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341099994", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 9, "controversiality": 0}
