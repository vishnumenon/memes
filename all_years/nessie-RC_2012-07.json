So I hid in the jungle gym for a few minutes until I heard my mom calling me, \"Thehealeroftri, come on, lets eat pizza and take some pictures\" \n\nI didn't respond because I hated that giant mouse, after calling my name a few more times I finally said \"I don't want to\" and my mom got upset and told me to just come down for a few minutes.  I refused a few more times and then the guy in the Chuck E Cheese costume decided it'd be a great idea to squeeze into the jungle gym and try to retrieve me.  \n\nThat was my worst nightmare.  Not only was there giant mouse, but now it's trying to chase me in a closed area.  \n\nThe next 2 minutes was spent trying to get away from him while at the same time trying to hold back tears, by now my mom was yelling at me to get down so they could start having pizza, but there was no way I was going near that mouse, no way.\n\nA few minutes after that I was finally cornered by the guy in the mouse costume, I started screaming and crying as if he was going to stake my head and cook my body up so he and his other giant mouse friends could have a good lunch. \n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out an entire box of Fruit Gushers (Which were my favorite, what luck he pulled that out)  and gave them to me.  The actor in the costume could tell I was still scared and uneasy so he took off his head, I was heavily relieved when I saw it was a person in the costume and not an actual giant mouse as I had previously thought. (5 year old thought process.. not so good)  \n\nHe said \"I'm sorry I scared you, I forget I look so scary sometimes.  I want you to go down to your family so you can eat the pizza!\" I nodded and started crawling my way towards the slide behind him so I could get down faster, as I was about to slide down the slide he said \"Wait, I need one more thing.\", I was no long in shock, so my voice had returned and I asked \"What do you need?\"  \n\nHe said, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time I realized the guy in the costume was actually 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era, that damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Nessie!\" I yelled at kept yelling at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nAfter that experience I was more afraid of people in costumes than ever before, up until I was probably.. 8 or 9 I started to get over it. But every time my family would go to Disneyland or somewhere like that I would always stay away from the costumed people, even today I sort of stray away from them...\n\n**TL;DR:  Chuck E Cheese's is a terrible place for a birthday party**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341180687", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 11, "controversiality": 0}

How did it go? how did you know he was open to one?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/vw6rl/_/c588v1f?context=1) (xerzise):**\n\n&gt; lets say you are smoking up in ur car and a cop pulls you over. he will come to ur car and ask you to come out. sometimes he will smell the car and know uve been smoking up. at other times he will pat u or search the car and find a roach or a huge bag of shit. you know you are busted and he knows you are busted.\n&gt; \n&gt; from this point onwards its very delicate work. you just try to talk normal to him, u tell him that hes ur brother and nobody has to make a big fuss out of this. u observe his reaction to all this bullshit that ure saying, if he seems receptive and positive u hint at a bribe by saying \"we can settle this between us here like friends instead of getting into legal complications which will waste both our times\".\n&gt; \n&gt; sometimes he'll agree immediately, sometimes he will pretend to be angry to raise his price. these weird conversations can go on even up to a couple of hours. in the end it depends on ur ppl skills and conversation skill abt how much money u get away with.\n&gt; \n&gt; in short, u have to be supper nice to him, appeal to his emotions and finally nudge him towards a settlement. if done correctly, sometimes he will even let u go for free cuz u talked to him nicely enough. sometimes a mean cop will make u pay thousands.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/vw6rl/_/c58biez?context=1) (lvl80retpaladin2):**\n\n&gt; I think it's illegal to sell marijuana in Pakistan, with a punishment of the death penalty.

It's made from a series of screen bags with different micron ratings that can even separate the trichome heads from the trichomes. Another excellent way involves using butane or alcohol as a solvent to rinse the crystals off the plant \n&gt; matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hash in Pakistan is usually made from beating a pile if dried plant in a sack with a stick. It's dusty, dirty work and produces sub par hash that has much plant matter in it. It's still good hash though, don't get me wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; My question now is wether you have heard of these other ways of making hash i mentioned, or tried the resulting product from either method?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/vw6rl/_/c58d8mt?context=1) (xerzise):**\n\n&gt; i agree with you. i am not aware of bubble hash being made here. most of the hash is made by beating assorted shit into a pulp like u said, this is avg to low quality stuff. however, some top quality stuff is the one which is handpicked and then seperated before beating plant material and flower like you said.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/vw6rl/_/c58b8gf?context=1) (OoTMM):**\n\n&gt; I agree. As if a hash dealer from Pakistan would even write like this.\n&gt; This is clearly bullshit.\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/vw6rl/_/c58da34?context=1) (xerzise):**\n\n&gt; like i said earlier, i went to college. i am not one of those big dealers that have to be uneducated hardened criminals. i am more of a hustler, i just buy and sell. initially i started selling to support my own consumption. then i started bringing in larger quantities. i dont know why that is unbelievable. a lot of urban, even elite young men do this on the side. there is even a pakistani novel on the phenomenon, read Moth Smoke.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/vw6rl/_/c588zgx?context=1) (mikesername):**\n\n&gt; so let's say for example hypothetically I maybe knew someone who had some hash he might possibly maybe want to consume by some sort of burning method. what would you recommend is best?\n&gt; \n&gt; I've heard of putting it on a pin, lighting it and inhaling. Also, doing that but under a cup and catching the smoke. Or what about just smoking it in a pipe? Or perhaps on top of some fine green herb?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/vw6rl/_/c58dblh?context=1) (xerzise):**\n\n&gt; smoking it in a pipe is easiest.\n&gt; \n&gt; here we use these methods:\n&gt; 1. heat, mix it with tobbacco and roll it.\n&gt; 2. heat it, push some tobacco out of a cigg w/out breaking the cigg. mixx it with that tobacco and push that tobacco back in the cigg and then smoke it.\n&gt; 3. put some crumbs on top of sheesha (hookah) below the layer of aluminium foil.\n\n*****\n\n(continued below)", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341226980", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

If I dent a rock, it has a 'memory' of my action. But that doesn't make it conscious.\n\n&gt;but we describe it as an internal thing - when really there is no reason to believe it's not external \n\nAssuming something to be true because there is no reason to believe it's not true opens you up to believing pretty much anything. Do you believe that magic really exists? There's no reason to believe that it doesn't, so using your same logic, you must believe that magic exists.\n\nWith regards to consciousness, all we know is that every example of consciousness that we've seen is accompanied by a brain. Either the brain produces the consciousness or perhaps like you say it acts as an antenna. If you are correct then we should be able to create something that will detect this \"collective consciousness\" just like we can create antennas for t.v. and radio. But until such time as we do, it's irrational to assume that there is a collective consciousness.\n\n&gt;You turn off the TV, the signal is still there. This is my theory. \n\nYou don't have a theory you have a hypothesis.\n\n&gt;Well its been theorized by people for CENTURIES, including Carl Jung (and frued, who stole the idea from Jung I believe).\n\nPeople thinking about something is not evidence for anything. If you are using that as evidence then you must accept that the Loch Ness monster exists because people have been talking about it for centuries.\n\n&gt;And, how do explain premonition, or deja vu, or the fact that people said they could \"feel it in the air\" when something bad happened, or when you can feel someone looking at you. Science can't explain that, my friend. Neither can religion, JUST SAYIN. \n\nYou are making an argument from ignorance here. Not having an answer for something doesn't validate your own idea. And in contradiction to your own hypotheses, the general, mystical explanations for these occurrences is not a collective consciousness. \n\nLook you're either trying to make a point or you aren't. \"JUST SAYIN\" means that you don't think what you are saying will stand up to scrutiny.\n\n&gt;well it means that we really are eternal energy and we don't realize these bodies are just temporary cartridges to an energy that will be on earth forever. \n\nAnd how would this change anything practically?

{"body": "You know I had never really committed any crimes, I tried to be such a nice person and abide by the law, you'd never guess that I killed someone and got away with it though (Perfect because of anonymity of Reddit)\n\nIt was just like any other day, I was walking to school, I had helped an old man cross the road and started talking to him about life, turns out he was a WW2 vet who had seen some crazy shit, so I stop to talk to him and ask him about his experiences. He tells me about how he was a pilot and that one day he was having a dogfight with an enemy plane and he got shot down, ejected before the impact and had been captured. \n\nSo now I realise I'm talking to not only a WW2 vet, but a POW as well. This guy tells me about all the things they did to him, and how horrible it was. The beatings and torture they did to him (Even showed me a few scars they gave him). Over the next few days I continued to meet him at the corner and we would talk about his days before WW2 and the POW camp. He had a very nice life and his girlfriend (I forget her name, was something like Jane) was going to marry him, but he had to be shipped out before it happened (Note: All this is very relevant to the story).\n\nSo after a few more days of me meeting him at the corner, I ask if I could go over to his house and if he could show me some of his WW2 items, he said he'd love to show me and to come around after school.\n\nSo I go to his house and he has a military uniform, with a lot of tiny little medals on it, he was a decorated war-hero, he tells me to look around at this room full of historic items (Well, not really historic, but you get the drift). So I walk around, and I see this Luger, and I asked him how he got it, he told me that when he was in the POW camp, during the break out, he killed one of the captains by stealing that pistol and shooting him. He then told me that if it wasn't for a company of soldiers raiding that base, he wouldn't of escaped, and would have probably died there.\n\nSo I'm looking at all these items, and he (Gus) says he will be back, he just needs to take his medication, so I quickly grab the Luger and the ammunition for it, chuck it into my backpack and hightail it out of there, this was the first crime I've ever committed.\n\nI ran out into the now dark street, time had really gone by. I kept running and running, down a few streets and started heading towards the part of the suburb I knew. While I was walking, I saw a man cross the road and start walking towards me, he stops and looks at me \"Why were you running\" I look at him and don't say anything \"Hey! I asked you a question, why were you running\" he shoves me back abit \"Fuck off\" I say. He looks at me \"What did you say you little shit?\" I quickly spun around and tried to run, but he grabbed me by the back of my collar. I quickly and without thinking grabbed the Lugar and loaded it \"Fuck off or you'll fucking die, I mean it\" I shouted at him. He stepped back and grinned \"Hey, easy buddy, you might actually hurt someone with that\" I looked at him \"Why didn't you just leave me alone...Why.\" I hear some shouting coming from behind me and turn to see who it is, it's Gus, right about now I'm thinking I'm fucked.\n\nThe guy tries to lunge at me, but I react to quickly, and shoot him. He collapsed to the floor with a thickening thud, and I start to panic as Gus starts to get closer. I spin around and Gus see's me with his Luger and the man dead on the floor. His face crinkles up \"Why ImDotTK, why\" I looked at him and start to cry \"I'm sorry Gus, I'm so sorry\" I raise the gun and point it at him \"wait...before you do it...can you give me one thing\" I stare at him \"anything you want Gus...Anything at all\" He lets a thin grin go on his face \"can you give me about Tree Fiddy\". Now it was around this time I realized that Gus was actually 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era, that damn Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Nessie!\" I yelled and shot him in the head.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341328107", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh man I've finally got a relevant story for once. It's a little long, but worth it I swear.\n\n\nSo about 3 years ago, I was on vacation down in Hawaii with my now Ex-Wife Cindy. We were staying at this resort on the beach, and we were spending a lot of time at their outdoor bar. Over the course of a couple days, we got to know this other couple pretty well. I'll call them Jessie and Mark, because those are their names. \n\n\nJessie and Mark were a little younger than my wife and I, but they were obviously living the lap of luxury like someone who is retired with millions in the bank. By the second day of hanging out with them, they were insisting on paying for all of our drinks. And they were insisting that we drank top shelf. I felt a little awkward with the situation at first, but at their insistance, and my wife's, I went along with it. It ended up being a lot of fun.\n\n\nSo over the course of our two week stay (they were there for over a month or something crazy) they took my wife and I all over the place. We were going to top clubs, top restaurants, places I'd never dreamed of. Every night was something new, and every night ended the same way: Mark took out his wallet, pulled out a Platinum AmEx, and simply said \"I insist.\" \n\n\nOn our last night there, we met Jessie and Mark down at the bar as we had been doing every night before we went out. \"So what's the plan tonight?\" I asked them.\n\n\nThey gave each other a knowing look, and Mark \"You'll see, let's skip drinks tonight we can drink on the way there.\"\n\n\nSo we go outside, and this stretch limo pulls up. \"Get in\" Mark said. Cindy and I complied, and we were mainly excited at the limo because we thought they had something planned to wish us well, but I had a weird feeling that something was off. \n\nWe step into the limo, and there are already around 8-10 people in there, mostly men. Big men. Big men who did not smile. I tried to introduce myself to one of them and extended my hand. He didn't blink. \n\n\"Oh don't mind them, they don't talk much\" Mark said as he popped open a bottle of champagne. \"Let's drink.\"\n\nSo we started drinking, and I started trying to get a little information out of Mark as to where we were headed. He wouldn't give anything up. He just kept refilling my wife's glass as well as my own. I tried to surreptitiously empty mine rather than drink too much, because I had an uneasy feeling about that night at this point. \n\nSo after about an hour of drinking, we get to the destination: an unmarked, seemingly abandoned warehouse. We step out of the limo, and Jessie takes my wife and the handful of other women off to one entrance while Mark tells me to follow him and those large guys to the other entrance. I start walking with Mark, and suddenly I started feeling very dizzy.\n\nThis is where I blacked out.\n\nThe next thing that I remember I'm presumably inside of that same warehouse, tied to a chair. My head was throbbing and Mark was yelling at me. At first I couldn't make out what he was saying, but then I realized that he was explaining to me that I needed to call my bank and transfer all of my funds to him. \n\n\"What the fuck is going on? Where's Cindy?!?\" I asked.\n\n\"She's fine, and I'll let her explain it to you\" Mark replied, and then he yelled for Jessie to bring Cindy in.\n\nThe next thing I know, I see Cindy being dragged into the room by some of those big guys from the limo, with Jessie in tow.\n\n\"Cindy!\" I cried out. \"Are you ok? What the fuck is happening?!?!\" \n\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine,\" she managed to get out between sobs. \"You just need to do what they say.\"\n\n\"Ok, I will, I will. Are you ok? Do you need anything?\"\n\n\"I'm fine\" she assured me. \"But I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then that I realized that my ex-wife was not a human female, but rather an 8-story tall crustacean from the paleozoic era. That goddamned loch ness monster had tricked me again!\n\nTL/DR: Got kidnapped by supposed friends, wife's a monster. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341454921", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -11, "controversiality": 1}

{"body": "Okay, so the main thing here is that I'm living and from Ireland. About 5 years ago I went on holidays (vacation) to the U.S. Started off in Chicago and after a lot of travelling, and towards the end of the trip, ended up in L.A. Growing up, I was a massive basketball fan. So we get that tram thing from our hotel in the city centre out to Long Beach. Spend the day there doing tourist things, but my parents kept mentioning how they had to be back at the hotel early to go to some karaoke thing. I didn't mind, I got to watch the games on that night in the hotel room while they're out. So we're on the tram back, and all around me I see Lakers fans in jerseys, talking about the match that night, and how Gasol was just traded and how he was playing. For whatever made up reason, my dad made us get off the stop near the Staples Centre and walk over. At this stage though I was so sad that I was staring at the ground, wasn't wondering why my parents had these fucking stupid grins on their faces. This guy comes over and asks us do we want tickets, my dad says how much, and the guy replies \"I need about tree fiddy\". At that point I realised he was actually a couple hundred feet tall and a crustacean from the palaeolithic era. I said \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, you god damn lochness monster!\" Then Charles Barkley appeared and challenged him to a game of one-on-one.\n\nTL;DR Charles Barkley challenged another monster to a game of one-on-one", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341517701", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is kind of a long story. In my preteen/teenage years I was always very depressed with severe social anxiety. I moved around alot, which didn't help in the friend department. I went through most of my teenage years alone, extremely overweight, and depressed I'm my room. It was so bad that because of my weight and anxiety, I couldn't stand being in public, much less ANY social situation. I unfortunately ended up dropping out of school at 16, due to my issues, not intelligence. I ended up in mental health clinics twice, due to suicidal ideations, it was bad.\n    One day, when I was 18, I decided I didn't want to live that way and forced a drastic weight loss regime on myself. Over the next two years I lost 70 pounds, and was young enough to regain a healthy body, with effort, with none of the extra flabby leftover skin. This improved my self esteem slightly, I then went on to take the GED test and preparing for college courses. I forced myself to work retail to get over my shyness, and it slowly started working.\n    I still felt uncomfortable in my skin, like I was an outsider, but things were slowly getting better. Skip to me being 22, I'm finally taking college courses, have a very large group of friends. People actually consider me \"cool\" and want to be around me. I'm also finding that I do well with the ladies. I know this sounds slightly cocky, but I never though I'd become one of those guys I used to have jealous admiration for.\n    Anyway, the happy memory thing. I remember being out with friends, drinking and dancing, and being on the dance floor with a beautiful girl I'd just started dating. She had been a friend for a couple of years,  who two years previous I would've never imagined wanting to have anything to do with me. I remember this one moment, I was dancing, looking at her, looking at my smiling friends, and thinking \"holy shit...IM HAPPY!!!!!\" I had never experienced it before. At that moment I realized everything in my life was going well for the first time ever...my life flashed before my eyes and I probably welled up a bit.\n     I still remember that moment down to what song was playing, what I was wearing etc. I'm now 29 and look back at that period with a smile. Things aren't as good now, but I'm preparing for a second run at life, as I've slightly fallen into my old ways the last few years.

{"body": "Well you missed the joke. This is where I should let the conversation die, but I can't sleep, I've had a few beers, and I honestly can't tell if you're trolling or just easily enraged. So let me clarify.\n\nThe page, if you've read it, is fairly innocuous. It's a pretty corny satire of god, clearly by a nonbeliever. It is inarguably humor aimed at atheists (anti-theists if you want to get technical, which I have a feeling you might). It is atheist humor, whether you personally find it funny or not. It's also fairly tame, as far as bashing beliefs is concerned. Your assertion that it is \"in no way a public display of atheism,\" pretty much ignores the purpose, content, and impact of the page.\n\nA Christian was offended. The troll trolled. While the facebook argument (like all facebook arguments) wasn't itself important, it started yet another discussion in the comments about whether \"God\" and other atheists have a reason to argue with Christians. The debate showed that many Atheists believe arguing with a Christian is inherently disrespectful, giving all Atheists a bad name, ect. I see this a lot.\n\nThe message atheists get seems to be \"keep your mouth shut, be silent, don't argue or express your opinion, that's rude.\" This is what I have a problem with. Atheists are constantly bombarded by Christian messages, but Atheists expressing their own beliefs are seen as just starting trouble. Not just when they're being assholes about it, but all the time. Why is this? Because Christianity is seen as the norm, and we're expected not to question it in public. Not just by Christians, but by agnostics and atheists too.\n\nI think it's time that changed. We need to stop trying to take the high road while [louisiana tries to disprove evolution with the loch ness monster](http://www.businessinsider.com/louisiana-school-teach-loch-ness-monster-is-real-2012-6). We need to stop being our own worst enemy, and say no, this shit is ridiculous, and needs to be criticized. It needs to be mocked. It is our business, we've been quietly humoring willful madness for too long.\n\nSo no, I'm not claiming this guy is some nobel hero, but I don't think he's in the wrong either.

Does this mean every human being is their own faith? This is watering down the meaning of religion to the point of meaninglessness.\n\nThey have their own orthodoxy: There aren't any written rules to atheism. Atheism is only a lack of belief in gods. So, yes, atheists can say they don't believe in gods but can claim they waltzed with Big Foot while Nessie played fiddle. Not even evolution is 100% accepted. Plus, is you want to claim that orthodoxy is just a set of acceptable beliefs, government can be seen as religion then, as laws are reflections of what is believed to be right. This is even more watering down.\n\nThey have their own brand of apostasy: First, Flew later admitted that he felt tricked into believing, though he still claims to be a deist. In any case, apostasy seems to mean \"expressing opinion.\" Apparently, religion is quite meaningless to this author.\n\nThey have their own prophets: According to Dictionay.com, a prophet is \"a person who speaks for God or a deity, or by divine inspiration\". Again, it seems the author is trying to twist a word to mean something it doesn't, which in this case is \"people who are admired.\"\n\nThey have their own messiah: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Sorry. The ignorance of this is staggering. But who knows? Maybe Darwin will come back from the dead one day, too.\n\nThey have their own preachers and evangelists: Or, as we call them, \"speakers.\" These people are asked to talk or debate. They don't get paid (tax-free) to stand in front of people one day a week and expound atheism.\n\nThey have faith: Ugh. This is assuming every atheist is a gnositc atheist and that they \"know\" there is no god. But we don't hear that agnostics have faith that they don't know. Most (in my experience) atheists are agonistic atheists, claiming that they don't know for sure, but for them, evidence points to there not being one. There are even (gasp!) agnostic theists.

{"body": "I was a late bloomer, so I've only been having sex for a bit over four years. I'm 26 now. These are not exclusive to how porn misrepresents sex, but just some of the experiences I've had that ran counter to the FUBAR shit I thought I had learned:\n\n* Do not watch porn, it messes with your perception of sex and human bodies. Yes, I know that there is \"good porn\", but generally it is still with professional lighting, lots of direction, and people with seemingly perfect bodies. It's cool that you're not a 6'4\" ripped behemoth with a schlong that could be mistaken for the Loch Ness monster.\n\n* Sex is fun, and you should be able to laugh and have fun when you're fucking. If something funny happens when you're balls deep, go ahead and laugh at it like a regular human being.\n\n* Sex is not constant. It doesn't have to be a 2 hour non-stop fuckathon. You can take a break, and go eat some of those deliciously fresh strawberries and dark chocolate you've prepared in the fridge (hello ladies).\n\n* Life is not a fairytale, and you are not going to have ZOMGAWESOMELYFUCKTASTIC sex with someone the first time around. Just like getting to know someone's personality takes time, so does getting to know their bodies (and the sexy parts of their minds for that matter).\n\n* It is okay and perfectly normal not to be hairless, no matter what your gender is. Sasquatch needs lovin' too.\n\n* A woman's clitoris is not a button, no matter how often you may have heard it describe as such. If you make her cum with it, she is going to be real sensitive after so either be gentle as a feather, or step off completely for a bit.\n\n* If you shave it off, there might be razor-burns, in-grown hairs, rashes and what not. Just accept that shit like you accept a zit on your face.\n\n* Anal is not for everyone, and not being into it does not make you a prude. Stop listening to these people who build up anal like it is the holy grail of sex.\n\n* If you do anal, realize that anal is not as clean and dandy as in porn. It is still the hole in your body where shit comes out, don't expect it to suddenly regurgitate rainbows and skittles.\n\n* Sex is a physical activity, and it makes you sweat. Sweat is not dangerous, honestly. Bring a fucking towel to bed if you sweat a lot and use it. No biggie.\n\n* Pussyfarts happen. Get over it.\n\n* It is okay to have no clue and ask for guidance. It does not make you stupid or insecure, it makes you thoughtful and interested.\n\n* Sex is not a contest about who can moan loudest. Even if I win every time.\n\n* Condoms. They feel like shit, but learn to live with them. An STD or an unwanted baby is gonna feel even shitter than thumbing in a softie because you're learning to live with rubbers.\n\n* Sex is not a race to orgasm, and the quality of sex is not judged by how much or how often you orgasm. But people think this most often, so be a pal and do tell your partner that it is okay that he or she does not turn into a shaking puddle of ecstasy.\n\n* Speak up if something does not feel good or could feel better. Will it hurt your partner's ego? Maybe, but you will make him or her a better lover in the long run.\n\n* Foreplay takes more than 2 minutes. Seriously, the more foreplay you do, the more mindblowing the sex is. Don't go directly for between the legs.\n\n* Men like foreplay to. Don't think you have to be a caveman, and don't think all men are cavemen. In the end, a steak is not the perfect foreplay to a blowjob.\n\n* Hairpulling is good. Hairpulling if you haven't noticed she has extensions is less fortunate. Pay attention.\n\n* Women haven't had as much practice as you in giving a handjob, so explain to them how its done. Nicely.\n\n* Lube is good, and if you need or use it, it does not mean that she is not excited and/or horny. Also, lube is great for handjobs.\n\n* If you set out on an expedition to find the g-spot, clip and file your nails, unless you want to get on the expressway to HOLY SHIT OW THAT HURTS-Ville.\n\n* You're not a pussy if you don't fuck her like a jackhammer.\n\n* Subtle hints are too subtle. Speak the fuck up instead of pulling that Cosmo shit.\n\n* Good sex does not equal penetration. There are other body parts that feel good. Seriously, earlobes, do not underestimate them.\n\n* It is not mandatory to end a sexual act with your semen plastered over your partners skin.\n\n* You do not need to switch positions every 2 minutes. You can just go for missionary and have it be perfectly cool. I fucking love missionary, yo.\n\n* There is no time-limit for how long sex should take. 2 minutes? 2 hours? Who cares, as long as you enjoy it. There is nobody standing there with a clock timing you, and if there is... Call the police, now.\n\n* You have lips, even when you're pumping your rod of steel in your partner. Use them.\n\n* If you do go soft suddenly, it doesn't mean your manhood is at stake. Take a break, and try again, or just give up, that's okay too. Maybe you have too much shit going on at school or work to get into it, it happens. Don't expect to be able to perform like you've eaten a bowl of Viagra for breakfast.\n\n* Don't fuck when drunk. Subjective and just something I personally never do, but I like to feel everything during sex, and actually also to remember it the next morning, otherwise I don't much see the point. Also, no drunk fucking has lead me to having little in terms of regrets.\n\n* Accept your dick. It is as big as it is ever going to get, so kiss and make-up, you're gonna be together for a long time.\n\n* Do NOT be disappointed that your sexlife is not like someone elses. You are not them, they are not you. Don't expect your life to be like one of those half-assed \"storylines\" in porn.\n\n* There is an \"after\". In porn the screen fades to black as soon as the girls is done swirling her tongue to show she's swallowed. In the real world, there is kissing, cuddling, touching, and maybe even a stereotypical cigarette. Don't smoke in bed, seriously, fire hazard.\n\nThis is pretty male-centric, because I happen to have a penis, and suspect that OP is male as well.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341785928", "subreddit": "sex", "score": 48, "controversiality": 0}

Some stories are not real, such as how the earth was created in 6 days. But, and correct me if I'm wrong, there are records of Jesus' crucifixion. Even if he is not the Son of God, he existed at one point in time. God is not a creature, so he himself doesn't have footprints or a nest or any sort of tracks that would point to him being here.

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\"  I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?  I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy.  The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free.  So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.  \n\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence.  I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\nNope.\n\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"  \n\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too.  He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.  \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars.  Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year.  I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.  \n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.  \n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.  He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again!  I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here.  But I haven't eaten smarties since then, that's for sure.\n\n**TL;DR: Kid wants drugs, I give him some, sort of.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1341889416", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1420, "controversiality": 0}

I was looking at your username to see if you were someone that always does the \"tree fiddy\" thing so I could tag you and I saw the BYU comic so of course then I had to find out if you were making fun of BYU as a mormon, or as someone who hates mormons haha! \n\nAnyway, my 2 cents I guess. I have a brother who stopped believing in high school, got married right after, and stopped going. He still kind of acts like he will go back some day, but I wonder how much of that is \"I don't want to hurt my parents\" and how much is true. He's 30 now and I'm 25. My husband recently stopped going (in the past year) and I go maybe once a month. I still believe, but am in a doubtful period. It has just really opened my eyes. I have decided that I do not care what my kids decide to do. I will love and support them no matter what. \n\nI don't really have any good advice. I'm more just letting you know that I know how you feel. You just have to realize that your parents will never hate you for leaving the church, they are just sad because in their mind this jeopardizes their eternal family. They love you so much that they want the best for you. It's not about judgment. It manifests as judgment and it is that to a degree, but more than anything, it's just love. They want to be with you for eternity and feel like that's being taken away. If the church really is true, then there will be repentance and forgiveness on the other side. I think that Mormons get judgmental thinking \"*I* have to live this way so you have to too\". They want to do all the things they \"can't\" and keep themselves from doing it, so it pisses them off if other people get to. Anyway my parents don't know that my husband hasn't been to church in over a year. I dread the day they find out. The worst part is that I've even considered divorce JUST because of my parent's opinion (and my parents are freaking awesome. They're not judgmental people. I think that's why I care so much). But I refuse to get divorced over the church. It's not rational. \n\nSorry if this was all over the place. I just saw this and wanted to give a more positive side. I don't judge you for wanting to leave, and I also understand why your family doesn't want you to. It's hard when life doesn't turn out the way you expect it and some people just don't adapt well to change. Good luck!

{"body": "THEY ABSOLUTELY DID. The CIO is designed TO TAKE LARGE POSITIONS. Do you even know what the CIO was and what they were tasked to do? I don't think you do.\n\nThe CIO was tasked to invest excess deposits that the bank couldn't invest in loans extended by the bank. They did this in a huge number of ways (derivatives, bonds, etc). For instance, the CIO position in corporate bonds (actual bonds, not synthetic positions like those that created their famous loss) was around [$60 bn](http://dealbreaker.com/2012/05/the-tale-of-a-whale-of-a-fail/). JPM had too many deposits and couldn't find loans to make at a profit, so they bought securities on the market, which is sort of (*sort of*!!!) the same as making a loan.\n\nCIO was SUPPOSED TO TAKE ON RISK. THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. Just like making a loan MEANS A BANK IS TAKING ON RISK. You can't be a bank and not try and make money from extending loans or buying securities. THAT'S WHAT A BANK IS. Please. Please. Please. Find me a bank ANYWHERE in the world that does not make loans or buy/sell securities as a way to make a profit. While you're out there, don't forget to take a peek around for Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, flying cars we've been promised for 50 years, and keep in mind I've got some great beachfront property to sell you in Iowa.\n\nAll this CIO stuff is basically skirting around the issue. Large, universal banks make money off their brokerage operations. In a ZIRP world, that means 10-25 bps, maybe a bit more. Chump change, all invested in liquid debt instruments and money market accounts that are insanely easy to divest and about as safe as any financial instrument. I'm not saying that banks don't try and make money there; they do. However, there is more money to be made in areas like: collateral transformation, prime brokerage services, capital introductions...the brokerage is a way to get institutional investors in, so banks can set them up with higher margin services later. Brokerage is also fanatically competitive, whereas services with current clients are less so. So the brokerage business HAS TO HAVE a low profit margin, otherwise clients take off. Same is true if there's a wiff of trouble re: customer account segregation.\n\nHere's how large balance-sheet banks (JPM, Citi, BoA, GS, MS) run their futures brokerages: \n(1) Entice clients with brokerage services\n(2) Earn client faith by investing client collateral in safe instruments, and always keeping it segregated\n(3) Support client needs with more profitable services down the road, once the client is locked in to the bank's brokerage\n(4) Profit\n\nThis model is identical to the Gillette \"razor blade\" model. Gillette makes basically nothing on the sales of razors. It's the replacement blades down the line that are really profitable. But since this is finance, not consumer goods, you seem to think that banks are selling the equivalent of a razor with a time bomb built in.

{"body": "It snowed for the next 2 days, the first of which I spent completely inside, refusing to look out the windows. That night I slept on the couch in the living room on the other side of the house. The next day I braved the storm in search of something to lift my \"spirits\". Instead of taking the direct route up the road to the liquor store, I broke trail a couple of blocks out of my way. I met with my friend's deadbeat older brother who bought me a pint of Yukon Jack, and was even nice enough to offer to help me drink it. I told him I had plans that night, which wasn't true.\n\n\nThat night, my parents dug out the car to go to dinner and the bar with their friends, leaving me alone in the house. I got down to drinking, and got increasingly interested in my ghost watching as the night went on. I got ready for bed, purposely opening my window despite the storm. This time my own shivering shook me awake around 11:30. I looked outside as I closed the window, and watched for the girl. As the room warmed up and I reached the end of my bottle I became drowsy. Every whisp of fresh snow blown loose from the ground took the figure of that girl. My vision was unsteady and began to twist edges of the shadows into her shape, and I began to nod off to the visions of her phasing in and out of the lamplight's edge.\n\nMy eyes felt like they were spinning in my head, and seemed to trick my into tracking a white shape in the distance. That shape instantly ripped me from my half-conscious state. I watched the fleeting white shape come fully into view as she ran to the edge of the road. She looked anxiously around, paused, and locked right on to my face. she began to run towards my house as a screeching gust punctured the edge of my window. My heart raced but with full clarity I saw the look of fear on her face, so I jumped up and ran outside to meet her.\n\nShe was in the street jumping up and down waving at my window, and she didn't see the snow begin to shimmer on the hilltop. I ran at her as a large black SUV bounded over the ridge, grabbing her and tackling her into a snowdrift as the car trampled on by. I regained my senses and looked up to find that the car was already out of sight. Then I looked back to the girl who studdered \"I, I need help p-please\" \"what, is it what's wrong? What can I do?\" I replied, heart still pounding\" \"I, I need.. about tree-fiddy\" she said. And that's when I noticed that the poor girl with the soft blonde hair was actually a 3 story tall creature from the paleolithic era, but at least I had closure.\n\n\nNobody had any idea that this wasn;t a serious ghost story, and I left suspensefull pauses between each segment, people were fucking pissed.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342030625", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

Also, the obit wasnt just online, but also in the local papers for the area she lived. \n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvae8?context=1) (Ratava):**\n\n&gt; Are you still as angrily anti-Obama?\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvb58?context=1) (fliplovin):**\n\n&gt; Not as angrily, I've come to terms with the fact that it doesnt matter who is in the White House, they are all the same. I honestly don't care which one wins this time because i think they are both the same and we are going down a scary road and shaky time in this country.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvbl0?context=1) (raspberryjammies):**\n\n&gt; This gave me goosebumps. My imaginary online love was named Jake. Same set up with all the different \"people\", all seeming so real- each had their own backstory, frequently updated MySpace and pictures to go with it. Always made excuses why he couldn't talk on the phone or how his webcam was broken, whenever we talked about meeting, something awful would happen or he'd simply disappear. On the way to the airport to meet my friend Tara he allegedly got in a car accident where he fucked up his neck and his father died. The second time, his best friend overdosed on meth and Oxycontin and was in a coma, then died. He got his crazy ex pregnant and the kid conveniently came out the wrong ethnicity. There were always little idiosyncrasies in his story which gave him away, but never enough to identify him. I compared notes with a girl in Washington who was also infatuated with him, it turns out he sent us both the same picture of a cheesy promise ring he had bought and the name of the tattoo shop he allegedly worked at was really the username of the girl he was stringing along before Ms. Washington. As a desperately lonely 15 year old I was so immersed in this web of lies he spun, it got to a point where I left school to fly cross-country in hopes of finally meeting him after he had some huge crisis and he 'needed me'. Luckily Tara lived in the same state as him and could pick me up at this airport. He wasn't online for a good week after that, when he was he said he had to go to Virginia because his grandma had a stroke. After severing ties with him, Tara stayed in contact and rejected me as a friend because of him. I haven't thought of this in years, but I wonder if he's still out there, conning teen girls for whatever gains he gets from the experience...\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvdd4?context=1) (fliplovin):**\n\n&gt; Wow... Thank You for sharing that!  I'm sorry you had to go through that but it gives me some comfort...  it sounds pretty similar to my story. Part of what astounded me about it was the crazy amount of bad things that happened while i talked to her.  It seems that was your experience too. We should maybe put together a book of short stories of people who have been in these situations, would probably make an interesting read.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvdqu?context=1) (coLdweezy):**\n\n&gt; You don't love me? :[\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvf2o?context=1) (fliplovin):**\n\n&gt; Its a little too early to tell... you should introduce me to your friends via facebook im, then maybe i will.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvdnp?context=1) (deadpass):**\n\n&gt; So I would guess that this was all brought on by an actual brain tumor.

That's why, even though I never met Tiffany IRL, I ended up breaking it off with my gf because I didn't feel she should be subjected to that.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cviui?context=1) (Ozzy7):**\n\n&gt; I see.

We had a chance later, but it was also complicated by my relocation closer to Philly, making the drive about 2 hours to see each other.\n\n*****\n\n**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvijj?context=1) (voyy):**\n\n&gt; Dude just stop it right now, you've got played like a child for so long by either sick mastermind or just mastermind.

Stop it.\n\n**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/wfdht/_/c5cvm13?context=1) (fliplovin):**\n\n&gt; Well, I have pretty much...

{"body": "This is actually a story about me and one of my best friends. We both went to the same school, and at the time this happened had known each other for six of seven years. Ive now known him 12 years and we are still best friends. Needless to say, he doesn't know that this happened.\n\nSo this particular mother was certainly good looking, but our group of friends never really realized it, until one day a relatively new friend to the group pointed it out, then it just clicked for everyone. \n\nAfter that the poor guy had to put up with us describing in ever more disgusting details what we would like to do to his mother. The stories started when we were about 15 and we were still telling them two years later when this 'incident' happened.\n\nIt was a Wednesday so I used to finish school one lesson earlier than this friend. I think i got to leave at about 2.30 and my friend was finished at 4. Anyway I'd left some shit around around his house and I needed it. Like I said, we were best friends for years so for him it was no big deal for me to rock up and grab my stuff without him there. \n\nI must have got there at around 2:45. She answered the door in just a robe, and she looked fantastic. I mean better than ever. I cant tell you what it was, but she just did. Anyway I stammered that i need to grab some stuff I had left in my friend's room and she told me to just go grab it. She must have seen me staring because about two minutes later she appeared in the door, no robe this time, just her underwear. Instant boner. She didn't have to say anything, she just took full control and it was amazing. She had a great body. She liked it dirty. It was every young boys fantasy.  One thing i remember vividly was that she just kept looking me right in the eyes. That made it so wrong, but so much better all the same! \n\nAnyway i wasn't a virgin at the time, so not completely useless. We must have fucked for about an hour before we realized that my friend would be home soon. \n\nJust after I finished I said to her\n\n\"Oh **shit** what time is it!?!\"\n\nShe replied\n\n\"Its about tree fiddy\"\n\nNow it was about this time that I realized that my friends MILF was about 8 stories tall and actually a crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\n**TL:DR I slept with my best friends mother about 5 years ago, he still doesnt know, we are still best friends and me and my friends kinda laugh about it behind his back. im going to hell**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342098187", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 442, "controversiality": 0}

We were alone together at the counter (I worked fast food as all teenagers once did), so I cleared my throat and went for it. I asked her to go out with me.\n\nShe said, \"sure\". And I was so excited, but then she added on to her sentence, \"but before we do, I need to even out my cash. It seems it is a little short today and our boss will be angry if I leave it like that.

{"body": "When I was in 11th grade I used to walk past an elementary school when I walked home from school, everyday I'd walk home there was the same kid, about 3rd or 4th grade probably, who would lean up against the fence during recess and watch me walk past on my way home, it was kind of creepy but I thought nothing of it.\n\nOne day when I was walking home I saw him again, but he seemed very nervous on that day for some reason, I kept walking and as I was walking past him he said \"Hey, you, you're in High School, right?\" Kind of shocked that he'd finally said something to me I stopped and without looking at him said, \"yes.\"\n\nI could tell he was somewhat excited for some reason and it was kind of weirding me out, but anyways, a few seconds after he heard that he said, \"Great, great, I want some drugs.\"  I was really confused, apparently to him all older kids are druggies?  I thought it was kind of funny though, and I decided to fuck with him, I told him I didn't have any drugs on me at the moment but I'd have some the next day.\n\nI went home and went to the store that night and bought some smarties, I crushed them up as much as I could and then put them in a little baggy.  The next day, sure enough, the kid was waiting at the fence, I walked up to him and before I could even say anything he says in a quick and panicked voice, \"Do you have any drugs?\" I told him I did and he asked how much he would have to pay for them, I told him the first time was free.  So I handed him the bag of crushed up smarties and he smiled, I told him to snort it and then went on my way.  \n\nThat was a Friday, so I had to wait until the following week to see him again, sure enough Monday afternoon after school, he was at the fence.  I thought I would walk up to him and he would tell me it didn't work, then I'd be on my way.\n\nNope.\n\nI got up to the fence and he says in his little 3rd grader voice, \"Dude, that stuff was amazing, I got so high, the teachers said that drugs are bad but I loved it.\"  \n\nThis is the placebo effect at it's best my friends, I tried my best to suppress my laugh, but I smiled, apparently to him this meant that I was pleased that he got high so he started smiling too.  He asked if I had anymore drugs on me and I told him no, but I would the next day.  \n\nThe next day comes and the kid is waiting there with a $50 dollar bill in hand, I hand him over the bag of smarties, he hands me the $50 and we go on our way.\n\nThis goes on for the next week and I had a total of just over $300 dollars.  Then on the following Wednesday (a week and a day after I give him the 'drugs' for the 2nd time) I finally realized how much trouble I was going to get in if someone found out, so I told the kid that I was out of drugs for good, and from that moment on I took a different route to get to my house.\n\nFast forward one year.  I'm at the movie theater with my friends and I see the kid at the movie theater. I was praying that he wouldn't see me but he did and when he did he ran over to me.  \n\nHe solemnly looks at me and says \"I know you weren't giving me drugs...\"\n\nShit. He's going to make me pay him the money and in front of my friends too, luckily his mom is busy talking to the cashier to notice that her son had wandered off, so I didn't need to deal with her.\n\nI'm expecting him to tell me that he wants his money back when he says something I didn't expect, \"Thanks for not actually giving me drugs, you probably saved my life.\" Surprised I laughed cautiously and said, \"You're welcome.\" my friends were looking at me and I decided it was time to GTFO.  \n\nWe started walking away and he says, \"Wait,\" I respond this by saying \"I'm guessing you want your money back?\" he tells me that it was his dad's money and he didn't even notice it was gone.\n\n\"But I do need one thing...\" he says.\n\n\"What?\" I asked.  He says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\"  Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had got me again!  I stood there screaming at him as he swam away in the distance.\n\nSo yeah, that's the dickiest thing I've ever done to a kid, hopefully I'm not the worst here.

{"body": "Some years back I worked for a city owned park / lake. It has a concession stand, boat rentals, shelters and the like. In fact I was a \"shift manager\" which means that given the lazy ass state of the actual full time manager, I practically ran the joint when I was there. It was an awful lot of responsibility to place on just a college student and for shit pay, but I digress.\n\nSummers were hell and the days were long and extremely busy. All booked shelters, a wedding on the deck over looking the lake and a full boat trailer lot were common place. This was such a day as I struggled to keep up sending staff to check shelters, run concessions, manage the boat rentals and secure the park via truck / boat patrols.\n\nWe had to clean, pull trash and secure each shelter before closing time (sundown), so shelter rentals typically ended an hour before that. \nWell, there was a family who was dragging ass packing up and leaving one of our smaller shelters so I had to go personally ask them to leave. The main gent, a partially balding portly Indian man gave me a mouthfull and trashed the place before he left. It was 10pm before my crew and I finished cleaning the park and clocked out to go home. \n\nNow, on the way up to the parking lot (mind you, this is in an opposite part of the park than the shelter we had problems with) I found a small black bag resting on one of the parks many picnic tables. Upon investigating it I discovered it was one of those fancy high def video cameras, which were extremely expensive back then. Also inside the bag were some papers which documented the owner's name and address. With that I figured I could full identify the person so I brought the bag with me.\n\nThe next day I looked up the name and address and found a phone number. I left three messages over the course of the next few days. On the third day I finally received a call back from a frantic sounding man over his \"lost camera\". He sounded extremely grateful and gave me his current address (the one in the bag was outdated) so I could drop it off.\n\nNow, this guy must have been loaded. His house was freaking huge. Like, his mailbox looked more expensive than my entire neighborhood kind of rich. I parked my car and ran up and knocked on the door with the camera bag in tow. \n\nWho opens the door? WHO ELSE BUT PARTIALLY BALDING PORTLY INDIAN FELLOW. As soon as he sees me I can see the gears turning in his head as he places who I am. Without much else, he \"insisted\" I come inside. He snakes me through the labyrinth that is this mans first floor until we finally arrive in what I assume is one of his many offices. \n\nHe pops a squat in his huge exec-ey looking chair and asks me to have a seat. He then inquires as to how I came upon his camera. I happily tell him the whole tale, where I found the item and how I found him (I was pretty proud of my internet sleuthing abilities to correctly locate the rightful owner). Once finished he stares at me for a bit before asking me what I'd like for compensation.\n\nI said about tree fiddy. It was then he realized the humble park employee was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.\n\n...No? Okay. He thanked me and insisted I take a bottle of wine as a reward. That went better than expected, right? RIGHT? A week later I got called into work by a rather angry sounding boss. Turns out Mr. Partially Balding Portly Indian Fellow came in, accused me of stealing the camera (since I took it off the property) from his shelter when I \"rudely kicked them out\", and DEMANDED that his shelter rental fee be refunded.\n\nThe one thing I learned working for the city is that if you're part time, you're fucked. No one has your back and everything is always your fault. The man was refunded and I was scolded and fired. Remember when I said how wealthy the man must be? The shelter rental was 60 dollars. He got a city worker who went out of his way to return precious family belongings (his words, not mine) fired over his greed of sixty dollars. The bottle of wine was shit, too.\n\n**TL;DR : For the love of God, don't try to return lost items.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342371219", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

Now, I'm not a tall guy, and I was even shorter back then (I was 13 and maybe just over 5 foot 5 inches), but this kid about our age, couldn't have been taller than five feet, walks up to us and starts making fun of us. He called us \"little bitches\", and told us to go \"get a life\". My bigger friend, who doesn't take kindly to such mockery, stepped forward and shoved him. This kid fell hard and hit his nose off the wall. Bloody nose, blood everywhere. We all kinda felt bad as he started to cry. My friends and I felt so bad and tried to help him, and even though at first he was very stand-offish, he warmed up to us. It turns out that he was angry because he didn't have many friends because he'd been in and out of hospitals most of his life due to a chronic illness he developed as a little kid. Really goes to show how much more things can make sense if you put yourself in someone else shoes. So this kid tells us he'll probably keep going in and out of hospitals because his family can't afford to pay for his treatment. Now my friend James, whose family is sorta well-to-do (and he's a super nice guy) asks him politely, \"How much do you think you would need?\" The boy, tears still in his eyes, but looking much more friendly (albiet sad), says, \"I need about Tree Fiddy.\" Now it was around this time that I realized this kid was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.

[35] Essentially, it was a toy submarine bought from F.W. Woolworths with a head and neck made of plastic wood, built by Christian Spurling, the son-in-law of Marmaduke Wetherell, a big game hunter who had been publicly ridiculed in the Daily Mail, the newspaper that employed him. Spurling claimed that to get revenge, Marmaduke Wetherell committed the hoax, with the help of Chris Spurling (a sculpture specialist), his son Ian Marmaduke, who bought the material for the fake, and Maurice Chambers (an insurance agent), who asked surgeon Robert Kenneth Wilson to offer the pictures to the Daily Mail. [36] The hoax story is disputed by Henry Bauer, [37]\n\nwho claims this debunking is evidence of bias, and asks why the perpetrators did not reveal their plot earlier to embarrass the newspaper.

It was perfect; I was about to turn my baseball career around, until we noticed where the ball was coming down.  It landed right on top of an old mans car.\n\nNow, here is the unfortunate part, normally we would run away if we hit someone’s window and they weren’t around.  But this man was in his car, so he clearly saw us.  Eventually all my friends took off, but I was stuck, like a deer in headlights.  Well, I’m in a small town where all of the adults know each other, so he made me tell him who I was.  He knew my father, so he made me get in his car, which thanks to me now had a huge dent in it.  He drove me home and told my parents what I did.\n\nThey were not happy to say the least.  They agreed to make me pay off the damage by working for him around his house.  I did many odd jobs like mowing the yard, painting fences, walking his dog, and so on.  But this is where it gets uncomfortable.  I walked over to his house after school one day, ready to get to work, but he wasn’t on his porch as usual.  I knock and there was no answer, so I let myself it (no one locks their doors in my town!)  I walk down the hall calling his name, which was pointless as he had poor hearing anyway.  I check every room and am on my way to his bedroom, and as I’m approaching his room, I hear something weird.  I’m hesitant to open the door, but I do anyway.  There he is butt ass naked with his back facing me, I say something along the lines of “I’m so sorry I let myself in because I thought you may have been hurt, sorry sorry!”  \n\nHe turns around, dick in hand and says that’s okay Imapiratelol.  There is one last thing I need your help with and your debt will be repaid.  I’m freaking the shit out wanting out of that place but I was scared.  I couldn’t move.  I literally though I was about to have to suck 75 year old man dick but instead he says in a calm voice, “I need about tree fiddy.”  Well it was about that time, I noticed that Mr. Jenkins was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozois era!  All I could say before I turned and ran was, “God Dammit, Lock Ness Monster, I a’int gonna give you no tree fiddy.”\n\nI never saw Mr. Jenkins again.  \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342468971", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 5, "controversiality": 0}

Pikmin for me was one of those kind of games where you just can't let go of the controller. But the problem is, those pikmin sons of bitches kept burning, drowning, or getting eaten by the monster-frog things. \n\nWe were getting hungry, so we went ahead and ordered some pizza. Cue about an hour of trying to keep the blue, yellow and red fuckers alive for more than 3 minutes at a time. After about that time the pizza had arrived. *Ding Dong* The bell rang. My friend and I decided to split the money half and half. My friend stood up to get the pizza from the door, and paid the delivery man for the pizza. However, my friend had forgotten to get extra for a tip. He shouted over to me: \"Hey Spoonsarefun! Can you bring me some money for a tip?\" I replied: \"Sure! How much do you need?\" \"About tree fiddy.\" And it was about that time I realized that my friend wasn't my friend, but was an 8 foot tall crustacean from the paleolithic era!

I have played the previous games and LOVE them, but haven't been able to get a hold of this one.\n\nMy favorite thing that happened in-game was near the end of Brotherhood. I had been playing all night and was starting to think about going to sleep. I decided to do one more mission. On the way to start the quest, the little notification popped up to alert me of a thief that had pick-pocketed me. I quickly decided to chase after him. He rounded the corner and ran up the side of a small building. By the time I had made it to the top of the same building, he was several buildings down. He was slightly faster than me, but I knew how to beat him. I had spend hours and hours playing this game. I knew my way around better than anyone. I made my move, using a hanging potted plant to swing across the rooftops. I ran across thin lines of rope stretched across the streets of hustling townspeople below. I was gaining on him. I couldn't shoot him with my crossbow, I would gain some unwanted attention. I finally got to a point where I knew where he was going to be and I waited behind a few boxes. After hearing his footsteps around the corner, I leaped out and tackled him to the ground. He screamed and was shaking, begging for his life. I asked why I should let a petty thief go and he explained his poor living situation. If he hadn't been stealing money, his family would have no food. I told him that there were better ways to get by and started to leave, with my bag of gold in my pocket. Then I heard, \"Wait, please sir.\" I turned and looked at him. \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\" It was about this time that I realized he was the Loch Ness Monster, a giant six-story tall dinosaur from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "Fallout 3, game of the year edition, here's why...\n\nAround 4 years ago when Fallout 3 first came out I was in 8th grade and my cousin was a senior in High School. \n\nDuring a family reunion I went into his room and he was playing the Playstation 3, he was a bit of a loner, even in the family so I knew he wouldn't talk to me.  I looked over to see what game he was playing.  It was a game I'd never really seen before.. was it in the call of duty series? Medal of honor? Maybe a new series?  He never said a word to me, but he played the game for 5 hours,all with me watching him play it.\n\nI finally got the nerve to speak up, \"What game are you playing\" I asked, as he was ejecting the disk from the PS3. He said nothing.  He simply put the game in its case and handed me the case.\n\nFallout 3.\n\nAs I was looking at the game my parents called to say that we were going home, as I was exiting his room he said, \"I play that game all day, it's a pretty new game, if you want to come over and watch me play again you can.\"\n\nAnd so began our tradition of me going to his house to watch him play Fallout 3.\n\nThis continued for months.  Me and him because sort of the best of friends even though our age difference,  every family get-together we'd rush to his room and play Fallout 3 for endless hours.  We beat the game several times in those months.\n\nOne day I went to his house and knocked on his door.  His mom answered the door crying her eyes out,  I was shocked because I'd never ever seen her so sad, I'd never even seen her cry.\n\nI asked what was wrong and she said that my cousin couldn't play today.  Disappointed I walked home, wondering what would have made her cry.\n\nLater that evening I found out.  My cousin had been with a group of friends who had been drinking.  They had tried to drive home and ended up driving into a ditch.  The driver was killed, my cousin was in the passenger seat and he was in the hospital, the girl in the back was paralyzed and also in the hospital.\n\nThe next day I went to the hospital, crying my eyes out because I genuinely cared for my cousin now, and not just for Fallout 3.  That game really made us connect though.  The doctors said that my cousin was not expected to live, internal damage had been far too bad.  \n\nAs my cousin lay dying on the hospital bed, he motioned me to come over.  He said, \"I need you to promise me something if I die.\"  Tears streaming down my eyes I said, \"I will promise anything.\" he told me, \"I want you to go down to the store and buy yourself a copy of Fallout 3, beat that game multiple times over for me, just like we did back at my house.\" I nodded and promised him I would. I started to walk out of the room when he said, \"Wait, I need something else.\" \"What do you need?\" I asked.  \"I need about Tree Fiddy\"  It was around this time I realized that my cousin was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  That damned loch ness monster had gotten me again!  I said, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy\"\n\nBut in the end, I never did get around to buying that Fallout 3 game.

{"body": "&gt; Would you like to have to option to have them attend a different school without requiring you to move to a different neighborhood? Or to have the option to move to a different neighborhood without requiring you children to change schools?\n\nThis gets into tricky areas.  \n\nOn one hand, I understand why it is that they want to keep people at schools.  It prevents overflowing one school because another has a bad reputation (and other things).  However, on the flip side a parent should have the option to choose a school in their area (within reason).  \n\nThat said however, there's a big difference between having issues with a school due to violence, poor staff, or other such reasons... and being insistent that a child is taught the world is 6000 years old.\n\nAll of the schools should be teaching *essentially* identical information which is based on the consensus of experts in the fields being taught.  Any school that uses books saying the Loch Ness Monster is proof of creationism (I wish I was joking) has no business getting funding from the government.  They're not educating children, they're programming and indoctrinating them with lies.\n\nThat's more what I'm getting at.  Personally I think that a person should be able to take their kids to any local school (within reason and with limitations to prevent overcrowding).  The problem is multi-layered though when it comes to reasons parents would want to avoid a school.\n\nTake gangs for example.  That's a reason I'd want to pull a kid from a school.  However, if all of the students of the school move to another school that doesn't fix the issue, it simply makes the second school worse by introducing the same issue there.  I think there needs to be better and more effective systems in place to stamp out the issues in the first place.

Faecal matter collides into the autorotary device and the SWAT team rains down on us like The Weather Girls' hit single.  We're ducking behind cover trying to stay alive while keeping the drills running.  The drills, of course, break down like a fat kid's self esteem after being picked last for the team.  I'm running up and down the bridge trying to keep the drills going and the SWAT team just spiderman their asses up to the bridge.\n\nFirst convoy. Nope, just a bunch of orange jumpsuits.  Second truck: nope. Third truck: Nope.  Finally, the fourth truck is busted open and inside is the prisoner we're supposed to heist. \n\nI keep hitting \"f\" to tell him to mush like a pack of sled dogs.  He's running with me and my pack now, trying to make it to the other end of the bridge.  SWAT teams keeps firing at us and we're pinned down, but I knew we had to keep moving.  The damn prisoner is too pussy to move so he stays crouched behind cover.  I spam \"f\" again to get his ass moving.  Me and my buddies are all in the red now and our ammo is running low.  No one had the foresight to bring a doctor bag so we're just sitting ducks.\n\n\"We're not going to make it,\" my friend said with a hint of defeat in his voice.  When it looked like we would fail the mission and the SWAT would swarm us, the prisoner decides to run up to me and asked, \"I  need about tree fiddy.\"  It was at that point I realized he was a giant Chinese crustacean from the paleolithic era.  With the SWAT on our ass, I yelled back \"I ain't giving you no treefiddy you goddam Loch Ness monster!

{"body": "I was an introvert mostly throughout High School.  I didn't go to many parties, nor did I have many friends, but for some reason I always found myself in situations in which I could potential hook up with a girl I liked.  \n\nUnfortunately, I had 0 skills on picking up girls even though I was trying really hard to get a girl.  \n\nIn 11th grade there was a party around my school's christmas break, my closest friend at the time invited me to it.  I was reluctant to go, but I eventually agreed.  \n\nI don't remember the exact date, but I went to the party and there was this girl that I'd seen before but couldn't really tell where.  I still remembered her name though, Vanessa.  She was pretty cute and I eventually convinced myself to make a move on her.\n\nI stood there for a second, watching her, planning a way to get her to be interested in me.  I couldn't come up with a plan, so I decided to just walk up to her and see what happens.\n\nI walk up to her and say, \"Hey.\" in the most seductive voice possible.  She looks at me, smiles and says \"hey\" back.  I decide to engage in conversation and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is, \"Disneyland must have a lot of pedophiles, don't you think?\"\n\nShit. I had said one of the strangest things my brain could think of.  Vanessa stood there for a bit confused, but to my surprise Vanessa started laughing and said, \"You're funny, I like funny guys.\" \n\nI started saying more things.\n\nShe laughed even more.\n\nI started getting excited, for the first time in my life I had gotten a girl.  But then it dawned on me.  I knew I recognized Vanessa from somewhere and I finally remembered where.  A strip club.  Vanessa was a stripper.  Me and the close friend I mentioned earlier had snuck past bouncers about a year ago and got into a strip club which was pretty risky since we were under 18.  \n\nI got kind of sweaty for a moment as I realized not only was Vanessa a stripper, but she was also much older than me obviously.  My little virgin self at the time could not take in these two thoughts at once.  I began to get a little awkward, but still, she laughed at me and thought I was just funny.\n\nAfter another few minutes of conversing she said to me, \"Hey, I know the host of this party, do you want to get a room?\"  \n\nInside I was squealing with excitement, but on the outside I played it cool and just said, \"Sure.\"\n\nA few minutes later we were making out in a bedroom in the house.  This was the first time I had ever actually made out with a girl, I had kissed girls before, but I'd never actually used tongue.  I was ecstatic, I didn't know what to do but I guess I wasn't doing too bad since Vanessa seemed to be enjoying herself.\n\nThen the most nervous moment of my life came.\n\n\"Do you have a condom?\" Vanessa asked me.\n\nI stuttered a bit and said no, she looked disappointed but got out her phone and called someone.  A few minutes later we were interrupted in our make out session by the host of the party, who supplied us with condoms.  I was so nervous/anxious that I could barely keep up the act of playing it cool on the outside.\n\nThe next part might get kind of graphic, so... yeah, just a fair warning.\n\nIn the next minute I had put on the condom and was starting to take off Vanessa's clothes.  Finally, she was fully naked, as was I.  She got up from laying down for a second and turned her back towards me, she wanted doggy style I guess.  \n\nBefore I put my dick in her she said, \"wait\".  Kind of annoyed by the sudden stop, I said, \"What?\" Without looking at me she said, \"Put it in slowly, I'm actually a virgin.\"  I couldn't believe it.  This girl who was older than me, a stripper, and had been extremely aggressive was a virgin.  I still can't believe it.  I asked her if she was serious because I was in shock.  She said she was serious, she was looking to lose it tonight and she didn't care whom she lost it to.  I told her I was a virgin too and she said good.  As I was putting it in she said, \"Wait, I need one more thing..\"  \"What do you need?\" I asked.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that Vanessa was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  \"Damnit Loch Ness monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I said to her as she swam away into the distance.\n\nBut that was one of the craziest nights of my life.  Been waiting for awhile for someone to post a question like this to askreddit for a long time now.  Happy I finally got the chance to tell that story.\n\ntl;dr: A stripper who aggressively threw herself on to me was actually a virgin.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342666406", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 316, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**EDIT: I finished the story. I hope you like it.**\n\nI teach English at a local high school. One year, I had a female student who would always make passes at me. She would compliment my clothes, tell me I'm her favourite teacher, touch me in flirtatious ways, give me the eye, etc. Everyone knew she liked me.\n\nI enjoyed it, but I never made any attempt to get with her. She was my student. I mean, I wanted to. She had gorgeous blue eyes, wide hips, a slim waist, a round butt, and very nice breasts. She would wear low-cut shirts and short shorts all the time. Guys liked her and she was popular. That kind of girl. But still, she was my student, so I never did anything to her.\n\nThe day after she graduated, she came into my classroom and told me that she wanted to thank me for being her favourite teacher. I told her she was welcome, and that I wished her all the success. But then she said, \n\n\"No, I want to really thank you.\"\n\nWhoah boy. That made me a little bit excited. But she was my student. My mind wanted me to tell her off, but all I could manage to say was,\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nThen she stood up from the chair across from my desk and stood next to me. She looked me right in the eyes with a coy smile, grabbed my chin and kissed me quickly. Then she took out a piece of paper and stuffed it in my pocket. I was flabbergasted at the whole thing. I can still remember her tight black shirt, and the way it stretched over the outline of her bra. She said,\n\n\"You know what I mean.\"\n\nAnd then she left.\n\nI took the paper out and found her phone number on it, with \"text me.\"\n\nI texted her. I mean, I didn't want to. She was my student. But at the same time, I really, really wanted to. One thing led to another, and a few days later she was at my apartment. She was wearing a v-neck t-shirt that was a bit too small for her, as well as a short skirt like an anime schoolgirl. The shirt, once again, showed the outline of her bra clearly, and I think the bra was a little too small, too, because her breasts were bulging out of it noticably. They were pressed together in the middle, forming a neat line of her cleavage. The bottom of the shirt exposed a little bit of her panties, which were higher than her skirt. Her freshly shaven legs came down gracefully from her skirt, and her hair was like silk, draped over one shoulder.\n\nI couldn't imagine how her parents let her leave the house like that, but I was very glad they did. I told her to have a seat, and gestured toward the couch. She said, sadly, that she didn't want to sit there, and instead sat right on my leg.\n\n\"Whoah, aren't you taking this a little bit fast?\"\n\n\"Nope. I've wanted you for too long.\"\n\nBefore I could say anything, she pressed her mouth against mine and put her arms around my neck. I started pitching a tent pretty much right away, what with this smoking-hot 18 year old on my lap. I figured it couldn't hurt to go along with it, so I put my arms around her lower back, scooted forward a little and pulled her toward me. She stopped kissing me for a moment and moved away long enough to swing her smooth right leg around me. She settled herself right on top of my crotch. Her legs being spread apart pulled her skirt up enough to reveal her pink panties. They had thicker fabric on the bottom, covered on the outside with lace.\n\nHer tongue flicked playfully at my lips, and I responded equally with mine, entering the inside of her mouth a little more, bit by bit, until we were having an oral war. I put one hand on each of her cheeks and squeezed them firmly. She responded by convulsing a little, arching her back a little and thrusting her pelvis almost imperceptibly.\n\nI took my face away from hers, and she wiped her mouth. I picked her up, with one hand on her juicy butt and the other on the small of her back. Luckily, she wasn't a large-framed girl. I carried her to my bed and layed her down on it, then took my shirt off. She pressed her legs together in anticipation and bit her lip, and in seconds I was on top of her, with our lips pressed together once again. I moved my mouth down to her neck, kissing it gently and sucking on it. Her breathing quickened a little as I moved down to her breasts, kissing the tight skin on her bosom as she grasped at my back hungrily. I began to put one hand up her shirt, and I gently stroked her stomach over where her kidneys are, and her abdomen quivered reflexively. I put my other hand up her shirt, took my head away and put one hand on each side of her rib cage. She sat up a little, her toned stomach muscles standing out in a vertical band as they pulled her torso upward. I pulled her up into a sitting position, and she pulled her shirt off over her head, exposing her supple breasts which begged me to release them. I reached around back of her and unhooked her bra. Mildly surprised, she cupped her hands over her bra so it wouldn't fall off, but I persisted, slipped the straps over her shoulders and pulled her hands away. Her perky, round breasts were freed from their undersized prison, and her small pink nipples beckoned to me. I pushed her back down firmly, spread her legs apart to make room for me and put my head back down onto her chest. I flicked her right nipple with my tongue and sucked on it while stroking the other one with my index finger. With my free hand, I fondled her left butt cheek, then moved down her leg. As I did so, she wrapped both of her legs around me, then took her hands and ran them down my bare chest. They weren't long enough to reach my pants, so as soon as both of her nipples were hard, I sat up a little and began taking them off. She waited in anticipation for a moment before putting her left hand down between her legs and pressing on her crotch a little. I pulled my pants down a little, which was no easy task because of the hard erection I was sporting, but it was worth it as she sat up again and started rubbing it.\n\nWhile she rubbed my throbbing man-stick, through the fabric of my underwear, I put my left arm around her shoulders and pulled her into another kiss. She pulled my cock out and started properly stroking it, but I didn't let her go far, because I then picked her up a little and moved her further onto the bed so that I could pull off her skirt and underwear. I excised my penis from my fly and pulled off my boxers, then looked down and saw her vagina, already fully open and primed. I couldn't resist, and I mounted her. She moaned as I broke the surface of her delicate vulva, and put her calves on my shoulders. With my hands on her thighs, I pushed forward. My hard penis filled her entirely. I managed to thrust three times. With the wet, convoluted insides of her tight vaginal canal rubbing my shaft like the hands of angels, looking at her pretty face distort and her perfect breasts shake, I couldn't help but to ejaculate after that. She was just too perfect. A disappointed look fell on her face as she watched me pull out. I saw the semen spill out of her like a small, slow waterfall. My heart racing still, I laid myself down next to her.\n\nAfter a few seconds, surprisingly, I was still erect. I looked at her and saw her eyeing my genitals. She then got up and got on top of me. She took her mouth and cleaned the fluids off of my meat, replacing them carefully with her saliva. When she was done, she held it in her hand and oriented her pelvis over it. She put herself on it. Her hole still had my cum inside. She plunged my cock into her and sat down, biting her lower lip and closing her eyes. Slowly, she moved her hips up and down, letting me penetrate her sensually, then gradually got more and more into it. She sped up and made each stroke longer, shaking the bed vigorously. With her hands on the back of her head, her back straight as a board, she looked up at the ceiling and moaned a little. That moan gradually turned into her yelling pure animal noises. She was screaming as she fell forward. She moved forward and backward more slowly, and her breasts waved back and forth over my chest. Invigorated by them, I grabbed her and pressed her chest against me. Her firm, warm body drove me crazy and enveloped my lust. I started moving my hips fast and hard, and I started another war with my tongue. She moaned into my mouth until she had to surrender, then she just dropped her head onto my shoulder and screamed. I thrusted over and over, then had the brilliant idea to start stroking her anus. Her entire body convulsed and her vagina tightened as she orgasmed. The added tightness drained every last bit of semen and energy from me, and we both stopped. She laid on top of me, panting, her pale skin shining.\n\nAt that moment, I started wondering how she would get home. She told me she planned on taking the bus, and that she would need about tree fiddy for fare. It was about that time that I noticed she was a three story tall aquatic beast from the depths of Loch Ness.\n\n\"Get out of here, Loch Ness Monster!\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe left.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342867296", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 119, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was a little kid, about 8 years old, I used to go to my grandparent's house after school was over to wait for me parent to pick me up there. They lived near the school so that was the easiest solution.\n\nBeing a young kid, I was never impressed with my grandfather since he was old and didn't necessarily have the energy to spend it running around with little me. I saw this as insulting since he didn't want to play with his grand child. Kids can be douchey like that.\n\nAnyway this one day after school I was sitting at the kitchen table and eating my after school snack when he decided to tell me a little story. I remember him starting it with \"you know grandpa wasn't always this old\". \n\nAfter that he went on and on. The things my grandfather did in his time that I had no sweet clue about were amazing. He had been a policeman in his early 20s and had been shot in the chest. He spent a few weeks in a coma and doctors thought he would never wake, he did. \n\nAfter his time with the police force, he went to school and became a successful lawyer. He spent 30 years in the courtroom and brought justice to many people. He showed me many clippings of articles that detailed his great actions and how he helped clients for free just to see them get their day in court. \n\nIt was then I realized my grandfather was a truly great man. I appreciated him in a new light. So when he was all done his stories he asked me one final thing, \"now that you know all this about gramps, I have one more thing to ask... I have to buy more soda at the store but am a little short, can you spare about tree fiddy?\"\n\nWell it was around this time that I realized that my grand father was actually about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "Well there was only one kid that I can truly say fell for me. I was teaching calculus AB for grade 12 students. She was a bright student who was near the top of her class, always turned in her work on time, and always on time to class. Especially mine, sometimes arriving 15-20 minutes early (It was the first period of the day, normally kids would just get there around 5 minutes before). \n\nNow I had a couple of other students come in early for tutoring, but this girl would come in early just to try and strike up a conversation with me. Nearly every day, without fail, she would be there in the morning to talk to me. Now I'm not going to lie, it was nice to be able to talk to someone.  I was 31, unmairried, and It was nice to be able to talk to someone every day. \n\nThen it started, not so random brushing past me, touching me on the shoulders, my arms. It felt great to get attraction from someone, even if it was a student. I knew it was wrong to enjoy it, but I did. None of the other students realized our kind of mini relationship that we had, and it was going great. \n\nI knew she was 18, and it was nearing the end of the semester, the end of the year. And I grew anxious, should I pursue this?? This was insane questioning myself like this. She was a student. But the next day before class i asked the most daring question I had ever asked in my life. I asked her to come in after her last period for some extra 'tutoring'. She immediately agreed, and I was overcome with joy. The class period passed as we shot each other glances from across the room. The bell rang, and she shot me one more look before leaving the room.\n\nThroughout the day my heart was racing, pounding in my chest, I couldn't wait for the final period to come to a close. When it finally rang it was as if time slowed to a crawl. I waited ten, fifteen, twenty minutes. When I heard the knob on my door turn, and open as she stepped in the room. She turned away and turned the lock on the door. I immediately stood up and started to walk across the room, as if I was walking in clouds. We embraced, and it was everything I had dreamt of, the warmth of her body, she silence of the room. It was the worst thing I had ever done, yet it felt so right. She started to unbutton her blouse, and I could feel feeling in my pants that I hadn't felt in so long. She pulled me closer and whispered in my ear \"I know this is wrong, so so wrong-\" I told her it was okay, it was mean to be, but she cut me off, and whispered in my ear, \"- but I'm gonna need 'bout tree fiddy.\" \n\nI reared back, and this girl was actually a nine story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era! How had I not seen it before!? I yelled at her \"I ain't giving you no tree fiddy you goddamn lock ness monster!

{"body": "My grandfather did a lot of things in his life. Truckdriver, repoman, mafia work, and other assorted manly things. My grandfather left a legacy, not a particularly good one though in Navarro Country, Texas. My mom, uncles, and any one else unfortunate enough to bear the surname of Andrews is not taken kindly there. My grandfather was tough as nails, he didn't take any bullshit. But one story of his stands out.\n\n\nDuring the summer of 77 my grandfather was working as a repoman in Corsicana, a town in Navarro County. Now mind you this is in a small hick Texas town, so guns are abundant. To protect himself my grandfather always carried around a revolver when he went to repo \ncars. One day he was called by his boss and given the address of a truck that needed to be picked up. My grandfather, Richard, followed through with the request. He went to the house, hitched the truck onto his truck. It was at this time a black man came out of the house with a shotgun. He pointed it at Richard, telling him to unhitch the truck and leave. Richard told him he would, but he'd have to lower his weapon. Right as the man lowered his shotgun, Richard drew him revolver and shot the man. My grandfather was incredibly racist by the way. Had this man been white, he probably wouldn't have shot him. As this man laid in his driveway with the life draining out of him, his son, who looked around 8, ran out of the house. The boy found his father, dying on the pavement. He fell to his knees and begged his father not to go, he asked God to give his father another chance. Richard walked over to the boy and asked if he had anywhere to go and if he needed anything from the house before they left. The boy, with tears running down his face, looked Richard in the eyes and said \"I need.... I need about tree fiddy\" It was at this time Richard realized the boy was 500 feet tall and from the Paleolithic era.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**TL;DR: GRANDFATHER KILLS A MAN, HIS SON WATCHES THE ENTIRE THING**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1342895465", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Looks in very good shape for one of those, even with a bit of the blue flaking. Doing anything to restore or refinish a collectible firearm basically destroys its value, so leave the finish as is. \n\nIt is chambered for the .38 S&amp;W cartridge, not the .38 Special. Should be shootable, though it might not be a bad idea to have a gunsmith give it a checkup first. You wouldn't want to shoot it much, they are not strong guns, and the latch wears rapidly. \n\nThe Colt is just a gem. S/N puts it in 1948 production. That is literally one of the finest revolvers ever built. If you want to learn to shoot, there is no gun more suited to the task. \n\nEdit: You seemed to focus on the little triangular stamp above the front of the trigger guard. That is VP, for verified proof, meaning it passed final factory inspection.\n\nFor basic maintenance, whether you shoot them or not, get some Break-free CLP, get the liguid, not the spray.  Shake it up, and drip some on a soft cloth like an old t-shirt, and wipe it over all exposed metal. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe it off with more soft cloth. It does an excellent job of preventing rust and preserving the finish. Wipe them down every time you handle them.

And you would think as a result I would have horrendous dreams. But I didn't! It was the most amazing thing. In fact i didn't dream at all! My parents got took me to the doctors and they did all these tests just to see what in fact was wrong with me. None of the hospitals in the local area could figure it out. So my parents decided to drive me out of state up north to a prestigious medical center that specialized in neurology and sleeping disorders. Those doctors did many tests as well and they determined that the condition rooted into some trauma that had occurred to me when I was an infant. The doctors offered my parents a new treatment that was currently being tested and was still somewhat in the development stages. They offered my parents a large amount of money payed in cash, and my parents didn't hesitate to accept the offer. So on the day of the operation my parents sent me inside the doctors office with my backpack full of coloring books and a 24 pack of rose-art crayons. I waited for about 20 minutes and the receptionist at the desk in front called me back and said he doctor was ready. So I grabbed my backpack and headed down the hallway until I reached the door to the operating room. I knocked and a voice said come in. I proceeded to turn the handle and walk inside the well lit room. The doctor asked me to come and lie down on the table and I did. The doctor then asked me to take off my shirt and shoes, I did willingly as I desperately wanted to be able to dream. The doctor then said he needed one last thing from me. I looked up at him and said \"what do you need doctor?\" he stared back down at me and said \"I need about three fiddy\" and it was about that time that i realized that my doctor was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era. I said \"god damn you loch ness monster! I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I jumped off the operating table and ran out.

{"body": "I've had similar first dates.  This one that comes to mind was a bit of a train wreak, and I really should have seen it coming, but somehow I was completely blind to multiple hints that this just wasn't going to work out.  It started when I met this girl at a friend's party.  I knew most of the people there, and walked around making pleasantries with acquaintances - many of which I wouldn't go out of my way to hang out with; but oh well, they were friends of one of my best friends, so I will place nice.  Well, I saw a new face, this girl standing in the corner of the room alone sipping on a soda.  She looked lonely, so I walked over to her, introduced myself, and asked her how she was doing.  Apparently, her friend brought her to the party, then proceeded to disappear with some other friends never to return.  She has apparently been standing there for an hour or so with no idea where her friend went (I came to find out she left with some random guy without telling her, but that is neither here nor there, and worked out sort-of in my favor).  I invited her, Melissa, to have a seat in the kitchen, away from most of the commotion of the party, and talked with her.  \n\nI came to find out that she was a second year student at UIC, studying biology - Cute AND smart, very nice.  Well, we chatted throughout the night, we talked about what she wanted to do for a living (study marine life, though there isn't a whole lot of a chance to do so up in Chicago, so she might move down to florida or something for post-grad work).  I told her about what I do - the not-so exciting life of a software engineer in Chicago.  We talked about our pasts, what brought us to this point in our lives.  We talked about random sciencey stuff, stuff that would have bored most of the other party-goers, but we both absolutely loved talking about.  Things were going awesomely well, we talked until the sun came up.  She unfortunately had to go for a class, but I asked her out and she said yes.  I haven't met a woman quite like her in my life, and I have to say, I was completely smitten with her.  She liked all the things that I liked, she was intelligent, and she was *cute*.  We set a date a few days later, I would pick her up from school (since she had a later class that day), we would hang out for a while, then go get dinner and see a movie.\n\nThat day came, I got all gussied up, nice clothes, nice cologne.  Washed my car, cleaned it out... even waxed it.  Cleaned my apartment - you know, just in case.  I went and sat to the side of the building she was in (well, I was wrong, so at least, the building I *thought* she was in) and waited for her to come out.  She called, we found eachother, and we were off.  I took her to this steakhouse in the burbs that I like to go to.  I know the owner of the place, so I can get some pretty preferential treatment if I call ahead and let them know.  Fairly expensive joint, from the look on her face, probably the most expensive restaurant she's ever gone to.  No worries, I can afford it.  Well, the Head Chef and the Sommelier walks over to the table and they introduce themselves.  They tell us of the specials they have in store for us tonight, and the best wine parings for the entrees.  I tell the chef to make us whatever he things is best, and the sommelier to get us nice bottle to go along with what the chef will be making us.  She seems really far out of her element, but I tell her not to worry.  This place is good, and she was about to have something absolutely delicious.\n\nA little bit of time passes and we get our food.  It was absolutely amazing, and we both loved it.  The bill comes, I pay, thank the chef, the sommelier, and the owner for the delicious meal, and we head out.  It is, however, a little later than we were expecting to leave, and we had no way to make the movie time.  She says that she is a little tired, and would like to maybe call it a night.  I am depressed because I thought I did something and blew it, so I drive her home thinking about what I could have possibly of done wrong.  We get to her apartment, I park and walk her to her door, not expecting much.  I lean in for a kiss, and she accepts... much more than I was expecting.  She seemed to get into it quite a bit.  She then says the magic words: \"Do you want to come up.\"  There were fireworks going off in my head.  Holy fucking yes, absolutely, I would **love** to come up.  Here is where it takes a turn for the worse.  \"Before you come up, I would like to ask you a favor.\"  About to get laid, I don't care what it is, so I say \"Of course, what's up?\"  She then asks me for money... like, seriously... \"Can I have bout tree fiddy?\"  I suddenly start to think about our entire date... and have a sudden moment of clarity.  I am standing there in a nice residential neighborhood in chicago, in the arms of a three hundred foot tall monster from the cretaceous period.  Suddenly, I am not feeling all that great, and go to excuse myself, but she forces herself on me.  I didn't fight back nearly as much as I should have.  So there it is reddit, my worst first date.

{"body": "You should read [this](http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/10-myths-and-10-truths-about-atheism1/) article by Sam Harris which addresses your concern about atheistic dictatorships. One of his main points is that the regimes you have mentioned, such as Pol Pot, Stalin, etc., committed horrendous atrocities because they were structured too much like religion. These states were extremely dogmatic and portrayed their leaders to be nearly if not completely divine. I do not think that there is any society that has been harmed by embracing free thought. \n\n As a side note it is widely accepted that Adolf Hitler was a theist. In his book *Mein Kampf* he often proclaims that god is on the side of the Nazi Party. \n\nI also challenge you to come up with a reasonable definition of \"human nature.\" This term is often used by the religious to signify the existence of a soul, something that as far as I can tell is as fictional as the Loch Ness monster. This is not to say that humans are worthless or that human life should be treated as a commodity, but it does mean that religion does not have any kind of monopoly on determining the morality of any individual or state. \n\nLet me give you another definition of faith: belief that is not based on proof. Faith is meaningless. Faith in god is about as valuable as faith in the tooth fairy. \n\nI would never say that religion has never been valuable to the human race, just that it no longer holds much importance. It provided a basis of morality for thousands of years. However, it is entirely possible to take some lessons from religion, such as treat others as you yourself would wish to be treated, and disregard other bigotry and delusional teachings. Other atheists may disagree, and this is only my personal opinion. ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343097915", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh damn, I've been waiting for this topic! Only this'll probably be buried, so crap.\n\nWhen I was in 6th grade, I dreamt that my mother and I were leaving OM practice (odyssey of the mind, for the uninitiated) after school. Instead of taking our normal route home, she took me over the mountain near the elementary school, a path that would take us into the town nearby.\n\nThat route, an unconventional path that we didn't often take anyway, was on that day totally altered. We pulled around a bend and the road took us by a large body of water that I recognized, somehow.\n\nMom said look, it's [Loch Ness](http://www.ego4u.com/images/countries/uk/loch-ness01.jpg), and being 11 and more than a little monster-obsessed, I didn't stop to wonder why a Scottish loch was suddenly in Southwest VA, I just begged to stop, and we did.\n\nWhen we got to the water, I began to notice large ripples, and a head broke through the water! It was large and vaguely equine, with ossicones like a giraffe, and I was thrilled because we had discovered incontrovertible proof of the existence of Nessie! \n\nAt that moment, there was a loud rumbling in the distance, louder than anything I'd ever heard. I looked away from the monster towards Mom, and she was staring at the horizon. When I turned, I realized that the explosion I was hearing was an atomic detonation. The mushroom cloud was rising, and I feared that we had little to no time to react. The monster dove back under water, and I leaped toward the car. I knew the answer was in their, somewhere.\n\nI think I said something about escape, and Mom said \"we'll never make it in time.\" She leaned into the car and got something from the glove compartment. She turned back to me and handed me a handgun, which I knew we didn't have, but in that moment, I knew what I had to do.\n\nI turned the gun to my temple, and woke up sweating. I didn't sleep anymore that night or the next, and for months after I couldn't hear certain songs on the radio or watch certain TV programs without feeling a deep sinking in my stomach coupled with a sense of impending danger and fear of the mortality I suddenly understood very well. Those feelings persisted until about 8th grade, and even now, many years later, I can remember every moment of the dream vividly and still have that sinking feeling when confronted by certain era-specific triggers.\n\n**TL;DR** -- Nessie hits like an atom bomb and \"The Sign\" by Ace of Base makes me consider my own mortality.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343145107", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "You can't have an ELI5 about 9/11 being an inside job any more than you can have an ELI5 as to why the Loch Ness monster exists. \n\nOn the other hand, you can have an ELI5 about why some people *believe* that 9/11 was an inside job.\n\nConspiracy theories about 9/11 stick around for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, there is the matter of conspiracy theories in general. \n\n[Dr. Stephen Novella, a neurologist at Yale Medical School, sums it up neatly:](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/conspiracy-science/)\n\n&gt;Conspiracy thinking is rooted in a desire for control and understanding, triggered by a lack of control and information, or ambiguous and unsatisfying information about big events. The authors emphasize that the public often has a lack of access to adequate information to explain historical events (a situational factor). This can be coupled with what has been called a “crippled epistemology” – a tendency to utilize circular reasoning, confirmation bias, and poor logic coupled with this lack of information. The result is a popular conspiracy theory that makes sense (even if a perverse sense) of events.\n\nTo translate that into ELI5 terms: when some people feel that they lack control and information, they will often make up a story about the world, a story where there is more control and information. In this story that they make up, they will cast themselves as heroes who have a supernatural ability to pierce the fog of misinformation and to unravel the \"true\" story, just as they will also cast others as villains who control the situation and who either hide or deceive everyone else. \n\nAfter all, in a way, it's more comforting to believe that the world is controlled by devious villains with a plan than to believe that the world is inherently unpredictable, illogical, and not at all designed to fit into your preconceptions. \n\nTo take it outside of the 9/11 context, it really is very hard to accept that JFK could be brought down by a fucktard with a shitty Italian rifle. The world feels pitiful and small when you realize that any old jerk could kill any hero you have. It's easy to sympathize with the person who thinks that there must have been more to it: that if JFK was going to die, it must have been for grand reasons, by a cast of powerful villains, and not simply as a result of a crack shot with a crappy gun on a sunny day.\n\nOn 9/11/01, Americans had been confronted by a confusing and scary situation. We had never seen such a vicious attack on American soil. A national landmark crumbled to the ground. There were months and years of uncertainty and fear. As someone who was in NYC on 9/11, I remember not only how terrifying it was seeing the towers collapse on the street, but also the weeks afterwards when there were constant rumors of further attacks. \n\nFor some people, the idea that our country could be attacked in so seemingly simple a manner - get a bunch of assholes to crash a bunch of planes into shit - was too confusing and unexpected to take at face value. These people could not accept that plane crashes and burning jet fuel could topple giant skyscrapers, killing thousands. These people could not accept the idea that our national intelligence apparatus could have let this happen. \n\nAnd so, rather than cede the world to uncertainty and confusion, they settled into a comforting fantasy: that we did not live in a world in which the country had not been attacked by a bunch of mass murderers working for a stateless entity, but instead we lived in a world where we were merely seeing one phase of a huge, well-orchestrated conflict.\n\nIt's the perfect fantasy for some. Instead of living uncertainly in an unpredictable world, one where motives are murky and danger comes by surprise, the conspiracy theorist gets to be a live as a hero fighting evil in a thoroughly predictable world. \n\nAnd so, we see that \"crippled epistemology\" on display as well in 9/11 Truther literature. To put \"crippled epistemology\" in ELI5 terms, the idea is that conspiracy theorists have a broken mechanism for determining what is true and what is false. 9/11 Truthers have already determined that planes could not have brought down the WTC, and so evidence to the contrary is ignored or dismissed. Contradictions within the 9/11 Truther narrative itself are ignored or dismissed. Impossible standards of evidence are adopted. Incorrect assumptions about what \"would have happened\" had planes hit the WTC are adopted. \n\nThere is a peculiar relationship to the idea of \"authority\" within conspiracy circles as well. Of course the government's own investigation is considered off-limits, except when someone in the government says something that the Truthers believe supports their cause. The structural and civil engineering community that debunks the Truthers are dismissed out of hand, as well. It's typical to see conspiracy literature where proponents are identified as having PhDs, but those PhDs will be in unrelated fields, such as Theology - the implication is that you should take someone more seriously because they have, say, a PhD in Physics or Software Engineering, but that's an improper argument from authority. You'll have organizations like Engineers and Architects for 9/11 Truth, but who knows how many of those engineers or architects have any relevant training.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343225287", "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "score": 14, "controversiality": 0}

I ask you and I say \"I need about tree fiddy.\" And before you realize that I was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the palezoic era I say I'll pay you back tree fiddy plus another 10% of that (so 35 cents) in a year. You say \"Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no treefiddy!\" and I say \"how about just two fiddy?\" yet I'll still pay you tree fiddy plus 10% in a year.\n\nYou accept and loan me two fiddy for a year. Well at the end of the year I pay you back tree fiddy plus .35 cents! So by loaning me two fiddy you made $1.35 (  (tree fiddy + $0.35) - two fiddy  ). That $1.35 is your yield in dollar amounts. Do some math by dividing it by your two fiddy is your percent yield. That percent yield is how much investors will charge to loan to the government. \n\nSum it up the yield is made of two pieces:\n1. The difference between what you pay for the bond and what you get paid back(pay two fiddy now, get tree fiddy later)\n2. The interest you receive ($0.35)\n\nNow that's a very basic example of yields for bonds held to maturity. If you want to know what that means I'll be more than happy to explain.

{"body": "Alright, I've never told this story to anyone, and I'm using a throw away because the girl(s) involved could be identified pretty easily if someone I know read this.\n\nI was dating this girl in high school named Mallory. Dating is not really the right word; we were using each other for casual, meaningless, hot, torrid and frequent sex. This chick was everything a seventeen year old me could ever want. She had red hair, green eyes, c cups, long legs and curvy as fuck. She was one of those people who really liked the danger of being caught. Several times I was forced to fuck her brains in right behind the school, or in the bathroom of a restaurant. There was no saying no to this girl; when she wanted sex, she got sex.\n\nNow that I've told you about this amazing, living and breathing sex doll. Let me tell you the best part, she had a twin...apparently. I'd never seen her because when they were younger her parents had divorced, and she stayed with her mom, and the other one went with her dad. Anyways, I'm chilling at home watching reruns of Recess (that show's the tits), when I get a text that says this, \"Hey coming over; bringing Madison ;)\". I'll remember that text for the rest of my life. Now you're thinking, \"You just automatically assumed she's bring her twin sister over to bang you?\" Yes, yes that is exactly what my seventeen year old brain thought. My parents are gone, the house is empty, this shit is happening. I shot up out of bed, cleaned my room up a bit and took a shower. The whole time I'm thinking, *There's two of this chick, and i'm gunna fuck both of them There's two of this chick, and i'm gunna fuck both of them*. That was on a loop in my head.\n\nCut to:\n\nTwenty minutes later Mallory and Madison are both in my room, and I'm doing everything I can to not pass out from excitement. Apparently they'd already talked about granting me the fleeting ménage à trois I so desperately wanted. They start to take off their clothes, slowly, I could tell they were nervous. I wasn't saying a word; I was afraid if I did the spell would be broken and the increasingly naked girls in front of me would disappear.\n\nThey start to move towards me, my breath is short and erratic, my heart is **pounding**, I was obviously harder than a diamond in an ice storm. Then a car door shuts. *My parents, fuck*.\n\n\"What time is it?\" I said.\n\n\"About tree fiddy,\" the twin said.\n\nWell it was about that time I noticed this \"twin\" was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "Oh OP, do I have a story for you, your tastes will be satisfied.\n\nWhen I was just exiting High School me and my twin weren't the best of friends.  At the start of High School we did everything together.  But towards the end... we started fading, and in 12th grade we were both fighting over a girl and who got to get her and ultimately at the end of 12th grade he got the girl and I wasn't too happy about that.\n\nI had been friends with this girl since 3rd grade, when she first moved to our area, and he hadn't taken a liking to her since that year.  Basically, you could say I was friendzoned.\n\nMe and my brother looked incredibly alike (We're twins, obviously) and more than once she mistook me for him.  \n\nThey were together that entire summer.  It was absolute torture to see my brother and the girl I'd liked since 3rd grade together, kissing, hugging, cuddling.  I even heard them having sex once.  I'd never been so depressed and jealous in my life.  That entire summer was one giant heartbreak.  \n\nNear the end of the summer, mid August or so, I decided that I'd get back at my brother.  I decided that one day when he was out doing something I would dress like him, talk like him, and invite the girl over for a little \"fun\".  She'd never know the difference.\n\nThe girl wasn't that attractive to be completely honest... but her personality more than made up for it.  To be honest, I don't even know why she wanted to be with him, her interests aligned with mine much more than they did with his, but that's aside the point.\n\nThe day finally came when my brother went to hang out with his friends and I quickly invited the girl over.  The phone conversation was easy enough, I convinced her to come over without any problem.  I was nervous she'd notice something was off when she got to the front door though.\n\nShe came over, I tried to act as natural as I could and open the door.  She said hello and gave me a kiss.  I'd been waiting for that kiss for 9 years now and it made me feel ecstatic.  She picked up on my extra happiness I guess and said jokingly, \"Wow, why are you in such a good mood today?\"  I invited her to go up to his room and as planned, we started making out and stripping each other's clothes off.\n\nThen she stopped suddenly and said, \"You don't kiss like Michael (my brother), It's you Thehealeroftri, isn't it?\"  I'm a terrible actor, I couldn't act this one off, I tried to let out a laugh and say something like, \"Haha, yeah right, it's me!\" and try to go back to whatever we were doing.  Instead it came out like, \"AHAHA, Yeahhhhhhh hahaaaaaaaa.\" and not nearly as smooth as I had planned.  I didn't really know what I said completely because I could feel myself start to shake and sweat.\n\nI was expecting her to be disgusted, tell my brother, and then we'd all hate each other for the rest of our lives.  Instead she just told me, \"I know you've liked me for some time now.  I would be with you but I think your brother is more physically attractive than you.\"  Instead of trying to explain how we're twins, I just stuttered a bit and nodded.  She continued, \"But I won't tell your brother if we get together this once.\"\n\nAnd with that once sentence all of my fear was gone.  I was back in the game with her.  We ended up having sex, it wasn't the best, but it felt great.  Even more so because I'd wanted to be with her for quite some time now.  We layed there for a bit.  Eventually I looked up at the clock only to realize 5 hours had passed, my brother would probably be home any second, I jumped out of bed and told her she needed to get going too but instead she layed there and told me to get back in the bed with her.  \n\nI got back in and tried to explain to her that my brother would be home soon but instead she looked at me and said with a happy face, \"I need something from you first...\" Confused, I replied, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"  It was around this time I realized that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, \"Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.\n\nMy brother never did figure out what happened to his girlfriend,  I never told him about it and he became a bit sad that she stopped seeing him, but hey, that's life.\n\ntl;dr:  Acted as my twin brother, tried to get with his girlfriend.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343329313", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 217, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "Thanks for the feedback. I'm going to try and address your concerns in as organized a way as I can haha. Just some general notes, while I am sympathetic to the notion that science may very well be a dogmatic structure that limits experience and dictates the ways that we think (being both scientifically and philosophically trained myself) I don't think it would be helpful to use this to try and discount the things that the scientific method can allow us to learn. \n\nMore importantly, I don't think that using the scientific method is necessary when finding evidence that can be critiqued on it's own merits, but merely the basic premises of this method. Namely if we hope to find good evidence for the paranormal I believe we will need to look outside of individual experience and look for phenomena that leave behind more objective evidence. While this doesn't necessitate that personal experience cannot be a source of paranormal belief, I do believe that the subjective nature of these beliefs will necessitate their exclusion from our pool of evidence because they have no logical value. By this I literally mean that we cannot attribute a truth value to personal subjective experiences. This limits its ability to inform others, and therefore makes it impossible to logically deduce whether or not something paranormal has occurred. While I don't want to fully discount these experiences, I don't believe that they are helpful when trying to move towards a more thorough understanding of the phenomena at hand. Therefore I think it would be fruitful for us to remove them from this board. You bring up a good rebuttal of this point in your first point as if you anticipated that I might say this haha.\n\n&gt;I thought that the presumed nature of the paranormal defies logic?\n\nWell, just because the paranormal may operate outside of the realm of the natural world does not mean that it defies logic, merely that it defies scientific theory to this point. To defy logic would literally mean that the paranormal cannot stand on the basis of it's own premises, and therefore would lead me to conclude at least that the subject being proposed is impossible (Although logic is a funny thing, and there are some logicians who work within the realm of logics that appear illogical to our everyday notions of the word. Still, these theories would only show that an argument is illogical in one logic set, not necessary illogical in them all). There have been logical arguments for the existence of god, or for Plato's world of forms, or for a world composed of multiple and ever duplicating parallel universes, all of which cannot be tested scientifically in any way that is foolproof. Just because these theories do not fit within everyday scientific logic does not mean that they are illogical, or that they cannot be tested using the power of logic.\n\nThe major problem with posting stories of subjective paranormal experience is really that to critique these experiences would require a full deduction of the logic involved in that belief, which is oftentimes not worked out fully due to the emotion of the situation. This will get messy, and I suspect would greatly limit this reddit. In order to keep things from devolving into logical holes that cannot be solved, I argue again that we should limit the posting of personal anecdotes as evidence without objective evidence of the phenomena as well. \n\n&gt;I see a lot of preemptive attempts to limit info...more arguments for laziness on the part of those who claim a wish to process information. You should open opportunity to have access to information - not try to box it up even before you get it. I see a concerted effort to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\nThe FAQ will merely state evidence that has already been considered and the arguments both for and against that evidence. It will really be used more as a means of informing the reader. You can still post basically whatever evidence you come across, but just know that if you post a photo of dust particles that are illuminated due to your cameras flash then that will likely be downvoted. Same thing for posting evidence that has become so well known that it merely clogs up the pipes for good evidence (e.g. the Surgeons photo of Nessie). This is not done to limit evidence, but only to limit the amount of times we see the same evidence over and over again. \n\n&gt;...I'm getting the picture. This is about someone trying to play their hand at dictator. Knock yourself out. I'm wondering if my reply will be deleted in this preemptive hostile atmosphere.\n\nListen, clearly I am not trying to play dictator, and if anyone seriously believes that then I don't know how they operate on any of the other reddits haha. I did read this over again, though, and do think that the downvoting system should be enough to deal with this issue. I don't want the frontpage of this reddit to become cluttered with what amounts to spooky stories because that is precisely what most people coming here are trying to escape (or at least that was the original intention of the reddit). If it gets to be a problem people can message me about it. I have a feeling that due to the smaller visibility of this reddit most people who have had a single paranormal experience and have not spent time doing any investigative work or research will post to more commonly known paranormal reddits instead anyways. Still, my original intent was not to censor anyone but to keep this reddit from devolving into the same old stuff. \n\n&gt;But this should be your approach from the start - which is: Keep the channels wide open for contributions but interact according to the community's attempts to follow the scientific method. In other words the burden of following science should not be on submissions unless they claim to be offering science. The effort to employ science should be on those that take it upon themselves to claim the ability to follow the scientific method. If your channels are open you will have more data. If they are closed - less data.\n\nThis will be the general practice for moderation of this reddit, leaving things open to the community unless they call for a change. Again, the point of having the FAQ would be to inform contributors of arguments and challenges that have already been proposed by the community so that we do not end up arguing over the same things. \n\nI think you bring up a lot of good points, and I will take it all into consideration.

There is value in science - but its difficulty perhaps is a reflection of that value. \n\n&gt;if we hope to find good evidence for the paranormal I believe we will need to look outside of individual experience and look for phenomena that leave behind more objective evidence.\n\nI differ somewhat here based on the notion of personal reality. The conclusions of Religion and Science are used similarly to define experiences that by nature may be utterly personal. In my view this is often an attempt to impose homogeneity and is not necessarily a reflection of the will of nature or truth. But this is certainly vast and worthy territory for debate. \n\n&gt;While this doesn't necessitate that personal experience cannot be a source of paranormal belief, I do believe that the subjective nature of these beliefs will necessitate their exclusion from our pool of evidence because they have no logical value.\n\n:(\n\n&gt;By this I literally mean that we cannot attribute a truth value to personal subjective experiences.\n\nO.o\n\n&gt;This limits its ability to inform others, and therefore makes it impossible to logically deduce whether or not something paranormal has occurred.\n\nThe interest here in this statement appears to be the propagation of an experience as truth. That whole notion I think is problematic. Again, this is the goal of Religion and Science - the propagation of \"truths\" as determined externally to the individual. I understand the interest I just think it is by nature an attractor for errors - sometimes dramatic errors especially when the propagation is done with conviction and undue passion.  \n\n&gt;Still, these theories would only show that an argument is illogical in one logic set, not necessary illogical in them all\n\nThis is really the platform I am interested in. Logic (and science) is subject to culture and perception. (uh oh...should I refrain from bringing up quantum physics? - whoops). \n\nI think this area is rich territory and perhaps may be a principle key to understanding paranormal phenomenon. Therefore in my view it is unwise to impose limits on subjective data.  \n\n&gt;would require a full deduction of the logic involved in that belief, which is oftentimes not worked out fully due to the emotion of the situation.\n\nIt seems that this would imply that emotion is critical to the phenomenon and should not be overlooked? To me that seems obvious. I see little value in divorcing emotional elements from the data of human experience. Objective processing may be an asset - however even this may be debatable depending on the nature of the event or condition. (I am now reminded of how it used to be that doctors were required to be purely objective and detached from patients as a rule - until it became such a problem for all concerned that it lead to a whole new movement in medicine.)\n\n&gt;This will get messy, \n\noh no doubt! You got any chest high field overalls? ( ha - just kidding...but not really) \n\n&gt;and I suspect would greatly limit this reddit.\n\nI think it would expand the integrity of your effort...though I am also sure some personalities and interests would be sorely challenged perhaps to the limits of their perceptions and capacities for cognition. \n\n&gt;In order to keep things from devolving into logical holes that cannot be solved,\n\nA preemptive conclusion. ;)\n\n&gt;The FAQ will merely state evidence that has already been considered and the arguments both for and against that evidence. It will really be used more as a means of informing the reader. You can still post basically whatever evidence you come across, but just know that if you post a photo of dust particles that are illuminated due to your cameras flash then that will likely be downvoted.\n\nSounds like a reasonable warning about potential community behavior. On the other hand images that mimic previous phenomenon can be misconstrued as that phenomenon. That's an issue with UFO images. One person says it's a balloon while the origin of the image is up and down that it only looks like a balloon in the image. You see? It's second hand conclusions by observers not present at the onset of the event. The image perhaps should not be construed as proof - but to omit it from testimony is a basically arbitrary limit on data. \n\n&gt;Same thing for posting evidence that has become so well known that it merely clogs up the pipes for good evidence (e.g. the Surgeons photo of Nessie). This is not done to limit evidence, but only to limit the amount of times we see the same evidence over and over again.\n\nI can understand the impatience with public behaviors. But that's just what it is - impatience. In my view it would be interesting in itself to collect data (presuming I were to act as a scientist) on the phenomena of recurrent misconceptions. I really think the community would processes it through downvotes or copy-paste explanations. Otherwise there may be knee jerk deletions (if deleting should become the policy) of emergent data on previously accepted results. An affront to science I would think?   \n\n&gt;I am not trying to play dictator, and if anyone seriously believes that then I don't know how they operate on any of the other reddits haha.\n\nYeah, this is not an easy facet on management to process. It's a responsibility to enforce rules that reasonably obey the spirit of intentions as opposed to the letter of intentions. You handle this confrontation well so it speaks to some potential success in managing this subreddit. Challenges to concepts of authority are a test - it is how tests are met that show true intentions. \n\n&gt;Still, my original intent was not to censor anyone but to keep this reddit from devolving into the same old stuff. \n\nThe persistence of old stuff? You mean like...a haunting? ;)\n\n*cue old chains clinking in the attic*\n\nI think you are doing a very good job chipstar325 and wish you much success, or at least interesting data, in your work. \n\nI acknowledge your thoughtful reexaminations, your good will and am honored to have been of any help despite my own dim uncertainties.\n\nLive long and prosper! ;)   \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iaKs-s_54\n \n**edit** a couple words", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343333226", "subreddit": "ParanormalScience", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "At the age of three I was taken from my home into a guild of dunken pie thieves to be trained in the ways of the Gejorvics as my family has done for 78 generations. Everyone there wore a green mask showing nothing but the nostrils. On my first day, I was rounded up with the other apprentices to do the hard manual labor that was required of us. I found myself paired up with a boy called Chiko. It turns out he was kidnapped by a band of Priests and forced to be a sex slave before being rescued by the pie bandits. But thats not really important. Anyway, over the years, we got to be rather close. He taught me the song of his people, and I taught him how to make the crumpets of truth. After some time, we graduated from being mere apprentices and were sent on our first recon mission. We were sent out with a group of five others (two sets of apprentices and a veteran). As we crept closer to the target, I started to feel uneasy. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a glint of steel. I dove at Chiko and pulled him to the ground just as the trap was sprung. The fucking bakers had been expecting us. We hit the ground as all hell broke loose. Explosions shook the ground as bullets and blood flew through the air. I looked around at the carnage and did the only thing I could. I ran. I ran until I couldn't run any farther, and then I ran some more. After a while, I realized that I could no longer hear the sounds of battle. And I was completely alone. I made camp in the forest and waited for morning. I crept back to the scene of the attack, and found it completely devoid of life. I counted six  bodies, one of them so mangled I couldn't even make out the uniform. As I stood there in shock, a baker recon team found me. They tied me up and sent me to a POW facility deeper into the woods. It was hell. We labored from sunrise to sunset, kneading dough, plowing fields, tending to the ovens without so much as a piece of cloth to protect our hands. At the end of the day, they emptied out our one bucket and threw raw cookie dough into the pit. They fought over it like mad dogs. I'm ashamed to say that I did too. After a while, the war ended and we were free. When I first entered the camp there were 200 of us. Now there were only 40. I took what was left of my life and moved to a quiet town in the countryside. I fell in love with a girl, had a family, and everything was going well. Until one day, I heard a knock on the door. It was a man I didn't recognize. He told me that he had something important to tell me, but we couldn't do it in the presence of his family. I was confused, but I went with him anyway. We had a few bears, talked a bit, and had a fairly nice time. On our fifth round, he told me that he had found the one responsible for the ambush that killed my friend and ruined my life all those years ago. He gave me his address, and left without another word. My hands shaking, I picked up the piece of paper on which it was written, and set off on my journey. After three days of walking, I stood in front of the house with a gun in one hand and a machete in the other. It was just a small hut, probably only one room. I kicked the door in, spotted my target, and shot him right in the chest. I walked over and saw... something in his eyes as he gave his final breath. *What was it* I wondered. As I was leaving, I saw a fresh batch of crumpets sitting on the counter. With him having no more use for them, I took one and bit into it. I froze. It was a crumpet of truth. I looked back at the man on the floor and a sob caught in my throat. It was... Chiko. I ran on through the night to get to my house, but when I got there, it was on fire. I ran inside, only to find the bodies of my wife and children. As I sat outside on a hill, crying, the man from earlier walked up beside me smiling. Distraught, I shouted, **WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?** To which he replied, only about tree fiddy. It was then that I realized he was a giant plesiosaur.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343341052", "subreddit": "MLPLounge", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

It was a strange and solemn meeting, filled with sadness and tension. Numerous times during the visit, a relative would leave the room bawling, only to come back later with red, sore eyes. I felt bad for him, seeing all the crying and pain suffered over his condition. At one point he motioned for my mother, his daughter, to come close so he could whisper something into her ear (it was hard for him to speak because of his pneumonia). He whispered something quietly into her ear and tears began to well up in her eyes. Soon she was crying harder than I had ever seen her cry before, and she had to leave for a moment. My dad and many other relatives went to go comfort her, but I could still hear her screaming with grief at the end of the hall. Everyone left in the room, one by one, burst into tears. Eventually I was the only one left in the room at the time. The thought of losing my grandfather, after all the fun memories we'd had, was really beginning to get to me, and I let a solitary tear drip down my cheek.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" whispered my dying grandfather. He motioned for me to come closer. I felt his irregular, shallow breath on my ear.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I told your mother.\"\tI leaned in a bit closer.\n\n\"I only have one dying wish, one thing I need...

{"body": "My 1st English professor in college did.\n\nShe's from Baxley, Georgia. According to her, she lived off of a 2 lane road with trees all the way down on one side and a very large field on the other (she was on the side of the field). One night, around when she was 16 or so, woke up near 3 A.M. and couldn't go back to sleep, so she went downstairs to get a glass of water. On her way down, she looked out the window at the bottom of the stairs and saw a brightly glowing white light off in the distance. She stared at it for a good 10 minutes, got the water, and went back to bed. For several sequential nights, this same occurrence happened until finally she went outside after waking her sister or brother up (I can't remember which gender her sibling was) and they stood out on the front porch of her house. She then asked for Tree Fiddy and it turned out my professor was a 500 foot tall dinosaur from the paleolithic era.\n\nNot really, I just couldn't resist. The real ending to the story was that when she went outside with her sibling, she thought, as if trying to telepathically communicate with the UFO, \"Please just send me a sign you're real\", and the UFO took about a second to zoom across the field and hover above their heads for about 30 seconds. According to her, it was some sort of translucent glass with a blinding light emanating from the core of the ship (with no sound coming from anywhere, as if the entire world had gone silent), and she could make out the shadows of several tall and thin beings standing at the edge. After the 30 seconds are up, it flew straight up into the air (just above the trees, roughly 80-90 feet into the air), then took off down the road in front of their house. They ran back inside and attempted to tell their parents, who told them they were dreaming and to go back to bed. Both her and her sibling swear by it.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343428795", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

We were driving around the city, rolling blunts, listening to music, and enjoying our time. I remember it perfectly, it was such a beautiful morning. We drove for hours and just kept smoking, not thinking about the consequences. All of the sudden, I see those horrible lights behind me. Blue and red were flashing and I knew the cop was going to bust us. We ease over to side and try to calm ourselves down. The car reaked and I knew we had at least a half ounce of pot. We were fucked. I looked out the back window and the cop opened his door and slowly walked up, he looked us in the eyes and said \"How stupid can you be?\" Just like that I was thrown in the back of a cop car. It was 2 in the afternoon and I was thrown in jail. I called my mom and all I  heard was crying, I begged for her to bail me out, that I would change and be the son I used to be, but she just hung up. An officer told me I would have to spend the entire night there since I wasn't going to be bailed out. I was thrown into a cell with two other people, but I wouldn't even call them people, they were more like monsters. One was a skinny, white heroin addict. THe other was a giant, fat, building of a man who had the scariest tattoos I had ever seen. The heroin addict was taken out and it was just me and the giant. When it became night, the guards left and did not care about any of our well-being. I was just sitting there, terrified, praying that someone would help me. The giant came over to me, and said, \"You know Im gonna be getting something from you.\" I had never been more terrified in my life but I had to act tough, I just said \"What do you want.\" He came close to me, put his head next to mine and whispered in my ear, \"I need about three-fiddy\" It was at that moment that i realized the inmate was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343580081", "subreddit": "funny", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Okay, first off, what the hell does Matthew have anything to do with the Mitzvot?\n\nSecond, nothing else you said had anything to do with the Mitzvot (aka the 613 commandments YHWH supposedly provided to Moses after the flight from Egypt as part of the Second Covenant).\n\nThird, nothing you said had anything to do with homosexuality, either, which is the relevant part of this discussion.\n\nFourth, people like myself, who've read the book cover to cover, bring up Leviticus because it's the most referenced and clearest condemnation against same-sex relationships in the Bible. And I reiterate that Leviticus has nothing to do with the Mitzvot, which is what the poster I responded to was facetiously referencing.\n\nFifth, I don't have any sins, because \"sin\" is defined as an action against the God of Abraham, and the God of Abraham most assuredly does not exist. And I can say that as firmly as I can say that Zeus or Sol Invictus or Ahura Mazda or the loch ness monster doesn't exist. IF a supreme being even has a chance of existing, it's a panentheistic deity at best and more likely just a deistic one. So Jesus apparently wasted his time with that little blood sacrifice of his.\n\nSixth, let's assume your deity does exist in the way you just said it did. If the only thing necessary to save yourself from this \"sin\" is accepting the human sacrifice of your own god, then surely you realize that you have precisely no moral imperative at all, right? Literally anything you do is equally dismissed by a single admission of repentance. Which not only means that we could legalize gay marriage *tomorrow* and simply have all the legislators pray for forgiveness and BAM they're fine, but that the measure of \"judgement\" in your theology is an arbitrary admission of nominal guilt and only that, while not doing that merits eternal agony. According to your theology, Adolf Hitler is sitting around in heaven right now, while all the Jews he killed are being eternally burned. The architects of the Crusades floating around in paradise with pedophile priests and serial killers, while Mahatma Gandhi is chained to a metaphorical wall in a dark pit. Bill Gates, who has given several billion dollars of his assets to save starving African children will be tortured alongside many of those starving African children, while the likes of people like Fred Phelps and Pat Robertson and Billy Graham and every other in a long list of morally bankrupt evangelical charlatans will be given eternal life. Why? Because the people who forsook their intellectual capacity and blindly accepted a backwards tale of blood curses and sacrifices are somehow noble? I shouldn't care about a nonexistent entity so much, but your god is clearly a malevolent psychopath. And given the choice between being eternally tortured in Hell and being eternally tortured by being forced to worship such a cosmic tyrant, I'll take Hell. At least then I can do my part to spite the bastard, because I'm gonna be tortured either way.\n\nBut of course, I *don't care* about a nonexistent entity. The only thing that brings me pain is that you apparently continue to worship such a monster, and I know that I'm not going to be able to change that with a single combative Reddit post. However, if you stay on Reddit for more than the seven days you've been lurking here, you may be able to break free of those shackles on your own. I do hope that happens, for your sake.\n\nSo tl;dr, Nothing you said had any applicability to anything I said, and also your religion is clearly evil.

{"body": "&gt;You said it was impossible to hold fundamentalist or theistic beliefs and have any semblance of critical thinking skills.\n\nActually, that's *not* what I said.  I said that if they did exercise critical thinking skills on the topic of theism, they would cease to be theists.\n\n&gt;That is stating an opinion and pretending it's a fact. \n\nNo, it's a fact.  If people exercise critical thinking skills, then they would give up any beliefs they have in ghosts, the Loch Ness monster, magic, astrology, gods, homeopathy, spirits and any other pseudoscientific nonsense.  If the people who believed in pseudosciencecritically evaluated their beliefs, they wouldn't hold pseudoscientific beliefs.  The beliefs prosper in society because people either A) don't know how to critically examine their beliefs or B) don't want to.\n\nIf you do not feel that beliefs in deities is pseudoscientific, then please feel free to point out *one* piece of evidence for the existence of a deity.\n\n&gt;The analogy holds, but because you are incapable of looking at your own opinions with a semblance of objectivity you refuse to admit it. \n\nNo, it *really* doesn't.  It only holds if you think that the problem with fundamentalists is that they state opinion as fact, which you still haven't shown that I've done.   However, that is not the problem with fundamentalists.  The problem with fundamentalists is that they hold the keeping of their own beliefs to be more moral than what is otherwise moral.  The problem with fundamentalists is that they brainwash their kids into believing what they believe.  The problem with fundamentalists is that they try to force all others to practice the same religion they do.  The problem with fundamentalists is *not* that they write snarky comments on their little internet forums. Sorry, there is no comparison here.\n\n&gt;Look, someday you'll graduate high school and realize that some intelligent people that are also good thinkers are going to come to different conclusions than you.\n\nAre you familiar with the [Outsider Test of Faith](http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Outsider_test)?  It was actually written by a theist--right around the time he became an atheist.  In general, the idea stipulates that if a belief is logically held, then it should be a trivial matter to convince another rational person why that belief is true.  Theism fails this test.  All you have to do is show me (or any other rational person) one valid reason to think that there is any sort of deity.  I'll give a very fair examination to any sort of possible evidence.\n\nUnfortunately, no theist I've *ever* talked to has ever been capable of giving anything even remotely resembling a coherent thought as to why I should believe in a deity (and I've talked to a lot of them).  I'm all ears--they just don't have any valid reasoning.  Their arguments are virtually always either Pascal's Wager, the First Cause Argument, or some attempt to redefine God as something that does exist, or \"you just gotta believe!\".\n\nAnd finally, even if they're intelligent and come to different conclusions than I do, that doesn't even imply that I'm wrong--only that one of us is.  Intelligent people join cults, too.  Does that mean that you're going to start seriously considering joining [Happy Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Science)?  So why do you think that I'd seriously consider theism to be remotely reasonable because \"intelligent theists exist.\"\n\nIn the end, your entire argument seems to be based upon the concept of, \"What if you're wrong.\"  Because the only way a rational person could examine theism and come to different conclusions about it than I did would be if I had been irrational in my examinations of it.  So the entire idea of, \"some intelligent people that are also good thinkers are going to come to different conclusions than you,\" is essentially the same thing as saying, \"You may be wrong,\" or, \"Admit that you might be wrong.\"  This is bullshit.\n\n\nFWIW, I should tell you that I am a former theist who quit believing in theism when I realized how completely and totally insaine the entire idea of a god is.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343660759", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Usual cliched dude's week in Vegas.  It was my first time going there while of gambling age.  I had been cleaning up at blackjack for half the night.  The dealer's courteous smiles were starting to turn to oh-so-subtle grimaces.  I suspect this might have been planned by the house, but this absolute stunner of a woman happened by.  I could tell she was watching me with a lot of interest and intent.  \n\nAfter watching me for another few rounds, she sent a drink my way.  The table was starting to get cold, and gentleman that I was, I couldn't leave a lovely lady such as herself who had shown me such a courtesy alone at her barstool.\n\nI bid the dealer a good night, after which he smiled more genuinely than he had in hours.  Although I was a bit drunk, I straightened myself up and strolled over to the house's loveliest lass.\nShe was a brunette with hair straight out of a L'Oreal commercial in a deep red dress that suited her just perfectly.  She had these long, smooth legs, these breasts that were held in her dress such that they looked like the softest, most amazing rotund pillows of feminine beauty.  Good Lord was she a stunner.  \n\nI kindly returned her courtesy and bought her the next drink.  Amaretto on the rocks with a lemon wedge.  We got to talking.  This woman was pure class.  I mean damn, what a dame.  She spoke with the sort of elegance and intelligence that, combined with her absolutely killer looks, would turn James Bond into her bitch.  She didn't seem to mind how stunned I was by her charm, however.\n\nI ask her if I can take her elsewhere for drinks, at which point she breaks it to me.  She's one of those ladies who only goes upstairs for paying folk.  I found myself somewhat disappointed, but I sat back down and figured it was at least worth talking some more.  \n\nTurns out that she was in the business for a little bit simply for the experimentation factor.  This was the kind of lady who had the poise, intelligence, and command to take herself anywhere she wanted in this world, and the looks to make men forget that she would need them when laying the world at the feet.  After another few drinks, I made the decision; despite my good looks, sharp dress, and charm, I had not been having luck at all with the ladies recently.  I had made some great bank at the tables, and could afford to splurge on a night with the most incredible woman I'd ever met.  \n\nI again invite her upstairs, indicating with my expression that I knew what it involved.  Perhaps this is just part of the game, but she looked at me like this was one she knew she'd really enjoy.  As we walked, I noticed that to accompany her perfect green eyes and fantastic bod was this perfectly-shaped, popping, tight little ass.  My excitement must have been visible to all the passersby.  \n\nWe get up to my room, and just skip the drinks.  I start kissing her and working my fingers through her hair and brushing them down her neck, leading her to moan softly as she grasped the back of my head and pulled me closer.  After gliding my hands over her silk-clad body a few times, I started undoing her dress.  She had on this burgundy-lace bra and thong which made me do a double-take.  She noticed my pause, chuckled, and with a sexy smile, told me she was glad I approved.  \n\nAfter slowly working the rest of our clothing off, I start getting her ready for me.  I'm quite good with my tongue betwixt a lady's legs, and I could tell she learned this quickly.  After a while down there, caressing her stomach, chest, and inner legs all the while, she decided it was her turn.  She proceeded to fellate me to the point where my member felt hard as steel.  We both knew it was time.  \n\nI proceeded to make passionate love to her for half an hour in several different positions.  I lost count of how many times I felt her come.  \n\nAfter we finished, we both collapsed on the bed in delighted exhaustion.  After a few minutes of silence, she turned to me and spoke words to me that I will take to my grave:\n\n\"That'll be about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343673726", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Now I have not seen this man in about 10 years and was very happy to see him again but yet depressed because of his state. I talked to him on the train ride there but told him to meet me somewhere for lunch. When it was lunch time I went to where I told him to go but when I got there he was drunk out of his mind and yelling at the waiters and everything. I made up the excuse of him being my brother and I took off work for the rest of the day and took him home. We talked about what he was doing with his life and how he got to where he is today. He said that he got accepted into college but dropped out and then was depressed and became an alcoholic. His parents would not take him in so he became homeless. He would steal booze from stores and he wanted to drink himself to death. I took him into my house and my boss was kind enough to give him a job and that is when he got his stuff together. About last September he told me that when I saw him on the subway he was getting ready to rob a liquor store and break the bottles and cut himself with them. I was shocked when I heard this and then he showed me our own high school yearbook and we had similar last names so he wanted to see how much we changed and to my surprise the Loch Ness Monster was in his place then I look up and see a 100 ft. tall monster saying \"Where's my tree fiddy you owed me back in 8th grade!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343675484", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

After that I'd either ride my board around or go home. This day I decided to ride my board around the neighborhood behind the shelter. I rode around for around an hour when I found an awesome hill. I love bombing hills, that's longboard lingo for going down a hill really fast. This hill called to me, but it was a long hill and would take me a while to get back up on foot. I knew if I went down it I would be late home. I texted my mom letting her know I stayed late to help clean out some of the cages so I'd have an excuse for being late. At this time it's around 7pm, or 7:30pm, that night is really fuzzy. I lined up my board, tightened my helmet, and flew down this unknown hill. I went faster than I ever had, it was terrifying. But something went wrong, I missed a small pocket in the road and my wheel got stuck. The momentum sent me flying. As I hit the road I felt a terrible pain shoot up my left food. I had sprained my foot on my descent. This was bad, how was I going to explain to my mom how I sprained my foot cleaning out animal's cages? I couldn't call her to pick me, she would know I lied and stayed out late. I couldn't stand on my foot either, so I was forced to use my board as an improvised crutch. After an hour of limping home it began getting dark. Now it's around 8:30pm and I'm in an unknown neighborhood, shit was scary dawg. I considered calling my mom, but being an immature 16 year old I thought sneaking in would be a better idea. When I was about a mile from my house I decided to take a break and relax. All of a sudden this dude grabs me and tries to put me in a choke hold. The only thing I could do was bite his arm. I bit that arm harder than anything in my life. After getting away from his grasp I picked up my board and trunk slapped him across his face (truck slapping is when you hit someone with the trunks on your board). I guess I hit him hard enough to knock him out, because he wasn't getting up but he was breathing. I called 911 immediately, but it was very difficult for me to help them. I was shaking and crying. The operator tried to calm me but I was losing it. I kept interrupting her while she was asking for the address, finally after I calmed down she told me she needed something, I asked what, and she told she needed about tree fiddy. It was at this time I realized my phone was 500 feet tall and from the mesozoic era ", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1343707823", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

You know by now we take our Quran seriously, that is why we believe in jinn over anything else supernatural. \n\nThe reason you're being downvoted is because it is irrelevant to what OP is asking for.
