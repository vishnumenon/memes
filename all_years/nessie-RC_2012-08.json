Isn't the Genesis chapter a good explanation for that time?\n\nI don't think I can consider it good, it's certainly understandable, though. I mean, it's a good explanation in the same way that Santa is a good explanation for the presents under a Christmas tree. If you don't know jack, and barely understand the world, it's an understandable belief. As far as the whole persecution of homosexuals (and other minorities) goes, it's largely the same thing. Their beliefs, likely fueled by perceived differences is understandable, though deeply misguided. And anyone clinging to those beliefs today deserves public condemnation.\n\n\n&gt;Wouldn't it be fucking awesome if everyone was tolerant about everyone's beliefs? Atheists would tolerate Christians and Christians would tolerate gays and so on and so forth.\n\nWhile we're making a list of things that won't happen, can we also add in peaceful aliens that just want to be our friends landing on Earth?

{"body": "There are a huge number of ghost, Loch Ness etc instances where people were wholly convinced that what they were seeing was true, only for it later to come out that they were being duped/hoaxed. I would say that currently I am not going to believe in most of these things. So far the overwhelming majority of these instances that I have read or heard about seem to have been hoaxers, or duped. This means that the few claimants of sound mind and body who have not been proven to be duped are the only ones we can consider.\n\nHowever comparing this to the concept of religions does not work. The possibility of Big Foot or the Loch Ness monster are bilogical species, and should be treated just like any other biolocical species. These two are not the only ones to have been rumoured throughout history, and at times rumoured species have turned out to be true, or a case of mistaken identity. However until evidence either supports a direct case of mistaken identity (sea manaties were mistaken as mermaids, and there are various reasons as to why this occured)  or shows it to be true [komodo dragon](http://tvblogs.nationalgeographic.com/2010/07/26/a-legendary-creature-that-turned-out-to-be-real/) it is a biological concept which is not yet at the theory stage.\n\n*These things do not really relate to the conversation when it comes down to it though. The real question is can sane people mistakenly start a religion.*\n\nWhat do you mean by that? To say that someone say something and thought it was a monster if very different to saying that someone was motivated to change their entire life by proclaiming a religion.\n\nI think that it would be impossible for someone to claim they are a manifestation accidentally, and reveal holy texts which align with previous holy books accidentally. There would have to be some motivation behind it, especially if they were persecuted. Why would they not recant their beliefs if they were punished and tortured. My issue is that a person would not do all of this and suffer so much when they are a rational being who accidentally started a religion. If they were doing all this and they had started the religion because they made a mistake they would take time out and think about things.\n\n**I'm not trying to say that a sane person proclaiming a message from God is proof. It is not. Each person must wholly investigate such claims and see for themselves.** \n\nHowever to dismiss it simply because they *could* be mistaken would be a mistake on our parts. The OP refers to historical record(which I have also had time to look at). If it is proven through historical record that the person exists, and that the persecutions(along with many other events) did take place then it is worth our time investigating it. I'm not saying that this is true over other faiths (The Baha'i faith believes that all world religions are from the same God.) However to dismiss any religion because you think that \"sane people are quite capable of misinterpreting events\" is separating out religion as not worth investigating simply because it is religion.\n\nIf someone claimed they had new evidence relating to the Loch Ness monster I would remain skeptical. However I would still investigate it, as it would be unfair to dismiss it out of hand.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344077167", "subreddit": "DebateReligion", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok this story is pretty old but man does it still give me the chills when I think about it.\n\nIt was the Summer of '06 and I was just about to enter 6th grade. It was the last weekend before school started so my cousin and I really wanted to finish the Summer with a bang. I spent the weekend over at his house. He lives in a very rural part of California. It's a very empty, \"hidden\" ranch which is surrounded by an orchard, more like a sea, of orange trees. Most nights it gets very foggy and the fog seems brings this certain eerie feeling along with it. \n\nThis occurrence happened on my first night there. Deep into the woods is this very dark, cloudy lake. We decided to go fishing there, which to we have only been to like 2 or 3 times before. This time it was different. We searched for and gathered all the necessary tools. We still had about 1 and a half, maybe 2, hours left of sunlight, but we decided to take a flashlight, just to be on the safe side. The way there was no problem. It took about 45 minutes to get there, longer than we expected. We weren't there for very long before it happened. We were fishing for about 5 minutes before it started getting really foggy. It was also starting to get dark. I told my cousin that I was getting a bad feeling and we should really start heading back. He said he also had a bad feeling then suddenly he stopped talking dropped everything staring over my shoulder. I turn around a see this shadowy outline of a tall, very slim man staring at us with red, fiery gleaming eyes. I dropped my shit and we got the fuck outta there. We just kept running, trying to escape this thing that we forgot about everything. Before we knew it, we had no idea where we fucking were. It was really foggy by this point and it was getting really dark. We left our flashlight AND our only cell phone at the lake. That's when this feeling takes over. You feel so helpless and terrified. I felt like I was going into shock. I looked over to my cousin and he just stares at me.

You don't have to care about it, that's your prerogative, but it doesn't have to stop you from understanding where others are coming from.\n\nAnother way of looking at a situation like this - where someone is making a solemn pledge about something - is to consider whether you, as an atheist, would be happy getting married in a church or similar. Could you make your vows of fidelity etc. to your (soon-to-be) spouse by saying such things as \"I promise before God, the merciful... In the eyes of the Lord... etc.\" and all that?\n\nNow, you *may* take the stance: \"What does it matter? It means nothing to me so it doesn't affect me to say stuff about \"God\". Get over it\" or similar. That's fine - good for you if that's your reasoning. But other people aren't so blasé about promises they make, particularly ones that are intended to hold a certain weight. I personally wouldn't be able to go through with a religious ceremony as the promises I would be making are not ones I believe hold water - they would mean nothing to me and I would essentially be lying. To be somewhat snide, it would be like promising to the Loch Ness Monster/fairies and so on. Meaningless and not respective of how important I would wish to hold such promises.\n\nTL;DR - There's more to it than \"A butch of crap that doesn't matter because I don't buy into that rubbish\".

When I pressed him further as to a good spot to see Nessie he said that the information wasn't something that was shared with tourists, but that Nessie was definitely real.

I was unsure as to whether I was being taken for a ride so I asked how much he wanted (I only had twenty pounds for the remainder of the trip).

When the bus would roll by and I didn't get off, she'd go up to my room and whine. When she figured out that I came home on certain holidays, she'd get really excited when she saw my parents breaking out the decorations and would wait on the porch for my return. It was on one of these holiday visits that I came home and she ran up to me and started talking to me. She said, \"Can I borrow tree-fiddy?\" Well it was just about this time that I realized that she was actually about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms.  She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet.  His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name.  Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.  \n\nJoe didn't give a shit.  He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either.  Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom.  His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\".  His name was now legally Adam Adams.  Why?  All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe,  my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it.  He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember.  But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage.  The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me.  Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son.  This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.  \n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on.  She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does.  My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.  \n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story.  She does.  Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words).  While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out. \n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved.  After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad.  I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story.  When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her.  She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again.

{"body": "So, I was walking down the street the other day, (I live in NYC) and I had to hop onto the R train headed uptown to 59th Street. I was going to meet some friends in Central Park. Now, I knew I was much too early for our meeting, so I popped into this little cafe to grab a cup of coffee. There, I saw one of my other friends (let's call him Rob) who I was meeting. So we got our cups, then decided to sit in the park for a little while before we were meeting the others.\n\nAnyway, Rob and I were sitting outside the Central Park zoo, watching the seals do their little show for the crowed gathered. We caught up on stuff we've been doing since we last hung out, and then decided to take a meandering path to our meet-up with the others. We were enjoying our time and whatnot. I got a craving for ice cream, so I grabbed an ice cream sandwich from one of those cart guys and ate it as we walked.\n\nNow, I've neglected to set the scene for you all. Its the middle of the summer, in a lull week after a heat-wave. The sun was shining with what couldn't be more than 5 clouds in the perfectly blue sky. The green trees were blowing slightly in the breeze, and the sounds of people enjoying the beautiful day added a nice subtle atmosphere to the park.\n\nSo Rob and I were walking, when suddenly a little boy runs after his ball in the path. I stop it with my foot and he looks up with his large, brown eyes. He seems a little scared to ask an adult for his red ball back, but he takes a breath and summons the courage. He says meekly, \"Excuse me, but can I get my ball back?\" Now, I've worked with children for a number of years, and Rob's cousins have some young kids, so we give a little laugh and want to play. So Rob says, \"It's ours now! It'll cost you ten dollars.\" The kid, obviously knowing we are playing says, \"That's too expensive! I need a discount because my birthday was last month.\" Rob and I laugh and so I say to the kid, \"So, how much can you afford?\" The kid gives a little look of mock calculation and says \"Well, I get $5 a week in allowance, but I only have $1.50 left. Since, I'm getting paid tomorrow, I can spare $6.50. But I only have a ten!\" Rob takes the ten, looks to me and says, \"Hey, Jorster, do you have tree-fitty?\"\n\nIt was at that point that I noticed that Rob wasn't actually my friend, but a 300-foot, thousand year old aquatic monster from the depths of a Scottish lake.

{"body": "Yes, people are all different, and do different things. We live in a mathematically chaotic system, and even minuscule differences might lead to very big differences in culture phase space.\n\nAnd a single bacterial mutation can also cause very large differences in world-wide populations.\n\nBut your premise - that prediction involving humans isn't possible - is wrong. Sometimes people are predictable. I started off by pointing out that traffic engineering is one of several fields where the aggregate behaviors of large numbers of people can be modeled, at least enough to improve traffic flow and reduce the overall number of accidents and fatalities.\n\nThe analogy in Foundation comes direct from statistical mechanics. Can you predict the motion of a single O2 molecule in a liter of air at STP over the span of a second? No. But you can make good statistical predictions, like the average velocity distribution of all of the molecules in that liter. And to do so, you need a large number of particles.\n\nGoing back to chaos theory, are there large-scale attractors in culture phase space? For example, humanity spent a long time as hunter-gatherers. A localized distribution - a volcano - can have devastating effects for the people living there, but it changes little of the overall flavor of the Paleolithic era. So while everyone on a particular planet might starve, there's still 25,000,000 other planets, and overall galactic culture doesn't change.\n\nI also think that forms of government are a sort of strange attractor in culture phase space.\n\nFoundation starts in about year 12,000 of the Empire, and 20,000 years in the future. As I recall, the culture is pretty stable, in part because the positronic robots are secretly preventing new technological development, so a Heisenberg or Fermi or Einstein equivalent wouldn't have the same cultural impact. (While I posit this as a reasonable argument during the time of the Empire, I think it breaks down with the idea that it can predict 30,000 years of 'dark ages'.)\n\nBut again, and to stress, actual events in the book deviate from the predictions of psychohistory. The equations of psychohistory are instead used to move events back to plan, and require much work on the part of the Second Foundation. Individual actions do play a role in making the future come out the way it does.\n\nIt's a literary conceit that psychohistory exists. It's used to justify extrapolating ideas from Gibbon's \"History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" in the future. It's hand-wavy and unjustified. You have to just accept it to read the story.\n\nHowever, I don't think you can outright reject it. We also don't know enough about the dynamics of people in general. Suppose you have a relatively stable culture, containing a quintillion people after another 20,000 years of technological and cultural development and scientific analysis. Since we know that some aspects of a large number of people are somewhat predictable already, how can you firmly say that more aspects won't be more predictable then?

{"body": "I assume that you're talking about the classic red blend, right?  (Cab Sauv, Merlot, Cab Franc, etc.).  Nessie's question is because Graves in Bordeaux which has great Sauv Blanc and Sauternes is in Bordeaux too.  Also, depending on which area in Bordeaux you're in (for reds), different varietals will dominiate.  Some might be Cab dominated blends, some are Merlot dominated blends, etc.  \n\nBut you're probably thinking of the generalized cab dominated blend?  The general problem with potato chips is that they are VERY salty.  Salt is one of the food characteristics that people generally think of for wine pairs (to balance food flavors).  Generally sweet goes well with salty, so a red blend is hard.  But if your task was to pair a \"potato chip with a Bordeaux\" you could technically get away with doing a Sauternes and, let's say, a spicy potato chip.  The spiciness and saltiness of the chip would be great with a sweet sauternes.  \n\nBut if your task is to find a chip to match a red blend, that's obviously much much harder.  Acidity and saltiness don't really go well together, and bordeaux needs good acidity for balance.  You might go for a fruit forward wine. I'd for go for a Napa red blend with descriptors like juicy, fruit-forward, jammy, etc.  \n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344445250", "subreddit": "wine", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt;Then why are we having this conversation? We're discussing when it's morally appropriate to discriminate against people. What form could discrimination possibly take other than legal prohibitions on doing things?\n\nErm, it could just be people saying 'I disagree with you because you force ridiculous views onto children when they're not able to decide for themselves.' Why does my disagreeing with a viewpoint or action automatically mean I want to legally ban it? You wouldn't say that if I were, say, a Catholic saying 'I disagree with what Orthodox parents pass onto their kids!' What, would you assume I then want to ban other religions? \n\n&gt;Or is your definition of discrimination \"saying bad things about people\"? I mean, in that case - feel free to discriminate however you want. I had made the -apparently faulty - assumption that discrimination would take the form of attempting to prevent the behavior you disapproved of.\n\n**\"Discrimination is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on his or her membership - or perceived membership - in a certain group or category\"**\n\nI don't agree with treating religious people like crap because of their beliefs. I don't agree with bashing, hating, or suppressing their views. I disagree with the views themselves, and if I hear of people forcing religion onto kids who don't know better, then I'll speak critically and say: I don't agree with that. Just like you would if you heard of a parent sending their kids to get brainwashed by some cult. Yeah I said it: from a non-believer's perspective, holding Christian beliefs or whatever is in no way different from believing in Bigfoot, Nessie, Santa et al. Believe what you want, but don't force it onto kids.\n\nAll I said was that indoctrination is bad, and that someone's counter-argument to why it isn't bad, was bad. Very bad. At no point did I say we should force people to do what I want. At no point did I 'discriminate' or 'say bad things' either.

I said \"Alright,\" and let out a sigh. I picked up the ant in my fingers. Right before I put it in my mouth, my friend opened his mouth to speak. \"WAIT, before you eat that, I need one thing!\" He said. \"WHAT?\" I said, annoyed. \"I need about tree fiddy.\" I then realized this was not my friend, but the 5 foot tall Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "&gt; Circumcision? Lack of alternative male contraception?\n\nFirst of all, they're working on the male pill, so cool your jets and hope it tastes like cinnamon. Second, circumcision isn't law. It's not right that *some* parents do it to babies when they can't protest it, just like baptism, assigning gender roles, or naming them \"Mortimer\". But it's not really comparable to the state denying freedom to mature intelligent autonomous adults who deserve respect.... and people named Mortimer, who, let's face it, you can't ever really respect.\n\n&gt; Being talked at like mindless violent rapists and paedophiles is so much better.\n\nFirst of all, props for the old-timey \"ae\" spelling of \"*pÆd*ophile\"! I feel like the word *pedophile* has lost a lot of its respectability in recent times, not sure why. I blame the spelling. Number B: most rapists and pedophiles are men. (Yes, I know your counter-argument: most babies are girls. But you can still usually tell if they're an actual baby or an adult woman.) And beyond that, individual men aren't *called* rapists and pædophiles. I'd bet my fortune no one's ever seriously called you a pædophile (or even a *ped*ophile). As for rapist, some women on the street might be silently cautious of the possibility of men being rape-tastic; with good reason, 1 in 6 women are raped. But men don't have women *verbalizing* such fears and disapproval as dehumanizing put-downs every day. They don't have women talking to them on the street or at work as if they were rapists, or calling them rapists, like women get called \"sweetie\", \"honey\" or \"baby\". Men can take subways and walk past construction sites without women gawking and shouting \"Hey rapiiiist, lookin' for a good time?\" If anything, it's all these men who talk sexually or demeaningly to women who are acting like rapists... verbally that is, not with the, y'know, rape portion.\n\n&gt; Equality quotas on simply entering a job meaning better qualified men being passed over for women.\n\nThe idea that Affirmative Action gives jobs to less qualified applicants is a common myth, much like the Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster, and the vastly underrated Loch Ness Sasquatch. This is a tragically underestimated fact... I mean, he's a sasquatch! Who can *swim*! Come on!! But I digress. For the most part, AA (the employment-related one that is, not the alcoholism group, the battery size, or — we were all thinking it — the classic 1992 computer game \"Ancient Anguish\") is about choosing the disadvantaged applicant when of *equal* qualification to an applicant who is both qualified and privileged. Especially in terms of gender, this is not a statistical concern for men. Per *Institute for Research on Poverty*: [\"results show some evidence of lower educational qualifications among blacks and Hispanics hired under Affirmative Action, but not among white women. [...] For the most part, Affirmative Action does not lead to the hiring of minorities or women with substantially lower qualifications or weaker job performance.\"](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irp.wisc.edu%2Fpublications%2Fdps%2Fpdfs%2Fdp111396.pdf&amp;ei=4cskUOS8K4Gy2QX73oHYBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHLuzmoFpiaSW16yv-VnZjbvgob8g&amp;sig2=ZaZ_f8lpd8c0EyGzC4XTWw) Then again, that's not what the racist dad in *American History X* said, and he was the dad on \"Boy Meets World\"... and how can you argue with Mr. Matthews?\n\n&gt; Only attractive women would ever run the risk of being treated as \"sexy livestock\", the very same thing happens to attractive men.\n\nIn the media and in real life, most women, even the ones who don't meet your standards for attractiveness, experience objectification and sexual harassment at a rate not even approaching that for men... I mean, er, well, I say objectification and harassment because I can only *assume* that's what \"sexy livestock\" means... unless it's some kind of 'furry' thing. Or maaaybe it means [state legislators literally referring to women as livestock, as their rationale for legislation forcing them to carry dead fetus corpses inside their bodies for months](http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2012/03/31/at-11th-hour-georgia-passes-women-as-livestock-bill/). Or, NO WAIT I GOT IT, maybe it just means sexualization of women in *conjunction* with meat products! In which case, [the Paris Hilton Carl's Jr. hamburger car wash ad](http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/24/news/newsmakers/carls_ad/)! She made livestock *hella* sexy, and she's not even that attractive! Case closed.\n\n&gt; Yes because men are rarely taken seriously when it comes to anything emotional [...] when they want to be a childs father...\n\nExactly! Like, even though most juries favour split custody if the child spent equal or less time with the child than the mother, apparently judges have the power to declare men \"not the child's father\", a power once previously the sole province of Maury Povich.\n\n&gt; the targets of false allegations\n\n*Exactly*. False rape allegations are a huge problem, even though the incidence of them by women against men aren't statistically insignificant... and I can only assume you meant rape, because that's the typical flashpoint of debate over false accusations of men; though we should also acknowledge, as a society, that men are the target of 99% of false *goatee* allegations. A soul patch is not a goatee, *ladies*!!!\n\n&gt; when they are victims of abuse\n\n**Exactly!** Don't you hate how if a man goes to the police with a case of abuse, the police just laugh in his face, slap him a few times, make fun of his shoes, and then toss him through a door sarcastically marked \"Important Crime Reports\" that actually leads to a back-alley with a brick wall. I mean, *so rude*! And it's not just with reports of domestic abuse; no, it's with crimes where the incidence of male victims is *above* negligible, too! Abuse against old men, young men, little boys, babies, all of it gets the old heave-ho thanks to the \"Cops Only Listen to Women Act\" of 1997. DAMN YOU CLINTON.\n\n&gt; PEOPLE have regarded uppity PEOPLE with contempt for generations, mostly because the vast majority of uppity people have it far better off than most, those who are suffering from real hardships don't have time to be uppity.\n\nCan't argue with that, I dare someone to try. Truly the greatest rethinking of history since Foucault and Marx combined to form *Farx*™. Obviously uppity folks like Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass, Thomas Jefferson, Thich Quang Duc, Mahatma Gandhi, Harvey Milk, Norma Rae, Erin Brockovich, Spartacus, Jesus Christ, Braveheart, Mad Max, Atticus Finch, Luke Skywalker, Tobey McGuire's character in \"Pleasantville\" — none of them were actually suffering or witnessing any *hardships*, or disadvantaged at all... otherwise they wouldn't have had *time* in their day to be uppity and rebellious!

{"body": "I am unfortunately not a taxi driver myself, but I did have possibly the most insane taxi driver *ever*.  So I guess this counts?  Definitely one of the freakiest experiences of my life.\n\nSo it's late (I want to say about four in the morning or so), and my friends and I are leaving a bar in NYC.  Usually we'd just take the subway since it was a pretty direct line from the station by bar to my friend's apartment, but we were with this one kid who liked to buy people shit when he was drunk, so we let him buy a cab for us.  We figured it would've been easier... boy, were we wrong.\n\nA cab pulls over, and everything seems normal enough.  I forget what he said his name was, but he was really chatty at first and seemed pleasant enough.  We told him the fastest way to get home would probably be down Broadway, and he was just like, \"No, shortcut, shortcut!\"\n\nSo he's going up some street I didn't recognize and he's continually trying to make small talk even though we're starting to doubt his \"shortcut\" was even a real thing.  Eventually, my one friend who lives in the city just yells at him and says, \"Sir, this *isn't* the way back to my apartment building.  You're going in the wrong direction.\"\n\nThe guy apologizes and makes a turn down a sketchier street. We're all starting to get really uncomfortable.  This is where shit hit the fan.  He makes another turn and there's a cop car parked along the side of the street.  Immediately upon seeing the cop car, he BOLTS.  He accelerates and goes straight through a stop sign and gets the **fuck outta there.**  The cop car immediately puts on his lights and follows us.\n\nWe're freaking out in the back, screaming at this dude to stop.  He's having a pseudo-panic attack and yelling at us, saying \"It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok!\"  But it's clearly not... he's zooming up and down back alleyways, going up the wrong way of a couple one-way streets, and just driving like an all-around maniac.  The cop is continuing to chase us, but we are gradually getting away.\n\nObviously, we're freaking out in the back of the cab.  Why the fuck did this taxi driver just go insane?  All I knew was that he just panicked when he saw the cop car, so something was *very, very* wrong.  For all I knew, we were going to be taken hostage or some shit.  Basically everyone was in the back pissing their pants.\n\nSo he drives extremely crazy for another fifteen minutes, and luckily there's not much going on in the street since it's 4:30am.  After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops).  We are all speechlessly freaked out at this point.  He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem.  The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\"  I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\"  So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon.\n\nThere we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem.  About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit.  We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still.  After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now.  Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\"\n\nWe just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible.  I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\"\n\nI nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something.  He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era!  I was like \"God damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\"  I was so pissed - and we had to walk all the way home from Spanish Harlem too!  UGH!!\n\n**tl;dr - Cab driver goes insane, gets chased by the cops, and abandons us in Spanish Harlem.**\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344645070", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 456, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This actually happened about 4 or so months ago and haunts me to this day.\n\nI was in the sketchier part of St. Louis after a Cardinals game. Most of my friends were drunk and I was kindly driving them back home, but first we had to hit up the bars. My one friend told me \"Hey I know a great one, just head up towards the riverfront and make a right.\" This leads me to a road that eventually turns into a dirt roads, that eventually turns into no road going across train tracks. This is looking bad, the entire wall next to us is covered in gang graffiti as far as the eye can see. We then go over a train track and pop, there goes the wheel. \n\nNo we are sitting on an abandoned road at 12 at night, with a flat. I was not staying there. I got into the trunk, brought out a flashlight and said \"You know where to walk, because we need to find a gas station.\" Luckily another friend wasn't too out of it and knew where we were on his phone's GPS. We had to walk about 3 miles on this sketchy road until we would find a gas station. So here we go on the scariest fucking journey of our lives.\n\nIt was about 12:30 when shit started to get weird. First, a dog ran by us. We don't know where it came from, we don't know where it went. But about 5 minutes later we hear a growl and a whimpering. We walk upon the dog with a huge bite mark across it's neck, dead. Now anything that did this was pretty big. The dog was a pretty big husky/mix I couldn't identify in the dark. But we had to keep going.\n\nGive or take another 5 minutes and we start periodically hearing this weird scratching noises. They are coming from behind the wall we are walking alongside. Imagine a dog scratching on a door x10. It was amplified by the river I guess, but it was loud and impossible to ignore. Then it suddenly stopped. I felt nervous, but we had to go on.\n\nOne of our friends decided he had to take a piss. He was drunk as shit so we let him. He wandered off to take a piss and then we hear a scream. We run to find him, but he was gone and we couldn't find him. Hoping he was just trying to scare us we laughed and yelled out his name. The bush rustled and a man popped out yelling. We all fucking ran to find out we had been trolled by our friend.\n\nSo we are still all scared shitless, but we have about .2 miles to the gas station, we can see the lights and our attitude was much better. That's when my friend points out (the same fucker to pop out of the bushes) that someone is following us. We all laugh and tell him that we aren't falling for it, when I look back and there is a man, maybe 200 feet behind us.\n\nI yell run and we all fucking sprint, but one of my friends falls. This is where I did the stupid thing and went back. I try and help him up but he sprained something, and it is hard for him to run. That is when the man catches up to us and screams out, \"I'm gunna need about tree fiddy.\" \n\nIt was at that exact moment that I realized the man chasing us was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\" I was so pissed I picked up my friend and we hobbled to the gas station and got my car fixed.\n\nTL;DR Flat tire in sketchy St. Louis, dog runs past us, .5 mile later same dog is dead with throat slashed.

{"body": "About 15 years ago I decided to open up my own restaurant in the city that I live. I went to cooking school and am a red seal chef. Food is my passion and I figured that this would be the best way for me to fully channel what I love to do.\n\nThe restaurant itself was made to offer a little of everything, focusing especially on spicy food, especially with chicken. When we first opened we were a small staff, myself and another cook who would make the food under me, my fiancee to seat and serve the clients and a few teenagers in the dish pit.\n\nWe advertised a little but we did not have a whole lot of money. We are from a pretty big city as well so it is not like we were the only restaurant in the city. So fair to say, we did not receive much exposure from our grand opening and on. \n\nFor the first year or so we were open, we struggled. We were barely able to stay alive, I was stretching out the loans I had taken out to help with th restaurant and I knew that we did not have much time before I would have to admit defeat, close down and find employment at one of the soul sucking chain restaurants in town.\n\nThat is until suddenly, one day, we served a vaunted food critic in the city. He ordered our chicken curry meal and I put every little detail into his plate. It came out, my fiancee served it to him and he ate every last drop of it. When he was done, he asked to see the chef. I just knew this was going to be our big break. He was going to let every one know about us and the great meals we made. So I went out to meet him. He shook my hand and said, \n\n\"You know, that was a fantastic meal. The best I have ever had. That being said I was just looking at my bill and I am afraid to say, I am going to be a bit short on change... can you spare about tree fiddy?\"\n\nWell it was around that time that I noticed that the food critic was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. I was pissed. I told him \"goddamn loch ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy, get out of my store!\"\n\nWe closed down the following week.\n\nTL;DR: Struggling restaurant, food critic visit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344685249", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 152, "controversiality": 0}

At my school you had the option to eat food pretty much wherever, but this kid would find his spot at the table and eat with his head down.\n\nHe transfered in during sophomore year and pretty much immediately alienated everyone when he tried to dance at the assembly, then broke down crying.  A couple nice girls tried to comfort him but it obviously just embarrassed him more, so after that we all just avoided the kid.\n\nHe was extremely pale, and half Asian I think.  He had these massive weight fluctuations that freaked people out, pretty sure an eating disorder was involved.  Maybe the worst part was how all of his equipment - his calculator, ruler, binder, backpack - had big labels with his name in bold capital letters.  I'm guessing his mom put them there.\n\nAnyways, I was at kind of a low point socially in Junior year, and I thought, I should go talk to this kid.  I walked over to his table and sat down next to him.  He was eating his bag lunch, it smelled pretty bizarre.  It was Waffle Day in the lunchroom, and so I offered my waffle to him.  He reluctantly took it and ate it, and I felt pretty good about myself.  Then he looked at me and said he needed one other thing.

For it's age, was an absolutely beautiful house, thanks to my dad being a contractor, he kept it in tip top shape. The house had a driveway which sloped down, towards the house, (Highest elevation being furthest from the house.) Right at the bottom of the driveway, there was a nice balcony overhead on which I would sit and eat my lunch, enjoying watching the passing cars and passing neighbours. Anyway, it was a Saturday like any other, and my mom had made tacos for dinner, as I finished up my dinner, I walked over to my room and began playing some video games (whatever was popular at the time.) After playing for a good hour or so, my mom comes into my room, and announces that it's bedtime. I protest a bit, but eventually succumb to her persistent nagging. I get into my race car bed (lucky, right?) and try to fall asleep. But I couldn't. I just couldn't fall asleep. I stayed awake, tossing and turning in my bed for about an hour and a half, at which point everyone was asleep and I got rather restless, so I got up. I sneaked out of my room and went to the only place that I enjoyed being. The balcony. I walked through the living room, trying not to make a sound, as I approached the balcony door, I noticed something strange. There was something moving on the balcony. It's movement was very fluid. Almost human like. I could see that it wasn't the patio chairs or tables. Being the curious 4 year old I was, I went out to investigate. I stepped out on the patio and to my surprise, it was a ghost! The ghost didn't notice me there. When it finally did, it turned to me and said \"Little boy,  do you have any money?\" and I said \"How much do you need?\" and the ghost replied with it's booming voice \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about then that I realized that this wasn't a ghost, it was a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era! So I said to him \"I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!

I was somewhat of a shy child and had difficulty expressing emotions. I had noticed this one girl in my photography class (yes, my school had a photography class; including a dark room) and it just so happened that she had noticed me. \n\nThe weeks went on and the flirting continued. We were learning a lot in class about everything from polarized filters to depth of field. It was a challenging class but I knew that my time was soon to come. Finally, the class started on the portion of learning where I knew my chance would present itself. Developing our own black and white photos. \n\nThe teacher had us all grouped together and my heart almost went through my chest as I saw she was in my group. I didn't know what to do. I played it cool, of course, well...as cool as a seventh grader with a crush could \"be cool\". \n\nThe day was near and the time had come. We had captured our images on our film with our cameras. We had wound our film back into their light protecting cases and removed the canisters from our camera. It was at this time that we then entered the light blocking revolving door to the dark room. We had been flirting with one another pretty heavily and stood next to each other in the dark room. The lights were turned off for us to remove our film and wind it onto the reels. We both worked quickly in order to save some time with the lights off for a kiss. It was subliminal. We finished our kiss and the lights came on, when suddenly I looked up and all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era, comes out of the water. I said, \"what do you want from us, monster?\" And the monster bent down and said, \"I need about tree-fitty\"\nI said, \"I ain't givin you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!

{"body": "I was at the train station, a quarter past midnight. The moon was full, casting it's luminous light down upon me. I gazed across the hall at my lover. Our eyes locked, I felt increasingly aroused. I winked; following with a bright smile. She got up and seductively walked towards me, hips swinging, her hair as cute as ever, even well into the night. She was only a foot from my head. I grinned. Her striped shirt outlined her figure perfectly, and her jeans were aligned to her body. She wasn't wearing makeup, and had a perfectly natural look. Her eyes twinkled in the twilight. Her luscious brown hair fell around her shoulders. I looked deeply into her dark brown eyes. She gazed back. \n\"I've been waiting for you.\" she said, biting her lip slightly. \n\"Then let the waiting end.\" I smiled. She pulled my shirt, her fingers lingering for a moment on my abs. We kissed, my lips locking on hers, our tongues touching inside each others mouths. I opened my eyes, and pulled away, gently. She smiled at me, her near-perfect staring into my eyes. Her freckle near her nose complimented her fair complexion perfectly. \n\"Ready for more?\" I said, taking her hand as we boarded the train. \n\"Oh, yes babe,\" she said, pacing with me to the doors, \"but first you must promise me something. \"\n\"Anything, my love,\" I said, sweeping her golden-brown hair back behind her ears.\n\"I need you to protect me,\" she said as we boarded the train. We shared a seat as the car advanced down the tracks, glimpses of the moonlit city passing us by. \" I need your assurance that you will never let me go,\" \n\"Emily, darling, I will always be by your side. Whenever you need me, I shall be there,\" I said, looking down into her smiling face. \"I promise\"\n\"Oh, Jack!\" she said, her eyes glittering at me with hopes of our future adventures together. Our train arrived at the station nearest my apartment, and we sauntered towards the building. \n\"Jack, dear, there is but one more thing I have to ask of you,\" she said, stopping us directly outside a coffee shop. \n\"Anything, my love,\" I gently whispered to her. \n\"I'm going to need about tree fiddy\".

(I swear I didn't mean for that to rhyme.)\n\nBack in my sophomore year of high school I started hanging out with this new girl that had just moved into our school. She was in a few of my classes, we were both in a gold seal design program which would help us get scholarships for college much easier. Anyway, she was really nice, kind of quiet but she had a very sweet face. We started hanging out, usual stuff teens do, go to the movies, the mall ect. It was fun but I quickly noticed she was starting to see me as her \"gay friend\", as in she would tell me who she thought was cute and blabber on about her day all the time. It got annoying because I thought I had made it clear that I actually liked her. She didn't seem to take the hint and just treated me the same way. My friends told me I was stuck in the friendzone and if I wanted out I just had to confront her and tell her that.\n\nSo a few days later we went to the mall again, it was then I realized she was basically using me to help carry her bags and stuff and that kind of had me pissed as I was already starting to reach my breaking point. We stopped to grab some dinner at the food court and I figured now would be the best time, trust me I realize a confrontation in the middle of a public area is completely unclassy but give me a break I was in high school. So after we sat down I told her that I was tired of being her gay friend, that I wanted something more then to just be her friend. She looked up from her food at me and asked me if I really wanted to be out of the friend zone she was just going to need one thing from me. What could that one thing possible be I asked?\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized this girl was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

The last time I moved it was an absolutely horrible experience...\n\nI don't want to disclose the name of the moving company because I'm sure that would be mean and I'm sure the guy that helped us would lose his job, and in this down economy it would be horrible to do that. Anyway the guy, let's call him Dave, anyway Dave showed up almost an hour and a half after the time we had scheduled with his company. After the first fifteen minutes of waiting my Mom and I just started to organize and move all the furniture ourselves out onto the lawn for easier access to pack into the truck when it got to our house. That's where we made our first mistake, now I can't say this is Dave's fault it's honestly our fault, but the sprinklers turned on and soaked ALL of our furniture. So definitely make sure your not putting your furniture where it can get wet. When Dave finally does show up he barely helps us load anything into the truck and actually eats almost half of the pizza that we had ordered to feed my Mom and myself. \n\nSo after the truck is completely loaded I give Dave very simple instructions, we were only moving a few towns over and it really only took 20 to 30 minutes on a bad traffic day to get there. He told us he had to stop for gas real quick, which was in itself bad because shouldn't he have done that before he came to the house, especially with being late as he already was. After we locked up the old house and herded our dogs into my car we drove over there ourselves. It took us ONLY 15 minutes to get there. \n\nMy mom however accidentally packed the keys to the new house in one of the boxes in the truck so we were sitting there waiting for him to get there and it was already a ridiculously humid day outside at this point. When Dave finally does get to the house he makes some crap joke, something like \"Oh happy to see me?\" I don't know I wasn't really in the mood. Luckily this time Dave actually helped us get MOST of the stuff off the truck but didn't help with ANY of the furniture which really worked my mom to the bone. After we finish Dave just waits by his truck. I had already told him thanks, as sarcastically as I could manage, but he just seemed to be hanging out out there. When I went to figure out what he wanted it became clear.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized Dave was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. I was fucking pissed. \"God damn loch ness monster I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" Before I could yell anymore he was escaping down the street.\n\nTL:DR- Make sure the moving company you use actually has a good reputation and isn't going to put you behind schedule.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344775111", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -2, "controversiality": 0}

I couldn't bring myself to leave him there, so I invited him to have dinner with my family. He turned out to be a great man, and was very nice to my family. I got my son, who is a chef, to cook a nice meal for him. He kept making the kids laugh, and my wife also thought he was hilarious. I started to grow a connection with this man.\n\nMy 2 little girls both asked if he could stay the night, so I agreed to let him stay in the guest bedroom. He was incredibly polite and cleaned up the room for us before we all woke up.\n\nThe family decided to take him out to a carnival where we all had a blast. After the carnival I offered to let him stay another night, but he denied and kindly said \"I cannot continue to take from you, I must leave.\" My family was brought to tears and we exchanged hugs with him. Right before he left he asked \"Can I have one more thing?\" I said \"Sure, anything!\" He said \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment I realized that the homeless man was actually a 7-story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era! It was the Loch Ness Monster! I said \"Goddamnit Lock Ness Monster, I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" Boy was I pissed.

Assessing likelyhood of a claim in light of what is already known is a big part of the scientific process. The claim that a myth originated 2 million years ago and somehow survived despite the fact that there wasn't any oral transmission for most of those 2 million years is extremely unlikely. \n\nIf you want anyone to even consider that you'd better have at least some evidence that makes it more likely. \n\nYou prove that yourself: Wegener's continental drift idea was dismissed because initially he didn't provide any evidence to support his claim beyond \"look how the silhouettes of the continents seem to fit to each other\" and he didn't provide a plausible mechanism (he claimed the continents \"plowed\" through the ocean bassins; this claim was dismissed after it had been calculated that this was physically impossible). Nevertheless, Wegener proceeded to collect data and other scientists started to investigate, too. After a different, plausible mechanism was found, and more evidence came in, plate tectonics became the accepted theory. Note, how this is a different theory from the one Wegener proposed. \n\nFor every idea that later turned out to be (at least in parts) correct, there're thousands that are just bunk.\n\nBtw, some more mythical creatures: The Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, Yeti, \"little green man\", Leprechauns, Fairies\n\nThink we should believe all these exist?

{"body": "Mine is something I regret to this day...\n\nSo I was studying abroad in Australia and I was pretty bored, my Aussie roommate and his live-in girlfriend were out visiting family, so I was alone in the apartment for the night.\n\nNow so far this trip didn't match my expectations, I was expecting surf, sand, hot Australian girls and a generally cosier feel, but living and studying within the city by Chinatown didn't really match it. I wasn't too fussed, I'd only been there for a week so I though \"Oh well, plenty of time to see around!\". \n\nBy 8pm I was bored out my fucking mind though, why the fuck had I left my life to come sit around a fucking apartment, so I thought fuck it, I'd head out to Kings Cross, the clubbing district (didn't know much about it) and check it out. I thought I should pre-drink a little so I had a little vodka, put the rest in a flask and was on my way!\\\n\nSo I walk about 20-25 minutes and I'm there, it's bright, shiny, , people are everywhere, no reason a handsome, young foreign student couldn't find some friends! I walk around and try a place, \"Sorry mate, need to be wearing dress shoes and a collared shirt\". \n\nAlright no biggy, I'll try the next place.\n\n\"Sorry mate, need to be wearing dress shoes and a collared shirt\". \n\nEventually after trying out all the decent looking clubs I gave up, nowhere would let me in with some Khaki's and a tee. \nI'm about to leave when I spot a girl on a bench. She was stunning; one of those girls that really sticks out in a crowd, a girl that makes you do a double take because you couldn't believe your eyes the first time, and she was alone. By this point I was completely fucked though, having drunk the 10 shot flask I had brought with me, in between humiliating club rejections.\n\nSo I sat with this girl and started chatting with her, she could tell I was drunk and asked where my friends were, I said I came alone and was feeling annoyed because I couldn't get in anywhere. \nWhat she said next will stick with me forever.\n\n\"I know something that will cheer you up\" \n\nShe flashed me a seductive smile and tells me to follow and next thing I know were in a building, she starts listing random numbers and I realize \"Holy shit, she's a hooker\". So she asks if I want anything and my inebriated mind said \"Yeh sure how about a bj\", she said okay \"$150\". \n\nI put the money on the table and away we went, about a minute or two into it I got the insatiable hornyness that kicks in after a night out drinking, \"Fuck it bro, money aint shit, fuck her!!!\".\n\n So I ask how much for full service and she says \"Well you're cute, so I'll do it for an extra $150\", I agree and we start getting to it. \n\nNow I had been with this girl for about 2 hours now, chatting for half of it and now fucking, so I drunkenly thought maybe I knew her well enough to make a joke.. Big mistake.\n\nSo I look her straight in the eyes, breath out, put on the most serious expression I can and say to her, \n\n\"Hey sorry, I know I should've maybe said this before, but I'm actually HIV positive and the doctor said theres a 50-50 chance of transmission with oral sex\"\n\nShe. Freaked. The. Fuck. Out.\n\nI've never seen a change in emotion like that before, she starts screaming and gets off straight away, falling to her knees and scream crying. Next thing I know 2 Maori bouncers come in, and rip me out of the bed, pants still around my ankles and take me into a small room, all the while people are coming out of the brothel rooms and screaming what happened. \n\nI'm sitting there, completely naked and a police officer walks in, this is when I knew I was in trouble, he questioned me for a while and I kept saying I was joking but apparently the hooker accused me of rape and  had a black eye (must've been makeup). \n\nAfter about 15 minutes of naked questioning he says to me \n\n\"Okay, don't fucking move, I have to go ask her some questions, theres nothing funny about this buddy\".\n\nAnd by now I am freaking the fuck out, my phone was in my pants and it was 3am by this point. After sitting in the chair for what felt like an hour the police officer finally comes back and says I need to go with him, so I put my pants back on, get handcuffed and put into the wagon, all the while a symphony of \"why, fuck, why!\" is sounding in my head. \n\nI fell asleep pretty quickly in the holding cell and woke up in the morning to a cop saying my name and motioning for me to leave the cell. He directs down a corridor to an interrogation room and when he opens the door I get the surprise of my life.\n\nThe hooker from last night was there with my arresting officer, she had admitted to making the black eye herself and exaggerating her statement due to shock, the policemen told me I wouldn't face charges and could leave. \n\nAs I was leaving the hooker spots me and yells out \"Hey gunnersaur, can I give you a lift\". Normally I wouldn't accept a lift from an accuser, but I had no fucking idea where I was so I accepted.\n\nWe got to talking in the car again and actually started to get along, eventually we went to get lunch and had an awesome day and later went back to my place to finish off what we started (on the house this time). \n\nSo we start going at it again and all of a sudden she slows down and looks me in the eyes, and says to me, with eyes like the ocean after a storm, skin like milk and honey and the voice of an angel \"I need about tree fiddy\". Thats when I realized this girl was about 8-stories tall and a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era. So she barged out of the room balcony and swam off into the distance, and that is the worst thing(s) ever said to me during sex.\n\nTL;DR: Bored at home, met girl, was a hooker, faked AIDS, tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344868980", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 56, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I think the first time I questioned my moms intelligence was the first time I had to go to Lowe's with my dad. My dad is a realtor and owns several houses as investment properties that he rents out. In order to keep the cost low on them my mother and him do most of the work on the houses themselves. From the time I was 10 or 11 and my brother was 13 or 14.  My brother and I just went straight to the houses to work, mainly painting jobs or fixing screens, you know simple stuff. \n\nSo the first time my dad took me with him to Lowe's he wanted to pick up some extra stuff other than paint and such. My grandpa had given him a list of stuff he would need to fix up the kitchen since the last tenants had completely busted in the counter tops and the sink was almost unrecognizable. I should clear it up by saying often times the tenants they rented out to were not the most, distinguishable people you would want living in something you owned. \n\nWe got to Lowe's and my Dad let me carry the list, I was 13 and I felt awesome that my Dad was giving me such a responsibility. We were going up and down isles getting stuff on the list but my dad was also putting other stuff in the cart to, chains and stuff that I had no idea what they were for. I knew for a while that my mom and him kept a very specific budget when they were fixing up the houses so I wasn't sure what he was getting all this extra stuff for.\n\nWhen we got up to the cashier I knew we were over the budget and something felt off about this whole excursion. The cashier was ringing up the items. I looked at the total and then thought about the amount I had overheard them agree on for this project and I was even more suspicious.\n\n\"Wait a second.\" Was all I could say.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\" At this point I realized my dad was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era. I was fucking pissed. \"God damn loch ness monster I ain't givin you no tree fiddy!\" Before I could yell anymore he had taken the cart of stuff and ran out of the store.\n\nI later found my dad tied up in the trunk of my car with no memory of how the heck he even got there.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344888099", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Holy shit. I've seen something crazy similar to this before.\n\nI was at the local ammusement park, I remember I was about 13, and Just ecstatic to be running around and riding all the rides.. I remember being very excited to play one of those basketball games, where you win the 3/4 size basketballs. You know the one's that they have the hoops oval shaped so you can't win? Anyways, I remember bothering my  friend Joe, to lend me a few extra bucks so I could take a shot. so we were sitting there talking about how I wouldn't win, and how it's a waste of money either way. \n\nMoving on. We decided to go ride some more rides for a while, and maybe take a shot at it before we left. We ended up in line for the big power tower ride. One of those rides that has the seats around a huge cell phone tower like thing, and launches you to the top, and drops you.  And I remember there being a big guy in front of us. Three spaces in front of us. We made eye contact briefly. He sort of just stared through me.. but AT me. He was wearing jeans and a heavy black hoodie. Which was weird. Because this is the middle of june, it's hot out, and \"why would you wear that?\" I remember thinking. Anyways, we went on the ride a few times, kept circling around to go again. and each time, this guy would end up in front of us, and each time, he would be 3 spaces in front of us. Even though people would get off, and what was weird, he would go alone. \n\nBeing 13, and easily spooked, we decided it was best to go ride another of our favorites, the big rollercoaster there. So we exit the line, leaving this guy in line, and walk across the food court to the new ride. \n\nThis is where it gets creepy. \n\nIt's a straight shot to this other ride, and you can see the line to the power tower across the way. In other words, we could see the guy still in line by the time we got there. So we get in line, wind around the railings a bit, and continue through to the end of the line.. We get there, and again.. exactly 3 spaces in front of us, The same damn guy. This time he is staring at us the whole time. Really creeping us out. It was getting late, and We decided to call my friends mom to come pick us up.. because this was WEIRD.\n\nWe got on the rollercoaster hesitantly, and sat as far from him as we could. As the ride finished, We got off, and scrambled by him, to be out the gates before him, and head out. That's when he looked directly at us, then quickly took a step to the side. Held out his hand at one of the attendants. And the attendant hit the floor.\n\nNow this is the level where everyone is getting off, and people are getting in the cars. there are lots of people around. Everyone saw, another 2 attendants rushed to the guy who hit the deck, and lifted his head. he was stiff. He was ok, but his body was stiff. Everyone was looking at me and my friend with a \"what the hell did you do?!\" look. We look around. the guy is just gone. Nobody left, you would be able to see them walking down the exit ramp, which was fairly long. he was just GONE. \n\nAt this point, because me and my friend were right next to him, We helped lift him, up, and everyone started to continue on with their own business, and began leaving down the ramps. As we were talking with the attendant who hit the deck, he seemed.. really phased. his eyes were completely dilated, and he just spoke very softly It seemed he was missing words every few seconds. he didn't see anyone there. Neither did any of the other attendants. \n\nAfter a bit we got a call from Joe's mom, saying she was there, and to meet her out front, so we boogied on out of there. As we were leaving, we walked by that basketball game again. We figured we had time to try and win, We had a few dollars left. why not. So we buy 3 shots, and Joe decides he paid, he'll shoot. he misses the first two. He's about to take the last shot, and he looks over at me and goes dead pale. I ask him  \"what's up, man?\" and he stares right behind me. I look over my shoulder. There's the guy. even bigger now that he's so close. He stands there, and stares at us for what felt like a solid minute.. So long that the attendant at the hoop game asked \"can I help you\" And he turns to me and in a voice I'll never forget, says \"Hey, got tree fiddy?\"\n\nThen I saw it, He was a motherfucking 40 foot tall Plesiosaur. God damnit nessie. I'll never forget that day.. Also my friend missed the last shot. figures. \n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344908889", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 15, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a comment from \"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y0vpi/any_taxi_limo_or_bus_drivers_on_here_if_so_what/\"\n\n[–]charbok 459 points 3 days ago\nI am unfortunately not a taxi driver myself, but I did have possibly the most insane taxi driver ever. So I guess this counts? Definitely one of the freakiest experiences of my life.\nSo it's late (I want to say about four in the morning or so), and my friends and I are leaving a bar in NYC. Usually we'd just take the subway since it was a pretty direct line from the station by bar to my friend's apartment, but we were with this one kid who liked to buy people shit when he was drunk, so we let him buy a cab for us. We figured it would've been easier... boy, were we wrong.\nA cab pulls over, and everything seems normal enough. I forget what he said his name was, but he was really chatty at first and seemed pleasant enough. We told him the fastest way to get home would probably be down Broadway, and he was just like, \"No, shortcut, shortcut!\"\nSo he's going up some street I didn't recognize and he's continually trying to make small talk even though we're starting to doubt his \"shortcut\" was even a real thing. Eventually, my one friend who lives in the city just yells at him and says, \"Sir, this isn't the way back to my apartment building. You're going in the wrong direction.\"\nThe guy apologizes and makes a turn down a sketchier street. We're all starting to get really uncomfortable. This is where shit hit the fan. He makes another turn and there's a cop car parked along the side of the street. Immediately upon seeing the cop car, he BOLTS. He accelerates and goes straight through a stop sign and gets the fuck outta there. The cop car immediately puts on his lights and follows us.\nWe're freaking out in the back, screaming at this dude to stop. He's having a pseudo-panic attack and yelling at us, saying \"It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok!\" But it's clearly not... he's zooming up and down back alleyways, going up the wrong way of a couple one-way streets, and just driving like an all-around maniac. The cop is continuing to chase us, but we are gradually getting away.\nObviously, we're freaking out in the back of the cab. Why the fuck did this taxi driver just go insane? All I knew was that he just panicked when he saw the cop car, so something was very, very wrong. For all I knew, we were going to be taken hostage or some shit. Basically everyone was in the back pissing their pants.\nSo he drives extremely crazy for another fifteen minutes, and luckily there's not much going on in the street since it's 4:30am. After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops). We are all speechlessly freaked out at this point. He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem. The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\" I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\" So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon.\nThere we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem. About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit. We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still. After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now. Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\"\nWe just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\"\nI nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\"\nIt was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\" I was so pissed - and we had to walk all the way home from Spanish Harlem too! UGH!!\ntl;dr - Cab driver goes insane, gets chased by the cops, and abandons us in Spanish Harlem.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344917442", "subreddit": "southpark", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh I have a good one,\nI work at a crappy pizza joint in a busy part of town, and I never had a problem with any of my coworkers. But one day, \"Bob\" (not real name) comes in to work and he's acting all strange. Before he was a bright, likable, all around happy guy. On this day, he has the heart and soul of my ex girlfriend. Non-existent by the way. He didn't talk to us, he didn't crack a smile for that whole day. Which to us was very very strange. I've known bob for around about 4 years, and worked with him for 3 of those years. Not once have I or anyone else seen him like this. But I brush it of thinking he has just had a bad day at home or something. His attitude goes on for around about 3 months and by then I'm sick of it. I confront him and say \"what's up with you? Why have you been acting so different?\" he responds with a shrug and keeps working. I keep trying to persuade him to tell me what's going on, then he finally says, \"look have dinner with me and my wife and then I can show you that I'm fine.\" I'm shocked at this point because this is the most I've seen him talk in the last 3 months. So after my shift I go   home and put on my best suit and drive to bobs house. When I arrive I'm surprised to see the door of his house ajar. I waltzed in to find bob sitting on his recliner reading the paper. Then his wife walks in and greets me. His wife asks bob what he wants for his drink. He says \"could I have a lemonade?\" then I kid you not she replies with \"Could I have tree fiddy for that drink?\" then I finally realized for the last 3 months  bob was 300 foot plesiosaurus from the Mesozoic period. I screamed out \"OH DARN IT BOB\" and fumed out.

{"body": "I have severe Aspergers, and let me tell you this crazy awkward story from my high school years when I was super socially awkward penguin:\n\nIn my high school, only juniors and seniors were allowed to buy tickets to prom.  It wasn't to socially isolate the sophomores and freshmen or anything, but it was sort of about socially isolating the sophomores and freshmen.  Anyhow, the only way you could get to prom as an underclassman was to be invited by a junior or senior.  It was easy for the girls -- men are so oppressed in today's society -- but a lot harder for the men.\n\nNow, I was a pretty awkward high schooler.  I was 6'2\" and 185 pounds of rock solid muscle.  I had a part-time job as an Abercrombie Model and another part-time job as a personal trainer.  I was pretty much the definition of butthurt basement dweller, and I spent all my time toking up to about a [8.5] and watching Cosmos.  Nobody really liked me because I was openly atheist and bisexual.  It was a really hard, dark time in my life; I was picked on for being the most handsome, bullied for being the smartest, and constantly harassed by the Amerikkkan Police State for my harmless interest in dating Mary Jane (euphemisms are so smart).\n\nSo sophomore year of high school, I didn't expect to go to prom.  I was too smart, too bold, and too handsome for anyone to take me.  I figured I'd just get bullied.  But I was at my locker one day after my remedial algebra class when one of the smoking hot juniors on the cheerleading squad comes up to me.  She was probably 5'2\" and 115 pounds of the tightest body you could ever see.  She had red hair and green eyes (but not a ginger, because they have no souls) and tits like whoa (double D's for sure).  I couldn't figure out why she would want to talk to me and I popped my 9-inch boner as soon as she started walking up to me.  Her name was Genevieve.\n\n\"Hey, you're that weird kid with Aspergers, right?\"\n\nI swallowed really hard. \"Yeah, I guess I am.\"\n\n\"Well, I just got made the captain of the cheerleading squad.  But the initiation for captainship is that I have to take out the nerdiest loser in the school to prom and then fuck his brains out after.  Would you come to prom with me?\"\n\nI literally shit my pants with excitement as I shouted \"Oh Sagan almighty yes! I will go to prom with you!\"\n\nShe seemed disgusted that I had shit my pants and was genuinely displeased, and averting her eyes said, \"okay, go clean yourself up.  I'll send you details later.\"\n\nI went home and jacked off about five times, each time with increasing intensity until I was whacking it with the force of Xerxes' Persian invasion.  It was glorious.  Just as I'd finished for the sixth time, I heard my doorbell ring.  I went downstairs and opened the door.  It was Genevieve.\n\n\"Hey, I realized I don't have your e-mail address, so I have to ask you some stuff in person about prom.  Do you mind wearing red flowers?\"\n\nI had a raging erection, so I knew I'd be going for a seventh whack after this. \"Red flowers are fine.\"\n\n\"Awesome.  Do you mind if we go with my cheerleading friends?\" she asked next.  Then she leaned in and whispered, \"some are going without dates... threesome potential!\" and gave me a sexy look and a wink.  Double boner!\n\n\"Sounds great!\"  I said.\n\n\"Awesome.  As a last thing, about the tickets and limousine... I need you to chip in a little bit for them.  Just about tree fitty.\"\n\nAnd it was right then that I realized Genevieve wasn't a 5'2\", smoking hot huge-titted red-haired cheerleader, but was a six-story crustacean from the Paleolithic area!  God damnit, Nessie had tricked me again!\n\n\"Oh god damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you tree fitty! Get the fuck outta here!\"  I shouted.  I ran back into the my house grabbed a broom from my front hall closet, went back to the front door and began swinging the broom wildly.\n\nBut it was too late.  I'd already missed my opportunity. Spaghetti everywhere, etc. etc.\n\nAnd that's why I never went to prom.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344957037", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 681, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I was a pretty awkward kid in high school. I also didn’t have many friends, and the ones I did I would hardly call friends. So needless to say confidence was lacking pretty bad. And that made it pretty tough with the ladies.\nUntil one day I met this girl in my Algebra 2 class my junior year. She was amazing. She was beautiful, fun, and one of the sweetest girls I have ever met. But I didn’t dare ask her for her number. After all, she was way out of my league, and practically half the guys in the school wanted her. But I have no Idea what got into me at that exact moment, but I just blacked out and did it. And it turned out for the best. With a huge smile on her face she typed her number into my rinkedy dink phone. When I came to I could do nothing but smile and internally laugh at myself.\nI text her that night, and actually get a response. I was astounded. We talked all through the night about sports, videogames (she loves StarCraft) and anything and everything else. This became a regular occurrence between her and me. We began to hang out outside of class, at first with her friends, but then just her and me. I could feel that there was something amazing between us. Just the way she talked to me like I was a normal person. Like I was someone special. It was so foreign to me, but so amazing.\nThen one night while watching a movie (I think it How to Train Your Dragon), she turns to me and kisses me on the cheek. That night I asked her to be my girlfriend and had my first kiss. We would go on to date for all of our junior and senior year. Until I messed up. Big time.\nWe were hanging out with her going to be college roommate (we were both headed to Oregon State University), who kept looking at me funny. Then about a week later I got a text from the roommate. We just talked about college and other stuff. She was a nice girl. Or so I thought. One day she asks if I want to hang out. I was down, and my girlfriend busy but was ok with it. We weren’t going to do anything stupid. She comes over, and we’re hanging out playing Rockband. After a few songs she comes and sits next to me and we just talk. But then it heads into a dark place. She starts telling me about how her father is never there and her mother is an alcoholic who is never around to do anything. I try and change the subject, but she keeps bringing it back until she starts to whisper things into my ear. Dirty things. I push her away, but she tackled me and straddles me. So we are lying on the ground with her on top of me when my girlfriend walks in (I later found out she had gotten of work early and came to hang out with us.) My girlfriend screams, kicks her in the face and slaps me across the face as I stand up. “What the hell BKA93? My roommate? My roommate, seriously?” I try to explain to her that I didn’t do anything, but the roommate denies everything and says it was mutual. So we all just sit there in silence. My girlfriend is sitting on the ground sobbing her eyes out. I sit down and put my head in my hands and feel a tear run down my face and into my hands. I could feel this wasn’t going to end well. This girl I loved was going to break up with me, and I would be left with nothing, like I was before I met her. This goes on for what seemed like an eternity, until my girlfriend breaks finally the silence. “BKA93, I need something from you.” “What is it? I’ll do anything. I just don’t want to lose you.” “I-I… I ne- I need… I need about tree fity.” And that’s when I realized she was a towering, 20 foot high lake beast. My girlfriend had been the Loch Ness Monster the whole time. “I need about tree fity from ya.” I stood there in shock, unable to comprehend what I had just seen. Until I came to my senses and said “Shoo Loch Ness monster! Shoo! I ain’t got no tree fity for ya!” She left and I yelled after her “An’ don’t come back!”\nTL;DR: The people you love aren’t always who they seem to be.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1344978622", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Several summers ago my friends and I had visited Saint Augustine in Florida on a roadtrip. All in all it was an entertaining little vacation - snuck down for a few days, smoked some grass, drank way too much, woke up on weird beaches. \n\nGenerally, it was a grand old time. \n\nOne night, though, one of my buddies, who I had known since the first grade, brought out his special valise. It contained several hits of high powered acid. He placed two on his tongue and encouraged us all to imbibe. Me, being ever the adventurist, decided to indulge his request. \n\nWe meandered around the historic town center for a considerable amount of time. We were so high that I'm surprised we didn't try to skinny dip in the moat by the Castillo de San Marcos or break off some bits of coral from the ancient masonry in the town. Indeed, it seemed to be a fair number of hours as I could see the sun beginning to peak up beyond the horizon to our east, out by the sea. \n\nWell, the grass we had smoked at some point during our trip was leaving us all quite parched. It being time for breakfast, we dove into a nearby Waffle House and indulged heartily in plate after plate of crispy bacon and gallons of orange juice. Finally, the time came to pay our bills. We all went to the front, but my friend with the blotter paper informed us that he needed to take a piss break.\n\nWell, fifteen minutes pass and we see no sign of our pal. I, being the sort of unofficial errand boy of the group, shrug and take on the unenviable task of going to retrieve him. As I near the door, I hear sobbing. Moving quickly, I slithered through the door as I opened it but a sliver to find my friend with his head in his hand, sobbing his heart out. \n\nI asked him what was the matter. He was one of my oldest and dearest friends, you see, and to see him in such a position really got to me. He looked up at me tearfully and told me that he lost his wallet while we were all high. I told him that the police would get it back to him and since he only had a little cash, the most he'd lose is a little bit of pride and some expired condoms. \n\nHe laughed a bit, wiping the tears from his eyes. He admitted that I was right and patted me on the back, glad of my friendship. I asked him how much his food had cost, telling him that I'd slip him the money so he could appear to pay for it. He replied that he needed about tree fiddy.\n\nThat's when I noticed that my friend was actually an eight story tall plesiosaur from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "[x-post from another] (http://www.reddit.com/r/southpark/comments/xtjq0/that_god_damn_loch_ness_monster/)\n\nSo, I was walking down the street the other day, (I live in NYC) and I had to hop onto the R train headed uptown to 59th Street. I was going to meet some friends in Central Park. Now, I knew I was much too early for our meeting, so I popped into this little cafe to grab a cup of coffee. There, I saw one of my other friends (let's call him Rob) who I was meeting. So we got our cups, then decided to sit in the park for a little while before we were meeting the others.\n\nAnyway, Rob and I were sitting outside the Central Park zoo, watching the seals do their little show for the crowed gathered. We caught up on stuff we've been doing since we last hung out, and then decided to take a meandering path to our meet-up with the others. We were enjoying our time and whatnot. I got a craving for ice cream, so I grabbed an ice cream sandwich from one of those cart guys and ate it as we walked.\n\nNow, I've neglected to set the scene for you all. Its the middle of the summer, in a lull week after a heat-wave. The sun was shining with what couldn't be more than 5 clouds in the perfectly blue sky. The green trees were blowing slightly in the breeze, and the sounds of people enjoying the beautiful day added a nice subtle atmosphere to the park.\n\nSo Rob and I were walking, when suddenly a little boy runs after his ball in the path. I stop it with my foot and he looks up with his large, brown eyes. He seems a little scared to ask an adult for his red ball back, but he takes a breath and summons the courage. He says meekly, \"Excuse me, but can I get my ball back?\" Now, I've worked with children for a number of years, and Rob's cousins have some young kids, so we give a little laugh and want to play. So Rob says, \"It's ours now! It'll cost you ten dollars.\" The kid, obviously knowing we are playing says, \"That's too expensive! I need a discount because my birthday was last month.\" Rob and I laugh and so I say to the kid, \"So, how much can you afford?\" The kid gives a little look of mock calculation and says \"Well, I get $5 a week in allowance, but I only have $1.50 left. Since, I'm getting paid tomorrow, I can spare $6.50.

Well, long story short, she got a boyfriend, moved in with him, yada yada.  I got a new room mate- a friend of a friend type situation.  She wasn't too bad at first.  She was a little messy and she had this white-trash boyfriend that would hang around and they would smoke pot.  Whatever.  I hung out in my room and watched Netflix or studied.  Then room mate and white trash started fighting.  And I mean all the time.  Every time he came over they would end up fighting and then he would storm out of the apartment.  They eventually broke up and then she started getting really weird.  She wouldn't come out of her room except for class and began hoarding all of the dishes.  I was looking around the kitchen one morning for a cereal bowl and they were all in her room.  I tried the knob and opened the door.  Oh my gosh.  There were dirty dishes everywhere, dirty clothes on the floor.  It smelled awful and then I looked at the wall.  There were used pads stuck to the walls.  I didn't even grab a bowl.  I just got out of there and ate the cereal out of the box.  I was so grossed out, I could not even look at her.  We didn't talk much anyway, but I would always be nice to her when I saw her and say good morning and all that.  After the pads thing, I just kind of nodded and retreated to my room.  The room mate apparently noticed a difference because one night she started knocking on my door.  I cracked it open and asked what she wanted.  She looked really odd and just sort of mumbled \"nothing\" and walked away.  I closed the door and went back to surfing Reddit.  A little while later, she knocked again.  Same thing.  I asked her what she wanted and she mumbled and walked away again.  The third time, she knocked.  I got up, yanked open the door and yelled, \"What do you want?\"  She said, \"Tree fiddy.\"  Well it was about this time I noticed that the room mate was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era!

His aunt went to a psychic or a fortune teller or something like that and had an entire year of his life predicted for him. According to my friend, most of the predictions that the psychic made eerily came true. Me, of course being a skeptic, decided to see for myself if the psychic was worth it. The psychic's shop was in kind of a crappy part of town. It was wedged in between this vietnamese noodle  house and a sex shop: not exactly the classiest part of town. I go in there and there's this awful smell of incense or some other terrible herbs  and things like that. At this moment, I wanted to leave, but I decided to persevere and just do it. No one was at the counter at the front, so I decided to peruse the bookshelves of \"mystic tomes\" until the psychic came out. The psychic asked me if there was anything I needed help with, so I told her about my friend and the predictions he got as a gift. The psychic then told me to come to sit down with her across a crystal ball so she could \"map my personality\" or some crap like that. I didn't really want to, but I decided to do so anyways. So the psychic took my hands in her really coarse hands and placed them on the crystal ball. After some mumbling for a few minutes, she said that she was done, and she would have results in 20 minutes, so I should wait for a while while she prepared the prediction. I looked around the shop again and even picked out a few snake eggs from a basket to buy seeing that I had never seen snake eggs before. So when it all was done, She had a little pile of papers bound up in a folder and I put the snake eggs I found on the counter to buy. But before I was able to take the folder in my hand, this red-haired guy barges into the store with bandanas around his face and totting a gun. He start yelling at me to get down and pointed his gun at the psychic. They yelled something at the psychic that I can't remember, because at that time, I decided that I could take on this guy by myself. I crawled behind him as he aimed at the psychic, and I tackled him to the ground. Unfortunately for me, he fired a shot at me before I could get the gun out of his hand, and the bullet grazed my leg. This guy must have never used a gun before because the recoil really surprised him and I was able to wrench the gun out of his hand and pin him to the floor. But in some sort of superhuman manner, he got up from under me and sprinted the hell out of the shop. I wanted to go after him, but I had a bit of trouble running with this cut on my leg from the grazed bullet. The psychic helped me up and asked if I needed to go the hospital. I declined the offer and said \"Can I just get the things I bought?\" So the psychic said that she would give a discount for saving her life, and put the items all together on in a paper bag. I took the paper bag and proceeded to walk out. The psychic shouted out, and said \"Hey. I said I'd give you a discount, not that it would be free.\" I went back and asked \"How much will it be?\" She looks me straight in the eye and says, \"It'll be about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized the psychic was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God dammit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I took the paper bag and ran as best as I could out of there. Now, I have a scar on my leg where that ass shot me. \n\nTL;DR: While going to a psychic, I stopped a robbery and got shot in the leg.

So when it all was done, She had a little pile of papers bound up in a folder and I put the snake eggs I found on the counter to buy. But before I was able to take the folder in my hand, this red-haired guy barges into the store with bandanas around his face and totting a gun. He start yelling at me to get down and pointed his gun at the psychic. They yelled something at the psychic that I can't remember, because at that time, I decided that I could take on this guy by myself. I crawled behind him as he aimed at the psychic, and I tackled him to the ground. Unfortunately for me, he fired a shot at me before I could get the gun out of his hand, and the bullet grazed my leg. This guy must have never used a gun before because the recoil really surprised him and I was able to wrench the gun out of his hand and pin him to the floor. But in some sort of superhuman manner, he got up from under me and sprinted the hell out of the shop. I wanted to go after him, but I had a bit of trouble running with this cut on my leg from the grazed bullet. The psychic helped me up and asked if I needed to go the hospital. I declined the offer and said \"Can I just get the things I bought?\" So the psychic said that she would give a discount for saving her life, and put the items all together on in a paper bag. I took the paper bag and proceeded to walk out. The psychic shouted out, and said \"Hey. I said I'd give you a discount, not that it would be free.\" I went back and asked \"How much will it be?\" She looks me straight in the eye and says, \"It'll be about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized the psychic was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God dammit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I took the paper bag and ran as best as I could out of there. \n\nTL;DR: While going to a psychic, I stopped a robbery and got shot in the leg.

{"body": "So it's late (I want to say about four in the morning or so), and my friends and I are leaving a bar in NYC. Usually we'd just take the subway since it was a pretty direct line from the station by bar to my friend's apartment, but we were with this one kid who liked to buy people shit when he was drunk, so we let him buy a cab for us. We figured it would've been easier... boy, were we wrong.\n\nA cab pulls over, and everything seems normal enough. I forget what he said his name was, but he was really chatty at first and seemed pleasant enough. We told him the fastest way to get home would probably be down Broadway, and he was just like, \"No, shortcut, shortcut!\"\n\nSo he's going up some street I didn't recognize and he's continually trying to make small talk even though we're starting to doubt his \"shortcut\" was even a real thing. Eventually, my one friend who lives in the city just yells at him and says, \"Sir, this isn't the way back to my apartment building. You're going in the wrong direction.\"\n\nThe guy apologizes and makes a turn down a sketchier street. We're all starting to get really uncomfortable. This is where shit hit the fan. He makes another turn and there's a cop car parked along the side of the street. \n\nImmediately upon seeing the cop car, he BOLTS. He accelerates and goes straight through a stop sign and gets the fuck outta there. The cop car immediately puts on his lights and follows us.\nWe're freaking out in the back, screaming at this dude to stop. He's having a pseudo-panic attack and yelling at us, saying \"It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok!\" But it's clearly not... he's zooming up and down back alleyways, going up the wrong way of a couple one-way streets, and just driving like an all-around maniac. The cop is continuing to chase us, but we are gradually getting away.\n\nObviously, we're freaking out in the back of the cab. Why the fuck did this taxi driver just go insane? All I knew \nwas that he just panicked when he saw the cop car, so something was very, very wrong. For all I knew, we were going to be taken hostage or some shit. Basically everyone was in the back pissing their pants.\n\nSo he drives extremely crazy for another fifteen minutes, and luckily there's not much going on in the street since it's 4:30am. After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops). We are all speechlessly freaked out at this point. He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem. The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\" I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\" So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon.\n\nThere we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem. About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit. We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still. After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now. Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\"\n\nWe just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\"\nI nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\" I was so pissed - and we had to walk all the way home from Spanish Harlem too!

Unlike LOTR though, there is no separate historical record to back up the time frame or the bible's writings.\n\nI know why Tolkien wrote LOTR and The Hobbit.  His personal views on industrialism, imperialism and current events are peppered throughout the book, and reflect the then-current state of affairs.

No.\n\nI can no more prove to people that there is a god, or a higher power, than they can prove to anyone that there isn't.

After not much longer, we can no longer see the cop car, and surprisingly, no other cops came (I was expecting a full-out chase with multiple cops). \n\nWe are all speechlessly freaked out at this point. He turns down this HELLA SKETCHY alley and my friends whispers we are in Spanish Harlem. The taxi driver turned off all his lights and goes \"keep it down and don't move.\" I actually tried to go for the door to get out and he goes, \"DON'T YOU DARE!\" So I folded my hands and shut the fuck up, not sure if he had a gun or some other kind of weapon.\n\nThere we are, three drunk guys and an insane cab driver sitting in a dark alley of Spanish Harlem. About a minute later, we watch as the cop car literally speeds past the road we just got off of - as if it is right out of a car chase in a movie or some shit. We're all sweating bullets and freaking out still. After a few more moments of us sitting there in silence, the cab driver turns around and says, \"Ok, you guys can get out now. Sorry, you're going to have to find another way home.\"\n\nWe just mutter something like \"Ok\" because we want to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. I go to open the door to leave and before I can get out, the driver yells, \"WAIT!\" I nervously turned to him, half expecting him to pull out a gun on me or something. He looks me straight in the eye and says, \"Your fare'll be about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at that exact moment that I realized our cab driver was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God damnit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!!\" I was so pissed - and we had to walk all the way home from Spanish Harlem too! UGH!!\n\ntl;dr - Cab driver goes insane, gets chased by the cops, and abandons us in Spanish Harlem.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345142322", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "One time a few years ago, I wasn't in such a great place in my life. I would often steal little knick knacks and objects from around town. There was this one hotdog vendor that sells, well... hot dogs a few blocks from where I live. I was rather hungry, so I decided to wait until he had his back turned to grab a few of his sausages. I was barely able to grab a few of them before the vendor noticed me and I bolted out of there. I ran as fast as I could away from the vendor, fearing for my wellbeing. As I ran away, lots of pedestrians began screaming for help and started to run away from me and the vendor. I suppose that they thought that I was a bank robber who held up innocent people instead of a cheap guy too lazy to go to the local supermarket. I kept running for the next minute until my legs ultimately gave out. I turned around and the vendor was gone. I suppose the vendor gave up after a while, so I proceeded on my way back home. The next day, I had a job interview at this place downtown, not too close from where I lived, so I decided to get a bit of exercise while going to my interview. But little did I know that the vendor actually didn't give up following me the other  day and actually followed me home to see where I lived. I guess he waited a block away from me before pouncing on me. This vendor smacked me in the head, forcing me to land a few feet away from where he hit me. So there I was covered in dirt, my suit ruined, and I gave up. \"I'm really sorry, mate. I don't know why I did that. Is there any way I can pay you back.\" \"Yeah, I'd like it if you paid for all the stuff you stole yesterday, and I won't report you.\" \"Alright, it's the least I can do. How much do I owe you?\" The vendor looked me straight in the eye and said, \"It'll be about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized the hot dog vendor was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God dammit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I took of running in the opposite direction, forgetting all about my interview. \n\nTL;DR: A hot dog vendor stalked me home to get back at me for stealing wieners.

{"body": "I have what's probably a pretty unique take on this, but it requires quickly telling a story from my past. So five years ago a very close friend of mine (a girl) and I were at a point where we both thought we were going to get kicked out of college. It's a long story, but it was a take-home exam, tons of people were sharing notes, but for a combination of complicated reasons she and I and a couple other kids we didn't know happened to get busted out of an enormous class, almost all of whom were cheating. Ours were quite minor, but rules is rules. So it kind of felt like the end of the world - getting kicked out of college, there go all your job prospects, friends, all the other shit. We were due to get our letters of the administration's decision on a Monday. So Monday was doomsday.\n\nWe got fucked up, cried together for a while, went to a movie and walked out, got more drunk, discussed how we'd tell our parents, tried to buy acid from a guy I knew (didn't work out), called up our exes, smoked weed, drank some more, had philosophical discussions for hours on end, babbled incoherently, cried some more, got drunk more, burning through the whole weekend on a bender. Finally it was the day before the apocalypse and we ended up feeling more than anything else sad that we wouldn't get to hang anymore. We're from different parts of the country and obviously weren't coming back to college so it would be tough to see each other. We realized how much we valued each other and even that we had always kind of liked each other. Basicalllyy the night before the end of the world we hooked up. It was really intimate, slow, tender, affectionate, and just as I was about to put it in she looked me in the eyes with the sexiest face I've ever seen. \"Wait...\" she said. I asked her what was wrong, if she needed something.She said, \"I need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time that I realized that my friend was 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.  Anyways, neither of us ended up getting kicked out, the school was very understanding and allowed us to re-take an exam, and I married the woman of my dreams two years later.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345229649", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 24, "controversiality": 0}

It was neat and I was having a great time. I don't remember how the conversation started but there were two elderly couples sitting behind us and apparently both of them collected bobble heads and neither had John Smolts. They started out with both of these old ladies kind of suggesting I give them the bobble head saying things like \"Wow I really want that one, it would be really nice of you to give it to a collector.\" and so on. One of them offered me a few bucks for it, and then so did the other, but honestly by that point I had had it with both of them and respectfully declined, but they just weren't listening to me. Well then these two ladies start arguing over who is going to get it and things get heated. And I mean REALLY heated. And the one behind my dad just tries to grab it from me. Now my dad had been staying out of it for a majority of the time, but he fucking snapped and punched this old woman a good three or four times. Well the womans husband starts yelling for police who were there within seconds and they are at first trying to get this old man to calm down. So they take us up to around where the concessions are and have us separated from the elderly couple. After a few minutes a cop comes up to us and says the lady wants to talk to me. Apparently she would drop the charges in exchange for some \"reparations.\" So I start walking in her direction and I remember looking back and seeing how sorry my dad looks for costing me this bobble head, and then I look forward and this lady has the smuggest damn look on her face I've ever seen. I just wanted to get everything over with so I tried to just hand it to her but she wouldn't take it. I looked at her and asked \"isn't this want you wanted?\" and she replied \"no, I'mma need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about that time I noticed she was about ten stories tall and a crustacean from the Paloezoic era. And I heard my dad shout \"Goddammit lock ness monster!\" and ran past the police and punched her again. The police ended up not pressing charges and I got a hot dog.

We lived in a somewhat large city and we saw an advertisement on TV for a sporting goods place, that had a special going on with a good deal on snowmobile rentals, but the commercial said *specifically* that you had to take them out of town to use them and you could not operate them locally. My friend and I didn't understand why this was important, there was a lot of snow on the ground and there was a huge park with hills and lots of room to use them so we decided to make up a story that we were taking them up in the mountains. We got our stories all straight and even practiced what we would say when we went to go rent them coming up with an answer to every question that we thought we might get asked, and doing role-play to prepare and make sure we could pull off the lie. We got his truck and went to the place that Saturday and told them we wanted to rent 2 snowmobiles. \n\nAnd they didn't even ask! The guy just said OK and handed us the rental agreement and we got the snowmobiles and drove like 15 minutes to the park and got them out, and tore. it. up. We ran them all over that park and no one even noticed. So we had planned to do the same thing Sunday but we were totally wiped out so we agreed we had gotten our money's worth and took them back 5pm Sunday. Everything was going fine but then the guy said, \"You used these in town, didn't you?\" and all our well planned lies just suddenly weren't there and we panicked. The guy looked really mad and he said he was going to have to charge us extra. We were freaked out and asked how much the extra charge was going to be, and the guy leaned way down and said, \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" Well it was about this time we realized this snowmobile rental guy was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era!

{"body": "&gt;Please forgive me for my brevity! My fingers are getting sore. :) I hope the parts I quote and respond to reflect the crux of your response, and that I don't unintentionally omit something crucial.\n\nI understand. I've been reading papers recently as well. I'd like to know your thoughts on them, if possible :)\n\n&gt;I agree! I guess the follow-up question is: if there is high-quality evidence, then why hasn't it been established already that we have enough evidence to presume that extraterrestrials visit Earth?\n\nIt could be that some UFO proponents prematurely claim the present tendered evidence to be sufficient, when in reality the data sampling and methodology behind said analysis was poor. That seems to hinge on the definition of \"high-quality\" evidence. It should also be noted that, with recurring revisions to the tendered data over time, the statistical Unknowns can drop considerably, owing to advances in technology, understanding of cognitive psychology, and examining previously overlooked elements in greater detail. There's also the need for indisputable physical evidence to be supplied for the hypothesis to be accepted on a systemic scale. \n\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book#Project_Blue_Book_Special_Report_No._14) notes that:\n\n&gt;[The] 1979 French GEPAN report [...] stated that about a quarter of over 1,600 closely studied UFO cases defied explanation, stating, in part, \"These cases … pose a real question.\"^21 When GEPAN's successor SEPRA closed in 2004, 5800 cases had been analyzed, and the percentage of inexplicable unknowns had dropped to about 14%.\n\n&gt;I think, when we get down to the nitty-gritty bottom of it all, we're all aware that material evidence is the only way a UFOlogy-to-science breakthrough could happen.\n\nThis becomes more likely as I review the papers you provided :P Though I maintain it's not unreasonable to think that the presently tendered evidence is convincing, if accessed through military and scientific channels. There's a systemic, as well as individual element of acceptance at play here. \n\n&gt;I understand. Yes, there is a challenge in the nature of UFO phenomena and the insistence of science on evidence. But the nature of the phenomena doesn't exempt it from skeptical inquiry, nor does it demand that it be treated differently than other phenomena. The Cosmic Microwave Background was really hard to find, too, as was the rest of the known electro-magnetic spectrum that we can't see with our eyes. To be honest, based on the frequency that UFOs are reported, I'm genuinely surprised that there's no material proof yet. And, to continue being honest, the longer that sightings continue to be reported without any material proof, the less confident I am that there's any actual unearthly phenomena occurring.\n\nFair enough. And in fact, it's been long known that humans can hear the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Reliant on the frequency and length of the signal and distance from the radiating source, reported noises can range from a low-frequency humming sound to a high-pitched whistling sound. Interesting tidbit that I learned today :D Though I realize it's separate from inquiring into the CMB itself. \n\n&gt;Imagine if particle physicists prematurely claimed that the Higgs-boson is real. Hypothetically. Other discoveries predict that they exist, after all, and their existence would make our standard model of physics more simple and eloquent. But that's not enough! It has to be proven. So earlier this year, they announced a [sigma five](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Table) certainty that they found a new particle that behaves like a Higgs-boson, after years and years of colliding sub-atomic particles at near the speed of light in a [17 mile long underground tube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider). Note that a sigma five discovery carries over a 99% certainty, and even then, the wording was carefully constructed in order to avoid any claims to fact. Extraterrestrial claims demand equal, if not more, scrutiny. A new particle accurately predicted by our standard model is huge news, but a new life form not of this Earth? Holy shit! That's huge! But we have to know that it's true -- I mean, really know -- before we say that it is true.\n\nThat's understandable. Though how do we determine the certainty of a hypothesis when it doesn't seem (to me at least) that these occurrences can be quantitatively described? Do we just refer to the probability of known scenarios and the likelihood of those instances occurring in particular cases? \n\n&gt;Just wanted you to know that I know why the analogy was poor. :)\n\nThat's alright :) \n\n&gt;Anything that is material is fantastic! The thing is, so far, none have been presented that I'm aware of. [...] If there are any crop circles that do have residual radiation, it can be explained by the [use of a magnetron](http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/08/03/high-powered-research-the-device-behind-those-mysterious-crop-circles/), which would also be useful in pushing down the crops. Magnetrons, GPS, and lasers being used to assist in crop circle creation is also discussed [here](http://news.discovery.com/earth/crop-circles-explained-with-gps-110805.html) and [here](http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-08/popsci-qampa-using-modern-tech-make-crop-circles).\n\nIt's a shame that some ET proponents cannot take research seriously. I stumbled upon a paper recently, titled \"[Biochemical Traumatology as a Potent Tool for Identifying\nActual Stresses Elicited by Unidentified Sources: Evidence for\nPlant Metabolic Disorders in Correlation With a 'UFO' Landing](http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_04_1_bounias.pdf)\" (1990) by Michael C.L. Bounias. It essentially looks at the functional relationships within the biochemistry of affected plank stalk purported to have been affected by a UFO landing to determine the stress source. In summary, it approaches the issue of residual radiation from a biochemical perspective as opposed to a morphological one. In this case, it concludes that (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;The level of photosynthetic pigments decreased in all samples collected at D + 4 and D + 40 near the epicentre of the UE **(unidentified emission?)**. Then, at D + 40 only, glucose contents increased. **These observations** [...] **are characteristic of an early alteration of the photosynthetic apparatus,** maintained and followed by a decrease in glucose utilization [...] [T]hey were quite **consistent with typical cases of biphasic dose/effect pharmacological or toxicological relations,** including **chemical,** but even **physical (electromagnetic) sources of stress.**\n\nI highlight this for comment on whether these effects could have a terrestrial origin, given that the extended metabolic disruption appears significant. Can a magnetron cause this? \n\nI *do* object to the apparent hand-waving on pages one and two. In fact, it's *very* relevant to our previous discussion on the principle of reproducibility in scientific empiricism:\n\n&gt;One of the most challenging aspects of anomalous phenomenon studies is the question of their reproducibility, which is often considered as a condition for a study to be considered scientific.\nAnother critical aspect in such a study is the validity of human testimonies, which is the object of some specific branches of human sciences and has led to a number of famous controversies in terms of what is science (Abelson, 1974; Bauer, 1979) or what the value of\ntestimonies is (Loftus 1979). [See: Sturrock, 1987, for review in a similar area.] \n\n&gt;Nevertheless, there are several scientific domains, undoubtedly accepted as full sciences, that do not actually need any experimental reproducibility. For instance, in paleontology, no one can say when and where the next discovery of an Australopithecus skeleton will occur, although this is never depicted in a joking manner as, for instance, observations (even including material evidence, such as photographs or sonar recordings) concerning the Loch Ness Monster (see Bauer, 1987, for review).\n\nIt seems to miss the fact that reproducibility refers to the ease of recreating the conditions for experiment itself. The need to control variables is done to mediate certainty in comparative experimental procedures. There are several instances in paleontology wherein variables can be controlled for comparative analysis. Determining whether a bone sample belongs to the paleolithic era certainly involves a significant degree of experimental control to increase dating accuracy. It's not recreating original conditions so much as creating conditions in which we can extrapolate to a desired point without taint. In addition, there's no need to recreate part of the experiment if by implication the desired subject for study already exists. It treats subject recurrence as the full scope of experimental control. The paper acts like the latter isn't a requirement; *it always is*.\n\n&gt;It's the stubborn amateur scientist in me, though it's not as rare as you may think! You'd be hard-pressed to find a single scientist, mathemetician, or engineer working for NASA that doesn't have pipedreams of discovering alien life. Everyone in cosmology wants to find alien life! There's even an entire discipline of science dedicated to it: [astrobiology](http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/). Pretty awesome!\n\nI'll check that article out. Thanks! The second article I referred to was \"[Effects of UFOs Upon People](http://www.ufocasebook.com/pdf/ufoeffects.pdf)\" (1987) by James McCampbell. Here the author examines the reported physiological effects these purported objects have had on nearby witnesses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345335591", "subreddit": "UFOs", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

There's a great quote by Christopher Hitchens that fits your little story perfectly \"That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.\" Your entire story has no proof whatsoever that it happen and so it just amounts to your word against mine and you expect me to believe it just because you passionately assert that it happened. Your story also suggests that you might not be the most reliable of narrators in that you reference the fact that you have had some substance abuse issues and have recurring periods of depression. I'm not a doctor, but the fact that you also seem to regularly experience vivid hallucinations of things that aren't there and people who are dead suggests that you should probably seek medical help, especially if you are entering into an altered state of mind while driving which is really putting your life and the lives of other people on the road in danger.*\n\n*But what I really think is going on here is that you are completely aware that you entire story is bullshit and you made up this whole elaborate little story not out of an ill will to deceive people, but in the hopes that your story would inspire your fellow Christian friends who might be doubting their faith. Your story is really no different than any of the other chain email stories that are meant to inspire of an individual that is having a hard time that magically turns their life around thanks to Jesus. If you were in a rough patch and managed to turn around your life that's good for you, just spare me from the nonsense about dead girls dressed in white and angels that you can't take pictures of.*", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345389500", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 4, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "There was this one story at my middle school...\n\nMy best friend, we'll call him Jeff, was on his way home from school on a Wednesday, I remember it like it was yesterday and I will probably always remember it as long as I live. Anyways, Jeff is going home, and we lived in an okay city, but there were thugs as there will be in any urban area. So he's walking home from school that day, because he missed his bus and his parents both worked. Keep in mind that he didn't live too far from the school, only like 20 blocks, which is a bit of a walk but not impossible for a teenage boy full of energy. He was just toodlin along minding his own business when he gets jumped, and pulled into an alley. Immediately blindfolded and gagged, he later gets shoved in a van and is escorted away quickly. His captors threw him in a room and locked it without frisking him, and he still had his phone. He managed to untie himself somehow and picked his phone up, and calls me. Yeah, *me.* So I pick up the phone and talk to him for a few minutes, and by the time the captors heard him talking and took his phone, I had gathered that he was kidnapped, but couldn't tell where he was (he was blindfolded and all). So I tell my parents and they call the cops, who tell us to call Jeff's phone and see if they can get a ransom offer and such, pretty standard kidnapping procedures. My parents then called Jeff's (who were at work, which wasn't close, but wasn't that far, maybe an hour's drive at most), who were confused and terrified, naturally. Anyways, the caller doesn't pick up the phone, but on Saturday, 3 days later, they do call my phone, and I give it to my parents. They arrange a meeting place for the ransom, and we go, stopping by Jeff's house to pick up his parents on the way. When we get there, we see Jeff, blindfolded with his hands tied, and a man in a mask with a gun pointed at Jeff's head. His parents are horrified and his mom actually vomited into a bush, but I kept a level head. I screamed at the man: \"What do you want from us? How much will it take for you to release Jeff?\" To which he replies: \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was then that I realized that the captor was an 8 stories tall crustacean from the paleozoic period.

{"body": "The other day I dropped my pen on the sidewalk. A man and I went to go pick it up at the same time, and we bumped heads. He later informed me that he stumbled away, dazed from the head bashing, and shoulder bumped a woman who then broke the heel of her high heel. This woman then walked barefoot the rest of the way and stepped on a piece of glass. She was admitted to a certain hospital down the road where her foot was quickly taped up to stem the flow of blood. Due to her condition seeming quite severe due to the blood, she was admitted before a man who claimed his head was extremely sore. The rage from being passed up by a seemingly less significant injury built and built in this man, and he eventually went home and beat his wife severely. His wife just happened to have 3 very large brothers, and these brothers took their sister to a hotel while they went to his house to beat his ass. They knocked on the door, and the man who beat their sister answered. They kicked the man's ass, and this time he was quickly admitted to the hospital. He spent the night there, regretting what he did as the guilt continued to build in him. When he left he decided to drink his troubles away, so he went to the local liquor store. He put the liquor on the counter and the cashier looked at him and said, \"that's gonna be about tree fiddy.\" Well, it was about that time that the man noticed that cashier was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era...The god damned lock ness monster had tricked him again!", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345594180", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": -6, "controversiality": 0}

Dismissing all of them as a critic with \"they were probably mistaken\" is just a cop out. Sure, THEY ALL COULD BE LIARS, Bigfoot doesn't exist, but then why are they doing this anonymously?

It's now 45 years later, how come nobody has matched it? Nobody has tried? There's fame and fortune to be had if anyone pulls it off. If it's a simple thing of having a camera and a costume we should be flooded with many convincing fakes. There's plenty of shitty fakes, go check Youtube. Which brings up the \"interesting\" videos:\n\nThere's way more cameras now than there were in 1967. There certainly seems to be a rise in camera phone footage of Bigfoot looking things. (check out facebook.com/findbigfoot) I don't see a corresponding rise in Loch Ness Monster looking things from Loch Ness. I don't even see a rise in clear, close up UFO looking things. If the thing exists, there has to be a rise in footage - at least shakey camera phone footage. Let's say all of the shakey camera phone footage of Bigfoot is fake. Unlike faking UFO footage where you can throw a pie tin in the air and snap a photo, it takes some effort to come up with a really good Bigfoot costume, and not some zippered Halloween suit. Hundreds of dollars? Hours and hours of time? Let's say you now have a costume that matches Patterson/Grimlin. Why the hell would anyone shoot just 5 seconds of it disappearing behind a bush? You've got something that will fool just about everyone - SHOOT THE DAMN THING. Why waste all your time on crappy footage if you've got the goods? There's a ton of footage from camera phones that certainly could've been much better, seeing that they took all that effort to assemble the fake.\n\nIf Bigfoot doesn't exist, there's some interesting things going on here anyway. People will want to be part of the Bigfoot legend, even if they have to do it anonymously? The draw is so great that people everywhere are compelled to do this? People certainly are delusional, just look to the religious - that's just a giant example of group think.

{"body": "&gt;Things is not very descriptive. How would bigfoot things differ from bear things for instance? It's true that one could reasonably assume bigfoot things would be distinguishable but it's a less reasonable assumption that the differences would be obvious enough to be found with out serious effort. By serious effort I mean scientific and concerted.\n\nBears are large predators that eat meat, for example... and which would probably on occasion eat a Big Foot. So if Big Foot was going to blend in with \"bear stuff\" it would have to be a meat eater... maybe *it* kills a bear on occasion. If bear, why not cattle? \n\nIt is suggested that Big Foot \"fears man\" and has learned to live in hiding... but why? Where in the fossil record is there evidence to suggest there is a reason to fear man? Did we hunt them to the brink of extinction? Were we co-existing with them at one point like homo erectus or neanderthal? Why is this so absent from the written and archeological record?\n\n&gt;It's not surprising or interesting that you can't think of a single exception, in fact isn't it totally obvious that any animal that would be exception you wouldn't know about?\n\nI cannot think of a single large animal *in history* which cannot be tracked. Not one exception. Even giant squids, which... if we're talking about geographical distribution has to be *way* more rare than Big Foot (or else Big Foot would go extinct).... even they have been seen, bodies discovered, etc. \n\n&gt;Hopefully no one is an atheist because they believe the absence of evidence of god is proof of absence, but because absence of evidence should create absence of certainty. Further, disbelief in gods is not always equal. There is ample evidence that some gods just don't exist so atheism isn't necessarily found only on doubt or lack of evidence.\n\nThat is actually why everyone is an atheist. There is no direct, reproducible, peer-reviewable evidence for something? Then don't believe in it. The rest of what you have to say here is ontological crap.\n\n&gt;Either way it's a disingenuous argument because a god as a general concept is unprovable but whether or not there is a bigfoot is not. Bigfoot would be grounded in principles we understand; nature, biology and physics, where as a god isn't necessarily beholden to any of these\n\nAll of those principles are telling us that there is no Big Foot. There is no record of it anywhere... what we know about animals, and how they behave and interact, reproduce, eat, sleep, and shit.... all of those things are telling us that there is 0 material evidence for Big Foot... which is another way of saying there is no reason to think we will find any in the future. Could it happen? Sure. Highly unlikely. Might as well start looking for the Loch Ness monster or other dinosaurs. I mean... they could still be alive somewhere like the Congo or the Amazon, right?\n\n&gt;If you're saying that there are no large hairy bipeds on earth that we don't know about then I think that's a pretty bold claim.\n\nFind a paleontologist who is willing to go on record and say that it is probable that we will find a large unidentified member of the great ape family which has never been otherwise encountered in the sense of physical evidence. \n\nI mean, yes, by your logic \"any\" undiscovered subspecies of gorilla is going to qualify... but it's still a gorilla. \n\nNow, if you're saying something like: \"Big Foot\" is a word we use for gorillas who, for whatever reason, end up in places they shouldn't be... like Washington State or Canada. Maybe they escaped from a zoo, maybe someone had it as a pet, whatever... OK?

The Dragon would then slowly walk towards him, each step causing a large, audible *BOOM*.\n\nThe player has forgotten about the ores by now, even though all sorts of rare and shining jewels covered the dark circular cave he was in. His eyes were fixated on the magnificent creature in front of him, with it's razor-sharp teeth and majestic wings.

The Dragon, however, seeing the miserable human try to get away, starts to come towards him at a faster pace, quickly catching up to him.\n\nThe Dragon raised a large claw, hooking the back of the player's armour, getting rid of any last thoughts of actually escaping. The Dragon pushed the player up the wall, putting him in the stone as easily as a cookie cutter into dough.\n\nThe player could feel the Dragon's rancid breath on his cheek, and faced away as it started to talk in a low, gravelly voice. The ancient voice told without directly saying it that the Dragon had seen much in it's time, and the sparkling eyes showed a sign of intelligence and power.\n\n\"Human,\" the Dragon said, putting it's snout up close to the player's face, smoke spiraling from it's nostrils. The player was terrified, and a yellow stain in his pants would have been visible had it not been for the armour.\n\nThere was a long pause. The player was surprised that the Dragon had not turned him into burnt flesh by now. He squinted, carefully opening his eyes only to find the Dragon staring back at him. There was something different, though. Now the Dragon's eyes showed a desperate request, as if it were asking the player something.\n\n\"W-what is it?\" the player asked, his voice coming out much, *much* higher than usual.\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nThat's when the player realized that the Dragon was actually a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic era, and as it happily went along it's way, he shouted out, \"Damn it, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345684987", "subreddit": "Minecraft", "score": 39, "controversiality": 0}

There was an entrance for crew only, that boarded about 3 hours prior to the cruise... I carefully worked my way into the general vicinity. One person went to the bathroom on land, and left a small suitcase outside (crew). So, I did the only logical thing. I took the briefcase, and walked casually out. I then went to a nearby restaurant (half mile) and put on the uniform inside. I promptly walked back. Finding my way onto the ship was a breeze. I got right onto the ship, and it was clear that they were looking for someone. Being that I boarded late, on the crew entrance, they didn't really ask me for anything. I was holding a clipboard, and walking quite fast. Oldest trick in the book. \n\nI then moved into the dining area. I went into the staff bathroom, pushed up the false ceiling, and crawled up there. Sat there for 2 hours, playing pokemon red on my gameboy... \n\nOnce I knew (based upon time) that people were boarding the ship, I took my work uniform OFF, left it up in the ceiling.. I had simply put it on over my regular clothes (and it was hot as hell...)\n\nI waltz out of the bathroom like nobody's business! Then I realized that the dining area didn't open for another 10 minutes. The floor was EMPTY, and there were people setting tables and such. A security guard ran up to me. \n\n\"STOP!\" He yelled. Apparently the crew member reported suspicious activity when his clothing was stolen, so they were on high alert...\n\nI acted as casual as possible. He asked me how I got in and such, I just told him the door was unlocked and I needed to poop. \n\n\"I need something from you to prove to me you're not on board illegally.\" he said.\n\n\"What can I give to you to prove that?

{"body": "Hi Sam. In 2008, you did a great job in picking up on my John Hagee scoop (his \"God sent Hitler\" claim that caused McCain to drop his endorsement like a hot potato). \n\nMy question is this - how can the Huffpo blogpost contribution filters be improved? \n\nI've personally driven national stories (such as this one, which went from a viral Alternet piece I did to the Scotland Herald -- http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/how-american-fundamentalist-schools-are-using-nessie-to-disprove-evolution.17918511 -- and that in turn spawned dozens of mainstream media stories.The coverage has caused so much controversy that the Bobby Jindal administration has made policy changes.\n\nHuffpo did indeed cover the Louisiana/Loch Ness Monster story (it was a huge hit)  - but the followup story I did on Huffpo, which had new, sensational info to add to the story (not too surprising because I'd created the story in the first place) languished in relative obscurity. \n\nAnother even bigger example has been my Palin reporting - on her close association with two of C. Peter Wagner's professed witch hunters from his New Apostolic Reformation. It went nowhere -- too bad, because my coverage has since been confirmed, both by Wagner (on Terry Gross' show Fresh Air) and seconded by co-architect of the religious right Colonel V. Doner, in his new book \"Christian Jihad - Neo-Fundamentalists and the Polarization of America\" (and by a number of other sources as well.)\n\nPalin's longtime friend Mary Glazier even released a \"prophecy\" in September 2008, hinting that an untimely death would lead Palin to ascend, alone and amidst national mourning, to a yet higher national office. \n\nIt was sensationalistic stuff. The story of the decade even. Palin was a true \"Manchurian candidate\". I wrote quite a bit about this, but Huffpo didn't showcase my pieces. I think the assumption was that people from Alaska would know more about Palin's rather unusual religious roots. \n\nAnyway, I mention this because its been my personal experience that in the realm of religion and politics, often potential huge stories are missed.\n\nFor example, I'm now working on a story about how, last year, leading strategists on the religious right were accusing a certain Wisconsin congressman of being a crypto-satanist. \n\nBest,\nBruce Wilson\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1345816533", "subreddit": "IAmA", "score": 23, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My parents have a trailer up north that we go to every summer for weeks at a time.  The first year I was old enough to stay home alone I thought it would be a great idea to stay up late and play Counter-Strike with some friends.  By the time 4am rolled around, I decided it was time to stop.  With a bit of coaxing, I was convinced to keep playing. \n\nEventually it was 7am and I had plans the next day, so, I went without sleep.  I sort of struggled through out the day because I was running on empty.  This was back before energy drinks existed so I didn't really have anything other than pop/soda to try and pep me up.  Anyways, the following night I was determined to go to bed early, but I got hooked into playing counter-strike again with the same people.\n\n7am rolled around again and I still hadn't slept.  I was a very impressionable youth at this time and would basically listen to anything anyone would tell me if it would help me fit in.  I was going out with friends that day as well, so I went out and did what I did and came home.\n\nMe, being me, decided that \"hey, at this point, why not just try and stay up as long as I can at this point.  It's summer, I have no school, no job, no responsibility, let's do this.\"  \n\nIt was around the mid 60 hour mark that I started to hear whispers.  I couldn't exactly make out what was being said, but it seemed like someone was trying to communicate with me.  I would see shadows flit around in the corner of my eye, but when I went to focus on them, they would be gone.  I was at the mall with a girl that I was really, really into.  I probably would've gone to bed if she hadn't asked me to go with her.  Who the hell was I to say \"no, I have to sleep\" at 2pm in the middle of the week?  Plus I wanted to get laid so bad, so scoring any brownie points was worth it, even at the cost of my sanity.\n\nShe's browsing stores as I sit on the couches out in the hallway trying to get my head straight, focus my vision and shut out the noises.  I started to fall into a bit of a haze, daydreaming, if you will.  I was hallucinating that I was on a wooden roller coaster, being violently shaken back and forth.  I **hate** wooden roller coasters so I started to freak out a bit.  \n\nI snapped out of it, realizing that the girl was shaking me, because I had completely spaced out and she was asked me a question about 3 times.

{"body": "Long time ago... Me n' my brother Kyle we were hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road... to the game-store. On the way we meet several people. There was this crazy ol' dude offering me a white van if I entered his candy. Seeing as my mother has only taught me not to go with strangers offering candy for the cost of entering a white van, I could not see why this noble mustached man's offer should even be considered turned down. \n\nKyle was a bit more skeptic, and didn't really feel like doing this. The smooth thing here was though, that I've been watching Star Wars so many times, that I learned a thing or two about the jedi-mind-tricks. \"You do want to go with me and the mustached man.\" I said, which immediately made him answer \"I do want to go with you and the mustached man\"\n\"Smooth juice\" - I thought to myself, because I've always wanted a white van, and seeing as a kind stranger offers me this thing, why would I turn him down? \n\nWell - This was like a test. Not one of those a typical teacher would hand out, just to humiliate you with the letter 'F' - No. We're talking one of those tests you see in those movies written by pot-smoking writers. I had to blow up his bubblegum and enter the bubble. Yet again I knew a fancy trick. America's loved hero, Duke Nukem, once said \"It's time to kick some ass and blow some bubble gum... And I'm all outta gum.\" This fitted quite for the occasion, as the strange man with the white van only gave me a single piece of gum to complete the task. Even one of those shitty pieces of gum that you never really like.\n\nI tried my best. I blew all that I could. I struggled. It would not work. I used my sweetest moves... And I kicked the ass of the white-van-man. He was knocked unconscious from this non-lethal, but yet awesomesaucylicious butt-kick. He was defeated by the element of surprise. Kyle and I went into the car, cause we really wanted that sweet new game from the store. Just Cause 2 was the title.\n\nWe were now rolling - People were hating. Everything was like it should be. On our way to the store we saw many crazy things. A man hugging an object. It was a box which contained something that horrific, that it could be smelled through the car-windows. Also because the car's windows were non-existing, but the box nevertheless smelled like a rotten body. The man pulled out a lighter and ignited the box, but it was like it was too late... The box now had it's own life. I decided to keep driving. I didn't look back.\n\nWe reached the game-store. We went out of the car. Suddenly when we were about 3 metres away from the car, the time suddenly went slower. My long he-man-hair was vigorously blowing in the wind, showing all my manliness. Kyle was bald... Well - Out of nowhere the white van exploded. It was dramatic. I did not look back, but seeing as Kyle is really a flip-flop-douche-head, he looked back and kinda ruined my flow. All the hot-girls were looking at us in the first place, but as soon as Kyle turned his head... They ignored us completely. \n\nWe reached the entrance of the shop. Music began playing. Confetti came down from above. I said \"Hey! What's going on?!\". The manager of the shop came over to me and said. \"Son... You're the 99.999th visitor! You have won a free game\". At first I was a bit confused. I've won several contests on the internet, because I for some reason have this lucky IP that attracts all kinds of prizes. Never got any of them though. I did not believe this man! I thought he was nothing but a phoney.\n\nAfter 10 seconds I realized what was going on. I had won a fucking free game. I knew what I was going to pick.\nI told the manager \"Sir, I would like Just Cause 2\". He answered me very quickly \"Alright - I'll need about three fiddy then\".\nConfused as I was, I asked him what was going on here. \"Three... fiddy...\" he said very slowly, like I was some animal. \"You mean three dollars and fifty cents?! Well mr. Manager-douche, I ain't giving you no damn three-fiddy. I won a free game!\"\n\nThis time he repeated himself, he sounded way more angry though \"I NEED THREE FIDDY\". It was about then I realized that he was no game-shop-manager, but that he in fact was the damn Loch Ness monster. \n\nI would not pay this diabolic creature this crazy amount of money for something that was free. I went out of the store. My car-theft made me wanted in all the city, and I could not ever get to buy the game.\n\nAnd Kyle..? Well...

It then tips over and I see that its leg is clean cut like [this.] (http://nobskafarms.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/starter-baking-ham.jpg) After it goes down I see that the floor is vibrating and I look over the horizon and see 3 T-rex. They are heading for the elephant in front of my damn house!\n\nMy family rushes inside but I try to save the elephant like a retard. When the T-rex get there I start shitting bricks but then the weirdest shit happened. For some reason I asked one of the T-rex WTF it is he wanted and you know what he said? \"I need about tree fitty.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346003746", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}
{"body": "2 years ago I was staying up in Scotland with my parents (I'm Scottish but live in London), this was an annual thing and it has always been normal until this one particular experience 2 years ago.\n\nMy parents always cook a big dinner when I go up to visit and we just finished polishing off the leftovers at about midnight when my parents said they were heading up to bed, I myself wasn't tired so I stayed downstairs watching TV and eating mashed potatoes (yum).\n\nI was slowly starting to drift off at about 1:30am when I decided I best head upstairs and hop into bed as my parents always went mad when I left electronics on over night and would always tell me off, no matter what age I was. So I head upstairs and get changed in the bathroom, take a piss then head off to the guest bedroom. This room was kinda creepy in it's own essence but I'd slept in much scarier rooms, so I thought nothing of it. \n\nThis is where it gets weird, it should be noted that my parents live in a 300 year old house at the very northern part of Scotland in the countryside, I couldn't get to sleep at all, even though I was dozing off downstairs, something was just... off. I felt the room get much colder and then suddenly the window shot open. My heart was racing at this point but I the window was letting in a chilling breeze so I had to shut it. \n\nAs I was closing my window I glanced out across the field, the trees were swaying and I couldn't see much further than 15 meters. All of a suidden, this huge black figure shot out towards the window. I almost pissed myself at this point, this figure was taller than the house and was outside my window. I still had to shut the window so I just blurted out at the top of my voice:\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU WANT!!\"\n\nSilence, but then I heard a little whisper from outside. I got closer until I saw the figure again, his features slowly starting to become more clear and focused. It spoke louder this time and I managed to figure out what it was saying...\n\n\"I need about tree fiddy\".\n\nIt was at this point that I noticed that this scary black figure haunting my house was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleolithic era!

{"body": "^This^ I had an amazing experience when I went to go see the indie flick *The Dark Night*. Being an orphan after my real parents were killed during a robbery, the batman movies have always been special to me. As batman movies are so important to me I chose someone of equal importance to go with me to the midnight premier, my GF. We had gotten tickets months in advanced and I impatiently waited for that night to come. When that night finally came I picked up my GF at 10 PM so we could get to the premiere an hour early. We drove to the theater, got our tickets, went to our seats, and waited for the movie to start. The epicness began after an hour or so and my life began to change. Never before have I seen such a good movie, a true roller coaster of actiony emotion. About 3/4 of the way through the movie my GF started to rub my upper leg. I told her her to quit it so I could watch the movie but she kept doing it. Once again I asked he to stop but she kept distracting me, she had gone too far for me to stay chill. I started yelling at her for ruining my movie experience and my life then she started to cry. At this point she was really making a scene so I just broke it off with her right then and there. She started crying even harder at this point. \"Why? Why? I was just trying to make you happy.\" she said.  I told her to STFU and GTFO respectively. After a few more minutes of crying she looked up and said \"Can I at least have some money to get a cab home?\" I reached in my pocket and gave her 1 or 2 bucks. Angrily she yelled \"You know this isn't enough, I live 20 miles from here. I need at least tree fiddy.\" At that point I realized I had gone to batman with a giant crustacean from the Paleolithic Era. fucking bitch. After the movie I went home and watched some porn.\n\nTL:DR The Dark Knight was a pretty good movie.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346083717", "subreddit": "circlejerk", "score": 99, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms.  She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet.  His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name.  Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.  \n\nJoe didn't give a shit.  He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either.  Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom.  His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\".  His name was now legally Adam Adams.  Why?  All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe,  my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it.  He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember.  But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage.  The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me.  Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son.  This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.  \n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on.  She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does.  My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.  \n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story.  She does.  Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words).  While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out. \n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved.  After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad.  I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story.  When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her.  She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again.  But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346114394", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

If you were conducting an experiment, you would want to reject that null hypothesis and accept the [alternate hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis) that god **does** exist.

{"body": "It's true, steel is better than iron in every way. Iron products can corrode and rust, so humans ingesting iron grow old and die. If humans were to ingest stainless steel, especially during young, cereal-eating ages, humans would never grow old or develop health problems.\n\n\nAs much as I'd love to keep talking about the science and biology of steel, I fear I must answer your question with a brief history of the politics behind it. Steel was banned from cereals due to excessive lobbying by the iron, calcium, zinc, and magnesium industries in the early 1900s. These companies felt threatened by the existence of steel and tried to get rid of the powerful alloy before it invaded the market.\n\nThe aforementioned industries would pay cereal companies about tree fiddy (5.8 billion dollars adjusted for inflation) to run propaganda about the dangers of steel in our diets. Soon after, Congress passed a law banning steel from cereals, and the brainwashed populace never questioned the move. \n\nIf you want proof that life was better before the ban on steel, just look at history and literature before the 1900s. As mentioned before, people never grew old; the average lifespan was about 30 years. And I challenge anyone to find a single novel before the 20th century that focused on cancer as opposed to today when cancer is the focal point of many books, shows, and films.

{"body": "I've read [\"The Case for Christ\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/z0zye/veracity_of_the_new_testament/c60kev6), and it's a work that gets commonly accepted facts wrong and makes flawed logical arguments which rely on assumptions of the Bible being reliable, all in service of one goal: Trying to convince people that the Bible is right for religious reasons, rather than objectively weighing the evidence. I'm aware Strobel claims he was an atheist before meeting his wife and studying the gospels, which might well be true (although plenty of merchants of religion claim to be converted in order to sell their story), but he's not a skeptic or a historian.\n\nIt assumes that the Gospels were each written by the actual apostles independent of each other, and no common sources like Mark and Q inspired Matthew and Luke. This is something sufficiently obviously wrong that religious and non-religious historians alike [are in agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoptic_Gospels). Many of the arguments that follow then rest on these being reliable and independent accounts by the actual living apostles, even though all evidence is to the contrary.\n\nWhen the fact that these are a few of [over forty gospels](http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_ntb1a.htm) that were picked and edited is mentioned, it is claimed that they were chosen by the church for reliability. But aside from this being unevidenced, the author acknowledges that this 'reliability' included trying to build a common narrative. There were many different Christian movements with different accounts of Jesus, this one account the council favored in the fifth century isn't inherently more reliable than others like the [gnostics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Christianity_and_Gnosticism).\n\nA bunch of logical fallacies surround the book, which includes assuming things in the accounts are true (there were hundreds of witnesses for the ressurection, thousands of people followed Jesus, the apostles were good men who'd never lie) and then claiming this proves they couldn't lie. Except the initial assumptions aren't evidenced, and the larger events are implicitly contradicted by the complete historical silence from other historians covering the era and movements. \n\nIn addition from what I remember, Strobel believes that evidence like \"What about the empty tomb!\" or \"What about the apostles dying for their beliefs!\" are slam-dunks. Except that these events aren't any more confirmed than the ressurection itself, and have far more likely natural explanations than a ressurection. It's like claiming you met a Nessie in Scotland, and citing as proof your own testimony that you went to Loch Ness. One is at least plausible and we may not have evidence disproving it, but you can't cite your own account as confirmation of other parts of the same account. \n\nWe don't have confirmation that the apostles even existed, let alone any confirmation that they died for their religion, let alone that they died in circumstances where recanting would save them, and if they did it still proves nothing more than Joseph Smith's followers dying alongside him when they probably knew that he was a fraud as well. We have contemporary accounts from many people of yogis and the like performing miracles today, and people claiming to see them after they resurrected. But we don't believe them even when the claims are documented, because we know from many, many examples that these stories are told and believed by mistake, fraud and faith, the latter being a decision to deliberately disregard the value of evidence in favor of certainty. Early Christians had faith in stories like everyone else, not evidence.\n\nStrobel as well does the typical apologetic thing of citing Pliny (the Younger, since the Elder actually covers Jerusalem in that time contradicting later Christian accounts), Josephus and Tacitus to claim they confirm the claims of Christianity. Except that Josephus' testimonium is a forgery from centuries later, and all the other sources cited only describe Christianity or Christians as a movement much later, they never confirm any central claims.\n\nStrobel repeatedly retreats to \"historical evidence from the era is lacking, there are other claims we accept without independent confirmation.\" Except we don't accept non-supported stories when they directly contradict the laws of nature, or the people have proven themselves unreliable and make outlandish claims. He also claims the fact that it was an oral culture means we should be fine with the story circulating for about 50 years among superstitious peasants before being (in part) written down. Except we know that such transmissions tend to change the story, and are likely to turn the martyrdom of a popular religious leader into a fantasy story of healing lepers, magically generating food, and rising from death.\n\nAn excuse for lack of evidence, is not itself any evidence for reliability. The gospels remain less supported than the events of the Quran and hadiths, or Book of Mormon, or Scientology. Being generous with their credibility leaves them in the same position as other mythologies, history with magical claims interwoven over time to make them interesting and useful to those telling them. Being skeptical leaves them completely unevidenced for any events prior to Paul writing the letters.\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346267484", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 70, "controversiality": 0}

Despite the fact that the other kids in my English class were pretty disruptive, we still got along fine with our teacher, Mrs. Bennet.

He was known for taking points off of students' final grades if they were late to class too many times. \n\nOur class was doing just mediocre with the lessons. So Mrs. Bennet promised us that if everyone in the class got at least an 85% on the final exam, she would take us out for ice cream. After a week of hard studying, everyone got a good enough grade, so we went to our local Dairy Queen after school the next day. Everyone lined up and ordered their ice cream, and I was enjoying mine when Mrs. Bennet came up to me and said, \"Llim, I'm afraid I need to borrow some money from you to help pay for the ice cream.\" I said, \"Sure, how much?\" She bent down and said \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" It was about that time that I realized that Mrs. Bennet was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.

{"body": "I was at the doctor about a year ago because of an extremely swollen lymph node. I should mention that this is the first time that I had been to this particular office because my old doctor had just retired and I wasn't really a fan of the other doctor at his practice.  Everything was going pretty normally at first, waited in the waiting room for about 15 minutes before being seen.  They called my name, took me to the back, weighed me, measured me, took my vitals, all that typical doctor's office stuff. \n\nAfter all that the nurse left the office and told me that the doctor would be with me very shortly. This was a giant bold faced lie.  I sat there on the table for about an hour before the very same nurse came back into the room and told me that the doctor had been held up by another patient and would now be with me extremely soon.  I thought to myself that it seemed reasonable and continued waiting in the office. Another hour went by and I began to become a little bit upset. This time, taking matters into my own hands, I decided to go to the front desk and ask what the hold up was.  They told me to just be patient and that the doctor would literally be no less than 10 more minutes. Okay. I told myself I would wait for 10 more minutes and then if no one showed up I would leave. \n\nThe doctor came in as promised around 10 minutes later. He explained to me how he was held up in traffic on his way back to the office from lunch, the subway sandwich he was eating in front of me confirmed that story but did not dispel the weirdness of this situation.  He then quickly finished his sandwich, washed his hands, and stared me right in the eyes and told me to take off my pants. I told him I was here for a lymph node near my throat but he insisted. I did I was told, after all he was the doctor. He started to feel around my upper pelvic region, gave me a thumbs up, and told me everything was going to be okay and that there was nothing to worry about. I was very confused and cross at this point. He did not even examine the issue I came in with even when I protested. I decided to leave the office and go get a badly needed second opinion.  I asked him politely how much I owed him for the vist.  He said about tree fiddy.

{"body": "I met River Phoenix once.\n\nI was out having drinks in downtown Los Angeles, and me and my friends were all pretty hammered at this point. A few whisky and Cokes here and there had all built up into us all being shitfaced out of our skulls, the Taco Bell from earlier in the evening (what the fuck, we were young and we were about to get drunk, who gives a fuck if it's shitty Mexican food) boiling away in our stomachs and barely soaking up any of the alcohol.\n\nSo we were in this shitty dive bar, drunk out of our minds, when in walks this kid. He's got a few people with him, don't know who, we just assumed they were his friends at the time, but I remember thinking that the kid seemed... familiar. I couldn't place a finger on it, but I was sure I knew him from somewhere. I put it to the back of my mind and go back to drinking.\n\nAnother couple of hours passed. I was even more drunk than I was before. Whether it was actually a couple of hours or not I have no idea, but I was shitfaced. My friends at this point were playing pool badly somewhere in the corner and there was something on the TV I couldn't focus on. So; whatever. But then it hit me - the Taco Bell wanted to come out, along with a hell of a lot of my intestinal lining. It was the unmistakable burning feeling of impending diarrhoea.\n\nI ran into the men's toilets, desperate to unload, but - SHIT - the FUCKING DOOR WAS LOCKED. Standing impatiently outside the locked cubicle, I felt a pocket of gas approach my sphincter and thought - right - maybe if I can fart, it'll release some of the pressure. So I do.\n\nWrong move. I sharted. Absolutely everywhere. The inside of my Calvins and the back of my pant legs were absolutely drenched almost immediately in runny, liquid, mucosal shit. It absolutely stank, and as the smell hit my delicate nostrils, mixing with the shame of having shat myself most publicly and humiliatingly, in some shitty LA dive bar, I responded in the only way possible - I vomited. Puked everywhere. Over the cubicle door, over my T-shirt, over everything. I think I convulsed so hard I pissed myself too, just to add to my mounting humiliation.\n\nSo there I am, covered in my own shit, piss and vomit, in a pool of all three, in the toilet of an LA dive bar. At least I'm alone, right? Wrong. The cubicle opens, and... there's the kid. Standing there, right in front of me. He has a start, shocked at what he sees, and looks me up and down. In that moment, it finally clicks who he is, and why he was so familiar: \"RIVER PHOENIX\" I blurt out, still standing in my puddle of effluence, finally clicking who he is. He looks me up and down again, this time with less shock than contempt, and then he says...\n\n\"None of this actually happened and you're not actually American, you're British, you've never been to LA or the USA and you definitely have never eaten Taco Bell or met River Phoenix.\" And then I realised this was entirely true and I went home and ate a cake instead.

{"body": "I've never actually told anyone this, so... fuck it. Going without throwaway.\n\nWell, I was getting ready for the wedding of my best mate Jake, and we were out on his stag do. All shitfaced, all drunk. It's a pub crawl, and as more and more alcohol got into our systems, our group ended up sort of fragmenting throughout the town. I think it was about 11pm and it ended up just being myself walking to the next pub, some seedy place down Castle Road.\n\nBut anyway, I get into this pub, which seems kinda raucous. It draws me in, my drunken mind apparently wanting loud music and dancing and people hollering unintelligible shit at the top of their lungs. My brain couldn't focus clearly, so at first I couldn't make sense of what was happening, and then I became aware that the singing and the shouting was from a group of women. I leaned up against the bar and tried to focus a little bit more, and then noticed one who seemed very familiar. She was blonde... quite petite... big tits... freckles... AHH! Jake's wife-to-be. Fuck. I'd wandered into her hen do. Shit.\n\nSo I'm standing there, fucking mortified. I don't want to be anywhere near her at this point in time, drunk out of my mind and in the middle of a throng of mental women. Fuck that noise; fuck this noise. I immediately try and make a hasty escape but FUCK he's seen me, and calls me over.\n\n\"Hey Elias!!! ELIAS!\" Oh shit, she does know it's me. \"Jake get bored of you mate? Come on over with us!\" So... fuck it. I'm too polite to turn this sort of shit down, and I'm too drunk to stutter out anything even approaching \"No thank you I need to get back home because I'm totally cunted\". So, reluctantly, I join the throng of mental woman, shouting, singing loudly to absolute shit on the pub's sound system, dancing drunkenly like arseholes. But... Jake's girl... she's grinding up against me. Seems into me. I'd met her a few times before this, and she'd been friendly, sure, but not \"I want to jump your bones\" friendly like she seems now. An hour or so passes. More drinks are had. Everyone is more drunk than before; I'm obliterated. The grinding and the dancing and the flirting escalates until eventually, paralytic and unable to account for my own actions, we start kissing. I excuse myself and run to the toilet to try and avoid the situation - even in this sort of state, I had a vague sense that what I was doing was wrong. But... she followed me. She followed me into the toilets, dragged me into a cubicle, and told me she wanted me, she wanted me to be her last before her marriage held her down for so long. And so... we fucked. In this shitty, grimy pub toilet in some backwater shithole dive bar in fucking Portsmouth I fucked my best friend's fiancee, his bride to be, while he was out somewhere else completely comatose. Unprotected. Shit.\n\nWe finish. We part. There's a bit of recognition on her face that some wrong has been done, as there probably is on mine, because as she leaves, she says... \"none of this actually happened, you don't have a best friend called Jake and you've never been on a pub crawl, nor have you ever had sex with a woman in a pub toilet, let alone your best friend's fiancee.\" I realised that this was true and went home and had some cake.

I figured if I  was out in the open I wouldn't get mugged.\n\nWell, to get to the point; We were in front of the store and he was getting the Xbox out of his car. When I told him that we never negotiated a price, and that I wouldn't go higher than 150$. \nHe told me that that was okay because he would give me a good deal, it was getting a little weird so I asked him how much he wanted; He said \"You got about tree fiddy?\" It was at this point that I realized that he was really an 8 story crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\n\"God dammit loch ness monster, I ain't given you no tree fiddy!!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346372473", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 16, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "**No! That's not what atheism is!**\n\nHow can so many claim to be agnostics, and then suddenly forget what their own term means?\n\n* Agnostic = I do not know X.\n* Gnostic = I do know X.\n\n\"Know\", when we use the term epistemologically, is referring to *knowledge*, or what we know. So basically, an agnostic claims that he cannot know, while a gnostic claims he can. This goes for any issue.\n\nNow, let's take it one step further.\n\nTheist = believes in a defined deity\nAtheism = Not a theist.\n\nBasically, we can now build a square out of these four terms.\n\n* Gnostic Theist\n* Gnostic Atheist\n* Agnostic Theist\n* Agnostic Atheist\n\nThese are our four terms to define those of us who care about whether God exists. I myself am actually an ignostic, which is the belief that the supernatural is poorly defined, and unknown, that wondering if it exists is so horribly pointless.\n\nAnyway, back to the main point. We can now give those four terms above, which are correct, without a doubt (I'll provide links if you seriously don't trust me). Let's define them, shall we?\n\n* Gnostic Theist: Believes in a deity, and claims it can, and is known.\n* Gnostic Atheist: Does not believe in a deity, and claims it can, and is known.\n* Agnostic Theist: Believes in a deity, and claims that it cannot be known. \n* Agnostic Atheist: Does not believe in a deity, and claims that it cannot be known.\n\nThere. Basically, your example with the Lochness Monster claims that all atheists are gnostic, when that is so horribly untrue, that it is almost sickening. \n\nA large majority of atheists happen to be agnostic, which basically renders your point moot. Please, read up, before you decide that all atheists act like they know the complete truth about the universe. They don't. \n\nAlso, please perform quick search on the term, \"proving a negative\". That is now what you have said must be done. If there is no evidence for something, *there is no reason to believe it*. At all. None.

So I know all about cold and wind chill! Although, Florida has made me weak when it comes to cold, I like my sandy beaches and palm trees!\n\nThe tourists, ahh the tourists, they're mostly from Brazil, just hordes of them all with matching t-shirts, all shouting and pushy. I remember one time waiting in line for a ride and one Brazilian was holding a spot open in front of him. I kid you not AT LEAST 20 more people cut in front, I got so angry I just left. The rest of our tourists are from the UK actually! And yes, they're the ones who go all out and buy tropical t-shirts, really get into character. \n\nThey have big conventions at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. I remember when the Harry Potter park opened and they only hired people who had British accents to work there. It was magical. Anyone over here with a British accent is absolutely adored. One thing is interesting to see with UK tourists, it's the clothes they wear, just very subtle differences that are interesting to see here. Lots of Adidas, Puma sportswear. Not that we don't have those brands, they just seem to be more of a staple for UK and Australian tourists.\n\nI actually researched the different types of accents (because I like to make a fool of myself and speak in one with friends, I like to be accurate about it!) and yes I do know what fanny means over there :P I'll never make THAT mistake haha. Thanks so much for all the info. I love reading the \"slang\" in your language. Haha it's fantastic! Never would have thought about visiting the Lake District or the reputable Northumberland.
