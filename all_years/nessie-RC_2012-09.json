Loch Ness Monster ('s current existence) could be disproved within reason since there is a very limited space in which he is supposed to live. Bigfoot/Yeti/etc are so widely (geographically) claimed and broadly defined that it would be unrealistic to claim its existence disproved. \n\nKeep in mind that absence of evidence is NOT evidence of absence. It would be reasonable to say \"There is insufficient evidence to suggest that a Bigfoot exists\" but not responsible to say \"Bigfoot doesn't exist.\"\n\n&gt; Both can be disproven as well as anything Mythbusters has tackled.\n\nYou make a good point here. Maybe I'm being too demanding of a TV show. For what it's worth, most Mythbuster \"experiments\" aren't particularly valid scientific methodology. More so, they're for good entertainment value and giving a rough idea of whether or not an urban legend has some validity to it. It would not likely be very entertaining if they went through exhaustive, scientifically sound experiments. It'd be way too expensive to produce, and most viewers would lose interest when the majority of the show was spent explaining a chi-square, normality, or confidence intervals. Stats aren't sexy. On the other hand, cute redheads and blowing stuff up is.\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346479088", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "After seeing enough of your interesting stories, it's about time that I do so as well. A few years ago, a friend of mine told me about a birthday gift he received from his aunt. His aunt went to a psychic or a fortune teller or something like that and had an entire year of his life predicted for him. According to my friend, most of the predictions that the psychic made eerily came true. Me, of course being a skeptic, decided to see for myself if the psychic was worth it. The psychic's shop was in kind of a crappy part of town. It was wedged in between this vietnamese noodle house and a sex shop: not exactly the classiest part of town. I go in there and there's this awful smell of incense or some other terrible herbs and things like that. At this moment, I wanted to leave, but I decided to persevere and just do it. No one was at the counter at the front, so I decided to peruse the bookshelves of \"mystic tomes\" until the psychic came out. The psychic asked me if there was anything I needed help with, so I told her about my friend and the predictions he got as a gift. The psychic then told me to come to sit down with her across a crystal ball so she could \"map my personality\" or some crap like that. I didn't really want to, but I decided to do so anyways. So the psychic took my hands in her really coarse hands and placed them on the crystal ball. After some mumbling for a few minutes, she said that she was done, and she would have results in 20 minutes, so I should wait for a while while she prepared the prediction. I looked around the shop again and even picked out a few snake eggs from a basket to buy seeing that I had never seen snake eggs before. So when it all was done, She had a little pile of papers bound up in a folder and I put the snake eggs I found on the counter to buy. But before I was able to take the folder in my hand, this red-haired guy barges into the store with bandanas around his face and totting a gun. He start yelling at me to get down and pointed his gun at the psychic. They yelled something at the psychic that I can't remember, because at that time, I decided that I could take on this guy by myself. I crawled behind him as he aimed at the psychic, and I tackled him to the ground. Unfortunately for me, he fired a shot at me before I could get the gun out of his hand, and the bullet grazed my leg. This guy must have never used a gun before because the recoil really surprised him and I was able to wrench the gun out of his hand and pin him to the floor. But in some sort of superhuman manner, he got up from under me and sprinted the hell out of the shop. I wanted to go after him, but I had a bit of trouble running with this cut on my leg from the grazed bullet. The psychic helped me up and asked if I needed to go the hospital. I declined the offer and said \"Can I just get the things I bought?\" So the psychic said that she would give a discount for saving her life, and put the items all together on in a paper bag. I took the paper bag and proceeded to walk out. The psychic shouted out, and said \"Hey. I said I'd give you a discount, not that it would be free.\" I went back and asked \"How much will it be?\" She looks me straight in the eye and says, \"It'll be about tree fiddy.\" It was at that exact moment that I realized the psychic was actually a 7-story-tall crustacean from the Paleolithic era! I was like \"God dammit, Loch Ness Monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I took the paper bag and ran as best as I could out of there.\nTL;DR: While going to a psychic, I stopped a robbery and got shot in the leg.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346524824", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "My own story ..... though hardly counting as a \"lunatic\" .....\n\nAbout a year back a good friend of mine and I wound up stumbling into the topic of the Loch Ness Monster. Specifically the famous \"surgeons photo\". Both of us agreed it wasn't real, but we disagreed on the explanation. I was of the opinion it was an otter. He was of the opinion that it was a staged hoax.\n\nThe debate lasted several weeks. It included me showing him pics of the [second photo](http://www.loch-ness.org/images/surg2ndpic.jpg) and explaining that if it was a hoax they pranksters would have had to built two of them, one for each angle of the neck. But the explanation of it being an otter would fit much more cleanly.\n\nI linked him to discussions on vintage toy collector forums that go over how toy submarines of the era did not have the technology to do what the \"confession\" of the hoax claimed it did. I explained to him that if the goal of the hoax was to humiliate a newspaper / get revenge on a newspaper, then the confession should have been right after the paper published the photo and not years later on a deathbed. I pointed out the \"confession\" did not actually come from the person who had supposedly done it and was only collected after two professional debunkers had nagged and nagged and nagged some guy demanding that he confess before it was too late.\n\nTo strengthen the otter explanation I had to show him [this clip](http://www.naturefootage.com/video_clips/TSC03_252) showing the classic nessie head shape and [this clip](http://www.naturefootage.com/video_clips/MB06_111) showing otters swimming single file that mimics the classic multi-hump nessie pattern.\n\nIt took a lot of work but he agreed in the end. Occam's razor won out in the end when I explained that an elaborately planed and carefully executed hoax with a perfect coverup that lasted generations was not the \"simpler\" explanation.

{"body": "I used to have this friend named Sheridan in high school.  In 10th grade we met but we didn't really talk that much, 11th was about the same but senior year we became really, really good friends.\n\nWe hung out everyday and used to tell each other all about our girlfriends and such.  He was my most trusted friend at the time, which was kind of weird for me since I had some weird trust issues from always getting other friends using me and not really wanting to be my friends.. if that makes sense\n\nBut that's not important.\n\nAnyways, there's an amusement park called Lagoon a few miles from where we live, it's a pretty fun place and it's a good hang out spot in the summer for teens.  We spent the entire year being friends and when the amusement park opened for the year in early June, we decided we'd both ask out a girl if they wanted to go to the amusement park with us and just hang out for the day.\n\nI ask out two girls before one says yes, he only needs to ask out one.\n\nThe day there was pretty fun, we went on rides, played the side games, at lunch and dinner there, and overall had a really fun time.\n\nTowards the end of the evening we decided to switch into our swimming suits (which we had brought with us) and go to the waterpark section of the amusement park.\n\nSo, we get our stuff and go into the water park.  We haven't changed into our swim suits yet so the girls go into the girl locker room and me and Sheridan go into the boys locker room.\n\nFor some reason, Sheridan got really self conscious about his body all of the sudden.  I asked him jokingly what was wrong and he got very offended, saying things like, \"Fuck off, dude.\" and \"Leave me the fuck alone.\"\n\nI'd be joking with him, but he sounded very serious, so I decided to lay off and get dressed.  Instead of getting dressed with me he runs with his swimming suit into a bathroom stall.  I get dressed and go out of the locker rooms to wait for him.\n\nAfter 5 minutes the girls come out but Sheridan still hasn't come out. Another 5 minutes goes by and me and the girls are starting to get worried.  I tell them I'll go check on him.\n\nI walk into the locker room and can see his feet and clothes everywhere under one of the stalls. (The locker room and bathrooms were in the same room, by the way, this might be confusing)  \n\nI thought he was masturbating so I get a genius plan to pop out under the stall and say \"boo\" or something.\n\nI creep up to the side and slide under the stall and shout \"STOP MASTURBATING\"\n\nHe was masturbating.  But that's not the bad part, I expected that.  The scary part was I discovered he was a hermaphrodite.  I would have never known.  I have nothing against hermaphrodites but I was absolutely shocked at finding this out.  It explained why Sheridan was self conscious about taking his clothes off in front of me and everything.\n\nHe started freaking the fuck out when he saw my facial expression change so quickly. \n\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK? OH, GOD\" he kept saying over and over.  I kept saying \"sorry\" as much as I could but he was absolutely furious.\n\nI felt absolutely awful, still do in a way.  I get him to calm down and he starts yelling at me, \"I need you to never tell anyone.\"\n\nI say something like, \"Ok dude, I will never tell anyone, I promise. Is there anything else I can do?\" , he responds, \"No.\" but I keep insisting that I do something else for him.  He keeps telling me no, so I suggest we go swimming now.  As we're walking out he says, \"Wait, I need something else.\"  \"What do you need?\" I ask.  \"I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Sheridan was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness monster had gotten me again!  \"Damnit Nessie, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as he swam off into the distance.\n\nI didn't get laid that night, neither did any of those girls.  I'm sure they were confused when I tried to tell them the story and they probably didn't believe me.\n\n**TL;DR: Friend has a secret that I never would have expected, I find out the hard way.**", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346555451", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1125, "controversiality": 0}

We were alone together at the counter (I worked fast food as all teenagers once did), so I cleared my throat and went for it. I asked her to go out with me.\nShe said, \"sure\".

So to even it, could you spare about three fiddy?\"\nWell it was around that time that I noticed the girl I had been crushing on for about 2 years was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era.

{"body": "&gt;I myself think of the modern incarnation of Western cultures as very flawed (largely thanks to liberalism and post-industrialization) but I still consider them to be superior to islamic cultures by a wide margin. I think that is about what most people on the modern identitarian right think. \n\nI think it's not possible to build a non-flawed civilization. Our current era has its own problems and advantages, but so did every era before it. We've committed our own fair share of genocides as well after all, both against our own people (extermination of the Cathars) and against other people (Native Americans).\n\nLiberalism has sought to solve some flaws in our old societal model, creating new ones in the process. This is inevitable when you try to make changes in a complex system, you will see unintended side effects. One big negative side effect we've seen so far is dysgenics, as our society is currently undergoing genetic deterioration. The main flaws we suffer from today are our dependence upon non-renewable resources, pollution, dysgenics, lack of autonomy and materialism.\n\nA growing number of people are beginning to discover that this current way of life is not sustainable, and many believe that it should not be sustained. Hence they do what societies in crisis have always done, they try to look back to the last sane era that we've known. As every era, this era will fall apart again, allowing something new to emerge through the cracks. If you look carefully, you can already see the world of tomorrow through the cracks in the current.\n\nI believe there is little we can do to influence this process. We don't really have much influence over the era we're in, the level of technology of a society tends to determine the era it is in. What we will likely see is a desynchronization. As a result of low transportation costs, the world has been homogenized to the same level of technology. Hence Aboriginals in Australia for example have cell phones, whereas 200 years ago they were still living in the Paleolithic era.\n\nAs the price of oil increases and eventually becomes unaffordable, transportation costs will increase, and the world will desynchronize as a result. Some place that have access to coal will likely manage to maintain some level of industrial civilization, but others will become very isolated. It will be very interesting to watch.\n\n&gt;I think they like white cultures from a low-culture perspective. As in they like country, rock, and metal, and NASCAR/motorsports, and getting drunk in dingy pubs. They seem to try to feign interest in high culture though, which is pretty amusing. \n\nSpot on.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1346610677", "subreddit": "new_right", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

Mark's parents started to cry because it turned out Mark was in a car crash a month prior. My grandpa was aways a bit darker after that, as in he was depressed and wouldn't do much. At this part in the story my grandpa started to cry. I looked at him with a look of shock in my face because I never saw my grandpa cry before.

{"body": "The article tries to blame Apartheid:\n\n&gt;Jewkes believes South Africa's history of racial division and associated trauma is part of the reason of the high incidence of sexual violence in the country.\n\n&gt;\"Apartheid has contributed to culture of impunity surrounding rape in South Africa,\" said Jewkes. Men who were abused or experienced trauma during their childhood are much more likely to rape, she said, adding that apartheid destroyed family life, fostering violence and anti-social behavior.\n\n&gt;The apartheid period also saw very little enforcement of common law, which has contributed to a culture of impunity, said Jewkes.\n\nYet, neighbouring Lesotho has the highest rate of rape of any country on the planet, for which apartheid can't be held responsible.\n\nA better, but more depressing explanation is the theory that in warmer climates, rape was a more viable reproductive strategy for men during the paleolithic era than in colder climates, as due to a lack of strong winters, there was no season during which a woman was dependent upon a male provider to take care of her and her child. It's a bit more difficult to hunt when you're pregnant or carry a child with you.\n\nThe positive conclusion would be that if rape has been endemic throughout sub-Saharan African history, African women alive today are largely the descendants of those who were not traumatized by rape. You would hope that their mind has more inbuilt psychological defences than the Western mind, which seems to be mostly lacking them when it comes to rape.\n\nI think we can ask which of the two came first in African society. Endemic rape, or the banal attitude towards sexual intercourse? Could the treatment of sex as a banality in African culture be the product of those women who were traumatized by rape being mostly wiped from the gene pool?\n\nThese are questions that are offensive to many without a doubt, but they are questions that have to be asked, because sexual abuse doesn't exist to serve as ammunition in political debates, but as an epidemic that afflicts people who have no way of defending themselves against it, and it has to be stopped.

That requires you to assume the level of resources a person would have access to, which would vary incredibly by time and place.  It would be better to say that the optimal strategy would be to take care of as many offspring as you have resources for.\n\n&gt; Remember, that our instincts evolved during the paleolitic era, when child mortality was very high, food and resources were scarce, and life was short.\n\nInfant mortality was very high, but life was not short.  In fact, paleolithic life expectancy was pretty much higher than any point in human history up until the early 20th century.  Life*span* (the time you were expected to live if you made it past childhood) was in the mid 50s, higher than in classical Rome.\n\nAs far as resources go, studies of modern hunter gatherer societies suggest that although there were times of scarcity and times of plenty, resources in general were not scarce.  \n\n&gt; For a male, it would make sense to focus all his time and energy one one family, while opportunistically spraying his DNA all over the female population, with an off chance that at least some of those extra \"bastard\" children would survive.\n\nI don't think there's any evidence of this beyond wishful thinking, especially given that most humans participated in some form of communal child raising up until the early 20th century.  Hunter/gatherer tribes almost unanimously show communal child raising, meaning that the survival of a particular child is no longer exclusively dependent on the fitness of his father, but rather on the fitness of the tribe itself.\n\n&gt;But if you doubt me, just look at the sexual model of behavior in third world countries, where one man often has 7 or more children with one wife, AND several \"bastards\" with other women.\n\nSo in your second sentence you talk about our instincts developing during the paleolithic era, but then turn around and point to modern humans as evidence?

Anyway, everything was going smoothly, we'd all had a few drinks and I was feeling pretty drunk when we stumbled into the third bar of the night. And there she was, sitting at the bar, looking nonchalantly around. To be honest I was stunned to see her there but I decided to go over and say hi. She was surprised to see me too, and conversation picked up quickly while the drinks flowed. After a while and more alcohol, we ended up in a taxi together on the way back to my place (oh god what was I thinking?!). I'm going to spare you the details of what happened next and i'll skip to the morning. When I woke up I realised what I'd done and awkwardly started to put my clothes back on. As I was doing so I realised I'd left my watch at home; she was blocking the clock so i sheepishly asked her what time it was as she roused, she turned to the clock and she said \"oh, about tree fiddy\".

Anyways, I went through the entire quest, and my heart was beating like crazy when it came time to actually fight Elvarg.  One of the things I remember to this day (like 5 years later) was me having no idea how to get into that little area where Elvarg was.  Anyways, I finally made it in and I nearly panicked when Elvarg breathed out some goddamn fire at me.  But I regained my composure, took a dose my strength potion and activated my weak f2p prayer.  The fight was going well and I didnt take too much damage thanks to my rune armor (without a platebody of course) and the damage I did take was canceled by my swordfish, I brought as many as I could.  Suddenly, right when Elvarg was almost dead, I lost aggro and Elvarg just kinda stood there.  I was understandably confused and slightly disoriented, but I attempted to attack Elvarg again but nothing happened.  We both just stood there.  I figured it was some kind of glitch so I jokingly typed in chat, \"What's going on, Elvarg?\"\nI didn't expect a reply but to my surprise, I saw yellow text above Elvarg, \"Imma need about tree fiddy.\"   It was about that time I realized that Elvarg was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  I replied, \"I ain't giving you no god damn tree fiddy you god damn lock ness monster! Get your own god damn money!\" and quickly removed the monster's head.

Joe got really abgry and started sputtering stuff like \"Oh here you go, starting this shit again.\" I apologize to him and blame the booze. He's not having any of it and makes me wait with him until she comes back from the bathroom.

Well me and my other two roommates at this point were starting to get upset about the poor living conditions and confronted our 4th roommate, we'll call him Steve. Well Steve here wanted nothing to do with us when we approached him, told us to mind our own business. \n\nThe next day I was in the bathroom of our apartment minding my own business when Steve barged in and asked if I could do him a favor. Startled, I said \"Sure, what is it?\"\n\nSteve looked me dead in the eyes and said \"I need to borrow some money but I don't want to talk about it. I hesitated and asked \"How much?\" Steve just replied \"I'm gonna need about tree fiddy.\" And at that moment I realized Steve was actually a 500 foot tall monster from the paleolithic era and I just shouted \"God damnit Loch Ness Monster I ain't got three fifty, now get out of my bathroom.\" But he couldn't because we were stooled in by my roommates.

Tell me why or not!\n\nMy completely honest answer is, I don't know. I have to admit I haven't spent any time yet looking into the pro's and cons of both decisions.\n\nThe problem with this decision going to a vote, is a there is a lot of people who are also in the same boat as me, but instead of aiming to educate themselves on it, they'll just vote yes for the idiotic bigoted reasons of not wanting to have the English in charge of them.\n\n\n&gt;Do you wear a kilt sometimes and if you do, do you wear underwear under it? If you don't wear a kilt all the time: when do you wear it?\n\nJeans and a T-Shirt. Wore a kilt once when my friends got married. VERY uncomfortable piece of clothing.

Which one is it and what is your favorite? Please justify!\n\nThere's no official national anthem of Scotland. It comes under the British anthem of 'God Save The Queen'. But many Scots consider 'Flower of Scotland' to be the unofficial anthem. I know the first line, and that's it.\n\n&gt;Do you think Nessie is real?\n\nDon't think there's some kind of spooky dinosaur monster, but one theory that's out there is that it's a type of fish, the name of which escapes me, that typically when found in freshwater, has been known to grow up to 12ft in length. Would certainly fit with what people claim to have seen.\n\n&gt;Whats your favorite Whisky brand? Do you prefer Whisky from the Highland, Speyside, Lowland or Island?

Use a framing square, or a nice square thing like a piece of paper, to mark a rectangle completely encompassing the break.  \n2.  Cut out the offending area with a sharp blade, a drywall saw, a Ginsu knife, whatever.  Since it's a ceiling, the ceiling piece should be resting on the wall piece, make sure you dig that part out. Cut the corner really carefully with a razor before you start working on the actual drywall.  \n3.   Acquire a chunk of drywall about four inches wider and longer than the hole.    \n4.  ON THE BACK of the drywall, the cardboard color side, copy the size of your hole in the middle of the piece.\n5.  CAREFULLY cut the paper and part of the rock so you can peel the rock away from the front paper.  Ideally the rock will fit snugly into the hole, and the paper will extend two inches on all sides.  If you got lucky and there's a gap at the top of the wall piece where you can rest the ceiling piece, you can trim away the paper so it nudges into the gap.  (Make sure to accomodate for the depth of nudge on the opposite side of the rectangle.)  Dryfit to ensure snug fit.\n6.  Acquire drywall patching compound.\n7.  If there is a stud or similar to drive a screw into, you're golden.  If not, you might want to toenail a piece of 2x4 across the middle of the hole so your patch doesn't start to sag.  \n8.  Liberally butter the inside edges of the hole, and the parts where the paper will overlap with your patching compound.  Fit the slug into the hole, press the paper into the compound, drive a screw or two far enough to create a dimple in the paper, but not far enough to break the surface.  (If you aren't able to screw it up there, brace it firmly from below.)  Now butter the edges of the paper out onto the good parts of the ceiling, about 2 inches further than the edge of the paper.\n9.  Let it dry. remove the support, and spread compound across the entire patch.  Let it dry again.  Sand it smooth -BY HAND - no power tools.  \n10.  Acquire drywall texturing spray.  Practice on a scrap piece.  The process is:  Spray the stuff, let it dry for 60 seconds, knock it smooth with a wide putty knife.  Try again.

To have a way to get people to buy more keys to unbox an item that counts kills which other than that is just a normal item. \n\nReskins, they take an item they already made and reskin it to get more items out there for people to get that are the exact same as another item (I.e. postal pummeled, lollichop, nessies nine iron, rainblower, wanga prick, and the unarmed combat) for promos it's understandable but for something valve makes I would call that a bit lazy since they could give it unique stats. \n\nFocusing on hats instead of balancing weapons or adding more, understandable that weapon ideas are harder than making a hat but all they have to do is ask the community for stats on items, I've seen pitched stat ideas that are better than the ones valve makes.

I sprinted as hard as I could to catch up with her, and eventually made it beside her. We jogged for about an  hour, getting to know each other over some small chit chat. In the end, she told me she jogged in that park every Thursday, and would to love jog with me again, and maybe get coffee afterwards. \n\nIt was at that moment that I learned that, if I get off my ass, I can do whatever I want. Well, by that time I was sweating buckets, so I decided to hit up a lemonade stand on the way home. Thankfully there was one about two blocks away that sold pretty good lemonade. When I got up to the counter, I asked him how much a tall cup of lemonade was, his only reply, in broken English was, \"tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347330675", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ahhh now this is a thread I can spring for.\n\nTo start off, my buddy Dan has always been there being a wingman for me in college.  He’s not the most attractive looking guy, but he’s got a knack for convincing the hotter girl’s ugly friend to leave so that I can move in.  Inevitably, he takes a majority of them home (he’s usually a bit drunk by the end of the night, so he doesn’t really care if they’re so big a footstep would register on the Richter scale).  Dan is actually not that good at flirting with the girls who know they’re hot shit, so he typically leaves that to me.  Whether I can hook up with the girl or not, he doesn’t care since he gets it in almost every time anyway.\n\nSo back to our story.  We’re at the college bar and I spy my prey: an above average looking girl who’s nervously chatting it up with her less than attractive friend.  I don’t mean to sound too shallow, but she had something going on with her face.  Dan turns to me and asks if I can be his wingman and does a head nod in the direction of the girl I had my eye on.  Since he’s pretty much always been there as my wingman, I decide to let him have this one and go up to her friend to try to pull her away.  We’re doing a lot of chatting and she starts playing with my shirt.  “Success!” I think.  I ask her if she wants to go get a drink so we head closer to the bar.  Dan goes over to talk to his girl of the night.  I take another look at my girl (who’s name is Christina – just to put a name to the imaginary face) and realize that I’ll need a few more drinks in me to keep this going.\n\nWe get pretty drunk and I start looking around for Dan to tell him I want to call it a night.  He’s nowhere to be found.  Well good for him!  He got his girl to go home with him!  I turn to tell Christina that I’m ready to go home and it was nice to meet her and I’m met with a kiss.  A huge, disgusting, sloppy, and slobbery kiss.  I was drunk, but not drunk enough to realize that it was like rubbing peanut butter on my face and having a fucking camel lick it off.  She buys a round of shots and then decides after I down mine that she doesn’t want it and makes me take that one too.  At this point, I’m getting drunk as fuck.  I ask her back to my place and the slobbering continues in my bed.  If you ever were curious as to what it’s like to get head from a camel, it feels better than forcing a lactose intolerant kid to eat a fresh bucket of whipped cream.  Next thing I know, we’re going at it while she continues to slobber all over my face.  I guess the slobbering got drunk me off because I had no problems with my whiskey dick at this point.  So we finish up and I clean myself up.  I ask her if she wants me to call her a cab to get home and she says she can handle it.  I ask her how much money she’d want for the ride home.  She turns to me and whispers in my ear “I need about tree fiddy.”  It was at this point that I turn the lights on and turn to look at Christina and realize that she’s about eight stories tall and crustacean from the Paleozoic era.  I said “Dammit monster! Get out of my bed! I ain’t giving you no tree fiddy!”\n\nAnd that was the story of how I helped my buddy Dan get a good lay while I took the greatest wingman duties of my life.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347332514", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 33, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Anyone who *really, truly* believes that the same US government that failed to cover up things as (comparatively) small as warrantless wire tapping, secret CIA prisons, Guantanamo Bay torture, and that CIA leak in the mid-2000s is actually capable of orchestrating the murder of 3000 Americans is a delusional moron who thinks the world is actually like an action/thriller movie. Whoever made the Loose Change nonsense deserves to die alone, for all its [lies, blatant truth stretching, and inaccuracies](http://911research.wtc7.net/reviews/loose_change/) that millions of impressionable people took as gospel because he zoomed in some grainy video stills and pictures with spooky music in the background (much like 98% of current programming on the History channel). \n\nLet's think about it what pulling a 9/11 would an entail- hundreds of people in on it, like demolition experts, FAA officials and employees monitoring radar/air traffic in the Northeast, policemen, firefighters, large numbers of Bush administration and CIA and Pentagon/military personnel, and so on. We're talking about packing the WTC with thousands of pounds of explosives, with no one noticing. We're talking about shooting missiles into government buildings (wouldn't taking down the wall of the Pentagon with explosive charges the same way foil-hats think they did the WTC make a hell of a lot more sense?). **This is the same government and CIA that failed to keep the Chinese from getting at our secret stealth helicopter technology used in the Bin Laden raid, remember?**\n\nSo, the same government we nearly all ridicule as largely inept and wasteful in most of its practices somehow pulled off the single greatest, most complex hoax of all time, *flawlessly*...and not a *single* fucking person out of the countless number who would have had to have been involved in it has come forward yet, or even leaked something? The biggest conspiracy *ever* happened, and then for a decade afterward...*nothing?* You *really* believe that? Tons of other shit the US government does ends up in WikiLeaks and the internet at large, but the single biggest alleged conspiracy in the history of the world doesn't? \n\nMaybe that's because it *didn't happen*. Maybe the US government really was just caught with its pants down, just like it was with 2008 financial crisis. Maybe the US government took advantage of a national tragedy for its own gain, without actually causing it on its own. But that all just makes too much damn sense, doesn't it? \"No, there just has to be more to it!!\" There isn't, sorry. Reality is often boring. \n\n\"But they needed an excuse to invade the Middle East for oil!!!\"\n\nAnd surely the most failproof, simplest way to do that was with a 9/11! Oh wait, that's retarded because 9/11 would be an insanely complex means (with countless loose ends to tie up after) to an ends that could be achieved by simply manipulating the American public via the media with wildly exaggerated threats of WMDs in the hands of a country we already hated from the Gulf War...which *is* what the Bush administration and CIA did, along with again taking advantage of a national tragedy for its own gain. That *is* what happened.  \n\n\nThe facts have been in for a long time now- the WTC melted [because steel loses half its strength at those temperatures](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center#steel), and surely you don't need to be an engineer to understand that half-strength steel isn't holding up a 110 story building. As for the rest of the most popular 9/11 bullshit theories,  Popular Mechanics debunked most of them in that link, as did the Loose Change viewing guide linked near the top. \n\n\nSadly, even in the face of science and logical reasoning, people who believe in 9/11 being a government hoax are hopelessly lost. Why? Because much like the moon hoax idiots, cults, people who believe in the paranormal, etc.,  they don't want to hear why they're wrong because they like to think they are more enlightened than \"everyone else\" and/or have escaped the \"system\" by not falling for the evil big mean government lies. They want to believe, and it's as simple as that (it's well proven that people with previously held beliefs are difficult to get to change their minds, even in the presence of conclusive evidence to the contrary). These people like to think they live in a V for Vendetta or 1984-esque society, because that kind of a political world is much more interesting and thrilling than reality (which is that government officials are throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks, so they will be re-elected). Again, reality is usually much more boring than the parallel world portrayed on TV, in books, and in the movies; that's why we all love to partake in those things- they are escapism, they are more exciting than real life. \n\nEdit- Because I just thought of it, why on earth would the Republican party leaders risk getting caught pulling a 9/11 with their guy in office? It would be the end of their party, and all the tons and tons of money it generates for everyone involved. Bush pulling a 9/11 would be like Steve Jobs going to a casino and betting all of Apple on a single number in Roulette (pulling of a 9/11 flawlessly probably has similar odds of success, right?). No political party is going to risk its existence on something with as many possibilities for failure as a 9/11. As much as we all like to call the Rep and Dem parties \"stupid,\" there's a reason they are still in power after so many decades- it's because they are very, very smart and know how to play the game. Killing 300 And for that matter, no government is, either- the same point about ruining a system that pays out well to all of those in charge and all those well connected is as equally true for the US government as it is for either of the two major political parties. A 9/11 is an extremely high-risk way to get something that countless other, less risky measures could also obtain, which according to well proven socio-economic theory about human behavior is exactly why they wouldn't choose to do a 9/11. A failed and exposed 9/11 would mean the end of the United States, quite literally...the end of the golden goose. No one who is a beneficiary of the golden goose wants that. \n\nThe fact is that there isn't a single credible \"9/11 Truth\" argument that doesn't eventually come down to \"well, you can't prove that they *didn't* do it!\" or something similar. That's the basis of 9/11 Truth, alien abduction, ghost stories, Bigfoot, etc.- their proponents mistake the inability to fully disprove something as evidence that the thing in question actually exists. There is no 9/11 smoking gun, there's just smoke and mirrors: blurry photographs, illogical conclusions, uncorroborated witnesses and testimony, spooky background music, etc...like every other false, Loch Ness Monster-ish tale in modern lore. If the Loch Ness monster was an actual living species, we'd know about it by now. If 9/11 was a trick, we'd know. This isn't difficult to understand, unless you are a 14 year old kid who doesn't know any better like every single one of the kids in my high school who passed Loose Change around. Hell, I even believed it for a little while, until I actually looked into its claims and realized they were the ramblings of an insane young adult with no real knowledge of anything he was saying. \n\nThe 9/11 Truth movement in a sentence: a couple asshole college students made a \"documentary\" filled with  uninformed ramblings about sky scraper architecture and how aircraft mechanics/components and aircraft collisions/crashes, construction engineering, chemistry, demolition, fires, cruise missiles, etc. work...and PEOPLE. LISTENED. TO. THEM. Millions and millions of people fucking believed everything they said, without question! Thank heavens Youtube didn't exist then, or it would have been worse. If anything, people shouldn't be afraid of the government pulling a 9/11, they should be much more afraid of the internet's potential to rapidly and conclusively mislead millions and millions of people with a viral video that has little to no basis in fact. The fact that someone or some group with bad intentions hasn't already figured out how to pull some serious shit doing this is a minor miracle. A properly timed video release could swing an election before anyone had time to actually think for themselves, and then it would be too late. For example, some interest group who wants Romney elected could anonymously release a vague \"Loose Change\"-ish video about Obama with all sorts of batshit claims that would wreck his image in the week before the election. If it was done right, it would be on Reddit, everyone's grandma's chain email lists, Twitter, Facebook, etc. in the matter of a day or two at most. That's much scarier than a 9/11, because it could actually happen, and happen easily, with grave consequences for society and little to no risk to anyone who made it.

Does Russell's teapot exist? Does a brain slug exist on your head? By your logic, you should not deny any of these things as you cannot absolutely prove that any of them don't exist, and should remain strictly agnostic. But once you find yourself saying \"*I am agnostic to whether there is a brain slug on my head or not, because I can't prove there isn't. He may be deceiving my brain into thinking that he's not there*\", you're being pretty silly and it's not that far a leap to full on solipsism, where you find yourself unable to accept even reality itself.\n\nJust because you can't ever *prove* something to be false, that doesn't mean it's unreasonable to hold to the position that, based on the current evidence (or lack thereof), it doesn't seem to exist. As long as you're open minded enough to change your position should better evidence come to light, that's fine. If you always require proof, then you're never going to be able to hold to *any* position because there can *never* be absolute proof of anything.\n\nIt's slightly better than those who see belief in black and white terms (you either completely believe something, or you completely disbelieve it), but not by much. All you've done is add another state right in the middle called \"*agnosticism*\" which is basically no position at all. The trick is to discard the idea of these distinct states. It's a spectrum! You can be somewhere between holding absolutely *no* opinion, and completely believing something with absolute certainty. Coming to a position is not like a switch. It's a journey along this spectrum. Many people have attempted to describe these in between states with more labels such as \"*agnostic atheism*\", \"*weak atheism*\", \"*strong atheism*\", \"*positive atheism*\" etc. And in fact, once you start thinking about it like that, it seems that it might even be a two dimensional spectrum.

{"body": "A topic made for me!\n\nSo last year, six friends and I, from Australia, went on a roadtrip in the US. Rough summary, we drove something like 9000 miles in a rad old Dodge Ram Van, Going from LA to New York through the Southern States, up through Canada, camping in the national parks on our way back down the west coast, ending back up in LA with a few days in Vegas to end the trip. This took us six weeks.\n\nOn our first drive, learning to stay on the wrong side of the road, we got stopped coming in to Texas from New Mexico. They'd set up a sort of random checkpoint at this point on the highway.\n\nNow, let me do a quick description of our motley crew: at this point there were six of us, since one guy was joining us halfway in New York. The rest of us are all covered in desert dust and sweating like bastards, it's probably 45C and our A/C overheated the car if we left it on. Everyone has long or stupid hair except for me. They're all wearing band shirts, connies or thongs (sandals, whatever you kents call 'em!), skinny denim shorts or jeans. They all look like they're in bands. Most of them are, about five out of the seven. Different bands though!\n\nSo, back to the checkpoint. After a whole lot of other drama, unrelated to this tale (hint: sniffer dawgs!!) the totally cool border guy stops and asks us: 'Are you guys in a band?'\n\nWe all pause. 'Nah, not really.'\n\n'You should say you are... you know, just for the fuck of it. See ya later boys!' and this guy just waves us off.\n\nWe lingered on it for a bit, but that's about it. See, these guys were in bands, and whenever someone asked us, we'd just say yeah, 'he is in this band, he's in that one, bla bla bla.' It took way too much effort - we didn't have the time, six weeks is a tight schedule for 9000 miles! I kept a running tally in my notebook though, and by the time we reached Raleigh, it was well over thirty people had asked us.\n\nI think we made it to Washington DC before the possibilities hit us. We were out at some tapas-sushi-cocktail fusion place, and the waitress asked us if we were in a band. It was like some group delusion fell over us. I'd just started hitting sake, which always makes me puke but guarantees a good night.\n\n'Why yes. Yes we are in a band.' The waitress goes goddamn wild, and then starts running back behind the bar and kitchen to grab people. We throw the most intense and productive group huddle ever: 'What are we called? Who does what? What songs do we play? What are we doing here?!'\n\nWe nailed out the details quick smart. Most of it was based on reality. The guy who was a singer in real life, sang in real life. We had our keyboardist. No drummer, so the other guy not in a bad got that. I have no musical talent, and don't look like I'm in a band, so I became tour manager - again, a hint of truth, because I was pretty much responsible for buying the car, group funds, booking hotels and hostels and all that along the way. Everything was... a little bit true, and mostly a lie.\n\nBut what were we called? That was obvious. We'd named our car already: Ramona the Ram Van. Named after Ramona Flowers of Scott Pilgrim fame, of course. I was a little head over the heels for that fictional character, and it was a bit of a running joke in the group. God she's cool (but aloof). So that was us: Ramona.\n\nSo this lady runs back, with like three bar staff. They're asking us all sorts of things. What music we play, what kinda shows we're doing. We pretty quickly came up with some essential rules.\n\nWe'd never say it to people we were staying with - if we were in a hostel and someone asked, no, we weren't a band. Anywhere else was fine. We never played in the city we were in - only the one before and after, this city we're in right now? 'Naw, just a quick stopover for some sight-seeing.' When people asked for venues, we'd name places we'd been in the last city, and for the upcoming city people would usually know something from music DVDs or classic shows we'd seen or heard about. If they asked us to sing a song, we'd be reluctant, and then all drum and hum along to something the 'singer' played in his actual band. We all knew each other's songs, so it was all good.\n\nNow, it got way out of hand, just too silly. We'd go to like, museums, and the ticket lady would say, 'are you guys in a band?' Why yes, we are. 'Oh my god! Where are you from?' Australia. We'd go off, go through the whole venue and come out at the exit - only to find the ticket woman and every other employee waiting for us.\n\n'Weeeee got a band in the house!' the lady would yell, and everyone would clap and yell. 'Hey,' she said, 'we were talking, and we think we'll all come to your show. Are you guys playing in DC tonight?'\n\nWell, we're terribly sorry... we're not playing here! We're leaving tomorrow morning and playing in New York City! Sorry love! And we'd sweep out, leaving people a bit disappointed, but mostly elated that they'd met a band.\n\nWe'd get dinner, and we'd sign autographs for the waitresses. Even me, the sneaky tour manager, signed napkins for people. They started asking us how big we were in Australia. It would change, from time to time. We started small. Halfway through and it was like, 'you know Kings of Leon? Yeah we supported their whole tour in Australia last year,' and people would just froth at the thought of it.\n\nAt one point, we were walking around the natural history museum, and a girl walked up to a couple of my friends, who were just chilling. 'Hey, are you guys in a band?' Yeah, we are. 'What are you called?' We're called Ramona. 'I've never heard of you.' Do you listen to much Australian music? 'No.' There you go then!\n\nThis teenager runs back to her friends, and they're all yelping at each other. 'Who are they?' one asks. 'Uhhh, Ramona, from Australia, as if you don't know!' Then they'd come back and get pictures taken.\n\nIt was all brilliant, swimmingly well. Funnily, pretty much no one ever whipped out the internet on their phone to look us up. The one or two that did, I'd just chime in as the tour manager and say, 'oh, we're gearing up for a big tour back home, so it's down and being redone at the moment.'\n\nWe hit our first bump in San Fran. We were eating at this rad Mexican place, and this absolute hotty from the table behind us leans over and asks if we're in a band. Well, actually, we are, I say. We chit chat with this girl and her two friends for a while. They're two guys, I'm fairly sure they're gay but who knows. I am smitten by the woman. We hang around for a while, and as we go to leave, they ask us where we're going. Well, there was this bar near our hotel called 'The Owl Tree' that we were thinking of checking out. Sure thing, they said they'd follow us.\n\nWe didn't expect anything, so as we're sitting in The Owl Tree, chatting about how heart-meltingly attractive the girl is, they walk in. They kept their promise. They come up to us eager to tell us a story... as we'd left the Mexican place, the table next to them asked them who we were. 'Fallout Boy!' they said, and the two teenage girls swooned.\n\nAnyway, I spend the next three or four hours talking to this girl about my life as a tour manager. By the end I'm off my rocker drunk, but I'm keeping it together. This girl was called Bertina or something - worked as a manager at GAP. I've never heard the name Bertina, or even sure I heard it right, so I've just resorted to call her Brittanica since then, since it seems funnier. Anyway, we end up at a dubstep club. I'm buying everyone else expensive drinks and saying, 'hey, the production company is paying for it!' while furiously gesturing that those other kents are paying me back tomorrow, when the act is up. Well, I go off to the bathroom, come out, and everyone is gone. Turns out one of my friends enjoyed those G&amp;Ts I was getting him a little too much and got everyone kicked out. Even Brittanica. I was devastated. I rang everyone, got lost, eventually found the hotel, bought beer as was eventually asked of me, and got up to the room to find everyone passed out anyway. I was raging!\n\nI don't think Britannica ever found out the truth. Her friend, one of the possibly gay guys, had bust out his phone and looked it up, I think, and was suspicious, but I never saw him tell the others.\n\nLater, after we'd all mostly gone home, one of our friends remained, visiting some family in Colorado. He was at the airport bar, and a guy drummed up a conversation. Asked him if he was a band. Apparently, on his own, he was hesitant to keep it up, but ended up going with it anyway. The guy busts out his phone and tries to look us up. My friend tries to brush it off, gives my little tour excuse. He finds some band on myspace called Ramona. 'Is this you guys?' I say yes, he says he doesn't believe us, and he is going to tell everyone unless we give him about tree fiddy. Then it dawned on us, we told that gawt darmed lochness monster he aint nevah gettin no tree fiddy.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347397107", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Oh my. So many people commented already. I don't know if I'll get a picture, but here goes:\n\nMy character is Alex, male.\n\nInferno - Charizard - Gentle nature. This guy's my bro, and is the staple and backbone of my team. He's had one close call against Brock, but otherwise dominated when I really needed him. However, he's seen a lot, and behind that gentle nature is a tear in his eye for all who were lost along the way, and a fiery drive make it to the top and make them all proud, wherever they may be.\n\nStorm - Pidgeot - Sassy nature. She was the very first Pokemon I caught in the wild, and was part of the Pidgey duo with Gino (who sadly was lost to a powerful Dugtrio during a training run in Diglet's Cave). I don't use her as much in battles anymore, and as a result, is my most under-levelled, but only because I fear she may not make it to the Elite 4 battle she rightly deserves to be in (she has had far too many close calls).\n\nNelly - Vileplume - Bashful nature. She's been one of my very best since her capture, and was always very reliable with her Bullet Seed and Cut. She was a major driving force behind the battle against Lt. Surge (since my Diglet, Abbey, couldn't get it done against that godforsaken Raichu and its Double-Team; may she rest in peace) and Misty, and has continued to be one of my top team members.  \n\nMick - Electrode - Careful nature. This guy is my newest member since the passing of my Abbey (who had just evolved into a Dugtrio), and as such, I don't have as much of a bond with him as I do with the others. He just reminds me of the Power Plant, where I lost my Dugtrio to, coincidentally, an Electrode. He has a lot to prove, but I can see him being potentially a major weapon against Lorelei and her ice-types.\n\nPhantom - Haunter - Hardy nature. This guy is one of my favourites. I don't know what the rules are concerning Pokemon caught at Pokemon Tower or any other building rather than a route (I started Nuzlocking a while ago, and it is just recently when I read the formal rules, so I hope this is allowed). He has been a true fighter throughout the entire journey, from the moment I caught him as a Gastly (he put up one hell of a fight for one so low in level) to the big boy he is now. As a result of being able to take Self Destructs and Explosions without any effect, he has become my second-most powerful Pokemon on my team, behind Inferno. He also insures that what killed Abbey will never claim another one of my team mates again. For this, I love him deeply.\n\nNessie - Seadra - Calm nature. Nessie's my surfer, and easily one of my most reliable. He's had his share of close calls, but makes up for them with dominating performances against Blaine and other strong opponents. He has recently learned Blizzard, which I plan to unleash against Lance and his damned dragons. When I got him, he was severely under-levelled compared to the others on my team, and so I put him through a rigorous training session which saw him gain 20 levels, evolve, and ultimately catch up with the rest. I must say, he is one of my proudest achievements.  \n\nAlso, can you perhaps have some honourable mentions in the picture as well, even though they are no longer with us? They deserve it.\n\nChip - Mankey - Major driving force behind defeat of Brock (saved Inferno's ass that time), had excellent potential, lost to a Pidgey in a fluke match.\n\nAbbey - Diglet - See above.\n\nGino - Pidgeotto - See Storm.\n\nThat's all. Man. Writing all that out really made me feel for my Pokemon.

I believe I have seen angels and demons\n\nThis is a tough one for me, because honestly, I don't think you are seeing anything, and the question is whether or not to tell you, and how blunt to be about it.  You've asked for help and I want to help you, and I'm torn between whether an expression of my opinion would be of any help, or whether I should be silent unless I'm going to reinforce your interpretation of these events.  If everyone does that, you'll get no concrete responses that don't reinforce something that I think is definitely not something that should be reinforced.\n\nI'm a metaphysical naturalist so I don't \"believe\" in any of this stuff, but in order to inhabit this sub I have to put that aside and allow that other people here might believe in at least one major supernatural being, i.e. God, and not harp upon this at every opportunity.\n\nI don't know to what degree stipulating a rather potent supernatural critter opens the whole ghosts and demons and pixies and leprechauns and angels and Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster can of worms, but I think that there has to be some sort of continuum between religion and delusion here, and I think this is far along that continuum and is into delusion.\n\nI think I can argue that they are not real because:\n\n1. If they are malevolent, they could be doing a better job of hurting you, rather than pointlessly screwing with your mind.\n\n2. If they are not malevolent, they are behaving as if they are, and this is a contradiction.\n\nI'm not a psychologist, but I can imagine that imagining these things might just be a harmless habit, but if you think it's somehow not harmless, you may want to see a doctor, because these manifestations are not real.\n", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1347617990", "subreddit": "Christianity", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0}

The vast majority of atheists are \"negative atheists\" or \"weak atheists\" or \"agnostic atheists.\"  we think it's just as silly to claim a positive belief in no afterlife as it is for you to claim a bunch of other things with no evidence.  We're the \"I don't know\" variety, and it's the most logical and fact-based position out there, because it's true, as you admitted in your post.\n\nThat being said, there are so many things in life where an acknowledgement of a lack of evidence justifies an assertion that to the best of our knowledge, nothing exists.

In fact, religious claims are literally the only area where I'd guess you claim this makes sense.  You probably violate your own standard in every other area constantly.  How do you determine someone is crazy?  If they see something you can't see, why isn't their claim  reasonable, since you believe lack of evidence justifies any belief?\n\nAlso, lack of evidence doesn't make literally any response reasonable.  There is no evidence of an invisible dragon living in my garage.  Would it be reasonable for me to go around claiming there is, since neither of us can point to evidence backing up our claim?  No, the more reasonable of the two positions is that there is nothing there, because we both at least agree on that.

I mean, if we're going to start believing things because they could be true, why stop there? Why not believe that the Kennedy family murdered Marilyn Monroe? It could be true. Why not believe that the moon landing was falsified? After all, only a limited number of people were actually \"there\" and \"there\" could have been a television studio? It is possible. Is there any indisputable proof that Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster don't exist? True, no one has ever seen them, but they could very well exist. I am not mocking you, I am just pointing out that there are many things one might conclude as \"possible\" and we routinely dismiss them because all evidence points to them being patently untrue.\n\nI believe there comes a time when any rational person must draw a line between what is reasonable to believe and what isn't. In my opinion, there is zero compelling proof or evidence of a deity, so, for now, I reject the possibility that one exists. There is no evidence that it is true and plenty of evidence that there isn't one. If someone presented me with genuinely credible evidence that a deity existed, I would consider it.

I'm not sure how believe that X is logically coherent entails believing that X exists, which is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nOh, it can entail that very easily. Consider the following sentence:\n\n\"The logically necessary cow is logically possible\"\n\nThis entails in S5 the proposition that the logically necessary cow exists. In fact, there are infinitely many propositions of the form \"x is logically possible\" which entail that x exists. For any such x, an argument with the premise \"x is logically possible\" shall be question begging in virtue of the fact that a reasonable doubter of the conclusion would be disposed to doubt the premise. \n\n&gt;I agree, but it seems to be a good starting argument that the universe is not all there is, don't you think? And as seen as part of a cumulative case.\n\nNot really. There are infinitely many possible non-physical entities, so this isn't really a good argument for theism. What it *is* a good argument for is metaphysical non-naturalism. \n\nTo make an analogy, an argument for metaphysical realism is not a good argument for the existence of the loch ness monster (since all metaphysical realism entails is that some objects are real). It *is* a good argument, on the other hand, for semantic realism (because semantic realism is a much broader hypothesis than the hypothesis that the loch ness monster exists).

{"body": "I had a girl pour a drink over my head because I was 'being rude'. I hadn't said one word to her the whole night. I told her, while I had booze dripping off my face onto my new shirt that I wasn't sure why she did that but I really think she needs to get her shit in order or she is going to have little love in life. So I went to get my head all cleaned up and do what I could with my shirt, I ended up just taking it off and rocking the undershirt, you know flashing the tats and all, bringing the ladies in....\n\nA few hours later and a few drinks later I noticed out of the corner of my eye this green dress coming up to me. I may not have noticed she was wearing a fairly bright green dress. I quickly took up a defensive stand and looked her right in the eye. Now don't get me wrong, I would NEVER hit a woman, never, it just isn't who I am. But if she was going for another drink throw I was definitely ready to redirect that shit right back onto that green dress and then go get some pizza and have a great sleep. \nBut this time she came up to me with two beers, handed me one and said, 'I am really really sorry about earlier but I was trying to flash you hints all night but you weren't picking up on them and I really wanted you to come over and talk to me.' \nShe then started into a diatribe about how she knew me from my past job and she had always thought I was cute and funny etc etc. Basically just pumping my tire up. So I told her next time just to come talk to me, really didn't need the shirt ruined or the sticky girl drink plastered to my face. She says, and I quote, 'I wouldn't worry about it too much if I were you because that shirt is going to be crumpled up in a ball in the corner of my room anyways tonight.' \nI laughed, played it off as a joke and then squealed a little as she went for the business. Minutes later we are on the way to her house, and because this isn't literotica.com I will save you the gory details. \nAnyways, moral of the story, I wake up in the morning and she asks if I want to go out for breakfast. Sure why not, so she throws some clothes on I just abandon the shirt to its own devices in the corner and we go downstairs for some breakfast. We finish up and I am thinking maybe its time to go back upstairs and double down on this great night when she asks, and I am dead serious, 'I need about tree fiddy'\nAND that's when I noticed this girl was actually 10 stories tall, covered in gray scales and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era and was the fabled Loch Ness Monster. \n\nOne of the best breakfasts I have ever had. \n\nTL;DR I got a drink poured on my head by a girl, took her home and had an awesome breakfast the next day.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348121547", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Let me tell you about the time I was failing Math class.\n\nIt was the summer of 2005, I think. I was a scholarship student to Harvard. My mom was an alcoholic and my dad was never really around. He was occasionally abusive due to what I think was a drug addiction. I'd always not quite fitted in at school. My lack of social skills led me to seek recluse in academia. By night I'd just read. This one time when I was about 13, the police arrested Dad, and I had to spend the night with my uncle. He was a brilliant polymath- no idea about practical things, but he had a passion for learning. That night, I was tearful and alone, and he tried to take my mind off things by introducing me to some more advanced mathematics. I finally found a passion for something. Even when dad was released, I ended up spending more and more time with my uncle. Eventually, when I was 16, he gained custody after I became sick of my dad's alcohol abuse. Fuelled by my love of maths, I graduated most classes with full credit, and my uncle encouraged me to apply to Harvard.\n\nThe problem was not just getting in. The problem was the atmosphere. I was a small town girl with severe social anxiety issues. I was under immense pressure to perform and I felt I couldn't compete with some of the intellectual heavyweights present. During this time I was also increasingly aware of my lowly sexual status. I was worried that I would die alone without experiencing sex- my attempts to secure a one night stand were mostly unsuccessful. \n\nAnyway, my grades were really failing thanks to my social worries. It was about this time that my few girl friends started complaining about how lecherous our teacher had been to them, pressuring them for sexual favours in return for better grades. Suddenly, a plan came to mind.\n\nThe next paper I had back, my professor asked to see me after class. He sat down in front of me. His cologne was overpowering... almost sexy. \"This really isn't acceptable, Katherine\" he shook his head, \"I don't see how long you can go like this. You'll end up failing\". \n\nI leaned into him, unbuttoning my shirt. \"Really Professor? Is there anything I can do... to help?\"\n\nThis caught his attention. He approached me, his lips practically next to mine. \"Well, you'll have to give me everything...I...need.\"\n\n\nI asked him, breathlessly, \"What do you need?\". He looked into my eyes and replied \"I need about tree fiddy\".\n\nIt was at this point that I realised my professor was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\n\"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you goddamn Loch Ness Monster!\" I yelled as he shuffled off into the sunset, \"Get your own goddamn money!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348141278", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1915, "controversiality": 0}

It is far more likely that this was just a tall tale that fits in with the contemporary 'great feats' natative like Columba battling the loch ness monster, Brigids magic abortion hands, and even their predecessors Fionn MacCumhall's great feats. it is propaganda in the sense that the Saints need these to show how much better they are than the old gods and heros.\n\nYou also get small insights into Brehon law and the culture of the time. It is one of the few references to homosexuality in ancient irish writings.

I told her I was a major fan (which I wasn't) and started a decent conversation. The conservation only got good when we started talking about things we disliked.\nWe both really didn't like baptists because of their strict parents as we were both raised in that enviorment. She also extremely hated people pronouncing her name incorrectly.\nThe conversation went on for a few more minutes. Until the check came out. She told me she'd spot me just for being nice.\nThat's when the waiter said, \"Okay, Ms. Peen-ry that'll be 11.89\". Then she went completely fuck tard balls breaking table and eating random peoples food and shit.

{"body": "From the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/faq#Doatheistsbelieveinghostsorothersupernaturalthings):\n\nDo atheists believe in ghosts (or other supernatural things)?\n\nSome atheists do. Many do not. Atheism only describes a person's lack of belief in deities. Everything else is negotiable. Being an atheist does not necessarily make one a materialist, or a rationalist, or a humanist, or an empiricist, or a positivist, or a skeptic- it's just that being those things tends to make one an atheist.\n\nYou can still be an atheist and believe completely uncritically in ghosts, reincarnation, souls, heaven, hell, zombies, wizards, unicorns, leprechauns, bigfoot, spells, curses, auras, divination, astrology, homeopathy, crystal healing, psychics, ouija boards, alien abductions, UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster, The Lost City of Atlantis, and honest used car salesmen.\n\nMost of those you'll find here are skeptics, however, so they would apply the same skepticism they use with the god question to the paranormal as well. Given the complete lack of any evidence of ghosts, unicorns, or $SUPERNATURAL_THING, don't expect them to believe in it.\n\nIf you have any evidence that they exist, you're welcome to submit it for peer review and collect your Nobel Prize, or at least contact James Randi so he can give you $1,000,000", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348276863", "subreddit": "atheism", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "&gt; Just a couple of questions that have been on my mind. I guess this is more of an \"Ask an Atheist\" post rather than trying to start a debate, but maybe you'll indulge me.\n\nNo problem, questions are cool.\n\n&gt; How do you explain the paranormal? Specifically ghosts, demons, and other spirit entities. I personally have seen what I can only explain was a ghost. Furthermore, can all accounts of seeing ghosts, demonic possession, etc. really just be written off as people looking for attention or something made up?\n\nThe same way I explain encounters with aliens, the loch ness monster, Big Foot, the Abominable Snowman, the Grey Man of Ben MacDhui, the Brown Mountain lights, raining frogs, the Naga Fireballs, the Angel of Mons....I could keep going, but you get the idea. Although exact explanations vary from phenomenon to phenomenon, they almost all follow the same basic idea; people experience something that seems to defy conventional explanation, so instead of saying \"I don't know how *X* happened!\" they instead say \"*X* must be *Y*!\", where *X* is mysterious lights and sounds, or a sudden feeling of not being alone, etc., and *Y* is aliens, ghosts, a monster hidden in the mists, etc.\n\nIt is impossible to say all accounts of even one supposed phenomenon, such as ghosts, are people making something up or seeking attention. In reality, there are probably numerous different causes for people coming to the conclusion that they experienced a ghost sighting. Some people are almost certainly making it up, and can be motivated by different factors. Other people probably genuinely believe they saw a ghost, but this does not mean a ghost was really there. People are fooled all the time, especially in situations where it is dark and scary and unknown. It is impossible to learn about human physiology and psychology without gaining an appreciation for just how easily people will come to the wrong conclusion about something novel. I'm sorry I can't give you a more specific answer to this query, but these things really need to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, and cannot be well-addressed as one.\n\n&gt; Why are we the only creatures that have belief in a deity? Why are we the only creatures even capable of a belief in a deity? We seem to be the only creatures who are \"self-aware.\"\n\nWell it is factually incorrect that we are the only creatures who are self-aware. [The mirror test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test) is a useful albeit imperfect method of determining this, and thus far animals to pass it include; All great apes (including chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas, and of course *Homo sapiens*), dolphins, orca whales, elephants, magpies, and I believe pigs (although they are missing from the Wikipedia list, so perhaps I am mistaken.\n\nIt is of course true that humans are thus far the only species to reach our own level of consciousness and cognitive faculties. This is for a myriad of reasons, which we can go in to if you'd like, and there is no reason to think that, if left unfettered, other species might not eventually join us.\n\nAs for being the only creature with a deity, well this seems to of course follow from our \"special\" place at the top of the mental kingdom, for we are the only animal that can conceive of such a complex idea. I'm not sure if you are implying that this tells us something about the existence of deities, because I don't see how it does. To do so would also require following the line of reasoning that, because we are the only species that has a belief in leprechauns, that they also really exist, and especially for us at that.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348368470", "subreddit": "DebateAnAtheist", "score": 46, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Er... To claim \"almost every religion\" \"subjugates... women\" is really off the mark. The Judeo-Christian ones do, certainly, but it's absurd to claim they represent ALL religions. I don't know too much about it, but obviously Hinduism is a very large religion that is quite sex-positive. Shamanistic traditions, like those in central Asia and Siberia, tend to be pretty egalitarian. The old pagan religions of Europe that existed prior to the spread of Christianity were as well. The ancient Shinto religion seems, if anything, to have afforded more power to women than men: there are some interesting reports about it from contemporary Chinese sources, who were freaked out by the female priests and the power and respect they commanded. Hell, there have even been some weird offshoots of Christianity that were very egalitarian, like the medieval Gnostic movement or the 14th-century \"Heresy of the Free Spirit,\" as recorded by Marguerite Porete in \"The Mirror of Simple Souls.\" \n\nAs others have pointed out, early Islam had very little interaction with Christianity. I'm not sure what distinction you're drawing between \"polytheism\" and \"paganism,\" since \"paganism\" really doesn't mean anything more than \"non-monotheist religion.\" I also don't know how you came up with the claim that shamanism proceeded polytheism in the Middle East (or at least that the one influenced the other in any meaningful way,) or even that shamanism is responsible for the oppression of women. Shamanism really doesn't operate the same way organized religions do. What's more, if shamanism was practiced in the Middle East (which I have no clue about,) it would have been a long, long time ago - as in, the Paleolithic era, seeing as the Neolithic site at Çatalhöyük is pretty clearly conventionally polytheist.\n\nSo: you make a good point about modern religion and oppression, but your history's bad and your knowledge of religions is bad.\n\nEdit: Downvotes?

The worst perpetrator, let's call her Sally for the time being, kept saying as to how I am always seen outside her window every night, with a pair of binoculars and a trench coat. \n\nNow, I didn't have a trench coat, neither binoculars. Not even today. But then, something I did made everyone think twice...\n\nA week before Junior Prom, I saved up enough money to buy a suit, with an added waistcoat and gloves (Costed $70-$80, it was a pretty cheap, but good-looking suit), it was the best suit I ever had, because my parents usually bought me polo shirts, and cargo shorts. I went to my mom's jewellry box, pulled out an empty ring box, placed a fake, $10 ring from a Claw Machine Game that I won some months before, as well as my wire-frame glasses from my room, and went on my merry way to school. \n\nI wore that same suit, which caused some bad looks from the Jocks, some good calls from their girlfriends, and probably made all the girls wet in the Etiquette Club. I look horribly plain in just regular clothes, but when I had all of these, I looked like I was an ambassador to Japan, with my hair slicked back, combed into wheatrows, and my glasses, which fit my face perfectly. \n\nI approached Sally, and bowed like a butler. \"Ah, Miss Jones. I would like to have a word with you.\" Sally crudely replied with a, \"Sure, ya creep. It's not like you're gonna grope me in broad daylight.\" \n\n\"I understand you need attention from me, and I know what you want from me. It's not like that I'd be this oblivious from what you're trying to do.\" \n\n\"And what does THAT mean, dickbag?\"\n\n\"I believe that you have some affection to me.\"\n\n\"WHAT?!\" \n\nThat \"WHAT?!\" resonated through the entire school, causing everyone to converge on our position. Everyone watched, as one of the most popular girls in school was arguing with a nerd in a monkey suit (That's what I've been told). \n\nIt then devolved with me using eloquent speeches on how she loved me and wanted my dick, followed with her denying it and tried to leave the area, but was always blocked by a crapton of spectators. \n\nAfter the arguements ended, I kept following this up for the entire week, and until the day of the prom, I, still wearing ths suit, and my friends and gaming buddies, also wearing suits, all walk down the hallway, with one guy sabotaging the PA system with playing \"Little Green Bag\", and each of us walking slowly and putting on sunglasses. \n\nWe walk to Sally's locker, which made her ballistic.\n\n\"OHMAIGAWD, JUST LET IT GO! I NEVER LIKED YOU!\"\n\nAnd then, I whipped out my fake-ass french skills, complete with accent:\n\n\"Ah, but ma cherie, I see it in your eyes, the opening of the pupils, and the scent, the smell of roses, of amore. Your lips say no, but your eyes say yes.\" \n\nAll of my friends were giggling a bit at this point. And one of my friends whispered an idea into my ear, \"Let's mak her think that her friend over there is cheating on her.\" I nodded.\n\nMy voice ended up a little Italian at that point, \"Are you sure, mia amore, are you sure that you want to back away from me?

It was the last weekend before school started so my cousin and I really wanted to finish the Summer with a bang. I spent the weekend over at his house. He lives in a very rural part of California. It's a very empty, \"hidden\" ranch which is surrounded by an orchard, more like a sea, of orange trees. Most nights it gets very foggy and the fog seems brings this certain eerie feeling along with it.\nThis occurrence happened on my first night there. Deep into the woods is this very dark, cloudy lake. We decided to go fishing there, which to we have only been to like 2 or 3 times before. This time it was different. We searched for and gathered all the necessary tools. We still had about 1 and a half, maybe 2, hours left of sunlight, but we decided to take a flashlight, just to be on the safe side. The way there was no problem. It took about 45 minutes to get there, longer than we expected. We weren't there for very long before it happened. We were fishing for about 5 minutes before it started getting really foggy. It was also starting to get dark. I told my cousin that I was getting a bad feeling and we should really start heading back. He said he also had a bad feeling then suddenly he stopped talking dropped everything staring over my shoulder. I turn around a see this shadowy outline of a tall, very slim man staring at us with red, fiery gleaming eyes. I dropped my shit and we got the fuck outta there. We just kept running, trying to escape this thing that we forgot about everything. Before we knew it, we had no idea where we fucking were. It was really foggy by this point and it was getting really dark. We left our flashlight AND our only cell phone at the lake. That's when this feeling takes over. You feel so helpless and terrified. I felt like I was going into shock. I looked over to my cousin and he just stares at me. He stares into my eyes for about 20 seconds before he comes close to my ear and whispers, \"Can I get abouta tree fiddy?\" That's when I noticed my cousin was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era!

To be honest I was going to ask the same and happily said yes.\n\nDay before I was going to leave town, I went to meet her at this park she asked me to come to. The park had very few people (probably because it was evening and it was getting dark). Finally she arrived and I instantly knew that it was her as we exchanged smiles. She was more beautiful than her voice. I was acting like a socially awkward penguin while she talked about vague stuff and I never noticed that she had slowly moved to sit very very close to me. As I turned my face to her, she smiled, leaned closer and whispered in my ear, \"Can you spare about...tree fiddy?\"\n\nWell it was around that time that I noticed that the Justdial girl was about 500 feet tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. I told her \"goddamn loch ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" as she faded away in the greenery of the park and out of sight :/", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348483478", "subreddit": "india", "score": 51, "controversiality": 0}

Its like a case study in magical thinking and pseudoscience.  Take everything you ever learned about critical thinking and turn it upside down and backwards.  Now you have the 911 Truth movement, and the conspiracy theory movement in general.\n\nI have to be honest, when I first came into contact with the skeptic community and in particular the JREF forum I was shocked by the smugness with which they would dismiss any and all supernatural and pseudoscientific claims out of hand without considering them.  However, as time has gone by and I have looked at more and more woo, I feel like I have come to understand this attitude and honestly I have taken it on myself.  \n\nPeople who spread woo and the woo itself tend to have the same characteristics over and over that just start jumping out at you.  You can look open mindedly into another bigfoot claim or UFO sighting but what's the point?  They're all the same and until you have a UFO or bigfoot in a lab being measured by calibrated instruments it's all bullshit.\n\nSo the 911 Truth movement is simply the UFO people or the bigfoot or Loch Ness monster people who desperately WANT TO BELIEVE in something amazing.  Add to this the fact that the world in fact is totally fucked up.  I mean, they're right about some things:  money and power do appear to be being concentrated into the hands of an elite group who don't give a fuck about the rest of us, e.g. Mitt Romney.  Government does misuse and abuse power.  We apparently were told lies to get us into a war with Iraq.  The thing is, there is plenty of good journalism out there covering these subjects if you really want to try and learn about them or get a grasp on them.  However, the whole mess tends to be a bit complicated, and unfortunately not as sexy as \"George Bush and the Bilderbergers did it\" - which would actually be pretty sweet if it was true, but the reality is that there simply isn't any evidence to back up this theory.\n\nA good example of where the 911 Truth movement has clearly got itself totally fucked up is Noam Chomsky.  Noam Chomsky has been an eloquent and passionate critic of US imperialism and an advocate for social justice for years.  He should be a hero to a movement that claims to believe in these things.  And yet Noam Chomsky is totally written off by the 911 Truth movement as some kind of CIA operative or something because he doesn't buy their conspiracy.  I think that this really shows the depths or their ignorance and intellectual bankruptcy.\n\nSo, no I don't sympathize or agree with them.  I guess I see where they're coming from, but I don't condone it.  I think ignorance and the spreading of lies and disinformation is harmful and I wish I could think of some kind of super-argument that would snap them all out of their stupor with its brilliance, but realistically that's probably not going to happen.  :(", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348558261", "subreddit": "skeptic", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0}

I was at this fairly rough inner city school, which had a lot of problems (you know, poor funding, over crowding in classes (had 35+ students in some classes!) and poor teaching quality (the kind of teachers that were just there from 8-3 and would leave before the students if they could).\n\nAnyway, I was teaching an 8th grade student called Jamal. He was one of the quietest students I've ever met. Always kept to himself, could always be seen sitting alone under the playground at recess etc. He just wouldn't do anything with the other students. I couldn't figure out for the life of me whether it was because he was shy, or hated school. He would barely say words to me, I think he said two whole words to me in the first semester. When it came to his school work, he would never follow the instructional guidelines. He would just draw crude images of sea creatures. I swear this kid had a disability (not trying to be rude, I have just never seen anybody draw that horribly. He made picasso seem like the world's greatest realist...)\n\nOne day, I was leaving school after staying around to mark some class assignments, I think it was around 5:30pm, and I walked out onto the street. I see this kid, just standing there, looking blankly at the road, absolutely expressionless. I figured there had to be something wrong, he was never here after school (doesn't do after school activities) and his mother always picked him up straight after school. But here he was, just standing here. I walked over to him, touched him on the shoulder and just asked, what's up? He looked at me, blankly and coldly. I asked him if he was catching the bus home, he nodded silently. I asked him if he had bus money, and he shook his head, looking down at the ground (he didn't seem to want to make eye contact). I figured the least I could do for this kid was giving him some bus money, since he NEEDED to get home, and we lived in totally different directions. I asked him how much he needed, and he looked up, and smiled for the first time in a long time. Like somebody actually cared for him. He pursed his lips for a moment, considering the situation, and finally let out some words that were barely audible. \"Tree Fiddy\".

He calls me in tears, saying he fucked up and he's been banging my girlfriend for 3 months, and he's fed up with lying. Granted, he shows me nude pics of her, timestamped and all that. I am absolutely furious.\n\nSkipping the whole facebook-gym-lawyer thing, I get home and start getting my shit together in order to be able to kick her out without any problem. I really didn't want this sex addicted bitch in my life any longer. In the middle of making a small inventory of the shit she brought into the house, I get a text from her.\n\n\"I'm pregnant\"\n\nI barely remember what I did next, because I was practically blacking out from rage. I could excuse - not forgive, though - the cheating, but scheming against me like this was too low for me to accept. I knew immediately what she was planning so I looked through the trash and found a bundled up condom, along with its wrapper. I fished it out and put it away carefully, then waited for the cunt to get home.\n\nOf course she's crying like a bitch. I keep calm. I can see through her lies. \"I think it happened when we bare dogged it last night\", she says. \"I want to keep the baby.\" She's smiling, saying I'd make a great dad.\n\nA few minutes into her play, I drop the bomb. \"I know about [friend name, censored for privacy]. I want to break up. I don't care if you're really pregnant or not, I want you out.\"\n\nAt this point I can see in her eyes she's sad she's been caught rather than anything else. She bursts into a fit of rage and accuses ME of cheating on her, of being sex-obsessed (!). When I thought it would simply be a matter of physically kicking her out, she says she can prove it's mine (somehow) and if I don't support her financially she'll press charges for rape. She's throwing all these legal terms at me, saying she'll press charges for everything (whatever that meant) and that she'll ruin my life.\n\nI snap. I push her against a wall and start screaming at her. \"Bitch, I found the condom. I know what you did. I don't give a shit about you anymore, but you've known me enough to realize you can't fuck with me like this. I don't care if you have a baby or not and I don't care whose it is, but it's not mine, and if you dare to get me in legal trouble using this 'baby' of yours I will personally rip it out of you.\"\n\nI was shocked at what I'd said but I kept my cool. She was bawling her eyes out, and manages to choke out a \"sorry\".\n\n\"I'm sorry. I won't press any charges. I'll just leave. But I need ONE thing.\"\n\n\"What the hell is it?\"\n\n\"I need...I need bout tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was at this point that I realized my girlfriend was a three story high crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"Goddamn you, Loch Ness monster, I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!\" I yelled as she swam out into the sunset.

{"body": "I would start by messing with them slowly. Every day I would send them a text message from a different randomized number commenting on their clothes, what they did that day, who they were with. Have the messages start off kind and complementary, but, over several weeks, make the messages creepier and meaner to the point of full on harassment.\n\nAs this is going on, I would slowly start sabotaging their life. I would call into their work anonymously and lodge complaints about them for situations that never happened. I would find someone that sounded like them and have them call into work or call other people and leave them awful messages that ranged from being purely odd to being mean. I would time these calls for when they were sleeping or blacked out drunk, to mess with them even more. I would sign them up for awkward mail, like porn or parenting magazines and get them delivered to not only their home but also their work (if they still had a job at this point).\n\nI would then start making them question themselves and their memory. There is almost nothing worse than having doubts about your own memory. I would use the voice double from earlier to call and agree to situations they knew nothing about, or call to cancel big huge life things (weddings, etc) not long before they happen. I would start moving things around their house at this point, like moving furniture a few inches in one direction before moving them back, or even farther away. I would move their car from where ever it was parked to farther down the street, or several spots away if they were in a parking lot. I would move keys from one jacket pocket to another pocket, switch shoes that they leave near the door (so boots to sneakers, etc). I would start changing the packing of what they have in their pantry to other brands that they never use (like Coke to Pepsi) or just remove the labels completely. \n\nIf they wrote in a journal or diary I would start forging entries to stuff that obviously never happened... though it wouldn't be obvious to them. Or I would change details, like who they hung out with or what they did. The harassing texts from before would mimic these false memories. I would again play on times they don't normally remember (like drinking too much) or times they would be asleep (drug pills will help me out if necessary).\n\nI would then start having a body double dress like this person and start having them be in the same place, though not too close. I would time it as best as possible for the body double to start off slowly, like being seen for a few moments out of the corner of an eye, but have it build up so they were everywhere, though always a background person. The text messages from before would change slightly here, moving from harassment towards dark thoughts like \"You were never real to begin with\" or \"No one ever liked you to begin with\".\n\nAs there would probably be a fight between body double and the actual person... well, this would be planned. Body double would then start accusing the original person was following them... basically everything that was going on, but reversed. The original person was sending body double the harassing texts, calling and leaving messages... the whole shebang.\n\nIf they weren't arrested or detained at this point for going off the edge, I would start the heinous crimes now. I would start leaving bits of blood in their house, some random but some purposeful, like leading them somewhere. Where ever the blood led would be sacrifices to the lord Loch Ness, and in the middle of the bloody and gory scene would be a call for tree fiddy.

{"body": "Well, I was on a spiritual finding journey, this takes place in northern Michigan\n\nSO, there I was, alone in my hand made shelter that consisted of pine boughs and long grass, It had been three days away from civilization, and the only things I had were my knife, a hatchet, my shoes and the clothes on my back. I was growing hungry, having only fed on nuts and berries I crafted a spear out of a long branch, my knife and a shoelace. I wandered around for hours, and as soon as I started giving up hope, a doe walked right across my path, I cocked back my arm and was about to throw, but as I looked at the doe and contemplated its beauty, I lost heart and could not kill it. I lowered my rough spear and took off the knife. As I walked back to my camp I thought on what had just happened, and was thankful to myself for not killing the doe. When i got back to my shelter I started hearing sounds, like a big animal moving around, just out of my sight. And at that time it was growing dark so I was only able to see about 20 feet away. Then the sounds got louder, and louder and all of the sudden, out of the trees around me, a glowing elk came bounding. It came straight up to me and lowered its head as if acknowledging me. Then, to my surprise it spoke to me and said \"I am the protector of this forest and I see all that goes on in it\" the only thing I could think of was the latrine I had dug twenty feet away \n\"I saw you spare the Doe's life and I want to thank you, but first I must ask one small favor\"\n\nI stammered out something along the lines of \"wha...?\"\n\nAnd it looked into me, its eyes boring into my soul, and in a booming voice laid out his request \"Ya got tree fiddy?\"\n\nAnd that was about the time I noticed this shimmering being was about 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era, and I said \"God dammit Loch Ness Monster, I a'int gonna give you no damn tree fiddy!\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348694214", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "This is a bit of a long story, but I think it'll fit right in here.\n\nSo I applied for a job at this brand new Chik-fil-a that oppened up in town. I lived fifteen minutes away, I was looking for a part-time position, and I heard from a friend who had also applied that the pay was promised to be fairly decent.\n\nNow, I had never gone for a job in my life, much less sat for an interview. I spent the day I applied re-reading all of my finance notes on how to write a resume and all that shit, submitted my stuff in person, and waited. A week later, I got a call inviting me to come down for an interview. I accepted.\n\nNow, I am not a fairly religious person, and this was around when Chik-fil-a came out against homosexuality. I was a little aprehensive as to who I may see working there. But, nevertheless, I went into the place with my nice clothes and more or less just tried to look professional while I waited.\n\nFinnaly, after what felt like an eternity, I got into the managers room. And it's just crosses. Everywhere. Must have been twenty fucking dying Jesus's hung in that room, staring at me with that despondent, \"Love me or go to Hell\" kind of stare. The manager, a woman in her mid-forties, and really fat, greets me and asks me to sit down. I do my best to answer her questions and sell myself to the store and whatnot, but I cannot get over all the crosses.\n\nAt the end of the interview, the manager says \"Now, I want you to know that our store has a strict code of ethics. Can you hold yourself to something like that?\" I'm beginning to fear that she's trying to insinuate that if I'm not religious she won't hire me. And I'm nervous as fuck. So I just say the first thing that comes into my head.\n\n\"Well, with all these eyes staring at me, I don't think I'd be able to get away with it.\" Dumb move. The woman starts getting mad. REALLY mad. She goes off at me for trying to \"insult her beliefs\" and \"make light of her convictions\". I have no idea why she's doing this. I try to calm the situation down by saying, \"Look, I'm not trying to insult you, if there's anything you need me to do at this point-\" She cut me off.\n\n\"Well, normally I'd just be kicking you out right about now,\" she yells, \"but I do need one thing from you before you go.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" I said.\n\n\"...I need about tree fiddy.\"\n\nIt was then I realized my potential manager was actually an 8-story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy, you goddamn loch ness monster!\" I shouted as it ran away.\n\nEDIT- Yeah, I didn't think this one through as well as I could have.

{"body": "Well, it seems this thread is populated by people actually trying to help you get good at the game (heaven forbid) so I thought I'd wade in with a slightly different perspective. First, a disclaimer: What I'm about to write is not in any way good strategy for playing TF2's 4th class. I absolutely 100% agree that the sticky launcher is the most effective choice for a Demoman's secondary especially where competitive play is concerned. \n\n\nHowever.\n\n\nIt is also, in my humble, uncompetitive, pub-playing opinion, the least fun and exciting. In a world filled with Dustbowl-camping, Gibus-wearing piss Snipers just waiting for a caberin', there are too many great ways to play a black, scottish cyclops than, you know, effectively. I want to talk about TF2's often-ineffectual 10th class, the Demoknight.\n\n\nSo, to actually get to answering the question:\n\n\n**Primary**\n\nThere are three choices here, and two broad styles of play defined by your choice here.\n\n\n* **Stock Grenade Launcher** -This is generally considered the standard choice for the more conventional Demoman, and it most certainly has it's place in the Demoknight loadout. This gives you a long-range option and the ability to spam sentries, chokepoints, corners, whatever, just like a normal Demo. It is the superior, more versatile option and practicing with it still helps you be kredit to team, which is always nice.\n\n\n* **Loch 'n' Load** -The second ranged option for a Demoknight. Faster, more damaging projectiles means more dead foes in straight forward combat but the fewer shots in a clip means more time spent reloading (or, if reloading is not an option, more time spent in pure melee). The loss of a pill upon hitting a non-destructible surface means you also lose the ability to spam properly, however it does mean bringing down sentries is faster when a direct hit is possible. Overall if you prefer this to the Stock as a normal Demo, you will prefer it as a Demoknight.\n\n\n* **Ali Baba's Wee Booties/The Bootlegger** -The boots are the third option and are a radical departure from the two items above. Losing all ranged capability, you gain 25 health (bringing you to a round 200, or compensating for the Eyelander's health loss) and the ability to turn mid-charge more effectively. These are for when you want to be a pure Demoknight, unsullied by such petty mortal concerns as being helpful or 'winning'. Very fun, but I will discuss them a little more later as they are effectively an extension of your...\n\n\n**Secondary**\n\nSeeing as we're playing like an anachronistic badass, I will discuss only three choices here. The two serious suggestions and one honourable mention.\n\n\n* **The Chargin' Targe** -The original shield, giving an underrated 50% resistance to fire and 40% to explosive damage. Obviously, you also gain the ability to rush forward every 12 seconds at quite a pace in order to collide with the enemy dealing 50 (+10*number of heads, up to 5 heads) damage. Or none if you hit them too soon. Depending on your charge distance, you will also gain a mini-crit or a full crit on a melee swing during the charge or immediately after bashing an enemy.\n\n\n* **The Splendid Screen** -A variant on the Targe, the Screen provides only 15% explosive and 20% fire reduction, but compensates by dealing a whopping 85+17*heads damage on collision with an enemy and at any distance! The same rules for melee crits that apply to the Targe also apply to the Screen, so this is easily the more aggressive shield of the two.\n\n\n* **The honourable mention** -I couldn't write something like this and not include the amazing, the all-consuming monstrosity that is the Sticky Jumper. No charge whatsoever, but you gain damage-less sticky jumps. When used alongside the Caber, Pan or even Eyelander, this becomes possibly the ultimate troll weapon. OK, back to Demoknighting.\n\n\n**Melee**\n\nClearly, this is the bit that makes a world of difference to the actual business of Demoknighting- which sharp implement is best for decapitations, eviscerations, and general mutilation of your unfortunate foes?\n\n\n* **The Eyelander/Variants** -Including the Horseless Headless Horsemann's Headtaker and Nessie's Nine-Iron, this is the original sword available to the Demoknight. It even chants 'heads, heads, heads', reminding you what you should be doing. It has a slightly longer effective range than standard melee weapons, giving you more options in a close-quarters battle. It comes with a 25 health penalty and no random crits (which is a big deal for melee weapons), however for each of the first four heads you take, you gain 8% extra speed (Demo's base is 93% if I remember right- Pyro, Sniper, Spy and Engie move at 100%) and 15 max health. Your shield bash also gets stronger as you take up to 5 heads. Any heads taken beyond heal (and can overheal) you by 15. It also gives you the decapitation taunt. \n\n\n* **The Claidheamh Mor** -Of all the swords, this is probably the least used, meaning using it might grant some element of surprise. However, no random crits and a 15 health penalty are pretty harsh for it's benefit- 0.5s longer charge duration (up from 2s standard I believe). This gives you more mobility and a greater effective range for those sweet sweet shield bashes/weapon crits, allowing it to work well with the Boot's manouverability buff. However, outside of those times you are at a greater disadvantage than your average Demoknight. \n\n\n* **Scotsman's Skullcutter** -A big, meaty axe which deals a fantastic 20% bonus damage (78, up from 65), giving crits of 234 damage a pop. Those crits can happen randomly, too. The downside is moving 15% slower, giving you a speed of 78%- slower than even Soldier. This speed loss applies to your charges too, causing you to have to think a good deal more about who and when to charge (and also making you easier to dodge). \n\n\n* **Half Zatoichi** -An interesting choice, which some love and some despise. The benefit is undeniable- returning you to full health on a kill is spectacularly good, well above the healing you can expect from the Eyelander or Persuader. However, once drawn you cannot put it away until you make a kill, so be prepared to play pure melee for a while and hope none of your teammates steal your kills. Of course, If you're running with the Boots, there's no downside to this weapon at all.\n\n\n* **The Persian Persuader** -The final piece of the 'One thousand and one Demoknights' set, the defining feature is rendering you unable to gain ammo, even from dispensers. Instead ammo packs, weapons and the like, return only health. The effect of this is that when running either grenade launcher option, you have a finite number of shots until you have to run back to a supply closet. This blade also suffers from no random crits, though it has one VERY fun positive: when equipped your shield bash recharge time is only 6s, as opposed to 12. This means a Demoknight is at his most dangerous twice as often, even to the point of pulling off multiple charges in one fight. \n\n\n* **Stock Bottle/Pan/Pain Train** -These are all options, especially if you don't like the often-specific playstyles the swords tend to force you into. However, you lose the extended range, making post-charge crits that much more difficult to land. If you're looking at using these as a Demoknight, I'd recommend running with the Skullcutter. Unless you're using the Pan with the Sticky Jumper- then you are doing Gaben's work my son and you should be proud.\n\n* **The Caber** -Unbelievably fun. If you find yourself giggling like a madman following your 20th suicide Medic kill, you're doing it right. Especially good with the Sticky Jumper, although dont use it against heavies or Demoknights- they'll survive and you'll look a right tit.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348768941", "subreddit": "NewToTF2", "score": 20, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "I'd just gotten home from work around 10 PM and sat down to play some Call of Duty when I get a text from my roommate telling me to come out to the bars. I tell him, \"Fuck no,\" and get my game on for a while.\n\nAround 1 AM, I get a text, \"I'm bringing two girls back.\" I put on my game face and have a couple warm-up shots - I'm not the kind of man who leaves a buddy in need without a wingman. He gets there with these two girls and right away my stomach sinks.\n\nThey're sisters, but you wouldn't know it. The one he's chatting up is gorgeous, and the one I'm supposed to occupy looks like, well, let's just say she was the Danny DeVito of the *Twins*.\n\nSo what do I do? I do the only thing I can do. I drink until I'm oblivious and barely able to form sentences. I drink until my dick doesn't care where it ends up.\n\nThe night goes on and finally I find a good reason to pull this helicopter-sister away from the two of them long enough for my buddy to get into his room with her and lock the door.\n\nAs we're sitting in my room - me pretending to be interested, her talking like it's a fucking presentation about her life - I decide it's time to get on with it because if I have to listen to her for another minute I'll hurl myself off the balcony.\n\nI make my move and, instantly, I'm shut down. She has a boyfriend. It's now 3 AM and I've now spent the last 2 hours talking to this thing from which I'm not even going to get a regret-filled blowjob out of it? Fine. Fuck it. I'll live.\n\nNow that the sun's about to rise, she decides it's time to get home and goes to collect her sister. After we awkwardly run into my roommate walking back to his room in a pair of boxers, they get packed up and are about to head home.\n\nAs we see them out, the girl who's now wasted two and a half hours of my life gives me a hug and thanks me for being so nice, then sheepishly asks if they could have a little bit of money for cab fair. Normally, I'd have had no problem with it, but it was about this time that I noticed she was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.

{"body": "There exists a strong cultural bias against this phenomenon - against reporting it, against wondering about it, against an honest scientific inquiry into it, and against any people who wish to retain an open mind about the possibility of an alien civilization interfacing with humans on any level less than an invasion, or some grand socio-political ARRIVAL where ships land on the White House lawn, Johhny Grey jumps out and says, 'Sup, fools?  Zeti Reticuli all up in this bitch.'\n\nThe reasons for this cultural bias - an overt and well-documented, military-funded intimidation and ridicule campaign, designed to subvert public opinion on the credibility of witnesses in both civilian and military circles.\n\nNow, because this disinformation campaign is so well-documented, it strikes me as disingenuous of  laypersons to dismiss the very idea of it - especially since the physics of inter-stellar travel is fairly well defined in physics and certainly NOT impossible for a theoretical culture of sufficiently advanced energy technology.\n\nWhy the campaign to sweep it all under the rug?  Why the intimidation of military personnel?  Why Project Blue Book, an admitted sham that even in its fervor to explain away these incidents by any means available was still left with cases it couldn't explain?  It certainly bothers me because it suggests there is pertinent information outside the data pool.\n\nPeople mention the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot as if they had a commensurate amount of evidence - this is absurd.\n\nThere simply don't exist even 100 images of purported Sasquatch photos or even sightings.  I've never heard of military personnel seeing them, or civilian bush pilots.  I've never heard of them being tracked by two separate sets of radar equipment at the same time as a visual observation.  I've also never heard of Sasquatch being sighted by hundreds of people simultaneously.  I've never read declassified documents reporting on a foreign military's soldiers (pilots) engaging Bigfoot in combat and having their attack vehicle rendered inoperable due to Bigfoot interference.  Or the head of a military branch admitting that his soldiers saw Bigfoot, chased him (again in aircraft), and Bigfoot eluded capture.\n\nThe UFO phenomenon has all these aspects to define it.\n\nThe problem is simple: repeatability.  How does one design an experiment to test hypothesis on rare, non-periodic phenomena?  It seems we are stuck with observational evidence, and analysis of photos and videos to prove they haven't been doctored (hardly definitive or very tangible) and analysis of radar recordings.  There are rumors that hard evidence has been collected, yet the information is sequestered by the military.  This certainly fits the pattern established by our government's official responses versus what FOIA documents and military witness testimony seem to reveal.\n\nBut we are stuck in a conundrum.  There certainly exists enough evidence to warrant a true, ongoing, and open scientific investigation into this phenomenon.  Much evidence that would do quite well in a court of law.\n\nHOWEVER, in the public sphere certainly, there is virtually zero evidence of the type of peer-reviewed studies with stable hypotheses and the gradual building of a clear picture through the scientific method that we've all come to know and love.  In fact, much of this 'new information' doesn't fit well into our common notion of what the scientific method has proven to us so far.   Furthermore, following the general ET idea presented, it asks us to confirm the existence of cultures on other planets or worlds with the technological knowledge to bend the fabric of space/time at will in order to travel galactic distances.  Not impossible by any scientific laws, AS WELL AS becoming more plausible in our minds due to developing ideas in cosmology.  But to say that this is definitively the case requires proof, and not just a single piece of evidence, but a preponderance of evidence that simply does not exist in the public canon.\n\n\nBut as far as the idea of it being impossible or even far-fetched?  No scientist I know thinks it impossible - hell, Michio Kaku wrote a very interesting physics book about it.  But I don't know any scientists that feel comfortable with the scarcity of hard evidence, either. In any event, it is a phenomenon that continues and I for one would like to see all the sentimentality and ridicule surrounding the subject thrown out in favor of rational discussion and a thorough and pervasive investigation including all the evidence humans can or have collected.\n\nTL;DR:  Enough evidence to warrant investigation, not enough to overcome cultural bias - a bias engineered by military institutions.", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348782260", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0}

{"body": "Ok Firstly. You come across as kind of a massive dick by the way. Just because I posit a certain argument it doesn't mean that's my personal belief.\nSecondly, I think you miss the point here. It's more about semantics than anything to do with belief really. When someone says they are agnostic they might be a \"weak atheist\" or it may be that they just have a more stringent definition of \"known\" than you. Until mankind has figured out *every* law that governs the universe, explored every nook and cranny of every alternate universe, dimension and quanta, proven exactly what exists outside our universe and where all energy and matter came from, then and only then can we say with certainty there is no god. Ironically it's the gnostic atheists who apply the weakest scientific rationalism. \n\nTo analogise. Lets say we're in the middle of the 19th century and two scientists are looking for the loch ness monster. Neither believe in it, they think it's a silly story believed only by the ignorant masses. One of them takes a few samples from the lake. He's quite thorough actually. He goes around in a little boat and goes down in a diving bell for a good look around in several points of the lake. He lists all the flora and fauna of the lake. Because he finds no evidence, he knows that the monster does not exist. The second scientist however is more thorough. He runs a search that involves thousands of men diving into the lake to search every inch simultaneously. Because he finds no evidence, he knows that the monster does not exist. Which is applying the better method? The first scientist only has enough evidence to make an educated guess. It gives more evidence to strengthen his belief but it proves nothing.\n\nIn the end none of it matters because neither believed there was a loch ness monster anyway. Just as I and you don't believe in god. I 100% don't believe. Existence of a god simply doesn't fit into the paradigm of how I understand the universe to work. However I still don't *know* there isn't something in the dark undiscovered depths of mankind's knowledge gaps that could be construed as a god. Be it an angry beardy sky jew or some form of consciousness, higher than our own which somehow can organise timespace and energy. We haven't disproved it... yet.

Anyways I was at the end of a graveyard shift and just about to switch my sign off and retire for the night.

{"body": "Well, I should probably make a throwaway account for this, but he died recently anyway. I guess some things stop mattering when the people involved die...\n\nSo I had this uncle, but he was never really my uncle. Just a really close family friend who grew up with my parents, and we called him Uncle Joe. Coolest guy in the world. He never married, and had no children that we ever knew about, so he always had a lot of excess money. When he found out my parents were going to have me, he invested a considerable amount of money into a college savings fund. He did this for my three younger siblings too, and as such, paying for school has been a lot easier. Like I said, Uncle Joe was the best.\n\nAnyway, Uncle Joe owned this piece of property in Northern California. We called it \"The Farm\" because he kept a few chickens and other small livestock, but it was never much of a farm. My family would spend a couple of weeks there in the summer to relax and unwind from city life. The air was always clean, and I don't know how he managed it, but the grass was always green.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to me being fifteen. Even though me and my siblings had always just accepted Uncle Joe as family, there was always just something off about him. In the summer of 2007, we were up at the farm like any normal summer. I forget the reasons why, but my family decided to take a day trip away from the farm and go see one of the local landmarks. Some sort of cave or something. Anyway, when it comes time to go, my stomach started churning and I ended vomiting all over the door of my parents Suburban. Being the awesome uncle he was, Uncle Joe volunteered to keep me at the house so that the rest of my family could go have fun exploring the caves. \n\nAt first I was sort of disappointed about missing out on the caves, but after vomiting a second time (into the toilet. no harm done), I decided it wasn't that big of a loss. So there I was, sitting on my Uncle's couch watching shitty sitcom re-runs with a five gallon puke bucket next to me. At some point, I dozed off and kind of went off. It was that sort of fevered restless sleep that you get when you're as sick as I was, but it felt good to have my eyes closed.\n\nSuddenly though, I wake up and I hear six gun shots go off outside. At first I thought I was imagining it all, but then I heard my uncle screaming for help outside. Not sure what as going on, but eager to find out, I stumbled to my feet and ran outside to see what was going on. A black SUV tore out of the gravel driveway as I opened the front door.\n\nI found Uncle Joe gasping for air on the driveway, choking on his own blood. I counted six bullet wounds in his chest. Some fucked up shit for a fifteen year old to see, but I was in too much shock to even realize it. The only thing I could think of was to call 911, so I turned to run back inside the house for my cell phone. Before I could though, he managed to sputter out \"Wait! Stop!\" so I did. Uncle Joe beckoned me to come closer, and again, I complied. \n\n\"I need to tell you something...\" he croaked out, blood running down his chin. I think he knew he didn't have much time left. \n\n\"What is it, Uncle Joe?\" I asked. At this point, the gravity of the situation was hitting me. It was so unreal, like watching it from the third person.\n\n\"I need to tell you what happened. I need to tell you everything. I just need to come clean. But you can't tell anyone.\" The words were muddled, and mixed with blood and mucous, but that's what he said.\n\n\"You can tell me anything, Uncle Joe. I'll keep it a secret.\" my eyes welled up with tears. I have never cried like that before, and I pray to God I never have a reason to ever again. But I squinted through the tears and tried my best to be strong. I was then that I noticed that Uncle Joe was 500 feet tall from the paleolithic era.\n\n\"I'm gonna need about tree-fiddy.\"\n\nSo I stood up and yelled \"“God Damnit Loch Ness Monster, I ain’t gonna give you no tree fiddy!”\n\nI never went back to Uncle Joe's farm.

Headstrong, like any typical teen, with a \"don't fuck with me attitude\" And taking years of self defense and martial arts didnt help that arrogance.\n\nTo get striaght to it, I killed man, out of self defense. I know this is about to sound hardcore cliche but hear me out. \n\nIt was on a night when I was walking home from work. I didn't get my drivers license until late summer after I had turned 18 so I didn't really have a car either. This meant I would sometimes have to walk back from work.

Although I probably didn't do very well with my \"urban camo\"\n\nWell, one night I guess some guy was really low in his life. Just striaght up pulled a knife on me, demanded money. I ran, he chased and since I had a busy shift that day I was tired and noticed him catching up quick. A switch in my head just went off from \"flight\" to \"fight\" mode and instinct took over. This poor sap wasn't playing games, went in with a lunge and I side stepped left, bent his elbow, plunged the knife right into his chest. This wasn't a small knife either ...\n\n\"What. The. Fuck\" I was frozen, what did I just fucking do ... he was down. I started trying to help him. Like an idoit I pulled out the knife, tried to put pressure on him as I fumbled with my shitty ass flip phone. Poor soul starting sputtering, \"i don wanna die man ... I .. dont ... man.\" The shaking in his voice was nerve racking and I can still here it now.\n\n\"Just... I'm, so sorry, it'll be alright.'\n\n\"Man..I ....\" He started becoming incoherent, but I kept trying to listen.\n\nI'll never forget what he said.\n\n\"I ...

{"body": "Well, since you asked, yes. Lemme give you the whole story.\n\nI really only ever did have one friend throughout all of school, her name was Kayla and she was super nice to everyone. She was the girl who was always smiling, laughing, and would include everyone.\n\nI transferred to Kayla's school when I was in grade 3 because my dad got transferred to the west coast for his job. My very first day, my teacher assigned me a seat right next to Kayla. Even in third grade, her beauty was stunning. Long brown hair, brown eyes. That was my first crush. \n\nEvery year that passed, Kayla became more and more stunning. I was her best friend, I wasn't supposed to like her, but I did. By 10th grade I was drowning in the friendzone. But that didn't matter to me. All I cared about was being close to her. \n\nThe closer we got, the harder it was to be pulled out of the friendzone. Every time is muster up the strength and tell her I liked her she would always tell me she liked me too, *as a friend*. Of course it killed me to hear it. I didn't just like her. I loved her. She had always been with me, helped me figure out my life, and had always stood up for me. Her physical appearance wasn't too bad either. By tenth grade her hair was down to her butt, and she had perfected the makeup she applied on top of her big brown eyes.\n\nThe friendzone seemed to travel deeper and deeper, and I was being pulled in quicker every day. But I didn't care. I was with Kayla.\n\nGraduation came along and she was the valedictorian. For some reason, even though we were all wearing the same robes, she stood out. She glistened in the sunlight as she addressed our class, our parents, and our teachers. Kayla looked like an angel. She was an angel to me at least.\n\nLater that night we had a huge party at her house for all the graduates. Naturally, as any 18 year old would do, we got drunk off our asses. The music blared and we all danced, sang, and drank together. I was having the time of my life. Kayla was laughing at all my jokes, and going along with all my advances. Everything was going great. \n\nAt around 1am, Kayla, myself, and a couple of other friends were playing truth or dare and if someone did the dare, you drank. Everyone was doing stupid shit and laughing. The dares kept on coming, and we were getting stupider and stupider. Then my buddy Ryan dared Kayla to kiss me, so she did. I was in heaven. A couple dares later and I was given a lap dance by Kayla. My buddies kept on trying to hook me up with her but Kayla kept laughing it all off saying it was cool because we were friends. Goddammit.\n\nMore people join the game, and more of us get off our ass drunk. Eventually, the dare that sealed the deed happened. Kayla was dared to play 7 minutes in heaven with me. So she dragged me to her garage (as we were all outside) and we chatted for a little. She complained she was uncomfortable, so she took off her shirt. Damn. It was amazing seeing her tits for the first time. Then she walked closer to me. I could tell by the look in her eyes what was about to happen. She sat me down on top of her Sunfire and unzipped my pants.\n\nHer eyes said it all. The lust, the excitement, and the happiness. She slid back up to look me in the eyes and then whispered in my ear in her smoldering voice, \"that'll be about tree fiddy.\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348871932", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 486, "controversiality": 0}

The day of our big biology test thats 40% of our grade he comes in and tells me that he didn't study. Well, I tell him he's screwed. Test comes and half way through I see him peeking over at my test. At first I'm fine with it but whenever I would right down and answer I would then see him write it down, for the entire test. I was a little pissed so I told him to stop but then the teacher hears me and then comes over and rips the test right in front of me. I just sit there like \"Wha!\" and she says \"I told you no talking\" then proceeds to give me a detention. The next day I go up to my friend and he shows me his test and he has an A and he's laughing like \"Ha that's funny the entire time I was just looking at your test and now I have an A and you have an F\" Then I punch him in the eye. It wasn't even swollen just bleeding. The teacher comes up to me and says \"You're in big trouble, and you're going to pay\" I say \"How much\" Then she looks at me right in the eyes and says \"About tree fiddy\"", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": "1348979294", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 0, "controversiality": 0}

While eating, discuss your relationship over salmon and fine wine, and play a little footsies with him. Make sure you can get him tipsy-drunk by the end of the night. When you get home, say that he's too drunk to get undressed and you'll help him. Slowly undress him and eventually start getting sensual. Offer him head, and if he declines just tease him into it.  Give his dick an express journey down your throat and terrorize his balls with your fingers. allow him to cum naturally and catch every drop in your mouth. Get up, make eye contact, and throw him on the bed. Climb over him and begin riding him, slowly at first gradually getting faster. Allow him to cum in your ass, then suck off his penis one last time. By now he should be totally tired, so lie next to him and cuddle him. Ask him if he enjoyed it, and no matter what he says say that you need something from him. He'll answer what very sensually.
